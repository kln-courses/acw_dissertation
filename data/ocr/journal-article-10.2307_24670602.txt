"Caring for the Self" was part of the philosophical ideal; in this period we encoun ter for the first time the terms iatrophilosophos [doctor-philosopher] and iatroso phistesphistes [doctor-sophist]. The rabbis adopted many of the Greek medical ideas and practices, but combined them with the biblical tradition to formulate a unique rabbinic system. This is also the case with the inspection of skin afflictions as pre scribed in Lev 13-14, interpreted in m. Nega'im in dialogue with the contempora neous Galenic medical discourse. The rabbis present themselves as interpreters of bodies, interweaving the hermeneutics of texts and the hermeneutics of bodies which was also a prominent aspect of Galen's work. Their legal expertise takes the form and rhetoric of a distinctly medical expertise. The biblical monopoly of the priests in this area is denied; they have to follow the instructions of the rabbis and are relegated to the function of a rubber stamp. The whole discussion concerns exclusively the examination of the Jewish body. Gentiles by definition cannot be examined with regard to their [imjpurity; Gentiles are viewed as uninterpretable humans. The body of the people of Israel, on the other hand, is interpretable because it is defined by the law. Thus, the rabbis could claim to interpret bodies like medical experts as a derivative of their legal and text-interpretive expertise).

The choice which language—Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek—to use in which context was essential for the preservation of Jewish identity and the possibility of interac tion with non-Jews. Hebrew remained a living language in many spheres although we cannot say when exactly sages spoke it. In the liturgy Hebrew was the preferred language, but other languages, especially Greek, were also possible. The same holds true for the reading and study of the Torah; it could be in Hebrew, in Hebrew and Aramaic, or in Hebrew and Greek. Early rabbinic literature attests to the inner-Jewish use of Hebrew and Aramaic together, be it the interpenetration of the languages, internal translation or linguistic code-switching, as, e.g., in the Hebrew letters of the patriarchs embedded in an Aramaic narrative context. The same pattern of multilingual language choice emerges from documentary texts and from inscriptions; in spite of the dynamic variability in the use of the lan guages, there is a high degree of consistency; in this regard, the inscriptions and the rabbinic literature are not essentially different); 309-325 Moshe Bar-Asher, On On On Some Unique Forms in Noun Formation in Mishnaic Hebrew (B.-A. analyzes some irregular forms in the morphology of nouns, mainly in MSS Kaufmann and Parma. The forms גדור [m. Kil. 4:3] and פינים [m. Mid. 1:1] instead of the regular forms גדר and פינות are explained by attraction, the assimilation to other forms in the near context. The form טחונן in 1n. Menah. 11:3 was misunderstood by the vocalizer of MS Kaufmann as the verbal form טחנן [he therefore erased the vav) whereas the scribe clearly understood it as a nominal form. Another difference between the scribe and the vocalizer of MS Kaufmann is to be found in m. Sotah 3:5 where the rare form גנב, with the same meaning as גנבה [theft], is used with the attached possessive pronoun, once in the masculine form גנבו and once in the feminine form גנבה; the vocalizer mistook it for the feminine form גניבה without suffix and thus 'corrected' it to גניבתה).

Particularly rich are the finds of coins and seals from the late Persian and early Hellenistic periods: One half of a silver-coated coin from Cyprus, part of a coin from Chios and half of an Athenian tetradrachm from the sixth to fifth centuries apparently were used as Hacksilber that reached this site in the fourth century before coins became normal means of payment. Coins from the later Persian period comprise an Athenian tetradrachm of the fourth century, six coins with the Paleohebrew inscription יהד and one inscribed יחזקיה הפחה, eighteen Philistine coins and six which probably were minted in Idumea. Three coins bear the name of Alexander the Great and fifteen coins those of Ptolemy I and II. Most interesting among several small seals is one with a scarab in Phoenician stile); 29-34 D.

The installation was expanded in the early Roman period, adding more pools for the preparation of the clay and for the purification of the pottery; several handles are inscribed in Hebrew.

Hadas, The Second Temple Period Village at at the En-Gedi Oasis (In the years 2003-2010 part of the village of the Second Temple period was excavated; a street leading from south to north, lined on both sides by a dozen of dwelling-houses, built on virgin soil. The latest coins found in the excavation are from the second year of the revolt against Rome. Thus, the vil lage may have been destroyed by the sicarii in the year 67/68 [Josephus, Bellum 4:402] or slightly later by the Romans.

Compared with the many theaters known from excavations, there are only few examples of the much smaller odeon that served not the masses, but the cultural elite, and was built only from the 1st century B.C.E. to the 2d century C.E.

On top of the hill is a well preserved central building, measuring 30x30 meters, with its walls partly still standing up to a height of 1.5 meters. It is surrounded by a number of smaller buildings and caves, and also a stone pyramid, apparently a nefesh. There are earlier remains, but the pottery and coins as well as the architecture point to the late 4th or early 3d cen turies. At that time, the central building probably belonged to a rich landowner or to a local ruler. Later on, it deteriorated and was partly abandoned; in the late 2d century B.C.E. it was destroyed by fire. The ethnicity of the owners remains unknown; in its last stage the building may have served as an inn. Apparently the owners took away all valuable objects when they left the building. In the early Roman period, some people, perhaps Jews, returned to the building and lived in part of it for a short period).

As a result of his analysis of numerous cases, B. proposes to distinguish between cases where a rabbi responds to an anonymous single source, and where rabbis react to more elaborate discus sions. Only these latter texts normally belong to the latest stages of the Bavli whereas in cases of single sources frequently amoraim of early generations are involved.

Ketub. 8a]. If "in his image" is referred to God, the coherence of the bless ing is problematic. It is therefore better to understand the blessing as a kind of midrash on Gen 1:27; בצלמו, following some traditions, is to be referred not to God, but to Adam, to mankinds image, to the form in which he was created.

M. claims that many such explanations are found in the Yerushalmi, although without this terminology, and analyzes several examples.

Albeck maintained that Bereshit Rabba Rabba was prior to Wayyiqra Rabba and that, therefore, parallel passages between these two midrashim are secondary in Wayyiqra Rabba. Since this claim was based on only two parallel passages, M. studies them again in great detail as well as two more passages which have been used for the same argument. He concludes that at least for two passages it may be claimed that Wayyiqra Rabba has preserved a more original formulation. But it would be premature to reach a final decision on the basis of a few isolated examples since the relationship between works of the oral Torah is extremely complicated.

Activities regarded as similar to any principal category of forbidden work, are subsumed under this heading and oblige only to a single offering. In the Yerushalmi, great effort is made to list sub categories for each principal form of labor, toladot, "descendants," belonging to the main categories, avot melakhah. For this purpose, abstract definitions for each ανav melakhah have to be found. In the Bavli, the terms toladah or toladot are not used in this context. But there are eight sugiyot in other contexts where the term is used. A. concludes from an analysis of these sugiyot that this terminology was transferred to Babylonia not before Rava's time and was used only in later sugiyot, and even there not often); 307-331 Moshe Assis, From Jewish Neo-Aramaic to TalmudicTalmudic and Geonic Aramaic (The Dialect of Zakho) (There are cases where lin guistic problems in both Talmudim and in Geonic literature may find a solution on the basis of Neo-Aramaic); 387-426 Shamma Friedman, What Does Mt.

The mention of Sinai in Leviticus seems superfluous since the law was already stated as part of the revelation on Sinai in Exod 23:11; for Sifra, each and every law was laid down in its entirety at Sinai. The problem of Sifra is taken up again in a baraita of the Bavli [Sotah 37b; Hag. 6b; Zebah. 115b]. R.

R. Aqiva, on the other hand, maintains that the Torah in its entirety was given at Sinai, and then fully repeated in the Tabernacle and promulgated a third time in the plains of Moab.

Jeromes translation of these passages was used in Jewish literature of medieval France); English Section VII-XXVIII Richard Kalmin, Pharisees in Rabbinic Literature of Late Antiquity (In the Mishnah and the Tosefta, contradictory opinions of Pharisees and Saddu cees are juxtaposed without polemics. Quite different is the approach of the Bavli, even in traditions which are presented as baraitot. The Babylonian rabbis some times use the terms "sages" and "Pharisees" interchangeably and depict the Phari sees positively whereas the Yerushalmi never presents the Pharisees as rabbis or portrays them with particular sympathy. Such differences may be explained by the appearance of Josephan or Josephus-like traditions, depicting the Pharisees with features characteristic of rabbis. Such traditions do not appear in Palestinian rab binic compilations. On the other hand, the Bavli also transmits the motif of the Pharisees as hypocrites. This does not necessarily contradict the Babylonian por trayal of the Pharisees as proto-rabbis—■they distinguished between good and bad Pharisees, as they also criticize members of the rabbinic movement. The term "Pharisee" as such has for the Bavli no negative connotation). Giinter Stemberger Svensk Exegetisk Arsbok 76 (2011), 1-19 John J. Collins, Apocalypse and Empire Empire (The essay criticizes Richard Horsley's view of apocalyptic literature as solely concerned with imperial rule and the opposition to it.

Based on a reading of Daniel and the Book of Watchers, Collins documents how resistance in these works may take different forms. In the latter emphasis is placed on resistance against cultural innovation and in the former—also acknowledging internal differences in Daniel between the Tales' part the Visions' part—opposi tion takes the form of visualizing the world in a new way. Ultimately, Horsley's understanding does not pay heed to generic differences between apocalypses and earlier prophetic works); 41-59 Cecilia Wassen, Visions of the Temple: Conflicting Images Images of the Eschaton (The author emphasizes the diversity of temple images found in the Dead Sea Scrolls. The emphasis placed on a future, ideal temple in 11QT, the hope for a restored cult in Admonition, laws in D and 4QMMT\ocat ing the sacred realm elsewhere in time and space is in tension with the notion of the community as a sanctuary found in QS. Whereas 4QFlorilegium combines notions of a future, eschatological temple with ideas of the community as a pres ent sanctuary, Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice endorse the idea of the community as a meeting place of heaven and earth); 193-210 Torleif Elgvin, Mystiske tekster i tidligjedisktidligjedisktidligjedisk og Kristen tradisjon (In a review-article on recent literature on early Jewish and Christian mystical texts, the author examines numerous books on the topic. The Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice come to the fore of the discussion. Refer ring to Philip Alexander's Mystical Texts, London 2006, Elgvin concurs with the author that these texts exhibit an unio angelica et liturgica, where participants saw themselves in union with angels and as partakers of the heavenly liturgy. Rachel Elior's hypothesis of a continuous priestly line of mystical tradition from Ezekiel to Qumran in The Three Temples: On the Emergence of Jewish Mysticism, Oxford and Portland 2004/5, is severely criticized. Peter Schafer's The Origins of Jewish Mysticism,Mysticism, Tiibingen 2009, is praised as a lasting contribution to the subject. The author concurs with Schafer's criticism of scholars using hekhalot and shi'ur qoma texts as background for New Testament texts. Based on the late dating of the hek halot ζηά shi'ur qomahalot ζηά shi'ur qoma traditions, Elgvin contends that early Christian texts exerted influence on the Jewish tradition and not the other way around. Engaging with recent scholarship on religious and mystical experience [April DeConick (ed.), Paradise Paradise Now: Essays in Early Jewish and Christian Mysticism, Atlanta 2006; Fran ces Flannery (ed.), Experientia (2008); Colleen Shantz' Paul in Ecstacy.

Its version in b. Sabb. 33b-34a, is much different from the Palestinian version in y. Seb. 9:1, 38d, partly due to R.
