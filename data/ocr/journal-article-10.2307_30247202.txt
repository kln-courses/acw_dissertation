COLE Vermont College Graduate Program Montpelier, VT 05602 ABSTRACT Structurally consistent representations of katsina masks and masked katsinas are identifiable as katsina iconography of the Hopi and Zuni and provide com- parative examples for the identification of katsina iconography at the Homol'ovi site group. An inventory of Homol'ovi rock art produced 72 exam- ples of comparable mask and katsina representations in the vicinities of Homol'ovi II and Homol'ovi IV. Similar masks and katsinas are represented on ceramics and other material culture and are included in regional and broadly de- fined rock art styles. The evidence suggests that the katsina cult with public symbolism was present at the Homol'ovi sites and is associated with occupa- tions dated between approximately A.D. 1250 and A.D. 1400. This article examines iconography of the katsina cult in relation to petro- glyphs associated with the Homol'ovi group in the central Little Colorado River Valley near Winslow, Arizona. The six sites in this group include the clustered sites of Homol'ovi I, Homol'ovi II, and Homol'ovi IV, and the sites of Cotton- wood Creek and Chevelon Ruin. The study is focused on petroglyphs in associa- tion with Homol'ovi II and Homol'ovi IV, pueblos dated between A.D. 1200 and 1400 (see the introductory article in this volume by E. C. Adams). It is recog- nized, however, that some of the petroglyphs possibly date from after A.D. 1400 because the Hopi continued to visit shrines in the vicinity of the sites into the his- toric period (Fewkes 1898). Iconography is defined here as pictures that illustrate or are related to a sub- ject, including art that uses conventional images and symbols to represent mythic or religious subjects. Comparative data are drawn from historic and ethnographic accounts of the Western Pueblos of Hopi and Zuni because such information is well published, and there are clear archaeological and historical associations between Homol'ovi and the Hopi and archaeological ties with the Zuni (Adams 1985; Hays and Adams 1985). Examples of katsina iconography are identified as such in the historic rec- ord and include images from katsina cult paraphernalia, kiva wall murals, an offi- cial document, and rock art. It is recognized that rock art presents a special prob- lem because historic and ethnographic reporters often do not give information about the age of rock art. Therefore, it is possible that some rock art examples of katsina iconography identified historically are prehistoric because the Hopi and Zuni areas have been continuously occupied (Cordell 1984). For the purpose of this study, examples of katsina iconography in rock art that have been historically identified are considered important comparative material even if some examples 313</page><page sequence="2">314 COLE may be prehistoric in origin. It is recognized, however, that the value of such rock art examples as comparative data for prehistoric rock art is dependent upon their similarity to iconography that is demonstrably historic in origin. The nature of the katsina cult and its iconography are discussed, followed by discussions of Homol'ovi rock art and of material culture and rock art styles that have temporal significance and support relationships between katsina iconography and late thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Homol'ovi pueblos. Four categories of material culture that date from the late thirteenth century and the early seventeenth century and that have designs comparable to katsina iconography in rock art are ceramics, stone slabs, architecture (kiva wall murals), and wooden objects. THE KATSINA CULT AND KATSINA ICONOGRAPHY The katsina cult as manifested among the Hopi and Zuni involves the person- ation by masked individuals of spiritual beings, katsinas, that serve as friendly in- termediaries between the gods and man for rain and other benefits such as fertility and good health. Katsinas also are associated with the dead and ancestral spirits. Some katsinas have qualities of deities and act as their earthly representatives. Deific qualities are symbolized by behavior and by iconography, and the role played by individual katsinas may be indicated by changes in the mask. An example is Maasaw, a powerful god or spirit of death, war, and fertility, who also appears as a dance katsina at Hopi (Titiev 1944:185, 236-238). The katsina cult is a ceremonial complex that integrates the social and religi- ous aspects of a community. Katsina personators perform in public ritual dramas and dances involving clan and village histories and the preparation and distribu- tion of food and gifts among family and friends. Participation in various activities and benefits of the cult is universal; clans, kiva groups, and esoteric societies that observe separate religious rites control and are involved in ceremonies of the katsina cult (Titiev 1944; Stevenson 1904). Masks are the most definitive material and symbolic traits although katsinas may wear decorative clothing including kilts and sashes, exhibit elaborate body painting, and carry items such as crooks, bows, and evergreens. Decorative cloth- ing, body paint, crooks, evergreens, and other items also appear in nonkatsina ceremonies (Stevenson 1904; Titiev 1944). Katsina masks are helmet and face types (and in some cases facial paint) with emphasized facial features, usually the mouth and eyes. Bared teeth often are indi- cated. Masks have interior painted designs and exterior attachments such as ears, beards, hair (long and styled), feathers, and headdresses including horns, tablitas (decorated flat, thin pieces of wood), birds, and plant forms. These attributes are symbolic qualities of the individual katsinas represented. Katsina masks are believed to have great power and serve to transform the wearers into spiritual beings (Bunzel 1932:902-903; Titiev 1944:109). Certain masks, those of the mon or priest katsinas, are believed to be ancient and appear in</page><page sequence="3">Katsina Iconography 315 the most important ceremonies in which kivas are ritually opened and closed, and village and clan histories are recounted. Mon katsina masks, controlled by certain clans, are traditional in appearance and are not changed through time. Other masks, such as dance masks, may vary according to the intentions of the makers; and new dance masks and katsinas are continually introduced whereas others dis- appear. Generally the mon katsina masks, such as that of Eototo at Hopi (Fewkes 1903:Plate 14) and Hu'tutu at Zuni (Stevenson 1904:Plate 55) are simpler than other masks in appearance, suggesting that katsina masks have become more complex or decorative through time. The katsina cult and katsina masks of the Hopi and Zuni are extensively described in the literature (Fewkes 1901, 1903; Stevenson 1904; Bunzel 1932; Titiev 1944). This article focuses on katsina masks and masked katsina representations as definitive iconography of the katsina cult and suitable for comparison with prehis- toric Homol'ovi rock art. Munn (1966:948) proposes that visual representational systems, such as the masking system of the pueblos, "are built upon the principle of discrete, recurrent contrasts" in one- or two-dimensional forms that can be structurally identified. A katsina cult representational or iconographic system consists of roughly rectangular or circular masks differentiated by diagnostic sym- bols or diacritical emblems that distinguish katsinas as a series or as individuals in the manner that the various interior and exterior mask attributes distinguish katsinas. Structurally consistent masks and katsinas occur in art associated with the Hopi and Zuni, and examples of the katsina iconography from various media are illustrated in Figures 1 through 5. These include mask petroglyphs from Willow Springs, Hopi clan "signatures," petroglyphs of masks and katsinas from Hopi, a katsina from a Hopi kiva mural, a katsina painted on an upright altar slat at Hopi, a petroglyph mask near Zuni, and katsina mask and katsina representations on Zuni altars used in katsina ceremonies. The most demonstrably historic exam- ples are illustrated in Figures 2, 4, and 5. Mask and katsina representations appear in association with symbolism of other socio-religious organizations (clans and esoteric societies) and in contexts remote from masked katsina performances. An example is the use of katsina mask petroglyphs to symbolize the Katsina Clan and Maasaw Clan at Tutuventiwngwu (Willow Springs), Arizona, a Hopi shrine near the trail to sacred salt deposits in the Little Colorado River canyon (Figure 1). These masks and a variety of other clan symbols were made by individuals participating in salt-gathering expeditions possibly since the prehistoric period and into historic times (Colton and Colton 1931; Titiev 1937; Michaelis 1981; Malotki and Lomatuway'ma 1987). The salt- gathering expeditions are associated with the Soyal katsina ceremony but do not directly involve masked participants. A second and related use of mask and katsina representations is the drawing of katsina mask clan "signatures" on an official document (Fewkes 1897) (Figure 2). Such uses of katsina symbolism emphasize how deeply the katsina cult is in- tegrated into Hopi society.</page><page sequence="4">316 COLE a b Figure 1. a.

Katsina iconography may be conventional and simplified in its appearance, and such art is likely to be dependent upon traditional knowledge for precise iden- tification; for example, mask and katsina symbols of the Katsina Clan and Maasaw Clan at Willow Springs (Figure 1). A full-figure Maasaw (Figure lb) is pecked in profile and shown with a protruding brow and holding a club. These are diagnostic symbols of the god and katsina (Malotki and Lomatuway'ma 1987:Fig.4, 7). The remaining Maasaw representations are more simple and have less diagnostic symbolism. Three of the five Katsina Clan masks (Figure la), which are not individually identified by the source, are also relatively simple representations without detailed symbolism. All the masks and katsinas shown in Figure I are recognizable as part of a structurally consistent katsina cult iconographic system but may be difficult to identify precisely, especially if the site context is unknown. This uncertainty of precise identification is even more probable in regard to prehistoric katsina iconography that is temporally and spatially removed from the historic record.

As a result, comparisons between historic iconography and Homol'ovi rock art in this paper are made on a systems level based on the structural qualities of mask and katsina representations. Some of the katsina iconography in rock art documented by Stephen (1969) and Fewkes (1892) near the Hopi Mesas is weathered and old, whereas other art is comparatively recent in origin. "The Tusayan pictographs... are very numerous, there being hardly a trail leading to the mesas near which they are not found. The subjects which they represent are those for the most part dealing with mythologi- cal personages or the representations of masks which at present appear in religious ceremonies" (Fewkes 1892:10). Stevenson (1904) and Young (1985) report petro- glyphs and rock paintings of katsina masks on cliffs and in rock shelters in the vicinity of the village of Zuni.</page><page sequence="6">318 COLE a b c d Figure 3. a.

A total of 363 petroglyph panels were found at the four general locations during a 1987 inventory. Forty-nine panels exhibit 72 examples of mask and katsina representations that are structur- ally comparable to katsina iconography of the Hopi and Zuni discussed above (Figures 1-5). The majority of masks and katsinas (67) are located in the vicinity of Homol'ovi II, and five are located near Homol'ovi IV. Figures 6 and 7 show examples of mask/katsina representations in the vicinity of Homol'ovi II. Additional katsina iconography occurs near Cottonwood Creek Ruin and at a second site located to the east of the sites described earlier. Rock art at these sites was inventoried in 1987 but is not included in this article because of space limita- tions and because archaeological research is presently concentrated in the area of the sites under discussion. Petroglyphs at Homol'ovi are pecked, ground, scratched, incised, and abraded and are exhibited on boulders, rockshelter walls, rock outcrops, rock alcoves, and on high faces of mesa escarpments. Controlled pecking (probably with a hammer- stone and pecking stone) is the dominant technique of manufacture. Some of the rock art, including mask and katsina representations, is in locations such as rock shelters and narrow passageways between boulders that are not readily visible, but most images are easily seen upon approach. Rock art in the vicinity of Homol'ovi II, including katsina iconography, occurs on and near the mesa upon which the ruin sits and would have been both accessible and visible to prehistoric groups in the area. Rock art panels, often found on different faces of a single large boulder, occur in clusters and in isolation. The petroglyphs are manufactured on sandstones of the Shinarump and Moenkopi formations. Petroglyph preservation is generally much better for those on finer-grained Shinarump sandstone than on the Moenkopi, which often shows significant surface deterioration. Some petroglyphs on the latter are partially de- stroyed as a result of crumbled and spalled surface areas. Modern vandalism by gunfire, scratching, and abrading has damaged petroglyphs at Homol'ovi, par- ticularly those near Homol'ovi II. With the exception of a few sheltered locations, the Homol'ovi petroglyphs are open and exposed to the elements. Panels, including those with mask and kat- sina representations, have a variety of directional orientations, including upward. Relative levels of patination on petroglyphs range from light to complete (equal to the background rock patina). Elements with an upward orientation and those with a western orientation generally are more heavily patinated and more deteriorated.</page><page sequence="10">322 COLE C d a b Figure 6. a.

Some petroglyphs occur in close proximity to structures and stone circles, particularly at sites near Homol'ovi II and IV. Mask and katsina representations were not found in these locations during the 1987 survey. Weaver and others (1982) observe that petroglyphs near Homol'ovi II occur in association with a clay deposit and a possible dam or reservoir. Four (possibly as many as eight) masks and katsinas found during the 1987 survey are located near clay deposits in the vicinity of Homol'ovi II. Isolated boulders near sand dunes and flat areas along the Little Colorado River may be associated with prehistoric agricultural fields as boundary markers, but mask and katsina representations were not found among petroglyphs in these locations. Although Stephen (1969:390) describes a Hopi boundary stone marked with the face of Maasaw, similar stone images have not been located at Homol'ovi. Clusters of petroglyphs in the vicinity of Homol'ovi II (Weaver and others 1982) are associated with locations that may have served as shrines. Rock shel- ters, which are rare in the Homol'ovi site group area, may have been shrines along with prominent points on mesas, isolated rock outcrops, narrow rock alcoves, and piles of boulders. Mask and katsina representations occur in these locations in the vicinities of Homol'ovi II and Homol'ovi IV. Similar places are used as shrines by the Hopi and Zuni and are sometimes associated with katsina cult activities and with rock art having katsina iconography (Stevenson 1904:232-235; Fewkes 1906:362-364; Stephen 1969:1010-1012). TEMPORAL ASSOCIATIONS FOR KATSINA ICONOGRAPHY Fourteenth century ceramics and stone slabs with mask and katsina represen- tations similar to historic examples (Figures 1-5) and to Homol'ovi rock art (Fig- ures 6 and 7) are described by Hays (this volume). An additional description of fourteenth-century ceramics with similar representations is provided by Ferg (1982). Cummings (1940:Plate 34) illustrates a katsina painted on a stone slab dated A.D. 1250 to 1400, and Di Peso (1950:60-61) illustrates masks on stone slabs dated A.D. 1400 to 1450. Smith (1952:Fig. 27-28, 92) illustrates painted masks and katsinas from Awatovi kiva murals dating from the late fourteenth century to the early seven- teenth century. These images have obvious similarities to historic katsina icono- graphy and to Homol'ovi petroglyphs despite the differences in media. Haury (1945:Fig. 128d) illustrates katsina-like images formed from painted and shaped wood. These stick objects are dated approximately A.D. 1400. Katsina iconography in Homol'ovi rock art is associated with rock art styles dated from archaeological evidence, site location, physical appearance, and</page><page sequence="13">Katsina Iconography 325 similarities to material culture designs. The Homol'ovi site group petroglyphs have been described and analyzed by Pilles (1975) and discussed by Weaver and others (1982) and Weaver (1984). Using data from Homol'ovi and other central Little Colorado River sites, Pilles developed a sequence of five prehistoric styles, based primarily on technological attributes and secondarily on design, that he relates to the culture history of the re- gion. The rock art is proposed to be sequentially associated with Basketmaker (100 B.C. to A.D. 1000) through Pueblo IV (A.D. 1300-1600) populations. The rock art styles are compared to styles identified by Turner (1963, 1971) in the Glen Canyon region. One style identified by Pilles is of specific interest here: the Pueblo IV Style, which dates between A.D. 1300 and 1600 and follows the Late Pueblo III-Early Pueblo IV Style. Pilles compares elements of the Pueblo IV Style to those of Pueblo IV ceramic decorations. Pecked outline and solid forms are present in the Pueblo IV Style and appear to be associated with specific types of elements. This is considered a change from previous petroglyph styles that also have elements formed by outlines and by solid pecking but are not obviously associated with particular element types. Continuities of forms and subject matter have been observed by Pilles (1975) and have been observed during this study. Continuity with earlier styles is seen in the representations of solid animals with bird-shaped bodies, stick figures, foot- prints, geometrics, and parrots. Also, zig-zag and more realistic snakes, an- thropomorphs with spread legs and arms, and "lizard-man" forms with elongated bodies, tails (or phalluses), and spread arms and legs continue to be represented. Fourteenth-century ceramic designs from Homol'ovi illustrated by Hays (this vol- ume) include similar "lizard-man" forms. New representations noted by Pilles (1975) for the Pueblo IV Style include blocky feet on animals and anthropomorphs, composite animal forms, possible katsina masks, and masked anthropomorphs. Pilles (1975:12) states that the katsina masks are images that are most obviously related to Pueblo IV Style art. The masks described and illustrated by Pilles are circular forms in outline with headdresses, circular eyes, large ears, gaping mouths, and bared teeth. An- thropomorphic bodies are rectangular and circular outline forms (sometimes with interior decorations) as well as linear or stick-figure types. Examples of masks and masked anthropomorphs illustrated by Pilles (1975) occur in the vicinity of Homol'ovi II and are among the representations identified as katsina iconography in this study. Weaver and others (1982) and Weaver (1984) do not discuss rock art style categories, but they do illustrate katsina masks and relate such petroglyphs to the Pueblo IV occupation of Homol'ovi II. According to Weaver and others (1982) katsina mask elements and snake elements tend to occur alone or in clusters and are usually larger than elements occurring on the same panels. Weaver (1984:18-</page><page sequence="14">326 COLE 19, 23) illustrates masks near Homol'ovi II and notes that katsina masks are asso- ciated with Pueblo IV sites in the Winslow area. Schaafsma (1975a:129-163, 1975b, 1980, 1981) and Schaafsma and Schaafsma (1974) have discussed Rio Grande Style petroglyphs and rock paint- ings of the upper Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico, of the Zuni area, of the Little Colorado River area, and of the Glen Canyon area. The Schaafsmas propose that the Rio Grande Style is associated with kiva murals and ceramic decorations of the post-A.D. 1300 tO A.D. 1600 Pueblo IV-V culture and has continued into the his- toric period. Elements of the Rio Grande Style include masks in outline and masked an- thropomorphs similar to those described by Pilles (1975) for the Pueblo IV Style and identified as masks and katsinas in the present study. Schaafsma (1981) com- pares representations of the Rio Grande Style to Hopi katsina mask designs. Schaafsma (1980:289) observes that masks and other representations of the upper Rio Grande and those of the Little Colorado River and Glen Canyon areas are similar and proposes that the Rio Grande Style is found in the Western Pueblo area as well as in the Rio Grande area. There are, however, distinctions in subject mat- ter and themes that distinguish the Pueblo IV Style of the central Little Colorado River Valley from the more broadly defined Rio Grande Style. Such differences probably have regional and possibly temporal significance and are important to the study of the cultural process of Homol'ovi. The Pueblo IV Style generally lacks the highly stylized birds and quadrupeds of the Rio Grande Style as well as the more realistic anthropomorphs (Schaafsma 1975a:132-169, 1975b, 1980:255-283). Also, there is apparently a greater em- phasis on shields and shield-bearing figures and in blanketlike designs with masks above in the Rio Grande Style. Masks of the Pueblo IV Style are similar to those of the Rio Grande Style, although the Pueblo IV Style does not include extremely decorative masks such as those of the Tompiro and Tano provinces in New Mexico (Schaafsma 1980:260-274). The Rio Grande Style is viewed by Schaafsmas as representing a sharp break with earlier rock art related to the Anasazi of the Colorado Plateau. This contrasts with findings in the central Little Colorado River valley and at Homol'ovi where continuities of style with earlier rock art of the Colorado Plateau are noted above. Schaafsma (1975a) suggests that the Rio Grande Style reflects the presence of an associated religious movement of which the katsina cult is a part, and that masks and anthropomorphs have counterparts in modern Pueblo mythology and ceremony. Schaafsma and Schaafsma (1974) develop this subject and propose that the iconography of the Rio Grande Style provides archaeological evidence of the spread of the katsina cult and related sodalities, first to the Rio Grande and then to the Western Pueblos from the Jornada Mogollon after approximately A.D. 1300.</page><page sequence="15">Katsina Iconography 327 KATSINA ICONOGRAPHY IN HOMOL'OVI ROCK ART Mask and katsina representations that are structurally comparable to katsina iconography of the Hopi and Zuni described in this article have been identified in rock art located in the vicinity of Homol'ovi II and at a site in the vicinity of Homol'ovi IV. Examples of masks/katsinas are shown in Figures 6 and 7. The examples are details of masks and adjacent elements. The solid and stipple pecked masks are circular and rectangular forms with symbolism including facial fea- tures, bared teeth, and interior decorations (Figures 6, 7c-d). Headdresses includ- ing horns, a feather, and antennae are attached to masks shown in Figures 6b-d, 7a. Figure 7b shows an elaborate mask with triangular "rays" attached to three sides and other attachments including a rectangle and a wavy line. Katsina iconography in the vicinity of Homol'ovi II occurs near and on panels with earlier petroglyph forms (based on patination and style studies). In at least one instance, an outline mask apparently has been added to a group of earlier pet- roglyphs (Figure 7d) that are stylistically similar to rock art described by Pilles (1975) for the Pueblo III period. Generally, however, katsina iconography occurs in groups of what appear to be contemporaneous elements that are stylistically re- lated. Groups of masks on a single panel are common; groups of three to five masks are found in six locations in the vicinity of Homol'ovi II, and as many as nine masks are in a single general location near the top of the mesa upon which Homol'ovi II sits (Figures 6a and 6b show six of the nine masks). Possibly as many as seven masks that are eroded and difficult to see are on the walls of a small rock shelter in the vicinity of Homol'ovi II. The mask groupings at Homol'ovi may be symbolic of ritual associations be- tween certain katsinas and between socio-religious organizations active in the katsina cult. In a study of narrative qualities in Zuni rock art, Young (1985) re- ports that modern katsina masks are grouped and individually placed according to ritual associations evident in narrative traditions and in katsina ceremonies. By the use of techniques such as juxtaposition and superimposition, Zuni artists sym- bolize the traditional roles of katsinas. Groupings of katsina masks can, on another level, be interpreted as symbolizing relationships between various social groups that control the ceremonies and masks of katsinas. Material culture associations for katsina iconography in combination with dates for occupations at Homol'ovi II and Homol'ovi IV (see the introductory arti- cle to this volume by E. C. Adams) suggest that katsina iconography at the Homol'ovi site group dates from A.D. 1300 or slightly earlier to A.D. 1400, after which the sites were abandoned. These dates are consistent with dates prop- osed for rock art styles that include mask and katsina representations, the Pueblo IV Style dated A.D. 1300 to 1600 (Pilles 1975) and the Rio Grande Style, dated after A.D. 1300 into the historic period (Schaafsma 1975a, 1980).</page><page sequence="16">328 COLE Similarities between iconography of the Western Pueblo katsina cult and Homol'ovi petroglyphs are apparent and support theories concerning the presence of the cult at Homol'ovi. The accessibility of katsina iconography and the public exhibition of masks and katsinas in Homol'ovi rock art not only suggests that people from the Homol'ovi site group participated in activities of the katsina cult but that symbolism of the cult was widely recognized, especially in the vicinity of Homol'ovi II where most of the iconography occurs. Future research at Homol'ovi may offer additional information on the development of the katsina cult and its iconography as well as explanations for function and significance of Homol'ovi rock art.
