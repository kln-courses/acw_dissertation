Schaedel The frieze here shown in progressive stages of uncovering is on the west face of the Huaca del Dragon, an adobe pyramid of indubitable ceremonial character, about two kilometers north of Trujillo, Peru, and within a stone's throw of the Panamerican Highway. It is just outside the great east wall which marks the limits of Chan Chan, the largest prehistoric coastal city of South America. Work is still being carried on, and although the clearing of the outer walls has only begun, some ninety meters of frieze have now been uncovered, most of it with the original color preserved. The work is being done by ad- vanced students in archaeology of the Uni- versity of Trujillo. The age of this structure may be placed at approximately 1100-1200 A.D. (Center) Some attempt is made to appreciate the extent and depth of the frieze. Here we have an indication that it may be a fairly ambitious undertaking, but one with much promise. (Bottom) In order to discover the base of the wall and its decoration, a trench is. dug about a meter from the frieze. As the loose sand falls away from the relief, we begin to under- stand the elaborate composition. (The volute in the foreground is modern; in fact, it was executed by an artistically-minded enthusiast who participated in the excavation.) "As regards the word huaca (guaca), pro- nounced "waka," this is a Quechua word that has been adopted in all South American ar- chaeology. It originally meant a grave or sometimes a ceremonial site, and a native who digs graves for their content is called a hua- quero. However, the meaning of the word has been greatly extended so that today, in Peru at any rate, a single pre-Columbian pot- tery vessel is also known as a huaca ; I think this extension, of the term not scientifically acceptable." - J. A. M.</page><page sequence="2">The trench has been lengthened, and we are confronted with a series of new motives. On the extreme left is a rather corpulent anthropomorph. In the wide central panel, framed by a flattened arch, is a strange double-headed creature. The figure on the right appears to be a stylized dolphin. The damage done to the relief is largely the result of the occasional severe rains on the north coast of Peru. Toward the base the preservation is progressively better, thanks to its cover of wind-blown sand. In the facing picture the 74 ARCHAEOLOGY Later in the season the expedition was able to borrow a tractor for one day, and use it to pull the sand away from the south side of the Huaca del Dragon down to the original ground level.

Prolongation of the excavation to the right has revealed a second panel with similar motives, which suggests that such panels are continuous along the entire face of the pyramid. The frieze was once fully painted in bright colors, and at the base the original colors are well preserved. those of the west side and somewhat better preserved, wide panels alternating with nar- row panels, framed by attached piers, all represented in adobe. The two photographs presented here overlap at the center of one panel and show what remains of eight panels.</page></plain_text>
