<plain_text><page sequence="1">ART AND TERRITORIALITY IN THE LOWER PECOS ARCHAIC by Harry J. Shafer ABSTRACT The approximate prehistoric territorial limits of an Archaic belief system in the lower Pecos area of Texas is hypothesized on the basis of the geographic distribution of a distinctive pictograph style. It is proposed that these rock art localities functioned as ritual sites for a group of Archaic bands who shared a common ideology. This paper presents one aspect of a broader study which is being conducted of hunting and gathering adaptations in the lower Pecos River region of southwest Texas (Shafer, et al. 1975; Dering and Shafer ms.; Bryant and Shafer ms.). We have selected the lower Pecos region to study persistent hunting and gathering adaptations for several reasons, chief among them are the excellent preservation of certain kinds of archeological and botanical materials, the wealth of archeological data available through earlier works and the excellent and securely dated chronological (Epstein 1968; Johnson 1974; Ross 1965; Parsons 1965a; Dibble 1967; Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Sorrow 1968; Collins 1969; and Alexander 1970) and paleoenviron mental (Bryant 1969; 1975) frameworks which have been established. I am assuming that the material elements of the Lower Pecos Archaic are the behavioral products of a once viable cultural system. I feel that in order to analyze the Lower Pecos Archaic as a cultural system, it must be isolated in time and space. Once this is done, then the interrelationship of the components within the context of the cultural system can be investigated. *Paper presented at the symposium entitled "Prehistoric Adaptations in the Chihuahuan Desert," Society for American Archaeology Annual Meeting, Dallas. Beginning approximately 7000 B.C., popu lations having extractive technologies settled in the deeply entrenched canyons where the Pecos and Devil's Rivers enter the Rio Grande. These populations established a persistent cultural adaptation to a semi-arid environment that may have lasted virtually into historic times. The bow and arrow appears in the hunting technology about A.D. 800-1000 and may have marked an end to the conservative Archaic lifeway. Since there appear to have been other cultural changes taking place about this time (such as changes in pictographic style, possible increase in the use of upland resources, among others), I will use the introduction of the bow and arrow as a terminal date for the Lower Pecos Archaic. The temporal span of the Archaic conti nuum in the lower Pecos area is based on a securely dated chronology which emphasizes changes in projectile point styles, but is not altogether restricted to that kind of change. Other subtle chronological changes have been noted regarding minor shifts in certain aspects of the lithic technology (Epstein 1963; Collins 1974) and subsistence (Alexander 1970; 1974). The cultural sequence of the Lower Pecos Archaic has been divided into several periods based largely on changes in projectile point styles. Johnson (1964), for example, divides the sequence into three periods, early, middle and late. Story (1966) separates the Archaic into five periods; and more recently Collins (1974) divides the sequence into nine periods. Despite these apparently minor changes, one is indeed impressed with the persistent adaptation over several thousand years and is challenged to explain the uniformities rather than the fluctuations. 13</page><page sequence="2">/ aj^^^KET^ . sutton I TERRELL | ^% ( \ j j \v j ( VAL VERDE \^ \ Cfe, l o \ ^ \o \ EDWARDS V\ ^locAft^y2^-U ) / KINNEY ^^^^ / \ f LOWER PECOS AREA ^ VJ&gt; APPROXIMATE DISTRIBUTION OF PECOS RIVER STYLE ROCK ART Fig. 1. Approximate distribution of the Pecos River Style pictographs. The geographic boundary of the Lower Pecos Archaic may be provided for us by the people themselves. The distribution shown in Figure 1 of a distinctive pictographic style may literally represent a territorial map relative to the Lower Pecos Archaic of the Middle and Late periods in Johnson's sequence. This hypothesis is discussed in detail later. The Lower Pecos region has some of the richest rock art of the Archaic Period in North America. Most common and characteristic are the pictographic murals in the cave and rockshelter galleries (Fig. 2) (Jackson 1938; Kirkland 1939; Gebhard 1960; Grieder 1966; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967: 37-110). The most frequent pictographic style has been termed by Newcomb (in Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:37) as the Pecos River Style. Although Newcomb also describes a later Red Monochrome Style, I will limit my discussion to the Pecos River Style since it is demon strably pre-bow and arrow and therefor falls in the temporal range of the Lower Pecos Archaic as I am using the concept. The most outstanding motif of the Pecos River Style pictograph is that of costumed anthropomorphic figures often holding an atlatl (Fig. 3-5) (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:43). Newcomb (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967: Fig. 1) suggests that there is an evolution of this motif. Using super-position, stylistic comparison and association with other motifs he defines four periods within the Pecos River Style. One question always asked about the Pecos River Style is: how far back in time 14</page><page sequence="3">does it range? Newcomb (ibid: 41) addresses himself to this question, but fails to arrive at a satisfactory estimate. Grieder (1966) in his interpretation hints that the Pecos River Style (which he calls the Pecos Style) is older than 4500 B.C. Kelley (1974) guesses that they date between 500 B.C. and A.D. 600. Kirkland (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967: 41) notes in a shelter in Mile Canyon that approximately 4 feet of midden fill had accumulated since the painting of a Period 1 Pecos River Style figure. Although the shelter has since been virtually destroyed the relative antiquity of the paintings is clear. Another site reported to me in the Devil's River area has an undisturbed cultural deposit obliterating portions of a Pecos River Style pictograph (Hayden Whit sett, personal communication). Although I think Grieder's estimate is too old, the Pecos River Style pictographs could date to about 3500 B.C. when there was apparently a widespread and intensive use of the lower Pecos area and when other characteristic art forms were already estab lished. Interpreting the meaning of primitive art, particularly where the artists were members of an extinct cultural tradition, is virtually an impossible task. The meaning of the symbols depicted in what we regard as either realistic or abstract forms is lost; we can only hope that there were basic and underlying similari ties in art of non-literate cultures and that art served ends, common, though not necessarily universal, to all primitive societies. Newcomb (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:65-88) dis cussed various interpretations regarding the purpose and function of the Pecos River Style pictographs. In brief, these interpretations center on the anthropomorphic motifs and include: 1. God-of-the-chase surrounded by ani mals pierced with arrows (Kirkland 1939: 24). 2. Depictions of ordinary men masked and * *^^^m^m^m^m^m^m^m^m^m^m^m^m^m^m^m^m^Kt^ Fig. 2. Black Cave (41 W 76), A Pecos River Style rock art site. 15</page><page sequence="4">robed as gods or mythical beings (Newcomb in Kirkland and Newcomb 1967: 65). 3. Representations of shamans or perhaps members of medicine or dance societies (ibid.). 4. Hunting cult (Kelley 1950; 1974; H. C. Taylor 1949). 5. The pictographs were part of the activities carried out during rituals of an hypo thesized "mescal bean cult" (Campbell 1958; Newcomb in Kirkland and Newcomb 1967: 65-80). 6. The "shamans" were merely standard Pecos River Style figures representing fisher men and deer hunters (Grieder 1966). 7. The shamans were deities (Kelley 1974). Newcomb favored the shamanistic society hypothesis whereby the paintings were mechanisms used by shamans to visualize hallucinations or dreams possibly induced by mescal beans. Whatever the interpretations, Newcomb feels that their basic function was to influence and gain assistance from super natural powers. Assuming that common functions or purposes of art existed, I will advance some of my own thoughts regarding the Pecos River Style pictographs. The motifs represent abstractions of things that existed in the artists' world, either real or imagined. Even in imagined things, gods, ghosts, and demons are often characterized in primitive societies as having anthropomorphic or zoomorphic shapes (Muensterberger 1971). The anthro pomorphic figures could be either real or imagined, but like Newcomb I suspect that they were real. The activities indicated in the Pecos River Style are clearly those associated with masculine activities, particularly the acts of hunting. Archeologists who have experienced the job of removing and sorting the materials from dry caves of the area are usually impressed with the sheer amount of plant materials utilized by the Lower Pecos Archaic popula tions. Animal and fish remains, though present, do not seem to represent a major portion of the peoples' diet although the actual amount is certainly difficult to quantify. I would guess that hunting may have provided 15%, at most, of the total caloric intake. Gathering provided the major portion of the foods and probably some of the meat supply as well. On the basis of archeological findings from the dry caves we can predict that hunting was a high-risk, low-return activity and that gathering was a low-risk, high-return activity (cf. Lee 1968: 40). Assuming this to be true, and assuming that rituals are a means by which Archaic people tried to control things beyond their technological capability to control; then predictably the rituals and beliefs of the Archaic people would tend to emphasize the activities which had a higher risk and over which they had the least control. Hunting magic then would expectedly be emphasized in their mythology and other means of aesthetic expression. I disagree with J. Charles Kelley's (1974) recent interpretation that the Pecos River Style represents an artistic cult developed in response to cultural emanations originating in Mesoamerica. He believed that the lower Pecos area was an "island enclave" of dilute Mesoamerican culture, "developed by Chi chimecs far out in the Chichimec Sea under influence from the great civilization to the south" (Kelley 1974: 51, 52). Because of the sheer number of pictographs and high frequency of overpainting I cannot see how so many separate pictographs could be primitive attempts to copy ceremonial art elsewhere as he contends. My contention is that the Pecos River Style art was the visual representation of ideological concepts present in the Lower Pecos Archaic cultural system rather than visual representation of ideological concepts present in Mesoamerica. And like Newcomb, I believe that the function was to influence and gain assistance from supernatural powers. One may call them hunting cults or hunting shrines, but I think the pictographs represent the remnants of rituals conducted for the benefit of the residential group ? extended families or lineage bands or whatever. My hypothesis is that the Pecos River Style pictographs functioned as ritual sites which were associated with specific groups. The distribution of the Pecos River Style picto graphs may provide an unusually well documented territorial map of a group of Archaic bands who shared a common ideology. This might argue for a linguistically distinct population. The geographic range of the Pecos River Style is shown in Figure 1 and is used here as an approximate boundary of the Lower Pecos Archaic. The reason I am suggesting that this 16</page><page sequence="5">IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIhsIhII^LHHH ^I^^I^I^I^HEB^V^IiflKJHBiw JpHIJilG^&gt; ? ^ *1^bbbbbbbbIH n^BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBVsiwiYi^ iii^i^R^iw^ w - i^J^JIbbbbbbbbbbbbbI ^^^^RI^HE^kbbbbbbbb^^ CXl^S X^iHnHBSyi bbbbbbbbbbbbbbKbbkbHbib^bE^^ bbbbbbbbbbbbb^%^H*^b ;bMb^bbbbbbbbb^b^bbMbMbbIbb^bmbb?bb^^ bbbbbb9Ibbbbbbb^bbbbbbbb1buI^bbbbbbbbHH ^Kl^^9tKBmSK^m^^BK^^ bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbHbbV Fig. 3.

Territorial ranges were main tained by indegenous Indians of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas (Griffen 1969; Ruecking 1955). 17</page><page sequence="6">According to Lee and DeVore (1968: 11) hunters and gatherers generally lived in small groups. Each local group was associated with a geographical range but ranges did not function as closed systems. Furthermore, ritual sites were commonly associated with specific groups. Movements within the territories by the hunting and gathering groups were probably dictated largely on the basis of resource distribution such as game or seasonal maturation of certain plant foods. Small groups, however, usually stay near the place where the individuals were born except in cases where either the males or females are exchanged between bands; and even here the ties between such bands would be quite close. I am generalizing here ? perhaps more than I should be ? but the point is that the home range of individual bands usually centers around one or more vital resources. In the lower Pecos area, the resources include water, firewood, certain plants (sotol, lechuguilla, prickly pear cactus, acorns), deer, Fig. 4.

Attempts to find evidence for seasonal occupation or seasonal movements in our analysis of dry cave materials have not succeeded (Dering and Shafer 1976). It seems that the larger rockshelters were sometimes occupied during all four seasons, perhaps during an entire year. The territory or distribution of the Pecos River Style rock art sites may indicate the area of most intensive utilization by the Archaic bands centering about the confluence of the Pecos and Devil's Rivers with the Rio Grande. The "territorial range" should not be viewed as fixed for it undoubtedly fluctuated in response to variables such as population increase or decrease and cycles of poor resource regeneration such as during pro longed droughts. Tindale (1972: 236) des cribes an interesting example of territorial behavior among the Pitjandjara, a desert hunter-gatherer group of Australia. Their territorial boundaries occur where resources are not sufficient to sustain life for long periods of time. Using the Pitjandjara exam ple, we would not expect the Pecos River Style rock art sites to occur in areas where resources would be inadequate to sustain lengthy occupation. Indeed, these sites seem to be restricted to the proximity of well watered regions and absent in areas where available surface water is either limited or absent such as in Sanderson Canyon (Shafer 1970). The association of rock art sites to localities containing vital resources such as water has yet to be thoroughly examined but our preliminary indications are that a signifi cant correlation will exist. Another possible test for the territorial hypothesis is in examining the distribution of other cultural items such as the design styles of the painted stream worn pebbles (Daven port and Chelf 1941; Parsons 1965b; n.d.). The designs on these objects will predictably show a very limited distribution. This follows two assumptions; one is that primitive art is characteristically geographically restricted and is long lasting or tradition bound. 19</page><page sequence="8">Secondly, primitive art is a form of communi cation and the distribution of its styles reflect communicative dialects. There are other material items whose stylistic distribution seems to mirror that of the Pecos River Style pictographic sites. These include certain basketry techniques (James Adovasio, personal communication) and sandal styles (Glenna Williams-Dean 1975, personal communication). Not all material items show this restricted distribution and one would not expect the entire material culture assemblage to be separate from those in adjacent territories where the adaptations were similar and whose boundaries undoubt edly either overlapped from time to time or became partially or wholly absorbed in time. Also, items showing similar geographic distribution may have functioned in either the same or related behavioral sets while those showing more widespread distributions pro bably functioned in quite different behavioral categories. In sum, the hypothesis has been presented that the Pecos River Style pictograph sites in the lower Pecos area of Texas and adjacent portions of Mexico functioned as ritual sites for groups of hunters and gatherers and that the distribution of these sites is indicative of the territorial range of specific and related groups, perhaps linguistically related. The hypothesis holds considerable merit when both the role and function of art in primitive societies and the intra- and intergroup behavior of hunter-gatherer populations are considered. If we now assume that the pictographic sites do approximate the area most intensively utilized by related groups of prehistoric hunters and gatherers, then the archeologist is provided with an excellent opportunity to examine something that is most difficult to discern elsewhere; the workings of a prehistoric cultural system within its own geographic boundaries.
