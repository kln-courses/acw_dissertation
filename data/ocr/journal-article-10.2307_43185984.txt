<plain_text><page sequence="1">BEES, ANTS, AND THE BODY POLITIC: VERGIL'S NORIC PLAGUE AND OVID'S ORIGIN OF THE MYRMIDONS Hunter H. Gardner Perhaps the most striking feature of Vergil's Noric plague in Georgics 3 is the sympathetic response it has evoked in its readers, despite the fact that its devastation is confined largely to livestock, in a region fairly remote from Rome.1 While the value of his treatment and its potential as a metaphor for the human condition have been frequently remarked, most critics agree that, unlike representations of the fifth-century Athenian plague in Thucydides and Lucretius, Vergils account is a fiction with no historical counterpart in antiquity.2 1 would like to offer an understanding of why the Georgics poet engaged in this particular imaginative experiment, and look to Ovids reading of Vergils plague in Metamorphoses 7 as a key to that understanding. Vergils treatment of the Noric cattle plague in Georgics 3 ends with hints of the diseases impact on the human community, but the problems of contagion in Book 3 are extended and resolved, in some readings, by the bougonia of Book 4, in which bees, also beset by disease, 1 Various critics, especially those following Harrison (1979), have understood Vergils depiction of plague as something foreign and applicable to Romes enemies; cf. Foster (1988, 33), who stresses the "topical urgency" of the passage, and its representation of Alpine tribes recently subdued by Octavian. Thomas (1988, 129-30) suggests that Vergils geographic sketch locating the plague northeast of Italy brings the disaster close to home. On the plagues implication tor the human condition, see, e.g., Liebeschuetz 1965, 73-77; Putnam 1979, 215-35; Thomas 1988, 131; cf. Mynors 1990, 251. Servius (at G. 3.487) thought that Vergils account described an outbreak of the same fifth- century plague that afflicted the Athenians. Harrison summarizes the prevailing opinions on the historicity of Vergils plague and offers convincing evidence against those few critics who view the poet as describing what was an actual event in Noricum. See also Thomas 1988, 129. Vergilius 60 (2014) 3-31</page><page sequence="2">4 - Hunter H. Gardner are miraculously restored (Otis 1995, 188).3 These readings diverge from interpretations, especially those of Thomas and Ross, that stress the impractical and fantastical nature of the bougonia , a custom that "has no place in the real world of the Italian farmer" and thus "cannot stand as the solution to the problems of man and beast in the world of labor" (Thomas 1988, 196; cf. 1982, 84-85; Ross 1987, 215-17). As Perkell has noted, the process of killing a calf in order to produce bees is not a resurrection (the former hive is irretrievably lost), but is, rather, "an exchange of death for life" (1978, 219). Vergil leaves his readers to question whether the exchange will prove useful (the new hive likened to summer showers, 4.312-13) or destructive (the hive likened to Parthian arrows, 4.313-14). I argue that we may usefully look to Ovid's Metamorphoses to find one answer to the contested significance that surrounds the bougonia in the Georgics. Ovid's conclusion to the plague that devastates the Aegineans (Met. 7.490-660), namely, a population born from ants, may be understood as a commentary on the destruction and equivocal restoration that define the path of disease in the Georgicsy and one that underlines the impossibility of such a restoration when the connotations of disease among animal populations are transferred to the post-Actian world of Roman citizens in which Vergil and Ovid were writing. Ovid, who came of age long after the dust at Actium had settled and experienced more of the Augustan reconstruction, emphatically demonstrates that the bougoniay as a model for recovery from civil war, will not work: the thoughtless homogeneity of the new hive requires people to be something that they are not- beings without prior histories, loyalties, and family entanglements that complicate, but ultimately enrich the human experience. In the following, I offer a close reading of Vergil's Norie plague that demonstrates the poeťs dependence on a metaphoric relationship between plague and civil war. My discussion foregrounds the language of liquefaction, dissolution of identity, and golden-age eradication of the labores that define the life of the farmer as conditions of pestilence in Georgics 3. 1 then locate similar language in Oviďs account of plague and its fantastical resolution, a new population born from ants. These militantly uniform citizens of Aegina 3 Cf. Gale (2000, 111), who suggests that "the bougonia acts as a kind of answer to the problem of pain and suffering raised at the end of book 3 and, less explicitly, throughout the poem." Morgan (1999) views the answer of the bougonia as a hopeful one, while not denying the violence that the practice relies upon; cf. Miles 1980, esp. 254. Thibodeau (201 1, 192) resists commenting on the tone that surrounds the closure of Book 4 and concedes that "there is no indication that the ritual was a regular part of Mediterranean life"; rather, the bougonia , as a kind of marvel that charms readers, functions usefully within Vergil's larger didactic program.</page><page sequence="3">Bees, Ants, and the Body Politic - 5 will in turn allow us to see more clearly how Vergils ox-born bees of the fourth Geòrgie , if upheld as a solution to the devastation wrought by plague in Book 3, are untenable as a model for Roman recovery. While the accounts of both Vergil and Ovid are indebted to Lucretius and Thucydides, the two Augustan treatments are shaped by the specific concerns of a citizen body embarking on a process of recovery under what would be known as the Augustan Principáte. As an expression of those common concerns we will find that both accounts rely on imagery of golden- age plenitude, imagery that intersects provocatively with contemporary poetic and political discourses;4 while that imagery is inverted to dystopic rather than eutopic effect, it should be read within the larger set of signifiers that spoke of the potential of a revived Golden Age under the new ordo. Complementing the bizarre plenitude of the Golden Age, an age defined by the lack of an organizing social hierarchy,5 both poets use language describing the physical dissolution of the body under the assault of plague (G. 3.482-85; Met. 7.538-51): such language- used in a discursive context that readily equates human and animal corpora with larger civic bodies6- has the capacity to address friction within social units (from familial to communal to imperial) that characterizes a population at war with itself. The conclusion of the third Geòrgie does not bode well for the prospects of human communities faced with the challenge of containing and recovering from the contagion of civil war. The poet defers his vision of renewal until Book 4, where he presents a strikingly uniform hive born from the liquefied remains of a calf: the resulting monstrum (G. 4.554) suggests that something novel will issue from the homogenized rot of disease, but the utility of that monstrum depends upon limiting distinctions and sharply curtailing difference among members of the community. Thus the value of an ox-born hive as an answer to disease remains open to question - a question Ovid answers in his response to Vergils bougonia. 4 For observation of the plagues golden-age characteristics in Vergil, see Harrison (1979, 20-21), who views the Golden Age in the third Géorgie as a response to Horaces Epode 16. See also Ross 1987, 182-83; Perkell 1989, 119-23; Nappa 2005, 152-58; cf. Putnam 1979, 227. The Golden Age as a symbol revived and manipulated by the Augustan Principáte has been extensively treated; see esp. Zanker 1990, 167-92 and Galinsky 1996, 93-140. 5 As Perkell notes (2002, 20), the Golden Ages characteristic lack of social hierarchy is a distinct innovation of the Roman poets. 6 For corpus as an indication of the body politic, see Cic. Off. 1.85, Liv. 26.16.9, and Tac. Hist. 1.16. For the application of medical metaphors among Latin historians in discussion of the body politic, see Woodman 2009.</page><page sequence="4">6 - Hunter H. Gardner Ovid revives Vergils golden-age imagery to suggest the cataclysmic scale of plague in Aegina and charts a similar course of contagion that collapses the bodys distinctions into liquefied homogeneity. The ant-born Myrmidons, whose uniformity and shared ideals match those of the Geòrgie apian community, function in the narrative above all as an answer to the call to war issued by the Athenian king Aegeus. By repopulating Aegina with a group of iuventas available for military service {Met. 7.515), Ovid reflects on the uniquely Augustan concern of creating a generation of loyalists in the aftermath of civil war. The fact that such citizens in Ovids Metamorphoses function above all to supply a new round of troops for yet another war suggests that Ovid interprets Vergil's hive more as Parthian arrows than generative summer showers. The uniformity of the Myrmidons and their impossible existence as men without histories, and initially without personal identities, problematizes the bougonia as a solution to the loss of individual lives: by explicitly finding answers {signa, 7.621) to the problem of the Aeginean plague, where Vergils seer fails to divine a solution to the Norie one (G. 3.491), Ovid subtly chastises his predecessor- vates for equivocating on the possibility and desirability of the new Augustan ordo. I. PESTILENCE AND CIVIL WAR IN VERGIL'S GEORGICS When in the Aeneid Vergil has Venus plaintively describe the sufferings at Troy as a "plague of war" {pestis belli , 10.55) the poet draws on a metaphorical kinship that physical contagion and war have shared since nosos first afflicted the camp of the Achaeans at the start of the Western literary tradition {II. 1.11). lhe two forces become especially allied in Thucydides' account of the disease that erupts in Athens during the Peloponnesian War, an account adapted by Lucretius in his De Rerum Natura 7 Both Thucydides and Lucretius foreground social pathologies, especially alienation from fellow citizens and neglect of relatives or, conversely, a selfless plunge into sites of contagion (Thuc. 2.51; Lucr. 6.1238-46), 8 that amplify the plagues connotations not only of war in general, but of civil war in particular. Pestis , frequently translated as "plague" {OLD 2), and its compounds regularly appear in late Republican literature, especially Ciceros orations and letters, with reference to Romes internal discord: the statesman describes Catiline's 7 Cf. Parry's (1969, 115) insightful reading of Thucydides poeticizing treatment of plague: "The Plague is a pathos, and it is equated with the War." Recognizing the broader metaphoric potential of disease in antiquity, scholars have more recently posited links between representations of plague elsewhere in Athenian literature and political destabilization of the fifth century (e.g., Mitchell-Boyask 2008; Padel 1992). 8 Following Smiths (1992) text of Lucretius.</page><page sequence="5">Bees, Ants, and the Body Politic - 7 ascent as a disease that has beset the body politic (Cic. Sull. 76), while he refers to the impending conflict ( bellum ) between Caesar and Pompey as "plague-bearing" ( pestifer ; Att. 8.14.2, 9.13.3). The later Philippics configure Antony as pestis to Romes well being ( Phil 8.15; cf. 5.43). Livys Ab Urbe Condita forces a similar slippage between real and metaphorical disease suffered by the body politic in positing early outbreaks of contagion besetting the fledgling state in close proximity to his narrative of the struggle between political ordinēs (3.32; 4.20-21, 25, 52; 6.20 et passim).9 It is within this discursive context that Vergil prompts readers of the Georgics to search for common ground between the many natural disasters experienced by the farmer and Roman civic disasters (Miles 1980, 234). The civic disaster that looms largest in the poem is Romes internal discord: the poets initial digression on Roman civil war is echoed on two occasions as similar conflicts are played out by heavily anthropomorphized oxen and bees (cf. 1.466-514; 3.215-36; 4.67-87). One of my goals here is to demonstrate that Vergil, relying on the familiar contamination of plague discourse with the discourse of war, asks his readers to reimagine the natural disaster that besets the Noricans, as an especially virulent pestis (3.472), in terms of Rome s most devastating civic disaster, the civil wars that Rome experienced in the years prior to the publication of the poem. Vergil begins his treatment of disease with the promised revelation of symptoms (or "signs") and causes (te causas et signa docebo , 3.440). The transition from manageable conditions (e.g., scabies , 3.441-54) to the kind of pestis that threatens the whole flock, and is only remedied through slaughter, is subtle. Discussion of topical diseases shifts to less easily marked behavioral changes, listlessness and lack of appetite, signs of communicable disease in livestock who must be slaughtered "before sinister contagion creeps through the unprotected flock" ( priusquam/diraper incautum serpant contagia vulgus , 3.468-69). In fact the serpentine movement of contagion is rapidly revised on an apocalyptic scale (G. 3.470-73): non tam creber agens hiemem ruit aequore turbo, quam multae pecudum pestes, nec singula morbi corpora corripiunt, sed tota aestiva repente, spemque gregemque simul cunctamque ab origine gentem. 9 A full account of the language of war, civil strife and contagion is beyond the scope of this project, though the TLL provides useful starting points for the metaphorical applications of pestis and pestilentia (esp. vol. 10.1, 1928.29-1930.58; see similar entries for pestifer, esp. 1921.37-51). Morbus (G. 3. 39 7, 504, 532 et passim) and contagium , used at G. 3.469 and Eel. 1.50 (discussed further below) are also used in late Republican literature in contexts of civil discord (Sal. Cat. 36.5; Hor. Ep. 16.61).</page><page sequence="6">8 - Hunter H. Gardner Not with such intensity does the whirlwind driving on winter storms rush from the sea as do the many diseases of cattle. Nor do diseases seize upon bodies one by one, but suddenly [seize] the summer s whole brood, and the hope and herd together with the race from its origins. The poets interest in the promise or "hope" of the flock extends back to the first Eclogue , where Meliboeus, displaced after land confiscations following civil discord, presumably that at Philippi (DeVeau 1935, 2-5), laments the loss of two newborn goats ( spem gregisy 1.15). In reckoning Tityrus relative good fortune at having found lands and libertas , he marvels over his interlocutor s freedom from both foreign pastures and contagion from neighboring flocks ( nec mala vicini pectoris contagia laedent , 50), blights he himself by implication must now suffer. This constellation of concerns, which upholds contagion and the eradication of a lineage as satellites of civil strife, is more clearly manifested in the Georgics. Ab origine at G. 3.473 echoes the poets claims at the opening of Book 3 that he will one day sing the exploits of Caesar ( Tithoni prima quot abest ab origine Caesar , 3.48), a reminiscence that sets in sharp contrast the poets power to individualize, shaping the figure of the statesman as he sings his exploits, with the power of disease to eradicate distinctions. Vergil will use the particular collocation of gens with ab origine on only two other occasions, the first of which occurs earlier in Book 3, where the noble lineage of a racehorse should be no excuse for his failings in old age (G. 3. 122). 10 The plagues power to eradicate an entire future, herd, and "race from its origins" is more closely invoked in the Aeneid , to describe Didos illustrious ancestry: per tot dueta viros antiqua ab origine gentis ( Aen . 1.642). Aeneas and his men behold metalworks that narrate the accomplishments of Didos predecessors, "beginning from the ancient origin of the race through so many heroes." Where the language in the Aeneid refers to a human desire to distinguish the self through representation of great accomplishments, gens ab origine in the Georgics demonstrates the plagues power to eradicate life without respect for distinctions of birth, class, or race. Here is one of the first signals in the narrative that Vergils plague functions to dissolve distinctions between discrete corpora , reduce them to a kind of primordial sludge, nec singula corripiunt ("not one by one do diseases take hold of bodies"). Turning from the general topic of the effects of disease on the gens , the poet illustrates the power of contagion through an account of the Norie 10 As Putnam (1979, 219) notes, this echo along with other verbal reminiscences from the Georgics that celebrate lineage are now viewed through a darker lens, a process that "draw[s] man and beast to the same indistinguishable, obliterating level."</page><page sequence="7">Bees, Ants, and the Body Politic - 9 plague, which he initiates with a truncated and elliptical reference to cause. Vergil remarks on the lack of uniformity that defined the initial symptoms ( nec ... simplex) of the epidemic, and, to elaborate, he describes a violently contradictory movement, from fiery parching thirst that shrinks the limbs to an excessive fluvidus liquor that causes the bones to dissolve minutatim , "little by little" (G. 3.478-85): hie quondam morbo caeli miseranda coorta est tempestas totoque autumni incanduit aestu et genus omne neci pecudum dědit, omne ferarum, corrupitque lacus, infecit pabula tabo. nec via mortis erat simplex; sed ubi ignea venis omnibus acta sitis miseros adduxerat artus, rursus abundabat fluvidus liquor omniaque in se ossa minutatim morbo conlapsa trahebat. Here once arose a season pitiable for the diseased atmosphere and throughout all the seething of autumn it glowed white hot and gave over every kind of beast to death, and every [kind of] wild animal, and it got hold of the lakes and stained the food supply with decay. Nor was there a uniform path to death; but when a fiery thirst driven throughout all the veins shriveled the wretched limbs, again a dissolving liquid flowed in excess and absorbed all the bones little by little toppled with disease. As Harrison notes (1979, 8), liquefaction is Vergils innovation, a "fresh horror all his own," and a "clinical paradox" not mentioned by Lucretius as a symptom of the Athenian plague. The language of the bodys distinct members ( miseros artus) under threat from the corrosive power of disease ( tabum ) may be Lucretian, though Vergil has taken what Lucretius predicted as the eventual condition of the body after death by the plague ( tabes ; Lucr. 6.1201) and made a similar putrid matter, associated with decay, the cause of a disease whose symptoms culminate in the dissolution of the body.11 What is difficult to convey with the tabum- stained fodder in the Georgias , particularly in English that wishes to locate in the word a source of contagion and impose a sequence 11 Described by the OLD as "a viscous fluid consisting of putrid matter" (s.v. 1). There is perhaps inevitable slippage in Vergil's use of tabum. Is it the disease itself or the process by which the disease is spread? English uses of "contagion" suffer similar imprecision.</page><page sequence="8">10 - Hunter H. Gardner on the spread of disease,12 is the etymological link between Vergils term and its relatives, not only the Lucretian tabes , but also the verbs derived from it (like tabere and tabesco , which Ovid will make use of): these refer primarily to the processes of physical wasting as well as the putrid matter and fluids that result from such a process (OLD tabes 1-3), nuances that will become especially pronounced when Vergil revisits the term at the end of his plague narrative (3.557). Inscribing a circular course to govern the progress of plague, Vergil gestures toward liquefaction as both the cause and the result of the epidemic, while also emphasizing the violent oppositions that accompany such a process. Despite this frustratingly opaque account of the plagues origin and dissemination, scholars have identified in Georgics 3 a standard structure of "narrating the plague" established in medical treatises and also evident in Thucydides and Lucretius (Farrell 1991, 84): aetiology, symptomatology, and epidemiology.13 After establishing the internal symptoms of the disease, now referred to as a morbus , Vergil spends the remainder of his account attending to epidemiology: he describes a failed sacrifice that looks forward to further devastation (486-493); he then remarks on generally erratic behavior among the flocks and herds, especially the malaise of a formerly proud racehorse and a foolhardy attempt to cure the disease by administering wine, which results in a macabre form of self- cannibalism (495-514); in this section the poet draws an especially poignant portrait of a dying bull (515- 30). From here, he describes how humans must step in to labor over those religious and agricultural duties formerly performed by animals (531-36). Widespread destruction among animal species continues, even to marine life (537-45); medical efforts, those practiced by well-known mythological healers, resoundingly fail, and the fury Tisiphone is left free reign over Noricum (546-58). It is only in closing that the third Geòrgie looks to the plagues manifestation among the human populace: the plagues efficiency is startling as it quickly seizes upon those who try on animal skins; in a kind of 12 Fairclough/Goold (1999, 211) translate tabum as "venom"; Wilkinson suppresses the force of the noun behind the verb ( infecit)y rendered as a participle: "it killed, infecting pools, contaminating fodder" (1982, 115); Ferry (2005, 131) adopts a similar strategy: "the lakes were all infected, the pastures poisoned." Lewis (1963, 70) renders as "blight" ("put a blight on their fodder"); cf. Jermyn (1947, 66), who translates, "infecting with disease even the hay." 13 Vergil's variations on the symptoms given in Lucretius indicate that he consulted some medical treatises independently of Lucretius; see Farrell 1991, 85. A similar structure governs plague narratives in contemporary film and novels, though Stephen Soderberghs recent film Contagion (2011) is noteworthy for positioning revelation of the source of contagion (a strain of birdflu) conspicuously at the end of the film.</page><page sequence="9">Bees, Ants, and the Body Politic - 1 1 closure that promises to undo itself, Vergils plague leaves a sacer ignis eating away at human limbs (artus, 566), recalling the very sitis ignea that wasted the limbs of livestock at the start of the account (482-83). But, before this nonending, lets return to the beginning. Vergils description of a failed sacrifice is the first human response to the plague, and it is one that orients us to view - from the perspective of a perplexed sacerdos , later referred to as a vatesy a term with particular literary resonance during the Augustan era14 - the suffering experienced by a sacrificial calf, from whom only a meager ( ieiuna ) trickle of fluid ( sanies ) stains the sand (3.489-93). As Thomas notes (1988, 132-33), the passage confounds any attempt to see a consistently productive alignment between proper religious observance and the success of human labor.15 This is no human failing, and the passage offers a chilling reminder of the limits of human cultus of the gods. Moreover, if we are inclined to see the Augustan poet behind this particular vates , the passage speaks to his reticence or even impotence to divine, interpret, and correct the plight of contagion ( nec responsa potest consultus redder e vates , 3.491). One way of making sense out of the widespread disaster that ensues in Georgics 3 is to frame it in eschatological terms: readers of Georgics 1 observe a teleology of human progress, as ars is developed and implicitly limited. In particular, the famous theodicy of Jupiter explains certain threats to human welfare, such as the serpent, that serve to necessitate the progress of civilization (G. 1.121-46). Where Book 1 signals the end of the Golden Age by having the farmer pick up the plough and assume its difficult but productive labores , here in Book 3 the arator abandons his plough and beholds various adynata ("impossibilities"), the marvelous denial of threatening animal behaviors, which suggest that this plague ridden world has returned to a perversion of the Golden Age. As birds and sea creatures abandon their natural habitats (541-43; 546-47), predatory animals (wolves and dogs, 537, 540) no longer stalk their accustomed prey (sheep and deer, 14 On the Augustan resonance of the term and the role of the vates in this passage, see Newman (1967, 26-28), who stresses the interpreters lack of culpability in the disaster. 15 Contra Harrison (1979), who argues that the role of the gods is critical to understanding Vergils plague. See also Farrell (1991, 94), whose analysis of Vergils oppositio in imitando of Lucretius in the passage suggests a "view of religion ... as grim and dissatisfied as anything in De Rerum Natura Liebeschuetz (1965, 75-77) also stresses the absence of any role assigned to the gods in the plague, reflecting their general disinterest in human affairs. Cf. Gale (1991, 424): "... in the face of such calamities, no certainty is possible, and all one can do is continue to Venerate the gods' with no guarantee of success."</page><page sequence="10">12 - Hunter H. Gardner 537, 539). An eerie peace ensues, though it is a tranquility achieved through death rather than concord. Most strikingly, the snake that metaphorically ushers in contagion ( serpant , G. 3.469) will die out, the clearest possible evocation of the Golden Age (Thomas 1988, 142). Additionally, the suffering of cattle and other infected species is juxtaposed with those markers of abundance and satiety that characterize a primitive golden-age existence: hinc laetis vituli vulgo moriuntur in herbis/ et dulcís animas plena adpraesepia reddunt (3.494-95, "from here calves die everywhere amidst thriving grass and they give up their sweet spirits before full troughs"). Evocation of the Golden Age here is of course problematic - for a feeding trough to be full, some farmer had to fill it. But the bounty of the passage does point to a world that no longer needs improbus labor. This kind of plenty is revived after a poignant description of a bull and his f rater collapsing at the plough: in such circumstances, "shade of lofty groves fails to please, as do soft meadows and cool rivers" ( non umbrae altorum nemorum , non mollia possunt/ prata movere animum , 520-21). The world is restored to a condition where the earth seems to provide all things nullo poscente ("with no one demanding," 1.128) - quite possibly because there is no one left to demand. Vergils inversion of the Golden Age has the effect of undoing the cultural progress that was achieved in the theodicy of Jupiter in Book 1, where the upside of harsh labor was the productivity of human arts. If the original theodicy prompted humankinds gradual distinction from and dominance over the natural world, the plague has the effect- as Gale (1991, 418; cf. 2000, 127-8) and others note - of erasing the hard won boundaries between human and animal.16 This erasure of distinctions is observed most readily in the description of human devotees of Juno who must pull their own cart to perform worship of the goddess; other humans are reduced to tilling their own fields, scraping the hard earth with their fingernails. The moral implications of this reversion to a golden-age existence are problematic; as Perkell notes, "[h]ere, although without technology, man does not attain a new innocence, but a new barbarism. ... The poet has taken up conventional Golden Age features in successive isolation and permutation and finely revealed thereby what is absent- a spark of willed mutuality and illumined purpose" (1989, 123). That sense of collective purpose will emerge later in the Georgias , in the aftermath of a similar disaster, but remains conspicuously absent from Vergils account of suffering in Book 3. 16 Liebeschuetz (1965) suggests that parallels between humans and animals in Vergil evolve primarily from the poets observations of their fundamental similarities. Thomas (1988, 141) notes of line 536, 4 now man takes on the image of the beast"</page><page sequence="11">Bees, Ants, and the Body Politic - 13 At the very moment where Vergil's disease in Noricum is undoing the divisions between human and animal corpora , the poet also inserts a reminder of the distinctions, here familial and fraternal, that govern human relationships (G. 3.515-19): ecce autem duro fumans sub vomere taurus concidit et mixtum spumis vomit ore cruorem extremosque ciet gemitus. it tristis arator maerentem abiungens fraterna morte iuvencum, atque opere in medio defixa reliquit aratra. Behold the bull, seething under the hard plough, falls and spews forth blood mixed with foam and stirs up his final groans. The disheartened farmer, separating the grieving bull from his dying brother, goes and abandons his plough left stuck in middle of its task. Vergil capitalizes on the so-called pathetic fallacy here to draw our attention to a crisis that can be readily converted into human terms. I would suggest here that we are prompted to take an even further step at this juncture and convert the sufferings of disease into those of civil war.17 Though the adjective fraternus is found only here in the poem, three of the five uses of frater in the Georgics come at the end of Book 2, 18 where the speaker famously praises the life of th e felix arator , who lives far from the civil strife that plagues Rome and the "discord driving on faithless brothers" (flexit et infidos agitans discordia fratres, 496). 19 The happy farmer does not seek the urbs (Rome), unlike the nameless wretch, hie , who betrays country and kinsmen for wealth (G. 2.505-12): hie petit excidiis urbem miserosque penates, ut gemma bibat et Sarrano dormiat ostro; 17 The passage just prior to that describing the death of the taurus is also, as Putnam observes (1979, 223), suggestive of civil war: the self- cannibalism inflicted by the sick and maddened horse reflects a "diseased self-destruction of the body politic" that "can readily be understood as an allegory for deadly civil strife in which brother maims brother." 18 Fratres in Book 1 (G. 1.280) refer to the giants of myth who attacked heaven and placed Olympus on top of Ossa and Pelion; and to Phoebus, brother of Luna/Diana (G. 1.396). 19 Mynors (1990, 169-70) finds the reference to civil strife misplaced here in light of its recap in line 510, though concedes its possibility and cites parallels for this kind of discordia ( Eel 1.71; G. 2.459, 4.68, and esp. Aeri. 6.608, invisi fratres).</page><page sequence="12">14 - Hunter H. Gardner condit opes alius defossoque incubât auro, hic stupet attonitus rostris, hunc plausum hiantem per cuneos geminatus enim plebisque patrumque corripuit; guadent perfusi sanguine fratrum, exsilioque domos et dulcia limina mutant atque alio patriam quaerunt sub sole iacentem. This one sets upon his city and his wretched household gods with destruction, as he drinks from a jeweled cup and sleeps on Tyrian purple; another stores away wealth and hovers over buried gold. This one is stupefied, thunderstruck at the rostra; doubled applause through the theater- for it comes from both the plebs and the patres- has seized this one, gaping; those splattered with the blood of a brother rejoice, and they exchange their homes and sweet thresholds for exile and seek a fatherland lying under another sun. If we have missed Vergils emphasis on a distinctly internal- indeed fraternal- strife that seizes upon ( corripuit ) Rome, we will be reminded of just how well-woven civil discord is into the fabric of Roman tradition: happy as those quasi-golden-age farmers are at the end of Book 2, their plenitude is bound by Remus and hi sfrater who preside over it (G. 2.533), the latter of whom is destined to commit Romes foundational act of civic bloodshed. I offer this digression on the second Géorgie s closing vision as evidence that we cannot read this reference to a brothers death in Book 3 without brushing up against the political context in which fraternal bonds have been articulated thus far in the poem. Over and against the recognition of kinship and its role in shaping the individual, the methodology of the Norie plague, after initially instigating conflict within the body, resolves itself in a brutal but systematic eradication of difference. The end result of this process is the obliteration of personal identity and interpersonal relationships among heaps of cadavera. The conclusion of Book 3 uses a decidedly Lucretian term, catervatim (Lucr. 6.1144), for piling up corpses in the stables, an echo of the Lucretian term for breaking things down used earlier, minutatim (Thomas 1988, 144), that suggests a ruthlessly systematic process of deterioration: iamque catervatim dat stragem atque ipsis in stabulis turpi dilapsa cadavera tabo, donee humo tegere ac foveis abscondere discunt ... (3.556-58).</page><page sequence="13">Bees, Ants, and the Body Politic - 15 And now she [Tisiphone] piles up in heaps and even in the stables themselves bodies decayed with foul putrescence, until they at last learn to cover the corpses with earth and hide them in trenches. Here lies the only lesson learned by the Norie farmer from the plague, the proper disposal of bodies. And it is a trope repeatedly performed in plague dramaturgy: the burial of the dead- abbreviated, along with all those other hallmarks of individualism - is written into accounts of contagion from Thucydides in the fifth century to Camus' account of the dispensaries in plague besieged Oran, constantly burning and grimly haunted with echoes of Nazi crematoria. Vergils closure, hiding bodies under layers of earth, is never complete, but instead issues a new (and yet strangely familiar) narrative of plagues effects on the human community. Here we have the repetitive strand of contagion fragmenting without any foreseeable telos - precisely what Lucretius has left us with, whether intentionally or not.20 Vergil will resume disease and finally allow its closure in a morbus (G. 4.318) that afflicts the apian community of Book 4 and a new hive born from the bougonia. But for the moment we are left lingering, poised for the worst- case scenario. Vergils plague has dramatized the dissolution of discrete corpora and, through imagery that alludes to the unbound satiety of the Golden Age, orchestrated a collapse of those Iron Age structures in which both civic and individual corpora had traditionally found a home. II. CONTAGION AND RECOVERY IN METAMORPHOSES 7 While Aristaeus successful creation of a new hive of bees is critical to my interpretation of the Norie plague - a monstrum (G. 4.554) I shall return to in discussing Ovids Myrmidons - it is also a very delayed gratification, which we cannot foresee the first time we conclude Georgics 3. Ovid offers us a very different kind of closure to his own plague in Metamorphoses 7. He responds to the (failed) closure sewn into the poems of his predecessors in a way that makes plague mean something rather different in its context. The solution to pestilence at Aegina, humans born from ants, while acknowledging the power of plague to eradicate distinction through contagion and death, suggests a uniformity to its living, human populace that cannot be achieved outside the fantastical realm of the poem. Given the 20 Müller (1978, 218) has argued that the devastation of the plague in De Rerum Natura is an appropriate ending for a poem that articulates eternal processes of growth and decline. Various critics have followed suit and offered additional reasons for defending the poems ending; cf. Clay 1983, 250-66; Segal 1990, 228-37; and esp. Fowler 1997.</page><page sequence="14">16 - Hunter H. Gardner longstanding association between plague and war, it is not surprising that Ovid would embed his plague in a context of war. The poets innovation is to resolve the metaphorical tension between them in a way that produces bodies uniformly hardy and free from disease, but also ready for another round of military service. While his account of the plague draws from all three major predecessors, I will focus primarily on those passages where Ovid engages with Vergils Norie plague, since I am interested in how the Metamorphoses poet responds to the problem presented by contagion in the Georgics. The narrative impulse behind Ovids treatment are two questions implicitly posed by Cephalus, who seeks military aid from the Aeginians led by King Aeacus: why are all these young men I see here of the same age ( tarn par aetate iuventus , 7.514)? And where are all those other fine fellows Fd met on a previous visit (7.515-16)? In response, Aeacus describes the initial onset of the plague sent by Juno and various failed attempts to treat it through medical arts (523-27); he reports the origins of the disease, muddling divine causation with atmospheric contaminants that taint the water supply (528-35); the georgic section of the plague follows, with Aeacus account of its effects on livestock and wildlife (536-51). It is only after the disease has afflicted the human population that we are given an account of the symptoms of the plague, along with the social pathologies surrounding those who suffer from it (552-581); Aeacus then offers a more tightly focalized narrative of his own reaction to the plague and his attempts to placate the gods through a botched sacrifice (582-605). The kings general lament for the unburied dead is followed by an imprecation to his father Jupiter, who sends omens in the form of thunder, a swarm of ants filing up a nearby oak tree, and a dream of ants metamorphosed into young men the following evening (606-42); the next morning Aeacus awakes to find that a new population has miraculously replaced the old one (643-54). Aeacus' immediate assurance to Cephalus of a happy outcome ( melior fortuna secuta est , 7.518) alleviates the dramatic tension that characterizes earlier plague narratives and has perhaps influenced some faintly unappreciative readings of the episode, which fault the poets sacrifice of pathos and humanity at the altar of literary artifice (Galinsky 1975, 117- 26).21 Scholars also point to Ovids models for the birth of the Myrmidons: Hyginus and Apollodorus offer various traditions about their birth to replace the eradicated population of Aegina. Ovid agrees with Hyginus in 21 Cf. Anderson (1972, 299), for whom Ovids plague is a lues poetica, lacking the pathos and gravity of its predecessors, a "melodramatic" episode that "exercises no hold on the audiences emotions."</page><page sequence="15">Bees, Ants, and the Body Politic - 17 attributing the cause of the eradication to the wrath of Juno, who sends a snake to poison the water supply, though it is only in Ovid that Junos snake is multiplied by thousands and triggers a plague.22 Ovids narrator initially refers to the disease as a dira lues : dira lues irapopulis Iunonis iniquae / incidit exosae dictas a paelice terras ("a grim plague befell the people because of the anger of unjust Juno, who hated the land named for [Jupiters] mistress," 7.523-24). Dira lues is high epic diction (contra morbus and pestis in Vergils Georgias) and Ovid will call attention to his use of it later in Metamorphoses 15 (626), as he offers an account of Aesculapius entrance into Rome after the city suffers its own devastating plague. The rarity of the word in the poem, used only on these two occasions and both times with dira, makes its applications to Rome and Aegina, and the resultant link between the two cities, all the more pronounced. The resonance of a new (if floundering) Rome in lues may be further strengthened by the context of the word in the Aeneid (3.139; 7.354): in the first of only two uses in the poem, Aeneas and his men suffer a lues et letifer annus ("a plague and a death bearing year"), just as the epic hero is trying to lay down roots and establish a settlement, a new Pergamům in Crete.23 The epic uses of lues may be consistent with the role of divinity in the poem, which Lucretius denies and Vergil suppresses in the Georgics , but Ovid ultimately restores: Junos role is asserted rather than hinted, and the illness, creeping serpent-like among the Geòrgie poets unsuspecting flocks, is literalized into thousands of serpents swarming through the islands uncultivated fields (7.533-35): constat et in fontes Vitium venisse lacusque, miliaque incultos serpentum multa per agros errasse atque suis fluvios temerasse venenis. It is established that the vitium 24 came into our springs and pools, and that many thousands of serpents wandered through uncultivated fields and violated our rivers with their poisons. 22 Börner (1976, 331) notes the origins of story in Hesiod (frag. 205 M-W); he also cites Strabo, who mentions and discredits the plague variation of the story. 23 In other words, the catastrophe that interrupts the founding of a new Troy in the Aeneid parallels the one that destroys and ultimately restores a settlement of Aegineans in the Metamorphoses. The only other use of lues in the Aeneid occurs at 7.354, where Allecto's possession of Amata is described as a lues ( ac dum prima lues udo sublapsa veneno). 24 Börner (1976, 337) glosses as "poison" ("das Gift"), but remarks that this use, which normally implies a kind of moral or religious failing, is unique in the tradition</page><page sequence="16">18 - Hunter H. Gardner Since Ovid has staged the first part of his plague, its effects on livestock, in a very georgic landscape, we might ask why he describes these fields- at the very moment the plague is let loose- as inculti ? Anderson (1972, 300) explains the adjective as the natural result of farmers too sick to till them, but this explanation seems forced in light of the fact that Ovid has not yet described the effects of the disease on the human population. Principio at line 528, followed by primo at 536, confines the initial stages of the disease (described as a subitus morbus 7.537) to the animal kingdom and implies a clear sequence dictating that, as in the Georgics , animals fall prey to the disease before humans do. Ovid may wish for us to think sequentially about two conditions (onset of plague, failed cultivation of the fields) described simultaneously, but I would argue that, by referring to fields as incultu Aeacus is signaling the same inversion of the natural order that defines the Golden Age: uncultivated fields are named first and foremost as a condition that Jupiter transforms in Vergils Georgic theodicy (G. 1.121-25; cf. Eel. 4.29); so too is untilled earth characteristic of Ovid s aurea aetas in the Metamorphoses ([tellus] rastroque intacta nec ullis/ saucia vomeribus , 1.101-2).25 Intensifying the atmosphere of golden-age upheaval, the suffering of Ovids animals, depicted in a manner reminiscent of calamity in Georgics 3, leaves the unlucky farmer to marvel (7.536-51): strage canum primo volucrumque oviumque bovumque inque feris subiti deprensa potentia morbi, concidere infelix validos miratur arator inter opus tauros medioque recumbere sulco; lanigeris gregibus balatus dantibus aegros sponte sua lanaeque cadunt et corpora tabent; acer equus quondam magnaeque in pulvere famae degenerát palmas veterumque oblitus honorum ad praesepe gemit leto moriturus inerti; non aper irasci meminit, non fidere cursu of plague narratives; cf. Galinsky 1975, 1 17, "baleful infection." We may wish to view it as analogous to Vergil's tabum , though Ovid s term, frequently used to describe defects of procedure or character ( OLD vitium , s.v. 4-7), has a much stronger moral nuance. 5 As James O'Hara has pointed out ( per litteras) there may also be a parallel with Catullus' evocation of a golden-age setting for the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, during which occasion farming is abandoned and "no one cultivates the fields" ( rura colit nemo , 64.38). This poem implies a similar correlation between the end of the Golden Age and subsequent Heroic Age and the onset of civic, specifically fraternal, strife (64.397-408).</page><page sequence="17">Bees, Ants, and the Body Politic - 19 cerva nec armentis incurrere fortibus ursi. omnia languor habet: silvisque agrisque viisque corpora foeda iacent, vitiantur odoribus aurae. mira loquor: non illa canes avidaeque volucres, non cani tetigere lupi; dilapsa liquescunt, adflatuque nocent et agunt contagia late. At first, in a heap of dogs and birds and sheep and oxen and among the wild beasts, the power of the sudden disease took hold. The unhappy farmer marvels as the strong bull collapses in mid-task and falls backward in the middle of the furrow; from the wool-wearing flocks who give forth mournful bleating the wool falls off of its own accord and their bodies waste away. The horse once fierce and greatly renowned in the race course disgraces the victory palm and, forgetful of his old honors, he groans, about to perish in an ignoble death at the stall. The boar does not remember how to rage; nor the stag to trust in his speed or the bears to attack the strong herds. Listlessness holds everything. Diseased bodies lie in the woods and fields and roads, the air is poisoned by the stench. Allow me to speak of marvels: neither the dogs nor the greedy birds nor the gray wolves touched them. Bodies decay and dissolve into liquid. They do harm with their stench and spread the contagion far and wide. Again we confront the absence of animals (bear and boar; wolves, dogs, and greedy birds) that threaten the farmer and his flocks. The labor of the farmer in happier times might be considerably lightened were all sheep able to sheer themselves. The phrase sua sponte is not a rarity, but in this agricultural context it echoes the golden-age rural life described at the end of Georgias 2 (501; Mack 1978, 28), as well as the miraculously color- converted sheep of the fourth Eclogue (4.42-45); it also echoes (in diction as well as prosody) the condition that initially defines Ovids aurea aetas : aurea prima sata est aetasy quae vindice nullo ,/ sponte sua, sine lege fidem rectumque colebat (Met. 1.89-90, "the first age sown was golden, which of its own accord, and with no need for a defender, kept faith and did the right thing"). Like Vergil, Ovid uses golden-age imagery to indicate a fundamental shift in the order of things. These signals can predict a return to golden-age pleasance, seriously modified, as in the Eclogues , or, as in Georgics 3, indicate a complete collapse of humanity's finely orchestrated dominance over nature. As heaps of bodies are piled on one another, Ovid turns insistently to the end of the third Geòrgie , where stragis (G. 3.556) also</page><page sequence="18">20 - Hunter H. Gardner marked the heaps of rotting corpses that the Noricans learn to bury in the single advantage forged from this catastrophe. Commenting on Ovid s interest in rotting corpses, Anderson (1972, 302) remarks, "Lucretius and Ihucydides leave the details to our imagination; Ovids delight in the grotesque encourages us to spell them out." Few would deny that Ovid delights in the grotesque, but is there also a Vergilian motivation lurking behind the trope of dissolving bodies, corpora that will be miraculously reconstituted by the end of the narrative? We might observe that in line 541 the decay experienced by the bodies of sheep ( tabent ) was written under the influence of Vergils tabum. As Börner (1976, 338) notes, Ovid uses tabere only here, though its relative tabum , as we have seen, is a word that shows up twice in Vergils plague.26 There again it is used to describe the kind of putrefaction (G. 3.481 and 557) and decomposition that infect the remaining population of livestock. In a similar gesture, Ovid subjects his animal corpora to utter collapse that leaves all remains liquefied ( dilapsa liquescunt, 550). It is the corrosive power of disease that Ovid finds most salient in the Georgics , in which carcasses are also left dilapsa after having experienced liquefaction (fluvidus liquor , G. 3.484) as a symptom of the Norie cattle plague. Ovid relies on Geòrgie vocabulary throughout the passage,27 making his divergences from Vergil in narrating the responses of subjects within the agricultural tableau all the more pronounced. By having both bulls die at once Ovid omits the familial connection, the loss of a brother, sympathetically invoked in Vergils original (Mynors 1990, 254). Instead, the poet is able to reveal from the perspective of our human eyewitness, Aeacus, the plagues power to disrupt the social order. Ovid thus continues to engage Vergils third Georgicy especially its focus on fractured familial bonds, long after the plague has redirected its wrath from animal to human victims. In describing the plagues effects upon the human population within the city walls, the speaker indulges with relative restraint in symptomatology, drawn from accounts of the Athenian plague, and is equally demure in naming the social dysfunction that characterizes the citizen body of Aegina. But what Aeacus does dramatize, aside from a raging thirst that leads to reckless 26 Less rare in Ovid, but related to tabeo , is tabesco , used by the poet in the speech of Pythagoras in Metamorphoses 15, to explain how new forms grow from decayed bodies ( nonne vides , quaecumque mora fluidové calore/ corpora tabuerint , in parva ammalia verti ? 15.362-63). The bougonia serves as a primary illustration of this phenomenon (15.365-67). 27 Cf. concidere, arator, tauros, opus , and medioquey parallels cited by Vallillee (1960, 109).</page><page sequence="19">Bees, Ants, and the Body Politic - 21 contamination of the water supply, is the individuals alienation from his own home (Met. 7.574-76): corpora devolvunt in humum fugiuntque penates quisque suos, sua cuique domus funesta videtur, et quia causa latet, locus est in crimine parvus. They roll their bodies onto the earth and each one flees his own household gods, and to each one his own house seems deadly and, because the cause lay hidden, the confined place is held to blame. The flight from ones own penates is Ovid s invention, one that hints at divine displeasure (Anderson 1972, 304). In light of the very Roman, perhaps Augustan (Met. 15.864), nature of these household deities, it is rather odd to find them lurking in this very Greek context, unless we are supposed to be thinking of Rome, or even of the corrupt and divided Romans at the end of Georgics 2, where Vergil used the betrayal of city and "wretched household gods" (miseros penates , 2.505) to mark the collapse of the Roman social order. As the very homes that shape human identity are considered suspect (in crimine ), the plague marches relentlessly among the populace and increases its dehumanizing effects, to the extent where the only simile in Aeacus' account reduces people to rotting fruit and fallen acorns (Met. 7.584-86): quo se cumque acies oculorum flexerat, illic vulgus erat stratum, veluti cum putria motis poma cadunt ramis agitataque ilice glandes. Wherever I bent my line of vision, there the crowd was scattered in heaps, just as when rotten fruit falls from disturbed branches, or acorns fall from the shaken ilex. While Ovid has reserved graphic decomposition for the afflicted livestock, his sense of the grotesque impinges here on the human bodies now likened to rotting fruit (putria poma), thus recalling the rotting warps (putris telas ) that threaten the Noricans at the end of the third Geòrgie. While the putrescence of the fruit alone would convey the physical condition of the bodies, Ovid adds another term to the comparison, acorns scattered from the shaken ilex. Glandes exist as a slippery place marker in Vergils Georgics , since they provided a sufficient diet for the inhabitants of the Golden Age (G. 1.147-48), but are also what the hungry Iron Age dweller will seek out</page><page sequence="20">22 - Hunter H. Gardner in the absence of a productive farm (G. 1.159). Ovid s invocation of acorns here amidst the rapidly decomposing population of Aegina evokes both the pleasance of the Golden Age and the harsh reality of its end.28 Aeacus then rehumanizes the anonymous heaps of plague victims by invoking the language of familial bonds as he makes a sacrifice on behalf of himself, his patria, and his three sons (Met. 7.596-97). This turn in the narrative allows Ovid to engage once again with Vergils account of the Norie plague. In lines 593-601 the Metamorphoses poet returns to the Vergilian context of sacrifice and reminds us of the sacerdos-vates figure who fails to make meaning out of the disease that has beset the Noricans. For Ovid the plagues corrosive effect on the entrails ( exta ) of a bull makes it impossible to interpret the notae and monitus deorum (Met. 7.600, "the marks and warnings of the gods"). Ovid may be replicating here Vergils resistance to assign a fixed meaning to the Norie plague. Without clear cause or remedy, readers of Georgics 3 are left wondering what makes a (civic) body diseased and what is the best way of restoring its health.29 Ovid observes the studied indeterminacy of his predecessor and forces determinacy upon him. He corrects the open-ended spread of contagion in the Georgics by allowing Jupiter to restore meaning and grant closure to a troubled populous: a few lines after the cryptically failed examination of entrails, the god inspires Aeacus' confidence by offering him one of the very notae denied earlier in the sacrifice (ille notam fulgore dédit , as well a sfelicia signa , 7.620-21). Jupiter solves Aeacus problem in a way that resonates with the Augustan prerogative of restoring and controlling a citizen body.30 While 28 Vergils theodicy scatters acorns from a quercus (G. 1.159), linked with the woods of Dodona, sacred to Jupiter (G. 1.8, 1.149). In Ovids own Golden Age in the Metamorphosis , glandes are produced from the "tree of love" (Met. 1.106), but the poet caps his vision of the aurea aetas spontaneously generative earth with the verdant ilex- this time a source of honey (Met. 1.112), that other golden-age staple (flavaque de viridi stillabant ilice mella). On this point I am influenced by Perkell (2002, 11), who argues that ambivalence surrounding Vergils Golden Age throughout his oeuvre performs a similar interrogative function, and that the questions it prompts (e.g., what makes an age "golden"?) "tend to cluster around moral values centrally implicated in Augustan imperial ideology." 30 Suetonius (DA 34) and Cassius Dio (54.16-56; cf. Propertius 2.7) both report Augustus' attempt to curb sexual license and bolster the birthrate among the upper classes with his marriage legislation, though the exact dates and character of the laws remains a matter of debate. In his discussion of Vergils bees, Nadeau (1984, 79) notes that the asexual character of bees in Vergils fourth Geòrgie may have a similar resonance with what would become Augustus' marriage legislation, though the publication of the poem predates any known attempt to pass such measures.</page><page sequence="21">Bees, Ants, and the Body Politic - 23 the king initially expresses a wish to have his own people restored ( meos ) or to join them in death (7.618), he changes his request after observing an orderly, in fact militant ( agmen ), troop of ants filing up Jupiters sacred quercus (7.622-26). Rather than conduct an ongoing lament for departed individuals, friends, and family, Aeacus demands a fresh supply of loyalists to equal the number of ants he spies: totidem , pater optime, ...tu mihi da cives et inania moenia supplel (7.682, "Give me, highest father, just as many citizens and fill up my empty walls!"). Where Vergils plague effectively blurs the line between humans and animals as it melts away differences and reverses human cultural progress, Ovid ingeniously wipes the slate clean, filling emptied walls with citizen bodies miraculously elevated from the insect population. But the solution to Aeacus problem cannot, outside the world of the Metamorphoses, serve as an answer to the question of a war- depleted population or fill the desire for a collectively loyal citizen body. People are constituted by the histories that shape them and grant them unique identities, no matter how uniform a governing power wishes them to be. III. BEES AND ANTS These ant-born citizen bodies of Aegina are usefully similar in their habits. As Aeacus reports his dream from the previous night he emphasizes their corpora and mores , as well as the process by which a new population has replaced the old (Met. 7.650-58): . . . egredior, qualesque in imagine somni visus eram vidisse viros, ex ordine tales adspicio noscoque: adeunt regemque salutant. vota Iovi solvo populisque recentibus urbem partior et vacuos priscis cultoribus agros Myrmidonasque voco nec origine nomina fraudo. corpora vidisti: mores, quos ante gerebant, nunc quoque habent; parcum genus est patiensque laborum quaesitique tenax et quod quaesita reservet. hi te ad bella pares annis animisque sequentur. I go outside and I look upon and recognize in order men such as those I had seen in my dream: they approach and greet their king. I pay my vows to Jupiter and diwy up among the new population the city and the fields left empty by the former inhabitants, and I call them Myrmidons; nor do I lie about their origins from the name. You've seen their bodies.</page><page sequence="22">24 - Hunter H. Gardner They have the same habits as those they carried on before: they're a thrifty sort and enduring of hard work and they cling to gain, storing away for keeps what they've gained. These fellows, equal in years and courage, will follow you to war. . . . Aeacus promptly distributes lands left vacant by their old inhabitants among the new citizens, who are above all thrifty, hardworking, and productive, if a tad eager to hold on to what they have produced. A tidy ring structuring the episode brings us back to the startling equality that defines the youth of Aegina (Anderson 1972, 311). Where the Vergilian vates fails to divine a remedy for the Norie plague in Georgics 3, Ovid's Aeacus is granted one that reflects on the loyal and acquisitive insect population born from the bougonia , both its practical value (new population of single-minded citizens) and its impracticality as a model for human existence. At the beginning of the fourth Geòrgie , following immediately on the heels of the plague, Vergil introduces his topic, honey and the bees that produce it, a "marvelous spectacle of a tiny world" ( admiranda levium speetaeula rerum , G. 4.3). The role of Vergil's anthropomorphic bees and their relationship to the Roman people has been thoughtfully discussed;31 Jasper Griffin (1979) in particular has highlighted certain un-Roman, as well as inhuman qualities of the bees, despite the many advantages of their collective, communal existence ( omnibus una quies operumy labor omnibus usus , 4.184). Neville Morley has more recently compared Vergil's depictions of bees with other ancient observations on the behavior of bees within the hive and concludes that, "Vergil's account is thus a less realizable model and more an image of unattainable peace and simplicity ... if only human society could be managed like a beehive" (2007, 464). He notes a problematic failure of the analogy linking bees to humans, the fact that humans do not have a beekeeper to resolve their internal conflicts. Yet the ancient understanding of bees is more ambiguous, both in the fourth Geòrgie and throughout the tradition of Greco-Roman lore on insect kingdoms. The uniformity of these diminutive creatures exists in distinct tension with some individualizing characteristics, a tension dramatized through the conflict that flares up between the rightful or "better" ( melior , 4.92) king of the hive and his rogue 31 Herrmann (1931) argued for a specific correspondence between the bees of the fourth Geòrgie and the participants of Actium. Following that lead, Nadeau (1984, 67) has interpreted the bougonia as a symbol of the brutality and bloodshed of the civil wars leading up to Actium. Other critics have taken a more generalizing approach to the parallels between human beings and Vergil's bees; see, e.g., Otis 1995, reprint of 1964, 181-90; Johnston 1980, 90-105; Thomas 1982, 70-92; Ross 1987, 207-14; Habinek 1990, 210-12.</page><page sequence="23">Bees, Ants, and the Body Politic - 25 adversary (ille horridus alter , 4.93). Thus, if uniformity and a collective spirit are the bees' most striking qualities, Vergil tempers those qualities with occasional hints of self-serving individualism. On the one hand, the apian community shares the rewards of its excep- tional labor (4.155-57): et patriam solae et certos novere penates, venturaeque hiemis memores aestate laborem experiuntur et in medium quaesita reponunt They alone know a fatherland and fixed gods of the hearth (penates), and mindful of the coming winter they tend to their work in the summer, and they put aside for the common store what they have gained. Unfailingly loyal in recognizing the unity of household gods and fatherland, the bees assume such golden-age harmony that some critics have viewed them as emblematic of a modified, "agriculturally oriented" Golden Race (cf. G. 1.127, in medium quaerebant).32 On the other hand, they also exhibit an innate "love of gain" ( amor habendi, G. 4.177), the very greed that is coupled with the madness of war in the Aeneid and, according to Evander, marks the decline from Saturn's Golden Age in Italy ( Aen . 8.327; Perkell 2002, 27; O'Hara 2007, 101). The bees mentioned in the Aeneid assume a similarly ambiguous guise: their collective spirit is implicitly praised as reflecting Carthaginian prosperity (Aen. 1.430-36), but the role of a "sudden swarm" (examen subitum) of bees as prophetically signaling to Latinus the arrival of the Trojan agmen is hardly benign (Aen. 7.64-70), at least from the native Italian perspective. Ovid, as one vates interpreting the evolution of Vergil's bees in the Georgics and Aeneid, recognizes the fraught nature of the equation between an apian community and a new Roman population, however acquisitive, loyal, and homogenous that population may be: these are the qualities that above all define his Myrmidons, a new citizen body posed as one solution to the illness that afflicts the Aegineans. At the same time, such qualities, in human beings at least, could emerge only from a population created de novo, without a past and lacking individuality, without those personal histories that give us our identity, but also give us loyalties, affiliations, and occasionally enemies. 32è More precisely, Johnston (1980, esp. 104-5) views the poets emphasis on cattle in Book 3 and bees in Book 4 as working together to prescribe a Golden Race (the bees) based on an agricultural existence (symbolized by cattle).</page><page sequence="24">26 - Hunter H. Gardner So too the miracle of the bougonia is presented with some skepticism by the Georgias poet after he broaches the topic of the hives destruction (G. 4.281-85; cf. Thomas 1988, 196; Ross 1987, 218). Born originally in exotic Egypt, the practice may be gradually Romanized in the course of the epyllion,33 but it remains a monstrum that relies immediately on the death of a single calf, whose body must maintain a perverse kind of integrity, orifices blocked and hide unbroken, throughout its brutal destruction ( huic geminae nares et spiritus oris multa reluctanti obstruitur ; per integram ... pellam , 301-2): the resultant creation is a marvel of striking uniformity, whether militant and destructive (as Parthian arrows, 313) or generative and docile (as summer showers, 312, or grape clusters, 558) in its cohesion. This procedure, described prior to the Aristaeus epillyon, varies significantly from that performed by Aristaeus at the end of the poem in atonement for the deaths of Orpheus and Eurydice. The sickness and hunger that strike Aristaeus' bees do so to the destruction of the entire hive (amissis ... apibus morboque fameque , 4.318), leaving the mythological founder of the bougonia at a loss and, like Aeacus, imprecating his divine parent for aid (G. 4.320-32). After learning Proteus' account of Orpheus loss of Eurydice and ultimate failure to resurrect her, Cyrene directs her son to undertake the bloodletting of four exceptional bulls and an equal number of heifers ( quattour eximios ... tauros/ totidem ... iuvencas , 538- 40) rather than to preserve the unbroken hide of a single calf, leaving us to ponder a discrepancy in the cost of life that fuels the regenerative process. At the same time, it is worth noting that both procedures victimize the very creature, albeit at different stages of development, whose loss of a brother has earned our sympathies in Book 3 s Norie plague. Moreover, the processes of dissolution that begets the new hive in both descriptions of the practice are strikingly similar. Like the processes of contagion in Ovid and Vergil, the bougonia relies on flesh putrefied and liquefied into an unrecognizable heap; from this heap a new race is born: solvuntur viscera ... linquunt , G. 4.302-3; liquefacta boum per viscera , G. 4.555. 34 33 On Vergils sources for the bougonia , see Habinek (1990, 209, 220). Habinek concedes the initially exotic nature of the practice, but parts company with Ross and Thomas in viewing the final presentation of the bougonia as a sacrifice; for Habinek, Vergil has Romanized the practice and allowed it to function as a "unifying and re- creative social phenomenon" (215). Cf. also Thomas' (1991) response to Habinek, where the author argues against viewing the ritual at the end of the poem in sacrificial terms; he rightly notes that the only proper sacrifice in the poem is that of the Noricans in Book 3. 34 Thomas (1988, 200) remarks on the similar phrasing used to describe the effects of plague (3.484-85) and the disintegrating entrails of the calf.</page><page sequence="25">Bees, Ants, and the Body Politic - 27 The turn in Aristaeus narrative that takes us from devastating illness, imprecation of divine parent, and restoration of an insect-born race is enough to suggest that Ovid is thinking of the fourth Geòrgie in his account of the Myrmidons. The Metamorphoses poets substitution of ants for bees, moreover, should not surprise readers of Vergils Aeneid , which likens proto- Romans alternatingly to rapacious ants, as they industriously prepare to depart from the shores of Carthage (4.401-7), and then to bees, whose gentle summer buzzing describes those souls about to be born into the stream of Roman history (6.706-9). As noted above, and striking a more ominous key, bees in the form of a prophetic swarm will also signal the arrival of Trojans in Latium (7.64-70). While extended treatment of Vergils bee and ant similes is beyond the scope of this paper,35 it is hardly presumptuous to suggest that Ovids ants resonate with a poetics in the Aeneid that links Romans to insect-communities, a link whose fullest implications are only felt by tracing those communities to the disease- stricken hives of Georgics 4. The foregoing focus on a golden-age collapse of boundaries and a uniformity that depends upon destruction and decay, evident from Vergils Norie plague as well as Ovids Aeginean one, allows us to understand how Ovid revives, resolves, and interprets the path of disease in the Georgics. I now oifer in conclusion some brief remarks about what Ovid and Vergil may be doing with their stories of contagion in light of what we might call general symptoms of plague discourse. Since Homers Iliad pestilence has served as a metaphor for describing a community at odds with itself, whose deep-seated conflicts initiate a process of self-destruction. René Girard has described representations of plague as "... a process of undiiferentiation, a destruction of specificities . . . social hierarchies are first transgressed, then abolished.... The distinctiveness of plague is that it ultimately destroys all forms of distinctiveness" (1974, 833-34; cf. Cooke 2009, 10-11). While physical homogeneity, a leveling in death, ultimately results from an epidemic, that leveling is often preceded by discord within the body, suggestive of conflict within the larger population over limited resources and violent attempts to distinguish the self.36 Pestilence works primarily through a process of replication, creating sick, but identical, subjects whose similar goals, privileged claims to truth and authority, result in a kind of rivalry among doubles within the community - a competition for 35 Bee similes in Vergil have been treated recently by Polleichtner (2005), who draws especially from the observations of Austin (1955, 1971, 1977) and Briggs (1974 and 1981). Girards primary example of this is Raskolnikov's dream of an epidemic in Crime and Punishment where, "each thought he alone had the truth and . . . could not agree what to consider evil and what good" (cited in Girard 1974, 835).</page><page sequence="26">28 - Hunter H. Gardner distinction among limited distinctions that ironically collapses in sameness. This point is made more salient by Susan Sontag s influential essay on Illness as Metaphor (1978, repr. 1988), where she accounts for tuberculosis and cancer, often postulated as outward reflections of complex internal passions, as diseases that award a kind of distinction to their victims. Such complexity is posited in contrast to the dehumanizing and homogenizing effects of plague: pestilence afflicts and to some degree defines a community without respect for distinctions among individuals who comprise it: epidemics "simplify a complex self, reduce it to a sick environment" (3 7).37 Both Roman treatments of contagion discussed here invoke a link between human and civic corpora , and stage the dissolution of boundaries, the collapsing of distinctions, within and between corpora as the most dramatic physical manifestation of the plague. Interpreted within the Roman historical context, accounts of plague in these two poets appear to offer an evolution of responses to the breakdown of an aristocratically governed Roman res publica in the mid-first century BCE. For members of the aristocracy operating within a social structure built upon limited access to gloria and the status that accompanies it, competition for the same honors has the cumulative, ironic effect of eradicating distinctions.38 The logical endpoint of such internal discord is the transformation of fiercely defended boundaries (and the privileges secured by those boundaries) into a single unrecognizable heap. Vergil, pondering various steps forward after Actium had left much of the aristocracy dead or contaminated with loyalty to the losing side, offers the symbolic potential of plague and bougonia as one way of addressing recovery and reconstitution of stabilized government: the liquefied remains of a calf replicate the deteriorative processes of contagion while suggesting that, from the resultant uniformity, a solution to the problem of civil war might be gleaned, that rivalries might be redirected toward a common goal. Ovid observes with the vantage of hindsight how a new citizenry was emerging under the Augustan Principáte: his doubtful comment on this population in the Metamorphoses is best expressed through the perfunctory manner in which the lingering apocalyptic vision that marks the third Geòrgie is corrected and given a kind of forced closure. Where Vergil only with difficulty wrests a dying yoke-make from his brother, leaving readers 37 See also Patricia Wald (2008), whose recent study of contagion in (esp.) popular culture highlights the power of an epidemic to configure communities through narratives of the spread, communicability, and containment of a given pathogen. 38 What Girard (1974, 838-39) terms gradus or "Degree," an indicator of status contested as discord erupts within a community, spawning contention for supremacy among pairs of adversaries he describes as "mimetic doubles."</page><page sequence="27">Bees, Ants, and the Body Politic - 29 to wonder whether the collective purpose instilled in the solution of the bougonia is worth its cost to the individual, Ovids miraculously restored Aegineans, lacking the personal history that complicates human lives and loyalties, implicitly underscore the impossibility of an entirely new order.39 University of South Carolina gardnehh@mailbox.sc.edu 39 I would like to thank James O'Hara, Christine Perkell, and the journal's anonymous readers for their various insights and encouragement.
