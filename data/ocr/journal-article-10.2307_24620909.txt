<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Manuscript Collections of Medieval Medical Miniatures and Texts LOREN MACKINNEY* and THOMAS HERNDON* Several years ago, Miss Gertrude Annan, Librarian of the New York Academy of Medicine, published a revealing survey of rare medical books in American medical libraries.1 Although her concern was incunabula and other rare books, she mentioned outstanding manuscript holdings, such as the Edwin Smith Sur gical Papyrus at the New York Academy of Medicine and the Paneth Codex at the Yale Medical Library. It is the wealth of medical texts and miniatures in medieval manuscripts now on this side of the Atlantic which leads us to present a survey of American holdings in this field. The survey is merely a summary of the final part of our card listing of "Medical Miniatures in Medieval Manu scripts in Europe and America." In two summers of search in American centers as far distant as Seattle, Los Angeles, Birming ham, and Montreal, we have seen many medical manuscripts, a considerable number of which contain medical miniatures. Among these manuscripts are not only those listed in the original Seymour de Ricci and W. J. Wilson Census of Mediaeval and Renaissance Manuscripts in the United States and Canada (1935), but also those recently acquired items listed in the files for the forthcoming Supplement, which is being compiled by Dr. W. B. Bond and his assistants at Harvard University. Restricting ourselves for the most part to Western manuscripts prior to 1500 in date, we present the data from illustrated manu scripts by library-location, first the libraries of the Eastern coastal region, where there is the greatest concentration of manuscripts, then those of the Midwest, the Pacific Coast, and the South. We give brief descriptions of all illustrated manuscripts (also notable medical illustrations in non-medical manuscripts) ; the texts in illustrated and unillustrated manuscripts are given separately in an alphabetical listing. The term "medical" we interpret broadly to include materia medica, pharmacy, anatomy, surgery, obstetrics, orthopedics, etc. We also include encyclopedic works such as Bartholomaeus Anglicus, De proprietatibus rerum, because of • University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. l "Outstanding acquisitions of rare books m medical libraries of the United States in the last decade."

Single stray leaves are omitted unless they contain noteworthy medical data.2 A. Libraries by Location with Descriptions of Illustrated Manuscripts LOREN MACKINNEY In Washington, D. C. the rare book room of the Library of Congress has a number of manuscripts, none of which is illustrated.8 The Freer Gallery of Art has several detached folios of Islamic medical miniatures. Among these are eight folios from a well known thirteenth-century Arabic Dioscorides.4 Six of the scenes are pharmaceutical (Freer numbers 32,20; 32,21; 32,22; 38,1; 43,2-a &amp; b) ; the other two pictures depict Erasistratos with an assistant (no. 47,5) and a mad dog biting a man (no. 53,91). One other miniature at the Freer Gallery (no. 30,76), brought to my atten tion by Curator Richard Ettinghausen, is a unique example of a medical apparatus—an automatic device for measuring the amount of blood extracted in a cupping operation. It comes from a Mesopotamian Arabic manuscript of the year 1315. Our final item from Washington collections is at the Folger Shakespeare Library. In a beautifully illustrated and decorated manuscript is the diploma of a doctor of medicine and philosophy, awarded by the University of Padua to Honophrius of Foligno in 1550, with a licence to practise in Foligno, dated 1547 (C., p. 284, no. 89.1) .5 2 The travel involved in our survey was made possible by a grant from the University of North Carolina Research Council. In our listing of manuscripts we give in parenthesis after each item the shelf number in the local catalogue (if any), and the original Census number, or the forthcoming Supplement number. We are much indebted to Dr. Bond and his staff for assistance in consulting their accumulated data in typescript. For Census we use the abbreviation C; for Supplement, S. Unnumbered manuscripts have no Census, Supplement, or shelf numbers. 3 Treatises in unillustrated manuscripts are listed below in section B. &lt; Istanbul, Top Kap'u Saray, 2148-9, The latter part of the manuscript has been removed and separate illustrated leaves have been sold to collectors and libraries in Europe and America. Hugo Buchthal, "Early Islamic miniatures from Baghdad," J. Walters Art Gallery, 1942, 5, 18-39, presents photoreproductions of all the dispersed leaves, descriptions thereof and (note 1) a list of present owners, most of them in the United States. See also Max Meyerhof, "The background and origins of Arabian pharma cology" etc., in Ciba Symposia, 1944, 6, 1846-1876; and Kurt Weitzmann, "The Greek sources of Islamic scientific illustrations," in Archeologica Orientalia in memoriam Ernst Herzfeld. Locust Valley, N.Y., 1952, p. 255f. See below, p. 287 for other folios of the manuscript. 5 Many such diplomas and licences without illustrations are found in medieval manuscripts, e.g., see Bibliotheca Osleriana, MSS 7538ft.</page><page sequence="3">286 Journal of the History of Medicine: April, 1962 The National Library of Medicine, about to be moved from its temporary home in Cleveland to a new building at Bethesda, Maryland, has a large collection of medical manuscripts, both Western and Oriental. A few of these are illustrated. The usual sketches of surgical instruments (in color) are found in the text of a Guy de Chauliac Chirurgia, dated 1476 (Schullian6 509; S. 25). An anatomical sketch of a human head, neck, and thorax, showing sensory centers and a comically accentuated nose, occupies the last page of an incunabulum containing a printed commentary on Aristotle, De anima (Schullian 274). The final page of another incunabulum of Aristotle (Schullian 379) has a similar illustration showing not only sensory centers but also the lungs, heart, stomach, liver, and spleen. A diagram of the eye appears in a sixteenth century manuscript (Greek, Latin, and German) in a treatise entitled De anatomia affectibus et curatione oculorum (S. 70).7 The Library's collection of Oriental manuscripts, one of the most notable in the Western Hemisphere, contains two fifteenth century Persian manuscripts of the famous Mansur Anatomy (Sommer, P 18, P 19), each with the typical Islamic Fünfbilder, which we shall note at the Yale and Osier libraries and at the University of Kansas Medical Center. These two manuscripts are remarkably early examples, and both have a sixth illustration, a pregnant woman. Another Persian manuscript, of later date and concerning general medicine (Sommer, P 5), contains an inserted anatomical illustration of internal and external organs. Other undated Persian manuscripts of the early modern period have water colors of animals and monsters in a treatise on the wonders of the world (Sommer, P 3) and six pages of anatomical illustra tions in a medical treatise (Sommer, P 20). A Turkish treatise on wonders of the world (Sommer, T 1) and two undated early modern Arabic treatises on physiognomy (Sommer, A 58) and alchemy (Sommer, A 65) have illustrations relating to their re spective subjects. Finally, a Persian translation of a Hindu treatise on sexual intercourse (Sommer, P 24) has twenty-two miniatures. In Baltimore, the Johns Hopkins Institute of the History of Medicine has no original manuscripts with miniatures, but its collection of photo-reproductions of medical manuscripts in Euro 6 Dorothy M. Schullian and Francis E. Sommer, A catalogue of incunabula and. manuscripts in the Army Medical Library, New York, 1951. We cite the manuscripts by number, using "Schullian" for the Early Western, and "Sommer," for the Islamic manu scripts. t We cite this late manuscript, as also certain Islamic manuscripts, because of their distinctly medieval character.</page><page sequence="4">mackinney, Herndon: Medieval Medical Miniatures 287 pean libraries, the result of the late Dr. Henry Sigerist's inde fatigable work with his Leica camera, is an invaluable repository of early medica mediaevalia. Dr Harry Friedenwald's medical manuscripts, listed in the Census (p. 2293) as located in Baltimore, are now in Israel at the National Library. The Walters Art Gallery, widely known for its illuminated treasures, has two illustrated medical manuscripts. In a fourteenth century Averroes Colliget (Ms. 136; S. 287) each section is intro duced with a neat, brightly colored and gilded initial portraying the doctor-author lecturing, various types of patients, and a family at a table eating the proper kinds of food. A fourteenth-century French version of Vincent de Beauvais' encyclopedia (Miroir historiale (C 506) depicts Siamese twins alongside a passage con cerning the recorded phenomenon of their birth. More notable, however, in the Walters collection are the non-Western manu scripts. A twelfth-century Arabic version of Dioscorides (MS. 750) has several herbal and bird illustrations; a fifteenth-century leaf from an Arabic history by Rashid ad-Din (MS. W. 676, E) portrays the birth of Buddha in a realistically bloody, full-page obstetrical scene. One of several leaves from a sixteenth-century Hindu history (MS. xo. 668) depicts a physician administering a pill to a dying prince. One other leaf (MS. W. 675), from a famous thirteenth-century Arabic version of Dioscorides,8 pictures two physicians preparing medicine. , In Philadelphia, the College of Physicians has a formid able collection of unillustrated medical manuscripts. Princeton University is less endowed with medical than with other types of manuscripts. For great concentrations of medical manuscripts one must look further north. New York City. The New York Academy of Medicine (like the Frick Art Reference Library, the Johns Hopkins Institute of the History of Medicine, and the private collections of Lynn Thorndike at Columbia University and of Loren MacKinney at the University of North Carolina) has a rich store of medical manuscripts in photo-reproductions; also a number of originals. Next to the fabulous Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, the most note worthy of its illustrated medical manuscripts is a thirteenth-century Chirurgia of Albucasis, embellished with two cautery scenes (two others are missing) and over 150 red-ink sketches of cautery and surgical instruments inserted in the text with captions (e.g., forma 8 See above, note 4.</page><page sequence="5">^88 Journal of the History of Medicine: April, 1962 olivari, etc.). The manuscript also contains unillustrated treatises of Rogerius Salernitanus, Chirurgia; Chirurgia equorum; Caelius Aurelianus, Gynaecia; Liber Trotulae sanitatis Salernitanae de curis mulierum; Priscianus, Gynaecia; and Cleopatra, Gynaecia. Another surgical manuscript, a fourteenth-century English version of Guy de Chauliac (C. 12), has a considerable number of sketches of instruments inserted in the text. Two leaves from a fourteenth century Bernardus de Gordonio, De conservatione vitae humanae, are illustrated with initials in which physicians are shown lectur ing and taking a patient's pulse. A fourteenth-fifteenth-century compendium of medical works in Latin and Italian (C. 4) con tains William of Saliceto's (Guillermus Saliceto) Surgery with a badly rubbed introductory initial portraying the doctor-author holding a book; there are also Latin treatises in the second part of the manuscript on surgery, poisons, baths, stones, and prescrip tions. The Pierpont Morgan Library is a mecca for those who love manuscript miniatures. One of its illustrated medical manuscripts, known the world over, is an early tenth-century Greek Dioscorides (C. and S. 652). Much like the famous Vienna Dioscorides, almost every page is decorated with colored illustrations of herbs and occasionally with an example of animal or mineral materia medica or of pharmaceutical utensils. The last few folios have scenes from Nicander's Alexipharmaca. Less famous, but in some ways more interestingly illustrated, is a fourteenth-century materia medica picture book, without explanatory text but captioned in Latin (S. 873). Catalogued as Compendium Salernitanum and attributed to Platearius, actually it is a version of the Latin alphabetized Dioscorides.9 Similarly well embellished with illustrations (all but one of them in capital letters) is a fifteenth-century Aldo brandinus, Le Régime de Santé (C. 165). Most of the illustrated capitals depict materia diaetetica (i.e., food and drink), but there are also other health scenes such as blood letting, obstetrics, and medicines. Also semi-medical in character are six illustrated bestiaries; four of them bear the following titles: Dicta Chrysostomi de naturis bestiarum, early twelfth-century (S. 832) ; Bestiarium optimum, fourteenth-century (S. 890) ; De natura bestiarum, of about 1187 (C. 81) ; and a fourteenth-century Richard de Four 0 The typescript Library catalogue compares the manuscript to Sloane 4014, to Berlin, Hamilton, 407 and to Modena, Estense, 28. It also closely resembles a fifteenth century Vatican manuscript (Chigi, F.VII.158) described in L. C. MacKinney, "Medical miniatures in medieval manuscripts of the Vatican Library," Manuscripta, 1959, 5, 3-18, 76-88.</page><page sequence="6">MACKiNNEY, Herndon: Medieval Medical Miniatures 289 nival, Bestiare d'Amour (C. and S. 459) ; the other two are thirteenth- and sixteenth-century Persian bestiaries by Ibn Bakhtishu (MSS. 500 and 790). These six bestiaries, which can be classified as materia medica only by reason of their descriptions of the medical uses of the animals pictured, portray little of actual medical practice. For example, there is more of folk lore than of medicine in the caladrius bird, shown perched on a patient's bed to prognosticate recovery (by looking at him) or death (by looking away) ; and the castor biting off its own testicles for the hunter to pick up illustrates a curious method of collecting materia medica. Similarly, semi-medical is Bonifacius Calabriensis' illustrated veterinary manual, in Italian, fifteenth century (C. 735) • Among the medical illustrations in non-medical manuscripts are the following: materia medica and anatomy (Adam and Eve) are found in Corbichon's fifteenth-century French version of Bartholomaeus Anglicus, Livre des propriétés de choses (C. 537); a spectacled rabbit-physician holds a urine flask and picks herbs while watched by two crippled dogs in a fifteenth-century book of hours (C. 358) (Fig. 1) ; something of surgery is represented in the circumcision of the Christ child (S. 868) and in St. Jerome extracting a thorn from a lion's paw (S. 491),10 also there are zodiac-men, etc., in a calendar dated 1386 (S. 355) and in a fifteenth-century astrological manuscript (C. 384). The Morgan Library has relatively few unillustrated medical manuscripts; note worthy examples are a Latin Dioscorides and a Macer herbal. New York City has many private collections belonging to book dealers, physicians, etc., in which there are unillustrated medical manuscripts, and the same can be said for the Public Library and Columbia University. Outstanding among all these is the so-called "Cipher Manuscript" which belonged to the late Mrs. W. M. Voynich (C. 8) ; of uncertain date, late in the Middle Ages, it contains numerous drawings, some of them pharmaceutical. Another manuscript, from the fifteenth century, listed in William Schab's sales catalogue (30, item 117) has illustrations of tempera ments, a man and woman bathing, and a zodiac-constellation figure with bleeding points and anatomical captions. The Yale Medical Library, thanks to the generosity of Dr. Harvey Cushing and Dr. John Fulton, had a collection of medieval 10 A similar miniature of Jerome and the lion appears as the frontispiece of a fifteenth-century German calendar in the Josiah C. Trent Collection of medical manu scripts and rare books at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.</page><page sequence="7">s go Journal of the History of Medicine: April, 1962 medical manuscripts comparable to any in America and to many in Europe even before the momentous acquisition (in 1955) of the famous Paneth Codex (S. 28) .u This early fourteenth-century (1326) compendium of various aspects of medicine (even materia medica, diet, health regimes, veterinaria and the care of falcons) comprises treatises by 42 famous Greek, Graeco-Roman, Moslem, and Christian authors from Hippocrates to Macer and Roger (of Salernitan fame). It is neatly written on 1,378 pages, many of which are embellished with colorful miniatures (60 in all) of medical men and practices (Fig. 2), and numerous sketches of surgical instruments (inserted in the text). For quantity and quality of illustrations this manuscript compares favorably with the illustrated medical treasures of European collections, and in breadth of medical scope it surpasses many of them. Of more restricted range is an illustrated fifteenth-century manuscript entitled Très libri medicini ypocratis platonis et diascoridis (Cushing12 23; S. 18). Despite the authors cited, this is a compilation of materia medica (herbal and animal) belonging to a well-known combination of treatises, the herbal of Pseudo Apuleius, the animal remedies of Sextus Placitus Papiriensis, and the pseudo-Dioscorides De herbis masculinis et femininis. Almost all of the 174 pages contain colored illustrations of herbs or animals, often with additional figures some of which depict ailing humans for whom the remedy was intended. Another fifteenth-century manuscript (Cushing 45; C. p. 952) containing Mesue, Opera, etc., has eight very small, brightly colored illustrations of physicians explaining their remedies. Similarly small are six illustrations of physicians at the beginnings of sections of a fourteenth-century Rhazes, Almansor, etc., (Cush ing 51; C. p. 951). Several other manuscripts have one or two illustrations each but of mediocre medical interest. For example, there are illustrated capitals depicting men asleep in bed, or lying dead under a poisonous herb, or picking herbs, etc., in a thirteenth century manuscript of Aristotle, Physica (Cushing, 4; C. p. 2299). In a Galenic commentary on the Aphorisms of Hippocrates, etc., dated about 1300 (S. 29), is a marginal sketch of a hand and a cup with the caption ova. A single sheet (S. 44) from a fifteenth century manuscript has a full-page anatomical drawing with ex planations in French concerning "les parties intérieures." For 11 For details see Karl Sudhoff, "Codex Fritz Paneth," in Arch. Gesch. Math., 1929, 12, 1-32; and "Notes and Queries," J. Hist.

Another late, but noteworthy, item is the modern replica of the famous Stockholm scroll of John Arderne (Cushing MS 3) made for Dr. Cushing by a Scandinavian friend. It is a re markable reproduction of the fourteenth-century orginal. Similarly noteworthy, though late in origin are six seventeenth or eighteenth-century Islamic copies of earlier manuscripts. Two of them, Abu Bekr on animals, plants, and stones and a "Treasury of Wisdom" concerning animals and herbs, contain typically color ful and daintily artistic illustrations of herbs and animals. Such illustrations are found in many modern Islamic manuscripts of zoological or botanical materia medica. One other late manuscript (Cushing, MS 13), comprising astrological and medical treatises, contains colorful illustrations of the constellations and (on the first six folios) anatomical sketches. The three remaining Islamic manuscripts are anatomical, two of them the famous "Mansur," the other anonymous. All contain colored illustrations of the well known medieval squatting figures (Sudhoff's Fünfbilderserie), which recur often in late Islamic manuscripts, a number of which (as we shall see) are in American collections. As will be noted in our alphabetical list of texts, the Yale Medical Library also has an unusually large number of unillustrated medical manuscripts (Cushing, 4ff). The Boston Medical Library, notable for its medical incunabula, also possesses a formidable collection of medical manuscripts, of which only three are illustrated. One of these, with an explicit date of 1390, containing treatises in Latin and English concerning medical remedies, uroscopy, the plague, health regimes, and medical astrology (Ballard 19;13 C. 23), also has a zodiac man and two series of sketches of urine flasks, each color of significance. A single folio (Ballard 3; S. 26) from a fifteenth century manuscript depicts a full-page bloodletting figure, with red-ink bleeding points and lines leading to marginal notes. A thirteenth-century manuscript of Constantinus Africanus' trans lation of Isaac Judaeus, De febribus (Ballard 31; C. 2) has an illustrated initial containing a portrait of the author. In a recent 13 J. F. Ballard, A catalogue of the medieval and renaissance manuscripts and incunabula in the Boston Medical Library, Boston, 1944. The Catalogue erroneously lists the zodiac drawing as a "zodiacal blood-letting man"; It lacks the bloodletting points.</page><page sequence="9">292 Journal of the History of Medicine: April, 1962 acquisition of fourteen manuscripts of uncertain origin there is one with sketches of surgical instruments.14 The Boston Public Library has four medical manuscripts, two of which are illustrated. In a fourteenth-century Rhazes, entitled De aegritudinibus (C. 26), eight capitals introducing the various sections of the treatise are embellished with small, neatly colored illustrations of physicians or patients. Another manuscript in Latin, French, and English, of about 1400, concerned with various occult sciences (S. 100) has, in addition to numerous astrological charts and a rotary, one full-page bloodletting figure of the usual type, with red-ink bleeding points and lines to marginal notes. In the large collection of manuscripts at the Houghton Library, Harvard University, are a number of unillustrated medical manuscripts, and, bound in a printed book (S. 24278.116*), five stray folios of medical notes, dated 1512, containing drawings of a skeleton and a bloodletting man. At the University of Vermont, in Burlington, on the shelves of the rare book room of the library, is an interesting pictorial herbal, written c. 1500 in Italian with no text, only captions. The 141 folios contain neatly drawn plants in bright water colors. Some are full-page pictures, other pages have as many as eight herbs. In rare cases the herbal sketches are embellished with additional figures: birds, mice, demons, humans picking herbs, dogs or serpents attacking humans, angels hovering over humans (pointing out herbal remedies), men defecating or urinating, a man eating a root, a woman nursing her newborn babe, a man dosing a horse with medicine, and two anthropomorphic figures of the famous male and female mandragora (Fig. 3). The original Census listing (2: 580.9 M 31.45716) has been changed to TR.F580M319 in the Library catalogue. The famous Osier Library at McGill University Faculty of Medicine in Montreal resembles the Boston Medical Library in that it has only a few illustrated items in its large collection of medical manuscripts. Most noteworthy among the illustrated items is a fifteenth-century anonymous Liber medicalis (Osier15 and C., 7579). Arranged according to ailments, the treatise is introduced by a small illustrated initial showing a surgeon trephining a patient. Throughout the text are inserts of surgical instruments, sketched in red and black, with appropriate captions, 14 Dr. Henry Viets was so kind as to permit me to examine these uncatalogued items in his office. is Bibliotheca Osleriana, Oxford, 1929.</page><page sequence="10">MACKiNNEY, herndon: Medieval Medical Miniatures 293 e.g., "forma hec . . Following the Liber medicalis are treatises concerning the plague, poisons, and the zodiac. A fourteenth century anonymous De morbis (Osier and C., 7590), also arranged by ailments, has a number of minute urine flasks in margins opposite urine diagnoses in the text. The treatise ends with a short account of uroscopy. Another fourteenth-century manuscript, the Antidotarium of Nicolaus Salernitanus (in Italian), followed by two Synonyma (Osler and C., 7628), has an introductory initial portraying a physician, presumably Nicolaus. As in several other medical libraries (Yale, Kansas City, Stan ford-Lane, and the National Library of Medicine), the Osier col lection has several Islamic manuscripts. A thirteenth-century Arabic materia medica (Osier 7508) arranged alphabetically (but lacking the items from L to Z), is attributed to Al-Ghafiki of Cordova. Almost all of the 284 folios are neatly illustrated with herbs (over 300 in number), animals, and minerals; many of these are half-page illustrations. Two late manuscripts (seventeenth nineteenth-centuries), one in Arabic, (Osier, 7785, 75) the other in Persian (Osier, 7785, 76), both given to the Library by the late Dr. Casey A. Wood, are versions of the "Mansur" thirteenth-century anatomy. Both manuscripts contain illustrations of the fünfbilder squatting figures (depicting veins, arteries, nerves, muscles, and bones), also additional figures of a pregnant woman.16 Leaving Canada and moving toward the Middle West, one finds at Rochester, New York, an unusual private collection. In Dr. John A. Benjamin's remarkable urological library are a number of manuscripts containing medical material. Three of these are illustrated. A surgical miscellany in German, although dated 1580, is noteworthy because it has full-page illustrations of the famous wound man and zodiac man; also a half-page scene of uroscopy, and twenty colored urine flasks alongside the descrip tions and diagnoses. In an earlier manuscript, an anonymous treatise on uroscopy, written in German at about 1350, are sixty seven water-color sketches of urine flasks, with captions inserted in the text. (Fig. 4). The third of the illustrated manuscripts (S. 2), 16 In 1930 John Beattie and H. E. MacDermot prepared a brochure, Exhibition of the history of anatomical illustration, Montreal, McGill University (reprinted on the occasion of the 1947 meeting of the American Association of Anatomists), which contains excellent brief descriptions of fünfbilder illustrations, not only from Osler MSS, but also from other sources, European and Oriental. See pp. 2-3, 15-16. Dr. O. C. Gruner believes that these squatting figures are "of Mongolian origin." Neither he nor other scholars I have questioned have any explanation for the vase-like embryos in the Persian manu script (folios 33V, 44V). See, however, L. H. Wells's ideas in J. Hist. Med., i960, /5, 61.</page><page sequence="11">294 Journal of the History of Medicine: April, 1962 another medical miscellany, entitled Fasciculus medicinae, written in Bohemia at about 1450 contains six full-page drawings of blood letting figures, and eight colored illustrations of urine flasks to illustrate the textual diagnoses. Dr. Benjamin's unillustrated manuscripts are concerned with materia medica, uroscopy, the pulse, diet, regimen, fractures, etc. Libraries of the Chicago area are rich in medical incunabula and other rare medical works, but poor in medical manuscripts, and of these none is illustrated. Of some interest medically, how ever, are two private collections. Dr. Joseph H. Kiefer, urologist of the University of Illinois College of Medicine, has a collection of colored slides illustrating uroscopy (ancient, medieval and modern). Mr. and Mrs. Joel Spitz of Glencoe, in their remarkable art collection, have several beautifully illustrated fifteenth-century Books of Hours, one of which (C. 514) contains several full-page medical miniatures; viz., Saints Cosmas and Damian holding pharmaceutical utensils, nurses caring for the newborn Christ child, and two persecutors forcibly removing Ste. Apolonia's teeth with hammer and tongs. This manuscript exemplifies the medical illustrations that are to be found in sumptuous religious manu scripts throughout the Western world. So attractive are these manuscripts to American collectors, and so numerous are they in public and private libraries, that one wonders how there can be any such treasurers left in the European lands of their origin. Moving westward from Chicago, the searcher for medical manuscripts finds less of interest. However, the University of Minnesota has two short texts, and in the private library of Dr. Charles D. Humberd, at Barnard, Missouri, are seven unillustrated medical manuscripts. Another surprise is encountered in the Clendening Library of the History of Medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City. Here, we believe, are two of the most important of all American holdings of Islamic manuscripts of fünfbilder anatomical figures (already mentioned as items at the Yale and Osier libraries and the National Library of Medicine). One of the manuscripts, a seventeenth-century Persian copy of the "Mansur" thirteenth-century anatomical treatise, has full-page illustrations of the vein-, artery-, nerve-, muscle- and bone men. Another, from eighteenth-century Persia, depicts the same five figures, in full-page pictures, with no accompanying text but with detailed captions. In addition there are illustrations of the</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 1. A rabbit-physician and two dog-patients. From folio 20v of a fifteenth century Book of Hours. ( Courtesy of the J.

The University of Oregon (at Eugene) has a remarkable (and unpublicized) collection of medieval Latin manuscripts, comprising classical, scholastic, and liturgical treatises dating from as early as the eleventh century. However, the only medical manu script is a Macer Floridus herbal (S. 15), with no illustrations but neatly ornamented. The San Francisco and Los Angeles areas teem with dealers and collectors of manuscripts, and with collegiate and medical collections both public and private. As mentioned above for other regions, the number of Books of Hours and of late Islamic manuscripts is impressive. The Library of the University of California at Berkeley has no illustrated medical manuscripts, but an unillustrated Marbodus lapidary and a late medieval medi cal account book in Italian. The Sutro Library in San Francisco has an Aldobrandino 'health regimen' and a book of medical 'secreta,' both in Italian. The Lane Medical Library of Stanford University, now at Palo Alto, is another Islamic surprise, with over fifty of the typically late manuscript copies of Avicenna, etc. A card catalogue, compiled by an Arabic medical student, briefly describes the con tents of each item. The Stanford University Library has no strictly medical manuscripts, but a fifteenth-century veterinary manual by Flavius Vegetius Renatus is embellished with a full-page frontispiece depicting a veterinarian holding a tube to a horse's nostril and, with his other hand, another tube or a probe to the horse's jaw, while his assistant holds the reins and a bowl. Another surprise is to be found in an out-of-the-way library of beautiful architectural charm, at St. John's Seminary near it The University of Kansas Library, at Lawrence, has an M.A. thesis by an Arabic medical student which contains a description of this manuscript and a translation of the captions. It does not, however, do justice to the four additional illustrations, nor to the literature and problems of the Fünfbilderserie in Western medieval manuscripts, in modern Islamic manuscripts, and in oriental manuscripts (which have not been explored thoroughly for similar illustrations). Sudhoff's suggestion that the Fünfbilder may have originated in Hellenistic Alexandria whence they spread eastward and westward, has been accepted by most recent commentators. This assumption is being put to the test of extant manuscript evidences by Mr. Boyd Hill of the University of North Carolina. American Islamists could contribute to a solution by mobilizing the evidence in American collections such as have been mentioned above. Karl Sudhoff and E. V. Cowdry have noted certain Tibetan sources. Ilza Veith and O. C. Gruner suggest Mongolian origins. There might be traces in Central and South American sources. Strangely enough, not one ancient Greek or Byzantine trace has been found to justify the assumption of Hellenistic-Alexandrian origin.</page><page sequence="17">296 Journal of the History of Medicine: April, 1962 Camarillo. Here, among the many illustrated liturgical manu scripts of the Doheny collection, is a fifteenth-century Book of Hours, in Spanish (Doheny18; MS. 700) ; the Office of the Dead in this manuscript is illustrated with a marginal picture in grisaille of a cadaver with the abdomen open. Also at the Seminary is a fifteenth-century manuscript of Bartholomaeus Anglicus in Corbichon's French translation (Des propriétés des choses) (Doheny, op. cit., p. 3, MS 6809) : therein are several illustrations; viz., a lecturer demonstrating human anatomy with a naked figure, another lecturer on maladies, a physician directing his assistant in digging for stones, and numerous trees and plants as embellish ments for the sections on herbal materia medica. Another surprise in the Los Angeles area is the private library of Robert B. Honeyman, near San Juan Capistrano. This re markable collection of rare books, incunabula, and medieval manuscripts (25 in number) is rich in the history of science. How ever, it has one medieval manuscript containing medical material, a twelfth-thirteenth-century miscellany of astronomical, mathe matical, and musical works (S.i, General Science 1); colored illus trations of the constellations embellish the section on astral influences on health. The outstanding collection of illustrated manuscripts on the Pacific Coast is at the Huntington Library and Museum, in San Marino. Here one finds a wealth of beautiful manu scripts, notably Books of Hours, also several medical manu scripts. An herbal leech book (MS. 19079) written in English "in the year of Christ 1100," has one marginal sketch of an herb. A fifteenth-century medical miscellany in Latin (C. HM 64) has the traditional bloodletting man, also two zodiac-men (homo signorum), the traditional sphere of Pythagoras, and eighteen rough sketches of urine flasks with instructions in English along side. Less directly related to medicine are the following illus trations: Ste. Apolonia and her brutally extracted teeth are de picted in a Book of Hours (C. HM 1171) ; a thirteenth-century Aristotle, De naturis animalium (C. HM 1035) shows a monk explaining the nature of six animals standing nearby; a fourteenth century manuscript containing Isidore's Origines and several histories (C. HM 1034), and a fourteenth-century Latin chronicle in scroll form (C. HM 264), depict the Creation and various other 18 A catalogue of books and manuscripts in the Estelle Doheny collection (Los Angeles, !955)- Pt- 3. P- 3</page><page sequence="18">MACKiNNEY, herndon: Medieval Medical Miniatures 297 historical scenes. The Library has several unillustrated medical manuscripts. As compared with the East, the South (like the Middle and Far West) is a young region so far as manuscripts are concerned.19 In Dallas, Texas, Dr. Lyle M. Sellers' library has several unillustrated manuscripts, notably a fifteenth-century Hebrew version of Bernardus de Gordonio, Lilium medicinae; and the Burbank Collection of the Texas Medical Center in Houston has a manuscript of a portion of Paul of Aegina. The most im pressive collection of medieval medical manuscripts in the South is in the Reynolds Library, recently transferred to the University of Alabama Medical Center (at Birmingham) from its former home in Detroit. This collection has seven medical manuscripts, two of which are illustrated. The more noteworthy of these is a fourteenth-century manuscript (S. 4) containing Arnaldus de Villanova, Regimen sanitatis (along with other treatises); in it are twenty-six color drawings of people eating, drinking, and in maniacal frenzy; also a woman sitting on the bed of a sick old man, and numerous sketches of plants, trees, and fruits. Another manu script, a fifteenth-century Hebrew translation of Rhazes, Almansor (book IX) has ornamental initials, and (at the beginning of a section on sex), a man and woman standing under a sort of canopy. The unillustrated manuscripts of the collection contain prescrip tions, treatises on diseases, surgery, urinalysis, the pulse, and blood letting; included are works by Bernardus de Gordonio and an unidentified Syriac treatise. The somewhat sparse findings of manuscripts in the Middle and Far West impel us to remind readers that the total number of illustrated manuscripts in the United States and Canada is over 80. The number of separate medical miniatures is surprising; if each separate illustration of materia medica, surgical instruments, urine flasks, etc., is included, the total comes close to two thousand. 1» It should be noted, however, that the medical libraries of these regions often have extensive collections of modern manuscripts concerning local physicians and medical practices of early American days.</page><page sequence="19">298 Journal of the History of Medicine: April, 1962 B. Mediaeval Medical Treatises in North American Libraries20 THOMAS HERNDON This check-list is composed of pre-sixteenth century medical treatises in public and private libraries in the United States and Canada. It is intended as a research tool for historians of medicine, science, and culture. As has already been indicated in the preceding section, in addition to strictly medical works, the list includes those of the ancillary disciplines of pharmacy, botany, etc. However, Islamic medical treatises are excluded. Since there is no standard method of citing the names of authors, they are usually listed aphabetically in accordance with the citations in the Census. Anonymous treatises are listed alpha betically in a separate section. The information for a treatise is generally as follows: author's name; title; language of the treatise if different from that of the title; date as indicated in the reference; library symbol as found in the latest revised edition of the Symbols Used in the National Union Catalog of the Library of Congress; the name of the collection or owner if any; the local catalogue; the shelf-listing if known; the Census number; and, finally, the Supplement number. No numerical designation for a treatise means that it has not been entered in the Census or Supplement. A discussion of many of the works in this check-list may be found in the preceding section. The collaborators of this article will welcome any information concerning manuscripts that have not come to their notice.
