<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philo' s Reversal WILLIAM H. AUSTIN University of Houston At the beginning of Part XII of the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, Philo seems to reverse himself and endorse the Design Argument. "That the works of nature bear a great analogy to the productions of art is evident," he says, and according to all the rules of good reasoning, we ought to in- fer... that their causes have a proportional analogy.... Here, then, the existence of a Deity is plainly ascertained by reason....1 Nelson Pike has reminded us of this apparent reversal, which T. E. Jessop had earlier called the "primary problem" for the expositor of the Dia- logues, and has proposed for consideration an interpretation of the Dia- logues ' overall structure which would account for it (pp. 204, 233f). Though he does not commit himself to this interpretation, for simplicity of exposition I will call it "Pike's interpretation." The starting point for Pike's interpretation is the thesis that when Cleanthes offers the "voice from the clouds" analogy in Dialogoue III he is advancing a new argument, independent of his earlier attempt to show that the hypothesis of a Designer can be supported in the same way scientific hypotheses are supported. The new argument is, Pike suggests, that when we survey the orderly contrivances of nature we simply cannot help im- mediately acknowledging a Designer, just as when someone speaks to us we at once conclude that we are in the presence of an intelligent being, without going through a step-by-step analogical argument. "Tell me," Cleanthes urges, "if the idea of a contriver does not immediately flow in upon you with a force like that of sensation." This new argument is "irregular," as Cleanthes admits, but it is compelling and Philo has no answer to it; in fact, it convinces him, though he doesn't acknowledge this until much later. (Thus Pike, pp. 228f). I do not want to discuss Pike's two-argument thesis here, though it is worth close examination. For present purposes, I will assume it is correct. Rather, I am concerned with the interpretation of the structure of the Dialogues that he builds upon it. Since I will be offering alternatives to this interpretation at several points, it seems necessary to quote at some length Pike's own summary of it. 103</page><page sequence="2">By the time Dialogue III is completed, Cleanthes has developed two positions regarding the way in which order and contrivance in the natural world are evidentially related to the 4 4 hypothesis of design." In Dialogue II he presents the 4 "scientific" version... which Philo vigorously criticizes and rejects. In response to Philo's initial criti- cisms, Cleanthes... offers the 4 'irregular" version of the argument in Dialogue III. At this point, Philo makes no comment on the second version of the argument - in Dialogues IV through XI his critical attentions are still focused on the 4 'scientific" tradition in theol- ogy.... However, in Dialogue XII, Philo returns to the 4 4 irregular" proof given in Dialogue III. It is this second argument that he ac- cepts. ..[as] both 4 'irresistible" and 4 'legitimate." Continuing, Pike asks: How much support does the "irregular" argument from design pro- vide for the basic principles of Christian theism?... The conclusion supported by the "irregular" argument is regrettably vague and in- complete.... However,... [it] constitutes an important part of what is believed by the practicing Christian.... [and] will serve to arouse the "natural sentiments" of 4 4 well disposed minds" to seek further un- derstanding in revelation. In the end, Philo says, faith must supple- ment the conclusion established by reason (pp. 233f). I find it hard to believe that David Hume had that much sympathy with Christian theism. Accordingly, I want to offer another interpretation of the overall line of argument in the Dialogues , an interpretation consistent with the supposition that his sympathy was very limited indeed. Along the way, I will suggest (1) that another explanation can be given for Philo's ultimate endorsement of a form of design argument; (2) that Pike seriously under- estimates the importance of one part of what is going on in the middle Dialogues; and (3) that the final appeal to faith and revelation should not be taken at face value. Begin with Philo's apparent change of heart. One popular explanation, advanced by Kemp Smith, is that is is a mere subterfuge, appended to placate the pious. Pike develops several cogent objections to this idea, the most striking of which is that half of Dialogue XII is given over to Philo's vigorous polemics against popular religion and the clergy - hardly a likely placation strategy (pp. 223f). Pike has provided a valuable clue here. Perhaps we can better understand the reasons for Philo's endorsement of a form of design argument if we 104</page><page sequence="3">consider the substance of Dialogue XII. Between the endorsement at the beginning and the appeal to revelation at the end, we find three major points made: (1) that the dispute over the design argument, and in general the dispute between theists and atheists, is largely verbal in nature; (2) that such conclusions as can rightly be drawn in natural theology can never have any distinctive relevance for behavior, but can only reinforce our natural inclinations to morality and justice; and (3) that the effects of popular religion are baneful. In the very paragraph from which I quoted at the beginning. Philo says he is "apt to suspect there enters somewhat of a dispute of words into this controversy, more than is usually imagined." There are great analogies between "the works of nature" and "the productions of art," but there are great disanalogies too. The theist, he continues, stresses the analogies and concludes that the cause of the universe is quite a bit like a human intelligence; the skeptic stresses the disanalogies and concludes that the cause of the universe has only a faint, remote similarity to a human in- telligence. So the dispute is over the degree of resemblance. But "con- troversies concerning the degrees of any quality or circumstance" are notoriously irresolvable; being such a controversy, "the dispute concerning theism... is merely verbal, or perhaps, if possible, still more incurably ambiguous." Moreover, each party, when pressed, will have to make concessions. "Will you quarrel, Gentlemen, about the degrees, and enter into a controversy which admits not... of any determination?... Consider then where the real point of controversy lies; and if you cannot lay aside your disputes, endeavor, at least, to cure yourselves of your animosity."2 We may have reservations about the merits of this argument. Baldness is a matter of degree, and it would be profitless to dispute whether someone with a large bald spot is balder than someone with a markedly receding hairline. Still, being egg-bald, being half-bald, and having a full head of hair are plainly distinct states, and the differences matter to some. Simi- larly, it would seem to be a significant question whether the source of the cosmos has a considerable analogy to a human designing intelligence or only a remote one. But our concern here is with Hume's purposes, not the quality of his arguments. It is clear enough what the point is, of which he wants to persuade his readers: disputes over natural theology are un- profitable, and certainly nothing to get passionate about. The second major point of Dialogue XII is made by Cleanthes, in response to Philo's initial recital of some "pernicious consequences" of "vulgar superstition." The "proper office of religion," he says, 105</page><page sequence="4">is to regulate the hearts of men, humanize their conduct, infuse the spirit of temperance, order, and obedience;... its operation is silent and only enforces the motives of morality and justice.... When it distinguishes itself, and acts as a separate principle over men, it has departed from its proper sphere... (pp. 114f). Philo agrees, of course, and elaborates the theme, making many of the points later stressed in Kant's Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone. It is important that shortly before the passage just quoted, Philo has insisted that we can't infer nearly as much resemblance between the Deity's moral attributes and ours as we can in the case of intellectual attributes. He piously adds that this merely means that the Supreme Being's moral su- periority to us is far greater, even, than his intellectual superiority (p. 133). But the point remains: we can't know anything about God's moral prop- erties, and therefore can't get any guidance from them. Nothing that we can learn in natural theology can have any distinctive consequences for our behavior. Pike takes note of this theme, and briefly discusses it (pp. 214f), but regards it as 4 4 subsidiary"; I suggest on the contrary that it is crucial. In particular, Philo insists that the proper conclusions of natural theology lend no support whatever to popular religion. He discourses emphatically and at length on the dire personal and social consequences of 4 'superstition' ' and "enthusiasm," and on the importance of keeping political power out of the hands of the clergy (pp. 115-122). Cleanthes makes no serious objection to any of this, interrupting only once to warn Philo not to allow his 4 4 zeal against false religion to undermine his veneration for the true" (p. 119), and again the suggest that people sometimes find consolation in religion (p. 120). And on the latter point he offers no resistance to Philo's reply, that only true, philosophical (as opposed to popular) religion is likely to be consoling. The points made in Dialogue XII are hardly minor ones. It seems most unlikely that they are mere afterthoughts, included to fill out a section designed principally for another purpose - to deflect the wrath of the godly (Kemp Smith) or to affirm the design argument and commmend revelation (Pike). On the contrary, I would suggest that they are the points Hume was most concerned to have his readers accept. Whatever they thought of the arguments of the earlier sections, he wanted to convince them that superstition and enthusiasm are pernicious, that true religion would never lead anyone to act differently than the natural inclinations of benevolence 106</page><page sequence="5">and justice would suggest, and that acrimonious controversy should be shunned above all in matters of religion. Consider the setting in which these theses are advanced. The dogmatist Demea has left. Philo has stopped playing games and is offering his 4 'un- feigned sentiments." Cleanthes and Philo find themselves in harmony and (by the end) in almost perfect agreement. All this suggests that what Hume is trying to convey is that the points made in Dialogue XII are the points on which all sensible people can agree, whatever their differences on other questions. They are also, I believe, the points on which it is most important (from Hume's point of view) that people should agree. They are the most important points because they are the practical points 4 'Let people dispute theoretical issues all they like;" I imagine Hume saying, "if they accept the lessons of Dialogue XII, no harm will come of their religion." And indeed it seems that Hume thought of religion mainly as a source of mischief and pain. If I am right about the purpose of Dialogue XII, then there is an obvious reason for Philo's endorsement of some form of design argument. Most educated Britishers in Hume's day were thoroughly convinced that the argument was basically sound. They would have agreed with Cleanthes that when they considered the order in nature, "the idea of a contriver" flowed in upon them "with a force like that of sensation." Philo's chance of convincing them of the points he wants to make in Dialogue XII will be seriously impaired if he doesn't acknowledge that he feels the same force. He must agree on this basic point if he is not to continue to seem to many a mere ingenious player of intellectual games. In supplying a motive for Philo's apparent reversal, this interpretation does not necessarily conflict with Pike's; it may just supplement his. It may be that in fact Hume saw no good answer to Cleanthes' second argument - though we know that he was dissatisfied with its formulation, since he asked Gilbert Elliott for help in strengthening it (pp. 23 If)- It may even be that Hume himself felt an overwhelming impression of a Contriver when he contemplated the works of nature - though I suspect that if so he might have been inclined to attribute the phenomenon to the effects of "early education," which he unobtrusively has Cleanthes men- tion in this connection (p. 110). But I think my interpretation does more than Pike's does to explain why Philo's acknowledgment of a Designer comes when it does rather than at the point where Cleanthes offers his second argument, and also why Philo dwells on the point at some length.3 107</page><page sequence="6">Can we place this reading of Dialogue XII within an interpretation of the overall structure of the argument of the Dialogues? To this end we must look next (if only briefly) at the middle dialogues. According to Pike, as we have seen, Dialogues IV through XI are given over to further scrutiny of the "scientific" version of the design argument. It seems to me that this characterization does less than full justice to the significance of these Dialogoues. Much of their content fits Pike's description, but some of Philo's criticisms seems to tell equally against both of Cleanthes' argu- ments. And one of them in particular seems to me much more important than Pike's account would suggest. It is reasonable to assume that all the more technical arguments developed by Philo are directed against Cleanthes' "scientific" argument rather than the intuitive, "irregular" one. Perhaps, more generally, we can say the same of all the alternative explanations of order in the cosmos that Philo proposes in Dialogues V through VIII - that the cosmos is the product of a committee, or of generations of trial and error by artisan godlings; that it is an organism rather than a machine; that its order arose out of a process something like random variation and natural selection. Perhaps, that is, the reader is meant (or at least permitted) to agree with Cleanthes that these are mere ingenous speculations that cannot possibly prevail against the overwhelming impression of a Designer that we all feel in our breasts. ( I would suggest, though, that Philo could well have argued that the idea of the world as a great organism would have seemed as immediately evident to the "ancient theologians" who espouses it as that of a Designer seems in the eighteenth century.4 But Hume would have been anxious not to alienate his readers on this crucial point.) That there is evil in the world, however, is no abstruse cavil; this too is immediately evident and forcefully felt. So the objection from evil applies equally to both of Cleanthes' arguments. And of course it is the basis of Philo's insistence that we have no way of inferring anything positive about the Designer's moral attributes. Finally, in my opinion, a thesis developed principally in Dialogues IV and V is a significant step in Hume's program. I refer to Philo's thesis, agreed to cheerfully by Cleanthes and with horror by Demea, that the Designer whose existence Cleanthes has inferred is quite unlike the God of traditional orthodoxy. He is finite, limited, and far too anthropomorphic. This objection also applies as well to the "irregular" as to the "scientific" argument. 108</page><page sequence="7">In this connection, Pike calls attention to Paley's interpretation of om- nipotence, i.e., roughly, that when we speak of God's infinite power we mean simply that his power is vastly greater than any other and more than sufficient to meet all our needs(pp. 145f). Pike thinks there is much to be said for this interpretation, and commends it to the consideration of the- ologians. Perhaps it is for this reason that he attaches little importance to Philo' s point. But it still could have been (and I think was) important to Hume , who was concerned with the orthodox tradition as he knew it, not as it might have been if the Father's of the Church had not been unduly influenced by Neo-Platonism. I can now state the interpretation of the overall plan of the Dialogues that I want to propose. I suggest that Hume's main objective was to thwart any use of the design argument in support of Christian orthodoxy, and above all to show that no practical consequences could be drawn from it. (Recall that Hume's original title for Section XI of the Inquiry was "Of the Practical Consequences of Natural Theology,"5 and that there too he argues that there are none.6) In pursuit of his objective Hume develops an argument in three stages. First, the design argument (or at least the version that pretends to scientic status) is unsound. Second, even if it were sound it would be of no use to Christian orthodoxy, since the Designer whose existence it purports to prove is quite different from the God of orthodox theology. Third, even if it gives support to some of the theoretical tenets of Christian theology, it gives none to any of the practical tenets, and certainly none to popular religion. (Moreover, the degree of support it lends even to the theoretical tenets is indeterminable, and thus not a matter worth fighting over.) His procedure is a bit like that of counsel for the defense in a suit for breach of contract, who might argue in her brief (1) that there was no agreement between the parties; (2) that even if there was an agreement there was no contract , since no consideration changed hands; (3) that even if there was a contract it was "unconscionable" (a standard term in contract law) and therefore should not be enforced. It is also like the procedure Hume follows in the essay "Of Miracles." Just as the design argument was the mainstay of the natural-theology stage of orthodox apologetics in Hume's time, so too it was primarily by appeal to biblical miracles (including prophecies, which Hume also explicitly includes7) that theologians sought to establish the credentials of Christian revelation. Here again Hume mounts a three-stage attack. First he offers a general argument, too familiar to need repetition here, to counterweigh 109</page><page sequence="8">any argument from testimony for belief in a miracle. Second, he gives several reasons to think that as testimonial evidence goes, the evidence for the biblical miracles is weak. Third, he argues that even if there might be a balance of probability in favor of some miracle stories, 4 'a miracle can never be proved so as to be the foundation of a system of religion ."8 The reason is that, to whatever extent a miracle establishes one system of religion, it discredits that system's competitors; and since the miracle- stories of the various religions are about equally well or poorly attested (Hume doesn't explicitly state this premise, but he needs it and seems to be assuming it), they cancel each other out, leaving each system completely unsupported. So even if we had reason to believe in some miracle, that fact could never be of any use to theological apologists. With miracles as with the design argument, philosophers have naturally tended to be interested primarily in the theoretical issues raised at the first stage of Hume's argument. But it appears that for Hume's own purposes, the later stages, designed to show that whatever emerges from the theo- retical discussions will be religiously innocuous, were at least equally important and probably more so. There remains the problem, what to make of Philo's recommendation, at the very end of the Dialogues , of faith in 4 'revealed truth. ' ' (Considering how little reason can establish, he says, a "well disposed mind" will feel a longing desire and expectation that heaven would be pleased to dissipate, at least alleviate, this profound ignorance by affording some more particular revelation to mankind... (p. 123). This passage could be read, and I am not at all sure it isn't menât to be read, as saying, "We sorely need a revelation; wouldn't it be nice if we had one?" On this reading, the passage is one more sly thrust at the theologians - though subtle and subdued, in keeping with the tone of Dia- logue XII. But this interpretation is hard to reconcile with any straight- forward reading of the immediately-following statements that anyone with a due appreciation of the limitations of reason will "fly to revealed truth with the greatest avidity" and that 'to be a philosophical sceptic is, in a man of letters, the first and most essential step towards being a sound, believing Christian." On the other hand, Hume himself never showed any signs of flying to revealed truth with any noticeable degree of avidity. And considering the biting sarcasm of the following well-known passages from "Of Miracles," it is exceedingly difficult to believe that Philo's recommendation of faith 110</page><page sequence="9">in revealed truth is in earnest: Our most holy religion is founded on faith, not on reason; and it is a sure method of exposing it to put it to such a trial as it is by no means fitted to endure.... And whoever is moved by faith to assent to it is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person which subverts all the principles of his understanding and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and ex- perience.9 Kemp Smith writes off Philo's recommendation as a "conventionally pre- scribed proviso,"10 and perhaps that is the best that can be done with it, though it seems a rather summary way of dealing with the problem. The difficulty is mitigated, though not eliminated altogether, if we take the main point of Philo's final remark to be that there is no harm in skepticism - a return to a major theme of Dialogue I. NOTES 1. David Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion , edited and with commentary by Nelson Pike (Indianapolis and New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1970), pp. llOf. There is more in this vein in the early pages of Dialogue XII and at the very end of Dialogue X. (Page references in the text are to Pike's edition.) 2. Ibid. , pp. 210-213. As to both parties making concessions, the rhetoric of the passage suggests a rough parity of concession-making, but on closer examination we find that Philo has the theist conceding a good deal more than the atheist does. Also, pace Pike, Philo's suggestion that the dispute is verbal would seem to diminish the force of his endorsement of a form of design argument. 3. If my readings of Hume's intentions in Dialogue XII is right, he took a dangerous step in having Philo characterize the dispute between theists and skeptics as 4 4 verbal," since this might raise doubts in readers' minds about Philo's sincerity. Hume's desire to reduce the level of heat in theological controversy must have been strong. Perhaps he thought Philo's repeated avowals of belief in a Designer would be sufficiently reassuring. 4.
