ABSTRACT An experimental design strategy is presented for the purpose of obtaining efficient and sta- tistically reliable data for the evaluation of mul ti -vari able parameter effects on crash-impact and passive occupant protection materials. Two methods in particular, the factorial and the box- Behnken, are presented and applied to a variety of energy-absorbing materials including: Etha- foam, Ensolite, Sorbothane, and expanded bead polystyrene. Results of the study suggest that Sorbothane could be used to effectively reduce injury potential in vehicle areas which are size constrained from using lighter but thicker energy-absorbing padding materials. The factori- al method is also used to demonstrate qualitative evaluation of data obtained from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration Tho- racic Side Impact Protection Research Program. The results of this phase of the paper indicate the high level of importance associated with side-impact occupant protection materials. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN strategy for efficiently evaluating the multi- variable effects of vehicle structures and occu- pants in crash-impact situations. Two standard test methods, the factorial (1)* and the Box- Behnken approach (2), are used as the basis for the multi-variable experimental design strategy. The output from the above strategy yields an empirical response function, or polynomial, which describes dependent variable response (i.e. upper thorax "G" levels, head injury criteria, etc.) to variations of independent variables (i.e. thick- ness of protective padding, vehicle impact speeds, etc.) and enables determination of key variables and interactions, with some statistical reliability. By means of interpolation and a limited amount of extrapolation, the empirical response function also enables predictions of dependent variable response to conditions of independent variables which were not tested. Although emphasis in this paper is on the appli- cation of the strategy for evaluation of multi- variable effects on occupant passive protection materials, the strategy is also applied to cer- tain test results of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Thoracic Side Impact Protection Research Program (3,4). FIELD DATA IDENTIFICATION OF KEY PARAMETERS A considerable amount of transportation safety research has focused in recent years on the issue of side-impact protection for motor vehicle occupants. Several excellent statistical analysis studies of field accident data, con- ducted by researchers such as Rouhana and Foster (5), Kahane (6), and Partyka and Rezabek (7), among others, have led to the identification of certain key injury-causing variables clearly demonstrating the importance of providing side- impact crash protection as a means for reducing fatal and serious occupant injury in vehicle-to- vehicle and single vehicle side-impact crashes. For instance, through the use of the National Crash Severity Study (NCSS) data file these stu- dies point out that nearly one-third of the lives lost in highway accidents are attributable to side-impact cases; near-side occupants had about three times the average incidence of serious or fatal injury as far-side occupants; drivers had approximately the same average incidence of imme- diate to fatal injury whether on the near side or far side; and vehicle-to-vehicle accidents ac- counted for approximately 85 percent of all side impact cases. Head and neck injuries were espe- cially significant in far-side impacts for both drivers and right-front passengers; the thorax, abdomen, and head were at nearly equal risk when injuries of Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 4 or greater were considered. Reference 7, which reviewed field accident information from both the NCSS datatile and the Motors Insurance Corpora ♦Numbers in parentheses designate references listed at the end of paper. 4.413 0096-736X/89/9704-041 3S02.50 Copyright 1989 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">tion datafile (General Motors data) Indicates that the upper torso is a number-one category of injury, with fractured bones ranking greater than soft tissue lung damage. This study (7) also notes a strong tendency for increases in the likelihood of serious injury when the weight and/or the velocity of the striking vehicle increases, due in part to increased likelihood of structural collapse of the impacted vehicle. Similarly, Tarriere observes that if the delta V of the accident vehicle exceeds 25 kilometers/ hour, then intrusion into the struck vehicle becomes more substantial and the role of the seat belt becomes limited in effectiveness to minimiz- ing ejection; however, Rouhana and Foster point out that the incidence of fatality in side impact was 25 percent less for those who used restraints (5). In general, the field accident studies sug- gest that the near-side occupants are most likely to be injured in the immediate impact area due to the structural collapse or violation of occupant compartment integrity. Reference 5 notes that the incidence of injury increased by a factor of 3 to ,10 times when passenger compartment damage was indicated. With regard to passenger com- partment damage and intrusion, Kahane (6) points out that in vehicle-to-vehicle side impacts the NCSS datafile shows that the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 214, requiring specific minimum levels of strength for doors of passenger cars sold in the United States, had virtually no effect in reducing fatalities. Fur- ther, Kahane states that "for near-side occupants in multi-vehicle compartment impacts on the highways, there is an extremely strong relation- ship of crush depth to injury risk, consistent with the experimental findings using staged crashes and anthropomorphic dummies." The above field accident data studies indicate that improvements in the integrity of vehicle side structures (i.e. minimize collapse into the occu- piable area) and addition of interior energy- absorbing passive protection materials are keys to reducing side-impact serious injury and fatal- ity levels. Vehicle speeds and orientation at impact are also key factors associated with like- lihood of injury in side-impact crashes. Table 1 summarizes the key variables identified by the field accident studies. Table 1. Important Side Impact Parameters • Structural main frame collapse or intrusion into occupiable areas • Interior energy-absorbing passive occupant protection materials • Vehicle speeds and weight • Orientation of vehicles at impact NHTSA LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS AND THE FACTORIAL METHOD Hackney and his co-workers, through their research efforts in the NHTSA Thoracic Side Impact Protection Research Program (3), have provided a basis for demonstrating the two-level (high and low value) Factorial Test Method (1) as applied to evaluation of injury-mitigating ef- fects of vehicle side-structure improvements and interior passive protection materials. Hackney utilizes the results of several laboratory and field accident studies to identify key variables and establish test conditions. With regard to vehicle-to-vehicle side impacts (which account for approximately 85 percent of all side-impact cases) four key variables are identified. These are: (1) vehicle side-structure resistance to first impact collapse; (2) vehicle interior ener- gy absorbing capability for second impact of occupant and structure; (3) vehicle speeds and ratio of speed of striking vehicle to struck ve- hicle; and (4) orientation of vehicles at impact. The baseline test vehicles used in this test series were unmodified 2-door Volkswagen Rabbits. A structurally optimized version of the 2-door VW Rabbit (developed in NHTSA-sponsored studies con- ducted earlier [8]) was used as the upper level for the vehicle side-structure parameter. Compo- nent tests run on several different padding mate- rials were used to select an optimum (or nearly optimum) interior passive protection material for the second variable. In this case a General Tire and Rubber Company (GTR) polyurethane foam was selected for incorporation into the test series. From the NCSS datafile it was determined that the ratio of striking vehicle to struck vehicle speeds was approximately two to one for side- impact conditions. The low and high-speed impact conditions were selected respectively as 26/13 miles per hour, and 35/17.5 miles per hour. The high and low values for orientation of striking vehicle to struck vehicle were selected at 90° and 60°, respectively. A movable deformable barrier (MDB) weighing 3000 pounds was used as the striking vehicle. The Side-Impact Dummy (SID) was used to measure injury potential. All tests were run with near-side impact conditions. Tables 2 and 3 illustrate the approximate fac- torial test matrix and combinations (trials) of parameters for each test configuration associated with the above NHTSA study. The test results for driver left-upper-rib peak G corresponding to each test configuration are also given in Table 3. It should be pointed out that these tests are normally run in a random order which is different from that shown in Table 3. Furthermore, random repeats of each test con- figuration are also normally run to obtain a measure of statistical "goodness" of data. Fin- ally, at least two to four tests are run with all parameters set to average values (defined as 4.414</page><page sequence="3">880397 Table 2.

Factorial analysis (Table 3) of the experi- mentally derived response data for peak G loads experienced by the SID driver in the left-upper- rib (LUR) region yields the linear response poly- nomial shown in Eq. (1) as: Glur = 108.5-5.68Xj - 25.43X2 + 25.29X3 - 15.23X4 + 2.56XjX2 - 2.51XJX3 - 8.24XjX4 - 7.4X2X3 - 3.14X2X4 + 0.05X3X4 + 8.39XjX2X3 + 1.38XJX2X4 - 5.89X2X3X4 + 0.14XjX3X4 - 2.34XjX2X3X4 (1) where the Xj values represent non-dimensional values of the independent parameters scaled between +1 and -1 for the high and low levels, respectively. For values of Xj other than the high (+1) and low (-1) levels, Eq. (2) may be used to obtain the appropriate scaled version of each parameter: X, 1 (scaled) = X^actualMX^hQ+XjOo))^ ^ 1 (XjfhO-XjOo))^ where the Xj values represent real magnitudes and units of the independent parameters. For in- stance, if an impact angle of 75° were of inter- est, the corresponding non-dimensional scaled 4.415</page><page sequence="4">value for X4 would be calculated from Eq. (2) as follows: X ą = 75° - (90° + 60° ) /2 = 0&lt;0 (3) ą (90°-60°)/2 Likewise, an impact angle of 82.5° would give a non-dimensional scaled value of X ą „ 82.5° - (90° + 60° )/2 . Q&lt;5 {4) ą (90° - 60° )/2 Similar scaling would be used for other quantita- tive parameters such as X3, the speed factor. Qualitative independent parameters such as the structural (Xi) and padding (X2) factors would have to be defined in terms of quantitative val- ues (i.e. stiffness for Xi and perhaps thickness or density for X2) in order to allow for dimen- sioni ess parameters other than the +1 or -1 values. An advantage of using the Eq. (1) response polynomial form of the factorial method test re- sults is illustrated by examination of the poly- nomial coefficients. Observation of the linear term coefficients indicates that the X2 and X3 parameters are of equal, but opposite, strength and much greater contributors to peak G levels than the Xj parameter. In other words, increas- ing the Xp parameter (i.e. padding thickness) tends to cfecrease the near-side occupant upper- rib peak G levels due to the negative sign on the X2 coefficient (i.e. -25.43 value). Conversely, increasing speeds (i.e. the X3 parameter) tends to increase the upper-rib peak G levels due to the positive sign on the X3 coefficient (this is consistent with the results obtained from field accident data surveys and studies). The low level of the Xi linear coefficient and the nega- tive sign on tnat term (i.e. -5.68 value) indi- cates that the optimized structural improvements, which were applied to the baseline 2-door VW Rabbits, tend to lower the upper-rib peak G levels by only a small fraction (about 1/5) of the amount which could be achieved through interior padding. This result is noted by Hackney et al. (3) when a subjective review of the raw test data showed that "in two of four conditions, peak rib accelerations increased when only optimized structure was added to the base- line vehicle." Even the X4 coefficient (angle of impact) plays a stronger role in reducing peak G values on upper rib than does the Xj coefficient. Examination of the interaction coefficients (i.e. X^Xj, X-jXjXjç, etc.) indicates that the strongest parameter interactions are between: Xj and X4 (structure and angle of impact); X2 and X3 (pad- ding and speed); and X^, X2 and Xo . Through the use of Eq. (1) it is also possible to predict upper rib peak G levels for conditions other than those tested by means of interpolations between the +1 and -1 values of the independent scaled parameters Xj through X^. A limited amount of extrapolation is also possible but care should be exercised in extrapolating too far beyond the +1 and -1 non-dimensional scaled values. As noted previously, a repeat test is normally run for each factorial test configuration, as well as at least four random repeats of a center point test configuration where each independent parameter is set to an average value (i.e. zero for the nondi- mensional scaled parameters). These repeat test values are used to obtain a statistical measure of the goodness of the data. If repeat tests with center points had been run for the configu- ration shown in Table 3, a total of 36 tests would have been required to obtain true statisti- cal reliability of the data. Examples given in the following section will demonstrate the statistical aspects of the factorial method and the advantage of the Box Behnken experimental design strategy which yields a higher order sta- tistically reliable response polynomial (i.e. second order) with fewer tests than the factorial method. PASSIVE OCCUPANT PROTECTION MATERIALS The importance of passive occupant protec- tion materials for reducing peak G levels and thorax injury producing loads in side-impact situations was demonstrated by the factorial analysis of the NHTSA Thorax Side Impact Protec- tion Research Program results presented in the previous section of this paper. Orringer, Knadle, and Mandeli (9), as well as Fan (10), Eppinger (4) and others (11), have conducted research on crash padding materials. Orringer notes that "materials selection tends to be a primary design variable due to limited (vehicle) interior space" (9). Also, selection or identi- fication of optimum passive occupant protection materials is made difficult by a number of fac- tors, not the least of which are the physical and biological variables inherent in defining injury levels and human response to impact. This paper does not address the nature of the physical and biological response parameters, or the interior space issues, but rather attention is directed toward demonstration of efficient and statistic- ally reliable experimental design strategies which will enable a more quantitative evaluation of passive occupant material performance. As a result, the group of materials examined in this study is not meant to be all-inclusive but merely representative of several typical energy- absorbing materials which may have potential for providing side-impact protection. A Wayne State University anthropomorphic headform, mounted on a twin-guide wire drop fix- ture located in the Northern Arizona University (NAU) Biomechanics Laboratory, was used as the mechanism for evaluating material performance in certain impact situations. A three-dimensional optoelectric motion digitizing and analysis sys- tem, termed the WATSMART system (12), was coupled to the headform, along with an accelerometer, to 4.416</page><page sequence="5">880397 monitor position, velocity and acceleration pa- rameters. The motion analysis system utilizes 5 mm diameter infrared light-emitting diode detectors (IREDs) and three video cameras to track and monitor the headform motion. The analog data is digitized at rates up to 4000 samples per second, buffered in memory on a PC computer, and then stored on disk. After data collection the raw data is transformed into three-dimensional coordinates. System software is used to process the data and obtain plots of specific kinematic variables if desired. Four types of energy-absorbing materials were evaluated in this study and these are listed in Table 4 as Ethafoam, Ensolite, Sorbothane and expanded bead polystyrene. No attempt was made in this study to address the issues of flammabil- ity, toxicity, etc., which were addressed in the NHTSA Hackney study (3). Material stiffness tests were conducted in the NAU Composite Materi- als Test Laboratory using an Instron servohydrau- lic controlled materials test machine. The above materials were tested at strain rates ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 per second, with strain levels up to 75 percent. The NAU results for Ensolite were consistent with those obtained by Orringer and Associates (9). With the exception of the ex- panded bead polystyrene materials, the materials of Table 4 demonstrated a capacity for shear load energy management. This was especially evident in the Sorbothane material. The General Tire and Rubber foam polyurethane, recommended by NHTSA (3), was not tested in this study due to time and cost limitations.

The term test parameter" is used synonymously with the term "independent variable" throughout the text of this paper. Table 5 lists the test con- figurations (trials) and corresponding values of each parameter used in the Ethafoam material example. The X2 parameter energy levels for the -1, 0 and +1 test conditions correspond respec- tively to impact velocities of 18.2, 22.3, and 25.8 kilometers per hour. These velocities cor- respond, respectively, to drop heights of 1.22 m (4'), 1.83 m (6') and 2.44 m (8'). Table 6 sum- marizes the measured peak G head impact values obtained for each of the test conditions identi- fied in Table 5, including repeat tests. Note (once again) that all tests, including repeat tests, were run in a random order. A total of 10 tests were run for this test series. Table 7 illustrates the computation matrix and standard scheme for calculating the two-level (high-low) factor effects or polynomial coefficients for the resultant empirical response function relating head impact peak G levels (dependent variable response) to the independent parameters Xj and Xo used in this example. The minimum number of trials "N" required to generate a two-level factorial response polynomial is determined from the relationship: N = 2P (5) where p equals the number of independent parame- ters (X.j) being evaluated. The order of the plus and minus signs in the computation matrix repre- sent the basis for calculating the factorial polynomial coefficients. The rows of the compu- tation matrix correspond to the N trials and the columns correspond to the coefficients of the factorial polynomial. The scheme for establish- Table 5.

For instance, the Xļ parameter uses an alternating sequence of minus and plus signs, whereas the successive X.¡ terms use alternating groups of minus and plus signs which increase by a factor of 2 for each successive X.¡ term. The Aq term (constant coefficient for the polynomial; re- quires all plus signs in the first column. The plus and minus signs relating to the columns of interaction coefficients (i.e. X^X., X^X-X^, etc.) are obtained by multiplying together tne corresponding signs of the individual X- terms in a given trial which make up the interaction coef- ficient. For instance, in Table 7 the X1X2 coef- ficient of Trial 1 has a plus sign wnich was obtained by multiplying the minus sign of the Trial 1 X^ term times the minus sign of the Trial 1 X2 term. Calculation of the actual polynomial coeffi- cients is carried out by first multiplying the experimental results for each trial times the corresponding plus and minus signs of the column representing the polynomial coefficient term desired. Next, the values obtained by the above multiplications are summed for the column or term being evaluated. Dividing the sum value by N yields the corresponding polynomial coefficient for that column. As an example, the Xļ column of Table 7 yields a sum value of -145.7 and division by N = 4 yields the Ai polynomial coefficient as -36.4. Table 8 illustrates a computation matrix for a three-parameter, two-level factorial poly- nomial . The results of the Ethafoam test series are given in the form of the response polynomial con- tained in Table 7 and shown below in Eq. (6). Getf = 179.2 - 36 .4Xļ + 58.5X2 + lOXjXg (6) The various coefficients of the polynomial indi- cate that, as expected, increasing the thickness of the foam material (i.e. X^ parameter) will lower peak G head impact levels; while increasing the head impact energy levels or impact veloci- ties (i.e. X« parameter) will increase the resultant peak 13 load levels. The statistical evaluation of the above Eq. (6) data is made possible through the use of the repeat tests and calculation of certain "signifi- cant factor effects" (SFE) as defined by Eq. (7) for a two-level factorial coefficient other than a0. SFE = "st (2/(pr))1/2 (7) The "s" term in Eq. (7) is defined as the pooled standard deviation for the test series; this term wilí be explained in more detail through the use of the Ethafoam test data. The "t" term repre- sents a student's "t" value (13) which is based on a desired probability level for the number of degrees of freedom used in the estimate of the s term. The "p" value corresponds to the number of plus signs in the columns of the coefficient computation matrix. The "r" term designates the number of replicates for each trial. The pooled standard deviation is used as a means to obtain statistical information on a larger and more meaningful database than would be possible by considering only one individual re- peat test of each variable. For instance the individual variances calculated for each of the trials of the Table 6 data yields the following: S? = 17.41; So = 1.45; S% = 154.88; and S| = 154.88. Eq. (8) represents the "pooled varia- tion" equation for an N trial experiment with fewer than five repeats for each trial: •™,&lt;ri - » s? Spooled = (8) where the S? terms represent the individual vari- ations calculated for each trial and the r- terms are the number of replicates of each trial. The denominator of Eq. (8) yields the "degrees of freedom" for the calculation and is used in the determination of the student t values. The square root of Eq. (8) represents the "pooled" standard deviation for the total experiment.

(8)). Using a 95 percent confidence level and the four degrees of freedom yields a „student t value of 2.78 (13). Substitution of s = 9.06, t = 2.78, r = 2, and p = 2 (i.e. number of plus signs in each column of the factorial coefficient computa- tion matrix) into Eq. (7) leads to a value of 17.8 for the Standard Factor Effect (SFE) of the Ethafoam experiments. In other words, the SFE of 17.8 indicates that the interaction term coeffi- cient (i.e. Aj2 = 10) is not a highly significant factor. A "Significant Factor Effect" is also used to estimate whether Curvature or non-linearity are significant. This factor effect, labeled as SFEC, is given in Eq. (9): SFEC = "št (l/(pr) + l/c)1/2 (9) where the s, t, p and r terms are defined in Eq. (7), and the "c" term represents the number of center point replicates. In the case of the Ethafoam test series the SFEC equation yields a value of 31.9. This term is compared to a cur- vature calculation to determine if non-linearity or curvature would make the linear factorial rep- resentation of test data invalid. The Curvature Effect (CE) is found by taking the difference between the Aq coefficient (i.e. 179.2 for the Ethafoam test series) and the mean value of center point test configurations (i.e Trial 5 in the Ethafoam test series). For the example being considered the CE value is calculated to be 9.1 which is much less than the SFEC term (31.9) thus indicating that the linear factorial representa- tion of equation (6) should be adequate to de- scribe the Ethafoam response between the range of values tested. At this point it should be noted that without the repeat tests and the statistical factors for significance, it would not be possi- ble to confidently determine if a linear factori- al representation was adequate to describe responses other than those tested. 4.419</page><page sequence="8">The two-level factorial method was also ap- plied to various thicknesses of Ensolite energy- absorbing materials. The energy levels used in this test series were identical to those used in the Ethafoam tests. Table 9 illustrates the test configurations and independent parameter values used in the Ensolite tests. Table 10 summarizes the measured peak G head-impact response for the trials shown in Table 9. Although the thicknesses used in the Enso- lite test series were only fractions (i.e. about 1/5 to 1/3) of the thicknesses used in the Etha- foam tests, the resulting response polynomials for both materials are quite similar. In view of the much thinner sections of the Ensolite as com- pared to Ethafoam, the results suggest that the Ensolite is a somewhat more efficient energy- absorbing or shock-impact attenuation material than Ethafoam. By means of extrapolations made with the response polynomials for each of the above mate- rials, a comparison was made of the predicted peak G head-impact response for each material if the thicknesses were identical. In this case a thickness of 2.22 cm (0.875") wa% chosen with an energy level of 188 Joules (140'"^). The value of 2.22 cm corresponds to an Xļ parameter of +1.5 for the Ensolite and -1.44 for the Ethafoam. The energy level corresponds to an fy parameter value of +1.0 for both materials. The resulting G levels predicted for the two materials under identi cal thi ckness/impact-energy conditi ons are calculated as 275.7 for the Ethafoam and 216.3 for the Ensolite. BOX-BEHNKEN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN METHODOLOGY The Box-Behnken Method (2) is a more accu- rate and efficient experimental design methodol- ogy than the factorial strategy presented in the previous section. In the Box-Behnken approach the output or response variable functional rela- tionship (i.e. peak G impact levels, etc.) is expressed in the form of an incomplete, second- degree, graduating polynomial of the independent variables, fitted by the method of least squares, and meeting certain criteria for rotatability and orthogonal blocking of independent variables or test factors. The above polynomial results in what is termed a response surface which, if desired, could be used to identify maximum and mini-mum levels of variables and combinations of Table 9.

The notion of rotatability stems from the fact that only random replicates of nominal or central values of independent test parameters are run to determine variation (or precision) with respect to the high and low values of each of the independent test parameters. It can be shown that this variation will remain essentially uniform from parameter to parameter. Eq. (10) shown below illustrates the general form of the Box-Behnken response surface poly- nomial . ^ ķ k k Y = bn 0 + z b,X, 1 1 + z z biĄ U X,X, 1 J 0 i=l z 1 1 1=1 z j=l z biĄ U 1 J (10) The Y term in Eq. 10 represents the dependent response function term and the X^ values, as in the factorial method, are the values of indepen- dent parameters scaled non-dimensionally such that +1 represents the highest level of the pa- rameter and -1 represents the lowest level value of the parameter (a value of zero indicates an average value for the parameter). The coeffi- cients bQ, bj and bj,- are termed regression coefficients and are obtained from the results of experimental tests conducted in a specific man- ner. For example, a three-variable Box-Behnken experimental design would require 15 tests to be run with the specific combinations of independent parameter levels shown in Table 11. The above test configurations would be run in a random order, just as was done in the factorial method, and the results of the tests would be used to compute the polynomial coefficients. Tables 12 and 13 illustrate, respectively, the Box-Behnken test configurations for four and five independent parameters or variables. The complete test matrix for four variables requires 27 tests and five variables requires 46 tests. Screening of variables by methods such as Plackett-Burman (14), to determine the most important variables, will assist in reducing the number of tests re- quired to generate a response surface polynomial of the form shown in Eq. (10). The method for developing appropriate test configurations for more than five variables or test parameters is contained in reference 2. As noted, the regression coefficients and respective variances are computed from the exper- imental results of tests conducted with specific combinations of the parameter levels, depending upon the number of independent parameters or test variables. Eq. (10) through (13) and Table 14 provide information necessary to calculate the regression coefficients for response surface polynomial functions with up to five variables or test parameters. The test configurations which employ only average values for each parameter are termed "center points" and it is only the "center points" which are tested for repeatabil ity in the Box-Behnken method. The results of the center point tests can be used to estimate the experi- mental error variance (a ). For the constant and Table 11. A Three-variable Box-Behnken Test Configuration.

Sorbothane, developed originally by BTR Industries in London, England, was used to demon- strate the Box-Behnken method. Sorbothane is a quasi-liquid polymer which behaves somewhat like an elastomer. The material is made from the liq- uids Polyol and isocyanate (which forms the basis for certain polyurethane thermoplastic compounds) 4.422</page><page sequence="11">880397 and has excellent shear di storti onal energy- absorbing capabilities. Although this material is extremely dense when compared to the Ensolite and Ethafoam materials discussed earlier, it has excellent shock-impact energy absorption charac- teristics in thin sections (i.e. 0.5 cm) and could provide head-impact protection along wind- shield headers, A and B pillars, door sills, and any other regions of the vehicle where size (i.e. thickness) constraints are likely to be problems. Table 15 lists the independent variables and levels used in the Sorbothane/Box-Behnken study. Table 16 illustrates the test configurations and corresponding experimental results for head- impacts into the Sorbothane. Table 15. Independent Variables and Levels Used in Sorbothane Material Tests. Variable Levels Independent Low Avg.

The use of Eqs. (10) through (13), and Table 14, results in the following non-linear response sur- face polynomial representation of the Sorbothane material head-impact G level response: Gsor = 199.6 + 4.95X1 - 20.2X2 + 43 .IX3 + 13.6Xj + 3.75X2 - 2.6X3 + 7.7XļX2 +6.6X3X3 - 2 .6X3X3 (14) As noted previously, the Xļ, X2, and X3 parameter values in Eq. (4) are non-dimensionaTized terms usually ranging between +1 and -1. Examination of the regression coefficients of the polynomial response function of Eq. (14) indicates that X3 (impact energy) is the strong- est linear parameter and that Xļ (stiffness) is the weakest of the linear terms. Contrary to the above, however, the Xj parameter (stiffness) indicates a highly non-linear contribution as compared to the effect of thickness and impact energy. It is also interesting to note that the thickness parameter Xo is the least significant of all parameters, indicating that thin layers of Sorbothane (i.e. 0.64 cm) are likely to be ade- quate for use in regions with tight dimensional or size constraints. Calculation of the approximate experimental error standard deviation "a" from the three center point test configurations (i.e. Trials 13, 14, and 15) yields a value of 10.14. The use of this a value with the regression coefficient standard error data equations given in Section B of Table 14 yields the following: V ( b0 ) = 5.86; V(bļ) = 3.59; Vibļļ) = 5.07; and Vfb^) = 5.86. The above error data suggests that the X| and X3 non-linear terms, and the X2X3 interaction term, are not significant factors in the G level re- sponse of the Sorbothane material. Another important aspect of the Sorbothane material is the low rebound characteristics of the polymer. Comparisons made of the kinematics associated with the highest energy level drop for both Ensolite and Sorbothane (which had identical thickness and energy levels as independent parameters) show approximately 50 percent lower rebound with the Sorbothane as compared to Ensol ite. In addition to the Sorbothane material the Box-Behnken experimental design strategy was also applied to expanded bead polystyrene materials. Table 16.

The range of energy levels used in this test series is somewhat greater than that used in the Sorbo- thane test series. Table 17.

(15) with Eq. (14) indicates that in contrast to the Sorbothane material the non-linear effect of the EBP stiffness term (Xj) is a negligible contributor to the head-impact G level response for the EBP material. Conversely, the energy term (X3) and thickness (X2) show strong non-linear contributions for this materi- al; however, not nearly as strong as the linear contributions for those parameters in the EBP. In order to illustrate the interpolation and extrapolation capability of the Box-Behnken meth- od, two additional tests were run on the expanded bead polystyrene material. In one test the density of the material was raised to a value of 0.048 g/cc (i.e. Xj = +2.0). In this test series the thickness parameter of the EBP was set at 2.54 cm (i.e. X2 = -1) and the energy level X3 was maximum (i.e. X3 = +1). The Eq. (15) head- impact G level for this test configuration pre- dicted a response of 392 G's, which was consider- ably higher (i.e. 33%) than the measured value of 293 G's. In part this large error in prediction can be attributed to the very high extrapolation value used with Xļ (i.e. Xļ = +2.0 in this test) and it is suggested that extrapolations be lim- ited to less than +150% of the independent varia- bles. The second additional EBP test gives an illustration of interpolation with the Box- Behnken approach. In this test a thickness of 3.8 cm is used (i.e. X2 = -0.5) along with an average level for density (Xļ = 0) and energy (X3 = 0). In this case the measured head-impact G level of 217 compares much more favorably with the Eq. (15) predicted G value of 267 (i.e. only 23% error or difference). Overall, however, the EBP material is considerably less effective than the Ethafoam, Ensolite and Sorbothane. SUMMARY Two standard test methods, the factorial (1) and the Box-Behnken approach (2), have been uti- lized to demonstrate how multi-variable effects on passive occupant protection materials could be efficiently analyzed with some statistical relia- bility. This paper did not attempt to address all of the key issues associated with the side- impact occupant protection problem; however, it is hoped that the methodology and information contained herein will be helpful to other trans- portation safety researchers interested in devel- oping quantitative measures on complex multi- variable problems which may include non-linear and variable interaction effects. The examples used in this paper were meant to illustrate how polynomial approximations could be used to obtain more than just an observation of experimental data. Also, it was demonstrated that the polyno- mial approximations could be used to interpolate and predict response of dependent variables for conditions not actually tested. It was also shown that rather simple polynomial approxima- tions can be used to interpolate with reasonable accuracy, but difficulties (i.e. much larger errors) can occur in these extrapolations. In spite of the advantages offered by the methods described in this paper, experimental investigations and analysis of conditions which exceed 4 or 5 variables quickly become expensive and cumbersome to run. On the other hand, good experimental design strategy requires that as many variables as possible be considered early on in a research program so as to minimize miscon- ceptions which may arise as the result of over- looking a key variable or the importance of the interactions of that variable with other inde- pendent variables. For this reason the authors of this study strongly recommend a preliminary screening study, such as the Plackett-Burman method (14), to identify key variables. For instance, with only 20 tests, the Plackett-Burman method allows screening of up to 12 variables to establish which variables are key parameters. With regard to the materials examined in this study, the low-density Ensolite material seems to be a likely energy-absorbing material for regions of vehicle interiors not drastically size constrained. When considering other factors such as flammability and toxicity, the Hackney study (3) has determined that the GTR polyure- thane foam is a more optimum padding material than the Ensolite or Ethafoam. In areas of the vehicle interior which are likely to be size constrained from adding thick layers of protec- tive padding, such as along windshield and door 4.424</page><page sequence="13">880397 headers or "A" pillars, etc., the Sorbothane results suggest this material as having good potential for providing impact-injury protection with limited thickness of material.
