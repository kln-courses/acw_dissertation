TOLSTOY'S GOD SEES THE TRUTH, BUT WAITS: A REFLECTION It is well known that in the latter half of the I 87os Tolstoy suffered an arrest of life. He relates in A Confession that the attempt to find a meaning in life that would be immune to death had almost led to his own suicide. He asks: 'Is there any meaning in my life that the inevitable death awaiting me does not destroy?'1 In this essay I wish to argue that Tolstoy, some years earlier, in a short story entitled, God Sees the Truth but Waits, had already suggested a possible answer to the question of the meaning of life; that he not only offered an answer but also gave an adequate depiction of how such an answer might work itself out in a life.2 In arguing for this position, I hope to show the following: (a) the importance of the story (i) for Tolstoy, and (ii) as a particularly useful way, both in itself and in particular for Tolstoy, of mapping such an answer; (b) that there is no single answer to this problem; Tolstoy's answer can be taken along with other answers as possibilities. (c) that Tolstoy's answer is not only a possible but also an adequate answer. Tolstoy and the Story (a) Thoughts about death, religion and meaning had occupied Tolstoy all through the I870s. The story itself was written some seven or eight years before Tolstoy's conversion. The importance of the story, however, does not rest solely on the fact that it does give some hint as to a possible future spiritual commitment by Tolstoy. The story itself takes on a greater meaning. When Tolstoy came to write What Is Art? and thereby to reflect on his own work, he dismissed all his writings with the exception of two stories, God Sees the Truth and The Prisoner of the Caucasus.43 For Tolstoy, the aim of art is to unite: universal art aims at sharing the simple feelings common to all (The Prisoner L. Tolstoy, A Confession and What I Believe (London: Oxford University Press, I921), p. 28. 2 L Tolstoy, God Sees the Truth, But Waits, in Twenty- Three Tales (London: Oxford University Press, '975). 3 L. Tolstoy, What Is Art? (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, I978), p. I55.</page><page sequence="2">76 DERMOT J. ARCHER of the Caucasus is placed in this category); religious art shares feelings of love for God and for man, and God Sees the Truth is located under this idea. Tolstoy tells us that the purpose of the artist is to transmit his own lived experiences and to evoke the same feelings in his audience. The supreme criterion of art is 'sincerity'. Tolstoy, then, claims to be attempting to convey, in his story, something personally felt. (b) The story is an ideal means of carrying out the task of displaying an answer. If Tolstoy wishes to show us a life and meaning in that life, the move from the abstract to the concrete particular can do such a task best. By developing a particular example he can show a whole way of life; the evolution of that particular attitude to life; what surrounds the response and the connection the character makes; the tenacity with which such a response is maintained in the face of trials which might, for someone other than the character, put it into question. Since such a response is held as an absolute for the character, the question of the meaning of life cannot even arise as a question for him.1 It is not only, however, a matter of Tolstoy himself being more successful when his beliefs on such a question are conveyed in the story. According to Wittgenstein, this is Tolstoy's only successful means. Wittgenstein writes: You see, when Tolstoy just tells a story he impresses me infinitely more than when he addresses the reader. When he turns his back on the reader then he seems to me most impressive. . . It seems to me his philosophy is most true when it's latent in the story.2 E. Anscombe tells us that when Wittgenstein speaks of people 'to whom the meaning of life has become clear' he also refers to those who have 'failed to state what they wished to state ... He probably had Tolstoy especially in mind'. When Tolstoy attempts to give accounts of his beliefs, such accounts are 'miserable failures'; he is only successful when the truths are 'manifested' in the story.3 There is no criticism, then, in Wittgenstein for what Tolstoy is attempting to show; on the contrary, these stories in the Twenty- Three Tales will 'live for ever'; we have there 'the essence of Christianity'.' What I have to say about this story is generally in agreement with Wittgenstein's comments. In the story, as I shall attempt to argue, finding ourselves in empathy with the main character, Aksenov, affects us more than do the views expressed in Tolstoy's later religious works. If we compare these later works, in which Tolstoy attempts to explain what he understands, with 1 See A. Flew, 'Tolstoi and the meaning of life', Ethics, LXXIII (1 963), I i o-I 8. R.

It is in the telling of the story, then, in showing rather than saying, that Tolstoy succeeds. II A Possible Answer? Tolstoy depicts the life of a character weighed down by pain and suffering and attempts to show such a life as meaningful. In this section I wish to examine the thoughts of one writer who denies that it is possible to show that a life such as this could be meaningful. In examining the response of four other writers I hope to be able to give reminders of the multiplicity of attitudes possible in deciding the meaningfulness of a particular life; to show that there is no unitary conception of what is worthwhile; that judgements of meaningfulness depend upon an absolute judgement of value. But firstly, the details of the life of Aksenov, the main character in this story. Aksenov is joined on a journey by another merchant. During the night while both are asleep this merchant is robbed and murdered. Aksenov is arrested; the bloodstained knife is found in his travel bag. He is found guilty at the trial. A petition to the Tsar proves fruitless. Tolstoy writes: 'Aksenov wrote no more petitions, gave up all hope ... He sees his family no more.' Aksenov had already spent twenty-six years imprisoned in Siberia when one day he falls into conversation with a new convict. From things said Aksenov realizes that this man, Semenich, is the one who had killed the merchant and planted the evidence. All sorts of memories crowd his mind: his own youth, his children, his dead wife. Tolstoy writes of her; 'He saw her as if she were present'. Aksenov longs for revenge. Very soon the opportunity for revenge arises when he catches Semenich in an escape bid; the tunnel is discovered and each prisoner is questioned. Aksenov does not inform on Semenich. Because of this action, Semenich is filled with remorse and asks forgiveness. He confesses the murder to the authorities but by the time Aksenov's pardon comes through, Aksenov is dead. Looking at Aksenov's life, his loss of family, his stunted existence, his life imprisonment, it might seem as if there is little worthwhile in it. A down-to-earth, no-nonsense, analytical philosopher might argue as follows. There is only one way in which we might look at the details of Aksenov's life and these are the criteria accepted by the ordinary man. A life is judged by what the person concerned can get out of it: the balance of happiness over unhappiness, pleasure over pain, bliss over suffering ... Armed with these criteria, we can compare the life of this man and that, and judge which is more</page><page sequence="4">78 DERMOT J. ARCHER worthwhile, which has a greater balance of bliss over suffering. But criteria alone enable us merely to make comparative judgements of value, not absolute ones. We can say which is more and which is less worthwile, but we cannot say which is worthwhile and which is not. In order to determine the latter, we must introduce a standard. But what standard ought we to choose? Ordinarily, the standard we employ is the average of the kind ... A good and worthwhile life is one that is well above average. A bad one is one well below.1 It would seein, therefore, that if Tolstoy is attempting in these particular circumstances to show a life that is meaningful, he is attempting the impossible. But do we have to accept the criteria and standard as set out by Kurt Baier? I wish to argue that (a) there are internal difficulties to be met if we do accept them; (b) it is not necessary to accept such criteria. The criteria and standard proposed by Baier to enable one to judge whether a life is meaningful might seem straightforward when taken in the abstract; but when we begin to try to measure the ordinary man's life, we see just how complex the task is. When we begin to evaluate the happy event against the unhappy, health against sickness, birth against death, good against evil, we see that there is no easy answer to the question whether or not an individual life is worthwhile. We begin to see that very often an individual life is more than the sum of its parts. We are engaged in a process of argument that cannot be taken as simply deductive, vertical. It is a matter of putting this beside that, seeing this in the light of that; reasoning here, instead of being vertical, like the links of a chain, will rather be, as John Wisdom describes it, horizontal, like the legs of a chair. For Wisdom what we have here is: Not a chain of demonstrative reasoning (but a) presenting and representing of those features of the case which severally co-operate in favour of... the conclusion, in favour of saying what the reasoner wishes said, in favour of calling the situation by the name by which he wishes to call it.2 It will be the cumulative effect, then, of lots of things clinging together and our either seeing or failing to see meaning there. Someone might argue, however, that here it can clearly be seen that we are dealing with an open and shut case. There is no weighing up to be done, because Aksenov's life is one of unmitigated suffering, well below the average and is therefore meaningless. I think, then, that a more drastic reappraisal of Baier's criteria is called for. The analysis has so far only raised internal difficulties. If we look at how four other writers would evaluate Aksenov's life we see an unwillingness to accept criteria such as Baier's. For them, happiness, pleasure, bliss, even at ecstatic levels, are not necessarily synonomous with meaning, the worthwhile. They remind us of other possibilities. ' K.

I57.</page><page sequence="5">TOLSTOY S GOD SEES THE TRUTH, BUT WAITS 79 (i) Camus I would regard Aksenov's life as absurd. For me it is suffering and death more than anything else which underline this absurdity. Aksenov came to life desiring unity. It is this hiatus between the desire for unity and an unresponding universe which is the absurd. Could the promise of justice and happiness in another world make recompense? For me, Aksenov cannot remedy his absurd situation by a leap of faith. Tolstoy tells us that Aksenov 'lost all hope'; he had encountered the absurd. To hope is to make a leap, and all hope is religious. To make a leap, to seek consolation in another world is to condone the injustice, to hand over the spoils to what would be an arbitrary God. Aksenov must rebel against a scheme of things in which there is suffering and death. Is rebellion then the last word? Can there be no happiness for Aksenov? There is such a thing as absurd happiness. This is the happiness we can experience, the only real happiness. Aksenov would find meaningful happiness in his authenticity; in love of this earth, his only Kingdom; most of all in the fight to uphold the dignity of his fellow-man. The position of Aksenov reminds me in some ways of that of Ivan Denisovich Shukhov. This is how Solzhenitsyn sums up a day in Ivan's life: Shukhov went to sleep fully content. He'd had many strokes of luck that day: they hadn't put him in the cells; they hadn't sent the team to the settlement; he'd pinched a bowl of kasha at dinner; the team-leader had fixed the rates well; he'd built a wall and enjoyed doing it; he'd smuggled that bit of hacksaw-blade through; he'd earned something from Tsezar in the evening; he'd bought that tobacco. And he hadn't fallen ill. He'd got over it. A day without a dark cloud. Almost a happy day.' (2) Marcel I agree that if suffering and death have the victory, Aksenov's life is meaningless. There is, however, something in the story that is a pointer, a hope. When Aksenov discovers that Semenich is the culprit he is filled with a desire for revenge. Shortly after this incident Tolstoy describes Aksenov's reflections. Aksenov is thinking about his dead wife. Tolstoy writes: 'He saw her as if she were present.' Something here makes me believe that if the bond was ruptured in this life, it will not be eternally so. I would describe this in terms of hope. When I talk of hope here I am not talking of hopingfor: for a certain state of affairs; nor hope that: that something will come about. Hope here is an openness towards the future. Aksenov does not give way to despair, because he remains in a state of disponibility. As far as his view of himself is concerned, therefore, he does not become an object for himself, 'a prisoner'. As far as his relationship with his wife is concerned, his dead wife does not become someone he might have possessed. In this latter relationship, we are talking in terms of oblative love. He saw her 'as if she were present'; not as he remembered her; we are not dealing here with a memory which fades. Hope stems from the presential nature of the relationship. Presence is not dependent on proximity and proximity does not entail presence. Spatio-temporal concepts are not sufficient to describe such a relationship, which is neither objective nor subjective; she was not an object before Aksenov nor a memory within him, but with-him. 1 A.

Solzhenitsyn, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (London: Victor Gollancz, I975), p. 190.</page><page sequence="6">8o DERMOT J. ARCHER After this reflection Aksenov finds it in himself to forgive Semenich. We are talking here of a help which is totally gratuitous. It is best described as an influx, an enrichment; an object or image could not have such an effect. Will such a love endure? Could Perfect Love be eternally impervious to their love? It is because of hope that I do not despair for Aksenov.' (3) Hick It would certainly seem to me that Aksenov's life is only meaningful if we do talk about another world; I would even want to say about other worlds. First of all I want to say that our human relationships are dependent upon our mortality and are ended by it. It is true to say that what happened to Aksenov is terrible but we only get a clear picture if we see his existence in this life as merely one stage in God's process of bringing a distanced world in perfection to himself. It is unlikely that a given individual, being free, could be brought to perfection in one existence span. Aksenov certainly needs less time than Semenich to reach this state of perfection, though Aksenov's attitude to his misfortune does provide Semenich with an opportunity to change. It would seem necessary, then, to envisage not one existence, but many, many worlds, many pareschatological existences for God's purpose to work itself out, for forgiveness and love to win. To attempt to judge Aksenov's life in this world is merely to judge one rung of a ladder. Aksenov, Semenich, all are engaged in a process which will ultimately lead to their true eschaton.2 (4) Edwards As far as talk of Aksenov's life being meaningful within the context of an afterlife, I find at the very least the evidence for such a life to be non-existent. I would even question whether such a concept is meaningful. If we look, moreover, at the evil in this life, we have no reason to suppose that a morally perfect God, if He did exist, would have anything better to offer next time, in an afterlife. If He existed, and could have done anything to stop such evil he would, or should. Let us take the case of Aksenov. To allow murder was evil enough; but to have someone else take the blame and consequently to ruin a second life is horrific: Aksenov says to Semenich: 'You killed me long ago'. It is not, however, what happens to Aksenov which might make his life lack worth but what he might do to himself. What if he should forgive Semenich, for example? Forgiveness of Semenich here or in a hereafter would rather emphasize the moral spinelessness of the one wronged. The individual must persist both in refusal of forgiveness and in a refusal of such happiness as would degrade him as a moral being. What happened did happen; forgiveness here or in a hereafter or a conferred happiness cannot change that. Even if Aksenov should forget in another life what had been done to him, forgotten wrongs are still wrongs. Aksenov's life would lose its meaning if he should surrender his moral integrity, either here or hereafter.3 G.

In response to Baier's criteria for meaningfulness, I have examined how four writers might view Aksenov's life. In looking at how they would evaluate whether a life has meaning or not it was clearly seen that it was, for them, not a simple matter of weighing happiness, pleasure and bliss against unhappiness, pain and suffering. In each case an absolutejudgement of value was made as to what confers real meaning, real worth on a life. When we fill in the details of Tolstoy's story, we see there also an absolute judgement about the type of life that is meaningful. Aksenov, in living and dying in the love of God, achieves all. The question of the meaning of life does not arise for Aksenov as a question because things are judged not in the light of how they are for him but in the light of how they are for God. Having examined the importance of the story and having stressed that the answer to the meaning of life depends upon an absolute judgement of value, and that there can be a multiplicity of such judgements, including the one we find in this story, I wish now to set out criteria for the adequacy of such a response as the one given here. (a) Structural adequacy If the story is to be structurally adequate, it must be consistent. If the story is to point to an answer to the meaning of life the way of seeing things must be able to carry the reader through to the end of the story; there must be no prefabrication as far as incident is concerned; if the main character is to carry the weight of the answer there must be no sleight of hand in portraying his reaction to the events which befall him. (b) Religious adequacy If the answer is a religious one certain prerequisites are necessary. (i) If the religious response to the problem of the meaning of life is to be taken seriously such a response must be free from blunders. Belief, truth, how one acts, what one expects, etc., will differ according to the language game being played. For example, religion here must certainly be free from some of the blunders found in Tolstoy himself in his later religious writings where (a) reasonable and spiritual become synonomous (b) religion provides peace, well-being, spiritual happiness.' (2) The answer must go deep. It will be part of further surroundings, of a form of life. Pat answers will be ruled out, instead they will be such as to dig deep roots into happenings, activities, into the life of the individual. I L. Tolstoy, On Life and Essays on Religion (London: Oxford University Press, I950). (i) 'What is Religion?', p. 254; (ii) 'Reason and Religion', p. I99; (iii) 'The Teaching of Jesus', p. 354.</page><page sequence="8">82 DERMOT J. ARCHER (3) The answer must be all-encompassing; it must regulate for all in the character's life. Wittgenstein speaks here of a 'picture' which will be constantly before the character's mind, a criterion against which he measures himself.1 If the answer, then, is to be an adequate answer to the question of the meaning of life it must be such an answer as to be able to regulate for anything which may befall the character. In examining Aksenov's life in prison we see his submission to the will of God: his spiritual reading; his peacemaking activities; his prayer. There are, however, two episodes in the story where Aksenov's response is put to the test; it is in paying attention to these two episodes that we see the nature of Aksenov's spirituality and how he is unconditionally bound to it, come what may. First, Aksenov has the chance of revenge on Semenich by informing the Governor of who it was who was responsible for the escape bid; secondly, Semenich seeks forgiveness from Aksenov. Makar Semenich stood as if he were quite unconcerned, looking at the Governor and not so much as glancing at Aksenov. Aksenov's lips and hands trembled, and for a long time he could not utter a word. He thought 'Why should I screen him who ruined my life? Let him pay for what I have suffered. But if I tell, they will probably flog the life out of him and maybe I suspect him wrongly. And after all, what good would it be to me?' 'Well, old man,' repeated the Governor, 'Tell us the truth: who has been digging under the wall?' Aksenov glanced at Makar Semenich and said, 'I cannot say, your Honour. It is not Gods will that I should tell! Do what you like with me; I am in your hands.' After Aksenov had discovered that Semenich was the one who framed him he had spent much time in prayer: 'he kept saying prayers all night, but could get no peace'. We can see Aksenov's refusal to redress the balance as a direct result of his dark nights of prayer. When one prays it is already decided what the good for one is: the good is God's will and revenge could not logically be part of God's will. When Aksenov asks himself: 'And after all, what good would it be to me?' he is not using morally neutral language. Someone not bothered by moral considerations might decide that revenge was the good, good to even the score, good to get your own back on Semenich. When Aksenov asks what 'good' will it be 'to me', this 'to me' means to the sort of man I am. The sort of man portrayed is one bound unconditionally to a religious morality. This is why Aksenov suffers none of the dilemmas over revenge that we find in Hamlet. For Hamlet, revenge is a good. We find him 'chiding himself for his dull revenge', vowing 'my thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth .2 It might be argued that Hamlet sees revenge in a completely different light; but this is not the case. Christian considerations weigh heavily with Hamlet but at the same time he does not question the I L. Wittgenstein, Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology and Religious Belief (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, I970), p. 56. 2 W. Shakespeare, Hamlet (London: Penguin Books, 1970), pp. I I6-7.</page><page sequence="9">TOLSTOY S GOD SEES THE TRUTH, BUT WAITS 83 fact that it is his duty to avenge his father's murder. What, then, do we have in Hamlet? P. Cruttwell writes: 'What we have in Hamlet is an extraordinary muddle of two moralities, one avowed, the other not avowed, but both playing heavily and continuously on the central character.'1 What we have there is not a dilemma within a moral system where two equally compelling duties compete for pride of place but a clash of two moralities. We see, then, that unlike Hamlet, the will of God is Aksenov's only criterion. No doubt Tolstoy also saw here something evil in the punishment which would be meted out to Semenich; for Tolstoy, such punishment is evil in itself and cannot destroy evil even if such punishment is carried out by the state. But he also saw something more than a simple refusal to take revenge on Aksenov's part. The positive reason is reconciliation. As he was to command later in his What I Believe: 'Try in advance to destroy any enmity between yourself and others that it may not flame up and destroy you.'2 This command of reconciliation leads into the second questioning of Aksenov's response. 'Ivan Dmitrich,' said he, 'forgive me! For the love of God forgive me! I will confess that it was I who killed the merchant, and you will be released and can go to your home.' ' It is easy for you to talk, ' said Aksenov, 'but I have suffered for you these twenty-six years. Where could I go to now? My wife is dead, and my children have forgotten me. I have nowhere to go.' Makar Semenich did not rise, but beat his head on the floor, 'Ivan Dmitrich, forgive me!' he cried. 'When they flogged me with the knout it was not so hard to bear as it is to see you now .., yet you had pity on me and did not tell. For Christ's sake forgive me, wretch that I am!' And he began to sob. When Aksenov heard him sobbing he, too, began to weep. 'God willforgiveyou!' said he, 'Maybe I am a hundred times worse than you'. And at these words his heart grew light and the longing for home left him. He no longer had any desire to leave the prison, but only hoped for his last hour to come. In spite of what Aksenov had said, Makar Semenich confessed his guilt. But when the order for his release came, Aksenov was already dead. I want to argue that here again in his forgiveness Aksenov submits to the will of God, desires God's will.3 I wish to examine in detail Aksenov's last words: 'God will forgive you!' said he. 'Maybe I am a hundred times worse than you.' He does not say: 'I will forgive you.' Does Aksenov then in some way refuse forgiveness to Semenich? I wish to examine several examples of how the words 'God will forgive you' might be used in answer to someone seeking forgiveness. P p.

ARCHER 'God willforgiveyou': possible misunderstandings (a) The blasphemer The blasphemer refuses forgiveness. He says: 'God will forgive you' but with a sneer he holds up to ridicule what he regards as the all too easy forgiveness the sinner can acquire if he repents to God. He knew the game once but does not like it as he remembers it. We might compare the following two statements: 'Bring your sins to God, He'll forgive you.' 'Plead guilty to Justice Lummus, he'll acquit you.' Advice is not being given here; a moral judgement is being made about the activity; notice the tone of voice. In the latter statement ajudgement is being made about the American judicial system of acquittal though guilty and Lummus's belief in leniency if one does so plead.' The two statements above, while alike in surface grammar are, however, different. One could hold such acquittal up to ridicule, support both less lenient justices and some parts of thejudicial system, yet still believe in the existence ofJustice Lummus. Could we make similar points about the blasphemer? Could we say that someone who no longer believed in forgiveness, who moreover held God's forgiveness up to ridicule, still believed in God, was still religious? Aksenov on the other hand, is a deeply religious man. (b) The Pharisee The Pharisee claims to believe in forgiveness; in a sense he too is a deeplv religious man. He says: 'God will forgive you' because he wishes to by-pass himself; he is too proud to bring himself in. He shows condescension here; it is not for him to be reconciled to a sinner. He thinks that his line to God is vertical, that he can by-pass what Simone Weil calls one necessary form of the implicit love of God: love of neighbour.2 I will show later, in what I have to say about Aksenov's humility, that Aksenov is not the Pharisee. (c) The literalist The literalist too says: 'God will forgive you '; his God is the Supreme Being who keeps the account books. God literally sees all; it is only He who can See D.J. Newman, Conviction (Boston and Toronto: Little, Brown and Co., I966), p. 76. 2 S.

In another context Tolstoy describes the literalist as one who says he does believe but does not; what he really believes is 'the credulous acceptance of assertions'. He compares him to the man who claims not to believe but really does. Tolstoy writes: The well-known preacher, Pere Didon, in the introduction to his Vie de Jfsus-Christ, announces that he believes, not in some allegorical sense but plainly, without explanation, that Christ, having risen, was carried up into the sky and sits there at the right hand of his father. An illiterate Samara peasant of my acquaintance in reply to the question whether he believed in God, simply and firmly replied, as his priest told me: 'No, sinner that I am, I don't believe.' He explained his disbelief in God by saying that one could not live as he was living if one believed in God: 'A man scolds, and grudges help to a beggar, and envies, and over-eats, and drinks strong drink. Could he do such things if he believed in God?' Pere Didon evidently does not even know what faith is, and only says he believes; while the Saimara peasant knows what faith is and though he says he does not believe in God, really believes in Him in the very way that is true faith.' Aksenov, on the other hand, is no literalist; he does not look forward to any auditor's report. If Aksenov means none of these things, what does he mean? I wish to examine in some detail one particular interpretation of Aksenov's words. One of the few critics to write about this particular story, E. B. Greenwood, in his book, Tolstoy: The Comprehensive Vision, considers Aksenov's attitude adequate as far as the story goes, but religiously inadequate; in other situations, in a story with a different ending such an attitude would not suffice. Greenwood writes: Aksenov sobs and says, 'God will forgive you! Maybe I am a hundred times worse than you.' Semenich goes ahead and confesses, but by the time Aksenov's pardon arrives Aksenov is dead. There is no suggestion that he, like Lazarus, goes to Abraham's bosom while Semenich goes to Gehenna. The ethic is an immanent one. Semenich's remorse is his hell and Aksenov's refusal to judge ('God will forgive you') is his heaven. This is deeply moving, but does it go far enough? What if Semenich had remained unrepentant to the end and mocked Aksenov for being soft-hearted?2 I have been attempting to argue in this section that Tolstoy depicts the life of someone who breathes in God, who desires God's will. While I find Aksenov's 'refusal to judge' spiritually significant, there seems to be an infinite difference between the words Aksenov might have used here, 'God will judge you', and the 'God will forgive you' which he does actually use. Before attempting to say something more definite on this point, I wish to look at the difficulties to which Greenwood himself refers. 'This is deeply moving, ' L. Tolstoy, 'An appeal to the Clergy' in On Life and Essays on Religion, p. 298-9. 2 E. B. Greenwood, Tolstoy: The Comprehensive Vision (London: J. M. Dent and Sons, I975), p. I28.</page><page sequence="12">86 DERMOT J. ARCHER but does it go far enough? What if Semenich had remained unrepentant to the end and mocked Aksenov for being soft-hearted?' Greenwood seems to be making the point here that Aksenov's life might have remained futile, meaningless, i.e. his heaven was dependent upon a contingent state of affairs: Semenich's request for forgiveness. If Semenich had remained unrepentant, Aksenov would not have had a chance to refuse to judge him ('God will forgive you'); he, therefore, would not have had his heaven (in the absence of a heaven in a life-after-death). Therefore: if unrepentance, if mockery, if no happiness here or herafter, then what is the purpose of it all? According to my criteria, if this was the case there would not have been a depiction of a life meaningful whatever happens. The picture would not be adequate. But is this so? It is only this way if Greenwood's interpretation of the story is accepted. It is my contention that the story is adequate; that Greenwood interprets Aksenov's words as a refusal tojudge when they should be taken at face value: as words of forgiveness. Aksenov in the words he uses shows love towards Semenich, an eternal love. In what follows I wish to show how Christianity has thought that such an eternal love is immune to someone's failure to repent, to mockery, or to anything that may continue 'to the end'. What if Semenich had remained unrepentant and mocked Aksenov to the end? In his Works of Love Kierkegaard tells us that mockery is no stranger to Christianity; that the Christian should not be upset by mockery, when in fact Christianity added a new dimension to mockery.' Kierkegaard takes the case of Peter as paradigmatic. (i) Christ was mocked by the mob. (ii) He was further mocked when Peter, the one he loved, denied him. (iii) Mockery received a new expression when Christ not only did not even turn his glance from this Peter, this 'traitor', but continued to love him to the end. Someone might respond that the case with Peter was different from other cases; Christ had a good reason for his attitude. John Wisdom, for example, in another context, gives the following as an interpretation of Christ's action, 'He knew that Peter would deny Him but then, in the man who lacked the courage to stand by Him, He saw also the man who would later die for what he believed to be the truth."21But what if Peter had not stood by Christ in the end, would Christ not have continued to love him? What held Christ fast was not the promise of some future change in Peter. With reference to Aksenov and Semenich then it would not be a matter of Aksenov waiting for Semenich to change, to seek forgiveness from him 1 S.

I4I.</page><page sequence="13">TOLSTOY S GOD SEES THE TRUTH, BUT WAITS 87 before he could love him but in loving him bringing about a change. Kierkegaard never tires of repeating that it is not change which brings love but love which brings change. Even if Semenich had remained unrepentant to the end and mocked Aksenov, Aksenov would have continued to love. Such a love is unconditional and eternal. Kierkegaard assures us: In eternity, no mockery shall wound the lover saying that he was foolish enough to make himself ridiculous by hoping all things, for in eternity the cry of the mocker is not heard. If mockery is not heard in eternity, is love? How then should the love which abides waste away? Can, then, immortality become weak? But what is it which gives a human being immortality, what else but the love which abides?' I think that Greenwood misses, as a possible interpretation of the story, the interpretation I have given because he is limited by what he sees as a possibility for Christianity. He writes in the paragraph following the one to which I have referred: The reason why one should obey the demands ofJesus is the perfectly rational one that only by doing so can onefind true happiness. Tolstoy is not afraid of any Kantian rigorist accusing him here of eudaemonism or too much concern with happiness as a goal, for he thinks, and surely he is right, that Jesus himself promises that goodness will be rewarded by happiness in the end.. Jesus promises happiness as a reward for goodness and yet we can only be truly good by putting goodness before happiness. We cannot know that we will win in the end. It is a case of the biblicalfiducia again. Have we any hint that Aksenov was concerned about (a) finding true happiness, (b) putting goodness before happiness, (c) winning in the end? I think not. Another critic, G. Jahn, gives a different interpretation from that of Greenwood. For him, Aksenov's 'heaven' does not lie in his refusal to judge Semenich, but in the joy and contentment Aksenov experiences after his protecting and forgiving Semenich. He writes: The material man can aspire no higher than mirth, ebullience and self-satisfaction; the spiritual man aspires tojoy and contentment ... Only after the second great shock, his protecting and finally his forgiving Makar, did his spiritual nature come to full expression.2 Jahn is caught in the same web as Greenwood. If Semenich had remained unrepentant, Aksenov could not have had his joy and contentment, there would have been no spiritual nature to come to full expression. Here, Aksenov's spirituality does not show itself in the act of forgiveness, it comes 1 S. Kierkegaard, Works of Love, pp. 246 and 289. 2 G. R. Jahn, 'A structural analysis of L. Tolstoy's "God Sees the Truth But Waits"', Studies in Short Fiction, xiI (I975), 26I-9 (267).</page><page sequence="14">88 DERMOT J. ARCHER after in the joy and contentment. One could imagine someone saying: the full expression of Tolstoy's artistry shows itself in the contentment he felt looking at his books. Would we not say rather that such forgiveness is an expression of his spirituality? It seems to me that neither Aksenov nor Christianity is concerned with finding peace, happiness or contentment, but with what Kierkegaard calls willing the one thing: the Good.' Aksenov might have willed the good for the following reasons. (a) That he himself might win. Greenwood says that 'we cannot know that we will win in the end'. But the man who wills the good that he might win is doubleminded: he uses the good for his own ends, and might still lose. (b) That the good might win through him. But what if the good does not win through him? This was again the case Greenwood referred to with reference to Semenich. He might not have asked forgiveness of Aksenov. In this case, one wills both the good and the preference of oneself for the good to win through; still doubleminded. (c) That the good might win. In this case Aksenov would not will a victory for himself but he would will the good as victorious. For Kierkegaard this is still doublemindedness. We must distinguish between the good and the good in its victory. The man who wills the good as victorious wishes 'to take the good by storm'; but the good wins in its own time. (d) For the good to a certain degree. Here a man has a belief in and feeling for the one thing. He thinks, however, that life, if it does not provide a justification for his willing of the one thing, should at least be in harmony with such a choice. In Aksenov's case, as we see, happiness, peace, contentment may not come. In similar circumstances, if these do not come to the man who wills the good only up to a certain degree, he becomes ambivalent in his action, doubtful in his commitment. (e) For the good itself In this final part I will attempt to show how Aksenov wills the good. In examining Aksenov's first trial, i.e. Aksenov's chance to seek revenge, I had ended by suggesting that Aksenov, through his refusal, was already seeking reconciliation before being asked for forgiveness by Semenich. It was Aksenov's refusal of revenge that brought Semenich to seek forgiveness. As God loved first, so did Aksenov. I have already examined some ways in which Aksenov's words to Semenich when Semenich sought forgiveness might be misunderstood. Aksenov uses the words: 'God will forgive you' to Semenich. What is the significance of these as opposed to 'I will forgive you'? If we look again at Kierkegaard on forgiveness we see why God must come between Aksenov and Semenich. God must stand between both Aksenov's 'victory' over Semenich and Semenich's humility towards Aksenov; they ' S. Kierkegaard, Purity of Heart Is To Will One Thing (Ne,i York: Harper and Row, 1956).</page><page sequence="15">TOLSTOY S GOD SEES THE TRUTH, BUT WAITS 89 both stand equal facing God. In this way Aksenov can show generosity towards Semenich while remaining equal in what might well be an unequal relationship. Semenich accepts this in 'gratitude' realizing that it is due to generosity; as a human being he can accept it without submission to Aksenov. Kierkegaard tells us that the one from whom forgiveness is sought must 'hide himself' .' For Simone Weil we have here in operation the supernatural virtue of justice; Aksenov imitates the creator. The desire for vengeance is a desire for balance. To imitate the creator, on the other hand, is to desist from exercising one's power, 'not to command wherever one has power to do so', to descend."2 To reinforce this point on forgiveness Aksenov adds: 'Maybe I am a hundred times worse than you'. I spoke of the need for Aksenov and Semenich to stand in a relationship of equality before God. What, then, is the meaning of Aksenov's final words? Do they not deny this equality? Simone Weil gives perfect expression to an attitude such as that of Aksenov. She writes as follows. One must believe oneself to be beneath others in order to bring oneself round to the point where one regards oneself as their equal and does not prefer oneself. Since it is impossible to prevent oneself from imagining a hierarchical order, a ladder amongst human beings (and perfection consists in not imagining it) one must place oneself on the lowest rung so as to avoid being situated above any other human being in one's own estimation. By dint of maintaining oneself on the lowest rung, the ladder disappears. 3 Tolstoy shows a possible answer to the question of the meaning of life, an answer, moreover, which is both adequate and religiously deep. 1 S.
