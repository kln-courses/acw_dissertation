<plain_text><page sequence="1">Byron's Lapse into Orthodoxy: An Unorthodox Reading of Cain WOLF Z. HIRST LTHOUGH Byron repeatedly protested the orthodoxy of Cain (1821), the vast majority of critics regard his play as unorthodox, iconoclastic, or downright sacrilegious.1 I propose to demonstrate that this work is not a blasphemous vindication of man's rebellion against a malignant deity, but rather a Biblical drama reflecting Divine inscru- tability. This paper does not deal with sectarian doctrines2: by using the 1. Truman G. Steffan, Lord Byron's "Cain": Twelve Essays and a Text with Variants and Annotations (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1968) surveys Byron's view of his play (pp. 6-12), summarizes critical opinion from 1821 to 1965 (pp. 289-296, 309-470), and sides with the majority. A briefer summary of 1822 criticism is given by John D. Jump, Byron (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1972), pp. 175-182, who calls Cain "deliberately impious" (p. 183), a frontal assault on "received beliefs" (p. 166). In "Byron: A Pilgrim's Progress," The Byron Journal, 2 (1974), 8, Andrew Rutherford still describes Cain as an "indictment of the ways of God to men." Bernard Blackstone in Byron: A Survey (London: Longman, 1975), p. 244, characterizes the play's theme as follows: "'God made man, let us hate him.' " David Eggenschwiler, "Byron's Cain and the Antimythological Myth," Modern Language Quarterly, 37 (1976), 333, 337, calls the God of Cain a "Nobodaddy" and a vindictive tyrant, even if in Cain's case "the vindictiveness is just"; and Irene Tayler, "Blake meets Byron on April Fool's," English Language Notes, 16 (1978), 90o, sees Him as "a Power at once ruthless and, at best, amoral." To this day perhaps the best defense of the play against irreligion is still "Harroviensis," A Letter to Sir Walter Scott (London: Rodwell and Martin, 1822), an excellent analysis though occasionally marred by conventional pieties. The argument of this pamphlet was "conclusive" for Byron, who intended to append it to the drama in the next edition. See The Works of Lord Byron: Letters and Journals, ed. Row- land E. Prothero (London: John Murray, 1898-1901), vi, 49, 54, 60-61 (hereafter cited as LJ). My quotations from the text of Cain are from Steffan's edition. 2. These have been discussed by various commentators. William H. Marshall, for example, in The Structure of Byron's Major Poems (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1962), claims that Byron "reverses the terms of the Manichaean thesis" (p. 150), so that "Cain appears to be far more heretical than perhaps its most violent critics in Byron's day suspected" (p. 185). Steffan lists the elements of "the corpus of Calvinist and orthodox belief..., the creed that Byron assailed or rejected in his drama" (pp. 26-28).

I shall first show that even if Cain, as Byron's self-projection, argues better than Abel, his blasphemies are undercut by the play's structure and tone; second, that although Cain is a glorified Romantic rebel, he is portrayed in a spirit compatible with the Bible's; third, that the drama depicts no malevolent God; and finally, that the viewpoint conveyed in Cain is not typical of Byron's work. My dis- cussion will throw light on the play's ironies, the nature of Biblical drama, the poetical treatment of the question of theodicy, and the "Byronic hero." I It has often been falsely assumed, in Byron's times and in ours, that since Cain's sacrilegious utterances reflect the author's views they may be taken as stating the work's doctrine, but an analysis of the ironic pattern in the play will establish that although Byron projects himself into his hero, Cain retains sufficient dramatic objectivity3 to bring it closer to a conventional justification of God's ways to men than to the iconoclastic attacks voiced by its protagonist. The latter's evolution from uncompromising pride to relative resignation follows the classical development of the tragic hero against the thesis developed by Stephen L. Goldstein in "Cain and the Painites," Studies in Romanticism, 14 (1975), 410, that Byron's play "could advance the implications of geology and of science in general, thereby weakening the position of conservatives in religion," but against the traditional view, repeated in a passing reference, that Byron "indict[s] a benevo- lent Creator for his wanton destruction of his own works" (p. 406). I agree with G. Wilson Knight's judgment in Byron and Shakespeare (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1966), p. 306, that Byron "does not write as an orthodox devotee, but he does write with full respect for the myth," and with the conclusion of C. M. Woodhouse in "The Religion of an Agnostic," The Byron ournal, 6 (1978), 32, that Byron "held no specific faith, but was possessed by a passionate spirit of religious enquiry." 3. Steffan, pp. lo-11, quotes Byron's repeated denials that he shares the irreligion of his characters and adds: "Almost no critic in 1822 or thereafter was willing to allow Byron's claim to dramatic objectivity." Steffan himself asserts that both Lucifer and Cain at times voice Byron's opinions (pp. 49, 57), yet on the whole treats the two as characters in a dra- matic context. How one-sided some readings of Cain are still today is illustrated by Steffan's reviewer in the Times Literary Supplement, who takes the scholar to task for maintaining that the characters indeed speak for themselves (13 November 1969, p. 1298).</page><page sequence="3">An Unorthodox Reading of Cain 153 from hubris4 through peripeteia to anagnorisis: like Oedipus, Cain, ironi- cally, achieves the opposite of what he intends, for he too acts in ignorance "maddened" by "a dreary dream" (111.378-379). Spiritually blinded by his pride, he causes the death of a close relative, and then gains moral insight and self-recognition as he faces a God Who remains as inscrutable as ever. In the course of this process he becomes at least vaguely aware of the irony of his actions. Few literary episodes are more pregnant with irony than the act of fratricide in Byron's drama. The irony of Cain's surrender to fury, to irrationality, after vainly pleading with his brother for reason, is enhanced by the circumstance that Cain's murderous frame of mind was caused by Lucifer, the advocate of reason. Cain felt cursed unjustly and taunted his parents with their expulsion from Eden for eating of the tree of knowl- edge, with rashly causing mortality; yet Cain himself effects a new curse, Cain's own quest of knowledge made him ally himself with Lucifer, and Cain recklessly brings death into the world. Though denouncing animal offerings for God he sacrifices a human victim to his own rebellious nature (an irony reinforced by "the imagistic framework of the drama"),5 after harping on the theme of innocent suffering he makes the innocent Abel and Zillah suffer, and having vainly longed for more satisfactory com- munion with his fellow men he now asks in despair: "Who makes me brotherless?" (111.335). Restless and never at peace with himself, he has acted as if branded by an imaginary mark of Cain, at last earning the real mark which is set upon his brow. This accumulated irony undercuts Cain's blasphemies; his sacrilege is not the play's. Inasmuch as the hero is the author's self-portraiture, the ironic attitude makes clear how inadequate Byron felt his impious senti- ments to be. But we must treat Cain, the basically noble but flawed hero, as tragic protagonist. Although the play may fall short of tragedy in some respects, it fits Richard B. Sewall's definition of the tragic vision, which 4. I use the term "hubris" in its accepted sense, although Walter Kaufmann argues co- gently against it in Tragedy and Philosophy (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1968), pp. 64-68. 5. Paul Elledge, Byron and the Dynamics of Metaphor (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1968), pp. 141-142. In his article, "Byron: Troubled Stream from a Pure Source," ELH, 42 (1975), 629, Leslie Brisman makes a subtle point: "In a terrible irony, even the soil is alienated from Cain when it absorbs Abel's blood; as a vagabond, Cain will be estranged from the earth he had thought most truly his own."</page><page sequence="4">154 Keats-Shelley Journal "sees man as questioner, naked, unaccommodated, alone, facing myste- rious, demonic forces in his own nature and outside, and the irreducible facts of suffering and death," and which "impels the man of action to fight against his destiny, kick against the pricks, and state his case before God and his fellows."6 The ironic treatment of Cain's hubris, again true to the classical pattern, tends to vindicate the powers against which the hero arose and to reaffirm the cosmic order. Cain has been falsely credited with a "Satanism" which is condemned by its very logic. Byron's own analysis in his letter of 3 September 1821 to John Murray casts Lucifer as tempter preparing the catastrophe: Cain is a proud man: if Lucifer promised him kingdoms etc., it would elate him; the object of the Demon is to depress him still further in his own estimation than he was before, by showing him infinite things and his own abasement, till he falls into the frame of mind that leads to the Catastrophe, from mere internal irritation, not premeditation, or envy of Abel (which would have made him contemptible), but from the rage and fury against the inadequacy of his state to his conceptions, and which discharges itself rather against Life, and the author of Life, than the mere living.7 Cain's dejection is caused by a discrepancy between the consciousness of his own insignificance (n.ii.420-421) and the infinite world encompassed by his imagination (n.i.98-1o9), between his real "state" and his ideal "conceptions." By guiding him through space and Hades, Lucifer stimu- lates both Cain's yearning for knowledge and his sense of limitation, thus aggravating his "internal irritation," and if such a "frame of mind" leads to disaster, Lucifer is the scheming tempter of orthodox tradition. But critics ignore, misinterpret, or reject Byron's own interpretation and see the demon as representing the rational good opposing human frailty within Cain. Leslie A. Marchand, for example, takes the extreme view that "the roles of god and devil are reversed, for Lucifer is a champion of the 'good principle.'

Equally poign- ant is Cain's later repartee to Lucifer that he pities the latter "who lov'st nothing" (u.ii.338). The externalization of Cain's inner conflict shuttles him between the advocates of love (Adah and Abel) and reason (Lucifer). Both love and reason are forgotten in the act of murder, so that Cain not only lapses from pure reason into defective humanity, but also becomes traitor to warmth, compassion, and fraternal love. The irony of the ra- tionalist's most irrational act is compounded by Cain's interposition be- tween Abel and his sacrifice in the name of a love for all living things which he tragically fails to exhibit toward his brother at the very moment. Unremitting love and unconditional forgiveness-Adah's and Abel's hu- manity-can be emulated by mankind and would have prevented the ca- tastrophe. But the suppression of all human sentiment for the sake of an abstract rationality-Lucifer's postulate-is ultimately untenable for man. Cain, by virtue of his human limitations, will never escape into Lucifer's realm. Lucifer's role thus falls into an archetypal pattern: reason untem- pered by love is evil, as are, for example, Iago's diabolical intellect and the narrow logic-chopping of Goethe's Mephistopheles. Byron's unfeeling de- mon glories in splendid isolation, whereas for the sensitive Adah "solitude seems sin" (I.474). Cain's ironic reversal from self-imposed loneliness to enforced exile teaches him that man forsakes the dictates of sympathy and companionship at his own peril. No amount of stoicism, rationalistic ar- gument, or Faustian aspiration will compensate for denial of feeling. Re- demption can be brought about only by wedding the understanding to love (as Shelley's Prometheus is reunited with Asia), and if reason clashes with love, man is to choose the affections of the heart over the meddling intellect. This critique of unmitigated rationalism invalidates the traditional view of the play's bias toward sacrilege. True, the spokesmen for God's position (Adam, Adah, and Abel) are so much Cain's intellectual inferiors as to provide no match for him, let alone for the subtle Lucifer, as has repeatedly been pointed out.9 No proper debate is established. But since Byron wrote 9. [Francis Jeffrey] "Art. V. Sardanaplus, a Tragedy. The Two Foscari, a Tragedy. Cain, a Mystery. By Lord Byron. 8 vo. pp. 440.

Thorslev,</page><page sequence="6">156 Keats-Shelley Journal drama and not a theological disputation, we must modify the charge that Lucifer, and Cain when voicing the opinions of Lucifer (the "more ironic and sophisticated Cain"10), have all the best arguments: although Adah's and Abel's simple speeches sound less persuasive than Lucifer's and Cain's high rhetoric, their attitude is vindicated by the play's ending. It might be argued that a divine tyrant ironically exploits the noble Cain to further His own malicious purpose, since the ignoble (because submissive) Adah and Abel do not lend themselves to such exploitation. I view the ironic contrast differently: the passive Adah and Abel accept imperfect justice and achieve good, whereas Cain thirsts for reform and compounds in- justice. As M. G. Cooke remarks, Cain's problem is that he "seeks to equate the logical ability to perceive imperfection with the practical ability to re- nounce and remove it."11 Cain, like Oedipus Rex, demonstrates how man's limited reason is an inadequate guide in a world ruled by mysterious power. This theme is already far from blasphemous, and yet it might be restated in even more orthodox terms. Since the act of fratricide ironically demonstrates how the hero achieves the opposite of what he intends, the play not only vitiates Cain's acceptance of Lucifer, which involves rejec- tion of love (I.429), but it also seems to suggest that the hero would have escaped his fate had he embraced the principle opposing Lucifer-God-- and that this principle requires love. Symbolically, the victory of human love over knowledge might be seen as the triumph of Divine love, Cain's choice of reason over love as renunciation of God, and Abel's Christ-like forgiveness combined with Adah's passionate constancy as the persistent watchfulness of Providence despite man's repudiation. The latter inter- pretation develops Christian concepts only hinted at in the text. Never- theless, the very possibility of even suggesting a formulation of the action in these terms reinforces my contention that the play ultimately estab- lishes the inscrutability of Divine Providence.

Scripture con- demns the crimes perpetrated by hero-villains like the Corsair, Manfred, and Cain but not their Romantic features: obsession with a curse, regret for lost innocence, oppressive awareness of ephemerality and the futility of aspirations, life-weariness, disillusion-though these are conducive to rebellion. In one instance (Job) rebellion itself is almost condoned. In fact Scripture is not only the source of Byron's subject (and of his language) but of a number of Romantic traits of his hero. A prominent Biblical feature of the Byronic hero is of course the curse of the "fugitive and vagabond," the Cain curse. But the mark of Cain, always a symbol ofhomelessness, was experienced most acutely by several Romantic heroes, for example the Ancient Mariner, the different versions of Ahasuerus, Chateaubriand's Rene, or Byron's own Harold, Giaour, Selim, and Manfred. In Cain homelessness becomes restlessness, which, in turn, as in other Romantic hero figures, is associated with a pursuit of eternal repose, a longing for death. Byron's Cain is the Romantic wanderer, the spirit searching for mental quiet, which is most poignantly expressed in the play's last line with Adah's parting wish of "Peace be with him," and Cain's desperate reply: "But with me!" Yet, paradoxically, Byron's protagonist exhibits restlessness, the symptom of the mark of Cain, long before his monstrous crime produces the mark itself. When the hero re- minds us: "Never / Knew I what calm was in the soul" (m.2o4-2o05), we realize that one of the causes of the murder-feverish unrest-is a trait that logically should only result from it. Furthermore, the poet induces in us an unconscious association between father and son by means of the protagonist's imaginary portrait of Adam's expulsion from Paradise "with death / Written upon his forehead" (II.i.74-75), a connection which strengthens the impression that a particular curse pervades Cain's world quite independent of the act (the sin of fratricide) that led to it. What 12. Murray Roston, Biblical Drama in Englandfrom the Middle Ages to the Present (London: Faber, 1968), p. 203; cf. Thorslev, pp. 92-98, 178.</page><page sequence="8">158 Keats-Shelley Journal Adam, however, has bequeathed to his son is not restlessness, but hard labor (IIIm.o9-11o), so that before Cain draws upon himself the curse of fratricide he is already twice accursed: he bears an invisible mark of Cain and he has inherited the consequences of his parents' disobedience. The Biblical Fall motif, impersonal and remote when related to other Romantic heroes, becomes personal and immediate for Cain, who suffers for the sins of his own parents; and whereas others may yearn for a vague Eden or golden age of the distant past, Cain gazes back in despair at a tangible Paradise. There is hence little sentimentality about his cry for the irrevocable yesterday, as in his lament over the fate of his "disinherited boy" (which is also his own fate). Although Adah must admonish her brother not to whisper "Such melancholy yearnings o'er the past" (111.32, 36), Cain's gloom is less mawkish than the ill-defined longing of most Romantic heroes. Similarly, Cain's plaint over the impermanence of hu- man existence is not sentimental and has the full force of its meaning, since he cannot take comfort (like Job and his imitators) that it has been so for countless generations. Byron borrows an image from the previous chapter of Genesis (3:19) to express Cain's sense of ephemerality: "being dust and grov'ling in the dust / Till I return to dust," (m.114-115). This Romantic hero does not merely protest mortality but dramatically re- proaches his parents for his condition. Cain's protest exhibits the same psychological dilemma asJob's: in both the death wish coexists with the lament over death's inevitability. When Job bemoans the ephemerality of life (10:20o or 14:1-2) he thinks of man's fate in general, when he exclaims "Would I had never been born" (3:3) he refers to his private misfortune. But Cain, more paradoxically, speaks of himself in both instances: "Must I not die?" (1.29) and "Would I ne'er had been / Aught else but dust!" (1.291-292). Cain yearns for death be- cause, like Manfred and Faust, he is overcome by a sense of the futility of life that but leads to death (I.1o9-11o), so that although he does not seek it he "would behold at once what [he] / Must one day see perforce" (nI.i.195-196), and on achieving this preliminary object he pleads further: Since I must one day return here from the earth, I rather would remain. I am sick of all That dust has shown me; let me dwell in shadows. (n.ii.1o6-1o9)</page><page sequence="9">An Unorthodox Reading of Cain 159 In the second half of this quotation Cain expresses his death wish as taedium vitae, another typically Romantic sentiment to be found in the Bible, especially in Ecclesiastes. In Cain the cause of this life-weariness is entirely intellectual: unlike the Preacher he has not drunk life to the lees. He shares, however, the Preacher's insight into his own limitations, not only the sense of human ephemerality but also the consciousness of mental inadequacy, "for we know nothing" (II.ii.161). As the example of Eccle- siastes shows, these two causes of frustration-the sense of transience and the recognition of the impassable bounds of knowledge-are in turn pro- duced by heightened understanding. Ultimately increased consciousness goes back to the Fall, but in Cain only the cursed hero remains affected by it. It is this sharpened awareness-the analytical intellect of a Lucifer or Mephistopheles-that instills in Romantics the feeling of weariness with life, the frustration that makes Cain exclaim: "I feel the weight / Of daily toil and constant thought" (1.174-175). The "daily toil" Cain recognizes as the punishment ofAdam, but he does not associate the "constant thought" and "The mind which overwhelms" him (1.189) with that knowledge that Adam and Eve acquired by eating of the forbidden fruit. Until after the peripeteia Cain fails to recognize the curse inherent in the attainment of knowledge and perceives only its positive aspect: The snake spoke truth. It was the tree of knowledge; It was the tree of life. Knowledge is good, And life is good, and how can both be evil? (1.36-38) In both Genesis and Cain the gift of knowledge is ambivalent. In the Bible the tasting of fruit from the tree of knowledge is forbidden, but the text does not state that the apple itself is wicked, or that the "knowledge of good and evil" is iniquitous. Adam and Eve sin through disobedience and are punished, yet, by this Fall, man gains "knowledge of good and evil"; he achieves that moral awareness which is put to the test throughout the Bible and most immediately in God's warning to Cain (Genesis 4:7). In Byron's drama Cain does not quarrel with Lucifer's variation upon the felix culpa theme, his parting remark that despite the apple's "fatal" con- sequences it bore a "good gift . . . reason" (n.ii.459-46o). As for other Romantic heroes, for Cain the positive aspect of reason lies in the un-</page><page sequence="10">16o Keats-Shelley Journal limited possibilities of human aspiration. But Cain forgets it is the rational mind that curses man with consciousness of his own imperfections. Reason teaches that "the human sum / Of knowledge" is "to know mortal na- ture's nothingness" (II.ii.421-422). Reason reminds man of his lost para- dise, shows him the injustice of the world, and makes him aware of life's transiency and his inferiority to his desires and conceptions (II.i.82-83). It is the tension between man's knowledge of his ephemerality, his shallow- ness, pettiness, and blindness-in short his limitation-and his Faustian longings for infinitude, for perfection, absolute knowledge, and eternal life that constitutes Cain's Weltschmerz. Whereas this Weltschmerz, the quest for knowledge, the yearning for absolutes, and the preoccupation with mortality are experienced by most Romantics, the motif of the real or imagined Cain-like curse is more characteristic of the Byronic version of the Romantic hero, though not confined to Byron's heroes or those influenced by Byron. (We need only recall Werther, Ren6, or the Ancient Mariner.) Yet, the most striking feature of the Byronic hero, as distinct from the Wordsworthian solitary, for example, is his recusant and ungovernable nature, whether as gloomy social outcast, descendant of the Gothic villain, in The Corsair and Lara, or as the defiant Promethean and metaphysical rebel in Manfred and Cain. The charge of iconoclasm revolves around Byron's treatment of Cain's rebellion. It can be argued that if we sympathize with Cain merely for his suffering the play may be orthodox, but if we are made to identify our- selves with Cain's rebellion the work is sacrilegious. Here again a com- parison with Job will be enlightening. There is an undeniable element of rebellion in Job's persistent questionings of Divine justice and in his re- fractory self-justifications when seen against the meekness of the Three Comforters. What we admire in Job, however, is not revolt per se so much as the acute sense of right from which this revolt derives. Just as we respect Job's insistence on his innocence, so we esteem Cain's quest for ab- solute justice (1.77, II.ii.238, II.ii.289-305). As long as rebellion is sustained by such sentiments neither work condemns it. Unlike Job, however, Cain's sense of right (together with reason and love) forsakes him momentarily when he is blinded by murderous frenzy. Cain is punished with exile not for his sacrilegious speeches but for his criminal act: "Cain, what hast thou done?" (m.469). Yet Byron connects</page><page sequence="11">An Unorthodox Reading of Cain 161 the crime with rebellion. Cain's rebellion (like that of Doctor Faustus) at- tracts Lucifer and encourages him to exploit Cain's mood for murder. To quote Byron's letter again: "the object of the Demon is to depress him [Cain] still further in his estimation," and the slaying of Abel is an act, "which discharges itself rather against Life, and the author of Life, than the mere living." This is rebellion gone astray. In retrospect the indictment for murder warns against the blinding danger of rebellion. The Book ofJob, on the other hand, censures the blindness of the rebel's opponents (the Three Comforters) more than the rebel's own. Byron's play damns re- bellion more than does the Book ofJob because Job rebels and gets away with it. I now seem to have made Byron's drama more orthodox than Scripture. This alarming conclusion will be rectified if we bear in mind that the in- finitely more blasphemous Cain deserves more than a comparatively mild rebuke. Besides, the issue of rebellion is less central in Job than in Byron and therefore more easily passed over. Nevertheless, a play dealing with rebellion less forgivingly than the Book of Job is not sacrilegious. Another difference between Job and Cain is that while Job ends in com- plete humility Cain's recantation is halfhearted. Cain's submission is in- terrupted by two outbursts of his former recalcitrance: "Am I then / My brother's keeper?" (m.468-469) and "That which I am, I am. I did not seek / For life nor did I make myself" (m.5o9-5io). In the first Byron trans- forms the Biblical Cain's cowardice into defiance. But this outburst does not undermine Cain's newly gained submissiveness, for Cain has simply forgotten himself under the impact of his crime. Nor can the second speech be read as proof of Cain's unchanged obstinacy, because it expresses new disillusionment with himself as much as old rebellion against God and is immediately followed by a Christ-like sentiment: "But could I / With my own death redeem him from the dust-" (m.51o-511). The two tem- porary lapses into former revolt indicate an attitude more ambivalent than Cain's earlier uncompromising blasphemy, but they are no less consistent with a reformed temper than the momentary flicker of old pride at the end of Oedipus Rex and Othello. Cain too has undergone tragic discovery and self-recognition. The discovery is Death and the insight his new sense of responsibility (m.371-374). He is "awake at last" (am.378), and as he bids his dead brother farewell a new tone of humility creeps into his voice:</page><page sequence="12">162 Keats-Shelley Journal if thou see'st what I am, I think thou wilt forgive him, whom his God Can ne'er forgive, nor his own soul. Farewell. I must not, dare not touch what I have made thee. (m.531-534) After the fratricide Cain's submissiveness markedly predominates over re- belliousness, so much so that it is he who warns his usually humble sister- wife: "No more of threats" (m.525). Suffering has taught him wisdom. Cain's conversion vies with Job's. Whereas Job shifts from a basically devout meekness mixed with rebellious impulses to pure self-abasement, Cain moves from unqualified defiance to relative submission. Cain's im- perfect repentance, therefore, does not argue against my comparison. My contention holds: since Byron's drama shows the hazards of rebelliousness no less than the Book ofJob, it is not iconoclastic. If the poet's attitude to rebellion is not blasphemous, neither is his treat- ment of other features that are usually associated with the Byronic hero: the wanderer's curse, the forbidden fruit of knowledge, the nostalgic yearning for return to an Eden, the experience of transience, and the sense of satiety and frustration. Although Byron transforms Cain into a Ro- mantic hero reflecting various traits of Childe Harold, for example, the play retains a Biblical tone. But more than that, various characteristics of this self-conscious, brooding escapist owe something to different portions of Scripture: the feature of the cursed fugitive is evident from the Cain episode itself, and other analogies appear in the previous chapter of Adam's Fall, the "vanity of vanities" of Ecclesiastes, the Psalmist's and Job's la- ments over human ephemerality, and the latter's rebellious thirst for jus- tice. The doubts and ambiguities reflected in these figures become Cain's and dignify him, but Byron's play does not applaud traits that Holy Writ censures and never reverses the Bible's judgment. Cain the epitome of the glorified Romantic rebel does not preclude Cain the protagonist of a drama truly Biblical in spirit. III Let us now take a closer look at the portrait of the malignant deity painted by Lucifer and Cain. The latter's most clearly formulated assault upon Divine justice occurs in the first soliloquy:</page><page sequence="13">An Unorthodox Reading of Cain 163 The tree was planted, and why not for him? If not, why place him near it, where it grew, The fairest in the centre? They have but One answer to all questions, " 'Twas his will And he is good." How know I that? Because He is all pow'rful, must all-good, too, follow? I judge but by the fruits-and they are bitter- Which I must feed on for a fault not mine. (1.72-79) Cain's allegation is threefold: Firstly, God is blamed for supplying the temptation, not man for succumbing to it. Secondly, the punishment is undeserved by Cain since the transgression was his parents': the innocent are made to suffer. And thirdly, the nature of the penalty (the "bitter fruits") is incompatible with Divine benevolence. The last of these accusations questions God's mercy rather than His justice. Of the various "bitter fruits"-expulsion from Eden, toil, painful childbirth, mortality--Cain is most preoccupied with the sentence of death, which indeed was the penalty predicted for eating of the tree of knowl- edge. Whereas Cain seems to regard the paradox of God's granting eternal life to Adam in Paradise only to withdraw it again in punishment for dis- obedience as a malicious design to make man lament his loss, he fails to realize that, alluring as the fruit of the tree of life-immortality-appears, there is no reason to assume that it would have been less bitter than the equally alluring apple of knowledge. God's timely intervention may have spared him and his descendants unknown misery. On the other hand neither in the Biblical nor in Byron's version is it clear whether seizure of the forbidden fruit of knowledge caused mortality or merely an awareness of it. Part of the ironic treatment of the protagonist lies in his failure to consider the second possibility. Cain complains that before Adam "plucked / The knowledge, he was ignorant of death" (1.296-297) without recogniz- ing that his words may be literally true: perhaps Adam did not pluck death but the knowledge of death. Cain's attack upon the "bitter fruits" of the Fall rests upon misunderstanding, since the fruit of knowledge with its burden of ever-increasing awareness is what he himself pursues. To an</page><page sequence="14">164 Keats-Shelley Journal aspirer such punishment is merciful--indeed, it is as much reward as pun- ishment.13 Cain's charges concerning the suffering of innocence and the nature of temptation are more difficult to dismiss. Byron neatly solves the moral problem involved in Cain's inheritance of his parents' sin by making him repeat it, by transferring the motif of the Fall from parents to son (just as the mark of Cain motif is expanded from son to father). This motif is further developed in the series of Falls from the beautiful pre-Adamite creation (n.ii.124), through Eden and then the present "young" world of Cain and Abel (1.49; II.ii.216; m.2O), into the still greater misery of sub- sequent generations (rr.ii.223-227). The reference to future incest (1.363- 367) is not only an illustration of Byron's obsession with the themel4 but also a dramatically justified prediction of a world still further fallen. This ingenious series of "paradise lost endlessly repeated," which to one scholar suggests Byron's "almost fullblown nihilism,"'s may be taken as a more conventional decline paralleled in the Bible: Adam and Eve, Cain, Noah's generation, and the repeated sins of the Israelites ultimately punished by exile. The fall of Cain in Byron corresponds precisely to the Fall of our first parents in the Old Testament. For Lucifer (pace Steffan) is a tempter. Although the demon, being of spiritual nature, would have scorned to assume the shape of a creeping thing of earth--and Byron corroborates in the Preface that Lucifer is not the Serpent--he lies when he insinuates that spirits never tempt men (1.217-242). Lucifer and the Serpent perform the same function: they tempt with knowledge, only half fulfil their promise, and cause tremendous sorrow. With the forbidden fruit Adam and Eve procured knowledge, knowledge of death, and yet their eternally dissat- isfied son seeks to know more of this enigma. Under Lucifer's influence Cain initiates mankind into further knowledge of death by supplying the concrete example: "Death is in the world!" (III.370), and yet it remains a 13. We might even apply to Cain the words from Lionel Trilling's essay "The Pain of Pleasure: Wordsworth to Dostoevsky," Romanticism Reconsidered, ed. Northrop Frye (New York: Columbia University Press, 1963), p. 97: Craving "the 'more life' of spiritual mili- tancy" he should be grateful that "by means of the sin and the fall we managed to get our- selves expelled from that dreadful place [Eden]." 14.

Preoccupied with his parents' Fall, Cain is ironically unaware that Lucifer tempts him as the Serpent tempted Eve, an analogy instinctively made by Adah (1.392-393, 400-405). Furthermore, the demon produces what Byron's letter calls "the frame of mind that leads to the catastrophe." Adah testifies to the spirit's evil effect on the temper of her husband (III. 45-51), whose old frustrations are now intensified by the cosmic journey and intelligence of future misery, and Cain's own account reflects how Lucifer has succeeded in aggravating his victim's self-abasement by stimu- lating his imagination (mI.65-69). Lucifer fosters Cain's jealousy (n.ii.338- 354), which alone-unlike that trait in his Biblical counterpart-would never have made a murderer of Byron's rational Cain, but this submerged trait is nevertheless released in the blind fury of rebellion. By leaving Adah and accompanying his tempter Cain takes the first step in his repudiation of love and brotherhood. In his surrender to Lucifer's temptation of knowl- edge, he is, like his parents, undeterred by the threat of death: he would gaze upon "the great double myst'ries" even if he were to perish in the event, thus evoking Lucifer's apt retort: "There / The son of her who snatched the apple spake" (II.ii.403-4o9). Though Cain did not pluck the forbidden fruit himself, he betrays his complicity by condoning Eve's dis- obedience ("if it be such a sin to seek for knowledge"), so that even Adah must convict him: "Alas! thou sinnest now" (m.92-93). Adah's pious innocence, like Abel's, obviously serves as a foil to the sacrilege that leads to murder. Yet it is easily overlooked that since Adah does not blaspheme she is not cursed. The curse is portrayed in the play as dread of death, but Adah does not brood over human transience, is happy "despite of death" (1.468), and does not feel "The want of this so much regretted Eden" (n1.40). Although all four children of Adam and Eve eventually suffer, only Cain, who repeats his parents' rebellion, feels pained and doomed throughout, which implies that the sins of the fathers are not indiscriminately visited upon the children. With the catastrophe Cain might have pleaded the murder and its consequences bear out his conten- tion that God punishes an innocent son for his father's sin (or an innocent family for the crime of one of its members), but although he does not openly withdraw his earlier allegation of Divine injustice, his present si- lence is a kind of retraction. Similarly, without explicitly rescinding his indictment of God for exposing Adam and Eve to forbidden fruit, he</page><page sequence="16">166 Keats-Shelley Journal fails, significantly, to repeat his accusation in more personal terms: why didst thou lead me into temptation? Cain begins to recognize his own responsibility: by ignoring the lesson of his parents' Fall he succumbed to a like temptation, first Lucifer's and then that of his own irrational impulse, his murderous frenzy; by slaying Abel he has indicted himself for causing the very injustice against which he inveighed-innocent suffering. Ob- sessed with his guilt he senses that he cannot press his earlier charges and thus they lose their effect. Whereas in a court of law, as in life in general, no argument is vitiated by its advocate, yet in drama the ironic situation of a blinded protagonist tends to undermine his case, especially if he abdicates it himself as the result of newly gained insight. Although they have not been disproved in so many words, the course of events has dramatically nullified the insinuations in Cain's first soliloquy that God trapped man and meted out merciless and unjust punishment. Cain's explicit assumption of responsibility (m.371-375) also under- mines the two refractory eruptions discussed above, the fatalistic but ir- refutable comment "nor did I make myself" (m.51o) and the defiant "Am I then / My brother's keeper?" (m.468-469). Cain's free choice of knowl- edge over love has already proved that the play is not a fate tragedy'6 and forced the question of predestination into the background: whether Cain was preordained to sin becomes as irrelevant as whether Abel's (or Job's) innocence is due to grace. In Genesis 4:7 God's warning to the future fratricide (omitted by Byron to make the murder unpremeditated) estab- lishes Cain's freedom of choice. The poet follows the Genesis story in em- phasizing his hero's free will and leaving it unreconciled with Divine Providence, so that the indictment of Cain is not an indictment of the Lord Who created Cain; and God, Abel's real "keeper," does not become a murderer for failing to prevent murder. This does not mean that Byron reveals why God allowed fratricide to occur, or, as Walter Scott would have liked, "the reasons which render the existence of moral evil consistent with the general benevolence of the Deity."'

But the poet's failure to solve the intractable dilemma of the- odicy does not make his play sacrilegious. The false impression of sacrilege is created because accusations, logically formulated by Lucifer and Cain, receive no convincing verbal refutation from their pious opponents, and it is overlooked that such refutation would in fact constitute the solution of insoluble questions. Yet the influential Francis Jeffrey of the Edinburgh Review blames Byron precisely for leaving "the question of the Origin of Evil . . . just where it was, in its mighty, unfathomed obscurity." Since "the Devil and his pupil have the field entirely to themselves," their ideas will prevail with the audience, for "it is the mischief of all poetical para- doxes, that from the very limits and end of poetry, which deals only in obvious and glancing views, they are never brought to the fair test of argument. An allusion to a doubtful topic will often pass for a definitive conclusion on it; and, clothed in beautiful language, may leave the most pernicious impressions behind." I agree that Cain wins by poetic repre- sentation what it would lose in the "fair test of argument" but draw the opposite conclusion: the play rejects Lucifer's position. I have demon- strated that Lucifer's and Cain's sacrilegious indictment is dismissed not through logical debate in the dialogue but by means of an artistic pattern of conflict, irony, reversal, and recognition. "It is," says Jeffrey, "a very suspicious philosophy that aims at establishing its doctrines by appeals to the passions and the fancy," but this attack on Cain is as unjustified as would be a similar one on the Bible--neither is intended to be a work of philosophy. The charge is even less applicable to Byron, who does not aim at establishing any doctrine. I admit that Byron gives the problem of the- odicy a prominence lacking in the Biblical version and has Cain and Lu- cifer pose it in unusually vitriolic terms. This emphasis, however, makes the play neither sacrilegious nor "a poor and pedantic sort of poetry that seeks to embody nothing but metaphysical subtleties and abstract deduc- tions of reason";18 on the contrary, it renders the dramatic rejection of sacrilege more conclusive and enhances the poetic effect by creating a more 18. Jeffrey, quoted in Steffan, pp. 364-365.</page><page sequence="18">168 Keats-Shelley Journal powerful contrast and poignant anagnorisis. The forcefulness of Byron's question must not be interpreted as a blasphemous answer. Byron faithfully transfers an unsolved theological dilemma from Scrip- ture to drama. By substituting an angel for the Lord he avoids increasing the crudity of Biblical anthropomorphism which the introduction of God on the stage would have entailed.19 If the deity of Cain were confined to the "material Principle" or merely "a relative upstart . . . a temporary power-very like Shelley's Jupiter,"20 Byron should have followed Shel- ley's example in bringing such a god on the stage. But Byron's drama conveys a sense of the inscrutable God of Genesis. Since the question of innocent suffering must remain unanswered, it would have been easier to convict a deity appearing before the audience than one unseen and unheard. Better no answer than one unsatisfying. Cain's crime, however, does re- ceive its answer: the remonstrance "The voice of thy slain brother's blood cries out / Ev'n from the ground" (m.47o-471) reinforces the murderer's sense of guilt by objectifying the voice of his conscience. Only who is to express this remonstrance? If Lucifer represented the play's ideal, a Pro- metheus championing mankind against a malignant deity, it is he who should have upbraided Cain for the act of fratricide, for abandoning the dictates of reason. On the other hand Cain would not be able to accept the angel's reproach if it were the taunt of a fatuous messenger (like Aeschylus' Hermes) sent by a malicious tyrant. To make one more comparison with the Book ofJob, which also depicts the legitimate quest for a solution to the dilemma of unmerited pain: the answer Job receives out of the whirl- wind asserts Divine Providence and leaves it a mystery. This disappoint- ment is lessened in Cain for two reasons: Byron does not arouse our ex- pectations by introducing the Lord to offer a reply, and we feel God or His messenger owes no explanation to a murderer. The question of Divine justice is solved in the Book ofJob no more than in Cain. If Cain's punish- ment-eternal exile and mental self-torture-exceeds his crime, the res- toration ofJob's family and wealth is inadequate compensation for innocent suffering. Since Job's guilt is dubious at most and Cain's undeniable, the balance of crime and punishment is not fairer in Job than in Cain. i9. See LJ, vI, 16. 20. Marshall, p. 151; Jerome J. McGann, Fiery Dust: Byron's Poetic Development (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1968), p. 261.</page><page sequence="19">An Unorthodox Reading of Cain 169 Nor is it fairer in Genesis. Whereas the sentence of the Biblical Cain is more deserved because his fratricide is premeditated, Byron's hero, in glaring contrast with the pious humility of his brother, explicitly causes the Divine rejection of his offering through his blasphemy (III.246-247) and Manfred-like refusal to kneel (1II.269-270). If Cain's rebellious stance may be condoned elsewhere, during the sacrifice it is dismally out of place. Furthermore, the enlightenment and at least partial reformation of Byron's hero and Abel's Christ-like forgiveness suggest a Divine purpose which remains more obscure in the Bible. Finally, if we were to insist that Cain comprises an explicit theological statement, we would have to conclude that it is more orthodox than Milton's conscious attempt to "justify the ways of God to men." By transferring the motif of the Fall from Adam to a murderer, to a man who should have been forewarned by his parents' fate, Byron facilitates the task of vindicating God. But of course Cain makes no categorical assertion at all, blasphemous or otherwise, though tone and structure convey an overall point of view, which we may now redefine: the futility and danger of reason's rebellion, even in the name ofjustice, against the human con- dition and against the mystery of the cosmic order. IV If Byron's self-dramatization, his Romantic treatment of the hero, and his failure to solve a theological dilemma do not make Cain iconoclastic, how are we to account for the deluge of attacks of Byron's contemporaries on what they regard as the play's "Satanism"? Henry Crabb Robinson's more moderate indictment may provide an answer: "The book is calculated to spread infidelity by furnishing a ready expression to difficulties which must occur to every one, more or less, and which are passed over by those who confine themselves to scriptural representations."21 Here Byron is not ac- cused of writing an irreligious play but of producing irreligion in his readers by forcing upon them controversial issues which they preferred to forget. I have argued that in raising these issues Byron does not depart from the precedent of Holy Writ, where they are implied throughout and un- reservedly exposed in the Book ofJob. Byron merely provides "a ready 21. Henry Crabb Robinson on Books and Writers, ed. Edith J. Morley, 3 vols. (London: J. M. Dent and Sons, 1938), I, 281.</page><page sequence="20">170 Keats-Shelley Journal expression" of these "difficulties." Since many of Byron's pious contem- poraries blindly "confine[d] themselves to scriptural representations" and missed the problems raised, the play's skillful reformulation which com- pelled them to think may have "spread infidelity." In a more skeptical age like ours the work might have the opposite effect. Byron's balanced re- statement of Scriptural dilemmas (Cain's caustic attack followed by com- parative silence, almost a retraction, and the legitimacy of his questions in contrast with the inadequacy of his conduct) challenges those of us who have mechanically "passed over" and rejected the Biblical standpoint. Every significant drama demands a reappraisal of our world view, and Cain, a Biblical drama, calls for reconsideration of the Bible's. Cain is Biblical in spirit despite Byron's radical transformation of his source character. This metamorphosis is obvious, but the opposite process, the Bible's part in modifying the "Byronic hero" concept, has not yet been fully appreciated. For this hero has evolved. Although Cain exhibits most of the "Byronic" traits of the poet's earlier creations, the author's extravagant and one-sided posturing has given way to a more conventional, balanced, and critical attitude. We have seen that Cain's lament over lost Eden and immortality is not as sentimental as in other Romantics but dramatically justified. Moreover, although Cain feels no less cursed and isolated from mankind than his precursors, pariahdom and alienation are no longer the insignia of unequivocal superiority as they were in Childe Harold and Manfred, for example. These heroes almost succeeded in an impossible attempt to suppress all feeling, "to steel / The heart against it- self" and battle to the end "cursing the heart by which [their] very hu- manity survives."22 In the peripeteia of Cain, however, the act of murder and the ensuing impact are entirely emotional.23 Like Harold and Man- fred, Cain longed to be a spirit free from "clay," but this hubristic aspira- tion is rejected by the tone of the Biblical drama and abandoned by the remorseful hero himself. The glorified Byronic revolt against accepted values, primarily social in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and the Oriental Tales but assuming cosmic proportions in "Prometheus," Manfred, and Cain, is 22. Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, m.cxi; Gleckner, pp.246 and 326. The last quotation beauti- fully describes "the fate of the poet as Byron sees him" (Gleckner, p. 326), but it would be more appropriate to a discussion of Childe Harold or Manfred than to Cain. 23. Marshall, p. 154.</page><page sequence="21">An Unorthodox Reading of Cain 171 ironically reversed in the latter and yields, if not to unmitigated humility and resignation, yet to repentance and new acknowledgment of the limits of human understanding. Cain is a more tragic figure than his predecessors. Geoffrey Brereton excludes Byron's heroes from his definition of tragedy, because their revolt is "a declaration of independence as a necessary pre- lude to the raising of man to an equal plane with the spiritual forces which surround him .... The result is therefore less tragedy than heroic drama, with the same kind of victory at the end."24 This description fits Manfred perfectly, but in Cain there is no untragic final victory. Rebellion is no longer vindicated. And it could hardly be otherwise. Once Byron had selected the Cain story for his version of man's Fall the plot left him little choice but to censure disobedience. If the poet's protest had comprehended a reversal of values of his source myth, his Cain, like Goethe's Faust, would have been rewarded for his heretical aspiration.25 Byron did not go so far. One might claim that religious conformity restrained him, but it is less con- troversial to assume he adhered to the Biblical plot out of a sense of veri- similitude, for to commute the sentence of the fratricide of Genesis would have been too implausible. Even as Byron's ennobled protagonist, a Cain cannot help damning himself for his actions, thus disqualifying himself as the vehicle for the justification of man's ways to his Creator. A more ap- propriate subject for the indictment of God is the story of the Deluge, which Byron dramatized in Heaven and Earth.26 Aholibamah has inherited the rebellious nature of her ancestor Cain but does not mar her rebellion with bloodshed, whereas the suffering to the innocent caused by God's Flood is highlighted by a drowning mother who fails to save her infant. Such material apparently proved too recalcitrant for Byron and the drama was left fragmentary. Neither Aholibamah's unrepentant defiance nor Cain's half-hearted re- cantation represents Byron's final position. With all its questionings Cain remains faithful to the spirit of Scripture. Byron's subsequent work proves 24. Principles of Tragedy (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1968), p. 184. 25. Nevertheless Samuel C. Chew, Jr., The Dramas of Lord Byron (1915; rpt.

Byron called the play "very pious" (LJ, vI, 31), perhaps because the division of the characters into the elect and damned fits Calvinistic doctrine.</page><page sequence="22">172 Keats-Shelley Journal that the Biblical mood reflected in Cain does not represent his settled Weltanschauung, but then he never seems to have acquired a definite system of thought or belief: he was a Romantic seeker, a metaphysical "Pilgrim of Eternity."27 Not only as authentic Biblical drama but as manifest as- sertion of the tragic vision Cain conveys a standpoint too absolute for Byron's philosophy of uncertainty. His relativism found its outlet in the shifting poses of DonJuan, where, as David Leigh has recently pointed out in thisjournal, the poet "attempts to describe the human situation in purely secular terms."28 The spirit pervading Cain represents an extreme in the Byronic canon, not of the "Satanic" viewpoint, but of a Job-like rebellion and silence in the face of Divine mystery.
