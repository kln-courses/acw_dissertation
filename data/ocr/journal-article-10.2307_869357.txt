<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ART OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLES: AT THE BERKELEY GALLERIES. The English, with their tradition of exploration and Empire-building, have amassed some of the most remarkable examples of Primitive Art. But whereas of recent date the French have begun to appreciate them for their aesthetic value, the English incline to treat them rather as trophies, as ethnological specimens. And on the whole they are right. Primitive Art' has, it is true, a certain avsthetic value, but except for the finest examples is so limited and repetitious as to become a bore. In the present exhibition at the Berkeley Galleries-perhaps the most ambitious yet attempted in London-the examples on view have certainly been selected with the intention of appealing aesthetically ; they have been selected with care and they are displayed so as to be seen to their best advantage against a back- ground of native textiles, fish-nets and beads. And yet, though it is interesting and instructive to be able to compare and contrast the accomplishments of civilisa- tions which lie geographically as far apart as the Belgian Congo and New Zealand, there is little aesthetic pleasure in so doing. Primitive man makes art objects to be used in his rites and in his daily life, and it is only by virtue of that use that they have a meaning. Exhibited on a stand or in a show-case one is aware of the hypnotic quality of many of the Masks [PLATE B], of the decorative value of the smaller objects, and more occasionally of the fine carving. An object as fine as the Ivory Mask (No. 20) from Benin [PLATE C] lent by Mrs. Seligmann is both exceptional and a great rarity, for only four similar specimens are known. Here there is a serenity which one does not generally associate with Primitive Art. Therefore perhaps the small objects-bowls, clubs, stools and adzes-seem more worthy of attention, and indeed the exhibition contains a very good selection of these. Among noteworthy exhibits are an unusually large Easter Island Figure (No. 19o), an Ivory Coast Figure of a standing woman, some bark-cloth masks from New Guinea (No. 182), an anthropomorphic figure from New Guinea (No. 177) and a highly coloured Hornbill from Borneo (No. 203).
