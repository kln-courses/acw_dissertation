In addition to all Nabokov's novels, specific sections are included for his edition of Pushkin's Eugene Onegin, his poetry, short stories, essays and criticism, drama, and translation of Alice in Wonderland. Two Appendices list selected émigré criticism and reviews and comment on Nabokov's works in film and stage performance. Among the items excluded are doctoral dissertations, tributes, news stories, letters to editors, foreign language publications, reviews of Nabokov studies and criticism, obituaries, short or casual reviews, and brief references "in passim."

"Émigré criticism" is here taken to mean pieces written in Russian, but not in Russia, for an audience virtually exclusively composed of intellectuals who chose to leave Russia at the time of the Communist revolution. Several leading émigré figures, including literary critics, developed substantial reputations in the West, and pose a slight problem of classification (Gleb Struve is an excellent example). The decisive factor in this compilation is that of the language of composition: English language essays appear in the main text, Russian language items here. This list is derived primarily from the research of Naumann and Foster. I have attempted to regularize cyrillic spellings in the most commonly accepted transliterations. Since there is no standard system of transcription, some curious vagaries of spelling are found in the literature. I have encountered, for example, the spellings "Varshawski," "Varshausky," and "Varsauskij" designating the same individual. Since most of these items are untitled reviews, I include author's name, title of the journal or book in which the piece appeared, whatever publication data is available, date, and the Nabokov work discussed and/or the title or topic of the piece. 1.

APPENDIX II-NABOKOV IN PERFORMANCE The following is a selected listing of reviews and criticism inspired by movies made from Nabokov's Lolita, Laughter in the Dark, and Despair, the stage adaptation of Invi tation to a Beheading, and the staged The Waltz Invention. Items have been chosen for inclusion with the goal of representing the range of reactions to the productions. It is worth noting that, reviewers' misconceptions not withstanding, Nabokov himself did not write the scripts for any of the Hollywood efforts. Particularly in the case of Lolita, most contemporary reviewers were misled by the fact that Nabokov had been re tained to write the script for Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film (starring James Mason, Sue Lyon, Shelley Winters, and Peter Sellers) and his name appeared in the movie's credits. In his preface to the published version of the screenplay he did write of Lolita (New York: McGraw Hill, 1974), Nabokov outlines the extent of his participation in Kubrick's final, filmed, product. The relationship between Nabokov's novel, his screenplay, and Kubrick's movie is discussed in Appel's Nabokov's Dark Cinema and my "Lolita: Novel and Screen play," both noted above. Laughter in the Dark was filmed by Tony Richardson and starred Nicol Williamson, Anna Karena, and Claud Provot. Despair was made by R. W. Fassbinder with a script by Tom Stoppard and stars Dirk Bogard. Invitation to a Beheading was adapted by Russell McGrath and presented at Joseph Papp's Public Theater in 1969. The Waltz Invention 552 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="28">was produced the same year. The New York stage also saw a very short-lived musical-comedy version of Lolita. DESPAIR Anon.
