(Communicated by ο. w. otratton.j In his remarkable memoir on the constitution of solids and liquids, Tangmuir1 considers in some detail those forces which are concerned in the structure of matter, stating their charac teristics with great clearness. But unfortunately he adopts definitions of "physical" and "chemical" forces connoting a narrowness to the term "physical" which is quite unhappy. I realize, however, that his purpose in this is to emphasize the relation of many terms and phenomena usually regarded as dis tinct. Science has arrived at a stage in its evolution where the classi fication between physics and chemistry appears artificial. Of course all classification is necessarily arbitrary and appears so especially at the boundaries between classes. There must, therefore, be confusion and difference of opinion among those who approach the study of what may perhaps be called twin fields, such as physical chemistry or chemical physics, from differ ent points of view. The appropriate attitude in such matters seems to be to avoid the artificial issue by classification and nomen clature derived from a viewpoint common to both. In view of the historical significance of the words "physical" and "chemical," their use in classifying forces appears rather un natural. A less artificial nomenclature is that derived from the fundamental theory of the constitution of matter common 11. Langmuir. Joiirn. Amer. Chem. Soc. 39: 1848. 1917. 36x</page><page sequence="2">362 WËLLS: PHYSICAL vs. CHEMICAL FORCES to both physics and chemistry, according to which forces are classified as (1) molar,2 (2) molecular, (3) atomic, and (4) electronic. There is little anthropomorphic in these words, and they center the attention on the phenomena. The classification is quali tative in the sense that no quantitative relations of these forces to energy have yet been defined. The electron theory of atomic structure, however, dispels much of the vagueness surrounding many of the forces, and raises into further prominence the con viction of Faraday that there is but one fundamental type of force. Electronic forces may be defined as those which maintain the negative or valence electrons and the positive nucleus in equilibrium as a single system. Similarly, atomic forces may be defined as those which maintain two or more atoms in equi librium as a single system; molecular forces as those which main tain two or more molecules in equilibrium as a single system; and molar forces those which maintain two or more masses in equilibrium as a single system. Each group of forces may be regarded as the residual fields of force remaining unsaturated in the smaller systems constituting the components of the system under consideration. For the description of certain phenomena the molar theory is sufficient, but soon a stage is reached at which the phenomena must be considered in more detail. The system considered is then restricted to groups of molecules. This system is in its turn further restricted to atomic groups, and so on. The im portant point is that each theory includes all those preceding as special cases, as the result of simplifying approximations, or as arising from statistical considerations. The more closely one wishes to examine the nature of the extended system the more the point of view approaches that of the restricted system. The key to the nature of molecular forces, for example, is to be found in atomic considerations. This is the point particularly empha sized bv Lanvmuir in his paper. 2 Molar is derived from the Latin moles, a large mass. In the Century Dic tionary molar forces are defined as those producing motions between large masses, molecular forces those between molecules, but which are insensible at sensible dis tance.</page><page sequence="3">WELLS: PHYSICAL VS. CHEMICAL FORCES 363 Whatever the nature of the fields of force, the effect of neigh boring systems would be expected to be more definite the more discrete the structure. Thus electronic forces are definitely characteristic of the nature of the element, showing the finite differences of the periodic system. Atomic forces show more continuity, only two distinct types occurring, corresponding to primary and secondary valence. These may be called primary and secondary atomic forces. Molecular systems have lost so much of their discreteness that combinations of molecules do not follow the laws of definite and multiple proportions. In such phenomena as molecular association and surface structure, the discreteness of atomic constitution begins to give place to statistical continuity. Moreover, even in these phenomena, the forces are relatively so weak that molecules are not usually regarded as permanently grouped together. In order to avoid the troublesome conflicts which are involved in the use of the words physics, physical chemistry, and chemis try, for many purposes it would be convenient to classify these portions of science into molar theory or molics, molecular theory or moleculics,z atomics, and electronics. Molics deals only with continuous quantities and ideal dis continuities such as surfaces. This is the province of classical physics. In molecules the statistical nature of molar quantities must be considered. For instance, actual surfaces between distinct phases are not regarded as mathematical surfaces of discontinuity, but as possessing a molecular structure, so graph ically shown by Langmuir and his predecessors. Such phenom ena as molecular association, condensation and those connected with colloids and ions in gases are also typically molecular in that finite groups of molecules are involved and the range of forces is not large compared with the distances between mole cules. Moleculics thus includes much of what is often called physical-chemistry. The complexity of molecular systems lim its the application of quantitative methods, in spite of the great advances in statistical mechanics. 1 The accent might be placed upon the penult, as in monatomic.</page><page sequence="4">364 S AFFORD : NOTES ON DAHLIA The great fertility of the atomic theory has produced such a mass of systematic knowledge that the province of atomics is easily defined. Moreover, the definiteness and comparative simplicity of atomic systems makes classification easy. This is still more striking in the case of electronics, which perhaps may be even more productive of systematic knowledge than atomics has been. To some, attention to nomenclature is considered trivial, but early in his career Faraday remarked the importance of clever definitions which he always recorded, and demonstrated by his example the close relation between the progress of science and its nomenclature. Moreover, if the main purpose of science is economy of thought, it is as necessary to systematize and classify facts already known, as to discover new facts only to have them buried unappreciated.</page></plain_text>
