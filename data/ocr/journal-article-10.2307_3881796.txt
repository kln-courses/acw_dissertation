<plain_text><page sequence="1">Am. Zoologist, 9:241-249 (1969). Whose Real World? V. G. Dethier Department of Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, Nezv Jersey 08540 (Presidential Address, American Society of Zoologists, and Vice-Presidential Ad- dress, Section F, American Association for the Advancement of Science, given at Dallas, Texas, December 30, 1968) The honor of presenting a presidential address carries with it certain limitations. One could, for example, deliver a "state of the union" message in which he discusses the history, the future, or the finances of the Society or its place in the sun, except for the fact that an appreciable segment of the audience may not be members of the Society and accordingly have little interest in its activities. One could harangue the audience on some topic of burning nation- al, international, moral, or ethical interest upon which he is no better informed than his listeners. Or he could use the podium as a public psychiatric couch in order to exorcise all of the angers, peeves, repres- sions, and anxieties that bedevil him. Per- haps in a more erudite performance he could spin gentle philosophies, a sure indi- cation, according to one of my younger colleagues, that the onset of senility is at hand. There is also a great temptation to deliver a scientific paper in the area of his speciality because harrowing this well plowed ground involves minimal risk of exposing himself as a simpleton. For the audience the soporific effect of this ap- proach can be overwhelming. There is, however, one topic of interest that per- vades all science and, paradoxically, falls within the area of a rather narrow special- ty. I am referring to the acquisition of knowledge of the universe. Inasmuch as this pursuit depends first and foremost upon sensory input, I, as a student of sen- sory physiology and behavior, find myself in the happy position of being able to relate my parochial field of competence to a basic scientific issue. If I enquire as to what a man is, the biologist explains that he is an animal, a naked ape, as Morris puts it. The anato- mist describes him as a complex of bones, muscles, brain, and bowel, organs which the histologist tells us consist of organized aggregations of cells. The cell biologist in turn describes the component structures of a cell, and the molecular biologist assures us that amino acids, nucleic acids, and oth- er molecules large and small constitute the essential ingredients of man. Physiolo- gists, whether they violate the integrity of the cell or the organ in their search for function, fit their discoveries neatly and comfortably into the relevant level of structure. The biochemists join the explor- ation at the molecular level with their ul- tra-sophisticated equipment and describe the interplay of the molecules and ions that are man. Physicists whose concern is with an apparently infinite series of ulti- mate particles now enable us to reduce man to a choice of many least common denominators until in the final analysis we are left with a purely mathematical de- scription of man and the universe. If I were to ask you at any stage of this progressive reduction whether or not you believed in the truth of the description, you would unhesitatingly answer in the affirmative. The experimental scientist, that is, the one who performs experiments, not the one who is a prototype of a scien? tist, believes with equal certitude in the reality of man, the liver, DNA, carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, molecules, electrons, and probably in the mathe- matics of space-time. There is not one 241</page><page sequence="2">242 V. G. Dethier among us who would deny the existence of molecules, atoms, or electrons. Yet there is not one among us who has sensed a mole- cule, atom, or electron. The world of which we are aware is a world of our own pri- vate sensations, the so-called perceived world. It is obvious that the perceived world is very different from the atomic world. The man perceived is not an inter- play of charges in space-time. According to some philosophies the man perceived may not even be there. Herein lies a dilemma that has troubled inquisitive men from Plato to the present?the problem of know- ing the real world. Pragmatic scientists usually retort with considerable impatience and annoyance that this is a problem for philosophers. Man is a fact; electrons are a fact. Some- day we may have instruments that will enable us to see them. If one doubts elec? trons, he has only to grasp a high tension wire. Knowledge is instantaneous and final. There may be a problem for philoso? phers; there is no problem for science, least of all zoologists. So say the pragma- tists. What I should like to point out in this address is the reality of the problem that exists for science. The problem of knowledge is the scientific problem; it is the zoological problem. Permit me to trace a brief history of this problem. In the Platonic theory of knowl? edge it is Ideas, objective essences indepen- dent of mind, that have reality. The sensed world is merely patterned after these ulti- mate realities. Locke, thinking about the problem, decided that we know nothing of substances except their attributes, and these through sensing. We cannot know the nature of the real world lying behind the sensed phenomena. You will note that he assumes there is a real world. Berkeley concluded that the only world of which Newtonian mechanics (the scientific world of his time) was true was a world re- vealed by the senses and that only the senses made it real. We can, he asserted, only make inferences about a world of hy- pothetical reality. These philosophical musings held little interest for science, indeed still interest but few, until Mach brought the metaphysical and scientific problems of knowledge to- gether. He carried the phenomenalism of Locke and Berkeley to the conclusion that science only constructs a model of what our senses tell us about nature. In other words, the only world of which we have a direct knowledge is that of the senses. The trend of thinking to the present time has been away from phenomenalism to a new realism as expounded principally by Russell and Whitehead. In essence the position held is that neither the objects of sense nor the pictures of science are illu- sionary. What we perceive exists and has the qualities we perceive it to have. Or, as you would have been maintaining from the beginning, the man before you is real, red-faced, blue-eyed, and his molecules and electrons are real even though they are not perceived. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the physical world (not that world itself) is only an abstraction. We construct a model of the world and trace the relation between its parts. These mod- els do not reveal the intrinsic nature of reality (science can construct a conceptual model of the universe but cannot deal with the problem of metaphysical reality), but using them we can infer that something exists independently of our thoughts, and the relations between its parts correspond to those of our model. This view does not imply that there are two universes. Whitehead goes to consider- able lengths to condemn the idea of bifur- cation. It is equally incorrect, he argues, to assert that molecular nature is the only real nature (for example, that green is merely a certain radiant energy and "the mind" adds the greenness as it is to affirm that molecules are only conceptual and the only real nature is apparent nature. In- stead, the constructions of science are merely expositions of the character of things perceived. To affirm that a person is a certain dance of molecules, electrons, and other particles or energies is merely to</page><page sequence="3">PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS 243 affirm that the things about him that are perceived have certain characters. The central problem of scientific en- deavor is, therefore, to relate the world of perception to the inferred physical con- struction in the belief that we are dealing with one orderly universe. In pursuing this end we are struck by the realization that the perceived world is preeminent. It is, beyond any argument, the starting point. It is, beyond any argument, a zoological problem. The zoologist studies animals. His interest in the molecular world can be peripheral and subordinate, but his con- cern with the perceptual world and with perception is central. I shall attempt to explain the relevance of this statement to zoological interests in general. Before inquiring into the nature of per? ception, a topic that traditionally engages psychologists and disenchants zoologists be- cause they suspect that "mind" is somehow necessarily involved, it is important to ask whose perception is to be honored in the pursuit of knowledge of the universe. The course actually followed is commendably democratic. We seek a consensus. It is en- tirely possible that in so doing we throw away information. In H. G. Wells' story of the one sighted-man in the world of the eyeless the majority of inhabitants believed in a world as reconstructed from sensa- tions of sound and touch. The sighted-man was adjudged mad by reason of the two- soft, pathological protuberances on either side of his nose. In a more realistic vein consider the world of the color-blind per- son. If the majority of people were color- blind, the world would be described as without color, just as to the man the ultra- violet world of the honeybee is perceived without ultra-violet. The "abnormal" per- son who possessed color vision would prob- ably be characterized by the rest of the world as suffering from a chromatic aber- ration. One might well ask the question do we all see the same things and is the majority opinion correct. Consider, for example, the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch. Were all of the monsters that peopled his canvases creatures of his imagination or did he ac- tually see them. Were the latter true, we would say that he painted his hallucina- tions. In general we do not believe in oth- er people's hallucinations, in trolls, le- prechauns, or other spirits. A rational science might well be impossible if we did. Consider, however, less extreme cases. It was believed for a time that El Greco painted the small-headed, elongate figures that he did because an astigmatism caused him to see people that way. We now know this to be untrue. His original sketching of the figures depicted normal proportions; the distortion was deliberately added later. Furthermore, had he actually seen people as distorted, he would have had to draw the figures as normal in order that they would appear to him with the same distor- tions as the models. There are other cases, however, where persons might actually be seeing a distorted world. Some children who are unable to write do in fact "see" writing as the gibberish that they repro- duce. For reasons of sanity as well as for social reasons one must learn to conform even though his perceptions give lie to the fact. He must come to terms, not with the world of abstract constructs, but with the world of his perceptions and the perceptions of the majority; he must conform biologically and socially. Otherwise he does not sur- vive. This capitulation suggests that science is a bit less objective, a bit less honest, than we prefer to believe. So far, however, the system works. Even though it is an approximation it operates satisfactor- ily?as long as we deal with man alone! As zoologists, however, we deal with oth? er perceiving creatures. In attempting to understand their relations with their physi- cal environment and one another, we make assessments in terms of our perceptu- al and our conjectural world. I do not mean that we are anthropomorphic; I mean that the data we employ to assess or describe the environment of animals are our perceptual data whether we like it or</page><page sequence="4">244 V. G. Dethier not. And when we employ instruments, we do not become any more objective nor do we provide ourselves with new senses or percepts; we merely translate events into our percepts (the electrode and oscillo- scope provide us with visual stimuli which do not tell us in the least how the animal in which the electrode is implanted per- ceives). We enlarge our existing sensory horizons (e.g., with microscopes, views of round earth from Apollo 8); we do not create new ones. In direct observation we shall be forever limited by our perceptual systems. In the final analysis there is no escaping this limitation on data collecting. On the other hand, strict adherence to the princi- ple that the raw material for inferring the nature of the real world should be derived from a consensus of man's perceptions can, and indeed has, led to error or at the very least to stalemate. Spallanzani, for exam- ple, was totally unable to comprehend how bats oriented without sight and in "silence" because he was thinking solely in terms of human perceptions. During the period of World War I, Santschi, studying the orientation of ants in the desert, dis- covered that some sort of celestial naviga- tion was involved but that the sun itself was not a necessary cue. Thinking, like Spallanzani, in terms of human percep- tion, he decided that the ants could see the stars in the daytime. Today we are con- fronted with other biological mysteries, the riddle of bird navigation being one. Does avian navigation remain a riddle because we still think within the framework of our own perceptual abilities? The bird's eye possesses many capabilities that the human eye lacks. It can take in at a glance a picture which man can appreciate only by scanning bit by bit; it can detect actual movement of the sun; it has superior resolving power. Independently of vision, birds may be capable of detecting other parameters of their environment unappre- ciated by man. As Matthews has pointed out, the fact that a human aviator cannot disentangle the effects of acceleration, rota- tion, and other postural changes from the effect of gravity is no indication that birds cannot. There is very little information concerning what a bird can sense in flight. There is no reason a priori to believe that all animals live in our perceptual world. If we believe in the adaptiveness of behavior, then the world that animals must come to terms with is their perceptu? al world not ours. This is the world we must learn about in order to understand animals, their behavior, their ecology. We now know, for example, that ants and bees do not see stars in the daytime. For them patterns of polarized light constitute the visual sky. Similarly, the white flower is not necessarily white nor all yellow flowers necessarily yellow or even identical. It has been known for over a quarter of a centu- ry that insects see ultra-violet. Employing as simple a device as a pin-hole camera (because ordinary lenses filter out ultra- violet and because not all research workers of those days enjoyed the affluence of con- temporary society which can supply quartz lenses) Lutz made some of the earliest photographs of flowers as insects see them in the ultra-violet rich sunshine. Patterns appear that are unseen by us. The same is true in the case of mimicry. Butterflies that mimic one another perfectly to our eyes do not at all resemble each other in in? sects' eyes. It is indeed a very different visual world that the insect perceives. In arguing that we should pay more careful attention to the other perceptual worlds, I am not suggesting that we should invent novel sense modalities. Neither should we arbitrarily exclude the possibili- ty of sensory systems quite unlike our own. Electric fish sensitive to electric fields sur- rounding them enjoy a sense modality which we lack completely. It is worth em- phasizing, however, that sensitivity to elec- trical events, which in these fish has evolved into a highly tuned sensory system, is basically characteristic of cells. The fact that all organisms are composed of essen- tially the same stuff imposes limits on the kinds of stimuli that can be effective. The</page><page sequence="5">Presidential Address 245 nature of cellular material simply excludes some events from the role of stimuli. Ad- mittedly one can exercise an excess of cau- tion in this respect as well as undue li- cense, although the latter is more in evi- dence. There is little justification for pro- posing novel sense modalities and new hy- potheses for situations in which completely adequate hypotheses already exist. The study of olfaction seems to invite this kind of excess. In view of the adequacy of mo- lecular olfactory theory, it hardly appears necessary to resurrect periodically the in- fra-red theory. Furthermore, there is no room for uncritical, experimentally sloppy, or non-scientific pursuits as so elegantly demonstrated by believers in water- devining and ESP. At this point we arrive at the sticky question of the meaning of perception. The simplest definition is: "how the world looks" or "what things are alike and what things are different". But how do we set about to fathom this mystery? About the only way by which we can ascertain what things are alike and what things are differ? ent for an animal is to observe how it behaves toward these things under careful- ly controlled conditions. If fortune favors us, we shall be able to conclude that the animal in question behaves toward two or more things "as though" they were the same or "as though" they were different. Though it may be difficult for us to discern clearly beyond this point, we have not yet reached an impasse. Electrophysiology now tells us that an event in the "real" world causes certain chemico-physical changes in a receptor which in turn gener- ates action potentials which in their turn are passed from one neuron to the next on into the brain, through it, and out. Some- where in the sequence some people insert "mind". Somewhere in the circuit people assert that perception occurs, usually in the brain, although it would be difficult to prove this. Since philosophers of the era of Russell and Whitehead incorporated con- temporary advances in neurophysiology into their consideration of the subject, electrodes have been pushed ever farther into the central nervous system so that our present knowledge of events transpiring there, while still primitive, greatly exceeds that available to them. Perhaps the time has come for philosophers interested in perception to re-analyze their concepts in light of recent physiological advances. Here the findings of the neuro-physiologist are distinctly relevant. Regardless of what perception really is, there are in any case several levels at which one can attempt to collect data from which he might infer how the world looks to a particular animal. Consider first the receptors. Any constraints here would obviously limit an animal's perceptual world. If eyes are lacking, it is reasonable to assume that the animal cannot see, al- though even that conclusion is dangerous. Does the blinded sparrow which has its rhythm set by light penetrating its skull "see" this light? In any case, what an ani? mal cannot sense it cannot perceive. Con? sider, for example, the gustatory sense of the blowfly. Each one of the taste hairs on its proboscis is equipped with a sense cell that responds to water, one that responds to certain carbohydrates, and two that re- spond to salt. By placing recording elec? trodes on the dendrites of these chemosen- sitive neurons the experimenter can ascer- tain which substances in the environment can be detected at this level and which ones can be discriminated from which oth? er ones. It is clear, for example, that the fly has the sensory equipment that would permit distinguishing water from salt and both from sugar. It is equally clear that there is no possibility of the fly distinguish? ing sodium chloride from potassium chlor- ide. Electrophysiological analyses further show that synthetic sweeteners, saccharine and the cyclamates, are not perceived by the fly. Similar studies of the taste recep? tors on the legs show that the fly can discriminate some but not all acids from salt. Analyses of action potentials generated by the olfactory receptors of caterpillars in</page><page sequence="6">246 V. G. Dethier response to odors impinging on the anten- nae and palpi indicate that these receptors are capable of sensing a complex world of odors but that some odors which are very similar to man {e.g., citral and limonene) are detected as very different by the sense organs of the caterpillar. The antennae of caterpillars also bear receptors for temper- ature and humidity of a sensitivity that detects, by way of evaporation, the differ- ence between a leaf that is transpiring and one that is not, a leaf that has been bitten into and one that has not. More detailed analyses by Schneider's group in Germany of the odors generated by female moths to attract males reveal that some species lack receptors able to sense the odors of other species while for some receptors the odors of different species are confused. Some of these odors cannot be detected by man at all. From these kinds of experiments we can infer that there is a world of tastes, odors, and temperature gradients that the animals are potentially capable of perceiving; that is, the requisite sensory equipment is pres- ent. At this level of analysis we cannot yet infer what the animal actually perceives, but we can infer what worlds do not exist for it. Sensory analysis sets the perceptual lim- its but of itself tells little about perception. A short description of a combined behavi- oral and electrophysiological analysis of a fly's response to salt will illustrate this point. By implanting a reference electrode in the abdomen of a fly and then placing a minute glass pipette recording electrode containing a stimulating solution on one labellar hair it is possible to record the receptor response to the stimulus and also record the behavioral response. If a pipette containing 0.05 M NaCl (a concentration below the threshold of the salt receptor) is placed on one hair, the water receptor begins to fire impulses into the central ner- vous system. After a barrage of 100 milli- seconds duration the fly responds by extend- ing the proboscis. It is this act of exten- sion which causes contact with the re- cording electrode to be broken thus estab- lishing the fact that the sensory input; preceding the behavior lasted 100 msec. If, instead of water, the pipette contains 0.1 or 0.2 M NaCl, the salt receptor fires 100 milliseconds-worth of impulses into the central nervous system. Again the fly ex- tends its proboscis. Although extension fol- lowed input from the water receptor in the first instance and input from the salt re? ceptor in the second, there is no way of knowing whether the fly perceives the two stimuli as different even though the dis- tinctness of the receptors allows for this possibility. When a third test is made, this time with 0.5 M NaCl, the salt receptor again responds; however, the frequency of firing is greater. Whereas 14 impulses were delivered to the central nervous system in the first 100 msec of stimulation by 0.1?0.2 M NaCl, 17 impulses were delivered in the first 100 msec of stimulation by 0.5 M NaCl. The fly withdraws its proboscis from the higher concentration, whereas it had extended it to the lower. Extension is the initial step in acceptance; retraction, the initial step in rejection. Whether the fly perceives the first solution as watery and the second as salty, or the first as slightly salty, and the second as very salty is not important. What is important is that the first is perceived as acceptable and the sec? ond as unacceptable. That is, one propor- tion of salt molecules and water molecules is perceived as different from another pro- portion. Analysis of the sense organs alone could have told us that the potential for discrimination was there, but obviously the perception is not a capacity of the sense organs. Nothing in our own experience of salt could have told us how the fly would have responded to these two solutions. Pursuing the matter of the fly's world still further, it can be shown that that which is acceptable under one set of inter- nal conditions is totally unacceptable un? der another. A recently fed fly refuses to accept sugar. Sensory analysis reveals that the sugar receptors are faithfully transmit- ting into the central nervous system the</page><page sequence="7">Presidential Address 247 same information that they transmit when the fly is hungry. We now know that there are two receptors in the foregut of the fly which monitor the transfer of previously ingested food from an alimentary cul-de- sac, the crop, where it has been stored, to the midgut whence it is transported to the blood. The foregut receptors supply input to the brain which counteracts the sensory input from the mouthparts. Conditions in the external world have not changed, only the internal state of the fly has changed. This latter change, however, influences how the fly responds to external condi? tions. Still another situation illustrates how conditions within the animal itself deter- mine how it assesses the outside world. If one hair of a water-satiated fly is stimulated with water, the water receptor in that hair dutifully sends action potentials into the central nervous system; however, no behavior is forthcoming. Internal receptors responsive to the state of water balance of the fly exert an inhibitory influence in the central nervous system. Now, sugar is touched to another labellar hair. The sug? ar receptor in this hair generates action potentials; after 20 to 80 msec of input the fly extends its proboscis. A period of time without any stimulation is allowed to elapse?15 to 240 seconds. Once again water is applied to the original hair. Once again the water receptor fires its same mes- sage. This time, however, the fly responds with a vigorous proboscis extension. It is just as though the fly entertained a halluc- ination that the water was sugar. What appears to have happened is that the prior brief stimulation with sugar induced a perseverant central excitatory state so that input from the water receptor, until now inhibited by enteroceptive activity, can effectively "get through" to the relevant pathways in the behavioral circuit. But even given no interference from within, there is still no assurance that the sensory message ever "gets into" the cen? tral nervous system unaltered. Even if it were a faithful image of the outside world, how distorted it becomes on its internal travels and how great its informational loss! Look, for example, at the peripheral neural circuitry in the vertebrate retina, the invertebrate optic lobe, or the verte? brate olfactory bulb. Since we know that there is not a one-to-one transmission across synapses, we cannot help but be dis- concerted by the liberties that all these interlocking interneurons must be taking with the pristine impression of the outside world that the sense organs are delivering to them. Nowhere is this more beautifully dem- onstrated than in the acoustic system of those moths which respond to the ul- trasonic cries of hunting bats by frantic evasive flight. These cries are series of pulses. A single acoustic cell in the moth ear transmits to the central nervous system a message which describes the pulse dura- tion, pulse intensity, pulse repetition rate, and pulse train duration of a bat cry. Sound frequency within the pulse is not detected; that is, the moth is tone-deaf. Of the various interneurons to which this in- formation is delivered, one distorts pulse duration, one filters out pulse duration and intensity, one filters out pulse repeti? tion rate. Of all of the information provided by the acoustic cell, apparently only pulse train duration reaches the in- nermost recesses of the central nervous sys? tem intact. All of these studies of the sensory physiology of animals, of interneuronal participation, and of the modulating effects on the sensory message by central states and enteroceptive feedback force one to certain firm conclusions. First, the world perceived by an animal is distorted for each in his own way by the limitations and aberrations of his own unique sensing devices. Second, perception, whatever it may be, is not a sensory phenomenon. The most convincing indication that percep? tion is independent of sensory input, in the sense that it is a mediation of sensory input, comes from personal considerations of ambiguous or "flip-flop" figures, one of</page><page sequence="8">248 V. G. Dethier the simplest being the cube which upon being stared at changes back and forth from a cube being viewed from above to one being viewed from below. It is inter- esting to speculate on the possibility that other animals may also experience these perceptual flip-flops. Many times when an animal is trained in a visual discrimination problem it only responds a certain per cent of the time. The experimenter's first reaction is that the situation must be more rigorously controlled. His final reaction many experiments later is that there is an inherent biological variability which rep- resents the ultimate limitation on conform- ity. One wonders if in some tasks in visu? al discrimination the stimulus object may not be ambiguous in the sense of flip- flopping and the animal sees the "correct" stimulus only part of the time. In insects at least there is some evidence that illusions might exist; insects are known to respond to apparent motion, that is, stroboscopic motion as though it were real. A third conclusion is that it is each ani? mal which in its own way makes its per? ceived world different. Even when the sense organs do not filter differently it is what the central nervous system does with the input that defines the outside world. A pattern of action potentials from a partic- ular photoreceptor may be identical in ev- ery respect with those from a taste receptor or any other receptor. Neither one is any part of a model of the outside world. What the central nervous system does with them is what constitutes the world as far as that particular animal is concerned. The ani? mal acts on the basis of these neural states; if they correspond well with extramural conditions, the animal has come to terms with that world. One does not have to know what perception is to realize its im- portance epistemologically. To assert that a worm does not perceive is unwarranted. The fact that I shall never know if or how a worm perceives in the subjective sense is no more or less important than the fact that I shall never know how you perceive. In the sense that all animals respond to a world detected through their sense organs and central nervous systems (or equiva- lent) they perceive. Recognition of the fact that animals have private perceptual worlds transcends in value the mere knowledge of how they relate to those worlds. When, as sometimes happens, their world disagrees not only with our perceptual world but with our conjectural world, then we must reexam- ine that conjectural world. When there is agreement, we have enlarged our consen- sus and the validity of our model of nature is strengthened. If an animal "sees" a dif? ferent world, there must be some validity to it because he relates successfully to it and survives. In other words, we can use ani? mals as instruments to widen our sensory horizons; their behavior is the needle on the dial. This zoological democratizing is all the more important because no one animal enjoys a complete spectrum of per- ceptions. I cannot completely agree with Whitehead's statement that "Evolution in the complexity of life means an increase in the types of objects directly sensed." We ourselves are blind to too many perceptual objects. Our auditory world is more lim- ited than that of crickets, bats, and dogs insofar as the total range of pitch is con- cerned. A summer's evening must be in- credibly noisy to a cricket even though it is tone-deaf. Similarly, the olfactory world of mammalian carnivores and of phyto- phagous insects must be bewilderingly rich compared to ours. We are totally unaware of the nuances of smell that the dog ex- periences and the power of sex attractants that exert such slavish effects on male moths. We are blind to the bee's world of ultra-violet and polarized light. We are in- sensitive to the electrical world of electric eels. We have faith that the molecular world is real, but do not be misled into believing that it is any more real than any other. It is not the world to which organisms react behaviorally. It is a space-time world. Complete organisms are the enduring enti- ties. Studying them and their perceptions</page><page sequence="9">PRESIDENTIAL AdDRESS 249 leads us no less surely to an understanding of the universe than when we are led down molecularly paved paths through utopian gardens of seductively entwined double he- lices.
