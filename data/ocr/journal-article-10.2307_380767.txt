<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE "SUFFERING HUMANITARIAN" THEME THE "SUFFERING HUMANITARIAN" THEME IN SHELLY'S PROMETHEUS UNBOUND AND IN CERTAIN POEMS OF ALFRED DE VIGNY WILLIAM G. HOPE University of Wisconsin At the outset it might be well to make a few general observa- tions on the fundamental differences which exist between poetry in England and the same type of literary creation in France. Thus, I hope, we shall be able to comprehend better the wide gulf which necessarily separates any French from any given English poet, and to see that, although viewed from an objective vantage point Alfred de Vigny may, in some respects, appear so inferior to Shelley that any attempt to compare the two seems ridiculous, Vigny has never- theless an indisputable worth which makes him unique among French poets of his own and preceding generations. Naturally, my own preference for Shelley is admittedly founded upon the fact that my tastes are predeterminately Anglo-Saxon and that no Anglo-Saxon could ever appreciate French poetry for the qualities which endear it to the French themselves. What, then, are these peculiar national tastes and criteria? In the first place, the most successful French poets, from Marot to Francis Jammes, have almost without exception been those in whom intellectual restraint has been dominant over uncontrolled lyrical exuberance and spontaniety. This quality, so much admired 'by the great critic of French poetry, Ferdinand Bruneti&amp;re, seems innate in Vigny; it is because of it that he is rapidly becoming the only one of the four great Romantic poets whom the present wholly de-Romanticised generation still respects. In technique, Vigny has the coldly objective poise of the best neo-classical tradi- tion. Now in England the situation is entirely different; pure lyricism and unbridled imagination have characterized the Anglo- Saxon poets from the very outset. Few Frenchmen could have caught the spontaneity and the verve of Shakespeare's sonnets or 401</page><page sequence="2">THE FRENCH REVIEW of the last act of Prometheus Unbound. This lack of over-flowing lyricism is replaced with the French by a meticulous attention to form and to cadence, as prescribed by reason and good sense. It was to little avail that the 1830 generation revolted against Boi- leau; for this supremely reasonable critic had based his dictates upon indisputable national characteristics which all the Ste-Beuves and Lamartines in the world could hardly hope to obliterate. Closely akin to this preference for form rather than, let us say, inspiration, is the Frenchman's predilection for style and for senti- ment. Given these two elements, he does not care to have his poetry built upon a penetrating philosophy or a complicated system of thought. Thus we are not surprised when we find numerous critics referring to Vigny as the "sole thinker of the Romantic move- ment" and the "creator of philosophical poetry in France," although to us he may seem only a rather shallow thinker and surely nothing at all of a philosopher. It is certainly not necessary to remind the Anglo-Saxon that the situation in England has always been diametrically opposed and that there no such enthusiastic appre- ciations could ever have been uttered. But between Shelley and Vigny there are differences more specific than those founded upon their inherent racial make-ups. As to imagery, Vigny is indubitably more concrete - that is to say, his every idea is conceived in terms of an objectively allegorical figure. In his system of esthetics, the pome is simply. une pensee philosophique mise en scxne sous une forme 6pique ou dramatique. Shelley likewise ,at least in the poem in question, has this dramatic procedure; but in general, he is far more abstract, far less con- crete than is the French writer with whom I am endeavoring to compare him. By the same token, Vigny's ideas, though they are almost never based upon morbid introspection (as was likely to be the case with the other French Romantics), are limited to the sphere of his own personal experiences. For instance, the direct cause for the tirade against women in La Colbre de Samson was admittedly his notorious rupture with Madame Dorval. Now, Shelley, as seen in the Prometheus, has more of the broad, imper- sonal approach of the true philosopher. Naturally, personal ex- 402</page><page sequence="3">THE "SUFFERING HUMANITARIAN" THEME periences and environments exerted a certain determining influence, but on the whole the Prometheus Unbound is amazingy near the Utopian realm of pure, unprejudiced thought. Finally, before launching into a discussion of the question immediately in hand, I should perhaps mention the fact that, al- though I am familiar with almost all the writings of Alfred de Vigny and of his most important critics, I have been able to find no direct evidence or mention of any direct influence upon him of the works of Shelley. However, the Prometheus Unbound appeared in 1820, and in view of Vigny's excellent command of English, it is more than probable that he had read Shelley's drama before the publication of his own first poems in 1822 and certainly before the publication of Eloa ou la sewur des anges in 1824. There might perhaps have been a visible influence, had it not been for the im- measurable difference between the personalities of the two poets. For Vigny was a proud and isolated aristocrat, one who would never lower himself by contact with the crowd, or, even in fact, by dining in public. As such, he must have had a certain external disdain, if internal admiration, for a young upstart, though an aristocratic upstart, such as Shelley, whose writings and whose actions were dominated by a belligerent "passion for reforming the world." And yet, he was never for a moment ashamed of his fondness for Bryon, whose actions often had little more dignity than those of Shelley; perhaps, however, Byron's eternal con- sciousness of his own nobility gave him a certain attraction in the eyes of the haughtily dignified Vigny. Then, in view of Alfred de Vigny's personal hauteur, we are little surprised to find that his humanitarian ideas and his concep- tions of humanitarian heroes are scented with the remote aloofness of the ivory tower and that his sense of pity is hopelessly unreal and abstract. In one breath he theorizes: I love and pity humanity. Nature is for me an insolently eternal ornament, upon which is thrown that short-lived and sublime mari- onette called man. But in the next, we see how impractical is that "love and pity." Oh my soul, flee into the desert places. Assuredly ,he could never have plunged himself into a second Irish crisis, Shelley fashion. For when Shelley speaks 403</page><page sequence="4">THE FRENCH REVIEW Of heaven-opprossed mortality, we know from the very facts of his career that his pity was com- plete and active, not merely cerebral. Nevertheless, Mdise, the first of Vigny's unfortunate humani- tarian heroes, is endowed with the true Promethean spirit of altru- ism. He is the humanitarian sage whose wisdom has given him no happiness and who can find no companionship among mortal men. He longs for rest, knowing like Prometheus that Peace is in the grave, and in the midst 6f his solitude cries out: J'ai march6 devant tous, triste et seul dans ma gloire, Et j'ai dit dans mon cceur: Que vouloir A present? Pour dormir sur un sein mon front est trop pesant, Ma main laisse l'effroi sur la main qu'elle touche, L'orage est dans ma voix, l'6clair est sur ma bouche; Aussi, loin de m'aimer, voila qu'ils tremblent tous, Et, quand j'ouvre les bras, on tombe A mes genoux. 0 Seigneur! j'ai v&amp;cu puissant et solitaire, Laissez-moi m'endormir du sommeil de la terre. But the humanitarian Moses suffers only from his isolation, and this solitude is after all little more than an intellectualized manifestation of the Chateaubriand homme fatal malady. How- ever, the second of Vigny's ill-fated altruists, Eloa, is a figure of true Promethean proportions (in miniature) and as such must undergo actual spiritual and physical suffering. Her fate is due to the cruelty of an inexorable Deity, a Deity who, however, has none of the philosophical symbolism of Shelley's Jupiter. Eloa, an angel born of Christ's tear, wishes to relieve the misery of the human race, which (as we see in the poem Les Destinies) has been tor- tttred by a heartless Creator since the very first day of creation. Descending toward the earth, she meets a stranger who further excites her pity, for he pretends to have been exiled from Heaven pour avoir aimS, pour avoir sauv&amp;. Desiring to rescue him, too, she gives herself to him, and is seduced and lost for eternity. And so love and magnanimity have proved disastrous for another altruist. (Later on, I shall contrast Vigny's conception of love with that of Shelley.) 404</page><page sequence="5">THE "SUFFERING HUMANITARIAN" THEME The motif of the isolation and suffering of the humanitarian, and especially of the genius-poet-humanitarian, is heard again in the prose works, Stello, story of three poets: pale youths who perished, unupbraiding, and in Chatterton, a dramatization of the third part of Stello. But their isolation is not wholly regrettable. (And here we see Vigny, the contented contemplator, as opposed to Shelley, the belligerent man of action.) For Vigny holds that the poet, alone and free, is better able to accomplish his mission, to follow the conditions of his being, diseengaged from the influence of associations, even from the finest associations. For Solitude is the source of inspiration Solitude is holy. This is an utterance that Shelley never would, nor could, have voiced; he, and his Prometheus, are believers in the efficacy of partical activity, and the only reason for their enforced isolation is the cruelty either of Deity or of the stupidity of public opinion. The best expression of his ideas on the maltreated altruist can be found in Vigny's Le Mont des oliviers. Here the hero is the supreme humanitarian, Christ himself, whose spirit contrasts tragi- cally with that of his oppressive, frigidly silent Father. Alone on the Mount of Olives, the Saviour feels death approaching and, con- scious of the fact that his charitable work is as yet unfinished, prays to God for longer life. Mais je vais la quitter, cette indigente terre, N'ayant que soulev6 ce manteau de misere Qui l'entoure a grands plis, drap lugubre et fatal, Que d'un bout tient le doute et de l'autre le Mal. Mal et Doutel En un mot je puis les mettre en poudre. Vous les aviez prevus, laissez-moi vous absoudre De les avoir permis.--C'est l'accusation Qui p.se de partout sur la creationl Une terreur profonde, une angoisse infinie Redoublent sa torture et sa longue agonie. Il regarde longtemps, longtemps cherche sans voir. Comnnme un marbre de deuil tout le ciel 6tait noir; La Terre sans clartes, sans astre et sans aurore, 405</page><page sequence="6">THE FRENCH REVIEW Et sans clart6s de 1'dme ainsi qu'elle est encore, Fr6mlissait. - Dans le bois ii entendit des pas, Et puis ii vit r6der la torche de Judas. And so, the worst of all humanity's oppressions is her ignorance, which Deity will not permit the Christ to dispel. Unlike the vision- ary Prometheus, the Saviour is not able to revolt and to dispell this ignorance in spite of the commands of the cruel and stupid Creator. A similar admiration for Christ is seen in the crucifix vision scene of the first act of Prometheus Unbound. Here is an effective risume of the whole notion of the misery which true humanitarian- ism inevitably brings to its possessor. In addition, however, Shelley inserts an attack on the barbarism of traditional Christianity, and especially of Catholicism, which have missed the true spirit of the Saviour. Here, again, is evidence of a decidedly practical turn of mind which Vigny does not possess. IoNE. What didst thou see? PANTHEA. A woeful sight: a youth With patient looks nailed to a crucifix. FURY. Behold an emblem: those who do endure Deep wrongs for man, and scorn, and chains but heap Thousandfold torments on themselves and him. PROMETHEUS. Remit the anguish of that lighted stare; 0, horrible I Thy name I will not speak, It hath become a curse. I see, I see The wise, the mild, the lofty, and the just, Whom they slaves hate for being like to thee, Some hunted by foul lies from their heart's home... Some linkeds to corpses in unwholesome cells: Some--Hear I not the multitude laugh loud? Impaled in lingering fire: and mighty realms Float by my feet, like sea-uprooted isles, Whose sons are kneaded down in common blood By the red light of their own burning homes. FURY. Blood thou canst see, and fire; and canst hear groans; Worse things, unheard, unseen, remain behind. PROMETHEUS. Worse? FURY. In each human heart terror survives ... 406</page><page sequence="7">THE "SUFFERING HUMANITARIAN" THEME It is the same lamentable story of fear and ignorance and doubt. Before leaving this question of Deity, I should remark the es- sential differences between Shelleys conception of that blind force and Vigny's idea of the same. For the latter, his old Hebrew Jehovah is merely an objective oppressor, but one whose actual, even anthropomorphic existence the poet cannot seriously question. For Shelley, on the other hand, Jupiter is no real being, not even a representation of a real being, but rather an allegorical symbol for certain malignant forces, such as ignorance and greed, which have long been at work in society and which in the end will spell heartless tyranny and untold suffering for humanity in general. So, Shelley's venom is for tyranny, rather than for any actual Greek or Jewish mythological oppressor. What, then, are the consolations for the altruist, other than the consciousness that he has done his bit toward lifting the lugu- brious "mantle of misery" which shrouds humanity? For the younger Vigny, these consolations are indeed inadequate, because his humanitarians can as yet see no concrete results of their ef- fort. Furthermore, they are denied the solace and respite which ,Prometheus is able to find in love and in the consciousness of the fact that Nature is in ultimate accord with his strivings. Vigny, deceived by Madame Dorval, cannot do otherwise than detest womankind. In La ColBre de Samson, she is represented as another heartless and oppressive element. Une lutte 6ternelle en tout temps, en tout lieu, Se livre sur la terre, en presence de Dieu Entre la bont6 d'homme et la ruse de Femme, Car la Femme est un etre impur de corps et d'1me. Elle rit et triomphe; en sa froideur savante, Au milieu de ses seurs elle attend et se vante . . . Compare this obviously prejudiced attitude with the sentiments expressed in Prometheus Unbound, where Asia is, I think, the symbol of intellectualized womankind and of disciplined love. Given or returned. All love is sweet, And women, too, frank, beautiful, and kind As free heaven which rains fresh light and dew 407</page><page sequence="8">THE FRENCH REVIEW On the wide earth, past; gentle radiant forms, From custom's evil taint exempt and pure; Speaking the wisdom once they could not think, Looking emotions once they feared to feel, And changed to all which once they dared not be, Yet being now, made earth like heaven ... How different was the influence of Mary W. Shelley and of her feminine-rightist mother from that of the perfidious Marie Dorval and of the stupid Lydia B. de Vigny! Another of Prometheus' consoling compensations is found in pantheistic harmony with the kind, omniscient, omnipotent forces of Nature, symbolized in the admirable personage of Demagorgon. But to Vigny Nature is equally as malign as are Deity and woman. La Maisan du berger pictures the universe as l'impassible theitre Que ne peut remuer le pied de ses acteurs. However, both Shelley and Vigny agree on the correct atti- tude which the ill-used humanitarian should in the end assume. The post-script to Le Mont des Oliviers, (added many years after the original composition of the poem), takes up a theme which is culminated in La Mort du loup. Le juste opposera le didain! a l'absence, Et ne r6pondra plus que par un froid silence Au silence 6ternel de la Divinit6. But it is the noble wolf which knows best how to die without uttering a cry. Comment on doit quitter la vie et tous ses maux C'est vous qui le savez, sublimes animaux! A voir ce que l'on fut sur la terre et ce qu'on laisse, Seul le silence est grand; tout le reste est faiblesse. In prose, the same theme is developed in the Servitude et Gran- deur militaires. Shelley's Prometheus from the first has been the uncomplain- ing stoic. The Titan looks as ever, firm, not proud . . . Proud sufferer, who art thog? 408</page><page sequence="9">THE "SUFFERING HUMANITARIAN" THEME However, he can never be contented in his stoical resignation; he is the consistent idealist, the constant worker who firmly believes that eventually his ideal will be attained. However, as Vigny grows older, his humanitarianism takes on a new element of hope, an element which was present in the innately optimistic Shelley from the very outset, and which he symbolized so beautifully in the character of Iona. There was never a time when Shelley could not See a disenchanted nation Spring like day from desolation; To Truth its state is dedicate, And Freedom leads it forth, her mate. Vigny, on the other hand did not realize until very late in life, long after the hey-day of Romanticism, that there was some hope of distant progress, that the ashes of the present civilizatio would not always be barren and sterile. This hope he expresses in a few of the later insertions in his Journal d'un poRte and in kcertain poems written shortly before his death. A day will come, he says, when all the humanitarian martyrs of history will revolt and will wreak bloody vengeance of their heartless Creator. (What a far cry from the loving spirit of Prometheus, who must unsay his curse before he can consider ultimate liberty and progress!) But the dying Vigny realizes, as Shelley had done in his youth many years before, that the final amelioration of man's earthly condition will come about only through the dissemination of knowl- edge and of science, through mass-pervading intellectual progress. Thus alone the thwarted humanitarian's ideal may eventually be ,realized. In his last production, L'Esprit pur, he contemplates this happy but distant day: Ton rdgne est arriv6, Pur Esprit, roi de monde l Quand, ton aile d'azur dans la nuit nous surprit, Dtesse de nos meeurs, la guerre vagabonde, R.gnait sur nos aieux. Aujourd'hui, c'est I'Ecrit, L'Ecrit Universel, parfois imp&amp;rissable, Que tu graves au marbre on traines sur le sable. Colomrbe an bec d'airaintI Visible Saint-Esprit. Eventually, as we see in La Bouteille d la metr, even the forces of Nature and Deity himself, both formerly so hostile, will be willing to aid man in the preservation of knowledge, and thus the humani- 409</page><page sequence="10">THE FRENCH REVIEW tarian's ideal of an earthly paradise may one day become a reality. Thus, at the very hour of his death, Vigny had begun to recant, and to repudiate his early pessimism. Now, with Shelley, there was never the slightest doubt con- cerning the ultimate attainment of his humanitarian ideal. The Prometheus Unbound offers us a well thought-out system of op- timistic philosophy teaching that universal perfection may be re- alized through the extermination of the tyranny of greed and stupidity, through cooperation with the forces of Nature, through love, and through integration between imagination and sciences, in the last of which his faith is unbounded. He approaches the sub- ject of the humanitarian with a profound fund of thought already well formed and complete in its optimistic convictions. But Vigny's thought, never so profound at that of Shelley, is constantly only in the process of formation and of evolution toward what, too late, becomes a fairly definite goal. Thus, it is not surprising that we find all of Vigny's message, and a good deal more desides, epitomized in a single stanza, the closing one, from Prometheus Unbound. To suffer woes which Hope thinks infinite; To forgive wrongs darker than death or night; To defy power, which seems omnipotent; To love and bear; to hope 'till Hope creates From its own wreck the thing it contemplates; Neither to change, nor falter, nor repent; This, like the glory, Titan, is to be Good, great and joyous, beautiful and free: This is alone Life, Joy, Empire, and Victory. 410</page></plain_text>
