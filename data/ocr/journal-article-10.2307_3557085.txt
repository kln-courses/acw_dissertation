<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARKS OF DISTINCTION: ROCK ART AND ETHNIC IDENTIFICATION IN THE GREAT BASIN Angus R. Quinlan and Alanah Woody Great Basin ethnography contains little information concerning rock art, suggesting that much of it is pre-Numic. The presence of historic rock art, however, should permit differences between pre-Numic and Numic populations to be identified. Anthropo- logical theory suggests pioneer groups use ritual to socialize the landscape. Rock art may also be associated with colonizing groups to secure access to new resources. Numic populations seem to have responded to pre-Numic rock art through modifi- cation of the art. Once the landscape had been re-socialized rock art was generally avoided. This explains why rock art pro- duction became sporadic, and memory of it lost. La etnografia de Great Basin contiene poca informacidn del arte rupestre, sugiriendo que mucho del este arte en roca es pre- Numic. La presencia del arte rupestre historico debe identificar diferencias entre poblaciones pre-Numic y Numic. La teoria antropoldgica sugiere que grupos pioneros realizaron rituales de socializacion en el paisaje. El arte rupestre estaria asociado con la colonizacidn de grupos, para afianzar acceso a nuevos recursos. Las poblaciones Numic parecen haber respondido al arte pre- Numic a traves de la modificacion del arte. Una vez que el paisaje se habia resocializado, el arte rupestre generalmente se evito. Esto explica porque la produccion del arte rupestre fue esporddica, y su memoria se perdio. E thnographic analogy has always played an important role in archaeological analysis and in the study of prehistoric art, with ethnohis- tory and ethnography currently regarded as provid- ing the "key" to rock art interpretation (e.g., Lewis-Williams 1981). The danger of over-reliance on ethnographic data to model the social and cultural processes of prehistory is "that we can never discover in the data of the past any generalizations that we do not already know" (Bailey 1983:174). However, ethnography and anthropological theory provide an essential starting point for archaeological interpre- tation, since behavior in the present provides our only data for modeling the social dynamics that cre- ate archaeological records. In this paper we seek to outline how an approach grounded in the anthro- pology of ritual, contextualized by Great Basin ethnography, permits the rock art of this region (Fig- ure 1) to address questions of prehistoric social process and broader archaeological concerns, such as the dispersal of the Numic language family. This debate has centered on the merits of a late prehistoric migration (ca. 1000-1500 B.P.) of Numic populations northward and eastward from the south or western Basin (Lamb 1958; Steward 1940) vs. one around the end of the middle Holocene (ca. 5000 B.P.) (Aikens and Witherspoon 1986:15; Grayson 1994). The principal problem has been identifying items of material culture that can serve to distinguish the historically known Numic populations from pre- ceding Great Basin groups (Fowler 1994:104, 112; Sutton and Rhode 1994:10). We suggest that the archaeological residues of systems of ritual practice are potentially a valuable way of identifying distinct sociocultural systems in the past. Guarding against offering an essentialist theorization of Numic "cul- ture" is important since variations in ritual practice suggested by Great Basin rock art reflect different modes of social legitimation, but not necessarily dis- tinct cultural identities envisaged by reconstructions of linguistic prehistory.

Hydrographic Great Basin showing historic tribal territories. adopted models of interpretation specific to parietal art. An unintended consequence of this practice has been to construct rock art as an object of study out- side the domain of mainstream archaeology. Both hunting magic and more recent neuropsychological or shamanistic approaches illustrate the difficulties in reconciling theories of rock art functions derived from general anthropological theory and ethnogra- phy with actual rock art data. Theorizing the con- texts of rock art use and production is hampered by the paucity of direct ethnographic' data relating to rock art (excepting Australia and a few other regions) (Taqon and Chippindale 1998:7; Ucko and Rosen- feld 1967:159-160). This has made rock art inter- pretation heavily reliant on general anthropological theory, yet the very nature of rock art data makes it difficult to discriminate between alternative expla- nations based on the archaeological evidence alone. Hunting magic draws on general anthropological theory regarding the deployment of magic in the rou- tines of economic reproduction (e.g., Malinowski 1935:61-68; Steward 1938:34). It theorized that Great Basin rock art was made and used in rituals that sought to secure successful hunting of game ani- mals (Heizer and Baumhoff 1962:11, 240; Nissen 1995:71). Rock art imagery was suggested to depict hunting scenes, game animals or symbolize themes of fertility (Nissen 1995:71). Rock art was argued to 373</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY be predominantly located on game migration routes and/or in association with hunting blinds and other hunting features (e.g., projectile points) (Heizer and Baumhoff 1962:9, 281, 239 and Table 6; Nissen 1995:69, 71). More recently Great Basin rock art has been approached from the perspective of the neuropsy- chological or shamanistic model (e.g., Stoffle et al. 2000; Whitley 1994, 1998a). This approach is derived from neuropsychological research regarding the cross-cultural perception of mental imagery expe- rienced in states of altered consciousness and the anthropology of shamanism (Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1988). It argues that Great Basin rock art predominantly represents shamanic metaphors and experiences and that sites functioned as vision-quest locales where supernatural powers and visions could be obtained (Whitley 1994:7, 13-16). Vigorous debate exists regarding the degree of ethnographic support for these two approaches, both worldwide and specific to the Great Basin (e.g., Bahn 1991; Hedges 2001; Lewis-Williams 1998; Mon- teleone 1998; Quinlan 2000a; Rector 1985; Solomon 1997, 1998, 1999; Whitley 1994, 2000a, 2000b; Woody 2000a). It is beyond the scope of this paper to rehearse these arguments. It is sufficient to note the available ethnographies and ethnohistories will, and should, continue to provide an important source of inspiration for a wide range of divergent theories regarding rock art functions and symbolism-the presence or absence of specific ethnographic support need not necessarily imply that a particular theory is not worthy of consideration. Ethnography provides precedents for sources for hypotheses (Lewis- Williams 1991:151) since contemporary informa- tion is unlikely to represent the full range of rock art's past cultural contexts. This is unsurprising given that outside Australia much ethnographic information regarding the cultural context of rock art exists as oblique and metaphoric references in ethnohistori- cal sources, frequently collected as exercises in "memory ethnography" e.g., in southern Africa col- lections of San mythology (Bleek and Lloyd 1911) and, in western North America, the Culture Element Survey program (Kroeber 1935; Voeglin 1954). Rock Art and Settlement In contrast to hunting magic and shamanistic approaches, we wish to focus on the broader socio- logical functions of rock art, particularly those sites located in association with settlement or the margins of the settled landscape. Hunting magic and shaman- ism, as currently applied, seem ill-equipped to deal with domestic rock art sites, an association that we argue below is widespread but underappreciated in the Great Basin. The landscape context of rock art is important in determining with whom the art was intended to communicate and interact (and thus the kind of relationships it potentially negotiated) (Bradley 2000:69). Hunting magic argues that because rock art is largely associated with hunting locales only hunters used and viewed it (Heizer and Baumhoff 1962). Shamanism suggests that rock art functioned as vision-quest locales divorced from set- tlement activities and used exclusively by shamans (Whitley 1998a:22). Even where rock art and set- tlement co-occur it is argued that the rock art was made by shamans when settlements were not in use by others, i.e., outside the normal seasonal round (1998b:3). Thus for both approaches, rock art's land- scape context, and/or its relationship to the cycle of residential mobility, restricted the art's users to cer- tain segments of society. However, we suggest that these reconstructions of rock art's potential audiences may be too restric- tive since the domestic context of much rock art opens the possibility that it was encountered by a broad cross-section of society in the course of their daily routines. In much of the Great Basin, rock art and settlement archaeology seem closely associated but under-reported in site records (Ricks 1996:20; Ricks and Cannon 1993:8; Woody 2000a). For exam- ple, in Nevada, of the 1,037 currently recorded rock art sites, lithics are reported at 188 sites and ground stone from 114 (Figure 2). In addition, 22 site records note other types of habitation debris, such as mid- dens and rockrings (Woody 2000a: 138-143). When one considers that only 244 site records report the presence or absence of associated cultural remains, these figures suggest a close relationship between residence, activity area, and rock art for a number of sites. Studies exploring the relationship between rock art and settlement in this region are generally rare but the few carried out to date tend to support the idea that the two are related. Rock art of the Warner Valley region, Oregon, often co-occurs with settle- ment debris and foraging areas (Ricks 1996:102) so that "it appears likely that rock art was integrated into the daily life of the prehistoric residents of Warner 374</page><page sequence="4">REPORTS Figure 2. Rock art in direct association with ground stone, High Basins, Nevada. Valley" (Ricks and Cannon 1993:98). From south- ern Nevada a survey of 106 rock art sites argued that "site distributions tend to confirm the proposition that rock art marked trails and camps" (Green 1987:161). Middens, grinding slicks, lithics, and other domes- tic debris found at some 40 percent of the sites stud- ied by Green provided evidence that these sites functioned as seasonal residences (1987:184). The remaining sites are found in the margins of the set- tled landscape and perhaps functioned as staging camps or marked trails (1987:185). Even the Coso Range rock art complex is closely associated with milling slicks, ground stone, open-air habitation sites, and hunting features such as hunting blinds (Gilreath 1997, 1999). This domestic association opens the possibility that rock art's intended audience and use was not restricted to hunters or vision questers; potentially a large section of the cultural group viewed and inter- acted with it regularly. It is this relationship between habitation and rock art that suggests the rituals asso- ciated with it were embedded in the social repro- duction of its makers and users since the "meanings" of space are inscribed by the actions recurrently per- formed there (Ricoeur 1981:204-206). This raises the prospect that the interpretations and actions impli- cated in the use of rock art referenced the domestic activities done nearby or in direct association (Quin- lan and Woody 2001:215) and vice versa. Rather than negotiating exclusively ecological or supernat- ural relationships, in the manner suggested by hunt- ing magic and shamanism, it becomes plausible that social relationships were also negotiated (at least at those rock art sites in or near the margins of settle- ment). It is for these reasons that we believe that an approach different from those of hunting magic and shamanism is necessary to understand those rock art locales situated in the settled landscape. In much of the following discussion we assume that rock art and settlement activity were used con- temporaneously. We recognize that without direct dating of rock art, combined with securely dated associated cultural materials, questions of contem- poraneity will remain speculative. Yet it seems more economical to assume that ifrock art and settlement activity belong to the same period, then both were used simultaneously, rather than at different times (e.g., by shamans returning out of season to use the settlement as a vision-quest locale). Our assumption would be invalidated by the discovery that rock art 375</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY usually postdates the use of residence and activity areas, though this seems rather unlikely. In contrast, even if rock art predates settlement activity it could still have been incorporated in the ritual practices of subsequent groups whatever their cultural relation- ship to the art's original makers. Monuments of the past are often reused and given novel cultural mean- ings and social roles despite discontinuities in use (Bradley 1993:113, 1998:17). Thus the discourses articulated by and through rock art become increas- ingly distanced from the intentions of its original makers and users. Of course, the fact that past mon- uments are often reused does not mean that they invariably are. However, rock art remains a highly visible monument form and its location in areas vis- ited in pursuit of economic activities suggests it would not have been difficult to find and may have provoked some sort of cultural response from sub- sequent cultural groups. (We assume that prehistoric Great Basin populations were more observant than the mountain shepherds of Mont Bego in the French Alps who were in the habit of carving their names with metal chisels into prehistoric engravings. When asked if they could carve their names elsewhere, the shepherds reported that they had not seen or recog- nized the ancient art and were unaware of engraving their names into anything other than the natural rock surface [Chippindale 1998]). Since settlements, not surprisingly, were located to best take advantage of the Basin's desertic envi- ronment, it is significant that rock art seems fre- quently congruent with residential behavior. One unintended consequence of this simple ecological fact is that rock art was presumably encountered in daily routines by most in society, making it more likely that it was incorporated in some way in com- munity-wide rituals. Consequently we believe that rock art not visited in the course of daily routines, such as sites remote from settlements or activity areas, perhaps difficult to reach, probably did not play the broader ritual functions that we envisage for sites with domestic associations. Instead, they are much more in keeping with what is known of vision-quest locales that ideally are secluded from mundane activ- ities and perhaps require some special effort to reach (e.g., Eliade 1964:58-59, 100-101; Jakobsen 1999:52-53; Park 1938:118). Although the land- scape context of Great Basin rock art seems to have connected much of it with the routines of daily life, this does not imply that knowledge of its symbolic meanings was necessarily widely shared. Access to knowledge can be restricted by the kind of imagery used as the vehicle of communication (Bradley 2000:73) as we discuss in more detail below. Rock Art and Social Reproduction Despite its interpretative difficulty, rock art is poten- tially a sensitive indicator of ethnic affiliation (Lee and Hyder 1990) since identities are typically repro- duced through the medium of ritual. Subtle variations in ritual practice are often cited as signs of radically different cultural practices and are important in con- structing group identities (Barth 1987:3-6). If rock art is tied to ritual institutions then we would expect its characteristics to vary accordingly. For example, rock art in southern California in the territory of the Luisefio and the Diegueiio shares characteristics in content and style because of shared ritual com- plexes-Toloache initiations and girls' puberty rites (Strong 1929:118). Likewise, Ritter (1995) argues that regional differences in Central Baja California rock art are the result of variations in internal social processes related to the management of social dys- function concomitant with population growth and aggregation. The relationship between rock art and cultural boundaries is complex. Morwood (1992) notes that rock art boundaries reflect both geogra- phy and the nature of group relations. Thus "the dis- tinctive Wandjina style of the Western Kimberleys coincided with the extent of the wunan exchange sys- tem between linguistically related and culturally sim- ilar groups" while abrupt changes in rock art reflected boundaries between hostile interaction spheres (1992:4). Ritual can play a critical role in the social repro- duction of societies lacking objectified institutions for sustaining relations of domination. Social inequality can only be maintained in a disguised form, under the veil of an enchanted relationship, to prevent violent dissent from its victims (Bourdieu 1977:192). In such social contexts ritual often functions to mediate con- flicts concerning the distribution of power and disputes over the structuring principles of social systems (Gluckman 1963:110-137), deriving its emotional and social force from its perceived connection with supernatural entities and processes that guarantee its authority and veracity (Boyer 1990:88). Ritual and its symbolism often function as a kind of light source- not to be looked at but to illuminate (Sperber 1975:70), suggesting that symbolism is "about" internal evoca- 376</page><page sequence="6">REPORTS tion and its use to throw light on the social world besides a particular ceremony's ostensive references (Strecker 1988:30). The close relationship between rit- ual and the constitution of social praxis is further sug- gested by social structure (in Radcliffe-Brown's [1952] sense) being manifested largely in ritual con- texts (Bloch 1977:286). Certain rituals provide "the rare occasions when it is possible actually to hear peo- ple giving lists of rights and duties, and even quite lit- erally to see roles being put on individuals" (Bloch 1977:286). We therefore suggest that rock art potentially pro- vides a powerful symbolic resource that can be incor- porated into ritual performance and sustain competing ritual discourses. Symbolism often becomes the object of a special knowledge, and con- trol of that knowledge a potential source of power. The form that rock art imagery takes is one means by which access to its meanings may be controlled. Iconic imagery is potentially complex in its symbolic references and as difficult to understand as abstract imagery. A picture of an animal, for example, may not refer to the animal depicted or contain additional symbolic references (Bradley 2000:70; Davidson 1994:235). Nevertheless, at one level it can still can be apprehended because of its resemblance to the ani- mal apparently depicted. Further, the frequency and distribution of animal motifs within and between sites may suggest a totemic function (Layton 2000:179-181). In contrast, abstract imagery would require commentary to identify its referential sub- ject(s). The opaqueness of Great Basin rock art (its imagery being predominantly abstract and formally difficult to classify [Woody 2000a:157]) suggests that exegesis would have had to accompany its pro- duction and use to clarify its references. Its inter- pretive difficulties would have served to demonstrate rock art's connection with the supernatural, and by implication those individuals authorized to interpret it (Bourdieu 1991:109, 111). Thus, as we noted above, although the landscape context of much Great Basin rock art would have been insufficient to restrict access to a special interest group (though whether social injunctions to that effect may have existed is not something archaeology can tell [Bradley 2000:69]), access to its meanings may have been restricted by using predominantly abstract imagery. As Bradley notes regarding European rock art, "con- trol over the meanings of the rock art may have been an important source of power" (2000:73). Indeed, it has been noted that change in hunter-gatherer mark- ing behavior is often associated with increased social stratification (see Tacon 1994:126). This suggests a potential association between rock art and ritual designed to negotiate social relation- ships that may help to characterize differing modes of social legitimation, and thus, indirectly, cultural identities in the past. We suggest that the apparent absence of a tradition of making rock art among his- toric Great Basin peoples (see below) is an outcome of their consensual social organizations rather than a lacuna in the ethnographic record. However, we do not wish to suggest that all rock art served to man- age social tensions. Historic depictions of horses and riders, for example, are probably records of unusual or dangerous phenomena observed and recorded by Native Americans, suggesting that the experience of colonialism may have revived a tradition of secular rock art (Quinlan and Woody 2000). Rock art found far from areas of settlement and in places not visited in connection with economic routines probably served different functions, perhaps as locales where powers could be acquired (Whitley 1994:7, 1998a:17). Our discussion most directly applies to rock art found near settlement or in the margins of the settled landscape and is predominantly abstract in imagery. A location near habitation areas implies that rock art could have been interacted with as an outcome of the routines of daily life. An emphasis on abstract imagery allows for the possibility of a hierarchy of meanings and interpretations, controlled by a minority and thus a potentially important source of power. Numic Accounts of Rock Art Historic Great Basin ethnographies generally do not directly clarify the cultural context of rock art (Stew- ard 1929:224, 1937:412-413). The existing ethnog- raphy suggests that Great Basin groups regarded rock art as of great antiquity or as a marker of supernat- ural powers, since they usually attributed it to enti- ties that did not function as shamanic spirit-helpers. Among the Northern and Eastern Shoshone some rock art seems to have marked places of supernat- ural power where shamans conducted vision quests (Hultkrantz 1987:52-54; Lowie 1909:223). Shamans are not directly reported as making rock art: perhaps they exploited monuments from the past as sources of supernatural powers. Elsewhere consultants some- times ridiculed the notion that people had made rock 377</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 3. Historic imagery depicting a rider on horse, Stuart Ranch, Nevada. art (Irwin 1980:32; Zigmond 1977:71), attributing it instead to supernatural entities believed to be still pro- ducing it. Consultants sometimes reported changes in imagery at rock art sites (Hultkrantz 1987:49; Zig- mond 1977:71). Consequently attributions of super- natural causation can be argued to represent "logical explanations necessitated by the perceived observa- tion of change" (Quinlan 2000b: 18). Some rock art was attributed to mythological figures. For example, since Coyote was said to have made rock art as a "trick" (Stewart 1941:418), Honey Lake Paiute (Northern Paiute) descriptions of petroglyphs as tumadi ("magic" or "tricks") (Riddell 1978:84) metaphorically place rock art in mythic time (Quin- lan 2000a:99). Interestingly, some Northern Paiute consultants identified poorly made or broken pro- jectile points recovered from archaeological con- texts as "Coyote Points," i.e., made or broken by Coyote. Chronologically older projectile points were attributed to the Time When Animals Were People (Fowler 1992:106, Figure 50; Kelly 1932:137). Excepting depictions of horses, cowboys, and wagons (Figure 3), no rock art in the Great Basin can clearly be assigned to historic Great Basin popula- tions (though it should be remembered that most pet- roglyphs cannot currently be dated directly and rel- ative dating is unreliable). While historic rock art is interesting, it seems sporadic and idiosyncratic in its distribution. This suggests that it was probably not part of a larger cultural institution because, unlike other ritual practices, the memory of its production and meaning had been lost by the time that the ear- liest ethnographies were written. A handful of con- sultants in the Great Basin did say that rock art was made "just for fun" (Stewart 1942:321), and they may have been referring to historic representations of horses and cowboys, etc. Currently only rock art depicting this kind of imagery can be unambigu- ously dated to the contact and postcontact period. Whether or not other styles of rock art with prehis- toric precursors continued to be made into the recent past is not something that archaeology can determine at present. The salvage ethnography conducted dur- ing the first part of the twentieth century contains few direct references to rock art being made and nothing about the actual style and imagery depicted. Numic Social Organization We suggest that the general absence of direct infor- mation regarding the production or use of rock art 378</page><page sequence="8">REPORTS in early ethnographies is an outcome of the charac- ter of Great Basin social organizations, rather than assuming that knowledge of it was forgotten or with- held from ethnographers.2 Historically observed Great Basin sociopolitical groups were character- ized by a lack of conflict concerning social organi- zation (Crum 1994:2,8; Steward 1938). The position of chief or headman, where present, was strictly cir- cumscribed concerning the extent of its authority and was largely restricted to economic matters, e.g., as among the Western Shoshone (Steward 1938:247), Northern Paiute (Fowler and Liljeblad 1986: 450-451), Southern Paiute (Kelly and Fowler 1986:380), Washoe (d'Azevedo 1986:469), Kawai- isu (Zigmond 1986:405), and Owens Valley Paiute (Steward 1933:304). The institution of chieftainship was more strongly developed among those Great Basin groups who led a lifeway based on raiding and/or buffalo hunting, made possible by the horse. However, leadership was usually restricted to the organization of buffalo hunts and military defense against aggressive neighbors, such as among the Eastern Shoshone (Shimkin 1986:310). One limiting factor of chiefly authority was the freedom of band members to switch allegiance to other bands or family clusters. Among the Western Shoshone, Washoe, Southern Paiute, Northern Paiute, and Kawaiisu the basic social units were the nuclear family and family clusters. Larger kinship groupings were largely absent and larger residential aggregates (villages) were temporary and seasonal. Membership of villages and family clusters was fluid and changes in affiliation a regular occurrence (Stew- ard 1938:246-248). Even among the more rigid band organization of the Northern Shoshone, Bannock, Eastern Shoshone, and Ute, families still split off into other bands (Callaway et al. 1986:354; Shimkin 1986:310; Steward 1943:279). Thus those discon- tented with the leadership of their band always had the option of moving away and attaching themselves to another. This fluidity in band and village membership led to equally fluid conceptions of group identity and ter- ritory. Excepting the Owens Valley Paiute and North- ern Paiute living in the Reese River area (Steward 1933:304, 1938:104-105), relatively stable villages exploiting a well-defined territory were absent in the Great Basin. Exclusive rights of access and exploita- tion of the resources of a territory were not claimed, although outsiders were expected to "check in" with regular inhabitants (Fowler 1982:120, 127). Only the Owens Valley Paiute practiced band ownership of hunting and seed territories, largely because of the sedentary and relatively permanent nature of their vil- lages (Steward 1938: 253-256). Although this con- struction has been questioned (e.g., Service 1962; Stewart 1939, 1980) for underestimating the exis- tence of historic band organizations and the effects of colonialism, it is not questioned that historic Great Basin societies were characterized by relatively peaceful resolution of social disputes. Whether or not this contact-period picture of social organization reflects the precolonial situation is difficult to know. One suspects that it does given the limited scope and temporary nature of postcontact chiefly institutions. The Great Basin is distinguished from neighbor- ing areas by its comparative lack of public ritual (Fowler and Fowler 1971:8) since there was no great functional need for socially integrative ritual (Stew- ard 1955:114). Large-scale group rituals were largely absent, with the important exception of seasonal dances held when food supplies permitted. These provided occasions for socializing (dancing and gam- bling) and the acquisition of spouses, as well as play- ing certain religious functions (Steward 1938:45-46, 1941:265). They were not held primarily or exclu- sively to resolve social disputes. Instead, one of the aims of these seasonal ceremonies was to increase food supplies and offer prayers to the supreme being (Hultkrantz 1986:634). Even the Sun Dance of the Eastern Shoshone (who were the only Great Basin group to adopt it before the reservation period) orig- inally focused on insuring success in buffalo hunts and warfare. From the 1880s the Sun Dance was modified, switching its emphasis to the healing of illness and the maintenance of community cohesion, in response to the new conditions of reservation life (Shimkin 1953:436-437). The character of historically observed Great Basin social organizations and ritual suggest that the pre- dominant contexts of social reproduction were the routines of daily social life. Consultant information on rock art is consistent with this picture. Assuming that rock art production and use "affords" a context for protected social communication to take place, the character of historic Great Basin social organiza- tions implies this was a context that was apparently not needed. Although the nature of the relationship between historic settlement and rock art requires fur- ther research to clarify, evidence of a disassociation 379</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY between the two would tend to support our approach. Even when rock art was found near settlements and could not be avoided, e.g., the "Doctor Rock" sites (Fowler 1992:40, 178; Price 1998; Wheat 1967; Woody 2000a:248-255), it seems not to have been incorporated into community-wide ritual. The Schurz "Doctor Rocks" seem typical in that they were believed to have strong curative powers and bestowed good luck on travelers (Wheat 1967:20, 115). Currently only four "Doctor Rock" sites are known though more may have existed in the past (Woody 2000a:248). In the remainder of this paper we discuss the implications for understanding the Numic dispersal of recognizing that rock art may have belonged to different traditions of social legitimation than those attested historically. The Numic Dispersal Most Great Basin languages belong to the most northerly branch of the Uto-Aztecan language fam- ily, i.e., Numic. The principal exception is Washoe, situated in the western edge of the Basin and cen- tered on the Lake Tahoe area. This is classified as a member of the Hokan stock (which contains 13 branches in California and the Southwest), though this classification is controversial (Jacobsen 1986:107). Numic is subdivided into three distinc- tive dialect groups each containing two separate but related languages: Western Numic containing Mono and Paviotso; Central Numic containing Koso and Shoshone-Commanche; Southern Numic contain- ing Kawaiisu andUte (Kroeber 1907; Lamb 1958:96, 98; Miller 1986:96-100). The dispersal of this lan- guage family into the Great Basin and beyond into the Plateau and fringes of the Plains has aroused debate concerning its timing and the identification of the Numic "homeland" (usually identified as the Death Valley area or the western Basin) (see contri- butions in Madsen and Rhode [1994] for a current summary). Resolution of this debate has been ham- pered by the difficulty in identifying the material sig- natures of distinct sociocultural groups from the archaeological record. As Julian Steward (1940:478) appreciated, our ability to identify distinct sociocul- tural systems will be severely hampered if we do not incorporate into our debates the most visible mark made by prehistoric Great Basin populations-their rock art. To date only Bettinger and Baumhoff (1982) have followed Steward in according rock art an important role in identifying the Numic spread. Since, as we argue above, the production and use of rock art generally seems not to be associated with historic Great Basin groups, its presence is impor- tant evidence of preceding populations with social organizations requiring some degree of formal pub- lic ritual to facilitate their reproduction. The lin- guistic and cultural affiliation of these groups cannot be directly addressed solely from the residues of their ritual practices. However, it does imply some significant changes in ritual practice. The Numic Dispersal- Its Archaeological Signature During the 1920s and 1930s archaeological research in Utah and the southwest Basin identified radical transformations in material culture occurring around 1000 B.P. At that time populations based on agri- culture or horticulture were ostensibly replaced by Numic hunter-gatherers (Harrington et al. 1930:23; Steward 1940:454). In the 1950s linguistic corre- lates of this shift in archaeological materials were defined by Sidney Lamb's (1958) influential model of the dispersal of the Numic language family. Lamb proposed that the Numic spread from a homeland in the vicinity of Death Valley, beginning around 1000 B.P. While the ability of glottochronology to provide accurate dates for linguistic dispersal is now less widely accepted (Grayson 1993:259-261,1994:21), Lamb's analysis, and subsequent linguistic research by Fowler (1972), do support archaeological evi- dence that the Numic expansion into the eastern and southwestern Great Basin occurred relatively recently (i.e., in the last 1,000-1,500 years). Disjunctures in the archaeological record sug- gesting a population replacement are easier to rec- ognize in the eastern and southwestern parts of the Great Basin where ca. A.D. 1000-1300 semi-agri- cultural modes of production, the Fremont in the east and the Anasazi in the Southwest, were replaced by hunter-gatherer economies. In the western Basin such population replacements are harder to identify either at this time or at any other time in prehistory since this area was continuously exploited by hunter- gatherer economies since at least the beginning of the early Holocene. This is not to imply that the hunter-gatherer populations of this area were cul- turally homogenous, because similarities in the archaeological residues of hunter-gatherers usually mask considerable cultural variability and diversity. 380</page><page sequence="10">REPORTS Subsequent research on Fremont populations has strengthened the idea that they are not related to his- torically known Numic populations and that the Numic expansion eastward and southwestward into the Plateau and the fringes of the Plains occurred in the early part of the second millennium A.D. Both Fremont and Anasazi economic systems are recog- nized as developing from local hunter-gatherer economies ca. A.D. 400 (Marwitt 1986:163). The archaeology of the Fremont illustrates striking dis- continuities from that of the late prehistoric hunter- gatherers who subsequently occupied the same area. Fremont architecture, basketry, leather moccasins, and burials are distinctive from those of the Numic groups who historically occupied the eastern Great Basin (Janetski 1994:162, 171, 173). Fremont sub- sistence patterns show considerable variability in their emphasis on hunting and the harvesting of wild resources, but always included the production of corn. This contrasts strongly with late prehistoric subsistence systems that were totally reliant on wild resources (Janetski 1994:162). Consequently, it is widely accepted that "the Fremont people, whoever they were, were not the same as the Numic speak- ers who succeeded them" (Aikens and Witherspoon 1986:14; emphasis in original). In the southwest Basin, the archaeology of the Anasazi is character- ized by an economic reliance on horticulture and small sedentary or semi-sedentary villages with pit houses and masonry (Fowler and Madsen 1986:174). Striking discontinuities, again in material culture, mark the transition between Anasazi and Southern Paiute occupation of this area (Fowler 1994:108; Madsen 1994:29-30). It is likely that the Virgin and Kayenta Anasazi groups were related to the historic Hopi "who represent a monolanguage family of Utaztekan coordinate with Numic" (Aikens and Witherspoon 1986:14). Identifying the Numic expansion into the west- ern Great Basin has proved extremely contentious since in this area hunter-gatherers replaced hunter- gatherers. Indications of a late Numic spread into the western Basin can be found in some Numic oral tra- ditions, though other oral histories insist that Numic groups have occupied the Great Basin from the beginning of time. One Northern Paiute oral history relates that the early Paiute drove off a preceding group in western Nevada (Dansie 1975:155-160; Hopkins 1883:73-75). A Southern Paiute oral tradi- tion also recognizes an earlier occupation by the "Mukwic" who are thought to be responsible for pic- tographs in the area (Kelly 1964:31). In a review of Numic oral histories, Sutton (1993:124) concluded that oral traditions provided "a plausible line of evi- dence that Numic populations did move north and east from the southwestern Great Basin .... Such population movements would likely have taken place fairly late in time for these indications still to be pre- sent in the oral tradition." Despite these oral traditions it has been possible to argue that the Numic occupation of the western Great Basin has considerable antiquity with a late expansion eastward (Grayson 1994:23). Aikens and Witherspoon (1986) have argued that the Numic occupied the Desert West since the breakup of the Uto-Aztecan language family some 5,000 years ago. The mobile lifeway of the Numic hunter-gatherers was suited to the dry conditions of the central Great Basin, but not the moister conditions that obtained in parts of Utah and the Southwest. With the dry cli- mactic interval of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries A.D., sedentary, semi-agricultural populations could no longer be supported in the eastern and south- western Basin, leading to the Fremont and Anasazi retreat. The void they left was filled by a late pre- historic Numic expansion. This is conceived as "only the last in a series of expansions and contractions that began as people first entered the Great Basin in sig- nificant numbers 5000 years ago" (Aikens and With- erspoon 1986:15). This reconstruction assumes that variations in forager economy reflect adaptations to changing conditions, rather than varying economic strategies pursued by culturally distinct hunter-gath- erer populations. In contrast, Bettinger and Baumhoff (1982), draw- ing on optimal foraging theory, regarded variations in hunter-gatherer foraging strategies as reflective of different cultural groups. Traveler and processor strategies are characterized by their divergent reliance on high- and low-quality resources, and level of residential mobility. Travelers are reliant on high- quality resources of restricted availability, whose exploitation is based on the necessity of greater mobility to procure them. This strategy results in reduced food processing costs. In contrast, proces- sors are characterized by their reliance on low-qual- ity resources of greater availability. Since these are low-quality resources, greater time is required in their processing. However, their greater availability reduces traveling costs (Bettinger and Baumhoff 381</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 4. Revarnished rock art-Grimes Point, Nevada. 1982:486-487). Considering the evidence of pro- jectile points, rock art, and seed-processing tech- nology, Bettinger and Baumhoff (1982) argue that pre-Numic and Numic foraging strategies are con- trasted, with the former approximating to travelers and the latter processors. Neither of these stimulating models really addresses the issue of the cultural identity of Great Basin prehistoric hunter-gatherers. It is always pos- sible to argue that variations in adaptive strategies reflect cultural differences (as Bettinger and Baumhoff suggest) or relate to responses to chang- ing environmental conditions (as Aikens and With- erspoon suggest). We believe that rock art can permit the cultural relationship between the Numic and pre- historic Great Basin groups to be addressed. Rock Art and the Numic Dispersal The earliest rock art throughout the Great Basin is abstract (Schaafsma 1980:77), characterized by a predominance of geometric motifs and other abstract elements. This is exemplified by the Long Lake rock art site in southern Oregon (Cannon and Ricks 1986; Ricks 1996; Ricks and Cannon 1993), which is char- acterized by very deeply engraved complex abstract designs. This site can be confidently dated to before 6800 B.P. because limited excavations at the base of one panel revealed a primary deposition of Mazama ash that lies above the bottom of the rock art panel (Cannon and Ricks 1993:96). The rock art, includ- ing the oldest, is directly associated with milling stones, house rings, and other settlement debris (Ricks and Cannon 1998). Likewise, at Grimes Point (northern Nevada) much of the art is completely revarnished and is predominantly abstract in form (Figure 4). We suggest that one motivation for the earliest rock art made by the first hunter-gatherer populations of the Great Basin and their immediate ancestors was to socialize the new landscape they encountered, or to secure access to resources by appealing to what- ever others or supernatural entities were perceived as present in the new territory (Woody 2000a: 225-226, 2000b). The descendants of these initial colonizing groups may have intensified the ritual complex associated with the production and use of rock art during the ecological transition leading up to the Middle Holocene when access to resources may have become more contested (Leach 1988:105). This may have increased the need for ritual that func- tioned to legitimate social relations and access to the land. Preference for abstract imagery may imply a 382</page><page sequence="12">REPORTS Figure 5. Basin and Range Tradition style-Massacre Lake, Nevada. concern with internal social communication rather than between different cultural groups. Abstract imagery requires greater interpretation and instruc- tion compared with naturalistic designs, making it unlikely that a stranger would have comprehended all its meanings (Bradley 2000:70-71). The geometric and other abstract motifs that com- prise the bulk of Great Basin rock art are now referred to as the Basin and Range Tradition (Figure 5). The temporal dimensions of this "style" are difficult to determine, partly because of the absence of direct dat- ing and partly because its abstract character is extremely challenging for relative dating based on superimpositioning. Basin and Range Tradition motifs show such considerable variation in form that only very basic motifs, such as circles, squares, and vulviforms, can be readily re-identified. The motifs employed constitute the basic vocabulary of visual expression, explaining their presence at every Great Basin rock art site. What is significant is the general emphasis on abstract modes of expression compared with naturalistic art. Although figurative motifs occur throughout the Great Basin, and presumably are similar in date to Basin and Range Tradition motifs, the emergence of rock art characterized by the representation of many anthropomorphs and zoomorphs (most commonly bighorn sheep) (with the notable exception of the Coso range) may be associated with the development of subsistence systems with a variable reliance on horticulture and harvesting of wild resources in Utah and the southwestern Great Basin. Broad-shouldered anthropomorphs, depicted with horns or other elab- orate headgear, is a characteristic motif in Fremont rock art (Schaafsma 1980:166) and are very similar in style to unfired ceramic figurines that are a dis- tinctive part of its material culture (Janetski 1994:164). These Fremont anthropomorphs share formal characteristics with Western Kayenta style anthropomorphs associated with the Anasazi (Schaafsma 1980:109-110). Fremont and Anasazi anthropomorphs are stylistically quite distinct from those found elsewhere (Figure 6). Bighorn sheep are also represented in significant numbers in Fremont and Anasazi rock art and it seems that they share with figurative anthropomorphs a distribution apparently concentrated in the southwestern Great Basin and the Colorado drainage (Turner 1963), with the notable exception of the Cosos. The continuation of abstract elements in Fremont and Anasazi rock art, stylisti- 383</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY o o O0 o0 oO o o00 0 0 A % r a b c Figure 6. Three types of Great Basin anthropomorph: (a) Fremont (Katchina Cave, Nevada); (b) Western Kayenta (Lost City, Nevada) (redrawn from Schaafsma 1971:Plate 54); (c) Basin and Range Tradition (Lagomarsino, Nevada). cally similar to Basin and Range Tradition-domi- nated rock art that preceded it, could provide further evidence of the origins of these agriculturists in the earlier hunter-gatherer economies of their regions. However, it should be remembered that abstract art often comprises the basic vehicles of visual repre- sentation. The changing character of rock art in Utah and the southwest Basin may reflect changes in the social and ritual practices that accompanied the evo- lution of horticultural economies. Communities prac- ticing some form of farming often legitimate their access to land and other critical resources through rituals that establish a link to the past (often through the invocation of ancestor figures). Continued use of abstract imagery also suggests that rock art was per- haps still used to manage social tension or functioned as a potential source of social power. The most striking exception to this distribution pattern occurs in the Coso Range where rock art was exclusively produced by hunter-gatherer populations. This spectacular body of rock art is characterized by large numbers of bighorn sheep and a smaller num- ber of elaborate anthropomorphs (Figure 7; Grant et al. 1968), which exhibit stylistic similarities to Fre- mont and Anasazi rock art. These similarities may suggest stronger cultural relationships between groups in the Coso range and the southwest Basin along the Colorado River drainage, than with other Numic populations further into the heart of the Great Basin (Monteleone and Woody 1999). Although the rock art in the Cosos was seemingly produced over a very long period, the vast majority has been argued to have been made more recently (Whitley 1998c:58) in an apparent explosion of ritual activity. Revital- ization or millennial movements can result in this type of increased activity and occur in response to conditions that cause intense and sudden disruption of common social patterns. These types of move- ments are deliberate and organized attempts to con- struct a more satisfying culture based on a return to a mythic past (Wallace 1970:188-199). Social anx- iety may have been treated through rock art produc- tion (probably in association with other traditional ritual forms) and the areas of similar iconography along the Colorado River may indicate the areal extent of such a movement (Monteleone and Woody 1999). Very early rock art at the Cosos and else- where, perhaps the work of colonizing groups (Woody 1996, 2000a:225, 2000b), may have served as a tangible index of the past-an important feature of revitalization movements. Traditional ritual forms are invigorated through the introduction of new imagery and practices. Coso rock art may represent the material residues of these new ritual forms (Mon- teleone and Woody 1999). Alternatively, resource abundance in the Cosos may have favored the devel- opment of semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer commu- nities and incipient hierarchy-an emerging big-man complex (Bettinger 1995). Fremont and Anasazi rock art styles seem to have been produced contemporaneously with Basin and Range Tradition styles in central and western areas that maintained a hunter-gatherer economy. The rela- tionship between abstract and figurative modes of representation in Utah and the Southwest implies that the Fremont and the Anasazi were related to contemporaneous hunter-gatherer groups elsewhere in the Great Basin. These descendants of the initial 384</page><page sequence="14">REPORTS Figure 7. Coso patterned-body anthropomorphs-Little Petroglyph Canyon, Coso Range, California. colonizers of the Great Basin were, like the Fremont and Anasazi, replaced by the ancestors of modern Great Basin peoples. The ancestors of modern Great Basin peoples may have modified existing rock art to socialize the landscape. Scratched rock art3 has been identified by Bettinger and Baumhoff (1982:494) with incoming Numic populations, and its production argued to have been intended to "obliterate" the art of those who preceded them. Monuments often provoke cul- tural responses from colonizer groups or when knowledge of its production and original use has been lost (Bradley 1998:17). However, scratched art is not always directly superimposed over other rock art, and where it is it sometimes seems to enhance or embellish rather than deface (Woody 1996:60). In other cases scratched motifs are executed with great care near other rock art and often occurs in isolation from other types of rock art (d'Angelo et al. 1997). In contrast, in California scratched rock art pre- dominantly takes the form of defacement (Robert L. Bettinger, personal communication 1999). If scratched art does represent incoming Numic popu- lations socializing the landscape through reuse of the monuments of preceding populations, it seems that subsequently rock art was generally avoided. This could explain why rock art production became spo- radic and memory of it lost. It should be noted that late scratched engravings also occur in other parts of the world and their relationship to older rock art is equally hard to discern, e.g., as at Mont Bego in the French Alps (Giusto-Magnardi 1990).4 Conclusions Rock art interpretation is unavoidably speculative and contingent, and the interpretation we outline is no exception. However, our approach has the merit of attempting to account for an important, but often underappreciated, aspect of site context, i.e., the domestic associations of Great Basin rock art sites. Research clarifying rock art's landscape context pro- vides one means of assessing the strength of the inter- pretation proposed here. It is important for rock art research to remember that rock art is not an inevitable expression of hunter-gatherer theories of being and consequently theory also needs to account for the kinds of social contexts that do not use rock art. One such context is the Great Basin, where the very 385</page><page sequence="15">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY character of its rock art suggests that it was made by groups very different in terms of sociopolitical orga- nization and religious ideology from those of historic populations. We have argued that the apparent lacuna in ethnography regarding the region's rock art can be explained as a meaningful cultural pattern. The earliest hunter-gatherers of the Great Basin may have made rock art to socialize the new envi- ronment that they encountered. This would have functioned to legitimate their exploitation of the Great Basin's resources by enlisting the aid of the supernatural forces present. The close relationship with domestic routines implies that rock art may also have played an important role in social reproduction. In Utah and the Southwest, major changes in ritual forms accompanied the social transformations asso- ciated with the development of economies based on horticulture and the harvesting of wild resources. The dramatic changes in the style and content of rock art of these areas are accompanied by a con- tinuation of abstract elements stylistically identical to preceding traditions of abstract rock art in these areas. This could illustrate that the horticultural groups of these areas were in situ developments. However, the references of the rock art apparently changed to a focus on ancestors, illustrated by the predominance of anthropomorphs. Ethnographies of the Great Basin generally imply that rock art was not produced by the Numic populations encountered at the time of White contact, although their ancestors may have made scratched art in response to earlier rock art.5 They are also critical in understanding the social differences represented by the rock art created by prior populations. Historic Numic social systems seem to have required little formal, community-wide ritual to ensure their reproduction, making their apparent lack of a tradition of ritually motivated rock art understandable.

By "ethnography" we mean information collected in the context of participant observation. Excluding Australia, the direct observation of the use of rock art is relatively rare. Ethnohistorical sources do exist, most prominently in South Africa and Western North America, collected as an exercise in salvage ethnography through interviewing of consultants about their memories of aboriginal culture before colonization. The memory cultures thus reconstructed provide important evidence about indigenous attitudes and uses of rock art. However, they are capable of supporting a number of competing interpreta- tions. 2. For discussion of the possibility that information regard- ing Great Basin rock art was expressed to ethnographers crypti- cally, see Whitley (1994, 1998d, 2000a, 2000b) and the counterarguments of Monteleone (1998), Quinlan (2000a) and Woody (2000a:75-77). 3. Establishing relative chronologies based exclusively on visual levels of revarnishing is problematic for all petroglyphs but especially so for scratched rock art. While much of the scratched rock art in the Great Basin appears more recent than other petroglyphs, determining its true age is difficult. Rock var- nish may not be broken when making scratched art and the process of revarnishing may be more rapid than engravings where the lines are deeper and broader (Alan Watchman, per- sonal communication 1998), potentially making scratched art appear older. However, older scratched art is more difficult to see or distinguish from natural striations in the rock, suggesting that its production may extend as far back as the Middle Archaic (Ritter 1994:60-61). 4. We thank Christopher Chippindale for drawing our atten- tion to this point. 5. It is important to note that we are not implying that Native Americans have no right to an attachment to rock art or to incor- porate it into contemporary practices regardless of their attach- ment to its original makers. Current means of determining cultural patrimony like NAGPRA are those of the dominant society that use scientific ideologies not necessarily recognized by indigenous peoples. While we would not argue that it is suf- ficient for indigenes to simply assert ownership of any cultural property, we do argue that Native Peoples have the right to a cul- tural or spiritual attachment to rock art without having that claim adjudicated by archaeologists.
