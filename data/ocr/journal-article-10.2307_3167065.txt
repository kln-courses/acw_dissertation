<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sacrifice as Education in Augustine and Chrysostom STEPHEN D. BENIN As eruditi et erudienti who had profited richly from pagan and Christian learning, Augustine and Chrysostom appreciated the power and influence of teachers and of pedagogical techniques.' Both viewed God as the teacher, and both were captivated by the divine method of instruction. They saw this method as one of divine accommodation; that is, the Lord adapted his lessons and plan to human capacities. Augustine's and Chrysostom's works are replete with references to, and discussions of, divine accommodation; it is a common aspect of their thought which fits neatly and prominently into a lengthy and vibrant exegetical tradition.2 Accommodation did not apply only to education but was part of a larger theme encompassing such diverse topics as biblical interpretation, including the use of allegorical as well as literal exegesis, and platonic theories of signs and symbols. Augustine and Chrysostom were not alone among the Fathers in using accommodation to explain biblical themes. In this article they are representative of the entire patristic tradition.3 I wish to thank my colleague Professor Caroline W. Bynum (University of Washington, Seattle) for her unstinting encouragement, critical comments, and valuable suggestions, and the Rev. Lawrence Frankovich (Kansas Newman College) for his sympathetic reading and helpful references. 1. I have adapted the phrase eruditi et erudienti from Augustine's description of Chrysostom in Contra Julianum 1.6.22 (Migne, PL 44.655, 661), where Augustine labels Chrysostom a distinguished witness to the faith, a defender of it, and places him among the most celebrated learned men and saints.

Lamb (New York, 1956); and idem, Saint Augustin et la fin de la culture antique and Retractatio, Bibliotheque des Ecoles Francaises d'Athenes et de Rome 145 (Paris, 1949).

Augustine knew Symmachus well and listened attentively to the sermons and the baptismal instructions of Ambrose. Chrysostom studied with Libanius, Andragathous, Diodoros of Tarsus, and Meletius. One should recall the story in Sozomon's Ecclesiastical History 8.2 where Libanius announces on his deathbed that Chrysostom should have been his successor had not the "Christians stolen him." 2. The use of accommodation in the works of either author has not yet been treated exhaustively. It is treated in Henry Pinard, "Les Infiltrations Paiennes dan l'Ancienne Loi," Recherches des Sciences Religieuse 9 (1919): 197-221.

Augustine, in his textbook for the uninstructed, Instructing the Unlearned, notes that a teacher's lessons ought to be directed to the level of the students.4 And in his essay On Christian Doctrine, he applies that method to gain historical insight.5 Chrysostom, in his "Address on Vainglory and the Right Way to Bring Up Children," cautions parents to teach their offspring gradually, lest they impose too great a burden on tender understanding.6 Besides being a valuable educational ploy, the heuristic principle of divine accommodation becomes an integral part of Augustine's and Chrysostom's thought and surfaces repeatedly in their writings. It helped them interpret scripture, it aided them in defending the faith and in confounding schismatics, and it enhanced their understanding of history and of the implementation of the divine plan within the historical process, especially in the age of Christ. In this article I intend to examine Augustine's and Chrysostom's attitudes toward sacrifice as an example of their understanding of divine accommoda- tion in order to highlight one common, albeit neglected, thread in the fabric of their thought and to show how accommodation permitted each to move from the exegesis of a parochial Jewish custom which was no longer observable to an understanding of history on the universal scale. Their use of this principle assured it a permanent role in subsequent Christian thought.7 Augustine's use of, and appreciation for, accommodation as a educational technique perhaps can be seen best in his On Christian Doctrine. He also uses it to upbraid and confound his Manichaean adversaries in his Against Faustus.8 And in a letter to Marcellinus as well as in the City of God, Augustine displays his understanding of accommodation as a historical tool.9 4.

The problem facing Augustine, and indeed the whole early church, was twofold: how to combat pagan attacks on Christianity and how to defend the faith against schismatics. Augustine used the idea of accommodation both to repel pagan attacks and to confound schismatics. For him, as for Chrysostom, the sacrifices of old provided a prime example of the divine coming down to the human level for didactic purposes; sacrifices provided an example of divine accommodation. On Christian Doctrine was primarily a manual not only on reading scripture, but more importantly on comprehending scripture. In it, Augustine discourses on the silver and gold which the Israelites carried with them out of Egypt (Exod. 12:35). He likens the silver and gold to true philosophical teachings and notes that those teachings which are well accommodated to Christianity should not be dismissed out of hand nor feared but rather taken from their unjust predecessors and converted to Christian use (in usum nostrum)." In addition to their gold and silver, the Egyptians lost clothing, which Augustine compares to those human institutions which are accommo- dated to human affairs.12 These also should be seized and converted to Christian use. Thus, according to Augustine, certain silver and gold threads were scattered throughout the pagan haystack. Indeed, one might even learn about the worship of one God from the words of the vast pagan corpus.13 And if pagan learning could contribute to Christianity, then Jewish practice, when carefully researched and intelligently understood, might yield even more. Augustine cautions his readers that whatever they learn from the books of the pagans, even if it is useful, is practically naught when compared to what may be derived from Holy Writ.14 In his Against Faustus, Augustine gives another reading of the importance 10. Chrysostom, Adversus Judaeas (Migne, PG 48. 843-892); hereafter cited as Adv. Jud. 11. "Philosophi autem qui vocantur, si qua forte vera et fidei nostrae accomodata dixerunt, maxime Platonici, non solum formidanda non sunt, sed ab eis etiam tamquam an iniustis possessoribus in usum nostrum vindicanda" (De doc. chr. 2.40, 60 [CSEL 80.75]). 12. Ibid. 13.

He had gone so far as to assert that there are in fact three laws: the law of the Hebrews, the law of the Gentiles, and the law of Truth.'6 Augustine rejects this trinitarian interpreta- tion of the law; he uses sacrifice to protect the ties between the testaments and to demolish effectively Faustus's claims. Faustus had claimed that the sacrifices of old were idolatrous and that Christians shared his view.'7 Augustine responds that although sacrifices are no longer offered by Christians, they did have value in times past and should not be considered idolatrous. They were figurae, and in numerous ways signified the one true sacrifice.18 Taunting Faustus, Augustine reveals the basis for Faustus's objections to sacrifice: Faustus is very kind to animals because he believes that they contain the souls of humans. So great is this mercy, quips Augustine, that it would spare animals yet refuse a piece of bread to a famished beggar!19 Augustine then turns to the theme of sacrifice. Just as Abel's sacrifice was preferred to Cain's, the faith of the New Law is dearer to the Lord than the observances of the Old Law.20 The Jews, comments Augustine, observe rites frozen in time, ceremonies preserved in the amber of history. They are the old Cain, not the new Adam. As Cain was a "marked man," so are the Jews "marked men."2' For Augustine, as for the whole of Christianity, Jewish existence after Christ remained a vexing problem. Augustine felt compelled to comment on continued Jewish existence. He observes that it was the Jews alone, of all the nations subjugated by Rome, who clung to the symbol of their law (signum legis suae).22 This historical oddity piqued his curiosity, and he wondered why the Jews had sacrifices. He concluded that these rites were instituted more because of their suitability to a perverse people than because of their appeal to the Lord.23 They were a 15.

If the sacrifices were suitable to the people but not appealing to God, then why were they mandated? One plausible explanation was divine accommodation-divine condescension-to a perverse people. If the Jews were permitted to offer sacrifices, then those sacrifices must have had some value in addition to being merely figurae. Christians, no less than Manichaeans and other schismatics, demanded a theological answer. Augustine, in discussing the use of symbols, had recourse to the patristic concept of similitudo, which held that some semblance must exist between a sign and that which is spoken of by the sign.24 He presents a particularly clear discussion of this concept in a letter to Boniface, an episcopal colleague who wished to know how parents could proclaim their child's belief in God at the baptismal font and yet at the same time could not say anything about the child's character or social inclinations.25 Boniface wondered sincerely how the sacrament could be valid if the child did not understand what was happen- ing. Augustine replied by recourse to signs and what they represent. He noted that on Easter Sunday one may proclaim, "This is the day the Lord rose from the dead"-even though it is not the actual day of resurrection; no one would think the statement is a lie because there exists a certain likeness between the first Easter Sunday and all subsequent Easter Sundays.26 In a similar vein, Christ was offered up only once as a sacrifice, yet no one doubts the validity of the countless daily sacrificial sacraments. If sacraments did not have some points of real semblance to the things of which they are sacraments, insists Augustine, they would not be sacraments.27 Indeed, he asserts that in a certain way "the sacrament of Christ's body is Christ's body, the sacrament of 24.

Compare Augustine's In Iohannis Evangelium 26.11, 15, 18; 50.2; 116.4; 120.3; 123.2 (CCh 36.264-265, 268, 433-434, 648, 661-662, 676); De Civitate Dei 10.17, 32; 16.43; 19.23 (CSEL 40.1.476-477, 503-510; 40.2.200-203, 411-418). 25. Augustine, Epistulae 98.7 (CSEL 34.2.528-529); hereafter cited as Ep. See also Berrouard, "Similitudo," pp. 323-324. The whole of letter 98 deals with the use of similitudo. 26. "Nempe saepe ita loquimur, ut pascha propinquante dicamus crastinam uel perendinam domini passionem, cum ille ante tam multos annos passus sit nec omnino nisi semel illa passio facta sit. Nempe ipso die dominico dicimus: 'Hodie dominus resurrexit,' cum, ex quo resurrexit, tot anni transierint. cur nemo tam ineptus est, ut nos ita loquentes arguat esse mentitos, nisi quia istos dies secundum illorum, quibus haec gesta sunt, similitudinem nuncupamus, ut dicatur ipse dies, qui non est ipse sed reuolutione temporis similis eius, et dicatur illo die fieri propter sacramenti celebrationem, quod non illo die sed iam olim factum est?" (Ep. 98.9 [CSEL 34.2.530]). It is the similitude of the days which is of importance, that is, the sign and that to which the sign refers. 27. "Si enim sacramenta quandam similitudinem rerum earum, quarum sacramenta sunt, non haberent, omnino sacramenta non essent" (Ep. 98.9 [CSEL 34.2.531]). 11</page><page sequence="6">CHURCH HISTORY Christ's blood is Christ's blood just as the sacrament of faith is faith."28 Thus, an infant who becomes a believer through the sacrament of faith is of the faithful; when he matures he need not repeat the sacrament but will come to understand and appreciate its meaning.29 God's accommodating nature is displayed in the intimate connection between the sign and that to which it refers. Similitudo permitted Augustine to preserve intact the relationship between new signs and old ones without debasing the meaning or value of either. As an allegorical method of scriptural exegesis, it enabled Augustine to move freely from Jewish to Christian observance. Augustine suggests that the first sacraments were harbingers of Christ, who fulfilled them by his coming.30 They were required for a carnal and stiff-necked people. Now other sacraments-more efficacious, more benefi- cial, easier to perform, and fewer in number-have been instituted. The Jewish sacrifices were good because they were directed neither to pagan idols nor to earthly things but to God. They were symbols (figurae) which may change with time much as the form of a verb may change according to its tense.31 By reinterpreting old symbols as new ones, the church was able to bring new believers to Christ. Augustine searches the historical record of the church to ferret out evidence. He writes that the first Christians came to Christ as Jews. From the outset, Christianity accommodated its message to the ears of those who listened to the word of Christ.32 Jews were brought to change their customs slowly by degrees, and the apostle Paul permitted them to preserve their hereditary worship and the belief in which they had been born and raised. He 28. Following directly after the sentence in n. 27, the text continues: "ex hac autem similitudine plerumque iam ipsarum rerum nomina accipiunt. Sicut ergo secundum quendam modum sacramentum corporis Christi corpus Christi est, sacramentum sanguinis Christi sanguis Christi est, ita sacramentum fidei fides est" (Ep. 98.9 [CSEL 34.2.531]). 29. Ep. 98.10 (CSEL 34.2.531-533). 30. "Proinde prima sacramenta, quae observabantur et celebrabantur ex lege, praenuntiativa erant Christi venturi: quae cum suo adventu Christus inplevisset, ablata sunt, et ideo ablata, quia inpleta; non enim venit legem solvere, sed adinplere" (C. Faust. 19.7, 19.13 [CSEL 25.1.503-505, 510]). Note the skillful chiasmatic construction: inplevisset/ablata: ablata/ inpleta. Augustine's careful and stylistic use of language can be seen in n. 31 below. 31. "Si enim soni verborum, quibus loquimur, pro tempore conmutantur. Eademque res aliter adnuntiatur facienda, aliter facta, sicut ista ipsa duo verba, quae dixi, facienda et facta, nec paribus morarum intervallis nec isdem vel totidem litteris syllabisue sonuerunt: quid mirum, si aliis mysteriorum signaculis passio et resurrectio Christi futura promissa est, aliis iam facta adnuntiatur, quandoquidem ipsa verba "futurum et factum," "passurus et passus," "resurrecturus et resurrexit," nec tendi aequaliter nec similiter sonare potuerunt? Quid enim sunt aliud quaeque corporalia sacramenta nisi quaedam quasi verba visibilia, sacrosancta quidem verum tamen mutabilia et temporalia" (C. Faust. 19.16 [CSEL 25.1.512-513]). "Sicut ergo ista verba ita illa prioris populi sacramenta, qui per eum, qui non venit legem prophetas solvere sed adinplere, iam inpleta sunt, ideo tolli mutarique debuerunt .. ." (C. Faust. 19.17 [CSEL 25.1.514]). The definition of sacraments as visible representations brings to mind the gregorian metaphor of images as books for the unlettered; compare Junilius Africanus, De partibus divinae legis (Migne, PL 68.33). 32. C. Faust. 19.17 (CSEL 25.1.514). 12</page><page sequence="7">SACRIFICE AS EDUCATION required those who helped spread the word of Christ to make allowance for the reluctance of people to drop old customs and adopt new ones.33 Augustine focuses on Acts 16, which tells that Paul circumcised Timothy, the son of a Jewish mother and a Greek father. He asserts that this was done when Paul went among Jews because Paul "accommodated his practice to theirs, not hypocritically, but for a wise purpose."34 Just as the Lord had used accommodation, so did early Christianity. However, the new meaning of old symbols was part of a larger and more irritating issue facing the early church. By defending the ties between the two testaments, Augustine had silenced the schismatics. But he had not answered the pagans who asked, quite simply and honestly: Why does God spurn ancient offerings yet delight in new ones? Why does God change things once commanded? In a response to Deogratias concerning the resurrection, Augustine wrote, Thus religion has been outwardly expressed and carried on under one set of names and signs in times past and another set now. It was more secret then but more open now. It had fewer worshipers in times past but more now. Yet it is one and the same true religion.35 Augustine thus buttressed the links between the manifestations of the true faith, defusing the problem of a fickle God. That same problem had been raised by Marcellinus, who, in a letter to Augustine, mentioned a certain Volusian, whose faith had been shaken by those "who defame the dispensa- tion of the Lord's Incarnation."36 It was a common problem of late antiquity: How could a cultured pagan accept the Incarnation? Augustine's answer to Marcellinus emphasizes the function of change in the natural world and in human affairs. He suggests that if one desired to demonstrate the regularity of change in nature and in human affairs, time rather than examples would be lacking.37 Indeed, one notices the change of seasons and the birth, growth, and senescence of humans. These are obvious, regular changes. He makes his point rhetorically as well as philosophically. "All these things change, yet the method of divine providence, by which they are made to change, does not change" (haec omnia mutantur nec mutatur divinae providentiae ratio, qua fit, ut ista mutentur).38 Augustine recounts the case of Vindician, a physician who would prescribe certain remedies for ailments but never the same panacea for the same patient at different times.39 Augustine enjoyed the medical metaphor and used it to 33. Ibid.; and compare Benin, "No Other Gods," pp. 131-134. 34. "Inde est quod Timotheum iudaea matre et graeco patre natum propter illos, ad quos tales cum eo venerat, etiam circumcidit apostolus atque ipse inter eos morem huiusmodi custodivit non simulatione fallaci, sed consilio prudenti ...

Indeed, a physician could prescribe one medicine to weaker patients through an assistant while prescribing another to stronger patients. Augustine solves the problem with an expansive metaphor. The art of medicine remains the same and quite unchanged, but it changes its prescriptions for the sick, since the state of health changes. So divine providence remains entirely without change, but comes to the aid of mutable creatures in various ways, and commands or forbids different things at different times according to the different stages of their disease, whether it be the vice which is the beginning of death, or the final stage where death itself is imminent.40 Augustine notes that if the times change, true reason demands a change in what was proper to do at some earlier time. He draws a sharp contrast between two qualities: beauty (pulchrum) and fitness or utility (aptum).41 Beauty is gazed upon and praised for its own sake, while utility depends upon something outside of it and, in a sense, fastened to it. Utility or fitness is not prized for its own innate value but for the value of the object to which it is attached.42 Augustine proceeds to explore the use of beauty (pulchrum) and utility (aptum) within the divine economy. He asserts that the sacrifice of old which the Lord had commanded was fit in early times, but no longer obtains. Therefore, God established a new sacrifice fit for this age. God may do this since God knows much better than humanity what is suitably accommodative to each age.43 Thus, the sacrifices given to the Jews were fit for them at that time; the rites were accommodated to the children of Israel at that stage of their development. Christians celebrate a new sacrifice which is fit for them at this time. Augustine applies this principle on a much grander scale as he examines the whole of the human experience. God is the unchanging Creator of all things that change. When He adds, abolishes, curtails, increases or diminishes the rites of any age, He is ordering all events according to His Providence until the beauty of the complete course of time, whose parts are the dispensations suitable to each different period [particulae ... suis quibusque temporibus apta sunt], shall have played itself out, like the melody of some ineffable composer.44 For Augustine there is a fit and useful divine plan that accommodates different times and circumstances. Divine commandments minister to their 40. Augustine, De Vera Religione 17.34 (CCh 32.208). The translation is from John H.S.

Augustine beheld great changes in his life, just as he felt the burden of history. History had meaning, and Augustine meant to explore it. Augustine, together with his fellows in the early church, believed that those historical events-the "narrow thread of prophetic saying and happen- ings"-which culminated in the Incarnation were the most significant.46 To trace that thread required an enlarged field of view. Using the sacrifices of old as a springboard, Augustine jumped from the parochial Jewish customs to the broader canvas of human history. The change in sacrifices hinted at even greater and more profound historical changes implanted by God at creation. Humanity moves, or perhaps gropes imperceptibly, along that narrow thread toward the fulfillment of the divine plan. It was in the City of God that Augustine tackled the issue squarely. He tried to discern broad patterns in human events and to scrutinize humanity's basic motives. The idea of change and permanence took on enhanced meaning in a world where Rome, the very symbol of authority and eternity, could be sacked and put to the torch. Augustine, with the rest of humanity, was peregrini on a peregrinatio in the civitas terrena. Yet, he was certain that the Incarnation had raised the curtain on the final act of the divine drama which would result in the winnowing out of the wheat from the chaff. Jewish history had been one of captivity and freedom, of loss and redemption. In Augustine's hands the parochial yielded to the universal. Human history consisted in the struggle between the citizens of Jerusalem and those of Babylon, creating an eternal and universal tension. As the Jews had endured their exile, so must the citizens of the heavenly city endure in their exile. Not surprisingly, Augustine considered perseverance God's greatest gift.47 Accommodation provided Augustine with a framework on which to erect an immense intellectual edifice encompassing the whole of the human experience. It enabled him to hunt for clues in the Bible and to seek verification of his interpretation in past events. Much like Augustine, Chrysostom also turned to history for verification of his exegesis. 2. Accommodation appears throughout the voluminous writings of Chrysos- tom, but the most trenchant and intriguing analysis of it occurs in part four of 45. The phrase is used by Aphrahat, De circumcisione 11, in J. Parisot, ed., Patrologia Syriaca, 2 vols. (Paris, 1894, 1907), 1: 499. The same idea is found in Ephrem, Isaac of Antioch, Jacob of Sarug, and Dionysius bar Salibhi. For the use of this principle in Syriac, see Stanley Kazan, "Isaac of Antioch's Homily Against the Jews," Oriens Christianus 49 (1965): 57-58; and Benin, "No Other Gods," pp. 101-119. 46. Compare Brown, Augustine, pp. 318-319. 47. Ibid., p. 407. Augustine wrote De dono perserverantiae only two years before his death in 430. It brought, to use Brown's felicitous phrase, "a hard message for a hard age." 15</page><page sequence="10">CHURCH HISTORY his Against the Jews.48 Chrysostom asks several questions. If biblical citations prove that God did not want sacrifices, why were they ordained? Would God have required them and then made the place where they were to be offered inaccessible to worshipers? Having asked the questions, Chrysostom provides the answers.49 He argues that from the very first God did not want sacrifices. For if God had desired them, they would have been required of the illustrious ancestors of old who preceded the Law. The only reason God permits them now is in condescension (sygkatabainon) to Jewish infirmity (astheneia).50 Chrysostom furnishes a parable to explain the divine actions. As a doctor treating a feverish patient may sometimes condone a lesser evil in order to prevent a greater evil from befalling the patient, so did the Lord act with the Jews.51 The Lord finally allowed sacrifice after seeing that the Jews were so frantic in their desire to sacrifice that they were ready to desert to idols (Exod. 32); not only were they ready, but they had in fact already deserted. This sequence of events is discernible in the biblical text. After the Jews feasted to worthless demons, God permitted sacrifices, all but saying: "You are mad and will desire to sacrifice; if so, then sacrifice to Me."52 Chrysostom proceeds to examine subsequent Jewish history. He observes that the Lord did not permit sacrifices to continue forever but by a most wise strategem (dia tes sophotates methodou) withdrew them. The doctor in the parable permitted his patient to drink cold water when the patient's appetite had improved but limited the patient to a drought from a particular cup. The doctor ordered the patient to guard the cup well, while secretly ordering those ministering to the patient to smash the cup. In this way the doctor attempted to still the dangerous desire without aggravating the symptoms of the disease. God did likewise in restricting sacrifice only to Jerusalem. Of course, Chrysostom notes, after a short while the Lord destroyed the city.53 Chrysostom enlarges the analogy. As the doctor shattered the cup, so did the Lord plow under Jerusalem and withdraw the Jews unwillingly from their deeds. If the Lord had openly told them to desist, they, because of their passion for sacrifice, would not have complied easily. But by denying them the designated place, God secretly removed them from the madness of sacrifices.54 48. For a discussion of Antioch in the age of Chrysostom, see Wayne A. Meeks and Robert L.

As the breaking of the vessel prevented the patient from imbibing when it might do harm, so also the leveling of the city made it impossible for the Jews to indulge their habit of sacrifice. In this way the Lord cured their habit. If this were not the case, Chrysostom asks, why were the holy rites celebrated only in one place?55 Chrysostom's rhetorical skills forced him to push the analogy even further. Why, asks Chrysostom, was Judaism tied to sacrifices, the sacrifices limited to a place, the place to a proper time in only one city, and that one city twice leveled? It is a wonderful paradox, he suggests, that the entire world was laid out before the Jews; but they were barred from Jerusalem, where alone sacrifices could be offered. The reason for the razing of Jerusalem was evident to him.56 God was like an architect who laid a foundation, erected walls, and set up vaulted arches bound with a keystone which, if it fell, would bring down the entire structure. Jerusalem was the keystone. When it was removed, the entire structure resting upon it came crashing down.57 Chrysos- tom presents a far-reaching explanation of sacrifice in Jewish history. The metaphor of a doctor dealing with a patient's infirmity helps Chrysostom explain sacrifice. But in his fourth homily on Colossians, he employs the language favored by Augustine, that of a teacher educating a pupil by aiming at the student's level of comprehension.58 Chrysostom suggests that human nature is similar to the life process. In earliest times people were like children. Slowly, through time, the children grew into adulthood, and in the present age they have reached old age. He comments that people are taught philosophy when the soul is at its perfection, when their limbs are unstrung and their struggles over. Youngsters also are said to be taught; but they learn rhetoric and languages, not the great doctrines. The other subjects are withheld from the immature. Chrysostom asserts that God dealt this way with the Jews.59 The Jews were like little children (paidioi), and God set Moses over them as a school teacher (grammatiste). God sketched models for them, as we teach children letters. As we give children coins and buy them sweets to bribe them to go to school, so did God give the Jews wealth and luxury to coax them to heed Moses. God gave them over to a schoolmaster so that they might learn not to despise their tender and loving Father.60 55. Ibid. 56. Adv. Jud. (Migne, PC 48.880-881). 57. Adv. Jud. (Migne, PG 48.881). 58.

The Lord wished to destroy them, but their mentor, Moses, pleaded for them, just as a father may threaten a child and the schoolmaster may intervene on the student's behalf. The wilderness was their school. Chrysostom enriches the metaphor. As children who have been at school too long yearn to leave, so did the Jews wish to flee the desert and return to Egypt. As a teacher who saw a writing tablet poorly written would throw it away to show his anger, so did Moses shatter the tablets of the Law. In such circumstances, the father would not be offended at the teacher's action, even if the tablet were broken. As children fight and quarrel with each other in school, so did the Jews behave in the desert. As a teacher may make his pupils repeat their lessons, so did Moses do with his charges.61 Chrysostom declares that he brings out these similarities to show that the Jews were like children. Even the doctrines they learned, like "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth," were childish. Their experiences in the desert and their skirmishes with the Egyptians and the Amalekites were childish attempts to assuage juvenile anger and rage. As a child yearns for the nursing breast, so did the Jews long for the fleshspots of Egypt. Indeed, as children crave ornaments which elders have, so did Datan and Abiram desire the ornaments of priesthood (Num. 16).62 For Chrysostom this exegetical tour de force explains the Incarnation. Had Christ appeared before he did his lessons would have fallen on deaf ears; the world would have learned naught.63 Chrysostom advises his readers that people learn in stages and that one who attempts to teach reading to a student who has not learned the alphabet will fail to teach the student the alphabet and also how to read. Thus, the Incarnation came at a time when people were adequately prepared and were ready to learn. The times changed and the world was ripe for Christ's message.64 Indeed, Chrysostom notes that in all actions God accommodates human- kind.65 He contrasts the belief that God is a spirit (John 4:24) with the fact of the Incarnation.66 Further, he observes that the Lord at one time delighted in kathaper oun hemeis tois paidiois kai plakountas 6noumetha, kai arguria didomen, en monon par' auton apaitountes, to te6s badizein epi to didaskaleion" (Hor.

Chrysostom finds God's manner easily explainable; the Lord does not consider his own dignity in his actions, but considers only what is best for humanity. Chrysostom states that every part of scripture contains instances of divine accommodation in words as well as in actions. Even the language of scripture is but an accommodation.67 Indeed, the very order of divine salvation is an accommodation.68 For Chrysostom then, accommodation was much more than a powerful hermeneutical device and a way of explaining away customs which hinted at an anthropomorphic deity. In Chrysostom's hands divine accommodation became nothing less than the very process of divine communication, divine revelation, and divine salvation. It was the essence of the divine, grand cosmic plan. CONCLUSION Augustine and Chrysostom employed the exegetical principle of divine accommodation and applied it to the problem of sacrifice in order to shape a new Christian view of history. Accommodation helped them explain why certain rites that were central to the mosaic code had value asfigurae and why these figurae were changed. This exegetical device served to strengthen the bonds between the two laws or dispensations, and thus it was useful for combatting the claims of schismatics. Through accommodation, these two theologians sought to justify the sacrifices of old both as divine pedagogy and as divine kindness; they interpreted sacrifice as but one rung on the ladder of human development which lead to the coming of Christ. Both Augustine and Chrysostom were influenced by the platonic world- view common among the Fathers.69 Accommodation fit the system since it 67. In Epist. Tit. 1.3 (Migne, PG 62.278); In Gen. Horn. 18 (Migne, PG 53.152). For the linguistic accommodation in rabbinic thought, compare the Hebrew maxim, dibberah torah kileshon benei adam, to its Latin equivalent, scriptura humane loguitur.

This understanding may help explain how Augustine, who favored the Alexandrian allegorical approach to scripture, employed language and an approach similar to those of Chrysos- tom, who was schooled in the Antiochene literal tradition. Thus accommoda- tion, as an allegorical device, found a place in the writings of two exegetes, one who normally favored allegory and the other who rarely employed it.70 Augustine and Chrysostom interpreted sacrifice in a manner which enabled them to locate parochial Jewish customs within the broader spectrum of human history. For both, accommodation proved to be more than grist for their productive exegetical mills; it helped them expound the word of God for the unlettered (rudibus), and it pointed them toward a developing Christian interpretation of history. 70. "The school of Antioch ... did not reject the allegorical method but used it very sparingly. And in the case of one of its most articulate representatives, St. John Chrysostom, it is clear that he not only prefers the historical-literal sense but actually rejects allegory [emphasis added]" (Heiko Oberman, Forerunners of the Reformation (Philadelphia, 1981), p. 282). Of course Chrysostom's use of accommodation disproves Oberman's assertion, which is the normal way of describing Chrysostom in particular and the Antiochene school in general. Chrysostom's use of accommodation should prove that one must not categorize any patristic school too rigidly. 20</page></plain_text>
