<plain_text><page sequence="1">NATURE STUDY REVISITED PRISCILLA J. ECCLES Assistant Professor of Education University of Alberta Calgary, Alberta, Canada Whatever happened to Nature Study? According to the mythology of science education, the nature study program, with its sentimental, anthropomorphic sub- ject matter, occupied the time of elementary students until its lingering death following the fatal blow ad- ministered by the Thirty-First Yearbook of the NSSE.1 Like most historical myths, this one could probably do with a little objective study. Recently, I withdrew a copy of this yearbook from the library. The pure condition of the check-out slip might lead to a caustic remark or two about the stu- dents in this university, if I were a little more confident that I myself had ever really read it. However, the relevant section was quickly found in Chapter II, "Some Criticisms of Current Practices in the Teaching of Sci- ence in Elementary and Secondary Schools," written for the committee by S. Ralph Powers: Current statements of aims and objectives of sci- ence for the elementary school show the influence of the points of view that have been formulated during the past half century by workers in the field of nature study . . . This acceptance of outmoded psychological principles has shown itself in an em- phasis upon one kind of science for the elementary grades and another kind of science for the secondary school.2 1 National Society for the Study of Education, A Program for Teach- ing Science.

The point is illustrated by a two-page sec- tion entitled "A Typical Example of Extravagant Claims." 3 The example is horrible indeed. It sug- gests pressing of sprays showing alternate and opposite arrangement of leaves to develop: "An attitude and desire of obedience to the law of love. Confidence in, and habitual practice of, sympathy, humaneness, kind- ness, regularity, patience, persistence, diligence, care, steadfastness, self control, industry, thrift, and intel- lectual honesty. Desire to create happiness." 4 In view of the example, the comments of the committee were temperate, but nature study is flatly branded a failure. After some discussion of the inadequacies of trying to teach science as an integrated or correlated subject, the chapter continues: Commonly Accepted Principles of Nature Study There are three principles which have had gen- eral acceptance as representing the best thought in the field of nature study: 1. Child psychology is distinct from the psychology of adults: this distinction justifies and requires a difference between nature study for elementary schools and science for high schools. 2. Nature study should be primarily observation of common natural objects and processes; the group- ing of the facts learned in nature study to form principles and generalizations should be reserved for high school and college study. 3. A major value of nature study lies in the dis- cipline which it gives in habits of thoughtful observation. There is, in these accepted principles, an emphasis on facts, with an exclusion of principles; an emphasis on nature study for discipline, with no clarification of the meaning of discipline; and an effort to draw a distinction between child and adult psychology . . .5 Also of interest were comments, in the nature of a minority report, by E. Lawrence Palmer, well known as one of the great men of the nature study movement. He writes: Much of the first section of Chapter II would seem to have been written by someone uninformed as to what is justly called "true nature study" in Chapter X.

Much of the criticism of the Fourth Yearbook of the National Education Association, in Chapter II, is justified, but that report was not a product of a professional group identified with nature study. Nature study cannot be "killed" by the burn- ing of so unrepresentative a straw man as that set up in this chapter. Too much good work has been accomplished by leaders in nature study to be offset by any such unfounded charges as this chapter makes against it.6 This seemed worth following up. The library shelves yielded another volume. "The Study of Nature," writ- ten by one Samuel Christian Schmucker, Ph.D., and published in 1911 as part of Lippincotťs Educational Series.7 This book suggests one should study nature - not about nature. Work out of doors whenever possible but, even if impossible, remember that nature work is not nature work unless done from the actual material. Materials should be chosen for their abundance rather than rarety. Do not substitute pictures but use pictures as a preparedness for observation. The study of books is not nature study but to disregard them is to set aside the experience of the past. "To launch oneself into the world as if man had never thought before, and never before turned his eye to nature, would be to forfeit the privileges of being a human being and to lose the advantages of a long civilization." 8 (A sen- tence I would like to call to the attention of some of our more ardent discoverers.) Aims of Nature Study One of the aims of nature study is to foster the development of careful observations. This was not to be done by training some mysterious faculty but by teaching the child what to look for. "The way, then to make the child observant is, in the first place, to keep him hungry for definite things which are likely soon to turn up and to teach him new facts concerning things he has often noticed before." 9 The second aim is a store of valuable information. Doubt is expressed that the ideas of science can be readily understood by young children. The wise teacher, however, is to choose from the immediate environ- ment objects interesting in themselves which science has shown to be worth knowing. Other aims are to provide experiences which make other subjects more meaningful or to add vitality to their study. Beyond these immediate aims, the author hopes that nature study will offer leisure activity to the masses, whom he believes to be cut off from the literature, music, and art which are the leisure time activities of the more cultured classes. This is summarized suc- cinctly as "Nature is Open to the Poor," 10 an ex- pression shocking to the ear of one accustomed to the euphemisms of today. The author is rather more optimistic than I would be about the transfer of scientific exactness into a gen- eral honesty - but perhaps no more so than some mod- ern proponents of the experimental method. If this then were nature study, one can only suggest that many elementary science programs would be con- siderably improved by a good strong dose of it. The emphasis on direct observation of plants and animals in the child's own environment and efforts to foster more accurate habits of observation are essen- tial to the scientific study of biological phenomena. In too many of the elementary science programs that replaced nature study, the children learned generaliza- tions as bookish verbalisms rather than formed gen- eralizations on the basis of experience and observation. It seems only fair to recognize that good nature study programs were in this sense more scientific than many of the mediocre or poor science courses which replaced them. Firsthand Nature Study Can Be Good Science On the other hand, a good science course gives meaning and purpose to the study of nature by relating observations to the constructs of the biological sciences and, further, includes important concepts from the phy- sical sciences. Dr. Schmucker underestimates the capac- ity of the child to handle the abstractions of science. What happened, historically, is that most of what was good in the nature study programs has become part of good elementary science teaching. The ques- tions of how accurate the attacks made upon nature study were and what the effects of these attacks might have been would make an interesting critical study, but not one which would affect present practice. But was there something of value in nature study that has not survived? One emphasis was on a wide acquaintance with plants and animals. This is the kind of kppwledge that makes it possible to go into the out of doors and see, not just birds, but flickers, chick- adees, and flycatchers; not just trees, but sugar maples or Englemen spruce; and not just pretty flowers, but wood lilies and ladies' slippers. Very few children learn this in school today. How much of a loss does it represent? We can teach important concepts of biology and teach them well with only limited use of nature. Good science teaching builds on direct experience, but this can be had through what might be called the laboratory species; hampsters, guinea pigs, geraniums, coleus, rather than the native plants and animals. Let us note, though, that this being "laboratory" work does not mean it is somehow more scientific than good nature «Ibid., p. 361. 7 Samuel Christian Schmucker, The Story of Nature, p. 9. J. B.

The indoor activities are just more convenient and, for most purposes, serve as well. Is there value in knowing the names and something of the habits of wild plants and animals for their own sake? One of the aims of nature study was to provide for pleasant and worthwhile use of leisure time. While we would no longer put this on a class basis, it is still true that the majority of the children in our elementary classes are not now or ever going to spend their leisure time reading Scientific American or T. S. Eliot, listen- ing to good music, or playing chess. Nothing is more difficult than to prove one form of recreation to be in some way better than another. The glorious abandon with which the naturalists made their value judgments is more striking to the modern reader than the rather minor differences in psychological or pedagogical theory. But it would seem that at least as much attention might be given to nature study as to square dancing, sports, craftwork, and the like. There are good reasons not to expect too much of the school. There are many pressures on the curricu- lum which must be judged on a priority basis. The physical location of many schools and the long vaca- tion, during the time of the year when nature study is most pleasant, are major problems. Administratively, outdoor education programs, offered in addition to the regular school year, or day, seem most promising. These programs introduce the child to the pleasures of nature study and to the skills which he needs if it is to become a leisure time activity. An interest and con- cern for the problems of conservation can be developed in the outdoor laboratory to a degree that is probably not possible within the confines of thç ordinary class- room. And the child's experiences in nature can give purpose to the more formal inquiries of the regular science program. A serious obstacle to nature study in the school is that many elementary teachers are not and will never be competent to teach nature study. The basics can be mastered only through much field experience and this requires a strong personal commitment. Attempts to force-feed this to all prospective elementary teachers can only be self-defeating. I am concerned that in the present climate of opinion, teachers who do enjoy nature and are knowledgeable about it will find no opportunity to share this with students. If teachers once felt guilty because they did not have a good nature program, it seems likely that today a teacher might feel guilty who did. Our pursuit of academic excellence has reached such a pitch that we seem to forget the most valuable educative experi- ence of all is to be taught anything by a person pas- sionately devoted to that subject matter. We will not lose the space race if a few teachers, who know they have something to offer in the field of nature study, say firmly, "Stop the pendulum, I want to get off."
