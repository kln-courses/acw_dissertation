<plain_text><page sequence="1">MOCK TRIAL ADMISSIBILITY OF COMPUTERIZED BUSINESS RECORDS SECTION OF LITIGATION?NATIONAL INSTITUTE THE LITIGATOR IN A TECHNOLOGICAL AGE EDITOR'S NOTE: On February 7, 1975, Roy Freed moderated a mock trial of the American Bar Association National Institute ("The Litigator in a Technological Age") presented by the Section of Litigation in New York. This mock trial, conducted before the Honorable Jack B. Weinstein, U.S. District Judge, Eastern District of New York, covered the examination and cross examination of a witness with respect to the validity of computerized business records and the issue of the admissibility of same into evidence. The following statement of the hypothetical problem, and the outline of testimony and issues, were included in the National Institute program materials. The preface by Roy Freed, the test of the examination and cross-examination script, and the closing legal arguments are reproduced here for the first time. Jurimetrics Journal has published some excellent articles on the evidentiary problems raised by computer-generated evi? dence, but the following materials represent the first publication in this journal of a complete mock trial text, including a full problem statement, description of the evidentiary issues, synopses of selected cases and a partial bibliography of materials, the exhibits introduced into evidence, and the examination script.

RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT* It is a poignant experience to write this preface, for a number of reasons. The succeeding material represents an exciting contribution to the enhancement of the abilities of lawyers to represent their clients with the skill required in a society characterized, to a significant extent, by the processing of information automatically by machine?a computerized society. It is a privilege to have been involved with the creation of that material, even merely as a stimulator. Also, that material is a fitting, but long-overdue, sequel to the very elementary, pioneering mock trial of this author first produced at the 1964 Annual Meeting of the American Bar Association under the sponsorship of the ABA Special Committee on Electronic Data Retrieval, a modest ancestor of the present ambitious Section of Science and Technology. The notable contrast between these two works shows the great progress finally being made in interpreting to lawyers the intricacies of the exciting technology that is engulfing us, both personally and profes? sionally. The earlier mock trial is included, in its original form, in Freed, Computers and Law?A Reference Work, Fourth Edition, at pages 57 83. An edited version appears as "Computer Print-outs As Evidence," in volume 16 of American Jurisprudence Proof of Facts Annotated, at pages 273-350. Hopefully, the current development represents a turning point in the sensitivity of lawyers to the use of computers by others and signals the advent of a stream of similar studies of the interaction of computer records and the rules of law. The lawyers who produced the succeeding material flatteringly ob? served that the following articles by this author also provided back? ground material to them for the current effort: "Evidence and Problems of Proof in a Computerized Society," M.U.L.L., December 1963, pages 171-84. ?Copyright ? 1975 by Roy N. Freed. SPRING 1975 207</page><page sequence="3">"Providing by Statute for Inspection of Corporate Computer and Other Records Not Legible Visually," The Business Lawyer, Jan? uary 1968, pages 457-65. It is a pleasure to direct attention to the more recent piece by Bernacchi and Larsen, entitled, "Philosophy, Data Processing, and Rules of Evi? dence," which appeared in the August 1973 issue of the Los Angeles Bar Bulletin, at pages 374-92. The relative dearth of legal articles and reported cases involving records kept in computer systems belies the importance and complexity of the subject. It reflects the failure of many lawyers to grasp the signifi? cance of the technological development and to appreciate the pervasive? ness of its impact. Actually, many practitioners and judges in trial courts have been baffled, if not entirely frustrated, by the challenge of integrat? ing rules on admissibility of evidence with records kept in binary form as arrangements of minute magnetized spots on the surfaces of plastic tapes and disks. Efforts to reach lawyers through articles and continuing education conferences, such as the seven "Law and Computers" forums conducted by the Joint Committee on Continuing Legal Education of the American Law Institute and the American Bar Association since 1961 and programs at a number of American Bar Association Annual Meet? ings, were largely in vain, because most lawyers have been unable to recognize the involvement of the technology in their day-to-day work. By good fortune, the pioneers among us remained persuaded of the validity of our conviction that the technological revolution required the close attention of most lawyers not only to its interaction with rules of evidence but also with very many aspects of substantive law. Today, there is hardly a business of any significance that does not depend upon computers at least for its recordkeeping, if not for other information processing functions as well. Hopefully, the long time-lag of legal atten? tion has now ended and close interaction of lawyers with the extremely important subject will continue. Since the new methods for processing information directly by ma? chine, pursuant to well-defined processes known as "software programs," instead of by people operating machines, introduce numerous novel fac? tual considerations, those factual aspects require understanding from a legal perspective if the existing sets of legal rules respecting admissibility of evidence are to be applied to the new phenomena soundly. Despite the apparent feeling of many computer specialists that such radically new phenomena merit new legal rules, the only sound approach is to deter? mine first whether existing rules provide a proper basis for handling those phenomena when they are genuinely understood. The problem thus far has been a failure to appreciate the realities of the new phenomena and their many underlying identities with earlier counterparts. Lawyers must contribute to a smooth transition from people-pro? cessing to machine-processing of information, avoiding the imposition of unnecessary burdens that result from misunderstanding and bring law? yers into disrepute among computer cognoscenti. To that end, they must become sufficiently knowledgeable respecting computer technology to 208 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="4">acquit their responsibilities with full professionalism. The succeeding presentation is designed to indicate the type of knowledge and facility required. It contributes substantial insight in that regard. But it is merely one example and treats only one facet. Admissibility of computer records might be sought also under the official records exception to the hearsay rule and, even more interestingly, as admissions against the interest of the entity on whose behalf they are made. What a temptation to indulge in the anthropomorphic qualities of computers! In preparing for involvement with computers as regards the admissi? bility of new forms of records, there are a number of different facets that require attention. First, lawyers must be prepared for involvement with computer records not only in litigation but also in office counselling. They should advise computer specialists on how evidence admissibility rules relate to computer system design. At the very least, any general types of probative deficiencies in computerized recordkeeping systems uncovered by testing in court should be remedied by improvements in system design. Lawyers are ideally situated to inform system designers about those developments. But many system designers can benefit even from guidance on basic evidentiary rules in order to avoid either legal defects because of sheer ignorance or more onerous operating procedures than necessary. In fact, a wide variety of legal considerations in addition to admissibility of records frequently can be important factors in system design, such as tort liability, especially of software program suppliers, and communications regulation. Efforts to alert system designers to the need to identify and respect those legal factors in performing their function must be expanded. It is an important exercise in preventive law. Lawyers also will encounter an interesting challenge because of the expanding practice of companies to delegate their recordkeeping func? tions to outsiders that provide computer usage. These can be so-called, already traditional service bureaus and the newer commercial time-shar? ing system operators. Both have records of their customers on their premises, subject to more physical control by them than by the owners of the records. In addition, the records themselves tend to be significantly different in arrangements and content from familiar types of business records. For example, considerable coding is used to take advantage of the facility of the machines to work with abbreviated data. Similarly, information might be recorded with less organization at that time because of the ability of the machines to assemble it while searching for it. It is hoped that conferences such as the one for which the succeeding material was created will introduce large numbers of lawyers to the exciting intellectual exercise of applying legal rules to a wide variety of properties and transactions involving computer technology. These op? portunities are available in such diverse fields as contracts, taxes, torts, corporate law, antitrust, intellectual property, and communications regu? lations, as well as evidence. They exist routinely in practice as well as in law teaching. In fact, they represent the normal professional services lawyers perform for their clients in contemporary society.

Partial Bibliography.218 V. Outline of Testimony and Issues?Exhibit Formats .... 219 VI. Examination of Authenticating Witness .224 VII. Cross-Examination of Authenticating Witness.239 L Statement of Problem Plaintiff, a privately owned corporation which manufactures exclusive widgets, is suing defendant, a Euphoria corporation, in Euphoria state court, for lost profits resulting from lost sales due to defendant's refusal to perform a written contract with plaintiff to supply an important com? ponent used in plaintiff's widget. Plaintiff ran out of the components in November of 1973 and had its production facilities closed for four months. Starting in March 1974 plaintiff was forced to use an inferior component. The issue of liability was resolved in plaintiff's favor on a summary judgment motion and the only remaining issue at this trial is damages. Plaintiff is a small company which uses a data processing service bureau by the name of Acme Computer Service Bureau ("Service Bu? reau"), to process and keep its sales and accounts receivable records. Service Bureau prepares the picking lists, bills of lading and invoices from the order information received from plaintiff. Service Bureau also pre? pares periodical sales reports for use in plaintiff's financial statement preparation. For some years, plaintiff has employed Service Bureau to process its sales orders and do the necessary record keeping for the accounts receivable. Because of costs, however, other accounting, inven? tory controls, production scheduling, and all other record-keeping is still done manually by plaintiff. Service Bureau operates a time-sharing com? puter system with several users, including plaintiff. Except for emergency orders, most of plaintiffs work is done in a batch processing mode, which means plaintiff delivers sales orders and material return authorizations (RA's) to Service Bureau by messenger. Service Bureau has a keypunching department which takes the orders and RA's ("source documents") and punches the information into cards. The source documents and the cards are then sent to another department and are verified by another machine operator using a verifying machine. Plaintiff also offers an expedited delivery service for emergency orders. To receive expedited services, customers call plaintiffs office and ?Copyright ? 1975 William A. Fenwick and Richard M. McGonigal. 210 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="6">give a clerk the order information over the phone. Plaintiff has installed a teletype terminal by which it enters emergency orders directly into Service Bureau's computer. Until two years ago, plaintiff had the custom? ers send in written confirmations of the emergency orders. Because many of the confirming orders did not state they were for confirmation, plaintiff had problems with duplicate orders. For that reason confirmation orders were discontinued by plaintiff. When payments are received by plaintiff, plaintiff transmits the pay? ment information to Service Bureau via the teletype terminal. Plaintiff deposits the funds in its bank account and Service Bureau never sees any documents relating to payments. Plaintiff seeks to enter into evidence a computer prepared summary of its sales of widgets for the past four years and a set of tables and other information prepared by the computer to show relative profitability of plaintiff at various levels of gross sales. The summary was specially prepared for this litigation from processing information stored on mag? netic tapes which are created and kept by Service Bureau. The tables and other information were prepared from cost and sales projection informa? tion given to Service Bureau by plaintiff. Service Bureau wrote a special program which exploded the cost information and correlated the data to produce the tables. Neither of the special programs written to prepare the summary and tables were documented in the manner required by Service Bureau's documentation standards because they were not permanent programs. Plaintiff has the following items in court: (i) the eight magnetic tapes used to produce the summary; (ii) a tape print showing the information contained in the first few records on one of the magnetic tapes; (iii) a listing of the source and object code for the special programs which were written solely for producing the summary and tables; and (iv) a record format which explains the content of the records con? tained on the magnetic tapes. Service Bureau uses the following procedures in handling plaintiffs records. All input data, whether teletyped directly or received in written form and then keypunched, is stored on disk packs along with the results of processing on a daily basis. Service Bureau verifies all keypunching; it cannot verify the teletyped information. Except to the extent that the computer program edits the teletyped input information as it is proc? essed, that information is not verified. Files on disk packs are used as primary storage devices for all the data processing necessary to produce customer billing and shipping. All the detailed information from the daily transactions is stored on the disk packs through the use of what amounts to variable length records. Each day when new activity occurs on an account, the account balances are adjusted and the detail information is added to the end of that customer's record. Every six months the inactive details (i.e., orders that have been shipped, billed and paid for) are "purged" from the disk SPRING 1975 211</page><page sequence="7">packs with all detail information transferred to magnetic tape. A dupli? cate of the account balances and other information is also "dumped" onto the same magnetic tape. Account balances and active billing data is retained continually on the disk packs for use in future daily process? ing. The magnetic tapes are used by the computer for the preparation of miscellaneous reports and to provide sales information for the annual reports. The only other use made of the information on the tapes is that the tapes are used to restore information on the disk packs if information on the disk packs is accidentally destroyed. Otherwise, the tapes are not generally relied upon by management. Except for expedited orders, plaintiffs picking lists and shipping papers for each day's orders are delivered to plaintiff the next morning for picking and shipping. The picking list and the information for ship? ping papers for expedited orders are sent to plaintiff via the teletype terminal. Service Bureau prepares and mails invoices on a daily basis. Except for standard hardware checks, tapes are not checked or verified for accuracy or readability when written (that is, when informa? tion is transferred from the disk packs to the tapes) on the ground that it is expensive to do so and that the use to which the information on the tapes will be put simply does not warrant the extra expense. The reason for putting the information on the tapes is to reduce the cost of storage (tapes are much cheaper than disk packs) and to facilitate reorganization of the records on the disk packs. For all information received by Service Bureau via the teletype terminal the computer punches out cards. The computer created cards are stored with the processed punch cards which were created by Service Bureau's keypunches. All cards for each day are stored together. The cards are stored at Service Bureau in card files that are accessible to all employees of Service Bureau. The only time the cards are reused is when information on the disk packs has been accidentally destroyed. In such situations the disk packs are restored with the magnetic tapes and the cards reflecting transactions that have occurred since the tapes were prepared are reprocessed to bring the disk pack back up to date. The magnetic tapes are stored in Service Bureau's tape library and are accessible to all employees of Service Bureau. A complete record format containing a clear description as to how the tapes are organized is readily available at Service Bureau. No attempt is made by Service Bureau to restrict access to the cards, tapes and record format to em? ployees with a need to know. Vandals broke into Service Bureau two years ago and had a tape "orgy" but none of plaintiffs tapes were de? stroyed. The case arises in a Euphoria trial court. Euphoria has, by statute, adopted the Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act which provides: A record of an act, condition or event, shall, insofar as relevant, be competent evidence if the custodian or other qualified witness testifies to its identity and the mode of its preparation, and if it was made in the regular course of business, at or near the time of the act, condition or event, and if, in the opinion of the court, the sources 212 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="8">of information, method and time of preparation were such as to justify its admission. Euphoria has also by statute adopted the Model Best Evidence rule which provides in pertinent part: ... no evidence other than the writing itself is admissible unless (a) evidence has been introduced sufficient to support a finding that the writing once existed and is not a writing produced at the trial, and (b) the judge finds that ... (i) it is now unavailable for some reason other than the culpable negligence or wrongdoing of the proponent of the evidence, or (ii) it would be unfair or inexpedient to require the proponent to produce the writing; ... Euphoria has also adopted the Uniform Photographic Copies of Business and Public Records as Evidence Act which provides: If any business ... in the regular course of business or activity has kept or recorded any memorandum, writing, entry, print, repre? sentation or combination thereof, of any act transaction, occurrence or event, and in the regular course of business has caused any or all of the same to be recorded, copied or reproduced by any photograph? ic, photostatic, microfilm, micro-card, miniature photographic, or other process which accurately reproduces or forms a durable medi? um for so reproducing the original, the original may be destroyed in the regular course of business unless held in a custodial or fiduci? ary capacity or unless its preservation is required by law. Such reproduction, when satisfactorily identified, is as admissible in evi? dence as the original itself in any judicial or administrative proceed? ing, whether the original is in existence or not, and an enlargement or facsimile of such reproduction is likewise admissible in evidence, if the original reproduction is in existence and available for inspec? tion under direction of court. The introduction of a reproduced record, enlargement or facsimile, does not preclude admission of the original, [emphasis added] Lastly, Euphoria has adopted by statute a Voluminous Writings exception to the Best Evidence Rule which states: Secondary evidence, whether written or oral, of the content of a writing is not made inadmissible by the best evidence rule if the writing consists of numerous accounts or other writings that cannot be examined in court without great loss of time, and the evidence sought from them is only the general result of the whole; but the court in its discretion may require that such accounts or other writ? ings be produced for inspection by the adverse party. Plaintiffs witness for laying the foundation for admitting the records is Corebite Jones, Service Bureau's Vice President in charge of computer operations and custodian of all records maintained at Service Bureau. Defendant does not own or use a computer in its business and has no employee with experience operating or programming computers. SPRING 1975</page><page sequence="9">II.

Selected Cases Upholding Admission Transport Indemnity Co. v. Seib, 1 C.L.S.R. 368, 132 N.W.2d 871 (Neb. 1965). Landmark computerized business records decision. Plaintiff in? troduced computer print-out to show amount of premium due; a very extensive foundation was laid by plaintiffs Director of Ac? counting, who was custodian of the magnetic tapes and who de? scribed in detail the operation of the computer. The court accepted the foundation and rejected the contention that the print-out was inadmissible because it was prepared specifically for the trial. This argument was found to exalt "form over the substance," because while retrieval was made for trial purposes, "the taped record and the information and calculations thereon were made in the usual course of business and for the purpose of the business alone." The court further commented: The statute [Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act] was intended to bring the realities of business and professional practice into the courtroom and the statute should not be interpreted narrow? ly to destroy its obvious usefulness. King v. State ex rel. Murdoch Acceptance Corp., 2 C.L.S.R. 180, 222 So.2d 393 (Miss. 1969). Computer print-outs held admissible under common law shop book rule over best evidence objection and argument that the ac? counting manager, who supervised operation of the machine, had no 214 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="10">personal knowledge of the data (input was furnished by branch offices); court held records admissible. U.S. v. De Georgia, 2 C.L.S.R. 479, 420 F.2d 889 (9th Cir. 1969). Testimony based upon information obtained from a computer print-out admitted, though the print-out itself was never introduced; foundation laid as to computer input procedures but not accuracy. The court ruled the foundation adequate because defendant raised no question in the trial court as to the mechanical accuracy of the computer. The court declined to rule on defendant's best evidence rule objection that the print-out itself was never introduced on grounds that no such objection was raised in the trial court. State v. Watson, 218 N.W.2d 904 (Neb. 1974). Defendant objected to testimony laying the foundation for ad? mission of a computer print-out of his overdrawn account, which objection was sustained. Defendant asked no questions about the exhibit or accuracy of the computer system. Held on Appeal: Defendant may not complain successfully about any lack of foundation which he improperly succeeded in keeping out. Further, because the bank was not a party to the litiga? tion, the court found the records properly admitted as entries of a third party made in the regular course of business under circum? stances calculated to insure accuracy and precluding any motive of misrepresentation. Endicott Johnson Corp. v. Golde, 190 N.W.2d 752 (N.D. 1971). Computerized invoices admitted where witness had no personal knowledge of the operation of the computer system or the informa? tion contained in the invoices, but was generally familiar with the method employed by the company processing orders placed with it. The court stated its reluctance to require plaintiff to incur the cost of sending a more qualified person to lay the foundation and, though not so stating, may have been satisfied of the trustworthiness of the computerized invoices by the fact that photostatic copies of the original orders were available to cross-check against the invoices. City of Seattle v. Heath, 520 P.2d 1392 (Wash. App. 1974). Traffic Bureau official testified that he was the custodian of abstracts teletyped to the Traffic Bureau from the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer, where all records were stored. The court, relying on King, found the witness "qualified" to testify as to the identity and mode of preparation of the teletyped print-outs and upheld the trial court's admission of the abstracts. State v. Veres, 1 C.L.S.R. 918, 436 P.2d 629 (Ariz. App. 1968). Mechanically produced bank records introduced to show over? drafts in defendants bank account; witness (bank officer) testified that his only knowledge of the records was his access to them: he did not prepare the records and was not aware of the mechanical operation of the machine. The records were admitted, despite lack SPRING 1975 215</page><page sequence="11">of testimony as to mode of preparation and reliability, on grounds of trial court discretion. Merrick v. U.S. Rubber Co., 1 C.L.S.R. 995, 440 P.2d 314 (Ariz. App. 1968). Suit on open account maintained on electronic accounting equipment; witness testified that he had no personal knowledge of the actual physical operation of the computer but that he was gener? ally familiar with plaintiffs accounting records. Citing the wide dis? cretion of the trial court, the court upheld admission of the records. Associated Metals &amp; Minerals Corp. v. Dixon Chemical &amp; Research, Inc., 1 C.L.S.R. 236, 197 A.2d 569 (N.J. App. Div. 1968). "Summaries of plaintiffs books of account, prepared by plain? tiffs employees for use at trial, were properly admitted in evidence as exception to best evidence rule where books of account consisted of numerous entries, the production and examination of which would cause inconvenience, where books of account were in court pursuant to defendant's subpoena, and where defendant had oppor? tunity to inspect original records for a year before trial but had never done so." D &amp; HAuto Parts, Inc. v. Ford Marketing Corp., 3 C.L.S.R. 856 (E.D. N.Y. 1973). An action brought by an automobile parts jobber and wholesal? er against Ford Motor Company alleging, among other things, breach of contract, Robinson-Patman Act violation, and Clayton Act violation against Ford Marketing Corporation ("Ford"). The jobber objected to the introduction into evidence of a computer print-out containing a monthly summary of sales to the jobber. The monthly summary was used internally by the Ford management. The trial was before a jury which found for Ford. Ford used its assistant controller who was in charge of Ford's field accounting department, general office accounting department, credit depart? ment and incentive control and analysis department as the authen? ticating witness. Ford did not produce the head of its data processing department or any of its computer people. The court held: the com? puter print-out was admissible even though Ford failed to use a witness familiar with its data processing department for the authen? tication. One factor influencing the court's decision was that the jobber had in its possession from December of 1971 until June of 1972 copies of the computer print-outs sought to be introduced and had failed to point out any areas of inaccuracy during that period. Rejecting Admission People v. Gauer, 4 C.L.S.R. 477, 288 N.E.2d 24 (111. App. 1972). Certain telephone calls were traced and the calling numbers and time automatically recorded on cards, which were introduced to 216 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="12">show that defendant made the calls. One witness testified generally as to how the tracer worked and a second witness testified that he was custodian of the records and that the company relied on the records. The court refused to accept the evidence because neither witness testified to the reliability of the equipment and the tracing operation. Railroad Commission v. Southern Pacific Co., 3 C.L.S.R. 720, 468 S.W.2d 125 (Tex. Civ. App. 1971). Summary of voluminous records may be admitted in discretion of trial court if underlying records are admissible, but here, where computer print-out was introduced upon the testimony of a witness (cost analyst) who was neither the custodian of the records nor qualified to testify as to the "legitimacy and accuracy" of the print? outs, foundation was held inadequate. Kamen &amp; Co. v. Young, 4 C.L.S.R. 444, 466 S.W.2d 381 (Tex.Civ. App. 1971). Held: Computer print-outs inadmissible because there was "no proof that the person who prepared [the data on which the print-outs were based] had personal knowledge of the data or information allegedly printed into the cards." Decision criticized in 24 Baylor L. Rev. 161 (1972) on grounds that Texas statute does not require such a showing. Related Examples of Evidence Rules ALI Model Code of Evidence, Rule 514: (1) A writing offered as a memorandum or record of an act, event or condition is admissible as tending to prove the occurrence of the act or event or the existence of the condition if the judge finds that it was made in the regular course of business and that it was the regular course of that business for one with personal knowledge of such an act, event or condition to make such a memorandum or record or to transmit information thereof to be included in such a memorandum or record, and for the memorandum or record to be made at or about the time of act, event or condition or within a reasonable time thereafter. Uniform Rule of Evidence, Rule 63 (13): Writings offered as memoranda or records of acts, conditions or events to prove the facts stated therein, if the judge finds that they were made in the regular course of a business at or about the time of the act, condition or event recorded, and that the sources of information from which made and the method and circumstances of their preparation were such as to indicate their trustworthiness. Newly Adopted Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 803 (6) pro? vides a hearsay exception for: A memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any SPRING 1975 217</page><page sequence="13">form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified wit? ness, unless the source of information or the method or circum? stances or preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness. The term "business" as used in this paragraph includes business, institution, association, profession, occupation, and calling of every kind, whether or not conducted for profit. Newly Adopted Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 1006 provides: The contents of voluminous writings, recordings, or photo? graphs which cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart, summary, or calculation. The originals, or duplicates, shall be made available for examination or copying, or both, by other parties at a reasonable time and place. The court may order that they be produced in court. An interesting state statute is that of Iowa, which provides: Any writing or record, whether in the form of an entry in a book, or otherwise, including electronic means and interpretations thereof, offered as memoranda or records of acts, conditions or events to prove the facts stated therein, shall be admissible as evi? dence if the judge finds that they were made in the regular course of a business at or about the time of the act, condition or event recorded, and that the sources of information from which made and the method and circumstances of their preparation were such as to indicate their trustworthiness, and if the judge finds that they are not excludable as evidence because of any rule of admissibility of evi? dence other than the hearsay rule.

Other Uses Made of the Tapes Which Were Used as Input to the Special Problem A. Miscellaneous report generation B. Sales figures for annual reports C. Restoring of disk packs when backup dumps have failed D. Complying with record-keeping requirements of IRS (the wit? ness has been told by Wigmore representatives that these tapes must be kept for that purpose) 6. Cross-examination A. Witness' lack of personal knowledge about Wigmore's ac? counting practices. Witness' knowledge is restricted to taking information without knowing its authenticity, performing the mechanical function of keypunching it, and processing it on the computer and returning the results. Witness is neither an employee of Wigmore nor acquainted with Wigmore's busi? ness methods and routine ? Card inputs are created from source documents punched by Service Bureau, but Service Bureau has no knowledge of the authenticity of the source documents or how they are pre? pared. Service Bureau gets the output in the form of in? voices which it mails to persons or organizations named in the invoices and gets picking lists and shipping instructions which it gives to Wigmore without any knowledge of their use. There are no documents received by Service Bureau which confirm that in fact goods were sent ? Transmitted input (Service Bureau does not see any docu? ments or other information regarding input on expedited orders because there are no source documents and no cards. All information is transmitted from machine to machine, with no effort by Service Bureau at all. The only output Service Bureau sees with regard to expedited orders are the invoices, which are not identified as being invoices for expe? dited orders. Service Bureau receives no picking lists or shipping information for expedited orders because that is transmitted directly to the teletype terminal) B. Neither Exhibit "A" nor Exhibit "B" is a record prepared and kept in the regular course of business. The Exhibits were pre? pared by special programs written solely for the purpose of providing them and were not: ? Properly documented ? Used for or relied on for any other purpose ? Properly tested (not all input conditions, i.e., types of records, were included in the testing) C. Neither the magnetic tapes nor the Exhibits were made at or near the time of sales or invoice preparation. The input used SPRING 1975 221</page><page sequence="17">to construct the tapes was not entered onto tape for at least eight or nine months and the Exhibits themselves were pre? pared years later D. Lack of protection from tampering ? All Service Bureau employees have access to the tapes ? Knowledge of the contents of the tapes is readily available to all employees via the record format ? Service Bureau's premises are not secure (1) Tape orgy incident (2) Access of the public to the tape library (3) Service Bureau does not have any special security sys? tems requiring persons on the premises to sign in and out (4) Service Bureau has no security guards or security clearance procedures for its employees E. Accuracy and reliability challenge to input, processing and manipulation ? No listing of the programs that generated the original record has been produced and the witness' testimony about that preparation is inadequate ? The records used for input are copies of the original entries and no attempt is made to verify that they are accurate copies ? No listing of the programs that copied the records from the disk packs to the tapes has been testified to or produced ? The programs were not designed by the witness nor written pursuant to his supervision ? No verification of the accuracy of the copying has been provided and the copying was done by the computer and not by the witness ? Witness did not run the programs that originally put the information on the disk packs and does not know who did ? Witness did not run the programs that dumped the informa? tion on the tapes and does not know who did ? The witness does not know whether any tape errors or other processing errors were incurred either in the original prepa? ration of the records or in the copying of the records ? No verification of expedited, teletyped orders ? No written confirmation of expedited orders is received because payment information is also teletyped into comput? er; Service Bureau therefore never sees any document from the purchaser to verify that purchaser in fact made purchase ? The witness is not qualified to testify about the accuracy or reliability of the teletyped information which constitutes all 222 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="18">payment information and is the key information for verify? ing the sales data ? Tapes are not checked or verified for accuracy or readabili? ty when disk packs are dumped onto tape ? Special programs written to prepare the Exhibits were not documented 7. Objections to Admission of Exhibits A. Best evidence rule ? The magnetic tapes, rather than the print-outs (Exhibits), are the "records" and thus the best evidence for admission NOTE: This argument was rejected in King, where the court found computer print-outs to be the best evidence on grounds that records stored on magnetic tape would otherwise be "unavailable and useless." B. Voluminous records exception is inapplicable ? Exhibit "A" is a summary rather than the complete record. The entire record should be introduced. Defendant cannot otherwise verify the data or the magnetic tapes NOTE: This argument was rejected in a dictum in Railroad Commission. A further problem is that should Wigmore be ordered to produce the complete record, inspection of such a volume of information would be next to impossible during the trial, thus eliminating in fact defendant's opportunity to cross-examine meaningfully as to missing or altered informa? tion. It should be noted that in Railroad Commission the Court rejected an exhibit which purported to be an abstract of other evidence of the party. "The other evidence consisted of a mass of documents, estimated by counsel for the railroad as four feet by two and a half feet by about three feet which were made available in court during the latter part of the testimony of Boudreaux and afterwards admitted in evidence." See also the Golde case. C. Witness is not qualified to lay foundation because he has no personal knowledge of the accounting procedures of Wigmore and therefore cannot testify to the accuracy and reliability of the information stored on tape and used in the preparation of the Exhibits NOTE: This argument was upheld in Kamen, but is general? ly rejected. The argument is perhaps stronger here, where there is a clear separation of computer functions from the remainder of Wigmore's business and record keeping activi? ties. In typical cases, the computer operation is part of the record keeping machinery of the business involved. The Court in Railroad Commission excluded an exhibit prepared SPRING 1975 223</page><page sequence="19">from computer print-outs on the basis that the witness (a cost analyst) "was not qualified as the custodian of the records nor was he offered as the railroad employee having sufficient knowledge of the records to prove the legitimacy and accura? cy of the computer print-out." D. Exhibits are inadmissible because they were prepared espe? cially for use in this litigation and not in the regular course of business E. Exhibits are inadmissible because magnetic tapes were not prepared at or near the time of the sales or invoices they reflect F. Exhibits are inadmissible because adequate controls to insure accuracy, reliability and freedom from tampering have not been sufficiently documented G. Even if Exhibit "A" is admitted, Exhibit "B" must be rejected on grounds that it presents information not contained in the computer records, not personally known to Corebite Jones, and over which Corebite Jones is not custodian 8.

How long have you had responsibility for the Wigmore account? A. During the entire period they have used Service Bureau. Q. Would you describe, again, what Service Bureau does for Wig? more? A. Service Bureau provides the data processing necessary for Wig more's accounts receivable. 226 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="22">Q. What does that mean? A. We get information from Wigmore about orders, returns and pay? ments. We process the information producing invoices, picking lists and shipping documents. We also provide the sales data for preparation of financials and we maintain their accounts receivable records for all their customers. Q. How does the processing arrangement with Wigmore work? A. We receive information from Wigmore in two forms; one form is source documents. These consist of customer orders and return authori? zations. When a customer sends in an order to Wigmore, a copy of that order is forwarded to us. When Wigmore authorizes return of goods, Wigmore sends us a copy of the return authorization. The second form of information is teletyped data that goes directly into our computer. The information received via teletype terminal is all payment informa? tion and all information for processing what Wigmore calls "expedited orders." Q. Where is the teletype terminal located? A. At Wigmore's place of business. Q. Who operates the teletype terminal? A. Employees of Wigmore, I don't know their names. Q. Once Service Bureau has received source documents from Wig? more what is done with them? A. The source documents go to our keypunching department at Service Bureau. The keypunch operator punches cards containing information from the orders or the return authorizations in a predetermined format. The source documents, that is the orders and the return authorizations, along with the punched cards, are then sent to our verifying depart? ment. The verifying department has machines which are very similar to keypunch machines except that the machines do not punch any cards. The punched cards and the source documents are given to the operator. The operator takes the punched cards, puts them into the verifying machine, takes each source document and again proceeds to enter the information from the source document in the same sequence as the key punch operator. The machine verifies that the information the second operator is entering agrees with the information entered by the first operator. This is called verification. The punched cards are then given to computer operations for processing. An operator will take the punched cards, load the appropriate programs for processing the cards, read the cards into the computer and the computer processes the infor? mation, updating the records which we maintain for Wigmore on mag? netic disks. The computer also prints out invoices, picking lists and shipping documents for each order. Q. What records do you maintain for Wigmore on the magnetic disks? A. We maintain all the information in connection with their accounts receivables. Q. Is the information from the cards the only information processed by you? SPRING 1975 227</page><page sequence="23">A. No. Q. What other information is processed? A. Wigmore has the on-line hook-up for its teletype machine, which permits Wigmore to dial up our computer and enter information direct? ly into the computer through the teletype terminal. That information is stored on a disk pack and, periodically throughout the day, that information will be processed by the computer using the programs necessary to process Wigmore's data. Whenever the information is pro? cessed during the day the computer generates information for the pick? ing lists and shipping instructions which are in turn transmitted back to Wigmore and printed via the teletype terminal. Those runs also generate invoice information which is combined with the invoice infor? mation generated from the daily processing of the cards and each night invoices are generated for Wigmore customers. The next day those invoices are sent out by Service Bureau to Wigmore customers. Q. Is any other information transmitted to Service Bureau by Wig? more via the teletype? A. Yes. Q. And what information is that? A. Information regarding payments on account by Wigmore custom? ers. Q. And what happens to that information? A. It is stored on a disk pack and each night it is processed as a part of the processing done for Wigmore. The balances due from the custom? er are up-dated along with the payment record for the customer to reflect the payments received via the teletype the previous day. Q. Are there any other outputs produced by Service Bureau for Wig? more on a daily basis? A. Yes. Q. What are they? A. From each nighfs processing there is generated the picking lists which are to be used by Wigmore in filling orders received the previous day. There is also generated the necessary shipping documents for the shipment of the order to the Wigmore customer. The picking lists and shipping documents are delivered by messenger to Wigmore first thing every day. At night the same messenger returns to Wigmore to pick up the source documents which are to be keypunched and processed that night. 3. Procedures Employed to Assure Accuracy, Reliability and Freedom from Tampering Q. Are all the records that you keep for Wigmore maintained solely on a disk pack? A. No. Q. How else are they maintained? 228 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="24">A. All the cards that are keypunched and processed by Service Bureau on a daily basis are stored in card files at Service Bureau and retained for a specified period of time. In addition all of the information received via teletype is at some point during the processing punched into cards and these cards are stored along with cards punched by Service Bureau keypunchers as a part of the back-up for the processing done. In addi? tion, periodically, every six or eight months, the inactive data on the disk packs is dumped onto magnetic tapes for permanent storage. Q. When you say inactive data, what do you mean? A. The data relating to the details of any orders which have already been processed and paid for will be removed from the disk pack and dumped onto magnetic tapes. Q. Is there any other information dumped on the tape? A. Yes, there is. Q. What other information? A. All of the information contained on the disk pack at the time of the dump will be put onto the magnetic tape. However, only the active data will remain on the disk pack. This is a process we call purging. It simply means that we take the inactive data off of the disk pack after it is stored on the tape. Q. Does Service Bureau keep the disk packs and the tapes? A. Yes. One other point I forgot to mention with regard to the records kept for Wigmore is that, on a daily basis, Service Bureau dumps all of its disk packs onto tape for back-up use should information on the disk packs be accidentally destroyed. Q. Is this the same dump you spoke of previously with respect to Wigmore data? A. No, this is a general dump, on a daily basis, of all disk packs for all customers that are active in on-line systems at Service Bureau. Q. You indicated that the tape dumps which you prepared for Wig? more data were also used as back-up. Can you explain what you meant? A. Yes. If information on a disk pack is accidentally destroyed, the first back-up will be the daily dumps onto magnetic tape which Service Bureau maintains for all information contained in files that are on? line. Should this first back-up tape contain an error or for some reason be unavailable or incapable of being processed, it would be necessary to recreate all customer's files. To recreate Wigmore's files, we would take the last tape dump of the Wigmore data, reload it on the disk pack and process all of the punched cards reflecting transactions that have occurred subsequent to the tape dump. This would recreate the file in the form in which it existed immediately before the information was destroyed. Q. So then, if I understand what you are saying, the tape dumps of the Wigmore files contain only the information regarding Wigmore and is used only as a second back-up to the disk packs? A. That is correct. SPRING 1975 229</page><page sequence="25">Q. What happens to the disk packs and the tapes with the Wigmore information on them? A. When the Wigmore disk packs are not on-line they are stored in our tape library. When the tapes are prepared they are likewise stored in our tape library. Q. Can you explain what a tape library is? A. Yes, it is a specially prepared room which is fireproof and furnished with special environmental equipment to control humidity and main? tain appropriate temperatures. It is equipped with racks in which tapes and disk packs are stored. When a tape or disk pack is sent to the library, it is logged in; that is, the library log sheets for that particular customer are up-dated to reflect the status of the file. If it is a new file, a new entry is made. If it is an old file, an indication is made that it has now been returned to the library. The disk pack or the tape is then placed in the library in a predetermined location specified by the log sheet. When the tapes or the disk packs are taken out of the library, an indication is made on the log sheet that they have been removed, who removed them and where they are presently located. Q. Can you tell us where the library is located at Service Bureau? A. The entryway to the tape library is right off the lobby of our recep? tion area. Q. Is the tape library equipped with a lock? A. The tape library is equipped with a vault door which contains a combination lock. Q. To whom is the combination for the lock given? A. To all employees of Service Bureau. Q. You indicate that the keypunching done by Service Bureau is verified, is that one hundred percent verification? A. Yes. Q. Is there any verification of the transmitted input by Service Bu? reau? A. No, there is not verification as such. The computer programs which are used to process Wigmore data have certain editing procedures which are employed on all data. The transmitted information is subjected to these edit procedures. Q. And what function do the edit procedures perform? A. The edit procedures assure that input data conforms to certain specified conditions. For instance, the procedures make sure that the right number of digits are present in a particular field of information. In some cases, they verify that the information does not exceed certain maximum and minimum limits. They also check information to make sure that where it is numerical or alphabetical, all information entered is correspondingly numerical or alphabetical. The edit procedure also makes sure that the account numbers are valid, existing account num? bers. This is done by checking the account master against each entry to verify that there is an account number in the account master for that particular transaction. 230 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="26">Exhibit "A" Page One WIGMORE WIDGET COMPANY Monthly Sales-1971 Gross Sales Returns Payments Total Sales Month Quantity Dollars (Units) ($) ($) JANUARY 340,000 170,000 FEBRUARY 330,000 165,000 MARCH 344,000 172,000 APRIL 350,000 175,000 MAY 340,000 170,000 JUNE 315,000 157,500 JULY 300,000 150,000 AUGUST 300,000 150,000 SEPTEMBER 405,000 202,500 OCTOBER 375,000 187,500 NOVEMBER 375,000 187,500 DECEMBER 260,000 130,000 10,000 165,000 165,000 4,000 163,000 163,000 0 172,000 172,000 5,000 172,500 172,500 0 170,000 170,000 0 157,500 157,500 0 150,000 150,000 0 150,000 150,000 5,000 200,000 200,000 0 187,500 187,500 0 187,500 187,500 10,000 125,000 125,000 TOTAL 4,034,000 2,017,000 34,000 2,000,000 2,000,000 GO to</page><page sequence="27">to to a ? w H 2 o O C 5? &gt; r Exhibit "A" Page Two WIGMORE WIDGET COMPANY Monthly Sales-1972 Gross Sales Month Quantity Dollars Returns (Units) Payments ($) Total Sales ($) JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER 345,000 426,000 349,000 455,000 410,000 305,000 319,000 305,000 410,000 470,000 375,000 256,000 172,500 213,000 174,500 227,500 205,000 152,500 159,500 152,500 205,000 235,000 187,500 128,000 0 5,000 5,000 4,000 1,000 0 4,000 0 1,000 4,000 1,000 0 172,500 210,500 172,000 225,500 204,500 152,500 157,500 152,500 204,500 233,000 187,000 128,000 172,500 210,500 172,000 225,500 204,500 152,500 157,500 152,500 204,500 233,000 187,000 128,000 TOTAL 4,425,000 2,211,500 25,000 2,200,000 2,200,000</page><page sequence="28">Exhibit "A" Page Three WIGMORE WIDGET COMPANY Monthly Sales-1973 Gross Sales Month Quantity Dollars Returns (Units) Payments ($) Total Sales ($) JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER 495,000 566,000 499,000 555,000 560,000 490,000 319,000 355,000 460,000 566,000 0 0 247,500 283,000 249,500 277,500 280,000 245,000 159,500 177,500 230,000 283,000 0 0 0 5,000 5,000 4,000 1,000 0 4,000 0 1,000 5,000 0 0 247,500 280,500 247,000 275,500 279,500 245,000 157,500 177,500 229,500 280,500 0 0 247,500 280,500 247,000 275,500 279,500 245,000 157,500 177,500 229,500 280,500 0 0 TOTAL 4,865,000 2,432,500 25,000 2,420,000 2,420,000 o to</page><page sequence="29">Exhibit "A" Page Four WIGMORE WIDGET COMPANY Monthly Sales-1974 Gross Sales Month Quantity Dollars Returns (Units) Payments ($) Total Sales ($) JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER 0 0 220,000 215,000 225,000 190,000 150,000 215,000 220,000 220,000 225,000 205,000 0 0 110,000 107,500 112,500 95,000 75,000 107,500 110,000 110,000 112,500 102,500 0 0 20,000 15,000 15,000 5,000 0 5,000 0 15,000 10,000 5,000 0 0 100,000 90,000* 105,000 90,000* 70,000* 105,000 110,000 102,500 107,500 100,000 0 0 100,000 100,000 105,000 92,500 75,000 105,000 110,000 102,500 107,500 100,000 TOTAL 2,085,000 1,042,500 90,000 *Difference in unit sales and receipts was bad debts from failing customers. 980,000 980,000 CO c H o oo O c &gt; r</page><page sequence="30">Exhibit "B" WIGMORE WIDGET COMPANY TABLE OF PROFITABILITY Direct Indirect Admin, and Labor Labor Material Overhead Sales Cost Cost Cost Cost Cost Profit 1400 $112,000 $ 28,000 $140,000 $400,000 $ 70,000 $ (50,000) 1800 144,000 36,000 .180,000 400,000 90,000 50,000 2200 176,000 44,000 220,000 400,000 110,000 150,000 2400 192,000 48,000 240,000 400,000 120,000 200,000 2800 224,000 56,000 280,000 400,000 140,000 300,000 3200 256,000 64,000 320,000 400,000 160,000 400,000 3600 288,000 72,000 360,000 400,000 180,000 500,000 4000 320,000 80,000 400,000 400,000 200,000 600,000 4400 352,000 88,000 440,000 400,000 220,000 700,000 4800 384,000 96,000 480,000 450,000 240,000 750,000 5200 416,000 104,000 520,000 450,000 260,000 850,000 5600 448,000 112,000 560,000 450,000 280,000 950,000 6000 480,000 120,000 600,000 500,000 300,000 1,000,000 GO o to</page><page sequence="31">Q. Mr. Jones, I show you a document that has been marked as plain? tiffs Exhibit "A" and ask you if you can identify that document. A. Yes. Q. Would you tell us what that document is? A. The document is the monthly sales for Wigmore Widget Company for the years 1971, 72, 73, and '74. Q. Do you know who prepared Exhibit "A"? A. Service Bureau. Q. Do you know how Exhibit "A" was prepared? A. Yes, I do. Q. How do you know? A. / was in charge of preparing it. Q. Would you tell us how it was prepared? A. Exhibit "A" is a computer print-out which contains all of the sales information for the Wigmore Widget Company for the last four years. It was generated by the computer utilizing a program which I wrote for the purpose of preparing Exhibit "A." The program processed the order detail information contained on the tape dumps of Wigmore files for the last four years. Q. You say you wrote the program to prepare Exhibit "A"? A. Yes, I did. Q. Did someone request you to write the program? A. Yes. Q. Who? A. Wigmore's president. Q. Can you tell us what the program does? A. Yes. The program reads the tapes which contain the details of all the orders received by Wigmore. The program then selects from the detailed information the quantity of widgets ordered and the dollar amount for each order. It also selects information regarding any return of widgets, and information regarding payments. It then totals all of this informa? tion to produce the gross sales, both the quantity and the dollar amounts, the number of returned units, the total payments made for orders received in each of the months, and it computes the total sales by subtracting returns from gross sales. Q. Can you tell us how you went about writing the program? A. I took programming code sheets and wrote the various instructions necessary for locating and manipulating the required data. The code sheet contents were then keypunched and sent to the computer for a process called assembling. When the computer assembles a program it takes the instructions written by the programmer and converts them into symbols which are understood by the computer. The assembly process results in what is commonly called an object deck. The object deck is normally a group of punched cards prepared by the computer which contain the symbols necessary for the computer to perform vari? ous operations. At the same time as the assembly, a listing is prepared of the source deck, that is, the deck containing the instructions written 236 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="32">by the programmer, as well as the object deck, that is, the deck prepared by the computer. Q. Now once the program was assembled, what happened? A. Well, I had selected a series of transactions from the tapes contain? ing the Wigmore files to prepare what is known as test data. I created the test data by taking samples of various records contained on the Wigmore tape dumps. At the time I selected these records I performed the calculations necessary to get the results manually. My manual calculations were rechecked by another person to verify their accuracy. I then took the test data and processed it with the computer program to generate a test output. I then compared the totals on the test output to the totals that had been achieved manually to verify that they were identical. Once this was done I determined that the program functioned accurately. I then instructed the computer room to process all the Wigmore tape dumps for the years 1971, "72, 73 and "74 using the program I had written. The operator took the tapes and my program, processed the tapes using my program and generated Exhibit "A." Q. Now, am I correct, Mr. Jones, in believing that there is no way a human being can visually review a magnetic tape and determine the information contained on it? A. That is correct. Q. Is there some way of determining what information is contained on a tape? A. Yes, there is. Q. How is that? A. There is a program which is provided by the computer company that is called TAPEPRINT. Using that program and running the tape through the computer, the computer prints out all of the information that is contained on the tape. Q. I show you a document which has been marked as plaintiffs Exhib? it "C" and ask you if you can tell me what that is. A. That is a tapeprint of one of the records contained on the Wigmore tape dumps. Q. Now, is there some way you can determine by looking at this tapeprint what information is contained on the magnetic tape regard? ing Wigmore's accounts receivable? A. Yes, there is. Q. And how is that done? A. In the documentation of the accounts receivable programs used for Wigmore there is prepared a document entitled a Record Format. The Record Format is a narrative of the information contained on the tape and specifies not only the type of information contained on the tape but where it is contained within any specified record. Exhibit "C" is a series of records which is in fact contained in a single block of records which are written on one of the Wigmore tape dumps. Q. I show you plaintiffs Exhibit "F" and ask you if you can identify that? SPRING 1975 237</page><page sequence="33">A. It 's the Record Format for the Wigmore accounts receivable records. Q. Do you know who prepared it? A. Yes, I prepared it. Q. When was it prepared? A. It was prepared when I documented the accounts receivable pro? grams which process the Wigmore accounts. Q. I show you plaintiffs Exhibit "D" and ask you if you can identify that document? A. Yes. Q. What is it? A. That's a Record Layout of the Wigmore accounts receivable record. Q. What is a Record Layout? A. It is a graphic illustration of the information contained on the record. Q. Now, can you take the information there and translate the blob of numerical and alphabetical information contained in Exhibit "C"? A. Yes, you can. If you will note in Exhibit "D" the type ofinformation is identified for each section of the record. A Record Overlay can be prepared which, when laid on a tapeprint, clearly identifies the informa? tion. Q. I show you plaintiffs Exhibit "E" and ask you if you can identify that document? A. Yes, that's a Record Overlay. Q. Do you know who prepared it? A. I did. Q. Would you take the Overlay and go through the first record on the tape print telling us the subject matter of the information as well as what the information says? A. Yes. (Goes through the first and second line of the first record.) 5. Other Uses Made of the Tapes which Were Used As Inputs to the Special Programs Q. To your knowledge, are the Wigmore tape dumps used for any other purpose other than those which you have described? A. Yes. From time to time we generate miscellaneous reports requested by Wigmore. These normally have something to do with sales or pay? ments or things of that nature. In addition, we generate a report annu? ally which contains the sales figures for the year. This is done by processing the tape dumps. Those reports also contain various other statistics such as the number of orders as well as a breakdown of the number of orders by customer. And, as I indicated before, the tape dumps are also prepared as a second back-up to the disk packs. To my knowledge they have never been used for that. The tapes are also kept for Internal Revenue purposes. 238 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="34">Q. Now, you indicate that you wrote the special program to prepare Exhibit "A," is that correct? A. Yes. Q. Did you employ the normal procedures of the Service Bureau in writing the special program? A. Yes, I followed normal procedures for writing any program. The only departure from normal procedures is that the programs that I wrote to prepare both Exhibits "A" and "B" are not as extensively documented as they would be if they became permanent programs because they are special programs to be used only one time. Q. Can you tell us how you prepared Exhibit "B"? A. Yes. I received from Wigmore the direct labor cost incurred by Wigmore in the manufacturing of a widget, as well as the indirect labor cost, the material cost and the sales cost. Wigmore also gave me the administrative and overhead costs for producing widgets at various levels of production. I then prepared a program which took that infor? mation as well as the information regarding pricing of Wigmore widg? ets which was already contained in our files and wrote a program which produced Exhibit "B." Q. Did you utilize any of the information contained on the Wigmore tape dumps in the production of Exhibit "B"? A. No. The only information I used from any of the files we maintain for Wigmore was the pricing information which I took from Wigmore customer invoices. The program did nothing more than make the calcu? lations for the various quantities of output and print out the informa? tion, as well as computing the profit or loss based on the total costs subtracted from the total sales. By MR. FENWICK Your Honor, I move the admission of Exhibits A &amp; B. VII. Cross-Examination of Authenticating Witness By MR. McGONIGAL Your Honor, I object on the grounds that the Exhibits are hearsay and violate the Best Evidentiary Rule. I would like to cross-examine Mr. Jones to establish further the factual basis for the objection. THE COURT: Proceed. Q. Mr. Jones, what information do you have regarding Wigmore's accounting practices? A. I don't have any information other than the processing that we provide for them. Q. Have you ever seen any of Wigmore's books and records? A. No. Other than the copies of the orders we receive and the records we generate. Q. Do you ever communicate with any of Wigmore's customers re? garding their orders? A. No. SPRING 1975 239</page><page sequence="35">Q. Do you ever receive any documents from Wigmore's customers? A. Do you mean other than copies of the orders which are sent over by Wigmore? Q. Yes. A. No. Q. Do you have any relationship with Wigmore other than as Service Bureau's account manager? A. No. Q. Then the only knowledge you have regards the keypunching and processing of the order information and returning the results of that processing to Wigmore, is that correct? A. Yes. Q. Isn't it true that you never see any documents regarding payments by Wigmore customers? A. That is correct. Q. Do you ever receive any documents or have any other source of knowledge that in fact the goods reflected in the orders you process are sent? A. There is information transmitted via the teletype regarding pay? ments received by Wigmore. Q. Do you see that information? A. No. Q. Do you see any documents from Wigmore customers indicating they have paid their accounts? A. No. Q. With regard to expedited orders do you see any documents from Wigmore or Wigmore's customers concerning those orders? A. No. Q. In fact there is no verification by Service Bureau of the expedited order information, is that correct? A. We do not verify the expedited order information other than the edits that are performed by the computer programs. Q. Do you see any information with regard to expedited orders from any source? A. We generate invoices for expedited orders. Q. But are those identified in any way so that you can determine that the invoices relate to expedited orders? A. No. Q. In fact, you do not even see the picking lists and shipping instruc? tions for expedited orders, is that correct? A. That's correct. Q. Have there ever been errors in processing the Wigmore accounts receivable? A. Yes, I am sure there have been. Q. Do you have any recollection of specific errors made in the pro? cessing of Wigmore accounts receivables? 240 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="36">A. Yes, there have been seven or eight occasions when we have had to reprocess a day's orders in order to correct errors. Q. How did you discover the errors? A. With the exception of one occasion in which an operator, while removing invoices from the printer, noticed the control totals appeared unrealistic, we were notified by Wigmore of problems which eventually resulted in reprocessing. Q. You indicate there are control totals on the invoice runs. Do you do anything with those control totals? A. No, other than sending them to Wigmore along with the picking lists and shipping documents. Q. With regard to the special programs that you have written that produced Exhibits "A" and "B," is it correct that reports similar to Exhibits "A" and "B" are not produced normally for Wigmore? A. That is correct. Q. You indicated that you did not follow your standard documenta? tion procedure in documenting the programs that prepared Exhibits "A" and "B." Is that correct? A. Yes. Q. What is the function of the documentation of a program? A. The documentation provides an explanation of what the program does and how it does it. It makes it much easier to modify the program. It is also used extensively in correcting bugs in the program. Q. What is a bug? A. That is where the program has not functioned properly. Q. Regarding the testing of the special program you wrote, would it be accurate to say that your test data did not include examples of all types of input that were contained on the Wigmore tape dumps? A. What do you mean by examples of input? Q. I mean that they did not contain all of the input conditions that would be encountered when the programs processed the Wigmore tape dumps. A. I think that is probably accurate. However, an attempt was made to include examples of all input conditions which it can be anticipated will cause a problem or will have a different impact on the processing. That is a part of the designing of the test data. Q. Do you have any doubt that there were input conditions that existed in the Wigmore tape dump which were not included in the test data? A. I do not know whether there were or not. Q. In your experience, does the test data normally contain all of the conditions which exist in the information to be processed? A. No. Q. When were these exhibits prepared? A. They were prepared on the date contained on the top of each exhibit, which is February 4, 1975. SPRING 1975 241</page><page sequence="37">Q. When were the magnetic tapes prepared? A. The dates the tapes were prepared are contained on the labels. They vary. Q. Now, you indicated that the dumps are made every six or eight months. Is that correct? A. Yes. Q. Therefore, in the case of some of the information being dumped it is being written on the tape eight or nine months after the orders for widgets were received? A. That would probably be correct for some of the information. Q. Now, regarding the tape library, is it not true that all Service Bureau employees have access to the tape library? A. That is correct. Q. Do all of the employees of Service Bureau perform some function related to Wigmore? A. No. Q. How many employees does Service Bureau have? A. Approximately eighty. Q. How many employees of Service Bureau perform any function relating to Wigmore? A. Including keypunch operators, I would say twelve to fourteen. Q. Now, regarding the other exhibits that have been marked here, the tape print, the Record Layout, the Record Format and the Overlay, were they prepared specifically for this litigation? A. No. Q. When were they prepared? A. I am not sure of the exact date but they would have been prepared as part of the documentation of the accounts receivable programs for Wigmore. Q. Are those kept at Service Bureau? A. Yes, they are. They are also made available to employees of Wig? more. Q. Are those documents made available to all employees of Service Bureau? A. Yes, they are. Q. Does Service Bureau employ any security system to insure that only employees are on the premises? A. Well, an attempt is made to make sure people who are not employees of Service Bureau or clients of Service Bureau do not go into the computer room. However, Service Bureau is a business and the recep? tion area of Service Bureau is of course open to the public. Q. Does Service Bureau employ any means of special identification of persons having access to the computer room? A. If by special identification you mean are there identification cards or that sort of thing, the answer is no. There is a door that separates the computer room from the rest of Service Bureau's facilities, and it 242 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="38">contains a sign that specifies that only authorized personnel are permit? ted in the computer room. Other than that we rely on personal recogni? tion by employees. Q. Where is the tape library located with regard to the reception area? A. The door to the tape library is on the side of the reception room. Q. Is that door kept locked at all times? A. No. Q. Is there a security guard on the tape library? A. No. Q. Do you maintain a log of people coming in and out of the computer room? A. No. Q. What about the tape library? A. No. Q. Does Service Bureau perform any types of security checks on its employees? A. Not to my knowledge. Q. Now, regarding the programs that generate the original records on the disk packs for the Wigmore accounts receivable processing, do you have listings of those programs in Court today? A. No, I do not. Q. Do you know who wrote those programs? A. Yes, I did. Q. Do you know if any changes have been made in those programs since they were written? A. Yes. Q. Have any changes been made? A. Yes. Q. Do you know who made those changes? A. Yes. Q. And who made them? A. / did. Q. The testimony you gave today as to the testing of programs and the specific functions performed by programs, did that relate only to the programs for the preparation of Exhibits "A" and "B"? A. That is correct. Q. Would it be accurate to say that the records contained on the magnetic tapes are copies of the records contained on the disk packs? A. Yes. Q. And is it not true that it is the records on the disk packs which are used in the accounts payable processing? A. That is correct. Q. Now, when these records are dumped from the disk pack onto the tapes, is any attempt made to verify that the dumps are accurate? A. No. Not any other than hardware checks. SPRING 1975 243</page><page sequence="39">Q. What are hardware checks? A. The tape drives have built into them the ability to sense that a tape is damaged and should not be written on. Q. Is there a method by which you could verify that the dumps are accurate duplicates of the information on the disk? A. Yes, there is a computer program which will verify that. Q. And do you use that program when the dumps are made? A. No, we do not. Q. And why is that? A. It would simply add to the cost of processing and the tapes are not used for the accounts receivable processing except in a situation where they might be used as a back-up. Basically, it's a cost trade-off. Q. Did you write the programs that dump the disk packs onto the tapes? A. I did not. Q. Do you know who did? A. Those programs come with the computer and are written by, I assume, employees of the computer manufacturer. I don't know. Q. Do you have listings of the programs that dump the records onto the tapes? A. / do not. I assume I could get them if I wanted them, but the programs are not very complicated. Q. Did you have anything to do with the design of that program? A. I did not. Q. Have you ever had occasion to compare the dumps with the infor? mation on the disk? A. I have not. Q. Did you run the programs that originally put the accounts receiva? ble information on the disk pack for Wigmore's accounts receivable? A. No, I do not operate the computers under normal circumstances. Q. Do you know who did operate the computers? A. It would have been one of our operators. Q. Do you know which operator? A. I do not personally know. I believe from a review of the log sheets we could determine, but it might be any one of fifteen people. Q. Do you know whether or not any processing errors were incurred during the processing? A. I assume that none occurred that weren't corrected. Q. But do you know whether any occurred that weren't corrected? A. I do not know for sure. Q. Do you know who operated the programs that dumped the infor? mation onto the tapes? A. I do not. Q. Do you know if they incurred any processing errors? A. I do not, but we have a procedure where, if processing errors are incurred, certain steps are to be taken. 244 JURIMETRICS JOURNAL</page><page sequence="40">Q. But you don't have personal knowledge of whether any processing errors occurred? A. That is correct Q. Now, Mr. Jones, would it be possible to print out all the informa? tion on the magnetic tapes that were used to produce Exhibits "A" and "B"? A. Yes, it would be. Q. Do you have any idea of what size the print-out would be? A. I couldn't be sure, but I would imagine that since seven of those tapes are completely occupied the print-out would be quite huge. Q. How huge? A. It might be thirty or forty feet high. Q. Getting back to the security of Service Bureau's premises, have you ever had any break-ins? A. Yes, we have had. Q. How many? A. One that I can recall. Q. When was that? A. Approximately two years ago. Q. Was anything taken? A. We were unable to determine if anything was in fact taken. Q. Was any damage done? A. Yes. Q. What was done? A. A number of the reels of tape that were in the library were taken from the library and unwound, strewing the tape throughout the recep? tion area. Q. Were any of Wigmore's tapes unwound? A. No, they were not. Q. What did you do to replace the tapes? A. In the case of the tapes that were active customer files, various procedures were followed to recreate them. Q. Did you recreate all of the tapes? A. We did not. Q. Why not? A.
