The major excavations at Bet Shean (Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine Scythopolis; Islamic Baysan), which began in 1980-81 and were renewed on a larger scale in 1986, have been carried out by teams of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA). The final reports will be published both in the Hebrew University's series of Qedem Reports and in the series of the IAA Reports. The volumes will retain the format and style of each series. However, in order to prevent confusion and facilitate the use of the reports, the directors of the teams of the two institutions have agreed to publish the final reports as a joint enterprise, numbered as a single series. Thus the present volume in the Hebrew University's Qedem Reports series (Bet Shean 1) may be followed by Bet Shean 2 in the series of the IAA Reports. The order of the volumes will be dictated by the date of their publication. The first excavations at Bet Shean were carried out in 1921-1933 by excavators of the University of Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Museum, C. Fisher, A. Rowe and G. M. Fitzgerald. Many smaller excavations have been conducted in Bet Shean and its close vicinity, and random discoveries have been made. The history of archaeological research at Bet Shean will be fully presented in one of the future volumes; we will mention here only the name of N. Zori, who collected an enormous amount of information in the 1950s and 1960s, when modern Bet Shean was built and expanded, and conducted several important excavations. Excavations carried out in the late 1950s and early 1960s were initiated and financed in order to make Bet Shean into a center of tourism. They were successively directed by S. Applebaum, A. Ovadiah and A. Negev. The major project of excavations at Bet Shean began in 1980-1981, when G. Foerster and Y. Tsafnr were invited to excavate the open area on the plateau south of the main built-up part of the town. G. Foerster was at that time working in the Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums (later the IAA) while also lecturing at the Hebrew University; Y. Tsafnr was a member of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University. The excavation was carried out on behalf of the Hebrew University and the Department of Antiquities and Museums. It was initiated and supported by the Israeli government and the Municipal Council of Bet Shean. In this short-term project the amphitheater (Area B) was discovered and partially excavated, as was the basalt-paved street abutting the amphitheater on the north (Areas B and C). At the same time another area was excavated in the city center, near the central columnar monument (which was wrongly identified then as a nymphaeum) and at the foot of the monolithic column in Valley Street, opposite the central columnar monument.* Consequently, an initial program of excava- tion, restoration and preparation of the site for tourism was proposed by the Israel Government Tourism Corporation, though this initiative was not realized until 1986. In 1986 a new series of large-scale excavations started, which lasted until the end of 1996. The area was divided between two expeditions: one on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University, headed by G. Foerster and Y. Tsafnr, and the second on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority headed by Gaby Mazor and Rachel Bar-Nathan. Both excavations took place in the city center, between the theater and the slopes of Tel Bet Shean. The Hebrew University concentrated on areas close to the tel on its west, southwest and south (Areas E and G) as well as the southern suburbs near the amphitheater (Areas B and C). The IAA expedition excavated the western parts of the city center, areas east of the tel including Jisr el-Maktu'a ("the cut-off bridge") and the northeastern city gate, areas north of Nahal Harod in Tel Iztaba, and the western city gate. During that period another expedition of the Hebrew University, headed by Amihai Mazar, renewed the ex- cavations on Tel Bet Shean during several seasons, uncovering mainly Bronze Age and Iron Age levels. The Crusader fortress east of the amphitheater was excavated by the IAA; the excavation was directed by Ruth Gertwagen and Adrian Boas and later by Jon Seligman. Excavation on * The excavation team consisted of students of the Institute of Archaeology, laborers from Bet Shean and volunteers. Ehud Netzer and Bianca Lepori acted as surveyors and Zev Radovan took the photographs. See G. Foerster and Y. Tsafnr, Hadashot Arkheolo- giyot 77 (1981), pp. 8-9 (Hebrew); also, with photographs, Y.

VI</page><page sequence="4">a smaller scale was carried out on the plateau south of the theater, where a bathhouse and large pool were unearthed on behalf of the IAA, directed by Michal Peleg (1986-87) and Fanny Vitto (1988). Over the years several other excava- tions were conducted in the close vicinity of our excavation on behalf of the IAA; the most extensive of these were directed by Danny Syon (south of the Turkish Serai) and Ofer Syon (east of the Tiberias road). The results of these excavations, as well as some smaller ones, were generously shared with us and helped us to understand the ancient topography and the expansion of the city over time. The large-scale excavations were conducted during eleven long seasons (usually six months per year, and even longer in the first years). Excavation was carried out manually, with judicious use of mechanic tools for the upper layers of sterile alluvium. The use of a crane mounted on a rubber-wheeled tractor enabled us to remove the soil and stones from the excavated areas in large bags used for packing industrial material (this method, which has become common in many excavations in Israel, was initiated at Bet Shean). The mechanical removal of soil and heavy stones from deep excavated areas freed the entire workforce for excavation proper, permitting careful digging to be carried out at a relatively rapid pace. In recent years maps and plans of the entire site and plans of the excavated loci have been computerized under the supervision of Benny Arubas. At the end of 1996 the pace of the field work slowed down significantly. Only a small team of laborers continued to work in certain areas, supervised especially by Menahem Arazi and Benny Arubas. This team accompanied the reconstruction and preparation of the site for tourism, while enabling us to complete the excavation of partially excavated areas and reexamine some of our initial hypotheses. The. Bet Shean project was mainly financed by the Ministry of Tourism and was part of a comprehensive development program headed by the Israel Government Tourism Corporation, the National Parks Authority, the Bet Shean Municipality, the Jewish National Fund and the Israel Antiquities Authority (formerly the Department of Antiqui- ties and Museums of the Ministry of Education). The everyday management of the entire project was undertaken by the Bet Shean Tourism Administration, directed successively by David Tzifroni, Israel Ramot and for most of the period of the excavations by Ruth Oren. We owe many thanks to these organizations and their staff, whom we cannot mention individually. The excavations were carried out in laige part by laborers from Bet Shean and volunteers from Israel and abroad. Many archaeologists participated in the work as area supervisors and in other capacities, some for short terms and others for longer ones. Only those who participated in at least one full season are mentioned here. The names appear in alphabetical order: Daniel Abu-Hatzera (area supervisor), Shoshana Agady (ceramic analysis and area supervisor), Nitzan Amitai-Preiss (numismatics), Menahem Arazi (area supervisor), Yoav Arbel (area supervisor), Benny Arubas (surveyor and stratigrapher), Rina Avner (area supervisor), Ephrat Assaf (area supervisor), Miriam Avissar (ceramic analysis), Adrian Boas (area supervisor), Orna Cohen (conservation), Waheb Daud (area supervisor), Anna De Vincenz (area supervisor), Michael Drewes (drawing and analysis of architectural elements), Haim Goldfus (area supervisor), Shulamit Hadad (ceramic and glass analysis and area supervisor), Avi Harash (area supervisor and computers), Jacob Janai (area supervisor and numismatics), Elias Khamis (registration, metal objects and Arabic epigraphy), Yeshayahu Lender (area supervisor), Ori Moran (area supervisor), Shira Nahari (area supervisor), Nassim Najjar (area supervisor), Oded Ron (area supervisor), David Sapo (area supervisor), Gideon Shelach (area supervisor), Giora Solar (architectural consultant), Aaron Sugar (area supervisor), Yitzhak Vitelson (area supervisor). Further assistance was provided by Leah Di Segni (epigraphy), Michal Manor (archaeozoology) and Matthew Ponting (metallurgy). Daniel Ben Meir and Uri Epstein assisted as volunteers in metal detecting. Gabi Laron was the photographer during most of the seasons, assisted by Vladimir Naikhin; Ilan Sztulman and Zev Radovan were photographers in some of the earlier seasons. Lilia Kirillov, Liora Maniewitz, Sarah Halbreich, Mika Sarig and Carmen Hersch made the drawings. Micha Bar-On, Benny Sekay and Frida Lederman of the Institute of Archaeology assisted in administrative matters. Sue Gorodetsky advised us on the preparation of manuscripts and edited this volume. Our thanks to all of them. We cannot mention by name the numerous volunteers, loyal workers, friends and colleagues, short-term area supervisors, assistants and consultants, though without their work the project could not have been accomplished. We are grateful to all of them. Our core staff, scholars and friends, are Shoshana Agady, Menahem Arazi, Benny Arubas, Shulamit Hadad, Elias Khamis and Gabi Laron. They are still working in the field and on the preparation of the final publications. Without their skills and dedication we would never have reached the stage of publication of our final reports. We are most grateful for the generosity of the Beracha Foundation and the Yad Hanadiv Foundation, which enabled the preparation of this volume. Gideon Foerster and Yoram Tsafrir Jerusalem, December 2001 VII</page><page sequence="5">To my parents, Raphael and Gisela Hadad</page><page sequence="6">PREFACE Fifty-one local clay lamp types (a total of 344 complete lamps and many other almost complete and fragmentary lamps), ten imported clay lamp types, three bronze lamps, two bronze lids and one bronze lampstand are presented in this study. In addition to the lamps, molds and lanterns are presented. All the finds studied here derive from the excavations of the Hebrew University expedition to Bet Shean headed by G. Foerster and Y. Tsafrir. Many of them have been described in my M.A. dissertation (Hadad 1992), which was the first study of the lamps from Bet Shean, and in three articles (Hadad 1997 and 1999; Hadad and Khamis 1998). The present study constitutes the full publication of the lamps, molds and lanterns found by the expedition. The items illustrated here and included in the catalogue are representative examples of the various types; the text and Table 1 give total numbers of finds for the various types. Except where indicated otherwise, all finds are illustrated at about three quarters of their actual size. ' The. importance of this assemblage lies first and foremost in its having been found in an archaeological excavation, allowing most of the lamps to be dated on the basis of the contexts in which they were found. Some of the types have been discovered only at Bet Shean, and lack parallels at other sites in Palestine or neighboring countries. The lamps are arranged on a typological basis and are presented in chronological order. Since the Hellenistic city of Scythop- olis (see Introduction) was located on Tel Bet Shean and Tel Iztaba, which were not excavated by the Hebrew University team, the four Hellenistic local and imported lamp types should be considered chance finds. Moreover, only a few of the local lamps of the early Roman period (Types 3-12) can be dated on the basis of the contexts in which they were found. However, almost all the other lamps, from the late Roman through Mamluk periods, can be dated by their contexts. The final chapter is dedicated to examining the connections between lamp finds from Bet Shean and different regions in Palestine, and the connections with the neighboring countries of Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. I am most grateful to Gideon Foerster and Yoram Tsafrir, with whose assistance this study was written, and to Dan Barag, who supervised my M.A. dissertation. Drawings of the lamps are by Lilia Kirillov, Mika Sarig, Liora Manievitz and Carmen Hersch. The Kufic and Naskhi inscriptions of the lamps were read and translated by Elias Khamis. The plans were made by Benny Arubas. Shoshana Agady assisted in all matters connected with the database of the excavation in all its seasons. The pottery was dated by Miriam Avissar and myself. The coins were dated by Nitzan Amitai-Preiss, Jacob Janai and Gabriela Bijovski. Some of the lamps and a mold were cleaned by Miryam Lavi. A few of the lamps were restored by Ora Mazar and Orna Cohen. My thanks to all of them. Shulamit Hadad IX</page><page sequence="7">INTRODUCTION Surveys were conducted at Bet Shean from the late nineteenth century onwards. Between 1921 and 1932, extensive excavations were conducted on the biblical mound of Tel Bet Shean by archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania, who excavated all the strata of the Neolithic to the Ottoman periods on the mound, as well as the Monastery of the Lady Mary on Tel Iztaba. Their findings were published in several reports.1 The uncovering of the city center of Bet Shean began with the excavation of the theater in 1961-62. Other excavations were carried out during the 1960s and 1970s in and around Bet Shean.2 In 1980-81 an excavation of limited scope was conducted at the site, and from 1986 to 1997 excavations were conducted on a much larger scale.3 The status of Bet Shean as one of the principal towns of the East in antiquity resulted from its geographic location on an important crossroads and in a region rich in fertile lahd and water. Bet Shean was founded as the Hellenistic town of Nysa-Scythopolis in the first half of the third century BCE, probably under Ptolemy II Philadelphus (308-246 BCE). This town apparently became a polis a century later, under the Seleucids. The city was sub- sequently included, with nine other cities east of the River Jordan, in the confederacy of ten Hellenistic-Roman cities (Decapolis). In the third-second centuries BCE, Hellenistic Scythopolis expanded from Tel Bet Shean towards Tel Iztaba, north of Nahal Harod (Fig. 1). The area of Tel Iztaba was abandoned after the Hasmonean conquest at the end of the second century BCE, and remained unoccupied up to the Byzantine period. A major change took place in the Roman period after Pompey's conquest in 63 BCE, and particularly in the first century CE. The settlement expanded from the summit of the tel, which now became the acropolis of the city, to the valleys around it; the civic center and public monuments were located at the foot of the tel on the south and west, in the valley of Nahal 'Amai and its margins (Figs. 2-5). 4 The main urban design of Roman Bet Shean can be attributed to the second century CE. Its principal streets were colon- naded. One of these colonnaded streets (Valley Street; Fig. 2:17) ended at the Central Monument (Fig. 2:18), a structure of marble columns and arches on a massive and well-built limestone platform. Beyond the Central Monument was the basilica (Fig. 2:19). A colonnade ("portico") of eighteen monolithic columns decorated with Ionic capitals (Fig. 2:26) stood southeast of the Central Monument; in front of them was a shallow pool (Fig. 2:27), decorated and paneled with marble slabs, that reflected the colonnade. The basalt- paved Silvanus Street (Fig. 2:28) passed by the colonnade and pool and continued to the northwest of the Central Monument as the Street of the Monuments (Fig. 2:30). At the junction of this street and Valley Street was a semicircular monument named by us the Monument of Antonius after an inscription on its facade (Fig. 2:16). The monument replaced the first in a row of shops (Fig. 2:31; Figs. 6-7), referred to hereafter as the shops of the Street of the Monuments. They were built in the early Roman period, used into the Byzantine period and destroyed by fire in the early sixth century CE; some of them were never rebuilt or reused. A colonnade decorated with Corinthian capitals continued from the Monument of Antonius to the northwest On the other side of the street were the magnificent facades of a temple (Fig. 2:14) and a nymphaeum (Fig. 2:15). The temple, apparently connected with the cult of Dionysos, the principal god of the city, was a small but elegant structure. It comprised a pronaos with four columns supporting a Syrian gable and a round cella that was apparently surrounded by columns. The semicircular nymphaeum was richly embel- lished with architectural decoration. The city's entertain- ment and cultural events were held in the theater (Fig. 2:1) adjacent to the city center and in the hippodrome (Fig. 8) on the city's southern outskirts, outside the densely populated municipal area. In the fourth-fifth centuries CE changes took place in the city of Bet Shean, primarily because of two processes that were at work in Palestine at that time: a general increase in population and the almost complete triumph of Christianity over paganism. Several dozen years after the rise of Christianity the temple was destroyed, and in the late fourth century CE an amphitheater was built over part of the hippodrome, apparently following the earthquake of 363 CE (Figs. 8-11). The nymphaeum too was reconstructed after the earthquake. The central church (Fig. 2:34) was built on the tel next to the destroyed temple of Zeus (Fig. 2:33). The crosses carved on building stones and inscriptions further testify to a Christian presence in the city. 1</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 1.

Aerial view of the city center of Bet Shean, looking west. In the Byzantine period, Palestine reached a peak of demographic growth. This growth was especially rapid in Bet Shean, perhaps because it became the capital of the new province of Palaestina Secunda, established at the end of the fourth century CE. In the fifth and early sixth centuries CE the utilitarian approach to architecture and to city building that was typical of the Byzantine period reached its fullest expression. The area of the large Roman colonnade and the pool in front of it was completely remodeled. The street was paved with basalt stones; a dedicatory inscription found in the street near the amphitheater indicates that the pavement and a new water system were installed in 522 CE. Piazzas and monumental public buildings, which had once been the glory of the Roman city, were dismantled or rearranged to facilitate new economic and social activity. The basilica went out of use and other structures, alleys and colonnades were built in its area. Though earlier decorated monuments lacking offensive functions were not destroyed, no particular effort was made to repair damage to them. This trend accelerated in the late sixth and early seventh centuries CE, when private citizens began to take over public areas. Between the Muslim conquest and 749 CE the town, now called Baysan, suffered a long, slow decline. The picture emerging from the excavations reflects a deteriorating state of affairs. The intrusion of private buildings into the public domain became routine, streets and squares were turned into narrow alleys and sewage channels led directly from houses and workshops into the street. In 660 CE, the city center was destroyed by an earthquake. Parts of the former city center now became an industrial area, and pottery kilns were built near the theater (Fig. 2:21), 5 in the basilica and in the arena of the amphitheater (Figs. 9-11). Private structures were erected in the orchestra of the theater and in the arena of the amphitheater. In 738 CE, according to a glass wall mosaic inscription, a row of shops (, sūq ) was built by the Caliph Hishām (Figs. 12-15); it is referred to hereafter as the Umayyad shopping street. The shops were erected on the former sites of a Byzantine structure which we named Silvanus Hall (Fig. 2:26) and of the reflecting pool (Fig. 2:27), which had been 5</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 5.

These shops were destroyed in the earthquake of 1 8 January 749 CE and never rebuilt. The finds from the shops helped us to distinguish between the pottery and lamps of the Umayyad and Abbasid periods. After this earthquake the nucleus of Baysan moved to the southern plateau, where it existed through the Ottoman period and into modern times. Some remains dating from the Abbasid to Mamluk periods were also found on the central valley and on the mound. In the Abbasid period the area was leveled, as far as was possible, over the earthquake destruction and new residential quarters were built, generally without reference to the orientation of the ancient city's buildings and streets. Northwest of Valley Street a quarter was built directly on the ruins of the earthquake (Fig. 2:32). This quarter comprises small houses built from basalt stones and reused Roman architectural elements and building stones, around paved courtyards; the quarter is crossed by alleys. In the Crusader period a fortress was built over earlier structures in the highest spot of Bet Shean, south of the tel; it was constructed mainly from stone seats taken from the nearby amphitheater. In 1263 CE, after the area was recaptured by the Mamluks, the empty fortress was used for sugar manufacture. Towards the end of the Mamluk period the fortress went out of use, and parts of it collapsed and were never rebuilt.6 NOTES 1. Rowe 1930; Fitzgerald 1931 and 1939. 2.

Two expeditions are currently working at Bet Shean: the Hebrew University expedition, headed by Profs. Gideon Foerster and Yoram Tsafrir, and the expedition of the Israel Antiquities Authority, directed by Rachel Bar-Nathan and Gabi Mazor. Thus far both expeditions have published only preliminary reports: Foerster and Tsafrir 1988, 1990 and 1993; Tsafrir and Foerster 1991, 1992a, 1992b, 1994 and 1997; Mazor 1988 and 1990; Bar-Nathan and Mazor 1993 and 1994; Mazor and Bar-Nathan 1994 and 1998. In addition, small salvage excavations were carried out by the Israel Antiquities Authority; these are as yet unpublished. The present short introduction is based on the preliminary reports of G.

These wheel-made lamps are made from light brown and grayish-brown clay and slipped with reddish-brown slip. They have a circular body, upward-sloping rim, high filling hole, short nozzle and flat base. Lamps of this type were discovered in Tomb N.III at Maresha-Beth Guvrin and dated to the third-second centuries BCE.1 They were also found at Gezer2 and Beth Zur.3 A lamp of this type is in the Schioessinger collection.4 Two of the lamps from Bet Shean were found near the amphitheater (L. 99186, 39088) and the third in an early Islamic structure near Valley Street (L. 74504). A date of the third-second centuries BCE is suggested for these lamps. Type 2 (Nos. 2-3) One complete lamp and one almost complete example (after restoration) of this type were discovered at Bet Shean. No. 2 is made from light gray clay and glazed with a dark gray glaze. It is decorated with groups of two and three lines and has a lug handle and a disc base. No. 3 is made from orange-brown clay and slipped with reddish-brown slip, of which , only traces remain. It is decorated with a radial pattern and lacks a handle. This type parallels Type 12A at Dor, dated to 200-50 BCE; this is the typical lamp of the second century BCE at Dor.5 It is very widespread at Tel Anafa in strata postdating the mid-second century BCE.6 At Tirat Yehuda it was dated to the second half of the third and the second centuries BCE.7 Lamps of this type were also found at Masada,8 Beth Zur9 and Maresha-Beth Guvrin.10 This type is very common at Delos and is dated to the second half of the second and beginning of the first centuries BCE.11 At Tarsus these lamps are classified as Group IV, dated to the late third and early second centuries BCE.12 This type parallels Howland's Type 45A, dated to the third century BCE, middle years into third quarter.13 No. 2 from Bet Shean was discovered in an early Islamic structure near the rear wall of the temple (L. 54204). No. 3 was discovered in the foundation level of Bet Shean (L. 44436) under the early Roman basilica of the first century CE. This lamp represents the transition from the Hellenistic to early Roman periods. Type 2 lamps should be dated to the second to first half of the first centuries BCE. Type 3 (No. 4) One fragment of this type was found at Bet Shean. The lamp, only the nozzle of which is preserved, is made from light brown clay and slipped with reddish-brown slip on the upper part only. The nozzle has an unclear decoration on the top and lines on the bottom. The lamp had a ring base. This lamp is probably a local imitation of a lamp of unknown type, judging by its shape and decoration, which differ from those of local lamps of this period. This lamp was found near the amphitheater (L. 29111) with pottery of the early Roman through Byzantine periods and a coin of the early third century CE. The lamp cannot be dated on the basis of the context in which it was found, and a general date in the early Roman period is proposed for it. Type 4 (Nos. 5-10) The lamps of this type are wheel-made and characterized by their knife-pared nozzle, which has given them the name "knife-pared lamps". Forty-three fragments were found at Bet Shean, most of which (36) are nozzles (Nos. 5-9). In one case (No. 10) the rim and band handle are preserved. Eight of the nozzles are decorated with incised horizontal lines and circles. The lamps are made from light and dark brown, orange-brown and gray clay. Three are slipped with gray slip. This type is widespread throughout Palestine and is also well known in Nabatean sites in North Sinai.14 It first appeared at the end of the first century BCE, late in Herod's reign or very soon afterwards, and continued in use until the mid-second century CE.15 13</page><page sequence="20">Local clay lamps, Type 1 (No. 1); Type 2 (Nos. 2-3). 14</page><page sequence="21">Local clay lamps, Type 3 (No. 4); Type 4 (Nos. 5-10); Type 5 (No. 11). 15</page><page sequence="22">Some of the lamps of this type from Bet Shean were found with pottery and coins of the first-second centuries CE, but few came from clear stratigraphie contexts that permit their dating. Type 5 (No. 11) Two fragments of one lamp of this type were found at Bet Shean. The lamp is made from light gray clay. The rim is decorated with a branch of olive leaves and fruits, and across the nozzle is a pair of raised ridges. The loop handle is incised and the base is a low ring base. This lamp type occurs in Jerusalem's Citadel in Stratum IV, dated to the Herodian period and destroyed in 70 CE.16 Examples from Masada were dated to the last decade or two before the siege and fall of Masada.17 A complete lamp was found at Aroer.18 The lamp of this type from Bet Shean was found near the Monument of Antonius (L. 94562) with lamps of Types 4 and 7 and pottery and coins of the first-second centuries CE. On the basis of the finds from Jerusalem and Masada, this type should be dated to 50-70 CE. Ttype 6 (Nos. 12-18) This type is very similar to that defined as the "Southern lamp"19 or "molded Judean lamp".20 One complete lamp, one almost complete example (after restoration) and 57 fragments of this type were found at Bet Shean. The lamps are made from light brown, orange-brown and dark brown clay, and are unslipped, apart from two nozzles that are slipped with red slip. The almost complete lamp (No. 12) and three fragments are undecorated.21 The ornamentation found on the remaining lamps can be divided into two groups: Vegetal decoration: scrolls with bunches of grapes and vine leaves, pomegranates (No. 13), a branch of olive leaves and fruits (No. 14). Geometric decoration: crescents (No. 15), intertwined triangles (No. 16), spirals, circles, semicircles, raised dots and a string of dots set between two ridges with the rest of the rim remaining undecorated (No. 17),22 and undefined decoration (No. 18). All the lamps (apart from the undecorated examples) have a spatolate nozzle ending in two projecting volutes and a small unpierced knob handle. The nozzle of one of the lamps is decorated with three elongated leaves, and two nozzles have unclear decoration. These lamps have two alternative base types: a low disc base or a base surrounded by one or two rings. ■ These lamps are similar in shape, handle and base to some of the lamps found in the "potter's store" at Jerash, but they differ in both decoration and clay.23 The lamps found at Bet Shean can be defined as a northern variant of the Judean lamps. Lamps of this type were also discovered at Sepphoris.24 Most of the lamps of this type from Bet Shean, including the complete example, were found near the nymphaeum with early Roman pottery and Type 7 lamps. Judging from the absence of this type from destruction levels of 70 CE and its discovery in the Judean Desert refuge caves used during the Bar Kokhba Revolt, this type should be dated to 70-135 CE.25 Type 7 (Nos. 19-29) Lamps of this type are characterized by a round body, a discus and a small, round nozzle. The discus is usually decorated, though some are plain.26 The filling hole is very small and there is sometimes more than one filling hole; some lamps have a large filling hole formed either after firing by breaking the discus irregularly, or during manufacture while the clay was still pliable. No effort was made to create a precisely round filling hole, and sometimes it is almost square. These lamps have two alternative base types: a low disc base or a ring base. Most of the Syro-Palestinian lamps of this type lack handles, though at Bet Shean there is one fragment that originally had a small pierced handle (not preserved). This type has two variants, which differ in size and the clay from which they are made. Variant 1 (Nos. 19-24). Two complete lamps, three almost complete lamps (after restoration) and 144 frag- ments of this variant were found at Bet Shean. They can be divided into two groups: A. Imported lamps (Nos. 19-21): these lamps have a very thin wall and are well fired. They are made from well- levigated gray, light brown, pinkish-brown and orange- brown clay, and slipped with black, brown-black, dark brown, reddish-brown and red slip. B. Provincial variations (Nos. 22-24): lamps with a somewhat thicker wall than the imported lamps. They are made from orange-brown, grayish-brown, and light and dark brown clay; a few of them are slipped with red slip. Their clay is poorly levigated and sometimes includes small black and white grits. The decoration of the rim and discus is common to both groups. The rim is decorated with ovolo (the most common motif), stamped leaves, circles and darts, a radial deco- ration, intertwined triangles and double axes. In some cases the rim bears only double axes, while the rest of the rim remains undecorated. The discus is decorated with a tree, a dolphin, a Medusa head, a rosette, stylized flowers and erotic scenes; some are undecorated. 16</page><page sequence="23">Local clay lamps, Type 6. 17</page><page sequence="24">Local clay lamps, Type 7. 18</page><page sequence="25">Local clay lamps, Type 7 (cont.). 19</page><page sequence="26">A few bases are decorated: one disc base is decorated with a stylized flower, three disc bases have an impressed planta pedis in the centei; and one ring base is decorated with the letter A on either side of a small circle. Variant 2 (Nos. 25-29). Two complete lamps and 47 fragments of this variant were found at Bet Shean. They are made from light and dark brown, yellowish and gray clay. Some of the lamps are slipped with red or brown slip. The rim of the lamps of this variant is thick in comparison to the thin rim of most Variant 1 lamps. The lamps are also slightly larger, though they retain the shape of the small, rounded nozzle and the round body. The decoration consists of concentric triangles, stamped triangles, ovolo, circles and leaves, short lines and double axes. In this variant too the rim is sometimes decorated only with double axes, while the rest of the rim remains undecorated. The volute decoration that adorns the nozzles of Variant 1 lamps does not always appear here. In most examples the discus, or what remains of it, is undecorated, though a few bear ovolo, stamped leaves or unclear decoration. Lamps of this type parallel Broneer's Type XXV27 and Loeschcke's Type VIII.28 They parallel Types 26 and 27 at Dor, where good-quality lamps are dated to the last quarter of the first century- 150 CE, followed by a decline until the third century.29 Many lamps of Variant 1 were found at Apollonia- Arsuf.30 Lamps of both variants were discovered .at Sepphoris.31 Variant 2 lamps dated by Avigad to the third century CE were found in catacombs at Beth She'arim,32 and they appear in the burial cave at Silet edh-Dhahr.33 Lamps of Variant 1 were found in tombs at Pella and dated to the first or early second century CE,34 and were discovered at Abila35 and Palmyra36; other examples are in private collections.37 Some of the Variant 1 lamps from Bet Shean were found with pottery and coins of the early Roman period and lamps of Types 5 and 6, but few can be dated by the contexts in which they were found. Most of the Variant 2 lamps were found in a layer of fill in two closed rooms (L. 06544, L. 06548) near the Umayyad shopping street, with pottery and coins of the second-fourth centuries CE. Some lamps, including one complete specimen, were found in a trial section near the foundations of the temple (L. 884). Early and late Roman pottery and four coins of the third century CE were found with these lamps. Another complete Variant 2 lamp was found in a pit (L. 291 13) near the amphitheater with pottery of the third-fourth centuries CE. The imported lamps of Variant 1 first appeared in the late first century CE (after 70) and continued in use in the second century. The provincial variations of Variant 1 appeared later, perhaps in the late second century CE, and continued to the third century. The lamps of Variant 2 should be dated to the third century CE.38 Type 8 (No. 30) This type is a local copy of Broneer's Type XXI.39 One handle was discovered at Bet Shean; it has a triangular leaf shape and is decorated with concentric circles. It is made from light brown clay with many small black grits. The handle was discovered near the amphitheater (L. 99159) with Type 7 lamps and pottery of the first-second centuries CE. This lamp should apparently be dated to the second century CE. Type 9 (No. 31) This lamp type is a local copy of Broneer's Type XXIII, dated to the first century CE.40 One almost complete lamp was found at Bet Shean. It is made from light gray clay and slipped with black-brown slip. The rim is plain and the large filling hole was formed by breaking the discus. The lamp has a disc base with an impressed planta pedis in its center. This lamp was found near the amphitheater (L. 29099) with pottery of the early Roman period and lamps of Types 6 and 7. Like the previous type, it should apparently be dated to the second century CE. Type 10 (Nos. 32-33) Three fragments of this type were found at Bet Shean. Typologically it is related to Type 7, but the Type 10 lamps have a small pyramidal handle. They are made from orange- brown clay, and are slipped with reddish-brown slip. The rim is plain and the discus is decorated with closed semicircles. Lamps of this type, though with a different handle, were found in the "potter's store" at Jerash and were dated by Iliffe to the first quarter of the second century CE.41 Some lamps of this type are in the Schioessinger collection.42 One of the lamps from Bet Shean was found near the temple (L. 850) with pottery of the first-second centuries CE and Type 7 lamps. The second lamp was discovered near the amphitheater (L. 39005) with lamps of Types 4 and 7. The third lamp cannot be dated by the context in which it was found (L. 05064). On the basis of the assemblages from Jerash and Bet Shean, these lamps should be dated to the second century CE. Type 11 (No. 34) This type, like the previous one, is not widespread at Bet Shean; three fragments were found. The first (No. 34) is made from well-levigated yellowish clay, slipped with black-brown slip and well fired. The rim is decorated with alternating impressed stylized flowers and double axes (?), and the discus is undecorated. There is a small solid handle. 20</page><page sequence="27">Local clay lamps, Type 8 (No. 30); Type 9 (No. 31); Type 10 (Nos. 32-33); Type 11 (No. 34); Type 12 (Nos. 35-37); Type 13 (No. 38). 21</page><page sequence="28">The second lamp is made from orange-brown clay. The rim is decorated with concentric circles and the discus is plain; the handle is not preserved. The third lamp is made from light brown clay and slipped with reddish-brown slip. The rim is decorated with ovolo and the discus with a row of raised dots. This lamp too has a small solid handle. The lamps were not discovered in clear stratigraphie contexts that permit their dating. On the basis of their considerable resemblance to one of the types found in the "potter's store" at Jerash,43 these lamps can be dated to the second century CE. Type 12 (Nos. 35-37) Three handles of this lamp type were discovered at Bet Shean. Similar lamps were found in the "potter's store" at Jerash.44 These lamps imitate bronze lamps, with a laige elongated pear-shaped body and a high handle terminating in an animal's head.45 The Bet Shean lamps are made from light brown and yellowish-brown clay, unlike the dark gray clay of the lamps of this type found at Jerash, and they are apparently local copies. Two of the handles terminate in a horse's head (Nos. 35-36), while on the third handle, part of which is missing, the head cannot be identified (No. 37). Lamps from the "potter's store" at Jerash were found at Dor 46 One example was discovered at Caesarea,47 and .some are in the Schioessinger collection.48 One of the handles from Bet Shean was found near . the basilica (L. 05525) with pottery of the early Roman period and a coin of the second century CE. The second •handle was discovered near Palladius Street (L. 15302) with pottery of the first-second centuries CE. The third handle was found near the temple (L. 95194) with pottery of the late Roman and Byzantine periods. This type, like the two previous ones, should be dated to the second century CE. Type 13 (Nos. 38-45) These lamps are known as "Jebel Jofeh lamps", after the site in Amman at which more than a hundred were discovered in a single tomb.49 One complete lamp, two almost complete lamps and 68 fragments of Type 13, which is apparently a local copy, were found at Bet Shean. The lamps are characterized by their large filling hole and small round nozzle. They have a small solid vertical handle, decorated with two grooves in the front and the back where the handle joins the ring base, apart from two lamps that have a pierced handle. The lamps of this type can be divided into three groups: • Group 1 (Nos. 38-40). This group includes the complete and the two almost complete lamps and four fragments. The lamps are small and are made from light to dark brown clay, apart from one example made from gray clay. Traces of red and brown slip are preserved on two examples. All the lamps are well fired. The complete lamp and one of the fragments are undecorated, one almost complete lamp and two fragments are decorated with a string of raised dots, and the second almost complete lamp bears an impressed design of small flowers. Only the handle and base of the two other lamps are preserved. The base of the complete lamp and one other base are ornamented with a stylized flower, the base of the almost complete lamp is decorated with several circles, and one base is undecorated. Group 2 (Nos. 41-43). The lamps of this group, consisting of 56 fragments, are recognizable by their well- levigated white, light brown, orange-brown or grayish- brown clay. They are slipped with reddish-brown slip. The quality of their firing is very poor, which certainly accounts for the fact that not one complete specimen is preserved. The ornamentation on the rim is very simple: circles in high relief or impressed decoration composed of simple geo- metric patterns such as circles, ellipses and wavy lines. A few lamps bear stamped flowers and leaves. The small discus is sometimes decorated with an impressed pattern of circles and sometimes left plain. The only base preserved is a ring base decorated with several circles. Group 3 (Nos. 44-45). The lamps of this group, which comprises seven fragments, are large. They are made from light brown and orange-brown clay and four of them are slipped with brown slip. They are well fired. The rim of one of the lamps is decorated with a design of alternating impressed stylized leaves and concentric circles. A circle composed of alternating small rectangles and circles in relief separates the rim from the discus. The discus slants slightly inward and is decorated with small rectangles. Another lamp is decorated with stamped leaves on the rim and circles on the discus. On one lamp the rim is decorated with concentric circles, while the discus is plain. One of the lamps with a pierced handle, of which only a small part of the rim is preserved, is decorated with laige circles in high relief. Of the second lamp with the pierced handle, only the handle and a small part of the base is preserved. A large unpierced handle decorated with two grooves is the only preserved part of two lamps. One lamp fragment is decorated with wavy lines. This type is widespread at Jerash and is dated there to the third-fourth centuries CE.50 A few examples were discov- ered at Pella and ascribed to the third-fourth centuries CE.51 A lamp of this type found at Gadara was dated to the fourth century CE.52 Lamps of this type were also discovered at Abila.53 A few lamps of this type were discovered at Sepphoris.54 This type parallels Kennedy's Type 8.55 The date assigned to the lamps from Jerash and Pella is 22</page><page sequence="29">Local clay lamps, Type 13 (cont.) (Nos. 39-45); Type 14 (No. 46). 23</page><page sequence="30">confirmed by the finds from Bet Shean. The complete lamp was found near the amphitheater (L. 29098) with pottery of the third-fourth centuries CE. One almost complete lamp and one fragment of Group 3 were also discovered near the amphitheater (L. 615), but cannot be dated by the context in which they were found. The second almost complete lamp was found in a fill that contained a thick layer of brick, pipe and tile fragments from the nearby eastern bathhouse and architectural elements made of nari limestone, adjacent to the southern gate complex of the Roman basilica (L. 74024). This layer was buried under Rometalkes Alley of the sixth century CE. Late Roman pottery fragments and three coins were found with the lamp: a coin of the second or third century CE, a coin of Gordian III (239-240 CE) and a coin of Valerian (253-260 CE). Most of the Group 2 lamps were discovered in the excavation of the complex opposite the southern gate of the basilica, in a fill between the sixth-century CE level and the occupation levels and debris associated with the Roman basilica. Late Roman pottery fragments and four coins of the third-fourth centuries CE were found with the lamps: a third-century CE coin of Salonina, a coin of Trebonianus Gallus (25 1- 253 CE), and two coins of Constantine the Great (307-337 CE). These lamps can therefore be dated to the mid-third to mid-fourth centuries CE. Type 14 (No. 46) This lamp type, very frequent in the catacombs at Beth She'arim, is commonly called the "Beth She'arim lamp".56 It is prevalent only in northern Palestine, with a few examples occurring in southern Phoenicia.57 At Bet Shean two lamps of this type were discovered: one almost complete specimen lacking a small part of the rim, handle and base (No. 46), and a small fragment of the rim and discus of a second lamp. Both are made from light brown clay. The almost complete lamp is ornamented with an impressed pattern of circles surrounded by intertwined semicircles and ladder design. The nozzle is decorated with a rectangle containing three impressions. The filling hole was formed by breaking the plain discus. The lamp has a small grooved handle and a ring base. The joint of the upper and lower parts of the lamp is covered by a thin layer of clay and smoothed to a point, creating a sharp carination. The second lamp fragment also bears an impressed pattern of small decorated circles at fixed intervals. The filling hole is small and surrounded by a plain discus; it was formed during manufacture of the lamp and not by breaking the discus. In his discussion of this lamp type, Avigad distinguished between two variants; the Bet Shean specimens belong to his variant a, which he dated to the first half of the fourth century CE.58 Avigad's date was also suggested for the lamps from Jalame.59 Type 14 lamps were discovered in Tomb XV at Hanita and dated to the late third and first half of the fourth centuries CE,60 and this type is quite common at Sepphoris.61 A lamp of this type was published from Capernaum.62 The almost complete lamp from Bet Shean was discovered near the temple in a channel built near a wall (L. 75107) with late Roman pottery and one coin of Constantine the Great (307-337 CE). The lamp and the pottery were part of the fill that blocked the channel. The fragment of the second lamp was discovered in the basilica, in one of the rooms erected inside it in the Byzantine period after it ceased to fulfil its original function (L. 54229). On the basis of the finds from Beth She'arim and Bet Shean, these lamps should be dated to the first half of the fourth century CE. The destruction of Bet She'arim in the earthquake of 363 CE apparently terminated the manufac- ture of these lamps. Type 15 (Nos. 47-52) Eight complete lamps, three almost complete lamps and seven fragments of this type, known as "Karm al-Shaikh lamps",63 were discovered at Bet Shean. This type is prevalent mainly in Jerusalem and its surroundings and is rare in the north.64 The lamps are made from light brown, orange-brown and grayish-brown clay and are slipped with red or brown slip. They are characterized by a large filling hole and the absence of a handle (Nos. 47-48). In two lamps (e.g. No. 49) the discus was broken to form the filling hole, which was previously defined by a pronounced ridge. In one lamp (No. 50), which was unused, the filling hole remained closed. Some of the lamps have a ring base, usually decorated with a geometric design, and some have an undefined base. The lamps are decorated with a radial pattern, triangles and lozenges. Two (Nos. 51-52) are undecorated. All the lamps were found near the amphitheater. All of them, except for one discovered in a surface level, derive from a thick layer of fill intended to raise the ground level of the amphitheater to that of the street adjacent to it. This street was built in 522 CE, according to the inscription among its stones. All the lamps were discovered with very laige quantities of Byzantine potsherds, dozens of complete lamps and fragments of Types 16-20 and 25, and coins of the fourth-fifth centuries CE. Both the fact that the amphitheater was built in the late fourth century CE, and the date of the street, 522 CE, enable the dating of the lamps found at Bet Shean exclusively to the fifth century CE. On the basis of similar lamps discovered in Beit Nattif 24</page><page sequence="31">Local clay lamps, Type 15. 25</page><page sequence="32">Cistern I65 and the finds from Bet Shean, this lamp type may be dated to the fourth-fifth centuries CE. Type 16 (Nos. 53-73) This type is one of the most numerous at Bet Shean, comprising 37 complete lamps, 16 almost complete lamps and 538 fragments of different sizes. These are ovoid lamps whose nozzle and handle are not differentiated but rather constitute part of the body. The filling hole is relatively large and is surrounded by a pronounced ridge, and sometimes also by a circle of incised lines or by a small discus. The lamps are made from light brown, orange- brown, grayish-brown and yellowish-brown clay (the clay is one of the characteristic features of these lamps). All the lamps are slipped with red or brown slip, or an intermediate shade between the two. Apart from one complete lamp and a few sherds, they are all decorated with impressed geometric designs: herring-bone pattern (the most common) (Nos. 53- 62), herring-bone pattern and raised dots (No. 63), vertical lines (No. 64) or two rows of lines (No. 65) across the width of the rim, circles of varying sizes and in different arrays (No. 66), circles and lines (No. 67), rhombi across the width of the rim, and crescents arranged clockwise (Nos. 68-69). One complete lamp is ornamented with dots in high relief (No. 70), and a few sherds have two rows of raised dots .(No. 71). The handle is always decorated with two parallel lines, and sometimes there are two circles (No. 72) or three lines near the wick hole. In a few cases the base is also decorated with a stylized bunch of grapes composed of circles (No. 67), a stylized flower or circles. This type also includes lamps with multiple wick holes (polylychnoi ); of the single example discovered at Bet Shean (No. 73), only a small part of the rim, decorated with herring-bone pattern, and one wick hole are preserved. The lamps are not uniform in size, ranging from 7.2 to 10.7 cm in length. One lamp is very large, 10.7 cm long and 8.5 cm wide. Type 16 is widespread only in northern Palestine.66 Its prevalence at Bet Shean is indicated by the fact that about two hundred fragments were used as fill in the base of a wall constructed in the Roman basilica in the sixth century CE. This type is also very common at Hammat Gader; sixty complete lamps and many fragments, including one with two wick holes, were found there and dated to the end of the fourth-early fifth centuries CE.67 At Beth She'arim these lamps, which are rare there, were dated by Avigad to the first half of the fourth century CE.68 A few lamps were found in the synagogue at Hammath Tiberias,69 and at Sepphoris too these lamps are not common.70 This type parallels Type L5 at Capernaum.71 Lamps of this type were found at Pella only in tombs and dated to the third-fourth centuries CE; many were found, with Type 17 lamps, in two tombs which were dated to the end of the third to beginning of the fourth centuries CE.72 At Gadara they were dated to the third-fourth and fourth-fifth centuries CE.73 Lamps of this type were also found at Abila.74 At Bet Shean, 22 complete lamps and many fragments were found near the amphitheater in the thick layer of fill mentioned above (Type 15). Some lamps were discovered in a refuse pit east of the temple square (L. 65027) with late Roman and Byzantine pottery, complete lamps and frag- ments of Types 17, 19, 21 and 22, and 159 coins: a coin of the mid-third century CE, 157 coins of the fourth-fifth centuries CE, and a Byzantine M coin (512-539 CE). On the basis of the finds from Bet Shean, Type 16 should be dated to the fourth-fifth centuries CE. Type 17 (Nos. 74-113) Type 17 is an imitation of lamps found in Cisterns I and II at Beit Nattif.75 Twenty-five complete specimens, 13 almost complete lamps and 122 fragments of different sizes were found at Bet Shean. All are similar to the lamps found in Cistern II at Beit Nattif, apart from one fragment of the type found in Cistern I.76 Most of the lamps are made from clay in varying tones of brown: light and dark brown, orange- brown, grayish-brown and yellowish-brown. A few were made from dark gray clay. Only four of the lamps found at Bet Shean are red-slipped.77 The fragment similar to the lamps found in Cistern I (No. 74) is made from dark brown clay; its rim is undecorated and the discus, of which only a small part is preserved, is decorated. Lamps with undecorated rim (Nos. 75-76) are rare at Bet Shean. The rim of all the other lamps is ornamented in one of two ways: Geometric decoration: herring-bone pattern (Nos. 77- 80), a string of dots set between two ridges with the rest of the rim remaining undecorated, large dots in high relief (Nos. 81-82), alternating concentric circles and rhombi, guilloche pattern, sometimes with a string of dots, circles, concentric circles (No. 83), bisecting semicircles (Nos. 84- 85), alternating circles and lines, and a radial pattern (No. 86). Vegetal decoration: stylized bunches of grapes, some- times with a string of raised dots (a rare ornamentation at Bet Shean, appearing on only a few sherds). A few lamps had a small discus: sometimes both the rim and the discus are undecorated, sometimes the discus is undecorated and the rim is decorated with a string of dots (No. 87) or herring-bone pattern, and in the remaining cases both the discus and the rim are decorated with bisecting semicircles, or semicircles and raised dots (No. 88). One lamp (No. 89) has a filling hole that was formed by breaking the decorated discus; such lamps were not found at Beit Nattif. 26</page><page sequence="33">Local clay lamps, Type 16. 27</page><page sequence="34">Local clay lamps, Type 16 (cont.). 28</page><page sequence="35">Local clay lamps, Type 16 (cont.). 29</page><page sequence="36">Local clay lamps, Type 17. 30</page><page sequence="37">Local clay lamps, lype 17 (cont.). 31</page><page sequence="38">Local clay lamps, Type 17 (cont.). 32</page><page sequence="39">Local clay lamps, Type 17 (cont.). 33</page><page sequence="40">Local clay lamps, Type 17 (cont.). 34</page><page sequence="41">The lamp nozzle is concave on both sides and bears decoration that differs from that on the rim and is restricted to this part of the lamp. Some of the nozzles are thickened and raised, and this raised part is decorated. The decoration on the nozzle includes a lamp mold (No. 90), 78 a "peacock's tail" in high relief (No. 91), various types of amphora (Nos. 92-94), a three-petalled flower (No. 95), a large leaf, stylized flowers, two rows of herring-bone pattern with a row of dots between them, a row of herring- bone pattern and large dots in high relief (No. 96), a group of dots and two curved rows, circles in different arrays, triangles and circles, concentric triangles, a trefoil loop and raised dots (No. 97), a scallop shell (No. 98), an arch containing an eight-pointed star (No. 99), and undefined decoration (No. 100). In four lamps (Nos. 101-104) the nozzle bears a cross of varying type. Lamps decorated with a menorah (candlestick) were not found at Bet Shean, apart from one small rim and nozzle fragment (No. 105) that apparently bears this decoration. The rim is decorated with a string of dots that curls round near the nozzle, while the rest of the rim is undecorated. The small preserved part of the nozzle contains one of the three legs of the menorah and a shofar. This rim decoration is identical to almost all of the few published lamps with a menorah from Beit Nattif79 and Beth Guvrin.80 Another fragment similar to that from Bet Shean was discovered in the synagogue at Hammath Tiberias.81 A lamp of this type decorated with a menorah on the nozzle, but with a plain rim, was found at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.82 A lamp in which the nozzle is decorated with a seven-branched menorah and a shofar and the rim with a string of dots and herring-bone pattern was discovered at Pella.83 Other lamps decorated with a seven- branched menorah are in private collections.84 All but eight of the lamps have a small pyramidal handle, which , is sometimes decorated with concentric triangles. Three lamps have a raised handle that bears a stylized branch (Nos. 106-107); this handle is typical of Type 21 lamps. One complete lamp (No. 108) and one fragment have a raised handle decorated with lines and two grooves; No. 108 differs in its decoration, consisting of intertwined triangles and two rows of zigzag lines within a circle, from all the other lamps of Type 17, but the shape of the nozzle and the body assign it to this type.85 Three lamps had a loop handle (Nos. 109-111), though in two cases the handle is not fully preserved. Lamps with raised and loop handles are very rare and were not found at Beit Nattif.86 All the bases are ring bases, apart from one flat base. Type 17 includes lamps with multiple wick holes ( polylychnoi ). Of the two found at Bet Shean, the complete example (No. 112) has two wick holes. The second (No. 113), óf which only a small part of the base is preserved, had at least five wick holes. The length of the lamps of this type generally ranges from 7.4 to 11 cm. Lamp No. 110 is 12.3 cm long, excluding the handle, which is not completely preserved. A few lamp fragments are very wide and were apparently very large. This type is equivalent to Elgavish's Types 34 and 37, which were dated by him to the first half of the fourth century CE,87 and Kennedy's Type II.88 The lamps with a cross on the nozzle parallel Kennedy's Type 14.89 Lamps with multiple wick holes parallel Elgavish's Type 35 (dated by him to the second half of the fourth century CE),90 Kennedy's Type 29, 91 and Sussman's Type 4.92 This type parallels Type L4 at Capernaum.93 Lamps of this type at Pella were dated by Smith and McNicoll to the third-fourth centuries CE,94 and by da Costa to the second half of the fourth to the fifth centuries CE.95 At Gadara they were dated to the second half of the third to the fifth centuries CE.96 Lamps of this type decorated with a cross were uncovered at Hammat Gader,97 and another example was published by Sussman.98 Other lamps of this type are in private collections.99 At Bet Shean, 19 complete lamps (including one with a loop handle), nine almost complete lamps (two with a raised handle and two with a loop handle) and a few fragments were found near the amphitheater in the layer of fill mentioned above (Type 15). All the lamps found in this fill should be dated to the fifth century CE. As noted above (Type 16), some lamps of Type 17 were found in the refuse pit east of the temple square (L. 65027). Almost all the remaining lamps were found in different areas with finds similar to those mentioned above. A few sherds were found in unclear stratigraphie contexts that do not permit their dating. The latest coin found at Beit Nattif is of 284-305 CE.100 None of the lamps discovered at Bet Shean predates the fourth century CE, and on the basis of all the finds from Bet Shean this lamp type should be dated to the fourth-fifth centuries CE. The lamps with raised and loop handles, which were not found at Beit Nattif, apparently do not predate the fifth century CE. Type 18 (Nos. 114-120) Lamps of this type are among those defined as "Samaritan", a few of which bear Samaritan inscriptions and other motifs related to Samaritan art.101 These lamps are found in regions that are known to have been settled by Samaritans, among them Bet Shean. Three complete specimens, two almost complete lamps and eight fragments (two of which comprise the rim and base of one lamp) were discovered at Bet Shean. They are made from light brown, yellowish- brown, orange-brown and dark brown clay. One lamp is 35</page><page sequence="42">Local clay lamps, Type 18. 36</page><page sequence="43">red-slipped. The filling hole was formed by breaking the discus after it was defined by a pronounced ridge, or during manufacture of the lamp when the clay was still pliable.102 The nozzle is slightly concave on both sides and the base is a small ring base. The lamps have three alternative types of handle: a pyramidal handle, a small knob handle or a small rectangular ledge handle. The lamps are not uniform in size or shape. One lamp (No. 114) is undecorated. The complete lamp with a ledge handle (No. 115) is decorated with ladder design (very common in this lamp type) all around the rim, and with triangles filled with lines and concentric circles. The nozzle bears a square divided into four triangles filled with lines; the feature of a decoration specific to the nozzle connects this lamp with the previous and subsequent types. Around the small ring base is a circle of lozenges between two ridges. The lamp that is complete apart from its handle, apparently a knob handle (No. 116), is decorated with geometric patterns, including the discus. One lamp (No. 117) is decorated with ladder design and circles, two fragments with concentric triangles and raised dots, and one fragment (No. 118) with wheels and geometric designs. The lamp with a pyramidal handle (No. 119) is decorated with geometric patterns. The nozzle, of which a small part is missing, is ornamented with a rosette. Of one lamp only a small part of the decorated rim is preserved, and another fragment (No. 120) is ornamented with ridges and dots. Type 18 includes lamps with multiple wick holes ( polylychnoi );103 two such lamps were discovered at Bet Shean. One lamp (No. 119) originally had two wick holes that are not preserved, as indicated by the beginning of the division between the two wick holes. Only a small part of the rim and nozzle of the second lamp (No. 120) is preserved, but the position of the wick hole at the end of the nozzle points to its having had more than one wick hole. Type 18 lamps are equivalent to Elgavish's Type 51, dated to the fourth-fifth centuries CE.104 Lamps of this type were found at Samaria.105 At Silet edh-Dhahr these lamps were dated by Sellers and Baramki to the fourth or beginning of the fifth century CE.106 Lamps of this type were found in a burial cave on Mt. Gilboa.107 Lamps from Kefar 'Ara and Apollonia-Arsuf were dated by Sussman to the third-fourth centuries CE.108 One complete lamp was found in burial caves at Mughar al-Sharaf in the Sharon that were used by the Samaritans from the third century CE onwards.109 This type parallels Types 22a, 22c and 22f at Caesarea.110 A lamp of this type decorated with a seven- branched menorah was discovered at Sumaqa, a Jewish village on the Carmel.111 A lamp fragment was discovered at Gadara and dated to the third to early fifth centuries CE.112 At Bet Shean, eleven of the lamps were found near the amphitheater, ten of them in the thick layer of fill mentioned above (Type 15). One polylychnos and the undecorated lamp were found in L. 614, and two fragments were found in L. 09024. The fragment of the second polylychnos was discovered in the drainage channel of the Byzantine street near the amphitheater (L. 620) with Roman and Byzantine pottery. Two lamp fragments were found in a locus near the temple (L. 05106) with lamps of Types 16 and 17. Type 18, like the three previous ones, should be dated to the fourth- fifth centuries CE. Type 19 (Nos. 121-224) This is the most common type at Bet Shean, comprising 121 complete lamps, 60 almost complete lamps (in most cases lacking only the handle, in others a small part of the rim or base) and 274 fragments. Most of the lamps are of high quality and the designs are very clear, though a few were made in worn molds. The wick hole is very burnt in only a few lamps, and most of the lamps were used for a short time or were completely unused. All but two have handles in various shapes and sizes. No. 121 has no handle and its filling hole was formed by breaking the discus after firing, a feature appearing only in this lamp. No. 122 has a very small knob at the edge of the rim, which should perhaps not be defined as a handle.113 The lamps are characterized by two distinct features: their , crowded ornamentation leaves no space empty, and there is an unexplained protuberance at the base of almost all of them, beneath the handle. The latter feature may have been intended to give stability to lamps with large handles, but also appears on smaller lamps. Almost all the lamps were made in different molds, as can be seen from the variety of their decoration; only a few, in groups of two to five, were made in the same mold. The lamps are made from brown or gray clay in varying shades: light and dark brown, orange-brown, pinkish-brown, grayish-brown, dark brown fired to gray on the surface, and light and dark gray. The lamps are well fired to a metallic quality. They are not uniform in size, ranging from 7.9 to 13.7 cm in length. The base may be a small low ring base, a flat base or a slightly sunken base. Type 19 lamps can be divided into seven groups, a division that is purely stylistic and lacks chronological or other developmental implications, since lamps of the different groups were found together. Group 1 (Nos. 123-136). The lamps in this group are decorated with herring-bone pattern or herring-bone pattern and circles (the most common decorations), concentric circles, alternating stylized flowers and lozenges, five decorated semicircles, intertwined triangles and small circles, circles, triangles and lines between two rows of 37</page><page sequence="44">Local clay lamps, Type 19. 38</page><page sequence="45">Local clay lamps, Type 19 (cont.). 39</page><page sequence="46">Local clay lamps, Type 19 (cont.). 40</page><page sequence="47">Local clay lamps, Type 19 (cont.). 41</page><page sequence="48">Local clay lamps, Type 19 (cont.). 42</page><page sequence="49">Local clay lamps, Type 19 (cont.). 43</page><page sequence="50">Local clay lamps, Type 19 (cont.). 44</page><page sequence="51">Local clay lamps, Type 19 (cont.). 45</page><page sequence="52">Local clay lamps, Type 19 (cont.). 46</page><page sequence="53">Local clay lamps, Type 19 (cont.). 47</page><page sequence="54">Local clay lamps, Type 19 (cont.). 48</page><page sequence="55">raised dots, and guilloche pattern. The filling hole is surrounded by a string of small dots, wavy lines or small circles. The nozzle bears a geometric design (concentric rhombi, circles, raised dots, a circle sometimes with lines, a square or a lozenge) in a frame, usually square or rectangular. It may be ornamented with a square divided into small squares, sometimes decorated with dots, a row of raised dots, a circle within a lozenge within a rectangle, a square filled with lines, concentric circles and other geometric designs. Some nozzles are decorated with a stylized flower. The feature of ornamentation specific to the nozzle connects this lamp type with the previous ones. The lamps have a small grooved rectangular handle. Type 19 is equivalent to Kennedy's Type 21. 114 Group 1 is the most numerous of the seven groups at Bet Shean, and Groups 1 and 6 are the only groups of which examples were discovered in excavations at other sites. The lamps of this group parallel Elgavish's Type 32, dated to approximately the mid-fourth century CE.115 They were found in the mausoleum near Kibbutz Mesilot near Bet Shean, where they were dated to the fourth-fifth centuries CE,"6 at Silet edh-Dhahr, where they were dated by Sellers and Baramki to the fourth-sixth centuries CE,"7 at Khirbet Kheibar in Samaria,"8 in a burial on Mt. Gilboa119 and at Jalame, where they were attributed to the third quarter of the fourth century CE.120 One complete lamp was discovered at Hammat Gader,121 and one fragment was found in Nazareth.122 At Pella one lamp was discovered in Tomb 39A, which, according to the excavators, was built in the second half of the third century and remained in use until the third quarter of the fourth century CE.123 Some lamps of this group were published by Israeli and Avida.124 Group 2 (Nos. 137-154). The lamps of this group have an elongated shape and a small open fan-shaped handle decorated with several lines. They are common at Bet Shean, though not as numerous as the previous group. The entire surface of the lamps in this group, excluding the nozzle, is covered with one design: wavy lines, herring- bone pattern, herring-bone pattern and rhombi or circles, herring-bone pattern edged by a stylized flower at the lamp's mid-section, herring-bone pattern in opposing directions, alternating rhombi and circles, guilloche pattern, or woven mat design. In some lamps the filling hole is surrounded by wavy lines or a string of dots. Three nozzles are decorated with a seven-branched menorah standing on a tripod base, each menorah differing in the shape of its branches. The other nozzles bear a small jug, small rhombi and dots within a square, a rectangle decorated with geometric designs, a square or rectangle divided into four, six or nine squares or rectangles filled with X and dots, a rectangle decorated with net pattern and dots, a rhombus within a rectangle, rhombi and dots, a square filled with dots, a square filled with two circles and raised dots, rhombi within a square, two lines, sometimes within a frame, and a triangle filled with dots. Two lamps decorated with a seven-branched menorah, one of which is identical to No. 137 from Bet Shean, were published by Goodenough.125 A lamp with a seven- branched menorah identical to No. 147 from Bet Shean was published by Kennedy.126 Group 3 (Nos. 155-170). Some of the lamps in this group are similar in shape to lamps of Group 2; they are also common at Bet Shean. The entire surface of the lamp, including the nozzle, is ornamented with a single design: guilloche pattern, guilloche and a row of dots on the nozzle, herring-bone pattern, herring-bone pattern and wavy lines, herring-bone pattern edged by a stylized flower at the lamp's mid-section, herring-bone pattern with geometric designs around the filling hole, intertwined triangles, triangles filled with lines, triangles and raised dots, triangles and circles, circles, concentric circles and wavy lines, straight lines, wavy lines, zigzag lines, lines and raised dots, a square within a square and wavy lines, woven mat design, or a stylized branch. In some of the lamps the filling hole is surrounded by a string of raised dots. One lamp in this group is outstanding in its size (13.7 cm long). The lamp is decorated with intertwined squares and circles, each ornamented with geometric designs. The nozzle bears a decorated rectangle. Lamps of this group were published by Kennedy,127 one of them identical to No. 156 from Bet Shean. Group 4 (Nos. 171-178). Lamps of this group are very rare. The entire lamp, including the handle and nozzle, is decorated with raised dots. The nozzle sometimes bears a different decoration, also composed of dots: a circle filled with dots, a triangle filled with dots, a square filled with dots and a square divided into four triangles filled with dots. This group includes the smallest lamp of this type (7.9 cm long), and one of the largest (12.5 cm long excluding the handle, which is not preserved). This lamp is decorated with intertwined triangles filled with dots. The filling hole is surrounded by a string of dots, and near the handle is a circle filled with dots. Group 5 (Nos. 179-183). Lamps of this group differ from Groups 1-4 in the division of the surface of the lamp. A few complete lamps belonging to this group were found. The surface of some of the lamps, including the nozzle, is divided into five circles bearing geometric patterns. The space between the circles is decorated with herring-bone pattern or lines. Near the handle is a decorated square. One lamp is ornamented with four circles decorated with geometric designs, and a herring-bone pattern near the handle. The nozzle bears a seven-branched menorah standing on a tripod base. Six flames are depicted by dots 49</page><page sequence="56">set between two ridges. The wick hole is very burnt, indicating the intensive use made of this lamp (it still smells of burnt oil). Another lamp, of which only a small part of the nozzle is preserved, was made in the same mold. One lamp is decorated with two circles and two rhombi between two rows of dots; the nozzle is ornamented with a decorated rectangle. One lamp is decorated with a circle filled with lines and a square filled with rhombi, the space between them filled with lines; the nozzle is decorated with concentric squares. One lamp bears four decorated circles and two rectangles filled with net pattern and dots; its nozzle bears lozenges within a square. Two lamps made in the same mold are decorated with concentric circles and lozenges filled with dots, the space between them filled with lines and dots. The nozzle is ornamented with a decorated circle, and near the handle is a geometric design. A lamp of this group whose nozzle is decorated with a seven-branched menorah was published by Kennedy.128 Group 6 (Nos. 184-217). Lamps of this fairly common group bear different decorations but are characterized by their handle, which differs from the handles of the other groups. In some cases only the handles are preserved. The handles vary in shape and size, and some were affixed to the lamp only after it was made. The handles are shaped like serrated leaves, stylized flowers, stars, semicircles, trian- gles, heptagons, hexagons and rectangles. Some are rounded or elongated. All are decorated, bearing geometric designs such as lines, rhombi, dots, concentric hexagons and circles or vegetal designs composed of stylized branches; one handle is decorated with a schematic depiction of a human face. A lamp fragment of this group from the house of Kyrios Leontis at Bet Shean was published by Zori.129 Lamps of this group were discovered at Silet edh-Dhahr and dated by Sellers and Baramki to the fifth-sixth centuries CE.130 They also appear in the collection published by Kennedy,131 one of them identical to No. 195 from Bet Shean. One lamp was published by Israeli and Avida.132 Group 7 (Nos. 218-224). Lamps of this group are longer and higher than the other lamps, with a round body and long nozzle. They have a rounded flat base or a large low ring base. The entire lamp, apart from the nozzle, is decorated with a single design, a feature similar to lamps of Groups 1 and 2. One lamp is similar in decoration to lamps of Group 5. The lamps are decorated with herring-bone pattern or intertwined triangles and dots, and the filling hole is surrounded by a string or two of dots or a circle of intertwined triangles or short lines. The nozzle is orna- mented with a rectangle decorated with geometric designs, lines, two rows of raised dots, rhombi within a rectangle, a rhombus between two rows of raised dots, or a circle decorated with geometric designs. On some of the lamps there is a geometric design near the handle opposite the nozzle. In one lamp the surface is divided into six decorated circles and the nozzle has a row of raised dots. The lamps of this group are rare. As indicated by the finds from Bet Shean, Kibbutz Mesilot, Silet edh-Dhahr and Khirbet Kheibar, lamps of Type 19 are widespread in the Bet Shean Valley and Samaria. A few examples were discovered at Hammat Gader, Jalame, Nazareth, Mt. Gilboa and Pella. Almost all of the lamps of this type from Bet Shean, with the exception of two complete lamps and 25 fragments, were found near the amphitheater in the layer of fill mentioned above (for details, see Type 15). All the lamps were discovered with very laige quantities of Byzantine pottery fragments, many lamps of Types 16-18, 20 and 25, and coins of the fourth-fifth centuries CE. One complete lamp and two fragments were found in L. 65027, the refuse pit near the temple (see above, Type 16). The second complete lamp was discovered in a layer of fill near the Umayyad shopping street (L. 06916) with a complete Type 17 lamp. Some other fragments were also found with lamps of Types 16, 17 and 21 . It appears, therefore, on the basis of the dates of the amphitheater (late fourth century) and the nearby street (522 CE), that all the lamps should be dated to the fifth century CE. These lamps differ in shape and decoration from lamps of Types 16-18, and they do not appear to predate the fifth century CE. It is unclear why almost all the lamps of this type, including 113 complete lamps and the 59 almost complete lamps, appear in the fill. They are still in very good condition and most of them are virtually or entirely unused, in contrast to the pottery, which consists only of fragments. This implies that the lamps were discarded in the early sixth century CE, though the reason for this is not clear. The lamps of this type were ornamented with a seven- branched menorah and geometric designs. The former were apparently used by Jews and Samaritans, though members of other populations may have used the lamps with geometric designs. Type 20 (Nos. 225-241) Sixteen complete lamps, two almost complete lamps and nine fragments of this type were discovered at Bet Shean. They are made from light and dark brown, yellowish- brown, orange-brown and grayish-brown clay, sometimes with black and white grits. Two lamps are made from dark brown clay and fired to dark gray and buff on the surface. Three lamps are red-slipped. All but one of the lamps are decorated. The lamps of this type can be divided into four groups; in the first the decoration is stamped, while in the other three it is in high relief. 50</page><page sequence="57">Local clay lamps, Type 20. 51</page><page sequence="58">Local clay lamps, Type 20 (cont.). 52</page><page sequence="59">Group 1 (Nos. 225-228). Most of the lamps belong to this group. The lamps are decorated with a radial pattern, a stylized branch and triangles. The nozzle is slightly concave on both sides and sometimes ornamented with a stylized branch. These two features connect this type with the three previous ones. The lamps have a flat or slightly sunken base. All have a small knob handle. Group 2 (Nos. 229-231). The lamps of this group are similar in shape to Group 1 lamps. They are decorated with a radial pattern, lines and dots. Group 3 (Nos. 232-237). The lamps of this group have an elongated body. Two of them were made in the same mold; they are decorated with circles and lines and have undefined decoration on the nozzle. The filling hole is surrounded by a circle of short lines. One lamp is decorated with a stylized branch and the nozzle is ornamented with lines. Two other lamps were made in one mold; their decoration, perhaps circles, is very worn and their filling hole was formed by breaking the discus after firing. One lamp is decorated with two strings of dots; its filling hole was formed by breaking the discus. One lamp is decorated with lines and its nozzle is slightly concave on both sides. One lamp is undecorated. All the lamps have a small knob handle, smaller than that of Groups 1-2. The lamps have a ring or a flat base. Group 4 (Nos. 238-241). The lamps in this group are decorated with a stylized branch, two circles of lines, lines between ridges and concentric semicircles. There is a ridge, or on one lamp two ridges, on the nozzle, a feature resembling Type 18 lamps. In three of the four lamps of this group the decoration of the nozzle is set within a frame. The lamps have a very small or large knob handle. The base is a flat or low ring base. Type 20 generally parallels Type IV at Silet edh- Dhahr.133 Two similar lamps from Pella were found in Tomb 5, dated to the fourth-sixth centuries CE. Another lamp of this type, very similar to No. 240, was discovered in Tomb 8 at Pella and dated to the third-fourth centuries CE.134 All the lamps of this type from Bet Shean, except for one fragment, were found near the amphitheater in the thick layer of fill mentioned above (Type 15), with lamps of Types 15-19 and 25. Six complete lamps and one fragment were found in L. 19070, two complete lamps in L. 19025 and one complete lamp and two fragments in L. 99008. The one exception was discovered near the basilica but lacks a clear stratigraphie context. Type 20, like Type 19, can be dated to the fifth century CE. Type 21 (Nos. 242-254) Type 21 at Bet Shean, which like Type 17 is an imitation of Beit Nattif lamps, comprises 23 complete lamps, five almost complete lamps and 57 fragments. They are larger than most Type 17 lamps, except for two lamps that are similar in size to Type 17 but in shape belong to Type 21. The nozzle is not rounded like that of Type 17 but is slightly concave on both sides; in some lamps the edges are smoothed and the nozzle is straight-edged. The nozzle bears its own specific decoration. The lamps are made from light and dark brown, orange-brown, grayish-brown and yellowish-brown clay. One lamp is made from dark gray clay. All but two of the lamps are decorated, most with herring-bone (Nos. 242-243) or a radial pattern (Nos. 244- 248). Three of the lamps with a radial pattern were made in the same mold. Two lamps made in the same mold (No. 249) and one lamp made in a different mold (No. 250) bear scrolls with bunches of grapes. One lamp is decorated with guilloche pattern, one with crescents, two with intertwined triangles and one with large dots. As noted above, one lamp (No. 251) is undecorated and in a second lamp (No. 252) the rim is undecorated while the nozzle bears an amphora. One lamp (No. 253), half of which is preserved, has a small discus, and in one lamp the filling hole is surrounded by a ridge. The nozzle, as noted above, bears a decoration specific to it. In one lamp (No. 254), of which only the nozzle and small part of the rim are preserved, the nozzle is decorated with a seven-branched menorah under an arch and the entire remaining space is filled with stylized branches. On 21 specimens, the design is an amphora from which two bunches of grapes or leaves issue; on the two lamps made in the same mold the nozzle is decorated with a multi-spoked wheel. The other nozzles are decorated with concentric circles, laige raised dots, X and three dots and concentric circles, and undefined decoration between two rows of dots. The specific decoration of the nozzle connects this type with the previous ones. Each of the lamps has a vertical handle, almost always ornamented with a palm branch. The base is undefined, except for three lamps which have a small ring base. In one lamp the entire flat base is decorated with a large stylized branch. Lamps of this type uncovered in excavations have been published only from Pella, where they are very common and are found exclusively in tombs. Some lamps derive from Tomb 5, which was dated by Smith to the fourth-sixth centuries CE, several lamps were discovered in Tomb 6, also dated to the fourth-sixth centuries CE, and several lamps came from Grave 6 of Tomb 7, which also contained Type 28 lamps and was dated by Smith to 525-600 CE.135 Other lamps of this type in private collections have been published.136 At Bet Shean, eight of the 23 complete lamps of Type 21 53</page><page sequence="60">Local clay lamps, Type 2 1 . 54</page><page sequence="61">Local clay lamps, Type 21 (cont.). 55</page><page sequence="62">and some fragments were discovered in two closed shops (Nos. 2, 3) in a row of five shops in the Street of the Monuments. All the lamps were found in the destruction level caused by fire (L. 44561, L. 44566, L. 44588). In this level were found pottery of the Byzantine period (including two anthropomorphic vessels), one Type 4 lamp fragment (No. 10), eight complete lamps and many fragments of Type 22, the two Type 23 lamps, one complete Type 28 lamp, three Type 29 lamps, a few coins of the early Roman period and numerous minimi, the latest of which date from 534-539 CE. These coins date the destruction of the shops. Of these two shops, one (No. 2) was never rebuilt or reused. The second (No. 3) was reused, though not as a shop, in the Abbasid period, when a pit dug in the corner caused limited disturbance to the finds in the destruction level, and again in the Mamluk period. Of the other three shops, one (No. 1) was never rebuilt or reused and the remaining two (Nos. 4, 5) were used in the late Byzantine and Abbasid-Mamluk periods. Eight complete lamps, one almost complete lamp and some fragments were found in and around the amphitheater. One of the complete lamps was discovered in a vomitorium north of the western entrance to the amphitheater (L. 242), which was in use until the beginning of the twentieth century. The lamp and the pottery found with it, which includes a complete Type 43 lamp and dates mainly from •the fifth to thirteenth centuries CE, were mixed with the soil and stones that filled the vomitorium. A lamp made in the same mold was discovered in a room built north of the Byzantine street near the amphitheater (L. 39043) with pottery of the Byzantine period, another almost complete lamp of Type 21, lamps of Types 22 and 24, and coins of the fifth century CE. Another complete lamp was discovered in L. 09051 with lamps of Types 17 and 19, and two complete lamps were found together in a room (L. 09001) with Byzantine pottery. One fragment was recov- ered from the arena (L. 254) in the same basket as a Type 28 lamp fragment. Some of the lamp fragments were discovered in a room and open space near it south of the rear wall of the nymphaeum (L. 54214, L. 54215), in the Byzantine occupation level. The lamps were found with pottery dated to the period between the mid-fifth and early sixth centuries CE. The numismatic evidence includes more than one hundred coins: the earliest is of the mid-third century CE, most are minimi of the fourth-fifth centuries CE, while the latest is an M coin (512-539 CE). As mentioned above (Type 16), one complete lamp and a few fragments were discovered in a refuse pit east of the temple square (L. 65027) with a similar numismatic assemblage. Another complete lamp was found near the temple (L. 05070) with an almost complete Type 16 lamp. Two complete lamps were discovered under the mosaic floor of one of the shops (L. 37013) in the Umayyad shopping street built on the Byzantine structure Silvanus Hall, with one complete Type 28 lamp, minimi of the fifth century CE and one M coin (512-518 CE). On the basis of the assemblages from Bet Shean, therefore, Type 21 can be dated to the fifth-early sixth centuries CE. Type 22 (Nos. 255-270) Lamps of this type can be defined as the last remnant of the Beit Nattif imitations. The nozzle is still slightly concave on both sides, but is less clumsy than in Type 21 lamps: it is straight-edged, almost rectangular in shape, and not as high as in Type 21 lamps. The lamps have a large filling hole. Fourteen complete lamps, two almost complete lamps and 41 fragments of Type 22 were discovered at Bet Shean.137 The lamps include three pairs that were made in the same mold. The lamps are made from light gray, grayish-brown, light and dark brown, and orange-brown clay; some are slipped with red, reddish-brown or brown slip. The lamps are 8.1-11.3 cm long. One is undecorated (No. 255), and the ornamentation found on the remainder of the lamps can be divided into three types. Geometric decoration (Nos. 256-258): most of the lamps are decorated with geometric patterns including raised dots, ridges, ridges and dots, intertwined triangles filled with dots, half circles and dots, two strings of raised dots and radial pattern, sometimes with dots. Two of the lamps have a string of dots around the filling hole. A few have undefined decoration. Vegetal decoration (No. 259): several lamps are deco- rated with bunches of grapes (No. 259) or a stylized tree. Zoomorphic decoration (No. 260): two lamps made in the same mold are decorated with a bird on either side of a palm tree. One complete lamp (No. 261) and one fragment (No. 262) have an exceptional decoration; the entire lamp is in the shape of a schematic human face. The conical handle is the nose, with an eye on either side. At the edge of the lamp is the hair, and on the nozzle is the beard. All but two of the lamps preserve the nozzle decoration characteristic of Beit Nattif lamps, which differs from that on the rim: a five-branched menorah (No. 263), a palm tree with hanging branches (No. 264), a stylized branch, a female face (No. 265), a schematic human face in high relief (No. 260), ridges and dots, ridges and a triangle, a triangle filled with dots, circles and two semicircles composed from dots. On the two exceptions the decoration of the nozzle is part of that of the lamp as a whole; these lamps are decorated with raised dots (No. 266) and a foliated guilloche pattern (No. 267). All but three lamps have a conical handle; one lamp had a loop handle, which is 56</page><page sequence="63">Local clay lamps, Type 22. 57</page><page sequence="64">Local clay lamps, Type 22 (cont.). 58</page><page sequence="65">Local clay lamps, Type 22 (cont.). 59</page><page sequence="66">Local clay lamps, Type 22 (cont.). 60</page><page sequence="67">not preserved (No. 268), and the other two have a vertical handle (Nos. 269-270). In most cases the base is not defined, but a few lamps have a small ring base. These lamps are widespread only in northern Palestine and Transjordan. They are among the lamps discovered in the hoard in one of the two pits in Catacomb 24 at Beth She'arim: of about five hundred complete lamps and hundreds of lamp fragments discovered in this pit, 280 lamps, were of this type (220 with a vertical handle and 60 with a conical handle). The lamps were dated by Mazar to the third-fourth centuries CE.138 Elgavish, on the basis of the numismatic record that includes about thirteen coins of the emperors of the sixth century CE, the latest of Justin II (565-578 CE), assigned the lamp assemblage in this catacomb to the second half of the sixth century CE. However, he noted that the type itself is not limited to this period, and the coins were discovered not in the pit where the lamps were found, but in the second pit, which was disturbed.139 At Silet edh-Dhahr the lamps were dated by Sellers and Baramki to the fourth or beginning of the fifth century CE.140 At al-Jish the tombs containing these lamps were dated by Makhouly to the fourth-fifth centuries CE.141 This type parallels Type L6 at Capernaum, the most common type there, dated by Loffreda to the Byzantine period (450-638 CE).142 At Sepphoris too this type is among the most common.143 Lamps of this type were also found at Geva144 and Hammat Gader.145 A lamp of this type was discovered in Tomb 5 at Pella, dated by Smith to the fourth-sixth centuries CE.146 Some Type 22 lamps are in the Schioessinger collection;147 one is in the shape of a humaii face, like lamp No. 262 from Bet Shean. At Bet Shean, eight of the 14 complete lamps of Type 22 and many fragments were discovered in the destruction level in the two shops in the Street of the Monuments mentioned above (for a description, see Type 21). The lamp with the loop handle was found near the Central Monument (L. 560) with an almost complete lamp of Type 22, a complete Type 17 lamp and two fragments of Types 16 and 32. One complete lamp was found in a room north of the Byzantine street near the amphitheater (L. 39043) with pottery of the Byzantine period, complete lamps and fragments of Types 21 and 24, and coins of the fifth century CE. Three complete lamps and three fragments of this type were discovered with two complete Type 28 lamps and two complete Type 35 lamps near the entrance of the vault adjacent to the basilica, in a mixed layer of alluvium. Byzantine and Umayyad pottery and coins, most of which cannot be identified, were found with the lamps. Three fragments were found in the refuse pit near the temple mentioned above (Type 16). On the basis of the finds from Bet Shean, Type 22 can be dated, like Type 21, to the fifth- early sixth centuries CE. Type 23 (Nos. 271-272) These lamps are characterized by their rounded body and short rectangular nozzle, similar to the nozzle of Type 22 lamps. They have a decorated discus and a pyramidal knob handle. Since the discus is decorated with geometric designs, crosses or menorot, they were apparently used by all the communities of Palestine. One almost complete lamp (after restoration) (No. 271) and one fragment (No. 272) were discovered. They are made from grayish-brown and yellowish-brown clay and are decorated with a radial pattern, the typical ornamentation of these lamps. The decorated discus was broken to form a large filling hole. The almost complete lamp has a low ring base. Lamps and molds of Type 23 were discovered in Caesarea and dated to the sixth or early seventh century CE.148 The finding of molds may indicate that this city was the production center of this lamp type. Lamps were also found in a tomb near Caesarea,149 at Sepphoris150 and at Horvat 'Aqav (Ramat Hanadiv).151 One lamp was found at Jalame,152 one lamp was published from Capernaum,153 one lamp was discovered in the synagogue at Ma'on in Judea154 and one lamp was discovered in the synagogue at 'En Gedi and dated to the second half of the fifth-early sixth centuries CE.155 A few lamps are in private collections.156 The two lamps from Bet Shean were found together in L. 44566, the destruction level of shop No. 2 in the Street of the Monuments mentioned above (see Type 21), which was never rebuilt or reused. Type 23 can be dated, like Types 21-22, to the fifth-early sixth centuries CE. Type 24 (Nos. 273-280) Lamps of this type are included among those defined as "Samaritan".157 Four complete lamps, five almost complete lamps and ten fragments were found at Bet Shean, two made in the same mold. They are made from yellowish- brown and light and dark gray clay. One is red-slipped. One lamp is decorated with vegetal designs, including stylized flowers; the others are decorated with geometric patterns formed by lines, semicircles filled with lines, dots and lines, and concentric circles. On the two lamps made in the same mold the rim is divided into two by a ridge; the upper area is decorated with triangles and dots and the lower contains a linear design. Another fragment is decorated with lines in the upper part and a row of dots between two ridges under it. Four lamps are ornamented with ladder design on both sides of the nozzle, a decoration that is characteristic of these lamps. The filling hole is sometimes surrounded by a pronounced ridge; in several lamps it was formed by breaking the discus after firing.158 Some of the lamps have a well-defined channel along the 61</page><page sequence="68">Local clay lamps, Type 23 (Nos. 271-272); Type 24 (Nos. 273-275). 62</page><page sequence="69">Local clay lamps, Type 24 (cont.). 63</page><page sequence="70">nozzle, on some the area of the channel is defined by ridges, and on others the channel area is not defined at all. On a few lamps the nozzle is slightly concave on both sides. All the lamps have a horizontal handle, which is sometimes rectangular and sometimes ends in a point. One lamp has a small raised handle, flattened at the back. The base is a small ring base, sometimes slightly sunken. This type parallels Elgavish's Type 52, dated to the fourth-fifth centuries CE.159 Forty lamps were discovered at Silet edh-Dhahr and dated by Sellers and Baramki to the fourth-sixth centuries CE.160 Lamps of this type were discovered at Kefar 'Ara and also dated to the fourth-sixth centuries CE.161 This type parallels Type I at Apollonia- Arsuf.162 Many lamps of this type found in Kefar Sava were dated to the fifth-sixth centuries CE.163 Several lamps were found at Samaria,164 Lehavot Haviva,165 Geva,166 in the mausoleum near Kibbutz Mesilot167 and in a burial cave on Mt. Gilboa.168 This type parallels Types 22e, 28a and 28c at Caesarea.169 At Bet Shean, all the lamps of Type 24, except for one almost complete example and three fragments, were discovered near the amphitheater and the Byzantine street adjacent to it. One complete lamp was discovered under the floor of a room built northeast of the amphitheater, close to the Byzantine street (L. 19004). The lamp was found with pottery of the Byzantine period, lamps of Types 15, 19 and 22, and coins of Constantius II (354-361 CE) and of the fifth century CE. One complete lamp and one fragment were found in a room near the amphitheater (L. 39043) with Byzantine pottery, lamps of Types 21 and 22, and coins of the fifth century CE. Another complete lamp was discovered with Byzantine pottery in a room near the amphitheater (L. 39060). One of the two lamps made in the same mold was discovered in a room built in the central apse of the Monument of Antonius (L. 64569); the second was discovered in the residential quarter to the north of the Byzantine street adjacent to the amphitheater (L. 376). The former was found below the stone pavement of the room; four coins were also discovered in the same level, a coin of the fourth century CE and three K coins of Justin II (565- 578 CE). Type 24 can therefore be dated to the fifth-sixth centuries CE. Type 25 (Nos. 281-282) The lamps of this type are characterized by an elongated body and a nozzle that is slightly concave on both sides. The nozzle sometimes bears a cross. One complete lamp and one fragment of Type 25 were found at Bet Shean. The .complete lamp (No. 281) is made from light brown clay and is slipped with reddish-brown slip, of which only traces remain. The rim is decorated with a radial pattern and two stylized flowers near the nozzle. The nozzle is decorated with lines and dots in high relief. The lamp fragment (No. 282) is made from orange-brown clay and slipped with reddish-brown slip, of which only traces remain. The rim is ornamented with intertwined triangles filled with dots. The lamps have a small vertical handle decorated with lines, and a low ring base. At Hammat Gader 43 lamps of this type were discovered and dated to the mid-fifth-sixth centuries CE.170 These lamps are quite common at Gadara and were defined by da Costa as "North Jordan lamps"; they were dated by da Costa to the late fifth-early seventh centuries CE171 and by Nielsen to the late Byzantine period.172 Since Hammat Gader was part of Gadara,173 their occurrence at both sites is not surprising. A lamp of this type found at Khirbet al- Kiliya in Samaria was dated to the sixth-seventh centuries CE.174 This type parallels Type L8 at Capernaum.175 At Abila it was dated by Mare to the fourth-sixth centuries CE176 and by Fuller to the Byzantine period.177 A lamp of this type is in the Damascus Museum.178 At Bet Shean the complete Type 25 lamp was found near the amphitheater, in the fill that raised the amphitheater's ground level to that of the street built nearby (see above, Type 15). Fourteen Type 19 lamps and one complete Type 17 lamp were discovered in the same locus (L. 99231). The lamp fragment was discovered in the rubble that covered the Umayyad shopping street following the earthquake of . 749 CE. After the earthquake this area fell into disuse; one of the collapsed arcades of the shops was found in this locus (L. 715). The pottery assemblage is Byzantine- Abbasid and the numismatic finds are Roman-Umayyad. On the basis of the finds from Bet Shean and the above-mentioned sites, Type 25 can be dated to the fifth-sixth and perhaps early seventh centuries CE. Type 26 (No. 283) Only the handle and a small part of the rim of one lamp of Type 26 were recovered at Bet Shean. The lamp is made from light brown clay and is slipped with reddish-brown slip, of which only traces remain. The handle is cross- shaped, and the rim is decorated with rows of dots set between two vertical ridges. The filling hole is surrounded by three ridges and a string of dots. Cross-shaped handles were discovered at Sepphoris,179 Samaria,180 Geva181 and Karm al-Shaikh.182 A cross- shaped handle also appears on Type 28 lamps, which differ in both clay and decoration from Type 26. 183 Two cross- shaped handles bearing Greek inscriptions were published by Loffreda.184 This lamp fragment from Bet Shean was discovered in a layer of fill near the western entrance to the amphitheater 64</page><page sequence="71">Local clay lamps, Type 25 (Nos. 281-282); Type 26 (No. 283); Type 27 (Nos. 284-286); Type 28 (Nos. 287-289). 65</page><page sequence="72">(L. 240). The numismatic finds include coins ranging from the fourth century CE to the Arab-Byzantine period. The pottery assemblage is primarily Byzantine, with some Umayyad ware. This lamp cannot be dated on the basis of the context in which it was found, but because of its Christian character a date of the fifth-sixth and perhaps early seventh centuries CE may be proposed. Type 27 (Nos. 284-286) Four handles of this type were discovered at Bet Shean. One is triangular and leaf-shaped and decorated with a branch (No. 284), and the other three are rounded and decorated with a cross (Nos. 285-286). In two handles, which are identical, the cross is composed from four triangles in high relief, while the third handle is similar in decoration but has a line between the triangles. In the lamps of this type, a loop used for carrying the lamp was attached to the body below the decorated part of the handle. The lamps are made from orange-light brown clay. Examination of the distribution pattern of the few published lamps of this type from Palestine points to their originating in and around Jerusalem, with only a few occurring at other sites. On the Hill of the Ophel185 and in the Tyropoeon Valley186 some handles were discovered, one of them similar to the triangular handle from Bet Shean. A handle from the Armenian Garden was dated by Tushingham to the Byzantine HIB period (the first quarter of the seventh century CE).187 At "Dominus Flevit" these lamps were dated by Bagatti and Milik to the Byzantine period,188 and at Ramat Rahel they were dated to the sixth- seventh centuries CE.189 At a farm near Jerusalem a handle was found with Type 28 lamps.190 Some of the handles from Jerusalem were dated by Magness to the mid-sixth- late seventh/early eighth centuries CE.191 Some handles were also discovered at Khirbet Siyar al-Ghanam, near Jerusalem,192 at Mishor Adummim, also near Jerusalem,193 at Hammat Gader194 and Horvat 'Aqav (Ramat Hana- div).195 Lamps of this type were also discovered in Transjordan; at Pella a complete lamp was discovered in Tomb 5, dated to the fourth-sixth centuries CE, another handle found in the West Church complex was dated to the fifth-sixth centuries CE, and another handle was dated to the sixth-early seventh centuries CE.196 A few handles were discovered at Jerash.197 At Gadara a handle of this type was dated to the early Byzantine period.198 Single handles are published from Abila,199 Dibon (dated to the Byzantine period)200 and Mount Nebo.201 A handle in the British Museum originating from Egypt was dated by Bailey to the sixth-seventh centuries CE.202 At Bet Shean, one handle was found in the foundation of the pavement of the Byzantine Silvanus Street which was repaired in the Umayyad period (L. 75524). The pottery is of the Byzantine-Umayyad periods and the numismatic finds include coins whose date ranges between 575 CE and 696-750 CE. One handle was discovered in debris of stones and columns over Valley Street (L. 94601). One handle was found in the central alley of the Abbasid quarter (L. 04629) and the fourth handle was discovered near the nymphaeum, in a Mamluk level (L. 54429). Type 27 lamps cannot be dated on stratigraphie grounds, but in view of their Christian character a date of the fifth-sixth and perhaps early seventh centuries CE may be suggested. Type 28 (Nos. 287-298) Lamps of this type are characterized by their elongated pear shape. The nozzle is decorated with a palm branch, or more rarely a candlestick on a tripod or a cross (Nos. 287-290). One nozzle (No. 291) is decorated with the Greek letter 3&gt;. The palm branch decoration, which was defined by Macalister as a candlestick, has given these lamps the name of "candlestick lamps".203 Four complete lamps, one almost complete lamp and 42 fragments were discovered at Bet Shean. The lamps are made from light brown and orange-brown clay. Their length is 8-10 cm. All have linear designs, except for seven fragments on which part of a Greek inscription is preserved.204 The best-preserved one (No. 292) parallels Loffreda's Type B 1.1, which bears the inscription &lt;põ&gt;ç XpiaToú (paívei itãaiv ("the light of Christ shines for an") 2°5 Fragment No. 293 parallels Loffreda's Type C 7.3a, with the inscription (ptímaov |xe (ptímaov ("shine upon me").206 Lamp No. 294 parallels Loffreda's Type C 7.1, with the inscription Xiàxvoç eptímaov jie ("O lamp, shine upon me").207 Fragment No. 295 bears the letters A Q; it generally parallels Loffreda's Type D 4 and is similar to Type D 4.2.208 Lamp No. 296 parallels Loffreda's Type D 2.5a, which bears the letter Í2 (&lt;p&amp;ç, "light") or E (Ztonp, "Saviour").209 Fragment No. 297 parallels Loffreda's Type D 6.4.210 Fragment No. 291 parallels Loffreda's Type D 5.7, lamps that bear the letter O (&lt;p&amp;ç, "light") on the nozzle.211 Fragment No. 298 is undefined. All the nozzles are ornamented with a palm branch, except for one decorated with a candlestick on a tripod and the fragment decorated with the Greek letter O. One lamp has a well-defined channel along the nozzle; such lamps are very rare. Three lamps have a very small knob handle, and one lamp has a raised dot in place of a handle. All the lamps have a high ring base. Lamps of this type from Jerusalem were dated by Magness to the mid-sixth-late seventh/early eighth cen- turies CE.212 Only two lamps were discovered at Hammat Gader.2 13 At Pella these lamps were dated to the fifth-sixth 66</page><page sequence="73">Local clay lamps, Type 28 (cont.). 67</page><page sequence="74">centuries CE, continuing until the second quarter of the eighth century CE.214 At Jerash they were dated by Zayadine to the fifth-sixth centuries CE and no later than the mid-seventh century CE,215 by Scholl to the second half of the sixth and first half of the seventh centuries CE,216 and by Uscatescu Barrón to the fifth-seventh centuries CE.217 Lamps of this type were found in the Umayyad citadel and O 1 Ô o 1 o in the great temple in Amman and at Abila. Many were found in tombs near Irbid, dated to the end of the Byzantine period (end of the sixth-first half of the seventh centuries CE).220 Inscribed and uninscribed lamps were found on Mount Nebo.221 Lamps of this type were discovered at Umm al-Rasas.222 An inscribed lamp was found under the Umayyad period collapse of the earthquake of 749 CE at Busrā in the Hauran.223 An inscribed lamp is in the Damascus Museum.224 At Bet Shean, two complete lamps were found in L. 07061 and L. 95701, the layer of alluvium formed by running water at the entrance to the vault adjacent to the Roman basilica (see above, Type 22). One complete lamp was discovered in L. 44588, the destruction layer of shop No. 3 in the Street of the Monuments (see above, Type 21). One complete lamp was found with two complete Type 21 lamps under the mosaic floor of one of the Umayyad shops built on the Byzantine structure Silvanus Hall (L. 37013). The almost complete lamp was discovered in an Umayyad .room built in a Roman shop (L. 94541). This lamp was found in the occupation level with Umayyad pottery and late Roman and Umayyad coins. On the basis of the finds from all the above-mentioned sites, this type started to appear in the fifth century CE and continued in use in the Umayyad period, perhaps to its end. Type 29 (Nos. 299-312) Type 29 is the only lamp type on which the name of the city of manufacture (Jerash) and the date of production appear on a few examples,225 pointing to this city as a center of production for these lamps, though none of the lamps from Bet Shean is inscribed. Complete specimens and fragments and lamp wasters were found at Jerash in the lamp-maker's factory in front of the temple of Artemis, and in the kilns discovered near the hippodrome and in the North Theater.226 Lamp molds were found in the lamp-maker's factory in front of the temple of Artemis, in the hippodrome, in the Church of Bishop Marianos and in a residential area by the south decumanus.227 At Bet Shean two complete lamps (one after restoration), two almost complete lamps (after restoration) and 27 fragments were discovered. They are made from dark brown, orange-brown, yellowish-brown and light and dark gray clay. One lamp is made from brown clay which acquired a gray tone after firing. The ornamentation is generally uniform, with a radial design on the rim (Nos. 299-301), though on one lamp the rim is decorated with triangles filled with lines (No. 302). One of the complete lamps (No. 303) is ornamented in a slightly different way: a long branch runs alongside and parallel to the radial decoration, and two branches and geometric decorations appear on either side of the handle. In two lamps the filling hole is surrounded by a wavy line. Though none of the lamps from Bet Shean is inscribed, these lamps sometimes bear Greek and Kufic inscriptions, including one lamp with a Greek inscription on the rim and a Kufic inscription on the base.228 These lamps appear both with and without a channel between the filling hole and the wick hole. One lamp has a well-defined channel (No. 303), and in one lamp its area is defined by two lines (No. 300). In the other seven lamps whose nozzle is preserved there is no channel, and its place is taken by a uniform decoration of three lines, the outer two of which are rounded at one end. Near the lines there are dots or concentric circles (Nos. 304-306). The handle of these lamps is their characteristic feature: a high handle usually ends in an undefined zoomorphic head (Nos. 307-310). Eleven handles are preserved: one is high and elongated and decorated with two parallel lines; one is decorated with a schematic animal face formed by four holes; eight handles end in an undefined zoomorphic head; and another is similar in shape but undecorated. Six handles are ornamented with a cross, while the others are decorated with lines and circles, straight lines and geometric designs. The base is preserved in 1 1 examples. Two lamps have a small plain ring base. In two lamps the ring base is decorated with two pairs of volutes (No. 303), and in one with four pairs of volutes. One ring base is decorated with four straight lines, two of which are rounded at one end (No. 311). One ring base bears the Greek letter O (&lt;pœç, "light") appearing twice and concentric circles and geo- metric designs (No. 301). One base fragment, which follows the outline of the lamp, is decorated with a stylized branch and geometric designs (No. 312). The remaining three ring bases are fragmentary.229 Some of the lamps, including the two complete lamps and one almost complete lamp, are unused, as indicated by the absence of soot around the wick hole. This type also includes miniature lamps and polylychnoi with four and five wick holes; such lamps were found at Jerash and published by Scholl.230 In addition to lamps, two molds used in the manufacture of this type were found at Bet Shean (see Chapter 2), though none of the lamps found at the site was manufactured in either of these molds. One of the molds was for a lamp with a decorated base, a variant which is 68</page><page sequence="75">Local clay lamps, Type 29. 69</page><page sequence="76">Local clay lamps, Type 29 (cont.) (Nos. 304-312); Type 30 (Nos. 313-316). 70</page><page sequence="77">very rare even at Jerash, and at Bet Shean only one decorated base fragment was found. Lamps of this type were first published by Clermont- Ganneau.231 Day discusses them in her article on Early Islamic and Christian lamps, assigning all the types of Jerash lamps to the Umayyad period.232 According to McCown, this type may have begun in the fourth or more probably the fifth century CE,233 while in Zayadine's opinion these lamps first appeared at Jerash in the sixth century and continued in use in the Umayyad period.234 A detailed study of the different lamp types found in the excavations at Jerash was made by Scholl. The complete lamp with the elongated handle parallels Scholl's Group II, characterized by lamps with raised, curved handle. In Scholl's opinion this group dates from the second half of the seventh century CE, but may have already been in use at the end of the sixth century.235 The lamps from Bet Shean whose handles end in a zoomorphic head and are decorated with a cross parallel Scholl's Group III, one of the common groups at Jerash. This group was dated by Scholl from the end of the first half of the seventh to the mid-eighth centuries CE.236 The lamps from Bet Shean whose handles end in a zoomorphic head but lack a cross parallel Scholl's Group IV, Subgroup 2, dated by him to the second half of the seventh century CE.237 The second complete lamp with the channel parallels Group V, which Scholl dated from the end of the first half to the beginning of the second half of the eighth century CE.238 The lamp whose handle is decorated with a schematic face formed by four holes lacks parallels, and the shape of the channel is unique too. The latest excavations at Jerash indicate, according to Kehrberg, that lamps with zoomorphic handles appear in equal numbers in assemblages of the sixth century and those of the first half of the eighth century CE. The lamps paralleling Scholl's Group III can be dated, in Kehrberg' s opinion, to the period between the end of the sixth and the first half of the eighth centuries CE.239 Other lamps were found in the sanctuary of Zeus and in the macellum at Jerash.240 Lamps of this type were also found at Pella; a complete lamp was discovered in Tomb 7 and dated to the seventh century, probably prior to 675 CE. Another lamp fragment was dated to the sixth-seventh centuries CE. Such lamps are the most common type found in the Umayyad stratum in the West Church complex; they were dated to the early years of the eighth century CE. Other lamps from Pella were dated to the first quarter of the eighth century CE 241 In Amman lamps of this type were discovered in the Umayyad citadel, in the earthquake destruction level of 749 CE in a building, in an Umayyad church and in the great temple.242 One lamp fragment is published from Abila,243 and fragments were found on Mount Nebo.244 In the Hauran, lamps of this type were discovered at Busrā in the Umayyad stratum destroyed in the earthquake of 749 CE,245 and a few lamps were found at Umm al-Jimāl.246 In Palestine these lamps are rare. They have been discovered in the tomb at al-Bassa,247 in the theater pottery workshop at Bet Shean,248 at Hammat Gader,249 Sep- phoris250 and Capernaum,251 and in the Monastery of Theodoras and Kyriakos on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem252 Other lamps of this type are in museums and private collections.253 At Bet Shean, three lamps (one complete, one almost complete and one fragmentary) were found together in L. 44561 and L. 44566, the destruction layer of shop No. 2 in the Street of the Monuments mentioned above (see Type 21), with lamps of Types 4, 21-23 and 28. This shop, as noted above, was destroyed in the early sixth century CE and never rebuilt or reused. The complete and the almost complete lamp were unused; the third is a rim fragment. Another complete lamp (after restoration) was discovered in L. 54159, one of a row of shops in the Umayyad shopping street built in 738 CE, destroyed in the earthquake of 749 CE and not reconstructed. This lamp too is unused and may date from a short time before the destruction. Most of the other lamp fragments were found in Umayyad contexts, some of them with lamps of Types 35 and 36. None of the lamps was found in a clear Abbasid context, and only a few fragments lacked stratigraphie contexts. On the basis of the finds from the excavations at Bet Shean, this type of lamps first appeared in the fifth or early sixth century CE and was in use at Bet Shean until the end of the Umayyad period. In Jordan and the Hauran, however, these lamps continued in use into the Abbasid period; at Pella254 and Busrā255 they occurred in strata of the beginning of the Abbasid period (the second half of the eighth-beginning of the ninth centuries CE). The difference in numbers between the lamps of the Byzantine and Umayyad periods (three and 28 respectively) show that this type was more numerous at Bet Shean in the Umayyad period, though Types 35 and 36 were the main types in use at Bet Shean in this period. The very limited distribution of Type 29 lamps in Palestine as opposed to their wide distribution in Jordan, especially in the Byzantine and Umayyad periods, indicates that they were in limited demand in Palestine, whose inhabitants preferred the Type 36 lamp in the Umayyad period. Type 29 is the only lamp type that first appeared in the Byzantine period and continued in use until the beginning of the Abbasid period, without any striking changes. Type 30 (Nos. 313-316) Five fragments of this type were discovered at Bet Shean. The lamps are made from light and dark brown, orange- brown and grayish- and reddish-brown clay. One is red- 71</page><page sequence="78">slipped. The largest fragment (No. 313), comprising half of the lamp, is decorated with scales and dots. In all the lamps of this type a ridge, which extends to the wick hole and forms a wide channel, separates the rim from the small, slightly sunken discus, which in this lamp bears unclear decoration. The base follows the shape of the lamp and is decorated with a cross. One fragment (No. 314) is orna- mented with geometric designs and a cross; only a small part of the channel, which is decorated (with a cross?), is preserved. Another fragment is decorated with geometric designs and its discus with intertwined triangle. No. 315 is ornamented with rhombi and dots and the discus is undecorated. There are three ridges around the small filling hole, and the joint of the upper and lower halves is covered with a layer of clay. No. 316 is decorated with a vegetal design in high relief, which extends to the wide channel; the discus is decorated with a cross composed from four trian- gles in high relief. The three preserved handles are small pyramidal handles that actually constitute part of the ridge. Type 30 is widespread in northern Palestine and Lebanon, as well as Cyprus.256 Lamps of this type were discovered in the tomb at al-Bassa, from which they take their name, with lamps of Types 28 and 29. This tomb was dated by Iliffe to 396 CE.257 This type parallels Elgavish's Type 58, which he dated on the basis of the hoard from Catacomb 24 at Beth She'arim, where about 175 lamps of this type were discovered, to the second half of the sixth century CE.258 A lamp of this type was also discovered in Avigad's excavations at Beth She'arim and dated to the late sixth-beginning of the seventh centuries CE.259 Lamps of this type were found in a tomb near Metula.260 This type parallels Type 30a at Caesarea.261 An unusual fragment was discovered on the coaśt at Caesarea; it is decorated with impressions of coins minted in the first half of the seventh . century CE.262 This type parallels Sussman's Type 8.263 At Bet Shean, the best-preserved lamp was discovered in the entrance of the vaults under the temple (L. 94005), which were in use until the beginning of the twentieth century. One fragment was found in an Umayyad level near the rear wall of the Umayyad shops (L. 65509). Another fragment was recovered from L. 75005 in the same basket as a Type 36 lamp fragment, and a Type 29 lamp fragment and a complete Type 35 lamp were also found in this locus. Two fragments were found in a layer of fill near the temple (L. 85001). The lamps from Bet Shean were not found in clear stratigraphie contexts that permit their dating; a date of the sixth to mid- seventh centuries CE is suggested for this type. Type 31 (Nos. 317-319) Lamps of this type were wheel-made in an era when lamps were mold-made, with the exception of one Hellenistic type (Type 1) and one early Roman type (Type 4). From the ninth century CE onwards wheel-made lamps became the rule (see Types 38-43 and 47-51 below). At Bet Shean two complete lamps, one almost complete lamp (after restoration) and five fragments of Type 31 were discovered.264 They are made from light brown, orange- brown and reddish-brown clay. Three lamps have a ribbed body (Nos. 317-318) and three have a smooth body (No. 319); of the seventh and eighth lamps, only the nozzle is preserved. A loop handle is drawn from the rim to the lower part of the body. The lamps have a nozzle that protrudes from the body. The base is flat. One of the complete lamps (No. 317) was unused, as indicated by the absence of soot on the nozzle. These lamps are widespread only in southern Palestine, with few published examples coming from the north.265 One lamp fragment was discovered at Caesarea.266 At Masada these lamps, which according to Barag and Hershkovitz reflect Sasanian influence, were dated no earlier than the late sixth-early seventh centuries CE.267 Lamps of this type, including one with multiple nozzles, were discovered at Tel Mefalsim near Gaza.268 Such lamps were also found at Upper Zohar, an early Byzantine fort near the Dead Sea.269 This type of lamp was found at Aqaba and dated there to the late Byzantine period.270 One lamp of this type was discovered on Mount Nebo,271 and an example from Cyprus was published by Oziol.272 At Bet Shean one complete lamp of Type 31 was discovered in the arena, near the Umayyad kilns built in the amphitheater (L. 19065), with pottery of the Byzantine and Umayyad periods and coins of the fourth century CE, Arab- Byzantine and Umayyad periods. The unused complete lamp was found in a layer of alluvium in Northwest Street (L. 16135) with pottery of the Byzantine through Mamluk periods. The almost complete lamp was discovered on the floor of an Umayyad building which was constructed above the cryptoporticus (L. 05574); Umayyad pottery was found with it. One lamp fragment was discovered in the Byzantine public structure near Northwest Street (L. 26001), with pottery of the Byzantine and Umayyad periods. The second lamp fragment comes from a layer of fill under the paving of a room near the Umayyad shopping street (L. 75575). Byzantine pottery, seven coins of the fifth century CE and one coin of 500-640 CE were found with this lamp. The third lamp fragment was discovered in a room near the nymphaeum, in the occupation level dating to the Mamluk period (L. 54409). The fourth lamp fragment was found near the temple (L. 886) with pottery of the Umayyad through Mamluk periods. The fifth lamp fragment was discovered in a Mamluk level (L. 45601) above the shops in the Street of the Monuments destroyed in the early sixth century CE (see above, Type 21). 72</page><page sequence="79">Local clay lamps, Type 3 1 . 73</page><page sequence="80">On the basis of the finds from Bet Shean and the other sites, Type 31 can be dated to the late Byzantine period. It apparently continued in use in the Umayyad period, perhaps only in the early part of this period. Type 32 (Nos. 320-336) The lamps of this type, which are among those defined as "Samaritan",273 can be divided into two variants. They differ from one another only in the shape of the filling hole: Variant 1 (Nos. 320-326) has a round filling hole, while in Variant 2 (Nos. 327-332) it is horseshoe-shaped. The surface area of the lamps is divided in a uniform fashion, with variations in decoration occurring at the back of the lamp near the handle, apart from a few exceptional examples (see below). The rim is ornamented with herring-bone pattern on both sides of the channel. This decoration is demarcated by a row of dots, lines, semicircles or a circle at the lamp's mid-section. From this point another decoration begins, consisting of net pattern, stylized flowers, multi-spoked wheels, vertical herring-bone pattern, two rows of lines or a radial design. In a few lamps the filling hole is surrounded by a string of dots. The lamps are made from light brown, orange-brown, yellowish-brown and light and dark gray clay. A few are made from orange- brown clay that acquired a gray tone after firing. Variant 1 comprises two complete lamps, eleven almost complete lamps (except for the handle or a small part of rim or base) and 34 fragments. Eight lamps were made in a single mold, and two other lamps in another mold. Two other lamps (Nos. 325-326) were made in the same mold, but differ from one another in the shape of their handle. Eight complete lamps and 18 fragments belong to Variant 2; two of these were made in the same mold. Four additional bases might belong to either variant. Among Variant 1 lamps, one is unusual in its ornamentation; No. 333 is decorated entirely with vegetal ornamentation consisting of a branch with leaves. Near its wick hole there are bunches of grapes. Among Variant 2 lamps a few are unusual in shape and decoration. No. 334, half of which is preserved, is ornamented with an object resembling an eleven-branched menorah, which appears on either side of the lamp. Next to the horizontal handle is an additional object resembling a menorah standing on a rectangle decorated with net design. The lamp is biconical in section and a thick pronounced ridge surrounds the filling hole. In No. 335, the rim is decorated only by a ridge that divides it into two, and the lamp's mid-section is decorated by an X and dots within a square. In one lamp the rim is ornamented with herring-bone pattern, and the lamp's mid- section is decorated with an X within a square. No. 336 is unique in its size: it is 12.4 cm long and 4.4 cm high. The lamp is adorned with herring-bone pattern in opposing directions and a decorated rectangle at the mid-section. In one fragment the rim is decorated only with a radial pattern. In all the Variant 1 lamps the channel is undecorated. Among the 20 lamps of Variant 2 whose nozzle is preserved, in ten the channel is undecorated and in the other ten the channel is decorated with geometric and floral designs. The channel of Variant 2 is wider than that of Variant 1. Most of the preserved handles are small horizontal handles, sometimes curved. One lamp has a raised handle, which is not completely preserved. One lamp has a large tongue handle. Three types of base are characteristic of these lamps: an undefined base, a base that follows the outline of the lamp, and a base whose pronounced ridge mirrors the upper part of the lamp with the filling hole and the channel. This type parallels Elgavish's Type 54, dated to the fifth- sixth centuries CE and continuing to the early Islamic period.274 At Samaria lamps of this type were dated by Reisner to the Byzantine period,275 whereas Crowfoot believed that they first appeared in the third-fourth centuries CE and continued in use in the Islamic period.276 Lamps of this type discovered at Kefar 'Ara were dated by Sussman to the end of the Byzantine period, with several lamps continuing, with some changes, into the early Islamic period.277 At Apollonia-Arsuf this type was dated by Sussman to the fifth-seventh centuries CE, continuing to the early Islamic period.278 At Beth She'arim a lamp of this type was dated by Avigad to about the end of the seventh century CE.279 Lamps of this type were also found at Lehavot Haviva,280 Geva,281 Caesarea,282 Hammat Gader283 and Capernaum.284 At Pella one lamp was discovered in Tomb 7, which was in use between 521/2 and the end of the seventh century CE. According to Smith, this lamp is the latest in this tomb. Another lamp from Pella was dated to the late Umayyad period.285 A lamp of this type was discovered in the Umayyad citadel in Amman.286 Such lamps were also discovered on Mount Nebo287 and at Umm al-Rasas.288 This type parallels Type VI at 'Anab al- Safinah in Syria, dated from the end of the sixth to the end of the eighth centuries CE.289 A lamp of this type bearing a Samaritan inscription ("r&gt;an 13 ."perpetual lamp") was published by Mayer and Reifenberg.290 There are lamps of this type in private collections.291 At Bet Shean, most of the lamps of Type 32 (39, including most of the complete and almost complete lamps) were found in and around the amphitheater. The earliest lamps were discovered beneath the floor of a room north of the adjacent Byzantine street (L. 105). A hoard of 33 Byzantine coins wrapped in cloth, of Justin I (518-527 CE), Justinian I (527-565 CE) and Justin II (565-578 CE), was found with them. Other lamps were found with Umayyad 74</page><page sequence="81">Local clay lamps, Type 32. 75</page><page sequence="82">Local clay lamps, Type 32 (cont.). 76</page><page sequence="83">Local clay lamps, Type 32 (cont.). 77</page><page sequence="84">pottery and lamps of the Umayyad Types 29, 35 and 36; a few were discovered near the Umayyad kilns built in the arena. Some of the lamps from the amphitheater area were found in unclear stratigraphie contexts that do not permit their dating. A complete lamp was found with Umayyad pottery near the Umayyad kilns built within Roman shops near the temple (L. 94239). Another complete lamp was discovered in the eastern bathhouse (L. 05514) with pottery dating mostly from the Byzantine period, though a few sherds are from the Umayyad period; one coin dated to the Arab-Byzantine period was also found with it. One complete lamp was discovered in a sounding adjacent to a wall erected on the Umayyad street near the Roman basilica (L. 535). Sixty coins were discovered here as well: the earliest is Roman, while the latest (35 coins) are Umayyad. One lamp fragment was found in the Monument of Antonius (L. 44560) with Umayyad pottery. Two other lamps from Bet Shean were discovered in a synagogue that, according to Zori, was burnt by the Byzantines after they had recaptured the region from the Sasanians in 624 CE.292 A few lamps were found in the theater pottery workshop at Bet Shean.293 Judging from the finds from Bet Shean, these lamps apparently first appeared in the late sixth century CE, but were more common in the Umayyad period. Type 33 (No. 337) This type can be seen as a variant of Type 32, Variant 2. One complete lamp and three fragments were discovered at Bet Shean. They are made from light brown and orange- brown clay. The complete lamp (No. 337) is especially large (12.6 cm long and 4.5 cm high) and is heavier than other lamps. The boat-shaped lamp has a broad oblique rim. The channel along the nozzle is triangular and takes up most of the surface of the lamp. The filling hole is small and horseshoe-shaped. The base of the lamp follows the lamp's outline. The joint of the two parts of the lamp is covered with a layer of clay one centimetra- wide that encircles the lamp and serves to create a small tongue handle. This handle is very small relative to the size of the lamp. The channel is decorated with three dots and a semicircle, a very schematic depiction of a human face. On the preserved part of the upper half of one lamp, the channel seems to bear the same decoration as the complete lamp. Of the other two lamps, only part of the base is preserved. The only parallels to this lamp are two examples in the Schioessinger collection.294 The complete lamp from Bet Shean was discovered in the entrance to the vaults under the temple (L. 1004) and two fragments were discovered in the western vault (L. 54234). These vaults were in use until the early twentieth century. The ceramic finds from these vaults date from the Roman through Mamluk periods. The third fragment was found in a surface layer near the amphitheater (L. 231). These lamps cannot be dated on the basis of the Bet Shean excavations. However, on the basis of their resemblance to Type 32, they too can be dated to the late sixth century CE and the Umayyad period. Type 34 (No. 338) One almost complete lamp (after restoration) of this type was discovered. The lamp is triangular in shape and its rounded nozzle constitutes one of its angles. It is made from light brown clay with many black grits. The filling hole is small relative to its size. The entire surface of the lamp is ornamented with net pattern. There is no channel between the wick hole and filling hole, but several ridges appear in its place. The base is triangular and its shape follows the outline of the lamp. The handle is missing. The lamp was discovered in a building west of the temple square (L. 65012), in the earliest stratum of this building, dated to the final Byzantine to Umayyad periods. The numismatic record includes coins dating from the Roman through Umayyad periods. In the absence of a more precise date, it is suggested that this lamp is a transitional Byzantine-Umayyad type. Type 35 (Nos. 339-355) Type 35 is an elongated almond-shaped lamp characterized by a relatively thick rim, and consequently quite heavy for to its size. It has either a small knob handle or a small triangular handle; a few lamps are without handles. Each lamp has a large filling hole formed during manufacture of the lamp and not by breaking the discus after firing (Nos. 339-340). In three lamps (Nos. 341-342), two of which were made in the same mold, the filling hole is slightly sunken below the rim and channel, and surrounded by an almost square ridge. Another lamp (No. 343) has a similar though less pronounced filling hole. Some of the lamps have a pointed nozzle. Twenty-one complete lamps (one after restoration), three almost complete lamps and 119 fragments were discovered at Bet Shean. Most are made from light brown clay and the majority are slipped with brown or reddish-brown slip. A few lamps are made from gray, buff and yellowish-brown clay and are unslipped. One lamp (No. 344) is undecorated. The ornamentation found on the remainder of the lamps can be divided into three types: Vegetal designs (Nos. 345-351): the most common decoration consists of alternating stylized flowers in two different shapes, a design which is virtually identical on different-sized lamps. Other designs include stylized 78</page><page sequence="85">Local clay lamps, Type 33 (No. 337); Type 34 (No. 338). 79</page><page sequence="86">Local clay lamps, lype 35. 80</page><page sequence="87">Local clay lamps, lype 3d (con t. ). 81</page><page sequence="88">flowers, a branch with leaves, sometimes heart-shaped, and palmettes. Geometric patterns (Nos. 352-354): wheel pattern, decorated circles, radial designs, rhombus, short lines in two rows, herring-bone pattern, intertwined triangles filled with lines, net pattern, sometimes with dots, circles and half circles, scales with dots, hexagons and dots and undefined geometric designs. Zoomorphic decoration (No. 355): one lamp, of which only a fragment of the rim is preserved, was decorated with peacocks walking in a line. The lamps of this type have a well-defined channel between the filling hole and the wick hole, most often decorated with rope design, wavy lines, herring-bone pattern, a zigzag line and a stylized branch. In a few lamps, two of which were made in the same mold, it is ornamented with a fish. In some lamps the channel was left undecorated. The shape of the base follows the outline of the lamp. In some of the lamps the joint of the upper and lower halves is covered with a layer of clay, which also covers part of the decoration of the rim. Type 35 is common only in northern Palestine. It parallels Elgavish's Type 59, which he dated, on the basis of the hoard from Catacomb 24 at Beth She'arim, to the second half of the sixth century CE. About twenty lamps of this type were discovered in the hoard.295 Lamps of this .type were also discovered in Avigad's excavations at Beth She'arim and divided by him into three subtypes; the Bet . Shean lamps parallel subtype b. Some of the lamps from Bet Shean and Beth She'arim bear identical decoration or • similar designs in different variations; it is possible that they were made in one workshop or in identical molds in different workshops. These lamps were dated by Avigad to the end of the sixth-beginning of the seventh centuries CE.296 Two lamps that are similar in decoration to the Bet Shean lamps were published from Hammat Gader.297 Type 35 lamps were discovered at Sepphoris; they are also similar to the lamps found at Bet Shean.298 A hoard of fifty gold coins of the years 603-665 CE was found in a lamp of this type at Horvat Qav, near Sepphoris.299 A number of lamps of this type were discovered at Pella. The earliest was found in Tomb 7, which was in use, in Smith's opinion, in the period between 52 1/2 and the end of the seventh century CE; the lamp belongs to this period. The latest lamps at Pella were dated to the second quarter of the eighth century CE; one was found in the destruction level of the earthquake of 749 CE.300 Lamps of this type discovered at Gadara were dated to the early seventh-late eighth centuries CE.301 At Bet Shean, one complete lamp (after restoration) was found in a shop in the Umayyad shopping street (L. 54158) in which a hoard of silver and gold coins was also found. The latest gold coin helped to determine the exact date of the earthquake of 749 CE. Two fragments were found in a second shop (L. 706) and one fragment in a third shop (L. 54169) in the Umayyad shopping street, in the destruction level of the earthquake. These shops were never rebuilt. Two fragments were found in the destruction level of the same earthquake in the nymphaeum (L. 840). Two complete lamps were discovered in two different shops in Northwest Street (L. 26071, L. 26088). The lamps were found beneath stone debris with Umayyad pottery and coins of the late Roman, Arab-Byzantine and Umayyad periods. Two lamps were discovered in a room built in the Roman basilica (L. 64023). In the Umayyad period a kiln, in which some of the Umayyad pottery at Bet Shean was made, was constructed in this room. Four fragments of Type 35 were recovered in the same basket as a Type 29 lamp fragment, and two Type 36 lamps were also found in this locus (L. 44576). Most of the other lamps were found with coins and pottery of the Umayyad period, though a few lacked clear stratigraphie contexts that would permit their dating. Almost forty lamps of Type 35, though not a single mold, were discovered in the kilns in the theater pottery workshop.302 The finding of the lamps in the kilns indicates that this type was manufactured at Bet Shean. Judging from the finds from Bet Shean, these lamps first appeared in the Umayyad period and remained in use until its end, in 749 CE. The absence of these lamps from the Abbasid quarter built to the northwest of Valley Street over the ruins caused by the earthquake, and from the Abbasid stratum at Pella, indicates that Type 35, unlike Types 29 and 36, did not continue in use beyond this period. Type 36 (Nos. 356-419) This is the most common lamp type of the Umayyad period at Bet Shean. The lamp is pear-shaped. The filling hole is surrounded by a ridge which extends to the wick hole, creating a channel. Adjacent to the ridge at the back of the lamp is a conical handle. Thirty-seven complete lamps, 16 almost complete lamps and 227 fragments were found. Types 36 and 35 are the typical lamps of the Umayyad period at Bet Shean, as opposed to Type 29, which is infrequent at the site. The lamps are made from light to dark brown, reddish-brown, yellowish-brown, orange-brown and light and dark gray clay. A few are made from buff clay, and some are made from light brown clay that acquired a buff tone after firing. Isolated examples are slipped with brown or reddish-brown slip. A few groups of two or three lamps were made in the same molds. All the lamps are decorated; their ornamentation can be divided into three groups: Geometric decoration (Nos. 356-385): concentric 82</page><page sequence="89">Local clay lamps, Type 36. 83</page><page sequence="90">Local clay lamps, Type 36 (cont.). 84</page><page sequence="91">Local clay lamps, Type 36 (cont.). 85</page><page sequence="92">Local clay lamps, Type 36 (cont.). 86</page><page sequence="93">Local clay lamps, Type 36 (cont.). 87</page><page sequence="94">Local clay lamps, Type 36 (cont.). 88</page><page sequence="95">Local clay lamps, Type 36 (cont.). 89</page><page sequence="96">Local clay lamps, Type 36 (cont.). 90</page><page sequence="97">Local clay lamps, Type 36 (cont.). 91</page><page sequence="98">Local clay lamps, Type 36 (cont.). 92</page><page sequence="99">semicircles (sometimes with a raised dot or a line ending in a circle between them), semicircles decorated with ladder design, circles with dots, small concentric circles, a row of small circles between two rows of ladder design, semi- circles and wheels, wheels, crescents, triangles, triangles decorated with ladder design (sometimes with a line ending in a circle between them), triangles filled with net pattern (sometimes also with dots) and a raised dot or a circle between them, two rows of triangles along the rim, intertwined triangles, triangles and lines, a radial pattern, net pattern, herring-bone pattern and arabesques. In some lamps the decoration was formed by partitioning the rim into two by a ridge parallel to the filling hole: the decoration consists of raised dots inside the ridge and equidistant lines outside, circles inside the ridge and lines outside, intertwined triangles inside the ridge and wavy lines outside, a radial pattern inside the ridge and triangles outside, or triangles inside the ridge and two rows of radial pattern outside. Some of the lamps are decorated with arabesques, a radial pattern, small squares, triangles or wavy lines in two rows. Decoration with inscriptions (Nos. 386-397): eighteen complete lamps and fragments decorated with Kufic inscriptions were discovered. Apart from No. 386, whose rim bears a two-line inscription, the single word -¿t (Allah) in' regular or mirror writing appears on the channel of all the lamps. The first three letters of the word Allah are generally composed of three vertical lines of equal height, connected at the bottom. The fourth letter, the final hā' is in the shape of a circle, semicircle, arch or triangle. On one complete lamp (No. 386) the rim bears the two-line inscription 4Îri JM ^ ("In the name of Allah blessing from Allah"). One complete lamp (No. 387) is decorated with herring-bone pattern between two ridges; the word Allah appears on the channel in mirror writing. Three lamps were made in the same mold: the rim is decorated with open connected triangles and the word Allah appears on the channel (No. 388). One fragment (No. 389) is decorated with triangles; on the channel appears the word Allah, without its first letter. Three additional lamps also come from a single mold: the rim is decorated with semicircles and the word Allah appears on the channel in mirror writing (No. 390). One complete lamp (No. 391) is decorated with semicircles and the word Allah appears on the channel. Two fragments made in the same mold are decorated with semicircles and bear the word Allah twice: on the channel it appears in mirror writing and near the channel it appears in the regular form (No. 392). The fragment of one large lamp (No. 393) is decorated with semicifcles and impressed small circles and the word Allah appears on the channel in mirror writing. One fragment (No. 394) is decorated with semicircles and the word Allah appears on the channel in mirror writing. On three lamps made in the same mold the rim is decorated with semicircles between two ridges and the word Allah appears on the channel in mirror writing (Nos. 395-396). One complete lamp (No. 397), unusual in its square filling hole, is decorated with concentric circles and the word Allah appears on the channel in mirror writing. Some lamps of this type bear Christian inscriptions in Greek, continuing the tradition of the inscriptions on the candlestick lamps (Type 28).303 None were discovered at Bet Shean. Vegetal decoration (Nos. 398-401): a few lamps are decorated with a stylized branch, in most cases enclosed in a frame that narrows at both ends. On all but one of the lamps the channel along the nozzle is decorated with lengthwise parallel lines, two lines joined at their ends, a line with two or four dots at its end, a zigzag line, a straight line, ladder design, ridges, circles, two semicircles, sometimes with dots, a line and two semicircles from both sides, raised dots, a rope design, undefined geometric patterns, a stylized branch, a stylized vegetal design, a cross(?) and a one-word Kufic inscription. The base of Type 36 lamps (Nos. 357-360, 363, 366, 370-372, 374, 378-379, 381-383, 386, 393, 398, 402-418) may be a ring base (the most common), a rhombus base, a triangular base, an elongated rounded base, a base following the outline of the lamp (two examples) or a square base (one example). Most of the ring or elongated rounded bases are decorated with concentric circles, two circles inside a ring base, the two outer circles connected by straight lines, ridges and dots, a seven- or eight-spoked wheel, a geometric design in a shape of a cross, a line and four semicircles, undefined geometric designs, a stylized flower and a stylized branch. One ring base is decorated with ridges inside it and three circles around it. Another ring base has an undefined geometric design, a stylized flower around it and wheels and two birds at the bottom. One triangular base is ornamented with concentric triangles and geometric designs around them, and another triangular base is ornamented all around with stamped decorations composed of circles and leaves. Two incompletely preserved bases are large; their width at the center, 8.5 and 9 cm, indicates the size of the lamp. A rare lamp on whose base appears the Syriac word (Shammua') below a cross was published by Naveh.304 Of the lamps discovered at Bet Shean, a few stand out in their shape, ornamentation and size. One lamp (No. 415) has a base made from the upper part of a lamp; the rim is decorated with concentric triangles and the channel with dots. The handle location is covered by clay. The upper part of the lamp is decorated with herring-bone pattern between 93</page><page sequence="100">two ridges. One of the largest lamps found at Bet Shean (No. 416), of which only a small part is preserved, is made from orange-brown clay and is brown-slipped. The wick hole is very large and very sooty; the burning even extends to part of the rim, indicating prolonged use. The lamp is decorated with alternating semicircles and triangles with two volutes at the apex. Both triangles and semicircles are decorated with ladder design. The filling hole is surrounded by a ridge which forms a broad, deep channel. Around the filling hole there is also a deep depression. The base is a ring base decorated with an eight-spoked wheel and dots, and geometric patterns and stylized flowers around this. Two lamps (Nos. 417-418) were made in identical but different-sized molds; the lamps are higher than the other lamps and the smaller of the two, 8.2 cm long, is the smallest lamp of this type. This lamp was never used, as indicated by the absence of soot around the wick hole. The lamps are decorated with a radial pattern divided in the middle by a ridge; the channel bears two circles and the ring base is decorated with an eight-spoked wheel. Another lamp (No. 419) made in a different mold has the same decoration except for the channel, which is ornamented with ridges; its base is triangular, a quite common shape among these lamps. The shape of the above three lamps, and especially their decoration, are very rare at Bet Shean. Two lamps, one complete (No. 397) and one half preserved (No. 413), are •unusual in their square filling hole. No. 397 is decorated with concentric circles and a Kufic inscription on its channel; the base is triangular. No. 413 is ornamented with wavy lines and geometric designs near the handle, which is not preserved. The lamp has a square base decorated with a square and a rhombus. Of one lamp only the exceptionally large handle is preserved; its length (with the rim) is 4.5 cm. . In addition to lamps of Type 36, two molds used in the manufacture of this type were found (see Chapter 2). One mold was for a lamp with a cross on the channel (a decoration not found on lamps of this type at Bet Shean); the second was for a base decorated with an eight-spoked wheel. A mold and lamps made from it, with other decorated lamps including inscribed examples, were discovered in the theater pottery workshop at Bet Shean.305 Unlike Type 35, Type 36 is widespread throughout Palestine. Day's article on early Islamic and Christian lamps was the first attempt made to date the lamps typologically and stylistically. Three lamp types were considered: lamps with a conical handle (Type 36), lamps with a tongue handle (Type 37) and Jerash lamps (Type 29). The lamps with a conical handle were dated by her to the Umayyad period, with a variant continuing into the Abbasid period.306 At Khirbet al-Mefjer, Baramki divided the lamps into four groups; the first two groups parallel Type 36. According to him, these lamps were found "in the rooms undisturbed since the earthquake" of 749 CE. The other two groups parallel Type 37.307 Type 36 parallels Type 1 in Tiberias308 and was found in the synagogue of Hammath Tiberias.309 Lamps of this type were discovered in Jericho.310 At Beth She'arim they were dated by Avigad to the Umayyad period.311 They were found at Caesarea312 and Hammat Gader, one of the latter bearing a Kufic inscription on the base.313 This type parallels Types L9 and LIO at Capernaum.314 A lamp of this type found in the Armenian Garden in Jerusalem was defined by Tushingham as a transitional Byzantine-Umayyad lamp.315 Other such lamps from Jerusalem were dated by Magness to the seventh-early eighth centuries CE.316 One lamp was published from Nessana,317 and a few were discovered at Sde Boqer.318 Type 36 lamps were discovered at Pella in a late Umayyad level, and in the Abbasid town center where they were dated with the pottery to the second half of the eighth-beginning of the ninth centuries CE.319 A lamp fragment and a complete lamp were published from Jerash, and dated to the Umayyad and Abbasid periods respec- tively.320 At Abila this type of lamp is defined as the Umayyad- Abbasid lamp.321 Lamps of this type were also found on Mount Nebo322 and at Umm al-Rasas.323 Type 36 parallels Dobbins's Type 27, dated to the Umayyad period.324 This is the only lamp type discovered in the Umayyad palace at Jabal Usais in Syria, dated to the end of the seventh-early eighth centuries CE.325 At Antioch these lamps are included in Type 56 and dated to the sixth century CE, though they continue in use later.326 At Hama they were dated to the mid-sixth-second quarter of the seventh centuries CE.327 A few lamps of this type were found at Hims,328 and one lamp was published from Qasr al-Hayr al- Sharqi.329 This type parallels Type V at 'Anab al-Safinah.330 At Busrā in the Hauran a lamp fragment was found in the destruction level of the earthquake of 749 CE, and some lamps were found in a stratum from the beginning of the Abbasid period (the late second half of the eighth and beginning of the ninth centuries CE).331 A lamp fragment discovered at Tell 'Arqa in north Lebanon was defined as a transitional type between the Byzantine lamps of the sixth century CE and the early Islamic types.332 Lamps of this type were uncovered in Beirut.333 A lamp from Baalbek decorated with the Greek letter O on the channel was published by Rey-Coquais.334 This type is included in Type A at Fustāt; Kubiak distinguishes two variants, with a conical handle (Type 36) and a tongue handle (Type 37), both in use, in his opinion, in the ninth-tenth centuries CE.335 Lamps of this type and a mold for their manufacture were found at Kūffa, Takrît and Samarra and dated to the ninth and twelfth centuries CE.336 Additional lamps of this 94</page><page sequence="101">type are in museums and private collections.337 Inscribed lamps were discovered in Tiberias,338 Hammath Tibe- rias,339 Gush Halav,340 Sepphoris,341 Capernaum,342 in the cemetery at Beth She'arim,343 Kursi,344 Sde Boqer345 and Pella.346 Additional inscribed lamps are in museums and private collections.347 No parallel was found at other sites for the lamps with the square filling hole, and the fact that they are uncommon even at Bet Shean emphasizes their uniqueness. At Bet Shean, three complete lamps (Nos. 379, 383, 391, the latter decorated with the word Allah on the channel) were found in three different shops in the Umayyad shopping street, which, as noted above, was built in 738 CE, destroyed in the earthquake of January 749 CE and never rebuilt. The Type 2 bronze lamp (see Chapter 4) was discovered with the inscribed lamp No. 391. Three inscribed lamps were found in one locus (L. 89078) and two inscribed lamps in another locus (L. 89075) near the amphitheater. Most of the lamps of this type were found with pottery and coins of the Umayyad period, while a few came from Abbasid contexts. One complete lamp was found under a floor of a room in the Abbasid quarter which was built over the ruins of the earthquake of 749 CE, northwest of Valley Street (L. 94529). The lamp was found with pottery of the Abbasid period and an Umayyad coin (Umayyad coins were still in use in the Abbasid period). The two lamps whose base follows the outline of the lamp were found near the amphitheater. One (No. 369) was found in L. 09029 with a Type 37 lamp, the lamp of the Abbasid- Fatimid periods with a tongue handle. This type of base is typical of the Type 37 lamps found at Bet Shean, and this lamp may represent the continuation of the lamp with a conical handle from the Umayyad to the early Abbasid period. The second lamp (not illustrated), the only one with an undecorated channel, was discovered in L. 29001 with Umayyad pottery. An inscribed lamp (No. 388) was found with a Type 37 lamp in Northwest Street (L. 06032). Only a few fragments were found in unclear stratigraphie contexts that do not permit their dating. On the basis of the finds from Bet Shean, Type 36 (lamps with a conical handle) should be dated to the Umayyad period and probably first started to appear at the beginning of the eighth century CE. The inscribed lamps certainly do not predate the reform of 'Abd al-Malik in 696 CE. This was probably the period of construction of the kilns of Bet Shean, in which vessels typical of Bet Shean and Trans- jordan were made; the kilns continued to function in the Abbasid period, i.e. after the earthquake of 749 CE. These lamps were still in use in the early Abbasid period, as demonstrated also by the finds at Pella and Busrā, when they were replaced by Type 37 (lamps with a tongue handle). Type 37 (Nos. 420-467) The lamps of this type are similar in shape to Type 36 lamps, but differ in the shape of the handle (these lamps have a tongue handle), the shape of the base, and their decoration. Unlike Type 36, this type has two additional variants: lamps with multiple wick holes (polylychnoi ) and miniature lamps. Eighteen complete lamps, 29 almost complete lamps (lacking the handle or a small part of the body) and 245 fragments were found. The lamps are made from buff, light and dark brown and orange-brown clay. A few are made from gray clay. One is slipped with reddish- brown slip. The smallest lamp (No. 420) is 8.2 cm long and the largest (No. 421) 11.8 cm long. All the lamps are decorated; their ornamentation can be divided into four types. Geometric decoration (Nos. 422-439): circles deco- rated with geometric patterns, semicircles, concentric circles, elongated circles, sometimes with a geometric design in the shape of an S and dots, intertwined semicircles (arches), bisecting semicircles with small circles between them (four lamps made in the same mold), circles with small dots inside (two lamps made in the same mold), six- and multi-spoked wheels, rhombi on all the surfaces of the lamp, triangles, open, intertwined triangles, triangles decorated with ladder pattern with stylized leaves between them and stylized grape clusters inside them, scales with a dot or small star inside, arabesques (all lamps made in the same mold), arabesques and a string of dots at the edge of the rim, decorative patterns within a frame (three lamps, two made in the same mold), herring-bone pattern, a string of dots between two ridges, wavy lines and two rows of diagonal lines, a radial pattern, sometimes in two rows and sometimes with a row of dots at the edge of the rim, laige raised dots and geometric designs. Vegetal decoration (Nos. 440-448): vine tendrils with bunches of grapes (two lamps made in the same mold), vine tendrils in the shape of wavy lines with very small bunches of grapes, stylized leaves and bunches of grapes, bunches of grapes in three different shapes, vine tendrils and lilies, vine tendrils and a branch, a stylized branch, an elongated palm branch with undefinable geometric and vegetal shapes beside it (three lamps made in the same mold), a branch with elongated leaves (all lamps made in the same mold), a branch within a frame, a branch with a lily and stylized leaves, heart-shaped leaves, stylized flowers sometimes within a frame, sometimes with net pattern and sometimes with geometric designs, and undefined vegetal decoration. Zoomorphic decoration (Nos. 449-453): four lamps made in the same mold are ornamented with an ass on either side of the wick hole; the rest of the rim is decorated with a flower and a seven-spoked wheel on either side (No. 449). One lamp (No. 450) is decorated with a cat, while the rest of 95</page><page sequence="102">Local clay lamps, Type 37. 96</page><page sequence="103">Local clay lamps, Type 37 (cont.). 97</page><page sequence="104">Local clay lamps, Type 37 (cont.). 98</page><page sequence="105">Local clay lamps, Type 37 (cont.). 99</page><page sequence="106">Local clay lamps, Type 37 (cont.). 100</page><page sequence="107">Local clay lamps, Type 37 (cont.). 101</page><page sequence="108">Local clay lamps, Type 37 (cont.). 102</page><page sequence="109">Local clay lamps, Type 37 (cont.). 103</page><page sequence="110">the rim is ornamented with geometric patterns; the entire decoration is very crowded. Another lamp is decorated with an unidentifiable animal. The ornamentation on one lamp (No. 451) is a peacock between a branch and leaf; concentric circles and a wheel decorate both sides of the handle. The fragment of one lamp bears a peacock pecking at a bunch of grapes. Three lamps made in the same mold are decorated with birds flanking the wick hole; nearby are three framed stylized flowers (Nos. 452-453). On lamps decorated with birds flanking the wick hole, the rim is usually ornamented with vine tendrils and the bird sometimes pecks at them. Lamps decorated in this way were discovered at Khirbet al-Karak,348 in the cemetery at Beth She'arim,349 and at Ramla,350 Jerusalem,351 Jerash352 and Amman.353 They are also in private collections.354 A lamp decorated with a bird pecking at its wing was published by Avi-Yonah.355 Lamps decorated with different zoomorphic figures were discovered at the Hill of the Ophel in Jerusalem,356 Caesarea,357 Gezer,358 Tel Ta'anach,359 Amman,360 Aqaba361 and Fustāt.362 They were also published in private collections.363 Decoradon with Kufic inscriptions (Nos. 454-461): twenty complete lamps, almost complete lamps (except for the handle or a small part of the nozzle) and fragments were discovered. Thirteen of the lamps were made in the same mold and are decorated with the two-line inscription: JJJ-ł ¿as Js- ("My patience in Allah the magnificent and patience at the time of a great tragedy"). (Nos. 454-455). The first line of the inscription is written from left to right in mirror writing except for the word Allah, which appears in regular writing. The second line is written in the regular manner from right to left. Two other lamps were made in a single mold; the rim is decorated with a stylized branch with leaves and the word (Allah) probably appears on the channel (No. 456). In five lamps the channel is decorated with the word *5^ barakah ("blessing"), the most common inscription in this type of lamp, while the rim is ornamented with two rows of short lines between two ridges or with arabesques (Nos. 457- 461). On one lamp the inscription appears in mirror writing, while on the other four it is in regular form. The reading of one lamp (No. 461) is uncertain. Inscribed lamps were discovered at Caesarea,364 Tibe- rias,365 the cemetery at Beth She'arim,366 Sepphoris,367 Tel Ta'anach,368 Horvat Zikhrin,369 Kefar Ya'avetz,370 Kilodya371 and Fustāt.372 Additional inscribed lamps are in museums and private collections.373 At Ramla a lamp with a pseudo-inscription was found.374 The channel decoration consists of circles, small circles with a dot inside, large raised dots, parallel lines, a straight •line with a small circle at each end, triangles intertwined at their apex with small lines surrounding the wick hole, two rows of small squares, herring-bone pattern, wavy lines, arabesques, a date palm with palm branches, a stylized branch, undefined geometric and vegetal designs and a Kufic inscription. In some cases the channel bears the same decoration as the rim: arabesques, elongated leaves, herring-bone pattern and wavy lines. In one lamp the channel is slightly deeper and decorated with circles. The lamps have three alternative base types: a base which follows the outline of the lamp (the most common), a round ring base and an elongated ring base. The base is decorated in only a few examples: a six-spoked wheel inside a ring base (No. 440), two circles inside a ring base, the two outer circles connected by straight lines, with two additional small circles flanking the ridge which joins the base to the apex of the lamp and one at the bottom, similar to the base of lamp No. 366 of Type 36 (No. 429), several ridges inside a base which follows the outline of the lamp, a stylized branch within an elongated ring base (No. 425) and an unclear design within an elongated ring base. The shape of the base and its lack of decoration in almost all cases differentiate this lamp from the Type 36 lamp with a conical handle. Among the lamps of this type are glazed examples, which are very rare. Four were discovered at Bet Shean, one complete and three fragmentary. The lamps are made from light brown and buff clay, and the glaze is monochromatic: two of the lamps are glazed with a green tin or alkaline glaze and two with a turquoise alkaline glaze. The complete lamp and one of the fragments were made in the same mold and glazed with the same glaze; they are decorated with a geometric design which is difficult to define (No. 462). The second fragment is decorated with arabesques and the third with a winged animal (No. 463). Glazed lamps were found in Tiberias,375 in the Tyropoeon Valley in Jerusalem376 and at Caesarea.377 Two glazed lamps were discovered at Fustāt, one dated to the late eighth century CE and the second to the eighth- ninth centuries CE.378 An additional lamp from Fustāt was dated by Lane to the ninth century CE.379 A glazed lamp discovered at Aqaba was dated to the Abbasid period.380 A glazed lamp, said to come from Caesarea, is in the Museum of Ancient Art in Haifa.381 A glazed lamp is in the Schioessinger collection,382 and lamps with monochromatic and polychromatic glazes are in the Benaki Museum.383 As noted above, these lamps have two additional variants: polylychnoi and miniature lamps. Polylychnos (No. 464). A lamp with four wick holes was discovered at Bet Shean. The lamp is made from orange- brown clay and decorated with simple geometric patterns of small circles and zigzag lines. The channels are decorated with a straight line with a circle at each end. The base of the lamp is trapezoidal. The handle is not preserved. A lamp with two wick holes was discovered at Ramla.384 104</page><page sequence="111">A glazed lamp with four wick holes is in the Jordanian Archaeological Museum; on the two outer channels are two non-Arabic names written in Kufic script.385 A lamp with three wick holes is in the Warschaw collection,386 and two lamps with two wick holes, made in the same mold, are in the Benaki Museum.387 A miniature lamp with three wick holes is in the Schioessinger collection.388 Miniature lamps (Nos. 465-467). Five miniature lamps were discovered at Bet Shean, one complete (apart from a small part of the handle) and four fragmentary. The lamps are made from orange-brown and buff clay. One of the fragments is glazed with gray glaze. The complete lamp is 4.6 cm long and 1 .8 cm high. In the two lamps whose wick holes are preserved, they are covered with soot, testifying to their use. The complete lamp (No. 465) is decorated with vine tendrils and its channel with lines. One lamp fragment is decorated with a stylized branch between bunches of grapes; two full-size lamps of Type 37 (one of which is No. 445) with the same decoration were found in the same locus as this miniature lamp. The channel is decorated with two rows of small squares. Another fragment is ornamented with stylized vegetal decoration. One fragment (No. 466) is ornamented with small, delicate geometric patterns, includ- ing decorated circles and rhombi. Around the filling hole is a string of small circles and the channel is decorated with concentric circles. The glazed fragment (No. 467) has a relatively thick wall adorned with arabesques. Two of the miniature lamps have a small, slightly raised base following the lamp's outline, the glazed lamp has a flat base, and only the upper parts of the two other lamps are preserved. A miniature lamp was discovered at Caesarea in a stratum dated to the period between 640 and 1200 CE.389 Another miniature lamp from Caesarea was dated to the Umayyad-Abbasid periods.390 One miniature lamp was discovered at Sepphoris391 and one was published from Aqaba.392 Miniature lamps were published by Kennedy393 and are in the Schioessinger collection.394 In addition to the lamps of Type 37, two molds for such lamps were found at Bet Shean. Another mold is for lamps with a pentagonal body and a tongue handle; no lamps of this type were discovered at Bet Shean (see Chapter 2). Lamps of Type 37 were discovered at Caesarea395 and Hammat Gader.396 This type parallels Type 2 at Yoq- OQQ ne'am and Type Lll at Capernaum. Lamps of this type discovered at Khirbet al-Mefjer were dated by Baramki to the period after the earthquake of 749 CE.399 Type 37 parallels Type 2 in Tiberias400 and was found in the synagogue at Hammath Tiberias.401 Lamps with a tongue handle, as well as a mold used in the manufacture of several of the lamps, were discovered at Ramla. All the finds from Ramlá were dated to the eighth century CE 402 Lamps of this type discovered in the Armenian Garden in Jerusalem were dated to the Abbasid period.403 A few such lamps were discovered at Nessana.404 This type of lamp was discovered at Pella in the center of the Abbasid city and dated to the ninth-tenth centuries CE.405 This type parallels Group VI, Subgroup 2 at Jerash, defined as "typically Abbasid".406 A lamp of this type was discovered in Amman in the destruction level of an Abbasid-Fatimid structure and dated, with the pottery discovered there, to the eleventh century CE. An additional lamp was found with pottery in a pit in a room belonging to an Umayyad structure; the lamp and pottery were dated to the early Abbasid period 407 Other lamps were found in the Umayyad palace in Amman.408 This lamp type was also found at Aqaba409 and Umm al-Rasas.410 Lamps of this type were discovered at Fustāt, where lamps with a conical handle and with a tongue handle (glazed or unglazed) were, in the opinion of Kubiak, used contemporaneously and can be dated to the ninth-tenth centuries CE. A few lamps were discovered in a context dated to the second half of the eleventh century CE. According to Kubiak, glazed lamps did not appear before the Abbasid period.411 Lamps with a conical or tongue handle were dated by Scanlon to the eighth-ninth centuries CE, and in his view they were not made in Egypt after 900 CE.412 Other lamps with a tongue handle from Fusļāt were dated by Kubiak and Scanlon to the eighth-ninth centuries CE, while one or two of the lamps can be dated, in their opinion, to the end of the seventh century CE.413 This type parallels Type 56 at Antioch, dated primarily to the sixth century CE but continuing later as well.414 At Hama lamps of this type were dated to the seventh century CE.415 Type 37 lamps were discovered in Damascus in Roman cemeteries.416 A lamp of this type was discovered at Baalbek.417 Lamps from Tyre and Sidon were published by Rey-Coquais.418 Additional lamps of this type are in museums and private collections.419 At Bet Shean, Type 37 was not discovered in the shops destroyed in the earthquake of 749 CE, which yielded the three types of lamps in use in the Umayyad period (Types 29, 35 and 36). The fact that lamps with a conical handle (Type 36) rather than a tongue handle (Type 37) were found in these shops attests to the latters' appearing only after the mid-eighth century CE. Some of these lamps were discovered in the Abbasid quarter built on the ruins of the earthquake of 749 CE. It is not possible to determine with certainty when they first appeared, but since lamps with a conical handle were found in strata of the beginning of the Abbasid period at Bet Shean, Pella and Busrā, it can be assumed that lamps with a tongue handle (including glazed lamps) were produced only towards the end of the eighth or beginning of the ninth century CE. All the lamps were found with glazed and unglazed pottery vessels dated between the mid-eighth and eleventh centuries CE. On the 105</page><page sequence="112">basis of the finds from Bet Shean, Fustāt and Amman, it appears that these lamps were in use until at least the eleventh century CE. Type 38 (No. 468) One fragment of this type was found. The lamp is wheel- made and has one reservoir; a loop handle is drawn from the rim to the middle of the lamp's body. The nozzle is not preserved. The lamp has a low disc base. It is made from grayish-brown clay with numerous small black grits and is poorly fired. A glazed lamp of this type was discovered at Aqaba and dated to the eleventh century CE.420 This fragment was discovered near the basilica (L. 64010) with pottery of the early Islamic period (the second half of the eighth to eleventh centuries CE). Type 38 can apparently be dated to the ninth-eleventh centuries CE. Type 39 (No. 469) One fragment of this type was discovered. The lamp is wheel-made and has one reservoir with a fairly tall rim. The nozzle protrudes slightly from the body and the base is a low disc base. The lamp is made from dark brown clay and is well fired. This fragment was found in the area of the shops to the northeast of Valley Street (L. 593) with pottery of the early Islamic period (the second half of the eighth to eleventh centuries CE). The numismatic finds include a cache of gold and silver Umayyad coins and a few late Roman coins. The proposed dating is as for Type 38, the ninth-eleventh centuries CE. Type 40 (Nos. 470-472) Type 40 is a wheel-made lamp consisting of two separately made parts which were joined together. It has a small handle adjacent to the outer bowl. Two almost complete lamps (with the exception of the handle and a small part of the rim) and two fragments of this type were discovered. The base of the two almost complete lamps (Nos. 470-471) is string-cut. The lamps are made from yellowish and light brown clay. One of the lamps (No. 472) differs slightly from the other three: this fragment, consisting of half of the lamp, includes the entire handle, which is small and triangular. It has a flat base. The lamp is made from light brown clay which acquired a yellowish-brown hue after firing and is well fired. Type 40 parallels Type 5 at Dehes in northern Syria, dated to the ninth-tenth centuries CE.421 This type also parallels Group 1 at Qal'at Sem'an in northern Syria, dated at this site to the eighth and ninth centuries CE.422 At Bet Shean, three of the lamps were discovered in the amphitheater and one in a shop near the temple. One almost complete lamp was discovered in a structure built in the arena (L. 260); the pottery found in this locus dates mostly from the Byzantine to the early Islamic periods, with a small amount from the Mamluk period. The other almost complete lamp was found in another structure built in the amphitheater (L. 09026); the pottery discovered with it dates from the early Islamic period (second half of the eighth to eleventh centuries CE). One lamp fragment was found in stone debris near the perimeter wall of the amphitheater (L. 09091) with pottery of the Umayyad and early Islamic periods. The second fragment, discovered in the shop near the temple (L. 75075), was also found with pottery of the early Islamic period. These lamps cannot be dated precisely on the basis of the contexts in which they were found, but on the basis of the finds from the above- mentioned sites, it is suggested that they too should be dated to the ninth-eleventh centuries CE. Type 41 (No. 473) A small body fragment is all that was found of this wheel- made type. The lamp is made from buff clay and green glazed both inside and out. The lamp is formed from a small bowl with straight sides which round out near the flat base. The upper part of the lamp, raised slightly around the filling hole, was made separately on the wheel. A flat loop handle is drawn from rim to body. Opposite the handle is a relatively short nozzle. This type parallels Type C at Fustāt, which was dated by Kubiak to the tenth-eleventh centuries CE.423 This fragment was found in stone debris on the street east of the nymphaeum (L. 853) with pottery of the early Islamic period (the second half of the eighth to eleventh centuries CE). On the basis of the finds from Fustāt and Bet Shean, Type 41 can apparently be dated to the tenth-eleventh centuries CE. Type 42 (No. 474) A single fragment of this type was discovered. The lamp is made from grayish-brown clay and bears a turquoise alkaline glaze both inside and out. Type 42 lamps are wheel-made and consist of two separately made parts: a small bowl serving as the oil reservoir inside an outer bowl. A small loop handle is drawn from the inner reservoir to the outer bowl. These lamps do not have a protruding nozzle; instead, the outer bowl is lightly pinched in one corner. There is a small disc base. This type parallels Fustāt Types E, dated by Kubiak to 106</page><page sequence="113">Local clay lamps, Type 38 (No. 468); Type 39 (No. 469); Type 40 (No. 470). 107</page><page sequence="114">Local clay lamps, Type 40 (cont.)

On the basis of the finds from the above-mentioned sites, it appears that this type can be dated to the tenth- eleventh centuries CE. Type 43 (Nos. 475-478) Two complete lamps, two almost complete lamps (one lacking only the handle) and one fragment of this type were discovered. The lamps are wheel-made from reddish-brown clay (cooking pot ware) and consist of two separately fashioned bowls which were joined together. A loop handle is drawn from the inner bowl, which serves as the oil reservoir, to the outer bowl. The lamp has a small high disc base. A lamp of this type was published from 'Atlit. The ceramic finds discovered there were dated to the period from the Crusader conquest (1217-1291 CE) to the first century of the Mamluk occupation.428 Lamps of this type were discovered at Caesarea429 and at Yoqne'am, where they were dated to the late twelfth-first half of the thirteenth centuries CE.430 Lamp of this type were found at Horvat 'Aqav (Ramat Hanadiv),431 Capernaum432 and Seppho- ris.433 In Jerusalem this lamp type was dated to the Ayyubid period.434 A lamp of this type was discovered in Beirut and defined as Crusader.435 Type 43 lamps were also discovered at Tell 'Arqa and dated by Will to the tenth-twelfth centuries CE,436 by Thalmann to the mid-thirteenth century CE,437 and by Hakimian and Salamé-Sarkis to the thirteenth century CE.438 Lamps of this type were discovered with the uncovering of the Seljuq wall at Aleppo, which was dated to between 553 and 592 AH (the second half of the twelfth century CE); the lamps are from the period of use of the wall.439 A lamp discovered at Tell Sūkās in Syria was defined as Crusader and dated to the twelfth century CE.440 Lamps of this type, glazed and unglazed, were also discovered at Lattaqia441 and 'Ain Dara, north of Aleppo.442 In Cyprus they were dated to the eleventh- twelfth centuries CE.443 One such lamp was published by Kennedy.444 Of the five lamps discovered at Bet Shean, one was found in the vaults below the temple, one in a shop and three in the amphitheater. The complete lamp discovered in the vaults (L. 54234) was found with pottery of the Roman through Mamluk periods. One complete Type 37 lamp and two Type 45 lamps were also discovered in this locus. The almost complete lamp, discovered in a shop in Northwest Street (L. 26087), was found in a layer of alluvium above stone debris. The second complete lamp was found at floor level in the passage between the seats of the amphitheater (L. 242); the latest pottery in this locus dates from the twelfth-thirteenth centuries CE. The second almost com- plete lamp was also found in the amphitheater (L. 616) with Mamluk pottery. The lamp fragment was discovered in a vomitorium (L. 623) with early Islamic, Crusader and Mamluk pottery. On the basis of the finds from the above- mentioned sites, these lamps can apparently be dated to the twelfth-thirteenth centuries CE. Type 44 (Nos. 479-481) Sixteen fragments of this mold-made lamp type, including two pairs made in the same mold, were discovered. The lamps are made from light brown-yellowish or orange- brown clay. They are characterized by an elongated body and a small filling hole relative to the size of the lamp, which is not surrounded by a ridge. The lamps do not have a channel, but the channel area is defined by three parallel lines. The handle twists above the lamp but does not touch the rim. One lamp (No. 479) is decorated with an inscription in Naskhi script, typical of the Ayyubid period, of which the first two words are preserved (the first word lacks its beginning, the definite article): &gt;3* ("prosperity forever"). The remaining lamps (Nos. 480-481) bear a decoration which can be described as a pseudo-inscriptioa The decoration is set within a frame which surrounds the edges of the rim. Lamps of this type were discovered in the Armenian Garden in Jerusalem and dated to the Ayyubid period (1212/14-1219/27 CE).445 All of the few inscribed lamps published, including the lamp from Bet Shean, bear the same inscription: &lt;u»-UaJ ("prosperity for- ever happiness to its owners"). Such lamps were discovered at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem,446 Mount Zion,447 Nebi Samwil,448 Abu Gosh449 and 'Atlit.450 One lamp was published by Bagatti.451 The standard inscription that appears on all the lamps (at least the published examples) contrasts with the variety of the Kufic inscriptions that appear on lamps of Types 36 and 37, and may indicate that the lamps of Type 44 were all made, in one mold or similar molds, in one workshop, apparently in Jerusalem or nearby. A lamp fragment with a pseudo-inscription was found in Ashdod,452 and a complete lamp with a pseudo-inscription was published by Sussman 453 At Bet Shean, six of the fragments were found near the nymphaeum; one of the best-preserved fragments (No. 481) 109</page><page sequence="116">Local clay lamps, Type 43. 110</page><page sequence="117">Local clay lamps, Type 44. Ill</page><page sequence="118">was found in L. 54418 with seven coins, the three latest of which are Ayyubid. The inscribed lamp was discovered in a shop in Northwest Street (L. 36272) with Ayyubid-Mamluk pottery. On the basis of the finds from Bet Shean and Jerusalem, it is proposed that these lamps should be dated to the late twelfth-first half of the thirteenth centuries CE. The fact that the Naskhi inscription appears only on this type of lamp, with a handle that twists above the lamp but does not touch the rim, also supports this date. Type 45 (Nos. 482-489) Type 45 lamps are identical in their elongated shape to Type 44 lamps but differ in the shape of their handle and in their decoration. The handle was attached to or very near the rim and the ornamentation may be defined as geometric designs. One complete lamp, two almost complete lamps (except for the handle) and 20 fragments of this mold-made type were discovered; two of the fragments (Nos. 484-485) were made in the same mold. The lamps are made from light and dark brown and orange-brown clay. A few lamps were made from orange-brown clay fired to yellow or light green on the surface. The decoration consists mostly of vertical herring- bone pattern set between two lines whose ends are rounded (Nos. 482-486), but also of herring-bone pattern (No. 487), a radial design (No. 488) and concentric circles. One of the two almost complete lamps has a very worn decoration which is difficult to define but perhaps consists of a radial . design. As in Type 44 lamps, the decoration is set in a frame that encircles the lamp; there is no channel, but its area is defined by three parallel lines. This type has an indefinable base, except for one lamp which has a wide base whose shape follows that of the lamp. The second almost complete lamp (No. 489) has a slightly different decoration from the others: it is ornamented with a spiral design and lateral and vertical herring-bone pattern. Its nozzle is decorated with a zigzag line between two parallel lines, which starts near the wick hole and continues on the other side of the filling hole, close to the missing handle. This lamp is heavier than the other lamps. Type 45 is more widespread than Type 44. Such lamps were discovered in excavations in the Armenian Garden in Jerusalem and dated to the Mamluk period (last quarter of the fourteenth century CE). According to Tushingham, the excavation results indicate that lamps with a high handle begin to appear no earlier than the Ayyubid period and are decorated with arabesques or calligraphy. The Mamluk lamp is a development of the Ayyubid type; its handle touches the rim or is pressed against it, and its decoration is usually geometric.454 Molds and lamps were discovered at Nebi Samwil, very close to Jerusalem.455 Lamps of this type were also discovered at the Temple Mount,456 in the Tyropoeon Valley,457 at Shepherds' Field,458 Bethany,459 Emmaus al-Qubeibeh,460 Abu Gosh,461 Khirbet al-Law- za,462 Ashdod,463 Samaria,464 Gezer,465 Horvat 'Aqav (Ramat Hanadiv)466 and Yehud.467 A lamp of this type was found at Tel Yehud with a coin of Sha'ban II (1363- 1376 CE).468 They were also found in the Red Tower in Phase D (the destruction layer), dated to ca. 1265-1390 CE 469 At La Fève, a Crusader castle in the Jezreel Valley, a Type 45 lamp was discovered and dated to the twelfth- thirteenth centuries CE.470 A lamp of this type was found in the Monastery of St. Mary of Carmel and dated with pottery found there to the thirteenth century CE.471 At Yoqne'am they were dated to the Mamluk period.472 Lamps of this type were discovered at Heshbon; in one of them a hoard of 66 Mamluk coins dating to 1260-1277 CE was found.473 A complete lamp of this type was found in an Umayyad church in Amman 474 A Type 45 lamp was found at Busrā in the Hauran and dated to the twelfth century CE.475 This type parallels Type 1-4 at Fustāt, where a single specimen was found,476 and lamps of this type were discovered at Hama.477 Type 45 parallels Kennedy's Type 27, dated by Day to the thirteenth-fourteenth centuries CE.478 There is a lamp of this type in the museum in Vancouver,479 and one lamp was published by Sussman.480 A miniature lamp of this type is in the Schioessinger collection.481 At Bet Shean, the complete lamp was found in a late structure on Valley Street (L. 817); a lamp fragment of Type 44 (No. 480) was also found here. The ceramic and numismatic finds are of the Ayyubid-Mamluk periods. One almost complete lamp and a fragment were discovered in the vaults under the temple (L. 54234). The second almost complete lamp was discovered in Northwest Street (L. 06038) with Mamluk pottery. Four lamp fragments were discovered near the nymphaeum in a stratum dated to the second half of the thirteenth century CE. Five fragments were found in or near the amphitheater. One was discovered near the entrance to a vault beneath the Byzantine street near the amphitheater (L. 379); a Type 47 lamp was also found there, and the pottery is of the Mamluk period. Another fragment, constituting half of the lamp, was discovered in the amphitheater (L. 271) with Mamluk pottery. Another fragment, also about half of the lamp, was found near the temple (L. 95013) in a Mamluk level. A lamp fragment, made in the same mold as the previous one, was found in a Mamluk installation in a shop in Northwest Street (L. 36350). This lamp type first appeared in the second half of the thirteenth century, a date supported by the coin hoard found in the lamp at Heshbon, and continued in use into the fourteenth century CE. The finding of the molds at Nebi Samwil indicates that Type 45, like Type 44, was produced in Jerusalem or nearby. 112</page><page sequence="119">Local clay lamps, Type 45. 113</page><page sequence="120">Local clay lamps, Type 45 (cont.). 114</page><page sequence="121">Type 46 (Nos. 490-493) Types 46 and 45 are the latest of the mold-made lamps. Seven lamps were found, one complete (after restoration), one almost complete (after restoration) and five fragments. The shape is similar to Type 37, but unlike it the lamps of this type are undecorated. They have a small filling hole that is not surrounded by the ridge of Type 37, and a tongue handle. Unlike Type 37, they lack a well-defined channel; in the almost complete lamp the channel area is not defined, and in two other lamps in which the nozzle is preserved the broad channel area is slightly defined and decorated with three almost indiscernible parallel lines. The wick hole is quite large. The complete lamp has a high base which follows the outline of the lamp, and the almost complete lamp has a small triangular base; the bases of the other lamps are not preserved. The joint of the upper and lower halves of the lamp is covered with a layer of clay, another characteristic that differentiates this type from Type 37. The lamps are made from gray and light brown clay and they are well fired to a metallic quality. Lamps of this type were found in the Armenian Garden in Jerusalem, two of them in Ayyubid fill.482 One lamp was discovered in the Red Tower in Phase E, dated to ca. 1390- ca. 1920 CE.483 At Bet Shean, four of the seven lamps were found in and around the amphitheater. The complete lamp was discov- ered in a vault in the amphitheater (L. 611) with early Islamic and Mamluk pottery and lamps of Types 50 and 51. The almost complete lamp was discovered near the amphitheater in L. 39065, in the upper level of the locus which is a paved courtyard, with pottery of the Mamluk period. One lamp fragment was found in the amphitheater (L. 110), also with Mamluk pottery, and one lamp fragment was discovered near the amphitheater in a surface layer (L. 39043). The other three fragments were found near the temple (L. 61 1, L. 613, L. 75006) with Mamluk pottery. On the basis of these finds, Type 46 should be dated to the second half of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries CE. Type 47 (No. 494) Type 47 lamps are wheel-made and consist of two separately made parts which were joined to one another. A tall loop handle is drawn from the inner bowl, which serves as the oil reservoir; to the outer bowl. About half of the outer bowl is pinched in one corner to create the nozzle. The oil reservoir has an emphasized, raised rim and is taller than the outer bowl. The lamps have a slightly raised disc base. Three fragments of this type were found. Two are made from reddish-brown clay, while the third is made from light brown clay. One lamp is slip-painted under yellow lead glaze; a small part of the oil reservoir and the handle adjoining it, as well as a small part of the outer bowl, are preserved. This type of lamp was discovered in the Armenian Garden in Jerusalem and dated to the Ayyubid period (1212/14-1219/27 CE).484 Lamps of this type found at Khirbet al-Minyah were dated to the thirteenth-fourteenth centuries CE.485 At Yesud Hama'alah such a lamp was also dated to the thirteenth-fourteenth centuries CE 486 Type 47 lamps were found in the Crusader fortress of Montfort (Qal'at al-Qurein)487 and at Hammat Gader.488 This type parallels Fustāt Type J, dated by Kubiak to the thirteenth(?), fourteenth and fifteenth centuries CE,489 and Type III-3c, dated by Kawatoko to the Mamluk period.490 It is equivalent to Types 58b and 58c at Antioch, dated by Waagé to the eleventh-fourteenth centuries CE and perhaps later.491 Type 47 lamps were also discovered at Hama and dated to the fourteenth century CE, on the basis of comparison with the Mamluk pottery from Raqqa, al-Mina and Baalbek.492 Lamps of this type were found at Qasr al- Hayr al-Sharqi,493 and one lamp at Baalbek 494 Such lamps were discovered in Cyprus and dated to the eleventh- twelfth centuries CE.495 A lamp originating in Egypt is in the museum in Amman 496 At Bet Shean, the glazed lamp was discovered near the temple (L. 831) with Mamluk pottery. The two unglazed lamps were found near the amphitheater, one of them near the entrance to a vault beneath the Byzantine street (L. 379) with Mamluk pottery, and the second in a water channel (L. 357) with Crusader-Mamluk pottery. Type 47 lamps may apparently be dated to the second half of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries CE. Type 48 (No. 495) One fragment of this type was discovered at Bet Shean. It is made from reddish-brown clay and glazed on the inside with a yellowish-green lead glaze. Where it is not slipped under the glaze, brown spots are visible. The lamp is wheel- made and composed of two parts. The very small inner bowl is low and lacks a wick hole; the outer bowl, very little of which was preserved, is taller than the inner bowl. The rim of the inner bowl is broken a little at the spot from which a loop handle was drawn to the outer bowl. The lamp has a small, high disc base. Two lamps of this type were discovered in the Monastery of St. Mary of Carmel and dated, with pottery found there, to the thirteenth century CE. According to Pringle, the lack of a wick hole attests to this being not an oil lamp but a candlestick in the shape of a lamp.497 This type parallels Type 58c at Antioch, dated by Waagé to the fourteenth century CE and perhaps later.498 A lamp of this type was discovered at Hama and dated to the fourteenth century CE 115</page><page sequence="122">Local clay lamps, Type 46. 116</page><page sequence="123">Local clay lamps, Type 46 (cont.)

It belongs to the late stage of this room and was discovered with early Islamic and Mamluk pottery. A date of the second half of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries CE may be proposed for this lamp. Type 49 (No. 496) A single fragment of a lamp of this type was discovered. It is made from reddish-brown clay and traces of glaze remain on it. The lamp is wheel-made and has one reservoir The nozzle, which is not completely preserved, protrudes from the body. The lamp has a low disc base. A lamp of this type was discovered at Tell 'Arqa.501 This fragment was found south of the facade of the Central Monument (L. 508) in a surface level at Bet Shean. It is proposed that this lamp be dated to the second half of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries CE. Type 50 (Nos. 497-498) Three examples of this lamp type were found: two are almost entirely preserved, while only a small fragment of the base of the third lamp remains. This lamp type consists of a wheel-made bowl pinched in one corner to create a nozzle. It has a slightly raised disc base. The lamps are made from reddish-brown clay and are glazed. No. 497 is glazed with green lead glaze on the inside and has a spot of white slip near the rim on the outside, where there are also spots of green glaze on the body and base. No. 498 is also green glazed on the inside, and where there is no slip under the glaze a brown spot is visible; on the outside there is a band of white slip near the rim and brown spots on the body and base. Only a small fragment of the base of the third lamp is preserved; it is green glazed on the inside. A lamp of this type was published from 'Atlit. The accompanying ceramic finds were dated to between the Crusader conquest (1217-1291 CE) and the first century of the Mamluk occupation.502 A lamp of this type found in the Armenian Garden in Jerusalem was dated to the Mamluk period,503 and such lamps were discovered at Bethany504 and Sepphoris.505 At Fustāt this type parallels Type L, dated by Kubiak to the late and post-Mamluk period,506 and Kawatoko's Type III- 1. 507 This type parallels Type 59 at Antioch, defined by Waagé as post-medieval.508 Lamps of this type were also discovered at Hama,509 Qasr al-Hayr al- Sharqi510 and Baalbek,511 and such lamps were published by 'Amr.512 At Bet Shean, one lamp was discovered in a vault in the amphitheater (L. 611) with the complete Type 46 lamp and the Type 51 lamp. The pottery from this locus dates from the early Islamic through Mamluk periods. The second lamp was discovered in Valley Street (L. 554) with ceramic finds that also date from the early Islamic through Mamluk periods. The numismatic finds include coins of the Byzantine through Abbasid periods. The third fragment was found near the temple in a surface level. These lamps' can probably be dated to the second half of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries CE, and apparently did not continue in use beyond the fourteenth century CE. Type 51 (No. 499) One almost complete lamp of this type, made from dark brown clay, was discovered. It is a wheel-made bowl pinched in one corner to create a nozzle. The lamp has a string-cut base. Many lamps of this type were discovered at Emmaus.513 Type 51 lamps were also found at Abu Gosh,514 'Ein Kerem,515 Horvat 'Aqav (Ramat Hanadiv)516 and Hama.517 At Bet Shean this lamp, as stated above, was found in a vault in the amphitheater (L. 611) with a Type 50 lamp. This type apparently first appeared with Type 50 but continued to exist, with some changes, into the Ottoman period.518 119</page><page sequence="126">NUTIÜS lģ Oren and Rappaport 1984: 123, Pl. 13:E. 2.

Sussman distinguishes between four Samaritan types; the type under discussion is the earliest of the four. One type parallels Type 24 and the two other types parallel Type 32 at Bet Shean. • For an extensive discussion of Samaritan lamps, see Sussman 1976, 1978, 1983 and 1986/7. For lamps decorated with Samaritan inscriptions or motifs, see also Reifenberg 1936: Pl.

A lamp from Caesarea bearing a Samaritan inscription whose filling hole remained closed was published by Sussman 1986/7: 134, Fig. 2, and such a lamp was also published by Israeli and Avida 1988: 139, No. 396. See there pp. 137-141 for other lamps of this type, except for lamps Nos. 404-406, which parallel Type 24 at Bet Shean. 103.

These two lamps parallel Elgavish's Type 33, dated to the first half of the fourth century CE (Elgavish 1962: 194). Similar lamps were published by Israeli and Avida 1988: 111, Nos. 318-319. 114. Kennedy 1963: 87f. Altogether there are 45 lamps of the type under discussion in this collection. Some of them are identical to the Bet Shean lamps and may have been made in the same mold. According to Kennedy, all the lamps whose origin is known come from the Jordan Valley. 115. Elgavish 1962: 193. 116. Arav 1980: 84-86, Group C. Nine lamps of this type were discovered in this mausoleum, all belonging to Group 1. 117. Sellers and Baramki 1953: 4 If, Type X. Four lamps were found there. 118.

His analysis shows that the earthquake of 749 CE "did not result in a major interruption in the occupation of the site". The pottery found with Type 36 lamps was dated by him to Periods 1 and 2 (the late eighth-early ninth centuries CE). On the other hand, Baramki' s typological division is valid, and the dates that he assigned to the lamps on the basis of his understanding of the stratigraphy of the site accord with the finds from Bet Shean. 308.

The molds can be divided into four types. Type 1 (Nos. 500-501) Two molds for the manufacture of the two variants of Type 29, the Jerash lamp, were found. One was for the upper part of the lamp, and the second for the base. No. 500 is made from reddish-brown clay. The rim is decorated with a radial design. The upper part of the handle is ornamented with lines, and the lower part with a cross. The baçk of the mold bears a wavy line design. A mold similar to this one was discovered in the Church of Bishop Marianos at Jerash.1 Molds and large quantities of lamps were found in the lamp-maker's factory in front of the temple of Artemis there.2 Two other molds from the excavations at Jerash, one for the upper part of the lamp and the second for the lower part, were mentioned by Day.3 Another mold for manufacture of a Jerash lamp with a tongue handle was found in the hippodrome at Jerash; it was dated, together with the lamps found with it, to the late sixth and seventh centuries CE.4 Molds were also discovered in a residential area by the south decumanus.5 The mold from Bet Shean and that from the church at Jerash parallel Group II of Scholl, who divided the lamp assemblage discovered at Jerash into six groups. He dates the lamps of this group to the second half of the seventh century CE, though in his opinion they may already have been in use at the end of the sixth century CE.6 No. 501 is made from light brown clay and is not preserved to its full height. It is 10.5 cm long and 4.2 cm high. The mold was used for an elongated ring base decorated all around with wavy lines, stylized branches and the Greek letter O. The designs are very shallow. Jerash lamps with a decorated base from the excavations at Jerash in 1928-1929 were published by Day.7 Lamps of both variants, which were found at Jerash with Umayyad coins, were published by Da'nah.8 A lamp with a similar base which bears a Kufic inscription in its center was published by Khairy and 'Amr.9 The first mold from Bet Shean (No. 500) was discovered in a room near the Roman basilica (L. 565), close to another room that housed a kiln in the Umayyad period. The ceramic assemblage is Byzantine and Umayyad and the numismatic finds comprise two Byzantine coins, an Arab- Byzantine coin, an Umayyad coin and two unidentifiable coins. The second mold (No. 501) was found near the perimeter wall of the amphitheater (L. 89080). Pottery and a coin of the Umayyad period were found with this mold. None of the Jerash lamps from the assemblage discovered at Bet Shean was made in either of these molds (though the handles of six of these lamps bear a cross decoration, they end in a zoomorphic head). Jerash lamps with a decorated base in the shape of the second mold are very rare at Bet Shean; only one fragment (No. 312, not made in this mold) was found, and they are rare even at Jerash. Type 2 (Nos. 502-503) Two molds of this type, intended for the manufacture of Type 36 lamps with a conical handle, were discovered. One mold was for the upper part of the lamp, and the second for its base. The first mold (No. 502), which is almost completely preserved, is made from dark brown clay with small black grits and small stones. It is 10.9 cm long and 3.1 cm high. The rim is decorated with herring-bone pattern in opposing directions and a string of small impressed circles. The channel is ornamented with a cross and dots. A mold for the upper part of a lamp of this type was discovered in the Umayyad palace at Jabal Usais in Syria, dated to the end of the seventh-early eighth centuries CE.10 This mold was not used to prepare any of the numerous lamps of Type 36 discovered at Bet Shean; in fact, none of the Bet Shean lamps of this type can be defined as a 127</page><page sequence="134">Molds, Type 1 (Nos. 500-501); Type 2 (Nos. 502-503); Type 3 (Nos. 504-505); Type 4 (No. 506). 128</page><page sequence="135">Christian lamp. Lamps with a channel decorated by a cross were published by Bagatti,11 and several are in private collections.12 The second mold (No. 503), which is not completely preserved, is made from buff clay and was used in the manufacture of a ring base decorated with an eight-spoked wheel. Lamps with a base decorated in this manner were discovered at Bet Shean, but it is not possible to determine whether they were made in this mold. A mold used to prepare a similar base was discovered at 'Ain al-Jedīde near Jerusalem. An Umayyad lamp with a conical handle (Type 36) and pottery were also found there. The only coin found was an Umayyad bronze coin of the eighth century CE.13 A similar mold was discovered in the Umayyad palace at Jabal Usais.14 At Bet Shean the first mold (No. 502) was discovered beneath stone debris caused by the earthquake of 749 CE in the eastern bathhouse (L. 95535), with Umayyad pottery, many Umayyad bronze coins and one gold coin of 85 AH/ 700 CE. The second mold (No. 503) was found near the basilica in L. 565, together with mold No. 500. Type 3 (Nos. 504-505) Two molds for the manufacture of Type 37 lamps with a tongue handle were discovered. The molds are for the upper part of the lamp. The first mold (No. 504) is made from light brown clay. It is 9.2 cm long and 3.4 cm high. The rim has a very worn decoration of elongated leaves. The fragment of the second mold (No. 505) is made from limestone. The channel is decorated with two rows of herring-bone pattern; near the wick hole is a flower. A mold of this type and five lamps made from it were found at Ramla.15 At Bet Shean the first mold was discovered near the Central Monument (L. 530). Pottery of the second half of the eighth to eleventh centuries CE and four coins (two Umayyad coins and two unidentified) were found with it. The second mold was discovered during the cleaning of the area of the seats in the amphitheater (L. 230). Umayyad- Abbasid pottery and two coins (a minimus and a late Roman coin) were found with this mold. Lamps decorated with elongated leaves are quite common at Bet Shean (e.g. No. 446), and they were all made in the same mold, probably the first. Lamps with flowers near the wick hole, as in the second mold, were not discovered at Bet Shean. Type 4 (No. 506) One mold used in the manufacture of a pentagonal lamp with a tongue handle was found. The mold is made from yellowish-brown clay. Part of the rim is missing. The mold is 11.9 cm long and 4.5 cm high. The rim is decorated with rhombi, and near the channel is an ornamented circle. The channel bears two connected rhombi. The rim slants slightly inward. This mold was intended for the manufacture of lamps of a type that is known at Caesarea and in a few examples in Tiberias. Lamps from Caesarea were dated by Lenzen to the Abbasid period16 and by Holum to the ninth century CE.17 Three lamps from there, made in the same mold, were dated by Bull to the ninth century CE.18 This type of lamp at Caesarea was dated to the second half of the eighth to first half of the ninth centuries CE by Arnon.19 One lamp discovered in Tiberias was published by Schwartz,20 and two miniature lamps from Tiberias were found in eleventh- century CE contexts 21 The mold from Bet Shean was found in L. 74528 in the Abbasid quarter established after the earthquake of 749 CE, northwest of Valley Street. The pottery discovered with this mold is from the second half of the eighth to eleventh centuries CE. The absence of lamps made from almost all of these molds, especially the pentagonal mold used to prepare a type of lamp that is not known at all at the site, is surprising. It is possible that the molds were used to manufacture lamps intended only for customers from outside the city, or that they were simply never used. 129</page><page sequence="136">NOTES 1.

The first (No. 507), of which the nozzle and part of the rim are preserved, is made from very well-levigated light brown clay and slipped with black-brown slip; it has a pierced lug handle. Of the second lamp (No. 508) only the nozzle is preserved; it too is made from well-levigated light brown clay and is black-slipped. This type parallels Type 9 at Dor, dated to 250-150 BCE.1 Lamps of this type were found at Tirat Yehuda and dated to the end of the fourth and beginning of the third centuries BCE.2 At Samaria they were dated to the third- second centuries BCE.3 This type parallels Howland's Type 32, dated from the late second quarter of the third century BCE to the end of that century and perhaps a little later,4 and Group II at Tarsus, dated to the end of the third and early second centuries BCE.5 This type also parallels Broneer's Type IX, which first appears in the early third century BCE.6 The first lamp was discovered near the temple (L. 95144) and the second near the nymphaeum (L. 54432). As noted in the Introduction, the Hellenistic lamps found in the city center of Bet Shean were not found in a stratum dated to this period. These lamps should apparently be dated, as at Dor, to the mid-third to mid-second centuries BCE. Type 2 (No. 509) One Type 2 lamp, comprising only the carelessly made string-cut base, was found at Bet Shean. The lamp is wheel- made from light gray clay and slipped with black slip; only traces of the slip remain. This type parallels Group III at Corinth. According to Broneer, it was first made before the mid-second century BCE and continued in use into the early part of the second century CE. The lamps are very coarse and carelessly made.7 At Tarsus this lamp is classified as Group VIII, dated to the second and early first centuries BCE and considered to be locally made there.8 The lamp from Bet Shean was discovered near the amphitheater (L. 614). The lamp cannot be dated on the basis of the context in which it was found; a date in the second century BCE is suggested. Type 3 (Nos. 510-512) Eleven fragments of this type were found at Bet Shean. They are made from light brown, pinkish-brown, grayish- brown and buff clay, and slipped with reddish-brown, black-brown and black slip. The fragments consist of a discus decorated with a gladiator (No. 510), nozzles (No. 511), parts of rim and discus, and two handles (No. 512). This type is equivalent to Broneer's Type XXI, dated to the first century CE.9 Lamps of this type found at Masada were dated by Bailey to about 20-80 CE.10 This type parallels Types 18 and 19 at Dor, dated to the late first century BCE and first century CE.11 One example was discovered at Caesarea.12 Several of these lamps are in the Schioessinger collection.13 A local copy of this type found at Bet Shean was presented above (Chapter 1, Type 8). The decorated discus from Bet Shean was found near the basilica gate (L. 84140) with pottery of the first-second centuries CE. One handle was found near the temple (L. 94201) with pottery of the early Roman period. The second handle was discovered in a trial section in Palladius Street (L. 44269) with pottery of the early Roman period and two coins of Alexander Jannaeus (103-76 BCE). One fragment was found in a trial section between the stylobate and the facade wall of the shops in Valley Street (L. 94581) with two coins of the first century CE. Two fragments were recovered from the agora (L. 44224) in the same basket; other finds from the locus are pottery of the first-second centuries CE, a local Type 7 lamp fragment and a silver coin of Trajan of 112/3 CE. The other lamps were found with pottery and coins of the early Roman through early Islamic periods. A date in the first century CE, perhaps only the second half of that century, may be suggested for the lamps 131</page><page sequence="138">Imported clay lamps, Type 1 (Nos. 507-508); Type 2 (No. 509); Type 3 (Nos. 510-512); Type 4 (No. 513); Type 5 (No. 514); Type 6 (No. 515). 132</page><page sequence="139">from Bet Shean; they may have continued to the beginning of the second century CE. Type 4 (No. 513) One lamp of this type, characterized by its triangular nozzle, was found. The lamp, half of which is preserved, is made from pinkish-brown clay and is black-slipped. This type parallels Broneer's Type XXII, dated to the first century CE,14 and Loeschcke's Type I, dated to the first and second centuries CE.15 It is equivalent to Type 20 at Dor.16 A lamp of this type was discovered at Shikmona,17 and a lamp fragment found in the Armenian Garden in Jerusalem was dated to the early first century CE.18 A lamp of this type was published from Abila.19 This type parallels Type 40 at Antioch.20 Lamps of this type are in the Schioessinger collection.21 The lamp from Bet Shean was recovered from the agora (L. 44292) in the same basket as seven local Type 4 lamp fragments; pottery of the first-second centuries CE was also found in the locus. Based on these finds, the lamp may be dated to the first-second centuries CE. Type 5 (No. 514) One fragment of this type was found. It is made from grayish-brown clay and slipped with orange slip, of which only traces remain. The lamp is a fairly deep bowl, 2.9 cm high, which has a flat base and a high pierced handle (not preserved), starting at the base and decorated with two incisions. On the small part of the lamp that survives, the rim and discus are decorated with incisions. The filling hole was apparently formed by breaking the discus. Similar lamps in the British Museum were dated by Bailey to the second half of the first to the first half of the second centuries CE.22 The lamp from Bet Shean was found in the agora (L. 44267) with pottery of the first-second centuries CE, and this date is assigned to the lamp. Type 6 (No. 515) One lamp fragment of this type was discovered. The lamp, half of which is preserved, is made from grayish-brown clay with many white grits. This mold-made lamp has a high hand-made loop handle. A small part of the discus with two filling holes survives; no ornamentation is discernible on this part of the discus. The rim of the lamp is decorated with incised lines and the base is a low ring base. This type generally parallels Type D 1.1 and 1.2 at Karanis, dated to the fourth century CE, and possibly continuing into the early fifth century CE.23 The fragment from Bet Shean was found in a section in one of the shops northwest of Palladius Street (L. 75075). Late Roman, Byzantine and Umayyad pottery was found with the lamp. On the basis of the finds from Karanis, it is suggested that this lamp should be dated to the fourth-fifth centuries CE. Type 7 (Nos. 516-517) Five fragments of Type 7 were discovered at Bet Shean. They are made from orange-brown and grayish-brown clay and slipped with reddish-brown slip. The best-preserved lamp (No. 516), almost half of which survives (after restoration), has a plain rim decorated in the middle with an incised branch. The discus is ornamented with a rosette around the small filling hole. The lamps of this type have a high, solid handle decorated with three lengthwise incisions in the front which become two at the back, where they join the ring base. The other four fragments are three handles (No. 517) and one ring base. This type parallels Broneer's Type XXVIII, which he dated from the mid-third to beginning of the fifth centuries CE.24 A lamp handle of this type was discovered at Jalame and dated to the fourth century CE.25 Lamps of this type were discovered in the Athenian Agora and described by Perlzweig as "Attic lamps of the third and fourth centuries".26 Lamps originating in Athens and now in the British Museum were dated by Bailey to the second half of the fourth and first half of the fifth centuries CE.27 At Bet Shean, the half lamp was found in the arena of the amphitheater (L. 29017) with pottery of the Byzantine period. The ring base was also discovered near the amphitheater (L. 09067), in the thick layer of fill intended to raise the amphitheater ground level to that of the street which was built adjacent to it (see above, Chapter 1, Type 15). Two lamp fragments of local Type 19 were retrieved in the same basket as the base. One handle was found near the amphitheater (L. 39121) with local lamps of Types 15, 17 and 19. One handle was found in the eastern bathhouse (L. 25580) with local lamps of Types 17 and 19, and one handle was discovered in an Abbasid drainage channel near the nymphaeum (L. 74575). A date in the fifth century CE is suggested for the lamps from Bet Shean. Type 8 (Nos. 518-519) Three fragments of this type, which is considered North African, were discovered at Bet Shean.28 They are made from red and orange-brown clay. About half of the upper part of No. 518 survives. The rim is ornamented with ladder design and a small part of the discus, with a small filling hole and part of a decoration in high relief adjacent to it, is 133</page><page sequence="140">Imported clay lamps, Type 7 (Nos. 516-517); Type 8 (Nos. 518-519); Type 9 (No. 520); Type 10 (No. 521). 134</page><page sequence="141">preserved. The handle is vertical and solid. Of the second lamp (No. 519), a small part of the rim and discus is preserved. The rim is decorated with herring-bone pattern and the discus with both stamped and high-relief decoration. The third fragment is a small part of a ring base decorated with grooves. The North African lamps were divided by Hayes into two types. The Bet Shean specimens belong to Type I, dated by Hayes to the fourth to beginning of the fifth centuries CE.29 Such lamps are very rare in excavations; this type parallels Types 15 and 19 at Caesarea,30 and lamp fragments were discovered at Horvat 'Aqav (Ramat Hanadiv),31 Sepphoris32 and Geva.33 Some lamps of this type are in the Schioessinger collection.34 At Bet Shean, Nos. 518 and 519 were found near the amphitheater, in the thick layer of fill intended to raise the amphitheater ground level (see Chapter 1, Type 15). This street was built in 522 CE, according to the inscription inlaid among its stones. In this layer were found very large quantities of Byzantine pottery fragments, many complete and fragmentary local lamps of Types 15-20 and 25, and coins of the fourth-fifth centuries CE. The base fragment was found with a sherd of a North African red slip bowl in a wall of a room built on the street near the nymphaeum; this room is part of a Mamluk structure. On the basis of the finds from Bet Shean, Type 8 may be dated to the fifth century CE. • Type 9 (No. 520) One handle of this type was discovered. The lamps of this type are characterized by an elongated body and high, broad handle. Some of the lamps have a clear channel along the nozzle and the discus is surrounded by a pronounced ridge. The filling hole is large. In a few cases the handles are in a human shape and comprise part of the lamp's body.35 The fragment from Bet Shean is made from grayish-brown clay with traces of brown slip. The trapezoid handle is decorated with a design of superimposed semicircles and ladder motif. The edges of the handle are straight This type parallels Type 53 at Antioch, dated by Waagé to the fifth-sixth centuries CE.36 Lamps of this type discovered at Hama dated from the fifth-sixth centuries CE.37 Many lamps of this type were discovered in cemeteries at Hims, dated to the third-seventh centuries CE.38 This type parallels Dobbins's Type 21; according to him, such lamps were also found at Dibsi Faraj, Misis and Anavarza and were produced at Antioch. Lamps discovered at other sites in Syria were produced, in his opinion, in different centers.39 The distribution of this type defines it as a Syrian lamp. Other lamps of this type in private collections have been published,40 and several such lamps are in the British Museum.41 The fragment from Bet Shean was discovered in a water channel near the amphitheater (L. 291). The pottery discovered with it was mostly of the Byzantine period, though some was of the Roman and early Islamic periods. This lamp cannot be dated on the basis of the finds from Bet Shean. Dobbins's view, based on the excavations at Antioch and Dibsi Faraj, is that lamps of this type date from the sixth-seventh centuries CE and did not continue in use to the early Islamic period; this date is acceptable here.42 Type 10 (No. 521) One complete lamp of this type, lacking only a small part at the back of the handle, was discovered. It is made from pinkish clay and decorated with a stylized branch and bunches of grapes. The filling hole is very small and surrounded by a plain discus. The channel is very narrow. The lamp has a solid handle and a low ring base. Lamps of this type from Ephesus, now in the British Museum, were dated by Bailey to 550-650 CE.43 The lamp from Bet Shean was found between the stylobate and the facade of the shops in Palladius Street, under the installation layer of a mosaic floor (L. 15307). Pottery of the Byzantine period was found with the lamp. A date of the sixth-seventh centuries CE is suggested for this type. 135</page><page sequence="142">NOTES 1.

The Bet Shean lamp differs from those of Karanis in several features, but is like them in that it is a mold- made discus lamp to which a hand-made loop handle was affixed. The lamps from Karanis are close parallels to the lamp from Bet Shean, but the latter was not made there, as indicated by the different clay from which it was made. The lamps from Karanis are made from reddish to brown clay and most of them have a glossy red slip. 24. Broneer 1930: 102-114. 25. Manzoni MacDonnell 1988: 119f, 131, 133, No. 79.

This type of filling hole is typical of the clay lamps known as "Karm al-Shaikh lamps" (Chapter 1, Type 15), dated to the fourth-fifth centuries CE. Surrounding the ridge is a circle of incised lines. On each side of the filling hole are three raised lines, ail imitation of the double axe design that appears on local clay lamps of Type 7 of the late first-third centuries CE. The nozzle is small and rounded. The ring handle is not preserved and the base is a low disc base. Thé lamp was discovered near the basilica in a surface level (L. 571). On the basis of the imitation of the double axe design and the large filling hole, it may be dated to the third to early fourth centuries CE. Type 2 (No. 523) This lamp has a high handle decorated with a shofar, lulav and etrog. The seven-branched menorah that should appear between the shofar and lulav is missing.2 The menorah and accompanying symbols are characteristic motifs of Jewish and Samaritan art of the late Roman and Byzantine periods.3 Behind the high handle is a loop handle used for holding the lamp. The nozzle is elongated and decorated with vertical lines. The lamp was broken under the nozzle in antiquity and repaired by adding a piece of bronze, which is not preserved. The wick hole has a broad rim and the filling hole is small and surrounded by a slightly sunken discus. A lid, which has not survived, originally covered the filling hole. The rim is undecorated. The lamp has a high ring base in whose center is a square recess, enabling it to be placed on a lampstand. An identical lamp is in the Schioessinger collection.4 The lamp from Bet Shean was discovered in a shop in the Umayyad shopping street destroyed in the earthquake of 749 CE and not reconstructed (L. 706). The resemblance between the lamp's motifs and those of mosaic floors in synagogues, and the discovery of this lamp in the shop, enable the lamp to be dated to the fifth-seventh centuries CE. It was apparently in use until the time of the destruction, January 749 CE. Type 3 (No. 524) This lamp is characterized by an elongated body. The high handle, decorated with tendrils, is quite prominent. The ornamentation that should appear in the center of the handle is not preserved. The nozzle is elongated. The wick hole is small and surrounded by a broad rim. An addition consisting of a rectangular monogrammed piece of bronze is visible on the underside of the wick hole. The filling hole is small and the lid that originally covered it is not preserved. The lamp is undecorated, except for two ellipses incised on either side of the handle. The lamp has a high ring base in whose center is a square recess, enabling it to be placed on a lampstand. A lamp with a similar handle, but with two nozzles, is in the Dumbarton Oaks collection. In the center of the handle is a cross, a motif that may have also decorated the handle of the lamp from Bet Shean. This lamp was dated by Ross to the sixth century CE.5 Another lamp, more like the Bet Shean example, is in the British Museum. Its handle too is decorated with a cross.6 It is possible that the cross that decorated the lamp from Bet Shean was intentionally removed by its non-Christian owner. The lamp from Bet Shean was discovered near the temple in the destruction level of the earthquake of 749 CE (L. 75005). Its finding in this level indicates that the lamp, which should apparently be dated to the fifth-sixth and perhaps the seventh centuries CE, was in use at the time of the destruction. 137</page><page sequence="144">Bronze lamps, Type 1 (No. 522); Type 2 (No. 523). 138</page><page sequence="145">Bronze lamps, Type 3 (No. 524, 1:2). 139</page><page sequence="146">Bronze lids (Nos. 525-526); bronze lampstand (No. 527). 140</page><page sequence="147">As noted above, two lids and a lampstand, which did not belong to any of the bronze lamps, were discovered at Bet Shean. One lid (No. 525) is in the shape of a stylized flower. The second lid (No. 526) is plain and high, crowned with a rounded knob. The lampstand (No. 527) has three legs; its upper and lower part were made separately. A lamp with a similar lid to No. 526 is in the Schioessinger collection.7 Some lamps with identical lids in the British Museum were dated by Bailey to the sixth- seventh centuries CE.8 Another lamp with an identical lid is in the Damascus Museum.9 Lampstands in different shapes, some of which are dated to the sixth-seventh centuries CE, are in the British Museum.10 A few lampstands are in the Damascus Museum.11 At Bet Shean, lid No. 525 was discovered in a room near Valley Street (L. 74605) with Byzantine and Umayyad pottery. Lid No. 526 was found near the temple (L. 54301) with pottery from the Byzantine through Abbasid periods. The lampstand was found near the amphitheater. Its shaft was discovered in a room (L. 103) built near the Byzantine street adjacent to the amphitheater, with pottery of the Byzantine through Mamluk periods and a local clay lamp of Type 36, and its legs were found in a surface layer (L. 99000). The lids and the lampstand should be dated, like the lamps of Types 2 and 3, to the fifth-seventh centuries CE. NOTES 1. A few lamps were published by Zori (1970), but most are unpublished. A bronze lamp on a lampstand and a bronze lamp lid found during the excavations on Tel Bet Shean were published by Fitzgerald 1931: PL XXXVII:9, PL XXXVIII: 1. Judging from these finds, Bet Shean is the site in Palestine, and perhaps the entire region, at which excavations have yielded the largest number of bronze lamps. 2.

The lanterns date from the Byzantine, Umayyad and Abbasid-Fatimid periods. General parallels are given at the end of the chapter. The Byzantine Period (Nos. 528-529) Small parts of two lanterns of this period were found at Bet Shean. Only the ring handle and a small part of the body of the first lantern (No. 528) are preserved. The lantern is made from orange-brown clay, fired to gray and brown on the surface and well fired to a metallic quality. The second lantern (No. 529) consists only of part of the body. It is made from light brown clay and has large roughly equidistant holes. Fragment No. 528 was found in a room south of the rear wall of the nymphaeum (L. 54214), in the Byzantine occupation level. In this locus and the nearby one (L. 54215), some local lamp fragments of Type 21 were discovered; this type is dated to the fifth-early sixth centuries CE. The ceramic assemblage dates from the period between the mid-fifth and early sixth centuries CE. The numismatic finds include more than 100 coins: the earliest is of the mid-third century CE, most are minimi of the fourth-fifth centuries CE, while the latest is an M coin (512-539 CE). Fragment No. 529 was found in a shop in Northwest Street (L. 261 12), in a layer of fill near one of its walls. Late Roman and Byzantine pottery was discovered with the lantern. Based on these finds, the lanterns can be dated to the fifth-sixth centuries CE; they perhaps continued in use until the end of the Byzantine period. The Umayyad Period (Nos. 530-533) The complete lantern and a few fragments belong to this period: The complete lantern (No. 530) is made from buff clay. In the lower part of the body are three rows of roughly equidistant holes, while in the upper part the holes are more crowded. The lantern has a rectangular opening and omphalus base, similar to the base of the Umayyad flasks made in the kilns at Bet Shean. At the top is a ring handle. This lantern was probably made in the kilns at Bet Shean. No. 531 comprises a small portion of the upper part of a lantern, including the ring handle. It is made from grayish- brown clay. The small holes are arranged in a zigzag line between two carinations decorated with a thumb-indented band. No. 532 consists of part of the body and the beginning of the handle. It is made from grayish-brown clay, fired to buff on the surface, and has large holes. No. 533 consists only of the inner part of the wide ring handle and a small part of the body joined to it. This lantern is made from orange-brown clay and is well fired to a metallic quality. The complete lantern (No. 530) was found in a structure built on the Byzantine street adjacent to the amphitheater (L. 617). The lantern was found with Byzantine and Umayyad pottery and two complete local lamps of the Byzantine-Umayyad Type 32. Fragment No. 531 was found in the amphitheater (L. 19051) with Umayyad pottery, an Umayyad coin and a local lamp of the Umayyad Type 36. Fragment No. 532 was found in a shop (L. 706) in the Umayyad shopping street, in which local clay lamps of the Umayyad Types 35 and 36 and the bronze lamp of Type 2 were also discovered. The handle (No. 533) was found in the nymphaeum, in the destruction level caused by the earthquake of 749 CE (L. 840); this locus also yielded two local lamp fragments of Type 35. The Abbasid-Fatimid Periods (No. 534) One lantern dating from these periods, consisting of the inner part of the handle and a small part of the body, was found. The lantern is made from orange-brown clay, fired to buff on the surface. It was found northwest of Valley Street (L. 64707) with pottery of the Abbasid-Fatimid periods. 143</page><page sequence="149">Lanterns, Byzantine period (Nos. 528-529); Umayyad period (No. 530). 144</page><page sequence="150">Lanterns, Umayyad period (cont.)

The distribution of types found at Bet Shean will serve as a basis for discussion of the relationship between Bet Shean and other regions in Palestine, and ties between Bet Shean and Transjordan. This chapter will also analyze the relationship between Bet Shean and Fustāt, the only site from which lamps dated from the Umayyad through Mámluk periods have been published in detail. The different lamp types may shed light on the interaction between these two cities, as well as on the broader relationship between Palestine and Egypt. Other topics examined are when did relations between Palestine and i Syria commence, what was the nature of the ties between Palestine and Lebanon, and what is the expression in the material culture of the fact that from 634 CE the entire region was under Islamic rule. These and other issues are treated with the caution due to all finds of material culture, since the published data do not necessarily reflect the actual situation. Many excavated sites have remained unpublished or are only partially published. Thus, all assumptions and conclusions are valid only for the time at which they are written, and the distribution map of the various types may well change in the future. The discussion will focus on the local clay lamps, since they constitute the majority of the finds, as opposed to the imported lamps, which are generally chance finds. The present chapter is based on the presentation of the lamps in Chapter 1; references that appear there are not repeated and only new references are given. Tables 1-5 (pp. 152-155) summarize the numbers of lamps of each type found at Bet Shean, as well as the distribution of the various types found in excavations throughout Palestine and the neighboring regions. Two Hellenistic lamp types (Types 1-2) were found at Bet Shean. As noted above, the Hebrew University expedition did not uncover an occupation layer dating from the Hellenistic period (the Hellenistic city is located on Tel Bet Shean and on Tel Iztaba). Thus, the few Hellenistic lamps found by the Hebrew University expedition should be viewed as chance finds, apart from No. 3, found in the level of the foundation of Bet Shean, when this lamp type was still in use or at the very end of its use. Conclusions pertaining to the Hellenistic lamps from Bet Shean must be based on the finds discovered by the Israel Antiquities Authority expedition on Tel Iztaba.1 Ten lamp types dating from the early Roman period (Types 3-12, Type 7 continuing to the late Roman period) were, found at Bet Shean. Of these, three (Types 4, 6 and 7) were in widespread use at Bet Shean during this period, while the rest are represented by only a few sherds and thus can be viewed as chance finds. Six lamp types found at Bet Shean can be attributed to the late Roman period (Types 13-18, the latter four continuing to the fifth century CE). Judging by the quantities, three of these (Types 13, 16 and 17) were in widespread use at Bet Shean during this period. Type 15, which is common only in Jerusalem and nearby, was represented by 16 examples at Bet Shean. Though this is probably the largest assemblage found in the north, Type 1 5 should still be considered rare at Bet Shean. Types 14 and 1 8 were represented only by isolated sherds. Fourteen types date from the Byzantine period (Types 19- 32, Types 28, 29, 31 and 32 continuing to the Umayyad period). The main type of the fifth century CE at Bet Shean is Type 19. The large number of complete or almost complete examples is notable; in fact, this is by far the most plentiful lamp type found at Bet Shean in any period. Types 20-22, 28 and 32 were also common at Bet Shean. Only a few examples of the other types were found. Types 33 and 34 belong to the transition from the Byzantine to the Umayyad periods. However, their scarcity at Bet Shean and lack of parallels at other sites limit their value for this discussion. 147</page><page sequence="153">Three lamp types were used at Bet Shean during the Umayyad period: Type 29, which first appeared during the Byzantine period, and Types 35 and 36, the main lamp types in use at Bet Shean during the Umayyad period. Type 36 continued in use in the early Abbasid period as well. Six lamp types dating from the mid-eighth to eleventh centuries CE (Types 37-42) were found at Bet Shean. The main type was Type 37, while the other five may be considered negligible during this period. The remaining types (Types 43-51) were used at Bet Shean during the twelfth to fourteenth centuries CE. Of these, Types 44 and 45 were found in substantial quantities, while only isolated examples of each of the other types were found. Analysis of the lamps at Bet Shean indicates that only during the Byzantine period were there lamp types that were clearly indigenous to the Jordan Valley or the Bet Shean Valley. The best example is Type 19, which was apparently manufactured at Bet Shean, though molds used in the manufacture of lamps of this type were not found. Type 20 is also a lamp that was apparently made at Bet Shean, a suggestion supported by the lack of parallels from nearby sites (though Type 20 is much less abundant than Type 19). An additional type that can be defined as specific to the Jordan Valley or Bet Shean Valley is Type 21, a variant of the Beit Nattif lamp. It was found only in the excavations at Bet Shean and at Pella. Type 16, extensively distributed in Bet Shean and Transjordan, is also probably a Jordan Valley type; from there it apparently spread to the Galilee. During the early Roman period, two of the types (Types 4 and 7) that are common at Bet Shean appear throughout the country and thus are not characteristic of any particular region. The third (Type 6) is a northern variation of an initially southern type. During the late Roman period, one of the three common types (Type 13) is a local imitation of the Jebel Jofeh lamp, which originated in Amman and has otherwise been found only at Bet Shean and Sepphoris. Another (Type 16) is a purely northern form, while the third (Type 17) appears throughout the country and cannot be deemed characteristic of any particular region. As mentioned above, the Byzantine period is the only time in which the main type found at the site (Type 19) is a local one. Two additional common types (Types 20-21) are local to or typical of the Jordan Valley. Another (Type 22) is northern and a further type (Type 28) is common in the center and south of the country, though it is also relatively well known at Bet Shean, Pella and Jerash. The fifth (Type 32) is a Samaritan type that is popular in the north and center of the country, the hub of Samaritan settlement. • Of the two types common at Bet Shean during the Umayyad period, one (Type 35) is common only in the north, while Type 36, which is more dominant, is common throughout the entire country. The same is true of Type 37, the dominant type of the Abbasid-Fatimid periods as well. Nine types (43-51) dating from the twelfth-fourteenlh centuries CE have been found at Bet Shean, though two of these (Types 44 and 45), which are mold-made, are more prevalent. Type 44 apparently originated in Jerusalem and its environs, judging from the distribution of the few lamps published; one such lamp was found at 'Atlit, representing the northernmost find of this type. As opposed to this, Type 45 is distributed more or less evenly in the north and center of the country. Only isolated examples of the remaining types have been found at Bet Shean, one mold-made and the rest wheel-made. It is difficult to determine their distribution pattern due to the dearth of published examples of these types, especially in the south. Examination of the various types found at Bet Shean indicates that despite the wide variety of lamps, most of them are not characteristic only of the region in which Bet Shean is located, but rather are at home in the north in general, and mainly to the north of Bet Shean itself. Only two or three of the 5 1 types discovered at Bet Shean can be defined as local types that were perhaps manufactured at the site itself or nearby. The existence of a Samaritan community at Bet Shean is well known from written sources as well as from the archaeological record: the Samaritan synagogue uncovered at the site is the most definitive find reflecting the presence of this community.2 The three lamp types that are defined as Samaritan (Types 18, 24 and 32) have been found at Bet Shean, though they are not especially common there. Of these, two (Types 18 and 32) sometimes bear Samaritan inscriptions; indeed, these are the only known types that bear such inscriptions. Inscribed Samaritan lamps have not been found at Bet Shean, though one was found at Tel Midge near Bet Shean (see Chapter 1, note 101). Of the three Samaritan lamp types, Type 32, dated to the late Byzantine and Umayyad periods, is the most common at Bet Shean and was perhaps manufactured at the site. It can be chronologically pegged to the time of the Samaritan revolt in 529 CE and the period following its suppression. It can thus be concluded that Samaritans continued to live at Bet Shean after the rebellion or, alternatively, that a non- Samaritan population used these lamps. Three of the lamp types (Types 5, 15 and 27) originated in Jerusalem or nearby. Only two sherds of one lamp belonging to Type 5, the Citadel lamp, were found and this type can essentially be considered a chance find. Sixteen complete lamps and fragments of Type 15, the Karm al- Shaikh lamp, were found. As far as is known, this is the northernmost find of such a large quantity of lamps of this type. Four handles of Type 27 were discovered at Bet 148</page><page sequence="154">Shean; judging from its distribution this type too originated in Jerusalem and its environs, since only isolated examples have been found at other sites in Palestine and Transjordan. Two additional lamp types of the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods (Types 44 and 45) appear to have originated in Jerusalem and its environs, since this is the main region of their distribution. The finding of molds for the manufacture of Type 45 lamps at Nebi Samwil, very close to Jerusalem, strengthens this assumption. This type is also found at other sites in the north. However, since sites in the south of the country have remained largely unpublished, and no lamps of these types are reported at published sites, it is impossible to determine whether these types were in use in the south as well. Isolated examples of Type 45 have been found outside Palestine. Type 28, the candlestick lamp, is common mainly in the center and south of the country. Bet Shean yielded 46 of these, a relatively large number, since lamps of this type are usually not particularly frequent in the north. For example, only two were found at Hammat Gader. On the other hand, quite large numbers of such lamps were found at Pella, Jerash, Irbid and Mount Nebo. Only one sherd was found at Busrā in the Hauran. Mount Nebo is a pilgrimage site and thus it is not surprising to find a significant number of Christian lamps at that site. The substantial presence of such lamps at Pella, Jerash and Irbid is an indication of trade or evèn local manufacture. Two of the types can be defined as Galilean. Type 14, the Beth She'arim lamp, is very rare at Bet Shean and only two sherds were found. Type 30, the al-Bassa lamp, occurred at the site in five examples. This scarcity seems to indicate that lamps that were typical of the Galilee and further north in Phoenicia were not known in the Jordan Valley. Thus, the finds from Bet Shean can be considered chance finds. An additional type of regional character is Type 23, which appears to have originated in Caesarea or its vicinity, in view of the molds for its manufacture that were found at that site. Two of these lamps were found at Bet Shean, a few were discovered at Sepphoris and Horvat 'Aqav (Ramat Hanadiv), and one lamp each was found at Jalame, Capernaum and in the synagogues at 'En Gedi and Ma'on (the latter two the southernmost sites at which this type has been found). Judging by their decoration, these lamps could have been used by any of the three population groups inhabiting Palestine at the time: Christians, pagans and Jews. However, the extremely limited distribution of these lamps indicates that they should be considered stray finds at Bet Shean, 'En Gedi and Ma'on. This is an additional example of a lamp type with a restricted distribution that did not' extend far beyond its place of manufacture. The opposite relationship was discerned between Bet Shean and Caesarea for the pentagonal lamp; though this type was common at Caesarea and Tiberias and totally absent at Bet Shean, a mold for its manufacture was found at Bet Shean (see Chapter 2). Connections between Bet Shean and Transjordan Five lamp types that originated at Jerash and Amman were found at Bet Shean (Types 10-13 and 29). Three of them (Types 10-12) are local imitations of types discovered in the "potter's store" at Jerash. Type 13 is a local imitation of the Jebel Jofeh lamp (the original type found at Jebel Jofeh in Amman had several local variants). Type 29, the Jerash lamp, is perhaps the best known and had great longevity; it had two variants, and two molds found at Bet Shean were intended for their manufacture. One of these variants is rare even at Jerash and the presence of a mold to manufacture it at Bet Shean is very surprising. An additional tie between Bet Shean and Jerash is provided by two anthropomorphic pottery vessels found in the destruction level in one of the shops in the Street of the Monuments at Bet Shean3; one such vessel has been published from Jerash.4 Since Bet Shean was a member of the confederacy of ten Hellenistic- Roman cities known as the Decapolis, correlation between the material cultures of Bet Shean, Amman and Jerash is not surprising; rather, it is the small number of lamps that is unexpected. Of the five types, Type 13 is the most common, appearing in 71 examples. In the Umayyad period the assemblages of pottery vessels are identical at Bet Shean, Pella, Jerash and Amman, the only cities that have been widely excavated. On the other hand, the lamp that was characteristic of Bet Shean and Palestine on the whole (Type 36) is not known at Amman. Only two such lamps have been published from Jerash, one dated to the Umayyad period and the other to the Abbasid period. One lamp was found at Pella and dated to the end of the Umayyad period, while a few more were found in a layer dating from the beginning of the Abbasid period. This leads to the conclusion that the common lamp type in use during the Umayyad period in Transjordan was the Jerash lamp (Type 29). On the other hand, during the Abbasid-Fatimid periods, the lamp typical of Bet Shean and Palestine as a whole (Type 37) was also typical of Transjordan. No lamps from Pella, Jerash or Amman that date from the eleventh century CE on have been published, apart from a Type 45 lamp dated to the Mamluk period found in Amman. Of the five cities of the Decapolis that have been excavated and yielded published lamps, Pella, Jerash, Amman, Gadara and Abila, the closest connection was found to have been between Bet Shean and Pella, which is the closest geographically as well. Fifteen lamp types were 149</page><page sequence="155">common to both cities; the latest among them is Type 37. Some of the types are characteristically Palestinian, such as Types 17 and 21, the imitations of the Beit Nattif lamp, and Type 32, one of the Samaritan lamp types. One example of Type 19 was found in a tomb at Pella; the distribution of this type is limited to Bet Shean and its vicinity. Another lamp common to the two cities is Type 16, which was very numerous at both Bet Shean and Pella. Nine lamp types found at Abila were also found at Bet Shean. However, because of the limited scope of the excavations carried out at this site the finds are somewhat random and thus it is difficult to draw conclusions. Two of these are the Jebel Jofeh lamp (Type 13) and the Jerash lamp (Type 29). One knife-pared lamp (Type 4) was published from Abila.5 Another early type found there is the discus lamp (Type 7), which is common throughout the region during the early Roman period. Type 28 lamps were found at Abila, as at Jerash and Pella. One handle of Type 27 was published from Abila. Lamps of Type 16 were found at this site, at nearby Gadara and at Pella. The latest lamp type published from Abila is Type 36, the Umayyad lamp with a conical handle. The third city with close connections with Bet Shean was Gadara: the two cities shared eight lamp types, the latest of which was of the Umayyad period. Though they are well known at Hammat Gader, no Umayyad lamps with a conical handle (Type 36) were published from Gadara; only Type 35 was found at the latter site. Gadara also yielded several Palestinian types: a few sherds of Types 46 and 17 and even a sherd of a Samaritan lamp of Type 1 8. Lamps of Type 16 were found at Gadara, just as at Pella. It is not known whether they were locally produced or imported. Their very wide distribution at both Bet Shean and Hammat Gader, which was part of the city of Gadara, make it difficult to determine where they were made. It is possible that they were made at each site separately, with the molds imported from elsewhere.7 The close affinity of Hammat Gader to Gadara is exemplified in Type 25, which was very common at both Hammat Gader and Gadara; at the latter site it was defined as the "North Jordan lamp". The large numbers found suggest that it was produced there and subsequently exported to Bet Shean, where only two such lamps were found, as well as to a few other sites. Lamps of this type were also found at Abila, which is geographically close to Gadara, but not at Pella or Jerash. Lamps of Type 28 (the candlestick lamp) were not found at Gadara, though two of these were found at Hammat Gader. Eight lamp types were common to Jerash and Bet Shean. Four of them are types that originated at Jerash and were .brought to or imitated at Bet Shean. One of the remaining four, which appears to be quite common, is Type 28. Two lamps of Type 36 were published from Jerash; one was dated to the Umayyad period and the second to the Abbasid period. This type was found at Pella as well and dated there to the late , Umayyad and early Abbasid periods. Another city of the Decapolis is Amman, where five of the Bet Shean lamp types were found, in addition to the Jebel Jofeh lamp (Type 13) and the Jerash lamp (Type 29). The earliest lamp found there is Type 4 (the knife-pared lamp).8 Additional Palestinian lamps found there are Types 28 and 32, the latter a Samaritan lamp that was also found at Pella, Mount Nebo and Umm al-Rasas. Type 37 (the Abbasid-Fatimid lamp) and Type 45 (a Mamluk mold- made lamp) were also discovered in Amman. The only city in Transjordan from which wheel-made lamps are published is Aqaba. Lamps of Type 3 1 dated to the late Byzantine and Umayyad periods were found at this site and on Mount Nebo as well; this type is rare at Bet Shean and in northern Palestine in general. Other types found at Aqaba are Types 37 (a mold-made type) and 38 (a wheel-made type) of the Abbasid-Fatimid periods. An additional site from which several lamp types are published is Mount Nebo, which was a pilgrimage site. Two of the lamp types found there (Types 27 and 28) can be defined as Christian. Type 29 was usually decorated with crosses, though several were found without this design; this too can be designated a Christian lamp. Lamps of Types 3 1 and 36 were found at Mount Nebo as well. The presence of a Samaritan lamp (Type 32) at Mount Nebo, as at Umm al- Rasas, is surprising. Other types found at Umm al-Rasas are Types 28, 36 and 37. Type 28 (the candlestick lamp), distributed mainly in the center and south of Palestine, is also well known in Transjordan. Many lamps of this type were found in tombs around Irbid, and they are present at other sites in this region as well. The wide distribution of these lamps indicates that they were in demand throughout the region, perhaps implying that they were manufactured in the Jordan Valley rather than being trade products. Lamps of Type 45 (a Mamluk mold-made lamp) have been published from the site of Heshbon in Transjordan as well. Lamps have been published from two sites in the Hauran: Busrā and Umm al-Jimāl. Four of the types found at Busrā were also found at Bet Shean: the Jerash lamp (Type 29), one example of a candlestick lamp (Type 28) and several examples of lamps with a conical handle (Type 36), found in strata dating from the end of the Umayyad and beginning of the Abbasid periods. The latest lamp published from this site parallels Type 45 at Bet Shean, dated to the Mamluk period. Of the few lamp types published from Umm al-Jimāl, one, the Jerash lamp (Type 29), is found at Bet Shean as well. The pentagonal lamp found at Umm al-Jimāl and at Busrā, Pella, Amman and Hammat Gader9 is unknown at Bet Shean. 150</page><page sequence="156">Connections between Bet Shean and Fustāt There is a similarity between the lamps of Bet Shean and those of Fustāt from the Umayyad to the Mamluk periods. Type 36, the characteristic lamp of the Umayyad period throughout Palestine, was found at Fustāt as well. It is difficult to determine how common it was at Fustāt, since the two articles dedicated to the lamps from this site, and the preliminary reports published on the excavations, do not give quantitative data. Type 37, the lamp of the Abbasid- Fatimid periods, was also found at Fustāt. Two of the glazed lamps of this type found at Bet Shean apparently originated at Fustāt, and the two additional glazed lamps from Bet Shean possibly came from there as well. Of the three additional mold-made types that date from the periods under discussion, Types 44 and 46 were not found at all at Fustāt and Type 45 was represented by only one example. In contrast, at Bet Shean, Types 44 and 45 are the most common lamps of the late twelfth-fourteenth centuries CE. On the other hand, many varieties of wheel-made lamps found at Fustāt are almost unknown at Bet Shean, and from the current published material, it appears that these types are not especially common in the rest of Palestine as well. Numerous wheel-made types are common at Fustāt from the tenth century CE on; four of these have parallels at Bet Shean (Types 41, 42, 47 and 50). Of these four, two (Types 41 and 42) appear to have been made at Fustāt. However, it should be noted that these types were represented at Bet Shean by only a few examples, apparently indicating that wheel-made lamps were not a specialty of Palestinian lamp makers or that mold-made lamps were produced in much greater quantities than wheel-made ones. Connections between Bet Shean and Syria Only one lamp sherd of a distinctly Syrian type was found at Bet Shean, imported Type 9 (Chapter 3); it is the single example of its type found in Palestine, as far as is known. The round lamps that are also defined as Syrian are lacking in the archaeological excavations carried out in Palestine so far.10 Moreover; only single examples of two Palestinian types have been found in Syria; a sherd of Type 4 (the knife-pared lamp) was found at Antioch,11 and one Samaritan lamp of Type 32 was published from 'Anab al- Safinah. This indicates that there were virtually no trade relations between the two regions during the Roman and Byzantine periods and that the lamps in each area were local. However, from the Umayyad period on, there is a similarity in the lamp types between Bet Shean and the few Syrian sites from which lamps have been published. The most common lamp type of the Umayyad period at Bet Shean and Palestine in general (Type 36) is the only type discovered in the Umayyad palace at Jabal Usais, along with two molds for its manufacture. This may indicates that this was the dominant type in Syria too during the Umayyad period. The shape of the lamp from Jabal Usais differs slightly from that of the Palestinian version: the Syrian lamp is rounder; while the Palestinian lamp is piriform. Lamps of this type were also discovered at Hims, Antioch, Hama, 'Anab al-Safinah and Qasr al-Hayr al-Sharqi. The two other types in use during the Umayyad period at Bet Shean and in Transjordan, Type 29 (the Jerash lamp) and Type 35, are not published from any site in Syria. Type 37, the lamp used during the Abbasid-Fatimid periods in Palestine and Transjordan, was also found in Damascus, Antioch and Hama. An additional mold-made type dating from the Mamluk period (Type 45) was found at Hama, though it is slightly different from its counterpart at Bet Shean and throughout Palestine and Transjordan. Further connections can be seen in the wheel-made lamps; Types 40, 42, 43, 47, 48, 50 and 51 were discovered at Hama, Antioch, Tell Sūkās, Aleppo, Lattaqia, 'Ain Dara, Dehes, Qal'at Sem'an and Qasr al-Hayr al-Sharqi. Connections between Bet Shean and Lebanon A similarity is evident between the lamp types found in the Galilee and southern Phoenicia in the late Roman and Byzantine periods. Two of the types characteristic of these regions were found at Bet Shean, but they are very rare: Type 14 (the Beth She'arim lamp), of which two examples were found at Bet Shean, appears at Tyre, Byblos, Deb'aal and Sidon,12 and Type 30 (the al-Bassa lamp), of which five sherds were found at Bet Shean, appears at Sidon.13 From the Umayyad period on, there is an increased similarity between lamp types in the two regions. Type 36 was discovered at Tell 'Arqa and Beirut, while Type 37 was found at Baalbek. The following wheel-made types (Types 43, 47, 49 and 50) appear at all three sites in Lebanon. The Muslim conquest and the inclusion of the entire region under a single rule undoubtedly paved the way for improved trade relations and mutual influences between regions that had hitherto been isolated. This is evident in Palestine, where from the Umayyad period onward the lamps are no longer typical of each particular region but are found throughout the country. 151</page><page sequence="157">Table 1.
