Through a detailed analysis of ceramic technology and composition, coupled with observations of archaeological formation processes, we argue that the late Pueblo III-Pueblo IV period ceramic assemblages in the region document an instance of rapid change in manufacture and circulation patterns. Intensification and diversification of ceramic production are linked with the migration of ethnically diverse people into the Grasshopper region. These changes correlate with the demographic and social reorganization that took place in the Southwest at the end of the thirteenth century.

Estos cambios se correlacionan con la reorganizacidn demogrdfica y social que occurrid en el Suroeste norteamericano alfinal del siglo XIII Current research on prehistoric ceramics from the Grasshopper region, east- central Arizona (Figure 1), reveals an instance of rapid change in patterns of ce- ramic manufacture and circulation. This change resulted from the aggregation of culturally diverse people in this area around A.D. 1300. The ceramic record from late Pueblo III (ca. A.D. 1250-1300) and Pueblo IV (A.D. 1300-1400) period sites in the region demonstrates that during the fourteenth century potters not only in- creased the overall local production of decorated and plain wares, but also adopted</page><page sequence="2">ARIZO CST.JOHNS CP 1 FORT *), SPRINGERVILLE 4 Oa.sGh hoE APACHE RESERVATION SAN CARLOS APACHE RESERVATION o 6 lo 15 1* 0 5 10 MlsN.OM GLOBE 0 MODERN TOM PoitofPinem S6ie a Figure 1.

Furthermore, the record indicates a shift in the mecha- nisms of circulation of non-local ceramics and intensification of exchange. This inference of rapid ceramic change is supported by data from neutron activation and petrographic analyses applied to more than 400 ceramic and clay samples. The ceramic samples were predominantly taken from whole and partial vessels recovered from late Pueblo III and Pueblo IV period contexts. The archaeological record of Grasshopper area sites is noted for its exceptionally fine chronology and control of formation processes, which, taken together with compositional data, allow a detailed reconstruction of these changes. To better explain how change was brought about by aggregation in the Grass- hopper region, we first characterize the context of ceramic manufacturing and circulation during the late Pueblo III period. Then we synthesize evidence for increase in local ceramic production and exchange after A.D. 1300. THIRTEENTH-CENTURY CERAMIC MANUFACTURE AND CIRCULATION During most of the thirteenth century, the mountains of east-central Arizona were sparsely populated by small groups that subsisted on hunting, gathering, and horticulture (Welch 1996). Dispersed farmsteads of three to five low-walled ma- sonry rooms were generally built around a focal community. Focal communities had no more than 20 masonry rooms surrounding an enclosed plaza (Reid et al. 1996; Reid and Whittlesey 1999). Chodistaas (AZ P:14:24 [ASM]), the largest and best known of these communities, had two roomblocks facing the plaza; each roomblock in turn included a ceremonial room. This site was occupied between A.D. 1263 and 1300 (Crown 1981a:31; Montgomery and Reid 1990). Settlement patterns, subsistence, and architecture of this period suggest a highly opportunistic strategy of land and resource use. Small groups may have moved seasonally or may have remained in their communities year-round, depending on their immediate needs. At Chodistaas, year-round occupation probably did not begin until after A.D. 1280, when a block of storage rooms was added to the pueblo (Reid 1989:77). This strategy of mobility appears to have contributed greatly to the circulation of non-local ceramics (Zedeflo 1994:16). Mobility likely fostered inter-community relationships, particularly if there was joint use of territories and resources. Mountain groups were small, unstable, and relatively isolated from large pottery producing centers; it is thus unlikely that they participated in large trade networks. People could have transported pots to and from their settlements on a regular basis, however. Pottery could have been obtained through reciprocal exchange, occasional barter, and down-the-line trading episodes (Zedefio 1998:465). The ceramic repertoire of late Pueblo III period sites included a large number of wares. The most abundant undecorated wares were brown indented, obliterated</page><page sequence="4">218 ZEDERIO AND TRIADAN corrugated (hereafter "brown corrugated"), gray-orange obliterated corrugated ("gray-orange corrugated"), Salado Red Corrugated, and red plain. Common deco- rated wares included Cibola White Ware, Roosevelt Red Ware, and painted corru- gated types, such as McDonald Painted Corrugated and Salado White-on-red. White Mountain Red Ware was represented by small numbers of St. Johns Poly- chrome. Carbon-painted white wares and Hohokam ceramics were extremely rare, occurring only in surface contexts (Crown 1981 a; Montgomery 1992). Composi- tional analysis of undecorated and decorated ceramics from late Pueblo III period sites was carried out by Zedeflo (1994) (Table 1). Her analysis revealed that local ceramic manufacture was largely limited to brown corrugated, Salado Red Corru- gated, and painted corrugated pots (Figure 2). Alluvial red-firing clays were tem- pered with crushed diabase; hematite and white marl were locally available pig- ments used to paint simple geometric designs on a few corrugated bowls and jars. Intentional smudging was also present on corrugated bowls. Overall, local potters conformed to a late-thirteenth-century expression of the Mogollon Brown Ware ceramic tradition found along the Mogollon Rim (Colton and Hargrave 1937; Mauer 1970; Wood and McAllister 1982:91-92). On the other hand, non-local ceramics were numerous and highly varied. These were not limited to painted white wares and red wares, but also included gray- orange corrugated and red plain pots (Zedefilo 1994:68). The technological and compositional characteristics of non-local wares allow us to pinpoint their prob- able places of origin; their frequencies of occurrence on the surface, in the fill, and on room floors provide indications as to the mechanisms through which these wares circulated into the Grasshopper region (Zedeflo 1998:467). The most abundant non-local decorated ware was Cibola White Ware. Cibola was ubiquitous in surface, fill, and room floor contexts of excavated sites, and probably represents a longstanding relationship between Grasshopper region set- tlers and communities above the Mogollon Rim that produced Cibola White Ware (Zedeflo 1992). Conversely, White Mountain Red Ware was represented by a few sherds of St. Johns Polychrome from surface and fill deposits, and one or two whole vessels from floor assemblages. The scarcity of this ware in Pueblo III period sites suggests that mountain settlers did not participate in White Mountain Red Ware exchange networks or that their Colorado Plateau relations were lim- ited to groups that did not manufacture White Mountain Red Ware until the end of that period (Triadan 1997:105). Those few St. Johns Polychrome pots present at the sites in the Grasshopper region could have been obtained through gift ex- change or sporadic down-the-line trading episodes (Zedeflo 1998:469). Non-local gray-orange corrugated ware appeared in surface and fill contexts and was abundant in floor assemblages. This ware is distinct from brown corru- gated in both paste color and manufacturing techniques (Zedeflo 1994:55-67). A distributional study of this ware in several neighboring areas points to the Cibecue Valley as its manufacturing locus (Reid et al. 1996; Reid and Montgomery 1998).</page><page sequence="5">Table 1.

Community Reorganization in East-Central Arizona 217</page><page sequence="10">224 ZEDENO AND TRIADAN Cibecue Valley sites, only about 10 miles east of Grasshopper Pueblo (see Figure 1), included low percentages of brown corrugated wares. Given the contemporaneity of Cibecue and Grasshopper sites and the inversely proportional frequencies of brown and gray-orange corrugated wares, we suggest that these could have been transported easily from one region to another as food containers and as exchange items (Zedeflo 1994, 1995; but see Reid and Montgomery 1998). Similar instances of co-occurrence of brown and gray corrugated wares represent- ing distinct manufacturing locales/traditions were documented by Neily (1988:162) in the Snowflake-Mesa Redonda area, by Rugge and Doyel (1980:203) in the Springerville area, and by Crown (1981b:267, 269) in St. Johns (see Figure 1). Such instances lead us to infer that variability in corrugated wares was generally associated with interaction among neighboring communities living near or at the Mogollon Rim-Colorado Plateau boundary. Red plain vessels were probably manufactured at sites to the south and west of the Grasshopper region, perhaps in the Globe-Miami area (Doyel 1978), and may have been circulated through mechanisms similar to those suggested for gray- orange corrugated wares. Evidence that Red Plain jars were used as seed and acorn roasting ovens at Grasshopper Spring Pueblo (see Figure 1) points to a specialized function for these vessels and further strengthens the inference that they may have been coveted items obtained through barter or exchange. In short, non-local undecorated pots are markers of relationships between the settlers on the Grasshopper Plateau and their close neighbors, whereas non-local decorated pots represent their long-distance relationships. FROM BLACK-ON-WHITE TO POLYCHROME The prelude to aggregation and associated changes in ceramic manufacture is marked in the ceramic record by the appearance of Roosevelt Red Ware or "Salado Polychromes," and coincided with the abandonment of many regions on the Colo- rado Plateau and subsequent migration into east-central Arizona (Crown 1994; Haury 1958; Montgomery and Reid 1990; see papers in Cameron 1995). Techno- logically, Pinto Black-on-red and Pinto Polychrome, the earliest Roosevelt Red Ware types, resemble Colorado Plateau ceramics; they were tempered with ground sherds and sand rather than with locally available materials, were painted with organic paint, and have Pinedale-style designs (Crown 1981a, 1994; Zedefio 1994:95). Both local and non-local Pinto polychromes have been identified in late Pueblo III period sites in the Roosevelt, Vosberg, Globe, Silver Creek, and Point of Pines regions (Crown 1994; Doyel and Haury 1976; Simon et al. 1998; Stinson 1996; White and Burton 1992; Zedeflo n.d.). Local and non-local Pinto Black-on-red and Pinto Polychrome bowls also have been recovered from Chodistaas. The bowls made with local clays were tempered with crushed diabase, sherds, sand or a combination thereof, but were</page><page sequence="11">Community Reorganization in East-Central Arizona 225 not technologically distinct from the imported bowls (Zedeflo 1994:97). Although very scarce in surface and fill deposits, Pinto Black-on-red and Pinto Polychrome were the second most abundant decorated pots on room floors. Montgomery and Reid (1990:93) date the appearance of these types to the A.D. 1280s at Chodistaas; they also point out that these bowls replaced their Cibola White Ware counter- parts. The appearance of non-local Roosevelt Red Ware at Chodistaas has been interpreted as the result of migrating people who may have brought a few pots with them; subsequently, these people began to produce Roosevelt Red Ware with clays available near the pueblo while continuing to use northern temper and paint technology (Reid et al. 1992; Zedeflo 1994, 1995). The rapid rate at which Roosevelt Red Ware spread throughout the Arizona highlands and desert basins indicates immigration followed by local production of technologically foreign pots, as well as emulation by local potters (Stinson 1996). These behaviors also have been documented at Point of Pines Pueblo, where the appearance of Pinto polychromes has been chronologically and contextually associated with the immigration of Kayenta Anasazi people at the end of the thir- teenth century (Crown 1994; Haury 1958; Lindsay 1987; Zedeflo n.d.). AGGREGATION AND CERAMIC CHANGE A dramatic increase in ceramic variability and local production took place at Grasshopper Pueblo during the early Pueblo IV period. This increase was not limited to painted wares but also included corrugated and plain wares, indicating that drastic changes affected not just one pottery ware - as would happen if only trade networks changed - but the entire household assemblage (Zedeflo n.d.). This increase may be attributed to the higher number of potters living in the pueblo and to the different technological and stylistic traditions they represented. Changes in circulation networks also may have been responsible for the appearance of non- local wares that had been absent from the region prior to A.D. 1300. For instance, White Mountain Red Ware became the predominant decorated ware at Grasshop- per Pueblo and at contemporary sites south of the Mogollon Rim (Triadan 1997: Fig.4.2., Fig. 5.4.). In the Grasshopper region, community reorganization began with the aban- donment of small communities and aggregation at Grasshopper Pueblo (Graves et al. 1982; Reid 1973; Reid and Whittlesey 1999; Riggs 1994). Growth estimates suggest a tenfold regional population increase after A.D. 1300; at least 12 large aggregated settlements were built in the region during the fourteenth century. The rate of population growth can only be explained as a result of the rapid influx of people into the region (Longacre 1975, 1976; Graves 1991). Although an un- known number of immigrants apparently came from abandoned neighboring com- munities, variability in human remains (Ezzo 1991), ceramics (Triadan 1997, 1998),</page><page sequence="12">226 ZEDERO AND TRIADAN architecture (Riggs 1994), and other artifact and feature categories (Whittlesey 1978) point to immigration from beyond the Mogollon highlands. Under these conditions, an increase in the volume of pots produced in the region during the Pueblo IV period (Triadan 1997:78-91) can be easily explained by population increase and concomitant development of a relatively sustainable horticultural economy that allowed people to become more sedentary. This pro- cess was not unique to the Grasshopper region. On the contrary, many other South- western regions were also experiencing a time of economic and social growth (e.g., Adams 1991a; Haury 1989; Kintigh 1985, 1996; Mills 1998), but the changes observed in ceramic production and distribution during this period clearly ex- ceeded a mere rise in the number of pots being produced. We suggest that in an increasingly agriculture-oriented society suddenly en- riched by the presence of skilled craftspeople, pottery production constituted an alternative means of livelihood for those who could not gain access to prime agri- cultural lands (Elson et al. 1996; Reid and Whittlesey 1999; Welch 1996; see also Arnold 1985:171-196). In addition to production for local consumption in grow- ing communities, the establishment of exchange networks that integrated two or more regions could have provided craftspeople with an ideal outlet for their prod- ucts. A trend toward specialization in the manufacture of pottery during this time period is suggested in the archaeological record by several events: first, the ap- pearance of specialized manufacturing rooms (Triadan 1989); second, the local production of commonly exchanged ceramics, such as White Mountain Red Ware and Roosevelt Red Ware (Mayro et al. 1976; Triadan 1997); third, the manufac- ture of nestable pots (for example, Gila Polychrome and Fourmile Polychrome bowls) for easier transport (Whittlesey 1974; but see Triadan 1997:92-94); and fourth, an increase in stylistic and technological variability in local pots, perhaps generated by a larger number of part-time producers (see Mills 1995). FOURTEENTH-CENTURY CERAMIC MANUFACTURE AND CIRCULATION The ceramic record provides remarkable evidence for the presence of immi- grants at Grasshopper Pueblo. The overwhelming variability in decorated and plain wares recovered from this site cannot be explained solely as a product of trade or exchange but also as a very likely result of the work of immigrant potters, who were combining local raw materials with foreign techniques. Moreover, ex- pansion in the technological and stylistic variation of ceramics from this site sug- gests that immigrant potters provided innovative teaching frameworks for their Mogollon counterparts and vice versa; diverse groups readily adopted new tech- niques and designs to expand their traditional routines and often created "hybrid" wares by combining elements of others' ceramic repertoire with their own (Zedeflo n.d.).</page><page sequence="13">Community Reorganization in East-Central Arizona 227 Triadan (1997) conducted a compositional analysis of White Mountain Red Ware from Grasshopper Pueblo and 33 other sites in the region (see Table 1). The results of this and subsequent analyses indicate that there were at least three non- local sources for the White Mountain Red Ware vessels recovered at this pueblo (Triadan et al. n.d). These sources are clearly different from those of non-local Cibola White Ware, found at Chodistaas and other contemporary late Pueblo III period sites. This is of interest because in the Silver Creek drainage, near Pinedale, Cibola White Ware and White Mountain Red Ware were sometimes manufac- tured with the same raw materials at the same village (Triadan et al. n.d.), whereas in the Grasshopper region these two wares appear to have been imported from unrelated manufacturing locales, possibly during subsequent time periods. Thus, this shift in supply networks exemplifies the establishment of new rela- tionships between Grasshopper communities and those from surrounding regions during the aggregation period, as well as the breakdown of all but a few previ- ously existing relationships. Whether fourteenth-century polychrome vessels were brought in by immigrants, obtained through trade, or both, is yet to be fully deter- mined. An interregional sourcing study by Triadan et al. (n.d.), however, suggests migration as the predominant mechanism of White Mountain Red Ware circula- tion into the Grasshopper Region. In addition, Triadan's study confirmed that Grasshopper potters were also producing White Mountain Red Ware (see Figure 3; Triadan 1997:100). Some of these local polychromes are formally indistin- guishable from the imported polychromes, indicating that perhaps they were manu- factured by immigrant potters. Yet another set of locally produced polychromes- classified as "Grasshopper Red Ware"-are crude imitations of White Mountain Red Ware vessels that were manufactured with local raw materials and techniques and occasionally incorporated elements of other polychrome wares as well (Mayro et al. 1976; Triadan 1997). Although compositional analysis of Pueblo IV Roosevelt Red Ware from Grasshopper Pueblo has not been conducted, microscopic observation of paste and temper, among other attributes, suggests a wide range of variability in both sources and techniques. This range of variation is duplicated in contemporaneous Point of Pines assemblages for which chemical and petrographic data are avail- able (Zedefto n.d.). The technological and compositional variability of Roosevelt Red Ware at Grasshopper and Point of Pines Pueblos and its interregional distri- bution support the inference of a broad expansion in local production and ex- change of this ware throughout the fourteenth century (Crown 1994; Mayro et al. 1976; Zedeflo n.d.). Another change visible in ceramic assemblages from Grasshopper and the neighboring Silver Creek and Kinishba regions was the introduction of buff-col- ored Kinishba Polychromes that resemble fourteenth-century yellow wares made in the Western Pueblos (Triadan 1997:13-14). Incidentally, these ceramics were made with the same raw materials as the imported White Mountain Red Ware</page><page sequence="14">80 70 Unassigned 70 1 Nonlocal 60 0 Local s. 50 E 40 6 30 z 20 10 0 White Mt.

Regarding local technologies, the manufacture of late Mogollon decorated ceramics, such as Cibicue Polychrome and Salado White-on-red, at Grasshopper Pueblo indicates further development of the an- cient Mogollon Brown Ware tradition alongside foreign technologies. In addition to the proliferation of polychromes, the manufacture of white wares with local raw materials but using foreign techniques represents yet another in- stance of change in ceramic production during the fourteenth century (Zedefio 1992, 1994, n.d.; Van Keuren 1999). In contrast to the flourishing polychromes, however, white wares never again attained the prominent place they once had in Southwestern ceramic manufacture. It appears that the abandonment of many re- gions where white wares were originally made and the difficulties in adapting the highly developed white ware technology to less than ideal raw materials ended this long-lived tradition. We would add that, because of an increase in the demand for polychrome ceramics both for local consumption and exchange, potters needed to develop technologies that could be reproduced with a wider range of raw mate- rials and techniques than those necessary for white ware production. Beyond technology, there are social and ritual explanations for the success of polychrome ceramic production in the late prehistory of Pueblo communities in Arizona and west-central New Mexico. For example, Crown (1994) postulates that Roosevelt Red Ware, or "Salado Polychromes," was a material marker of a Southwestern religious cult that developed around A.D. 1300. Adams (1991b), on the other hand, sees some designs, particularly anthropomorphic designs in Fourmile Polychrome and Jeddito Yellow Ware, as representations ofkatsina masks and thus as evidence for the emergence of the Katsina Cult. Both models suggest that supra-community ritual practices developed out of the need to integrate het- erogeneous sectors of the fourteenth-century multi-ethnic societies in many areas of the Southwest. Others have proposed that polychrome wares were prestige items of political elites (Upham 1982). Whether sacred or mundane, elite or common, these ceramic wares constitute the material representations of changing intercom- munity relations during late prehistoric times in the Southwest. CONCLUSION To reconstruct prehistoric behavior and change from ceramic artifacts, re- searchers must use a host of analytical techniques to identify materials and their sources. They must also give detailed consideration to the relationships between these data and the formation of the archaeological record, so that material corre- lates for ceramic manufacture and circulation may be postulated. In the Grasshop- per region, it was possible to identify several behavioral mechanisms for ceramic circulation that acted simultaneously to produce highly varied ceramic assem- blages, and to monitor the significant changes that these mechanisms underwent in the late prehistory of this region.</page><page sequence="16">230 ZEDERO AND TRIADAN Acknowledgments.
