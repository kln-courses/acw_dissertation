Fetsbilder in Nord- Australien: with an English summary (Ergebnisse der Frobenius-Expedition nach Nord-Australien 1954/5). x, 115 pp. illus., maps, plates, bibliogr. Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner, 1971. DM 58 This study of aboriginal 'art galleries' in north Australia was made from 1954 to 1956 on behalf of the Frobenius Institute, Frank- furt-am-Main with financial aid from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. The author is not new to the subject, having been a member of the expedition to the Western Kimberleys, organised by the same Institute in 1938/39. Between 1954-1956 Madame Schulz spent many months alone among the Aborigines, photographing and copying rock paintings in various sites of Arnhem Land, and obtaining information about their symbolism from native artists. Mysterious anthropomorphic figures in certain paintings were described by her informants as pictures of spirit beings, who had revealed themselves during 'dream-time', or even as portraits of ghosts painted by ghosts. The 'Spectre of the light of falling stars' (namorodo), a spirit in human form with inclined head (in the posture of falling), Fig. 37, testifies to the exuberant poetical imagination of these gifted 'primitive' peoples. However, the underlying beliefs, which inspired such re- ligious representations, must go back to such remote times that contemporary Aborigines are unable to explain them (as the average Christian knows little about the iconography of his innumerable saints). Figures of human- like monsters (pl. 13) and human beings, along with representations of indigenous animals, abound in north Australian rock paintings. Some nematomorphic human figures, termed Strichmanner by the author, are to some extent reminiscent of palaeolithic wall designs, and like them do not seem to</page><page sequence="2">356 BOOK REVIEWS represent spirit beings, but real people in daily life. Though it has as yet proved impossible to suggest even approximate dates for Aus- tralian aboriginal rock paintings, the author came to the conclusion that the so-called X- ray drawings of northern Australia belong to the latest manifestations of indigenous art. 'The first X-ray animals', she says, 'must be at least two hundred years old'. As we know, this odd technique is also encountered in the Melanesian Islands. Confined to a coastal area of north Australia, it seems to have reached that continent from the north-east. In photographing, copying and describing so many rock paintings in Arnhem Land sites, the author has substantially contributed to our knowledge of Australian Aboriginal art. Paper and printing are of high quality. Most of the photographs are well reproduced. It is to be regretted that the handsome volume contains only two colour plates.
