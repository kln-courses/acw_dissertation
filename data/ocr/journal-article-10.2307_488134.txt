<plain_text><page sequence="1">Phenomenology of Film: On Siegfried Kracauer's Writings of the 1920s by Heide Schlhipmann Anyone who thinks that Theory of Film contains everything that Siegfried Kracauer had to say about film is quite mistaken. In fact, the opposite is true: the specificity of this film theoretician can only be gleaned through a reading of his writings from the 1920s. Besides nu- merous reviews, this body of work consists primarily of essays which first appeared in the Frankfurter Zeitung and were subsequently repub- lished in a collection assembled by the author in 1963 entitled Das Orna- ment der Masse [The Mass Ornament].' Among the wide range of material included in this volume are essays such as "Kult der Zerstreuung" ["Cult of Distraction"], "Die Photographie," and "Die kleinen Laden- madchen gehen ins Kino" ["The Little Shop Girls Go to the Movies"],2 which contain fundamental reflections on film rivalling in importance those of the more voluminous From Caligari to Hitler and the Theory ofFilm. Indeed, in his essay on the physiognomy of Kracauer's thought, "Der wunderliche Realist" ["The Curious Realist"],3 Theodor W. Adorno goes so far as to say that all of Kracauer's work produced after 1933 bears the undeniable scars of emigration, since for such "thinking with pencil in hand" working in a foreign language was the most decisive hindrance [Eingrjif]: 1.- Sigfried Kracauer, Das Ornament der Masse: Essays (Frankfurt a.

In From Caligari to Hitler and Theory ofFilm, Kracauer's tendency to gen- eralize, to subsume particulars within conceptual constructs, presents an obstacle to the expression of his ideas. The strength of the essays of the 1920s lies in their phenomenological procedure, their taking up of individual manifestations of daily life and dwelling upon them reflec- tively. The influence of phenomenology was decisive for Kracauer. The historical and social experiences of his generation, however, led him to turn this method in a critical, materialist direction which distinguishes it from that of his teacher Max Scheler. In the essay "Die Wartenden" ["Those Who Wait"],4 written in 1922, Kracauer describes the experi- ence of cultural disintegration as marked by the absence of meaning and coherence, of absolute values and of objective truths. What is striking here is not only the portrayal of the attempts by intellectuals to reconstitute meaning, but also the depiction of the reactions of "those who wait," because in the latter one can already recognize the author of Theory of Film. Here, Kracauer takes up his later stance only tentatively: In any case it should be said that, amongst other things, as re- gards the people being considered here, we are engaged in the attempt to shift the focus from the theoretical I to the I of the entire human being and to move away from the atomized unreal world of formless forces and magnitudes devoid of meaning, in order to get back to the world and realms of reali- ty. Due to the exaltation of theoretical thinking we have moved away from reality to a horrifying degree, a reality which is filled with incarnate things and people and therefore demands to be seen concretely. ["Those Who Wait," 118] Although in the 1920s Kracauer avoids making the "essence" of film his central concern, in his excursions into the reality of the medium he still touches upon the question of an aesthetics specific to film. But his focus is on the external layers and the marginal phenomena; the moving 4.

It is significant for Adorno's view of Kracauer in "The Curious Real- ist" that out of the wide range of Kracauer's writing on film he concen- trates above all on the 1928 essay "The Little Shopgirls Go to the Mov- ies." For it is in this text that Kracauer engages in a critique of the ideolo- gy of film which resembles that articulated years later by Adorno and Horkheimer in the "Culture Industry" sections of the Dialectic of Enlightenment: under the rule of capital, film production necessarily be- comes a mirror of the existing society and serves to maintain its struc- tures of domination. It reveals repressed wishes and daydreams but only in an alienated form which at the same time reproduces their deni- al. Indeed, Kracauer's journalistic work anticipates the later Dialectic of Enlightenment not only in this essay on the cinema but also, for example, in the concept of "disenchantment" as it is developed in the essay on "The Mass Ornament."5 Yet, besides Kracauer's critical approach to film Adorno also notes another attitude to the medium which strikes him as somewhat peculiar: He himself to some extent shares the naive visual pleasure of the movie-goer; even the little shopgirls who amuse him manifest something of his own reaction to film. This is cer- tainly one reason why his relationship to the mass media nev- er became as harsh as his reflection on their effect would have led one to expect.6 Kracauer's reflections on the effect of film are more complicated than Adorno's remarks imply. Still, the latter suggest that Kracauer should have given more consideration in his work to the question of his own fascination rather than displacing it onto the cliche of female stupidity, as he does in "The Little Shopgirls Go to the Movies." Upon leaving a movie theater in 1912, the writer Peter Altenberg for one did not hide behind the woman accompanying him: My tender 15-year-old girlfriend and myself, 52 years old, 5.

Woe to you whose 'dry spirit' we 'of dry heart' are supposedly meant to enthusi- astically enjoy. We do not have to and do not want to! A 'famous writer' said to me: "Between you and me, what do you really find so special about the moving picture shows?!?" "No," I said, "you are not with me but beneath me!"7 Kracauer's unwillingness to share Altenberg's open attitude toward the cinema is due not to personal repression, but rather to the general trans- formation of the cinema which no longer allows such unmediated en- thusiasm. For Kracauer, devotion to the cinema can only be maintained if mediated by critique. Thus his attempt to work out an aesthetic theory of film grows out of a vigilant concern with social conditions. The voca- tion of the moving-picture houses, Kracauer writes in his 1926 essay "Cult of Distraction," "is an aesthetic vocation only to the extent that it is in tune with its social vocation." ("Cult," 96) This text marks a shift in German writing on the cinema from the lyri- cal impressionist style characteristic of work produced during the 1910's towards the concerns of Benjamin's essay on "The Artwork in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility." It is in "Cult of Distraction," and not in "The Little Shopgirls Go to the Movies," that Kracauer takes the audi- ence seriously as a productive force and develops elements of an aes- thetic of reception through observations on the moving-picture palaces of Berlin. The masses which throng to the Berlin movie theaters - the "homogenous cosmopolitan audience" to which, after all, Kracauer himself belongs - are no longer satisfied with the traditional cultural heritage; instead, they themselves "also develop productive powers in the spiritual and cultural domain." ("Cult," 93) So-called high art, on the other hand, has lost its claim to legitimacy, since it does nothing but distract from the actual problems of the society: In a profound sense, Berlin audiences act truthfully when in- creasingly they shun these art events (which, for good reason, 7.

Here, in pure externality, the audience encounters itself; its own reality is revealed in the fragmented sequence of splendid sense impressions. Were this reality to remain hid- den from the audience, they could neither attack nor change it; its disclosure in distraction is theretore of moral significance. However, this is the case only if distraction is not an end in itself. Indeed the very fact that the shows which aim at distrac- tion are composed of the same mixture of externalities as the world of the urban masses; the fact that these shows lack any authentic and materially motivated coherence, except possi- bly the glue of sentimentality which covers up this lack but only in order to make it all the more visible; the fact that these shows convey in a precise and undisguised manner to thou- sands of eyes and ears the disorder of society - this is precisely what enables such shows to evoke and maintain that tension which must precede the inevitable and radical change. ["Cult," 94f.] Numerous documents dating from before the Weimar period ex- press a solidarity with the lower art in opposition to its educated detrac- tors. Of central importance in these debates was the issue of the needs, drives, and instincts which were satisfied by the cinema. These im- pulses were considered not merely as natural but also as socially prod- uced: the desire for distraction, for example, was explained as the prod- uct of the "continual state of occupation" and the "nervous unrest" of modem times." Kracauer shifts the discussion of the controversial form of amusement away from the terms of the contemporary debates which consisted primarily of professions of loyalty to, and literary impressions of, the new medium. He does so, however, without either subjecting it to the objectivity of empirical science or taking refuge in systematic phil- osophical reflection. Kracauer transforms the cinema from a familiar site of experiences and locus of reflection back into a strange phenome- non whose meaning remains to be established. This distanciation is grounded in the alienating effect of capital. Penetrating it with his critical gaze, Kracauer discerns, in the newly constructed cinema palaces in Berlin, the contours of a new form of spirit [Geist]. 8.

Rather, it is a question of whether the cinema will be established as a tool of social domination or whether an aesthetic opposition from below will be able to assert it- self. Such an opposition is embodied in the addiction to distraction which is oblivious to traditional artistic and cultural values. It is in dis- traction that Kracauer systematically traces the constructive forces which contradict the norms of bourgeois aesthetics. Every attempt to resurrect traditional artistic practices in the cinema must be considered reactionary. The moral task of the medium is no longer the symboliza- tion of the ethical, but rather the mirroring of the enslaved, damaged quality of life. Illusion has aesthetic significance not as the veil of truth but in the uncovering of a reality which lacks any true coherence. Dis- traction goes beyond the mere cultivation of superficial glamor; it pres- ents what is incoherent anrid chaotic as such to the eyes and ears of the au- dience. Instead of conveying humane ideas, distraction sharpens the senses for an antagonistic reality. Similarly, Benjamin later read the sen- sation of shock [Chockerlebnis] produced by film as a rehearsal of new forms of apperception. Kracauer demonstrates an even greater sensitivity to the emotional side of the cinematic experience. Although he condemns the restoration of 'artistic unity' in the cinema as reactionary, he condones the glue of sentimentality as the subjective residue of the need for such unity. Thus, according to Kracauer, distracted reception not only entails changes in the cognitive apparatus but also engenders emotional tensions which can turn into actions. Nevertheless, Kracauer does not assume that the mere publication of "Cult of Distraction" in the Frankfurter Zeitung will suffice to agitate the masses. The focus of the essay is more on the organ- ization of the cinema - from its architecture to its programming - be- cause these aspects mightwell be influenced through the medium of the liberal public sphere. In its treatment of the cinema, the essay "Cult of Distraction" also outlines an aesthetic of film, but this only becomes clear in the "Photog- raphy" essay written one year later. While the latter text consists prima- rily of observations and reflections on two very different photographs - a private one of a grandmother and a public photo of a diva - it also si- multaneously develops a sub-discourse on film. This is not surprising to those familiar with Theory ofFilm where the photographic element of film is accorded such a central role that most of the aesthetic determinations</page><page sequence="7">Heide Schliipmann 103 of film are simply inherited from photography. Still, what is astonishing in this early essay is the manner in which this relationship is presented: what the two media share is not the representational quality of photog- raphy but rather its inherent negativity. Photography is introduced as a positivistic medium - but against a background of metaphysical questions posed by history. It is no coinci- dence that Kracauer's last work History: The Last Things before the Last9 be- gins with a reference to the early essay on photography. For it is here that Kracauer develops the specificity of the photographic medium through a comparison with historicism on the one hand and to the memory-im- age on the other. In contrast to historicism, photography reproduces the spatial (not the temporal) continuum and, in contrast to the memo- ry- image, this spatial continuum is devoid of meaning. The essence of a person or the truth of a moment is unavailable to photography. It de- stroys, rather than bestowing afterlife as do both individual memory and cultural traditions. Old photographs, Kracauer writes, depict not the knowledge of the original but the spatial con- figuration of an instant; it is not the person who stands forth in his or her photograph, but the sum of that which can be ab- stracted from him or her. The photograph annihilates the person by portraying him or her, and were the two to con- verge, the person would cease to exist. ["Photography," 32] Reproducing neither the inner connections nor the outward temporal flow of history photography portrays only that which history is constant- ly evading and continuously passes over: the remnants of nature in it. The objectivity of photography is not nature in a positive sense, i.e. the immediacy of physis, but rather nature as the negativity of history. When photography records history it simultaneously annihilates every historical context. The photographic medium provides Kracauer with a means of re- sponding to the positivistic spirit of the time in a way which is not culturally conservative: by sticking to the surface he exposes the present in its lack of meaning and historical stasis; by reading a fragmented na- ture in the cultural detritus, he challenges the ideology of historical om- nipotence. This does not, however, in principle absolve photography 9.

But Kracauer is not interested in making judgments of principle but in developing a capacity ofjudgment which can grasp the ambivalent meaning of social phenomena. This is already evident in the treatment of cinema in "Cult of Distraction," and, even more so, in the "Photography" essay, which combines the essential traits of both a cri- tique of ideology characteristic of the Dialectic of Enlightenment and the avant-garde attitude of Benjamin's Artwork Essay. A society which strenuously attempts to appear ahistorical uses the photographic me- dium to obstruct the perception of the historicity of reality, instead of fostering a perception of historicity precisely where it is usually not men- tioned at all - in nature. Kracauer already develops a critique of the cul- ture industry in the context of historical-philosophical considerations: history, understood as a process of increasing distanciation of con- sciousness from nature, has reached a point where either a reckless con- sciousness blindly reverts to nature or returns to nature as emancipated reason. Behind society's attempt to give itself the appearance of nature lie fear and repression of death. Photography, by comparison, because it reveals the previously unseen residuum of nature, creates the precondition for an alternative relationship of consciousness to nature. The turn to photography is the "go-for-broke game [Vabanque-Spiel] of history" ("Photography," 37): The images of the state of nature broken down into its ele- ments are surrendered to consciousness to do with as it pleases. Their primordial order is lost, they no longer adhere to the spatial context which linked them with an original out of which the memory-image was selected. However, if the remnants of nature are not oriented toward the memory-im- age then the order which they are given in the image is neces- sarily provisional. It is therefore incumbent on consciousness to identify the provisional status of all given configurations and, perhaps, even to awaken an inkling of the right order of the state of nature. In the works of Franz Kafka, a liberated consciousness absolves itself of this responsibility by destroy- ing natural reality and jumbling the fragments against each other. The disorder of the detritus reflected in photography cannot be elucidated more clearly than through such suspen- sion of every habitual relationship among the elements of na- ture. The capacity to rearrange nature in this way is one of the possibilities of film. This possibility is realized whenever film relates parts and sections and thereby produces a strange con- struction. While the disarray of the illustrated newspapers is</page><page sequence="9">Heide Schliipmann 105 simply confusion the game film plays with the pieces of dis- jointed nature is reminiscent of dreams in which the frag- ments of daily life become jumbled. This game indicates that a valid organization of things is not known, an organization which would designate the proper positions for the remains of the grandmother and the diva stored in the general inven- tory. ["Photography," 39] Kracauer elevates the masses' addiction to distraction to the status of an aesthetic force of production. His definition of the specificity of film as a montage of distraction - which combines the reality fragments of photographic images in a dream-like, surrealist manner - recalls tendencies of the avant-garde. What separated him from the contempo- rary avant-garde in the orbit of the Bauhaus was its aesthetic of materials [Materialdsthetik] which was foreign to him. Even though concerned with the innermost organization of film, Kracauer approaches it entirely from the outside, from the margin, by means of historical and social manifestations such as the Berlin moving-picture palaces or the photo- graphs of the grandmother and the diva. Photography annihilates history - but as such it is an ambivalent product of an eschatological time [Endzeit]. Considered from both a so- ciological and historical-philosophical perspective this means that photography makes time stand still even as it is itself a 'function oftheflow oftime" ("Photography," 29). As long as the object is still present outside the photograph, the latter will be read as a sign of a reality. Only when even the memory of this reality has disappeared does the mimetic aspect of photography come to the fore; it becomes an archive of the residues of nature which are devoid of meaning, unintelligible, and indeed, have never been perceived. As a function of the flow of time, photography is predisposed to be the vehicle of meaning for film. And as a medium of communication film strengthens the semiotic character of photogra- phy.It adds time to the representation of space, and thus depends, for the intelligibility of its story, upon the memory of the spectator. As an aesthetic construct, on the other hand, film hastens the destruction of all the familiar connections of reality in the spectator's head in order to bring to light, through the photographic medium, the traits of a soul- less, fragmentary nature, the way it would appear at the end of the world. If the world of the illustrated magazine represses death, the aes- thetic of film brings it back to consciousness. The latter no longer counts upon an understanding of history but rather provokes redemp- tive reason, a sensitivity to nature. This concept of time specific to the</page><page sequence="10">106 Kracauer's Writings of the 1920's aesthetic of film does not stem from the philosophy of life [Lebens- philosophie]; rather, in its connection of utopian and nihilistic elements, it is closer to the dialectic of Jewish Messianism. The Theory of Film not only gave rise to the misunderstanding that Kracauer subscribed to a naive concept of realism.'0 Its systematic ap- proach, which makes deductions based on the "fundamental character- istics of the medium," also obscures an aspect of Kracauer's thoughts on film which is genuinely oriented towards a theory of reception. The later work, History, brings this aspect back to light again. Indeed, it is only in this latter work that Kracauer's life-long occupation with film is finally consolidated and brought to a close. For here Kracauer devotes himself exclusively to that which had moved him as a critic from the start. As Inka Muilder notes in her book-length study of Kracauer's early work, "his interest in film is at root an interest in the philosophy of history."" Kracauer's essays on film written in the 1920s approach the effect of the medium through an ideological and cultural critique. The "Photog- raphy" essay goes further, adding the eschatological [endzeitliche] recep- tion of photography as the imaginary perspective which determines the aesthetic construction of film. In History this dialectical idea of the prod- uctivity of reception is both echoed and simultaneously given its actual raison d'etre. Kracauer's notions of history are guided not by Nietzsche's pragmatic interest in history in the service of the present, of engaged 'life', but rather, much more decisively, by Burckhardt's conception of history and Proust's "nostalgia for lost causes" (History, 79). The writing of history is produced through a devotion to the past and even the ideas which direct the interpretation of history arise out of a "surrender[ing] to the facts." (History, 96) Kracauer himself considered his book on history as the further devel- opment and rearticulation of thoughts from Theory of Film. The writing on film and about films having been brought to a close, his focus shifts to the presentation and interrogation of the insights into history gained through the study of the medium: "I realized in a flash the many exist- 10. For example, Dudley Andrew remarks that "Bazin and Kracauer represent the realist camp [...].[..] Bazin's notions of standard perception derive from Bergson and Sartre and are substantially more complicated than Kracauer's naive realism [...]."

History, however, not only uses ideas from Theory of Film but also casts a light on the foundations of aes- thetics through the comparison between the two domains of film and history. Like the practice of film, the work of the historian is also gov- erned by two tendencies: "the realistic tendency which prompts him to get hold of all data of interest and the formative tendency which requires him to explain the material in hand" (History, 47). In Theory of Film, Kracauer bases his argument for the priority of the realistic on the "fun- damental aesthetic principle" of the medium. With a similar aim, History refers to a different aspect which in fact had surfaced in the epilogue to Theory ofFilm. There, in the context of a discussion of film as an "art with a difference," the film artist is compared with an "imaginative reader" who is well versed in reading from "the book of nature" (Theory of Film, 300 &amp; 302). In the context of the later historical-philosophical medita- tion, there is the corresponding reflection on the claim that it is the task of the photographer to submit formal imperatives to the documentary impulse: "This implies that he resembles not so much the expressive ar- tist as the imaginative reader bent on studying and deciphering an elu- sive text" (History, 55). All that remains of the "art with a difference" in late Kracauer is the subjectivity which constitutes it. Production appears in the form of receptivity. As the following obser- vation by Kracauer regarding a specific type of documentary indicates, this appearance could be understood as a socially imposed disguise: "A few documentaries I know picture appalling living conditions with a matter-of-fact soberness which, as I have learned, results from the delib- erate suspension of their authors' creative powers" (History, 90). The power and deeper meaning of the artist's representation resides in the relinquishing of the artistic will to expression in view of real suffering: Human suffering, it appears, is conducive to detached report- ing; the artist's consciente shows in artless photography. Since history is full of human suffering, similar attitudes and reflections may be at the bottom of many a fact-oriented his- torical account, deepening the significance of its pale objec- tivity. [History, 91] The withdrawal of creative will as a self-imposed form of artistic or in- tellectual existence is also reminiscent of the above mentioned behavior of "Those Who Wait" which Kracauer described in 1922 based on his</page><page sequence="12">108 Kracauer's Writings of the 1920's post-war experience. The nostalgia for a plenitude of meaning cannot allow itself to ignore the objective lack of meaning nor may it resign itself to an a priori skepticism. The stance which the present time calls for is a waiting, a "hesitant openness," the anticipation of the Messianic. When writing, Kracauer did not yield to the fascination of the cinema, since this would have meant "thoughtlessly [entrusting] oneself to a flow of desire which [...] could lead to who knows what illusory fulfillment" ("Those Who Wait," 118). What Kracauer finds really significant and worthy of interrogation is not the immediate experience of film, but rather the visit to the movie theaters considered as a highly mediated ac- tivity, as a form of waiting. As a writer Kracauer was not concerned with the status of distraction as an amusement and could thus avoid having to either enthusiastically celebrate this pleasure or to critically condemn it. Rather, faced with the crisis of meaning and the social suffering which was intensifying to the point of destruction, he considered the active passivity of the cinema spectator to be the appropriate exertion of the aesthetic capacity. Given the particular historical moment, every unblemished artistic or intellectual production could only be false. This insight finds expression both in Kracauer's existence as a critic and in the oscillation of his writing between various genres which Milder calls his "Crossing the Borders between Theory and Literature."12 If, on the one hand, Kracauer's move towards the cinema is motiv- ated most emphatically by the recognition of the social crisis, on the oth- er hand he no longer sees in film the promise that it will "turn the world upside down."13 It is not the spirit of utopia which sustains his film aes- thetic. On the contrary, Kracauer's focus is less on the actual films shown in the theaters, than on the significance of going to the movies, that is, of film reception. This focus is not merely a function of Kracauer's conception of himself as a critic whose task is enlighten- ment, i.e., "to expose ideologies and thereby, where necessary, check the influence of the films themselves";'4 the more profound reason for Kracauer's concern is that for him reception in a profound sense has be- 12.

Even the work of the filmmaker is in the end conceived in terms of reception, i.e. the successful film presupposes the renunciation of the free reign of the creative will and thus of tradi- tional forms of artistic production. This position is reminiscent of avant- garde conceptions such as those of the Dadaists who, before and during the first world war, engaged in a radical critique of the artwork and the hierarchy between artist and audience. However, it avoids the dilemma of an anti-art gesture which has once again ossified into art. Rather than attempting to gain new access to the daily life of society by privileging the demolition instead of the production of the artwork, the writer him- self becomes part of the audience and champions the aesthetic produc- tivity of this seemingly passive comportment. More than mere enlightenment is at stake here; this is an attempt to rescue the receptivity which is the lifeblood of any art. Instead of focus- ing on the genius of the artist which provides the measure for the art- work according to classical aesthetics, Kracauer defends the masses' ad- diction to distraction produced by modem working conditions. The lat- ter are characterized by an essentially formal tension which fills their day fully without making it fulfilling. Such a lack demands to be compensated, but this need can only be articulated in terms of the same sur- face sphere which imposed the lack in the first place. The form of entertainment necessarily corresponds to that of en- terprise. ["Cult," 93] The addiction to distraction demands films which no longer contain any artistically conceived significance. The perceptual structure of the audi- ence, which legitimately determines what appeals, must nevertheless be distinguished from taste. Both the classical concept of the artwork and the concept of taste in traditional reception aesthetics have become reac- tionary: if anyone, it is the film industry that speaks of the taste of the au- dience. Even Kant did not want to leave the determination of the aesthetic up to the taste of empirical subjects but thought instead that it was located in a transcendental capacity - that ofjudgment. Similarly, Kracauer's reflections on reception in film do not ultimately depend on the needs and experiences of empirical subjects - neither his own nor those of others. Instead his work begins with the assumption of a 'transcenden- tal' subjectivity even though this transcendental structure is recognized</page><page sequence="14">110 Kracauer's Writings of the 1920's as an historical figure of consciousness. Kracauer's critical gaze, thor- oughly schooled in historical materialism, saw through the idealist pa- thos of transcendental philosophy early on,'5 leading him to recast it as a stage in the development of consciousness, namely, the point at which it becomes disentangled from the ties of nature. But, at the same time the emancipation from myth also leads to an extreme estrangement of man from the "real world" ("Those Who Wait," 118). Kant's philosophy rep- resented an unreflected formalization of knowledge at the price of dis- tance from reality; in this respect it corresponds to modem science and its relationship to reality. But since Kant it has become evident that the nature abandoned by consciousness does not remain unchanged 'in it- self,' but rather penetrates society and transforms it into a 'second na- ture.' This puts into question the Kantian concept of science as Kracauer attempted to show as early as 1922 in his study Soziologie als Wissenschaft: Eine erkenntnistheoretische Untersuchung [Sociology as Science: A Study in the The- ory of Knowledge]. The "Photography" essay speaks of the danger posed by the possibili- ty that nature, impermeable to consciousness, "would sit down at the table abandoned by the latter" ("Photography," 37). The funda- mental question of the Critique of Judgment regarding the possibili- ty of a reconciliation between nature and the human world - that is be- tween the world of rule-governed appearances and that of the truths governing actions, between science and ethics - is transformed by Kracauer from a transcendental philosophical query (committed to a priori knowledge and absolute truths) into an issue which is historically and socially variable. It is the latter which governs the aesthetic reflec- tions in the essays from the 1920s regardless of whether their focus is photography or the Tiller girls. What is at stake is the "bringing of truth into the world" ("Mass Ornament," 71). In the end, film is of interest not as a technological or artistic medium but in terms of its significance for the relationship of human beings to reality. This can be seen once again in the epilogue to Theory of Film which is subtitled, indicatively, "The Redemption of Physical Reality." Thus, in "Those Who Wait," Kracauer writes: "Due to the exaltation of theoretical thinking we have become distanced from this reality to a horrifying degree, a reality which is filled with incarnate things and people and which therefore demands to be seen concretely" ("Those Who Wait," 118).

In the "homogeneous cosmopolitan audience" the barriers imposed by the division of labor are dissolved. At moments, film presents the contours of the whole human being - physis and mind [Natur und Geist]. It is not the cinematic object in itself which is significant to the extent that it provides relief to both idling reas- on and to a deformed will; instead, it is in solidarity, in the coming together, that there resides hope for a new state of things. This can per- haps only be expressed by a writer who himself vacillates between an in- terest in knowledge and an interest in production. As a critic he posits his own 'waiting' as the measure for everyone's amusement and criti- cizes the mistaken assumption that going to the cinema is simply a way to occupy leisure time which only stabilizes reigning intellectual atti- tudes and material relations of production. At the same time, Kracauer counters the threat of cinema reverting to blind natural instincts by insisting on the power of the audience which is pressing towards a new type of subjectivity and a new relationship of society to nature. Beginning with BalAtzs and up through Adorno the affinity of film to the beauty of nature [Naturschiinen] has often been pointed out. When Kracauer's aesthetic of film (which is not only not a system but also is not reducible to the Theory ofFilm) makes this point it is not in terms of an in- herited romanticism, but as a critical claim based on Kant's articulation of the beauty of nature. In the 20th century, photographic reality has taken the place of nature. The world has taken on a "photographic face" ("Photography," 34) with which it conceals the abyss between nature and a consciousness which has gone off on its own. But photography not only conceals, it also betrays a treatment of nature which drains it of all life; reproducibility is one of the results of this treatment. This, how- ever, is what enables photography also to give rise to a tempting illusion, i.e. film, which promises the abolition of all social constraints. It is no longer the stroll "out in the open" or the landscape which is the source of aesthetic pleasure for the metropolitan masses but, rather, it is the visit to the dark movie theater. The fact that film has at its disposal the boundlessness of na- ture has often given rise to the incorrect assumption that the determining characteristic of film lies in the reproduction of nature and in this self-evidence in general [...]</page><page sequence="16">112 Kracauer's Writings of the 1920's But: As soon as we photograph nature, it is no longer nature but a transsubstantiation, a transformation of essence which takes over our capacity to innovate and thereby changes the origi- nal meaning of nature [...] It is therefore understandable that such an unprecedented metamorphosis of nature - into a realm where we perceive the things of nature with negative life force, a kind of sterile biodynamics - such a transformation must be evaluated entirely differently than nature itself. 16 In these statements from Die Kunst im Film. [Art in Film], Hans Salmon objects as early as 1921 to the idea that nature is simply reproduced in film. Instead, what he sees at work in the photographic medium is a transformation of nature which drains it of all life, an assessment not unlike that developed by Kracauer in the later "Photography" essay. However, Salmon immediately enlists the insights he has gained through "critical observations of contemporary life" in the service of the artistic "capacity to innovate." Kracauer, in contrast, dwells on this phe- nomenon of a changed nature and tries to understand it, rather than once again subordinating photographic reality to an interest in the work of art. His aesthetic theory, which grew out of a sociological scrutiny of the photographic medium, is constituted first of all by the distinction between a separate photographic reality and an historical-social reality and, second, by the definition of this difference not as a quality of the artwork but as a quality of nature. Since the 'remnants of nature' are, as such, not presented to perception by a meaning-producing subjectivity, they reveal a presence of humanity which is not realized by history. The redemptive photographic act applies primarily to external nature which includes to some extent even human nature. In Theory of Film the concept of 'realism' is tied to the documentary beginnings of the devel- opment of film (a genealogy beginning with Lumiitre); yet, this realism and the claims it makes are not permitted to exclude the fictional. Kracauer's own fascination with the fiction film prevented him from sharing the judgment of early opponents of film drama that the photo- graphic element of the medium commits it to external appearances and therefore prevents the possibility of moving beyond them into, for ex- 16.

The photographic element actually offers a critical dimension to the aesthetic of the fiction film since, emancipated from the style of illustrated newspapers as well as from the fetishization of verisimilitude, it contrasts with both arbitrary fantasy and positive reality, i.e. with any kind of anthropomorphism. Although Kracauer does depend on Kant's Critique ofJudgment he re- casts it from the perspective of the concept of the sublime for which he has more sympathy than for the concept of the beauty of nature [das Naturschiine], compromised by the triviality of the Rococo. Ultimately, he is seeking not to repudiate the beautiful illusion through a critique of id- eology, but rather to sublate [Aujhebung] this illusion within the aesthetic sphere by means of something which is already part of this aesthetic sphere itself. The latter is already designated by Kant in the phenome- non of the sublime. In it the reconciliating veil is torn and external na- ture is experienced as an opposition - a threatening experience and yet at the same time one in which man reassures himself of his own powers of reason which lie outside the bounds of the power of nature. If the photographic medium reveals the "realm of the dead in its independ- ence from human beings" ("Photography," 38) this revelation contains the terror that arises in the encounter with a nature devoid of subjectivi- ty. Yet, at the same time, nature ultimately does present itself to con- sciousness once again, and the subject, conversely, becomes aware of his or her separation from reality and experiences the possibility and ne- cessity of introducing reason (not necessarily limited to a human or sub- jective kind) into nature. In Kant's Christian metaphysics, truth was con- sidered to be beyond the earthly realm, like the thing in itself hidden from the world of experiences. For Kracauer, truth occurs - if at all - only in the realm of nature and only with the advent of a new temporali- ty which is no longer the temporality of historical linearity. At the vanishing point of Kracauer's radical construction of film aes- thetics lies not only the destruction of narrative structures but also the annihilation ofwish-fulfilling dreams. The photographic representation of reality, like the filmic reproduction of dreams, merely repeats second nature. Even the human unconscious, inner nature, is socially de- formed. The dream of the radically other can only be generated through the disintegration of this cycle of the fantasy context, can constitute itself only out of the constellation of exploded remnants of nature, the dregs of fantasy, but must not and cannot be derived immediately from sub- jective need and hope. Kracauer was, above all, ideologically suspicious</page><page sequence="18">114 Kracauer's Writings of the 1920's of the representation of instinctual nature and human sexuality in film, the concepts which make up the basic structure of cinematic fiction: the beautiful appearance reduced to a functional illusion. As demonstrated in From Caligari to Hitler, but rehearsed as early as the essay "The Little Shopgirls Go to the Movies" and in its numerous film reviews of the 1920s, such films provide the intellectual Kracauer with an explanation for the regressive wishes of the masses. Nevertheless, the possibility of making the audience aware of its own reason-less nature, in other words, the possibility of encountering one's own life-less desires in the cinema, is already suggested in "Cult of Distraction."
