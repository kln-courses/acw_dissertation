<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FRENCH REVIEW, Vol. LV, No. 1, October 1981 Printed in U.S.A. Pagan Ritual and Human Sacrifice in Merimee's Mateo Falcone by James F. Hamilton THE HISTORICAL POSITION OF MATEO FALCONE (1829) as the "literary prototype" and "modem source" of the short story reflects more than a judgment of aesthetic form.1 Merimee based his masterpiece upon a traditional tale of Corsica which, unbeknown to him, was probably a variant of an ancient story.2 My thesis has to do primarily with the story-telling instincts of Merimee rather than his deliberate intentions as a researcher and writer. He seized upon the ancient undercurrents of a legend and integrated a pagan myth into the Romantic aesthetic, creating a deceptively simple work composed of different cultural strata. The superimposed levels of thrust create a powerful impact in Mateo Falcone; its drama of filicide escapes art to strike emotional chords deeply imbedded within the collective human experience. The usual reaction of shock and horror clashes with the refusal of emotion by Mateo following the execution of his son, Fortunato, at the end of the story. This disparity creates a malaise on the part of the contemporary reader. His pragmatic reason and secularized values do not apply well to the plot, whose meaning seems to elude literary analysis.3 The attempt to explain the conflict in Mateo Falcone through comparisons with the polarity of love/duty under the Corelian principle of honor leads the reader further astray.4 This formulation imposes an intellectual standard on the short story that obscures the cultural context instead of elucidating its inherently pagan dimensions. Their compatibility with the author's tempera- ment and his art enables us to catch a fleeting insight into the interplay of the unconscious and the conscious in the creative process. Conflict in Mateo Falcone occurs on several planes. We bear a direct respon- sibility for one of them since it arises from our encounter as modem readers with 'See E. V. Telle, "Le Prototype litteraire de Mateo Falcone, " Studi Francesi, 15 (1971), 84-86. This judgment is confirmed by Murray Sachs in "The Emergence of a Poetics," French Literature Series: The Short Story, 2 (1975), 139-51. 2 See Telle, p. 84, and the thesis of Alexandre Krappe concerning "le thime de la trahison muette" in "Notes sur les sources de Merim6e," RHLF (1928), 256-60. 3 See Maria Kosko, "Le Theme de Mateo Falcone," Comparative Literature Proceedings of the Second Congress (1959), 294, who observes: "Nous croyons meme que c'est precis6ment parce que Merimee s'est servi des donn6es d'un conte traditionnel authentique, qu'il a reussi ce chef-d'oeuvre etrange dont nulle analyse litt6raire ne saurait expliquer l'emprise qu'il exerce sur le lecteur." 4 Kosko, p. 291. The application of original sin according to Genesis comes closer to the mythical thrust central to Mateo Falcone.

In order to appreciate the tragic dilemma in Mateo Falcone, the contemporary reader needs to realize the limits of desacralization in his own world, whether in terms of cultural patterns or the unconscious mind.6 As a skillful writer of intuitive insight into the human heart with all its passions and proclivity to violence, Merimee prepares the reader for entry into a world of foreign values and customs through a detailed description of the Corsican backwoods. The nature depicted by Merimee resembles more "the state of war" hypothe- sized by Hobbes than the indolent and bovine "etat primitif" of Rousseau's Discours sur l'origine de l'inegalite. It reflects the condition of man after his "fall" from an original naivete characterized by pitie towards animals and humans.7 In the opening to his short story, Merimee emphasizes the physical distance and inaccessibility of the nature setting: "En sortant de Porto-Vecchio et se dirigeant au N.-O [nord-ouest] vers l'int6rieur de l'ile, on voit le terrain s'elever assez rapidement, et, apres trois heures de marche par des sentiers tortueux, obstrues par de gros quartiers de rocs, et quelquefois coupes de ravins, on se trouve sur le bord d'un maquis tres etendu."8 The remoteness of location points to a change in moral outlook that is reinforced through stylistic devices. Verbs prevail; even the nouns and adjectives incorporate movement. The texture of the prose is made rough through the accumulation of hard consonants- r, k, z, t, etc. Finally, the rhythm has a martial quality of a steady no-nonsense beat made possible by a condensed style and an objective, cold point of view. Form prepares content, for the maquis shows itself to be a primitive world inhabited by men of action and constantly on the verge of violence. The maquis, upon close examination, reveals the coexistence of two cultures. The older one predominates and is represented by the shepherds and bandits, by their tools and weapons-hatchet and rifle-and by their brand of justice- vendetta. The more recent culture emanates from the urban setting of Porto- Vecchio, which hires police to enforce its judicial code upon the nomadic mountain people. A modus vivendi between the two antagonistic systems is made possible by the natural barricade, almost impenetrable, of brush trees. A symbiotic relationship exists between the peasant inhabitants of the maquis and its nomadic hunters and warriors. When sections of the brush are burned, ashes fertilize the soil to yield a rich harvest of grain and a vigorous growth of new trees the following spring: 5 Written accounts of the vendetta practiced in Corsica go back to the sixteenth century, and stories similar to that of Mateo Falcone were readily accessible in the eighteenth century.

Blood feuds appear in the "etat naissant" with the inception of love and vanity: "la jalousie s'eveille avec l'amour; la discorde triomphe, et la plus douce des passions recoit des sacrifices de sang humain" (p. 71). 8 Merim6e, Romans et Nouvelles, ed.

MERIMEE'S MATEO FALCONE 53</page><page sequence="3">I1 faut savoir que le laboureur corse, pour s'epargner la peine de fumer son champ, met le feu a une certaine etendue de bois: tant pis si la flamme se repand plus loin que besoin n'est; arrive que pourra, on est sur d'avoir une bonne recolte en semant sur cette terre fertilisee par les cendres des arbres qu'elle portait. (emphasis added) The mythical significance of this custom must be perceived in order to grasp the essentially ritualistic thrust of Fortunato's murder by his father, Mateo Falcone. The burning of the brush trees is a repeated action that corresponds to the seasons but whose symbolic meaning is timeless. It assures continued fertility and the purification of old wood through fire. These observations point to the ritualistic framework of ancient fertility rites that featured blood sacrifices, whether of animals or humans, among pagan peoples of the Mediterranean world.9 Trees often held for them the exalted status of sanctuary and abode of ancestral spirits; tribes of the African Slave Coast sacrificed either animals or human beings on the newly cut wood of dwellings so as "to propitiate the forest-spirits who may still be in the timber."1' The connection between the maquis and bloodletting is explicitly set forth in the sentence following its description: "Si vous avez tue un homme, allez dans le maquis...." The next sentence testifies to the blood feuds that are unleashed by such murders: "et vous n'aurez rien a craindre de la justice ou des parents du mort." The thesis of a fertility rite as an ancient and fundamental meaning of the annual burning of shrub trees presupposes a primitive context of sexual roles. This is the case in the Corsican mountains. Male dominance prevails in its monopoly on action. The female role, in contrast, is not individualized, not differentiated from nature. It is omnipresent but passive in the image of Mother Earth, Terra Mater, or universal Genetrix. This sexual role lacks even the prestige of a sacred vessel passively receiving the seed of man. In a paradigmatic model of human behavior, sexual union is pictured as a male violence that is necessarily visited upon a resistant sexual object. Penetration of the maquis defies even the horns of a "ram"; a "passage" must be forcibly opened with an "axe": "Ce n'est que la hache a la main que l'homme s'y ouvrirait un passage, et l'on voit des maquis si epais et si touffus, que les mouflons eux-memes ne peuvent y penetrer." This anthropomorphic view of earth as female victim and beneficiary of male aggression goes a long way in explaining the submissive image of woman in Mateo Falcone; her "marginality" in Corsican rustic society makes the woman along with the child and animals such as sheep prime prospects for sacrificial rites." A strict hierarchy of relationships is observed in Mateo Falcone. In descending order, it includes father, son, sons-in-law, other male relatives, wife, daughters, and strangers. At the top of this tribal pyramid reigns Mateo, whose authority as patriarch approximates that of absolute monarch and is symbolized by his constant 9 See James G. Frazer, The Golden Bough. A Study in Magic and Religion (New York: Macmillan, 1955), I, 309-41. 10 Frazer, p. 135. 1 For the concept of "marginality" as distance from the center of power in the abodes of warriors, see Rene Girard, La Violence et le Sacre (Paris: Grasset, 1972), p. 375. 54 FRENCH REVIEW</page><page sequence="4">association with the mountain man's rifle. His prowess as a marksman earns him respect through fear and a wife, Giuseppa.12 Their marriage is made possible by the murder of a rival, and Mateo "takes a wife" instead of courting her. This equation of union with violence, and love with war, reasserts in human terms the primitive Weltanschauung of the maquis landscape: "Mais on contait de lui qu'a Corte, oii il avait pris femme, il s'etait d6barrass6 fort vigoureusement d'un rival qui passait pour aussi redoutable en guerre qu'en amour..." (p. 240). Symbolically, as an arme and extension of a warrior, the rifle represents the rule of the phallus in a male-dominated world. Its potency is confirmed in the domestic life of Mateo and Giuseppa by the eventual birth of a son, after three daughters. Male progeny alone assures the continuity of Mateo's blood line: "et enfin un fils, qu'il nomma Fortunato: c'etait l'espoir de sa famille, l'h6ritier du nom" (p. 241). Significantly, Mateo names his son in a symbolic act of creation: in this primitive society procreation (as well as destruction) is seen as being predominantly an outcome of virility. Hence, only men are permitted to bear arms. As a warrior, Mateo spurns labor and allows his wife to struggle at his side "courb6e peniblement sous le poids d'un enorme sac de chataignes" while he walks with dignity, rifle in hand (p. 248). Mateo occupies a double position, profane and religious, in his tribal society as warrior chief and patriarch. Among primitive peoples, secular and sacred values and positions are not separated any more than the physical and spiritual worlds. Mateo's rifle acts also as the prophet's staff when it strikes the ground in final judgment against his son and when it sounds the earth for a soft place in which to bury him. Hence, as the giver and taker of life (both acts of violence in Mateo's culture), he acts in the place of the gods: "La violence et le sacre sont insepa- rables."'3 The sacred is brought into play by an "intrusion" into the daily life of Mateo Falcone's family, which, in its disturbance of cultural patterns with religious valorization, threatens not only the order of a domestic microcosm but also that of the macrocosm as manifested in nature.'4 The story of Fortunato's harboring of a wounded bandit, his betrayal of him to the police for a silver watch, and Mateo's subsequent execution of his son is well known and is poignant in its simplicity. However, the cultural values determining this chain of events and their linkage to an ancient way of life (whose traces survived in the oral tradition of storytelling) are less apparent. The following principles demand special consideration: sang, maison, argent, camarade. For example, all interaction between Fortunato, the bandit, and the captain of the police is based on value assumptions linked to blood lines-father, ancestors, or tribe. The first question of Gianetto, the bandit, does not deal directly with his pressing physical needs-bandages for his wound, water to drink, and refuge. He asks: "Tu es le fils de Mateo Falcone?" (p. 242). When the ten-year old boy balks 12 Various aspects of fear permeate the works of Merimee.

Me laisseras-tu donc arreter devant ta maison?" The values practiced by the bandit belong also to Fortunato. In his defense against the threats of the police to beat him and then to imprison him for withholding information, he twice replies with confidence: "Mon pere est Mateo Falcone" (p. 244). Not only do outsiders see him as the son of Mateo, but Fortunato is proud to define himself in the same way. Hence, a cultural perspective opens up: Fortunato has little individual identity; he is both the physical extension of his father and the bearer of his ethnic values. This attitude constitutes the framework of Mateo's judgment of his son when asking Giuseppa: "Femme ... cet enfant est-il de moi?" (p. 251). When she replies simply, "C'est ton fils," Mateo takes the crisis completely into his own hands with the statement: "Laisse- moi ... je suis son pere." As creator and patriarch, Mateo delivers judgment on a moral level above virtue and vice. The fatal seriousness of Fortunato's breach of faith with the bandit, Gianetto, can only be appreciated by entering into its cultural context. The drama unfolds in a ceremony of orchestrated values and ends in a ritual of human sacrifice. Its mise en scene occupies a place as holy as the porch of medieval cathedrals where the theater was reborn in Europe. Significantly, Gianetto asks if Fortunato will allow him to be arrested "devant ta maison," and the police are described as stopping "devant la porte de Mateo" (pp. 242, 243). Traditionally, the door of a home marks the boundary between the sacred world of private beliefs and the profane world of secular concerns.'5 It is a custom that survives in the practice of seeking sanctuary in a church or in an embassy. The sanctity of the threshold is illustrated by Fortunato's defiance of Gamba, the police captain, who threatens to search the premises: "Et que dira papa? ... s'il sait qu'on est entre dans sa maison pendant qu'il etait sorti?" (p. 244). The threshold is violated by Fortunato. When seeing Mateo approach in the company of Gamba, Gianetto, now under arrest, "sourit d'un sourire etrange; puis se tourant vers la porte de la maison, il cracha sur le seuil en disant: 'Maison d'un traitre!'" (p. 250; emphasis added). The curse of "traitre" evokes its feudal equivalent of "felon" in La Chanson de Roland. It conveys the breaking of an oath within a fraternal, military society. By accepting a silver coin from Gianetto, Fortunato enacted a rite of passage from the profane to the sacred worlds (often symbolized through "rites of incorporation" as in drinking, eating, or in offering a woman) that created a social bond and a religious duty. This "threshold covenant" symbolized by an exchange cannot be broken except by a special "rite of separation" in which the stranger (now incorporated into the family or tribe) releases the host from his trust in exchange for blood or gifts. The betrayal of this fraternal union is subject to a curse, which is invoked by Gianetto in his spitting on the threshold and in the anathema: "Maison d'un traitre!".'6 15 Van Gennep, p. 20. 16 For the concepts quoted above, see van Gennep, pp. 20, 23, 31. In another version of this legend, brought back from Corsica by a German historian named Gregorovius in 1854, the following moral is 56 FRENCH REVIEW</page><page sequence="6">Mateo's response to the curse triggers the tragic denouement. The guilt of a violated taboo falls upon his shoulders as patriarch, and he cannot avenge the insult as a warrior: "Cependant Mateo ne fit pas d'autre geste que celui de porter sa main a son front comme un accable" (p. 250). This epic gesture of anguish reflects the impotence of a leader faced by an impasse; he can no longer assure his family and followers of protection. Fortunato is excluded before his eyes from the rites of fraternity and from the ranks of manhood. When the lad approaches Gianetto with the offer of a drink, the prisoner spurns him-"Loin de moi!"-and addresses a guard instead: "Camarade, donne-moi a boire" (emphasis added). A mutual respect encompasses the bandit and his pursuers, despite the dead and wounded: "Le soldat remit sa gourde entre ses mains, et le bandit but l'eau que lui donnait un homme avec lequel il venait d'echanger des coups de fusil" (emphasis added). Forever shunned by the fraternity of warriors, Fortunato has no future in the Corsican mountains; he is spiritually dead. The values of Mateo leave him no recourse but to echo the scourge of Gianetto to his son by crying out: "Arriere de moi!" (p. 251). Only blood can right the wrong of Fortunato. Mateo's murder of his son, taking place outside of established law and religion, clearly reflects a cultural pattern of a much earlier age, that of purification through blood in human sacrifice. Two competing interpretations of this phenomenon apply to Mateo Falcone."7 Mythically, Mateo lives out an ancient fertility rite that originally immolated kings in order to assure regeneration but eventually substi- tuted the first born son and then a ram in his place.18 The function of such a ritualistic behavior was to restore equilibrium between the sacred and profane worlds eternally in a state of tension.'9 In support of this approach, we note that the sequence of tragic events begins in a season associated with death: "Un certain jour d'automne, Mateo sortit de bonne heure avec sa femme..." (p. 241). It links the annual burning of old wood in the opening description of the maquis (la flamme ... le feu) with the final scene also in the woods where "Mateo fit feu, et Fortunato tomba roide morte" (p. 252; emphasis added). The Christian layer to the ritual, the recitation of prayers, proves to be very superficial; sin is defined as Fortunato's ("Que Dieu to pardonne!"). Mateo experiences little guilt because, in following an inherited pattern of behavior, there is no calculation or premeditation on his part.20 Finally, equilibrium is restored and regeneration is assured when Mateo directs his son-in-law to live with him and symbolically to take the place of his only son. The bad seed is purged and fertility is safeguarded. The other interpretation of human sacrifice derides the notions of appeasing pronounced by the father upon condemning his son: "Sainte est l'antique loi de l'hospitalite. La violer c'est devenir, devant Dieu et devant les hommes, un Cain." See Maria Kosko, Le Theme de Mateo Falcone (Paris: Nizet, 1960), pp. 38, 40. 17 Girard composes his study in opposition to the findings of Frazer, Turner, and van Gennep. See La Violence et le Sacre, pp. 46, 57, 77. 18 Frazer, p. 340. 19 See van Gennep, p. xiii, who summarizes standard interpretations. 20 See Girard, p. 396. The same conclusion is reached with a different logic by Frank Bowman who defends Mateo against the charge of hypocrisy.

Psychologically, it contends that man cannot face his own violence and purges him of this inclination by transferring it to another in the choice of a "scapegoat": "La victime emissaire meurt, semble-t-il, pour que la communaute, menacee tout entiere de mourir avec elle, renaisse a la fecondite d'un ordre nouveau ou renouvele."2' Although this theory accepts the last stage of equilib- rium in the ritual process, it denies the notion of passage from the profane to the sacred that is initiated supposedly by a specific incident or intrusion. Structurally, this highly rational method relegates religion to the role of curbing the violence in man that constantly threatens to unravel the fabric of society. In view of the blood feuds practiced in the maquis, this approach applies to Mateo Falcone: "La religion, en effet, n'a jamais qu'un seul but et c'est d'empecher le retour de la violence reciproque."22 The offended party in this specific case, Gianetto, is not clearly identified with any clan. Nevertheless, the social structure with its fixed order of values and roles is reaffirmed with the sacrificial death of Fortunato and his replacement by Mateo's son-in-law. The interpretations of myth and psychostructuralism agree as to the presence of a sacrificial ritual in Mateo Falcone that reflects a pagan stratum in Corsican culture and a destructive tendency deep in the human psyche. However, from the standpoint of literary criticism, Merimee's short story succeeds primarily as a work of art within the context of Romanticism, not as a Corsican artifact. Without resorting to ancient models, Merimee rediscovers the origins of tragedy in a tale situated in modem Europe and in a hero of national dimension. Simplicity of language and local color function as integral parts of the plot whose drama is only intensified by violence.23 M6rim6e's success proves the potential of the Romantic aesthetic to produce works of art with the emotional intensity and impact of French Classicism, as recommended by Victor Hugo in the Preface de Cromwell (1827): "Il faut puiser aux sources primitives. C'est la meme seve, repandue sur le sol, qui produit tous les arbres de la foret, si divers de port, de fruits, de feuillage."24 Whether the landmark of Mateo Falcone constitutes a functional breakthrough within the history of French literature does pose a problem, however. Merimee brings to his legendary plot an intuitive insight into violence and a highly rational mind. The tension between the rational and the irrational in Mateo Falcone (i.e., between the restraint of M6rimee both as a stylist and as a detached observer of foreign customs and the primitive energy of a pagan substratum with its ritualistic behavior) amplifies the conflict in his short story. This feature complicates its 21 See Girard, p. 353. In the Gregorovius version, the communal aspect of his ritualistic death is emphasized; the boy, Joseph, is judged, condemned, and shot by his relatives.
