<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 By James Whitley, Sophia Germanidou, Dusanka Urem-Kotsou, Anastasia Dimoula, Irene Nikolakopoulou, Artemis Karnava and Eleni Hatzaki INTRODUCTION As the cover page of this year's Archaeological Reports should make clear, this year's Archaeology in Greece is the work of many hands. As pointed out in last year's introduc tion (AR 51 [2004-2005], 1-2), while I (James Whitley) retain responsibility for the sections from Athens to Kerkyra (Corfu), other areas have been assigned to other scholars. Sophia Germanidou is responsible for the Byzantine sections. Dusanka Urem-Kotsou and Anastasia Dimoula are jointly responsible for Macedonia and Thrace, and Irene Nikolakopoulou and Artemis Karnava for the Aegean islands. Eleni Hatzaki continues (as she has done since 1998) to be responsible for Crete. All these names should have appeared on the cover of last year's AR, and it is only because of an oversight at the last stage of the production process that they did not. Previous introductions have emphasized patterns that have become apparent through the accumulation of evidence for particular periods. Ar Crete and Macedonia, LAr to Cl Argos, Sparta, Arta and Thebes, Pal Epiros and Thessaly, Myc Phthiotis and Thessaly and even Rom Boeotia and Epiros have all received their due. One area (or period) that has come into sharper focus recently is the MBA (or MH) of mainland Greece. The MH was the subject of a major conference, entitled (appropriately) ME20EAAAAIKA/MESOHEL LADIKA organized jointly by the French, American and Dutch Schools and held in Athens in early March 2006. New finds were aired, and old settlements (such as Eutresis in Boeotia, or the Aspis settlement near Argos) re-assessed. The conference impressed everyone with the number of scholars it attracted. Such an expression of interest in a period generally thought to be neglected should not have been so much of a surprise to those (those few, I should think) who have been carefully monitoring the accumulation of MH (and MBA) finds in the pages of Archaeology in Greece. For much more has come to light in recent years; several MBA settlements with the characteristic apsidal house plans have turned up as a result of the widening of the national road in the Nomos of Magnesia in Thessaly, and MH material has even turned up in places as unlikely as Lamia. Much of the new funerary evidence clusters around the major centres of Myc, Ar and Cl Greece. MH graves have turned up in Argos, Thebes and Sparta. The concentration of MH burials from in and around Sparta (Amyklai and Kouphovouno) is particularly impressive, especially when linked to earlier discoveries in and around the Menelaion. While most of these burials are 'poor' inhumations (in jars or in simple trenches), some graves (in Sparta and Thebes) at the very end of the period and cusp of LH I are much more richly furnished. This is especially true of the graves at Psychiko Spartis, the sports field that faces the MH site of the Menelaion on the other side of the Evrotas river. Something similar to the 'shaft grave' phenomenon, usually associated with sites in the Argolid such as Lerna or Mycenae, seems therefore to be occurring more widely in S Greece during this period. These facts have recently prompted a more wide-ranging re-appraisal of the skeletons from MH and LH I graves by osteoarchaeologists and physical anthropologists. Such re-examination should tell us whether those buried 'richly' were also better fed than those buried 'poorly', and whether there is any gender bias in 'rich' against 'poor' graves, even if the grander claims of DNA analysis often prove disappointing. The shaft grave phenomenon is also an example of accultur ation? in this case the use of Cretan (Minoan) material culture and 'style' for mainland (Myc) ends. It is instructive to compare this process on the mainland with that observable on the islands of Aigina and Kythera, on the periphery of the MH world. Recent fieldwork combined with ceramic analysis (both p?trographie and chemical) by both the Austrian Institute and British School (both regularly reported in Archaeology in Greece) has shed light on this. Aigina seems to have been a major centre for the production of a distinctive range of fine and coarse wares, often found at sites in the Argolid. From some time in the MBA, both Aiginetan and Kytheran potters begin imitating Cretan ('Minoan') decorative types and forms. In the case of Kythera, as p?trographie study and replication experiments have revealed, it is not so much a case of superficial 'imitation' of surface decoration or shape, but of a wholesale replication of production practices (including a preference for certain clays) otherwise characteristic of central Crete. If Aigina, therefore, represents a selective process of 'acculturation', whereby the local society took what it liked or needed from Crete, the process observable in Kythera seems to represent a (perhaps not entirely voluntary) assimilation of the island within the 'Minoan' cultural and political sphere. Scholarly interest in the late MH and LH I?II periods is focused on the origins, or beginnings, of something we call a 'civilization'. A similar interest drives research into the EIA. One of the longstanding questions of EIA scholarship is that of continuity. Does the violent destruction of the Myc palaces around 1200 BC betoken something more than just a political collapse? Or do aspects of 'Gr culture' continue across the BA/IA divide? Nowhere is this debate more vigorous than in the field of Gr religion. Recent discoveries at the (so-called) Menelaion near Sparta and at Kalapodi in anc. Phokis (mod. Phthiotis) have revived this longstanding debate. Recent tests at the Menelaion have indicated that the earliest Ar structure overlies a thick LMyc stratum (whose character could not be further assessed). Renewed excavations at Kalapodi have demonstrated continuity of cult from at least LH IIIC times throughout the EIA and into the Ar period. Though not on the sea itself, Kalapodi, like many sites in Greece, is easily accessible from it, and in this sense is one of a number of EIA settlements to be found on either side of the Euboian Gulf. The Gulf itself thus forms a highway on the sea, one that connects the N Cyc islands of Andros with Attica, Euboia, Boeotia, Lokris, Phthiotis and (ultimately) S Thessaly. Such 'connectivity' (it has been argued) encourages a certain fluidity in human settlement, a fact perhaps not unconnected to the involvement of Chalkis, Eretria (where the Swiss have recently renewed their excavations around the W gate) and perhaps Oropos in what used to be called the colonization of parts of Italy in the 8th Ct BC. Renewed excavations at the settlement of Xeropolis at Lefkandi, the new American/Gr synergasia at Mitrou and rescue excavations around the Gulf of Magnesia (particularly at the cemetery of Agrielia Platanou near anc. Halos) have shed much light on the earlier (LH IIIC, SubMyc, ProtoGeo and SubProtoGeo) phases of these interlinked maritime communities. One question that requires further investigation is whether such maritime sites flourish particularly in times of a political 'power vacuum' ? that is, whether the revival of Lefkandi is (in a sense) linked to the decline of the palatial centre of Thebes, to which it was probably linked in Myc times.</page><page sequence="2">2 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. All these questions (and inferences) arise from the accumula tion of positive evidence. The inferences one can (and cannot) draw from negative evidence are more rarely discussed. Two categories of objects associated in the popular mind with Ar and Cl Greece (particularly the 6th and 5th Cts) are bf and rf painted pottery. The images of? and on ? such 'vases' have been taken to be synonymous with Hellenism, and it is perhaps for this reason that prospective candidates for the Greek Archaeological Service are still tested on their knowledge of bf and rf iconography and attribution before they can join the service. But one of the striking facts to come out of any survey of the evidence from mainland Greece is the comparative rarity of bf and rf pottery, outside the major production centres of Boeotia, Corinth, Sparta and (most particularly) Attica. The rarity of bf and rf 'vases', particularly ones which can be attributed to known painters (e.g., the one from Pelasgia; AR 51 [2004-2005], 57) contrasts markedly with the ubiquity of black glazed finewares in the majority of regions of mainland Greece. The exception to this rule is LAr and EC1 Macedonia, a region where bf and rf imports of'symposium' vessels are frequently to be found in the richer graves in the cemeteries of Archontiko and Sindos. In this respect, Macedonia closely resembles Etruria, two regions of the Mediterranean which were avid consumers of Attic pottery and are thus ripe for a comparative (and contextual) analysis of the uses and significance of Attic imports. Such a prospect takes us some way from the scope of Archaeology in Greece, though not from AR in general, where surveys of Etruria have appeared in the past. Such regional comparisons are clearly desirable, though equally difficult to put into practice, since they would require an unprecedented level of co-operation between a number of institutions based in (or concerned with) the anc. Mediterranean. But such a comparison would be entirely in keeping with the spirit of Altertumswissenschaft which has animated the study of the anc. world for over two Cts. A word of caution about our sources: though it purports to be a digest of the archaeological work undertaken in Greece from 1 April 2005 until 31 March 2006, Archaeology in Greece 2005-2006 in fact remains a compilation of several sources, not all of which relate to archaeological work that took place in this particular year. Only one volume of the Deltion (ADelt B Chron 54 [1999]) covering the work undertaken by the Ephoreias of Attica to Kerkyra in 1999, has appeared this year. For Macedonia and Thrace we are reliant largely on AEMTH 18 for 2004, which is a little more up-to-date. Newspaper articles are, of course, up-to-date, but necessarily less reliable than reports by archaeologists, and even the reports from the ASA (in Ergon) and the foreign schools (which are up-to-date) have a preliminary and so provisional character. Caveat lector. Finally, it remains to thank all those who have contributed to the production of Archaeology in Greece this year. First, my fellow authors (whose names appear on the cover). Second, I would like to thank the Greek Archaeological Service, all the Gr Ephoreias and all the individual contributors from the foreign schools and elsewhere for their part in making Archaeology in Greece the internationally respected research resource that it is. As in previous years, members of staff of the School have gone out of their way to help. Helen Clark and Vicki Tzavara have been invaluable in obtaining images and organizing the foreign school contributions; Penny Wilson, our Librarian, has supplied the list of publications (organized by region); Tania Gerousi has organized the newspaper clippings. Heinrich Hall has translated the German and Austrian, and Maria Eleni Gorini the French, Belgian and Italian contributions. Heinrich Hall and Egbert Plugge have also helped greatly with last minute editing. Photographic credits are given separately, at the end. NATIONAL MUSEUMS National Archaeological Museum. I.

Stasinopoulou and E.Andreopoulou-Mamgkou (ADelt B Chron 54 [1999], 8-17) report on the year's work. In all departments the work of conservation, cleaning and cataloguing continued, and the damage caused by the 1999 earthquake was repaired. In the Prehistoric Collection the majority of the Thera frescoes were removed to a new museum on Thera. New acquisitions (from seizures) included Neo and Cyc (ECyc?) figurines, Myc pottery, bronzes and glass jewellery. In the Sculpture Department acquisitions included a LCI (4th Ct BC) dedicatory relief and a Rom funerary stele inscribed: AupiyXio?) TopKOvaro? Avp(&lt;r)\ia)) TovpKOvara) T(t&gt; T KV(? {wei-l A?

In the Department of Egyptian and Asiatic Antiquities the identification of small finds of faience and stone from the collection of the Archaeological Society of Athens continued. Thirty three scarabs, some of lapis lazuli, and one faience ring bearing the cartouche of Tutankhamun (1347-1338 BC) (Fig. 1) were identified. Acquisitions include a wooden ibis on a stone base, confronting a small bronze statue of the goddess Maat (Fig. 2) dating to the 26th Dynasty (664-525 BC). In the Department of Bronzes acquisitions from seizures included 65 objects of bronze, silver, iron and lead. Acquisitions in the Department of Vases and Small Finds include Rhodian Hel lamps, Boeotian LAr-ECl aryballoi (probably from looted tombs). Finds from seizures include CG-CA amphorae (Fig. 3), Rom glasswares, a LCI (4th Ct) gold necklace made in the 'loop in loop' technique (Fig. 4), gold Hel finger rings, mostly of the 3rd Ct BC, but one LHel/ERom (1st Ct BC/lst Ct AD) inscribed XAIPE. 1.

Touratsoglou (ADelt, 18-30) reports on activities in 1999. A new website (www.culture.gr/nm/presveis/) provides links with other numismatic collections, especially those in the Department of Coins and Medals at The British Museum. Hundreds of individual coins, ranging in date from LAr to recent times, have been acquired through purchase, gift and seizure, and the museum has assisted in the identification of finds from excavations and seizures in outlying Ephoreias. The only 'hoard' is of 24 LRom bronze 'asses', of unknown provenance. Epigraphic Museum Ch. Kritzas (ADelt, 31-35) reports on two new acquisitions from the 1st EBA. The 1st (EM 13502) is an inscribed MHel (ca 150-100 BC) funerary kioniskos in Hymettan marble found during restoration work at the church of Agioi Asomatoi near the Theseion, and already noted (SEG XXI 1006; SEG XXX 246). After cleaning the following could be read: AnOAAO[NIA AnOAAO[IOT 0TTAT[HP ET20T AE [TT] [NH] APTI SE NT0IA0I2IN AB [-] TAHMON O AT2IMEAH2 AMOE[XANEN 0ANATO2 OT TENEHN E5 ANAP02 E0I2 En[I T0TNA2I -1 NOTSm A' APrAAEHI SOMA [-] AN0' ON 2E, AnOAAONOS EnON[TME ?] AAKPT0EI2 ET20T2 EKTE[PEI5 ?] The 2nd inscription (EM 13503) is the lower right fragment of a LRom funerary monument in white marble, found in the small church of Agioi Pantoi (Agia Panta), O.

Ta Nea (16/11/2005), Eleftherotypia (16/11/2005) and Kathimerini (16/11/2005) report on a new find in the Theatre of Dionysos. In the course of reconstructing the W retaining wall of the LRom phase of the theatre, the inscribed base of a statue of the LCI dramatist Astydamas (ca 340 BC) was discovered. The inscription indicates his intention that his statue be set up in the company of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides.</page><page sequence="4">4 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. iIwT? 6.

Vassilopoulou (ADelt, 43-45) reports on excavations in four locations, revealing chiefly marble disiecta membra of Cl to Rom date. Finds include, at O. ?reos 14, two funerary stele, one Rom example showing a priestess of Isis, an inscribed stele and a fragment of a statue; at O. Thrasyvoulou 17 a funerary relief; at O.

Library of Hadrian/unification of archaeological sites. G Knithakis and G Tinginaka (ADelt, 57-62) report on the programme of restoration of the Library of Hadrian, particu larly its entrance fa?ade. A. Spetsieri-Choremi (ADelt, 63-67) notes discoveries made in the course of work towards the unification of archaeological sites near the library and the Roman agora. Cleaning in the W peristyle of the library revealed more inscriptions, sculpture and architectural members built into later Ot buildings, including a Rom head of a bearded man and the fragment of the right hand of a colossal Rom statue of a man grasping a shield (Fig. 8). 8.

John Camp (ASCSA) reports on the 2005 season of excavation: 'In section BZ, NW of the Stoa Poikile we worked, for the most part, in Rom levels, dating from the 1st to 5th Cts AD. Much more of the N-S street was excavated, revealing a series of hydraulic installations (Fig. 9). These included a closed round terracotta pipeline (4/5th Ct AD) and a 3m stretch of lead pipe, both presumably designed to carry fresh water. Along the E side of the street we exposed more of the large, late, deep drain known from excavations further S. Used for a long time, it was repaired repeatedly and was covered with a bewildering array of disparate material: amphorae, large wall or floor tiles, and canonical curved cover tiles. One rare find came from the fill over the S part of the drain: a small statuette of Aphrodite carved from elephant ivory (Fig. 10). She is missing her right hand and both feet, but is otherwise well-preserved, measuring h. 0.085m. In her left hand she is holding a large lock of hair away from her head, apparently to dry it. This type was very popular in antiquity and is often referred to as the Aphrodite Anadyomene, based on a famous painting by the 4th Ct painter Apelles, showing Aphrodite emerging from the sea, wringing water and sea-foam from her hair. Similar Aphrodite figurines of this type have been found in the area. As they now span four Cts (lst-4th Cts AD) and two materials (ivory and terracotta) it seems increasingly unlikely that they are all the product of a single workshop in the area, but rather of a single sanctuary. They may, therefore, perhaps be used as further evidence that the altar and later remains found just to the S are indeed dedicated to Aphrodite Ourania. A large rubble wall overlying the drain was partially removed and proved to date to the 6l Ct AD, providing a useful taq for the drain and the latest Rom phase of the E street wall and a marble threshold block of unusual type (Fig. 11). The threshold does not have the usual raised doorstop all along the /. of the block. Rather it has a long slot, into which a series of boards could be slid, one after another, with a locking device necessary only for the final board; in effect, a sort of horizontal shutter for the doorway. Two things are noteworthy about such a door. First, it is rare in Greece, the other examples coming from the Library of Pantainos, also in the Agora; most other examples are found in Italy, in large numbers, at Ostia and Pompeii (GP. Stevens Hesperia 18 [1949], 269-74). Second, securing and opening a doorway in this manner is appropriate for wide doors and ones intended to stay open; that is, for shops, as in the case of those in the Library of Pantainos. This threshold might therefore serve to bolster our tentative conclusion that the building along the E side of the street housed a series of shops in the Rom period. W of the street we continued excavating in mixed Rom fills. The upper ones seem to date to the E 5th Ct AD and are perhaps to be associated with cleaning the area after Alaric and the Visigoths attacked the city in 395 AD. The lower fills produced numerous examples of the cone-shaped projections character istic of tegulae mammatae (Fig. 12), used in the heating systems of Rom baths (Pliny, NH 35. 159 and Vitruvius 7. 4. 2). These seem to come from a Rom bath in the immediate vicinity which was remodelled in the E 3rd Ct AD and went out of use at the end of the 4th Ct. The fact that we found great numbers of the corners with their cones or just the cones alone suggests that they were deliberately knocked off and discarded so the rest of the tile could be used elsewhere as building material. E of the street we excavated areas in line with the N contin uation of the commercial building to the S. Thus far it is not clear how far N those shops extend, but the stratigraphy thus far suggests that our area followed the same sequence and is likely to be related. For the most part we recovered fills of the 10. Athens: agora, statuette of Aphrodite 1st Ct AD, with very large numbers of fragments of very poor quality terracotta figurines. At the far N end of the trench we recovered a deposit of several amphorae, broken but in situ. Two of them are similar and unusual in the Agora (Fig. 13); they have ring feet and can stand on their own, as opposed to the pointed toes of almost all our other hundreds of examples. The rim is broad and flat on top, while short handles are attached halfway up a tall neck. These combined characteris tics are best paralleled in amphora type Gauloise 5, from S France, dating to the L lst/2nd Ct AD, so these jars have had a long journey (F. Laubenheimer, La Production des Amphores en Gaule Narbonnaise sous le haut-empire, Paris [1985], figs 154-57; M. Sciallono and P. Sibella, Amphores: Comment les Identifier?, Aix [1994]).</page><page sequence="6">6 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. mV** i... 11. Athens: agora, threshold block 12. Athens: agora, tegulae mammatae Other finds of interest include a small marble head of a bearded male, perhaps from a herm (Fig. 14), found in surface fill, and a small piece of worked bone carved with a palmette at one end, apparently a stamp for decorating pottery (Fig. 15). In short, along the E side of the road it looks as though the Cl commercial building may have extended to the N, going out of use in the 1st Ct AD and replaced by other shops which functioned throughout much of the LRom period. Various 13. Athens: agora, Rom amphorae 14. Athens: agora, marble head 15. Athens: agora, stamp for decorating pottery</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 7 features perhaps indicate that the neighbourhood was frequented and/or the shops run by Italians: the Gallic wine jars, the unusual threshold block, the use of a lead pipe (rather than terracotta) to deliver water and the lamp with two gladiators named in Latin, found a few meters to the E in 1995 (Hesperia [1996], 241, no. 19). In section BH we finished clearing the Byz levels, down to the bottoms of the walls; that is, well below floor level. For the most part we seem to be entirely in the 10th Ct AD, with brown glazed and white ware pottery, and with no sgraffito or green and-brown painted wares of the 11th and 12* Cts. The walls were of rubble: field stones and re-used anc. blocks set in clay. The area is so small that no plan of any building could be recovered, and even what seem to be individual rooms rarely have four respectable walls. The fill alongside these walls has proved remarkably deep and undifferentiated, especially to the E, and there is little stratigraphie evidence of extended use of the area, though two or more periods could be identified in the junctures and relative depths of some of the walls. Though one drain, one pithos and some areas of deep ash or carbon were encountered, there seem to be far fewer of the installations and evidence for storage (especially pithoi), which were outstanding and common features of the contemporary buildings to the W. Also unusual, in comparison to sections BE and BZ to the W, is the fact that none of the walls in section BH rest on LRom predecessors. In section T, just SW of the Tholos, we returned to investigate a large building of the mid-5th Ct BC, which has been tentatively identified in the past as the Strategeion, head quarters of the ten generals (strategoi). The building is trapezoidal in shape, measuring ca 20m by 25m. It is poorly preserved, with only a few squared blocks of poros remaining of the exterior walls, with traces of interior walls of rubble or polygonal masonry. The plan is restored as several rooms grouped around a central courtyard. The identification as the Strategeion has been based on several factors, primarily the location and large size of the building, along with a handful of relevant inscriptions found in the general vicinity. Other interpretations are possible, however, one of them being that it served as a commercial building. We returned in order to clarify the plan and also in the hope of finding evidence which would tip the balance in favour of either a public use (inscriptions or public antiquities such as tokens) or a commercial one ('pyres'). Several dozen shallow pits, containing anywhere from three to 35 pots, have been uncovered in the Agora excavations; usually accompanied by signs of burning and a few animal or bird bones, they are known to us as 'pyres'. They presumably represent some private cult ritual about which the literary sources are silent. Of the 50 or so recovered, all have been found in either houses or shops, none in public buildings or sanctuaries, and their presence (or absence) would therefore help with understanding the possible identification of the building. A single pyre was found in this building in the original excavations; though we have a good deal more to excavate, no additional pyres were found in 2005. Other evidence recovered perhaps favours a public function for the building. First, it is worth noting that the entire W side of the building is cut out of the steep bedrock slope of the SE foot of Kolonos Agoraios, and that the central part is made up of a surprisingly deep fill consisting largely of the bedrock dug out of the W half. In places this fill is over 2.5m deep below the original floor level. The bedrock of the hill is cut back some 9m along the entire length of the building, to a d. at the W of as much as 2.5m. In quarrying back the hillside the builders seem to have disturbed an E burial. The skull and assorted bones of a female skeleton in a flexed position were recovered in the central fill, along with a fair number of Geo sherds (in this connection it is perhaps worth noting that a Geo/EAr cemetery was found between this building and the Tholos). The special effort that went into siting and constructing the building in this particular spot should perhaps be regarded as evidence that it was intended to serve a public function and that both its large size and a location close to other major public buildings were regarded as necessary. Also part of the story was the discovery of a large hoard of Athenian silver tetradrachms, buried in a sack under the lowest floor in the E part of the building (see also To Vima, Kathimerini and Eleftherotypia [12/08/2005]). In all, 46 coins were removed separately, and the rest were lifted in a concreted mass weighing 6,280 grammes (Figs 16,17,18 and 19). Allowing for about 17 grammes per coin, the whole hoard should consist of 400-420 coins, weighing ca 7,062 grammes (about 15.5 lbs). All the coins seen so far are standard Athenian tetradrachms with the helmeted head of Athena on the obverse, with the owl, olive sprig and legend AOE on the reverse. They date to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC and are of the 'pi' or 'bracket' type, taking their name from the relief decoration on Athena's helmet. Other indications of date are the treatment of Athena's ear and the number of relief dots used to decorate the owl. Hoards of this type and size found in controlled excavations are extremely rare, largely without parallel within the walls of Athens. The closest is a hoard of 292 coins (282 of them similar Athenian silver 16. Athens: agora, coin hoard as found 17.

Athens: agora, cleaned coins from coin hoard tetradrachms) found in a pot in the Belgian excavations at the deme-site of Thorikos, in SE Attika (J. Bingen, 'Le Tr?sor Mon?taire Thorikos 1969', in H. Mussche et. al. eds, Thorikos 1969, Brussels [1973], 1-59). Much more work will be needed by the conservators and numismatist before questions of the date of deposition can be answered, but there are numerous occasions in the L 4th and E 3rd Cts when troubles for Athens might have led someone to conceal these coins. The 1st observation might be that the hoard represents a considerable amount of money, 1,600 drachmas when the drachma was about a daily wage, so about five years' income. A 2nd observation is that they all seem to be Attic tetradrachms; if this hoard were assembled by a merchant, one might expect more of a mix of denominations. On balance, it looks as though the hoard were concealed by someone with access to public funds. If the building itself is indeed public, the two likeliest candidates on the basis of size and location are the Strategeion and Poleterion; the new hoard may favour the latter identification. The Poletai worked closely with the boule and were responsible for the administration of large amounts of public money, including the payments for leases of the silver mines.' S of Acropolis, Makriyianni. S. Eleftheratou and N. Saraga (ADelt, 45-56) report on major excavations in the area bounded by O. Dionysiou Areopagitou, O. Stratigou Makriyianni, O. Chatzichristou and O. Mitsaion in advance of construction of the new Museum of the Acropolis. These excavations have revealed extensive remains, particularly of the LRom to MByz periods, shedding light on what has hitherto been an obscure period in Athens' history. Excavation concentrated on the W of the site (Fig. 20). Habitation here was defined by three major roads running at right-angles. The 1st phase of road I (w. 3.5-4m, /. 50m), running E-W, dates to the LCI period (4th Ct BC); road II (4m by 65m) and road III (3m by 24m) run N-S, the latter continued by a small parodos. The excavation was partitioned into five sectors. Sector 1, S of road I, contained three houses. So far only the court and two bases of internal peristyle from the LRom-ECh house A have been revealed. The floors have a layer of marble chips underneath. The later, EByz (6th-7th Ct AD) house B, built over the foundations of house A, contained sixteen rooms and a well. It seems to have been constructed in three phases, and shows signs of fire damage. Of the LRom ECh (4th/5th Ct AD) house A, across the street, only the central courtyard has so far been revealed. Sector 2, bound by road I to the S and road II to the W, contained two substantial structures. House T is another LRom/ECh (5th-6th Ct AD) dwelling with a central peristyle court, the floor of which was covered in opus sectile, and several rooms leading off it. The principal structure is building E, a major ECh/EByz complex the central feature of which is an apsidal hall on a N-S axis, /. 25m and w. 9.5m. To the N is a cistern lined with hydraulic cement, part of a much wider hydraulic complex. To the S and E are five smaller rooms. Access to an upper floor via a stairway went through room 8, which joins the large hall with another circular hall. Between these is a triconch room. All this indicates a major public building. Coins of Constans II and Heraclius (610-641) found in the foundations provide a tpq in the 7th Ct AD. The period of use of the building is unclear. By the 8th/9th Cts parts of the structure were being used as a ceramic workshop, and by the 9th/10th Cts further hydraulic installations and a kiln indicate industrial activity. There are indications of earlier (LCl-EHel) structures throughout sector 2. Residual pottery of Ar, Geo, MH and Neo date has also been found. Finds in sector 3, to the N, are chiefly LRom, and are perhaps connected to bathing. There appears to be another large LRom/ECh structure in sector 4, to the W of road II, as well as Hel levels. To the N of the sector is another MByz structure, with pottery of the 11th to 12th Cts AD. Sector 5, to the E, has revealed the hypocaust and 'bi-conch' walls of a LRom bathhouse. Finds comprise sculpture, including a colossal Hel head of a female deity, probably Aphrodite, small statues of Aphrodite, Asklepios, Hygeia, Isis, Kybele (Fig. 21) and of the Rom mortal Faustina. LRom/ECh lamps and coins help to date the structure. Central Athens (3rd EPCA) Mets.

Tsirogoti-Drakotou (ADelt, 73-74) note a well full of Cl (5th/4th Ct BC) pottery at O. Kalogirou Samouel 2 and remains of the city's defences and three rooms belonging to an ERom (1st Ct AD) workshop at the junction of O. Psaromiligkou 21 and Agion Asomaton 33 NE of Kerameikos. Kerameikos W.-D. Niemeier (DAI Athens) and T. Mattern (Marburg) report on the 2005 season: 'The excavation project near the Sacred Gate was completed. To clarify some outstanding issues, excavations were conducted in two areas: (a) on the Sacred Way in the NW area of the Sacred Gate; and (b) in the gateway beside the SE curtain wall. (a) The examination of several street layers belonging to different phases of the gate was continued (see AR 50 [2003 2004], 6) in a 9m sounding (Fig. 22, no. 2). The raised street levels belonging to the later phases of the Sacred Gate (from the 3rd Ct BC onwards) had already been removed without docu mentation at the start of the Kerameikos excavations ca 1870. From the street of the 2nd architectural phase, only the stone packing of its substructure survived. Ceramics recovered here will help to clarify the uncertain dating of the 2nd phase (see AR 50 [2003-2004], 6). Below this packing lay the intact surface of the street built by Themistokles in the winter of 479-478 BC together with the 1st phase of the Sacred Gate. Its surface contained many deep wheel ruts. Below it was a stone packing of 30 cm d., followed by the levelling deposit of red clay which had already been noted in front of the Sacred Gate in 2002 2003. It contained pottery fragments from the L 8th to the turn of the 6th/5th Cts BC that belong to tombs destroyed by the Persians. Seven larger stone blocks were randomly embedded in the clay, their upper portions protruding into the stone packing of the Themistoklean street. Five of the blocks are architectural elements of Ar grave monuments of soft yellow limestone (poros), the other two are blocks of coarse limestone. These stones, continuing the row of sculptures discovered in 2002 towards the SE, were 'buried' here to reinforce the packing layer underneath the Themistoklean street. To the NW, the layer also contained the missing front paw of the fragmentary marble sphinx recovered 7.5m to the NW in 2002 (AR 48 [2001-2002], 10-11, figs 16-17; W.-D. Niemeier, Der Kuros vom Heiligen Tor [2002], 28, 32-33, figs 23-24, 26, 35 37). Below the levelling deposit, we found the Persian destruction layer with fragments of partially burnt limestone as well as charcoal. Below it lay the surface of the 6th Ct Ar street. (b) Here, we examined a structure (Fig. 22, no. 5) which the 1st phase SW curtain wall deliberately avoided by turning slightly to the NE. Its NE long wall was only built over when the curtain wall was straightened in the 3rd phase (last quarter 5th Ct). The structure's 15.2m fa?ade faces the Sacred Way. A short visible stretch (where its E end protrudes below the later wall curtain) indicates that it is a well-built polygonal wall on a foundation h. lm, all of hard limestone. Two 7.2m long transverse walls in the NW and SE are contemporary with the NE long wall. The S long wall used as its foundation an older wall that also faced NE and was built in a rougher polygonal style than the later structure's NE wall. This older structure also had a side wall to the W, and probably one to the E. Due to the overlaying later structure Y, the /. of the W transverse wall cannot be determined and the existence of the E one cannot be verified. It is, however, extremely likely that this is a rectangular structure, namely an Ar grave enclosure. It is a candidate for the original location of the marble sculptures found in 2002, as is a similar structure 5m further NW (U. Knigge,^M98 [1983], 50, fig. If). The later structure built over the NE long wall of the Ar grave enclosure is a sacred building erected in the context of the 1st phase of the Sacred Gate. It went out of use and was built over by the 3rd phase. It contained a bothros of 0.7m di. built of field stones from which were recovered animal bones, pottery and lamps dating to the period between the E 5th Ct and the 2nd half of the 5th Ct. Due to the fact that two internal transverse walls were added later at a distance of 1.5m, it appears likely that the structure had always been roofed and represented a single-roomed oikos. Parallel to the oikos and only 1.3m away is another structure; its frontage to the Sacred Way almost entirely consists of door opening, w. 2.55m. Whether this structure is in a functional context with the oikos remains unclear, since only a small part of it could be excavated, due to the construction of Rom pottery kilns above it. The exploration of the sanctuary near the S?dh?gel (the S tumulus; for the sanctuary see U. Knigge, The Athenian Kerameikos: History - Monuments ? Excavations, Athens [1991], 103, fig. 165, no. 13), under the supervision of T. Mattern, aims to restudy unpublished excavations that took place here in 1870 and 1910 and to clarify the chronology of the complex. After the removal of a mod. terracing layer from the anc. structures, some remains of stratigraphy spared by the older excavations could be examined. Three building phases of the 5th and 4th Cts, as well as changes to the entrance, could be determined.' Votanikos, W of Kerameikos/Iera Odos. Kathimerini (21/01/2006) and Ta Nea (23/01/2006) report on further bio archaeological and DNA analysis of bodies from a Cl mass grave found in the course of the construction of the Kerameikos/Votanikos metro station at the junction of O. Peiraios and the lera Odos in 1994-1995. One hundred and fifty bodies of all ages and sexes were discovered, with few, if any, grave goods, and were interpreted as being victims of the 'plague' of 430-426 BC. Samples have been taken from the teeth for DNA analysis, in the hope of identifying the disease more precisely. T. Kokkoliou (ADelt, 74) notes a funerary per?bolos, h. Ivc?, requiring further investigation at O. Mykalis 17. This may be connected to funerary monuments along the lera Odos (Sacred Way), more evidence for which has been recovered by Th. Iliopoulos nearby at O. Artemisiou 3 (ADelt, 14-11). Two major phases of this 10m stretch of lera Odos were identified. The earlier, road I (w. 3.7m) is represented by twelve sub phases/layers ca 0.7m thick, representing successive refurbish ments of the road, dating from LAr to ERom times. The orientation of the road was subsequently changed slightly in ERom times towards the N, the surface being refurbished seven times. Built into the later ERom retaining wall were five Hel funerary kioniskoi and the roof of a Cl/Hel funerary naiskos. The kioniskoi are inscribed as follows: Xwo-iUl?ioc/^cuO'iKpaTOVc/MeXnevc (A 4841) Aiovvmo?/Aiovvo-iov/Tleipaiev? (A 4840) NiKia?/Aiovv&lt;nov/A&lt;t)iBvaio?

Kavvadias (ADelt, 77-80) reports on excavations at the junction of O. Geraniou and O. Agiou Konstantinou. During clearing, five inscribed Hel/ERom kioniskoi in Hymettan marble, already published by A. Rousopolo (AE [1862], 187, nos 188-97) and in IG II2 (nos 7505, 8710, 8596, 8679 and 11734) but thought lost, were re discovered. Further excavation revealed an extensive Hel/ERom (2nd Ct BC to 2nd Ct AD) cemetery of 141 graves. The burials (139 inhumations) were all in trenches, some covered with stones, others with tile. Sparse grave goods include the usual ceramic and glass perfume flasks. Of the two cremations in cinerary urns, one had a small fragment of cloth and an inscribed gem (intaglio?) depicting a woman holding a pyxis. Other finds from the cremations include fragments of gold crowns and iron strigils. A LCI funerary stele and L 4th Ct BC kioniskos in Hymettan marble were re-used.

Five road phases could be distinguished, the lowest showing cart tracks. Later phases had retaining walls. Eighteen LCI graves of various types (tile, trench, pyres, one enchytrismos, three sarcophagi) contained finds (kantharoi, lekythoi) of the 4th Ct BC. Residual pottery dated from the 5thCt BC to mod. times. Eleusis. K. Papangeli (ADelt, 82-91) reports on rescue excavation in twenty locations. At O. Sarafi 21 (Peppa plot), a 12.1m stretch of an anc. road (w. 4m) was revealed. The earliest phases of both road surface and retaining wall date to the Ar period, the latest to the LHel/ERom periods. Residual pottery dates from Geo times. Finds include a Hel funerary kioniskos inscribed APXn/2KPA3&gt;I2/AEPKTAIA0T/rTNH At O. K.

Rega Pheraiou 12 (Papalexopoulou plot) a retaining wall for another anc. road were revealed. As well as some 7th Ct walls and associated pottery, further evidence of the extensive PH to Rom 'W cemetery' were revealed, principally along the course of the O. Iroon Polytechneiou (Peppa plot and elsewhere). One LH trench, and two LH (LH III A-B) chamber tombs yielded a Phi figurine and painted pottery (including an amphoriskos). Forty eight Cl (principally 5th Ct BC) graves comprised sixteen cremations in trenches, two 'pyres', one cremation in a bronze lebes (Fig. 23), ten infant enchytrismoi, the rest being inhumations (six sarcophagi, three tile graves, eight trenches). The 63 Rom LRom graves, all inhumations, comprised nineteen tile, thirteen cist, thirteen trench and two enchytrismoi. Two further LRom trench inhumations were found at O. Ploutonos, one with a bronze coin of Constantine the Great, and some Hel walls (from houses?). Indications of very E activity here took the form of EH pottery and obsidian associated with walls, and what may be part of an EH III/MH I tumulus (finds include a jug). Other possible PH finds were uncovered at the junct. of O. Salaminos and Charilaou, and EH sherds and levels at the junction of O. Ethnikis Anastaseos and Triptolemou. Elsewhere in the town, small tests revealed two (Rom) tile graves at O. Milisi, a Rom sewer and anc. road at O. Perikleous, two Ar graves at O. Karaskiaki, two Rom-LRom graves (one ceramic beehive) at the junction of O. Karaiskiaki and Iakchou, and at O. Kougioumtzoglou the foundations of the Rom acqueduct. The acquisition, from O.

A CL/EHel (4th/3rd Ct BC) hows stone inscribed 0P02 OAOT may indicate that this is the route of the road from Maroneia to Panormos, mentioned in the Poletai inscriptions. Excavation revealed at least one structure (with two rooms) of a LCl/EHel settlement, near to which was a smelting furnace and a deposit of broken pottery (including black-glaze and Megarian bowls), iron and lead objects. This seems to represent a destruction horizon of the 1st Ct BC. An associated cemetery of 84 trench graves, 39 with grave goods, dates principally to the LHel and Rom periods, though Ar and Cl graves have also been found in the vicinity. Thorikos. Robert Laffineur (University of Li?ge), Alain De Wulf (University of Gent) and Marc Hennau (Belgian School) report on the 2005 field season: 'Foreseeing the resumption of the excavations in the Myc sector of the acropolis of Velatouri in Thorikos by the Belgian School of Athens, a short preliminary campaign took place under the direction of Robert Laffineur. This campaign aimed to complete ? with the additional realization of a numeric three-dimensional model of the area ? the 1st part of the topographical map of Velatouri. The zone under investi gation includes the necropolis sited between the two hills and on the low slopes of the small Velatouri. The remains unearthed at the end of the 19th Ct and after the beginning of the excavations of the Belgian mission in 1963 (tombs I, II, IV and V) have also been included in the survey, so as to be integrated within the numeric model of the area as well as within the planned GIS (Geographical Information System) of the site of Thorikos. The measurements were taken with the collaboration of Alain De Wulf, assisted by Marc Hennau. The topographic survey was integrated into a global system of reference, in this case the system of UTM35 coordinates using some high precision GPS measurements. The investigated area covers 5,500m2, the number of measured points is 1,750. The precision was in the order of 1cm to 3cm. Eleven topographic points have been used on the land, six new points have been created using stems of steel and five points of the macro-grid of the site have been created using small beams of concrete. Fourteen station points were necessary for the survey. 24. Marathon: cist grave</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 13 Measurements with the total station have not been taken in some parts of the investigated zone because of the presence of excessive vegetation. These parts cannot be integrated into the numeric model of the area until we carry out a complete removal of the vegetation, scheduled for the beginning of the 2006 campaign. The collected data, in the coming months, will be processed by computer, using specialized software. This treatment will be done by the Laboratory of Informaties and Multimedia for the History of Art and Archaeology of Ancient Greece (LIMA) of the University of Li?ge. The numeric model must be completed in 2006 and 2007 by surveys of the area surrounding the larger hill of Velatouri in order to cover the whole zone of the probable extension of the Myc occupation of the site. The 2005 campaign also gave us the opportunity to conduct systematic surveys of the investigated zone which revealed, at the end of the campaign, a number of important topographical features. These findings have allowed us to propose the identification of supplementary tombs of the anc Myc epoch: (a) a portion of a structure, possibly related to a circular per?bolos wall, immediately S W of the per?bolos of tomb V; (b) the remains of a possible funerary enclosure, to the SW of chamber tomb II; (c) a portion of a circular per?bolos wall and what may be the entrance to a dromos, to the SW of the 'bothros' discovered by V. Stais at the end of the 19th Ct; (d) a possible entrance to a dromos to the S of tomb II. The precise nature and function of these elements may be confirmed by limited trenches, which are to be opened in 2006.' Kouvara-Peta area. O.

A small LNeo-EMyc settlement (fortified in its latest phase) at the hill of Psilokorifl (Vourvatsi-Kitsi-Thiti Makrya Pefka) and another settlement, with MH and LH pottery, a LH structure with two rooms at Lumbres (Mouriki plot) were explored. At Lambrika (Bokia plot) a small EH settlement was located. Nearby at the Patrona plot a Geo (L 9th-8th Ct BC) cemetery yielded twelve graves (two cist, eight trench, two enchytrismoi), the majority of adult graves being inurned cremations. Finds include MGeo and LGeo painted pottery (neck- and shoulder-handled amphorae used as urns, skyphoi, kantharoi, horse-pyxides, etc), spindle whorls, a bronze phiale and fibula and iron objects. At the Tsilmangkou plot, a LCI (4th Ct BC) structure with four rooms yielded some lekanes and rf pottery. In the vicinity of Koropi, a Cl and LRom farmstead at Liotrivi and a Hel farmstead at Patima were investigated as part of work on the Attiki Odos. Two Cl/Hel underground water channels on either side of the hill of Bourboutsana seem to belong to the separate anc. demes of Sphittos and Oas. At Chalidou-Karellas a possible spring house with Ar and Cl sherds, another Cl/Hel water channel (perhaps associated with the anc. deme of Kikynna) and some LRom structures were investigated.

North-Central Attika (2nd EPCA; 1th EBA) Gerakas. M. Platonos-Giota (ADelt, 105-11) notes excavations in four locations, indicating activity from PH to ERom times. At Pigi O. Geraka 5-7 (Gavala plot) a Rom child's cist grave, residual LCI (4th Ct BC) to Rom pottery, Rom coins, residual PH lithics and a pit containing roof tiles, and nearby at O. Geraka 3-5 (Gouni plot) another cist grave, three enchytrismoi and walls belonging to a large Rom complex. Residual ProtoGeo, Geo, Or and Cl pottery, Cl loomweights, and an obsidian core indicate earlier activity. At O. Siphnou 19 (Kolyavara plot) five pyres, three trench graves and an enchytrismos yielded LGeo pottery, including amphorae and kantharoi. Residual ERom, Cl, Geo pottery and loomweights, and an obsidian blade, indicate earlier and later activity. At Stavros Geraka (anc. P aliene), at the junction of O. Philikis Etaireias and Zalongou (Roggiti-Giannakaki plot) further investigation of structures and an anc. road associated with the Sanctuary of Athena Pallenis took place (AR 49 [2002-2003], 11; 51 [2004-2005], 10). The find of three Attic tetradrachms inscribed A0E of the 425 issue provide a tpq for ashlar foundations (krepis) of a monumental Cl structure, previously thought to be an hypostyle hall (Odeion or Bouleuterion). This structure is now thought to be a propylon to the sanctuary itself. Associated Cl pottery (chiefly black glaze drinking and pouring vessels) is mixed with earlier finds (e.g., three winged Geo terracottas, a figurine head), lead objects, a piece of rock crystal and fragments of Cl marble sculpture. Later ERom walls, household pottery and loomweights seem to point to a domestic structure built over the Cl propylon, which in turn may provide a taq for the 'moving' of the temple to the Athenian Agora.

Agallopoulou (ADelt, 99-104) reports on the excavation of eighteen Hel-MRom graves belonging to the 'W Cemetery'. Tombs comprised six cist (graves 1-4, 8, 15), one pyre, four trenches with ceramic or stone covers (graves 5, 6, 9, 16), one child's grave in a ceramic beehive (gr. 11) and a funerary monument with two chambers. All burials were inhumations, apart from the pyre, some tombs containing multiple burials, gr. 8 having eight skulls. Grave goods include lamps, painted Hel lagynoi, one (from gr. 3) stamped ArraXov, ceramic and glass perfume flasks, a Hel female figurine from the pyre, and (from gr. 9) five silver 25.

Feiten (Austrian Institute/University of Salzburg) reports on the 2005 season of excavation and study: 'Work in 2005 concentrated on the two areas that had already been the main focus of activity in recent years. The aims of the current project are two-fold. Firstly (W complex), to clarify the architectural history and chronology of use of an architectural ensemble originally excavated by A. Furtw?ngler and G Welter at the W tip of Cape Kolonna. Secondly (S hill), to examine the sequence of MBA settlements in an area untouched by earlier excavations that is immediately adjacent to Welters' undocumented sounding in the PH town centre. In the W complex (Fig. 25) a Hel paving of spolia (9.39m asl) that covered the E room of the S building was removed, as was a mud-brick fill below it, to expose the floor of the most recent Cl phase of use. Below this floor, two further floor levels were noticed; the upper of these belongs to the phase when the whole structure was erected. The lower one predates the building and is probably associated with the pillar structure excavated in 2004. Below it was another former ground surface that covered a dense stone fill containing two Geo inhumation graves, one of which had been partially removed when the surface was created. Further gaps in the stone fill suggest that more graves existed originally and that some of them were indicated by vertical stone markers. The graves contained bronze finger and ear rings, as well as an iron pin with a spherical head and terminal disk of bone. The layer covering these graves contained mixed pottery, mainly of EMyc and EAr dates. The aim of work on the E building was the complete excavation of the building, which had been noted in 2004 to the E of the S building on a higher terrace. Its wall fabrics had suggested several building phases. After the removal of recent rubble, it became evident that the S part of the E building, built of well-cut polygonal poros blocks (E building I), predates the N part, which was excavated in 2004 and had</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 15 been built of unworked cobbles (E building II), and further that E building I was abandoned before the use phase of E building IL E building I contained a series of floors, some associated with E building II, some with building I itself, and some with an earlier structure. The W wall of that predecessor lay directly below that of E building I; its S wall runs obliquely and slightly N underneath that of the later structure. The floors contemporary with buildings I and II are characterized by a series of earthen pits; especially those associated with building II had been densely filled with symposium wares (skyphoi, platters, kraters) and cooking wares. Large fragments of rf column kraters from the 1st half of the 5th Ct, one of them showing Herakles seizing the tripod, are especially noteworthy. To the E, the E building was delimited by a terrace wall of large poros blocks, with a W face in front of a dense inner stone fill to the E. Below the level of the lowest floor associated with E building I, under its N part, a disturbed inhumation with no grave goods was discovered. It probably belongs to the same context as the Geo burials in the S building; its higher elevation is due to the terrain. At the same level, the uppermost remains of the PH settlement came to light, as indicated by a series of E-W walls. Associated pottery dates them to the EMyc (N area) and MBA (S area) periods. A street was discovered abutting E building I directly to the S of its S wall. Oriented E-W, and sloping upwards to the E, it is 3m wide, and consists of a continuous sequence of gravel layers trampled to cement-like hardness. It appears to have been in use from Ar to Byz times. It should be seen in context with the S street excavated in 2003, and the E street excavated in 2004 between E building I/II and the S building. On its S edge it is bounded by a casually laid E-W running row of large square blocks. Building technique and ceramics suggest that this is part of an enceinte wall (diateichisma?) from the Pergamene period that had already been noted in the 1970s to the W below the propylon. A very worn threshold block in the area where the roads join suggests that there may have been a gate to the acropolis here. Excavations took place in squares Q2, Q5, Q6 and especially Q3 of the S hill. In squares Q2 and Q5 the remains of PH house walls were exposed just below the surface level. They belong to buildings partially excavated in 2002 and 2003. A 1st rough study of the finds suggests a date in a L phase of the MBA or the transition to the LBA. The walls are disturbed by several LRom/Byz pits. A deep sounding in Q6 had already reached strata from the transition of the EBA to the MBA (EH III/MH) in 2004. The 2005 excavation aimed to reach secure EH III levels here. After the removal of a little material, a definite EH III floor level was reached and excavation in the area was temporarily halted. Below the bottom of pit I (excavated 2003), the continu ation of the 2nd phase of the Gro?steinbau (building of large stones) was discovered. The stratigraphy indicates that this building, erected in the MBA, was used until the beginning of the LBA. To determine the full N-S extent of the Gro?steinbau, square Q6 had to be extended. In the process, remains of a roughly N-S oriented wall of cut blocks were found. This could be a t?menos wall, separating the two LCl/Hel Quaderbauten (buildings of cut blocks), the altar and the circular structure from the rest of the sanctuary on the acropolis of Aigina. Directly under the possibly t?menos lay the continuation of the Gro?steinbau. Thus, its N-S extent is definitely 30m or more. It is planned to explore the t?menos wall and Gro?steinbau further in the coming years. In square Q3, the access area below the pottery kiln and the area immediately in front of the W Quaderbau were examined. The excavations near the kiln confirmed the dating of its construction in LH IIIA. Walls of the MBA Gro?steinbau were noted immediately below the kiln. The area in front of the Quaderbau had been partially destroyed by Welter's excavations. In the previously unexcavated section, a series of former MBA surface levels was observed. High quality pottery found here included a fully preserved painted M jar (Fig. 26) and fragments of fine wares. A pit, partially cut by Welters' excavations, contained high quality MBA pottery and two cylindrical seals which have no parallels whatsoever in the Aegean area. They depict humans and animals (probably scorpions and goats). Macroscopic analysis suggests that the clay is local. The two seals and their association with the Gro?steinbau may indicate administrative structures so far known only from M Crete. In summary, the Gro?steinbau, its size (as known so far) and the two seals corroborate the great importance of Aigina Kolonna in the MBA.' Q3/181-5 26. Aigina Kolonna: M jar Elsewhere on Aigina. E.

Berit Wells (former director, Swedish Institute) reports on the 2005 season of excavation and study at the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Kalaureia (Fig. 27): 'The investigation of the area of building D in the Sanctuary of Poseidon, was continued for three weeks in 2005. The main objectives were to define the sequence of Ar walls (walls 06, 02/07 and 30/32) in the W part of the area, and to finalize the excavation of the Ar cistern (feature 03) defined in 2004 (AR [2004-2005], 12-13, figs. 20-21). Some cleaning was also done in the SE part of the complex (area D18), E of what we now consider to be the main entrance to it. The Ar cistern (feature 03) in the NW was excavated to a depth of ca 3m from the surface. The pottery found in the fill dates it to after ca 50 BC. The most significant finds are the animal bones, which clearly suggest that the filling of the cistern was connected to a ritual involving a chthonic deity. The inclination of its walls indicates that the cistern either widens at the level reached or that it is connected to other similar cisterns through subterranean channels. The excavation of the cistern was abandoned due both to time constraints and to the fact that its W wall has eroded to such an extent that it was deemed dangerous to excavate deeper. The cistern has now been backfilled in order to prevent it, and wall 02 above it, from collapsing. An altar (feature 05) dated to the 6th Ct BC and remnants of the earliest Ar terrace wall (wall 30) in the sanctuary had previously been defined immediately to the W of building D (Fig. 28). The objective of continued excavation in the area was to investigate further the architectural structures. The stratigraphy indicates that both the altar and the wall date to the 1st half of the 6th Ct BC. Roof tiles found incorporated into the wall prove the existence of tiled structures at Kalaureia at this E date. The structures are yet to be located, however. The altar remained in use through the LCI and Hel periods. Wall 30 which takes a sharp turn towards the NW and disappears underneath building E, the entrance building of the sanctuary, was replaced by new terrace walls (walls 02 and 07) around 500 BC. The finds associated with the altar include a miniature lamp, a miniature loomweight and a piece of folded gold band. In areas D13, D15 and D17 excavations were carried out in what was previously considered a stoa in front of building D. We were able to verify that the mid-6th Ct BC terrace wall 30 continues as wall 32 but is thereafter lost where bedrock rises towards the E. Further, wall 06, of slightly later date than wall 30/32, clearly terminates by area D13 and, therefore, there is here no evidence of a continuous wall, which could be considered the front wall of a stoa. In area D18 the geophysical survey of 2004 had indicated the existence of a burnt, circular structure. The investigation here was conclusive, as the stoking channel of a kiln was found underneath thick accumulations of mod. terracing fill. Associated with the kiln were two kiln supports of a type suitable for stacking roof tiles and a small amount of pottery datable to the LBA and EIA. The kiln can most likely be dated to LAr times, a period which seems to be the earliest major construction phase at the sanctuary.</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 17 28. Poros, Kalaureia: area W of building D Finally, in area D18 random blocks and rubble were removed, which had been collected there in recent times. The only excavated stratum in the area produced finds ranging in date from the LCI to the L Antique periods. The ground slopes gently in the area and the material has obviously eroded down from further up in the building. The excavations in the area of building D have shown that prior to the construction of the building in the L 4th Ct BC, the area was terraced 1st around the M 6th Ct BC (wall 30/32) and again around 500 BC (wall 02/07). The terrace walls seem to constitute parts of extensive wall systems, constructed in order to define and redefine the area of the sanctuary. The decades around 500 BC then saw the 1st major construction phase of the sanctuary: the Temple of Poseidon with its per?bolos as well as some features recovered in the renewed excavations, such as a potter's kiln and cisterns, or possibly a whole system of cisterns, connected through subterranean channels, can be dated to this period. A major discovery concerning the design of the L 4th Ct BC structure is the recovery of the staircase in the SE, W of area D18. This is possibly the main entrance to the building complex. Its location puts a new emphasis on the altar (lying somewhat to the N) found in the same area in 1999. The fact that the building was entered from outside the sanctuary proper may be of consequence for the interpretation of the character of the cult inside the building.' Kythera C. Broodbank (UCL) and E. Kiriatzi (BSA) report on a further season of study of finds from the Kythera Island Project (KIP): 'During 2005, the Kythera Island Project undertook a long study season concentrating on ceramic and metallurgical finds from the field survey. After the examination of the finds from a number of inland sites in previous years, Cyprian Broodbank, Vangelio Kiriatzi, Alan Johnston and Joanita Vroom focused on the study of pottery from a small number of large and very rich sites on the coast. Concerning both the BA and the Cl period, a contrasting pattern is emerging between the small and dispersed inland sites, characterized almost exclusively by coarse wares, obviously production-oriented, and the large coastal sites around Kastri, rich in fine decorated, but also imported, pottery, mainly consumption-oriented. Apart from the ceramic and metal analysis undertaken by the Fitch Laboratory, Thilo Rehren and Tonia Zianni (UCL), established the presence of copper ingots in a LMIA or LMIA/B transi tional context, probably comprising the earliest Neopalatial ingots identified in the Aegean. Concerning geoarchaeological research, particularly exciting results have been obtained for the Skafidi core, mainly due to the preservation of pollen (currently being studied by Margaret Atherden), and a suite of new radiocarbon dates expanding from the LNeo to the MByz periods. So, a fine grained chronology is provided for the changes observed both in the vegetation and the catchment's sedimentation history, based on stratigraphie and laboratory analyses of the Skafidi core sequence by Nancy Krachtopoulou.' Antikythera. Kathimerini (06/07/2005) reports on plans to turn the anc. acropolis of Aigila into an archaeological park. A. Bevan (UCL), J. Connolly (Trent University/Canadian Institute) and A. Tsarovopoulos (26th EPCA) report on the 1st survey season of the Antikythera Survey Project (ASP) in 2005 (Fig. 29): * 'As one of the smallest inhabited islands in Greece and the Mediterranean (ca 20km in extent), Antikythera has experienced a particularly eventful and interesting history of human exploita tion and settlement, including a substantial, but until now undefined, PH presence, a fortified settlement of Hel pirates, a large LRom/EByz community and a period of more recent re colonization. We are interested in all periods of activity on the island, but have a particular focus on episodes of colonization, abandonment, piracy, monasticism and seasonal exploitation, all of which seem to have been important local phenomena. In 2005, we concentrated on the systematic survey of surface archaeology and covered about two-thirds of the island, in ca 2,300 tract units. We were particularly careful to strike a balance between making our collection strategies and results comparable with those from other surveys by building upon well-established tract-walking methods, and introducing new techniques (e.g., high resolution satellite imagery) where we felt these enhanced the spatial resolution of the information we retrieved. About 54,000 sherds were counted and, of these, almost 7,000 diagnostic ceramics were collected for later study, along with some 760 lithics including both local worked chert and obsidian (Fig. 30). In the absence of a well-stratified and excavated multi period deposit on the island, a carefully developed fabric sequence will be a crucial component of the next two years' work. The relatively well-known material from neighbouring regions (Kythera, W Crete, S P?loponn?se), as well as the high quality of the fabric-based analysis already done elsewhere in the SW Aegean, offers us an unusual opportunity to build such a sequence comparatively and to explore just how far such distinctions can be made from survey material alone. We have material from the LNeo (provisionally defined thus far only on lithic evidence), BA, Hel and LRom/EByz periods, as well as a significant amount of surface ceramics from the mod. period of re-occupation (L 18th Ct to present). There are gaps in the chronological distribution that require much further examination in order to determine whether they are real or products of archaeological visibility. We are not yet in a position to estimate how many other such sites occur within the surveyed area, or their precise extent, as they require additional study to identify conclusively, but there appear to be over 20 PH sites across the island, and perhaps the same number again for the Hel and LRom/EByz periods. In addition to our 1st stage tract-walking strategy, we also collected two newly identified PH artefact concentrations more intensively in order to ground-test the 2nd stage investigative methods that we propose to use more fully next season. These comprised a scatter of worked, locally available white chert and a BA scatter which included Neopalatial material.

Two further rooms, with clear doorways, were investigated, one bordering onto the apsidal end of what may be a large hall. Finds include marble columns and capitals, of various marble types, and bronze coins of the 2nd to 4"1 Cts AD. Isthmia. E. Gebhard (ASCSA/University of Chicago) reports on the 2005 study season at the Sanctuary of Poseidon: ' Alastar Jackson and Irena Marszalek continued study of the arms and armour. Over 44 separate shields were identified among the debris from the Ar Temple of Poseidon, that was destroyed by fire in ca 450 BC. Included was a replica of an almost full-size bronze hoplite shield, which perhaps belonged to a statue or served as architectural decoration. Weapons from the hero shrine ( W foundation) along the Corinth road W of the sanctuary were drawn and studied with attention to Cor and Macedonian parallels. In the sanctuary, projectile points that clustered around the E gate and NW t?menos may date to the attack of Agesilaus in 390 BC or to the Rom raid in 198 BC, or even to military events in 146 BC. Martha Risser continued her analysis of vases recovered from the reservoir (great circular pit) serving the dining area during the Ar and EC1 periods. Similarities among the drinking vessels suggest that a few specialized, local workshops may have produced dining pottery for the sanctuary, perhaps under some type of agreement, or the cups and kotylai could have been purchased in sets for use at the sanctuary. The Attic wares appear also to have come from a selected group of workshops, and some vessels could have been shipped at the same time. Kraters, previously thought to be in short supply, were identified, along with plain and coarse ware bowls that could have been used for mixing wine. The holes in the centre of a few kotylai/skyphoi may reflect their use in ritual. Much of the material clusters around the 2nd quarter and M 5th Ct BC. It thus seems likely that the reservoir was filled with debris after the temple fire of ca 450 BC, a suggestion supported by the metal objects from the same context. Of the drinking vessels, 52.5% 30. Antikythera: white chert and obsidian</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 19 by weight may belong to the period ca 550-450 BC; 41.6% must be post-550 BC, with 3.8 % from earlier periods. The imported drinking vessels form 2.2% of the assemblage and all were made after ca 550 BC. Virginia Anderson-Stojanovic and Jonathan Stevens completed their description of the architecture of the N building and houses I-XXI on the Rachi Settlement. Study of the character of rooms and courtyards confirmed the presence of oil production, bee-keeping and activities associated with daily living. The site plan was up-dated and work began on an actual state plan of each house, with reconstructions and sections to accompany tables of objects. Nikolaos Didaskalos and Anastasios Papaioannou undertook conservation work on vats, water tanks, floors of olive presses, tubs, house floors, drains and numerous cisterns, that had deteriorated since excavation. After the retirement of David Mitten from the Isthmia project, Arne Thomsen has undertaken study of the terracotta figurines for the Isthmia publications. He devoted his initial season to updating the documentation. Twenty two objects were added to the catalogue. John Hayes made drawings of the LHel and Rom ceramics. Study of the worked stone by Ivan Gatsov and Petranka Nadelzheva continued. Grinding equipment for food production predominated. The saddle querns, hopper mills, grinding slabs, pestles and rotary querns came, for the most part, from mixed fills containing material predominately of the Cl and EHel periods. The location of most deposits close to the Temple of Poseidon suggests that in the Ar and Cl periods food was prepared in the vicinity. The dining area appears to have lain SW of the t?menos. Tools included ten masons' floats used in smoothing the stuccoed surface of the Cl temple; four game boards will have provided entertainment.' Tim Gregory (University of Ohio) reports on study of material from outside the sanctuary at Isthmia: 'Study of the Rom baths continued. Panayiotis Elias continued the task of preserving the monochrome mosaic in room VI of the Rom baths. Conservation and stabilization of this unique work of anc. art was completed in 2004. Since no protective structure has been placed over the mosaic, however, only temporary measures can be carried out for its long-term protection. In 2005 the completely destroyed surface of the patternless, white mosaic in room XII was removed, and the process of relaying this mosaic will begin in 2006. Work was begun again in the study of the so-called E field, located between the Temple of Poseidon and the Byz fortress, and partially excavated between 1970 and 1972. This new phase of research is being carried out by Steven Ellis (University of Michigan). The area of the E field is characterized by the remains of buildings of Rom and LRom date, close to the presumed road that ran between the Hel stadium and the entrance to the Sanctuary of Poseidon. The excavators exposed a complex of structures in this area, apparently constructed in several phases, whose use is currently uncertain. Some of the buildings may have been of a monumental character, but most of the spaces are small and they seem to suggest a more humble use; previous publications suggested that this was a residential area of some kind. The goal of the 1st part of this new campaign in the E field is to establish a general phase plan of the site, and to determine the boundaries of individual buildings and their relative chronology. It should then be possible to add further information on the character of each building and/or phase, such as the activities that were carried out at each, and how the area might have related to the surrounding sanctuary. Considerable work was accomplished in 2005, a tentative phase plan was constructed, focusing on the N and E areas, and arrangements were made for the continuation of this work in 2006. Cleaning the edge of the S boundary of the excavated area of the Rom bath continued, the aim being to stabilize the earth and even out this line, which has been eroding seriously since it was exposed in the 1970s. Considerable progress was made, both in the cleaning of the scarp and in construction of the dry stone retaining wall that now runs for a distance of some 30m, well over half way across the S side of the building. In addition, along the line of the S wall of the room along the S side of the Cl bath, another set of doorways was discovered, to match those found in 2004. These show that there were at least six entrances into the Cl bath, allowing access into the complex from the direction of the Temple of Poseidon. Two walls running S from the main S wall of the Rom bath were also examined carefully and they can now be seen to have formed part of the original construction ofthat structure, suggesting the existence of further monumental architecture in the area to the S of the bath.' K. Skarmoutsou-Demetropoulou (ADelt, 289-90) reports on the clearing of the area around the Justinianic ramparts. The line of the ramparts and parts of three towers (Fig. 31) came to light. 31. Isthmia: foundation of Byz tower Kenchreai. J.L. Rife (Macalester College) reports on further study of material from the Rom cemetery on the Koutsongila ridge: ' The cemetery consists of 29 subterranean chamber tombs and 26 individual cist graves cut into the bedrock along the E slope of the Koutsongila ridge over an area of ca 220m N-S by 60m E-W. Field research this season involved further work on the topographical plan of the site; close inspection of the natural terrain; the exploration of two tombs; the construction of a roof over one tomb as a protective measure; the study of wall painting and mortar; the study of artefacts recovered by E and recent Gr and American researchers; and the study of human and animal bones. Chris Mundigler (University of Victoria) supervised work on a composite topographical plan of the site. The plan shows that the major phases of occupation at the site were primarily Rom Empire through to L Antiquity, with secondary phases in the Ar-Cl and Byz eras. The cemetery was located on the N edge of the dense civic settlement, which was centred on the harbour some 100m to the S. In documenting traces of looting, we found that only sparse clandestine excavation had occurred since 2004. One freshly opened chamber tomb (T28) was recorded on the N property of the ridge.</page><page sequence="20">20 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. The examination of the natural landscape by Rick Dunn (Norwich University) refined the understanding of local geology and morphology that he developed in 2004. Natural and artificial features in the coastal environment indicate clearly that the Rom coastline was ca 25-30m offshore from its current position. It appears that long, parallel indentations on a rocky promontory on the SE corner of the ridge represent an anc. carriage road that followed the shore and terminated at the N mole of the harbour. Our exploration of the chamber tombs continued under the supervision of Tom Tartaron (Yale University). We focused on two well-preserved but disturbed tombs. One of these (T13) had a canonical plan (Fig. 32), but the other (T22) displayed an unusual configuration of burial, with only niches for cinerary urns along the walls and three cists constructed in the floor. Close study of the contents of these tombs produced more evidence for ritual activities, particularly the deposition of numerous vessels and lamps during the funeral, funerary banquets and commemorative visits. We also developed a clearer picture of the depositional history of the entrance passages (dromoi) and chambers. After decades of intensive use, the tombs were abandoned and gradually infiltrated by fine sediments, after which point they were filled with massive structural debris collapsing from the surface, apparently in a catastrophic event, such as an earthquake. This debris included several fragments of architectural moulding in limestone, showing that the superstructure of the tomb buildings above the dromoi had a simple ornamental appearance. 32. Kenchreai: Rom tomb The study of wall-painting in the cemetery continued this year, under the general direction of Alix Barbet (?cole normale sup?riere/CNRS, Paris). This concentrated on documenting the fragmentary remains of painting with simple motifs and straightforward organization in two tombs (T9, T20). The quality and colours of these two decorative programmes diverge significantly from that in tomb 4, the best painted tomb on Koutsongila. This discrepancy points to a degree of variability in not only the parietal decoration but presumably also the wealth, status, and interests of different families using the cemetery. A corollary to the study of the wall-painting is a detailed study of the mortar used to finish the tomb walls for painted plaster. The chief preliminary observation is that the composition and application of mortar varied greatly from tomb to tomb, a technical diversity that mirrors the variation in painted decoration. We plan to analyze samples of mortar and painted plaster in order to identify, through scientific techniques, the chemical and structural composition of these essential building materials. Our team completed the emergency conservation of the lavish wall-painting in tomb 4 in 2003 and 2004, but we remain concerned about the protection of the tomb from environmental damage. Therefore, we designed and erected a movable roof with a low gable on a wooden frame over the entire surface area of the tomb entrance, chamber and loculi. This will shed water from the area of the tomb and prevent moisture from seeping through the bedrock and into the anc. mortar and painted plaster on the tomb walls. The most important component of the 2005 campaign was the study of finds from activities at at the site in 1956, 1962 1969, 1988-1990 and more recently, supervised by Melissa Morison (Grand Valley State University). Professor Morison has identified and catalogued a large quantity of material, particularly vessels, lamps and small finds from funerary deposits. Among other noteworthy finds was a primitive funerary bust with parallels in the Near E and epitaphs that echo formulae commonly found at Corinth (Fig. 33). The many achievements of this study include a clearer under standing of the chronological limits of the cemetery's initial phase of use (E lst-M 3 Ct AD); its secondary use in LRom and Byz times for burial and temporary occupation; the functional range of vessels used in funerary ritual (Fig. 34); the distribution of local versus imported products; and the relationship between the Cenchrean and Cori ceramic assemblages. Twenty three coins were identified, most of which are Rom and Gr Imperial issues (Fig. 35). The study of the human and animal bones also began in 2005 under the direction of, respectively, Douglas H. Ubelaker (Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institute) and David Reese (Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale University). Dr Ubelaker studied fragmentary skeletal remains from five tombs and seven graves, including several discrete deposits of cremated bone. His preliminary observa tions shed light on the process of cremation at ERom Kenchreai: corpses were subjected to intense, sustained heat (over 800?C) to much of the body, after which point mourners extracted a selection of cremated bone from the pyre for deposition in urns.

The study of animal bones has so far not yielded decisive evidence for animal sacrifice as a funerary ritual. Dr Reese has, however, identified a fascinating collection of marine and terrestrial species in the copious food debris from one tomb (T22). These faunal remains point to the diverse diet and subsistence strategies of local residents during the Byz and E mod. eras.' Lechaion. P. Velissariou (ASA) reports on further study and conservation from the LRom/ECh basilica (Ergon, 66-68).

Eleftherotypia (12/10/05) and Kathimerini (11/10/05) report on an exhibition, at the new Corinth railway station, of finds recovered through rescue excavation along the railway line N of Corinth. Finds include part of the long walls to Lechaion, and finds from Geo, Ar, Cl and Rom graves from the N cemetery of anc. Corinth. Special mention is made of an Ar grave in a stone sarcophagus, and an MGeo belly-handled amphora, an MGeo trefoil oinochoe and LGeo skyphoi are illustrated. Anc. Corinth. P. Kasimi (ADelt, 148) reports on test excavations at Anapnoa (Papada plot). Apart from tracing anc. streambeads, the only find was an anc. corbelled structure found in 1998. Guy Sanders (ASCSA) reports on the 2005 season in the Panayia field: 'Excavation focused on two areas: in the vicinity of the E and MGeo tombs excavated between 2002 and 2004; and in the N rooms of the L Rom domus. In the 1st area, the LNeo to EBA alluvial layer was thoroughly examined and tested. No more graves remain to be excavated. A well SE of Geo grave 2002-11 was found to have been filled with re-deposited Hel material in the 1st Ct AD. The fill contained significant quantities of coarse, cooking and fine wares from a fairly homogeneous primary deposit or deposits. The pottery includes fragments of three different Falaieff kraters, a variety of black-glaze table ware forms decorated in the W slope style, a bolster krater with painted decoration on one side and incised decoration on the other side and a very large coarse kantharos. With the exception of two Rom sherds, one deep within the well, none of the material appears to date after the 3rd quarter of the 3rd Ct BC. Earlier material in the fill includes part of a terracotta altar and various figurines. These tend to corroborate the conclusion drawn from the scant Ar and Cl deposits excavated in earlier seasons that some form of religious activity, perhaps in connection with the Geo graves, took place in the area. A 20% sample of the well's fill was retained for water sieving; it contained olive pits, fish scales and other organics. The main focus of excavation took place on the N side of the L Rom domus (Fig. 36) where Rom construction fills were removed. NW of the long concrete pool an ERom wall incor porated a small Ar or Cl sarcophagus. A dumped fill bounded by this wall to the N contained a large volume of monochrome wall-painting and significant quantities of MGeo pottery. The pottery and sarcophagus suggest that there are more E burials to be excavated in the area. Parts of two walls, built of carefully laid, dressed limestone blocks, meet at a corner of a room and belong to a substantial Hel building. Perhaps associated with this building is a large cistern (Fig. 37), 3.4m by 2.2m preserved to a depth of about 1.5m, with hydraulic cement lining the interior. A monolithic limestone beam, supported in the middle by an orthostate, spans the entire w. of the cistern at the mid-point. This feature is similar to the arrangement of beams and posts in the double apsidal cistern at Perachora and suggests that here the beam supported a 2nd orthostate and that the cistern originally may have been as much as 3m deep. The cistern was accessed by a staircase at its SE corner.</page><page sequence="22">22 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. Early Roman Hellenistic unexcavated \a&lt; East-WestTerracftWjlL S.,=?*3S.

Corinth: Panayia field Excavation of a large Rom pit revealed the cover slabs of a sewer (Fig. 38) aligned with the Hel walls and cisterns. The sewer has built walls and is covered with complete, squared limestone blocks. The blocks, one preserving a cavetto moulding, derive from a large public building. The Rom pit appears originally to have been dug to access the sewer either for repair or to tap in a new waste-water line in the L 2nd or E 3th Ct AD. There is evidence for two more access holes. One is in the marble floor of the domus room with an octagonal pool 37. Corinth: cistern and the other is beneath the NW corner of the long concrete pool. At this stage it appears as if the sewer line was constructed within a tunnel rather than by digging a long linear trench from the surface. The N side of the domus was defined by an E-W terrace wall represented by partially preserved foundations and, otherwise, by a deep robbing trench. This wall is the N wall of an open space measuring 32.5m by 14m and containing a long concrete pool, with interior dimensions of 16.2m by 2.1m and 38. Corinth: cover slabs of Rom sewer</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 23 a maximum d. of 0.9m. The pool is lined with waterproof cement and originally had a low marble parapet surrounding it. Water to fill the pool was supplied by a lead pipe running under the floor of the room to the S from a pipe feeding water to the octagonal fountain in the marble room. The outflow channel runs W from a castellum built on the exterior of the cistern on the N side presumably to the Hel sewer line. Waste water from the castellum also fed an unexcavated well to the NE. The pool was constructed by excavating a large rectangular hole then building form work inside it. Concrete and rubble were poured to cover the floor of the hole and then between the form work and the excavated sides. On the S side, the concrete preserves the impressions of blocks from a pre-existing wall that was subsequently robbed out in the 6th Ct. On the N side, the unfinished surface of the concrete preserves the line of the ground surface when the pool was created. At the W end the pool was dug into a hole excavated to access the Hel sewer line and backfilled in the Rom period. After the cement was poured and set, and the pool was in use, the earth in the pit continued to settle with the result that the E end of the pool ultimately cracked and slumped into the pit. The fill of this pit is significant for dating the domus. Pottery within it dates to the L 3rd Ct AD and may go as late as the E 4th Ct AD. Previously the best indicator for the date of the construction of the domus was pottery and a coin of the 2nd half of the 3th Ct in well 1999-1 which was closed off when two of the main load bearing walls of the domus were constructed.'

Marchand (ASCSA) reports on the preliminary results of the 1st study season of the material picked up in the 2004 survey: 'The main result of the systematic study of the collected material from the site is that it confirms previously reported impressions about Dorati in terms of the quantity and quality of the material, the range of dates represented, and the relative quantities of material from each period and of diverse types present at the site. The counts of pottery in the following tables are provisional. We are confident that the counts do represent a general idea of the habitation phases, as well as deposition and erosion processes that are active on the site. The number of inventoried pottery from periods later than the BA confirms previous assertions that the site was not occupied after the end of the Myc period. A total of eight sherds were identified as dating from later periods. These include a ProtoGeo(?) krater rim, a possible Cor amphora body sherd, a 5th Ct AD cooking pot rim and three glazed E mod. body sherds. The Neo period is scarcely represented with examples of ENeo and LNeo pottery, while no MNeo pottery, for example the very popular Urfirnis pots, has been identified.

Jars, jugs, kraters and stirrup jars are also present. The whole range of Myc figurines, excluding group figurines, is represented. Notable is the find of a hollow animal figure. Additionally, three pieces have clear marks of reworking in order to be used as stoppers. At least two examples of cone shells used ornamentally were included. Murex shells predominate. The decoration of the pithoi we have inventoried varies considerably. Apart from the standard rope pattern, parallel horizontal lines of impressed dot rows, finger-dragged wavy lines and bands with slashes, there is one example with an elaborate ivy leaf in relief. Potters' marks appear on a number of Aeginetan cooking and fine vessels. Exciting new results include the identification of possible imports from Teichos Dymaion in Achaia, from as close as Aigina and as far away as the Cyclades, suggesting that Dorati's position was suitable for trade to the W and to the E. A body sherd from a MCyc closed vessel was identified as such by the fabric, dense inclusions of silver mica and the decoration. A number of rims and body sherds belong to shapes such as hydria CP 129 from Korakou in the Corinth collection, which, according to Rutter, is an import from Teichos Dymaion.' Kleonai T. Mattern (DAI, University of Marburg) reports: 'Activities this year concentrated on two contexts: the sanctuary on the lower acropolis (SI) and the so-called terrace building (S2). Our understanding of the 6th Ct BC phase of the sanctuary (AR 51 [2004-2005], 19) (Fig. 39) has improved, due to a clarification of the original slope of the terrain which had been altered by long-term activity. The massive 14.5m by 14m paving (1) had not been placed on the hill's summit. The summit (2) was to the W of the paving, and at least 0.5m higher. Thus, the paving represents a terrace built against the summit, which also explains the unusually strong sub-structures of its strip foundations. The summit was probably the true centre of the sanctuary. Associated with it is a further, E-W oriented, paving (3), at a slightly higher elevation than the aforemen tioned one. In the Cl period, the summit was further surrounded with steps in a U-shaped arrangement (4). The earlier suggestion that an altar delimited the terrace to the E has to be abandoned since no trace of an altar was found in 2005. A railing or balustrade might be envisaged instead. The exploration of the so-called terrace building, about 200m N of the sanctuary began in 2005 with general cleaning. Some initial small soundings indicate a large Hel(?) structure. Work here will continue in 2006.' Nemea.

None of the buildings and the monuments mentioned by him has been located. The aim of the five-year research programme of the Belgian School is: (a) to locate the Sanctuary of Asclepius and to establish the expansion of the city over time; (b) to produce a digital terrain model and a new topographic map of the site and its surrounding area; (c) to produce a series of digital relief</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 25 Kleonai 2002 - 05 , Heiligtum auf der.

Kleonai models and orthophoto maps of the acropolis and city wall in order to re-create a virtual reality model; and (d) to study the land use in the area surrounding the site. The archaeological survey carried out in October 2004 concentrated on the lowest SE area of the acropolis. This area had partly been explored and mapped by Meyer in 1937. We located the rectangular construction Meyer called a 'temple' (no less than 16.10m by 7.50m), aligned E-W and slightly diverted to the N. More walls and structures, completely covered with vegetation, can be seen in its immediate surroundings. Mod. agricultural activity has caused stone blocks and terracotta tile fragments to be scattered all over the field, just SE of the rectangular construction. We noticed in this area a concentration of, mostly, Rom and Byz sherds. Stone blocks lay discarded on the slope of the plateau and in the surrounding fields. They may have been part of the per?bolos mentioned by Pausanias. If our hypothesis is correct, we suppose the enclosure to follow the E and the SW border of the plateau. The structure that appears from a hole dug by looters could be an anc. well. We discovered a small stone quarry, an area of marshland (maybe a small anc. river?) and an area used by craftsmen. The following had already been mapped by Meyer: wheel-tracks indicating an anc. road and a path still in use half a Ct ago of which several sections survive. At this stage of the investigation there is no sufficient positive evidence to confirm that the area surveyed in 2004 is indeed the location of the Asklepieion. Cleaning of the area and trial trenches can, however, provide us with a better understanding of the function and use of the rectangular building (temple? porticus?) and of the other structures. In September 2005 the archaeological survey concentrated on the hill of the acropolis and on the plateau to the NW of it. This area had been entirely explored and mapped by Meyer in 1937. The part of the acropolis wall that survives corresponds almost exactly to the line plotted by Meyer. All vegetation was removed from the wall in order to carry out the photogram metry project and to facilitate the study and implementation of a preservation and consolidation programme. The N part of the city wall was partly cleaned and it was revealed to be far better preserved than shown on Meyer's map. More sections of the town wall survive in the area S of the acropolis. We located a large, rectangular Rom building, maybe a stoa (24m by 7.35m). The W end of this building figures on Meyer's map, as well as a row of stone blocks that appears to form a corner (11m by 2m). A Rom bathhouse was partly excavated by K. Krystalli Votsi (ADelt 30 [1975], Chr 59). An anc. well, a collapsed Rom building, a rock-cut tomb robbed by looters and an unidentified circular structure were also discovered. A trial trench was opened at the SW corner of the W tower of the acropolis wall. A compact layer of small irregular stones, collapsed from the upper levels of the wall, appeared just underneath the present surface, along the S side of the tower. Along the W side of it, a fill reached the rock, about 2m under the actual surface. The foundations of a Rom wall appeared along the furthest W side of the trial trench. The wall of the W tower is at this point built directly on to the rock. The topographical survey of the site was carried out in two distinct sections, due to the overgrown and almost inacces sible nature of the terrain. Both surveys were linked to the</page><page sequence="26">26 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. same reference system, the UTM34 co-ordinate system using high accuracy GPS phase measurements. The two sections of the survey are located on a longitudinal basis. The whole survey was carried out in polar co-ordinates. The different measurements were processed using Octopus Topo3 (? ITnG bvba - Temse). The equalization of the topographical network (convex polygon formed by all stationing points and materialized points) was computed using MOVE3 (? Grontmij Geogroep bv.). The assemblage of the different maps was achieved using Acad 2002 (? Autodesk Inc.). Survey area 1 re-groups the lower areas of the site; the survey was completed during the 2004 and 2005 campaigns. The survey was carried out using a combination of the conven tional and the free stationing method. Covered area: 56,000m2; measured points: 636 (2004) and 1,550 (2005); accuracy: 2-3cm (2004) and l-3cm (2005); materialized points: 25. This area was measured using 22 stationing points, eleven of which were computed using the free stationing method. The other eleven stationing points were located above a materialized point. Survey area 2 re-groups the upper areas of the site; the survey was carried out in 2005. Covered area: 24,000m2; measured points: 1,250; accuracy: l-3cm; materialized points: 14. This area was measured using eleven stationing points, three of which were computed using the free stationing method. The other eight stationing points were located above a materialized point. In 2005, a sub-set of the materialized points was measured with high accuracy differ ential Global Positioning System (GPS) phase receivers (LI) using our own reference station. With a stationing time of a minimum of twenty minutes, 27 materialized points of the topographical network located on site were measured. For control purposes, eight materialized points were measured two or more times to check the accuracy of the system and to ensure a correct absolute positioning of the surveys already undertaken. All processing of these differential phase data was performed using LGO 1.1 (? Leica Geosystems AG) software, providing relative accuracies in the order of 2-3cm in the UTM34 system. As part of the terrestrial photogrammetry study, the wall of the acropolis was recorded by photogrammetry in 2004. At that time it was completely covered with vegetation, therefore, only characteristic points on the wall itself were measured. In 2005 all the vegetation was removed in order to carry out the photogrammetry project. More than 120 materialized marks were put on the wall which was then photographed as vertically as possible; each time, a stereo couple was taken. These couples are to be restituted during the academic year 2005 2006 in the Department of Geography at Ghent University. The end product will be a series of digital relief models and orthophoto maps of every individual vertical section of the wall. Later on, these separate parts can be re-assembled on a framework that re-creates a virtual reality model of the acropolis wall. Part of the N city wall was also cleaned, labelled with cardboard materialized marks and recorded by photogrammetry. More than 70 materialized marks were included. Digital relief models and orthophoto maps will also be produced for this area. The materialized marks were measured in order to learn the co-ordinates in x, y and z. This was done from different stations with a reflectorless total station. Measured control points for photogrammetry restitution: 171; accuracy: l-3mm. All but two points were measured several times to provide redundancy and to increase accuracy. The co-ordinates were equalized within the Excel programme (Microsoft?) to check the precision of the measurement and to ensure the highest possible accuracy of the computed co-ordinates. Within the spacial photogrammetry study, two types of satellite images were available in 2005 for the site of Titane: CORONA and ASTER images. The 1st has a ground resolution of 1.8m, the 2nd of 15m. Both types of data are recorded in a stereoscopic way. In the past, the CORONA data have been used by the CIA for espionage purposes. The CORONA images date from 1962, the ASTER images from 2003. Our aim is to produce digital elevation models in the two different resolutions which will place the site of Titane in a wider geographic context. Twenty five ground control points were, therefore, measured within a 10km radius of the surrounding area. River crossings as well as road bends and crossroads served as ground control points. The points were measured by means of differential GPS (Leica SR 20) with a minimum stationing time of 20 minutes. All points were also processed using LGO and providing an accuracy of 3-5cm in the UTM34 system. The points were selected on the CORONA images, but are also used for the production of the ASTER DEM. The final product consists of digital elevation models and orthophoto maps in the two different ground resolutions. The DEM will be used as the basis for a viewshed analysis. With the application of this technique we aim to show how the archaeological site of Titane was visible throughout the Asopus valley. The multi-spectral ASTER images are used to implement an image classification relating to the actual land use. The CORONA images can be used to study the use of the land in the area surrounding the site of Titane in the 1960s. For the image classification a number of training areas were defined and their land use registered. This process was repeated for different areas in the vicinity of Titane. The data obtained are necessary to allow a supervised image classification. The land use of the 1960s needs to be re-created on the basis of conventional inter pretation keys. The geometric deformations of the multi-spectral ASTER image can be corrected by means of the ASTER DEM and orthophoto map. The interpretation of the land use in the 1960s can be incorporated directly on to the newly assembled CORONA orthophoto map. The end products are two land use maps (1962 and 2003) and a map showing the changes in land use. The DEMs are to be integrated into these maps.' Lechova monastery. K.

Hector Williams (Canadian Institute, University of British Columbia) reports on the 2005 season of survey and study: 'The 2005 season focused on further extensive geophysical survey work within the walls of the LCl-MHel city, on excavation and study of EC1 graves, on further study of the forti fications and on preparation of final publication of the acropolis sanctuary. Ben Gourley and a team from the University of York carried out both resistivity and fluxgate gradiometer surveys over some 20,000m2 and revealed much detail of the street plan on the hitherto unexplored W side of the city as well as adding to our knowledge of the S central area. A chance discovery in a recently ploughed field provided the oldest object from the area, a Mousterian lithic (100,000-35,000 BC) (Fig. 41); it possibly came in as building fill for the LCI city's road system. Sandra Garvie Lok and a team from the University of Alberta completed the study of the ECh and Med skeletal material both from the anc. site and the nearby Zaraka monastery, including the excavation of a new grave on the W side of the city. We now have evidence for five different areas of ECh burials in and around the city (possibly family cemeteries) although as yet we have found no traces of the actual settlement. Limited excavation in the large EHel artillery tower on the W wall added to our knowledge of the history and use of that site. Gerald Schaus and others continued to prepare the publication of the small sanctuary, possibly to Athena, although a study of the fragmentary kore found in the temple suggests Artemis to Mary Sturgeon who is publishing the piece, on the W end of the acropolis. Interestingly the lamps from the site date from the LCI to EHel period with a considerable drop-off after ca 250 BC, although pottery continues in abundance until the probably Rom destruction in 146 BC; then a small number of lamps from the 1st and 2nd Cts AD appear and finally two imitation N African lamps of the L 5th-6th Cts AD.'

Elsewhere, deposits of LProtoGeo to Cl date revealed pottery and the 'caryatid' handle of an EC1 bronze mirror, probably manufactured in Sikyon around 470-460 BC (Fig. 44). A Cl kiln was re-used for two MHel (3rd Ct BC) tile burials, one of an infant containing perfume flasks and numerous female figurines, the other (of an adult) the usual lamp, lagynos and perfume flasks. Six more Cl graves were discovered nearby on the banks of the seasonal stream Xeria (anc. Charadros). Of the four Cl cist graves, gr. 1 contained multiple inhumations and numerous local black-glaze drinking vessels (including five boisai skyphoi) dating to the end of the 5th Ct BC. Graves 2, 5 and 6 were single adult inhumations, graves 5 and 6 containing drinking vessels (kylikes, Cor skyphoi), figurines and one strigil. The two pithos inhumations also contained drinking vessels of similar date, comprising more boisai skyphoi and a Cor pyxis. Grave 6 seems to have disturbed earlier Geo levels. 42.

Ipsilanti (Marangou plot) was a pit containing Ar black-glaze pottery. Terracotta figurines and a bronze pin may come from a nearby sanctuary. The LRom EByz levels here may relate to similar strata nearby at Parodos Gounari (Morou plot), where part of an apsidal structure with a tile floor was encountered. At O. Nafpliou (Kalala plot) an Ot well, two retaining walls of an anc. road, and three Ar pithos burials (one containing two adults, one an infant and one of a child), were identified Finds include two small Cor aryballoi and (not clearly associated) two Argive krateriskoi. Two trial trenches at Akova, Portitses (Boukara plot) revealed levels containing Cl-Hel pottery, female terracotta figurines and a bronze coin, dating from the 5th to the 3rd Ct BC, and a (Cl?) funerary stele inscribed KAEOTIMOT. At the junction of O. Kallergi and Seferi (Kazantzi plot) of sixteen pits, three lined with clay, one contained Hel pottery, X-type loomweights, terracottas and one lamp of the 3rd Ct BC, the others similar material (pottery, loomweights, bronze coins) of LRom-EByz date. These pits had disturbed eleven ProtoGeo-MGeo graves (five cist, two pithos burials and four trench graves), residual finds included some trefoil oinochoai. The one intact cist grave dates to ProtoGeo/EGeo transition (Fig. 45). Four SubMyc ProtoGeo inhumations in pits nearby contained bronze arc fibulae, finger rings and dress pins. Finds from the two pithos burials include a trefoil oinochoe, a handmade prochoiskos and some bone objects. At O. Diomidous 48 (Dagre plot) a Hel road was associated with two MHel cremations in trenches covered by tiles. The absence of small bones (phalanges etc) may indicate that cremation itself took place somewhere else. 44. Argos: Cl bronze mirror handle **$&gt;*, '?f^? '?N.*^. 45.

At a lower level, one Geo cist grave and one Geo pithos burial contained sparse grave goods (including bronze finger rings and a skyphos). Three ProtoGeo trench graves with stone coverings contained adults associated with amphorae, stirrup vases, bronze finger rings and dress pins. Finally, three MH pithos burials contained the bones of children. Ethnos (09/04/05) notes further developments on the 60 or so bronze and two lead inscribed plaques from the Sanctuary of Pallas Athena (AR 50 [2003-2004], 19-20; AR 51 [2004 2005], 23). Particular light is shed on the date of the construc tion of the Cl Temple of Hera at the Heraion (see below) with its associated chryselephantine statue. Agora of Argos. Marcel Pi?rart (EFA) summarizes the 2005 season of excavations at the agora: 'The goal of the campaign was to clean the sewers to allow the visitor to understand the plan of the installation and to ensure that the ruins were protected. We started by cleaning the triangular basin and the secondary channel which ended in it. The channel which defined the limits of the Ar agora toward the E, unearthed in BE.BF/95, has also been cleaned and drawn. The study of the architectural elements allowed us to specify, at some points, the relative chronology of the monuments of the agora. In BD.BE/95.96, the bases (or dado proper?) of the pillars of the ECh aqueduct, which crossed the agora from W-E, were in part built with limestone blocks from the hypostyle room, where they had acted as dado capping for the columns inside the room. We may confirm that the aqueduct which bordered the S wall of the room was only erected after the destruction of this structure. Badly built, it probably did not remain in use for very long. At the time of the construction of the arches which covered the three channels of the sewer in this sector, one of the pillars of the aqueduct had been completely disassembled.' Argos, Nannopoulos plot. Anne Pariente and Christos Piteros report on the the 3th excavation season, a joint project between the EFA and the 6th EPCA: 'It was not possible to demolish the series of basins used to produce tsipouro on the W part of the plot. We therefore gave up on opening new trenches in the S part. The 2005 excavation was confined to the trenches opened in 2003 and 2004. We present here the results, derived from these trenches, according to a division into two zones: (a) the N sector (trenches AL 79, AL 80, AM 79 and AM 80), that of the krepis and the central basis of the orchestra; and (b) the S sector of orchestra (AN 80 and AO 81). To the N of the krepis we had to cut the berme to the E of AL 79 (whose N part had been excavated in 2004) in order to open a visual perspective on the S part of the public place. Under a mod. layer, the pavement of very compact gravel (previously unearthed in 2003 in AL 79) rested on a sufficiently hard and homogeneous layer of brown soil, which contained abundant lst-4* Ct AD pottery remains. At level 11.13 (identical to the lowest level of the street identified in the SE part of AL 79 in 2004) a strip, composed of a large concentra tion of ballast and fragments of tiles and touvlos, covers the S part of the krepis. Some 20cm thick, this strip produced, with some comb-patterned pottery sherds of the 6th Ct AD, a glazed yellow-green sherd, the date of which (badly established to the 12th or 18th-19th Cts AD), force us, in any case, to date the overhauls on this part of the plot, and, in particular, the instal lation of this street, to the EByz period. The pale brown layer found in 2004 at the bottom of the N disruption, rested, to the S, against the upper face of the poros blocks of the foundations of a possible colonnade. The pottery dates to the 3rd-5th Ct AD. To the N it covered the strip of work chips, previously discovered in AL 79 in 2004: at a thickness of between 5-20cm the strip contained an abundance of chips of limestone and poros mixed with a fine and extremely compact beige coloured earth and yielded five sherds of different dates. This layer of work chips, likely to be the remains of the L cuts of the krepis blocks, ends under the berm against the partition marking the N limit of the Nannopoulos plot. To the N limit of this layer of work chips, a strip of dark beige soil yielded mixed pottery fragments, dated to between the 2nd Ct BC and the 2nd Ct AD. Three new poros blocks, presumed to be foundations of a colonnade, have been unearthed: the two E blocks belong to the lower course of this foundation (level 10.79) whereas the W block belongs to the upper course, of which only two blocks remain (level 11.04). The E blocks were re-cut in a completely irregular way (Fig. 46). 46. Argos: krepis foundation These unexplained undercuttings do not seem, in the plan, to correspond to any identifiable structures. To the S of the krepis in AL 80, we dismantled the street berms left in place in 2004 in the SE part of the trench: the 1st at 11.48; the 2nd at 11.43. At level 11.08, a 3rd level of soil rests on a thick layer of pale brown earth which contained three glazed green sherds of the 18th Ct. This confirms, as regards this street, several successive pavings of an Ot date, as had been suggested in 2004. Immediately to the S face of the blocks of the krepis, where a concentration of similar objects was collected in 2004, we found a speculum in bronze and a pin stem in bone. This layer continues, starting at level 10.45, with a layer of clear brown earth mixed with an abundant amount of destruction material, including large iron slags and several fragments of gray marble veneer. The ceramics cover a large chronological span, from the 1st to the 5th Ct AD. Perpendicular to the krepis, at level 10,36, an ashy trace including wood coal (/. 1.20m, d. 15cm) yielded some sherds from the 2nd to the 4th Ct AD. It is necessary to note that the small ballast blockage and gravel covered by hydraulic mortar under the foundations of the krepis inside the exedra, which was discovered further W on Karmoyannis plot, is here curiously absent. Perhaps, here, the same level of water-proof floor was not useful? The excavation stopped in 2005 at level 10.03.</page><page sequence="30">30 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. Immediately to the S, in AM 80, the resumption of excavations at levels 10.93-10.85 allowed us to discover two tombs in the SW corner and an oblong trench, running E-W and dug to level 10.38, which was full of destruction material mixed with a grey brown soil. In the filling of the two tombs, each of which contained an adult skeleton, we collected pottery of the 2nd-5th Ct AD which provides a tpq for this badly known necropolis. These three pits had been dug into a layer of clear brown earth, attested on the entire surface of the trench which produced, in addition to destruction material typical of the embankment layers, pottery of the 2nd-5th Ct AD accompanied by large fragments of mortar and by a bronze speculum. The bottom of this layer presents a clean slope, from level 10.79 in the NW to level 10.46 in the SE. This embankment layer was also disturbed, along the E berm, by another disruption which continues under the berme. This new layer is full of browner earth with an abundant concentration of destruction material (as well as the fragments of several stems of needle in bone and ivory). It rested, in the NE corner of the trench at level 9.77, on the concreted floor of the exedra, covered here by a fine layer of very sticky and compact clayey earth. In the E part of the trench, from level 10.60 (to the N) and 10.46 (to the S) another pale brown layer similar to the previous one yielded an even greater amount of destruction material. Together with this destruction material we found animal bones, a fragment of palmette anthemion in limestone and a fragment of millstone in trachyte. The heterogeneous pottery found could be dated between 3rd and 5th Cts AD. A clearer embankment layer, in which fragments of whitish mortar abound (together with fragments of marble veneer, terracotta lamps and fragments of bronze tool blades), covered the whole square, from level 10.16-10.10 to level 9.99-9.91. Except for the NW corner, a layer of coffee-brown earth, also full of destruction material, covers at level 9.93-9.86 a grey, extremely fine and homogeneous clay, which could be the result of the decanting of a basin bottom. The difficulty of delimiting with any accuracy these different layers or embankment holes is due to the similarity of their components and the fact that the earth there is mixed: the differences of texture, colour or compactness can only mirror the succession of works on a massive re-embankment which transformed this sector of the former agora in ECh times ? a veritable dustbin! We also cut the NW corner of the berms of AM 80 which had been filled in 2004 at level 11.86-11.75 in order to gain a better view. Under the upper, mod. layers, we cleared, at levels 11.65 and 11.10, the street soils of small gravel and, then, those of compacted earth; the 2nd layer contained pottery of the 5th 6th Ct AD. These soils rested, at level 10.79, on a layer of very ashy beige earth, containing wood coal, which roughly followed the orientation of the krepis. It contained, in addition to some Hel sherds and two fragments of a dish in imitation of the 6th Ct AD, a bronze bird. We recovered then, at level 10.77 (to the S) and 10.45 (to the N), the clear brown layer with destruction material which was also present in AM 79 and AM 80 and whose ceramic material datestothe3rd-5thCtAD. This destruction material, present all over the excavated embankments, is also evident in the dark brown earth which extends toward the N and W in the direction of the krepis and the central basis. In this earth we found a few large iron slags and pottery of the 5th Ct AD, a fragment of acanthus leaf of a Cor capital, as well as a fragment of capital volute in basalt. The excavation stopped at the level of a blacker earth disruption layer to the E (also present in the NE corner of AM 80) and, to the W, at level 10.10, on the compact orange earth, mixed with fine gravel, which borders, at AM 79, the krepis and the three blocks aligned off the central basis. On the high part of the central basis of the orchestra, touching the krepis, we found, at level 10.61, a more or less horizontal layer constituted of small fragments of touvlos and architectural elements glued together by hydraulic mortar: it could be the bottom of a small basin, w. 0.60m, of which only the N edge remains. The layer which covered this basin continues further E, with a slope leading downward from W-E. The pottery found dates from the 2nd to the 5th Ct AD. In 2005 we continued with the clearing of this very altered central basis by re-doing, at level 10.33, the excavation in AM 79. The thick layer of embankments of grey earth mixed with an enormous concentration of destruction material (which we started excavating in 2004), produced many fragments of archi tectural elements, sculptures or simple blocks. These findings were accompanied by white and pink mortar fragments. Descending until level 9.96, we found a layer of hard orange earth (perhaps a floor?), sited at the same level as the lower foundation of the blocks of the W limit of the central basis in AN 79. On this 'floor' we collected a fragment of column drum in stuccoed poros of uncertain origin which was identical to the drum preserved in the NE part of the hypostyle room. At the upper level, two new re-used blocks, which were in contact and alignment with the block discovered in 2004, constituted an alignment northbound. To the S of the block discovered in 2004, we discovered two other blocks in limestone which formed a horizontal level. The presence in this area of some heaps of reddish earth, possible remains of a floor, remains to be explained. It is likely in any case that the central basis, probably ECh in date, was rebuilt as a structure on two levels, with a hydraulic function, constituted in its upper part of a basin with hydraulic mortar. This great basis could be constituted by a device in the form of the Gr letter T7 (the two blocks found in 2005 in AM 79 would constitute the E side. To the E of this branch, the NW S slope of the embankments suggests that they have been poured into a hollow structure, the basin of the 2n phase of the exedra. The enormous quantity of fragments of blocks and various architectural elements, co-present with many white, pink and grey mortar fragments, indicate the violent destruction of one or more buildings, probably sited nearby. In the S sector, at basin and foundation bench of the orchestra, the decision to open trenches AN 80 and AO 81 was motivated by our desire to confirm the presence, proposed on the basis of the reconstruction of the plan, of the elements of orchestra. In AN 80, we dismantled the ENE-WSW low wall, of presumably recent date, which blocked the N part of the square. It rested on the brownish earth layer in which the tombs inves tigated in 2004 had been dug and which yielded ceramic material of the 2nd-4th Ct AD. It was above a brownish layer, poor in material, under which we have been able to identify the summit of a layer of orange brown earth from level 10.50 to level 10.38 on a slight slope from NW-SE. According to its composition (destruction material together with many fragments of mortar, animal bones, pebbles and ballast, as well as pottery with concretions of the 3rd-5th Ct AD) it can be identified with the layer found in AM 80. Above this layer, in the excavation which was not finished in 2005, to the SE and in the centre of the square, there was a more or less homogeneous brownish layer with pottery finds dating from the 1st to the 4th Ct AD.</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 31 In AO 81, from level 10.50, we continued the excavation of the light dark brown earth layer. Although the funeral pits are identifiable only by the presence, near the bones, of some snail shells, we excavated six burials, three of which were skeletons of children and one of an infant, at levels 10.43, 10.29 and 10.03. The SW quarter of the square contained, at level 10.03, a granular layer of earth, different from the SE quarter where the upper brownish earth continued, on a strong E slope. It was investigated in 2005, until level 9.46, and has yielded an important quantity of 3rd-4th Ct AD material. In this area we discovered a large architectural block in limestone, with arris, necessarily belonging to a building nearby. It toppled or was thrown in to a pit with a strong S decline. Three other blocks had probably also toppled, because of the same strong slope in the big disruption, named 'Byz', which is dug in the S part of the Karmoyannis plot. The findings cover an ample chronological span, since they include pieces ranging from a fragment of an obsidian arrowhead and a glazed sherd of the 12th to 14th Ct AD to ceramic material, constituting the majority, dated to the L Imperial and the ECh periods. The presence in this pit of three identifiable blocks of the orchestra confirms the plan and the architectural composition of this structure, original as well as imposing on account of its dimensions: a course bench decorated with a moulding surmounted a basis constituted by two long tangent steps.' Argos, the Aspis G Touchais and A. Philippa-Touchais report on the 2005 season of excavation and conservation work on this MH settlement: Within the setting of works conducted for a number of years and in order to assure the protection of the site during the course of this year, we restored a number of walls of the MH settlement and repaired the fence in the SE area. In parallel with the pottery study, we began a programme of topographic and architectural study of the MH settlement of the Aspis this year. Its goal is double: to complete a detailed topographic survey of the summit of the hill using the most recent technology; and to produce a general architectural analysis of the PH constructions of recent and former excavations. The new topographic plan of the Aspis, made with a differ ential GPS and a total station, will include all the architectural remains (anc. and mod.) visible on the hill. Therefore, it will constitute a surer basis for the diachronic study of the building activity, including: a PH settlement, a sanctuary(?), anc. fortresses (ramparts, cisterns and buildings) and mod. construc tions (shelters, trenches, a chapel and a restaurant). As regards the study of the PH settlement, which constitutes the main goal of the project, the reduction of the equidistance of the contour lines (lm or 2 m, against 4m on the present plan) will provide a better reading of the soil morphology and a better understanding of the modes of erecting the constructions. PHASE III HM III A 47. Argos: the apsis, plan of phase 3 t-J? v\ X\ \\ at?i\\ &amp;</page><page sequence="32">32 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. From 10-16 July 2005, L. Fadin, assisted by Th. Repellin (DESS, University of Dijon) proceeded with the 1st phase of the topographic study of the Aspis. The work was carried out using a total station (Leica TCR702) and a differential GPS (Leica system 1200). L. Fadin writes: 'After having checked the homogeneity of the five geodesic points sited at the periphery of the city of Argos, we connected ourselves to the Gr co-ordinates system through the intermediary of point 78 and implanted three reference stations on the site at points where the lack of vegetation cover enabled us to do so. The Aspis hill is covered by a dense forest of resinous trees which conceal the signals given out by the satellites. As a result, we mostly used the total station. The damaged and sometimes disturbed character of the land forced us to take other points than those planned. During this week a 3rd of the total surface was surveyed. It will be necessary to plan two weeks of campaign to finish this survey. ' Because it is not possible to study the architectural remains recently discovered, aside from the constructions previously discovered by W. Vollgraff, it was necessary to re-examine the latter to see if they are susceptible to some of the architectural phases distinguished in the new excavations. This study can be inserted in the context of a larger reflection on the evolution, during the MH, of the organization of the settlements and the occupation of the space. At the end of 2004, A. Philippa-Touchais began, with the help of architect P. Philippa, to re-examine the PH buildings investigated by W. Vollgraff. Because these buildings have largely disappeared, the only sources for this study are the two articles by Vollgraff and, especially, the topographic plan of P. Soursos mentioned above. The meticulous study of this plan allowed us to assign the constructions to at least three architec tural phases. These have been drawn on distinct plans which allow us to visualize the spatial evolution of the settlement as well as its shape and its organization during each of the three phases. The main results achieved until now can be summarized as follows. During the earliest occupation phase (MH I?II) it is certain that the lower terrace of the summit plateau of the hill was inhabited, at least in the area which extends from the N section to the SE (we ignore the question of whether the central area of the plateau was also inhabited). In the following phase (MH IIIA) it is certain that the settlement reached the intermediate terrace and that the central sector of the summit plateau was also inhabited. It is during this phase that several retaining walls were built in a more or less concentric manner, structuring the space in several terraces (Fig. 47). The last phase (MH IIIA-LH IA) is marked by the construction of an architectural complex in the shape of a circle bow on the E border of the settlement, immediately inside 'the external circuit wall' (Fig. 48). The plan of the complex, characterized by consistency and symmetry, suggests that it was constructed according to a premeditated plan and that it was destined to delimit and protect the inhabited area. The organization of the central sector, at the summit of the hill, is also particularly interesting: three juxtaposed buildings dominate the upper terrace, surrounded by a wall, while on the immediately lower terrace a set of constructions seems to form a sort of 2nd concentric ring around the central core of the settlement. With regard to the two successive 'circuit walls' of the settlement ('internal' and 'external', to use Vollgraff's definitions) the study proposed the following hypotheses. There were not two circuit walls but, very probably, three (or even four) which were retaining walls structuring the space in three or four landings. It is likely that they were built progressively, after the destruction of the settlement by fire at the end of MH II. The tracing of the 'internal wall' was probably different from the one supposed by Vollgraff. The two powerful wall segments assigned to the internal circuit may belong to two different 'circuit walls': the segment cleared at the summit of the hill was apparently part of a wall which surrounded the central terrace (the highest) of the settlement, while the segment discovered in the E sector probably belonged to the retaining wall of the intermediate terrace, whose tracing had to be parallel to that of the 'external circuit wall'. The presence of the 'external circuit wall' in the place of the future rampart of historical times is suggested by the tracing of the architectural complex in the form of a circle bow, which had to be erected in relation with this circuit wall. The two structures follow a parallel tracing, at least on most of the E half of the settlement; the space included between the two (2.50m) was presumably occupied by a peripheral street. The 'external circuit wall' could have had a double function, as a retaining wall and as a fortifica tion wall. From the previous remarks, it is possible to formulate some hypotheses concerning the social organization of the settlement, especially during its final phase. The picture of the settlement during this phase clearly shows that it had been thoroughly re-modelled, that the space was structured through a system of terracing walls and imposing constructions. This suggests a degree of relatively elevated social cohesion, a society able to conceive and achieve structures of common interest (which perhaps corresponded to a certain desire for affirmation or even of ostentation). Besides, the presence of this impressive architectural device on the hill, connected with the contemporary settlement remains at the foot of the hill itself, evokes the acropolis/low city model. This primitive type of acropolis included some buildings presumably endowed with special function and may have housed social groups enjoying a particular status. A. Philippa-Touchais and G. Touchais, assisted by Th. Repellin, continued to record the ceramic material. Work focused this year on the matt-painted vases of the N yard. On the other site, the preliminary study of the coarse ware has revealed some hiatuses in the computerized files which have, therefore, been verified and completed systematically for the two yards (N and SE). The same work has been done on the files of the fine and semi-fine monochrome ware sherds already recorded. Five archaeologists who are specialists of pottery of the same period in other regions (in Crete, L. Girella; in the Cycladic islands, J. Overbeck, D. Crego and I. Nikolakopoulou; and in Boiotia, K. Sarri) came to examine the material of the Aspis in the presence of A. Philippa-Touchais. L. Girella confirmed the non-Cretan origin of the fragments of MM style found on the Aspis as well as their relatively L dating (MM III), the remaining scholars confirmed the presence of Cyc imports, notably from Thera and Melos. In the setting of the Prosodie programme 'Earth and fire in the Aegean Proto-historic world' (piloted by the team of Aegean Prehistory of the UMR 7041-ArScAn), R. Orgeolet stayed in Argos for a short while in September to begin the survey of the earth fragments, used for building, collected in the excavations of the Aspis and preserved in the museum. In the setting of the programme of research on the MH Argolis, coordinated by S. Voutsaki (Archaeological Institute of the University of Groningen), the 1st analyses of the samples of human bones taken in 2004 have been achieved. Carbon 14 analysis (A. J.

Argos: the apsis, plan of phase 4 skeletons belonging to tombs of phases III (TA 1, 7, 8, 11, 12) and IV (TA 4, 5) of the settlement. The results unfortunately do not present the expected consistency, probably because most of these skeletons had come into contact with bedacryl during the excavations. The DNA analysis of five skeletons (TA 3, 4, 5, 6, 8) is currently being conducted at the University of Thessalonica by S. Kou?dou-Andr?ou (Department of Biology and Preventive Medicine) and L. Kovatsi (Laboratory of Medico-Legal Toxicology of the Faculty of Medicine). They are not yet finished but the 1st results are encouraging. The analyses of the steady isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, which will provide information on the differences in the diet of the population, are also ongoing. This is being carried out by M. Richard (Director of the Laboratory of Paleo-Dietological Research of the University of Bradford) on the skeletons of a teenager (TA3), two young adults (TA 6, 7), two adults of middle age (TA 2, 4, 5) and one adult of an advanced age (TA 1). It is to be feared, however, that the chemicals used for the conservation of the bones will have a deleterious effect on the results. At the beginning of 2005 P. Philippa, architect, completed the digitalization of the plans, stone by stone, of the excavation (N and SE sectors) in vectorial drawing.' Byz Argos. E. Bakourou and G. Tsekes (ADelt, 223) report on the importance of the area of Denezes and Tentzeres plot, which is known to be one of the four cemeteries of the Byz phase of the town. At Manou plot, they (ADelt 223) report on parts of buildings and tombs, dated mainly to EChr times. Mycenae. S. Iakovidis (ASA) reports on further excavation in two locations (Ergon, 29-38). On the Acropolis, investigation of the area between house BA and house complex M-A, defined by two substantial retaining walls, revealed a destruction horizon over an earlier floor. On this, to the S, a later room was built, incorporating re-deposited material from the destruction horizon (MH-LH HIA2/B1 pottery, burnt wood, stone tools, figurines and fragments of wall-plaster). Parts of earlier Neo, MH and LH I?II horizons were also reached. One of the retaining walls was built over an earlier MH inhumation grave. At the Petsas house investigation of rooms T and n was completed. From the fill of the well in room n came a fragment of Egyptian faience with the cartouche of the Pharaoh Amenhotep (Amenophis) III (1405-1367 BC), associated with LH IIIB2 finds. From room 2 came LH II?IIIA1 finds; an infant burial was dug into the floor, associated with a LH IIIA1 kyathos and gold beads from a necklace.

Furthermore, the major project, financed by the Gr Ministry of Culture and conducted by the Gr part, for the conservation of the monuments and the arrangement of the whole area of the Acropolis, continued with cleaning, consoli dation of the Myc walls, construction of retaining walls and the establishment of walking paths, safe for both the visitors and the archaeological remains. In the SW building on the plateau, excavation continued in room XIV and was concluded with the discovery of its floor and the wall which defines the room from the SW. In the SW corner there is a triangular low bench built of stones and with a filling of soil and pebbles. The floor deposit contained fragments of LH IIIB2 vases, such as jugs, stirrup jars, deep bowls of group A and B and a monochrome stemmed bowl. Stone pounders, fragments of painted plaster, and fragments of fine plain and coarse pottery were also found, including pieces of a tripod cooking pot and of a larnax. A new room, room XVI, was found next to room XIV communicating with the latter via an opening. Only half of the room has been preserved. The preserved floor of the room formed by the two remaining walls is made of trodden earth. In the corner are the remains of another low built bench like that in room XIV. A stone pounder and a large pithos were placed on the bench. Many fragments of the pithos were found scattered on the floor together with fragments of unpainted and semi-coarse kylikes, including a trimmed kylix base, possibly used as a lid. The floor deposit contained LH IIIB2 sherds, as well as another stone pounder, a piece of haematite with traces of cutting and a bronze arrowhead. Outside rooms XIV and XVI to the SE and NW, under piles of fallen stones, an accumulated deposit of bedrock was found, which had been roughly cut to create a levelled area. This deposit contained interesting finds, such as two distorted bronze needles, fragmentary human and animal figurines, steatite spindle-whorls, as well as pieces of mother-of-pearl, fluorite and rock crystal. These pieces, and the piece of haematite, show the existence of jewellery workshops operating on the acropolis of Midea. Other finds are two abraded sealstones of steatite, a glass bead, fragments of painted plaster and tools, such as a large stone hammer-axe, stone pounders, a fragmentary millstone and a wetstone. Terracotta roof tiles and carbonized figs and seeds were also recovered. Abundant fragmentary 49. Midea: LH IIIB2 rosette bowl pottery of LH IIIB2 was found, which includes some vases that have been partly restored, such as a rosette deep bowl (Fig. 49), a jug with linear decoration, a straight-sided alabastron, likewise with linear decoration, a storage stirrup jar and some cooking pots, one of them a tripod. Excavations continued in the W gate area with the aim of finding the continuation of the building complex abutted to the fortification wall, which had been uncovered in previous seasons. Under thick disturbed deposits with piles of stones, remains of ruined walls were found and masses of smashed vases, probably associated with a floor, which has not been preserved. In the SE corner of the trench, against the fortifica tion wall, a large fragmentary pithos was found in situ, which has been partly restored. Other fragmentary vases of LH IIIB2 date were recovered in close vicinity to the pithos, such as a ring-based krater with panelled decoration (Fig. 50), stirrup jars, deep bowls of group A and B, a plain conical kylix, cooking jars and storage vessels. Some finds of the Ar and Rom periods come from the upper layers of the trench. The Rom finds include sherds of storage ribbed vessels and fragmentary terracotta roof tiles. To Ar times belong a fragmentary one-handled black-glaze cup of the beginning of the 6th Ct BC, similar to the Ar cups from Tiryns, three fragmentary terracotta figurines and an intact bronze pin. These finds, and others from previous campaigns in the same area, indicate that on the acropolis of Midea, probably in the W gate area, there must have been an Ar shrine, like those at Mycenae and Tiryns. 50. Midea: LH IIIB2 ring-based Krater</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 35 The excavation of trench A, opened in 2004 at the NW terrace of the upper acropolis, continued and was concluded. In most of the trench bedrock was found forming large outcrop pings. In the SW section two graves of EH III date were uncovered, both damaged and disturbed. Grave 1 is a rock-cut chamber tomb, roughly rectangular. Some stones found in front of the stomion probably come from its blocking. The roof is not preserved, but apparently consisted of stone slabs. In the tomb a few scattered bones were found, as well as a small axe of black stone, a pedestal-footed proto-Minyan cup and the base of a red slipped bowl. Grave 2 is a small irregular pit with a clay and whitish plaster lining. It contained a very contracted skeleton, the upper part of which, with the scull, was missing. Fragments of a coarse vessel with a smeary slip and a fragmentary stone amulet were found in the pit. In the NE side of the trench, in a deeper level and in a space between the stone outcroppings and two fragmentary walls, an intact deposit with EH II pottery was found. This is an important ceramic assemblage including many fragments and sherds, some of which come from vases of standard shapes of the EH II repertoire. Partly restored are the following: saucers with slipped surface, Urfirnis (now called dark-painted) sauceboats, ring-based bowls, ladles, pithoi with plastic decoration and askoi. In addition to the pottery the deposit contained a clay conical seal with a suspension hole; it is unfortunate that its sealing surface is abraded. Two fragmentary terracotta figurines, one anthropomorphic and the other zoomorphic were also found. A fragmentary clay conical spindle-whorl and two fragments of obsidian blades should also be mentioned. From the EH finds on the upper acropolis of Midea in the 2004 and 2005 seasons, it is becoming all the more clear that this site, like Tiryns, was important in the EBA.' A. Louise Schallin (Swedish Institute) reports on the Swedish part of the excavations, in the area of the E gate: 'This season's work was concentrated on the area directly SE of the inner gate, specifically in trenches 13 and 14 and in the unexcavated part of Astr?m's room 6. Some cleaning of earlier excavated areas, clearing for a mod. path and, also, the removal of old dumps was undertaken. Trench 13 was laid out to the S of Astr?m's room 7. Earlier in the year, while clearing the visitors' path, Gr archaeologists discovered a concentration of stones in this area. In order to investigate this feature, the trench incorporated the visible stones and extended E. Structurally we appear to have two walls, perpendicular to each other and meeting in a corner to the S. The walls are 0.90 lm wide and constructed with rather large stones with small stones in between. The walls were very close to the surface and the excavated material dates to the MH and LH periods with some LRom intrusions. The S side of room 6 had remained unexcavated until now. In order to free the S wall and get a better understanding of the room, the scarp was taken down. It consisted of a dark brown, d. 0.05-0.10m, surface layer followed by the Myc destruction debris going down all the way to the floor. The light grey debris layer is very fine in texture, due to the high level of ash, and the pottery fragments have not suffered much wear. Large pinkish chunks of mud-brick were retrieved, as were two pierced lids, one stone hand tool and one folded lead weight, from among plentiful pottery sherds and a few bones and seashells. The wall of room 6 is built with large stones, and next to each other on top of one of the boulders rested a small one handled bowl of LH IIIB date (Fig. 51) and a stone hand tool. These objects are assumed to have been in use during the last phase of the building before the conflagration. An architectural feature was exposed when the scarp was removed, i.e. an entrance into the room at the W end of the wall. Two steps, built with stones, lead down into the room from the exterior and an obsidian arrow rested on the upper step, perhaps an indication of what happened in the citadel just before the conflagration. A new trench, trench 14, was laid out along the exterior of room 6 for three reasons: (a) the mod. path has to pass here and it was therefore necessary to investigate the area so that no antiquities would be damaged; (b) information on how people circulated within the citadel is lacking and this would be a natural passageway in order to enter the rooms along the citadel wall; and (c) the architecture, if any, to the S of these rooms is unknown. The trench was soon separated into three parts: the N (W) end where we almost immediately came upon the Myc destruction layer; the central part that was covered in small stones; and the S (E) end, where work was suspended for now since this part will not be disturbed by the mod. path. Below the surface layer, the S (E) end had dark brown soil ? in contract to the N (W) end ? and, since mod. materials were found, it is, at least partly, disturbed. Also, three pieces of lead in different shapes were found here, but it is not clear from what artefacts they originated. In the central part of trench 14 a layer of packed small stones was encountered. This appears to be a post-Myc stone paving for a passageway within the citadel wall. However, the date of the sherds found between the stones is no later than LH. The Myc ground level, corresponding to the entrance of room 6, was hard but not paved nor coated. An exceptional artefact lay directly on the anc. ground level, ca 1.20m from the entrance. It is a gold ornament for suspension, probably from a necklace, that was dropped and lost in Myc times. The piece of jewellery is a small, decorated plaque covered with gold foil depicting a row of double argonauts. The details are decorated with minute beads in perfect order and proportions, probably executed with granulation technique. This is the 1st gold artefact to be found in the Gr-Swedish excavations of Midea. Although it is a single find, it either suggests that ?lite artisans or people of high status resided at Midea in LH IIIB2. Merbakas (Ag?a Triada). E. Bakourou, E. Pandou and D.

Catling reports on further tests around the shrine of Helen and Menelaus at Therapne) in 2005, undertaken on behalf of the 5th EPCA and the BSA: 'Thanks to the co-operation of the Ministry of Culture and the 5th EPCA, a series of small supplementary trials were carried out at the Menelaion. Their purpose was to obtain archaeological evidence for dating two of the main phases of construction of the Ar-Cl sanctuary. Three trials were excavated. Two of these were in the fill of the ramp on the W side to date the 1st monumental terrace system that surrounds the shrine on all four sides. In both the massive stone foundations supporting the terrace were revealed. An unexpected discovery in one of these trials was a Myc wall cut by the Ar foundations and running beneath the inner retaining wall of the ramp; the wall was associated with a cobbled surface. A deposit of burnt soil containing pottery, burnt bone and carbonized wood was found overlying the top of this wall, suggesting that the Ar and later cult of Helen and Menelaos at this location might have had an LBA predecessor of some kind. Unfortunately, the small dimensions of the trial meant that this interesting possibility could not be more fully investigated. The 3rd trial on the S side was in the fill behind the later monumental terrace added on the S and W sides of the sanctuary. The chronology of the architectural development of the sanctuary requires quite radical revision in the light of the results obtained by these trials. It is evident that both phases are substantially earlier than envisaged in the original excavations of 1909. The 1st terrace system, including the ramp, was very likely part of the original design which saw the construction of the naiskos on top of the knoll and can now be dated to the 7th Ct (ca 650-625 BC). The extensions to the terrace on the S and E sides were added in the 6th Ct, most likely ca 575-550 BC Chrysapha. E. Bakourou and D.

Efstathiou (ADelt, 159? 75) report on rescue excavations at over twenty locations within the mod. town. Architecture is mainly of Hel to LRom date, overlying important (if often disturbed) deposits of Geo, Ar and Cl date. Recently, more ProtoGeo finds have come to light, and in 1999 some MH-EMyc tombs. At least eight MH-LHI tombs, some badly disturbed, were investigated at Psychiko Spartis (sports field, once Manouaki plot), exactly opposite the important Myc site of the Menelaion. The principal tomb, an (adult?) cist grave contained a jug with LHI spiral decoration, a Vapheio type LHI cup, a wheelmade kyathos, beads of amethyst and cornelian, bronze and fragments from a boars' tusk helmet, finds all similar to those from grave circle B at Mycenae. Grave 2 (a trench with stone covering) contained an adult skeleton, but no grave goods. Graves 4, 6 and 7 were of children, grave 4 (a trench with stone covering) containing some bronze, graves 6 and 7 being pithos burials with stone covering. Grave 5, an infant, was also interred in a pithos. Grave 8 was a small infant's cist grave with bronze earrings and a bronze bead. Most of the MH pottery was of 'dark burnished' type. Elswhere, excavation tended to confirm the established picture for the Geo to EByz periods. At the junction of O. Gortsologou, O. Herakleidon and O. Saketa (Stathopoulou and Argieti plot), further excavation (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 29) revealed more EByz and LRom walls and a LRom mosaic floor, and walls and floors from an earlier M-LRom structure, a tpq being an inscribed base of Euetes ( 1st Ct AD) incorpo rated in one of the walls. The LRom structures are covered by a destruction layer with tiles and pottery of the 5th and 6th Cts AD. Other important finds include N African lamps and coins (one of Constantius II, 337-346 AD). An earlier pit contained LAr and EC1 finds, including a daedalic head, a plaque showing Medusa (Fig. 54), tile, pottery and votive lead wreaths, possibly from a nearby shrine. 54. Sparta: Cl plaque with image of Medusa</page><page sequence="38">38 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. At O. Kyprou 55 (Koutsoviti plot), two rooms from a LHel structure, with a courtyard well, were overlain by a Rom house. Hel pottery, including Megarian bowls, predominated over the Rom, with some residual Geo and Ar, including one Attic bf sherd. Other finds include figurines and a Lacedaimonian coin of 48-40 BC. At the junction of O. Leonidou and O. Dioskouron (Mavroyianni plot), structures (probably houses) with successive Hel to LRom phases, and a (Rom?) drain re-using earlier marble cinerary urns, were found. As well as E-LRom there was some residual LGeo and EAr pottery, and an apothetis containing Ar and Cl pottery, including some rf sherds. Other finds include some ECh lamps and Hel-ERom bronze coins. At O. Gortologou 28 (Kritikou plot) excavation of an anc. road with several phases and a (retaining?) wall yielded Hel lamps and perfume flasks. More Hel pottery came from O. Archidamou 151 (Varzakakou plot), perhaps indicating a ceramic workshop nearby, and at O. Archidamou 15 (Nikolopoulou plot) a room with a floor from another Rom structure was overlain by EByz levels containing glassware, lead and bone objects, and bronze coins, one of Constantius II. Nearby were three Rom trench graves, one with a lamp. Earlier occupation is indicated by Hel pottery, including Megarian bowls and W slope ware. The earliest phase of an anc. road incorporated re-deposited Ar bf kylikes, miniature vases, lead figurines and about 148 lead votive wreaths, again probably from a nearby shrine. At O. Alkmanos (Kanellopoulou and Argeitakou plots) a (LRom) mosaic floor may be associated with LRom and earlier walls in the adjacent plot. Finds include Rom and LRom pottery and glassware, figurines and earlier Hel black-glaze pottery. More remains of an LRom bath complex, a Rom house and a (Hel?) tile tomb were uncovered at O. Orthias Artemidos 12 (Stavropoulou Bouchali plot). Apart from the usual Hel to Rom pottery, finds include glassware and iron nails, two roof tiles stamped [AAMO/2IO2/[A0AN]A2 and [AAMO2I]O2/[A0ANA] TAXT/[?], and a large number of identifiable bronze coins, ranging from Lacedaimonian issues of 48-40 BC to Gallienus (253-268 AD) and Aurelian. Further excavation at O. Staoufert 12 (Zacharaki plot) yielded pottery from Geo to Hel times, including an Attic bf import (Fig. 55) and LHel Megarian bowls. Other finds include figurines, terracotta antefixes (Fig. 56) and loomweights, some stamped 01 and others ME, and a fragment of an Ar perirrhanterion re-used in a later wall. Further LRom structures were uncovered at the Central Square of Sparta. S everal phases of a LRom-EByz complex yielded pottery, some of gouged ware. Excavation of another LRom-EByz complex at O. Diinekous (Chatzakou plot) was completed. At least two phases could be identified. An ECh trench grave with a stone covering, and the course of an anc. (LRom?Byz) road were also investigated. Associated finds include LRom-EByz pottery, lamps, glassware, loomweights, bone and iron tools and 30 bronze coins, ranging from one of Eurykles (31-37 BC), to Justinian I, to Phocas and John 55. Sparta: bf fragment 56. Sparta: terracotta antefixes I/Nicephorus III (1078-1081 AD). Earlier finds include residual Hel pottery, an ERom stele inscribed TIBEPin/KAI2API/2E[BA2]Tni/2aTHPI and a ProtoGeo child's cist grave containing a skyphos and a trefoil oinochoe (Fig. 57).

Renard (University of Clermont Ferrand, EFA) report on the 2005 season of excavation at Kouphovouno: 'In the light of the overall objectives of the project and the progress made in the previous seasons, we decided to concentrate our efforts in 2005 on three main parts of the site: the continued excavation of the deep sounding in area C, which was taken down to the natural soil underneath the site; the rich LNeo levels in area G, which promised well preserved environ mental remains as well as a sequence spanning much of this long and still very poorly understood period; and further exposure of the extensive MNeo architectural remains in the W part of area C. All three were successful. The deep sounding was taken down, eventually, 4.3m. It has produced a detailed strati graphic sequence spanning much, but not all, of the MNeo period (Fig. 58) and study of its pottery will greatly refine our understanding of its typology. Many of the lower strata were deep, ill-sorted contexts with a wealth of pottery; they accumulated within a deep cut, which can be explained either as a terrace or as a quarry for building material. Carbonized grain and animal bone promise important results for inter preting the MNeo economy. A major aim of continuing and extending the excavation of area G was to try and locate further traces of LNeo architecture revealed in the 2003 season. Unfortunately, whilst further small tracts of walling were traced, no coherent plan of a LNeo building with associated floors was revealed. We have, over the last four seasons, excavated sediments of LNeo date quite widely, especially in areas G and B. Their excavation continues to be difficult, with earth-cut features such as post-holes difficult to detect and fugitive, and the levels themselves grading into each other. Consequently, excavation proceeded largely by arbitrary spit in gridded units. This system worked well, and in a number of sectors we were able to distinguish significant assemblages, including important transitional M LNeo deposits and the head of a clay animal figurine. Also revealed in area G were some MNeo architectural features including stone socles for clay walls, mud-bricks, evidently used as quoins, mud and plaster surfaces and a partition wall. A number of MNeo architectural elements were also uncovered in the W part of area C. A small rectangular structure (3m by 2m) was among the latest in this part of the site. A number of earlier walls belonged to earlier phases of construction. The trench was particularly informative in illus trating a number of MNeo building techniques including clay floors and a pebble floor, masses of building clay, sometimes burnt bright orange, wall socles, some of them incorporating post-pads to support a timbered superstructure, and a pivot stone. A small sounding in the SW corner of the W extension (60cm by 60cm) revealed a build-up of seventeen different 58. Sparta: Kouphovouno, deep sounding layers of soil, sometimes burnt and sometimes not, reaching a depth of 55cm: within it levels of occupation and levels of destruction could be recognized. A number of samples were taken in the trench wall through the whole depth of this sequence for a study of the micromorphology, and this will aid our understanding of the nature of each of the stratified units. Also in area C a grave of MBA (MH) date, containing a crouched burial laid on its left and accompanied by a clay whorl was excavated. As with the skeletons found in the previous seasons, this one will be studied in the Biological Laboratory of the University of Athens, to establish the age and sex of the individual and any traces of stress and illness. Soil samples taken from the area of the abdomen and the thoracic cage will be examined for studies into parasitology and toxicology. Other specialist studies carried out in 2005 were work on the geomorphology of the region and water resources by Eric Fouache and Claude Cosandey. Christele Ballut took samples from the deep sounding in C, from the bottom of the MH grave as well as from the deposits of building materials in area C for micromorphological analysis. Abi Bouwman has taken samples from the skeletons excavated in 2003 as part of a programme to develop methods of DNA analysis for investi gating family relationships.' Mistras. G.

Prent (University of Amsterdam, Netherlands Institute) report on the 2005 excavation: 'Systematic excavations continued in the NW part of the summit of the acropolis. New areas were opened and tests were conducted in areas excavated previously. More was found of the EH fortification system and its LCI and Hel successors. The newly exposed stretches of the EH wall were preserved, in places, to a height of 1.5m. It was confirmed that the original circuit wall had been broadened and strenghtened, based on analogy with the fortifications of Lerna IIIC. This extension was accompanied by the construction of the casemate room excavated earlier. The pottery associated with the casemate places its last use, if not its construction, in LEH II, equivalent to Lerna IIIC (L). Parts of the EH fortifica tion wall were reconstructed in MH. Good progress was made to complete the plans of the multi room Hel complexes located on either side of the two parallel streets. The walls of one room must have been largely covered with painted plaster. In two other rooms, substantial floor deposits were revealed underneath dense tile collapses. Among the finds was what may be a marble weight (15.5kg) with the name of the owner inscribed on the handle. Another important find is a small fragment of a stamped tile which refers, in two lines, to the god Apollo and the inhabitants of Geronthrai. Apparently, the roof of the room in which the fragment was found made use of tiles which originally crowned a temple of Apollo or a building associated with it. Indeed, a temple of this god is mentioned by Pausanias (3.22.6-7) as being on the acropolis of Geronthrai. The drain behind the fortification wall, discovered in 2004, was found to continue into street 1. ' E. Bakourou and D.

Worth mentioning is the 'Athenian" type of dome and the cloisonn? masonry. Gytheio. E. Zavvou and A. Themos (ADelt, 176-80) report on the excavation of Hel-Rom structures in two locations. At the junction of O. Polydeukos and Agiou Triphonos (Giannakakou plot) two structures either side of a E-MRom road were investigated. A tpq for the road itself was a bronze coin of 48-40 BC, a taq being a coin of Geta (198-212 AD). The function of the two rooms to the S of the road remains uncertain. The several rooms to the N however clearly form part of a MRom house complex, with a courtyard and well, and one room (VIII) having painted plaster with geometric designs. Other finds include several figurines, pottery and a bronze coin of Faustina (146-175 AD). At the junction of O. Mikris Asias and Archaiou Theatrou (Stathakou and Vasilouni plot) remains of several Rom structures were revealed; 1st part of a large, thin rectangular room (w. 5.65m) with a floor of (re-used) white, black and red marble, with three doors leading on to another long rectangular room, possibly originally underground. These rooms were covered with a thick destruction deposit, d. ca lm, containing fragments of a bronze statue of larger than life-size, pottery and architectural fragments. To the N, two rooms from another structure, possible a bath complex, yielded LRom amphora handles. In the W area of the excavation, a 13.6m stretch (w. 2.05m) of the Hel fortifica tion wall of anc.

Moschou (ADelt, 188-96) reports on an extensive survey of surviving anc, Med and post-Byz architec ture undertaken in advance of tourist development in the region. Most finds date to after the establishment of the Koinon of the Eleftherolakonoi (free Laconians) in 146 BC, in the region of Pliny's Sinus Aegolides (NH 4.5.16) and Pausanias' Aiyika (4.17.1). Standing remains were identified in seven locations: at Prophitis Was Demaristikon several anc. quarries of the red marmo rosso antico; at Kournos ruins of the post Byz monastery of Panayia tou Kornou, incorporating the disiecta membra of an earlier sanctuary. From here, 200m of an anc. road can be traced leading to the sanctuary at Kionia, where the foundations of two small Hel Doric structures (temples or heroa), one peripteral, one distyle in antis, and the remains of an anc. quarry are to be found. Nearby, at Chalopyrgos an extensive Rom cemetery with cist tombs, stone larnakes, sarcophagi, funerary monuments, retaining walls and periboloi also boasts a 3rd Ct AD rock-cut relief (Fig. 59) which may be connected to the imperial cult. Other architectural remains may relate to an associated settlement, as may the stone disc from a Laconian style acroterion. A nearby Hel fortified area with towers may belong to the final period of Spartan rule (before 146 BC), where a road appears to lead to the anc. harbour of Soloteri. At Potamia a Byz settlement may incorporate earlier remains, as may the Byz and post-Byz settlement at Nyphi. The later Byz and post-Byz settlements of Alika and Kyparissos incorporate elements from the earlier LHel-Rom city of KcuvTj Yloh? (Pausanias 3.21.7). At Kyparissos Kastro a Rom memorial structure, perhaps Pausanias' (3.25.9) megaron of Demeter, is to be found within the later church of the Metamorphosis tou Sotiros. Xambela may be the site of the anc. forum. At Monastiri the church of the Dormition of the Virgin incorporates architectural members from earlier periods; and at the harbour of Almyros remains of anc. and Byz structures, dating down to the 9th Ct AD, can be discerned.

The excavation of the cavea of the theatre was completed, and further stairways dividing tiers (of seats) and further seats from the 1st row were recovered. To the Rom (2nd Ct AD) orchestra belong a drain and settings for a protective palisade (presumably for fights with wild beasts). The wall of the ERom proscenium was decorated with columns and pilasters, between which were (probably) wooden painted plaques. One of three marble 'lion thrones' 60. Antheia: LMyc cup 61. Antheia: LMyc stirrup jar for distinguished persons recovered this year bore an inscription indicating it belonged to the priest of Dionysos (Fig. 62). This, together with a base with an inscription honouring a sponsor for the games of Dionysos, provides the 1st solid (as opposed to circumstantial) evidence for the theatre continuing to function as part of a Sanctuary of Dionysos in Hel and Rom times (see also Ta Nea [31/01/2006]). It remains to find the actual temple (Pausanias [4.31.4] mentions the cult of Dionysos on mount Eva, but not in the city). Another inscribed base from the theatre, with settings for a bronze statue representing the Emperor Hadrian, was set up by Tiberius Claudius Frontinus Macer Campanus, son of Tiberius Claudius Saithis Caelianus II. In the agora, other structures have been found near the Doric temple (Fig. 63) previously identified as that of Zeus Soter (but see Ta Nea [31/01/2006]), itself just S of the the anc.

One small structure to the N of the temple may be the Bouleion, another to the E appears to be another temple, later converted into a ECh basilica. Osteological study of the human bone from the infants' found in a well (see AR 51 [2004-005], 31) has so far identified 290 individuals.

Ano Englianos (Palace of Nestor at Pylos). Jack Davis (ASCSA, University of Cincinatti) and Sharon S. Stocker report on the 2005 study season of finds from Biegen 's excavations at the Palace of Nestor and from the Pylos Regional Archaeological Project (PRAP): 'Preparation of published reports on human skeletal remains and their contexts (Lynne Shepartz, Sari Miller Antonio and Joanne Murphy) is progressing rapidly. The dental health of Pylian women is significantly worse than that of males; when dental health is evaluated with regard to status (tholos vs chamber tombs), the individuals in chamber tombs show more dental pathologies and the chamber tomb women are the most affected. Shepartz and Anastasia Papathanasiou of the Ephorate of Paleoanthropology and Speleology are currently examining the Pylos population by means of stable isotope analysis as the 1st stage in a comparative study of Myc health and malnutrition. Jeremy Rutter and J. Murphy examined ceramics from the grave circle (Vayenas) and various chamber tombs. The majority of the material in the tombs should be dated to LH I LH IIIA. There is, however, secure LH IIIB material from Kondou, tholos 3, and Kokkevis (K-2/g), whole LH IIIC vessels from E-6 and a few LH IIIC sherds from E-4, E-8, tholos 3, Kondou and Kokevis (K-2/g). Three LH IIIC handmade burnished deep flaring rims are present among the finds from E-4 and E-6. MH material seems only to be related to burials in Vayenas. Of special interest are fragments in the grave circle of at least one, and possibly a 2nd, Cypriot base ring juglet. Examination of animal bones by Paul Halstead and Valasia Isaakidou noted contrasts between individual contexts studied this year, for example in the abundance of wild animals. Many observations made in previous years have been repeated: e.g., cattle seems to be mainly adult females (or, at any rate, they are small in size compared to those found in the burnt 'sacrificial' deposits). Sharon Stocker and Jack Davis studied MH finds from two soundings conducted by Marian Rawson on the property of Giorgios Petropoulos in 1939. The earliest wall found there is likely to date to EH III, contemporary with remains from Deriziotis Aloni; two later stages of construction seem to belong to an earlier phase of the MBA, and the character of associated deposits is remarkably similar to that of contempo rary levels at Nichoria. An MM vessel may be the earliest import from Crete yet recognized in Messenia. Examination of wall-paintings by Ch. Brekoulaki and her colleagues continues to yield significant results. Many new fragments have been identified that can be associated with well-known compositions in the throne room (6). In hall 64, cleaning of published fragments of wall-paintings revealed details that were only partly visible: e.g., the boars' tooth helmet and skirt of the man facing right in fragment 22H64, and the garment of his adversary (confirmed as an animal skin). Chemical analyses show that the background colour of this composition was originally executed as two distinct layers: a lower, composed of a violet-pink organic lake; and an upper of finely ground Egyptian blue. Continuing study of fragments identified in 2004 as part of a naval procession allow one ship to be described more fully. Its hull is curved and a dynamic zig-zag motive decorates its sides. Its rudder is on the starboard side and has an oar-like shape, as in the Santorini frescoes. The ship probably had a stern cabin and definitely had a central awning.' Chora area. G.

Korystyas that probably linked Patras with Dyme is associated with 34 Rom and fifteen Hel graves of the city's S cemetery. A change in burial customs can be traced between the earliest, 3rd Ct BC, Hel graves (mainly inhumations in trenches with sparse grave goods) and the Rom period, to which most of the eleven cremations belong. Roads. Aside from 'cemetery roads', a 12.5m stretch of anc. road at O. Sissini 14-16 (Bourdanioti plot) was flanked on the E by two houses, one of whose drains yielded a hoard of 128 bronze and one silver coin. At O. Korinthou, the earliest phase of a 3m stretch of road, w. 5.5m, with a retaining wall of opus caementicium, could be dated to the 2nd Ct AD. Other walls of opus caementicium and opus quasi reticulatum, and finds of marble architectural members and a marble plaque inscribed TECTORJ NOMINE (Fig. 71) indicate that other important structures (perhaps public buildings) may be found in the vicinity. Houses. The quality of the evidence varies: the walls belonging to two structures at the junction of O. Ilia Miniati 18 and Agiou Georgiou; or the walls and Rom-LRom sherds at O. Charalampi 16 (Delakoura plot) tell us little. The walls of opus reticulatum at the junction of O. Evandrou 10 and Germanou 137 (Dimitropoulou plot) and at the junction of O. Lontou and Erenstroli (Tsoulou plot) and the substantial Rom floors and wall with settings for beams supporting an upper floor at O. Vasileiou Roufou 29 (Karytinou plot) tell us more. Unfortunately the floors of a structure with a massive wall of opus quasi reticulatum with four rooms at O. Agiou Dimitriou 38 (Vamvaka plot) do not survive, though finds include an Ionic capital. A similar structure may have existed at O. Karalambi 19 (Polychronopoulou plot). Mosaic floors do survive from the Rom house at O. Gounari 141 (Rizopoulou plot) as does part of an outside courtyard with cistern. Fragments of mosaic floors were also unearthed at O. Evandrou 40 (Panayopoulou plot). Drains and cisterns. A LRom drain at O. Lontou 62 (Ioannidi plot) and a large rectangular cistern at O. Lemesou 12 are the only finds not clearly associated with houses or roads. Industrial, a Rom kiln at Ano Bouzaitika is the only sign of this, though kilns have turned up in larger numbers in previous years. Byz Patras. M.

Ladst?tter (Austrian Institute) report on the 2005 season of excavation. Both scholars continued investigations of the architecture on the so called terrace I and of the peripteral temple in the public city centre (AR 51 [2004-2005], 37-38.). 'On terrace I, further sections of the foundations of the rectangular orthostat building were excavated (Fig. 72). They corroborated the already known ground plan of an oikos shaped structure (5.7m by 8.1m), divided by an internal wall into a square room and a transverse rectangular one. A ceramic assemblage consisting of a Hel cooking pot, Hel plates, a Hel lamp of Broneer 10 type and a Hel balsamarium, found immediately adjacent to the foundations of the S wall proves that the structure was erected during the Hel period. Fragments of further balsamarla, lamps and thyhmiateria, together with the assemblage discovered in 2004 (AR 51 [2004-2005], 38) generally suggest a cultic function for this building. Below this orthostate building, sections of the limestone and flysch foundation of an older structure of rectangular plan (5m by 7m) were recognized. Directly by its W foundation lay a deposit of ten terracotta figurines, including standing cloaked female figures, a dancing satyr, a male and a female protome and a bird. This complex, dating from a point between the M 5th and E 4th Cts, suggests a cultic function for the older structure and indicates its erection in the LCI period. The excavations in the area of the peripteral temple in the E of terrace I concentrated on its E sections (Fig. 73). Of the peristaseis with their six by fifteen pillars (15.8m by 42.35m), the foundations of the 3r and 4th pillars in the E peristasis (counted from S) were exposed. Of the E end of the sekos (34.59m by 9.7m), the pronaos with two pillars in antis and the clay-flagged cella-E-hall, adjoining it to the W, were uncovered. Like the already known parts of the sekos, this hall was divided in three aisles by two rows of two pillars each. The clay slabs supporting the N row of pillars have survived. The ground plan of the building can now be assessed fully: it clearly indicates that the sekos and peristaseis, axially linked by the antae and pillars of the pronaos, were the result of a unified plan, which must be Hel in date. This contrasts with the previous interpretation, according to which the peristaseis were a later addition to the sekos. Fragments of an Ar Laconian roof discovered in previous seasons, as well as in 2005, must therefore belong to an earlier predecessor, of which no remains have so far been found in situ. 72. Lousoi: orthostat building 73. Lousoi: peripteral temple Furthermore, in the cella-E-hall, two large limestone slabs were found in situ, corresponding exactly with the axis of the pillars in the pronaos and the two central frontal pillars of the peristasis. To permit their placement, the clay flags of the floor and the S foundations of the internal pillars had been partially removed. The fact that the N one of these secondary foundation slabs in the cella-E-hall and the foundation slab of the S anta pillar join break on break indicates that the original pronaos had been dismantled all the way down to its foundations and that at least one slab gained from its demolition was re-used in the cella-E-hall. Thus, the already complete sekos underwent a major reorganization at its E end, where the cella-E-hall and the pronaos were dismantled with the aim of moving the pronaos to the W and shortening the sekos by ca 8m. Exact chronological indicators for this modification of the E part in Hel-ERom times are lacking so far. A rubble packing above the clay-flagged floor and the E wall of the cella-E-hall contained E Imperial ceramics, including fragments of plates imitating sigillata shapes, grey plates, a grey platter, a cup, cooking pots and two broken E Imperial glass vessels, indicating that the final abandonment of the temple took place at the latest in the 1st half of the 1st Ct AD.'</page><page sequence="49">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 49 Kalavryta.

Petropoulos) and the KERA of the Ethiko Idryma Erevnon (Athanassios Rizakis). The campaign has pursued two directions: verifica tion of sites of particular interest and systematic intensive recognitions. 'The verifications have focused in particular on the EH II site discovered in Kassaneva in 2003. The excavation has been widened in two areas of the highest plateau and they have brought to light wall structures, pertinent to one or perhaps more buildings, articulated in different rooms (many vessels have been found in situ, crushed on the floor, inside these rooms). The mission investigated an area, slightly more to the E, deprived of great building structures, but its function will be clarified only with the continuation of the investiga tions. Post-holes and alignments in stone seem to attest to the presence of a simple enclosure, and a large quantity of fragments of elegant pottery, some with engraved signs, and a spindle and flint tools were also recovered from this area. On the opposite shore of the Kri?s river, in the Plakopetra area, we carried out cleaning operations and surveyed the building structures (recognized in the 2004 campaign). Two structures are of particular interest: the 1st is square-planned (/. 7.20m) and bears at least two foundation rows and part of the elevation wall in orthostates (both preserved); the 2nd structure, further down, seems to belong to a building, roughly rectangular in plan, with interior spaces and apparently created on a modular base. The continuation of the systematic intensive recognition has concerned a new area in the middle valley of the Kri?s river. The investigations here have allowed us to recognize the presence of some sites, on the basis of concentrations, more or less huge, of pottery fragments. What is of particular interest is the discovery, near the mod. village of Oasis, of a great structure which is quadrangular in plan and executed largely in blocks but using at some points the natural rock. A short distance to the W, there runs a long wall recognisable for ca 60m. The function of the two structures, situated on a plateau very near the Krios and in a favourable position for the control of the valley both toward Aegeira and the sea and toward the inside, must be clarified through further investigations.' Aigeira. Georg Ladst?tter (Austrian Institute) reports on the 2005 season of excavation: 'Fieldwork took place on the so-called Terrace of Solon in the N of the acropolis of Aigeira, under the supervision of Georg Ladst?tter. Inside the Ar-Cl city, the excavation of a public club or banquet house from the M 4th Ct BC, with alterations from the turn of the 3rd/2nd Cts BC, was continued (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 38-39). The work concentrated on the SE area of the building, where several trenches were dug. To the E of the original clubhouse, several walls belonging to a small-roomed structure probably indicate a residential building. The preserved foundations and part of a clay floor belonging to this building are at a notably deeper level than the neighbouring andron. Therefore, the building dates to an earlier phase, before the M 4th Ct BC, and was abandoned at the latest when the clubhouse was erected. Regarding the clubhouse, the 2005 excavations were mainly concerned with its Hel extension. In its SE corner, a function ally connected ensemble of rooms was exposed. It consisted of a central feeder room, a water-proofed room (partially excavated already in 2004), an andron and a further room of unknown function. The roughly square feeder room or anteroom (6.4m by 6.5m) had a terrazzo floor and was accessed from the W. Three doors permit access to the rooms in the N and E. Notably, the three thresholds had been removed consequently, and two of the doors had been walled up in a later phase. To the E, we excavated the N part of an andron (conjectured 4.6m by 6.6m), recognized by the survival of the diagnostic berm (or slightly raised floor, w. 0.9m, h. 3cm) along its walls, which would have held nine couches (Fig. 74). The floor and berm are also executed in terrazzo. As regards the decoration of the walls, the socle, of white lime plaster, survived in situ; the area above it was ochre-coloured, fragments of it were found where they had fallen.</page><page sequence="50">50 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. A less well-preserved room (3m by 4.5m) N of the anteroom also had a terrazzo floor, as indicated by the survival of its pebble base layer in the S corners. The sunken basin in its SE, already uncovered in 2004, indicates a wet-room, perhaps a kitchen and/or bath. The function of a large room (8m by 4.5m) in the N of this ensemble remains unclear. Above the multiple floors of this complex of rooms lay fallen walling of unburnt mud-brick; material belonging to the period of the building's use was not located anywhere. Heavily garmented Hel pottery above the destruction deposit indicates multiple dislocation ofthat material. The determination of the outside S and E walls of the extended building permits a calculation of its entire area, at 630m2, 270 more than the original structure, thus characterizing the extension as a major one. In its extended phase, the structure possesses two andrones with eleven and nine couches, and possibly two bathrooms. This doubling of the prestige units, particularly the andrones, indicates that the building's function after its extension is continuous with that before, namely as a public clubhouse. This contrasts with the original interpretation as a residential structure. The building was abandoned in the LHel period. The notable lack of finds from its use and the deliberate taking away of the thresholds indicate a deliberate abandonment involving the removal of the mobile inventory and of valuable architec tural elements for re-use elsewhere. In 2005, Walter Gau? (Austrian Institute, Athens) began to prepare the publication of excavations undertaken on the plateau below the SE of the acropolis by Wilhelm Alzinger in 1972-1981. The preliminary study of the finds promises basic information on the use of this topographically important area from LBA to Hel, with a major focus in the Ar period. In preparation for another publication, Sigrid Deger Jalkotzy and Eva Alram-Stern (Mykenische Kommission der ?sterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Vienna) continued the study of PH finds from the Acropolis, now held in the museum at Aigion.

Aigeira: clubhouse andron to the E of the 2005 project area. The pottery collected during the survey ranged from PH to mod., with the usual absence of diagnostic Dark Age, Geo and Ar. Most of the PH pottery consisted of coarse ware of EBA type. Seventeen tracts yielded PH chipped stone tools including straight and notched blades, ovates, scrapers, points and re-touched flakes. A substantial multi-period site identified N of the mod. village of Pesada yielded PH, Myc, Cl and Rom pottery and tiles, as well as chipped stone tools and, for the 1st time in this survey, a number of fragments of sandstone and limestone grinding stones, and stone pounders (Fig. 75). The largest new site identified, dating from the Hel-Rom period, was located 700m S of Kerameies village. On the basis of the distribution of over 600 tiles, the site measured ca 250m by 160m. The large quantity of fragments of slag and furnace lining suggests an industrial area. It is of interest that ca 400m to the SW of the site our Gr colleagues investigated a deposit, which is also believed to have been an industrial installation.' Byz Kephallenia. D.

Franziska Lang (DAI Athens, Humboldt University, Berlin) and Lazaros Kolonas (General Director, Gr Antiquities Service) report on the 2005 season of survey: Tn this season, some areas of the peninsula were explored systematically, but there was also a strong emphasis on the processing of finds from previous seasons. New areas of field walking focused on mount Profitis Was and on the surround ings of anc. Palairos. As in previous years, numerous new sites were discovered, ranging from Neo to the 20th Ct. The discovery of two anc. towers provided new evidence on the anc. fortificatory system of the Plaghia peninsula. A tower S of the village of Agios Was is situated on a ridge and thus controls a strategic location, from which all of the Plaghia valley as far as Leukas is visible, as is the mountain pass linking the valley with the village of Steno to the SE. Further fortifications and towers are also visible (Sterna, Trikorfon, Ixous, Agios Georghios, Agios Athanassios). The tower measures 7m by 7m and is built of well-cut blocks, sometimes linked with U-shaped brackets. Only its foundation survives, since many blocks were incorporated as spolia in nearby houses. A further tower ('Kastraki') on the NW ridge of mount Tsouvari also measures about 7m2. This tower, however, was built of coarse blocks A room had been added to its W side. Because of its position, this tower had no or inferior visual contact with other towers and fortifications. The ceramic material suggests that both towers date to the Hel period. While the function of these structures as watchtowers is easily determined, the same cannot be said for three large walls in the Profitis Was area. They represent a wall that enclosed the mountain on the W part of its N side. It cannot be determined whether this wall originally fully enclosed the summit. The wall is heavily damaged but was probably 2m wide. It is built of loosely bonded small unworked stones. A 2nd such structure on the W slope of mount Profitis Ilias follows the contour N and then turns to the E, were it disappears in the maquis after ca 70m. It can be traced for 600m along the W slope and was built from large, roughly worked long rectangular stones. A further wall was found on the W flank of 76. Lexouri: post-Byz icon Zaimi hill and can be traced for 500m. In technique and dimensions it can be compared to the slope wall of Profitis Ilias. In spite of intensive exploration in both areas, no further walls were found, so that an originally closed ring of walling cannot be ascertained for either. At the moment, neither the function nor the chronological position of the two blocking walls can be determined. It is clear that they do not represent terrace or field walls. The similar construction technique of the Ot fortification on mount Tambouraki in the W of the peninsula may offer a possible clue regarding their dates. The identification of an Ot period village, called Agios Was according to local shepherds, is one of the most important achievements of the 2005 season. Numerous ruined houses are still visible from this village in the W foothills of mount Profitis Was. Surface material consisted of many glazed sherds of LByz and Ot dates. Additionally, there is some evidence to suggest activity already in the MByz phase, to which belongs the oldest phase of the small church of Agios Athanassios. Apart from this architectural remains, the foundations of a number of small Cl-Hel farms were drawn. Sites without architecture are also numerous around mount Was; most date to the anc. period. No contiguous anc. settlement remains were found. Thus, it can be assumed that the area was dominated by isolated farmsteads and belonged to the rural hinterland of Palairos. The 2005 season also yielded many find spots with stone artefacts, some of which are of Neo date. One site contained so much debitage that it should be identified as a production site. Two finds from among the copious surface material deserve special mention. One is the fragment of an arm belonging to a small marble statue (Fig. 77). Its find spot suggests that the statue once stood on the temple terrace above the city of Palairos. The 2nd is the fragment of a pithos rim with a workshop mark and a stamped inscription of the Greek name 'Attalu' in Latin letters (Fig. 78). This find is important for the discussion of the Romanization of the peninsula. After the 2005 season, the settlement pattern in the peninsula's centre is largely clear. The anc. city of Palairos was surrounded by two concentric zones. The 1st ring contained the necropoleis and was surrounded by an outer ring of anc. farmsteads. More farms were situated around mount Profitis Ilias. The position of the Ot village of Agios Ilias, remote and far from the coast, is especially interesting. This refuge location resembles that of the contemporaneous village of Pogonia, explored in 2002. A nearby further example of this type and location of settlement is the Ot village of Palaiochori, S of Nea Palairos.'</page><page sequence="52">52 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. 77.

Kalydon: 4 In order to produce a proper plan, the E gate was cleaned in July 2005 (Fig. 80). The gate has a lateral opening between overlapping walls in contrast to the frontal openings of the hitherto known and registered gates in Kalydon. It is placed along the E curtain near one of the towers with a w. 3-4m passage between the w. 3m curtain and a substantial square tower. The relatively simple construction of the gate indicates a date of construction in the earlier years of the 4th Ct BC, around the time Kalydon joined the Aetolian League. 80. Kalydon: E gate Geomagnetic surveys indicate that the entrance inside the wall was connected to a square, which is considered to be the commercial agora placed close to the E curtain, and a more than 200m long road leading to the central part of the town; probably a habitation quarter with an orthogonal street system. Outside the gate a road connects the town with the fields in the fertile valley towards the E and the river Evinos. Geological surveys in the area between the town and the sea have shown that the small harbour site of present-day Kryoneri, where the steep W side of mount Varassova joins the sea, must have been the harbour of Kalydon in antiquity as well. The remaining parts of the delta were filled up with inaccessible lagoons. The recent studies indicate that the E gate was the main entrance to the town, in contrast to the opinion expressed by the Gr/Danish archaeologists (Frederik Poulsen, Konstantinos Rhomaios and Ejnar Dyggve) working in Kalydon from 1926 to 1935, who considered the W gate leading to the Sanctuary of Artemis Lauria to be the main entrance. In the lower town, excavations continued in the courtyard house inside the W gate examined during the 2003 and 2004 campaigns. The aim was to trace the previously uncovered stylobate in the central part of the building further S. A further corner was found in a trench opened in the SE part of the building, indicating the construction and position of a square peristyle (Fig. 81). Between the peristyle and the S massive 81. Kalydon: corner of square peristyle ashlar wall of the building, a substantial fresh water drain came to light running from the square room in the SE corner towards the W wall. Further studies revealed that the central construc tion was in the Doric order and that the building is related to the so-called Heroon or private palaestra published by Ejnar Dyggve in 1935; but some 100 to 150 years older. A preliminary dating of the courtyard building in the lower town in the later half of the 3rd Ct BC seems reasonable. During the study campaign in 2005 the considerable amount of architectural terracotta and architectural stone was studied with help from Richard A. Tomlinson of the University of Birmingham, who worked on the material for two weeks in October. Catalogues are being prepared for the pottery, metal objects, coins and other groups of artefacts.

Investigation of the Hel houses on the E slope (built into a PH layer) revealed tiles of Laconian type and pottery of the 4th-3th Ct BC. The 1st phase of a w. 4m anc. road on the N slope dates to the 5th Ct BC. On the W slope, walls and floors of houses of the 7th Ct BC were found immediately next to two cist tombs. One, looted, is probably Byz, the other yielded rich finds (a bronze mirror with a representation of Aphrodite, a gold ring with Nike on the bezel and two figurines) of the L 4th to 3rd Ct BC.

Finds from the single inhumation in grave 22 included two bronze vessels, a kados with plastic decoration below the handles (lions and silenos) (Fig 82) and an oinochoe (Fig. 83). Pottery included a fish-plate, kantharoi, an askos of guttus type, lamps and a W slope oinochoe. From grave 25 came more W slope ware, female figurines, a lead pyxis, two silver obols of Sikyon and two gold discs. Grave 8 contained two burials, associated with pottery (kantharoi, lamps, oinochoai, a perfume flask) and an iron strigil.

Rousset (EFA) report on the topographic survey conducted as a synergasia in the region of Desphina in 2005: 'A law of Delphi of the 2nd Ct AD (published by J.-L. Ferrary and D. Rousset, BCH 122 [1998], 227-342) showed that in the Imperial period the citizens of Delphi conducted two successive land divisions on a part of the territory of their city. The region was probably divided into regular plots, some measuring 40 plethra and the others 60 plethra (1 plethron = about 900m2). This region had to be a vast estate, if not a plain, and some indications contained in the inscriptions have led the publishers of the text to suppose that the divided region could be the plateau of Desphina, in the massif of Kirphis (BCH 122 [1998], 341-42 ).</page><page sequence="55">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 55 This supposition, derived from the text, could then be confirmed or invalidated by a detailed examination of the region. The 1st phase of this examination, led by G. Tirologos with the collaboration of Vassilopoulos Andreas and Niki Evelpidou (Department of Geology of the University of Athens), consisted of the collation of the topographic cards (1/50000 and 1/5000) and satellite and aerial photographs (1/15000), and the creation of an ortho-photo plan of the region of Desphina. On these documents it has been possible to find some axes in the agricultural division, and, thanks to a statistical analysis of the distances between these axes, it has also been possible to distinguish several orthogonal plots which could be the fossilized traces of the division of the 2nd Ct AD. The photographs show a network which could be based according to a module of 1000 feet by 1200 feet, i.e. by plots of 120 plethra of surface. The results achieved through the reading of the aerial photographs needed to be verified and confirmed on the land. Our attention was directed, on one hand, toward seeing if there exist any anc. remains which might correspond to the alignments marked on the photographs and which would allow us to date this network: boundary marks limiting the paths which separated the plots, traces of ways, of terracing walls or of anc. fencing, sites in relation with the plots, etc. Our work, on the other hand, concerned the verification of the metrolog ical results calculated from the photographic documentation, by identifying on the land the alignments, if possible, and by placing them precisely on the cartographic and photographic documents according to their GPS co-ordinates. The topographic survey was carried out on a zone, w. 1.5km to 2km, /. ca 10km, in the flattest part of the plateau of Desphina. The team examined the sectors which appeared, from the aerial views, to be richest in long linear structures. On the land, these linear structures were not always easy to recognize with any degree of certainty and precision, since some zones of the region were especially rich in terracing walls or fences, paths, etc., notably around the monastery of Agiou Ioannou Prodromou and to the N of the Desphina village. This made the choice of the points difficult. It is not possible to recognize on the land a division of all or of some of the region in to regular plots, whose traces could have been fossilized, and only the future analysis of the distances between the 307 points taken for the survey will possibly confirm or not the existence of a division in regular plots of the region. We did not find any remains which could surely be considered as anc. and which could be put in relation with a regular division of the land, because the terracing walls are almost always made of the drift of rough blocks, or of blocks which did not contain any traces of anc. work. Nor did we did find remains of an anc. road. The only demarcation mark possibly contemporary to the inscription is a letter delta engraved on a rock at ca 500m to the SE of the monastery of Agiou Ioannou Prodromou: this may be read as an abbreviation of the word degmanon, which designates the paths in the law of Delphi, mentioned above, or it may simply be the abbreviation of a proper name or a numeral indication. It is necessary to note that the same letter recurs repeatedly, painted on the rocks of the neighbourhood, as a contemporary border mark. Over the whole of the surveyed region we discovered two previously unknown sites, including one on the Profitis Was summit plateau which is surrounded by an oval wall (330m by 170m) in blocks which are often of great dimension. Though this wall is not datable by masonry analysis, the pottery recovered on its surface (to be studied by R. Kolonia) indicates an occupation of the site in the Hel and Imperial periods. The other discovered site is an area ca 100m in diameter, to the SW of the church of Aghios Vlasios, which is sprinkled with pottery (to be studied by D. Skorda), but which lacks any trace of anc. constructions. We revisited also the anc. sites already known in the region, Platy Phrias, Kastrouli and Desphina, which cannot be topographically related, for the moment, with the hypothetical division of land on the plateau of Desphina.

Archie Dunn (BSA, University of Birmingham) reports on the results of the 2005 survey season at this Byz site: 'On the W coast of Boeotia, in the Koinotita of Domvraina, we began the archaeological and palaeo-environmental survey of Thisve and its environs, in collaboration with K.Koilakou (1st EBA) and Vasilis Aravantinos (9th EPCA) and the EMA. The palaeo-environmental survey is being conducted in collab oration with members of the Greek Centre for Marine Research (EKThE). The immediate aims of the archaeological survey have been to record all visible remains in and around the village of Thisve (site of the anc. city of ThisveVThisvai) and to integrate the results with information collected by the Ephoreias and with the findings of the partially published Ohio State University Thisve Basin Survey (conducted by Tim Gregory in 1979? 1984). This also included sites in and around Thisve's natural harbours (Fig. 85). The immediate aims of the palaeo-environ mental survey, which began in 2004, have been to record the sedimentary stratigraphy of the plain of Thisve, extract cores to test this stratigraphy for pollen preservation, and to supplement the palaeo-ecological fieldwork conducted in this area by Oliver Rackham for the British Academy's Survey of Boeotia during the E 1980s. These environmental studies are being conducted by Margaret Atherden (University College of York St John) in collaboration with Chrestos Anagnostou (EKThE). Archaeological and environmental fieldwork were spread over three weeks in November 2004 and July 2005, and form the 1st stage of a collaborative response to questions posed by the reported archaeology of Thisve and its surroundings and by new Byz and post-Byz historical material identified by Dunn. The pre-Cl upper acropolis, and the Gr-Rom polis situated between the upper and lower acropoles, controlled a monumental dam along the line of the road between 'Kineta' and 'Limeri' (archaeological feature no. 19). The plain of Thisve is a completely enclosed Basin (polje) which was partially flooded for at least part of the year until the 1960s. The dam, and flood management, are reported by Strabo and Pausanias, and by post-Med travellers. Much of the W part of the plain ('Limeri') lies within a gated industrial estate, but the E part ('Kineta'), was subjected to intensive survey by Gregory. The dam meanwhile was shown by Professor Knauss to have anc. and Rom or post-Rom phases. Gregory's rural sites, which 85.

Thisve/Kastorion: EByz W Boiotia are all to the S of 'Kineta', suggest, as checked by us in 2005, the configuration of the long-term inundations E of the multi period dam. The long-term relationship across the small territorium of Thisve between flood-management, land-use and the total settlement-pattern is a challenging problem. The rela tionship will have been complicated by significant changes in the fortunes of post-Rom Thisve, which can, for the 1st time, be traced in outline in the sources. It can now be shown that the polis of Thisve in EByz times became part of a dense network of new fortresses built upon the sites of anc. towns or fortifications (Fig. 86); that by the L 9th Ct AD Thisve was the village (k?m?) inhabited by farmers, where the famous saint Osios Loukas grew up; that the k?m? had advanced to become a bishopric by the 12th Ct; that both were called Kastorion; that it was a village again by the time of the 1st Ot census in 1455; and that possibly throughout these changes of status and function Thisve's great natural harbour flourished as a centre of maritime traffic. Its Med names are also now identifiable in the sources. Gregory located these harbourside sites. It must also be relevant that the M and LByz name 'Kastorion' is itself the Byz name for the monopoly controlled imperial purple dye extracted from the murex purpurea shellfish, an extraction for which Boeotia and the gulf of Corinth were famous in the M Ages. Dumps of murex purpurea are clearly visible at Thisve-Kastorion. The challenge to which this Synergasia addresses itself therefore is to trace Thisve-Kastorion's several changes of status and function within the context of land-use in and around the enclosed Thisve basin and of its sequence of loci of maritime traffic. The palynologist Dr Atherden and the sedimentologist Dr Anagnostou extracted, with assistance, cores at four locations, including 'Limeri', 'Kineta', and site no. 49, another monumental anc. and Med dam recorded by Knauss. They used Dutch, Russian and Hiller manual augers. Sites of extraction were mapped by Christopher Mavromatis (University of Birmingham). Three manmade vertical cuttings, reaching in one case to 12m below ground level, were also recorded. And Atherden began supplementing her and Rackham's earlier records of actual vegetation in and around the plain to a height of 900m asl (the village of Agia Anna, our base). Atherden reports that unfortunately pollen preservation is poor in the four shallow cores. The manmade cuttings reveal two distinct horizons of disturbance (layers of re-deposited stone) within deep deposits of finely sorted terra rossa. No peaty lenses associable with year-round inundation are visible at any depth so far around 'Kineta', which might suggest that subterranean sinkholes existed on the S (seaward) side of the basin. The archaeologists concentrated on the identification and mapping of Thisve-Kastorion's visible remains, and the integration of these with Gregory's and Knauss's published findings within a single digitized cartographic and archaeolog ical database. Christopher Mavromatis is creating this database, into which the GPS co-ordinates of 50 sites and monuments were entered in 2005. Twenty four monumental structures, complexes or features were located in and around mod. Thisve within the agreed zone of prospection, including, of course, the well-known upper and lower acropoles. Only sketch-plans of these acropoles have ever been published (by the DAI in 1958). This great urban cluster is dominated by the substantial remains often E, M and M-LByz or Fr churches. Another Byz church is known to underlie the mod. church of the Panagia. This urban cluster also includes complexes of rock-cut chamber tombs and two monumental Med cisterns. Not yet mapped and numbered are a vast complex of post-Byz threshing floors, the murex purpurea dumps and rock-cut chamber tombs by the upper acropolis. The W and E edges of the mod. village are also still unrecorded. Gregory's reported clusters of rural sites S of 'Kineta' and E of 'Agios Athanasios' were relocated, but the latter cluster was re-interpreted by us as eleven sites instead of his four. Between the two Byz harbours in the bays of Nousa and Agios Ioannis (sites 35 and 48) we insert, in the light of the mid 10th Ct Life of Osios Loukas, the approximate site of one of the saint's long-term eremitical kalyvai."

Vlachoyianni (ADelt, 326-29) report on rescue excavations in two locations. At the Fili plot, excavation of the W gate of the fortification wall was undertaken following earlier surface and geophysical survey. The gate stood between two rectangular towers (or promachones) 10m apart. Finds from the wall of a structure and from the earliest phase of the road immediately to the E and inside the building date the fortification to the 4th Ct BC, perhaps to the time of Philipp II of Maced?n. Excavation in the Katsara plot, in the area of the Kastro and the Megali Vrysi (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 45) revealed two rectangular Rom structures, one (A, 6.4m by 4.9m) earlier than the other (B, 5.3m by 4.55m) which abuts it. Though there were no finds to date either structure, their method of construction (opus caementicium) suggest a date in the 2nd Ct AD. These structures overlay an earlier grave, associated with residual fragments of marble, animal bones, etc, and an apothetis containing animal bones, Hel pottery, tile, marble fragments, and a piece of limestone inscribed [ ] B [ ] / [ ] AIOK [ ] in Cl</page><page sequence="58">58 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL.

The cist grave 2 contained three burials, lamps, perfume flasks, iron strigils and gold leaves, the trench grave 3 merely a glass perfume flask, a lamp and a strigil. Thebes. As well as noting changes to the museum, V Aravantinos and E. Koundouri (ADelt, 310-24) report on excavations in ten locations within this Myc, Ar, Cl and Hel city and settlement, largely within the Kadmeia. At the museum extension site, 50 more Byz and post-Byz pits yielded earlier finds, including a LHel marble philosopher's head, perfume flasks and stratified LRom and EByz pottery. One 6.8m stretch (w. 0.64-1.56m, h. 3.35m) of one large wall, and another of 4.5m represent two parts of the Byz/Med forti fication of the city, incorporating earlier spolia; another earlier (LH) 11m stretch of wall (w. 3m) represents the Myc fortifica 87.

Two further (BA?) stone terraces and more Byz walls were found, and a LH IIIA1 trench grave of a child (grave 6) yielded an alabastron and miniature kyathos (Fig. 87). At O. Zengini 3, the 'Oplothiki' plot, near to where Linear B tablets had earlier been found, post-Byz and Byz layers, a LCI destruction horizon (Alexander's?), Cl and Myc layers were revealed. Of three LH I graves (one cist, two trench), only one (the cist grave 2) (Fig. 88) contained datable pottery (Fig. 89). Nearby, finds from a BA floor level with a hearth yielded seventeen MH wheelmade and handmade pots. Other finds from the area include obsidian, flint, bone tools and two figurines. Similarly, at the junction of O. Oidopodos and Pelopidou (Kylafi plot) Byz levels overlay LEH and MH strata; finds included EH and MH pottery, blades and small tools in obsidian and flint. At the junction of O. Oidipodos and Amphionos (M?tala plot) a small cemetery of (ECh?/EByz) seventeen trench inhumations and nine tile graves lay next to a (Byz?) chapel with apse. MRom (2nd Ct AD) levels were reached in places. At the adjoining Spourli plot, successive strata from EH to MRom times were revealed. EH pottery and house remains came from the lowest stratum, shapes including phiales with T rim profiles, some burnished, pithoi and askoi. Above this a MH level yielded grey Minyan ware and several trench inhumations, mostly without grave goods, though one child's grave contained several hemispherical one-handled kyathoi, a spherical pyxis with lid and a bronze dress pin with a rock crystal head. Above this was a LH IIIA-B destruction horizon, containing architectural remains and fragments of painted wall plaster (some with hunting and female procession scenes). Associated pottery included high-footed kylikes, type A skyphoi and tripod cooking vessels, other finds comprising Psi figurines and steatite beads. Above were Cl and then Hel (3rd Ct BC) destruction horizons, and finally a MRom complex of drains; associated pottery included terra sigillata of the 1st and 2nd Cts AD. Outside the Kadmeia.

Finds include PH, Cl and</page><page sequence="59">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 59 Hel pottery; figurines; bronzes; beads; iron nails (from coffins?) and bone and glass objects. Further along this road, at the Tsalla plot, 185 graves of Geo, Ar, Cl, Hel and Rom times were investigated. Graves were of all types (46 tile, 43 pyre cremations, 30 cist inhumations, 41 trench graves, 24 enchytrismoi and one larnax burial). The majority of the five Geo graves were adult trench inhumations, with grave goods including bronze dress pins. The custom of placing infants and small children in small vessels in trenches (enchytrismos) begins in LGeo times and continues. Of the 120 Ar and Cl examples, Ar graves are either adult cremations, adult inhumations in pithoi, or children's inhumations in amphorae, though adult trench inhumations continue. Cremations tend to be more richly furnished than other Ar graves, with finds including alabastra, small lekythoi, black-glaze kantharoi, Boeotian kylikes and horse figurines. Apart from some iron strigils, jewellery is rare. Two unusual cremations (graves 17 and 100) yielded over 100 terracotta plaques with traces of fire, perhaps representing the decoration on the funeral bier or coffin. A particularly rich LAr child's enchytrismos (grave 118) yielded black-glaze kantharoi and terracotta figurines of cocks, tortoises, birds, horses and satyrs (Fig. 90). In the Cl period, more trench graves are found and the tile grave is introduced, normally covered with tiles of Laconian type. There is Cl child's burial in a clay larnax (grave 162). Of the 54 Hel and seven Rom graves, the majority are of the tile and trench types, though cist graves again become more common. Rich Hel graves contain objects from all over the Hel world, including lagynoi and Hadra hydria (Fig. 91), as well as iron strigils. And the richest graves are those of LHel/ERom period, such as grave 30 with its array of pottery, lamps, perfume flasks lagynoi, amphora of Macedonian type, relief skyphoi and Tanagra type figurines, or grave 104 of the L 1st Ct BC, with its gold disc and array of glasswares (Fig. 92). 90.

Finds were generally sparse, and some graves were looted. Two earlier re-used grave stelae, inscribed KAAAiriTA and nOAOTKAIAAS served as covers for the Hel 'double cist' graves (270 and 271), and another grave stele, inscribed nOATNIKA was found nearby. 92.

Work concentrated on the study for publication of the finds stored in the apotheke of the Karystos Museum, with limited revisiting of PH sites to verify map co-ordinates, architectural plans and measurements, and to take photographs for publication. Catherine Perl?s of the University of Paris 10 - Nanterre completed her study and drawing of the chipped and ground stone from the twelve, mostly small, coastal and upland, PH sites found by the survey. Her results indicate that eleven of the sites date exclusively to the Final Neo and EBA; one, a larger hill site, also has a MBA component. Tracey Cullen of ASCSA and Lauren Talalay of the University of Michigan began the cataloguing of the Final Neo to EBA pottery from the sites. Zarko Tankosic of ASCSA and Indiana University studied the material from the MBA site.

Several walls of a Rom building complex (ADelt, 343-44) were investigated at Nea Styra, Lefka (Fanoudi plot). Finds include red-painted and plain Rom pottery, amphorae, metal tools and glassware. Agios Nikolaos (Styra) Survey. Maria Chidiroglou (11th EPCA) and Sylvian Fachard (Swiss School) report on a topo graphical survey carried out in 2004. Activities of illegal excavations were noticed and reported to 11th EPCA, which planned a small excavation to assess the scale of the damage. A joint Gr-Swiss diagnostic excavation was conducted in April 2005, under the direction of M. Chidiroglou. The report includes the results of the survey and excavation. 'Near the summit of mount Kliosi (682m as!) and SE from the mod. village of Styra is located a Cl fortress, known since the 19th Ct AD, but never thoroughly studied or drawn. The slopes of the mountain are known for their anc. remains, mainly the Drakospita at Palli Lakka and the Rom cipollino quarries. The fortified perimeter (310m) encloses an area of ca 0.35ha. The fortress is composed of two curtain walls running E-W between two limestone peaks; each side is protected by a small projecting tower. An impressive gate, made of cipollino marble blocks, is preserved to a h. of 3.5m. The masonry is irregular trapezoidal with use of triangular chinking stones. A stone plan and the main conserved elevations were drawn. Two trenches perpendicular to the S wall revealed that the natural stone was carved and flattened to support the foundations. Filling from the foundations revealed a fragment of a black-glaze skyphos dating to the E 4th Ct BC. Pottery from trench 2 revealed a similar date, which should be kept as a tpq for the construction of the fortress. Destruction layers include much stone-cutting debris and Byz-Med pottery. They suggest that the blocks of the facings and the stone filling of the wall were re-used elsewhere, probably for the construction of the Med fortress situated to the E. In trench 3, located at the gate, the circulating levels have been carried away by erosion. The goal of trench 4 was to investigate an interior building in order to learn more about its dating and function (barracks?). Although anc. pottery and tiles were found, the lack of conserved layers prevents a solid dating. Enjoying a panoramic view over the whole region, as well as Attica, the fortress was situated at a strategic location controlling the Eretrian S border and the main anc. track to Karystos. It was probably built by the Eretrian state after the annexation of Styra, which took place ca 400. Intensive survey was carried over the whole hill-top E of the fortress. The main Med structures (a church, buildings, houses, a cistern and a fortification wall) were added to the schematic plan. The name of the site is preserved on Venetian maps and known as Armena or Larmena. Byz and Med pottery and a an Ot coin were collected. The main discovery was the existence of a great concentra tion of Cl black-glaze and Hel pottery from an artificially flattened rocky plateau. Stone-wall foundations and rock cuttings are visible. Red-painted and black-painted tiles were discovered, the oldest dating to the 5th Ct BC, as well as a fragment of inscription. The high quality of the finds (Fig. 94) from this supposed bothros is striking in such a remote and mountainous area. Stone blocks with a broached d?cor belonging to an anc. building were re-used in the church and the Venetian walls. The existence of a small mountain-top sanctuary is not to be excluded. Based on mountain cults in Greece, Zeus would be a good candidate. This hypothesis is supported by two L inscriptions found in Styra and on the W slopes of mount Kliosi (IG XII, 9, 58, 59), mentioning Zeus Hyps is tos. A sounding in the bothros revealed that the accu mulation of pottery resulted from a single deposit. A clean-up 94.

Among the finds are fragments of a 5th Ct BC rf krater, 4th Ct BC black-painted bowls, black-painted tiles, parts of beehive walls, fragments of Rom coarse ware, as well as Byz pottery.

Finds of pottery and a bronze coin at the known Cl complex at Kambos Aliveriou (Bibika plot) date the ashlar wall to LCI (4th Ct BC) times. Further cleaning of the Myc tholos tomb at Katakalou, the LRom grave at Platoma and the LCI tower at Rifi also took place (ADelt, 347). Eretria. A. Psalti (ADelt, 341-42) reports on the excavation of part of a Hel (2nd Ct BC) house with a mosaic floor at O. Isidos (Korachai plot). Finds include Hel pottery, a glass bead and bronze coins. Claude L?derrey and Karl Reber (Swiss School, University of Lausanne), report on renewed excavations in the W quarter conducted in 2005: 'The main objective was to explore the Geo layers beneath the remains of the Cl-Hel houses III and IV (B/600-700) excavated decades ago. Although interesting Geo finds had been sporadically discovered by previous excavators in this area, no Geo walls had been identified. Under these circum stances, some scholars considered that the W quarter was not inhabited during the Geo period. During the excavation, thirteen trenches of different sizes were opened. Six of them revealed walls that could be dated from the Geo period. The foundation of an apsidal building (Fig. 95) was found directly under Hel walls in the E wing of house IV Interestingly enough, no Ar layer was excavated in this trench: Cl and Hel layers are situated directly above the Geo stratum. The foundations of the house are approximately w. 0.4m, h. 0.2m; when reconstructed, the building would have been 7.5m by 5m in size. Within the foundation, no entrance was found. Covering the former floor of the house, sections of the collapsed mud-brick walls were excavated inside the building. Fragmented sherds and obsidian tools were uncovered on the floor of the building. W of the apsidal building a rectangular wall was discovered (w. 0.4m, h. 0.2m, /. 4.5m). Again, no Ar layer was revealed in this trench. As the apsidal house, the wall was built on the 95. Eretria: foundations of apsidal building natural reddish clay soil and dates to the Geo period (several soil samples were taken for analyses). There is no evidence that this wall was formerly connected with the house. Probably this wall belonged to a peribolos, which was once constructed around the apsidal building. Two sections of Geo walls were found S of the apsidal building in two separate trenches. One of them is apsidal, and was excavated in 1971 by Lilly Kahil. It remains difficult to assess whether these walls belonged to two different houses or to periboloi. In another trench near the walls of Hel house III, the excavation revealed three Geo hearths within a radius of 8m. It seems that each of them served different purposes. A layer of melted bronze was observed in the 1st hearth; the 2nd was covered with mud-bricks, and revealed an important quantity of fine ceramic sherds and bones in a thick ashy layer. A well was discovered between these three structures and the apsidal building mentioned above. It was filled with hundreds of Geo sherds and other artefacts. Although not entirely excavated during the campaign, the well reinforces the hypothesis that the S part of Eretria's W quarter was settled in the Geo period. In addition to the Geo finds, some Cl and Hel structures were also excavated. Two Hel hearths were found in the central courtyard of Hel house IV: they contained some miniature skyphoi (Fig. 96) and burned animal bones. These offerings and ritual pratice probably took place during the renovation of house IV (ca 300 BC). A clay oven was discovered just a step aside from these two structures. A direct relationship between the oven and the fireplaces remains difficult to assert. 96. Eretria: Hel miniature skyphoi</page><page sequence="62">62 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. An Hel water-pipe, dug beneath the anc. street, is related to house I. The structure, formed by a line of Laconian tiles, runs parallel to the S wall of house IV. This pipe is connected to a small rectangular stone construction, in which the waste water of house IV was first gathered, before flowing E through the water-pipe. A T well was found in the N part of the excavation area, and seems to date to the Hel period. The structure is part of room P of Hel house I, bordering house IV to the N.' Eretria, Chora. Sylvian Fachard (Swiss School) reports on the 2nd season of survey in the Chora of Eretria: 'The fortified site of Vrysi (La Cuppa, Dragonara) stands on a rocky promontory at the SE end of the Mavrovouni range (anc. mount Kotylaion?), overlooking a fertile plain at the end of the Manikia gorges. A stone plan of the Cl walls was drawn for the 1st time, while the Byz and Med walls were reported on a schematic plan. An intensive survey revealed a broken line of walls defending an area of 4ha. An important part of the site is naturally defended by high cliffs, which were never walled. The 2a-2b curtains are the best preserved, each of them including a postern secured by a small bastion. The masonry (irregular trapezoidal, with polygonal blocks and chinking stones) could date to the 4th Ct BC. This section seems to be an extension of the primitive circuit: it was probably built in order to include a natural spring inside the walls. The lack of anc. pottery is striking, and suggests that no Cl-Hel settlement existed intra muros. Yet, archaeological and epigraphic evidence tends to show that a settlement did exist in the area, probably the deme-centre of Kotylaion. On the basis of our survey, it should not be localized inside the walls of Vrysi. Since the fortified area exceeds the needs of a simple fortress, the walls were probably intended to offer a protected space of large expanse: a fortified acropolis capable of accommodating in troubled times the population of the surroundings demes, their flocks and crops. This strategically important site is close to the border; it watches over the gorges, an anc. track leading to Chalkis, and is among the richest land of the Eretrian chora. The fortress's strategic role was increased by the adjunction of a 2nd fortified circuit some 300m W, at Kastri. There, the mountain ridge is delimited by vertiginous cliffs at the N and S. A 24m long curtain wall, ended by a 9.8m by 7m tower, stretches between the two cliffs. Defense is useless to the S, but a curtain wall of/. 100m was built to the N. A postern, w. 0.9m, is found near the tower, which was accessible by a staircase, /. 9m. The walls are ca w. 2.65m. Masonry is trapezoidal to polygonal, with chinking stones; corners (tower and postern) are drafted. The work is quite similar to that of Vrysi (posterns 2a and 2b), so a contemporary date for both is very likely. A Med tower was added to the S, and new walls were built over the Cl plinth using stone, brick and mortar. No anc. sherds were discovered inside the fortress. This stronghold supplements the defense of Vrysi, by preventing an attacker from occupying the elevated plateau of Kastri and dominating its defenders. The military fortress could have also served as a garrison for ephebes, a base for patrolling the mountainous borders, as well as a last place of refuge for civilians. The Sarakinokastro mountain (509m as I) is located opposite the walls of Kastri and Vrysi (1.3km), closing the gorges of Manikia to the S. A rubble enceinte is situated at the summit. It is the largest known in the territory of Eretria: 162m by 85m, for a total area of 9,700m2. Despite its mediocre state of conservation, a double facing wall with interior packing/filling can still be made out; its w. averages between 2.2m and 3m. Heavy vegetation makes survey of the internal area difficult to complete. No internal structure has been reported. A stone mill, coarse ware pottery and a Byz sherd were among the surface finds. Without excavation, this site will remain impossible to date. The view is impressive, as it dominates the region, a part of the border between Chalkis and Eretria, the bay of Aliveri and the great plain between Avlonari and Oxylithos. The importance of this fortified ensemble can be explained by its position: situated near the border and dominating two important communication routes, it may have played a role as a military fort, and/or a place of refuge in more recent times. Remains of fortifications have been known at Loupaka (W shore of lake Dystos) since the 19th Ct AD. The site occupies a rocky overhang controlling a narrow pass between the lake and the mountains. W of the ridge, a long wall can be followed for 100m, which turns E and joins a rocky pick. No wall has been found further S, so that the layout remains open, without encircling the hill. The structure is composed of a retaining wall and an internal fill, forming a terrace 4m to 6m wide. The masonry is made of massive blocks wedged by small stones. Some elevations are conserved to a h. of 4m. Both the monumental size of the blocks and the masonry style are reminiscent of 'cyclopean' fortifications. Surface finds are poor: obsidian flakes and a few sherds of no clear conclusive date. The rocky surface of the hill is uninhabitable, except for a small rock-cut terrace at the top. The hypothesis of a civilian settlement must be rejected. This imposing structure seems to be of military conception, functioning as a 'long-wall' built to watch over, or block, the passageway on the W shore of lake Dystos. An old track was discovered at the foot of the N wall. The Loupaka fortification could be linked with a communica tion route, as its 'open' disposition seems to aim at blocking the pass rather than encircling a settlement or a hill-top. Further S, a Cl and Hel site occupied the Loupaka saddle (80m asl). The construction of an electricity pylon has destroyed any surface remains, but a concentration of black-glaze pottery and black /red-glaze tiles indicates a lasting occupation, a farm or a small settlement. These remains could also suggest that the Loupaka wall was re-occupied during these periods. A date for the wall must be secured in the future. If an LH date can be shown, Loupaka would become the 1st Myc military wall in Euboea. Lefkandi (with Vasiliko). A. Charapaschalidou (ADelt, 339-40) notes further (EIA?) cremations at the Kytinou plot, which may belong the Palia Perivolia cemetery. Further test excavations in the area (see also ADelt, 346-47) produced no finds. Lefkandi, Xeropolis. I. Lemos (University of Oxford, BSA) reports on the 2005 season of survey and excavation: 'A priority this year was to understand the anc. landscape of the area. To this end, a geo-archaeological project and a geophysical investigation were undertaken. The 2nd objective was to complete an intensive study of the excavations conducted in 2003 and 2004. The goal of the geo-archaeological project this year was the understanding of the environmental history of the tell. In close collaboration with Professor Davidson and Dr Wilson our objective had two parts: to assess the nature of soil erosion from the tell; and to investigate the shape of the anc. coastline around the tell. One central issue is whether there was a natural harbour to the E and an isthmus to the W of the area under investigation, with water along much of the N side of the tell. This investigation was carried out in the narrow valley immediate NE of Xeropolis. The presence of water to the N is confirmed. At different times its precise extent varied and at some points in time there may have been an enclosed or partly enclosed lagoon. In the light of the exposed nature of the coast,</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 63 the lagoon may well have had a shingle ridge on the seaward side. It is also possible for there to have been a similar lagoon to the NW of Xeropolis. If this was the case, then the palaeo geography suggests an isthmus. The reconstruction of the anc. landscape, however, is complex and the overall extent and the nature of the sea's presence requires further work. In the course of excavating one of the trenches during this year's geo-archaeological investigation, a surprising discovered was made. This was the finding, for the first time at Lefkandi, of LGeo burials. We excavated two burials, both of children. One burial was an enchytrismos, buried in neck-handled amphora (Fig. 97), and the other an inhumation (Fig. 98). Interestingly, following the practice of burials at Eretria and Pithekoussai, the 2nd burial was given a Near E seal. From the area of the burials a large quantity of good quality LGeo pottery was found. The geophysical survey was conducted on the top of Xeropolis, primarily on land which has been purchased. The results are not only extremely interesting but also encouraging. The preliminary data obtained suggests a number of architec tural features below the surface which help us to plan future excavations on Xeropolis. In region II, where the geophysical survey was conducted, an intensive surface collection was also carried out. The study of the material from this survey will provide comparative data to assess the relationship of the density of finds on the surface with the results produced by the geophysical investigation. Finally a rigorous study season was also conducted this year. It incorporated a number of projects: design and application of a database for the archaeological context (including excavation and architectural units, finds, environ mental and other related information); design of a database for recording pottery units and their fabric; conservation of pottery and small finds from the excavations of 2003, 2004 and 2005; drawing of pottery and other finds; and, finally, sorting of the residue material recovered from the soil flotation process in the excavations of 2003-2005. In addition, a number of areas excavated previously were studied in order to understand their stratigraphy and chronology.' I. Lemos also reports on further study towards the publication of Lefkandi, Toumba: 'A study season was undertaken at the Museum of Eretria in the spring and summer of 2005. In the spring (from 3 to 18 April) a number of specialists were involved in studying material from the Toumba cemetery. In particular Hartmut Matth?us (University of Erlangen-N?rnberg) and Gisela Schumacher-Matth?us (Westf?lisches Museum f?r Arch?ologie, M?nster) studied the metal vases. Professor Matth?us reports: 'The finds comprise locally produced types of metalwork, for example undecorated hemispherical bowls, as well as imports from the E. The tomb contexts will help to clarify the chronological position of the imports, burial customs (male/female/child burials) and aspects of daily life (e.g., the role of banquets in Euboean society of the time) as well as social behaviour.' Andrew Reyes (Groton and Oxford University) studied the Near E seals. He reports: 'The seals from Lefkandi contribute much to our understanding of glyptic fashions current in Euboea and add significantly to our knowledge of the connections between that island and the E Mediterranean. With the publication and analysis of several glyptic corpora over the past decades from sites across the Mediterranean, the Levant and Mesopotamia, we are now in a position to add more detailed information with regard to Euboean practices and foreign relations.' ^ 97.

Aliveriou (Spyrou plot) a 6.5m stretch of an anc. road, w. 3m, was surrounded by walls, one yielding parts of a (Cl-Hel) marble grave stele. In the area of Agios Stephanos at the site of the new bus station (at the junction of O. Arethousas and Styron) two LCl-Hel structures were uncovered. E-MHel structure I seems to have been horizon, perhaps associated with the campaign of Claudius Cento. The LCl-Hel structure II seems was founded in the 4th Ct BC. Mortars, cisterns and other finds suggest both structures may have been workshops. A similar LCl-Hel structure with seven rooms came to light in the area of Agios Ioannis (O. Zois, Lagou plot). While finds of 4th Ct pottery, loomweights and lamps could indicate that it was a house, finds of shells of murex brandaris may indicate again that it served as a dye workshop. The function of the LHel-ERom structure in the Delta area (junction of O. Agias Paraskevis and Messapion, Alexiou plot) is also ambiguous.</page><page sequence="64">64 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL.

Van de Moortel (ASCSA, University of Tennessee) report on the 2nd (2005) season of excavation at this BA/EIA settlement, located on a a tidal islet of 3.6ha on the N Euboean gulf about 140km N of Athens, 50km N of the Myc palatial centre of Thebes and 20km NE of the important Myc centre of Orchomenos. 'A 1988-1989 surface survey by Cornell University recovered pottery and other finds of high quality. The site had not been excavated before. Our 2004 (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 52-55) and 2005 excavations have confirmed that Mitrou is one of only a handful of sites on the Gr mainland with an unin terrupted sequence of BA and EIA strata, and thus an ideal place to study crucial and poorly understood periods of transition in Gr PH. An electrical resistivity survey done in 2003 by G. Tsokas of the University of Thessaloniki had revealed the existence, in the NE area of the islet, of what seems to be an enclosed, organized town with a large megaron-type structure. In 2004 we exposed 124m2 and in 2005 we opened up ca 276m2 more of this area to a total of ca 400m2, staying within the boundaries of land plots 10 and 12 slated for expropriation. Before excavating each trench we conducted a close-grained pick-up vacuum survey of its surface in 2.5m by 2.5m squares. A similar survey was carried out over the entire area E of the trenches to the E scarp of the islet. In all, 36 squares were surveyed in 2005 (squares LN-LQ782-787 and LR-LX782-785). Most of the walls uncovered date to the final phase of the BA (LH IIIC) and EIA (ProtoGeo), but some go back to the LH IIIA, LH I?II, and MH phases. Already in 2004 we noticed a high degree of continuity in spatial use from the LH I through MProtoGeo phases. This picture was confirmed in 2005 and extended back into the MH period. All 52 walls uncovered thus far have a similar NNE-SSW or WNW-ESE orientation, suggesting continuity in urban layout for 700 years or more. In 2004 we noticed that most ProtoGeo walls had been placed on top of LH IIIC walls, as if property boundaries had remained the same during the BA-EIA transition. In 2005 we observed this phenomenon also for the palatial and prepalatial periods. LH IIIC walls had been built on top of LH IIIA and LH IIB or earlier walls (trenches LN785, LN786 and LP784), and LH IIIA walls had been constructed on top of MH walls (trench LN784 NW extension). Another remarkable example of continuity discovered in 2004 was the fact that large apsidal ProtoGeo building A had been built inside the ruins of LH IIIC building B, re-using some of its walls (trenches LN783 and LN784). Both are the largest structures of their settlements, and thus possibly ?lite buildings. Such degree of continuity in architectural layout and spatial use from the MBA into the EIA is so far unprecedented on the Myc Gr mainland. Amidst this evidence for continuity, the scarcity of LH IIIB (13th Ct BC) architectural remains is striking. We have uncovered to date only three very small walls and partial dirt floors dating to this ceramic phase (trenches LM785 and LP784). The superposition of LH IIIC walls on LH IIIA and earlier walls indicates that LH IIIB occupation was lacking in most of the excavated area. It is of course possible that the inhabitants of Mitrou lived elsewhere on the site during that phase. However, one wonders if the 13th Ct was a period of decline for Mitrou, perhaps related to an expansion of territorial power on the part of the Myc centres of Thebes or Orchomenos, which experienced their acme at that time. It is possible that we have a LH IIIA2 E destruction horizon at Mitrou, and this may be historically significant, although it is too early to tell whether this destruction was due to human violence. In spite of many unknowns, our findings thus far support Sigrid Deger-Jalkotzy's conclusion that the area of the N Euboean gulf, being located on the fringes of Myc society, was strong only during times when the power of the large Myc palatial centres was weak. The most extensive remains brought to light date to three important periods in Gr PH: the prepalatial or formative stage of Myc palatial society, including the so-called 'shaft grave period' (MH III-LH II ceramic phases; ca 1700/1650 to ca 1400 BC), an early stage of the fully developed palatial period (LH IIIA2 E; E 14th Ct BC), and the post-palatial period with the disintegration of palatial society in the final BA and the transition to the simpler polities of the EIA (LH IIIC through MProtoGeo; ca 1200-940 BC). Prepalatial MH-LHII. The oldest remains found at the site thus far are MH. In 2005, MH II remains were found below the floors of the monumental LH I building complex in the NW of the islet (test trench LF790). A hard clay surface was exposed at ca +3.75-3.80 (base of SU 015), but no pottery was recovered. This surface had been cut through by a circular pit in which a large cist grave was set (tomb 10), which contained the remains of a disturbed adult male burial but no grave goods (burial 13). Since the lowest fill from the grave (SU 020 and 021) was of MH II date and presumably dates the construction of the tomb, this lowest floor in LF790 must be of MH II date or earlier. Cist 10 had been covered by a large conglomerate capstone. A nearby cist grave exposed in the E baulk of trench LF790 has not yet been excavated. It is possible that it was responsible for intrusive LH I material below the clay floor (SU 018 and 019).</page><page sequence="65">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 65 MH architectural remains also were found in 2005 in a deep sounding in the NW extension of trench LN784. They consisted of two parallel walls associated with a dirt surface at ca +4.00-4.20 and a stratum with pits underneath (SU 075). The presence of a thick black layer and a red-burned clay layer covering these remains shows that they had been destroyed by fire. The pottery of the unit with the pits below the dirt surface (SU 075) is MH in date, dating the construction of this surface to M H or later. The flotation samples from the burned layer contained many carbonized seeds. In the 2005 season we uncovered for the first time substantial remains of the LH I phase, showing beyond a doubt that Mitrou is a very important site for studying the emergence of Myc palatial society. At the major Myc centres of the Gr mainland, this stage is known primarily through graves (including the well-known shaft graves at Mycenae), because settlements or ?lite buildings have been largely covered or destroyed by later palatial structures. In contrast, at Mitrou we discovered one or two monumental buildings as well as a settlement dating to this period. Below the NE corner of building B, in trenches LP784, LP783, and L0782, we uncovered an imposing wall, up to 1.10m wide and at least 12m long, that appears to be part of a large structure. A dirt surface abutting this wall to the E in trench LP784, at ca +4.95, is of LH IIB date to judge by fragments of an Ephyraean goblet, a patterned alabastron and a Marine style closed vase found inside it (SU 048 and 049). This surface, however, is not the original exterior surface of the large building. A mass of what looks like disintegrated mud-brick and plaster flowing from the top of the N W corner of this building continues to the S below the LH IIB surface, showing beyond doubt that the building had been constructed and suffered a 1st destruction before the LH IIB surface was laid. Thus this large building must date to LH IIB or earlier. Even more impressive is a buried architectural complex of apsidal shape and monumental dimensions, ca 32m by 24m, discovered by magnetometric survey in the NW of the islet (Fig. 99). A 2m by 5m test trench (LF790) dug in the NW corner of its apsidal part has shown that this complex has three architectural phases, all dating to the LH I ceramic phase (floors at ca +4.65, +4.28 and +4.15). If its identity is confirmed by continued excavation, it would be the earliest securely dated monumental building complex of the shaft grave period ever found, and the earliest with a completely preserved plan. Nearby, in the W scarp of the islet, Eleni Zachou and Olga Kyriazi had identified in 1999 the remains of a settlement ofMHIII/LHIdate. A LH I or earlier wall (top at ca +4.90) covered by a LH II surface had been found in 2004 in trench LL786 in the NW corner of the excavation area in the centre of the islet, and a LH I stratum had been encountered about 5m. to the S in trench LL785 at the bottom of ProtoGeo cist tomb 4, at ca +4.60. E palatial LH IIIA2 E. Two large and two small floor deposits associated with architectural remains are datable to this sub-phase. In 2005 we made a deep sounding in the NW extension of trench LN784 (SU 50, 53, 55, 59, 60, 62, 64, 66, 67, 68). Two parallel rubble walls formed a corridor with an earthen floor at ca +4.70. On this floor was a dense deposit of 33 restorable vases, including kylikes, kraters and cooking pots (ca +4.70-5.20). Only three kylikes had complete profiles. With the vases were the articulated body of a piglet as well as two figurine fragments, the handle of a small marble vase, a stone grinding slab and grinder, an obsidian blade, two loomweights, a conical green steatite bead and carbonized seeds. It is difficult to interpret this deposit, since only part of it has been uncovered, and its surrounding area is not yet known. 99. Mitrou: overview of site This deposit is contemporary with a deposit of 26 burned vases, a bone button, spindle-whorl and two pounding stones found in 2004 ca 9m further E, in trench LL784-785 (see also the 2004 report by Margaretha Kramer-Hajos). The deposit of trench LN784 is similar in its range of fabrics and ceramic classes, but there is a difference in the distribution of its pattern painted decoration. Whereas its kylikes are pattern-painted and its closed vases tend to be plain, just the opposite is true for the LL784-785 deposit. The two deposits also differ in that the vases from LL784-785 were burned, they were found at a higher elevation, from +5.24 to +5.37, and they were not lying in situ on a floor, but had been dumped on top of a soft sandy layer. Less than 5m to the NNE of the deposit in trench LN784, and lying on a dirt surface associated with the N continuation of the E wall in trench LN784, was a small but clean LH IIIA2 E deposit in trench LN785 (SU 016, 17, 018). Three vases were inventoried. This surface was situated at a much higher elevation than that in trench LN784 (ca +5.45). Some 15m to the SE, in trench LP783 was a WNW-ESE wall and a surface at ca +5.05-5.15 littered with pottery of the same date (SU 15 and 16). Only three pieces from this deposit were inventoried, but more mendable pieces may be found in the N and E baulks of the trench. These four deposits were similar in character, and it is conceivable that they are part of a LH IIIA2 E destruction horizon at the site. They provide welcome information about a phase that is not particularly well represented at other excavated Myc sites.</page><page sequence="66">66 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. A preliminary analysis of the pottery from trench L0785 suggests that also here are LH IIIA surfaces situated at a fairly high level. Thus it looks as if the later LH IIIC and ProtoGeo occupation at Mitrou had been dug into earlier LH IIIA strata which border it on its W, N and E sides. Against the N edge of the excavated area, in trench LN786, a clay oven of LH IIIA date was partially uncovered in the EIA cemetery area. The function of this oven is still unknown. Palatial LH IIIB. A possible ELH IIIB surface was exposed at ca +5.16 to the W of the NE corner of the impressive LH IIB or earlier building found in trench LP784. It contained a large, mendable Zygouries kylix fragment of this date. These meagre remains are to be added to two small LH IIIB walls and a fragmentary floor found at +5.50 in trench LM785 in 2004. Post-palatial BA-IA transition. Remains from this transi tional period are unusually extensive, representing every ceramic phase and sub-phase. From the LH IIIC phase we excavated in 2004 and 2005 walls in trenches LM786, LN786 and LN785, and large megaron-type building B with several architectural phases in trenches LN-L0783-784 and LP784. In 2004 the construction of building B had been tentatively dated to LH IIIC E on the basis of the latest pottery found below the cobble platform against which the W wall of building B had been built (trench LN784). A 2005 sounding in trench LN783 below the dirt floor of the S room of building B (at ca +4.95), adjacent to and below the level of its W wall, did not produce a reliable construction date (SU 064). It appears that this area had been disturbed in the EProtoGeo phase, perhaps in conjunction with the construction of apsidal building A. The floor in this S room of building B had a roughly cut circular base, presumably for a column, situated at more or less equal distances from the N and S walls (walls 5 and 4) of this room. Its position suggests that one or two column bases may be located further to the SE. Built into the NW corner of building B we found in 2005 small rectangular building C (trenches LN784 and L0784). It contained a wheelmade cooking pot, which was found in 2004 but emptied in 2005 by zooarchaeologist Thanos Webb. This cooking pot held the thighbones of a young pig, three to five months old, placed on top of the neatly stacked thighbones of four foetal piglets. With this cooking pot were 23 complete handmade miniature vases, mostly drinking vessels, which are contemporary with the so-called 'SubMyc' stratum 7 at Kalapodi. The function of building C is as yet unknown, but it may have been funerary. On top of it and over its N wall (trench L0785) were two patches of blackened soil with a few remnants of cremated human bone, no doubt remains of cremation graves disturbed by mod. ploughing. A stray fragment of an Attic SubMyc stirrup jar found in 2004 in the plow zone above the SW part of building A indicates the existence of a grave of this date somewhere at the site. During the EIA, the residential area to the N was converted into a cemetery (trenches LL785-786, LM786-L0786). In 2004 and 2005 we excavated in all nine EIA cist graves, mostly belonging to children. The four graves uncovered in 2005 (cists 6-9) were mostly devoid of goods. They included an unusually long cist grave with our 1st adult burial: that of a middle-aged person, probably male (trench LN786, cist 6). He was buried with an iron pin and a small bronze coil. An infant burial was inserted later. Further S, apsidal building A had yielded in 2004 a rich floor deposit of drinking and storage vessels, which showed that the building had been destroyed in the MProtoGeo phase (E 10th Ct BC). Excavation in 2005 revealed that only the apsidal part of building A was preserved. The area further to the SE had been disturbed by later walls still dating to the MProtoGeo phase (trenches L0782-783). A sounding below building A in trench LN783 showed beyond a doubt that its double row of support bases belonged to its latest architec tural phase. Building A had an earlier earthen floor at ca +5.00 with one or more support bases in its centre, and this floor covered the earthen floor of building B at ca +4.95. Unfortunately the lower floor of building A had been too disturbed to yield a reliable construction date. A significant deposit of restorable pottery, most of it tentatively dated to the LH IIIC L, SubMyc and EProtoGeo phases, had been deposited together with mud-brick fragments, worked stones, conglomerate blocks and an unusually large amount of bones, to the S of buildings A and B, on top of small rubble walls and an earthen surface at ca + 5.00 (trench LN782, SU 007, 008, 009, 010, 014, 018, 019, 020 and 105). Not all the pottery has been studied yet. In his report on this pottery deposit, Bartlomiej Lis suggests that this may be debris cleared from building B when building A was constructed. Pottery dating to LH IIIC M, including belly amphora LN782-010-013 and handmade burnished cooking pot LN782-010-014, is generally better preserved and may derive from a floor deposit of building B. Later, more worn, material may have come from levels that once covered building B. If Lis' interpretation can be confirmed, it would date the construction of building A to the EProtoGeo phase (11th Ct BC). This would also suggest that the surface S of building A was some 15-20cm higher than the latest MProtoGeo floor of the building on which the large pottery deposit was found in 2004.' Proskynas. Ph. Dakoronia (ADelt, 372-77) reports on the excavation of a LGeo-ERom cemetery at the hill of Chiliadi. The 104 graves, almost all inhumations, dating from the 8th to the 1st Ct BC are of the usual types (37 trench, 23 tile, sixteen stone sarcophagi, twelve pithos burials, eight enchytrismoi, five clay larnakes (Fig. 100) and five interments scattered in the ground). Trench graves date to all periods, but stone sarcophagi and clay larnakes peak in the 6th to 5th Ct BC, whereas tile graves are characteristic of Hel times (3rd-1st Ct BC). The richer graves tend to date to LCl-Hel times, and include finds such as Megarian bowls, two kantharoi with 'leaf decoration from grave VII (Fig. 101), amphorae of Macedonian type, terracotta figurines (representing Cybele, etc) (Fig. 102), a bronze mirror, lagynoi of terra sigillata, and so forth. Sulla's invasion of 86 BC may be responsible for the decline in the community that used the cemetery. 100.

Museum. Ph. Dakoronia (ADelt, 378) notes the donation of 68 objects (collected from the area) by Th. Vellos. Kalapodi. Ph. Dakoronia and S. Dimaki (ADelt, 367-68) note a looted LHel chamber tomb 300m SE from the Daliani plot (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 55). Sparse finds (loomweight, terracotta figurines and glassware) provide a date in the L 2nd to E lstCtBC. W.-D. Niemeier (DAI Athens) reports on the 2nd (2005) season of excavation in the LMyc-Cl sanctuary of Kalapodi, which is either that of Artemis of Hyampolis, or that of Apollo of Abai (AR5\ [2004-2005], 56): 'The new excavations at Kalapodi in anc. Phokis, a sanctuary with LMyc origins, started in 2004 and were continued in 2005 in the area of the S temple. We continued to excavate the N peristasis and the step in front of the stylobate of the high Ar S temple, constructed ca 570/560 BC and destroyed by the Persians around 480 BC. In the 2004, the undisturbed Persian destruction layer had been discovered in this area, containing fallen roof tiles, charred roof beams and wooden columns, as well as the collapsed N mud-brick wall of the celia, under which lay remains of iron chariot wheels (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 55-56, fig. 98). In 2005, a cylindrical bronze terminal for a staff or sceptre, crowned by a ram's head (Fig. 104), was found in the rubble above the step. Horse trappings and fragments of bronze mountings, possibly belonging to a chariot, lay W of where the wheels had been 104. Kalapodi: LAr bronze terminal for a staff or sceptre 105. Kalapodi: circular stone construction discovered. The celia of the high Ar temple had been rearranged in the 5th Ct into an open courtyard containing a small open shrine built of re-used Ar orthostate blocks (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 55, fig. 97). Underneath this was a terracing deposit (up to 1.2m d.) associated with the Ar S temple. Below this, we made a remarkable find: the fallen mud-brick super structure of a LGeo to EAr temple had been levelled and used as the floor of a provisional sanctuary. It consisted of an open courtyard, delimited at least to the N and E by a t?menos wall of large limestone blocks. In its centre, a Doric capital with traces of burning had been lowered into the ground; its abacus was in secondary use as an altar. The floor around the capital yielded numerous votives: bronze rings, a bronze fibula, the fragment of a bronze shield, a bent iron lance point, iron knives, a meat fork and obeloi (meat skewers) from cultic meals. Parts of the two long walls of the LGeo to EAr S temple were excavated. They were built of mud-brick on a stone foundation. An interesting find was made on top of the N wall: after the destruction of the temple, a sacrificial deposit of two lance points, one of them bent, had been placed beside a small hearth. At the end of the campaign, the uppermost burnt floor level of the LGeo-EAr temple was reached below the Ar celia. On this floor lay numerous metal objects, including bronze rings and fragments of iron obeloi, as well as half of a MCor Kotyle, the remainder of which had been found in older excavations further to the W (see AA [1987], 17, fig. 30). This vessel, now completely reassembled, gives a tpq of ca 595/590-570 BC for the destruction of the temple. In the E part of the S temple, which is cut by the deep foundations of the Rom S temple, two further burnt clay floors had been found in 2004. The lower one had yielded an iron Naue type II sword (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 56, fig. 99). In 2005, a deep sounding was placed here to clarify the stratig raphy. Ceramic fragments of LGeo Cor Thapsos ware from the lowest fill provide a tpq of ca 740-720 BC for the erection of the LGeo-EAr S temple. Directly below this fill, in the exact location were the sword had been placed on the lowermost floor, a circular construction of large coarse field stones with a central pit was discovered (Fig. 105). Three successive clay</page><page sequence="69">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 69 floors, 6-7cm above each other, abutted this structure from the W. Numerous metal objects and pottery fragments were found on and between them. Bronze and iron cloth pins and fibulae, as well as bronze rings, were votives, while iron knives are evidence for cultic meals. Thus, the field stone construction appears to have been an altar in an open area, at which votives were placed. The central pit was for libations. Underneath the lowest of the floors associated with the altar lay fills of the E to MGeo periods (9th to 1st half of 8th Ct BC), followed by a pure ProtoGeo stratum of the 10th Ct BC. The find of burnt mud-brick and stones collapsed onto a floor surface indicates that architecture of the ProtoGeo period must have stood in the immediate vicinity. Below it, the uppermost Myc layer with fragments of LH IIIC ceramics (12* Ct BC) was reached on the last day of the campaign. A terracotta bird figurine containing seeds (Fig. 106) indicates Myc cult activity. It now seems clear that the LMyc layers found in previous excavations W of the S temple do continue E below the temple; the central area of the Myc sanctuary can be expected below the celia of the high Ar temple.' 106. Kalapodi: LMyc clay animal figurine Zeli. Ph. Dakoronia and S. Dimaki (ADelt, 369-70) report on the investigation of three further looted chamber tombs (III, IV and V) from the known Myc cemetery at Agios Georgios. Sparse finds such as steatite beads and spindle-whorls, bronze rings, an obsidian blade and one small stirrup jar do not provide a date more precise than LMyc. Modi. Ph. Dakoronia and S. Dimaki (ADelt, 370-71) report on the excavation of a looted chamber tomb (XVII) from the known Myc cemetery at Skamna. Finds from the other sixteen tombs had indicated a LH IIIA-B period of use. Finds from this one, such as a LH IIIB alabastron, a steatite bead and an LH IIIC prochoiskos, indicate a longer period of use of the cemetery. Residual Rom and Byz sherds in this and other tombs indicate that the cemetery had been looted some time in the past. Elateia. Ph. Dakoronia and S. Dimaki (ADelt, 368-69) report on the excavation of two further chamber tombs from the (principally) Myc cemetery at Alonaki. Though there were no datable finds from tomb XCIV, tomb XCV yielded evidence of two periods of use. The roof of the Myc chamber had collapsed, covering and disturbing the Myc interments. Associated LH IIIC, SubMyc and perhaps even EProtoGeo (in the case of a skyphos with raised conical foot) finds are rich however, and include numerous handmade and wheelmade vessels (Fig. 107), a stone adze, an iron knife, bronze arm and finger rings, a steatite spindle-whorl and glass beads. After the roof collapse, the chamber was re-cut and re-used for three LHel-ERom tile burials. Finds include bronze coins, a Megarian bowl and a lamp incised with the Gr letters BOPHIO on its base. 107. Elateia: SubMyc amphoriskos Tithoreas area. Ph. Dakoronia (ADelt, 378) notes the acquisition by the museum of 368 coins and 75 other antiquities, all collected in the area of Tihoreas, by D. Vageas. Objects include iron spearheads, iron knives, bronze rings, bronze javelin heads, pots, obsidian and flint blades. Most unusual is a Geo bronze diadem (presumably from a grave in the area). Lamia. Ph. Dakoronia, P. Bougia and A. Stamoudi (ADelt, 350-55) report on excavations in three locations, with finds ranging from EH to Hel date. At O. Amphiktyonon 22 (Miga plot) 47 LCl-Hel graves (25 tile, eleven trench, eight cist and two clay larnakes) from the city's cemetery were excavated. Rich finds include numerous black-glaze wares (kantharoi, skyphoi, lekythoi, lamps, amphorae, amphorae of Macedonian type), including an incised lid from a pyxis (Fig. 108), a bronze scabbard, a bronze mirror, bronze coins, bronze and iron strigils, an iron hook and clay figurines (usually of females). At O. Anianon (Pasionikou plot) a large structure forming part of the Hel city's civic (commercial, cultic and political) centre (i.e. the agora) was revealed. A large retaining wall to the W and, across a narrow street, a series of small rectangular spaces in ashlar masonry (partly incorporating a decree of the 3rd Ct BC) are covered by a tile collapse, sealing finds of the L 3rd and 2nd Cts BC. The large number of figurines may indicate a nearby workshop. Investigation of the Byz Kastro revealed post-Byz, Byz, Hel, LCI, Myc, MH and EH levels. Three rooms from a LC1 EHel structure were associated with pottery (skyphoi, lamps, kantharoi, guttus-type oinochoai, etc) and iron tools of the L 4th and 3rd Cts BC. MH and LH finds were to be found throughout the area excavated. Walls and terraces clearly belonging to a</page><page sequence="70">70 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. 108.

Dakoronia, M. Papaconstantinou and P. Bougia (ADelt, 363 67) report on excavations in six locations within this LCI to Rom city. Cemeteries. Five graves (four cist, one LHel enchytrismos) from the junction of O. Polykrati and Lambroutsou yielded bronze finds (dress pins, phialai) and black-glaze pottery, suggesting that they might have first been used in Geo times and re-used in the Hel period. At O. Lamias seven Rom graves (four cist, one structure of opus mixtum) yielded pottery of the 2nd to 4th Cts AD. One damaged ProtoGeo cist grave with two iron dress pins and two LCI cist graves with black-glaze pottery of the 4th Ct BC and an iron strigil turned up at the junction of O. Lamias and Alkmanas. Walls and houses, a 'leg' of the city's wall could be traced along the length of O. Lamias, and 4th Ct BC house walls turned up at O. Lamias 73 (Paliou plot). At O Platonos (Papantoni plot) two sections of the city's fortification wall, and a rectangular tower (6.5m by 6-7.15m, h. 2.33m) were revealed. The size and shape of the tower may indicate that it dates to the period of siege warfare of the Macedonian rulers Kassandros and Demetrios Poliorketes, in the L 4rd Ct BC. At O. Lamias 102 (Kotsamidi plot) a LCl-EHel structure with three rectangular rooms and a central space, partially covered by a collapse layer of Laconian tiles, yielded finds of the 4l Ct BC. These include numerous plain wares, black-glaze wares, loomweights and several lamps of Howland 30 B type. Particularly important are the three small 'hoards' of largely bronze (and one silver) coins from Larisa, E Lokris, Chalkis, Peparithos, Pevma, Malieis, Aianioi and Phokis, all dating to 356-271 BC, providing a tpq for its destruction, probably by an earthquake. The structure is best interpreted as a LCI courtyard house. Neraida. P. Founda records (ADelt, 438) the 18th Ct wall paintings at the Taxiarches monastery. P. Founda records (ADelt, 438) the wall-paintings, dating to 1755, at Agios Ioannes Pr?dromos. Achinos (perhaps anc. Echinos). Ph. Dakoronia (ADelt, 355 58) reports on further investigation of this city's Hel-ERom cemeteries in two locations. At the Karanasiou plot, twelve LHel-ERom graves (two cist, one chamber tomb, one tile and eight trench) yielded black- and red-glaze pottery and other finds of the 2nd to 1st Ct BC. These comprise some lagynoi, several examples of terra sigillata (a plate incised with ETTTXH2 on the base, and a lamp with its own graffito (Fig. 109) and some bronze coins. At the Dalarizou plot, 36 LC1 ERom graves (twenty trench, seven tile, six cist and three small chamber tombs) yielded finds of the L 4th Ct BC to the E 1st Ct AD. These include black-glaze kantharoi, lamps, loomweights, some W slope ware, some lagynoi, some red-glaze wares (including some terra sigillata), terracotta figurines (principally of females), some glassware and a silver finger ring. 109.

Stone, bone and lead objects were also recovered. E of the cemetery, a pit yielded animal bones and pottery, of LH IIIC to SubProtoGeo date, perhaps E evidence of a ritual involving the sacrifice of animals. E. Nikolou (ADelt, 395) reports on further investigation of the Hel fortification wall of the anc. city at X.0.280.000 (Fig. 113). A corner tower (8.2m by 6.5m) of the W leg of the wall survived to a h. of 1.2m. Finds from this and from part of the S leg of the wall of the upper city yielded Hel pottery, terracotta figurines, bronze coins, loomweights and iron nails. Finds of javelin heads and arrowheads, daggers and missiles from catapults indicate that the city was besieged in anc. times, and the poor state of the walls may indicate that the fortifications were not long in use. Eight metres from a limestone structure of two rooms on the W leg of the wall came the bottom of a base for a votive (statue?) to Demeter, inscribed: NIKOBOTAA: nOATKAEITOT OTTATHP: AAMATPI. Z. Malakasioti, V. Rontiri and R. Reindeers (ADelt, 402-43) provide a brief account of joint Gr/Dutch investigations at Kefalosi (Pl?tanos Almyrou) (AR 46 [1999-2000], 69). V.

Architecture took the form of post hole structures with clay/mud-brick walls. Animal bones and archaeobotanical samples were taken for later analysis. Rich finds include possible clay loomweights, shellfish, flint and obsidian blades and tools (Fig. 114), and several terracotta figurines (Fig. 115) mainly of animals and human females. The abundant pottery, only 10% of which was decorated, seems to date from the end of the ENeo through to the end of the MNeo period. A.

At Tambachana multiple (Ar-Hel?) layers of anc. houses will require further investigation. Environs of Velestino. A. Doulgeri-Intzesiloglou (ADelt, 404 05) reports on excavations in three locations. Just W of Pilaf Tepe an EBA settlement came to light in the Kokkali plot. Architecture takes the form of cairns, with finds including Final Neo, EBA and MBA pottery, flint blades, bone tools, and one silver and one bronze pin. Just E of Pilaf-Tepe, another anc. cairn was investigated. At Latomeio, just N of the known site of Spartia, a previously unknown Ar sanctuary was investi gated. Excavation of several apothetes around a probable altar, 3m by 4m, yielded Ar bronze, lead and iron objects, bronze vessels, iron weapons and tools, terracotta figurines and pottery, some Cor. A burnt layer contained animal bones, probably the remains of sacrifices. Some Hel pottery and a lamp also turned up. Sesklo. V Adrymi-Sismani (ADelt, 417-18) reports on further conservation work at this Neo settlement. 116. Dimini: Linear B incised block 117. Dimitrias: mosaic with dolphins Dimini. V.

During cleaning and conservation of megaron A from the settlement, several stone moulds for (bronze?) jewellery and a stone block incised with signs in Linear B (Fig. 116) were revealed. Cleaning of megaron B turned up a quantity of both LH IIIB2 and LH IIIC E painted pottery. Both megara, divided by a court, seem to form part of the same 'palatial' complex. Anc. Dimitrias. A. Blatziou-Efstathiou and P. Triandaphyllopoulou (ADelt, 397-400) report on further excavation in six locations within this Cl-Rom city, wrongly identified with the mod. village of Dimitriada in earlier reports (AR5\ [2004-2005],58). Further cleaning and restoration of the mosaics at the palace took place. Sections of the Hel-Rom cemeteries came to light in two locations within Pefkakia. At Pharos five partly looted LHel graves (three cist, two tile) produced pottery and lamps of the 2 -1th Ct BC. The finds from cist grave 3, containing three inhumations, were particularly rich, and include gold leaf, glass perfume flasks, lamps, a bronze ring and an iron strigil. At the Sefel plot, several cist graves probably looted during World War II were investigated. Ethnos (31/03/2006) notes the discovery of a LCI cremation (grave 389) of a young woman (20-25 years old) in a bronze hydria of the 4th Ct BC, the 1st burial in a hydria from the 924 graves so far excavated. Other finds include linen cloth remains and a bronze lid. The hydria has a representation of Eros on the handle, and is the product of a local workshop active between 370 and 260 BC. Houses and fortifications. At the Pallikara plot, a rectangular tower and a 24.4m stretch of the LHel fortifica tion wall (w. 1.9m) of the city were investigated. Both wall and tower contain spolia of earlier material. The tower's dimensions (4.1m by 3.2m) are such that it could have supported a defensive catapult, and suggest a date of around 88 BC for its construction, in response to the expedition of Mithridates of Pontus. Over this in M-LRom times a large house/villa, with an exterior wall /. 24.2m and w. 0.55m with several large rooms and a central paved courtyard, was constructed. Within this courtyard (perhaps under a peristyle) was a mosaic with two antithetical dolphins divided by a trident (Fig. 117). Finds from the building include pottery and lamps of the 3rd and 4th Cts AD, and bronze coins of Antoninus Pius, Constantius I (292-305 AD), Constantine the Great (306-337 AD) and Constantine II (337-340 AD).

One house had two substantial mosaic floors with geometric designs (Fig. 118). The complex seems to be, in part at least, built over an earlier LHel-ERom structure of the 2nd-1st Ct BC, as indicated by finds of pottery, glassware, lamps (Fig. 119) and coins of the Thessalian League (199 146 BC), Magnesian League (196-147 BC), and Augustus and Aurelian (270-275 AD).

Chatziangelakis (ADelt, 413-14) reports on further excavation of the PH, principally Neo, magoula. Clay floors and the stone foundations of walls give some idea of the architecture. Finds include much flint and obsidian, bone tools (many made from the jaws of animals), and both 'grey on grey' and 'black on red' painted pottery (Fig 123). Much of the pottery and the animal bone had traces of burning. Noteworthy are five terracotta figurines and some shells of spondylus gaederopus (probably from ornaments). Palamas. Both Ta Nea and To Vima (19/05/2005) report on the discovery of an anc. fortification wall at O. Thermopylon. Associated pottery, bronze and bone objects date from the MBA to SubMyc times, leading to the suggestion that Palamas might be the site of Homeric Asterion mentioned in the catalogue of the ships in the Iliad (2.735). Mataranga. L. Chatziangelakis (ADelt, 414-15) reports on excavation of (Hel? Rom?) structures, probably houses, by the banks of the Orgozinos stream. Finds (undated) include sherds and iron objects. Associated with the final phase of one of the structures was a pebble mosaic, bedded on a layer of tiles and mortar. Pyrgos Kieriou and area (of anc. Ami). E. Nikoalou (ADelt, 410-13) reports on further excavation of Cl, Hel and Rom structures at the Evangeliou plot. A corner of the principal Hel structure was fully revealed. Finds include loomweights, roof tiles, (some stamped /...PION, ...APOT or ..IMOKAEOT), lamps, perfume flasks dating to the 2nd Ct BC and coins of Phalana, Larisa, Krannon, Pharsalos, Istaia, Corinth, Amytas, Kassandros (Cassander), Antigonos Gonatas, the Thessalian League and Constantine the Great. Eleven further, probably Cl, graves (five cist, one trench, two tile and two clay larnakes) came to light at the Smeti plot, the only datable finds being some Cl sherds. Philia and Kedros. B.

Residual pottery and some four settings for clay storage vessels indicate earlier MH activity in the area. Restoration and conservation of the kastro on the hill of Agios Anathasios and the Rom tile tomb at Xinovrysi also took place (ADelt, 418). Xeroneri/Georgiko. B. Intzesiloglou (ADelt, 408-09) reports on further cleaning, excavation and conservation work at the Myc and later tholos tomb at Koufia Rachi. Cleaning of the dromos revealed some LH IIIB-C painted pottery, and the chamber yielded indications of burials and more Myc and post Myc finds, including an iron knife. Investigation of the disturbed deposits outside the tomb produced other Myc finds, including gold and glass beads, three sealstones, rock-crystal and a gold ring (Fig. 124) whose bezel bears a representation of two griffins.

More work was done on the cairns and later deposits, thought to represent ancestor worship, outside the tholos tomb to the S, where a Laconian cover tile found in 1997 and inscribed either AIITIO or AITIION retrograde in Gr letters of the 7th or 6th Ct BC (Fig. 125) (though B. Intzesiloglou reads AIATIIONN). This inscription may give the name of the eponymous hero of the area, Aiatos, father of Thessalos, and may therefore provide an indication of hero cult of an appro priately local hero. 126. Moschato: terracotta sculpture Moschato. B. Intzesiloglou (ADelt, 410) reports on further excavation of the Cl-Hel temple of Apollo at Lianokokkala. Amidst much tile from a fallen roof, a h. lm section of an (Ar? Cl?) pedimental coroplastic sculpture of a horse (Fig. 126) was revealed. Nearby was a sandstone base with an honorific Kataphygi. S.

Finds (undated) include loomweights, pithoi, bronze and iron objects, two iron daggers, bronze jewellery and coins. Flint may indicate activity here earlier than Cl times. Investigation within the area of the known Hel fortified site at Petroto Palaiokastro uncovered three MH (MBA) apsidal buildings and one cist grave with a stone grave marker.

Gouglas (Canadian Institute, University of Alberta) report on the 2nd (2005) season of intensive survey on this principally LCI city/acropolis site (Fig. 127): 'The team worked in four groups focusing on the following modules: archaeological survey, architectural survey, GIS and artefact cataloguing. This year, the architectural survey focused on the large structure on the N W side of the agora, located in between the two summits of our site. During the 2004 season we cleared and measured a large building on the NE side of the agora (Fig. 128) which we concluded to be a stoa (building 1). A smaller 2nd structure (designated building 2) was visible just W of building 1, but it was necessary to clear an area of roughly 30m by 30m to adequately evaluate it.

Kallithea: general plan</page><page sequence="77">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 77 128. Kallithea: agora building 1 and 2 consist of large flattened ashlar blocks laid out in one or two rows. Building 2 was rectangular in form, measured ca 17m E-W by 14m N-S and could be entered though a large doorway from its N side. Its internal organiza tion consisted of three spaces which were most likely intercon nected. Just outside the N part of building 2 a well was found. The size and location of building 2 suggest a public function. Clearing the area between buildings 1 and 2 made a number of walls visible belonging to two structures (buildings 3 and 4). Building 3 is oval in form and measures 6.66m E-W by 7.98m N-S. It has an entrance on its E side of w. 0.5m and connects with the wall demarcating the street running N-S along the agora. The structure is clearly less sophisticated in its construc tion and the foundations consisted of small, unworked stones, some of which were overlaying foundations belonging to building 1, indicating a later date. Just NE of building 3 lies building 4, a rectangular structure consisting of two rooms and a probable courtyard, sharing an external wall with the street and opening up to the E. It measures 10.10m N-S by 10.32m E-W. The function and date of these two buildings is, as yet, unknown. Part of a housing block on the NE side of the slope was cleared, examined and drawn. The housing block contained one free-standing building (building 8) which most likely constitutes a house or two smaller houses sharing one wall. The feature could be entered from the E side and had four rooms of which the SE space most likely represents a courtyard. In addition, the internal fortification walls (Diateichismata I and II) were examined in detail. With clearing part of diate ichisma II a 49th tower came to light at the location where the diateichisma connects to the external enceinte suggesting a date similar to that of the LCI fortification wall and the site's orthogonal grid plan. Two towers close to the acropolis walls (towers 41 and 45) bore traces of later occupation. The acropolis itself bears some traces of the use of mortar in the upper foundation of acropolis gate 1, suggesting a post-Rom occupation stage. Work by the Ephoreia in September 2005. Clearing the area just SW of buildings 1 and 2 revealed the layout of two public buildings, i.e. buildings 5 and 6. Building 5, to the N, has a large rectangular courtyard, where in its W part a small orthogonal building was found, measuring 5.81m N-S by 5.60m E-W. It is probably divided into two rooms by an internal wall. The entrance to the small building is located at the E, where a small altar, made of vertically placed slabs, was found. Exactly in front of the entrance of the small building, a small orthogonal limestone block was found with three breast like protrusions. Such finds are known from Eretria and Pharsalos. The building can be interpreted as a small temple. Within the courtyard, just N of the altar, another orthogonal room or construction was found, of uncertain purpose. To the E and W of the courtyard, three rooms per side were found, possibly entered from the outside. To the S, and in contact with building 5, building 6 was located, comprising a courtyard and at least twelve rooms to its W and S sides. Buildings 5 and 6 share a common retaining wall. In the courtyard of building 6 a subterranean cistern was found, cut in the bedrock, bearing traces of waterproof mortar and remains of a vaulted roof. Building 6 measures 19.63m N-S by 24.25m E-W. To the SE of building 6, the layout of another orthogonal building was uncovered (building 7), comprising at least five rooms and measuring 20.30m E-W by 9.86m N-S. Another orthogonal building (building 8) was cleared, measuring 13m N-S by 10.50m E-W, which lies close to the gate of the W city wall. It comprises at least four rooms. Lastly, one of the private houses at the NE side of the city was cleared. It comprises five rooms and one gamma-shaped courtyard. Work of the GIS team was divided between teaching activities, laying out the unit system and measuring visible walls within the city fortifications. The team was able to shoot in a large number of housing walls at the NE part of the site showing a distribution and orientation of walls in a very regular pattern. In studying this pattern, it became clear that the city is regularly planned with housing blocks of similar size and with avenues running E-W and streets running N-S. The regularity of the pattern and the housing blocks is surprising considering how steep the slopes of the hill are and how varied the elevation of the site is. The agora is part of the regular planning as well. Buildings 1 -4 border an avenue, designating a space that is about one and a half times the width of a normal housing block. Streets are w. ca 2.5m and avenues measure w. ca 3.5m. The housing blocks measure ca 25m E-W by 40m N-S. At least four round structures came to light which all seem to overlay the existing regularly patterned housing blocks. F or now, there is no archaeological support for a connection between these round structures and the later building stage (buildings 3 and 4) at the agora and acropolis. The GIS team also shot in the location of three additional El A tholos tombs located at the E and S slopes of the kastro, totalling the number of tholos tombs in the area to seven. Two cist graves were found in the same areas. In the archaeological survey the existing unit system of last season was extended to the E and N and to this year a total of 100 units have been surveyed. The surveyors employed clickers to count and establish the sherd density of the units and they evaluated the units' visibility, erosion, slope and archaeo logical characteristics. In the 2nd stage, the surveyors collected a grab sample of possible diagnostic finds in the unit and the final stage of survey was represented by taking a unit mid sample in which all material was assembled within a circle di. 2m. A total of 3,371 pieces of pottery were observed and 678 sherds were collected of which only 93 proved to be diagnostic. The most positive correlation between clicker count and any variable is the presence or absence of architectural features in the unit; those with architectural remains have, on average, more than twice as high a clicker count. In our preliminary analysis all evaluated variables are statically significant when regressed on clicker counts, which speaks well for our model. The highest weighted artefact densities correlate with parts of the housing area on the E part of the site and the temple and cistern in the agora area.</page><page sequence="78">78 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. Remarkable were the large numbers of iron slags found mainly in two units, indicating activities of metalworking on the site. Artefact cataloguing. The majority of the pottery was too worn to be dated securely to a period more limited than 100 years. Only a few sherds proved to be earlier or later than the 4th and 3rd Cts BC. The two extremes in date were represented by a fragment of Ar incised pottery which was found close to the E summit, a fragment of Ar painted pottery (7th-6th Ct BC) and two very small fragments of Megarian bowls (2nd-1st Ct BC). Not a single piece of sigillata ware has been found thus far. And although some of the architectural remains suggest a post-Rom occupation, no clear diagnostic finds belonging to this period have come to light. Other finds of the survey included four coins: Lokris (3rd Ct BC), Peumata (302-286 BC), Skiathos (350-344 BC) and from Elis (silver stater, 2nd Ct BC).' Pharsala (anc. Pharsalos). S. Karapanou and S. Katakouta (ADelt, 423-24) report on the excavation of Cl-Hel house remains in three locations. At O. Koumoundourou 7 (Vourlitsi plot) three successive phases could be identified. A LCI rectangular structure was succeeded by an EHel house with five rooms, in turn replaced by a LHel house with six rooms and an open courtyard. Traces of pebble mosaics could be found in both Hel phases. At O. 25is Maiou 7 (Polyzou plot) the central court area of a substantial peristyle Hel house was revealed, which covered an earlier Cl wall and an EIA child's cist grave, associated with bronze grave goods. Residual BA deposits were also encountered. At O. Thetidos 133 (Theka plot) two successive phases of a Hel house were revealed. Large numbers of female terracotta figurines were associated with the 1st phase. The houses were roofed with Laconian tiles. Larisa.

Though it is located 800m NE of the known Neo magoula of Karaika 3, it does not seem to be a settlement of this type. Excavations within an area of 0.17ha revealed numerous pits containing finds principally of the Arapi phase of the LNeo period, such as pottery, female terracotta figurines and animal bones. Charcoal from one of the pits was subjected to radiocarbon analysis by the Demokritos Laboratory, giving dates of 4040-3800 BC (sample 47) and 4040-3780 BC (sample 48). Melia. L.

Kontoyianni (ADelt, 456-70) report on further rescue excavations at 21 locations within this largely Ar-Hel city (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 64). For the 1st time substantial Rom houses and graves have turned up, disproving the hypothesis that the city was largely deserted after the foundation of Nikopolis. Ar-Rom houses and workshops. Further investigation of the Hel houses at O. Rogon (Apotori plot) revealed stone drains and three rooms largely belonging to the 2nd (3rd Ct BC) phase of the house. Finds include plain Hel pottery, black-glazed Hel pottery, terracotta figurines and bronze coins of Ambrakia. At O. Garouphalia (Theodorou plot), in an area thought to belong to the city's SW cemetery, two large rooms belonging to a Hel Rom workshop complex were investigated. Room A was covered by a substantial tile collapse horizon of the lst-2nd Ct AD, covering earlier deposits dating from the 4th Ct BC onwards. Room B, which too was covered with a tile collapse in LHel-ERom times, appears to have been devoted to the production of olive oil (Fig. 130). It contained a cistern lined with hydraulic cement. Another Rom structure (house?) was partially investigated at O. Pouliou Drakou (Papanikolaou plot). Investigation of the Hel house at O. Souliou (Lazaropoulou plot) was completed. Three further rooms of the Hel house next to a 7.2m stretch of anc. road were revealed. In the central room (2.5m by 5m) part of a mosaic floor overlies an earlier destruction/tile collapse layer. An earlier Ar phase is also sealed by a destruction horizon, with traces of fire and associated Cor pottery. Other finds include Cl and Hel pottery and bronze coins of Ambrakia. Later, four Ot trench burials were dug into these remains. Another (10m) stretch of an anc. road next to an ECl-LHel house complex was investigated at the Thanou plot (on a private road between O. Herakleitou and Ignatiou). Five rooms of the Hel structure, partly sealed by a LHel tile collapse, include a central peristyle courtyard (6m by 6m) with Doric columns and a central well. The Hel walls rest on and partly re-use earlier Cl ones, and there are signs of Ar occupation sealed by another destruction horizon. Finds include large quantities of LCl-Hel pottery (of the 4th and 3rd 130. Arta: Hel house Cts BC), some EC1 and Ar sherds, a number of bronze coins of Ambrakia, terracotta figurines and metal objects. Further traces of anc. walls, which may be parts of houses, came to light at O. Kosma Aitolou (Zerva plot), O. Vasileos Konstantinou (church of Agioi Theodoroi), and as a result of public works in parts of O. Manoliassis, O. Plastira, O. Mavromati, O. Gorgou, O. Souliou and O. Plakas. Clear Hel floor levels and walls came to light in the short street between O. Zalongou and O. Zalokosta. Shrines. Two LAr-ECl stone rectangular altars came to light at O. Maximou Graikou (Triandaphyllou-Lambri plot). The smaller (altar 1) measures 1.5m by 1.4m, the larger 2.5m by 2.5m along their respective bases. Both may be associated with nearby temples, one possibly represented by massive stone foundations in the SW corner of the plot, the other by the known LAr pronoaos at O. Vasilios Pyrrhou. An associated apothetis yielded animal bone, traces of burning (and so of sacrificial ritual) and finds (spearheads, small swords, other metal objects, pottery and terracotta figurines) dating from LAr to LHel times. A smaller apothetis produced just animal bones. Twenty two Byz and post-Byz graves were located in the upper layers. Fortification wall. Investigation of a further 30m of the Hel fortification wall at the junct of O. Pouliou Drakou and Zarra (Tachou plot) has now revealed a stretch of 63m overall. The wall is constructed of ashlar limestone blocks, each 0.65m /?., surviving to a maximum of four courses (i.e. 2.65m /?.). A paved road runs along the outside of the wall in part. Another corner of the wall was found 31.8m away to the W. Within the wall a small opening acted as a storm drain. A further, smaller, exterior 23m stretch of fortification wall (the proteichisma), incorpo rating earlier spolia, was traced at a distance of 6.6- 8.2m from the main wall. Further still, a short stretch of another smaller wall incorporated an earlier Hel funerary stele, inscribed: ..OKA ...2 ....AIONOZ Such a system of main wall and exterior proteichisma is consistent with a date in the 2nd Ct BC, at a time when the Romans were campaigning in Epiros. Another substantial 12m stretch of fortification wall (w. 4m) came to light at the junction of O. Herakleitou and Melaneos (Bouranda plot). Behind the wall was a small roadway whose excavation yielded pottery of the 5th and 4th Cts BC, terracotta figurines, plaques with relief decoration, and a Laconian tile stamped AAM02. Further inside was part of Hel house (house Delta), with finds generally ofthe3rd-2ndCtBC.</page><page sequence="80">80 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. Cemeteries. A further 67 LAr-Hel graves (22 cist, 25 trench, one tile, one limestone sarcophagus, four cremations in urns and fourteen cremations[?] in stone settings) from the city's SW cemetery were excavated at O. Kommenou (Dimou plot). Most inhumations/cremations were single, though the cists often contained multiple inhumations. Finds include bf lekythoi (from the two Ar graves) (Fig. 131), lamps, kantharoi, LCl-Hel black-glaze skyphoi, Hel skyphoi with relief decoration, perfume flasks and lagynoi. Children's graves are often furnished with terracotta figurines. Metal objects (iron strigils, daggers, two gold earrings with representations of Nike and gold oak leaves, bronze and silver finger rings, and two bronze mirrors) are usually to be found in adult graves. In the area of Koutsomyta (Korda plot), four graves from the city's E cemetery were investigated. Two cist graves were without grave goods, and grave II (a limestone sarcophagus) contained an iron sword. A (Cl?) bronze lebes within a circular stone setting contained a cremation. On the banks of the Arachthos river, an anc. (Rom?) wall by the river itself re-used earlier architectural members, near to which were one Hel and one Rom cist grave. The Hel grave was marked by a grave stele inscribed: 0EOAOTA SOT?NOS 0TPPEIA. The Rom grave contained some plain pottery of the 2nd Ct AD. 131. Arta: bf lekythoi Pantanassa Philippiados. P. Votokopoulos (ASA) reports on further restoration and conservation work on the main Byz church, the small chapel and the cloister or stoa (Ergon, 53-57; see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 65). Work concentrated on the wall-paintings and their associated inscriptions, particularly the many fragments of the image of the Theotokos found in 1990 (Fig. 132). Two inscriptions can be deciphered on this painting. One reads: Ev X[pi(ri](D to 0[e]co m&lt;ri[o? ^eauoT^? [Kofiv]r)vo? AovKa?. And another reads: Avva ev X[pi(TT](? to 0[e]w ewre/3a(7Ta[T7?

Zachos and Ch. Kappa (ADelt, 471-74) report on further excavation of the Victory Monument of Octavian Augustus, built to commemorate the battle of Actium (AR 51 [2004 2005], 65). Excavation along the main S retaining wall o? opus quasi reticulatum revealed more steps. Investigation of the E retaining wall (partly constructed of opus testaceum) revealed that part of it rests on a destruction horizon, composed of blocks, stamped tiles and other architectural members from the roof of the stoa, which must represent an earlier phase of the construction of the monument. A drain constructed of Laconian tiles was found in the N wing of this stoa, and more walls of the W wing were also investigated. Further work on the central altar, which rests partly on a concrete foundation, turned up marble sculpture in low relief, of high quality, which probably formed part of the exterior decoration of the altar. Another drain was found nearby. The work of restoration and conser vation continued (ADelt, 478). Elsewhere, K. Zachos and Th. Kyrkou (ADelt, 479-81) report on the conservation of mosaics in the Villa of Manius Antoninus (Fig. 133) (compare AR 51 [2004-2005], 66, fig. 118) and the conservation and restoration of the Stadium.

At Tsechlimbou (Therianou Vlachou) plot 40 largely LCl-EHel graves (L 4th/E 3rd Ct BC) from the city's N cemetery were investigated. The graves were set out in rows, and all were of known grave types (twelve cist, ten limestone sarcophagi, six tile and ten trench). Almost all</page><page sequence="81">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 81 graves were single extended inhumations. Finds include plain lekythoi, lamps, perfume flasks, aryballoi (one rf), bronze jewellery, beads from necklaces, iron strigils, and bronze and silver coins. A silver ear-pick and pair of bronze cymbals were found in a child's grave. Some of the graves may date to Rom times. At Kalligoni trenches put in by Gr Telecommunications (OTE) revealed a number of substantial ashlar walls which probably belong to (Cl-Hel?) public buildings, since associated finds include terracotta roof tiles stamped AA. Nearby, an English antiquarian had noted a block inscribed AnOAAONI ATAI N0IK0A0MH2AN set in the nearby church of Agia Triada. Nearby, at the Vrettou plot, parts of two (Cl-Hel?) houses (house A and B) were partially investigated, one (house A) having a drain. Further excavation is required. 133.

The W end of the stoa (Fig. 134) abuts and joins the Prytaneion, indicating that the stoa is later. A small stairway of six steps had been built on the E part of the stoa, to allow for the difference in slope between the E and W ends of this structure. Several more stone votive bases, both rectangular (13, 14 and 15) and semi-circular (e.g., 22, 24 and 25) (Fig. 135) were investigated, though no useful inscriptions have been reported. 134.

Pliakou (ADelt, 453-56) report on eighteen sites, only three of which were fully excavated, investigated in advance of the construction of this major road (Fig. 136). From E to W, these were: at Longades a Rom cist grave; at Platania, Rachi at least fourteen rooms belonging to a Hel farmstead or small settlement; at Palioklesi Goritsas, damaged cist graves; at Koutselio, M andres PH and Hel sherds; at Kokkino Lithari, Kastritsa, handmade PH sherds, probably from a settlement; at Kastritsa, the anc. acropolis; also at Kastritsa the known Neo and Pal caves, and related settlement and graves dating from Neo until Hel times; at Parkio Koutseliou a (Hel?) grave with a helmet of Illyrian type; at Katsika, PH and later sherds; at Pedini, Agioi Apostoloi a LCI cist grave of an adult woman, containing substantial finds of the 4th Ct BC, including a parts of a necklace of gilded clay beads (Fig. 137), a bronze kadiskos similar to one found at Vitsa Zagoriou (Fig. 138) and remains from a nearby (LCl-Hel) settlement; at Pedini, Agia Marina walls and pottery of 'Epirot' type, and a probable PH (ElA?) grave without grave goods, charcoal from which has been sent for radiocarbon dating; at Drasmesioi near Dodona, remains of an anc. settlement; and at Agia Anastasia near Dodona remains of an anc. acropolis. Ioannina. I. Andreou reports (ADelt, 482-84) on further excavation at the site of Douroti, where earlier an anc. cemetery had been investigated. More straight and curved walls came to light, which seem to take the form of a central circular structure composed of two walls, an inner (di. 5.7m) and an outer (di. 10.5m), surrounded on either side by stone platforms. Finds include large plain vessels (pithoi, amphorae, etc), some black-glaze drinking vessels, some handmade local pottery of 'PH' type, some Ar, Cor and some Cl Attic painted pottery, and ceramic roof tiles. Metal finds include bronze coins, iron tools and a silver ring with a central sealstone. The structure is interpreted as a sanctuary, possibly of Demeter. Meropi Pogoniou. I. Andreou (ADelt, 481-82) reports on excavation of a probably PH settlement at Ambelia, near the Gorgos river.

Rom?) tile graves; at Choika (pylon 111 ) a stone drain; at Gardiki (pylon 118) a room (8.5m by 5m) of an anc. (Hel? Rom?) structure, finds including a bronze fibula and earring. Several sites clustered near Korotiani: at pylon 181, a Med aloni; and at pylon 182 a Hel Rom structure of isodomic masonry, with black-glaze and red glaze pottery (some with relief decoration), loomweights, iron nails, lead and a bronze Hel coin of the Epirot League; at pylon 188, some pottery; at pylon 190 (hill of Dramesi) some tile; and at pylon 191 sherds and anc. structures. More extensive excavations were undertaken at Mavromati Sagiadas (pylon 251), where a LByz chapel and 33 associated cist and tile graves were investigated. Finds from around the ruined apsidal chapel (5.7m by 3.2m) include glassware, roof tiles and a Frankish coin of the 'Denier Tournois' type (from Tours), marked DE CLARENTIA. Sparse finds from the graves include glassware and bronze, and the bones have been sent for osteological analysis. Finally, at Asproklisi (pylon 280), one tile grave and one pithos burial came to light. Mazarakia. G Riginos (ADelt, 512-13) notes a damaged (Hel? Rom?) tile grave with a bronze coin at Damari. Demos Paramythias, the Thesprotia Expedition. B. Fors?n (Finnish Institute) reports on the 2004 and 2005 seasons of survey work: 'The Thesprotia Expedition is an inter-disciplinary survey project aiming at writing the diachronic history, from PH until mod. times, of the Thesprotian Kokytos river basin in Epiros. During the 1st field seasons in 2004-2005 we searched intensively a total area of 2.2km2 and documented 27 places of special interest, most of which constitute archaeological sites. The earliest remains of human activity in the area date to the MPal and Upper Pal periods. We have documented three such sites of large size. Two of them are located in red soils and were previously known (PS 22 and PS 23). They have now been sampled intensively for the 1st time, revealing several find concentrations. The 3rd site of this period, PS 4, is interesting because it is located next to a natural source of flint, and thus it is most probably a knapping site. Additionally, the lithics at this site have no patina. This observation raises interesting questions about how and why such a patina develops. The fact that we have localized the two 1st known Mes sites in Thesprotia is important. One of them (PS 3) produced a large spectrum of tools and flakes, including arrowheads, trapezes, end scrapers, per?oirs, bladelets and cores. The total sample consists of several hundred lithics. It is noteworthy that the two sites are located in an inland valley, and not, as is usually the case, on the coast. The later PH period is represented by four sites. The dating of these is uncertain due to the badly developed local pottery chronology. On the basis of our present knowledge, three of them (PS 12, PS 18 and PS 20) can be dated broadly to the L/Final Neo to BA (Fig. 139). The 4th one (PS 17) produced large quantities of orange-red pottery, a local ware that is dated to the IA. Interestingly enough PS 17 is located at the foot of the small acropolis site Agios Donatos of Zervochori (PS 25) which was inhabited at least from the 4th Ct BC until the 2nd Ct AD. 139. Thesprotia Expedition: Neo arrow heads Agios Donatos of Zervochori is the most important of the LCI to ERom sites studied by us. In 2005 we cleaned the remaining acropolis walls and documented them as well as the whole hill and its slopes in detail. The structure of the walls, probably from the 4th or 3rd Ct BC, was studied whereby two gates and a square tower with space for catapults in the ground floor were revealed. On the hill there are remains of large terrace walls and rock-cut foundations of houses, seemingly laid out according to a square ground plan. Several architec tural blocks (triglyph-metope frieze, column drums, orthostate blocks, etc) and a large amount of Italian ierra sigillata of the 1st to 2nd Ct AD were recorded. This pottery indicates that the site continued in use also after the Rom conquest of Thesprotia. So far we have studied three other smaller sites of Cl to Hel date. One of them was detected close to the Sevasto village (PS 15) due to the fact that illegal digging had been performed there. In order to save the site from further destruction it was</page><page sequence="84">84 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. immediately excavated by the 8th Ephorate. These excavations revealed a large house from the 4th to 3rd Ct BC. We also surveyed intensively parts of a small hamlet (PS 5 and PS 7), which some years ago was partly excavated by the 8th Ephorate, revealing houses, graves and a small rural sanctuary (see, I. S vana in Llllyrie m?ridionale et VEpire dans Vantiquit? IV, Paris [2004], 209-13). On the valley bottom itself, close to the Kokytos river we finally localized some twenty worked blocks which originate from a monumental structure, perhaps from a destroyed grave heroon (PS 13). In the LRom period the settlement pattern changes drastically. There appear many new small sites on the valley bottom that had not previously been inhabited, but used exclusively for graves. Five such sites have been studied by us, one seemingly constituting a sprawling hamlet next to a known and excavated ECh basilica (PS 27). The rest are isolated farmsteads or graves attached to them, with one possibly being a villa (PS 14) due to the rich finds, including imported amphorae and much fine glass (the landowner reportedly had found parts of terracotta water-pipes previously). Finds from the Med period have so far been encountered only as random scatters in tracts. The evidence for Emod. settlement is however better, with four recorded sites, all different in character. In general the amount and quality of pottery collected on the Emod sites is surprisingly poor. One is a fortified village located high up on the slopes of the Paramythia mountain ridge (PS 24). Another consists of two houses located on the valley bottom (PS 9). The 3rd is, according to local information, a small seasonal Vlach settlement on the lower hill slopes (PS 26). A large industrial site with at least six kilns (PS 8), where tiles and/or pottery had been produced, was finally located close to the village of Xerolofos. Thermoluminescence analyses conducted by the Dimokritos Laboratory date the site to the 2nd half of the 18th Ct. Concurrently with the archaeological survey a geological survey of the Kokytos river area was initiated. The texture, phosporus content, loss-on-ignition and redox potential of the soil samples taken will be determined in order to gain information about the character of individual settlements and changes in the environment.' Egnatia Odos. G. Riginos (ADelt, 509-11) reports on finds made in advance of the construction of this major road, going from E to W. At Krystallopigi-Psillorachi 750 more Pal flint tools came to light, including MPal Levallois cores and Upper Pal blades and chisels. Later finds in the area include a LHel ERom grave. At Neochori 57 PH flints and some PH handmade wares were noted. At Grika, further investigation of the known isodomic (Hel?) structure at Litharia Monovyzas uncovered some plain pottery. At Mesovouni-Grika 314 later MPal and earlier Upper Pal flint tools were collected from the surface. Tile and pottery were found nearby. Demos Igoumenitsas, Ladochori. G Riginos (ADelt, 494 98) reports on rescue excavation in four locations in this LRom-EByz settlement. At the lawcourt site, several more rectilinear Byz and post-Byz houses, heated with simple stone hearths, came light, into part of which was dug a post-Byz grave. On the N part of the site, more evidence of the apsidal caldarium of the LRom bath complex came to light, including more evidence of the system of drains and the hypocaust. Finds from here include plain LRom pottery, lamps of African type dating from the 4 to the 6th Ct AD, parts of marble columns and ECh column capitals, and 30 LRom-ECh bronze coins. To the W of the site, the line of the earlier shoreline could be traced. In the waterlogged conditions, the trunks of about 32 trees had been preserved. Samples have been sent for dendrochonological and environmental analysis. At the Strimenou plot, a large LRom-EByz structure of two rooms (room 1, 7.3m by 3.4m; room 2, 6.3m by 3.8m) yielded LRom-EByz pottery and six bronze coins. At the Kanta plot, an earlier (ERom) structure with five rooms yielded plain pottery and glassware of the 1st Ct AD. In the course of constructing the Egnatia Odos, close to the harbour, another (LRom?) three room structure with loomweights, probably a workshop, came to light (ADelt, 508-09). Finds include a bronze 'sliding scale' with several hooks (Fig. 140). Nearby were two (LRom? ECh?) tile graves and two cist graves, the only finds from which were some bronze coins. r 140.

Nomos of Kerkyra (Corfu) (7th EPCA; 8th EBA) Kerkyra. A. Karamanou (ADelt, 485-87) notes minor changes to the Museum of Asian Art. The museum at Mon Repos, the former residence of the British governor built in Regency style (and birthplace of Prince Philip), has undergone a more thorough re-furbishment. Exhibitions will combine information about the archaeology of the area, as well as exhibits concentrating specifically on the period of British rule, and especially the 'Regency'. G. Avgerinou, M. Nakou, I. Faklari, A. Karamanou, E. Marandou and G. Riginos (ADelt, 486-94) report on excavations at ten locations within the town, revealing much more about the Cl and Hel city. At O. Phigerato (Dimisianou plot), a concentration of Ar, Cl and Hel sherds (and a bronze coin of Kerkyra of 300-229 BC) around a well suggests a workshop in the area. Also in the area of Phigerato (Montsenigou plot), a /. 30m, w. 2.5m stretch of an anc. (Cl?) road leading to the Hyllaikos/harbour was partially covered by a later, rectangular Hel structure with at least four rooms, measuring 3.6m by 2.3m and 5.4m by 4.5m. Finds from this and earlier phases include 68 bronze coins, dating from the 4th Ct BC to 138 BC, bronze pins and fish-hooks, two javelin heads, numerous terracotta figurines, loomweights, stamped amphora handles and plain pottery, suggesting connections with both trade and fishing. Pits, wells and a tile tomb were later dug into this Hel building. At Kanoni (Konophaou plot), a 17.5m stretch of an anc. road with two retaining walls (both incorporating earlier material) seems to date to Hel times, to judge by the material found in a nearby well (which also had some residual Ar sherds, a bronze coin and a female terracotta figurine). At O. Nausikas (Komboliti plot), a structure with a destruction level of tile collapse incorporating a rectangular clay structure yielded large quantities of plain Hel pottery, Cor black-glaze pottery of the L 4th to 3rd Ct BC, 37 bronze coins, a silver Cor drachma of the L 4th to 3rd Ct BC, the handle of a bronze cup in the form of a dog (L 4th Ct BC) and two lead weights. Such an assemblage is clearly connected with trade. At O. Nausikas O.T. 559A (Dimitra AE plot), several buildings came to light. The walls of building A, 11.5m by 7.5m, were partially covered by plaster, and its floor by hydraulic cement, and it has been interpreted as part of a bathhouse. Associated plain and painted (drinking) pottery and lamps are of Hel date. Building B, 16m by 5m, was surrounded by a layer of Cor and Laconian tiles, some stamped Eni0EP2IA. Other finds include Hel plain household pottery (such as amphoraE) and Hel bronze coins of Kerkyra (issues of 300-229 and 229-148 BC), suggesting a date of construction in the 4th Ct BC and use throughout Hel times. Nearby was a stone hearth, for cooking, and in the farthest corner a n shaped structure yielded 200 loomweights, Cl matrices for terracottas, Cl and Ar plain vessels and bronze tools, and has been interpreted as a 'cult' site. Further excavation at O. Nausikas 19 (Asinoti plot), revealed walls beneath a Hel destruction horizon of collapsed tile which seem to belong to several phases of houses. Finds include Ar to Hel pottery (including ProtoCor kotylai), a conical oinochoe, terracotta figurines, bronze tools and bronze coins, comprising one issue of Kephallenia (431-330 BC) and several of Kerkyra (of both 300-229 and 229-148 BC). Investigation around the small church of Agios Athanasios reveals that it is built over a Cl rectangular tower of isodomic masonry (L 5th, E 4th Ct BC) that guarded the anc. harbour of Alkinoos. 142. Korytiani: Byz jewellery</page><page sequence="86">86 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. At the junction of O. Kyprou and the 8l parodos of O. Alkinoou (Tourouki plot), 63 Ar, Cl and Hel graves belonging to the Garitsa cemetery, some already looted, came to light. They were of the usual types: four large pithoi; eleven smaller pithoi, containing the bones of children; three tile; 22 trench; 23 cremations in urns of various kinds and six other cremations. At the Arion plot, near the anc. bay of Garitsa, more walls probably belonging to harbour installations or ship-sheds came to light. Associated finds include Ar and later pottery, 312 bronze coins and 222 loomweights. Some walls had been re-used to form parts of six graves, one Rom grave in a glass ungentarium, another with a plaque inscribed EN0AAE KEITE 0IOT AE02 EnEIKTHTOS ETON K[. These Rom structures provide a taq for the use of the harbour. Excavation beneath the Olive Oil Institute in Palaiopoli revealed a 3.7m by 2.6m section of a large M-LRom mosaic floor (Fig. 143) dating to the 2nd to 5th Ct AD, and probably belonging to the known bath complex from this area. 143.

Akamatis (AEMTH 18 [2004], 649 60) discusses the rescue excavation in a field 4.4km from Kato Kleines, where a mosaic floor with an anavrytirio was revealed, now exhibited in the Museum of Fiorina. The archi tectural features include a yard with a well, a peristylion, a room interpreted as an andron, a room with mosaic floor interpreted as a triclinium, along with ancillary rooms, hygiene rooms and a kitchen. Pipes for hot water indicate the existence of a bath. The mosaic floor, decorated with geometric motifs, dates to L 2nd-E 3rd Ct AD. The building appears to be a villa constructed in the LHel period and destroyed in the M 3rd Ct AD. Nomos of Kozani and Grevena (30th EPCA; 17th EBA) Eordaia cave, Agia Paraskevi. G.

Clay vessels and figurines (depicting cupids and female figures) are the predominant grave goods, while metal artefacts represent excellent samples of local workshops. Fillotsairi Mavropigis, Ptolemaida. G. Karamitrou Mentessidi, To Vima (29/11/2005), notes the investigation of the Neo settlement, inhabited for a short period of time.

Fifteen looted pit graves have also been investigated in the area. Attic pottery of 6th Ct BC has been recovered, depicting komastai, sirens and lions. Kozani and Grevena prefectures. G Karamitrou-Mentessidi (AEMTH 18 [2004], 609-22) reports on the survey undertaken in the area to be flooded by the new Ilarion hydroelectric dam in the M reach of the Aliakmon river. The sites located are: Longas and Potamia-Hrapa near Elati, Gavros near Palioura, Tsiouka Levendi, Panayia, Parakoustis, Plaka, Gourna Tsapa, Samara Platania, Gefyra and Vromonera near Panayia (Tornikios) and Ktio and Panayia near Diporos. The 1st and the last two are large, organized Hel settlements with phases of earlier use. Remains of baths and workshops as well as cemeteries were revealed. Finds collected during the survey include PH stone tools, Neo, BA, IA and Hel pottery, loomweights, coins, jewellery and weapons. The protection and management of the antiquities threatened by large construction works in this area, where dozens of archaeological sites have already been destroyed by previous large works (e.g., the Polyphytou dam), is discussed. Grevena, Matsouka Rachi, Knidi. G Karamitrou-Mentessidi, To Vima (191 \ 1/2005), reports on the investigation of the ENeo settlement. Along with pottery, figurines and tools, a concen tration of lithic debitage was recovered, indicating stone tools were manufactured from imported materials at the site. Samarina. N. Efstratiou, P. Biagi. P. Elefanti and M. Dinou (AEMTH 18 [2004], 623-30) and Kathimerini (06/08/2006) report on the survey investigation of the NW Grevena province (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 68). Eight new open-air sites of mainly MPal date were located in the area delimited by the villages of Samarina, Smixi and Philippei, in almost alpine environs, along watersheds and close to water and flint sources. Watersheds seem to function as passages between mountainous areas, with Pal hunter-gatherer groups moving across upland areas and not just along rivers, as previously thought. Five trial trenches were excavated in sites Samarina 8 and 15, yielding a charcoal layer containing a few chert artefacts of either M or Upper Pal date, small potsherds, as well as a fireplace. Pindos. G Pikoulas (AEMTH 18 [2004], 641-47) presents the findings of the 3rd season of the University of Thessaly research project 'Crossing the Pindos: road network and defense' (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 68). The investigation focused on the borderland between the prefectures of Grevena, Ioaninna and Trikala. The routes of the two S-most arteries, nos. 5 and 6, were examined together with the local defense points (Katafiyi and Petra). Aliakmon area. E. Panagopoulou, K. Charvati, P. Karkanas, A.

Fossil specimens (48) dated to the LPliocene-EPleistocene and 22 lithic artefacts dated mostly to LPleistocene (M and Upper Pal) were collected.</page><page sequence="87">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 87 The Grevena Paleolithic Survey. Eleni Panagopoulou (EPS) and Katerina Harvati (ASCSA, New York University, Max Planck Institut) report on the 2nd season of the three-year survey project: 'Following the findings of the 2004 season (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 68-69), the survey area was expanded to include the Kostarazi region in the Prefecture of Kastoria, the area of the Polyphytos reservoir on the Aliakmon river near Kozani and the area of the new dam to the S of Grevena, near Karpero village. According to previous work, these areas were the most promising for preserving Pleistocene palaeontological and archaeological sites. Preliminary reconnaissance was also conducted along the lower route of the Aliakmon near Veroia and in the Ptolemais area. The richest localities in lithic material proved to be the site of Polemistra on the SW margin of lake Polyphytos and Karpero, near the construction area of the new dam of Aliakmon. No lithic assemblages were found inside the longi tudinal profiles of the terraces. The localities that yielded the richest faunal remains included the Kostarazi and Livakos areas. In the area of Karpero, as well as in most other localities investigated, there were long sequences of cross stratified pebble-rich layers and sandstone banks (probably bars and channel deposits) grading to a series of brownish or grey paleosols (overbank deposits). As in 2004, many of these sequences yielded either no or very few fossil specimens. With the exception of Livakos and Kostarazi no dense accumulations of fossil material were noted. One hundred and twenty one fossil specimens (compared to 48 in 2004) were collected. The faunal list was expanded in 2005 with the addition of Hippopotamus, Elephas antiquus, a squid specimen and a large rodent, not yet identified. Once more, equids and ruminants predominate, with a strong presence of proboscideans. Based on the fauna, the dating of these localities appears for the most part to be of EPleistocene age (Livakos) or later (Kostarazi). Fifty two lithic artefacts were collected in 2005, mostly from Polemistra and Karpero (compared to 22 in 2004). Nineteen lithic artefacts from Polemistra include large flakes, several cores, bifacially worked tools and choppers. All were fashioned from river pebbles of a green, coarse-grained volcanic material. Their technology suggests LPal dates, although no uniquely characteristic LPal artefacts (such as handaxes) were found. Furthermore, the technical characteris tics, raw material and location of these finds suggest that they belong to the same wider assemblage as the Aiani biface (see 144. Dispilio: shells and shell jewellery AR 51 [2004-2005], 68-69), which was also found nearby. Lithics found at Karpero include nine artefacts, mostly large cores, one chopper and one flake. The raw material was again volcanic pebbles, probably and?site or basalt. Their technology suggests an E age for this assemblage, although no character istic LPal tool types were found. Finally, human remains belonging to two individuals were recovered, both dated to the Neo or later periods. One skeleton was found near the N side of Rymnion bridge on lake Polyphytos, probably associated with an anc. cemetery located in the vicinity. The 2nd individual was found in the Goules quarry and was associated with pottery sherds. Nomos of Kastoria (29th EPCA; 16th EBA) Avgi. G Stratouli (AEMTH 18 [2004], 661-68), Eleftherotypia (01/08/2005) reports on the inter-disciplinary research project at the Neo settlement, which appears to belong to the flat, extended type of site. At least four occupational phases have been recognized, covering a period from 5600/5500 to 5000/4900 BC, according to C14 dates. A total of ten rectangular buildings have been recovered, ranging in size from 35m2 to 90m2. Architectural remains show a variety of building materials and techniques used for their construction: ditches with post-holes served as the foundation of wattle-and-daub or pis? walls, but mud-brick walls also occurred. Floors were clay plastered and covered with a thin layer of organic material. Finds are numerous: ceramic vessels including miniature ones, chipped and ground stone tools, bone tools, clay figurines, clay seals and part of a flute made out of bone. Dispilio. R. Veropoulidou and F. Ifantidis (AEMTH 18 [2004], 669-86) present the study of the shell and shell jewellery assemblage (Fig. 144) from the Neo settlement, providing much information on dietary habits and personal adornment. Pentavrysos. Ch. Tsougaris (AEMTH 18 [2004], 687-94) reports on the rescue excavation of a Cl cemetery that brought to light eleven adult pit graves, a larger cist grave and a grave stone marker bearing the 4th Ct BC inscription MaxaTCbc/AiKKvpov. Female burials, looted already in antiquity, contained bronze jewellery (double pins and four engraved rings depicting a stag, a goat, a woman and Pan). In male burials iron knives, spearheads and a strigil were uncovered. All the graves contained ceramic vessels. The Attic black-painted and rf ones date from M 5th to L 4th Ct BC and include some sherds of a Panathenaic rf amphora of the L 5th Ct BC. Local vessels show a great variety in form and techniques (e.g., cut-neck jars, Macedonian amphorae). The rarity of the finds, along with the prominent position of the cemetery, reinforces the hypothesis of the existence of the Cl royal city in its vicinity. Nomos of Pella (17th EPCA; 11th EBA) Pella. M. Akamati, Ta Nea (13/02/2006), To Vima and Kathimerini (11/02/2006), report on the discovery of a rock carved vaulted grave E of the anc. cemetery. A 16m /. dromos leads to a central hall surrounded by eight chambers (total area 63m2), all contain colourful plaster decorations and pedestals for the burial klinae. Although the grave was looted, many ceramic vessels and figurines were recovered, along with jewellery, bronze coins, parts of wreaths and three inscribed funeral stelae marking female burials. The grave, which probably belongs to a wealthy family, dates to the 3rd/2nd Ct BC.</page><page sequence="88">88 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. I. Akamatis, Kathimerini (16/02/2006), reports on the discovery of part of a L 5 th Ct BC cemetery, underneath the road of the anc. agora. Rf vessels for drinking, eating and aromatic oils, figurines, bronze and silver fibulae, farming tools, athletes' items, ceramic feeders and toys for children (clay models of doves, wheels and furniture) are amongst the most common grave goods, along with funerary stelae inscribed with the names of the deceased. Archontiko Giannitson. A. Chrysostomou and P. Chrysostomou (AEMTH 18 [2004], 561-71) report on the rescue excavations in the W necropolis (see also AR 49 [2002 2003], 59; AR 50 [2003-2004], 44; AR 51 [2004-2005], 70). One hundred and forty one graves were investigated, taking the total number of graves to 541. IA graves include 34 cist and pit graves with inhumations accompanied by ceramic vessels, gold and bronze jewellery and, in one case, a sword. To the Ar period belong 50 inhumations in pit gravesl and three cremations in urns. Male burials are often accompanied by sword, spears and knives, while six of them also have helmets. Other grave goods include jewellery (gold epistomia, rings, bronze pins, glass and faience beads), bronze (lebes, phialae) and ceramic vessels (kylikes, oinochoae, aryballoi, exaleiptra, phialae, skyphoi, amphoriskoi), iron furniture and carriage models, a glass aryballos, clay and faience figurines. Female burials were accompanied by gold and silver jewellery (diadems, leaves, pendants, earrings, pins, rings, bracelets, necklaces, epistomia), glass and amber beads, bronze vessels (lebes, phialae, oinochoae), ceramic vessels (phialae, Attic kylikes, skyphoi, exaleiptra, Cor aryballoi, kotyllae, lekythia), terracotta figurines, faience aryballoi, glass amphoriskoi and iron carriage models. One of the seventeen female graves was a cremation: in a column krater with silver jewellery as grave goods, which dates it to the E 5th Ct BC. To the Cl and EHel periods belong 56 graves, mostly pit, a few tile and one cist grave, dating from the 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC to the E 3rd Ct BC. Most of them are accompanied by bronze coins. Notable is a hoard of seven coins of Alexander III in a skyphidio. Burials commonly contain fibulae, earrings, pendants and seal rings. Seven burials were also accompanied by gilt bronze myrtle wreaths. Ceramic vessels are commonly found in both male and female graves and include skyphoi, lekythoi, pelikes, oinochoai, pyxides, amphorae, lekanidae, kantharoi, alabastra and lamps. Male burials were also accompanied by iron weaponry (spears and swords) and strigils. Finally, new evidence for the Macedonian custom of funerary symposia is provided by sets of bronze vessels (kantharos, jug, kylix, ladle, skyphos, amphora with a lid, kalykes, stamnoid kadoi with elaborate decoration) uncovered in four graves. Edessa. A. Chrysostomou (AEMTH 18 [2004], 591-608) reports on rescue excavations conducted in a plot at O. A. Meletiou and Korai in the centre of the acropolis of the anc. city. LHel and ECh architectural remains were uncovered. To the LHel period belong walls (some of them particularly strong and well constructed) that bound three spaces (A, B, T). The features found in these spaces include hearths, floors and cavities for storage jars. Portable finds include everyday vessels (storage vessels/pithoi, amphorae, oinochoae, kettles), tableware (oxivafa pinakia, kantharoi, hydriae, olpae, black-painted and megaric skyphoi, impressed amphorae, along with W slope, red painted, barbotine or thorn ware), oil lamps, loomweights, stone and iron tools, figurines and coins. Below space T the lower part of a pottery kiln was revealed, possibly dating to the 3rd Ct BC. In the W part of the plot traces of the earlier use of the space were revealed. The finds suggest IA and Ar dates. Aridaia-Loutraki. E. Kabouroglou, I. Bassiakos and D. Bouzas (AEMTH 18 [2004], 573-89) report on the inter-disci plinary investigation of cave A, conducted by the EPS, in collaboration with the University of Thessaloniki and the Demokritos Research Center. The investigation provides evidence for the history of the cave from the Upper Pleistocene onwards. Two distinct depositional phases are recognized, the older dated in the Upper Pleistocene and the later in the LQuaternary-EHolocene. In the later phase deposits of animal bones, belonging mainly to Ursus spelaeus are found. A complete cranium of this species was recovered during the 2004 excavation. It seems that the cave was not used by humans before the LNeo period. As the finds (hearths and sherds) and C14 dates suggest, the cave was used as a shelter during the LNeo and BA. Nomos of Imathia (17th EPCA; 11th EBA) Veroia. L. Stefani (AEMTH 18 [2004], 485-94) reports on the excavation of ten Ar graves in O. Monastiriou, probably belonging to an organized cemetery. They are all pit graves, containing nine inhumations and one cremation, dated to the M 6th Ct BC. The largest grave (grave 5) contained a male burial accompanied by metal weaponry (spear, dagger and knife) and tools, a bronze lebes, a clay figurine in the shape of a kouros and a plastic vessel in the shape of a kneeling man. The latter are possibly of E Ionic provenance. Grave 6 contained a female and infant burial, accompanied by three metal pins, a dagger, three clay vessels (a bucchero oinochoe, a Cor amphoriskos and an exaleiptron) and two clay figurines (depicting a sitting woman and a sitting goddess), both of E Ionic types. Grave 8 contained a male burial accompanied by a spear and a dagger, two metal pins, a gold epistomion and six vessels, two locally made (a kantharoid kotyle and a cup) and four imported (an Attic black-painted aphoriskos, an Ionic kylix and two Cor aryballoi). The osteological study of the human bones indicates an intense use of the upper body and protracted horse riding, justifying the assumption that they were warriors. Finally, a synopsis of the known data suggests that there were several settlements in the area before Veroia developed into a Hel city. E. Psara (AEMTH 18 [2004], 495-508) reports on the inves tigation of a burial tumulus in the SE of the mod. city where remains of a Macedonian tomb were discovered. It seems that tomb building material had been plundered during anc. times. The monument had two chambers and a descending dromos with built sides. From the fa?ade of the building only two Ionic bases of half-columns remain in situ. However, the fa?ade was of Cor order, as a Cor half-capital found in the fill of the anc. trench indicates. The interior must have been painted, as evidenced by the numerous pieces of polychrome plaster. The fragmented door of the chamber has relief decoration on both sides and a Gorgoneion on the upper part. Fragments of at least two marble structures show that the tomb housed more than one burial. Very scant remains of grave goods include gold leaves, probably belonging to a wreath, a coloured glass alabastron and a bronze chain. The tomb dates within the 2nd quarter of the 3rd Ct BC. To the S of the tomb part of an anc. road (w. 6m) leading from Veroia to Aiges and Pieria was revealed. Its course was confirmed with trial trenches for a distance of 42m. Vergina (anc. Aiges). A. Kottaridi (AEMTH 18 [2004], 527-41) reports on the rescue excavation within the mod. village, where 24 6th Ct BC pit graves, all but one looted, were discovered. These finds confirm the assumption that the Ar and Cl cemetery lies SW of the tumuli cemetery, beneath the mod. village.</page><page sequence="89">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 89 On the occasion of construction works, excavations took place in the area of the 'group B' burials and the NW sector of the anc. city. In the 'group B' area two El A and remains of four LAr pit graves were investigated, along with part of a LAr building with thick walls (w. lm) and a half buried pithos in a corner. Above the LAr building a defensive wall (w. ca 2m) possibly with a small tower, and a building, all dated to the Cl period, were revealed. The tower was destroyed during the construction of the Hel building. To the NE of the 'group B' part of the walls (/. 56m) of the anc. city of Aiges was uncovered, with a small gate in the middle. The wall is characterized by two building phases, separated by a destruction layer. Two symmet rically placed towers reinforced the defences. The gate has two pilasters, a threshold and an aperture of 3m w. In the gate deposits ten black-painted boisai skyphoi were found, dating to the M 4th Ct BC and giving a taq for the wall's construction. In the L 2th Ct BC buildings were built upon the gate and in the vicinity of the wall, all abandoned and destroyed in E Imperial times, probably due to a natural disaster. GN. Tsokas, G Vargemezis, P. Tsourlos, S. Drougou, Ch. Saatsoglou-Paliadeli and K. Tokmakidis (AEMTH 18 [2004], 551-60) present some of the findings of the geophysical survey (geo-electrical mapping) carried out on the archaeolog ical site. M. Manoledakis, To Vima (17/02/2006), based on the study of the co-ordinates of Ptolemy (2nd Ct AD) and their mathe matical adjustment to mod. maps, argues against the identifica tion of mod.

Kottaridi (AEMTH 18 [2004], 543-50) reports on rescue excavations conducted on the occasion of water supply works. Ten new sites were located: a Neo site, a BA cemetery, three EIA installations, a PH megalithic monument, part of an anc. stone paved road, LHel and later graves and the architectural features of an E Imperial Ionic marble temple. At the site of Paliomelissa part of an anc. cemetery spanning the period from the LAr to Hel was investigated. Eleven cist graves date to the 3th-2nd Ct BC. The burial of a warrior accompanied by a short Macedonian sword and an equestrian sarisa is noteworthy. To the LAr period belong 43 pit graves. Male burials were accompanied by metal pins, rings, epistomia, weaponry (knives, spears, shafts, swords), bronze and ceramic vessels (lebes, lekanae, phialae, exaleiptra). In one case a ceramic gorgoneion guarded the deceased. In another case, iron tools along with weaponry accompanied a stone worker. Female burials were furnished with pins, and silver and gold jewellery (pendants, earrings, necklaces, rings, bracelets). In some cases, bunches of bracelets and rings also adorned the feet and toes of women, who also carried arms, specifically knives. Figurines are rare in contrast to the numerous ceramic vessels (exaleiptra, myrodocheia, kylikes, skyphoi, kantharoi, kraters, lebites) deriving from local, E Ionic and Cor, but mainly Attic bf workshops (notably the Aimon painter). The cemetery is argued to belong to the area of anc. Levei. Lefkadia. M. Lilimbaki-Akamati and K. Trochidis (AEMTH 18 [2004], 465-84) present a new Macedonian tomb (Fig. 145) discovered near the anc. dromos of the Krisis tomb (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 71). A mod. road and irrigation networks built on top of it have destroyed its superstructure. It is a two-chamber tomb (interior dimensions 6.50m by 4.10m) with a barrel-vaulted roof and a fa?ade with Ionic architectural features, dated to the L 4th or E 3th Ct BC. The grave goods include clay vessels (black-painted skyphidio and perfume flasks), iron weaponry and tools, the rim of a bronze vessel, a gold necklace, beads and shells. The tomb has the basic char acteristics of the known sepulchral monuments with Ionic fa?ades. Certain architectural details suggest, however, an earlier date than the others in this group. Leukopetra. T.G. Antikas and L. Wynn-Antikas (AEMTH 18 [2004], 519-25) discuss the results of the osteological analysis of the male burial (M 2nd Ct BC) found in a room of a Hel building (see AR 50 [2003-2004], 46). A lozenge-shaped trauma between the thoracic vertebrae indicates the complete penetration of the spine by some sharp projectile, most probably an oxybelos thrown by a tension or torsion catapult. A short history of the evolution of catapults from the E 4l to the E 3rd Ct BC is added and the differences between projectiles and arrowheads are underlined. Toumba Angelochoriou. L. Stefani, S.M. Valamoti and A. Konstantinidou (AEMTH 18 [2004], 431-48) summarize the research programme in the PH settlement (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 71-72). Initial observations based on the strati graphic study suggest two habitation phases, separated by fire destruction, without any major changes in spatial organization. The 1st phase begins at the end of the 16th Ct BC and the 2nd in the 13th to M 12* Ct BC. The results of the archaeobotanical and archaeozoological study are also discussed, regarding farming and stockbreeding, as well as the diet of the inhabitants. R. Christidou (AEMTH 18 [2004], 439-54) presents the study of the bone artefacts recovered during the excavations of the settlement. She discusses the technology, function and use of bone tools. Toumba Polyplatanou. N. Merousis and L. Stefani (AEMTH 18 [2004], 455-64) report on the latest excavation of the Neo settlement. The architectural remains were the same as those of previous excavation periods (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 72): debris of mud-brick walls, possibly laid on stone foundations, and buff-coloured floors, all in such a fragmentary condition that reconstruction of the structures is impossible. Stratigraphie study from all excavation seasons suggests two habitation phases, without changes in architectural practices, both of which ended with fires. Finally, preliminary results based on the cataloguing and study of pottery are presented (see also AR 50 [2003-2004], 45). 145.

Anagnostopoulou-Chatzipolichroni (AEMTH 18 [2004], 73-84) reports on excavations conducted in the SE sector of the anc. city (see also AR 50 [2003-2004], 46; AR 49 [2002-2003], 65; AR 48 [2001-2002], 81-82). Four buildings and a public area were investigated E of the road's retaining wall and one building S of it. Buildings V, VI and VIII were probably private houses with rooms arranged around a central open yard. Some of the rooms appeared to have been used as workshops. Building IX also has several rooms, but its use remains unclear. Building X has stone paved rooms and a yard with a cistern. At least one of the rooms was used as a workshop. In the public area (%upo? VII) a stoa and a circular cistern were revealed. Rich finds, dating from the 1st to 3rd Ct AD, include ceramic and glass vessels, ceramic lamps, a bronze lamp with its bracket (Fig. 146), an iron lamp, bone and metal artefacts, iron tools, bronze keys, millstones, loomweights, clay plaques (notably one depicting a wild boar), terracotta figurines and a stone pendant in the shape of a foot. Numerous coins were recovered (among them a hoard of 58 coins in building IX), most of them dating to 2nd-3rd Ct AD, while earlier coinage is also represented. In all spaces earlier habitation phases were present, dating from EIA to Hel times. The most important earlier finds are a stone mould for casting arrows and the stone head of a horse with incised figures of animals, both dating to the IA, along with a Hel terracotta figurine mould in the shape of a cupid with a swan.

Nomos of Thessalonike (16th EPCA, 9th EBA) Thessalonike (centre). P. Adam-Veleni and D. Ignatiadou, Eleftherotypia (31/05/2006), Ethnos (09-10/05/2006), report on the re-examination of the famous Derveni papyrus, one of the most important exhibits at the Archaeological Museum. The papyrus (M 4th Ct BC), recovered in 1962, survived a funeral pyre. It is a philosophical treatise on the nature of the gods, cosmology and cosmogony, the theory of the soul and the nature of religious rites in the form of an interpretation of an earlier Orphic poem. The study is undertaken by D. Obbink (University of Oxford) and A. Pieris (Institute of Philosophical Research, Patras), with technical support by R. Mcfarlane and J. Ware (Brigham Young University, Utah). It involves the multi spectral analysis and digital imaging of the papyrus fragments in order to translate, edit and comment on the preserved text. Anc. agora. P. Adam-Veleni (AEMTH 18 [2004], 225-38) reports on the discovery of a building under the marble pavement of the agora square, mentioned by F. Petsas in 1967 but never located. The building, dated to the 2nd quarter of the 2nd Ct BC, has a fountain. Worth noting is that the substruc ture of the E part of the building is constructed exclusively of spolia from earlier buildings. Most of them come from a vaulted grave, probably of the Macedonian type, dating to the M 3rd Ct BC. 146. Palatiano: Rom bronze lamp Palace of Galerius. F. Athanasiou, V. Malama, M. Miza and M. Sarantidou (AEMTH 18 [2004], 239-54) discuss the construction phases of the octagon room. The 1st construction phase dates from 308 AD, when Galerius' official headquarters was transferred from Serdiki to Thessalonike, to 311 AD and the death of Galerius. In this phase the foundations of the vestibule and the octagon room, as well as part of their upper walls were built. In the 2nd phase, during the reign of Constantine the Great, the building was probably converted into a church and the upper walls, vestibule and peristyle were completed. The completion of the interior decoration dates to the 4th Ct AD. In the 3rd phase, dated to the 5th Ct AD, a tomb was built in the large niche and two rooms were externally attached to it. In the 7th Ct AD, a period when Thessalonike was devastated by severe earthquakes, the octagon was destroyed and the vestibule was converted into a cistern. F. Athanasiou, V. Malama, M. Miza and M. Sarantidou (AEMTH 18 [2004], 255-68), discuss the construction and decoration of the marble wall veneering and the marble floor of the octagon, for which almost all the types of marble available in Greece and Egypt during L Antiquity were used. M. Tsimbidou-Avloniti and A. Kaiafa (AEMTH 18 [2004], 269-78) report on a rescue excavation in a plot at O. K. Melenikou inside the E wall of anc. Thessalonike, in the broader area of the E cemetery (just to the S of the plot excavated in 2003, see AR 51 [2004-2005], 73). Twenty four burials were investigated (tile roofed, cist and pit graves), along with funeral altar constructions, dated to the \x -2th Ct AD. Inhumations predominate, while three cremations were also found. Only few yielded grave goods, the most notable being a glass perfume cruet in the shape of a bird, three glass orbs containing cosmetic white material and ochre, two iron spatulas, a clay theatre mask, clay figurines depicting Venus and cupid and a wooden comb. Three more cases of so-called 'plaster burials' were identified (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 73). Of great interest is the practice of successive graves, usually of different types, placed exactly one on top of the other, implying some kind of relationship between the dead. At O. Tritis Septemvriou, M. Tsimbidou-Avloniti, Eleftherotypia (15/02/2004) notes three Hel-Rom graves recovered during the construction works for the new City Hall, belonging to the anc.

At O. Elaias 11, K. Soueref (AEMTH 18 [2004], 328-35) reports on the rescue excavation in a plot in the SE part of the Ar-Cl settlement, where remains dated from the EBA to the 4th Ct BC were revealed. To the EBA belong storage pits, filled with pottery, animal bones and shells. During the El A (until the 7th Ct BC) the area continued to be used for storing goods, as beehive-shaped storage pits suggest. In the 6th Ct BC thick retaining walls were built. In the spaces delineated by them, house rooms, a storage area and a courtyard existed in the 5th 4th Ct BC. In one of the rooms, under its destruction layer, a concentration of vessels (amphorae, hydriae, jars, kanastra, ladles, strainer), indicating a collapsed dresser, and numerous loomweights were revealed, all dating to the 4th Ct BC. At O. Empedokleous 13-15, part of a building was investi gated. In one of the two excavated rooms a built square structure bearing traces of fire was found, along with two mud brick escharae. Burnt pottery (an Attic bf column krater and local pottery), animal bones (notably dear antlers) and a large knife were found on one of the two escharae. The other room served storage purposes. The building appears to have had a sacral character and was in use in the L 6* and 5th Cts BC. E environs of Thessalonike Karabournaki. M. Tiverios, E. Manakidou and D. Tsiafaki (AEMTH 18 [2004], 337-44) report on the excavation of the Ar settlement. The architectural remains investigated relate to pithoi, storage areas and semi-subterranean beehive structures (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 75). Two contemporaneous pits were also explored, one related to food preparation activities and the other to cooking. The latter's thick burnt fill contained bones, shells, clay to line the hearth and large quantities of pottery, dated to the L 8th and the 1st half of the 7th Ct BC. The pottery assemblage is mainly comprised of local grey ware cooking vessels, oinochoae and eggshell kylikes, along with imported amphorae for transporting oil and wine. The presence of Cypro-Phoenician pottery supports earlier evidence of the presence of Phoenician merchants in the area. Souroti. K. Soueref and K. Ch?vela (AEMTH 18 [2004], 345-56) report on the excavation in the anc. cemetery. In total 115 graves were investigated; mostly pit graves, some cist graves and a few enchytrismoi in pithoid vessels. Almost half the burials did not have any grave goods, while metal objects and vessels accompanied the others. Pottery includes local (kettles and exaleiptra predominate) and imported (6th Ct BC Cor exaleiptron and some L 6th and 5th Ct BC Attic kylikes and skyphoi) vessels. Metal objects include gold and bronze jewellery and iron weaponry. The remains of a building were also investigated, including a room with a hearth, a room with a larger hearth and a bench, interpreted as a workshop and a storage room.

The rest of space B was uncovered, while two more adjacent spaces, T and A, were investigated. The four spaces (A-A) share front and back walls and are 35m /. In space B, a high bench is built against three of the walls (apart from the fa?ade), while in the middle of the rear wall there is a built pedestal for a statue. In front of it a rectangular structure assembled of three marble slabs served as the base of a marble four-legged table, several pieces of which were found in situ. The evidence testifies to the sacred character of the space. In space T, a long pedestal for statues was built against the rear wall, while to a poros floor slab in the middle of the room was affixed the marble base of an oversized statue of Octavian Augustus, of which parts of the arms and legs, along with the inset head, were found. A female marble head, probably a portrait of Flavia Mysta, is connected with the pedestal and is mentioned in an inscription found in front of this space, which dates the construction of the space to 86 AD. On the basis of this inscription and the other finds it appears that the 1st temple (spaces A and B) was destroyed in the M 1st Ct AD and was re-built, evidently by Flavia Mysta, together with the new spaces T and A. Space A, partially investigated, had an auxiliary character (a storeroom or possibly a workshop). Outside space A, a circular lime kiln was built in the M 3rd Ct AD, after the destruction of the Sebasteion. At least 200 statue fragments, architectural features and inscriptions were found inside and in front of the kiln. Nomos of Pieria (27th EPCA; 9th EBA?]) Paliambela. K. Kotsakis and P. Halstead report on the excavation of this Neo settlement: 'The investigation on top of the settlement brought to light 3-4 MNeo free-standing rectangular dwellings heavily damaged by ploughing. They were built in pis? technique. The best preserved dwelling has two rooms in one of which a clay construction is found. It appears that during the MNeo the settlement was densely inhabited with closely-set rectangular buildings separated by cobbled yards. There is some evidence that habitation shifted across the site in the MNeo. In this phase the settlement was encircled by at least one ditch. MNeo pottery links the settlement with both the S Balkans and Thessaly. The new evidence from the N sector, where the ENeo layers were revealed, indicates that the ENeo settlement was more loosely inhabited suggesting a different habitation pattern in the earliest phase of the settlement. The pottery from this phase shows close relationships with Thessaly.' M. Katsianis and S. Tsipidis, Kathimerini (12/02/2006), present the digital documentation of archaeological data using Geographic Information System (GIS), applied in the excavation of the Neo settlement. Revenia, Korinos. M. Bessios and F. Adaktylou (AEMTH 18 [2004], 357-66) resumed research in the ENeo settlement (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 78). The excavation covered an area of 850m2, while the total area of the settlement is estimated at 4ha. The architectural remains consist of 86 pits (circular or rectangular) hewn out of the bedrock. Large pits were identified as semi-subterranean dwellings, while the small ones were interpreted as storage pits. Five burials in a crouched position, typical of the Neo, were found within the investigated area</page><page sequence="92">92 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. On the basis of pottery style, two sub-phases are distin guished. Monochrome wares dominate in the earlier sub phase, which also produced a small number of barbotine vessels. In the next sub-phase, along with the monochrome and barbotine wares, a considerable amount of pottery with painted decoration (Fig. 147) is found. Vessels with anthropomorphic plastic decoration also belong to this phase. Other finds include sling bullets, ear studs, clay bobbins, figurines with character istic 'coffee bean' eyes and a large number of stone and bone tools. The abundant animal bones appear to derive from goats, sheep, bovines and pigs, while among the large quantities of shells the species cerastoderma glaucum predominates. Nea Agathoupoli, anc. Methone. M. Bessios, A. Athanasiadou, E. Gerofoka and M. Christakou-Tolia (AEMTH 18 [2004], 367-76) report on excavations conducted in plots in the area of the anc. settlement (see also AR 51 [2004 2005], 78). I n plot 274, on top of the hill, investigations in a subterranean space reached a depth of 8.5m, without locating the floor. The available evidence suggests that it was a storage space constructed at the end of the 8th Ct BC. The abundant finds include pottery of various workshops (Euboia, Ionia, Corinth, Cyclades, Attica, Thermaic gulf), carved ivory, bone and antler pieces, and metallurgical remains (slags, crucibles, stone and clay moulds). On the W slope of the hill, part of a large building complex was investigated, interpreted as a monumental public building, developed in three phases. The S wing belongs to the 1st phase, dated to the 1st half of the 6th Ct BC. A room had evidence of metallurgical activities (two pieces of gold talents, a piece of molten gold, slags and part of a stone mould). The middle wing belongs to the 2nd phase, dated to the end of the 6th Ct BC and the N stoa to the 3rd phase, probably chronologically close to the others. NW of this a 2nd monumental building was located, though not investigated. In plot 245 an area with IA storage pithoi was investigated, along with an IA defensive ditch and a tunnel leading out of the settlement. Dion. D. Pandermalis (AEMTH 18 [2004], 377-82) reports on the progress of the excavations. To the E of the Sanctuary of Asklepios the remains of a Hel building were uncovered. In the area of activity from L Antiquity excavations continued in an adjacent street and in a large building consisting of three large spaces. In the Hydraulis sector a building square was investi gated. In the Sanctuary of Zeus Ipsistos three spaces were investigated to the N and E of the temple, characterized as worship areas by the finds (e.g., inscribed small votive columns). Moreover, a thick wall was uncovered, probably belonging to the sanctuary's per?bolos wall. N of the anc. agora, baths (warm rooms and two pools) were investigated. In the N wing of the agora, a room covered by a thick destruction layer contained a series of remarkable finds, including more than 100 coins belonging to the 1st half of the 3th Ct AD, a treasure of fourteen coins in a vessel, belonging to the era of Caracalla to Phillip the Arab, bronze oinochoae, a bronze scale, bronze keys, a bronze implement of a cart, bronze decorative discs, glass vessels, bone plaques, iron tools and fragments of everyday vessels, all implying urban life of a high standard. In To Vima (17/02/2006) D. Pandermalis discusses the anc. wall of the city (2.60m /. and 2.5-3m h.), built in ca 400 BC and used until Byz times. Many architectural members and pieces of sculpture have been found built into the wall, such as an inscription referring to the royal house of Rome and its patron gods and a relief depicting the rider Kandylis and the snake. A bust of Hephaistos and a marble head of Dionysus have also been found here. 147. Revenia: Neo decorated phiale Leibithra. G Giannakis (AEMTH 18 [2004], 389-96) discusses structural works on the slopes of the anc. acropolis, to avert the threat posed by three streams. Two refuse pits were uncovered, as reported by E. Poulaki-Pandermali and A. Mbahla (AEMTH 18 [2004], 384-88) containing pottery, animal bones, shells and small finds. Pottery dates to the Ar period (6th Ct BC), showing a great variety of local and imported (Cor, Attic, Chian) wares. Leptokarya, Valtos. E. Poulaki-Pandermali, S. Koulidou and E. Papadopoulou (AEMTH 18 [2004], 397-406) report on the excavation of the PH settlement. Three phases were identified. The 1st, dating to the end of the MBA, is character ized by an extensive destruction layer, two pits (one is filled with pottery, animal bones and shells, and the other is accessible via curved steps), a fragmentary clay floor and part of a cobbled yard. To the 2nd phase, dating to the beginning of the LBA, belong parts of three parallel monumental enclosure walls. The 3rd phase is characterized by remains of improvised habitation (post-holes, pits and cobble areas). The pottery of the site is mainly handmade (pithoid vessels and S-profiled kanthroi and phialae), while wheelmade pottery is sporadic. Other finds include stone and bone tools, loomweights and spindle-whorls. S.M.

Klanga (AEMTH 18 [2004], 105-14) report on the rescue excavation conducted in two plots within the limits of the anc. cemetery. In one plot 124 burials were investigated (burial pyrai, enchytrismoi, pit graves, cist graves, tile graves, clay built graves and mortuary constructions). Twenty five graves date to the 4th Ct AD, while the rest are of the LAr period, E 5th Ct BC. Of particular interest are the eight LAr burial pyrai, with the burial placed on the ground surface, fired, quenched with water,</page><page sequence="93">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 93 covered with soil and then marked with a stone or column. The deceased were accompanied by their personal possessions (rings, strigils); drinking vessels (LAr lekythia) were smashed during the burial ceremonies. The other LAr burials were accompanied mostly by clay vessels, figurines (in the shape of animals, female and male figures, sphinxes), glass vessels (alabasters and aryballoi), bronze and silver jewellery (bracelets, pendants, earrings, clasps), iron weaponry (spearheads) and bronze coins. In total 70 intact vessels were recovered, all deriving from the Attic Kerameikos workshops, representing LAttic bf pottery (e.g., the workshops of Aimon and Megaira painters). E rf pottery is represented by a lekythos assigned to the Bowdoin painter. In the other plot thirteen burials were investigated, dating to LGeo and EAr times. All were pit graves, accompanied by poor offerings, such as clay vessels and iron knives. Athytos (anc. Aphytis). V. Misailidou-Despotidou (AEMTH 18 [2004], 115-24) reports on rescue excavations in the anc. city (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 79). Parts of three houses at the junction of two roads were investigated. Each house consisted of many small and large rooms communicating with each other through small openings. All three had a hearth in the middle of one large rectangular room; two of them preserve stone thresholds, while in one a clay bath was preserved. The destruction fill inside the houses contained many objects (everyday vessels, black-painted pottery, pointed and simple amphorae, millstones, sealed loomweights, a clay mould in the shape of a rooster, coinage minted in Athytos and other Chalcidician cities, such as Skioni and Mende) that had fallen on the floor due to a sudden natural disaster (possibly an earthquake), which is dated to the end of the 4th Ct BC. Kallithea. E. Poulaki-Pandermali and M. Vaxevanopoulos (AEMTH 18 [2004], 125-32) report on the topographic survey conducted in the cave in the Sanctuary of Ammon Zeus. The cave has been interpreted as a sanctuary dedicated to Dionysus (according to a marble Dionysus head and an inscribed sherd), founded in the 2nd half of the 8th Ct BC. Anc. Mende. H. Anagnostopoulou-Chatzipolichroni (AEMTH 18 [2004], 133-40) reports on rescue excavations. Two buildings with interior stoas were investigated, along with a circular kiln, dated to the E 4th-E 2nd Ct BC. Extensive destruction layers covered the buildings, which, according to the finds (fragmented tiles, lamps, vessels, particularly amphorae, 'W slope' kantharoi, black-painted skyphoi, coinage), served as workshops for manufacturing pottery and other clay objects. Among the most characteristic finds are the numerous intact vessels bearing stamps with 'Parmeniskos group' names, along with stamped amphora handles. Other finds include a stone weight and two clay discs that may have served as bases for potters' wheels. Earlier finds included pits and graves dating to the 6th and 5th Cts BC. Among the notable finds are a clay bust of Athena, a sealstone depicting a sphinx and part of a bronze strigil depicting a centaur. Y. Garlan (AEMTH 18 [2004] 141-48) argues that these finds indicate an origin of 'Parmeniskos group' stamped amphorae from Mende (and not from Pella as has been previously argued). Nea Skioni. E.B. Tsigarida and D. Mantazi (AEMTH 18 [2004], 149-55) report on the excavation of part of the EBA cemetery, NE of the Ar cemetery (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 80). In total, thirteen burial periboloi were investigated, circular in shape with an average di. of 1.50-2.50m. Twelve urns were found, mainly phialae and amphorae with tubular or trumpet handles, placed upside down or sealed with a 2nd small phiale. Five enchytrismoi were also investigated, with the burial pithoi placed horizontally on the ground or in a shallow pit. The pithoi, which had cord decoration, were sealed either with a stone or with a 2nd vessel and then covered with piles of stones. The burial offerings were poor (a bronze jewel, a loomweight and a small cup). Finally, at the SE end of the cemetery the stone foundations of a building were revealed (2m by 2.5m). The interior was covered with mud-bricks, probably collapsed parts of the roof, underneath which part of the floor and finds (mainly vessels) were found. The cemetery and the building date from the EEBA to the LMBA. Ierissos (anc. Akanthos). E. Trakosopoulou-Salakidou (AEMTH 18 [2004], 157-66) discusses aspects of the long standing research in the anc. cemetery, where so far 11,098 burials have been recorded, dating from the Ar to Rom period (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 80; AR 49 [2002-2003], 65; AR 48 [2001-2002], 74). She also reports on the rescue excavation conducted in a plot within the limits of the anc. settlement. Bellow the surface layer a thick extensive layer, rich in fragmented vessels (mostly amphorae), slags, pebbles, tiles and seashells, was revealed. Below this layer remains of buildings were investigated, developed in three phases. The remains belonging to the 1st phase include two rooms containing mainly everyday vessels, loomweights and coinage, dated to the 4th Ct BC. The 2nd phase is characterized by the remains of two rooms, with similar finds. To the 3rd and oldest phase belongs part of a partially open-air space with a stone-built well. The site appears to have been a workshop with a dump area. This hypothesis was confirmed when a long orderly line of pointed amphorae (13.5m by 1.65m) was revealed 15m from the buildings. She also (AEMTH 18 [2004], 167-79) discusses the inves tigation of five pottery kilns and a building belonging to a workshop, found SE of the anc. cemetery. Three of the kilns, circular in shape, are very well preserved (Fig. 148), while an inscribed amphora with the letters A/K/A/N, attributed to local workshops, was found next to one of them. The building remains include a long stoa, ancillary rooms and eight dump pits. The site dates to the E-L 4th Ct BC, according to coinage. Worth mentioning is a hoard of thirteen coins, including silver and bronze ones from Akanthus and Chalkidike coins. 148. Ierissos: Rom pottery kiln</page><page sequence="94">94 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. Y. Garlan (AEMTH 18 [2004], 181-90) reports on the study of the amphorae sealings known as the 'wheel group', comprising of ca 1,500 samples. These amphorae, dating to the L 4th-E 3r Ct BC, show a wide distribution in N Greece and the Black Sea area, and originate from the workshops of Akanthos. The letters of the sealings are interpreted as indications of the capacity of the amphorae. Tripiti (anc. Sani). E.B. Tsigarida and S.

The remains of three buildings, probably two-room private houses, and a path were investigated (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 80). Their destruction layer contained everyday vessels, loomweights and coins, while storage vessels, a mortar, a clay tub and the base of a marble perirantirio were found in situ. They date from L 5th to M 4th Ct BC. To the E of this site, part of a 4th Ct AD farmstead was investigated, while in a previous rescue excavation on the hill of Tripiti part of the Hel fortification was revealed. Torone.

Excavations Conducted by the Australian Archaeological Institute at Athens in Collaboration with the Athens Archaeological Society. (Monumenta Archaeologica 24), Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, Los Angeles, (2005). The Persian War Shipwreck Survey. S. Wachsmann (Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A&amp;M University) reports on the 2005 Persian War Shipwreck Survey, a collabo rative project of the Canadian Archaeological Institute at Athens (CAIA), the Gr Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities (EEA) and the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR). The project's aim is to examine the seabed in regions where Herodotus and other authors describe the loss of large numbers of ships during the conflict due to storms or battle. 'While the 1st two seasons of survey focused primarily on the region of mount Athos, in search of remains of Darius' fleet, the 2005 season was devoted to examining the area of Artemision and the 'hollows of Euboea', where, according to Herodotus (VII, VIII), major fleets were lost to naval warfare and to storms in 480 BC. The prolonged fighting raises the distinct possibility that parts of the galleys, particularly their bronze rams, may have gone to the bottom. In 2005 we examined select areas of the hollows of Evia and select areas in the NE part of the Artemision channel in the region of Aphetai. The survey examined some 30km2 of seabed with sidescan sonar supplemented with acoustic profiling. At the hollows, the team collected sidescan sonar targets and acoustic profile data around Cavo Doro (cape Kafireas) to the area of cape Letra. This is an area famous for shipwrecks and also known in mod. times for maelstroms resulting from N storms that reflect off this coast's N-facing cliffs; an ideal shipwreck-generating situation. The team surveyed the near shore area using the Thetis and Super Achilles ROV. The seabed away from the shore to a depth of about 600m was examined with sidescan sonar and a sub-bottom profiler. Anomalies were examined with the Thetis and larger Max Rover ROV. No shipwrecks of any date were located with these tools. The lack of viable remains appears to be the result of sedimentation in these regions, which would have obliterated any anc. remains. Near shore surveys also revealed a cluster of anchors of varying date in a limited area near Cavo Doro. Although their archaeological context is uncertain the presence of the anchors underscores the importance of this sealane to pre-mod. shipping. The only shipwrecked cargo found, by coincidence, during the survey of the hollows was at one of the pocket beaches where a cargo of monumental marble blocks was scattered over an area of more than 400m2 in shallow water. Although the age of the marble cargo is uncertain, underwater discoveries elsewhere in the Mediterranean show that the transport of bulk building materials was common in the Rom era and the shapes of the blocks match with profiles of blocks in Rom period marble quarries. EASTERN MACEDONIA Nomos of Serres (28th EPCA; 12th EBA) Therma. E. Kambouroglou and K. Peristeri (AEMTH 18 [2004], 17-24) report on a survey conducted in the area of Nigrita to detect PH flint quarries and flint processing sites. Five quarrying sites were located, where raw materials were also processed for tool manufacture. Samples from these sites were analyzed (using XRD) and compared with samples of flint tools from the PH sites Dikili Tash and Arkadikos Dramas. The preliminary results suggest that the raw materials of the tools derived from the above quarrying sites. Neos Skopos, Serres. Z. Bonias, Kathimerini (17/11/2005), reports on a rescue excavation that revealed part of the anc. city of Berge and its cemetery, which were in use from Ar to Rom times (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 81). The grave goods include gold wreaths, clay vessels, coinage and jewellery. Anc. Berge was a Thasian colony, founded in the 6th Ct BC, with democratic organization and vivid commercial activity. Its importance decreased after the establishment of the Athenian colony of Amphipolis, but remained vigorous in Hel and Rom times, as attested by the finds from the cemetery. Alistrati, Serres. Ch. Kontaxi, V. Giannopoulos and A. Kaznessi (AEMTH 18 [2004], 57-62) report on an excavation conducted in 'Orpheas' cave. In the central area of the cave successive floors, including semi-circular hearths, were explored. Monochrome smoothed and burnished pottery was abundant, with fine black-burnished and coarse ware dated to LNeo II, while incised (filled with white incrustation) and rippled pottery date to EBA I?II. Other finds include bones of domesticated animals and small mammals, shells, bone tools, spindle-whorls and a few flint artefacts. Among the most important finds are two fragmented human skulls. In the S chamber of the cave an extensive floor (16m2) with intensive traces of fire and twelve post-holes was investigated. Its function is still uncertain. Sidirokastro, Katarraktes. E. Poulaki-Pandermali, M. Vaxevanopoulos, S. Koulidou and A. Siros (AEMTH 18 [2004], 63-71) report on the excavation of a rock shelter. Floors with post-holes, carbonized wood, vessels in situ and clay constructions were found, dated by C14 to 3340-3020 BC. Pottery is mostly smoothed; coarse ware is rare. A small number of vessels is burnished and sometimes decorated with grooved or channeled patterns. Apart from cooking pots, storage vessels, closed vessels and tableware, strainers were also recognized. Other finds include spindle-whorls, stone and bone tools and beads. An earlier phase, represented by graphite pottery, and a later PH phase, with pottery decorated with impressed and incised decoration, occasionally filled with white incrustation, was detected in a trench dug by smugglers.</page><page sequence="95">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 95 Argilos. Z. Bonias, Kathimerini (12/02/2005), summarizes the finds of the ten-year investigations in the anc. city, one of the colonies of Andros in N Aegean, founded in the M 7th Ct BC (see also AR 48 [2001-2002], 83; AR 49 [2002-2003], 68; AR 51 [2001-2002], 82). The post-framed houses and the remains of so-called Thracomacedonian pottery attest the co-existence of Andrian colonists with the local Thracian population. The city flourished in the 6th and 5th Cts BC, due to its geographic position and the rich raw material sources in the area. Its importance decreased when the Attic colony of Amphipolis was founded in 437 BC. Philip II destroyed it in 357 BC after which only the citadel remained in use. Excavations brought to light a fortified complex of private and public buildings developed along a paved road leading from the harbor to the citadel. The architecture (house walls are preserved up to 4m h.) and town planning indicate island traditions. A monumental house predominates in the citadel (dimensions 14m by 4m), probably the house of the Macedonian Hetairos, which had olive press installations in the basement (see also AR 50 [2003 2004], 56). A marble stele with the inscription AI02 KATAIBATOT was recovered, probably placed in the house after its destruction, in order to appease Zeus. Part of the city's cemetery has also been investigated, along with two Macedonian tombs. Of the most important finds are coins, which verify that the city minted its own coinage from the E 5th Ct BC.

Peristeri (AEMTH 18 [2004], 24-32) reports on the rescue excavation in the LNeo settlement. Two phases are distinguished. In the area around the post-framed apsidal house (sqqAR 50 [2003-2004], 57), remains of at least four dwellings (one of them apsidal), constructed in pis? technique, are revealed. The dwellings are relatively large (6m by 8m), closely spaced with W-E orientation. The best preserved house has two rooms, the larger one containing a hearth and oven. The four houses date to the earliest LNeo phase of the settlement. To the later LNeo phase belongs a dwelling with a floor of compacted soil and post-holes for the walls or other interior constructions, along with a cobbled yard and two shallow pits in an outdoor area. Storage and cooking vessels were abundant, along with painted 'brown on cream', 'black on red', graphite, black-topped and incised pottery. Other finds include a marble vessel, miniature vessels, figurines, stone and bone tools. Nomos of Kavala (18th EPCA; 12th EBA) Plilippoi. M. Nikolaidou-Patera and D. Mefidis (AEMTH 18 [2004], 33-42) report on the excavations conducted in the area W of the city of Philippoi. In site 1, 200m W of the city walls, a long circuit wall (ca 25m /. and 0.50m w.) was revealed. Next to it a circular kiln was investigated. The fact that the fuel burning and the firing space were integrated lead to the assumption that it was used for firing bricks and not pottery. P ottery (mainly red-glaze) dates the site from the 1st Ct BC to LRom times. A silver denarius of Commodus, found in the foundation level of the architectural remains, provides a more accurate date. A study of ca 70 inscriptions, undertaken by C?dric Br?laz (EFA) and Angelos Zannis (Universities of Thessalonica and Lausanne), is to be published in the 1st volume of the corpus of Gr and Latin inscriptions from Phillipoi. This volume will include the inscriptions of the Rom colony of Philippi concerning the municipal and imperial political institutions (amounting to a total of 250 inscriptions, about half of which are unpublished). Most of the studied inscriptions refer to the magistrates of the colony. The following has been published: S. Provost, M.

Nikolaidou, Eleftherotypia and Kathimerini (09/02/2006), reports on the excavation on top of the hill of the mod. village. Part of the anc. wall and three towers that protected its N and S gate were uncovered. Finds, such as fragments of Thasian pointed amphorae and coins of Kassander, date the construction of the wall to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC. The wall was reconstructed in Rom times, while the site has been identified as anc. Akontisma, mentioned as a station on the Via Egnatia. On a hill W of the mod. village rescue excavation revealed part of a fortified settlement, dated from the 6th to the M 4th Ct BC. It was probably one of the commercial stations that Thasians founded opposite their island in order to manipulate raw material sources of the hinterland. The hypothesis is supported by pottery finds, which derived mainly from Thasian workshops. Thasos Francine Blonde, Arthur M?ller and Marina Sgourou (EFA) report on the study season of the finds from the N surround ings of the Artemision: 'The study of the portable finds from this area continued. The two garbage dumps (ESP 18 and ESP 14) which provided most of the finds, are confirmed to have been different in nature. The study of destruction layer ESP 13 shows that its basis is constituted of a mixture of materials coming either from the coating of the walls (clay plus a fine layer of painted plaster) or from a pebble opus signinum floor. The construction date of DOM5, hitherto placed in the E 5th Ct AD (on the basis of 1970s coin finds) must, on the basis of new coin material, be revised to the L 5th Ct or later. Regarding the date of the destruction, nothing was found to contradict the terminus of 619, established by previous works in DOM5 and on the site of Thasos. Apart from Byz and Ot re-use of materials (period 2), there is no indication of any occupation on the site of DOM5 after its destruction until the planning of agricultural terraces at the end of the 19th Ct (period 1).'

Yves Grandjean and Bernard Holtzmann in collaboration with Manuela Wurch-Kozelj report on a brief investigation in O. Pavlou Mela undertaken in a non built-up area, where the top of the city wall was still visible. 'The goal was to define the state of the city wall at this point and to clarify its chronology. The presence of water did not allow us to reach archaeological layers. On the side of the anc. city, it has been possible to clear the internal facing of the defensive wall to a h. of 1.3m. The wall is constructed from regular courses of marble blocks of small dimensions. On the seaward side, the external facing was recognized to a h. of 1.8m. Under its preserved crest, constituted of a row of low marble slabs acting as headers, we unearthed three courses of great marble blocks with bossed faces; a 4th foundation course has also been found. Clearing the external facing, we collected several architectural blocks from the rampart or from neigh bouring buildings. We had to stop at the water level, without having reached the bottom of the structure. It is obvious that this sector acted as quarry in mod. times.' THRACE Nomos of Rhodopi (19th EPCA; 15th EBA) Krovili, Mesti, Lafrouda, Rhodope plain. A. Ammerman, N. Efstratiou, M. Dinou and S. Michalakas (AEMTH'18 [2004], 2 8) and Kathimerini (06/05/05) report on the project of recording the stratigraphie sequence of three Neo mounds by taking cores down through to the natural soil at their base, with the purpose of studying the layers of their original establish ment. The site of Krovili appears to provide the earliest evidence of human presence in the area, dated to 6000 BC according to C14 dates. A sequence of habitation layers, including floors of compact soil, remains of mud-brick houses, pottery, charred seeds, shells and animal bones point to a small scale settlement engaged in farming and stockbreeding. The site of Mesti yielded thin but extensive archaeological deposits, suggesting a different type of settlement. The site of Lafrouda in its main phase, in 5000 BC, was located very close to the sea (the base of the tell is now 3m as?), while data indicate consid erable consumption of shells (shell midden). Komotini. To Vima and Kathimerini (07/02/2006) refer to 23 marble slabs appropriated by smugglers, belonging to Rom sarcophagi or other funeral monuments. Five slabs bear reliefs of naked male figures, three of which wear lion's hides and probably depict Herakles. The fragments date to the 2nd Ct AD and are more likely to have been transferred to their find locations than to have belonged to a single monument. They provide the 1st evidence of Rom presence in a city believed to have been founded in Byz times. Nomos of Evros (19th EPCA; 15th EBA) Via Egnatia, Zonaia mountain range. P.

NORTHEAST AEGEAN ISLANDS (20th EPCA; 3rd EBA) Lemnos Hephaisteia. E. Greco (Italian Archaeological School) reports on the 2005 excavation season in Hephaestia: 'Following the excavation of trenches 1st dug in 2003 and 2004, which proved the existence of a complex stratigraphy behind the surrounding walls, the July-August 2005 mission of the Italian School extended the excavation toward the E and W. Research on the E part in contact with the walls and with the Rom house investigated in 1930 enabled the exploration of a building complex, which had been treated only superficially previously. The complex consists of at least two large adjoining rooms, each with different orientation, where glass and perhaps also iron were processed. The excavation did not reach beyond levels preceding the L Imperial and EByz era; the abandonment date has, however, been confirmed sometime in the 7th Ct AD. To the W, the absence of more recent layers allowed for the exploration of another part of the great Ar wall discovered in 2004. More importantly, the excavation of an enormous deposit consisting perhaps of the dismantled material from the Ar wall was conducted, during which we recovered a large quantity of grey Anatolian pottery. Under the debris it has been possible to explore the crests of the walls of a settlement which was abandoned in LH IIIB, and to recover Myc pottery of excellent quality. Outside the wall we proceeded to clean and draw the so called torrioncino (small tower) and excavated the area in front of it, to the S, where we unearthed another funerary terrace.' E. Papi (University of Siena) in collaboration with the Italian Archaeological School reports on the survey of Hephaisteia and excavation of a house from L Antiquity:</page><page sequence="97">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 97 'A detailed GPS-based survey programme is underway within the 24ha of the city area. The geophysical survey with a gradiometer and the digital processing of the survey concen trated on the W districts. Since 2003 around 5ha, with 191,600 measurements, have been covered, and we have been able to identify fortifications, buildings and evidence of craft activities inside the regular urban structure, which probably dates to the Ar or Cl period and was maintained for almost 1,000 years. The excavation of the block of houses above the Hel baths continued to reveal streets and built structures: the most anc. structure is a wall in opus quadratum, probably built in the Cl period, whereas the Hel period is represented by walls constructed of small blocks, and by the construction of a road paved with limestone slabs above a central drain. The best documented phase can be dated to the 4th Ct AD, when the block of houses was completely reconstructed with building material in secondary use in order to create a peristyle house with workshop annexe, which was abandoned after two centuries.' Lesbos Messon. To Vima (11/08/2005) reports on the completion of the enhancement project of an important Ionic temple dating to the 4th Ct BC, possibly a cult area of Aphrodite. The temple had incorporated the older Ar cult building, while in the ECh era it was converted into a workshop with kilns, and then into a church. The temple is mentioned in the works of Alkaios and Sappho. The enhancement project was conducted by a committee led by A. Archontidou and L. Acheilara, and involved the draining of rain water, the clearing of wild plant growth in the area, removal of earth surrounding the monument, conservation of stone architectural elements and construction of facilities for visitors to the site. Chios Oinousses. The following has been published: K.N IrKainra?iac, O Nao? tojv Ayi v Attoot?Xojv oto Tivpyi Xtov, TAPA, Athens (2005). Eleftherotypia (06/02/2006), To Vima (05/08/2005), Kathimerini (05/08/2005) and Ta Nea (27/10/2005) report on underwater investigations of a LCI shipwreck discovered in 2004 in the area between Chios and Oinousses (AR 51 [2004 2005], 90). The project is a collaboration between an American scientific team (D. Mindell, MIT, B. Foley and H. Singh, Woods Hole Oc?anographie Institution), the EMA (K. Dellaporta) and the Greek Centre of Maritime Investigations (D. Sakellariou). The project resulted in a stereoscopic recon struction of the shipwreck, which was found at a d. of 67m, was /. 20-25m and carried ca 400 amphorae with wine from Chios and Samos. A Rom shipwreck, found in the area to the W of Chios, was investigated with the same methods. Kato Phana. L. Beaumont reports on the fieldwork carried out in summer 2005 at Kato Phana: 'Excavations continued at Kato Phana, anc. Phanai. The work, conducted as part of an on-going collaborative fieldwork project between the 20th EPCA and the BSA, was carried out under the direction of A. Archontidou-Argyri and L. Beaumont, and also under the auspices of the 3r EBA headed by A. Kavvadia. Excavation focused on the SW area of the Sanctuary of Apollo Phanaios, continuing work conducted in 1999, 2000 and 2001. Trench VII (Fig. 149) uncovered the S wall of the narthex of the ECh basilica, built of large grey limestone ashlar blocks and preserved to a maximum of three built courses, each course measuring approximately 0.5m h. The base of this wall was reached at 8.09m asl. Underlying this wall, and projecting from it by 0.55m, was discovered another wall (wall 16), constructed of mortared field stones and measuring 1 m h. The nature of wall 16 is not yet clear. Though it may constitute the foundations of the basilica, its massive nature is remarkable, and might indicate that it originally formed part of a structure predating the basilica, only subsequently incorporated into the foundations of the basilica church. To S and SW of the narthex of the basilica, trenches I, V, VII, VIII, X and XII (in addition to trench II dug in 1999 and 2000) brought to light further remains of a multi-roomed rubble and mortar building, in use between the 5th and 7th Cts AD. This building, oriented N-S on exactly the same alignment as the basilica, measures approximately 13m on its W fa?ade and 12.5m on the N. Although it was not possible to excavate the structure completely, it is clear that it incorporated a minimum of four rooms. Found within this building in 2005 was much clay tile, coarse and fine ware ceramics, a small bronze coin, fragments of glass vessels, and two fragments of stone statuary in the form of an eagle's head and a cloven hoof. Between this building and the foundation of the basilica, which are separated by a distance of only 1.6m, was recovered a considerable quantity of flat window glass and roof tile. Two built features were found running underneath, and predating, the ECh structures in trench VII. The 1st of these, located at 6.93m asl, comprises an area of large and carefully laid limestone paving, which possess a vertical d. of up to 0.26m. The 2nd feature preserves part of an as yet unidentified curved stone construction two courses deep, reaching to a maximum h. of 7.24m asl. Even before the pottery associated with these finds is examined, it seems likely that these features belong to the LAr/Cl occupation of the sanctuary. To this 149. Kato Phana: S wall of the narthex of the ECh basilica</page><page sequence="98">98 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. phase also belongs the discovery in trench VIII of a carefully worked finger in white marble from a life-sized anthropomor phic statue, together with black-glaze pottery and glazed roof tile. It is likely that the find of a headless terracotta bull or horse figurine in trench VII is also similarly dated. Further evidence also came to light in trenches I, V, VII, VIII and X of the use of the cult site in the LGeo and SubGeo periods. Remains included coarse and fine ware ceramics and bronze votives, such as a decorated pin and a fragmentary belt. In addition, trench X produced a newly exposed section of wall adjoining the 7th Ct BC staircase excavated in 2001. The excavations this year also produced additional evidence for LBA occupation of the site, with the discovery of more LH III pottery (trench VII) and a number of terracotta horns from bovine figurines (trenches I, VII, VIII).' CYCLADES AND SAMOS Nomos of the Cyclades (21st EPCA; 2nd EBA) Andros Plaka. To Vima (15/09/2005), Ta Nea (15/09/2005) and Kathimerini (15/09/2005) report on excavations conducted by Ch. Televantou. Parts of four buildings were uncovered, one of which is preserved to the 1st floor level, and a street leading to a small square. They are dated to the E MBA, but evidence suggests that the settlement suffered from successive destruc tions from the end of the EBA until the MBA. Apart from small finds, pottery and stone tools, a rock engraving with a composition of a human head surrounded by various symbols, ships and a circular motif, which might represent the sun, is an unusual discovery. A cult significance is attributed to the composition, which is similar to those found at the LNeo site of Strofilas on the same island. According to the excavator, this may suggest continuity of habitation on the island, with people moving from Strofilas to Plaka after the destruction of the LNeo site.

Kythnos To Vima (03/12/2005) reports on further finds from the Ar temple excavated by A. Mazarakis-Ainian. A vase fragment inscribed with the letters AP suggests that Artemis was the goddess worshipped in the twin temple, possible together with Apollo. Gold, silver, bronze, glass, rock-crystal, ivory and faience objects, figurines, and bf and rf vases dating from the Ar to Hel period were found in an apothetis outside the temple, possibly deposited by the priests after a clearance operation in the temple. Remains of a sacrifice, probably related to the time of the deposition, were uncovered. The adyton of the temple was found intact with its contents in situ (ca 2,000 votive offerings), sealed after the earthquake which destroyed the temple. The objects found in the temple and their provenances support the impression of Kythnos as a city involved in Aegean and Mediterranean trade from the 10th Ct BC onwards.. Part of the anc. harbour of Kythnos, at Vryokastraki in Mandraki bay, was uncovered during a collaborative expedition (A. Mazarakis-Ainian, University of Thessaly, and D. Kourkoumelis, EMA). Architectural remains associated with the harbour facilities were uncovered in the sea, but also 50m inshore. To Vima (23/03/2005) reports on further investigations of the shipwreck, Kythnos I, located last year at a d. of 485m, from which a male bronze statue of the LCI period was retrieved by fishermen. Amphorae, vases and cooking pots were retrieved during this year's investigations. The research operation is conducted by EMA (K. Dellaporta, D. Kourkoumelis and P. Micha) and the Greek Centre of Maritime Investigations (D. Sakellariou). The project, which aims to map shipwrecks in the area between Kythnos and Serifos, also located a 19th Ct shipwreck, as well as four of unknown dates. Delos Aphrodision of Stesileos. C. Durvye and F.-F. M?ller report on the 2005 excavation season and architectural survey (Fig. 150): Fouille 2005 IX-capagc 2005 150. Delos: Aphrodision of Stesileos, areas investigated in 2005 'The 2005 excavation campaign was conducted in the E section of the sanctuary and consisted of three operations: a trench in oikos 5; the excavation of oikos 4; and a cleaning operation in the passage between oikoi 2 and 5 and structure 6. The goals of the campaign were to date the construction and use of oikoi 4 and 5 and to determine, if possible, their function, as well as understand the circulation system between the oikoi and the passage from the E part of the sanctuary to the temple court. Fr. Salviat's report on his work of 1957 (BCH 82 [1958], 821 ) referred to the absence of any indications that the space was occupied before the 3rd Ct BC. A trench opened in the SW corner of oikos 5 allowed us to verify this conclusion with regard to oikos 5. The excavation revealed a series of three successive floors of beaten earth separated by fine re-fill deposits. The material found on the floors and in the re-fill deposits was abundant and comprised exclusively kitchen ware (cooking pots, plates, bowls with relief decoration,</page><page sequence="99">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 99 amphorae and clay hearths), dated after 150 BC (Fig. 151). Under these floors the foundations were constructed of quarry stones and sand compensating for the irregularities of the rocky substratum; ceramic material even later than 150 BC was found in the rocky substratum. The date and function (as a kitchen or banqueting space) of the oikos seem, therefore, to be fully established. The cleaning of the passage in front of the entrance to oikos 5 revealed an extension of the oikos. In a phase subsequent to the construction of the W wall of the oikos, the S extremity of this wall was disassembled in order to create an opening from the room into a rectangular space delimited to the S by the street wall and to the W by the wall of building 6; this space was closed by a wall which leaned against the walls of construction 6 and oikos 5. In this reduced space two successive floors were unearthed. On the earliest floor finds included several stacked plates, an intact lamp and a small burned amphora. The room could have been used as a storage area for kitchen ware and food. The remaining ceramic material discovered in the reduced space corresponds to that found on the floors of oikos 5, i.e. kitchen ware later than 150 BC. Although the walls of oikos 4 were discovered in 1957, the interior of the room had been obscured by excavation spoils of earth and stones until 2005. Under the rubble, identified as coming from the disassembly of sections of a Rom aqueduct, which is still partially in situ in the S part of the oikos, a very thick anc. deposit was discovered, rich in mortar and marble fragments, with a strong N-ward inclination. This deposit rested on a 2nd, very different, layer of packed sherds. A roughly circular pit dug into this 2nd layer contained the right little finger of a marble statue with a circular mortise on the part where it was cut off. By removing the sherd deposit in the N part of the building we were able to reveal a N-S wall parallel to the E wall of the room and levelled to its foundations; this wall abuts on the N wall of the room without any apparent connection to it. On both sides of the N-S wall two destruction layers of different consistencies were discovered; these layers contained material predating that of oikos 5. The excavation results suggest several phases in the planning of this part of the sanctuary, some of which may have chronologically preceded the 2nd Athenian domination. The character of the constructions (thick and dense deposits in several layers, foundations reaching deeper to the N than to the S) reveal the instability of the soil and the necessity to adapt to an irregular and possibly humid surface. Oikoi 2, 3, 4 and 5 open onto a space defined by the wall which separated the sanctuary from the E road; this space clearly dominates the central court (difference in elevation: 1.10m). Surface cleaning revealed the existence of irregular paving in front of the entrances to the oikoi and of associated drainage systems. Along the N wall of structure 6 there is a hydraulic installation made of flat tiles irregularly covered with lime plaster. The three drainage systems (a pipe with an opening for fresh air in front of oikos 3, the subterranean pipe in front of oikos 4 and the tile installation in front of oikos 5) were covered in a later phase by a fill (rich in L Hel plain ware). Thus, the space in front of oikoi 3, 4 and 5 was levelled to the height of the paving in front of oikos 5. At the same level with the paved areas, a floor of beaten earth was revealed. This descends to the W at a slight inclination, forming a ramp in front of oikoi 2 and 3, connecting the E part of the sanctuary with the temple court. On this floor we discovered a remarkable quantity of beads of various shapes and glass fragments. 151. D?los: Aphrodision of Stesileos, incense burner and pot As part of the architectural survey, F.-F. M?ller and G. Hubert compiled an inventory of the easily recognizable polygonal erratic blocks belonging to the Temple of Aphrodite, some of which had been re-used in oikos 1 and structure 6. Several architecturally significant blocks were identified, and the elevation plan of the external facing of the temple fa?ade was completed.' Atlas of Delos. L. Fadin, M. Fincker and V Picard, under the direction of J.-Ch. Moretti continued the compilation of the Atlas of Delos. This project, a collaboration between the EFA and IRAA of the CNRS, aims to produce a detailed map of all anc. remains on Delos at 1:200 scale, using GPS, total station measurements and other techniques. The Inopos dam. M. Fincker and J.-Ch. Moretti (IRAA of the CNRS) report on the Inopos dam: 'The source of Inopos, the main river of Delos, is located to the SW of the Cynthium. Its natural course successively follows two directions. Its 1st flows to the N, at the feet of the W flank of the Cynthium, then it turns to the W, along the theatre hill, finally reaching the area of the agora of the Competaliasts. The river was subject to a number of interven tions, the most important located upstream of where its original direction changes. The construction, described as the 'lower reservoir of the Inopos' (GD 97) in the Guide de D?los by Ph. Bruneau and J. Ducat, includes a dam and a basin. In 2005, the dam was cleaned, surveyed and studied. The wall had two phases, the earlier dated to the 5th Ct BC, the 2nd to the end of the 4th Ct BC. In its 1st phase, the structure was a poros wall of w. 1.35m; lead was used to waterproof its upstream face.' Sanctuary of Apollo. R. Etienne, with J.-P. Braun (architect), St. Dervin, M. Gleyse, Fr. Herbin, I. Warin, M. Louka and E. Nantet, reports on work in the Sanctuary of Apollo (Fig. 152): 'Work on the verification, completion and interpretation of the so-called Maar plan of Delos (1903), the only plan which shows the state of the remains as well as the buildings at soil level (AR 52 [2004-2005], 91-92) was completed.

Etienne prepared the publication of the Altar of Zeus Polieus (GD 23 E), the Altar of Athena and the Altar of Apollon Pai?n (GD 23 C), and of the Hel altar (GD 23 D) and of the hypethral sekos (GD 23 F), three of which had already been the subject of a reconstruction drawings (Fig. 153):</page><page sequence="101">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 101 'The Altar of Zeus Polieus (GD 23 E) can be reconstructed from nineteen blocks found near the Hel altar GD 25 and in the N W of the rectangular agora. It is an altar in antis of the same type as GD 23 B, dating to the end of the 6m or the beginning of the 5tn Ct BC. The blocks accord well with foundation 23 E, situated to the S of the Prytaneion (GD 11), which marks the S limit of the public space at the end of the 6th Ct BC. The identification of the Altar of Athena and Apollon Pai?n (Fig. 154) (GD 23 C) was made possible due to an inscription carved on the front face of the prothysis (ID 47). This altar had a frieze of triglyphs and metopes, a small section of which was reconstructed. The frieze is set on a course of four slabs. The moulded blocks, which must have sat between the frieze and the partially preserved pediment are missing. This altar, named the Mow triglyphs altar' and dated to the end of the 5th Ct BC (on architectural and epigraphic grounds) belongs to a mainland type which is quite exceptional on Delos and the Cycladic islands. The associated inscription ID 47b, essentially composed of three names (of which we have only the demotics), is likely to be a list of Athenian members of the Amphyctiony who dedicated the monument. The inscriptions, as well as the type of monument, certify that it is an Athenian offering, contempo rary with the construction of the Temple of the Athenians and the famous theoria of Nicias on the island in 417 BC. Of the Hel altar (GD 23 D) there remains the 1st step, four crowning blocks and a complete pediment of one of the short sides; since the h. eludes us, restoration of this anonymous altar is not possible. It is the most recent in the series (L 4th or E 3rd Ct BC, according to the clamps).

Plan of the Sanctuary of Apollo in the Ar period. The study of the Propylaea and the new dating of the Bouleuterion (GD 21) based on the pottery study by Fr. Villard (BCH [2003], forthcoming) will enable us to publish, in the near future, a historic plan of Ar Delos, which will differ considerably from G Gruben's chronological suggestions and graphic reconstruc tions. Further cleaning and excavation will clarify the course and chronology of the Sacred Way. We also plan a systematic survey of all blocks from votive bases or monuments around the sanctuary. J.-P. Braun is currently completing the survey and graphic reconstruction of six votive monuments (23 A-E); a virtual reconstruction of the monument GD 11, bouleuterion; and a reconstruction of the access to the temple terrace.' Despotiko To Vima (05/07/2005), Ta Nea (05/07/2005) and Kathimerini (05/07/2005) report on new finds from the Ar Sanctuary of Apollo at Mandra (AR 51 [2004-2005], 96). Parts of three Kouroi and a new building complex with ten rooms were uncovered. Three Ar Kouroi fragments, one from the head down to the chest, the other two from the lower torso to the knees, were re-used in Cl times after the destruction of the Ar sanctuary as architectural elements (door jambs). The new building complex measures 30m by 20m and was enclosed with a 40m by 25m per?bolos. One of the rooms, with a preserved slab-paved floor, was apparently a public bath/lavatory, as suggested by the sewage system, a large pithos and a marble basin. Triglyphs and column drums were probably originally from the Temple of Apollo. New portable finds include five clay figurines of Samian type, five Cor aryballoi and a clay votive tablet with a female figure in daedalic style, similar to that of the large figurine found in 2000. 153.

This summer we excavated three more of these rooms and found a number of imported amphorae, including one from Rhodes with both handles stamped. Another Hel building, which stood outside the fortification circuit, had cut into and destroyed the N side of the old M house A.l. We excavated one room in this building, a large rectangular space with a doorway located off-centre on one of its long sides and a large built hearth against the opposite wall. It formed an andreion where people could recline on couches and dine. Broken terra sigillata bowls, imported from Syria, lay on its floor together with fragments of additional amphorae and a variety of animal remains. The most informative find in the room was a well preserved bronze coin with a ship's prow on the obverse and a crocodile on the reverse. It was marked with the letters CRAS and minted in 34-32 BC by P. Canidius Crassus who served as Mark Antony's general in the E. Neopalatial Mochlos. The project also made some intriguing LM I discoveries. We nearly completed the excavation of building C.7, the large agricultural and manu facturing centre where our continuing residue analysis programme headed by A. Koh has now found evidence for the production of olive oil as well as wine. We were able to define its N, E and S limits this summer and found that it was surrounded by streets on all four sides. The E street, however, had been closed with four or five walls that were erected to buttress the building's E fa?ade in response to damage caused by the final LM IA eruption of Thera. In the LM IB period a large kitchen and dining room were erected along its S fa?ade. The street that ran here was moved further S and is now located beneath a mod. church. The dining room was provided with a plaster floor, benches and a central column, and on its floor lay a bronze bead in the shape of a dragonfly, identical to the dragonflies that form the necklace of the M goddess on the famous fresco from Xeste 3 at Thera. We knew from previous years that extensive Prepalatial remains were located beneath the ceremonial building B.2 at Mochlos, so one of the main objectives of the project was to excavate beyond its LM IB floor levels. One of the places we excavated was along the S fa?ade of the building's W wing. The Myc settlers who re-occupied the site after the LM IB destruction had built over this area in the LM III period, and digging beneath the LM III level we encountered a huge amount of stone collapse from the LM IB destruction of the building. We spent many weeks removing a seemingly endless stone fill. It extended at least 3m below the LM III level and belonged to a two-storey wall that must have been built entirely of stone. Our efforts were rewarded, however, by the discovery of a th??tral area below this debris. The lower storey of the S fa?ade of building B.2 is still intact here. It sits on a low rise in the bedrock, and an altar is located at the base of the fa?ade. It consists of a long bench in the E and a small rectangular built structure in the W, which is paved on top and provided with a decorated vase that was set inside the altar. The lower part of the vase was buried in the altar, while the upper part rose above its surface. A small round depression was cut in the bedrock directly above. Three long, wide steps are located to the E of this area; they could be approached from the terrace that ran in front of the pillar crypts in the E wing of the building. A staircase descended on the W side of the area from the interior of the building's W wing where we found a set of six large bronze basins in 1993 and a bronze trident and tin ingot in 2004. The S side of the area was enclosed by a solid wall, still preserved to the h. of one storey. The area was enclosed on all four sides, but was open to the sky. It was designed to accommodate a gathering of people and a spectacle that was performed in front of the altar. Members of the community reached the area from the E and assembled on the low steps that served as seats on this side of the area. Residents of the ceremonial building, probably including priestesses, reached it from the interior of the building via the staircase on the W side of the area. The ceremony involved feasting, and a hearth was located in front of the seats on the E with the remains of a large cooking dish, a tripod cooking pot, several conical cups and animal bones including sheep/goat and pig. Three other finds added to the mystery of the area: a large stone bowl smashed into many pieces, which may once have sat in the bedrock depression above the altar; an amphibolite drill-guide, used in stone-vase making, which had been placed inside the altar's vase; and a small sealstone depicting a vase with a plant growing out of it beneath a cosmic star. Prepalatial Mochlos. We also uncovered a large part of the Prepalatial settlement beneath blocks B and C of the Neopalatial town. These remains included numerous individual rooms where people cooked and ate, and probably also slept, and several paved streets. We were not able to identify separate houses or to reconstruct a good picture of the overall settlement plan. Further excavation remains necessary. Nonetheless, we made at least three important discoveries. One is that there was a major destruction at the end of the EM IIB period when EM III pottery was beginning to appear. There is little evidence of MM I pottery or any kind of immediate re-occupation after this destruction. This is something we had already deduced from an examination of the Prepalatial cemetery, but it appears to be part of a larger EM IIB calamity that befell other sites in E Crete including Palaikastro and EM Myrtos. One goal in excavating the Prepalatial settlement was to find the manufacturing area where the treasures Seager found in the cemetery were actually produced. Most of the rooms we uncovered were simple living spaces, but we located a stone case workshop among them. Its floor was covered in unfinished or partly finished stone vases similar to those from the Prepalatial cemetery, as well as a large number of stone implements used to produce them. Finally, another goal was to discover evidence for social ranking in the Prepalatial settlement of the kind suggested by the cemetery remains. In particular we were looking for the house of the individuals who were buried</page><page sequence="104">104 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. 158. Azoria: bronze cheese grater with gold diadems in the monumental tombs on the W terrace of the cemetery. Near the end of the excavation season we found what may be a good candidate. It was located directly beneath the LM IB kitchen and dining room outside C.7 in the same area where we found the goddess' dragonfly and consists of a suite of interconnecting rooms, one of which is quite large, with some unique architectural structures. We hope to explore this structure further in the future.'

Betancourt (ASCSA) reports on cleaning, consol idating, photographing and preparing drawings at the site: 'Work concentrated in block AF, at the tip of the Pseira peninsula, excavated in 1994. The block consists of a succession of MM and LM buildings. The earliest architec ture is a single wall from MM I?II, and the latest architecture is a building constructed in LM I and used until LM III. Work included removal of vegetation, revision of old drawings of architectural plans and consolidation. The cleaning and consolidation of the architecture was performed under the supervision of Alekos Nikakis. The work is in preparation for the final publication of block AF, which is expected to be completed during 2006-2007. The work at Pseira will continue next season'. Demos Ierapetras Kavousi.

Mook (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Iowa State University, ASCSA) report on the 2005 excavation season: 'The primary target areas of excavation were the W slope of the S acropolis and the E slope of the N acropolis. The purpose of fieldwork was to finish excavating the rooms of the andreion complex on the upper W slope in order to elucidate the plan and function of the building; to explore the SW terraces where the buildings recovered in 2003-2004 have a distinctly public character and possible civic functions; and to investigate the transition from civic to domestic space on the site by examining areas peripheral to the civic centre, especially on the N acropolis and lower SW terraces. The results of excavation on the N acropolis indicate that the Ar (6th to E 5th Ct BC) settlement extends on to this peak and its surrounding slopes. The focus of work was on a single three-roomed Ar building which we call the N acropolis house. Although the architecture of the building's N-most rooms is not well preserved, we were able to reconstruct the outlines of the house from extant foundations and intact floor assemblages. The spacious hall and storeroom were directly connected, while the kitchen was accessible from the main hall through an open courtyard. The main hall contained cups, skyphoi, a Lakonian krater, an olpe, a flask, a hydria and four chytrai. Even though the assemblage is dominated by pouring and drinking vessels, there is also storage equipment: a small relief pithos, a jar and a transport amphora. The neighboring storeroom had an array of drinking and pouring vessels, as well as a lekane and chytrai, but the assemblage consisted largely of pithoi (at least five separate jars) and two transport amphorae. The kitchen of the house, incorporating the bedrock for high socles, was perhaps situated to be sheltered from N winds. It contained a rectangular hearth, work platform, and the full complement of food preparation equipment. The assemblage of the room was extraordinarily well preserved. Finds included lekanae, mortars, a small pithos, amphorae, bowls, chytrai, cups, kalathoi, a dish and a spouted jug. Other finds included a bronze cheese grater (Fig. 158), an iron hoe and a fragment of a painted terracotta votive plaque (fig. 159). The plaque is typical of the mouldmade examples found in Ar Cretan 159. Azoria: painted terracotta votive plaque</page><page sequence="105">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 105 sanctuaries. Other finds included an iron arrowhead, several loomweights and spindle-whorls. Emerging from the kitchen assemblage is a discernable tool kit for food production; there is a very close contextual association between small querns, handstones and worked pumice, the latter perhaps used for cleaning or dressing querns. On preliminary analysis of the botanical remains, olives, figs, grapes, almonds and pulses can be identified. An animal bone dump at the S edge of the kitchen included pig, sheep, goat and significant amounts of fish. The animal bone from the kitchen is extremely significant as it represents primary butchering, activities that are not attested in the faunal assemblages from the civic complexes on the S acropolis, where the condition of the material so far suggests dressed cuts of meat and dining debris. On the S acropolis, we expanded the excavated areas SW of the Ar civic buildings on the W slope, recovering the remains of a spacious four-roomed house. This building, called the SW house has not yet been completely excavated, so the discussion here remains tentative. It has an identifiable main hall with direct access to storage facilities in the N. On the S, there was a small kitchen with well-built benches around a central hearth. The main hall had an assemblage of drinking and serving vessels. The storerooms were characteristically crowded with pithoi, at least five separate jars, along with a bf lekythos and two large fenestrated krater stands. The storerooms in the SW house, not unlike other examples from the site, should have functioned as pantries for storing drinking and serving equipment. Fragments of cups, skyphoi, chytrai, jugs, hydriae, lekanae and mortars were found across the storage areas. Among other finds, the main hall contained an iron cutting tool and Cretan-style bronze pin, and in the kitchen, a bronze arrowhead. The phasing in the SW house is complex and on the evidence to date, direct access from the kitchen to the main hall in the SW corner is unlikely. Further excavation is required to locate the main entrance to the house, which was probably from a corridor, courtyard or street along the W side of the building. What can be said is that kitchen and storage areas are distinctly separate units, and, perhaps more importantly, they are not directly adjoining compartments of the house. Like the N acropolis house, the main hall separates areas of food processing and storage. As a mediating component, the hall must have served to organize storage and service functions within the household. Access to and public visibility of storage facilities was controlled by the space of the hall, whose activities must have ranged from both public and private dining to administra tion of the household's storage and consumption. Whatever the cultural or economic reasons for this connection, the use of the hall for daily dining, as well as more public and formal receptions, would have benefited from proximity to a pantry storing dining equipment as well as staples not requiring intensive processing (such as fruits, nuts, olives, cheese, wine and oil). Second, the hall as the physical and economic centre of the household, could well have been used to control, account for, and organize the use of produce and other commodities. Finally, as social space, the hall-storeroom proximity appears to have been planned to enhance the accessibility and perhaps even the visibility of the material and agricultural wealth of the household. Work in the andreion complex on the W slope of the S acropolis exposed the E configuration of the building's porch and vestibule, which were found to have had clay floors, sloping downward from E to W, and accessible through two adjoining doors, indicated by pivot stones on the N side of each doorway and separated by a central door post. The porch is bordered by a stone-lined drain that was fed from the cut bedrock ramp sloping downward from the adjoining paved room in which we found a 4th stone platform, adding another to the three recovered in 2004. Given the position of the bedrock ramp and drain in the vestibule, it is likely that the paved room was only partially roofed. The function of the stone platforms remains a mystery, but it is possible that they served as offering tables. Pyrgion mentions a 'third table on the right as one enters the andreia' dedicated to Zeus Xenios (Ath. 4.143); and the Spensithios Decree (SEG XXVII 631) is a contemporary reference to regular sacrifices within the andreion. Below the andreion complex on the W slope is the so-called monumental civic building with its adjoining service complex, a series of kitchens and storerooms extending along the terrace to the S. While several more rooms of the service complex were exposed in 2005, the focus of excavation was D500, the monumental civic building to which we have attributed prytaneion functions. We expanded the sounding dug in 2004, revealing the full E side of the structure (Fig. 160). The building is over 20m /. (N-S, internal dimensions) and at least 8m w. (E-W). Stepped seats were found to run continu ously along all three extant interior wall faces of the building. The upper step is about 55cm d., the lower 25cm. The h. of each step is a uniform 25cm, a standard tread for th??tral seating. Both steps employ single dressed blocks as well as levelling courses to achieve the even step h. Several show considerable signs of tread wear, especially on the outer edges of the stones. The E wall is preserved to a h. of ca 2m above the level of the top step. The W limits of the building have not yet been established, but the extant remains of the N and S walls and the presence of a monumental retaining wall exposed on the edge of the terrace below the building suggest an internal w. of about 10m. On the top step of the E side of the building we recovered two inscribed kernoi: one in the SE corner has ten cupules form an irregular oval (not unlike the one from the th??tral area at Phaistos). The 2nd kernos is centrally placed. It is more regular in shape, consisting of ten cupules in a neat circle about 31 cm in di. The cupules are spaced at regular intervals along the circumference of the circle, and each cupule is about 3 cm in di. A re-used schist kernos, surely of M date, was found face down on top of one of the E steps. The schist slab has ten regular cupules arranged in a circle, separated by a carved groove and enclosed by an outer circle. The presence of these typically M ritual objects in an Ar civic building is intriguing and lead us to suspect ritual use, perhaps linked to the BA past through El A contexts such as house A-B at Vronda or building H on the Kastro, both of which had adjacent courtyards with kernoi. 160. Azoria: interior of monumental civic building from N</page><page sequence="106">106 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. Among the other finds recovered in 2005 there was a hydria, a black-gloss skyphos and a number of fragmentary cups. Burned and unburned animal bones were recovered from across the excavated area, and while the botanical remains from the building have not been studied yet, remains of wheat and chick pea have been identified. Evidence of the collapsed ceiling debris, post supports and fragments of burned rafters suggest that the entire building was roofed. Post supports are preserved in the NE quarter of the building where a nicely dressed round base was recovered 1.3m from the lower step on the E, and 4.2m from the lower step on the S. In line with this base is a worked bedrock outcrop, and 2.3m to the W of it is another worked limestone base. The placement of these supports allows for an internal plan of four by four posts, sixteen columns in all, an E-W intercolumniation of 1.3m for the side aisles and 2.3m for the internal aisles. If the placement were symmetrical then we could reconstruct a central aisle of 2.3m, centering one of the kernoi on the E-W axis of the building. The building is not, however, regular in plan, and we have not finished excavating the NW quarter or the W edge, so the internal intercolumniation proposed here must remain tentative. Excavations at Azoria in 2005 have begun to clarify the political topography of the S acropolis in the 6th and 5th Cts BC, identifying two separate locales of public dining in civic buildings: the so-called andreion complex on the upper W slope and the monumental civic building and its associated service and industrial areas on the SW terrace. Both of these buildings have a prominent W aspect, looking out toward the main routes leading to the site from the valleys on the N foot slopes of the Kavousi mountains. It is interesting that their positions would have been visually obtrusive to one approaching the settlement from the W, but separate from the city's agora, suggesting a degree of exclusion or controlled access from the main route into the settlement. Even though they are very different in design and architectural elaboration, both buildings are parts of larger complexes with duplicated food storage and processing facilities indicating the mobilization and concentration of commodities for formal and large-scale consumption. Each was communal, but also to some degree exclusionary, perhaps ordering the status of households and clans, and modes of social interaction. The investment in public architecture is a material articulation of urban identity at the expense of the EIA structures that had occupied the hilltop for some 600 years. The new civic buildings form new contexts for ?lite consumption, negotiating political power and asserting or claiming social identity in the E city.

A large building dated to the Neopalatial period (MM III-LM I) has been unearthed. The main entrance to the building, a corridor and a series of five rooms have been exposed. The largest room had a paved floor with pebble 'mosaic' in the interstices. There is no indication of fire destruction. The collapsed roof included pumice and fragments of clay with some impressions of constructive timbers. Three architectural phases were identified. Successive deposits date to LM IA and include various ceramics, with large numbers of conical cups, and a deposit of kitchen and storage wares (no less than 76 jars and pithoi).

Betancourt (ASCSA) reports on the 2005 study season: 'The work included study of pottery, metals, ivories, larnakes and other artefacts, as well as study of human bones, conservation of various objects and preparation of material for analysis. Good progress was made on the study of pottery. Statistics were completed on the vessels made from pale fabrics. The conclusions show that a majority of the pottery found in the cave comes from two classes: sets of cups and pouring vessels for consuming beverages; and small closed vessels used to hold a precious commodity in liquid form (such as perfumed oil). Both of these classes can be considered to be offerings to the deceased. The pottery also provides evidence for the gradual increase in size of the community buried in the cave, which must have been very small until it expanded quickly during EM III-MM IA. This year, several vases and all the larnax fragments from the cave were mended, forming almost complete larnakes. They are of an E type (MM I?II), consisting of elliptical basins with flat bases and straight rims. One of the larnakes has a lid, and one is supported on small feet. The sizes are too small for an adult, and perhaps they held bones for secondary burial. However, all the larnakes were broken, and the pieces were found scattered through several rooms of the cave. The situation suggests the possibility that the ossuary is tertiary rather than secondary (i.e., the bones were first moved to the larnakes and later moved to the cave). Because these E larnakes are too small to use as bath tubs (and one has a lid), they suggest that the theory of an origin in secular bathtubs is not necessarily correct. P. McGeorge is continuing the study and cataloguing of the human bones. By laying-out all the broken skull fragments on tables and searching for joins, her team has now managed to catalogue 220 human skulls. Joining fragments came from different levels in the same room as well as from different rooms, confirming the observation that the material was mixed by the Minoans at the time it was placed in the cave in MM II. The same mending and study process was started with other bones, particularly femurs.'

Demos Thrapsanou Galatas Survey Project. V Watrous (Buffalo University, ASCSA) reports on the 1st field season of a systematic survey around the palace of Galatas: 'Fieldwork covered the area between the mod. villages of Galatas, Archalochori and Thrapsano. The project found, or investigated, 44 archaeological sites, ranging in date from LNeo/EM I to the 19th/E 20th Ct AD. On the basis of our 1st field season, we can make a few preliminary remarks about the sites in the Galatas region. The earliest sites seem to date to the LNeo or, more probably, to the EM I?II period. These sites are small and usually near water. Protopalatial sites are apparently rare in our region (relative to other parts of Crete), although it is possible that we have not recognized some of the pottery as MM IB-II. These Protopalatial sites are small and are located similarly to earlier sites. The Neopalatial period marks a dramatic change in the settlement of our region. The number of sites increases sharply. Several Neopalatial sites are relatively large in size, i.e. over 100m in /. Neopalatial sites also can be seen to vary in function: some are agricultural farmsteads, but others seem to have specialized functions, namely, quarries, storage centres, industrial sites and fortified watchtowers ('pyrgoi'). One quarry site (site 17) produced a mason's mark (+) also found at the Galatas palace: it must have been one of the quarries supplying stone blocks to the palace. It seems that the establishment of a palace at Galatas was accompanied by a centrally controlled settlement of the region. The settlement at Galatas was surrounded by large buildings along its S and E outskirts. The possible relationship between Galatas and the site of Archalochori (Profitis Elias) needs to be investigated'. Demos Acharnon Archanes, Phourni.

Herakleion. The focus for fieldwork in 2005 was the urban core of the site; in 2007 and 2008 we plan to focus on the remainder of the valley, including the cemeteries of the community from the BA through to the Byz period. Almost 2,500 units were investigated on a 20m by 20m grid. Within each grid-square, a total collection of artefacts over an area of 10m was made, this being situated to maximize surface and artefact visibility. These procedures afford a systematic 2.5% sample of the surface within each unit; exceptional materials elsewhere in each square were also collected, and all visible features and worked stones were documented on field record forms and by photography. In total, some 4.2 tonnes of artefacts were recovered, the bulk comprising an estimated 350,000 sherds, ranging in date from the end of the Neo to the present. Densities of material exceeded 100 sherds/m2 in some areas surveyed. In contrast with the material normally recovered from rural landscape surveys in Greece, an estimated 20% of the 130,000 sherds examined this year are either feature sherds or decorated, providing an extremely rich dataset for analysis. Given the quantities of material recovered (up to 20,000 sherds some days), only about 40% of the material could be examined in a preliminary fashion this season. Initial sorting of the remainder of the systematic samples will be the primary objective for the 2006 study season, to allow a preliminary overview of all the data, and to inform strategy decisions for the detailed study, documentation and analysis of the entire collection. While up to 25% of the recovered material examined so far is Rom in date, reflecting the latest period of occupation over most of the area surveyed, material from all periods from the MBA to the LRom is well represented. Preliminary examination of about 17% of the systematic samples has revealed patterns largely consistent with the history of the development of the site proposed on the basis of the excavation record over the past Ct. However, we can now begin to suggest answers to major research questions with a more substantial and continuously distributed record than has been available from often widely-separated rescue excavations, themselves concentrated in only some parts of the urban site. Specifically, it appears that the Neo and EM community was probably highly nucleated on the Kephala hill (site of the later Palace), while the Neopalatial city extended over most of the area occupied by the later Rom city (nearly 1km2). Considerable quantities of EHel material suggest that the acropolis hill was within the boundaries of the developing polis centre, while the major historical expansion of the city appears to have taken place in the Hel period, rather than as a consequence of the establishment of the Rom colony. Finally, widely distributed later Rom ceramics, to date only poorly represented in preserved levels in excavations within the urban site, allow the recognition of a reduced, but still substantial community, contemporary with the better-known cemeteries. While based on the very preliminary study of only a fraction of the recovered material, these observations demonstrate the project's potential to address major questions about the history of the development of the site. Overall, the project obtained a substantial, systematic and representative sample of the surface remains from the urban site, as well as locating in situ preserved features for future detailed documentation. These data will allow us to define more precisely than previous fieldwork has the extent of the urban site during the different phases of occupation. The recovery of substantial quantities of a wide range of material will also permit the analysis of the changing internal organi zation of the community, as the wider regional and supra regional role of the centre changed through time, and the exploration of the cultural dynamics involved in the long term evolution of the urban landscape.' Little palace N. M. Prent and S. Thorne report on the 2005 study season for the Little Palace North Project: 'This season focused on the LM through Hel periods as represented in the area excavated to the N of the little palace during 2001 and 2002. The study of the stratigraphy and the associated pottery of the LM to Or periods (11th to 7th Ct BC) was completed. While no architecture of these periods was found, the excavation has yielded evidence for various open-air and industrial activities. In the W part of the excavated area a series of superimposed clay-lined pits, some 2.5m in d., had been discovered. Study of the associated pottery by Coldstream now shows that the 1st of these pits was filled with domestic debris of the LM/EProtoGeo periods (to ca 950 BC), the 2nd in the ProtoGeo period (9th Ct BC) and the 3rd in the Geo period (to ca 750 BC). The pottery consists of sherds rather than whole pots, suggesting re-deposition of material from elsewhere, and therefore provides no direct evidence as to the function of these pits. The preserved pieces of clay pit-lining, differentially fired during the use of the pits, are rough at the bottom, showing that a layer of wet clay was spread out directly on the ground. Several pieces are shaped to form an upright edge. One of these has a half-round indentation at the top, similar to spit stands. Another piece, from the floor of the pit, preserves a mat-impression. Further study of the pit-linings themselves and of the associated archaeobotanical material, which includes the remains of burnt olives, may provide additional clues as to the original use of these pits. In the course of the 7th Ct BC the area of the pits was covered by hill wash, and some disturbance took place in the E, probably in connection with the (re-) building of a terrace wall. Directly to the N of these pits, below a paved Rom road, an earlier road leading down the E slope of the hill proved to have been in use from E in the EIA. The very sandy and pebbly nature of the earlier road levels suggests that much water passed through, a problem that was eventually alleviated by the construction of a drain. The lower fill in this drain yielded worn Or sherds, indicating use in the 7th Ct BC. This is one of a series of drains and water conduits built along this line, the earliest, N of the little palace, dating to the LBA, the latest to Rom times. In the E part of the excavated area evidence for iron working was found in the form of three superimposed pit hearths and a scatter of slag fragments. Study of the associated pottery showed that all three pits belong to the LGeo/EOr period. Ar to Hel contexts include pits, robbing trenches, a well and a series of superimposed floor levels associated with house walls. A few sherds of the 6th Ct BC were identified, predating building activity in the area. In general, Cl strata, including a paved floor and a clay surface that showed signs of burning, were found immediately over levels belonging to the 7t Ct BC. P.J. Callaghan has identified deposits from the L 5th and the E and M 4r Ct BC. In the 2nd Ct BC reconstruction in the area sealed much of the earlier Gr deposits and architecture. The well, though it had been disturbed by Evans's excavation in the area of the little palace, may be associated with this period of Hel reconstruction.'</page><page sequence="109">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2005-2006 109 Demos Ag?as Varvaras Prinias. G. Rizza (SAIA, University of Catania) reports on the 2005 excavation season: 'In the area of temple A excavation focused on the SW area of the celia and part of the pronaos, which were excavated down to the bedrock with the aim of establishing a better under standing of the building, as well as of phases preceding its construction. A stratigraphie sequence from LM IIIC to Geo has been recognized. In the zone immediately S of the eschara a small pit yielded a Geo krater which had been carefully deposited in the pit after its base and part of the body had been sawn off. In the area to the S of temple B work continued on the great monumental building identified in the previous excavation campaigns. The wide central room (VB), which in its centre must have had a great rectangular eschara, has been fully excavated. The room seems to have been re-used during the Ar period, when modest installations were added, probably related to the use of the complex as an artisan's centre. In the area investigated between this building and temple B, two adjacent rooms were partially explored. They are certainly earlier in date, as one of their perimeter walls was clearly cut by the construction of the N wall of the building. At the intersection of the two walls, a deposit was discovered set on bedrock. It was delimited by the corner between the two walls, and also by small carefully laid slabs; under of the floor of the rooms seven LGeo or EOr drinking vessels were found. In the area of the Hel fortress trial trenches confirmed both its 3rd-2nd Ct BC date and the presence of earlier structures, cut by the walls of the later fortress. A great cistern dug into the bedrock has been identified, equipped with a system for collecting rain water. A series of rooms inside the enclosure of the fortress was also found. Fragments of Ar figured stelae, similar to those recovered in the past by Luigi Pernier, had been re-employed as building material in the Hel walls.' Demos Gortinas Gortyn.

Profitis Ilias settlement. N. Allegro (SAIA, University of Palermo) reports on the resumption of excavations in this area after seventeen years: 'The aim of this project is to investigate the most anc. phases of the city of Gortys. This year's campaign was devoted to clearing works, as this area had been damaged by animals and vegetation. We decided to enlarge the excavation of the upper terrace (sector B, N of the E-W road) by a /. of 4m on both sides. E of the housing unit constituted by rooms B1-B2S the team discovered a new N-S street, which crosses the E-W road. A new segment of the E-W road has also been unearthed, so that its actual /. is now 30m. Though excavations were extended to the W, no structures were found, making it probable that the area was not built upon. The two stratigraphie trenches dug in rooms BIS and B2 did not provide any new data, but confirmed the sequence of three important settlement phases; the earliest, ProtoGeo, had so far been known only from individual finds. It is possible to hypothesize that at least in the two later, M 8th to M 7th Ct, phases the settlement was characterized by a certain spatial continuity and by some regularity in structure, implying a degree of urban planning.' Area of the Caput Aquae. E. Lippolis (SAIA, University of Rome 'La Sapienza') reports on the 2005 season: 'The purpose of the campaign was to investigate one of the most important parts of the anc. city, the intersection of two roads which are relevant to the urban planning of the inhabited area. This sector is situated on the borders of the inhabited Ar and Cl area, immediately to the E of an important urban sanctuary devoted to Apollo Pythios, founded in the 7th Ct BC, and occupied by houses only from the Hel period onwards. The earliest remains date to the Hel period, when a temple of the Ionic order, open to the S, with a half-column fa?ade and a great monumental door at the centre, perhaps devoted to the cult of the nymphs together with other divinities (Zeus, Pan), was constructed. In the Flavian age an equestrian honorary monument was built, the covering slabs and the dedicatory inscription of which are known. Another temple building of smaller dimension may be dated to the Antonine period. At a slightly later date the terminal structure of an aqueduct (the Caput Aquae) was constructed, in conjunction with which the two monumental fountains which frame the road were set against the Hel temple. The public character of the area was restored after the earthquake of AD 365, when the N road was endowed with a porch with columns built from re-cycled materials. In the same period a rectangular nymphaeum, which marks the new monumental ization of this area, was erected to the side of the temple. It was perhaps deprived of its function during the 5th Ct AD when pagan cult was officially abolished. From the 7th Ct a new building era started. After abandonment, the Hel building became a quarry for building material.' The theatre of the Pythion. F. Ghedini and J. Bonetto (SAIA, Padua University) report on the 2005 excavation season: 'The area of the orchestra and scenae building was investi gated. The masses of debris which had accumulated inside the cavea cavity and above the floor of the orchestra in the phases following the building collapse were removed (Fig. 161). This revealed further portions of the cavea staircase as well as elements of the entrance of the vaulted corridor which was in an axial position underneath the cavea and served as an access to the orchestra. We also established the presence of a 2nd identical (but collapsed) vaulted passage at the N extremity of the staircases, adjacent to their retaining wall. Below the debris deposit lay the remains of the great collapse that marked the end of the monument, around the M 4th Ct AD. The most important evidence was found in the stage area; constituted by decomposed rubble derived from the collapse of the E sector of the scaenae frons wall. During the excavation of the massive quantity of collapsed building material we recovered the remains of two statues, in a good state of preservation: two female standing statues, around 1.8m h., in fine-grained white marble (Fig. 162). The 1st statue (dressed with peplum and mantle, head and arms missing) can be identified as the type of the Hera Borghese. Near the 2nd statue, fragmentary and also dressed with peplum and mantle, we recovered a helmeted head which identifies the work as Athena, represented according to the Velletri type. It is probable that the two statues, in a later phase of the building, had been transported inside the monument to be re-used.' Kathimerini, Ta Nea, Eleftherotypia (30/09/2005) and To Vima (04/10/2005) report on the discovery of two 2nd Ct AD 2m h. statues (Athena and a headless Hera).

The original floor was exposed under collapsed debris. It was covered with well-preserved great slabs of dense limestone. Following the discovery of two angular benches set against the walls beside the door in the W part of the 1st minor aisle and of a U-shaped bench built onto the fa?ade wall in the 2nd minor aisle, it was decided to continue excavation toward the E with the aim of revealing the respective floors. While the floor of the 1st minor aisle, made of great slabs of dense limestone, 162. Gortyn: Rom sculpture in situ reaches the walls by the sides of the door, the floor of the T minor aisle, made of slabs of friable limestone, seems to underlie the U-bench. Thus, it is clear that the benches represent a later construction phase, a point confirmed by the heterogeneous materials re-employed in the benches. In the narthex excavation work has been completed up to the door of the 1st S minor aisle and up to the wall of the S side of the narthex. Concentrated near the perimeter walls, numerous fragments of small marble slabs were recovered. They probably belonged to a wall decoration in opus sectile. A follis of Justinian from the mint at Constantinople was recovered behind a wall between minor aisle and narthex.' Demos Tymbakiou Kommos.

The destruction deposit (Fig. 164) contained over 100 ceramic vessels, fragments of burned bone, faunal material and other finds including a rock-crystal prism. Protopalatial levels were revealed below the floor of area 11, which implies the existence of an earlier building on site. Area 21 was filled with collapsed building material from the walls and ceiling. Surface levels were disturbed and included a fragmentary LM III stirrup jar and post-BA pottery. M levels revealed fragments of pottery including pithoi. To Vima (06/09/2005) and Ethnos (30/08/2006) report on the 2005 excavation season at this site. Demos Arkadiou Eleutherna.

The article focuses on the stylistic similarities between two pieces from Eleutherna (the badly damaged head of a daedalic limestone statue and the lower body of another one) and the so-called 'Lady of Auxerre' permanently displayed at the Louvre.
