This is followed by a transitional group, dated to the initial stage of Phase Β (2100-1800 b.c.), represented by metal seals in cloisonné technique, and by early Murghab Style stone stamps (excavated at Sa palli, Dashli 1, Togolok 21, Taip 1, and some levels of Togolok 1). The latest group, dated to the terminal stage of Phase Β (1800-1500 b.c.), is represented by late Murghab Style seals and with the near disappearance of seals in the Mol lali phase of Late Bronze Age Bactria. The material assemblage associated with Phase A, the "urban" period, of Middle and Late Bronze Age Central Asia (2300-2100 b.c.), constitutes monumental structures now be lieved to have served as granaries, a rich and abundant metallurgy, and skillfully worked sculpture and artifacts.28 The wealth and typol ogy of this assemblage shows Phase A to have been a period of maximum inter-regional ex change and contact with the urban civilization of Elam, Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley. The distinctiveness of this Central Asian civi lization and its affinity to the cultures of the Iranian plateau have inspired its designation as a "Turanian," or "Outer Iranian" koiné.29 Phase B, the "post-urban" period in Margiana and Bactria, begins with the initial or transi tional stage of the Late Bronze Age (Gonur phase), dated to 2100-1800 b.c., which is fol lowed by a terminal stage of the Late Bronze Age (Togolok phase), dated to 1800-1500 b.c. The ma terial assemblage from this period manifests a re duction in variety, a decline in craftsmanship (with the exception of metalwork), and the dis solution of patterns of interaction with the out side world.30 This period also coincides with the time of the abandonment of important settle ments on the Iranian plateau and the collapse of the Indus civilization in South Asia. The monu mental architecture of the terminal period of the Late Bronze Age, represented by Togolok 21, now identified with granaries and storage facilities, has received a different functional explanation by Viktor Sarianidi. Sarianidi interprets the Togolok 21 structure as a proto-Zoroastrian temple, connected with the preparation of haoma-type ritual drinks, and secondarily with fire worship.31 The shift noted in settlement pat terns and locations in Bactria, during the termi nal phase of the Late Bronze Age, has been linked Fig. 3. Copper-bronze seal (fig. 2), side view. with the introduction of new subsistence strate gies associated with the advent of mounted pas toral nomadism.32 The following stylistic and typological con siderations of the two Bactrian seals under dis cussion (figs. 1-3) suggest their attribution to the initial stage (Gonur phase) of the Late Bronze Age, dated to 2100-1800 b.c. The free, "cursive" style of carving found on the two Bac trian seals most closely approximates that of the Murghab Style seals, from the Gonur and early Togolok phases, of the Late Bronze Age.33 More specifically, the combination of cursive outline, plastic modelling, and axial composi tion, which characterizes the design of the Ko vacs seal (fig. 2), is found in the designs of seals from Togolok 21, in Margiana, the south Bac trian site of Dashli 1, and the north Bactrian site of Djarkutan, in southern Uzbekistan.34 These stylistic features are manifested on a metal seal excavated at Djarkutan, which is similar to the Kovacs seal also in shape, technique, and the material of its manufacture (fig. 4).35 Snake-armed anthropomorphic images de picted on Bactrian compartmented seals from this phase also offer iconographie parallels to the image on the Kovacs seal (fig. 2). A notable point of resemblance is found in the treatment of the raised arms transformed into wings on a Bactrian compartmented seal in the Louvre, in a manner similar to the incorporation of ser pents by the image on the Kovacs seal.36 Meaning If an apotropaic function is suggested for the enigmatic frontal head on the Bactrian seal in</page><page sequence="6">a ζ a r ρ a y: The Snake-Man Fig. 4. Bronze seal from the north Bactrian site of Djarku tan, burial 192, Uzbekistan, dated to the Late Bronze Age, 2100-1800 b.c. After Kohl, Central Asia, pi. 1-c. the Louvre (fig. 1), the same function may be claimed for the image with similar facial fea tures and frontal head on the seal in the Ko vacs collection (fig. 2). However, additional attributes of the latter, represented by bird's wings, bovine horns, and serpent-shaped arms, suggest its identification with a more specific concept. The wings of the image on the Kovacs seal are indicated as short, fin-shaped appendages to the shoulders, rather than as extensions of the arms as found on some bird-armed mon sters in Bactrian glyptic.37 Such vestigial wings appear as ubiquitous attributes of fantastic be ings in Murghab Style seals and for that reason may be understood as a general statement about the supernatural identity of the image.38 The bovine horns of the figure on the Kovacs seal, perhaps a rare instance of adaptation in Bactrian glyptic of the divine attribute in the art of ancient Western Asia, may imply, by comparison with the latter, mastery over cattle.39 But unlike the Mesopotamian version which shows the horns attached to the helmet of the deity, here, as in the glyptic of Eastern Iran, horns grow directly from the head of the image which appears to incorporate the quali ties of the animal.40 Similarly, the snakes that sprout from the shoulders of the figure on the Kovacs seal are shown as actual physical attributes, and as substitutes for human arms.41 This fusion of serpent and man, which invests the human with qualities embodied by the snake, is more graphically literal than the traditional formu las used in the art of the ancient Near East. Thus the snakes on the shoulders of the seated figure in a version of the Etana epic, found on a cylinder seal formerly in the M. Foroughi col lection, are independent of the arms of the figure and appear as extraordinary attributes of the otherwise human image.42 The depiction on Murghab Style seals of serpents, alongside or held by human and anthropomorphic be ings, is seen by Sarianidi as a reference to the chthonic power of the conquering hero.43 The depiction of serpents in this glyptic tradition is also associated with the concepts of longevity, immortality, fertility, fruitfulness of plants, with phallic symbols, and as a reference to hid den sources of water.44 Seen in the context of the subsequent reli gious notions of the Iranian world, the snake man fusion in the figure on the Kovacs seal (fig. 2) conjures up a vivid image of the Zoroas trian concept of Azi Dahàka, whose full name is explained as "snake-man," or "hominoid ser pent."45 As a creation of evil and antagonist of the true mazdayasnian religion, the Avestan Azi Dahâka is believed to have been derived from an earlier Indo-Iranian drought monster, responsible for restraining heavenly waters.46 The Avestan demon Azi Dahâka is transformed into a human tyrant in later Zoroastrian Persian sources which portray Azdahâk, or Zohhâk, as embodiment of foreign tyranny. The evil nature of the latter is manifested in the pair of serpents that sprout from his shoulders.47 In the Shâhnâma the arabicized Zohhâk, an agent of evil and wickedness, must propitiate the serpents on his shoulders by offering them a daily diet of human brains.48 Zohhàk's tyran nical rule over the decimated population of Iran is there said to have ended with the rebellion of the blacksmith Kâva who, through collabora tion with the princely Faridun, vanquished the "dragon-king" and chained him to Mount De mavand to be slain at the end of time.49</page><page sequence="7">a ζ a r ρ a y: The Snake-Man The transformation of the Avestan Azi Da hàka, or snake-man, into a "dragon-king" in Persian sources, as observed by James Russell, is a logical development in Zoroastrian think ing that equated spiritual righteousness and the sovereignty of Ahura Mazda with temporal values of righteous kingship.50 The evolution of the concept of the Indo Iranian drought monster, Azi Dahâka, from its vilification in Zoroastrian sources as an antag onist of true religion, to its identification with Zohhâk, the tyrannical and illegitimate ruler of Iran, is incompletely documented in the contemporaneous arts of the Iranian world. It is only from the latest stage of this evolution ary process that Azi Dahâka, portrayed as the tyrannical Zohhâk, is depicted in the arts of the East Iranian world.51 Had Azi Dahâka, the Indo-Iranian drought monster, found graphic expression in the pro tohistoric art of the East Iranian world, it may well have appeared in the guise of an image similar to that on the seal in the Kovacs col lection (fig. 2). Like the latter image, the hypo thetical figure may have been depicted as an apotropaic male figure whose deified status might have been suggested by bovine and bird attributes, and whose primary function, the manipulation of the flow of rivers, might well have found symbolic expression in the trans formation of his arms into serpents. If the ex traordinary features of the frontal head on the Kovacs seal are seen as a reference to the specific concept of a drought monster, as sug gested here, then a similar notion must surely have inspired the portrayal of the nearly iden tical countenance of the frontal male head on the Louvre seal (fig. 1).
