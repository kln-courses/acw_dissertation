<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY some of the symposiasts had not listened very attentively to each other. Carnap, the logician, quite properly admonishes us against confusing fancies and wishes with data and legitimate inferences; nevertheless, Malinowski, setting out to demonstrate the existence of a "science of culture," neglects this caution, and before long is launched on a polemic in behalf of the kind of social institutions he prefers. With his principal thesis that culture as a dynamic reality is subject to determinism and emerges from the mode of life, there can be only the heartiest assent, although the stress on this commonly conceded point resembles the flogging of a dead horse. But elsewhere one is chilled by the ease with which his distaste for machines leads him to regard them as anthropomorphic monsters. He remains quite impervious to the possibility that not the machine, but the uses to which it is put, as in war, and the mode of eco- nomic control to which it is subjected, may be monstrous. Moreover, he so conducts a triumphant polemic, with Briffault as his unacknowledged antagonist, on behalf of his theory of the family, as to leave the im- pression that The Mothers had never been written. It is also disturbing to find him resorting to threadbare pseudo-psychologi- cal banalities in support of the grim tradi- tion of economic competition. These excursions make one more aware of his lim- itations as a psychologist than of his very distinguished accomplishments as an an- thropologist. But these defects in an oth- erwise admirably vigorous and engaging paper do not mar the general tone of amity which should mark such a celebration and its Festschrift. Man considered retrospectively is well clone throughout the book as a whole. But there is a hesitation to estimate, in terms of the already discernible features of society, what the future conduct of man is likely to become. To me it is regrettable that the Harvard authorities did not see fit to suggest this as part of the assignment of the symposiasts. An excellent oppor- tunity to make this hazardous but lauda- ble venture has been overlooked here. If nothing more, some Harvard alumni would have been grateful no end to know how future Doctors of Public Service and of In- dustrial Coordination, which Harvard will undoubtedly turn out in great numbers during the next three hundred years, will regard our Masters of Business Administra- tion who have but little comprehension of the social implications of business. Will they regard us with the same patronage as we sometimes show toward the founders of Harvard, whose only concern was to insure a supply of ministers? ELLIS FREEMlIAN Sarasota, Florida SARTON, GEORGE. The History of Science and the New IHumanism. Pp. xx, 196. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1937. $2.00. Here is an excellent little book which combines the enthusiasm of the scientist with the background of the historian. Those who have followed Dr. Sarton's work in compending a biographical bibliog- raphy of the history of science from as far back as we can know, will welcome this bit of work, which is, as it were, an apology for the former. The principal thesis is that the scientist needs to be more "human" and the humanist to be more scientific. Humanism and science should not follow different trails, as they have been wont to do. If all progress is really based on science, then the humanist's principal prob- lem is to humanize science, and this is best done by a history of the way in which the needs of man have driven him to science in order to meet them. Practically speak- ing, no student of a science should continue his studies without a history of his particu- lar problem, and such a history would be- come intelligible only as a particular exam- ple of notions common to all science. For the philosopher, this thesis seems rather worn. No student of philosophy would ever dream of doing constructive work on a problem without having thor- oughly reviewed its history. Even though he is fully aware that a certain problem has never had a satisfactory answer, he is no less aware that without realizing the causes of failure, he can make no progress in its solution. But it would seem that this is not the case with the average scientist. Indeed, he seems to be almost entirely un- aware of one age in the history of science, 264</page><page sequence="2">BOOK DEPARTMENT and one geographical section. The time is the Middle Ages, the place the East; and Dr. Sarton has admirably portrayed the importance of this act in the human drama. Here the thesis is developed that during the Middle Ages the seat of scientific prog- ress was in the East. So that the light of learning arose in the East (in Egypt par- ticularly), passed, in the Greek and Roman period, to the West, then, during the Dark Ages of the latter, was shining in Eastern lands again (in Arabia), only to begin its dawning in the West in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. For the rest, if science is that on which all progress depends, then the highest hu- man good, if we may use this phrase, is very similar to Aristotle's, namely, a "con- templation," which is, of course, an activity, wherein we view impartially the truths that science lays before us. Perhaps the artist and the social reformer will here feel a prick of indignation at Dr. Sarton's thesis that real progress is purely scientific. Certainly art is not progressive in the same way that science is. Rather, its progress is additive, so that a Beethoven causes a progress in music in the sense that he adds to its lore. Again, the moralist, or social reformer, is admittedly important for Dr. Sarton, but only because progress in sociology enables more men to taste of science's forbidden fruit. Perhaps, after all, it is merely a mat- ter of emphasis. The moralist would merely reply that any progress in science was progress only because it enabled men to live together in a better society. C. W. CHURCHMAN University of Pennsylvania GUERARD, ALBERT. Art for Art's Sake. Pp. xxxiii, 349. New York: Lothrop, Lee and Shepard Co., 1936. $3.00. This volume is a successor to the previous work by Professor Guerard, Literature and Society, which was an attempt to de- scribe and analyze the degree and the na- ture of the conditioning of literature by society. In the first work, the method of the author was sociological; in the second one, his approach is one of general aesthetic analysis, combined with a discursive at- tack on many problems far distant from the field of aesthetics. One can hardly regard this book as more than an interesting discussion of certain problems which have concerned students of modern culture and the relation of the aesthetic experience to other aspects of life. There is little literary merit exhib- ited, due to the employment of a studied, staccato mode of expression. Frequent references to names, books, musical selec- tions, and various art objects give the reader an impression of a learning which is extensive rather than sensitive, and bor- ders on being exhibitionistic. For all this, the author has set forth an interesting description of the historical de- velopment and modern tendencies within the field of aesthetics, without at any time becoming technical or profound in his treat- ment. The last portion of the book deals with Professor Guerard's suggestions as to the future role and function of art in mod- ern Western society. Having stumbled on the long-recognized social problem born of democratic education running afoul of a system which will not permit all those edu- cated to find jobs commensurate with their ambitions, the author suggests art or "con- scious and disinterested enjoyment in self- expression" as an answer to this crisis in modern social organization. Further, he offers a new interpretation of the role of art in a formula consisting of three levels: art as Functionalism, as the expression of the Joy of Living, and as the Despairing Quest. There are a few good cracks in this book, such as the definition of the "promise of American Life"-which "consists in letting someone else do the dirty work." The au- thor's statement that a nation is "a state of consciousness" deserves a few cheers. As a broad excursion into a wide field of learn- ing, this book has its points. JAMES H.
