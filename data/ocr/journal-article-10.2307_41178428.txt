JAMES L. FITZGERALD The University of Tennessee J-Jow often have individual texts and large and complex tex- tual corpora succeeded in taking on new lives in societies and cultures far removed from those in which they originated? The entire Tripitaka (and more) of the Buddhists of India was trans- lated into Chinese and into Tibetan through vast enterprises of learning, and in China the careers of some parts of this effort - the Lotus, the Heart, the Sukharati - have been quite spectacu- lar. Some of the writings sacred to the Hebrews moved out beyond the boundaries of ancient Israel into the Hellenistic world. That complex amalgamation of them with texts sacred to the early Christians that Christians came to call "The Book" spread dynamically throughout the Roman world, penetrated Europe in powerful ways, and has continued in modern times to be promulgated with great energy throughout the world, and it has been received and lives an authentic life among many diverse peoples. The history of the Koran is another example of a text's successful migration, while the resistance to translat- ing the Koran makes its case interestingly different from the other two. Are there other creations of the human spirit that 539</page><page sequence="2">540 SOUNDINGS should be mentioned here? Homer? Confucius? Dante? Shakespeare? The Upanishads and the Bhàgavàd Gita} What now of the Mahabharata, the 'Great Epic of India/ which Peter Brook has recently produced as a play from a French text by Jean-Claude Carrière? In its native India the Mahabharata (along with its epic cousin, the Ramayana) has been and remains a massively important textual tradition that has functioned within Indian civilization in some of the same ways the Bible has functioned within the West. And it has trav- elled. Together with the Ramayana it migrated with Indian peoples and rulers into Southeast Asia fourteen or fifteen cen- turies ago,1 and it remains a major element of culture in Java in the important shadow puppet theater (wayang Kulit),2 For us, the question is: "Can it travel into the culture of modern Europe and America?" Western literati have been reading and pondering the Bhagavad Gita3 for more than two centuries now, but what Peter Brook has given us is a version of the entire Mahabharata.4 I had the privilege of witnessing the final marathon performance of Brook's Mahabharata in Los An- geles. This use and transformation of the Indian sources pro- vokes me to wonder about the migration of this old titan into our world. The name Mahabharata is best seen as referring to a complex tradition that has spawned many texts and thousands upon thousands of performances in diverse media, and that contin- ues today with great life. Deriving ultimately from traditions of bardic lays (similar to those from which the Iliad arose) likely going back well past 1000 B.C. into the dim Indo-European past, an extemporaneously oral Bharata epic tradition arose in India sometime in the middle of the first millennium B.C. Sometime between 200 B.C. and 200 A.D. a "Great" Bharata religious epic emerged and eclipsed its royal Bharata ancestor. This Great Bharata, the Mahabharata, used some version of the royal epic story for the ethical and theological purposes of a group that sought to reassert strongly the old Vedic ethic of dharma (assimilating one's desirous and purposively active self to the inherent order of things through appropriate ritual and social action). In developing this reassertion, this "Bhagavata" group utilized the rhetoric and the essential insights of the yo- gic religions that had been so successful in India in the fourth,</page><page sequence="3">THE MAHABHARATA: A PLAY 541 third, and second centuries B.C. (the non-Vedic, non-Brahmin religions of Jainism and Buddhism); Brahmin yogic religion ex- isted too (the esoterically articulated Upanishads were its pri- mary expressions), but it never rejected the authority of the Brahmins and the Vedas as did the other two, and for centuries it did not develop the highly organized cenobitic institutions of the Buddhist tradition.5 And it transformed the meaning and practice of both of these older themes (dharma and yoga) by rearticulating them in terms of powerful new accounts of inter- ventions among people by God (Vishnu, an anthropomorphic conceptualization of the unitary ultimate reality of the cosmos with a history quite different from that of Yahweh or Zeus) and popular devotional worship of God. The full development of this Great Bharata presented a mas- sively ambitious cycle of religious instruction centered upon the myth of Vishnu's descent into the world as the God-man Krishna to revitalize dharma by purging the earth of demonic beings that threatened imminently to overwhelm dharma and the earth. Krishna's means for effecting this cosmic rejuvena- tion was an eschatological war - the great eighteen-day war of the Bharata clan that stands as the center of this huge text. And at the center of this myth, as the very heart of the dharmic revitalization, is Krishna's summons to human beings to act, to fulfill their dharma in all circumstances, no matter how bewil- dering or harrowing. A text of this Great Bharata was fixed in writing in Sanskrit sometime before 500 A.D., perhaps even as early as 200 A.D. This written Sanskrit version of the Great Bharata, which must have required tremendous effort to reduce from the contempo- raneous oral and performative traditions, did not replace the traditions from which it arose, though we know little of how it interacted with them in the subsequent centuries. The ongoing oral and performative traditions eventually gave rise also to nu- merous texts in the various vernacular languages of the Indian subcontinent. These traditions are still very much alive in dif- ferent regions of the subcontinent.6 The Brook-Carrière Mahabharata is a nine-hour version of the Indian epic that is consistently insightful, imaginative, and energetic. Carrière's text is a masterful appropriation from the Mahabharata tradition, and it is stunningly produced and per-</page><page sequence="4">542 SOUNDINGS formed. Through meticulous and resourceful attention to de- tails of setting, pacing, music, costuming, and lighting, Peter Brook and his company succeed in bringing to life a complex fantastically remote world. The entire experience is utterly ab- sorbing. All who see it, but most especially those who already know this deeply challenging, sometimes seriously threatening vision of humanity and divinity, owe Peter Brook and his won- drous company a very large debt. This Mahabharata is a splendid new instance of the ongoing vitality of this tradition, one that will, I hope, tempt other Western producers to give us other Mahabharatas in various media. The international nature of Brook's company and so of this rendition of the Mahabharata - with actors from many coun- tries, speaking forth English (based on Carrière's French text) with their various accents - is, if not utterly faithful to the In- dian tradition, remarkable and highly effective. Especially ap- propriate were Yoshi Oida of Japan as Drona, Jeffery Kissoon of Trinidad as Kama, Helene Patarot of Vietnam as Amba and also as Madri, Mamadou Dioume of Senegal as Bhima, Mallika Sarabhai of India as Draupadi. Nolan Hemmings of Wales was quite effective as Abhimanyu and Uttara, but not as Ekalavya, whose character turns upon his race and caste (issues elimi- nated in this version of Ekalavya). Vittorio Mezzogiornio's Arjuna was winning. His name alone fits him to the role. This composition of a Mahabharata company is a powerful represen- tation of the wonderful complexity of life on this planet and an authentic argument for the universality of the Mahabharata. It also is faithful to the ethnic diversity the Mahabharata depicts. I congratulate Brook especially for this feature of his Mahabha- rata. At the same time, I hope someday to hear a rendition of the Mahabharata composed by an English playwright and spo- ken by actors - American, British, above all Indian - for whom English is a native language. I have only one serious criticism of the production. Hard as it may be to believe, the Brook-Carrière presentation of the Mahabharata is a very streamlined version of the Indian epic. And some of what is missing matters very much. For all the delightful genius of Carrière's text, Brook's pro- duction, and the company's realization, there is something deeply unsatisfying about this Mahabharata. The grand hori-</page><page sequence="5">THE MAHABHARATA: A PLAY 543 zons and ambitions of the "Great" Bharata are little in evi- dence. This Mahabharata seems to be about the famous and important royal clan of the Bharatas who were tried by some mysterious doom that fell upon them and virtually wiped them out in a great catastrophic war. Though the text of this Maha- bharata tries to do so, the Mahabharata realized here fails to make the Bharatas plausible as representatives of the entire warrior stratum of the world, representatives, that is, of all human beings who are obliged to act as parts of entities larger than themselves. And the performance does not even attempt to portray the grotesque violence and devastation of the great war as a purgation of the world that is not only necessary but both actually and spiritually survivable. The great war in which this Mahabharata culminates (the war stands at the center of the Sanskrit text; more on this shortly) is presented as a fate be- yond everyone's comprehension, a horrible doom of vast pro- portions that forces the poor Bharatas to fight a desperate, grotesque, parricidal war for survival. The Brook-Carrière portrayal of the war as an inexplicable doom is surely a self-conscious dissent from the Sanskrit Maha- bharata. But the failure of the Bharatas to seem to be more than one peculiar royal tribe is part of a more general and sub- tly effective paring of the text that was dictated partly by the limits of our theater - no single script of the Mahabharata, no matter how perspicacious and ingenious, could communicate all that is necessary to a theatrical audience completely new to the Mahabharata - and dictated partly by choices made in realiz- ing the script on the stage. This Mahabharata is a much thinner, more abstract, much more rapidly moving Mahabharata than is the one in Sanskrit. The effect of these differences is that the Brook-Carrière Mahabharata precludes the ethical argument at the heart of the Sanskrit Mahabharata, and it attenuates the powerful subliminal rhetoric the epic uses to overwhelm its au- dience with that argument. The Mahabharatďs primary interest is not to justify the great war, but to pose the general problem of human participation in socially constructed action. The Mahabharata's interest is to use the "outer epic" of the great Bharata war to set the stage for an epic of the inner life.7 But if the war has no rationale, it cannot</page><page sequence="6">544 SOUNDINGS pose an ethical problem. What Brook and Carrière put in the place of this ethic and this rhetoric is not clear. The Sanskrit Mahabharata is focused upon Krishna's devas- tating eschatological war that develops from what it portrays as a general decay within society. The decay is presented as a dis- solution at the heart of the warrior stratum, the Kshatriyas, and is centered in the preeminent royal family of India, the Bharatas. The entire Kshatriya stratum of society is portrayed as fractious, given to spontaneous strife, rivalry, and warring. For example, the Bharata phratry that descends from the blind king Dhrtarashtra and is led by the princes Duryodhana and Duhsasana is portrayed as innately wicked (duratman, durbhava), and it is their specific jealousies and lusts, in conjunction with their father's moral as well as physical blindness, which bring on the war. The great war is justified as a remedy to this decay by the actions and explicit statements of God incarnate, Krishna, who encourages and participates in the war, particularly in the Bha- gavad Gita. Krishna's words and actions carry great weight be- cause he is presented as an awesome, majestic divinity (who as a man is frequently enigmatic, at times frighteningly ferocious, often aloof and mysterious). All of this becomes a theological argument for the war as the epic narrative is framed in terms of the old Vedic myth of the ever-recurring struggle between the gods and the former gods, the demons (asuras). At a point early in the narrative the corrupt situation among Kshatriyas is presented as the result of hordes of asuras taking birth in Kshatriya families in the heartland of the world. Hav- ing taken up residence on the earth in human guise, the de- mons threaten to overwhelm the principles of order (dharma) in the world. The chief incarnate demon is Strife, Kali (both vow- els are short; this is not the name of the Hindu goddess Kali; in that name both vowels are long), who becomes the Bharata prince Duryodhana. The side of the opposing gods is led by God incarnate as Krishna and by the five sons of the five gods Dharma, Wind, Indra, and the Ashvin twins (the Pandavas, nominally the sons of the Bharata king Pandu). This framing of the epic narrative in terms of the ancient Vedic myth orients the Bharata war and surrounding events unambiguously in clear and simple terms of value. At bottom the villains are gen-</page><page sequence="7">THE MAHABHARATA: A PLAY 545 uinely evil and the heroes genuinely good. Such unambiguous valuation - perhaps relatively late to become a part of the tradi- tion chronologically, but no less intrinsic to it for that - was necessary because the built-in narrative justifications men- tioned above were too uncertain, and because Krishna's actions and words were central to what needed justification. The Mahabharata of Brook and Carrière does not develop such rationales for the great war, and thus the war never be- comes the issue of duty for Arjuna and Yudhishtira that it does in the Sanskrit text. Here the war looms threateningly on the horizon because of some mysterious destiny. This destiny is identified specifically only twice that I recall, once when Vyasa says "the earth has lost its youth .... Now, each day brings us closer to barrenness, to destruction," (page 25 of the Brook translation of the Carrière text), and when Ganesha refers to Vishnu's habit of rescuing the worlds when "chaos" threatens them (40). The Mahabharata 's author, Vyasa, whom Carrière uses cleverly to give his drama continuity, is given to making sly, doomladen remarks about the future and the inevitability of massive destruction ( a role not unknown in the Sanskrit text, but given highly disproportionate weight here). The main protagonists on both sides worry about the likelihood of terri- ble war as a consequence of particular policies they follow, and they are portrayed as consistently anxious about the coming war. A refrain builds on the lips of many who note that Death has settled upon them all. So here the war, rather than being the justifiable remedy for a corrupt earthly situation, is itself the evil given. Although the Sanskrit text's framing rationale - that the earth, groaning under a decay among humans, has requested divine rescue - is mentioned (41), it is not clear why. And the power of the Krishnaite theology is dissipated further by remarks that men- tion Krishna as being a divine agent of rescue and then call that role into question (40, 108). Nor is Krishna here the majestic, frightening, all-knowing God of the Sanskrit text, who at least claims to justify the horror through his very nature. Here he is completely enigmatic and elusive. As in so many other aspects of the text, Carrière's script captures most of the crucial infor- mation about Krishna: He does seem to have a transcending knowledge of these events, he is said to be God on several oc-</page><page sequence="8">546 SOUNDINGS casions, and he is shown acting with the power of a God twice (once in striking off Sisupala's head with his discus, and once in conjuring nightfall before the sun actually had set). He is re- ported to have appeared as the awesome God on two other oc- casions (the two majestic theophanies of Krishna - one at the court of Dhrtarashtra when the villains try to bind him, the other to Arjuna, as the culminating demonstration of the theo- logical and ethical arguments of the Bhagavad Gita), But this Krishna is not a convincing incarnation of any God, in spite of Carrière's scripting. This Krishna is not acting clearly in order to remedy a general cosmic evil that has called him down to earth. Who or what this Krishna is is not clear. Given the general approach Carrière has taken to the war, Krishna's ferocious destructiveness has no place. So there is no real call to show the awesome theophanies. The Sanskrit Mahabharata suggests a divine will responsible for the war and a divine form with a majesty commensurate to the war's horror. This Mahabharata has forsaken that theology. Krishna's role here, the claims made about him and by him, his relationship to the Pandavas and his manipulations of events leading up to and through the war never crystallize into a single pattern. Krishna's cunning is only a scandal. The evil of this war is un- redeemed. This Mahabharata seems to have no point. It seems to be only a perverse tale of misadventure, of puzzling doom. Further, because the Sanskrit Mahabharata is concerned not only to portray the necessity of this eschatological violence but also to render it psychologically acceptable, it places next to its account of the war a commensurate 'cooling,' or 'calming' (santi, pronounced as shaahnti). This santi takes the form of a long series of edifying instructions given to the victorious new king Yudhishthira, who is, at first, so overwhelmed with burn- ing grief at what has happened in his name that he refuses to accept the kingship and moves to withdraw to a life of ascetic repentance and meditation. Derived from an important cate- gory of ritual practice in India (santi rituals), this process of santi seeks to neutralize the 'overwrought' king, his retinue, the wounded and polluted earth, and the audience of the Mahabha- rata as well. Brook and Carrière drastically abridge the new king's expression of grief, eliminate any emblem of the exten- sive justifications of the war that are opposed to his wish to</page><page sequence="9">THE MAHABHARATA: A PLAY 547 withdraw. Gone is all reference to his ceremonial inauguration as king of the devastated kingdom (by which he fully accepts his responsibility for what has occurred), and nowhere is there in- struction in philosophy and ethics as the counterweight to the war itself. These points are chiefly matters of the text's explicit argu- mentation as realized in narrative form, and the differences be- tween this Mahabharata and the Sanskrit text are, I think, ascribable mainly to deliberate choices made by Carrière in cre- ating a new Mahabharata text. But the issues of how the corrup- tion of the Kshatriyas and Bharatas is understood, and how the great war is understood and justified are seriously affected by an entirely different stratum of the Mahabharata, by continuities of feeling and intuition its presentation across time stimulates in the imagination of the viewer, reader, or hearer. Here the Brook-Carrière Mahabharata departs from its Indian sources in another equally massive and important way. The Sanskrit Mahabharata is lush, thick, and full, while the Brook-Carrière rendition is relatively thin and very rapid. The Brook-Carrière Mahabharata does not seem to intend to be lean and spare, but some choices made in preparing the text and in mounting the production bring about that effect. The Brook- Carrière Mahabharata starts off richly, depicting the profusion of births giving rise to the epic's main characters with charm and warmth. The arrival of Gandhari for her wedding to Dhrtarashtra is a wonderful spectacle. The scene at King Virata's court in part two of this Mahabharata has great color, variety, and movement, and it communicates an appropriate sense of human and material density. But while the stage Ma- habharata is never stark or ascetic in its appearance, it generally foregoes communicating the Sanskrit text's sense that all the world is densely thronged with people, demons, gods, seers, and various other beings (though once [40] the world is so de- scribed in a speech). Apart from the two scenes just men- tioned, there is little suggestion through dress, jewelry, garlands, attendants, etc., of the stupendous opulence these princes displayed. The masses of Brahmins that frequently crowd the Pandavas - with their smoky sacrificial fires and their mesmerizing chantings of the Vedas - are absent. Much sensa-</page><page sequence="10">548 SOUNDINGS tional action is described rather than displayed. Especially missed are Krishna's two spectacular manifestations. This thinning of the Mahabharata is accomplished partly by drastic truncation of the cast of characters. Dozens of third- order kings and princes are eliminated from the war, and many of the second rank. Prior to the war the blind king Dhrtarash- tra has one hundred demonic sons, only three of which, Dury- odhana, Duhsasana, and Yuyutsu (absent here), figure significantly in the foreground of the narrative. The others sel- dom move into clear light, but they lurk in the background throughout the Sanskrit epic and make that background thickly fearsome. They are completely absent from this new Mahabharata. In addition, the Brook-Carrière Mahabharata seriously trun- cates the epic's array of first-order characters. One effect is to render invisible the argument of the Sanskrit text that the en- tire world of active men (Kshatriyas), not just the Bharata clan, suffers radical corruption. The warrior who slays the master Drona in the third phase of the Brook-Carrière rendition is in- trinsic to the conception and presentation of the corruption that gives rise to the war. This warrior, Dhrshtadyumna (stun- ningly presented on Brook's stage), is the brother of the main heroine of the Mahabharata, Draupadi, and brother too to Sikhankin, the bitter man who started life as the girl Sikhandini, the avenging reincarnation of the secretly affianced and pub- licly molested woman Amba. The fact that all three are born to king Drupada (entirely absent here) for purposes of vengeance, and that the bloody massacre by Drona's son, Asvatthaman, at the conclusion of the war is part of this dialectic of violence, are omitted by Brook and Carrière. Unfortunately, trimming these characters away is not merely to eliminate a superfluous sub- plot; this web of antagonists generalizes the Mahabharata 's the- ologically important portrayal of societal corruption. This truncation of the cast contributes to the serious oversimplifica- tion of the corruption the Mahabharata depicts in human society. One major effect of this general paring of the epic is that it dissolves the subliminal support the Mahabharata gives to its central ethical argument. The awesome cosmic continuum that the epic's heroes inhabit (and that we inhabit) is the locus of</page><page sequence="11">THE MAHABHARATA: A PLAY 549 'salvation' even as it is the locus of agony and finitude. I find myself wishing Mr. Brook had chosen to be guided by the densely crowded spires of stone that mark so many Indian tem- ples he certainly saw in his travels in India. And I find myself wishing Mr. Brook's stage had utilized the three tall arrays of scaffolding that were each covered by curtains. Had he re- moved those curtains and crowded the stage in each scaffold and cell with characters and activities at important points (e.g., during the battle scenes), he would have captured some of the Sanskrit Mahabharata fs almost palpable density, and thus heightened the terror and desperation that move Arjuna before the war, and Yudhishthira after the war, to try to evade this war, each in his own way. Perhaps Brook and Carrière eschewed those justifying ele- ments of the Mahabharata and eliminated the pacification that follows the war because they rejected categorically the Maha- bharata's attempts to make such grotesque activity acceptable. If so, I sympathize with their point of view. But the Sanskrit Mahabharata is deliberate, clear, and sustained in its arguments for this war. The virtue of non-injury (ahimsa) that eventually penetrated Brahminic Hinduism from the outside (mainly from Jainism and Buddhism) makes only token appearances on the periphery of the Sanskrit Mahabharata. That Mahabharata grows from a worldview that was fascinated by the continuities to be observed within the cosmos, where beings disappear as well as arise and living beings are sustained by the death of other living beings. These themes of the Mahabharata are sometimes deeply troubling, but we cannot avert our gaze from them. The Mahabharata does validate warfare as a means to realize appropriate ends. But this is not the primary purpose of the Great В karata, in spite of the critical role played by the war in its central argument. It is not war in itself the Mahabharata is justi- fying, even when his brothers defend warfare to Yudhishtira as he wishes to withdraw from the world. The Mahabharata is con- cerned with war as a particular instance of human action gener- ally. The religious epic of the "Great" Bharata used the old royal Bharata as the setting for the inner epic struggle that goes on within Arjuna and Yudhishtira just before and just after the</page><page sequence="12">550 SOUNDINGS war. This inner epic movement is the Mahabharata's primary concern, and it uses the great Bharata war to that end.8 This argument was important in India at the time it was made, and it is relevant to us. It was an argument against the religions advocating renunciation of the world and mysticism as the only avenues to render human life ultimately meaningful and valuable. Those religious visions, argued persuasively by Buddhist philosophers and radical Brahmins basing themselves within the tradition of the Upanishads, insisted that the world of multiplicity and action cannot have ultimate value. It is a self- contained, self-perpetuating realm of confusion, death, decay, frustration, and suffering. On the basis of their 'theologies,' rooted in a claim that ultimate reality and ultimate value were ineffable and radically discontinuous with our psyches and our world, the advocates of these religions argued the necessity of ultimate withdrawal from the socially constituted world in which we live, act, and suffer. The skepticism, mysticism, asceticism, and meditative self- transformation these traditions cultivated and advocated are often still persuasive and tempting to many of us - the skepti- cism and asceticism in particular. Our world has so much inex- plicable suffering wrought by nature and by people, by corporate entities we participate in and benefit from, that many thoughtful and sensitive people find relativistic, pragmatic, skeptical arguments persuasive- especially as so many of our own traditions and institutions seem implicated in evils or im- potent in the face of them. Many in America today experience the world as a chaos of competing wills, and some are inclined to withdraw into private self-cultivation. The Mahabharata is an extended, rhetorically powerful ser- mon arguing for dutiful participation in the world. It concocts an image of the most horrifying, withering catastrophe its au- thors could imagine to set up the argument that a person can perform his or her dharma and conquer the horror and grief that arise from doing so. I think this argument of the Mahabharata 's has a certain ap- peal and will find its way among us. All we need now is to dis- cover what is our dharma.</page><page sequence="13">THE MAHABHARATA: A PLAY 551 Notes 1. For a learned but very readable account of the Mahabharata, see The Ma- habharata, Barend van Nooten (New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1971). The first forty percent of the Mahabharata was recently translated by J.A.B. van Buitenen before his death: The Mahabharata, 3 vols. (Chi- cago: University of Chicago Press, 1973-78). I and three other scholars are now completing this work. A new translation of the Ramayana has also recently begun to emerge under the general editorship of Robert P. Goldman: The Ramayana ofValmiki: An Epic of Ancient India, vol. 1, trans- lated by Robert P. Goldman (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985); vol. 2, translated by Sheldon I. Pollock (Princeton: Princeton Uni- versity Press, 1986). 2. See Ward Keeler, Javanese Shadow Plays, Javanese Selves (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987). 3. The most recent translation of the Gita is an excellent verse rendering by one of the most accomplished translators of Sanskrit ever, Barbara Stoler Miller, The Bhagavad Gita: Krishna 's Counsel in Time of War (New York: Co- lumbia University Press, 1986). 4. The Mahabharata is gigantic, fifteen times the length of the Christian Bi- ble, as Carrière states in the introduction to his text (vi). Though the pages of the Poona edition of the Mahabharata may contain fifteen times as many pages as some editions of the Bible, only about a quarter of the Poona edition's size is occupied by the actual reconstructed text of the Mahabharata. It is four times the length of the Christian Bible. 5. Common to the different ancient traditions of this type of religiosity was an emphasis upon radical personal transformation through withdrawal from participation in one's normal roles in the socially constituted world, and some mixture (varying with each tradition) of asceticism and a de- manding regimen of meditation fundamentally transforming body and mind). 6. See the forthcoming work of Alf Hiltebeitel of George Washington Uni- versity on a South Indian cult of the Mahabharata s heroine Draupadi, in connection with which a cycle of performances of the Mahabharata takes place (volume 1 is projected for April, 1988, from the University of Chi- cago Press). Hiltebeitel is also completing a film documenting this cult. 7. I borrow this phrase from John F. Genung's rendition of the Book of Job, The Epic of the Inner Life, eighth edition (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1897). 8. I thus disagree with Mahatma Gandhi's interpretation of the Mahabha- rata, while I think he is essentially correct about the meaning of the Bha- gavad Gita. (See J. T. F. Jordens, "Gandhi and the Bhagavad Gita," in Modern Indian Interpreters of the Bhagavad Gita, edited by Robert N. Minor (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1986).</page></plain_text>
