<plain_text><page sequence="1">"THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF NEEDED" : APOCALYPSE IN GLORIA NAYLOR'S LINDEN HILLS HJEAS Gloria Naylor's outstanding second novel, Linden Hills (1985), has Erovided oth classical ample authors opportunity as well for as critics modern to and link postmodern it with particular feminist works critics of oth classical authors as well as modern and postmodern feminist critics and theoreticians alike. While the novel is, unquestionably, a postmodern version of Dante's Inferno, some critics of the book also looked to Virgil's Aeneid, Plato's Hystera, and even certain works of Luce Irigaray, and Jacques Derrida for clues when analyzing various aspects of this highly complex novel. The title of my paper suggests yet another possibility for association as it presupposes certain correspondences between one of Edgar Allan Poe's well-known tales of mystery and imagination, "The Fall of the House of Usher" and Gloria Naylor's Linden Hills. Although the main concern of my paper is to look at Naylor's novel from the perspective of apocalypse, the reason for suggesting a possible analogy between the two works is not necessarily the fact that Poe's eschatological stories are among the most significant ones within the tradition of American apocalyptic literature. I have chosen "The Fall of the House of Usher" for the title of my paper because there are at least two rather uncanny coincidences in the works which, I believe, legitimize my substitution of the name of Linden Hills' antihero, Nedeed, for the protagonist of Poe's story in the title. What most obviously concurs in both works is the cataclysmic end of both Usher and Nedeed and their respective houses. There is, however, another momentum which is identical in the two works. The immediate cause of the apocalyptic destruction at the end of both the novel and the short story is the (re)appearance of a woman from underground where she has been put by the owner of the house. It is not among my interests, though, to engage in a discussion of why Usher, Poe's psychotic insomniac puts his sister, Lady Madeline of Usher, in a tomb alive, or, for that matter, how her rising from the "dead" leads to the fall of Usher and his house. (Why Nedeed exiles his wife, Willa, into the morgue in the basement of his house will be explained later on). Neither do I wish to search for further analogues between the two works. What I aim to do in this paper is to outline the development of an apocalyptic tradition within the literature of African-American women writers with special emphasis on the apocalyptic in Gloria Naylor's Linden Hills. When discussing the apocalyptic, it seems to be necessary to at least allude to the original meaning of apocalypse which originates from the biblical texts of Revelation. I would, however, like to make it explicit Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies 4. 1-2. 1 998. Copyright Â© by HJEAS. All rights to reproduction in any form are reserved.</page><page sequence="2">that I am going to apply the term apocalyptic to African-American women's writings only partly in the biblical sense of Revelation. I will, in the main, consider the apocalyptic as a critical term which has been used extensively in literary criticism to define and interpret a range of literary works. Accordingly, I will, first of all, focus on temporality ana cataclysm as the two main aspects of apocalypse. The aspect of temporality reflects a more traditional understanding of apocalypse implying the notion of various endings which derive from man's essential perception and experience that reality is timebound, that the world's time and the world will come to an ena. The aspect of cataclysm will be referred to as the opposite of the biblical Millenium. I will use it in the sense of a state of crisis and chaos, both in a physical and moral sense, which can best define the temporal reality of a given socio-historical situation. In addition, I will also refer to D. H. Lawrence's interpretation of apocalypse, since I have found some of his comments both of interest and relevant to my analysis of the apocalyptic in Gloria Naylor's Linden Hills. As a point of departure, I would like to set forth the idea that Naylor, in this particular novel, makes a variation on the traditional apocalyptic model. In her apocalyptic vision, a major catastrophe which is a type of apocalyptic ending, is not followed by rebirth or a new beginning. It is only at the very end of the book that Naylor alludes to the possibility of redemption. Therefore we can even say that her novel is a post-apocalyptic vision in which beneath the seeming order it is chaos and disorder that prevail since the black community of Linden Hills is the scene of hell itself. This is also revealed in the apocalyptic structure of the novel which reconstructs the Dantean descent into the abyss (Ward 67-81). In addition, there is a dialogue preceeding the novel written in verse form which takes place between Grandma Tilson, one of the very few of the community who has escaped selling her soul to the "devil " and her granddaughter, Roberta, who is one of "devil's" victim. In this verse-dialogue Grandma Tilson clearly names the place where they live hell: Grandma Tilson, I'm afraid of hell. Ain't nothing to fear, there is hell on earth. I mean the real hell where you can go when you die. You ain't gotta die to go to real hell. No? Uh uh, you just gotta sell that silver mirror God propped up in your soul. Sell it to who-the devil? Naw, just to the highest bidder, child. The highest bidder, (iii) Grandma Tilson's words foreshadow what seems to be the central concern of Naylor's novel. That is to say, that being black in a racist 300</page><page sequence="3">society is in itself an apocalyptic experience, and, as a consequence, blacks continue to exist on the brim of apocalypse. Gloria Naylor's Linden Hills presents a particular version of the apocalyptic experience of the black people. She creates a post- apocalyptic scene for her narration since the events start after some form of apocalypse has taken place. The apocalyptic event that has created a living hell for blacks to live or rather, die in is, ironically, the foundation of the black community of Linden Hills, which, paradoxically, implies both a beginning and an end. The first Nedeed in tne genealogical line is, in accordance with the Dantean vision, Satan incarnate, who builds a "dead center" in which he contrives his plan of creation. That is actually the point at which Naylor moves away from traditional apocalyptic modes. By modifying the classical foundation myths of black communities as well as by inverting the traditional apocalyptic paradigm - according to which a cataclysmic ending is followed by renewal, a new beginning - she also turns the biblical mvth of creation into an absurd parody. Nedeed, a newly freed slave, acts like God, but he, in fact, inverts God's creation of a world of the living into a world of the dead. His name also suggests this role, which, if inverted, reads almost as "deaden." Naylor's inversion of the traditional myth of creation resonates with the idea that traditional foundation myths lose their original function of giving a community power and coherence as long as blacks constantly have to suffer from the pernicious consequences of slavery as well as the concurrent evils of racial discrimination and oppression. Naylor enhances the absurd nature of Nedeed's mock creation to the utmost. Although in the Bible there is no mention of God's whereabouts at the moment of creation, the anthropomorphic God of Christianity appears in man's mind as residing somewhere up above us, which expresses man's notion of God's omnipotence ana grandeur. Where Nedeed sits for exactly seven days to think out his plan 01 creation is the bottom of a slope. A pit which perfectly corresponds to Dante's hell. Nedeed is also described as a physically repulsive and even awe- inspiring person, but not for the reasons man would feel awe when in the presence of God. Short, squat body, dark, immobile face, thick, puffed eyelids and protruding eyes, which look like bottomless globes - a grotesque, frog-like creature. Perfectly befitting a "miscreant" that he is. People instinctively suspect something unnatural about him to the extent that they do not treat and think of nim like a nigger, which is folly justifiable. As a result of his seven-day contemplation, Nedeed decides to begin his undertaking business and make a burial land out of the bottom of the slope. At this point, Naylor's inversion of traditional order culminates. What Nedeed "creates" is not life but death. The black community of Linden Hills does not even exist when he stakes the land for burying its future residents. There is already an end without a beginning. Such inversion can only produce chaos and disorder. Nedeed's is an apocalyptic creation, a paradox in itself, the beginning of an end. 301</page><page sequence="4">The inversion of the traditional order of the foundation myths of black communities seems to have developed into an effective way of representing the precarious or, we can also say, apocalyptic position of the black people in white American society. Naylor actually revises Toni Morrison's Sula (1973) when creating the "upside-down" reality of Linden Hills. In Sula, Morrison inverts the foundation myth of the black community of the Bottom into a "nigger joke," as a result of which the same topsy-turvy world comes into existence as in Linden Hills, with the Bottom up on a hilltop. Therefore the narration in Sula is also post- apocalyptic, because the tragic end the people of the Bottom will meet directly results from the apocalyptic beginning of the black community. The foundation myths in both novels suggest that only such distorted version of reality can match the evils that loom large in black people's life. The' geography of Linden Hills seems to be even more complex than that of Bottom because it is determined by inverted social and economic hierarchies. The wealthiest live down the slope, whereas the less well-to-do closer to the top. In other words, while success, wealth, and power mean moving higher on the social scale, in Linden Hills it also means moving into a street lower down and closer to the hell created by the Nedeeds. As a result of this inverted topography, up means down and down means up. The significance of the fact that the rich are attracted most to Nedeea's Dantean pit, reverts to the problem of creation and the persona(e) of the creator(s). There is an important parallel between the creation of the neighborhood of Linden Hills and procreation within the clan of the Nedeeds since they themselves bear signs of distorted creation as far as the breeding of their offspring are concerned. It takes five generations of the Nedeeds to build the black community of Linden Hills. Theirs is, however, a most uncommon genealogy. It seems, actually, sufficient to just talk about one Nedeed and use this name as a generic term for all successive Nedeeds. It is legitimate to do so since the Nedeeds do not (pro)create separate human individuals as their children. They produce exact replicas of themselves, or more precisely, the first Luther Nedeed is replicated each time a Nedeed is born. Therefore they each marry an octoroon woman with the sole purpose of procreation. They follow the mechanic pattern of releasing their seed "at the vernal equinox so the child would come during the Sign of the Goat when the winter's light was the weakest" (19). They not only took alike but each of the Nedeeds is given Luther as his first name. Their genealogy is constituted of a series of perverted reincarnation: the same soul enters the same body. That is how the continuum of the horrendous work started by the first Nedeed is ensured ("there must always be Nedeeds" [288]). Consequently, replication can be regarded as a distorted version of creation concerning both the neighborhood of Linden Hills and the Nedeed family. The Nedeeds seem to perfect their art of replication as creation in the basement morgue of their house, where they embalm their former tenants before burying them in the cemetery next to the house. Margaret 302</page><page sequence="5">Homans compares this laboratory of the Nedeeds' with all of its chemicals and cosmetics to that of Frankenstein's of the well-known movie versions, and the Nedeeds to Frankenstein himself. The analogy is correct since, as Homans points out, the present Luther Nedeed "takes pleasure in forming a human being to fit his desire" (376). Such an aberrant mode of "creation," can, however, not be maintained. The final collapse of the replication machinery of the Nedeeds' is inevitable. The present Luther Nedeed changes the routine of his forefathers and marries a pale-skinned woman who bears a white son. Thus, in contrast with the former Luther Nedeeds, his son is a new creation defying the effort of the Nedeeds to replicate. Nedeed, however, does not yield to this failure. He accuses his wife, Willa, of adultery and quarantines both her and their son into the morgue in the hope that there, with all the necessary equipment to hand, she will learn the art of perfect replication. Willa, however, emerges from the morgue with a newly discovered independent identity which she, unfortunately, is unable to maintain. As soon as she starts to reestablish immaculate order and cleanliness in Nedeed's kitchen we witness her lapsing into her former submissive identity as Nedeed's wife. Their son dead now, the possibility of further replication is eliminated for ever, and, therefore, of the continuity of the Nedeed line. Since all three of them burn to death in a fire, we can only guess if Nedeed would have tried to correct the flaw in his son by using the replicating devices in the morgue, had they stayed alive. The fact that they die also presages the end of the topsy-turvy world of Linden Hills and creates hope for its salvation. The basement morgue in the Nedeed house can also be regarded as a small-scale version of the underworld of Linden Hills, where the same machinery for separating body from soul is operated by the Nedeeds. As "the highest bidders," in Grandma Tilson's words, they literally buy people oy giving them leases for a thousand years and a day, which secures the rule of the Nedeeds in Linden Hills for at least as long as that. The length of the lease suggests a possible reference to the biblical Millenium, which signals the thousand-year reign of Christ on earth. But the fact that one more day is added to it marks the distortion of the original meaning of millenium. The spiritual happiness and wealth that the world of Christ brings to people is mcongrous with the inverted world of Linden Hills unless it is corrupted into the thousand year and a day reign of the material wealth (and spiritual death) of the Nedeeds. The rule of the Nedeeds for a thousand year and a day directly results from their apocalyptic creation and thus is defined by apocalyptic chaos and disorder. This idea can be sustained by applying D. H. Lawrence's particular understanding of apocalypse as Revelation. In an intriguing way, Lawrence identifies the biblical Revelation with the revelation of the "undying will-to-power in man," and thus dismisses this last chapter in the Bible as the embodiment of the "power-spirit," or, in other words, the devil enthroned in apocalyptic disguise at the end of the book (14). Consequently, the distorted version of the biblical Millenium can also be viewed as the culmination of the apocalyptic in Linden Hills. 303</page><page sequence="6">The corrupted and destructive authority of the Nedeeds sums up the tragic perspectives of the black people for economic and social advancement in white, racist America. Thus the Nedeeds stand for the "evil" in black people's life and they are also responsible for the topography of absurd social and economic hierarchies of Linden Hills. It is necessary to indicate at this point that Naylor's Linden Hills repeats what most of Toni Morrison's novels (The Bluest Eye, Sula, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby) call attention to as a possible cause of this evil. That is to say, each of these novels emphasizes the self-destructive tendency of the black people to discard black traditions and cultural values in favor of the white ideal of economic success and social uplift. The Nedeeds also submit to the idea that the only way for the black people to be recognized and respected in the white world is to acquire "white money." Thus the originally positive idea of building a black community is corrupted by the emphasis shifted onto the material. "Life is in the material-anything high, wide, deep," reads the credo of the Nedeeds (9). They also believe that "the future of America [is] ... to be white (8). As a consequence, the further down the slope people rent houses the more they succumb to white ideals and standards and, therefore, the more soulless and dead they become - they are "deadened" by them. The final aim of the Nedeeds is to make Linden Hills into a "showcase," an "ebony jewel that reflect[s] the soul of Wayne Country but reflect[s] it black," and to create a "wad of spit-a beautiful, black wad of spit right in the white eye of America" (9). But because of copying the material success of white America, Linden Hills does not display black power as has been intended. As the present Nedeed recognizes, "Something had gone terribly wrong with Linden Hills. ... It had finally crystallized into that jewel, but wore it like a weighted stone around his neck. . . . His fathers had made a fatal mistake: they had given Linden Hills the will to possess and so had lost it to the very god they sought to defy. How could these people ever reflect the Nedeeds? Linden Hills wasn't black; it was successful" (16-17). The apocalyptic creation of the Nedeeds embodied in the foundation myth of Linden Hills entails six-days of "de-creation" of the last Luther Nedeed narrated in the present time of the novel (Homans 378). The events of the six days up to Christmas Eve reveal the inverted reality of Linden Hills. As Willie, one of the two poet protagonists who descend into the hell of Linden Hills when they begin to do various odd jobs in the homes of the rich in order to be able to buy Christmas presents for their families, remarks: "If anything was the problem with Linden Hills, it was that nothing seemed to be what it really was. Everything was turned upside down in that place" (274). Both him and Lester witness that any intervention by Luther Nedeed in the life of the inhabitants of Linden Hills brings on some form of death. Nedeed makes up a dead woman for the funeral over which he presides, he organizes the soul- killing marriage of a homosexual man although he knows that it will lead 304</page><page sequence="7">to his suicide, he brings about and looks on the suicide of a woman, and finally, he instigates tne death of his son and wife as well as of his own. Thus we can say that the life of each individual in Linden Hills is determined by the apocalyptic creation of the Nedeeds because both directly and indirectly, it prompts their "end." In Naylor's apocalyptic vision, however, it is not only the tenants of Linden Hills that are shown as victims - victims of the creation of the Nedeeds - but the Nedeeds themselves as well. The evil that they represent has always been part of the black experience as the opening of the novel states, "The fact never disputed by anyone was that the Nedeeds have always lived there" (2). The haunting memory of slavery, racial discrimination and oppression, the agony of frustrated dreams, and the need to assume alien roles and life-styles compel blacks to prove their worth to the white world at whatever cost. Consequently, we can best define the precarious condition of the black people as an apocalypse of race - a term borrowed from Mark Ledbetter which he supplements with the apocalyse of sex when examining the black female experience (37- 55). This term is not only applicable to Naylor's Linden Hills but to any other works dealing with the black experience in a similar way. Inasmuch as the existence of Linden Hills is a necessity, since "The Nedeeds had made a history there and it spoke loudly of what blacks could do" (16), its end is also unavoidable. No more replication is possible in tne Nedeed line. In the final cataclysmic episode of the novel, Nedeed "falls" together with his son and wife, as well as his house. Their "fall" is symbolic because they actually fall into the fire of hell where they burn to death. In presenting the final cataclysmic event Naylor reverts to the traditional apocalyptic paradigm. Although it is not stated explicitly, there is still nope for spiritual rebirth and a new beginning for the black community of Linden Hills after the apocalyptic end of the Nedeeds. The people in the rich neighborhood of Linden Hills take the initial step when they look on with cold detachment as the house of the Nedeeds is consumed by fire. This indifference- which is best expressed by Willie's comment, " 'They let it burn,' "(304) - signals their inchoate antagonism towards the Nedeeds and the hell into which the Nedeeds have turned their life and points towards a future resurrection. Thus the last of the six- day decreation of Luther Nedeed which has brought on his self- elimination as well, implies the possibility of new creation. That is what the date also signals: December 24, the birthday of Christ, the Redeemer, anticipates redemption, a new beginning. Gloria Naylor's usage of the apocalyptic model proves to be a significant way of demonstrating the fact that the creation of a black upper class neither has empowered the black people nor has it solved the problems of racism. The apocalypse of the fall of the house of Nedeed carries the import that the pursuit of the white model of success is inimical to the black community because it only fragments and destroys it. Naylor, however, does not so much give us a solution as shows that 305</page><page sequence="8">the mere knowledge of the paradoxical situation of the black people can be a first step towards some form of positive change. In the novel, it is Willie, the young poet, who, having gone through initiation by descending into the hell of Linden Hills, fulfills this promise. He is going to assume the role of Gloria Naylor and translate his experience into an epic poem about Linden Hills. WORKS CITED Christian, Barbara.
