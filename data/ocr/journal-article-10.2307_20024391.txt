<plain_text><page sequence="1">KURT W. FORSTER Aby Warburg's History of Art :. Collective Memory and the Social Mediation of Images A research institute of international stature and its renowned publication series both carry the name of Aby Warburg (1866-1929), but his scholarly achievement remains rather obscure despite a recent "intellectual biography" by Sir Ernst Gombrich.1 His reputation as an art historian is overshadowed by his fame as the founder of the kultur wissenschaftliche Bibliothek in Hamburg, which became the nucleus of the library at the Warburg Institute after its transfer to London in 193 3. The eldest son of a Hamburg banker, Warburg studied art history?then a meth odologically immature field only recently admitted to university faculties?but decided against a university career. Not until his last years did he teach, and then only as a Honorarprofessor, after devoting his entire life to the study of art. His few succinct publications appear as only the torso of a potentially gigantic lifework in the propor tions of nineteenth-century scholarship. He concerned himself almost exclusively with basic problems of cultural history, and he hoped to prepare the way for new and com prehensive investigations, yet his entire published work fits easily into the 438 pages of the Italian edition, index and all.2 The original German edition of 1932 was virtually deprived of impact by the Nazi takeover, and, with one peripheral exception, War burg's writings still remain unavailable in English some forty years after the transfer of his research library to London. What little is generally known of Warburg's work today is almost totally indirect and frequently distorted. Several of Warburg's topics and some of his methodological queries were pursued by Fritz Saxl and Erwin Panofsky, who are widely considered to have been the exponents of a supposedly Warburgian iconology in England and in the United States.3 Some of Warburg's focal themes, such as Renaissance and Antiquity in their historical dialectic, the mediation of figurai traditions, Netherlandish painting, D?rer, and astrological and speculative imagery, received extended treatment by both scholars, particularly Panofsky. However, while Panofsky's approach is often catholic and syn thetic, Warburg's has an altogether different cast. Comprehensive in concept and criti cal in its evaluation of evidence, his questions aim at the role of collective memory and the social functions of art. Warburg's scholarly ideas reflect uncannily the conditions of his personal life. Far from blunting the relevance of his achievement, these personal circumstances illumi nate fundamental issues of historical scholarship. Detachment from the consuming 169</page><page sequence="2">170 KURT W. FORSTER force of events was his aim and virtually his definition of higher forms of social organi zation, but he could not remain aloof from the historical events and the psychological turmoil of his lifetime. He shared with the great historians of his time a heightened experience of evolution, of a tremendous thrust of forces. His sense of the significance of records in Western culture made every artifact appear as a solidified moment in the flux of historical life. Warburg's devoted interest in seemingly random records, ephem era, and trivia led to a form of voracious collecting that bordered on obsession. As an indefatigable gatherer of anthropological data, Warburg was as much the prey as the hunter: he wanted to discover the motor forces of historical life, but he could only per ceive them in terms of the psychological conflicts that drove him on. The establishment of his library assumed such significance in Warburg's thinking and the extraordinary labor he invested in its development overreached the mere use fulness of a scholar's hand-library to such a degree that we may well ask why he should have devoted so much of his life's energy to it. In 1900, he wrote to his brother, pleading for a more generous allotment of family funds for his library, that "in the last analysis we are all rentiers, and terribly interest-minded. ... I would not hesitate for a moment to enter my library as a financial asset in the accounts of the firm."4 There was only one real return from the tremendous investment of the library: his research, a book, which in turn would be reinvested into the gigantic capital of knowledge. War burg plainly recognized the financial and social conditions of his own scholarship when he insisted that "we should demonstrate by our example that capitalism also makes the labor of thinking possible on the broadest basis, as only capitalism is able to provide it."5 Warburg intended to approach the study of history and of artifacts on the "broad est basis" indeed. The first condition for his work was to be met by a systematic collec tion of vast information, the second by a carefully guarded distance both from the object of historical investigation and from the onrushing life around him. Warburg recapitulated in the story of his scholarly research and in the growth and transformation of his library one of the crucial chapters in the changing conditions of intellectual work. In forming his library he returned almost to the conditions of the early nineteenth century, to the private scholar who, like Alexander von Humboldt or the Grimm brothers, furnished his intellectual workshop with books and manuscripts as the skilled artisan equipped himself with tools and materials. But precisely the work of Humboldt and the Grimms had done much to establish the industries of knowledge, the nineteenth-century universities, where material and staff resources escalated into a scholarly production beyond the individual's scope. For personal reasons, Warburg was reluctant to take up a university post, and he was also dissatisfied with the working conditions in institutional libraries. As a pioneering entrepreneur and private investor, he created his own firm, an intellectual officina which, in the end, went "public" as a consequence of the political and financial havoc brought on by the Third Reich. Yet, these obvious circumstances tell only half the story, the other half is as impersonal as the first is private. Warburg's stance of the totally committed private scholar recalls the Enlight enment, just as his preference for books over art objects signals his emancipation from the values of his high patrician class. The most important aspect of his research library</page><page sequence="3">aby Warburg's history of art 171 lies perhaps in the contradictory nature of its role and purpose in Warburg's work. The potentially limitless scope of written information and graphic representation contained for Warburg the historical reality of human development and creation. Consequently, his library took on the function of a vastly enlarged memory. Warburg considered man, in body and mind, the living evidence of his own development. Human products, most compellingly aesthetic creations, told and retold the functioning of personal and social memory. The fixed and hidden layers of human development, he found, would be recalled spontaneously and consciously by civilized man. Human expression in its most encompassing definition, and hence as an anthropological category, became the central focus of his studies and the true subject category of his library: Therefore [he explained in 1923] I envisage as a description of the aims of my library the for mulation: a collection of documents relating to the psychology of human expression. The ques tion is: how did verbal and pictorial expressions originate; what are the feelings or points of view, conscious or unconscious, under which they are stored in the archives of memory? Are there laws to govern their formation or reemergence?6 Why did the long history and wide scope of human expression hold such funda mental significance for Warburg's analysis of works of art, precisely at a time when the history of art began to acquire status as an independent academic field with a certain autonomy of approach? True, its autonomy was largely one of arrogant exclusion, based on rigid canons of appreciation and an ultimately financial test of value. One name, that of Bernard Berenson, jumps to mind to contrast with Warburg's at the time. One could easily draw a network of inverse correspondences between the two men, but only those that matter in a discussion of Warburg are worth mentioning here. Significantly, both Warburg and Berenson bequeathed institutes to their profession which were intensely personal instruments as well as symbolic headquarters for schol arly camp-followers. Whereas Warburg spent his means to create an instrument of scholarship, Berenson used his scholarship to become a man of means. At the identical stage in the development of an art historical discipline, Berenson made a fortune in authenticating works of art, while Warburg spent his in a demonstration of the collec tive human origins of every authentic image. Berenson recreated primitive fetishes of experience in a commercial world, of which, in Warburg's view, photographic snap shots, postage stamps, and posters seemed to be some of the most pregnant images. In the context of a searching assessment of art historical approaches, Warburg con sidered the likes of Bode, Morelli, Venturi, and Berenson to be "hero-worshippers, but in their ultimate derivations they are only inspired by the temperament of a gourmand. The neutrally cool form of estimation happens to be the original form of enthusiasm peculiar to the propertied classes, the collector and his circle."7 Warburg not only associated ownership of art with luxury; he also considered it an obstacle to a proper analytical grasp of artifacts. The collector, as much possessed by his treasures as he is their owner, regresses to the "primitive values" of physical possession.8 This is more than aversion to the milieu of his family, though aversion it was, too, as Warburg con fessed in retrospect: "Opposition against property [ownership] and elegance ? la fran?aise, Alsterufer."9 The Alsterufer, Hamburg's most fashionable patrician address,</page><page sequence="4">172 KURT W. FORSTER stood symbolically for a society that had use for works of art only as investment and as tokens of social status. For Warburg, however, the individual work of art has value above all as a record, as a highly complex and productive response of human memory to a particular situation. The peculiar quality of artifacts lies in their socially mediated functions (as memory and response), for Warburg learned, ... in the years of work among the Florentine records, ... to understand the work of art as the outcome of a situation which involved the patron no less than the artist. It is in focusing on a given commission, and on the solution that emerges from conflicting possibilities which the his torical situation presented, that Warburg's approach achieved its greatest triumph.10 In a series of analytical steps, like concentrically expanding rings around the arti fact, Warburg attempted to reconstitute its original context through historical research. His models were less the contemporary art historians in their prejudiced and partial examination of historical records than the great historians of his day, Heinrich Brockhaus and especially Robert Davidsohn. In Jakob Burckhardt he criticized the often parallel but unconnected treatment of history and of art, and, with major publi cations of the early nineteen-hundreds, took up where Burckhardt left off with his Beitr?ge zur Kunstgeschichte von Italien (published posthumously in 1898). Burck hardt had compiled a useful but rather mechanical account of the portrait genre during the Renaissance to which Warburg responded with a concise essay on Portraiture and the Florentine Bourgeoisie (1902). He set the prominent appearance of local patricians among the saintly actors in the frescoes of Florentine chapels in connection with the almost totally forgotten practice of placing life-size wax figures as votive images in churches. In these conflicting traditions?pagan dedication of images, on the one hand, and the devotional context of Christian imagery, on the other?Warburg recognized fundamental contradictions of a particular historical moment and place; contradictions, moreover, he felt to be so essential to the dynamics of the Renaissance and of recent times that he explored them in a series of further essays on Francesco Sassetti's Last Will and Testament (1907) and on the cultural exchanges between North and South. Of all of these studies may be said what Warburg recognized as the unfulfilled promise of Burckhardt's own research, namely, that the historian "did not avoid the labor of investigating the individual work of art in its direct connection with the background of its time in order to interpret the ideal or practical exigences of real life as its 'causal ity.' "n The driving question of why a work of art resulted in its particular form and quality demanded an answer. Memory, as the abstract sum total of human history, gave an ever changing response to different situations. With the concept of response Warburg sacrificed one of the most cherished notions of academic art history in his time, the concept of autonomy for both aesthetic values and artists. Theories of an independent formal development of art?typified by W?lfflin's Renaissance and Baroque of 1888?and narrow explanations of formal qualities as a mechanical result of conventions, material properties, or preferences of taste came under close scrutiny. By contrast, a true history of artistic production needed to recognize both the full spec trum of artifacts?and Warburg rarely tired of inveighing against the arbitrary selec tion of objects according to traditional aesthetic categories?and their instrumentality</page><page sequence="5">ABY WARBURG S HISTORY OF ART 173 within a cultural context. Without its cultural context the work of art is homeless, stranded in an alien setting or in a neutral repository. Warburg's brand of Kulturwissenschaft was not satisfied with an explanation of works of art as mechanical derivations from the material basis, nor with their dis tillation into a pure history of ideas. In both he criticized the fabrication of false conti nuities and the arbitrary identification of causes. A proper kulturwissenschaftlicher approach would need to take account of the fact that culture is generated from material bases and that it produces ideas, but this production of culture is, for him, determined neither by material processes nor by ideas. He felt that the entire economy of cul ture came down on a psychic balance sheet with the total biological heritage, the social liabilities and expressive expenditures of man oscillating around a precarious equilibri um. It dawned on Warburg that historical thinking involves a dual reflection : the pene tration of its object from the past, and the recognition of the historian's own time and contingency. He realized that, as a historian, he reproduced the object of his study from a temporal and cultural distance, a distance which translates itself into a difference of stage and process within the continuum of history. If this process is taken seriously, then any meaning that artifacts may hold must be defined from the fundamental duality of historical knowledge?that is to say, artifacts either carry meanings that are recon structed within the context of the society which produced them, or they acquire signifi cance in the thinking of the historian and in the experiences of his contemporaries. These two meanings are separable, though they are always connected in the historian's recognition of their difference. Warburg confessed in the last year of his life (1929) that "often, it appears to me, as if I derived [meaning] from the realm of images in an autobiographical reflex as a psychohistorian of the Occident."12 Today, we may have difficulties with Warburg's view of vast historical processes as a kind of psychomachia, but there is no denying that he sought to render these conflicts of human experience and history in highly specific and amply documented instances. Art historical analysis, as Warburg envisaged it, would restore to the frozen and iso lated images of the past the dynamics of the very process that generated them. He hoped to comprehend them as the witnesses to an otherwise irretrievable phase of human development. In the course of history, he argued, man developed instruments of defense against an aboriginal angst. By means of external control he made his way toward an internal emancipation from his fears and beliefs. As a student of Darwin, Warburg considered the acquisition of culture a very gradual process, but doubted that the territory of freedom and mental control was a permanent gain. His Enlightenment view of scientific advance was tempered by a profoundly pessimistic evaluation of the dialectics of human progress. The constitutive characteristic of culture in Warburg's view, a sense of distance and control, faintly recalls the aloof social tone of the Hamburg patriciate. For Warburg, critical detachment was a personal necessity, not simply a legacy of his class. Human detachment from the real and threatening power of natural and political forces was in constant peril, and the rapidly growing technology of his day rekindled ancient fears in Warburg's mind. In 1895-96, during a trip across the United States, Warburg paid</page><page sequence="6">174 KURT W. FORSTER special attention to two peculiar aspects of American culture: popular magazines and the tenaciously surviving culture of Indian tribes. In his study of Pueblo ritual in New Mexico, he detected "the essential character of the conception of causality among the 'primitives,' . . . the 'corporalization' of the sense impression."13 The modern historian of Warburg's persuasion, on the other hand, would comprehend historical causality in a "de-corporalized," analytically distanced reading of symbolic representation. The coexistence of two totally different cultures on the American continent, a primitive and an ultramodern one, alerted Warburg to a potential loss of detachment and distance that threatened to throw man back to a newly "primitive" state. This "dialectic of Enlightenment"14 froze in Warburg's memory into the following con frontation on a snapshot he took in 1896 : I was able to catch with my camera in the streets of San Francisco the conqueror of the serpent cult and of the fear of lightning, the heir to the aboriginal inhabitants, the gold-seeking intruder into the land of the Indians. It is Uncle Sam with the top hat proudly striding along the road in front of an imitation classical rotunda. High above his top hat there stretches the electric wire. By means of Edison's copper serpent he has wrested the thunderbolt from nature. The Ameri can has no fear of the rattlesnake. He kills and exterminates it but certainly does not worship it. . . . Lightning imprisoned in the wire, captive electricity, has created a civilization that does away with paganism. What does it put in its stead? The forces of nature are no longer conceived as anthropomorphic or biomorphic shapes but rather as infinite waves obeying the pressure of the human hand. By this means the civilization of the machine age destroys what science, emerging from myth, had painfully conquered, the zone of contemplation that became the zone of reasoning. The modern Prometheus and the modern Icarus, Franklin and the Wright Broth ers who invented the dirigible aircraft, are the fateful destroyers of that sense of distance who threaten to lead the globe back into chaos.15 If these words have a strangely anachronistic ring and, at first sight, the appearance of doubtful logic, they become terribly real if we think of the technicized warfare of 1914 18, of the holocaust of the Second World War, and of the threat of total annihilation through atomic warfare. Modern technology permits greater control and distance?in Warburg's words a more spacious zone for thought?but it has also abolished all escape from the threat of total destruction. It is tragically fitting that the advance of the First World War and the collapse of Germany cost Warburg his sanity. As the war spread, he abandoned virtually all scholarly work in a desperate effort to cope with the course of events on the level of information, that is, at a distance. His friend and pupil Carl Georg Heise recalled that Warburg daily "concentrated all his energy on gathering clippings from the seven most important newspapers, foreign ones among them as long as he managed to obtain them, and to jot down . . . brief but telling comments" on the events.16 In its futility, Warburg's "insane" effort reflects the utter incomprehensibility of events, and in its desperate persistence, the necessity to cope with them in the hope of discovering their causality. If an explanation could be found, then an element of logic would render in terms of the mind what defied human comprehension. In 1923, after Warburg had regained his mental balance and recovered his ability to do research, he embarked upon another gigantic project, long prepared by many earlier efforts and curiously reminiscent of his compulsive gathering of information</page><page sequence="7">ABY WARBURG S HISTORY OF ART 175 during the war years. He attempted no less than an atlas of expressive human gestures through pictorial and diagrammatic records extending to the most recent news photo graphs and including ancient and medieval reliefs, Renaissance paintings, and even postage stamps. Far from merely compiling similar human gestures through their his torical transformation in pictorial records, Warburg was keenly responsive to ambi guities and even reversals in their function and meaning. He was too much a historian of material culture to fall into the trap of the iconographers. Even in its physical for mat, the preparation for the Atlas of Memory abandons the customary linear discourse of the book. Warburg arranged photographs and reproductions on large screens in order to establish the historical recurrence of key figures and gestures in polythematic patterns. He recovered on the large scale of history the small and seemingly ephemeral vocabulary of human expression. In a rather surprising analogy to financial notions, he explained his ideas on collective memory to members of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce: He spoke of the gold reserves of suffering of which our civilization disposes and compared the ancient heritage to a mint or "savings bank" whose issues were backed by the archaic passions of which they bore the stamp.17 The sheer quantity and constant flood of images in modern times may aptly parallel the financial consequences of inflation. If Warburg had listed photography?a form of vastly expanded memory storage?among the instances of qualitative advance in mod ern scholarship,18 he may have realized, a quarter of a century later when embarking upon the Mnemosyne Atlas, that the dialectics of progress had optimized his means of mapping the historical development of mimetic language, while the increasing uni formity and inflation of images threatened to wipe out large expanses of collective memory. In a very immediate way Warburg attempted a scholarly salvage operation of European culture. Like Marcel Proust, who in his recherche du temps perdu docu mented at a distance a world which was subjectively lost before it was actually destroyed, Warburg recovered, in the face of imminent collective amnesia and vast future destructions, the history of human emancipation in his own "psychohistory." Mimetic and gestural language he considered the very medium of historical continuity. As he put it, in 1903, in distinguishing his own approach from that of other art histo rians, "the conditions and limitations which are rooted in the mimetic nature of man"19 were to be the subject of his analysis. The plastic arts constitute the only con crete record of man's mimetic activity outside his own collective memory. Warburg sought to do no less than break the code of his cultural heritage at a time when much of that heritage had paled and fractured, and, with the world wars, was to be physically shattered and perverted. With the Atlas of Memory, Warburg responded to his urgent experiences of the fragmentation of culture and, through his intense work in Rome (1928/29), he sought to counteract his profound sense of loss. In organizing the material for the Atlas, his conceptual means, and to an extent his graphic arrangement of images, were similar to those of Schwitters' collages, his scope and interpretative goal nothing short of Proust's or Robert Musil's, but any individual's inadequacy to such a task tragically illuminates</page><page sequence="8">176 KURT W. FORSTER the unfulfilled social mediation of that very culture. The personal effort of the historian recalls, once again, the dual reflection of historical thought: He and his ideas are as contingent as the object of his study. Only to the extent that he perceives his own condi tions will he be able to develop a critical understanding of the true conditions of past life. With the abortive project for the Atlas of Memory, Warburg may have realized that both the culture of his class and his own single-handed salvage operation were his torically doomed. In the very subject of his study?the social mediation of expressive human communication and the transformation of its language?he seized upon the failures and achievements of collective memory in history. It would be difficult, indeed, to define a more comprehensive theme for the study of cultural history in the twentieth century.

After a long interval, art historians are now returning to a critical histori cal analysis of the circumstances and conditions of artists and, hence, to the historical mediation of aesthetic values. The development of modern historiography pivots around ideas of change as a result of forces at work within society itself. By expansion of the concept of process and production, the modern historian rec ognizes anything a civilization has brought forth as a product rather than as a dense and self-contained object. As he reproduces that object in his thought, he aims to recover the motives for its creation. These arguments necessarily embed the artifact in a context and thereby restore to it a condition of historical understanding. Being mainly concerned with ostensibly dense and self-contained objects, art historians have been slow in abandoning the notion of artistic autonomy (cf. my "Critical History of Art, or Trans figuration of Values?", New Literary History, III [1972], pp. 459-70). 4Gombrich, Warburg, pp. 129f. 5Gombrich, Warburg, p. 130.
