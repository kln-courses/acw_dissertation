<plain_text><page sequence="1">BEND SINISTER AND "TYRANTS DESTROYED": SHORT STORY INTO NOVEL In comparing the structure of Nabokov's short stories with the structure of his novels, one is immediately faced with a problem: did Nabokov in fact write any novels at all? The question arises because it is generally agreed that the emergence of the novel in the eighteenth century is unavoidably linked with the new scientific rationalism and that the novel is realistic in character, plot, and setting. The short story, on the other hand, has its roots in the irrational —in legend, myth, and folk tales as they derive from the romantic tradition. In its origins as practiced by Poe, Hawthorne, and Gogol, the short story is charac terized by the doubling of characters and worlds, the fragmentation of identity, and the movement toward the isolation or liberation of the self. These are traits which Northrop Frye identifies as typical of romantic fiction, which includes the surreal. Thus the novel tends to be rational in foundation, real in emphasis, and social in thrust; the short story tends to be irrational in foundation, surreal in emphasis, and psychological in thrust. The traditions, it appears, are distinct. It is significant that Nabokov, who is normally chary of praise for novelists, has expressed an unusual degree of admiration for the writers whom we have credited as the originators of the short story. He says he once liked Poe, he calls Hawthorne "a splendid writer," and he refers to Gogol as "the greatest artist Russia has yet produced." Thus it is not surprising to find that Nabokov's short stories, though different in some ways from those of his predecessors, are charac terized by romantic structures and motifs. More surprising, perhaps, is the fact that Nabokov's longer works, which are generally called novels, are characterized by these same motifs: reciprocal worlds, the confusion of identity, the movement toward the isolation or liberation of the individual. These motifs are implicit in the technique of doubling. Nabokov pointed the way to a study of doubling in his fiction with the famous "unwinding spiral" and "magic carpet" passages in Speak, Memory — and in fact many such studies have been made. L. L. Lee concludes that "It is the concept of the double which is the Ariadne thread to lead us into and through the labyrinth of Vladimir Nabokov's short stories," and Lee goes on to note that Nabokov's famous spiral "gives us the base for our doubleness."1 In regard to the doubling of time in Ada, Nancy Anne Zeller points out that "events are free to recur, but on a different level, a higher level, their meaning enhanced by union with a similar past event. These recurrent events line up vertically on the spiral."2 Page Stegner extends the notion of the spiral to Nabokov's fiction in general, noting that "the 'spiral unwinding of things' seems to suggest to Nabokov a structural norm that becomes the basic design of much of his fiction."3 Phyllis Ann Roth concurs, arguing that "each novel progresses by l"Duplexity in V.

Thus L. L. Lee is correct to note that Nabokov's doubling is "the artistic realization of the unity of opposites"5—a synthesis, as Carol T. Williams has observed, in which "the contradiction between death and life is not eliminated, but honored as the basis of beauty."6 It is this kind of synthesis that often results in the liberation or destruction of the protagonists at the ends of Nabokov's works. Since the motifs outlined here are characteristic of romance, it would ap pear that Nabokov, like Hawthorne, Melville, and the Brontes before him, is more a romancer than a novelist—even in his so-called "novels." If so, he is the modern heir to the romantic tradition. Thus to be safe let us drop the term "novel" from this analysis and rephrase the question: what are the structural dif ferences, if any, between Nabokov's longer works and his shorter ones? Let us begin this analysis with a premise: that the work of fiction—in Welleck and Warren's terms the "poem" — proceeds outward from an undifferen tiated core of experience, data, images in the mind of the poet —a kind of primeval soup in which everything is potentially identified, by metaphor, with everything else. Creation, then, consists of a process of division, particulariza tion, and differentiation which occurs as an original image or idea divides, then subdivides to reproduce the people, places, and incidents characteristic of its genre, much as in biological reproduction an ovum divides and subdivides to produce the head, arms, teeth, and internal organs that are characteristic of the species. Obviously in an imaginative work of fiction what is divided is the self—if we consider the self as a moral unity that bridges time and space. Thus, division on the temporal plane gives us past, present, and future: plot, birth, death and the fear of death, memory and desire. Division on the spatial plane gives us set ting; horizontally, the world of real experience; vertically, the flickering silhouettes of heaven and hell cast in terms of our real experience—the red sandbox from a neighbor's backyard, the power mower from the Sears and Roebuck catalogue as symbols which extend meaning to an ideal world above the surface of the narrative, and a nether world below it. On the moral plane division gives us characters: fragments of the personality, the familiar cast of romance and melodrama (sometimes appearing in disguise), protagonist and antagonist who, taken together, form an identity with the temporal and spatial realms. Conflict is inherent in the divided whole and is resolved only when identity is achieved once more. If this description of the creative process holds true, it holds for all nar rative fiction, short and long. The process of division, extended indefinitely, would eventually give us a recreation of the universe: logos dividing itself until we have cosmos. Thus the short story and the long story can be seen as states in the creation of a hypothetical epic, analogous to the shape of literature as a 4"Lunatics, Lovers, and a Poet: A Study of Doubling and the Doppelgänger in the Novels of Nabokov," Diss.

When the tem poral, spatial, and moral planes are relatively undifferentiated, we have the kind of unity that is reducible to a statement of theme. Thus the short story is characterized in plot, setting, and character by a kind of rotundity, a com pressed form which could be visualized as a centripetal arc with a metaphor at its focus. As differentiation proceeds outward, the terms of the fiction become more discrete: it is at once more "real" and less numinous, less possessed of am biguity and multivalence but more convincing in its illusion, more like the world of everyday experience. This kind of verisimilitude is generally associated with the novel, but is also characteristic of romances such as Tolkien's Lord of the Rings which create a more obviously "rival" world. Something of this process of growth can be seen in a comparison between "Tyrants Destroyed" and Bend Sinister, which are in many ways typical of Nabokov's shorter and longer works. The similarities, to begin, are impressive. In both, the setting is a newly formed tyrannical state —a demonic world in which the tyrant, who is physically repulsive, is metaphorically identified with the nation which he rules: his style of writing infects the newspapers, clocks are set to his heartbeat. In both works the tyrant is personally opposed by the point-of view character —Adam Krug in Bend Sinister, the "I" in "Tyrants Destroyed" — both teachers who, we learn, had a quasi-sibling relationship with their future ruler as a child. The Hamlet motif is pervasive in both plots, which move in evitably toward the death or destruction of the protagonist. In general shape the two works resemble each other from beginning to end: the structure of both is that of the nightmare. In both plots the climax involves a loss of reason, which is really an awakening from the dream. There are many similarities in details as well: both works have seventeen major divisions; in both works the tyrant is squat and bald; the palace in both cases is a converted prison; in both works the tyrant's voice blares intermittently from loud speakers. Because of these and other similarities it is reasonable to view the shorter, earlier "Tyrants Destroyed" (19S8) as a prototype of the longer and later Bend Sinister (1947). Given the similarities, then, what are the differences between them? The answer, startling in its simplicity, may have far-ranging implications for the classification of Nabokov's fiction in general, for the primary difference is merely the degree to which the "world" of the work is particularized. I will demonstrate this remarkable fact by comparing the two works in terms of shared motifs. In Northrop Frye's terms, both of these works belong to the "descent" phase of romance, which is characterized by a loss of identity, the doppelgänger, the quest for wisdom, the vision of the absurd, and the discovery of identity in the body of the god who contains the universe.' These motifs are characteristic of the nether world—the setting of both works. In "Tyrants Destroyed" these five motifs are present in a highly compressed version. They are, in fact, implicit in 7These motifs are outlined in "The Bottomless Dream: Themes of Descent," in The Secular Scripture: A Study of the Structure of Romance (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1976), pp. 95-126. 510 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="4">the reciprocal relationship between the narrator and the tyrant. In Bend Sinister, on the other hand, the motifs are explicit, and the details of the nether world come more clearly into focus, as we shall see. Frye notes that the romance usually begins with a break in the continuity of identity, which has analogies to falling asleep and entering a dream world. In "Tyrants Destroyed" the break in identity occurs as the narrator assimilates the ruler's past by searching out his father and visiting his former abode until "by touching that dead furniture and looking at the neighboring roof through the window, I felt my hand closing on the key to his life."8 As the process continues, the dictator's past is gradually substituted, in part, for the narrator's own. But in Bend Sinister the break is sharper and more complete. Krug's world disinte grates with his wife's death. The breaking point is marked by a switch in the narrative voice from first to third person. The world of the novel is then reformed as a reflection (inverted, of course) in the spatulate-shaped rain puddle outside the hospital window, where (as Nabokov notes) the plot starts to breed. The puddle is the Fissure leading to the nether world into which, to use the Biblical metaphor, Adam Krug has fallen. The fact that the loss of identity is sharp, dramatic, detailed, and explicit is characteristic, I believe, of the way that generic motifs operate in the longer work. Frye notes that a second characteristic of romance is the double identity, the twin or doppelgänger motif: the hero together with his reflection or shadow. In "Tyrants Destroyed" this motif emerges gradually as the hero attempts to ex orcise the tyrant by duplicating the rhythm of his existence, "making it yield and come crashing down, like a suspension bridge whose own oscillations have coincided with the cadenced step of a detachment of soldiers crossing it."9 Thus, implicitly, the tyrant himself becomes the hero's double. In Bend Sinister, on the other hand (where as Nabokov tells us "everybody is merely an anagram of everybody else"), the hero and the tyrant appear to be discrete, but there are two Professor Krugs, and two sons: David and his anagram Arvid. Like the loss of identity, the doubling motif is more explicit and detailed in the longer work. A third motif which Frye sees as characteristic of romance is the quest for wisdom or knowledge, which, he says, is connected with the anxiety of death. In "Tyrants Destroyed" the knowledge sought is knowledge of how to kill the tyrant. The quest takes a bizarre turn when the narrator tells us, "suddenly I realized I had a way! ... By killing myself I would kill him, as he was totally in side me, fattened on the intensity of my hatred" (p. 33). The quest for knowl edge is much more fully developed in Bend Sinister: Adam Krug is an academic philosopher who speculates publicly about death; his speculations are included in the book. His final insight occurs, as one might predict, just when he is about to be killed —a point at which, in Nabokov's words, "he suddenly perceives the simple reality of things and knows but cannot express in the words of his world •Vladimir Nabokov, "Tyrants Destroyed," Tyrants Destroyed and Other Stories (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1975), p. 24.

This insight gives us the fourth of Frye's characteristic motifs, the vision of the absurd—a vision which also occurs at the climax of "Tyrants Destroyed" when, in the narrator's words, "I achieved those heights from which one obtains a bird's-eye view of the ludicrous" (p. 36). This climactic insight is more fully dramatized in the longer work. The final motif characteristic of the descent narrative, according to Frye, is the discovery of identity in the body of the god or gods who also contain the universe. The motif is more or less implicit in "Tyrants Destroyed," in which the narrator fades to a boneless shadow, "un fantôme sans os," while expressing the hope that "my chance labor may prove immortal, and may accompany the ages . . ." (p. 37). Here the narrator identifies himself with the body politic, which must serve in lieu of the body of a god. But in Bend Sinister the motif is much more explicit. In an analogy to the apocalypse, Krug, at the climax of the story, returns to meet his maker—the implied author of the work, whom Nabokov describes as "an anthropomorphic deity impersonated by me" (p. xii). The process of creation has come full circle. In summary, the descent motifs in "Tyrants Destroyed" are for the most part a function of the reciprocal relationship between the tyrant and the narra tor—an embryonic stage of fiction in which the characters are still identified with one another (as in the world of total metaphor) and are compressed by the first person point of view into the mind of a narrator. The descent motifs in Bend Sinister, on the other hand, are more explicit and more fully developed, characteristic of a more particularized version of the nether world. Here it is interesting to note that as the process of particularization continues the work loses its original unity and begins to expand outward, incorporating material that seems peripheral to the story. What, for example, does the discovery of cave paintings have to do with Krug and his conflict? Why is the first chapter full of enigmatic metaphors? Why is the ruler compared to a tracked beast? Why is cold tongue and cheek served for dinner? Why does Olga undress in front of a mirror? Though some of these incidents are inter-referential and thus form image patterns (which Nabokov calls "the wayside murmer of this or that hidden theme"), not all of these details, or for that matter hundreds of others, can be satisfactorily explained in terms of the work. They would certainly be ex cluded by a theory of art that insists on freedom from excrescence. But when we see them as modulations of Frye's descent motifs —the oracle, metamorphosis, the cannibal feast—then we understand that they are representative of the genre and thus reach out to a larger form: a manifestation of the mythological uni verse of which Bend Sinister is a part. This larger form is the universal epic, the "secular scripture" which, if Frye is right, parallels the Biblical one. Seen in archetypal terms, then, the story tends toward a broader significance. It is no longer merely about a professor of philosophy trapped in a tyrannical state; it is about Adam Krug (translated Adam "circle") who, like his Biblical namesake, sought knowledge and tasted death. Let us return to the distinctions between the novel, the short story, and the romance as they apply to Bend Sinister. Is it possible that this fantastic work could be considered a novel after all? Granted, we agree that the more pres 512 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="6">tigious genre is "realistic" and is distinguished by verisimilitude, but it should be remembered that verisimilitude is an illusion achieved in part by piling on par ticulars and details. Certainly Bend Sinister has this kind of novelistic use of detail. In addition, this work, like a novel, uses great chunks of material from real life —portions of the Soviet constitution, for example —and uses them to its own purposes.10 Perhaps the notions of "realism," "verisimilitude," and "credi bility" as they are used to distinguish between the novel and the romance are too limiting. If the primary difference between a short story and a novel is merely the degree to which the world of the work is particularized, then short story, romance, and novel share a common ground. DAN E. BURNS '•Nabokov felt is necessary to declare in the introduction that "The story in Bend Sinister is not really about life and death in a grotesque police state" and that "the influence of my epoch on my present book is as negligible as the influence of my books, or at least of this book, on my epoch" (p. vi).
