<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CRITIQUE OF PEIRCE'S IDEA OF GOD TO MANY it seems an inconsistency that Peirce, the exponent of exact reasoning, should have made a place in his philosophy for metaphysics and, perhaps still worse, for theology. Are the frequent references to God which occur in his writings to be taken seriously as indicating an integral part of his philosophy, or do they merely repre- sent his failure to carry his program through so far as religion was concerned? I wish to suggest that, while Peirce's treatment of the theological problem is, as it stands, consistent neither in itself nor with the rest of his philosophy, there is a way of revising it so as to make it internally consistent and integral to his system as a whole, or at least, to a good part of it. Peirce held, in his doctrine of Critical Commonsensism, that all our most fundamental and indubitable ideas are vague,~ and that the moment we undertake to "precide" them, to state them in definite terms, we are likely to misstate them, and fall into error and contradiction? In thorough consistency with this he regarded the idea of God, which is clearly fundamental in intent at least, as necessarily vague, and was therefore suspicious of definite theologies. On the other hand he thought that atheists were in reality belying their own subconscious' belief through failure to distinguish between the vague content of this belief and the too definite propositions of whatever theology they were acquainted with? Peirce also suggested that such an idea as that of God is more emotional and practical than intellectual and theoretical. This might seem to place him with contemporary positivism. But there is an irreducible difference; for to say that we are aware of God chiefly by ,feeling and living our relation to Him, is not at all, according to Peirce's logic, to say that we are aware, in this relation, only of our own emotional state or our own practical affairs. It is not to say that the word "God" has subjective connotation but not objective connota- tion or denoration, but only to say that it connotes and denotes through emotion and practice. All ideas, according to pragmatism, mean through practice, through conceivable practical bearings, but an idea so basic as that of God can be given meaning only through outlines of ~ See the Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, Vols.

He is fond of stressing the predominance of the subconscious or dimly conscious in our experience, and views all science as the exploitation of basic animal instincts. Nor does the fact that an idea refers to value, as the idea of God clearly does-since, as Peirce says, to under- stand what God is and to adore Him are inseparable6-deprive the idea of objective reference. All ideas express value and purpose, according to pragmatism, but value has an objective as well as a subjective aspect. True, the three sciences of value, the normative studies of aesthetics, ethics, and logic, are sciences of mind, but not just of the human mind. Peirce insists that, as logic is the normative study, not of human reasoning but of reasoning, so aesthetics is the normative study not of human feeling but of feeling, and ethics the study of reflective action. In other words there is a general framework of mind which is no more peculiar to man than existence is peculiar to him, and indeed it is only through this generic element in thought that we can talk about being in general or the universe as that of which man is a mere special case or part.7 It is impossible to generalize beyond all meaning, to peel off the layers of signs and arrive at bare signiess existence. Signs are objectively there in the transhuman universe. The very reality of natural laws, or of real regularities or general trends, which are the objects of natural science, consists in the immanence of generals, which are signs, in events, quite apart from human thought, though not of course from all thought.8 The religious construction of the immanent, universal thought which constitutes the order of the universe is that it is the thought of God. How do we know that this construction is true? Not, Peirce contends, by a mere inference. To be knowable by induction, God would have to be expressible as a probability ratio, an affair of frequency, which is absurd. To be knowable as an explanatory hypothesis, He would have to be a contingent being, only so necessary as the facts to be explained. To be knowable by mere deduction, He would have to be purely formal in nature.

L. diate perception of God.9 Peirce might perhaps also have argued that God is the ground of order and connection in the world, hence the pre- supposition rather than the result of inference. In many passages Peirce denies that inference presupposes any ground of order or unity, but I am not sure that this is the whole story of his view on the matter. He certainly does say that to engage in science is implicitly to believe in God.10 In any case, it is clear that he believes the idea of God to have another origin than inference. "No", he concludes, "as to God, open your eyes-and your heart, which is also a perceptive organ-and you see Him.""' In spite of this, Peirce declares also that he has carefully examined thirteen arguments for God and found something valid in each of them, though he suggests that some of them are not capable of leading to the conception of God involved in religion.12 How can Peirce admit arguments for what he has shown cannot be based upon argument? I do not believe there is here an incurable inconsistency. God may be directly though obscurely known, and the hypothesis that this is the case may be used as a premiss from which deductions may be made about the fundamental structure of our experience and knowledge.'3 It will then appear whether the consequences agree with what we all admit to be true of experience and thought. Such reasoning is a way of clarifying already existent relations to objects, not a way of reach- ing new objects. It is one with the method of Peirce's phenomenology, which only makes clear what everyone inevitably knows with some degree of clearness. The most remarkable implication of Peirce's position that God is directly apprehended is that really He is a phe- nomenon; hence the almost complete silence concerning God which is a feature of Peirce's discussions of phenomenology14 is a strong indi- cation of an incompletely developed position. There is need for a con- sideration of the categories as applicable to an immediate datum which includes God, even though obscurely. That the notion of God is "anthropomorphic" Peirce does not deny.15 But he holds that if by anthropomorphism is meant the doctrine that there is always some analogy between ourselves and other things, then the only alternative is the invalid assumption of things-in-themselves which, being wholly different from our nature and experience, are consequently unknowable and strictly unthinkable.'6 The issue is be- tween a sufficiently critical anthropomorphism and uncritical ones, just as the issue is between critical and uncritical "common-sensisms".

Somewhat similarly, he was able to admit his own inability to make much of aesthetics, while at the same time admitting and emphasizing the fundamental place of this study in the system of knowledge. What he could not more than slightly understand he thought others might find much more perspicuous; and what the whole human race can at best but dimly grasp he thought might none the less be real and, to some mind, intelligible. This is a kind of objectivity of attitude which not all who speak of objectivity, or of scientific rigor, are able to attain. That the human inability to grasp the divine is relative not absolute Peirce was bound by his own logical principles to hold. And he says that the success of science shows that we catch a fragment of God's thought as constitutive of the structure of the universe. Yet there is something seriously amiss in Peirce's sketch of his theological position, granting that it is intended to be no more than the merest sketch, and granting that there are limits to the clearness we can attain in such matters. The trouble is that at times he virtually substi- tutes for the idea of God that of the simply unknowable, the intellect- ually completely unmanageable, and that at other times he makes his doctrine of the vagueness of ultimate ideas an excuse for relaxing crticism in regard to theological doctrines which are not particularly vague, though they may be selfcontradictory or erroneous. In other words, he oscillates between an untenable extreme of his own theory of vague ideas, and an uncritical acceptance of doctrines which profess to be precise, but which are not perhaps consistent with his own logical and cosmological principles. On the one hand, Peirce says that all discussion of the divine omni- science or omnipotence is mere "gabble".'8 He derides those who doubt the goodness of God because the universe does not please "some silly scold", or who speak as though Tom, Dick, or Harry could have any idea of what God ought to do.'9 On the other hand, he defines God as the Ens Necessarium,20deduces from this that He is disembodied spirit, and definitely and consistently denies that God "exists" if by that is meant, as in his terminology would be meant, that God interacts with other real things.2' Such a notion would be "fetichism", he re- marks. In short, we find ourselves confronted with the traditional notion of God as sheerly absolute, too exalted and necessary and in- 17 5.536. 18 6.509. 19 6.479.

It is true that this idea is essentially negative, but its negations are definite, not vague. And we have to ask whether anything in Peirce's philosophy justifies them. To say that God does not interact with other things is to say that He is not subject to Peirce's category of "secondness" or reaction. Is this compatible with the ultimacy claimed for the categories? More- over, Peirce insists that without secondness there can be no "firstness" or "thirdness", no quality or meaning or purpose, so that it is hard to see how the exemption of God from reaction could mean anything but the complete meaninglessness of the idea of God in terms of Peirce's system. Moreover, is such a purely negative conception of God in conformity with Peirce's defence of anthropomorphism? Give me, said Peirce, the natural anthropomorphic idea of the deity rather than the latest "patent absolute". But what is the Ens Necessarium (as tradi- tionally interpreted) but such a patent absolute? As for fetichism, does not high religion, with its notion, of which Peirce explicitly approves, that God is love,22 necessitate, no less than primitive ritual, an inter- action between God and His creatures by which He is made joyous by their joy and sorrowful by their suffering? But tolerance for the theological tradition gets Peirce into other difficulties. If there is no action upon God, if He is necessary in all His nature, "impassive", without accidents, to use the old terms, what can we make of Peirce's tychism, or the doctrine that existence is a vast assemblage of contingencies or accidents? How are these accidental features related to God? If they belong to Him, He has accidents; if not, then He is less than all of reality, so not absolute after all. This is a paradox of old standing, but that is no reason for Peirce to have burdened himself with it. And in fact he manifests embarrassment here. He actually suggests that perhaps no other world than just the real one, with all its arbitrary aspects, is so much as possible, if God is omnipotent.23 (Or else, he hints, the other possible worlds are all somehow actual.) In short we have Spinozism, the farthest from tychism it is possible to get. What is must be, what can be also in- evitably is. What God can create he does create. Otherwise He would not be absolute; for He would fail to do something which He is able to do, and therefore, since doing and being are inseparable, He would be less than He might be. (The traditional solution, other than this one, was to say that in God being is wholly independent of doing, so that God is all that He could be without doing all that He could do. His intrinsic potentiality was nil, while His extrinsic possibilities were inexhaustible-as though inventing such phrases gave assurance of meanings to correspond!) Seeing the difficulties of such notions, Peirce, in the same passage, throws up his hands and declares that all 22 6.157, 287. 23 6.509.</page><page sequence="6">No. 5.] DISCUSSION 52I discussion of these problems is gabble. Perhaps it is, assuming that God is in all respects the absolute, in all aspects complete and perfect. In the same context Peirce suggests, in effect, that God is not the absolute. Omniscience, he says, may not mean that God knows every- thing. "For this thought is creative."24 Elsewhere we find the sug- gestion that the cosmic teleology, the teleology of evolution, is itself an evolutionary affair, a developing teleology-a very clear anticipa- tion of Bergson.25 The implication of the two passages is that, as Tychism in any case seems to imply, the future is partially indetermin- ate so long as it is future, and therefore perfect knowledge, which knows all things as they are, will not know the future as a set of definite details-for the future is not such a set-but as a set of more or less indefinite potentialities which will through creative action (perhaps man's as well as God's) become some set of details or other, though there is no one such set which it is now destined to become. This too is an old doctrine, though not the main stream of the tradition. But if followed out it results in a definite alternative to the timeless absolute, in the idea of a being which, fetichism or no, genuinely inter- acts with other individuals, in short a really social deity, in an honest sense a God of love; and upon such an assumption Peirce's categories and cosmology of contingent, evolving realities, composed of socially interactive feelings, becomes relevant to theology. And this social theology is also anthropomorphic in the critical sense which, according to Peirce, is the only way of escaping both uncritical anthropo- morphism and the empty notion of an unknowable or thing in itself, bare of all analogy to ourselves and our experience. It is not even required, for such a conciliation, to drop the definition of God as the "necessary being", provided one guards against an ambiguity concealed in this definition, one of the most persistently overlooked and fatal of all double meanings. God may be necessary as to His existence, and as to some essential properties which identify Him as God, but He may also be subject to contingent properties or accidents. He may have an essence which exists necessarily and in absolute in- dependence of other things (and He may be the only being with such an essence), but how does this contradict the assumption that He has also accidental properties? From "some properties of God are necessary" to "all properties of God are necessary" there seems to be no logical path, and I believe it can be clearly shown that the two assertions are incompatible rather than essentially connected. There is a whole nest of ambiguities of this type in the traditional idea of the absolute.26 An advantage of the foregoing idea of God is that it can really 24 6.508. 25 6-I56f. 26 See my Beyond Humanism (Willett, Clark &amp; Co., I937), pp. I2-I5, 4I-44, 49-50; and my Man's Vision of God (Willett, Clark &amp; Co., i94i).</page><page sequence="7">522 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. L. make something of the requirement, which I believe Peirce was right in insisting upon, that God be no mere inference. For if God has a relative aspect He need not be purely transcendent of the space- time world. Peirce says that God is "not immanent in but creative of the world". But how then can He be immanent in our experience, directly apprehended ?27 If He is so immanent, in what guise? Now I shall merely suggest here that space-time itself, as something above the human individual, is directly given (even though not with the sharpness necessary to settle mathematical problems like that of the accuracy of Euclidian geometry), and that this superindividual unity of space-time, when reflectively clarified, turns out to be an aspect of what we should expect the unity of God to be like. For it is a medium of impartiality making possible the social interrelations of finite beings. The past, for instance, is felt to be fixed as a realm of objective fact, but in our individual experiences memory is not fixed. Again, the space we occupy contains others on the same terms. From these and other indications we see that the unity of space-time, which seems directly intuited, is not the unity of our individual ex- periences. It seems to fall between things, to belong to none of them. But it must belong to something. What could it belong to but an in- clusive life having the unique property of being able to take upon itself all the modes of thought and feeling and quality, and thus to interrelate them without, in this multiplicity, losing its own identity and coherence? This may be very obscure as I have briefly stated it, but space-time is inclusive and is an obvious fact, and it can hardly be obvious that it is not an aspect of deity, provided we are not com- pelled to regard deity as entirely above change and extension. And this, I have suggested, we are by no means compelled to do.28 27 For a clear statement of such direct apprehension, see 6.i62. 28 There is perhaps some difficulty in reconciling the idea of God as spatio- temporal with Peirce's apparent attempt to derive space and time from an original chaos, "non-existent" but yet not nothing (i.489f., 6.i89ff.). But one may hold that every item of existence (except God or space-time as such) is derivative, and yet not regard space-time as so. To the infinite collection of past events, new members can from all infinity have been added. Going back in thought into the past, one must conceive a continual subtrac- tion of items from existence. Existence run through backwards in time con- tains less and less determinate form, and thus seems to be approaching chaos; but, if the number of elapsed events is infinite, chaos is always infinitely remote. The one idea of Peirce's that seems definitely incompatible with the position I have taken is his notion that the laws of nature are getting more and more absolute, so that spontaneity, on which he (agreeing, as in so many things, with Bergson) admits consciousness and value depend, is forever diminishing. Is it true that this idea is required by his explanation of the origin of law, as the tendency of habit-taking to increase? One might seek escape by holding that particular strands of law are formed in this way, as a man's habits are, but that an opposite tendency also exists, whereby monotony creates reaction, rebellion, leading to the destruction of habit, and the beginning of a new cycle of habit-taking. Peirce seemed almost un- aware of the existence of resistance to monotony, just as, in his doctrine that we are cells in the social organism and should renounce individuality in</page><page sequence="8">No. 5.] DISCUSSION 523 I close with a question. Why did Peirce, who was so little bound by tradition, fall a victim to the old absolutistic paradoxes? Why did he push his doctrine of vague ideas to an extreme in theology, as he did not in ethics, aesthetics, or metaphysics, which he held should strive for clarity, however imperfectly they might expect to succeed? His admiration for Royce, "our American Plato" as he called him-partly due to the fact that Royce was the one metaphysician of his time with a taste for mathematics and exact logic, and partly, I suppose, due to the polished finish of Royce's writing and system-making, contrasted to the rugged, disorganized style of Peirce's compositions-may have strengthened his traditionalism in theology. (This admiration was not destroyed by his perception that you "could drive a coach and four" through some of Royce's arguments!) But perhaps the main reason for his conservatism and confusion in theology was simply his pre- occupation with other matters, particularly natural science and logic. We must remember too that the tradition toward which he inclined with more tolerance than his principles justify had enjoyed an almost undisputed reign for a thousand years and more, and that most serious attacks upon it date since the time when Peirce reached his mature convictions. Of course there had been atheists and skeptics, and squabbles within theism, but what had scarcely occurred was any vigor- ous attempt to explore the possibilities of a theology which should take contingency and interaction and "love" seriously enough to apply them to God, by distinguishing between an essence and accidents (the latter partially passive to, or in reaction with, other things) in the divine nature. If Peirce had been a pioneer here, in addition to all his other prophetic innovations, so largely confirmed by twentieth- century trends, he would have been great indeed. But he is great enough as he is, all the more since not only did he himself throw out a clear hint as to the type of theology that might escape the paradoxes of the absolute, but his entire system seems almost as though designed to support such a non-absolutistic theism.29 CHARLES HARTSHORNE THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO</page></plain_text>
