<plain_text><page sequence="1">yeannine Auboyer, Arts et Styles de l'Inde. Librai- rie Larousse, Paris, 1951, pp. 171, PIs. 48. This compact and, at times crowded, summary of the arts and crafts of India does justice to the wealth of objects preserved and leaves out of account those which have perished. This leads to a strangely foreshortened perspective of the historical context. It is said on p. 128, for example, that the temples (after iooo A.D.) having a curvilinear roof seem to be directly connected with a prototype of the VIth-VIIth century, the Temple of Laksmana at Sirpur. The Mallikarjuna Temple at Pattadakal, referred to in the same context does not belong to this type at all. The book is divided into two main parts. The first leads from pre-history to the year 1ooo; the second part covers the present millennium. The first part assesses with greater balance than the all too short second part the phases and schools of all the visual arts. The "minor arts" throughout the book are treated judiciously and attention is paid to the technical processes, particularly of painting. Each chapter is preceded by a historical resume and a sketch of the religious evolution of the respective periods. An appreciative introduction gives an excellent summary of the geographical data of India and endeavors to convey the "laws of Indianness" and their "repercussions in art and aesthetics". The book is part of a series, "Arts, styles and techni- ques", and has been written with up to date know- ledge of the vast factual and theoretical findings of Indology. Stella Kramrisch Mukul Dey, My Pilgrimages to Ajanta and Bagh, 2ndEdition. Oxford University Press, London, I950. This unpretentious book appeared first in 1925, eloquently prefaced by the late Laurence Binyon. The second edition is a welcome addition to the literature on Indian art, because this enthusiast who approaches monuments without scientific luggage serves the neophyte well and may lead him to a better understanding of early Indian painting. Mukal Dey writes first and foremost as a painter, then as a nationalist who, in difference to others, has no axe to grind. His descriptions and classifications of the Ajanta caves can be used as handy references by students who do not want to consult the learned compendia written on the subject. For this purpose, the second edition offers a considerably increased number of illustrations. The general text has still some shortcomings. The short chapter dealing with the life of the Buddha seems to be based on some unidentified sources which differ from the story as it is commonly told in Indian relief-sculpture and painting. The author's endeavor to bring his volume up to date led to an unforgivable error, because he assigns the pre- historic civilizations of Amri and Harappa to 6000 to 5000 B. C., and, worse still, calls them "Indo- Aryan" (p. i 6). Equally unfounded is the re- moval of Kalidasa from the Gupta period to the II century B. C. (same page). Under the circumstances, Dey's book should not be used without one of the reliable surveys at hand. Alfred Salmony T. G. Aravamuthan, Ganesa: Clue to a Cult and a Culture, 25 pp. numbered I to 25 (offprint from the yournal of Oriental Research, Vol. XVIII, Pari IV, pp. 221-245), Mylapore, Madras, 195o. Rejecting the evolutionary prejudices of Western scholarship and therewith the "anthropological" (as he terms them) hypotheses that have sought to derive Ganeta from primitive, non-Vedic Indian traditions - e. g., as a yaksa (Coomaraswamy, 293</page><page sequence="2">Yaksas I, p. 7 and II, p. 4), or as a totemic or agrarian god (Foucher, in Getty, Ganesa, pp. xxi- xxii)-Mr. Aravamuthan has contrived, with con- siderable imagination, a case for an exclusively Vedic provenience of the elephant-headed Lord of Obstacles. Having searched the Vedas (largely by the way of Macdonell's Vedic Mythology) for the earliest evi- dences, not of an animal-headed or of an elephant god, but of the concept of a divine being who interposes and removes obstacles and is likewise a lord of wisdom and leader of hosts, Mr. Arava- muthan suggests that there must have taken place "an assimilation of features of the Maruts and of Brhaspati" (p. 9) at a time "when the literature of the Rg-Vedic milieu was still in the process of active growth" (p. 17). "Through the tendency, characteristic of the Rg-Vedic age, to compare the gods to animals," he continues, "this god, anthropo- morphic at this stage, was apparently coming to be thought of also as an elephant, in recognition of similarities fancied to subsist between the gods of whom he was made and the animal. This se- condary fancy of an animal-god on all fours appears to have again given place, in course of time, to the primary fancy of the god in the erect form, in answer to the imperative preference for an anthropomorphic over a theriomorphic god" (pp. 20-21). The pot-belly of the upright elephant, finally, conduced to yaksa assimilations. No concrete evidence is presented, however, to illustrate the course of this development. "Not unless we are willing to allow," writes Mr. Arava- muthan (pp. I8-20), "for developments for which there can be no testimony in the material remains which have survived to us may we hope to progress in the elucidation of the transformations of Rg-Ve- dic ideas in later times." One cannot quarrel with Mr. Aravamuthan's pro- posal to give primary consideration rather to the history of the concept that informs a deity than to the comparison of his shape with similar shapes in different cultural contexts, serving differing functions. Nor is the tentative positing of the coalescence of a number of Vedic gods too bold a step for careful scholarship. Certainly, however, when a bridge of fancy is all that leads from this hypothetical Vedic god through a millennium of time to the first concrete evidences of Ganesa, many will feel less certain than the fashioner of the bridge that the problem has been solved. Mr. Ara- vamuthan appears to have begged the question. 7oseph Campbell Verrier Elwin: The Tribal Art of Middle India, A Personal Record, Oxford University Press, i95i. 21z pp. 30s. To the valuable publications of Verrier Elwin on the hill peoples of Middle India this attractively il- lustrated and composed little book supplies, for the layman, an inviting introduction, and, for the specialist, a delightful supplement. Two hundred and twenty-nine photographs and line drawings il- lustrating the folk arts of the Gonds, Baigas, Agarias, Marias, Murias, Bondos, Saoras, Gadabas, etc., of the Central Provinces, Orissa, and Bihar have been elucidated by a terse, sensitive, gently humorous text. Dr. Elwin's personal devotion to the people in whose squalid villages he has dwelt for two decades and his intelligent respect and care for their hu- manity have given to this book, as to all his writings, a vitality and profundity, as well as seasoned knowledge, unusual in the scriptures of anthropo- logy. He is extraordinarily sensitive, moreover, to the aesthetic qualities of the precious evidences he 294</page></plain_text>
