<plain_text><page sequence="1">In the Light of Surrealism by Georges Hugnet When the word Surrealism no longer ap- peared in quotation marks in critical and theoretical writings, the meaning of the term was established: it had acquired a direction and a will of its own. Surrealism springs from the marvellous, and it has always existed. As the earth dreams its dreams of stone, so man from the very first has taken refuge in dreams as in a magic rock around which life, the elements and the stars revolve. Now and again in the course of time voices have spoken in ac- cents which we do not hesitate to call Surrealist, giving unexpected expression to a reality only vaguely understood yet as dizzily evident as a blazing meteor. Per- petually, beyond the limits of time, a force exists which pervades the realm of the ra- tional and of the irrational: at times it con- sents to put in a ghostly appearance. Of these haunting flashes I cannot make an in- ventory nor yet can I trap them into the cramped cage of the possible. In this brief essay on Surrealist painting I shall mention dates, places, facts, atti- tudes and works in an effort to determine historically within our peculiarly marvel- lous and desolate epoch, the times and cir- cumstances in which certain men, dissatis- fied with life and reality, watched for the crack in the wall, for the loose bar in the prison window, and so made Surrealism conscious of itself. Thanks to its persistent exploration of the mind, of the sources of thought, of inspiration and of the inex- pressible, it became a working system for acquiring knowledge, it undertook the re- discovery and the recreation of the world of reality. The first theoretical foundations were laid in 1924 by the First Surrealist Mani- festo.t After describing the confusion and crises which followed in the steps of the War, the author, Andre Breton, recounts his personal experiences and the predica- ments of those in whose name he speaks; then, after tracing the initial stages of the Surrealist activity, he sums up its aims in definitions suitable for an encyclopaedia; he uses this device in order to be precise and impressive; he does not mean, how- ever, to lay down ironbound formulae, recipes for poetry for practical oper- ations in the manner of L'Archidoxe Magique of Paracelsus. Breton then inves- tigates the origins of poetry in the works and in the lives of those who sought to escape reality by adventure or by the crea- tion of a special setting. He explains in what and why certain men were or are Surrealist. But, as the Surrealist quality or attitude is not always complete, he qual- ifies: "I insist, they were not always Sur- realist for I can distinguish in them a cer- tain number of preconceived ideas to which - naively enough - they were at- tached. They were attached to them be- cause they had not heard the Surrealist voice, the voice that goes on preaching till the very eve of death and above the howl of the storm, because they did not want to be used in the orchestration of the marvel- lous score. They were too proud and that is why they have not always given forth a harmonious sound." Breton, after the levelling action of an- archical Dada, proposes to declare alle- giance to folly, to dreams, to the absurd, to the incoherent, to the hyperbolic-in a word- to all that is contrary to the general appearance of reality. Is not Surrealism within everyone's reach? The vast maps of 19</page><page sequence="2">dreams and of desires still hang on every wall. Who has not suddenly heard-per- haps just for a second-the imperious voice calling from behind the threshold of mem- ory? Convinced from the start that "litera- ture is a sad road that leads anywhere (i tout)," Breton wishes only to let himself go to unbridled imagination. The more this contradicts all known trends of thought, the better. He attacks "the hatred of the marvellous wherever it rages." He declares that the "marvellous is always beautiful, in fact only the marvellous is beautiful." He puts at the disposal of those who would venture into the realm of the marvellous not only poetic arguments, but the means to investigate modern thought and, above all, the new and decisive interpretation of psychoanalysis. During the course of Sur- realist development, outside all forms of idealism, outside the opiates of religion, the marvellous comes to light within reality. It comes to light in dreams, obses- sions, preoccupations, in sleep, fear, love, chance; in hallucinations, pretended dis- orders, follies, ghostly apparitions, escape nechanisms and evasions; in fancies, idle wanderings, poetry, the supernatural and the unusual; in empiricism, in super- reality. This element of the marvellous, elegated for so long to legends and chil- dren's fairy tales, reveals now in a true light, in a Surrealist light, the immanent reality and our relations to it. Surrealism has never doubted its power to "resolve the heretofore contradictory conditions of dream and of reality into an absolute re- ality, a super-reality." Surrealism will per- sist in forwarding and consolidating the identification of contraries which every modern discovery proves to be possible and true. The graph which would trace through the course of time the attraction of irreconcilables would be the history of Surrealism. Surrealism lowers its barriers against those who consider it impossible to verify reality. 2 In the case of Surrealism even more than in the case of Dada it is difficult to separate the experiments and the activities of the painters from those of the writers, for Surrealism is a mental attitude and a meth- od of investigation; its action runs parallel in every field; time has proved valid the behaviour that it has established for itself. Surrealism raises its voice in the name of man, in the name of poetry, in the name of an entire system of creation. In every field of endeavour the preoccupations are the same, be they formal or moral. Their ex- terior manifestations are analogous in character, their spirit sheds the same light and the same shadow. Exhibitions, experi- ments, works of theory and poetry merge, justify each other and are mutually exalt- ing. To Surrealism, its relations with itself and its time are more important than its relations with individuals. Dada gave back to current ideas their original vigor: Surrealism, under the im- pulse of Andre Breton, is dedicated to a r evision of values. It picks up the lost thread from the immediate past. Painting, considered from a new angle, undergoes a metamorphosis. Certain painters known heretofore only because sensational or orig- inal are esteemed by Surrealism not for these qualities but because they seem to unveil wished for worlds, to propose ex- citing questions. Subversiveness itself is charged now with a deeper meaning. Seurat seems Surrealist to Breton in his choice of motifs and Picasso in his Cubism. Cubist estheticism is condemned but its denial of reality, in favor of a superior reality, is counted in its favor. Certain ob- 20</page><page sequence="3">jects composed by Picasso in 1913 and 1914 take on considerable importance: seen in a Surrealist light, they shed a strange radi- ance. Some intentions, experiments, meth- ods and achievements are registered, others are deliberately rejected. Some names fall, others spring up, and still others are born again (cf. Cubism and Abstract Art, plates 98, 99). In 1933 Max Ernst writes: "The investi- gations into the mechanism of inspiration which have been ardently pursued by the Surrealists, lead them to the discovery of certain techniques, poetic in essence, and devised to remove the work of art from the sway of the so-called conscious faculties. These techniques, which cast a spell over reason, over taste and the conscious will, have made possible a vigorous application of Surrealist principles to drawing, to painting and even, to an extent, to photog- raphy. These processes, some of which, especially collage, were employed before the advent of Surrealism, are now modi- fied and systematized by Surrealism, mak- ing it possible for certain men to represent on paper or on canvas the dumbfounding photograph of their thoughts and of their desires." And Paul Eluard in 1936 says: "It is only when objects become compli- cated that they become possible to de- scribe. Picasso contrived to paint the sim- plest objects in such a way that everyone again became, not only able, but eager to describe them. For the artist as for the most uncultivated man, there are neither concrete forms nor abstract forms. There is only a communication between what sees and what is seen-an effort to understand, an establishment of relationship, almost a determination, a creation. To see is to understand, to judge, to deform, to imag- ine, to forget or forget oneself, to be or to disappear." 3 Together with the well known names of Picasso, de Chirico and Max Ernst, we find in the first number of La Revolution Sur- realiste E a new name: Andre Masson. This painter who had not belonged to any move- ment comes to Surrealism with a series of painting and drawings which he had ex- hibited some months earlier at the Galerie Simon, 1924. Devoid of any investigation of materials, having no plastic preoccupa- tion except that of a sort of chemistry of lines, the work of Masson at this time out- lines the new frontiers of a poetic world of very pure similes: landscapes take on strange human forms, ghosts peep behind transparent vaults, doves live like little girls, daggers like men, under broken cap- itals which miraculously take flight. Hands enliven still-lifes, objects take on a special life beyond the control of the fascinated eye (cf. Masson, Nos. 413, *414, 415, *416, 417-*421, *423). Nearly at the same time another aspect of the human universe, of the Surrealist universe, is revealed by a painter from Catalonia: Joan Miro. At first Miro had been satisfied with reproducing as well as possible a world enlivened by his fancy. Then, faces, houses, gardens, objects-the superfluous, in a word-gave way to a fan- tastic, naive, vibrant reality, to passion, to humor, to a luxurious vegetation issuing from the most unbridled dreams and from the most absolute manual spontaneity. These irrevocable paintings, composed without metaphor, were exhibited in 1925, under the aegis of the Surrealist group and with a preface by Benjamin Peret (cf. Miro, Nos. *430, 431-33, *434). The second number of La Revolution Surrealiste t described French art as a scarecrow, and arbitrarily separated paint- 21</page><page sequence="4">ing from art in order to tie it up with au- tomatism, with dreams, and revelations. Along with the reproductions of paintings, we find strange photographs, curious docu- ments, mediums' drawings, and drawings by poets accompanied by transcriptions of dreams and automatic texts. The Surrealist atmosphere becomes so explicit that it needs no explanation. Andre Breton and Robert Desnos collab- orate on the preface t to the first Surrealist exhibition in November 1925. It includes Arp, de Chirico, Ernst, Klee, Masson, Miro, Picasso, Man Ray, Pierre Roy. Poems by Eluard, Desnos and Peret serve as an ac- companiment to Ernst's one man show of recent canvasses which depict admirable forests enlivened by the most beautiful Surrealist images. The Surrealist gallery is opened and shows works of Arp, Braque, de Chirico, Duchamp, Ernst, Klee, Mal- kine, Masson, Miro, Picabia, Picasso, Man Ray, Tanguy (cf. Arp, Nos. *276, 274; Ernst, Nos. 354, *355, 356-359; Masson, No. ... . . . .. . ... . . *~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .. ...... . .. . .. :. ... ........ ....: A.... relief in. painted . n ad. .pi.... b. y .. .. ... -.,... . i i - .... ;........ ............ ..... ii_;;...................; ...Xt, i _t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...... . .. .....

Let us repeat that Surrealism makes its own certain attempts, certain behaviours, certain attitudes while it rejects others. It exalts what strengthens it, it keeps what helps it, it eliminates what diminishes it. It claims the marvellous liberating power of Picasso, Duchamp, Picabia, Arp, Ernst, Man Ray. Its researches and interpreta- tions establish their stand on a foundation of humor, subversiveness and dreams; in the evasion of all that is conventional. Surrealism lives in de Chirico's cities and in his superb dislocations, but his more recent works, academic in style, dishonor the author of the Disquieting muses. A pamphlet in the form of a preface per- emptorily puts an end to the whole ques- tion and one of his pictures appears crossed out in La Revolution Surrealiste (cf. de Chirico, Nos. *190-*215). The Surrealist Gallery keeps abreast of all the Surrealist activities: it shows not only pictures but books, illustrated publi- cations, manuscripts, documents and ob- jects. Together with an exhibition of prim- itive objects, amongst them some admir- able masks from New Mecklenburg, is held an exhibition of paintings by Man Ray. Their very particular poetry consists in technical inventions and in unprecedented images of reality and unreality mysteri- ously precise like mathematical magic. Shortly afterward, Yves Tanguy presents his first paintings, which are Surrealist daylight itself. For the past ten years, Tan- guy, lyrically inspired, has described in one picture after another an immense and troubling panorama, a unique universe, complete, resembling only itself, where nothing can be recognized in anything, where one can see everything and nothing, 22</page><page sequence="5">dead cities and cities coming into being, marble ruins, dream ant-hills, where the laws of gravity are but a game and the horizon only an ultimate concession. Be- tween the technical discoveries of a Max Ernst and the extreme manual freedom of a Miro whose automatism is in both cases peremptory, Tanguy paints without make- up and without premeditation but with the meticulousness of a coral. In the course of a questionnaire concerning painting, Tanguy declares: "I expect nothing from reflection but I am sure of my reflexes." The painting of Tanguy withstands all tests. Before the blank canvas, dream and instinct direct his hand. A spot is born, an object appears, it propagates, it evolves. A strange landscape fills the desert to which a splendid clarity gives depth. For his first exhibition Breton wrote the preface (cf. Tanguy, Nos. *498-*509). 4 During the same period, Pierre Roy was showing, with a prefacet by Aragon, his paintings whose elements were hardly less removed from their natural sphere than those of de Chirico. Among the Surrealist publications of this year, the most impor- tant after the astonishing RWp&amp;titionst of Eluard, decorated with collages by Max Ernst, was the Dormir, dormir dans les pierres,t by PWret, illustrated by Tanguy, and Eluard's Defense de savoir,t with a frontispiece by de Chirico. The Surrealist Gallery was exhibiting pictures by Mal- kine. Several shows by Ernst were held (cf. Roy, Nos. *474, *475). Breton presented Surrealist pictorial ac- tivity in his Le Surrealisme et la peinture.t In this he went back to essentials, he tracked down intentions. He expressed ad- miration for the works of certain painters who, working under various labels and us- ing various technical means, had liberated painting from its previously puny role. Reopening the question of what is real, he singled out those who had touched true reality, those who had gone to the heart of the subject, to the core of the great trees of the forest of the marvellous. In empha- sizing what touched him and exalted him in the work of these painters, he expressed a renewed hope for painting. "The narrow concept of imitation as the goal of art is at the source of the serious misunderstand- ing which we see perpetuated even in our own time. Basing their work on the belief that man is capable only of reproducing more or less happily the superficial image of that which moves him, painters have shown themselves much too conventional in the choice of their subjects. Their mis- take was to suppose that the subject could be taken only from the external world, whereas it should not be taken from the external world at all. It is true that human sensibility can give to the most ordinary object an unexpected distinction; but the magic power of the imagination is put to very feeble use indeed if it serves merely to preserve or reinforce that which already exists. That is an inexcusable abdication. It is impossible, in the present state of modern thought, when the exterior world appears more and more suspect, to agree any longer to such a sacrifice. The work of art, if it is to assist in that absolute revi- sion of values, upon which we all agree, must base itself upon a purely subjective inspiration or it will cease to exist." At the same time in which he states the current situation of Surrealism in its plas- tic activities, Andre Breton, with that clair- voyance and extraordinary lucidity which distinguishes him, defines Surrealist paint- ing by indicating its goal, by revealing its magic power, by discovering the problems 23</page><page sequence="6">which face it. In this connection Le Sur- realisme et la peinturet is a book of capi- tal importance. As in the case of all Sur- realist activities, painting becomes a doc- ument in which man is revealed to him- self, in which he sets up a hypothesis which serves as a basis for all possible in- ductions. In painting, as in the poem and the image, man ought to offer the key of the secret lock in order to find again the peace which is lacking in the perpetual clock. 5 Certain technical processes: the use of ele- ments foreign to painting, mechanical drawings, collages, and other experiments were, as we have seen, intended only to get painting out of its rut or, under the impulsion of Dada, to destroy ideas of beauty, of quality, of purity, to exalt dis- order, to deny at all costs. Systematized, directed, exploited by Surrealism, these processes no longer lead to destruction but become methods of investigation. The written Surrealist games: questions and answers, sentences written by a group transposed into drawings lead to the crea- tion of curious figures: "exquisite corpses." The process of collage, introduced or in any case used in a special fashion for the first time by Max Ernst, is in this connec- tion very instructive. To this process Max Ernst has added another, frottage or rub- bing, by which he reveals with infinite variety the otherwise invisible secrets of objects. When Surrealism interrogates chance, it is to obtain oracular replies (cf. Ernst, Nos. 358, *360, 372). To the Cubist papiers colles, where a plastic preoccupation prevails, the Sur- realist collages add the supernatural spark of that anonymous and mechanical liberty which transports painting outside its own limits. The ready-made elements taken from life, still living: wall-paper, newspa- per, poster, cloth, marbleizing, graining, sand, string . . . delivered painting from its conventional ideal, and renewed the problem of reality, the miserable under- standing of truth. The public's reaction: "this is not painting," by itself proves the intense reality of the papier colle, the super-reality of collage. The transmuta- tion of materials, a guitar made of iron, of cloth ... emphasizes the reality of the ob- ject (cf. Picasso, No. *251; Ernst, Nos. *330, *341, *343; also Cubism and Ab- stract Art: Picasso, plates 65, 67; Braque. plate 64; Gris, plate 66). Tristan Tzara has written very justly: "A form plucked from a newspaper and introduced in a drawing or picture incor- porates a morsel of everyday reality into another reality constructed by the spirit. The contrast between materials which the eye is capable of transposing almost into a tactile sensation, gives a new dimension to the picture in which the object's weight, set down with mathematical precision by symbols, volume and density, its very taste on the tongue, its consistency brings before us a unique reality in a world created by the force of the spirit and the dream." The Surrealist collage and particularly the ad- mirably captioned collages of Max Ernst (La Femme 100 tvtes,t 1929; Reve d'une petite fille qui voulut entrer au Carmel,t 1930; Une semaine de bonte,t 1934) are the fruit of imagination, of inspiration freed from caution, transforming the spirit into matter and putting itself within the reach of all. The incorporation in a picture of an element foreign to painting concili- ates the irreconcilable. It is from this re- solved contradiction that art dies: just as it dies in the works of lunatics when they tyrannically identify objective ap- 24</page><page sequence="7">pearances and oneiric delirium. To this identification Surrealism contributes a freedom of experiment and of rationaliza- tion, a transition from the unconscious to the conscious, a will to analysis, which creates a marvellous world at once poetic and critical. "The painter," says Louis Aragon in La Peinture au defi,t "if he should still be called painter, is no longer tied to his picture by a mysterious physical relationship as if he had given birth to it. With the breakdown of this conception the individuality of choice comes into play. A manufactured object can be set into a picture, in fact it can even be the whole picture. Picabia may decide that an elec- tric light is a young girl. Painters are now using objects as if they were words. Incan- tation has been invented again by the new magicians." This individuality of choice is as personal and distinctive in each painter as the selection of words and the reappear- ance of certain images is in each poet; chance, unconsciousness and automatism do not destroy these personal predilec- tions. In hallucination, reiterated cliches, reiterated expressions, betray the man and it is this betrayal that Surrealism requires (cf. Ernst, No. * 362, Nos. * 330, *341). 6 As the Surrealist universe becomes visible, as the Surrealist spirit and behaviour be- come more sharply defined, a kind of Sur- realist beauty comes into being. Andre Breton in 1928 concludes his book Nadjat with this decisive phrase: "Beauty will be convulsive or will not be." Convulsive beauty can be born only from the Surreal- ist image, from the automatic image by which the imagination itself is stunned. Lautreamont who announced: "The new shivers in the intellectual atmosphere" prophesied this implacable beauty in his simile: "beautiful as the trembling of hands in inebriation," and in this other simile in which the excitement of disloca- tion is wonderfully rendered: "Beautiful as the chance encounter of a sewing ma- chine and an umbrella on a dissecting ta- ble." This unexpected, arbitrary beauty, these dumbfounding juxtapositions are the very voice of Surrealism. From such images, tyrannically unforgettable, springs all that is unhoped for, all that is admir- able in its jagged, lightning-torn contours. I am thinking of some of Breton's and Eluard's incomparable images, identifica- tions which remain indelible. In the visual field it is de Chirico who revealed such juxtapositions to us and introduced into Surrealist painting a whole range of pos- sibilities. De Chirico created a tradition in which many imaginations developed. I al- lude especially to a painter who first makes his appearance in Surrealism in 1929 - Rene Magritte. He contributes poetic im- ages quite personal to himself, painted most tangibly and emanating a strange fas- cination. His paintings are an unbroken series of concrete object lessons which re- quire no technical commentary. Their as- tonished reality seems more convincing than the reality of a photograph (cf. Ma- gritte, Nos. *409-*412). At the same moment as Breton in his Second Surrealist Manifestot proceeds to- wards an evaluation of the Surrealist spirit, a new painter assumes a role of capital importance. The poetic, pictorial and crit- ical contributions of Salvador Dali turned Surrealist research in a particular direc- tion and gave a strong impulse to experi- ments which had been approached till then only in the most tentative fashion. His work is like an immense carnivorous flower blooming in the Surrealist sun. Moved by the lyrical expression of certain 25</page><page sequence="8">works of Ernst and Tanguy rather than won over by their plastic processes, and carrying to its extreme conclusions certain statements of the First Manifesto,t he gives full rein to dreams and hallucinations which he represents in the most faithful and meticulous way. He asserts his taste for chroinolithographs, the most colored, the most complete, and the least accidental imitation of nature. He disdains all ex- periment with surfaces and all the famil- iar cliches of the painter's craft. He puts his "manner," his pictorial talent directly at the service of delirium. The trompe- l'oeil is his way out. He creates a fever- ish world in which roles are played by simulations, physical illnesses, nervous conditions, sexual phenomena, inhibitions. Without inconsistency his range extends froin collage to chromo, from ready-made objects to perfect illusions, from de Chirico and Picasso to Millet and Meissonier-and all by the method of paranoiac obsession. His experiments, though remarkably fruit- ful, could not be successfully vulgarized. His conception of the purpose of painting accounts for his anti-artistic tendency, his delight in double images, and his desire to make his paintings like "handmade snap- shots." His method of subjective criticism, his interpretation of the most familiar works of art as recurrent obsessions, his acceptance of every aberration both in his paintings and in his writings, and his re- spect for dreams in their integrity no mat- ter how contradictory, are all essential contributions to Surrealist documentation (cf. Dali, Nos. *310, *311, 312-*315, *320, *322). Dali is deeply interested in insanity, hys- teria, trance phenomena, every symptom of mania; it is not surprising therefore that in the field of art he should find that debilitated and debilitating style known in America as Art Nouveau particularly fascinating. Its architecture of dank and petrified hair, its sonnambulistic furniture of unmeasured flowers, are rich in irra- tional confusion like the fruit of a collec- tive hallucination-and excellent material for Surrealist interpretation. All that is neurotic is worthy of investigation. As El- uard says of certain fantastic postcards so popular in pre-war times: "Commissioned by the exploiters to amuse the exploited, they should not, however, be counted a popular art. They are, rather, the small change of art and of poetry: and this small change sometimes reveals ideas of gold." These various discoveries are in no way contradictory, in fact they accumulate to form the contemporary domain of the mar- vellous. Seen from the Surrealist view- point this is all perfectly consistent: the bizarre and the anti-artistic, accident and dream, automatic writing and delirium, critical interpretation and hallucinatory symbols, paintings and ordinary objects, poetry and everyday life. Here is a history of men's wishes, here are the grandiose dreams of the world traversed by invisible rays and magnetic lightnings. Little by little in these fathomless depths, penetrat- ed by the light of Surrealism, new strata of reality come into being (cf. Dali, No. *311; Guimard, Nos. *661-*663; Gaudi. Nos. *649, *653, *654 *657). 7 A new periodical is founded: Le Surreal- isme au Service de la Revolution.` It con- tinues to reproduce the work of artists and to give information as to their activities. Like Baargeld and Ernst in Cologne dur- ing the Dada period, the Surrealist paint- ers refuse to bow to the exigencies of poli- tics and to work for purposes of propa- ganda. Painting, like poetry, persists in 26</page><page sequence="9">Two strips from the Surrealist film, Emak Bakia, made by the American artist, Man Ray, in Paris, 1927. A print of this film was recently given by the artist to the Museum of Modern Art Film Library.</page><page sequence="10">its role of investigator into the immense undetermined region over which reason does not extend its protectorate. The prin- ciples of dialectical materialism are en- dorsed unconditionally by Surrealism, its attitude is revolutionary, but it wishes to cooperate in transforming the conditions of human life by its own methods. There are however some obviously sub- versive works that may be mentioned here. For instance the paintings of Clovis Trou- ille accepted by the Surrealist group, and L'Age d'or, a film by Dali and Bunuel which after a violent scandal was forbid- den by the French censors in 1930. Essen- tially Surrealist in image and plot, L'Age d'or was purposely savage in content, anti- religious, shocking and aggressive. This was in line with the program of Surrealism as continually proven by Surrealist mani- festos and protests as well as by the kind of poetry of which Peret is the most bril- liant master. The film, better than any other medium, can give life to the Surrealist image. Let us mention the extraordinary metamor- phoses of Man Ray's Etoile de Mern: and that admirable fragment of Surrealist life, Le chien andalou.t Already in 1922 Du- champ and Man Ray had attempted to translate into the language of the cinema their poetic and plastic preoccupations. Other films to be counted as Surrealist be- cause of their technique or because they conjure up exciting situations not unlike Surrealist collages are Man Ray's Emak Bakia:.: and La perle by H. d'Arches and G. Hugnet. a The publication of Surrealist books makes it possible for painters to accompany po- etic texts with drawings and etchings that do not need to follow any of the usual limitations of illustration. Max Ernst illus- trates works of Eluard, Tzara, Peret; Tan- guy, works of Eluard, Pret; Dali, works of Breton, Eluard, Hugnet; Miro, works of Tzara, P6ret, Hugnet; Picasso, works of Peret and Eluard; Giacometti, works of Breton and Crevel. Crevel writes Salvador Dali ou l'anti-obscurantisrme.t And, more recently, Albert Skira publishes forty-two etchings which Dali has made to illustrate Lautreamont's Les Chants de Maldoror. 9 Surrealism was already beginning to spread to other countries and important Surrealist movements had come into being in Jugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. With the publication of Le Surrealisme au Ser- vice de la Revolutiont in 1930, the move- ment becomes more widespread. In Bel- gium a group formed by Mesens, Nouge and Magritte keeps in close contact with Paris. Other groups form under the direc- tion of painters or poets: In Japan, Tiru Jamanaka, Shuzo Takiguchi, Toshio Doi, Junzaburo Nishiwaki; in Scandinavia. Bjerke-Petersen, Stellan Morner, Freddie, Erik Olson; in the Canary Islands, Oscar Dominguez, Domingo Lopes Torres, Pedro Garcia Cabrera, Eduardo Westherdhal; and recently in England, David Gascoyne, Herbert Read, Hugh Sykes Davis. In the United States an American periodical, transition,t has given space to Surrealist ac- tivity. Breton has given lectures in Prague, Brussels, Tenerife and London; Eluard in Prague, Barcelona, Madrid, Seville, Lon- don; Dali in Paris, Peret in Tenerife. Gen- eral exhibitions have been held in Prague, Brussels, Tenerife, London. In Paris there have been many exhibitions in which most of the Surrealist members were represent- ed. (For England: cf. Agar, No. *262; 28</page><page sequence="11">Banting, No. *299; Burra, No. *303; Hay- ter, No. *392; Mednikoff, No. 426; Moore, No. *445; Nash, No. 449; Pailthorpe, No. *457; Penrose, No. 458. For Belgium: cf. Mesens, No. *427; Magritte, Nos. *409- *412; Canary Islands: cf. Dominguez, Nos. *324, *326; Scandinavia: No. 514). The public has been kept in contact with the plastic activity of the movement. But I must make it clear that Surrealist painting should not be judged from an ar- tistic or plastic point of view; it may be conceded that a painter should be able to paint but nevertheless Surrealist painting must not be judged by artistic quality. No work can be, no work may be considered from this point of view. Surrealist objects which we are about to discuss are very im- portant but they are in no sense the result of an esthetic interest in representation. In 1931 the role of Le Surrealisme au Service de la Revolution is complemented by Minotauret and Cahiers d'Artt which publish special numbers on Surrealism. Beside the new paintings of Tanguy, Dali, Ernst, Magritte, there appear the marvellous sculpture-objects of Giaco- metti in wood, stone and plaster, settings of poetic precision, palaces of sleep where mysterious dramas are enacted at daggers drawn, games whose bizarre and lucid rules are derived from dreams. The mobile objects of Giacometti functioning like dream-machines from the landscapes of Ernst or Tanguy give a new impulse to the creation of Surrealist objects (cf. Giaco- metti, Nos. *377-*379). Valentine Hugo awakens in the ghosts of the past the legends of the day. The baffling paintings and drawings of Victor Brauner illustrate impossible adventures where imperturbable figures obey only the laws of obsession. Hans Bellmer succeeds in endowing his articulated doll with a fresh and amorous life steeped in an atmos- phere of wonder; his photographs of her reflect the complexities of his spirit, she undergoes metamorphoses, she dies, she gasps again the burning spark of love. His objects, his drawings reveal an unexpected anatomy haunted by an amorous life which identifies itself with poetry. In con- trast with Man Ray's recent photographs where the human element and poetic an- ecdote are apt to prevail, Dora Maar's pho- tographs are full of an unexpected eroti- cism combined with dislocations borrowed from collage. The works of Meret Oppen- heim lie on the margin between paintings and objects. Paalen and the Czechish painters Toyen and Styrsky reveal a re- search regulated by automatism and find in it a new realism. S. W. Hayter, Roland Penrose, Eileen Agar, Paul Nash organize amazing constructions where the world of dreams condemns the world of reality. The stories told by Marcel Jean's etchings (Mourir pour la patrie, 1935) distract rea- son into hallucination. Oscar Dominguez by trompe-l'oeil and Surrealist deforma- tion evokes infinitely varied flora and fauna. A truly magic process used by Do- minguez and many Surrealists is called by Breton "decalcomania with no precon- ceived object, decalcomania of chance" and puts within everyone's reach the mak- ings of the most exciting poetry (cf. Val- entine Hugo, Nos. *396-398; Brauner, No. 301; Maar, Nos. 404, 405; Paalen, Nos. 453-*455; Oppenheim, No. *452; Hayter, Nos. 384-*392; Penrose, No. 458; Agar, No. *262; Nash, No. 449; Jean, No. *401; Dominguez, Nos. *324, *326). We have mentioned various technical processes such as Ernst's collages and frot- tages (rubbings), Man Ray's experiments in photography, Dominguez' decalcoma- nias in which the work of chance can be 29</page><page sequence="12">observed under a microscope and auto- matism reveals the tangible trace of the marvellous hand. Parallel to these but in the field of writing are the automatic texts, the narrations of dreams, the "simu- lations" assembled by Breton and Eluard in L'Imntacul6e Conception,? one of the most exciting Surrealist books. 10 We still have to touch upon Surrealist ob- jects, the importance of which cannot be sufficiently emphasized. Nothing that the movement has produced is more authentic, more varied, more personal and at the same time so anonymous. They have real- ized Lautreamont's saying "poetry must be inade by all. Not by one." Related in ap- pearance to Dada sculpto-paintings Sur- realist objects are essentially different for they are the automatic, reasonless and yet material expression of inhibited wishes, anthropomorphic vegetations of the per- manently unpredictable in man. Made in secret, symbolical in their function, im- ages for the hand, they are among the most singular subjects for the study of psychoanalysis. "These objects, endowed with a minimum of mechanical function, are based on ghostly fancies and are rep- resentations provoked by unconscious acts. . . . The incarnation of these desires, the manner of their embodiment by metaphor, their symbolical realization constitute a process of erotic substitution which re- sembles at every point the process of po- etry. Objects whose function is symbolical followed upon silent objects such as Giaco- mietti's hanging sphere, an object which established all the essential principles of our definition but was still restricted to the medium of sculpture. Objects with sym- bolical function leave no loophole for for- nial preoccupations. Only amorous imagi- nation is responsible for them and they are extra-plastic." It is in these terms that Salvador Dali indicates the immense pos- sibilities of the object as the most sincere and disinterested outlet of interior activity. The absence in their creation of all plastic endeavour must be borne in mind. Sur- realist objects played a conspicuous part in an exhibition as early as 1933. Espe- cially important were the object-sculptures of Arp and Giacometti, Man Ray's objects made of everyday things, invented objects by Tanguy, poetic objects by Breton and Eluard. In June 1936 an exhibition of ex- clusively Surrealist objects was held in Paris in the Gallery of Charles Ratton (cf. Giacometti, Nos. *377-*379; Arp, Nos. *277, *283, *287; Ray, No. *476). The life and function of the Surrealist object is infinitely disquieting. One gets used to usual objects, one ceases to notice them, they become idle decoration. What a difference between the objects of our deaf and dumb civilization and the real objects, the primitive object for instance. Objects are beautiful when and because they express something. Duchamp gave back to everyday objects their power of expression by his "ready-mades" and quite recently by his roto-reliefs. Arp in 1924 devised the Planche am oeufs (egg-board) and how to use it. As Tanguy perfects the creatures who live in the translucid air of his canvasses, as Arp polishes his "objects to be lost" adorned with mustaches and mandolins, as new objects are put into cir- culation for new purposes, a new and in- creasingly complete mythology of desire comes into existence. But neither the paintings nor the objects have any intend- ed connection with art; they are only an attempt to establish super-reality (cf. Du- champ, Nos. *221, 224; Arp's "egg-board"' arrived too late for cataloging). 30</page><page sequence="13">An admirable realm is conjured up by the first objects of Picasso and Duchamp, the ghost object of Breton, the aphrodisiac dinner jacket of Dali, disquieting pan- oplies of Tanguy, the tortured realities of Miro, Ernst's totem poles struck by light- ning, and by the everyday objects in fur by Meret Oppenheim. The special num- ber of Cahiers d'Artt on Surrealist objects also included: mathematical objects, found objects, ready-made and ready-mades as- sisted, the cover itself an object, Les coeurs volants by Duchamp. They all reflect the universe that Surrealism has brought back to life (cf. Ernst, Nos. *369, 371; Oppen- heim, No. *452; Miro, No. *444; Tanguy, No. *510; mathematical objects, Nos. * 629-643; found object, No. * 624; ready- nade, No. *221; ready-made assisted, No. *224). Over the mathematical object and the found object, on the practical utility of which one can speculate indefinitely, there reigns the same certitude, the same en- igma; the rational and the irrational meet. Breton writes: "Applying Hegel's adage 'All that is real is rational, all that is ra- tional is real' the rational can be expected to coincide in every point with the course of the real and in truth contemporary rea- son wants nothing more than to assimi- late the irrational. The rational is there- fore forced to reorganize itself incessantly both to consolidate itself and to enrich it- self. In this sense one must admit that Surrealism is accompanied by a surration- alism that doubles and acts as a standard for it. The fact that M. Gaston Bachelard has recently inserted in the scientific dic- tionary the word surrationalism, which is supposed to indicate an entire method of thought, lends increased actuality and strictness to the word "Surrealism" which had hitherto been accepted only in a pure- ly artistic sense. One term verifies the other, both are evidence of the common, basic state of mind which motivates man's contemporary research, be he poet, painter or scholar." Breton goes on to say that in the "de- cisive words" of Paul Eluard the physics of poetry is being created. Borrowed from life the object comes back to life adorned with a formidable meaning. Instrument of experimentation, it inhabits the sumptu- ous laboratories of desire. The object's ex- ceptional function in releasing impulsions by reconstituting the accessories of dreams, makes it desirable that it should be sys- tematically exploited. Surrealist painting, Surrealist poetry blend together and some may find it amus- ing to characterize Surrealist painting as literary. Let them also amuse themselves characterizing poetry by the same method as that of a man who finds that butter has the same taste as hazelnuts. Andre Breton attempted to blend intimately writing and visual representation, poetry and chance in his poem-objects. In La septieme face du de (the 7th face of the die), I myself, by means of poemes-decoupages (cut-out poems), made like experiments by sup- pressing metaphor for the sole advantage of the image (collages and objects by Sur- realist poets: Breton, No. 302, Eluard, No. 326a, Jean, No. *401, Hugnet, No. 399). 11 The history of Surrealism offers subjects for meditation rather than picturesque in- cidents, it refuses to be classified among other "genres." What others attempted in order to avoid what has already been seen, Surrealism has undertaken in order to reach a conclusion. "Surrealism has been the only force which up to this has been able to extract from the darkroom the 31</page><page sequence="14">truly luminous and imposing forms. Sur- realism has never feared that it was going too far, it has never betrayed true im- pulses, it has never acted with tact, with circumspection. We know to what false- hoods all esthetic preoccupation can lead: 'beauty' and 'morals' and even to the point where the length of the beard would in- dicate the degree of intellect and of viril- ity." When Man Ray wrote this sentence he was expressing with insufficient empha- sis to what degree our epoch is indebted to Surrealist creations, both poetic and pictorial. Max Ernst speaks of Surrealist activity in these terms: "Surrealism, in turning topsy-turvy the appearances and relation- ships of 'realities' has been able to contrib- ute, with a smile on its lips, to the general crisis of conscience which must perforce take place in our time." I have attempted to give the feeling of this general crisis of conscience throughout this historical and critical essay on Surrealist painting. In Surrealism the work and the man are in- separable. Politically and poetically Sur- realism seeks man's liberation. What a work of art expresses formally is of no ini- portance-only its hidden content counts. Surrealism appeals to the imagination and fancy; it aims to take man out of himself; it proposes automatism in order to draw out of man the necessary light for his total emancipation. Surrealism restores to art its true meaning. Surrealism, not as an esthete, but as an investigator and experimenter has extend- ed its research into every field in an at- tempt to get to the bottom of things. There is no Surrealist art, there are only pro- posed nieans-and these proposed means may be only temporary. Surrealism wishes to reconcile what has been up to this ir- reconcilable, to utilize what has been un- DECEMBER 9, 1936 VOL. 4, Nos. 2-3 The Bulletin Published by The Museum of Modern Art 11 West 53 Street, New York Trustees A.

To plumb the mystery of man too many roads have been neglected. Man is what he has been made. It is important to re- veal to him that which hides him from himself. With Surrealism all poetic and pictorial manifestations are situated on the level of life and life on the level of dreams. In the night in which we live, in the carefully preserved obscurity which prevents man from rebelling, a beam from a lighthouse sweeps in a circular path over the human and extra-human horizon: it is the light of Surrealism. 32</page></plain_text>
