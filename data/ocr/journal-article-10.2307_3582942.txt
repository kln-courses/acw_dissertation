Aim: To investigate the development of blood pressure (BP) determinants over a period of 6 years in a birth cohort of middle-aged Swedish men. Methods: Men born 1953 and 1954 living in Helsingborg, Southern Sweden, were surveyed at 37, 40 and 43 years of age. Baseline participation rate was 68% (n = 991). S-Cholesterol, HDL-Cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and anthropomorphic measurements were collected and a questionnaire covering ethnicity, smoking, lei- sure time physical activity (LTPA) and alcohol con- sumption was completed. Results: At these surveys, SBP means were: 131, 132, 135 mm Hg and DBP were 83, 83 and 85 mm Hg respectively. Body mass index (BMI), waist hip ratio (WHR), S-Cholesterol and alcohol consumption consistently showed cross- sectional positive associations with SBP and DBP. One mmol/L higher S-Cholesterol at baseline pre- dicted an increase in SBP by 1.16 mm Hg (confidence interval, CI: 0.25; 2.07) over 6 years. At age 40, there was a 4.4 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.020) difference in SBP and a 2.64 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.056) difference in DBP means between the low and high alcohol consumption. Corresponding differences at age 43 were SBP 5.28 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.023) and DBP 5.4 mm Hg (p &lt; 0.000). Men born in Sweden had a higher baseline SBP (A = 4 mm Hg, CI: 2.11; 6.35) and showed a higher 6 year increase in SBP (2.80 mm Hg CI: 0.07; 5.53) than men born abroad. Conclusions: Body composition, ethnicity and alcohol consump- tion are strong determinants for the development of BP. These findings have to be considered in strategies for primary prevention of hypertension in younger middle-aged men. Key words: Body Mass Index, Ethnicity, Population study, S-Cholesterol Introduction Blood pressure (BP) is recognised as one of the strongest determinants of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [1]. The epidemiology of BP comprises secular trends and cohort trends [2-5] mediated by the ge- netic variability, behaviours, socio-economic factors and effect of primary and secondary prevention in- cluding different medical treatments [6-8]. In most western societies secular trends seem to be decreasing for BP, but increasing for some of its most well- known determinants such as BMI ahd WHR [3, 9]. The linear association between age and BP [1, 10] is predominant in western societies, especially in elderly people, but this association is weaker, or lacking, in developing countries [11]. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) is known to show geographic distribution axis across countries, as illustrated by the north-south and east- west differences in Europe [7, 12, 13]. Alcohol con- sumption is a well-known determinant of BP [14, 15], however, drinking behaviours, as well as quantity of different types of alcohol intake across differ- ent cultures, have a complex impact on BP levels [16-18]. The CRISS Study was designed to evaluate the impact of environmental, behavioural as well as of genetic variability for CVD risk factors in a cohort of middle-aged men aiming at early identification of subjects with an increased cardiovascular risk. In this study we investigated the determinants of BP deve- lopment over a 6-year period. Material and methods Subjects Two complete birth year cohorts of men born in 1953-1954 and residing in Helsingborg, Sweden, were invited at age 37 starting in 1990. Of those 1460 summoned 442 (30%) did not come, 27 (2%) were excluded, and 991 (68%) fulfilled the criteria for participation. The recruitment has been described in detail previously [19]. The same birth cohorts were invited for follow-up 3 and 6-years after</page><page sequence="2">956 inclusion. Of the 991 participants included at base- line, 770 (78%) were examined at 40 years of age and 702 (71%) at age 43, respectively. Methods A physical examination was performed, blood sam- ples were collected and a questionnaire covering so- cio-economic and behavioural factors that relate to cardiovascular risks was completed at each survey. All three examinations took place at the hospital in Helsingborg at the same time of year to avoid sea- sonal variance [20] and were performed by a nurse specially trained for this project. Systolic and dia- stolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP) were read to the nearest 2 mm Hg in a sitting position following at least 5 min rest. Weight was measured on the same calibrated electronic scale at all occasions (partici- pants in pants and no shoes). Height was measured to the nearest centimetre with a calibrated measuring- rod, the subject standing without shoes. Waist and hip circumferences were measured to the nearest centimetre at the leanest level between hip and rib, and the widest level between hip and buttock re- spectively. Waist hip ratio (WHR) was calculated by the formula waist (cm)/hip (cm), body mass index (BMI) was calculated by the formula weight (kg)/ height (m2). S-Cholesterol and HDL-Cholesterol were analysed using enzymatic methods, with reagents from Boeh- ringer (Germany) and calibrated using internation- ally recognised standards. Non-HDL-Cholesterol was calculated by subtracting HDL-Cholesterol from the S-Cholesterol value [21]. The questionnaire covered smoking habits and leisure time physical activity (LTPA) at all three visits. Questions on alcohol consumption were asked only at the last two surveys. The participants com- pleted the questionnaire themselves without supervi- sion by the staff. Information on ethnicity, length of education and employment status was also collected. Subjects who answered affirmative to the question if they smoked on a daily basis were defined as 'smokers'; those who answered no were defined as 'non-smokers'. Questions were asked about the duration, regu- larity and strenuousness of LTPAs for the past year and a LTPA score was calculated and dichotomised for these analyses. Men who had a sedentary lifestyle or those with some, but not very strenuous LTPA (walking for less than 4 hours a week) were categor- ised as sedentary (low LTPA score). Men who were more active, (i.e. swimming for at least 2 hours a week), were considered physically active (high LTPA score). BEH was an abbreviation used when both smoking and LTPA score were entered as covariates in the model. Alcohol consumption was estimated by an adjusted quantity-frequency method, which assessed the number of days of alcohol consumption of beer, wine and distilled spirits during the last 30 days [22]. Typical alcohol consumption per day was recorded for each beverage with questions on numbers of bottles or cans of beer, and glasses or bottles of wine and spirits. Respondents were also asked about the number of days with heavy drinking for each bever- age during the last 30 days. The number of days with heavy drinking was subtracted from the total number of days with alcohol consumption. Typical con- sumption was calculated for each beverage, by mul- tiplying the threshold value with number of days of heavy drinking. The total alcohol consumption in grams of alcohol per month was achieved by adding the sums together and then transformed into weekly consumption. Five groups of alcohol consuming pattern were identified. Abstainers were men who said they never drank any alcoholic beverage, low consumers were those who drank &gt;0 but 060 g/week, moderate consumers drank &gt;60 but &lt; 120 g/week, high con- sumers drank &gt;120 but (240 g/week, and heavy consumers were men with an alcohol consumption of more than 240 g/week. Subjects were divided into three categories by BMI score; normal (&lt;25 kg/m2, overweight &gt;25 but &lt; 30 kg/m2, and obesity &gt;30 kg/m2 [23].

To comply with other variables in Figure 1, al- cohol consumption was categorised in three levels (normal: &gt;0 but ( 120 g of alcohol/week, risk: &gt;120 but (&lt;240 g of alcohol/week, and high: &gt;240 g of alcohol/week. Ethnicity was covered by the question 'were you born in Sweden', with a yes or no alternative option. Men who answered that they were born abroad were asked for additional information on country of birth, and 131 (94%) of the men answered that question. Of these men 30 (21%) came from Nordic countries, 27 (19%) from Eastern Europe, 33 (24%) from Southern Europe and former Yugoslavia, 10 (7%) from Western Europe, 24 (17%) from Asia and 7 (5%) came from Africa and Latin America. Statistical methods Linear regression was used to explore associations between continuous variables and was expressed as the amount of the dependent variable, with 95% confidence intervals (CI), associated with I unit dif- ference in the independent variable. Independent t- test and analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used for comparison of means and in polynomial trend test in continuous variables. Logistic regression was used to explore associations between binary variables. WHR was calculated by waist (cm)/hip (cm), but for nu- merical reasons WHR 10-1 was used in these ana- lyses. Change over time was estimated by subtracting the baseline value from the value at 6 year follow-up. For alcohol consumption with a very skewed distri- bution, one unit was added to all values and the logarithm was used in analyses with alcohol as a continuous variable, thus the interpretation of effect should be per cent change. No correction coefficient for regression dilution bias was used in any of the analyses in this report, thus associations were probably higher. All tests were two-sided, and dif- ferences were considered statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05. Results BP means (SD) at baseline were 130.6 mm Hg (11.9) for SBP and 83.4 mm Hg (8.2) for DBP. Corre- sponding levels at follow-ups were SBP 131.5 mm Hg (12.2), 134.6 mm Hg (13.8) and DBP 82.5 mm Hg (8.9) and 85.3 mm Hg (9.09) respectively. Cross-sectional associations between BP and CVD risk factors at the threes surveys are shown in Table 1. There was a very consistent pattern with positive associations seen for SBP and DBP with BMI, S- Cholesterol, WHR and alcohol consumption at all three surveys. All these associations remained signi- ficant when further adjusted for each other and for smoking, LTPA and ethnicity. One mmol/l higher baseline S-Cholesterol predic- ted an increase in SBP by 1.16 mm Hg (CI: 0.25; 2.07) over 6 years follow-up, an association that remained statistically significant (1.12 mm Hg, CI: 0.16; 2.08) when further adjusted for BMI, smoking and LTPA and ethnicity. SBP and DBP means in the men participating at all three surveys by categories of BMI, S-Cholesterol levels, and by ethnicity (at age 37), and categories of amount of alcohol consumed per week (at age 40) are illustrated in Figure 1. The pattern seen over the study period was very similar in all four variables. Six-year change in both SBP and DBP was sig- nificantly predicted by change in WHR, BMI and HDL-Cholesterol, Table 2. Change in S-Cholesterol predicted change in DBP only. There were a consistent cross-sectional associations with significantly increasing SBP, DBP and HDL- Cholesterol with increasing alcohol intake, both by consumption categories and as a trend test in the surveys both at age 40 and at age 43 years, Table 3. When BMI was entered as a covariate in the model, the associations were attenuated and some did not reach statistical significance. Associations with other CVD risk factors were not consistent. As seen in Table 4, men born in Sweden had sig- nificantly higher SBP at age 37 than men born abroad (A = 4 mm Hg, CI: 2.11; 6.35). Being born in Swe- den, predicted an increased difference in SBP by 2.80 mm Hg (CI: 0.07; 5.53) compared to men being born abroad during the 6-year study period. BMI, WHR, total S-Cholesterol, HDL-Cholesterol and ethnicity explained 11 and 13 percent of the variation (R2) in SBP and DBP respectively at base- line. Standardised P-coefficients ini these models were 0.22 and 0.23 for BMI, 0.13, and 0.18 for S-Choles- terol, 0.11, and 0.07 for HDL-Cholesterol, -0.12 and -0.04 for ethnicity and 0.07 and 0.08 for WHR, re- spectively. Attendance rates were lower for men born abroad than for men born in Sweden but the proportion of men born abroad (13-14%) was consistent in all three surveys, and the distribution of birth country for immigrants born in 1953 and 1954, showed a strong similarity between participants in the CRISS study and men in Helsingborg. Discussion Anthropometrical measurements and S-Cholesterol levels Overall and central obesity predicted an increase in both SBP and DBP and this was to be expected since obesity is a strong determinant for BP [25, 26].

Obesity is also closely related to sleep-disordered breathing and sleep apnoea [28], which in itself is known to increase the risk of hypertension in middle-aged subjects [29--33]. S-Cholesterol is known to have a positive association to BP, an association that is strongest in areas with a high prevalence of hypercholesterolemia [34]. It has been suggested that atherogenic lipid profiles, medi- ated by small dense LDL-Cholesterol and by other dyslipidiemic features will blunt endothelium-depen- dent vascular relaxation and thus increase BP [34]. The association between S-Cholesterol and BP is stronger in younger than in older men [35, 36]. It has been hypothesized that a higher sympathetic drive might contribute to the association between S-Cho- lesterol and BP. Although these associations are not fully explored, the young age of the study population could thus be one possible explanation why S-Cho- lesterol predicted increase in SBP in the CRISS co- hort [36]. When the risk factors were stratified by levels of increasing risk (S-Cholesterol, BMI, alcohol consumption as well as by ethnicity), the develop- ment of BP in the strata was very parallel over the study period. This indicates that an allocation to specific tracks is taking place at an even younger age in life, a concept that has been proposed earlier [9, 37-39]. Ethnicity In this cohort, men born abroad had significantly lower SBP at all surveys, and a lower SBP increase over the study period than men born in Sweden. The difference in SBP by ethnic background in the CRISS study was substantial considering that an estimate of origin of birthplace showed that more than 40% of the attending participants came from Northern and Eastern parts of Europe where BP levels are known to be high [7, 12, 13]. A substantial proportion of the heritability of high BP is thought to be mediated through anthropometrical measures [40, 41]. Beha- viours, such as foods and physical activity, that affect obesity and hence BP, show big variations across different cultures. These habits are known to dilute in immigrants by time since they left their native coun- try [42], but remedies of cultural behaviours can persist through generations, as seen between English and French caucasians living in Canada [43]. In this study we entered smoking and LTPA score as behavioural risk factors in the models but they did not explain any differences between men born abroad and men born in Sweden. The number of men born abroad in the CRISS cohort was too small to allow for a systematic stratification by different regions of birth, and furthermore we did not have information about the duration of stay in Sweden. Alcohol Alcohol consumption showed consistent positive as- sociations with SBP and DBP. This is in accordance with previous reports [14, 15, 33, 44, 45]. However, change in alcohol consumption did not predict change in BP over time. The power to identify an effect over time was probably limited by the shorter follow-up on alcohol consumption, and by a lower precision in the measurements of alcohol than in other risk factors. High BP and very high, acute, ethanol consump- tion is thought to have clinical importance, especially in connection to cerebro-vascular disease [46]. Mechanisms behind persistent BP elevation in rela- tion to moderate levels of alcohol intake might partly be explained by increased sensitivity of blood vessels to pressor substances [46].</page><page sequence="6">Table 3.

The gen- eral concept is that all estimations tend to be far too low for all categories of alcohol consumption [22]. In this study we used an established adjusted quantity- frequency method and the distribution of alcohol consumption by categories was similar to another study from the region where the same quantity-fre- quency method was used [22]. The low alcohol consumer's category was the largest group, including approximately half of the men. We used this group as reference to represent an ordinary drinking pattern, thus to create a crude, but more reliable, comparison to those with a higher consumption of alcohol. Men who stated that they never drank alcoholic beverages were ignored from our statistical analyses, as abstainers are known to be a very heterogeneous group [48-50]. The number of men in this category was also small. Conclusion In this study we showed that BP show big changes over a short period of time and determinants that are available to modifications, such as behaviours, seem to be a prime target for primary prevention in early adult life. The results further suggest that the mech- anisms behind the curve of individual risk factor development might start at even younger ages.
