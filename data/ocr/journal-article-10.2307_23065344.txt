Ich glaube, der Mensch traumt nur, damit er nicht aufhore zu sehen. Goethe I. Introduction The theme of this book, "Deus praesens" invokes a wide range of ancient cult practices and ideas. This essay is situated in the long debate about the relationships between the divine presence and cultic images.1 To be more specific, in spite of the well-known conceptual problems, the Greeks and Romans kept on making ever more elaborate statues of the gods and setting them up in sanctuaries, temples, cities, and homes. Pheidias' colossal and exceedingly expensive statues of Athena Parthenos in Athens and of Zeus at Olympia were throughout antiquity both admired as the greatest works of Greek religious art and rejected as cultically inappropriate because of unrestrained anthropomorphism and wasteful gigantism.2 Instead of historically detailing the controversial reception of the art works, Dio of Prusa's Oration 12 will be examined because he presents in it a highly influential discussion of the arguments, reflecting of course his own philosophical perspective.3 1 See the bibliography below. 2 For the phenomenon of colossal statues, see Cancik 1990: 52-53. 3 The present study is based on the edition of the Greek text by Klauck 2000; see also Russell 1992. The English translation is cited, unless stated otherwise, from the edition by Cohoon 1939. No attempt has been made in this study to deal adequately with the extensive secondary literature.</page><page sequence="2">132 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) II. Occasion and Literary Aspects of the Speech As for the occasion, Dio was invited to give the speech during the Olympic Gaines (in the years 101 or 105 C.E.) in front of the Temple of Zeus. He had just returned from his exile under Domitian during which he traveled abroad and spent time at the Dacian frontier with the Getae and the Mysians on the lower Danube river.4 Assuming a Socratic posture, he ironically confesses his various dilemmas of still being in tatters from the travel, having to improvise and fumble about what to say, and, first of all, struggling with the question which genre of speech to use, an encomium or a hymn.5 If he praises the statue visible to his audience, he appears to laud not the invisible god but the art work of the dyaliiatoTToioc (sculptor), Pheidias. If he is to praise the god himself, he must first clarify how the image of Zeus was conceived and what it represents. If, as Pheidias claims, he got his ideas from Homer, then should Pheidias or Homer be praised? If Homer provided the image, how could he know what Zeus looks like? Since Homer had only his poetic imagination to draw on, there was no reason to praise him for it because of the questionable anthropomorphic nature of the image.6 Given these complications, what kind of speech should Dio present? Another conventional piece of verbal flourishes? That was out of the question for the self-conscious philosopher he was. If, clearly, none other than the god himself must be praised, precisely what connection exists between the presence of Zeus and the presence of the statue? If the god himself is to be praised, it should certainly be by a hymn, but before hymnic praise can begin, the controversial issues must first be argued. Thus, the genre of Dio's present speech must by necessity be a mixed one, the subordinate parts adding up to what as a whole is a prose hymn.7 To begin, a prolalia (1-16), which only at first sight seems unrelated to the subject matter, is prefaced to prepare the audience for the heavier material to follow.8 Then follow the traditional parts of the exordium, the narratio and the propositio (16—26).9 The question is, however, whether 4 See, with further literature, Klauck 2000:25-27. 5 Of course, these admissions are a rhetorical ploy; Dio's speech is a masterpiece of rhetoric, composition, and philosophical discourse. See Hammerstaedt and Terbuyken 1996. 6 For ancient discussions of this issue, see Geffcken 1917-19; Funke 1981: 697-99, 716 20, 747-50; Burkert 2001: 80-94. 7 For the mixture of genres and the rhetorical analysis, see Klauck 2000: 160-86. 8 On the prolalia, see Klauck 2000: 163-65. I myself see its end in the words oKououtat; dvSpoc UrgStou Kai afSoAeoxou (12. 16). 9 Russell 1992: 16-19, and Klauck 2000: 28-30, assume an exordium in sections 16-20, and a narratio in sections 21-26.</page><page sequence="3">Hans Dieter Betz 133 section 16 should rather be the beginning of the narratio, omitting the exordium because the prolalia has already served its purpose.10 Accordingly, the propositio would begin in section 21, posing the question of the appropriate topic for the speech: "Now is it more agreeable and more opportune for you . . .?" It ends in section 26b with the proposal of the topic:11 Or, should we somewhat more carefully consider these two topics themselves, I mean the expressions of our poets and the dedications here, and try to ascertain whether there is some sort of influence which in some way actually moulds and gives expression to men's conception of the deity, exactly as if we were in a philosopher's lecture room at this moment? The main body (27-84a) is made up of an elaborate philosophical argumentation2 in which Dio presents altogether five sources for our human knowledge of the gods (27-48); this section modifies the traditional theologia tripertita (27—43): the basic idea of the divine as innate in human nature (27-39a), and the two acquired sources coming from poetry and law (39b-43). This set of three is then expanded by a fourth on the theory of representational art (44-46), and a fifth concerning philosophy (47).13 III. Pheidias' Defense of His Statue as Religious Art Having set forth this philosophical foundation, Dio switches to another genre altogether, a fictional court trial (49-83),14 in which Pheidias is accused (49-54) and then defends himself in a lengthy speech (55-83). The upshot is both the triumph of the artist and the praise of Zeus as god (84a). 10 It seems that the words ical yap 6r| tuyxavu (12. 16) are the beginning of a narrative describing Dio's way from the Danube to Olympia; it ends in section 20 with his remembering an old oath: "... but because I recalled to mind an old vow, I turned my course hither to you, ever considering that things divine have the greater claim than things human, however important they may be." 11 12. 26b, with the last words comparing the speech to a philosophical lecture (cm kv 4&gt;uA.oo6cJ&gt;ou SuxtpiPf] to vw [ouoii']). For the text as cited here, see Klauck 2000: 123 n. 127. '2 The argumentatio, beginning in section 27 (Ilepi 8r| 0«5v xfjq te Ka0oAx&gt;u &lt;t&gt;uoeco&lt;; . . .), is in fact a philosophical 6iarpiPii (see previous note); it concludes in section 84a (Taut' ouv etnovra Kai (foroXoyriaanevov tov 4&gt;€i.8(av eLkotcoi; qioi SokoOoiv ol "EAArivci; OTat&gt;ai&gt;(3aat av.). 13 In section 47, Dio calls this the fourth source, following those of the poets, the lawgivers and the artists. Actually, counting also the first source of the innate knowledge of God (sections 27-39a), this would be the fifth (see Klauck 2000: 136 n. 242; 137 nn. 248, 250-51). However, as commentators have pointed out, there is no special need for treating philosophy separately because the speech as a whole is philosophical. 14 See on this Klauck 2000: 28; 138 nn. 253, 255.</page><page sequence="4">134 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) In the peroratio (84b-85), Zeus confirms Dio's speech by his own voice (84b) and provides a final word of somber admonition to the Greeks (85). 1. The accusation (50b-54) is a formal speech within Dio's speech delivered by an imagined speaker. Couched in a flourish of the highest possible praise and admiration for Pheidias' artistic work (51-52), he is asked to answer the central question of anthropomorphism: Is the statue, for all "the pleasure and delight which it affords the eye of man,"15 not merely the glorification of a human being? In other words,16 Was the shape you by your artistry produced appropriate to a god and was its form worthy of the divine nature, when you not only used a material which gives delight but also presented a human form of extraordinary beauty and size ...? The danger lurking here is that because of the perfect artistry of the work, no one who has seen it will ever be able to imagine Zeus in any other way. As a result, by its dazzling impact the statue transforms what should be a religious experience of encountering the deity into an aesthetic experience of viewing a glorified human being (53). While in earlier times cultic images were taken as symbolic representations of the superhuman nature of the gods, symbolic because of the realization that no human art could ever make an adequate image of their nature,17 Pheidias' statue has in fact exchanged the divine nature for a perfect artifact of human nature. Therefore, in spite of his good intentions and enormous accomplishments as well as the Eleans' huge financial expenses, Pheidias' statue does not meet the criteria of GeoTtpeireia (divine majesty), and is thus inappropriate for a god.18 2. Pheidias' defense (55-83a) sets forth an entire theory of religious art. To begin with, he restates the problem: His representation of the god19 has been made with due respect to the dignity of the god who governs the universe and so to be a true likeness of him, in no way falling short of the best portrayal of the divinity that is within the capacity of human beings to make, or is unworthy of him and unbefitting. 15 52:... irpog r|6our|v Kal xcpi(rii' dv0pu&gt;mvT}&lt;; oi|&lt;eu&lt;;. 16 Ibid.: Ei 8' aC to Trpftrov et8o&lt;; Kal xfjv dijiav |iop&lt;t&gt;r|v Tfj&lt;; 0eoO (|&gt;uo«o&lt;; ^rinioupyrioag uir| T« 4uiT€pu€i xpio^f1"01:. dv6po&lt;; te |iop4&gt;riv utTepc|)v&gt;f| to KaAAoc Kal to |iey«0o? 6ci5ac ... 17 54:.. . oil 6umxivto iKavui; airopi|iiioa0ai. 6ia Ovrfriy; tex^C t#|v aKpav Kal T€A.€ioTaTr|i&gt; 4)ijai.v. 18 The key term is irpeuov ktX.

By comparison, the sculptor is a craftsman who works not with his tongue but with his hands, trying to mold hard and inflexible materials like stone and metal. Whereas the poet creates images by words, the artist, as best as he can, has to force the materials to conform to images he already has to have in his mind. Whereas the poet creates many images on the spur of the moment, the artist is confined to making just one image which, when it is done, cannot be changed (69-72). Where does the artist get these images, if not from the poets? From whom else but from Homer? Reading nothing but Homer, Pheidias says, he learned all the anthropomorphisms from him.21 At this point (73-74), he addresses Homer in person, asking him to accept the following statement as his "Homeric theology": 22 Thou certainly wilt agree, O Homer, wisest of poets, who both in the power of thy poetry and in time dost by far excel and wast practically the first to show the Hellenes many beautiful images of all the gods, and especially of the greatest among them, some images mild but others fear inspiring and dread. But our god is peaceful and altogether gentle, such as befits the guardian of a faction-free and concordant Hellas; and this I, with the aid of my art and of the counsel of the wise and good city of the Eleans have set up—a mild and majestic god in pleasing guise, the Giver of our material and our physical life and of all our blessings, the common Father and Saviour and Guardian of mankind, in so far as it was possible for a mortal man to frame in his mind and to represent the divine and inimitable nature. 20 On the artistic problem of imagining and representing invisible realities, see especially Barasch 1998. 21 This was not the only possible explanation, however: according to Anth. Pal. 4. 81 Phidias had a vision of Zeus, and Philostr., VA 6. 19, jokingly suggests that he must have ascended to heaven to take a look at the god. See also Funke 1981: 698-99. 22 The important words are (74): o &amp; metepoi; elpriviKOi; Kal navraxoO irpao;, oloq aaTomctarau Kal 6|iovoouor|&lt;; tij&lt; 'EXAd6oi; eitioKonoi;' ow eyw iieta trjc e^autou Kai tfjq 'HXetcov troXeajc oo4&gt;f|&lt;; Kai. dyaGfic pouXtuoapEi/oi; l6puaa(iriw, %iepoi/ Kal ot\ivov ev aXuii^ oxrmaTl-&gt; P'ou KaL Kat £upndncov 6oTf|pa xwv dya06v, koivoi/ di^Gpuuui' Kal uatepa Kal auTtipa Kal 4&gt;uAaKa, cic fiwaToi/ 0wiT&lt;i&gt; 6iavoT]9Em pipiioaoSai. tf|u Qeiav Kal aiiTixaTOy (jjuoiv. Cohoon's somewhat archaic translation is not out of place here.</page><page sequence="6">136 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) Specifically, as he points out further by listing Zeus' divine epithets (75-76), Pheidias sought to portray him, in a symbolic way,23 as24 the "God of Friends, Suppliants, Strangers, Refugees," and all such qualities in short, by the benevolence and gentleness and goodness appearing in his countenance. The "God of Wealth" and the "Giver of Increase" are represented by the simplicity and grandeur shown by the figure, for the god does in very truth seem like one who is giving and bestowing blessings. These epithets, Pheidias says, he has, as best he could, converted into images in his statue, without naming them by words.25 Turning the question back to his accuser, he asks, whether the list of divine epithets, cited as in a hymn, are not adequately represented by the complex assemblage of the statue's imagery. As he makes clear next (78), Pheidias knows all too well that there is another side of the god, the terrifying one who flashes lightning, throws thunderbolts, and sends war and death, but he was and is unable, and indeed unwilling, to portray that image of Zeus. What Homer could do without difficulty, is for the artist an impossibility (79-82). Yet, while Homer had at his disposal all the extravagant means of poetic language, not even he could portray Zeus as he really is. In order to do that, Homer would have to have, like Zeus himself, the whole universe assisting him—too much to expect from any human artist. As a result:26 I will not concede that there ever has been a better sculptor than I, but to Zeus, who fashioned the whole universe, it is not right to compare any mortal. If these are the limitations, why then go to the trouble of setting up this enormous statue? Why not worship the gods non-iconically, without images? However,27 23 77: . . . to Tf\g nop4&gt;f|g onoiov a&gt; et5ei oupftoXou. Text according to Klauck 2000: 101— 02; 153 n. 391.

There are two fundamental reasons, Pheidias argues, why images are necessary. First, it is a psychological fact that human beings desire to be near the deity:28 For although the intelligent man does indeed reverence all those objects, believing them to be blessed gods that he sees from a great distance, yet on account of our belief in the divine all men have a strong yearning to honour and worship the deity from close at hand, approaching and laying hold of him with persuasion by offering sacrifice and crowning him with garlands. Second, and coming to the central issue, Pheidias' image of Zeus symbolically displays epithets of Zeus. These epithets have been selected by the artist because they simultaneously represent virtues. In this way, as section 42 shows, Pheidias creates a chain of ethical values, beginning with the immortal parent, Zeus Patroos, then the mortal parents. Thus, by configuring in the mind the divine virtues, the admiring viewers learn these virtues; they impress themselves on the viewers' minds and, by way of reciprocity, help shape not only their moral and ethical but also their religious life.29 Such visual paideia is of the greatest importance both for the individual and for the community, the literate and non-literate.30 The peroratio (84b-85) contains a brief recapitulatio. Aimed at the philosophers as well as the common people, Dio's hearers may have lost the thread of what the long speech is all about, the significance of setting up statues to the gods, of which Pheidias' statue of Zeus is the prime example. As required and intended, the image does lead up to a praise of the god. Paradoxically, however, the final verdict is left to Zeus himself who, Dio reminds them, is looking down on the audience right now, displaying 28 60: raura |iev yap fftiuana o ye voOy €xa)v aepei, fleoui; riyounfoc ^aKaptouc (laKpoSev 6p(5f 6ia 6c tt|V npoc to 6ai[i6iaoy 6p^r]i' toxupoi; epug iraoiv dwGpoinoii; JyyuGev ti|iav Kal 0cpau€uei.v to 8cioi&gt;, npooiovrai; Kal aitTOtievoix; (ietcc irei0oOi;, 8uovrai; Kal ox(§avomaq.

Then in his own words the god praises the Eleans and all Greeks for their religious faithfulness:31 All this rite, you Eleans and all Hellas, you are carrying out, as one may see, very beautifully and fittingly, by offering sacrifices of a magnificence in keeping with your means, and, above all, by holding as from the beginning this most renowned contest of physical condition, strength, and speed, and lastly, because you are preserving in regard to festive occasions and secret rites all the customs which you have inherited. In other words, Pheidias' statue of Zeus did not lead, as charged, to a neglect of traditional religion, but on the contrary, to its continued preservation. As far as Dio's own philosophy is concerned, this conclusion is of course programmatic: an enlightened religion in cooperation with monumental art is the best way of preserving the religious traditions of Greece. Zeus is given the final word, and thus endorsement, in a quotation of a puzzling verse from Homer (Od. 24. 249-50),32 most likely meant to be a lament about the destitute condition of the country: But with deep concern I observe that "Yourself untended seem, and wretched age With mean attire and squalor is your lot." IV. Conclusion Assessing Dio's argument requires answers to the following questions: How is the god Zeus present? How is his presence related to his statue? How is the statue affecting the worship of the god? 1. How is the god Zeus present? Zeus is universally present as "indeed alike of men and of gods and ruler and lord and father, and in addition, the dispenser of peace and of war."33 He is, therefore, not identical with his statues at Olympia or elsewhere. 2. How is Zeus' presence related to his statue? Zeus' universal presence includes, of course, his statue. The statue, however, is the artistic work of Pheidias. For his creation, the artist draws 31 85: Ta8e (lev oikog, 'HAelot &lt;te&gt; Kal f| ounuaoa 'EAAai;, Kaiug Kai npoariKovTwi; CTiteXctg, Sima; te 0uouoa ek twv mpovxuv (j€yaXonpeiT€i&lt;; Kai 6f) Kal xbv euKXeeoxaTov aycjya xiQetoa (ii; (for' dpxfjt; ti&gt;ei;tag Kai paSjj.ru; Kai xaxoui;, ooa te eoptwv Kai (iuoTriptwu €0r| iapouoa 6ia&lt;|&gt;uAaTT€i.&lt;;.

By selecting from Homer a canon of divine epithets appropriate in light of the religious and cultural traditions and laws, Pheidias forms in his mind the concept and design of the statue. The final step is the material construction of the statue which conforms to the image of the god present in the mind of the artist. 3. How does the statue affect the worship of the god? Worshiped is not the statue but the god directly. Gazing at the statue sets in motion a mental process analogous to the creation of the artwork, only in reverse direction. The viewers' innate memory of knowing the deity is informed and shaped through reconverting the image into the epithets and virtues of the god. As a result, the viewer is led to admire, worship, and ethically imitate the god. Given Dio's Platonic and Stoic presuppositions, the creation of the statue can thus be justified as indispensable on philosophical and religious grounds. By comparison, non-iconic worship of the deity by looking only at the open sky appears reductionist in that it is limited to specially gifted and philosophically trained individuals.34 Such worship lacks the social integration of the individual into cultic communities and their institutions and traditions. In a sense, non-iconic religions such as Judaism and Christianity confirm Dio's critique at this point. Concurrent with the non iconic concept of God, these religions developed mediating systems of angels and saints.35 Furthermore, the development of Christology characteristic of Christianity may be seen in this light, too. Beginning with Paul, Christology involves an intricate concept of Christ's eIkqv as reflecting the image of God. In Paul's vision on the road near Damascus Christ's €lkwv appeared36 which gave shape to the apostle as hi|itvctk tou Xpujtou, who in turn is "imitated" by the Christians as members of the church as "body of Christ" (ocojioi tou Xpiaxou).37 On the other hand, the Gospels each in its own way convey verbal portraits of Christ which, when read, form conceptual images of Christ in the Christian and serve as the basis of worship.38 As a result, notwithstanding the doctrinal formulations of theology, Christology, and soteriology, Christ, and thus God, are represented in the believers by envisioned images. The question as to how precisely this is to be related to the communication by word and ritual, as 34 See 51, and Metzler 1985-86: 98,104 n. 26. 35 See, on this point, Vollenweider 2002. 36 See Gal 1:16; 1 Cor 9:1; 15:8; Acts 9:3-5; 22:6-11; 26:12-18. 37 On eiKQu, see the scholarly literature on 1 Cor 15:49; 2 Cor 3:18; 4:4; Col 1:15; 3:10.
