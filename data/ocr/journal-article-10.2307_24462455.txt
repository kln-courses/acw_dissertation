Satan's journey in darkness for a week around the earth was astronomically impos sible. He could not have followed the colures and remained in darkness, except poetically. Mil 9 ton's reference to the mythical "Car of Night" makes darkness a force in conflict with light and not simply a privation of light. Thus it is possible to conceive light and darkness alternating round the earth, with darkness extending to the poles. Traditional demon lore, which associated evil spirits with the colures, may have influenced Mil ton to include them as a part of Satan's course. Patrick Brantlinger. "To See New Worlds: Curi osity in PL." MLQ, XXXIII, iv (December, 1972), 355-69. "Milton concludes nothing about any scientific doctrine; he says nothing favorable or unfavorable about astronomy and geography. Temperance is MILTON QUARTERLY 57 all. For if temperance will not answer our ques tions about the complexities of nature, it will keep us from mistaking them for 'irregularities,' and it will teach us that grace alone can lead us through the labyrinth of the world to the throne of God. If Adam must 'dream ... of other worlds' in dis contentment, if he perches on the wall of Eden restlessly, then he must learn evil with good and journey into a world of doubt, mazes, and decep tions, as Satan must journey back to hell. To see 'new worlds' rightly, is to praise God; but to see 'new worlds' intemperately, is to sail to no 'happy lie,' for the 'happy lie' is left behind." John Gribben. "Steinbeck's East of Eden and Mil ton's PL: A discussion of Timshel." Steinbeck Quarterly, V, ii (Spring, 1972), 35-43. Steinbeck and Milton both envision man as possessing freedom of choice (timshel is the He brew word)—for Steinbeck, freedom of choice in the face of heredity or environment, for Milton, freedom of choice even in the face of God's fore knowledge. Milton and Steinbeck, each in his own way, affirm the doctrine of man's free will and man's ultimate responsibility for his own moral decisions. There are differences between the two writers, however: Milton attempts to justify the ways of God to men; Steinbeck, to justify the ways of men to men and the individual to himself. John Illo. "The Misreading of Milton." Radical Perspectives in the Arts. ed. Lee Baxandall (Pen guin, 1972), 178-92 (appeared earlier in The Co lumbia University Forum VIII [Summer, 1965], 38-42). Areopagitica has been long misread by critics and scholars. Even the title itself has been mis understood: by the time of Aeschylus, the Areo pagus, originally a criminal court, had assumed the function of a Big Brother. Milton approved of such a censorship function, such a regulation of public and private morality. While Areopagitica may represent Milton's rejection of censorship before publication, it certainly should not be con sidered a rejection of censorship after publication. Milton, after all, was writing to promote the estab lishment of the commonwealth of saints, and he was astute enough to realize that that establish ment necessitated certain controls of the press. The Areopagitic condemnation of censorship is in fact a rationale of revolutionary censorship.</page><page sequence="2">58 MILTON QUARTERLY R. K. Kaul. "Milton and Spinoza: Forerunners of the Enlightenment." Enlightenment Essays, II, i (Spring, 1971), 30-37. "Insofar as Milton and Spinoza attempted to emancipate the human mind from superstition, dogma, and obscurantism; insofar as they asserted the right of the individual to interpret God's word, and to express it freely, they were alike. Neither recognized any authority other than Scrip ture and reason. Milton equated reason with the individual conscience. Spinoza talked more often of reason as something impersonal and scientific. But they were both thorough rationalists—not that they failed to acknowledge the supernatural. Certain things are inexplicable in terms of reason. They might have agreed with St. Augustine that God's judgments are inscrutable and His ways past finding out. Both of them saw, however, that God's inscrutability was another name for man's ignorance. They were forerunners of the Enlight enment in the sense that they sought to extend man's knowledge rather than rejoice over the mystery of the unknown." Michael Lieb.

"The Complete Prose Works of John Milton, Yale University Press, 1971, Volume V, Parts I and II," Notes and Queries, N.S. XIX, (August and December, 1972), 320, 474-478. Part I, the History of Britain, is judged a scholarly achievement in text and annotation, although the omission of 54 pages of the original edition (the "Table" or index) is unexplained. Part II, The Miltonic State Papers, does not establish an au thoritative canon of texts, omits authentic Milton documents and includes inappropriate non-Mil tonic papers; neglects the Skinner and Columbia ® MSS., leading to fallacy in translation; falls short of basic editorial requirements in grasp of back ground context, and in Milton studies in particu lar; includes errors extraordinary in number and, in kind, in geography, in history, in citations to sources, etc.; and is composed in a style consonant with its scholarship. Ste'la Revard. "Satan's Envy of the Kingship of the Son of God: A Reconsideration of PL, Book V, and its Theological Background." MP, LXX, iii (February, 1973), 190-98. When Milton dramatizes Satan's revolt in Book V, it is not pride to which he gives first mention, but envy. Satan's envy of the Messiah springs from an incomplete understanding of the true nature of the Son's kingship: Satan sees the king ship as something which exists external to the Son himself: "To put the Son's radiance within reach of his desire, Satan resolves that it is something outside the Son and not inherent in him, that in fast it is a bestowed 'part' of his kingship, the result of, not the antecedent to, kingship." Satan's envy springs from a resentment of the "hereditary" conferring of kingship upon the Son; worth of person has little to do with the power of the kingship since it is derived from the office. Satan's resentment of the Son is inseparable from a desire for his office. Ironically, in Hell, Satan £ becomes a tyrant "whose power depends upon his subjects renunciation of their right, a figure head who demands the service of elaborate cere mony, and who argues his title derived from 'just right and the fixt Laws of Heav'n . . . .' Satan here . . . becomes the icon of his envy." Donald A. Roberts. "A Preface to PL." An ad dress to The New York C. S. Lewis Society, pub lished in the CSL: The Bulletin of the New York C. S. Lewis Society, III, xii (October, 1972). Despite Lewis' many positive achievements in his Preface to PL, some few of his conclusions need to be critically re-examined. Lewis' complaint</page><page sequence="3">about the anthropomorphism of Heavenly matters fails to take into account that Milton had to write for an audience whose sensibilities were of neces sity mundane. Furthermore, Lewis' charge that PL is less a religious poem than some of Herbert's or Traherne's does not consider the generic de mands and the panoramic scope of PL's concep 9 tion. But Lewis' most positive contribution to Milton scholarship is his "demolition of the absurd notion that Satan is the 'Hero' of PL": Lewis ex poses the irony and bombast of Satan's utterances and thus demonstrates the inversion of Satan's heroism. D. M. Rosenberg. "Style and Meaning in Milton's Anti-Episcopal Tracts." Criticism XV, i (Winter, 1973), 43-57. Milton, as a humanist-scholar, was aware of the classical rhetorical traditions and of the stylistic demands of genre. In the Tracts Milton most often draws upon the pulpit, the polemical pamphlet, and the biblical prophets as stylistic sources for his writing. The tension between these styles dra matizes Milton's own personal conflicts between doctrine and sensibility. The ornament and the "impersonality" of the Classical rhetorical style, in which Milton had been nurtured, are unsuitable for the "plainnes and perspicuity" (I, 556) of Scriptural language; Milton's attempts to resolve this stylistic dilemma are discovered in his other two major styles: the pamphleteering and the prophetic. Milton's debt to the pamphlet prose tradition is revealed in those passages which "dem onstrate his plainness of diction, colloquial partic ularity, and satiric wit". In the prophetic liter ature of the Bible Milton discovered a style ^ which tended to subjectify doctrine and invest prose with the authority of direct Inspiration. In the Anti-Episcopal Tracts Milton "strikes for a synthesis of church and state, Christianity and monarchy, revelation and reason, reform and liberty. . . . The stylistic interaction . . . reveals major ideological conflicts more than it achieves synthesis". Arnold Stein. "On Milton's Unfortunate Lovers." Presented to the Milton Society, 27 December, 1972. Milton's world of human love stands a little apart from the universal models which it resem bles: the supreme model is the creative action of MILTON QUARTERLY 59 God's love, which is inimitable but which imposes imperatives upon human love. The Son's love in Heaven defines concepts and standards by which we can measure the action of Adam and Eve, but the Son's love cannot be "known" on earth, merely intuitively apprehended. The problem with earthly love is that its movement is at once vertical (up ward to God and downward to His Creation) and horizontal (existing between two human beings). Such an earthly love, of necessity, creates stress and potential imbalance: Adam's problem is to reconcile divine love with non-divine woman. Ulti mately, of course, the pattern of Divine love can not be maintained by the earthly pair, and we can see in Eve's speeches of love to Adam the in creasing assertion of self and the subordination of the thou to the I. Finally Eve parodies the Christ ological pattern of love when she "declares that she did it all for Adam, and Adam is willing to sacrifice his own life—not for her but to remain united with her." The love equilibrium is only re established after the Fall when Eve in her speech to Adam again reveals her dependence upon him : "thou to me/Art all things under Heav'n." Dennis Welch. "Theme and Form in Comus and Lycidas." Cithara, XII, i (November, 1972), 74-84. Milton's conception of poetry is such that it leads men from the corrupt, physical world, to an idealized, transcendent world where grace and beauty flourish. Comus and Lycidas, both derived from the European tradition of the pastoral, ex emplify Milton's understanding of the relationship between experience and the creative word. Comus as "creative word" dramatizes a Lady who "may not write poetry, but her life possesses the order and beauty of art and her intimacy with divine grace is part and parcel of the aims of true po etry"; Lycidas represents a reconciling of corrup tion with aspiration, of death with resurrection. Both works demonstrate divine vision penetrating the physical world. Through artistic convention (poetry) or virtue, man may approximate the idealized transcendent world of the Divine. Michael Wilding. "The Last of the Epics: The Rejection of the Heroic in PL and Hudibras" in Restoration Literature: Critical Approaches. Ed. Harold Love. London: Methuen &amp; Co., 1972. pp. 91-120.</page><page sequence="4">60 MILTON QUARTERLY Milton and Butler both reject the heroic ethos in their respective works. Each writer, having lived through the experience of the English Civil War, questions the literary form which ennobles a martial code of behavior. Milton's Satan "is both the traditional hero and the embodiment of evil; and the two qualities are shown to be inseparable in him and in all heroes." Butler's Hudibras is reduced to contemptibility by a derisive inver sion of traditionally heroic gestures. In short, "what both PL and Hudibras remarkably have in common are heroes of appalling degradation." Milton's PL differs from Butler's Hudibras, however, in that Milton offers an alternative to the false-heroic of Satan by creating a new heroism embodied in the Christian heroes Christ and Adam. Butler is content to invert the traditional heroic, while at the same time rendering an im pression of the richness of private life and the texture of rural life.</page></plain_text>
