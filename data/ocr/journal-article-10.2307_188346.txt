<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Cole does acknowledge a number of methodological problems with his studies, but he does not seem to recognize that the contructivist sociologists he criticizes long ago rejected the analytic approach he adopts. This approach has been given various labels by its critics: H. Blumer called it "variable analysis", C. W. Mills called it "abstracted empiricism", and H. Garfinkel labeled it "constructive analysis" (which is not to be confused with con- structivism). This analytic framework was vigorously promoted by P. Lazarsfeld, Merton's colleague at Columbia, and for many American sociologists it became synonymous with "science". Cole is so captivated by this approach that he seems oblivious to the fact that the social historians and ethnographers he criticizes do not necessarily intend "to show how cognitive dependent variables are influenced by social independent variables" (p. 33). Some of Cole's confusion may arise because some proponents of the sociology of sci- entific knowledge advocate a kind of causal analysis. B. Barnes and D. Bloor, for example, treat causality as one of the cornerstones of the Edinburgh School's Strong Programme. However, they do not seem to have in mind the kind of abstract, probabilistic analysis favored by Cole. Instead, they prefer to write historical case studies that show how specific innovations arise within distinctive, and temporarily unsettled, configurations of interests, group commitments, rhetorical arguments, and evidential demonstrations. Such historical demonstrations are ideographic insofar as they show how conceptual generalities (ideology, social interests, group affiliations, and the like) articulate with singular episodes. Whether presented convincingly or not, demonstrations of historical contingency differ from the kind of probabilistic analysis used by sociologists like Cole to measure the extent to which stable, abstractly defined factors correlate with one another. Given Cole's rather narrow conception of empirical demonstration, he unsurprisingly argues that "thus far there has been no research which presents a convincing case that the actual content of communal knowledge outcomes is determined by these social processes" (p. 35). Doubtful also is that his studies provide a convincing demonstration of the rela- tionship between social processes and the actual content of communal knowledge. The problem is not that he wants to bring evidence to bear on a philosophical debate, but that his conception of evidence, proof, argumentation, and causal analysis is derived uncriti- cally from the very sort of applied philosophy of science his constructivist interlocutors reject. Michael Lynch, The University of West London at Brunel. JOHN R. COLE. The Olympian Dreams and Youthful Rebellion of Rene Descartes. Champaign, IL: University of Illinois Press (1992), xi + 299 pp., 34.95 (cloth). Philosophical legend fixes the genesis of modem philosophy in a "stove-heated room" near Ulm, Germany on 10 November 1619, occupied only by a twenty-three-year-old R. Descartes and his decision to break definitively with his intellectual past and found all his future beliefs on a foundation of certainty. Descartes himself proposed the legend and his biographers have maintained it. J. Cole aims in this fascinating study of the young Descartes less to refute the legend than to enrich our historical understanding of that day and that person until the legend fades from view. Cole's history is distinguished by the importance he accords Descartes's three "Olympian" dreams from the night of November 10, recorded by Descartes in a now lost "little notebook", descriptions of which survive in the writings of Leibniz and of Descartes' seventeenth-century biographer, A. Baillet. Cole contends that, properly interpreted, these dreams verify that the "egocentric rationalism" that mod- em philosophy associates with Descartes both originated in and was informed by Descartes' troubled relationship with his mentor, I. Beekman, and by his decision to abandon the legal career that his family expected of him. Thus this book should interest philosophers of science on two distinct counts: as an attempt to fill in the history of the young Descartes on the brink of his intellectual career, and as an attempt to historicize and understand a past thinker by analyzing his dreams, 374 years later. The latter task presents extraordinary difficulties, yet Cole deals admirably with what he has, namely, partial second- and third-hand accounts of the dreams, contextual and cultural clues, and a long-since-dead dreamer. Given the historical evidence it should not be a shock that the significance of the dreams, the validity of the second-hand accounts 677</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS of them, the accuracy of Descartes' own account, and their very historicity have all been denied. Cole articulates these various skepticisms along with their motivations, and he argues convincingly (in text, footnotes, and three appendixes) at least for the historicity of the dreams and for the accuracy of the surviving second- and third-hand accounts. The meaning of the dreams-indeed, the sense in which they are meaningful-is an- other matter. In the background of Cole's study is a commitment to Freud's method of dream analysis (and, specifically, to the distinction between "manifest" and "latent" con- tent, and to a dependence on the dreamer's associations for an accurate interpretation) with which many readers, philosophers and historians alike, will be unsympathetic. Cole takes himself to be on firm ground here, citing as authorities "informed psychologists" (p. 230) and the work of "the best qualified psychophysiological researchers" (ibid.), the latest being D. Foulkes (1978). Respected work in cognitive science of more recent vintage (e.g., J. A. Hobson 1988 or Crick and Mitchison 1983), however, rejects Cole's method. This is not to discount the meaningfulness of the dreams, nor to ask from Cole a full defense of Freud's approach in this work on Descartes. It is to suggest that Cole reevaluate his allegiances. Even granting the main points of Freud's method for understanding dreams, the question remains of whether Descartes' Olympian dreams are candidates for Freudian interpreta- tion-specifically, whether the necessary associations between dream elements and aspects of the dreamer's waking life are available to the twentieth-century historian. Interestingly, Freud turned down a request to interpret Descartes' dreams. Cole presses on, though, for he, unlike Freud, knows the historical details which reveal the needed associations. Cole's efforts are largely successful, though success here is hard to judge. For example, in his first dream Descartes is told to meet a Monsieur N, who (Descartes imagines) has for Descartes a melon. Freud, not surprisingly and despite his earlier hesitancy, found a sexual significance in the melon. Cole finds, in dictionaries and in poetry of Descartes' culture, a connection between melons and friendship sans sexual overtones: A good friend is like a good melon in the difficulty one has in identifying it as good (pp. 142-144). Both analyses go some distance toward enlightening our understanding of the relationship be- tween Descartes and Beekman, and Cole's analysis is intuitively better than Freud's. But the vagueness of criteria for correctness is one reason for rejecting Freud's approach al- together. What, in all, do we learn from Cole of the young Descartes? Less, perhaps, from Cole's analyses of the Olympian dreams than from the historical research that he marshals to interpret them in the first place. Cole devotes one chapter to Descartes' activities in the months prior to November 10, another to the significance of that date in seventeenth- century France, and two more chapters to Descartes' relationship to his family and with Beekman, respectively. Here we are told much. For example, November 10, Saint Martin's Eve, marked both the third anniversary of Descartes' licentiate in canon and civil law and the beginning of an annual three-day national ceremony which included the beginning of the French judicial year and the taking of oaths by new lawyers. Descartes' father Joachim was at this time in the process of bringing the family into nobility by securing judicial offices for himself and his sons, and Rene's failure to obtain an office was disappointing. Furthermore, this date marked the first anniversary of Descartes' meeting with the thirty- year-old Beekman, who had, in that past year, engaged Descartes in a melodramatic per- sonal and intellectual relationship, first encouraging Descartes in his "search for truth", then scolding him for intellectual idleness, and finally turning a cold shoulder to Descartes altogether. These are the main points, many (as Cole makes clear) already known; they stand amidst innumerable and fascinating historical details uncovered by Cole. By the end of these chapters, and before interpretation of the dreams in earnest, a compelling case has been made: The Descartes of the stove-heated chamber was engaged in tortuous psy- chological negotiation with his past, reflected to various degrees in the rules of method as we find them, first in his Regulae and later in the Discourse. Thus, despite concluding chapters devoted to dream analysis, by the end of the book, both philosophical legend initiated in the Discourse and the Olympian dreams have faded from view except as ten- uous and optional verification for a historical account better grounded by more familiar and accepted methodology. 678</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS This is a rich, well-written, and scholarly book worth the time of anyone who has won- dered what really lay behind the legend initiated in the Discourse. Editorially, it is marred only by the absence of a subject index, despite separate indexes on "Descartes Life, Thought, and Works"; "Historical Persons and Authors (pre-1800)"; and "Scholarly Authorities (post- 1800)". Aside from that, and aside even from Cole's emphasis on the Olympian dreams, this book is an excellent example of what is involved in "historicizing" figures in the philosophy of science, as well as an excellent reminder of why that enterprise is necessary to that discipline.

Bloodsucking Witchcraft: An Epistemological Study of Anthropomorphic Supernaturalism in Rural Tlaxcala. Tuscon: University of Arizona Press (1993), xxii + 476 pp., $40.00 (cloth). Bloodsucking Witchcraft-the title foreshadows the juiciest of ethnographic voyeurism. The authors deliver. In the early morning of 9 December 1960, seven infants were found dead in three adjacent neighborhoods. They all exhibited the marks that typified the action of the feared tlahuelpuchi, the bloodsucking witch. The children had gone to bed as nor- mal, sleeping either in a makeshift crib or with the parents on a mat. The infants were found on the floor near the door. The door was inexplicably ajar, having been closed the night before. The infants had bruises, purple spots, and acchymoses on their heads, necks, and backs. According to local belief, the bloodsucking witch is a person, typically female, born with an insatiable thirst for the blood of infants. The witch has the power to transform herself into animals or insects, and emits a powerful vapor with which she subdues her victim and any potential witnesses. The families reached a consensus that these children had been sucked by the tlahuelpuchi. Nutini, who gathered the ethnographic data, had the opportunity to examine all seven infants on the morning they were found. He interviewed and closely observed the parents and extended family of each. He collected forty-seven cases over the next five years. One of the unique aspects of this monograph is that the ethnographer carefully examined so many events attributed to witchcraft. The core of Bloodsucking Witchcraft is devoted to characterizing the relevant beliefs and values of the residents of Tlaxcala; the history of these ideas; and the social, psychological, and physical context of the events. The work's theoretical and methodological aims will interest philosophers. The authors distance themselves from two traditions which have shaped cultural anthropology: structural- functionalism and hermeneutics. Structural-functionalist explanations of witchcraft have appealed to its function, say, as a mechanism of conflict resolution. The authors reject such explanations of witchcraft both in general and in the case under study. On their anal- ysis, witchcraft beliefs are explanatory systems (albeit systems with a very different kind of history than scientific beliefs). When the local system of beliefs and values is confronted with physical events which are unfortunate, satisfy the local expectations about the work of witches, and cannot be explained in the other ways available to the locals, the events are attributed to witches. While the book would have been improved by greater clarity, the object of its own explanations seems to be this: Anthropological studies of witchcraft need to explain why the locals make the inferences they do (when presented with particular events) and why they have the perceptions they report. Methodologically, this theoretical stance requires that the social and environmental antecedents of events attributed to witch- craft be recorded and analyzed, along with the various psychological and social conse- quences. According to the hermeneutic tradition in anthropology, the goal of ethnographic description is to interpret the natives' view of themselves and their world. Thus, such 679</page></plain_text>
