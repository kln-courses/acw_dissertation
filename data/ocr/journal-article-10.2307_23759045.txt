Miguel Covarrubias, 1957 We should all keep it in mind that there is no "one" explanation for anything in Olmec iconography or in Classic Maya iconography in that matter. Michael D. Coe, 1982 In the présent Mexican State of Puebla, Valley of Izucar de Matamoros, stands the archaeological site of Las Bo cas, thought to have served as an important Olmec commercial-military outpost during the twelth-to tenth centuries B.C. (Coe 1968:95). The excavations at Las Bocas yielded a wealth of ceramic artifacts, among them a particular group of hollow infantile figures, known as the "jaguar-children". (Figure 2, c, f; Figure 3) Since Michael D. Coe's in depth study on these statuettes, they were regarded not only anthropologi cally most significant, but also artistically "the best of their class" (Coe 1965:185), and some of the prime examples "rank with the world's great art" (Griffin 1981:124). Morphologically the Las Bocas "jaguar-children" are hollow statuettes of nude, chubby, sexless infants made of white-paste clay with finely polished surfaces and red pigment applied matte or punctate zones. A surpris ing range of poses can be seen among them: "crossleg ged, reclining with the head raised on one hand, head resting on knee, and so forth."(Coe 1965:185) Although most of these figurines can stand upright, their postures indicate that they may have been placed "in the laps of larger sculptures or cradled in the arms of humans during ceremonial occasions (Joralemon 1981:176." Most of these figurines are shown seated spread-legged "in the pose of a five month to year-old infant (Coe 1965:105)." They have avocado-shaped heads, puffy baby faces, flaring nostrils, narrow and somew.hat slanted almond eyes, well developed epi canthus-folds, bowed upper lips with the corners of their mouths downturned. The gums of most of them are toothless, however, there are several examples with füll rows of teeth. Some of them wear caps, others are either bald or have elabórate coiffures. Besides Las Bocas, these types of statuettes, most of them however of lesser quality (Griffin 1981:214), were also found at other sites, such as Gualapita, Tlatilco, Atlihuayapan, El Tapiche, Xochipala, Tlapacoya, Tenexepan, and Tonala (Vaillant and Vaillant 1934, Joyce 1931, Covarrubias 1966, Coe 1965a, Joralemon 1981, etc.). (Figures 1-3) Since George Vaillant first described the Las Bocas ba bies years ago (Vaillant 1931 ), they were always thought to represent portraits of supernaturals. Some of their specific body features, such as the typically "Olmec" downturned mouth - coined as "jaguar haunted" by Benson (1981:102) - their obesity and sexlessness, were regarded to indicate that they are images of infant were—jaguars, deities of rain, thunder, and lightning, probably modeled after children affected by glandular desease or mongolism (Covarrubias 1957:51, Lothrop 1964:80, Coe 1965:105, etc.). This "jaguar-weather god - or mongoloid child" theory was summarized by Coe as follows: These are the "Jaguar's children:" Olmec were jaguar babies, offspring of feline father, and human mother, deities of thunder, lightning and rain. Nude and sexless, their obesity is that of eunuchs, while their expression and slanting eyes give a strong impression like mongolism. Their jaguar ancestry shows only in the down-drawn 7</page><page sequence="2">- « Fig. 1 : ''Jaguar-children: " I. a Pacific coast of Guatemala (private collect ion), b (private collection; Sotheby Parke Bernet Inc.

Similar thoughts were expressed by several contributors of the more re cently published volume of The Olmec and Their Neigh bors, Joralemon among them, who regard Stirling's theory as only a "conjecture" (1981:176). He is joined in his views by Drucker who believes that if these scenes would really represent copulation between human and jaguar, then "by all realistic canons of the art style, the feline copulatory posture would have been shown" (1981:45), and by Beatriz de la Fuente who wrote: "A careful analysis reveáis that in the first two sculptures only human beings are represented, and, furthermore, in the sculpture from Potrero Nuevo the feet of a jaguar stand at the side of a female monkey" (1981:90) - a sit uation which after now being recognized will undoubt edly open up further far reaching possibilities in some F'S- 4:Jade mask.

In stead,as suggested (by Furst), it appears to be no thing other than the Olmec expression of a fund amental concept in pan-Mesoamerican cos mological structure - sacred earth as paradoxical Great Mother, conceived heteromorphically as feline toad, sometimes with added traits of birds and animals with related or complimentary associ ations. The ideological link could be with any Mesoamerican species of toad, but for the Olmecs it would have been either Buffo marinus (Figure 10) or the Gulf coast toad B. valliceps, (Furst 1981:157) This "were-toad theory" is based primarily upon three Fig. 7 .Jaguar (Felis onca).(Photography by Amadeus Kubcl Photo- morph0logical features common in figurai Olmec art: graph courtesy Dick.

In the footnote of his discussion, Fürst, however, unmistakenly spells out that the Las Bocas babies are no exception: "The Olmec were cer tainly interested in infantilism, but it is unclear just where their focus lay. If the interprétation of toothless mouth as that of the toad is correct, 'infants' or dwarfs formerly taken as 'were-jaguars' may be infantile anthropomorphic toads with toad-feline characteris tics" (1981:157). Limiting our remarks to the infant-figurines of Las Bo cas only, this "were-toad" hypothesis of Fürst appears even less attractive than the "were—jaguar" theory of Vaillant and Covarrubias. While the latter was based on the dubious myth of sexual union between jaguar and human and on the presence of downturned mouth, Furst's hypothesis rest solely on the fact that some of the Las Bocas statuettes have no teeth — a feature I ^^Sfres of were-jaguars.

Why the Olmec created and then buried these baby portraitures? - the answer seems to be lost in the clouds of the centuries. It is possible that they represent infants to be sacrificed (Griffin 1981:216), that they may be related to the infantile figures held in the arms of old ladies in the sculptural art of Olmec and other pre Classic cultures (Joralemon 1981:172-173), or they may even be portraitures of mischievous elves, just as Covarrubias suspect (Covarrubias 1957:57). The final solution to this problem should be sought by careful synthesis of solid facts. In conclusion, we postulate that while many Olmec sculptures, ceramic and stone alike, may indeed portray totemic personages, there is no evidence that the group of ceramic statuettes known as the Las Bocas babies are related to jaguar, toad, or any other animal icono graphy. Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that they are portraitures of individuals afflicted with Down's syn drome either. Michael D. Coe once said: "Olmec artists tended to look at everybody as having a little bit of jaguar in him" (1965a:754). Apparently, this statement can also be extended to some of us, students of Mesoamerican anthropology as well. In other words: While some were-jaguars were jaguars, other were jaguars were not. *) After reading this manuscript, Elizabeth Benson agreed with this view and brought up the possibility that they might be portraitures of children of possibly royal birth and the Las Bocas baby statuettes may be "just the equivalent of the modern photograph of a nude ba by on a fur rug"(Elizabeth P. Benson:1982 personal communi cation). References Benson, Elizabeth P.: An Olmec Figure at Dumbarton Oaks. Studies 1976 in Pre-Columbian Art and Archaeology, No. 8.

Zusammenfassung: Über olmekische Kleinkinder und Wer-Jaguare. In Las Bocas, Puebla gefundene bohle Tonfiguren wohlbeleibter, geschlechtslo ser Gestalten werden traditionell als olmekische Wer-Jaguar-Darstellungen gedeutet. Die Wohlbeleibtheit und Geschlechtslosigkeit wird als Downs Syndrom (Mongoloismus) gedeutet. Neuerdings wurde auch behauptet, es handle sich um Wer-Kröten, also Mischwesen aus Mensch und Kröte. Der Verfasser hält dem entgegen, daß die behaupteten Tiermerkmale (Ja guar bzw. Kröte) in den Statuetten nicht vorliegen und daß die menschliche Komponente keine pathologischen, sondern normale stark mongolische Ty penmerkmale darstellt, die man auch bei der heutigen Bevölkerung noch antrifft. Sowohl die Dickleibigkeit als auch die Geschlechtslosigkeit kann einfach mit kulturellen Normen einer Vorliebe für wohlgenährte Kinder und die Bedeutungslosigkeit des Geschlechtes in bestimmten Kunststilen erklärt werden. Resumen: Niños olmecasy jaguares-quien. Tradicionalmente se ha indi cado como olmecas las representaciones-jaguar-quien a las figurillas cavas de arcilla de configuración asexual y obesa que fueron encontradas en Las Bocas, Puebla. Se considera la asexualidady obesidad como el síndroma Downs (mongolismo). Ultimamente se ha afirmado también que se trata de antropoanfibios; es decir de seres mixtos con características humanas y de batracios. El autor sostiene, en cambio, que las características zoomorfas (jaguary anfibio) no existen en las figurillas y que los componentes humanos no pre sentan ningún indicio de carácter patológico sino de tipo normal marcada mente mongólico. Este existe inclusive en la población actual. Tanto la obe sidad como la asexualidad pueden ser simplemente explicadas por normas culturales con una predilección por niños bien alimentados y la insignifi cancia del sexo en determinados estilos artísticos.</page></plain_text>
