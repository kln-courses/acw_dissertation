It was not just an actual human body that was employed in individual portrayals, but also a corporeality which was incorporated in much more complex visual processes. Since the Neolithic human representations were composite part of symbolic embodiment of reality and engaged within the ex plication of the most crucial substantial principles. Such prac tice progressed into a concept of anthropomorphism where hu man body had a major role in asserting the fundamental notions of the material and spiritual environment. Within the concept a realm of visual hybridism was introduced as means of relation ships between human body, household, and nature. Supported by numerous segments of material culture such imagery principle was common in prehistory, but also had huge impact into Clas sical art and religion, and especially within early Christian ico nography. This article considers the symbolic evolution of these visual processes and how they were integrated in sacred texts and images related with the notion of Christ and its representations on mosaics and frescoes.

Its universality and familiarity provide straightforward communication with the individuals involved in cer tain ritual ambiences. Due to various body poses, gesticulations of the extremities, or facial grimaces, messages manifested by the already stated corporeal features are indirectly suggested. Setting the head in definite position, placing the arms in relation to torso, and the emotional expression of the repre sented figure clearly indicate the major principles one culture or religion tends to transpose throughout its own iconography. Therefore, not infrequently, in the pantheon of almost all religions, mythical char acters with actual corporeal attributes are included and incorporated in specific contexts, depending on the ideological milieu of the scene. This kind of visual manipulation with the body in the domain of mythical images emphasizes its importance in the objectification of religious con cepts and explication of the functions that certain represented characters possess. Entering the body in different scenes, gesticulations, and performances generate identities whose repeated presence, based on these performances, create conventions and stan dards (Bailey 2008: 62). The usage of identities within choreography is not only related to actual characters integrated and sacralized in legends and myths, but also to the sphere which clarifies pro cesses present in the human surrounding and nature. In addition, mythical figures whose bodies, by using their concrete biological functions, enlighten the ac tivity and organization of the cosmos are gradually Goce Naumov, adjunct lecturer at St. Cyril and Methodius Uni versity (Skopje, Republic of Macedonia).

This em bodying of the space was present in the domain of the religious definitions of closer human surround ing (the architectonic constructions utilized for liv ing), but also for performing the rites.1 This indi cates the fact that, depending on the context, the body is incorporated in more categories which clas sify the narrative structure of a single religious sys tem. Corporeal features were integrated in stories and images which explicate the cosmogony con cepts, specific relations among figures in the leg ends, the ethical components of the myths, etc. However, the body does not always solely par ticipate in transmitting the religious concepts over a definite media. Sometimes it could be related to other attributes or objects used for intensifying the messages indicated with the body. Not uncommon ly, in many religions there is a methamorphization of the body in other forms, i.e., when hybrid rela tions between actual body parts (or complete body) and some concrete objects, creatures, constructions, or natural elements are produced. Thus, in many cultures, representations of human-animal, human wood, human-mountain, human-spoon, etc., could be often detected. They are mostly present in the painted compositions and sculptural forms such as images, frescoes, illuminations, figurines, vessels, amulets, jewelry, and monuments. These combina tions of the body with other objects emphasize the necessity of inventing specific media which further will elucidate definite complex principles hard to be classified by the body itself. Therefore, actual attributes are added to it or are applied to certain objects, aiming the mutual complement of the fea tures which body and object independently possess. In that case, most often an anthropomorphization of the objects is realized, because human traits could be supplemented. Mainly it arises from the practi cal relation that man has with his own surrounding, so that at least in the frames of religious processes it more easily explicates the function of the objects significant within symbolic communication. On this occasion, the specific relation between man and vessel is of particular significance, the one which on single place unifies two very power ful and similar semiotic components. On one hand, the body is accented, its complexity is manifested through its gesticulations, its capability to regener ate, and its voluminosity as represented on the ves sels. On the other hand, due to the equivalent volu minosity and outline, the vessels are identified with the human body. In this context, their ability to ac 1 Cremo(2008);Chausidis( 1994: 200-213);Chausidis,Rahno, and Naumov (2008); Naumov (2007). Goce Naumov cumulate and store groceries is of major importance which, similar to the human abdomen, is symboli cally realized through the concept of regeneration. Although far from the religious spheres, even ar chaeologists still instinctively react to the excep tional similarity among body and vessel. Very often during the analysis of pottery found on excavations, concerning the specific part of the fragmented or complete vessels archaeologists use terms which are associated with the human body (Naumov 2008). Thus, concrete parts of the pot are referred to as "mouth," "neck," "belly," "shoulder," "foot," etc. This subconscious or maybe assumed interaction among human perception and vessel features orig inate from prehistory. The relation of this type is spreading continuously during the Classical period and the Middle Ages, its manifestations having its source in archaic forms of cultures inhabiting Af rica, Europe, South America, etc. (Naumov 2006). Although seemingly far from these principles of vi sual hybridism, even early forms of Christianity as well as definite segments of Byzantine iconography in the Balkans recognize a symbolic equalization of major Christian figures (Jesus and the Virgin) with vessels or objects used for water (Naumov 2009: 66). On numerous mosaics and capitals from the a.D. 4th to the 6th century, explicit scenes were pro duced, where Christ is represented as a vessel filled with water or plants (grapevine). Peacocks or deer drinking water are flanking the vessel, so that this scene is considered as an imagery interpretation of 42nd King David's Psalm (Dimitrova 2007: 66). In a later period, the iconographical transformations within Byzantine art concretize this theme and with several authentic figures transfer it on the frescoes located in apsidal part of the church (Dimitrova 2001:48). The practice of creating conceptual relations be tween the human body and other elements present within architectonic space or nature is not unfamil iar for the Byzantine art. In some mosaics and fres coes, the body could be combined with rivers or caves thus generating personifications of particular geographical space which have a definite role in the narration of a painted scene. This construction of figurative simulacra and hypostasis of specific con cepts (Wisdom) or wider approximate space (Earth, Hell), not rarely is accompanied with anthropomor phic or zoomorphic representations (Panic i Babic 1975: 70-75; Zorova 2012). Regarding this icono graphie form, the early Christian variant of Jesus as a vessel (kantharos), i.e., "the source of life" is not surprising. It might be considered that in these ear ly phases, the hybridism within iconography was a reasonable continuity of Classical traditions, but Anthropos 108.2013</page><page sequence="3">The Objectified Corporeality 99 also an announcement of what later would spread number of anthropomorphic vessels inside which throughout Christian art "under the veil." remains of child skeletons were buried,3 while some Nevertheless, this very complex and later rare anthropomorphic vessels without a head representa Christian iconographie concept would not be com- tion or those with a deliberately broken "head" are prehensively clarified if the chronological continu- associated with the decapitation of deceased bod ity of vessel anthropomorphization and the impie- ies (Gheorghiu 2001: 81; Ralph 2007: 309 - later mentation of certain pottery features on mythical reminiscences). characters from preceding periods are not broadly This funerary context was parallel manifested presented.

This imagery dynamism additionally confirms that the body was symbolically a most appropriate media through which the ritual functionality of cer tain space is clarified, but also a medium for mani festing vital corporal principles (pregnancy, child bearing, growing, and dying).

Anthropos 108.2013</page><page sequence="7">The Objectified Corporeality Although human figures applied on the pottery were present as well as in the prehistory, it should be em phasized that their presence on the Classical ves sels explains more thoroughly the functions and role of mythical characters and religious ideas they maintain. As a result of this accentuated (in some instances traditional) communication through the human body, ceramic and metal vessels were produced with very precisely executed facial features.8 Equally male and female individuals were represented on them, thus inducing some authors to define them as myth ical figures (Chausidis 2009; Kitov 1999: 21; Jana kievski 1998: 25). Some of these characters were in directly associated with death, especially those with negroid faces modeled on the vessel surface (Chausi dis 2009). In that context, several balsamaries (ves sels containing oil/liquid to anoint the body of the departed) can be included, whose corpus consist ed of two negroid heads joined together (Chausidis 2009). Although recently there are no familiar an thropomorphic vessels used for burying the cremat ed remains, the examples above still induce that they were related to funerary rites throughout the Classi cal period. As it can be noticed, certain figures mod eled on the vessels were mythical representatives of death, or, as was the case in the other parts of Europe, perhaps real portraits of the deceased individuals. This type of body hybridism (particularly the head) with the objects, which were often present in the surrounding of the Classical populations, not only was manifested on the level of the vessels. In the Roman era, numerous ceramic and metal lucer nae (lamps) were produced, with the represented hu man heads from whose mouth the light of the lamp appears.9 It is also considered that these represen tations belong to characters deriving from Hellenic or Roman mythology (Dionysus, Eros, etc.), or yet again were part of the funerary customs related to negroid figures.10 In the domain of the hybridization of negroid heads and their burial context, also Hel lenistic earrings are included, on whose top a head of a black man is applied (Chausidis 2009; Ivano vski 2006: 176; Bitrakova-Grozdanova 1987: 73). There are examples where the body of these ear rings was modeled as a figure of Nike, also found as grave goods in Hellenistic necropolises (Ivanovski 2006: 179). 8 See Fig. 3: 1-6.

Anthropos 108.2013 103 In the sphere of Classical hybrid representations, personifications of definite geographic space (river, mountain, city) are also integrated, which in differ ent imagery media were depicted through the hu man body. This visual feature will be implemented within administrative-symbolic mediation through the coins, and particularly in the region where later in the early Christian period the repertoire of an thropomorphic personifications would be devel oped. As example can be considered the coins from the Roman city of Stobi (nowadays Republic of Macedonia), on whose reverse two male figures as personifications of the rivers Axios and Erigon were represented (Lilcic 1995: 61). In the region of the Roman province Epirus Nova (nowadays partly in the Republic of Macedonia), in the period from 4th till 6th century, there was a production of mosaics with Christian scenes where some rivers were il lustrated as personifications (Bitrakova-Grozdanova 1975: 52). This Classical imagery tradition would continue further in Christian iconography. Despite the definite visual principles existing in this period of the Middle Ages and classified or suggested through erminias,n the context in which the human body is included would go apart from the standards of Christian dogma. Firmly based on Classical visu al principles, some of the most important characters in Christianity would be symbolically incorporated within concepts of anthropomorphic and objectified substitutions. In addition, their specific corporeality would be entirely attached to gnoseological catego ries which very subtly explain the complex role and function of these figures in Christian iconography. Corporal and Objectified Substitutions within Christian Iconography It is well known that the Christian iconography is solidly founded on precisely determined norms of visual expressions. Almost all of the mosaics, fres coes, and icons illustrate something which is previ ously established, very often through imagery man uals (erminias), although in different stages of the Middle Ages there are variations and developments of certain scenes (Korunovski i Dimitrova 2006). In the domain of these iconographie standards, con centrated on the most dominant visual media in Christianity, very frequently hagiographical scenes were painted. With the selection of several details definite significant segments from the life of Jesus, the Virgin, or saints, meritorious for Christianity, 11 Erminia is a medieval manual with instructions for painting frescoes.</page><page sequence="8">104 were depicted. Beside the illustrations of their life cycles, these characters were often portrayed in particular positions, thus suggesting their symbolic functions. These scenes are organized and disposed in several fields or zones, painted on the walls of de termined interior parts (rarely onto the exterior) of the temples. Such a defined iconography is present in almost all of the Christian churches and basili cas throughout the whole Middle Ages of Southeast Europe. Its bright imagery narrative enabled direct visual communication with the participants in the church rituals, as well as their introduction to the most crucial segments of the Christian ideology.12 Hence, in the framework of this rich iconography more complex ideas were implemented requiring a visual canal for their manifestation. Definite con cepts, associated with the semantic quality of Chris tian characters as well as to more abstract gnoseo logical categories, were depicted through concrete representations, not always described in the er minias or within the official interpretations of the churches commissioning frescoes or mosaics. These images surely supplemented the more subtle sym bolic significances of certain figures or areas, at the same time not excluding the common notions relat ed to them. Because Christianity frequently uses the human body as media for expressing the essential religious ideas, it was actively employed within the objectifying of more abstract but symbolically po tent cognitive components. In addition, during their "embodying," the Heavenly Rivers, Hell, Earth, or Wisdom, were often represented through personi fications depicted with the human body (Panic i Babic 1975: 71-74; Zorova 2012), which shall be broadly elaborated below. These anthropomorphic or objectified substi tutes were manifested throughout two directions. In the first case, as it was already stated, the body was symbolically applied to definite notions or area (space), thus defining or simplifying their implica tion. That way, throughout linking a concrete figure to such a notion or space, an image is created with which they will be visually distinguished and eas ily included into the rich narration of the Christian iconography. But, in the other case, it realized an opposite process of accenting the definite semantic connotations, specific for some Christian characters. Intentionally, their body is represented more ab stractly, so that in some instance they were "objec tified." In that context, the body has been replaced 12 Broadly for the elements of the Christian iconography see Lazarev (1967); Haussig (1971); Djuric (1974); Subotic (1980); Rasolkoska-Nikoloska (2004); Korunovski i Dimi trova (2006). Goce Naumov by the concrete object which symbolically equalizes its actual functions with the essential significances of the character represented by it. Sometimes, that object is positioned in immediate close relation with the authentic figure, so that in the vicinity of this character an object is painted with which he/she was semantically identified (in the earlier iconographical phases or old manuscripts). This second aspect of objectified substitutes again brings us back towards prehistoric and Clas sical traditions when the "objectification" of the hu man body was performed through employing the actual and conceptual features of vessels.13 No mat ter the temporal distance, but considering the per ceptional and iconographical continuity on certain area (The Balkans), this common principle was not neglected in the Christianity. Particularly in the pe riod of early Christianity, a vessel not rarely was as sociated with the symbolic significance of Jesus. In later stages, it was iconographically modified and even incorporated within the representations of the Virgin. In addition, their relationship with the se mantics of the vessel was absolutely attached onto the functions and role they had in the initiation and dissemination of Christianity. Early Iconographical Representations of Christ as Vessel In the period from a.D. 4th to 6th century, in great parts of the Roman Empire and its Balkan provinc es, mosaics, frescoes, and reliefs describing differ ent variants of Christian scenes were produced in side basilicas.14 Mainly, they represent life phases of Jesus or depict events quoted in the Bible. The rep ertoire consisting of the means of expression used for illustrating these scenes usually depends on the place where they were disposed. If they were paint ed on the walls, human figures frequently dominate in their imagery narration. But if these scenes were produced on the floor mosaics, parapet plates, or the capitals on the columns, then means of expression were used which do not include human corporeality. As substitution to these individuals, bodies of various animals and objects were placed suggest ing the actual or symbolic character of the believers 13 Although in the prehistoric traditions such a substitution was developed onto the concept of hybridism when the actual vessel was combined with definite parts of the human body, so providing a both visual process of vessel's anthropomor phization and objectification of certain individual or mythical characters. 14 See Fig. 4; see also Cvetkovic-Tomasevic (1978); Aleksova (1995); Dimitrova (2006); Liläic (2002).

On the one hand, despite the frescoes, mo saics were not completely visible during the cere monies practiced inside basilicas. In that occasion, the believers standing on mosaics were not capable to realize direct and long-term visual communica tion with the current scenes, as it was the case with those depicted high on the frescoes.16 On the other 15 Broadly for the elements of the early Christian iconography see Dimitrova (1995). 16 Only during the entry in the temple, a transient visual contact Anthropos 108.2013 105 hand, the actual standing on the mosaics resulted from the construction of definite ethical and visual parameters for the representation of the Christian characters. Since it was probably inconvenient to with the scenes and details on the mosaic floor was feasible. After the filling of the interior with the believers, it was al most impossible these mosaics to be observed in its entirety. It could be considered that during the ceremonies, without re gard to the participants, mosaic scenes had the role symboli cally to stimulate this place in realization of its essential func tions, i.e., the gathering and enlightening of the believers. As it should be elaborated below, particularly these scenes indirectly represented Christianization and incorporation of Christian spirit within the catechumens (new believers).</page><page sequence="10">106 step onto the authentic bodies of presented figures, somehow their presence on the mosaics should be "mitigated" with a substitution for their bodies.17 In addition, this replacement should be in some seman tic analogy with the body, character, and functions of the represented figure. In that context, instead of Christ's body commonly a vessel was placed, which was a symbolic equivalent of his essence. This is confirmed by numerous mosaics regis tered in the Republic of Macedonia and abroad. In this occasion, several examples will be presented which clearly address the incorporation of few icon ographical concepts into the sphere of symbolic vi sual communication. Recently, the most preserved mosaics are evidenced in Heraclea Lynkestis, Stobi, and Lychnidos, Classical cities in the Roman prov inces Macedonia Secunda and Epirus Nova, which were urban centers on this territory in the period of early Christianity.18 Frequently the mosaics rather were placed in basilicas than in their supplementa ry rooms (baptisteria) and episcopal residencies as well in the palaces of the wealthy citizens. Although there are variations in the selection of the patterns and decoration, still the repertoire of the zoomorphic and vegetative representations is almost always unified. Most often in the central scene doves, peacocks, does, deer, lambs, water, and grapevine are symmetrically disposed around or appear out of the primary pattern - vessel, spring, tree (Fig. 4; Dimitrova 1995; Cvetkovic-Tomasevic 1978). Particularly this scene and all forms of pat terns depicted in it are the most familiar in the early Christian representations used for emphasizing the baptismal, eucharistie, soteriological, and eschato logical role of Jesus. In such way every pattern had its own symbolic connotation and function in the vi sual transposition of the 42nd Psalm of King David. Through this psalm Christ is indicated as "Well of Life" from whom catechumens drink in an attempt to give their soul to God and to obtain his eternal protection (Dimitrova 2007: 66). On the mosaics and capitals, the central pattern represented Christ as "Tree of Life" or "Divine Well" whose water is deposited inside kantharos or goblet (Fig. 4). From these vessels sometimes grapevine appears repre 17 Surely this was far from an only practical solution. On the contrary, the avoiding of anthropomorphic figures on mosaics and the favorization of vegetative and zoomorphic represen tations was entirely in the direction of Christian interpreta tions of the Bible. The repertoire consisting means of expres sion on mosaics was reasonably integrated into the Christian iconography and indubitably symbolically justified the space for their position. 18 Broadly for these cities and mosaics produced in them see Bitrakova-Grozdanova (1975); Aleksova (1995); Mikulcic (2003, 2007); Gjorgievska (2007). Goce Naumov senting Christ's sacrifice, i.e., his blood used for communion of the believers. Most often the believ ers are represented as zoomorphic figures (doves, peacocks, lambs, deer) flanking the vessel and sug gesting ideas with regard to scenes which should depict the role of Christ as savior, protector, or sac rifice (Dimitrova 2007: 67-74). In context with this type of iconography, the presence of a vessel had an exceptionally important function. In almost all the scenes where it is depict ed, the illustrated animals or birds always are sym metrically concentrated around it and drink from it or consume the appearing vegetation. The vessel, of ten in the shape of kantharos, chalice, or goblet, rep resents the space in which salutary water (Christ's essence) is deposited or grapevine (Christ's blood) grows. By means of these substances, the vessel is indirectly designated as Christ's body in which the whole Christian fundamental nature was accu mulated, that way incorporated into the believers through their "consuming" of the Christ's ideal. In sertion of the vessel in these scenes was necessary for the visual embodying of Christ's existence and the symbolic function he had in spreading his teach ing. Hence, his imagery equalization with the ves sel was in semantic relationship with the actual fea tures of this object (to contain that which maintains the spiritual subsistence of particular communities or populations).19 The visual identification of Jesus with vessels could be followed iconographically throughout the whole period of early Christianity in Europe. Al though this semantic relationship was indirectly in dicated, nevertheless, explicit patterns for defining this imagery concept were used in the later phases. In the first half of the 6th century, the vessel was en riched with motifs or a symbol designating Christ. On one of the mosaics from the episcopal basilica in Heraclea Lyncestis, the kantharos juxtapositioned by a deer is placed on the platform of a triple stair 19 In early Christian iconography, usage of elements which as serted the more complex notions or spaces was not rarely practiced. Beside the application of symbols, in the mosaics from this period also personifications were presented, which through human body signified some definite space. Thus, in the mosaics from the north chapel in the tetra-concave ba silica in Lychnidos (Republic of Macedonia) (Fig. 5: 1), hu man heads with flowing water were represented as person ification of the Heavenly Rivers Pison, Gihon, Tigris, and Euphrates (Bitrakova-Grozdanova 1975: 52). These early Christian traditions particularly will be developed within the medieval frescoes, where the repertoire of anthropomorphic personifications will be in abundance with representations of rivers, Earth, celestial bodies, months, and conversely, with numerous objects as attributes or préfigurations referred to exact Christian characters (Panic i Babic 1975: 71-74; Zo rova 2012).

In an attempt to accent her life-giving role, the foundation for compositional development of she was iconographically indirectly identified with this iconographie form.

Though these verses assert her relation with the spring (water), i.e., life giving, still in the same context the symbolism of the vessel is used as space where life is "kept" and later appears out of it. The medieval liturgical poetry, as well as its visu al manifestations, were abundant with phrases and motifs used for underlining the equalization of the Virgin with the vessel or some other object and the construction with enclosed space. In the sermon for the celebration dedicated to the birth of Jesus, Saint John Damascene (8th century) as well as Andreas of Crete (8th century) compares the Virgin with a vase or candlestick (Gabelic 1998: 176). Actually, for the celebration of the Virgin's Dormition, in his first homily, Saint John Damascene described almost all préfigurations, attributes, and epithets of the Virgin. This author, as some others during the 6th to the 9th century, in creating literary metaphors contributed to the Virgin, very often used the visions of saints from the Old Testament which announced her ar rival (Gabelic 1998: 177). There the Virgin was fre quently identified with items which imply particu lar enclosed objects (vase, chest, candlestick, tent, temple, tabernacle, or boat/vessel) as well as with objects which indirectly indicate her virginity and role in the "descending" of Christ upon the Earth (ladder or door). In the context of her comparison with a vessel, there are literary works where in the described visions Aaron saw the Virgin as amphora and scepter, while Zachariah recognized her as gold en censer. These authors, indicating the symbolic function and the significance of her body, also used visions from other saints in which she was identi fied with objects intended to receive people in their interior. Thus they referred to visions of, e.g., Solo mon who saw the Virgin as a temple; that of David in which she was perceived as a tent; and the vision of Habakkuk where he identifies her as a boat/vessel (Panic i Babic 1975: 77; Gabelic 1998: 175). The usage of textual models for imagery de piction of Christian scenes is also concentrated in the Old Testament. One of the Solomon phrases in "Song of Solomon" used for describing his be loved as "closed spring, sealed well" is considered to be an inspiration for painting the details posi tioned within the scene of the Annunciation (Groz danov i Hadermann-Misguich 1992: 56). Namely, in a scene from Kurbinovo (Republic of Macedo nia), on the top of a house, a closed vessel in the garden is represented as an allusion to the quota tion from "Song of Solomon" (Fig. 6: 6). The visual substitution of quotation motifs (spring, well) with the motive on the painted scene (vessel) clearly in dicates the intention to equalize the Virgin and her Goce Naumov maidenly nature with the enclosed vessel. Similar scenes were illustrated in several churches from the Balkans where she is painted in the vicinity of a ves sel or well in the moment when Archangel Gabriel announces the good news to her. Analogous indications, where the semantic rela tionship between Virgin and vessel is indirectly ex pressed, were accentuated in the scenes of several texts and frescoes in connotation with Moses or his visions of the Holy Virgin. Within the description of Moses' vision in the manuscript of Cosmas Indi copleustes (6th century), the "burning bush" (usual the préfiguration of the Virgin) was replaced by a vessel (Fig. 6: 5), thus clearly suggesting the pres ence of the Virgin (Ainalov 1961: 29, 31, Fig. 14). This variation of an allusion from the Old Testament has been confirmed in one of the Moses representa tions in Manasia (Serbia), where he holds a vessel in his hand, on which the Virgin in the pose of orant is painted (Fig. 6: 4). A detailed visual equalization with a vessel recently is the most potent symbolic illustration of her essential function - to give birth and hold inside herself the one which will be "sus tenance for those who want to satiate their spirit." Developing an apparently atypical concept was not out of iconographical norms which were applied in Christian art. On the contrary, visual as well as lit erary identification of the Virgin with a vessel were in the domain of expressive means, which in the Middle Ages were constantly used for the descrip tion or concretization of particular features, specifi cally for the saints or space (Earth, rivers, celestial bodies), included within represented scenes. Con sequently, there were two visual principles devel oped and employed for the objectification of these complex characteristics. In the first one, a human or animal body was used to define the presence and role of some Christian figures, more abstract space, or notion. Thus as animal attributes were used: lion, eagle, bull (for evangelists), dove (Holy Spirit), dragon (Hell's pharynx), mermaid (sea), etc. Most often the human body was applied to describe per sonifications which represented human soul (baby), river (old man with vessel), sea (girl on sea ani mal or mermaid), Earth (woman with linen), wind (boy with horn), desert (boy with pedestal/vessel), Golgotha (skull of Adam), God's wisdom, Sofia and Truth (female figure with wings), as well as the anthropomorphic representations and allegories of sun, moon, months, day, i.e., New Testament, night, i.e., Old Testament, etc.22 22 Panic i Babic (1975: 70-74); Zorova (2012).
