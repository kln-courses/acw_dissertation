<plain_text><page sequence="1">Here There Be Monsters. Joseph D. Andriano. Immortal Monster: The Mythological Evolution of the Fantastic Beast in Modem Fiction and Film. Greenwood, 1999. xix + 179 pp. $55 cloth. Literary and cultural teratologies, at least when they focus on science fiction, tend to locate the genesis of the sf monster somewhere around Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818), when the supernatural and alchemical beasts of earlier Gothic fiction gave way to man-made marauders and science-induced transformations. But there is a much older tradition that has had at least a comparable impact on pop monsterdom, and it is this tradition-the legend of the leviathan or behemoth-that provides the focus for Joseph D. Andriano's often provocative Immortal Monster, whose subtitle suggests a far more ambitious and encyclopedic approach than the book actually delivers. It's not uncommon for a monograph's aims to be far more modest than its title, but in this case it's probably just as well, since the textual universe Andriano wants to explore ranges broadly from Melville, Pynchon, and John Gardner to killer whale movies such as Orca (1977) and shlock classics such as The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954). Any attempt to comprehensively explain the "mythological evolution" of such a range of literary and cinematic monsters would be the work of a lifetime, much of it spent watching cheesy videotapes of unwatchable movies. Andriano wisely delimits his purview in two ways: by focusing principally on what he calls "leviathanic texts" (of which his archetype is Moby-Dick [1851]), and by offering an introductory disclaimer that he is attempting not to trace exhaustively any one theme, but rather to explore "paradigmatic" texts "that seem to redefine the monster in a way that influences other texts, which I then also consider" (xv-xvi). More often than not, those "other texts" turn out to be movies, so that (for example) when Andriano discusses Wells's The Island of Dr. Moreau (1896), he spends most of the chapter analyzing the differences among the three film versions, but feels no need to mention later literary treatments of the tale from Brian Aldiss, Gene Wolfe, and others; nor, save for a brief discussion of Gravity's Rainbow (1973), does he mention the considerable literary heritage of King Kong (1933). Conversely, the one film that would establish a firm link between Moby-Dick, many of these later</page><page sequence="2">316 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 27 (2000) movies, and the science-fictional notion of the leviathan in outer space (an idea Andriano explores only tentatively) is missing from the discussion altogether: this is the 1956 John Huston/Ray Bradbury film of the Melville novel, which later prompted Bradbury to write a radio space-opera version of the same tale. There are, in other words, some odd omissions even by the terms Andriano has set out, and some equally odd inclusions. After discussing Moby-Dick, Jaws (1975) and its descendants, the King Kong movies, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon, Andriano radically shifts gears into a discussion of John Gardner's Grendel (1971), because the monster's mere supposedly fills a thematic role similar to that of the Black Lagoon. But then, are we meant to view Grendel as a kind of high-culture response to the same late-capitalist mythic impulse that gave us Jack Arnold movies? It's an intriguing proposition, but it's never quite developed or persuasively articulated. Again, there is a whole cluster of pop-culture redactions of the Beowulf tale (including a novel by Michael Crichton) that goes unmentioned as the chapter slides instead into an X-Files episode about an Appalachian lake monster, which is linked to the Loch Ness monster, whose rich cultural history also goes unexamined. In terms of its coverage, then, the book opens far more avenues than it is willing to explore, and sometimes settles too easily for cataloging the failures of manifestly awful movies such as King Kong Lives (1986). As a guide to its putative subject, then, Immortal Monster is a bit limited in scope, and like a number of recent studies of post-Gothic traditions, it tends to view twentieth- century pop culture more through the lens of movies than through literary traditions, even the traditions of genre fiction. But a good deal of what it lacks in breadth is more than made up in the compelling substance of Andriano's major theses. Essentially, Andriano sees these various leviathan tales as post-Darwinian versions of ancient monster stories, with the evolutionary perspective leading to a tension between anthropomorphism and bestialization, between the more rigidly hierarchical ancient "Ladder of Being" and the more complexly organized Darwinian "bushy Tree of Life." This evolutionary perspective also leads to what Andriano sees as a continuing undercurrent of racism or racial anxiety in many of these texts-a theme that has often been noted in Moby-Dick or the King Kong movies, but which Andriano also links to Peter Benchley's Jaws (1974) and Beast (1991) by noting some telling differences between novel and film versions, and between the original film of Jaws and its sequels (1978, 1983, 1987). This theme, in fact, is what powers the first several chapters of the book, which falls into three general parts. The first two chapters discuss Moby-Dick and its more or less direct heirs in Peter Benchley's Jaws, Spielberg's film of that novel, the lame whale film Orca, and Benchley's Beast (produced as a TV-movie in 1996); the next two chapters deal with King Kong, its sequels, remakes, and variations (such as Mighty Joe Young [1949] and Congo [1995]); the next three chapters treat more-or-less freestanding variations on the theme, such as the Black Lagoon movies, Gardner's Grendel, and Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and its three movie versions (1932, 1977, 1996). A final chapter introduces a huge new concept of particular relevance</page><page sequence="3">BOOKS IN REVIEW 317 to sf-the effect on these evolutionary myths of the human-machine relation- ships as explored in Gravity's Rainbow-but explores the idea almost cursorily and with little hint of the enormous range of potentially relevant texts. Andriano foreshadows this final chapter by mentioning technology at various points earlier in the book; but some of these mentions seem pretty strained, as when he claims that the planes that bring down King Kong, since they have pilots in them, are early versions of cyborgs, foreshadowing the next evolutionary step just as Kong's world suggested an earlier stage of evolution. Similarly, he occasionally falls into the trap-not unusual in discussions of popular film-of ascribing his own intellectual arguments to the filmmakers he is discussing. Of the 1976 remake of King Kong, he writes, "The filmmakers are primarily concerned with using the metonymic image of Kong as generic ape to explore the relationship between human beings and other primate species" (69). Throughout, Andriano has made an interesting distinction between the metaphoric and metonymic uses of monsters, but it strikes me as highly unlikely that DeLaurentis and company were "primarily concerned" with this sort of thing at all. Similarly, a famous line from Island of Lost Souls (the 1933 film version of The Island of Dr. Moreau)-"the natives are restless tonight"-becomes evidence that the film "thus draws an ethical parallel between capturing animals and colonizing human beings" (138). This claim rests on the fact that the natives aren't really natives at all, but altered animals, so why would Dr. Moreau call them "natives" unless the screenwriters intended such a parallel? The much simpler answer-which Andriano acknowledges-is that Moreau merely wants his visitors to think the animals are natives. Still, Andriano's template of anthropomorphism vs. bestialization, of the Ladder of Being vs. the Tree of Life, is clearly thought out in theoretical terms, and provides a useful and revealing way of approaching a wide variety of texts in the leviathanic tradition. Moreover, Andriano's insightful linking of this evolutionary theme with such problematic issues in American culture as racial anxiety, while not entirely original (certainly the racial subtext of King Kong has long been observed, though few other authors have made such connections with Jaws), is provocative enough that one wishes he might have explored it further. A sure sign of Andriano's acumen as a critic is that one comes away from Immortal Monster wondering what he might have made of more recent novels such as Benchley's White Shark (1994)-which encapsulates many of Andriano's major themes, from leviathan to cyborg-or films such as Deep Blue Sea (1999). But then again, White Shark-a pretty bad novel, but no worse than some films Andriano discusses-dates from 1994, and might easily have been mentioned had Andriano cast his net a little further. Immortal Monster offers enough new insights and intelligent readings to make it easily worth the attention of anyone interested in the etiology of pop- culture monsters, but one worries that a good deal of the landscape Andriano hopes to map may still be terra incognita to his own research: here there be monsters indeed, and in far greater abundance than this intelligent map suggests. -Gary K.
