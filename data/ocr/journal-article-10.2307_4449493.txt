<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANIMALS-NATURE ~~It The Moon by Whale Light; and Other Adventures Among Bats, Penguins, Crocodilians, and Whales. By Diane A. Ackerman. 1991. Random House (New York, NY 10022). 249 pp. Cloth $20. We try to understand ourselves and our place in this world by looking at other creatures whose designs and be- haviors are shaped and governed by the ineluctable evolutionary forces that determine our form and function. In studying how other animals cope with environmental challenges, we are constrained by the very senses and perceptions which restrict under- standing to the parameters of our hu- man dimensions. This is the conun- drum that never quite allows closure to our questions, and piques our curi- osity about all the peculiar characteris- tics of the past and present fantastic creatures of our world. With unrepressed enthusiasm, Diane Ackerman tackles the task of observing, examining, researching, reminiscing and reporting on four dif- ferent groups of animals-bats, croco- dilians, whales and penguins. At- tracted by the unknown and challenged to reach out and touch these exotic animals, this award- winning poet and nature writer re- flects our very human and secret de- sire to possess, control and under- stand the seemingly inaccessible. Ravenous to apprehend the mental and physical nature of these verte- brates, she immerses herself in her study and reports her impressions with great feeling. Library research and the guidance of expert specialists season and modulate these associa- tions into a very readable narrative. In studying these animals, Acker- man yearns to see into their conscious- ness and uncover what and how they think. In searching for a window into the animals' minds, she primes all her senses to forge some sort of com- munication. Where these efforts prove elusive, she continues to seek other perceptual clues. Happily, her experi- ences with these animals reaffirm their uniqueness, but the message gained from this inaccessibility is that myster- ies will continue to haunt and provoke the human observer. Ackerman writes about little-known animals because of her fascination with life: "There is no animal that isn't fascinating if viewed up close and in detail." Each of the four chapters weaves facts with details of the au- thor's encounters and impressions. 314 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 54, NO. 5, MAY 1992</page><page sequence="2">She joins research groups and engages in the daily activities of tracking and recording. With a flair for ignoring thick technical terminology, she blends everyday words into descrip- tively colorful contextual portraits. As you read, you will agree that bats are "shy and winsome creatures who have just had a bad press." Bats, otherwise known as chiropterans, are applauded as natural pesticides with amazing adaptations for navigating and feeding. While bats are rapidly being destroyed, these amazing hand- winged forms make up nearly a quar- ter of all the world's mammals; and for their size, they're the longest-lived mammal on earth. Crocodilians are fondly introduced as "mesozoic leftovers." Lacking visi- ble sex determining chromosomes, these "living relics" depend on phys- ical temperature to set their sex; eggs developed at temperatures at or above 94 F produce males; those incubated at or below 86 F yield females. The word alligator is a derivative of the Spanish el legarto, meaning "the lizard." In reading descriptive inserts in our biology textbook, my students were awed by the details explicitly stated in the chapter on whales. The blue whale, noted as the largest animal ever to exist on earth, has a tongue of elephantine weight and a heart with a mass of several tons. "And though we picture whales wobbling with blubber to keep warm, a whale's real problem is staying cool." A killed whale can quickly become a "burnt whale" since the decaying animal generates so much heat that the energy can readily disintegrate its bones. The whales' songs have been captured on records, and the sound of its rhythms and rhymes enthrall the human listener. Although accessible to human audi- tory receptors, the messages in ceta- cean music continue to elude us. Senses are specific for the species; can humans transcend these barriers? Penguins, those caricatured tuxe- doed dwarfs, are called the most an- thropomorphic of all animals since ev- eryone identifies with them. Although penguins are flightless birds that com- ically waddle on land, "they do indeed fly." They fly through the water to feed or to escape predators. "Penguins are watertight and airtight and thought to have more feathers than any other bird." This is a book that will please animal lovers from seventh grade on and in- trigue general readers of all ages. It will trigger the imagination of the non- specialist and may convince a science- alienated population that, when probed sensibly by asking the right questions, biology, the discipline that deals with life, actually is the most exciting of studies. Pedantic biologists may mutter that the writing reeks of anthropomorphism, but the delighted fan will say this writer picks up on the pertinent and that her impressions and reactions craft the words into ap- pealing paragraphs. It is Ackerman's humanistic approach that enriches this scientific story. We attempt to see our world in many ways, and these essays combine poetry and science, personal- ity and facts, and individual world view with illusory reality. At a time when we cry for public awareness of science, we need more writers who can combine craftsmanship with words to make the public more con- scious of the "secret" wonders of na- ture.
