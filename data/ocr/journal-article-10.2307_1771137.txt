<plain_text><page sequence="1">JULES MIICELET: NATURE, HISTORY, AND LANGUAGE. By Linda Orr. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1976. xvi, 215 p. The subject of this fascinating study is the mythical model in Michelet, which, Professor Orr shows, is fragmented throughout the Histoire de France, but emerges more clearly and intact in Michelet's books on nature. In her close analy- sis of four of them-L'Oiseau (1856), L'Insecte (1857), La Mer (1861), and La Montagne (1868)-Orr uses techniques of recent French literary criticism to explain why Michelet's interest shifted from history to nature in the 1850s and what he thought he discovered in nature. Her answer to the first question is that the passionately revolutionary Michelet, in poor health and in despair over the events of 1848, could no longer find in history the conceptual categories and pro- phetic language that would enable him "to write the book that would subvert its own existence and explode into action" (p. 6). As historian, Michelet had always believed that language itself was a form of action; and, in the tradition of Kant, that great history was prophetic history. Orr's answer to the second question is that Michelet discovered in Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire's version of metamorphosis the key to solving the problems that were retarding his Histoire de France: "the nature of time, the function of continuity and discontinuity in change, and the limits of history itself" (p. 14). The replacement of revolution by metamorphosis in Michelet's thought in the 1850s enabled him to construct a dialectic between nature and history that united the numerous groupings of opposites that underlay his perception of reality: life/death, subject/object, past/present, individual/hu- manity, nature/man, and others. Michelet proceeded on the assumption that nature, being more constant and less cluttered by fact and event than history, was the ideal field in which to ob- serve metamorphosis at work because it allows the observer to perceive the basic structure, the morphology of reality as a whole (both natural and human). Ed- mund Wilson suggested that Michelet turned to natural history when "the doings of human beings began to seem [to him] to have more in common with the doings of insects and birds" (To the Finland Station, p. 31). Orr goes a step farther and shows what Michelet meant by men's acting like insects and birds, and in what respects he thought that the latter's actions resemble those of human beings. She points out that Michelet's nature books "seem to fulfill two contradictory func- tions. They provided an obvious release, a freer genre of expression, but they also opened up some patterns that rendered history almost intolerable: they re- made the same discoveries. Nature, in fact, becomes the combination utopia/tor- ture that was history, with one major difference: the fullness of this complex vision is restored, its dynamics are clearer. History is nature, in which the smaller history of France operates" (pp. 95-96). However, the real metamorphosis, Orr argues, in the most perceptive and original part of her book, takes place not in nature, but in Michelet's own writings. Metamorphosis led him to describe reality metaphorically. And his metaphorical perception of reality prefigured such contemporary theorists as Roland Barthes, 183</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Michel Foucault, and especially Gaston Bachelard, who admired and was influ- enced by Michelet, and whose critical techniques Orr uses in her own analysis. "For Michelet and Bachelard," she says, "the distinction between reality and the mind's eye, imagination, is not so clear" (p. 34). The reason for this lack of clarity was only implicit in Michelet, but became explicit in Bachelard's theory of the relationship between science and poetry. Bachelard held that philosophy of science should not begin by asking what can be known, but rather by asking what science in fact already knows. He insisted that nothing is verified decisively by induction; rather, the history of science demonstrates that knowledge is produced primarily by negation, by falsification. Science works by refuting immediate ex- perience and common sense, which enables it to transcend its own theoretical frameworks. In La Formation de l'esprit scientifique, La Philosophie du non, and elsewhere, Bachelard argued cogently that the production of knowledge through a progressive falsification of such privileged images (or "epistemological ob- stacles," as he called them) is what makes science a dynamic, dialectical activity. For Bachelard, poetry was the converse of science in this respect. In La Terre et les reveries de la Volonte', La Poetique de l'espace, and elsewhere, he showed how the privileged images which he studied as epistemological obstacles to science could become, with a change of perspective, manifestations of a basic affective and mythological universe explored by poetry. Bachelard's theory of poetry as the converse of science, Orr hypothesizes, was already implicit in Michelet. Thus, Michelet did not begin his description of the spider, for example, from a definition fixed by scientific observation, but from a definition established by lan- guage usage and literary tradition. His description then transforms that definition (the epistemological obstacle) so that "horror at the sight of an odious monster is converted into pity and sympathy" (p. 124). Orr shows how Michelet's spider evolves, through metamorphosis, from a monster into "an artisan, a solitary spin- ning fairy, an industrial worker, a small businessman, changing again into one of the three Fates and, finally, into a mother. The puffed, ugly, selfish one turned into a selfless skeleton" (p. 151). Michelet's anthropomorphic description of the spider is, of course, not scientific. But it is the converse of a scientific description in the Bachelardian sense that it refutes the privileged image of the spider as a monster and creates a new image, which, after Michelet exhausts its mythical possibilities, becomes in turn, like his dead spider herself, a new epistemological obstacle. So also with Michelet's descriptions of lizards, squirrels, toads, and birds, which compete with and prey upon each other and the spider in a socio- economic system that becomes in Michelet a metaphor for mid-century France as he perceived it; his discovery of female forms in nature; and his depiction of the sea as a whole new underwater world populated by invisible inhabitants. These descriptions are not scientific. But they work like science in that they break down immediate intuitions, dissolve the accepted system of archetypal cliches, and re- create the world according to a model that produces new conditions of knowledge. Orr also follows Bachelard in applying an unorthodox variety of psychoanaly- sis to literature which does not analyze authors but rather images, whose power is supposed to derive from their articulation of a primordial and archetypal ex- perience. In my opinion, this is the most questionable part both of Bachelard's theory and of Orr's analysis. As literary analyst, Bachelard tried to participate in the poetic experience and to discover, beneath the manifest images, the primi- tive experience to which they refer. Such an approach can be interesting and sug- gestive, especially where, as in the case of Michelet, the author's life intrudes so persistently and forcefully into his writing. But Orr's search for the psychological 184</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS source of Michelet's imagery and metaphors in certain of his childhood experi- ences and in his feelings toward women-toward his second wife in particular, who encouraged him in his naturalistic studies-lacks the critical verve she achieves when she confines herself to Michelet's poetic intention as expressed in the text and reconstructs his mythical model. She may be right to say: "The influence of one's biography is inevitable and underlies the emotion any contemporary historian can lend to the past . . . A transference occurred, in the psychoanalytic sense, for Michelet did use history for therapy" (p. 198). But how can we be certain that literary images do in fact reach downward toward some primordial experience of being, whether individual or social? And is it not possible, as Levi-Strauss's formalization of the relations among images in myths suggests, that images are purely functional and can be used to express almost any thematic content? Goethe, after all, failed to find his Urpflanze and was displeased at Schiller's suggestion that it existed only as an Idea (in the Kantian sense). Regardless of the source of Michelet's mythical model, this book is a brilliant reinterpretation of one of the most engaging, gifted, and versatile nineteenth- century intellectuals, who gave direction to a critical transition in European thought. Orr's revelation of Michelet's historical and nature writings "as the creatures and creation of linguistic parody" (p. 174) will interest historians, literary critics, and others concerned with the relationship between the real and the imaginary and with the role of language as mediator between the two.
