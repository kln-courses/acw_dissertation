The authors claim, for example, that "archaeo- logical finds and DNA tests suggest that direct ancestors of Bushmen once inhabited most of Africa's eastern lands, from the Red Sea to the Cape" (p. 30). Recent research using DNA in fact shows no immediate ancestral relationship between the hunter-gatherer peoples of eastern and southern Africa; they are as genetically far apart as they possibly could be. It would also be extremely difficult to massage the archaeo- logical evidence to support this argument. A more significant limitation of the book is the cursory treatment of important debates. In places the authors assume, uncritically, one side of a contentious argument, without pro- viding readers with the information about the other side. This is the case with the dating of North African rock art: instead of venturing into the very significant and interesting dis- agreement between Fabrizzio Mori and Alfred Muzzolini that lies at the heart of Saharan rock art research, they accept Mori's controversial dating scheme that gives the art greater antiq- uity than Muzzolini would allow. In itself, choosing one side of an argument is not a problem, but Coulson and Campbell position themselves as arbiters for other debates, par- ticularly in southern Africa. As the book is intended to bring research conducted over the past few decades to the public's attention, this inconsistency detracts from what would have been the first overall synthesis of African rock art research in many years. spring 2002 ? alrican arts Nevertheless, the book's strength is clearly intended to be its images. Indeed, the authors state: "Is 'writing' the correct word for compil- ing a book whose illustrations must say more than the words?" (p. 12). Such statements are deceptive; rock art does not speak for itself, and even photographs are representations that convey ideas about the art that are often prob- lematic. If, as the authors accept, the art of the Sahara was made at a time when the area was more verdant, then images of the art in its present landscape-striking as they are-are misleading. Such philosophical issues, howev- er, will hardly deter most readers, who will in all likelihood admire the images rather than wade through the text. Indeed, as a volume intended to catch the eye with its striking photographs, African Rock Art is successful; while perhaps not in the same creative league as David Muench's superb rock- art-in-landscape images, the photography on the whole is very good. Unfortunately, given the book's size and cost, there are too many images that are, oddly, out of focus (e.g., Figures 16, 37, 67, 119, 145). Whether the fault lies in the pho- tography or the production process is unclear, but it mars an otherwise attractive volume. Even with all these problems, interested readers will still want to own African Rock Art: Paintings and Engravings on Stone because it is the first serious effort in many years at bring- ing the rock art of Africa together in a single volume. The sheer scope of its coverage and the spectacular images will give many people their first glimpse into one of the world's old- est, most extensive, and diverse art forms. The flaws noted above make the book less attrac- tive as a synthesis and evaluation of African rock art as it presently stands. Given that it will be some time before another continental synthesis is accepted for publication, African Rock Art is disappointing not so much for what it is but for what it could have been.

The cata- logue would have been nice to consult in the gallery space, providing insight into interpre- tation of the masks without distracting from the aesthetic experience. For those who do not read German or Dutch, it includes an English translation by Kevin Cook. Just by themselves, the 73 high-quality color photographs of these one-of-a-kind, never-before-published masks make Wereld in Beweging a logical addition to any personal or institutional library. (Smaller versions of the photos are reproduced in black and white in the back, next to the English translation.) The bulk of the volume consists of descriptive and interpretive catalogue entries for each mask. 92 This is prefaced with a brief intro, Efe/Gelede masking traditions Yoruba peoples (known as Nago who live at the crossroads of sot Benin and southwestern Nigeria. T Hans Witte, clearly informs the rea outset that a lengthy description c pose and function of the Gelede sc als, and iconographies is "beyond tl this study" (p. 69). He does, howev a body of literature to consult foi understanding of Gelede, all of included in the bibliography. In the introduction Witte state main function of the Gelede society the female powers of "witches" to the community against their poten gerous disposition. He goes on to ( by country) important concept of the "witch," pointing out ... : that the term is an "unnecessarily pejorative MD ITS rendering of the [Yoruba] word aje," and is nra used only for lack of a better translation (p. 69). Aje, we lear, refers to a type of "female power" inherent in all women, all of whom are South Africa potentially "witches." The Efe/Gelede society placates and pacifies this "female power" often South Africa through mask celebrations which have two South Africa parts. Efe, the first part, is a nocturnal gather- ing; the Gelede masks appear in the second Africa part the following afternoon. Because the original collector of the masks did not pass on information about their specif- ic geographic origin, we are told only that all of the Efe/Gelede objects in Mrs. Ursula Heijs- Voorhuis's collection (which have been in Europe since at least 1972) were acquired from the same African town or village, whose name is not specified. Therefore, the next section in rithin the introduction addresses the possible origins HERN of these objects. Because of particular stylistic characteristics, Witte proposes that the collec- tion came from Benin, most likely the area between Porto Novo and Sakete, including the villages of Takon, Banigbe, and Daagbe, and rica possibly as far north as Pobe. The Lamida fam- ily, well-known mask carvers from the vil- lage of Daagbe, probably carved some of the masks. Throughout the catalogue great atten- tion is paid to particular artists' hands and ,ries workshops, and the author nicely refers to Allen Roberts's article on a family of Gelede idton puppet-mask sculptors in south-central Benin, the only other publication to date that address- es this topic (Roberts 1992:54-60). We next lear how puppets are used in Efe/Gelede ceremonies. By and large, it ap- FRICA pears that one or more of these masks might Iron Ages, perform in preparation for the nocturnal Efe ceremony. During the daytime Gelede celebra- louth Africa tion, they entertain the audience with perfor- .RT FROM mances, often satirical in nature, depicting a ica wide range of events in the daily life of a Yoruba community. Because the puppets were Africa often made to address a particular situation in a a particular village at a particular time, it is often difficult to reconstruct the original mean- Zimbabwe ing of the superstructure. Add to this the fact that superstructures can be altered or replaced entirely, allowing a mask to be updated while keeping the same substructure. A new mean- ing based on a new social circumstance can be duction to given to a puppet whose initial meaning has of Anago become obsolete. Thus we lear in the small in Benin) section on interpreting the puppets that it is utheastern usually "impossible to identify the local events 'he author, that the puppets originally referred to" (p. 72). ader at the Witte closes his introduction with the proposi- )f the pur- tion that some puppet masks might have been )ciety, ritu- made and used for funerals of important mem- he scope of bers of Gelede societies. 'er, refer to The main catalogue consists of the de- r a deeper tailed entries for each object which are clearly which is divided into sections and subsections that were not as readily discernible in the installa- 3s tha ththe tion itself.

Then, again following the exhibition, the Alapafuja and Gelede monkey masks are discussed in a separate section called "Between Efe and Gelede." The main portion of the catalogue (and of the exhibition), called "Gelede," is subdivided in a very useful fashion. First, we are present- ed with entries for eight masks in a section designated "Witch Birds." To no surprise, all have articulated bird puppets as superstruc- tures, for in Yoruba thought, birds often sym- bolize the female power of witches. The next subsection, called "Philosophy of Life," con- tains thirteen detailed entries of the masks representing ancestors, "witches," and orisha. The following subsection, "Authority and Justice," contains eight entries on masks rep- resenting Yoruba public life by incorporating figures of court officials and district chiefs. The puppets wear the clothing and regalia of Fon chiefs, attesting to the interethnic com- munity of Nago and Fon peoples. "Daily Life" is the last subdivision of the Gelede masks. These puppet masks reinforce principles of upright social behavior either by positive or negative example. notes ANDERSON &amp; PEEK: References cited, from page 25 Allen, Capt. Wm., R. N. and T. R.

BENTOR: Notes, from page 41 [This article was accepted for publication in September 2001.] 1. Leib and Romano (1984:54) recorded the terms Okum-ngbe in the Ejagham language and Idem-Ikwo in Efik. 2. A handwritten document in the National Archive, Enugu, recalls the introduction of the Okonko society into the Aba area in the not too distant past. Although anonymous and undated, from its context and content it was clearly written by a Christian convert as part of a conflict with members of the Okonko society in the Aba area of Ngwa before 1921: The Okonkor is the leading secret society among the people of these parts. It originated from Arochukwu. It was an innocent play organized by a few members just to amuse themselves...as many important men and elders join the club, they soon make it to gain Supremacy over other clubs....Every member is sworn not to disclose the secrets of the Society excepting at the formation of a Branch Society in some other countries for the purpose of money mak- ing. In this way it spread among the countries but the Aro people being cunning use of the greatest care to introduce it to a certain limit. Another document in the same file recalls that the Okonko Club at Amuma, also in the Aba area, was established around 1902 and that the unseen sounding instrument that identifies the society is called Ekpe (National Archive, Enugu: Long Juju of Arochukwu and Okonko Society, 1920, Abadist 13/4/54; see also Oriji 1981). 3.

After "Gelede," the final section of the cata- logue is dedicated to Gelede music. It includes ten leg rattles wor by dancers as both a com- posite musical instrument and a protective device, and three drums which would be used during Efe and Gelede celebrations. Because of the possibility of changed meanings of Gelede puppet masks, some of the catalogue entries required some serious interpretive guesswork. They do not claim to be definitive, however, but are meant to offer some interesting and well-thought-out ideas. Liberties of interpretation are taken, but in my view that is better than saying nothing. If you did not make it to the Afrika Mu- seum for this show, I highly recommend tak- ing a look at the catalogue. And please stay tuned for coming attractions: the museum plans innovative exhibitions and publications in the near future, some of which will focus on contemporary African and African diaspora art and artists.

Based on his studies in the 1930s and '40s, Jones claimed that there were no masks in this area (1984:154). Masks are sometimes used today, but they are marginal and not an integral part of any major cultural institution. 8. I am grateful to Basil Igwegbe, a sculptor from the com- munity, for his valuable observations expressed in personal communications (1988-99) and in his B.A. dissertation (Igwegbe 1989). These have supplemented my own study of the festivals. 9. I recorded my surprise upon seeing the masks by comment- ing in my notes, "They sing like Ekpe but look like Owu." 10. The Mmanwu of the Oguta-Ihiala area is very different from the dominant Mmanwu genre of north-central Igboland. Its performances consist of four masqueraders with an elabo- rate fiber costume but without carved masks. This genre was discussed in detail by F. Nnabuenyi Ugonna (1984). 11. Jones documented Ekeleke in the Orsu area just north of Orlu and noted that it is a marginal type of mask in an area dominated by Owu, Okonko, and a third genre called Okorsie. He recorded that it was introduced "more recently" from the Isoko and Western Igbo groups. He does not men- tion an Aro connection (Jones 1989:55-56). In a personal com- munication (uly 10, 1989), however, he indicated that an Aro involvement in the introduction of Ekeleke is likely. Cole also documented an Ekeleke performance at Agwa, northwest of Owerri, where he noted that the Arochukwu "colony" at Agwa and elsewhere seems to be the main Ekeleke dancers (Cole &amp; Aniakor 1984:204-10). In the accompanying photo- graph (fig. 319) the dancers wear an "Aro George" wrapper. References cited Abalogu, U. N. 1978. "Ekpe Society in Arochukwu and Bende," Nigeria Magazine 126-27:78-79.

WILCOX: Notes, from page 55 [This article was accepted for publication in September 2001.] 1. "George" is the Ndoki Igbo (Akwete clan) term for both the actual Indian madras cloth and their woven imitations of it. Because of the close historical ties with the Ndoki, the Ibani Ijo also occasionally refer to Indian madras as George cloth. Most Eastern Ijo people, however, tend to call it injiri (Lisa Aronson, personal communication, April 9,1998). 2. Various studies have concentrated on masks and their distri- bution in the Nigeria-Cameroon coastal region and beyond. In 1969 Lou Ann Lambeth, a Sieber graduate student, addressed coastal horizontal masking traditions in West Africa, notably a "Creek International" style, that Robert F. Thompson proposed in a lecture at Indiana University on February 28, 1968 (see Lambeth 1969). G. I. Jones (1984) included the arts of southern and western Cameroon with the arts of eastern Nigeria. Sidney Kasfir (1985) studied the formal aspects of the Idoma ancestral masquerade in central and southwestern Nigeria. Simon Ottenberg and Linda Knudsen (1985) documented the dissem- ination of the Ekpe masquerade in Southwest Province, Cameroon. Douglas Fraser (1962) and Monni Adams (1963) wrote early studies of horizontal and composite animal-headed masks, and recently, Patrick NcNaughton (1991, 1992) ad- dressed art history and horizontal headdresses. 3. American scholars distinguish between the name of the city, Douala, and that of the people, Duala. In the German lit- erature, however, one finds the spelling Duala for both, while the French use Douala. 93</page><page sequence="4">$1.20 per word, minimum $30. African Arts box number $15.
