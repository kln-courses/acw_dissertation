<plain_text><page sequence="1">Male and Female Characters in Illustrated Children's Books or How children's literature contributes to the construction of gender Carole BRUGEILLES*, Isabelle CROMER and Sylvie CROMER** Demographic research increasingly refers to the concept of "gender", which can prove valuable for the study of such top- ics as nuptiality and the relationship between members of a cou- ple, or decision-making in matters offertility and birth control. How are these gender roles constructed? Carole BRUGEILLES, Isabelle CROMER and Sylvie CROMER here consider one instru- ment that may have contributed to this construction: illustrated books for children. Their characters are mainly children-boys and girls-and parents-mothers and fathers-depicted in their daily activities, with attributes and qualities that are some- times clearly differentiated by sex. Even animals, whether real or imaginary, humanized or realistic, are defined by gender. The authors of the books are also men and women, a factor which may have influenced the choice of characters and of their specif- ic traits. In the 1970s, the sexual stereotypes found in children's books and school textbooks came under strong criticism, thanks mainly to the action of feminists who saw these stereotypes as upholding and reinforcing the inequality between men and women. Between 1965 and 1985, considera- ble research(l) was devoted to the definition and identification of * Institute of Sociology, University of Lille I. ** University of Lille II.

CROMER "sexism"(2) and to the promotion of measures for its eradication: aware- ness campaigns, training programmes, publishers' guidelines to authors, etc. The large-scale programme of national surveys organized by UNESCO from 1981 on, following the World Conference of the United Nations' Decade of Women in Copenhagen, July 1980, should also be mentioned. This programme "urged governments to take all necessary measures to eliminate sex-based stereotypes from teaching materials at all levels"(3). Among the solutions proposed, some believed it necessary to enact laws promoting equality between the sexes through, among others, publications and teaching materials(4). Thirty years later, at the end of the twentieth century, a period marked particularly for women by revolutions in the realms of sexuality, work and politics, and by uneven progress towards equality between the sexes(5), it seems important to take a new look, beyond stereotypes, at masculine and feminine representations in books. The aim is not so much to see whether progress has been made in this field as to gain new insight into the question thanks to the new concept of "gender". This concept was introduced by sociologist Ann Oakley, at the time -hardly a coincidence-when the above stereotypes were coming under attack, for the purpose of distinguishing between social sex and physiological sex: " 'Sex' is a word that refers to the biological differences between male and female [...]. 'Gender', however, is a matter of culture: it refers to the social classification into 'masculine' and 'feminine'" (Oakley, 1972, p. 16(6). Without the concept of gender, it is impossible to account for the observed differences or to analyze the systems of value-laden, prescribed and hier- archical relations between the masculine and the feminine in their social and cultural dimensions. In addition, this approach makes it possible to describe the situation not only as it actually is, but as it should be from the point of view of equality (Condon, Bozon and Locoh, 2000, p. 77). Children's literature does not hide its ideological agenda and there- fore provides a good basis for this type of analysis, all the more so since the economic stakes have increased steadily in recent decades. Children's books account for a large and growing share of the publishing market(7), (2) Lempen-Ricci and Moreau (1987), Valabregue (1985). Michel (1986, p. 53) identifies two types of sexism: "explicit sexism" which does not acknowledge that men and women live a different reality, and "latent sexism" which acknowledges that inequality is found in the real world, but does not question its legitimacy. (3)U.N. A/CONF, 94/35, p.109. Michel (1986) provides a synthesis of various national surveys, suggests a typology, and cites numerous bibliographic references.

(6) Since then, the concept of sex as an unchanging category has been called into question: "So-called biological sex does not provide a solid foundation for the cultural category of gender, but constantly threatens to subvert it." (Laqueur, 1990, p. 124).

Parents feel more and more concerned by their children's welfare and future, and see the book as both factor and guarantee of success(8). Teachers have similar views. Babies are given books almost as soon as they are born-picture books made of cloth, plastic, cardboard-and until children begin to read novels, towards age 8 or 10, illustrated books are available in all shapes and forms: new editions in various formats, hard cover, paperback edi- tions, fiction or non-fiction. Parents, nannies, day-care workers, librarians and schoolteachers are confronted with a huge choice. This covers every- thing from the "good authors" found in libraries and specialized book- shops, to the comic books sold in supermarkets. But the increase in the market share of new titles (from 35% of all titles in 1994 to 38.9% in 1999) does not necessarily mean greater diversity. Profitability require- ments impose extreme standardization, as children's books are "prod- ucts"(9) that can be exported to numerous countries, the word "product" being all the more appropriate now that books are often no more than one object among others (toys, games, stuffed animals, cartoons, etc.) in a "universe": "Books can no longer live alone, they must compete [...] we owe it to ourselves to create an environment for books that may extend to televi- sion. Don't forget that Canal J belongs to Hachette(l?)". In the context of the globalization of publishing, where the tendency to simplification and to using stereotypes is stronger than ever, an analysis of children's books through the concept of gender seems especially relevant. (7) Children's books constitute a flourishing and particularly dynamic industry, with a turnover of 1.2 billion French francs in 1999 for the 120 publishing houses, and sales growing by 3%, compared to 0.7% for the entire publishing industry (Syndicat national de l'6dition, 1994). Il- lustrated children's books account for 2.9% of turnover, with sales of 19 million books, with an average print run of 7,479 copies. (8) The last survey on the cultural habits of the French in 1997 reports that books, and par- ticularly children's books, can be found in practically every French household, and that more and more people have library cards (Donnat, 1998, p. 183). See also Chartier and Hebrard (2000). (9) This transformation of books into "editorial products" is not specific to children's liter- ature: "Since the days of Joyce and Proust, the increasingly clear distinction between literary text and editorial product has had the inevitable consequence of reducing the number of fans of the former genre."

The present work is part of the European programme Attention, Al- bum! [Look out, Picture Book!]( 1) organized at the end of 1995 with the support of the European Commission. For the first time in France it sur- veys the entire annual output of new illustrated fiction books for children aged 0 to 9 for the year 1994 (see inset 1). Most earlier studies surveyed only a limited corpus of documents, the notable exception being that by Dunnigan conducted in Quebec in 1975 which covered 225 textbooks and 24,000 story characters. To broaden the corpus while keeping it homogeneous, we chose to study a specific category, that of illustrated books for children under the age of 10. Halfway between fiction and pedagogy, these books are an extremely fruit- ful area of investigation. Illustrated books introduce children to the written word, provide en- tertainment, and stimulate the imagination. More importantly, they are the child's companion in its discovery of the world, of the body and the emo- tions, of the bonds of kinship and friendship. They also teach values. In short, they facilitate the socialization process and the internalization of norms. If we accept the hypothesis that sex is the fundamental social clas- sification system(12), the central question, though one rarely formulated openly, is that of sexual identity, of the difference between the sexes, and of social relations by sex. This is particularly true for illustrated books, present everywhere from birth and the privileged medium for the acquisi- tion of socially acceptable sex-role models, and through these, of social hierarchy. Moreover, the illustrated children's book is an ideal source for the study of representations, because of its hybrid nature both artistic and literary and because of the way it is read-or rather "used", given the young age of its public. It can be defined as a short work where pictures are more important than text: "The picture book is a strange kind of book, because it succeeds in doing away with the text and relies on the presence of pictures [...] This bizarre form of publication established itself in France between 1820 and 1850 [...], and became the quintessential book of the child." (Le Men, 1994, p. 145). With a concise text and a simplified narrative logic (Bremond, 1973), they are the "books to look at" that Paul Valery contrasted with "books to (11) Without going into the details of the programme created by the European association Du cote des filles [The Girls' Corner], it can be mentioned that the quantitative and qualitative analyses of illustrated books referred to here were performed by demographers Carole Brugeilles and Isabelle Cromer, sociologists Sylvie Cromer and Arlene Khoury, and by Adela Turin, a writer of children's books. They acknowledge the invaluable help of the librarians of La Joie par les livres and I'Heure Joyeuse in Paris, and Livres au Tresor in Bobigny in establishing the corpus of works, and making them available. (12) See Hurtig and Pichevin, 1986 ; Hurtig et al., 1991. According to Heritier (1996), "the differential valence of the sexes is the foundation of society". 240</page><page sequence="5">MALE AND FEMALE CHARACTERS IN ILLUSTRATED CHILDREN'S BOOKS read". This "visual book", for those who cannot yet read, will be looked at and handled often, read aloud by an adult and perhaps by the child once it has mastered reading (Danset-Leger, n.d.). Thus the picture book has a major initiating role. As the first book, it responds to the human need to give meaning to action. Pictures, a short text, a schematic narrative, a di- dactic purpose, a very young public: in this literary genre, the protagonist takes on extraordinary importance as the "true support of the preservation and evolution of the tale as the reader perceives it" (Le Manchec, 1999, p. 32), becoming the quintessential embodiment of gender representations. Given these aspects of the children's book and its undoubtedly influ- ential role, we decided to adopt an approach to the characters and their in- teractions that would take into account both images and text-just as a child, in building up a character, selects and memorizes both iconic and verbal indicators-and the changes they undergo depending on the age of the readers. We originally considered a study over several years, but this project was abandoned for lack of time and funds. A long-term study would have had the advantage of better controlling for the effects of fashion on the choice of themes (divorce, death, dinosaurs, witches, etc.) and of allowing a check on the validity of our findings. Nonetheless, the study of books published in a single year (1994) remains relevant for many reasons. Given their high production cost and price, these books are made to last for a long time in schools and libraries, while publishers re-issue them re- peatedly to maximize the return on their investment. Many of the books published in 1994 and covered by this study are thus still being read today. In addition, we will be focusing on representations, which by definition change only slowly, and on the production in its entirety. Hence, it is un- likely that the findings will rapidly become obsolete. 1. Hypotheses Our basic hypothesis is that in illustrated books, female characters are given minor roles, and endowed with physical traits, character and per- sonality, roles, social status that are generic, undifferentiated, and stereo- typical to an extent verging on caricature, and that bear little relation to the real world. Conversely, male characters have more gratifying roles, even though they are just as stereotypical. A secondary hypothesis follows from this sexual asymmetry: relations between the sexes are unequal and hierarchical, and illustrated children's books will rarely show a mixed world where boys and girls, men and women, are seen to cohabit, relate, communicate and exchange on an equal footing. The world of illustrated children's books will be one of discrimination, segregation and sexual hi- erarchy. 241</page><page sequence="6">C. BRUGEILLES, I. CROMER, S. CROMER The central question underlying this study is the following: how are picture book stereotypes and representations manufactured? To answer the question we analyze the combination of several factors: the character's type, role, age, sex, parental position (or not), social function, and interac- tions with other characters. We also take into account the readership of the book, and the sex of the writers and illustrators. Inset: Definition of the corpus and criteria of selection The sample includes 537 illustrated children's books, chosen according to five crite- ria: I) Genre: illustrated children's books Illustrated children's books are defined as those in which pictures are more impor- tant than text. Paperbacks are included but not comic books, where the principle under- lying the interaction between text and pictures is completely different. 2) Theme: fiction The books belong to two main categories: fiction (about 40% of the 1994 produc- tion) and non-fiction. We did not include non-fiction or educational works, such as school and extracurricular textbooks, for which the analysis of representations must fol- low different criteria. The distinction is not always clear, given the various functions at- tributed to books and to reading. 3) Date of publication in a French edition: Fiction published in France in 1994. 1994 was the most recent date for which copyright could be secured. 4) Newness: "Original" French publication in 1994. New titles, which are fewer than reprints, are difficult to identify for two reasons: on the one hand, they include many re-editions in different format that do not indicate the original copyright; on the other hand, the notion of "new book" is quite ambiguous from a "creative" point of view, as was pointed out by Bouvaist (1990, p.22): "for the sake of gaining time and producing at low cost, publishers do not invest in 'research' and are not interested in introducing their readers to new works: they publish old titles in new forms, ... or buy the rights for foreign books which are then adapted carelessly". 5) Age of readers: Works intended for readers under 10. Despite the recent fad for illustrated books for teenagers and adults, the readership of this type of book consists mostly of children under 10; older children tend to read short novels. Using the CD-Rom National French Bibliography since 1970, and on the basis of the three criteria available for selection-year of publication (1994), readership (code a = children) and language (French)-2,620 titles were identified. In order to obtain a sam- ple that corresponded to the five criteria defined above, we made a second, manual selec- tion by examining the books one by one. We thus selected 651 books. Among these, 114, or 17.5%, were not found, either because the publishers had not kept them in their ar- chives (Hemma, Piccolia, PML, Lito, Nathan and Rouge et Or), or because the publisher had gone out of business (e.g. F.P. Jeunesse, Berso). Finally, the investigated corpus in- cluded 82.5% of the 1994 production, or 537 illustrated books. The difficulties encountered in assembling and accessing the full corpus reveal the publishing industry's lack of openness with regard to its production and distribution. They suggest that it would be difficult methodologically to measure the impact of one particular book as distinct from the entire production: not all books are diffused to the same extent, re-editions must be tracked down, "trashy" literature is kept out of the li- braries but fills the supermarkets, and no French public library keeps records of how of- ten a book has been borrowed. 242</page><page sequence="7">MALE AND FEMALE CHARACTERS IN ILLUSTRATED CHILDREN'S BOOKS 2. The observation framework The children's illustrated book is traditionally considered in qualita- tive terms. We chose a quantitative approach. Our method is to count the items contained in each book and use statistical tools to cast light on the various facets of its contents. How can we decipher the content of each book in all its richness, so that it can be analyzed statistically? How do we preserve the specificity of each book while fitting it into an analytical framework? In a gender perspective, how do we identify and delimit, be- yond age and sex, all the relevant aspects of the characters, including their relations and functions? We solved these problems by using a modular questionnaire to collect the information contained in the text and the pic- tures. The common core of the questionnaire is applicable to every illus- trated book. It included an "identity card" (publisher, writer, illustrator, number of pages, intended age of the readers, themes) and an exhaustive and detailed census of the characters by sex (male, female, undetermined) and age (adult, child, undetermined). After that, the questionnaire consists of modules adapted to the content. For instance, modules "children", "adults", "grandparents", "occupation", "witches", "crowd scenes", etc. are added where the content requires it. The differentiated modules that focus on the characters collect infor- mation on sex, function, type and personality, attributes, occupation, ac- tions, and indicators of sexual identity. In order to describe social relationships by sex, it was important to include the kinship and social re- lations between the characters as well as their social class. The role played by the character is the key source of information on that count. On the ba- sis of five criteria (title, number of appearances, place in the narrative logic of the story, influence of story on character, and influence of the character on the course of events), we determined four types of roles: -the dominant main character: the single hero or heroine of the story, who is at the center of events, is affected by them or influences them; the joint main character, who shares centre stage with one or sev- eral characters on an equal basis; -the secondary character, who is actively involved in the story and plays a role in it; -the background character, who appears intermittently. The first three categories correspond to those protagonists who mod- ify the course of the story and/or are affected by the events. These charac- ters are analyzed in depth. The fourth category regroups the bit part players who feature in the analyses only in respect of their sex. Finally, and unlike previous studies that were restricted to humans, we took into account the entire motley and heterogeneous population of 243</page><page sequence="8">C. BRUGEILLES, I. CROMER, S. CROMER the books-that creates an impression of diversity-to examine the rela- tions between the sexes in the different categories. Certain types of char- acters are meant to represent human society (characters with human features or with the appearance of an animal or an object), while others present an image of animal society, or evoke the world of the collective imagination. Initially, we elaborated a typology of seven categories of characters. Within the 1994 production, however, some categories were too poorly represented and too disparate. They included objects, robots and animated or humanized toys, and imaginary, legendary or folkloric characters such as Santa Claus, the Devil, gnomes, ogres and leprechauns. In the end, we reduced the number of categories to three: -humans; -anthropomorphic animals, humanized or clothed, whose animal form is more or less imaginary. Their behavior is essentially human, the main (non-cumulative) criteria of human behavior being the facts of wear- ing clothes, walking on two feet, living in a house, and having specifically human activities (a penguin attending day nursery, a rat going to work); -real animals living either in an animal world or with humans, and represented essentially as animals, despite anthropomorphic projections (thoughts, feelings). II. A photographic description of the sample Before studying the representations of characters and families in a gender perspective, we analyze the structure of the production by sex of the writers and illustrators, geographic origin of the illustrated books and date of publication. Next, we look at the books' content in order to deter- mine the author's purpose, the subjects treated and the references (histori- cal, geographical, cultural and social) of the story. Throughout the description, the production is distributed by the sex of the writers and il- lustrators. 1. The authors A majority of the writers are women, while among the illustrators men slightly outnumber women. If both activities are combined, the output appears to be evenly divided by sex (Table 1). 244</page><page sequence="9">MALE AND FEMALE CHARACTERS IN ILLUSTRATED CHILDREN'S BOOKS TABLE 1.- DISTRIBUTION OF ILLUSTRATED BOOKS ACCORDING TO CREATIVE ACTIVITY AND SEX OF THE CREATORS (IN %) Female Male Mixed teams Unidentified* Total Text 53.1 41.9 2.8 2.2 100.0 Illustration 45.1 51.4 0.0 3.5 100.0 Total 38.0 34.3 24.6 3.1 100.0 * Cannot be identified because first name was ambivalent or of unknown foreign origin, or because not cre- dited, particularly for illustrations.

The books for younger children aged 0 to 3 years are short, with little text (none exceeds 35 pages, and three-fifths total fewer than 15 pages), and evoke the first learning experiences of everyday life and the environment (especially animals). They represent a good third of the out- put. Early childhood is particularly appealing to women: 42.6% of the fe- male teams (where writer and illustrator are both women) have published a book for very young readers. Overall, nearly one half (46.5%) of the books for children aged 0-3 were written and illustrated by women, 32.6% by men and 15.5% by mixed teams. The books designed for children aged 4 to 9 are more complex and longer, usually over 12 pages; nearly one quarter exceed 35 pages. These books tell a story that can be read by an adult or directly by the child. With 350 titles, they form the majority of the books. When women work in mixed teams, they tend to leave the realm of early childhood, and 78.2% of the books from mixed teams are designed for older children. 3. Geographical origin of the books Over half the books are French creations (55.1%, or 296 titles), but translations of works initially published in English, either in Great Britain or the United States, are far from negligible, representing almost one quar- ter (24% or 129 titles). While French production has the highest propor- tion of female creators (see Table 2), men are more strongly represented among English-language writers and illustrators, among whom there are few mixed teams. The third largest input is from Belgium, with 71 books (13.2%), and many Belgian teams are mixed. Other countries are hardly represented. Sixteen titles are from Germany and eight from Italy, and only three from Canada, Spain and Sweden. The sample also includes two translatio.ns from the Netherlands, one from Switzerland, one from Denmark and one from Austria. 245</page><page sequence="10">C. BRUGEILLES, I. CROMER, S.

Source: Survey of 537 illustrated books for children aged 0-9, first published in France in 1994. The output of foreign origin consists of very recent publications. Over half the translated books were published in their country of origin in 1994 (55.6%) and fewer than 20% were published before 1992. For eco- nomic reasons, the translations are often published at the same time as the originals. The corpus is thus homogenous with respect to dates. 4. Learning or playing: historical, geographical, cultural and social references The aim of an illustrated book is to amuse the child while introduc- ing it to the written word. Beyond these two universally avowed goals, some works claim a clear didactic function, which is sometimes mentioned among the goals of a given series. This is the case for most illustrated books (56%), and especially those designed for children aged 4 to 9 (61.1%); among the remaining 44%, no particular intention is identified, the aim being purely recreational. For the very young, the purpose is mostly to have fun (53.5%). Male teams respect this link between readers' age and the object of the book, and tend to produce amusing books for younger readers and more educational books for older readers (Table 3). Conversely, women tend to write books with a didactic purpose regardless of the age of the readers. This is also the case for mixed teams, even though both aims are almost evenly represented in their production.

Although none of the books deals with the question of gender equal- ity, one book specifically deals with the transmission of traditional femi- nine roles from mother to daughter. One striking characteristic of the books is the extent to which they simplify all historical, geographical, cultural and social markers. Despite their instructional purpose, they say remarkably little about the diversity of the world. Most of the stories take place in the present day (80.1%), very few in the past (3.4%). Imaginary epochs are rare (6.5%) and are more often described by male writers. Finally, a significant proportion of the stories (10.1%) are devoid of any time reference whatsoever, thus cre- ating an opportunity to state "universal" truths. Although predominantly set in a present-day context, the books are more frequently given a rural setting (36.6%, or more than a third) rather than an urban one (13.4%)(13), whereas depictions of the wilderness are re- served for animal stories (10.2%). Foreign countries (1.9% of the books) are barely represented. Exploring the geographical and cultural diversity of modern society is not an aim of these books. The number of stories that take place in a non-specific geographical setting (28.5%), for the most part indoors, confirms this hypothesis. The focus on domestic space can be ex- plained by the importance attached to the child and the family, and by di- dactic intentions such as the teaching of values, or the evocation of psychological problems or family conflicts. This, quite logically, is more often true of the books written by women. Given this specific combination of time and space-a timeless na- ture and a domestic space-, it is not surprising that social characteristics are absent from 84.2% of the books. The 15.8% of books that do place their characters in a social context usually show a broad middle-of-the- (13) Chamboredon and Fabiani (1977) have pointed out that realistic representations of cities are rare. 247</page><page sequence="12">C. BRUGEILLES, I. CROMER, S. CROMER road class that could be described as middle-class (9.8% of the illustrated books). Even when rural environments are predominant, only 13 books mention farmers (2.4%). The rural society depicted is not that of the peas- ants; this may seem a paradox, but is in fact consistent with contemporary social change. The non-differentiation of the social milieu occurs whether the authors are male or female. But it is less frequent if the teams are mixed: 21.2% of their production is socially situated. The neutral aspect of the contexts and codes can be explained first by the requirements of joint publication and globalization: detailed social, cultural, historical and geographical references must be carefully avoided. In order to sell everywhere, the content must be free of any specific iden- tity. More fundamentally, this kind of archaic and uniform world protects against the influences of modernity. Whether or not this is intended, the image of a world that is stable, neutral and reassuring provides a basis for moral teaching and for the transmission of rules that appear as timeless and universal. In this context where points of reference are unclear or ab- sent, characters assume paramount importance. We will therefore look now at the character's sex, function, type and age before we turn to their functions in the family and in society and ex- amine the impact of the sex of the authors on the representations. III. Identity of the characters 1. Asymmetry between the sexes from cover and title The first contact of a reader or his/her parents with an illustrated book occurs through its cover, and its appeal plays a central role in the choice of the book. From the start, titles and cover illustrations give the lion's share to male characters. In a majority of cases, the title introduces a single character of the male sex (Table 4). Male characters are clearly dominant, since more than one third of the books have a title mentioning a single male character. But when a second character appears, males become less prominent, the mixed combination being just as frequent. Multiple characters in the title are rarely female. The cover almost always represents a character (only 8 books depart from this rule). The cover illustration, which is the only indication of the contents for young non-readers, strongly reinforces the male dominance observed as from the title: over three-quarters of the illustrations (77.7%) feature a male character, whereas less than half of the covers (48.9%) show at least one female figure. 248</page><page sequence="13">MALE AND FEMALE CHARACTERS IN ILLUSTRATED CHILDREN'S BOOKS TABLE 4.- DISTRIBUTION OF BOOKS ACCORDING TO THE SEX OF THE CHARACTERS MENTIONED IN THE TITLE (IN %) Male Female Mixed Unidentified Total One character 35.2 13.0 - 5.8 54.0 Two characters 4.1 0.5 4.1 4.5 13.2 A group or family 3.8 0.9 4.5 0.3 9.5 No character mentioned - - - - 23.3 100.0 Reading: 35.2% of the books have a title mentioning a single male character.

Male dominance is confirmed throughout the book On opening the book, the reader is introduced to two or three charac- ters: 19% of the books narrate the adventures of two protagonists and 20.5%, of three. In 14.5% of cases, they meet a fourth character, but in 13.4% of cases, readers must be content with only one hero. The male presence becomes more marked as the story progresses. While most books present at least one male character, less than three quar- ters have one or several female characters (Table 5). This imbalance is even more pronounced among children: little girls appear in fewer than half the books.

Characters of unidentified sex are extremely rare, in particular among adults (only 6 books); doubtful cases are more frequent among children (5.2% of the books). 3. Incidence of the type of character in terms of sex and age As seen above, there are three main types of character. Half the books (50.5%) feature human figures and 42.3% show anthropomorphic animals (humanized or clothed). Real animals are featured in 18.2% of the books. The majority use only one type of character, 7.6% mix humans and 249</page><page sequence="14">C. BRUGEILLES, I. CROMER, S. CROMER humanized animals, 6.7% humans and real animals, and 3.5% humanized and real animals. In fact, animal figures compete strongly with human figures. Animals have always had their place in literature, in myth and leg- end, tales and fables. Today, they are particularly characteristic of chil- dren's literature. Several explanations have been given for the ubiquity of animals: the multiple layers of meanings in the interaction between hu- manity and the animal kingdom, the correlation with an increased scarcity of animals in the life of the child, the symbolic function, the scientific and pedagogical aim of books on real animals, or the function of books as a way of introducing children to models of social behaviour with the help of "animal masks" (Nieres, 1989; Douaillier, 1979; Parmegiani, 1992). Beyond the problem of robbing the animal of its nature, the use of real an- imals to make ideological statements on nature and culture remains am- biguous and risky, and even more so when the shift to human representation is made through clothed, anthropomorphic animals. The immutable laws of the animal world are not equivalent to human laws, based on culture and history. The use of animals confers a universal value on the story and establishes a distance between readers and characters, but at the same time it does away with history, technique and culture, and sim- plifies and reorders the world while preserving a social status quo, partic- ularly in the matter of gender relations (Guillaumin, 1992). Representations of children in the books vary in frequency by type of character. Children are more frequent in books depicting a human world than in those depicting an animal world, whether the latter is humanized or not. A child is included in 91.9% of the books representing humans, but only in 72.2% of those about clothed animals and in 63.3% of those about real animals. The strong representation of adults in this literary genre for children must be stressed. Regardless of the type of character, they are featured in three books out of four. The importance of adults is moderated, however, by the fact that they are less likely than children to have the main role (see below, Table 7). Also, the imbalance between the sexes varies by type of character. Of books depicting humans, 91.9% include a representative of the male sex and 84.5% one of the female sex. The probability of encountering a male character increases slightly, and that of seeing a female character de- creases, in books about humanized animals (Table 6). These trends are even more marked in books describing real animals, which also include a large proportion of characters of indeterminate age or sex-confirming that animals are used as projections of the developing child, since with an animal the indicators of sex or generation can be obscured. Sex disparity increases in the representations of children to the disadvantage of little girls, whose presence decreases as we go from the human world to the hu- manized animal world and to the real animal world. 250</page><page sequence="15">MALE AND FEMALE CHARACTERS IN ILLUSTRATED CHILDREN'S BOOKS TABLE 6.- PROPORTION OF BOOKS INCLUDING MALE AND FEMALE CHARACTERS BY GENERATION AND TYPE (IN %) Character Humans Humanized animals Real animals Adult male Adult female Male child Female child Total male Total female Reading: 64.2% of the 64.2 66.5 70.4 61.6 55.5 59.2 66.1 57.3 39.8 59.8 37.9 31.6 91.9 94.3 95.9 84.5 74.4 69.4 books featuring humans and 66.5% of the books featuring humanized animals include a male adult. Source: Survey of 537 illustrated books for children aged 0-9, first published in France in 1994. Overall, the world of humans appears more complex and more realis- tic, with a greater balance between generations and sexes. At the other ex- treme, the world of real animals is characterized by a more frequent representation of males and adults. The study of mixed situations confirms this observation. In order to qualify as mixed, a book must have at least two protagonists. Among the books corresponding to that criterion, mixed situations are more frequent among humans: 85.1% of the books show children or adults of opposite sex. The proportion falls to 78% for clothed animals and to 76.2% for real animals. Male characters dominate among all types of character. This is con- firmed by the analysis of the distribution by sex of the secondary charac- ters and of those in crowd scenes. The main and secondary characters are surrounded by background characters, either children or adults, in a ma- jority of books (65.2%). Their distribution by sex can be studied in 171 books that include children. Males dominate in 53.2% of cases, and females only in 33.9%. In the 262 books that represent sexually identifia- ble adults, the numerical domination of males is even more marked (61.1% as opposed to 26% of the cases where females are over-represented). This greater importance of males is observed in 97 crowd scenes, in locations as varied as the street, school, market, fair or restaurant. In a ma- jority of crowds, men are more numerous. Children are more equally dis- tributed, but boys outnumber girls in almost one third of crowd scenes. 4. The hierarchy between the sexes is a result of the roles played The numerical imbalance in favor of males is transformed into hier- archical dominance when the roles played by the characters (single main character or hero, joint main character, secondary character) are exam- ined. 251</page><page sequence="16">C. BRUGEILLES, I. CROMER, S. CROMER Females rarely accede to the main role, as the heroine at the centre of events (Table 7). The under-representation of adult women is particularly striking. A certain balance between the sexes exists only when the role of hero is a shared one, at least for the children. When the main characters are adults, whether the role is shared or not, they are almost always men. In addition, books where the main characters are several men outnumber those where the group of adults is mixed.

The inequality of roles by age and sex must be qualified, however, depending on whether the books deal with the adventures of humans or of humanized animals. The child is more often the main character, either alone or with someone else, among humans (64.2% of books) than among humanized animals (53.3%). Conversely, adults are more often the main characters among humanized animals (18.1% as against 5.9% among hu- mans). The essential difference between the populations of humans and of humanized animals lies in the portrayal of girls. Whereas among humans, girls and boys alike are single main characters in about 21% of the books, among humanized animals the difference is considerable: 25.1% of the books have a hero and only 10.6 have a heroine. The difference is even more striking among books that have only one child as main character: 48.2% are boys among humans, 70.4% among humanized animals. In ad- dition, adult men are over-represented as main characters among human- ized animals (14.5% of books), as are adults in general in that category. Among humans, the proportion is only 5.5%. 252</page><page sequence="17">MALE AND FEMALE CHARACTERS IN ILLUSTRATED CHILDREN'S BOOKS 5. Family functions: the predominance of mothers Family function is also a defining characteristic of the characters. Almost half (48.7%) the stories about humans feature a parent, and 14.4% a grandparent, which is more than in stories about humanized animals (37% and 12.2 % respectively). The human and humanized categories have in common the fact that mothers appear more frequently than fathers, and grandmothers more fre- quently than grandfathers, even though in both cases, books with female characters are less numerous. The maternal function is pervasive in the stories (40.4%) and appears as the dominant model for an adult female, es- pecially for humans. Only 20% of books about humans and 25% of those about humanized animals show a female character who is not a mother (Table 8). Conversely, adult male models are more diverse. Over one third of the books about humans and half of those about humanized animals show adult males who do not fulfill a paternal function.

Employment is a male characteristic Adults may acquire a social function through their occupation (Brougenz and Tilliaud, 1992). Work appears to be essentially a male ac- tivity: 32% of the books show a man at work and 15% a woman. A glaring inequality compounds this difference: women, whether humans or clothed animals, tend to be confined to teaching, childcare or shopkeeping (Table 9). Furthermore, a bicycle repairwoman, a female clockmaker and a female cobbler perform their jobs contrary to common sense, and a cow piloting an aircraft causes a crash... Female work is devalued. Conversely, the professions of men are more diverse and socially rewarding. The par- ents' occupation, rarely mentioned, will be discussed later. 253</page><page sequence="18">C. BRUGEILLES, I.

Does the sex of the authors have an impact? In a study of representations from a gender perspective, it seems ap- propriate to look at the findings from the angle of the sex of the writers/ illustrators. From this point of view we will successively consider the ti- tles and covers of the books, the types of characters, their ages, and the importance of roles and family functions. We will not address occupations, because of the small size of the corresponding sub-sample. When the title and cover picture represent a single character, it is usually male, regardless of the authors' sex (Table 10). Male authors tend to favour male characters. Female teams favour the graphical representa- tion of female elements in the cover picture, but rarely in the title. Mixed teams leave more room for female characters, without sacrificing the male presence. In 28.6% of mixed publications, the main character is female (as against 23.8% in books by male authors and only 17.7% in books by fe- male authors); in addition, the second main character, when there is one, is more often female than in books by male or female teams. The choice of type of character varies according to the sex of the au- thors: animal representations are chosen to the same extent by male and mixed teams, while female teams prefer human characters. As a conse- quence, female teams like to feature children, who represent a majority among humans. In books by female authors, the presence of girls is stronger, but they are far less numerous than little boys, who also have the better roles. Female authors do not give any more space to girls. As was the case for the covers, it is the mixed teams who "boost" the little girls, granting them a little more space than do the male- or female-only teams, particularly by giving the leading role to them slightly more often than to boys. Mixed teams also portray adults, and female adults, more often. Only female authors, however, feature more female than male adult characters, 254</page><page sequence="19">MALE AND FEMALE CHARACTERS IN ILLUSTRATED CHILDREN'S BOOKS but the slight preference does not extend to the main role in the story. Re- gardless of the sex of the authors, the proportion of books in which the main character is a woman does not exceed 2%, and books with an adult male hero are always more frequent, even if the gap is slightly less among women authors. In reality, the higher visibility of female adults in books by female or mixed teams is due to the over-representation of mothers. Women authors and mixed teams also refer more than male authors to the paternal role, but the latter remains in the minority.

Our study of the characters in illustrated children's books confirms the findings of other studies of children's literature and schoolbooks: male 255</page><page sequence="20">C. BRUGEILLES, I. CROMER, S. CROMER characters are over-represented(14), on a background of timelessness. The full extent of this dominance of males becomes apparent when we take into account not only heroes and heroines, but also secondary characters, background characters and crowds, adults and children, titles and cover designs, and the three main types of characters-a variable which had been neglected until now. What is more, this dominance is revealed as hierarchical domination when the data are tabulated by roles and functions differentiated by sex. From beginning to end of the illustrated book, in both foreground and background, the masculine dominates the feminine, sustained by the relative weight of the adult generation (even if children more often play the main roles) and by the competition between human and animal popula- tions. Animals occupy a special place in the books aimed at helping very young readers to grow up, and in these books the heroes are overwhelm- ingly adult males. Adult females, though represented, are in second place. Next, the anthropomorphic animals reinforce the construction of a male identity by bringing in the male child alongside the male adult. The femi- nine presence is weaker. In a third stage, human representation takes over. The generations and the sexes are more balanced: little girls (particularly under-represented among animals) make their entry as heroines on a par with little boys. Adult women, however, have little access to the main role and are excluded from many occupations and confined to the maternal role. The stereotype of the woman as mother, the Gordian knot of male domination, still predominates, whereas the paternal function is only one facet of a masculine identity whose position in the social order is clearly indicated by job and importance of role. Books about humans, those meant for older children, are concerned with the construction of social relations, and these are not egalitarian. Placed in a context where animals and humans live in close proxim- ity, where the markers of time and space have been erased, the representa- tions grow more similar and more uniform as age increases. Mixed teams allow more room at all stages for feminine elements, and particularly for little girls, but also for mothers and fathers. Feminine teams place chil- dren, adult women and parental functions in the forefront, which could be the beginning of a reconsideration of the domination of adult males. But women authors and mixed teams do not go so far as to upset the hierarchy of the sexes. On the one hand, the masculine element is never sacrificed, on the other, the feminine one never occupies the centre stage. Thus chil- dren are introduced very early on to the "differential valence of the sexes" (Heritier, 1996). (14) For example, Rosenberg, 1976; Rignault and Richert, 1997; Guillaume, 1999: Leliivre and Lelievre, 2001. 256</page><page sequence="21">MALE AND FEMALE CHARACTERS IN ILLUSTRATED CHILDREN'S BOOKS IV. Images of the family In these depictions of social gender relations, the representation of the family plays an important role: 39.7% of the 537 books of our sample deal with the family. Overall, we are introduced to 234 families in 213 books, or more than one family per book on average, mostly human characters: 139 families of humans and 86 families of clothed animals. At this stage of our study, it seems more relevant to perform the analysis by population rather than by book, in order to underscore the characteristics of each of the two main populations, humans and clothed animals, and ex- cluding real animals(15). There are two coexisting models: families with two parents are most frequent (126 families, or 53.8%) and single-parent families are repre- sented by 25 cases (10.7%); the composition of 83 families (35.5%) re- mains unknown(16). This significant proportion of unknown cases is due to the fact that many stories take place within a limited time span (less than a day) and that only one parent appears. It should be noted that there are as many single-parent families headed by fathers as by mothers(17), that is ten families each, while five families are headed by another adult (adoptive fa- ther, grandparent). The causes of the single-parent situation are not given: it is impossible to determine whether the parent is single, widowed or di- vorced. The families of clothed animals have a more traditional structure than the families of humans: 62.8% have both a father and a mother (against 48.9%) and 7% are single-parent families (against 13.7%). Families with only one child are the majority, regardless of the fam- ily's composition: 76% of the single-parent families have one child, as do 52.4% of the families with two parents. Families with two children, though quite frequent (21.6% among humans, 14% among clothed ani- mals), are less so than they are in real life(18). As regards children, human- ized animals obey more traditional patterns (Table 11). Families of four children or more are twice as frequent among humanized animals as among humans. The large size of the families of rabbits and mice, well known for their high fecundity, is a contributory factor. The sex of the eldest child reveals another form of hierarchy between the sexes. In 46.8% of human families, the eldest child is a boy, and in (15) Indeed, it is not legitimate to place animal society on the same plane. (16) Single-parent families accounted for 10.1% of French households in 1999 (Ministry of Employment and Solidarity, 1999). (17) Chalvon-Demersay, 1996: "What is striking about the world depicted in television series is the frequency of cases where a child is brought up by its father, while in reality, this sit- uation is extremely rare ... Attention is always focused on the father... because the paternal bond is endangered the most by the decline of the marriage institution." (18) "A family with two or three children is the overwhelming ideal. For almost half of the men and women aged 15 to 45, the 'ideal number of children' in a family is two, and for nearly four out of ten, it is three (...) The average family size is close to the ideal number" (Toulemon, 1999). 257</page><page sequence="22">C. BRUGEILLES, I. CROMER, S. CROMER 27.7% of cases a girl. The rank of the siblings is less obvious among clothed animals, and in 51.1% of cases, the sex of the eldest child cannot be determined. Nevertheless, the gap between boys and girls remains obvi- ous: in 36.4% of the animal families the eldest is a boy, and in 9.1 % a girl.

The children: The maintenance of sex patterns in the future The child population of the 537 books adds up to a total of 688 hu- mans or clothed animals. These are divided into 407 male children (60%) and 281 female children (40%). The distribution is 70% against 30% in the sub-population of clothed animals. Although children are less numerous than adults, they nonetheless play the main role more often. In books where the main character is a child, it is a boy in 60% of cases and a girl in 40%. The proportions are exactly the same for the joint main characters as for the secondary characters. The children were observed from the point of view of their personal- ity, the objects that are associated with them, and their actions. Nearly half the children, boys and girls alike, have a specific person- ality trait. During the compilation of the data, 75 character traits were enu- merated, and regrouped in 7 categories (Table 12).

The feminine profile is more positive, however, in particular because more girls than boys are at- tributed intellectual qualities-25.4% as against 18.7%-and because boys sometimes, though not often, are given character traits that are less valued, such as unruliness or shyness. The female and male stereotypes (in particular boys as fighters and teasers, girls as dreamy and fearful, etc.) are practically absent, since there are only 2.1% cases of unruliness and teasing for boys and 1.7% of dreaminess for girls. Little heroines more of- ten give the impression they epitomize, if not perfection, at least qualities. Could this be how they earn the right to be included in the books? The books show very few ordinary girls simply having fun(19). To refine the analysis, we selected those traits among the 75 that were attributed to at least 5% of the boys or 5% of the girls (Table 13). Two classic sexist stereotypes emerge: girls' fondness for food and sweets, and the divide between intelligence and imagination, reinforced by the idea the females are more sensitive. On the other hand, we may note two counter-stereotypes: boys are more often kind and helpful than girls, and girls are more enterprising and courageous than boys. In fact, the psy- chological portraits-very simplistic, it must be said-are quite similar, and the qualities of boys and girls are blended together, resulting in a dou- ble dynamic, pulling girls towards the outer world and increasing the inner world of boys.

With respect to the children's familiar objects, which are very often present (41.4%), the contrasts are sharper. Of course, both boys and girls are portrayed with dolls, cuddly toys and other transitional objects, and with animals, but girls have them more often than boys (46.6% against 37.9%). Outdoor games are a prerogative of boys (8.6% against 1.4% for girls). (19) See Montardre, 1996. 259</page><page sequence="24">C. BRUGEILLES, I. CROMER, S. CROMER Many activities are portrayed, and they reinforce sexual differentia- tion. We identified 18 fields of activity. The most frequent among girls (nearly one quarter) are household chores and maternal functions, whereas boys have adventures (17.9%). The main activities of each sex thus repro- duce traditional gender roles. For boys, however, household or child-care activities are the second most important (16.9%). Thus sexual differentia- tion is manifested by the intensity of the practice or by the differences in practices between the sexes. More insidiously, one might observe that in- equality can only be detected through close analysis, since on a superficial examination boys and girls engage in the same activities. Four "activities" are typically feminine: primping up, wearing fancy dress (+7.4 points compared to boys), carrying out household chores (+6.1 points), getting angry (+5.1 points) and dancing (+4.4 points). Two activities are typically masculine: having adventures (+3.7 points com- pared to girls) and getting into trouble (+3.2 points). Thanks to the study of the differences in activity types, we can draw a standard profile of children according to sex. Boys like playing and be- ing outdoors, and they are "entitled" to get into trouble: their childhood is protected. This does not mean that they are excluded from the house, from mothering and household tasks. Girls, on the other hand, cannot escape from the maternal and housekeeping roles that dominate the books, as we have seen, along with the corresponding "play" activities of dressing up and dancing. Anger, which is specific to girls, harks back to the stereotype of the "capricious female". 2. Sex-typed roles appear even more clearly among parents Three hundred and fifty eight parents and 49 grandparents (humans and clothed animals) were enumerated. The roles of parents and grandpar- ents, as seen above, are more frequent among humans. The two most strik- ing facts are that mothers and grandmothers (202 and 31) are more numerous than fathers and grandfathers (156 and 18), and that this dis- crepancy is reinforced by the parts they play: mothers as main characters are rare (Table 14). The parents were studied according to the same criteria as the chil- dren, even if the resulting overall picture is more schematic. Only one third of the parents have a specific personality trait and an activity. This is explained in part by the fact that adults, mothers in particular, do not play the main role as often. Availability and affection are the two essential character traits of parents, without any significant distinction between fa- thers and mothers. 260</page><page sequence="25">MALE AND FEMALE CHARACTERS IN ILLUSTRATED CHILDREN'S BOOKS TABLE 14.- DISTRIBUTION OF ROLES BY TYPE OF CHARACTER AND FUNCTION IN THE FAMILY (IN %) Among humans Among humanized animals Role of mothers Role of fathers Role of mothers Role of fathers Main character 0.9 1.1 0.0 5.2 Joint main character 11.9 15.7 13.4 15.5 Secondary character 82.9 76.4 84.2 70.7 Background character 4.3 6.7 2.4 8.6 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Reading: 82.9% of human mothers are secondary characters.

Mothers are mainly busy with housekeeping: in order of frequency, cooking (13.9% of mothers against 6.4% of fathers), laying the table and serving meals (13.8% of mothers against 2.6% of fathers), doing all sorts of housekeeping chores such as washing dishes, sewing, washing clothes, cleaning up. The symbol of the housekeeping role is the apron, worn by 20.8% of mothers (3.2% of fathers). In the books, fathers perform the same tasks as in real life: gardening (6.4% of fathers against 2.5% of mothers) or fixing things (5.8% of fathers, 1% of mothers). Inside the house, they are more often seen resting, reading the paper (9.0% of fa- thers and 1.5% of mothers), listening to the radio or watching television (6.4% of fathers and 2.0% of mothers). Their most distinctive visual hall- mark is glasses, worn by 12.2%, against 4% of mothers. Last, shopping is the main mixed activity, involving 8.4% of mothers and 7.1% of fathers. The parents' occupation is not often mentioned in children's books: 50 parents or 13.9%-35 fathers and 15 mothers-have an occupation. The family/job combination is particularly inaccessible to women. On the one hand, the numerical imbalance is important, on the other, the range of masculine occupations is much wider (13 professions for men, 8 for women); they are also more prestigious. Fathers are adventurers, doctors, pharmacists; mothers are cashiers, schoolteachers, fashion models. As for the grandparents, who are more often humans (there are only 3 grandfathers and 3 grandmothers among the clothed animals), they are practically absent from children's books, and most of the time they play secondary roles. The image of the grandparents is caricatural and one-di- mensional, with little distinction between the sexes: they look after their grandchildren, play with them and spoil them, but they have no social function (Arfeux-Vaucher, 1994). It can be noted however that two grand- mothers introduce the theme of death. The image is thus far removed from (20) "Men's share of the work in activities that are predominantly feminine amounts to 11.1% for washing, 17.3% for housekeeping, 19.7% for childcare, 20.0% for cooking, 24.2% for dishwashing. As concerns 'mixed' activities, men take care of 35.9% of playing and educational activities with children, 42.7% of shopping [...]. In predominantly masculine activities, [...] men do 68.5% of gardening and 87.2% of fixing and repairing jobs" (Brousse, 1999). 261</page><page sequence="26">262 C. BRUGEILLES, I. CROMER, S.

Unequal parent/child relations that reinforce sexual hierarchy The relations between parents and children are largely illustrated in the books, with 308 occurrences. Two important observations can be made: the mother interacts more with the children, and sons get more at- tention. In fact the most frequently described "pair" consists of the mother with her son, and the least frequently evoked relationship is that of the fa- ther with his daughter (Table 15).

Contrary to our initial hypothesis, emotional relations are egalitarian, and in general, play activities dominate when the parent is the father and the child is a daughter. It must be noted, however, that, consistent with tradi- tional patterns, fathers are more often seen in play situations and mothers more often in emotional relationships. Mothers more frequently than fa- thers are portrayed in the activities of daily living (feeding, dressing, washing, putting to bed, taking out for a walk, etc.). In this field, fathers are much more involved in the activities of their sons (20.8%) than of their daughters (10.9%). This observation seems to conform to the traditional view that the education of girls is essentially the mother's job, whereas that of boys is shared with the fathers, thereby ensuring the transmission of sex-typed roles. Furthermore, among the differences that corroborate our hypothesis of sexist representations, sons receive more encouragement and rewards that boost their self-esteem, whereas girls are more often forbidden to do things. On the other hand, boys are more often scolded by their fathers. This paternal severity towards sons-offset by the fact that fathers rarely forbid their sons to do things-is probably the sign of higher demands placed on sons, linked to the fact that fathers must transmit the sexual model. Moreover, in these more educational domains, the roles played by the parents reveal interesting differences. The mother embodies the law more than the father by supporting or forbidding, while the father "imple- ments" the rules by distributing rewards and punishments more often than the mother. Overall, the image of the family is so conventional and limited that the complexity of family relationships is negated, to the extent that even the grandparents are largely excluded. The dominant model of a family in- volves two parents and either a single child or an elder son. The illustrated book is the setting for a representation of the family that reveals, in its oversimplification, that sex-based relations are constructed within the family. This explains why mothers, despite the scarcity of female adults, are numerous but confined to secondary roles; this is also why little girls, even though underrepresented, are nevertheless present among the human characters. Everything contributes subtly and by little successive strokes to en- sure the transmission and reproduction of sexually differentiated and hier- archical roles. There are no tight boundaries between the sexes and no reserved areas, and just a few stereotypes (little girls like to eat sweets or dress up, boys are naughty), but all these small differences add up, and masculine and feminine roles become more precisely defined and more firmly set in the progression from childhood to adult age. The learning of social roles through identification with an adult of the same sex would ap- pear to be more important, or at least more explicit, than identification 263</page><page sequence="28">C. BRUGEILLES, I. CROMER, S. CROMER with another child of the same sex. The sex-typed future of the child is preserved. In this respect, it is significant that the personality and the qual- ities of boys and girls have been broadened until they are very similar (everyone is "nice"), except for a slight tendency to present girls as para- gons. Analysis of the activities reveals in rough outline the traditional de- marcation between public and private space that continues to operate as marker of sexual difference even when males and females move in the same universe. Girls tend to stay inside the home and maintain contacts with the family (siblings and cousins), like their mothers who, as second- ary characters, are more available for domestic and familial tasks. Boys and men are more active in the outside world (public places and nature), which does not prevent them from taking over the inside space as well. In addition, what is feminine is marked with a minus sign in its relationship with the family and society, both from a qualitative and a quantitative point of view. Conclusion At the close of this quantitative study of illustrated children's books, we may sum up the situation in the following terms: illustrated children's books are indeed centred on the development of sex-based identity and so- cial relationships through the central element constituted by the charac- ters. These representations do not stem from immediately perceivable stereotypes, but from a more complex and subtle combination of different variables: sex, age, role (main, secondary, background character), type (human, clothed animal, real animal), parenting and occupational activi- ties, along with the readership, and the sex of the writers and illustrators. Illustrated children's books are based on the supremacy of the masculine and the weight of the adult generation, that lead to sexual hier- archy and to subtle differentiation of roles. As such, they promote non- egalitarian social relationships between the sexes. Children's literature is not as trivial as its colourful art work and motley diversity of characters might suggest. It contributes to reproducing and internalizing norms of gender. It is true that mixed teams of authors, without actually favouring girls and women, at least give them a better visibility. For male authors, however, the universal remains masculine. As for female authors, are we to believe that they practice self-censorship, for fear of creating a children's literature for girls, written by women, telling stories about girls or women and for that reason read only by girls? Recent studies have shown that school textbooks transmit stereo- types. In order to have a complete view of the representations transmitted to children and adolescents, it would be necessary to study the short nov- 264</page><page sequence="29">MALE AND FEMALE CHARACTERS IN ILLUSTRATED CHILDREN'S BOOKS els that take over from the illustrated book as children get older. Is the older reader given access to a changing human reality opening onto a world of unlimited possibilities?

The goal of the present study is to analyze the construction of representations designed for children through illustrated books for 0 to 9 year-olds. The originality of the approach lies in the ap- plication of a quantitative method to subjects that had previously been studied from a quali- tative angle. The text and the pictures of illustrated books are thus considered as "respondents" answering a survey questionnaire. The analysis of all new illustrated children's books published in 1994 by means of a modular observation frame covering all the characters made it possible to show, beyond the stereotypes, the combinations of factors influencing the development of the representations: sex, age, role (main, secondary, background character), type of character (human, clothed animal, real animal), parental function and occupation of the characters, as well as the intended readership and the sex of the writers and illustrators. BRUGEILLES Carole, CROMER Isabelle, CROMER Sylvie.- Las representaciones de lo masculi- no y lo femenino en los libros infantiles ilustrados, o de c6mo la literatura infantil contribuye a la construcci6n social de genero Las desigualdades entre hombres y mujeres se apoyan en representaciones de genero "asumidas" por los individuos y, como toda representaci6n social, se modifican lentamente. El objetivo de este estudio es analizar la elaboraci6n de representaciones sociales al alcance de los ninos a traves de los libros infantiles ilustrados para ninos de 0 a 9 anos. La novedad del andlisis consiste en aplicar un metodo cuantitativo a objetos que tradicionalmente se han examinado desde una perspectiva cualitativa. Los libros, de los que estudiamos tanto el texto como las ilustraciones, se consideran "individuos" encuestados. Un analisis de la producci6n exhaustiva de novedades de 1994 permite mostrar, a traves de una matriz de observaci6n por m6dulos de todos los personajes, el conjunto de factores que contribuyen a la elaboraci6n de las representaciones de genero: el sexo, la edad, el papel (personaje principal, de segundo plano), la categoria (personaje humano, animal vestido, animal real), las funciones familiares y actividades profesionales del personaje, sin olvidar los lectores a los que se destina el libro, asi como el sexo de los autores e ilustradores.
