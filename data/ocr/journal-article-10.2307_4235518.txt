<plain_text><page sequence="1">220 PUNCTUATED EQUILIBRIA AND POLITICAL SCIENCE: A NEONTOLOGICAL VIEW ' Carl Gans Division of Biological Sciences The University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Ml 48109 When I was invited to participate in a symposium designed to consider the possible implications of the theory of punctuated equilibria for the study of political science, I faced the need to reexamine some fundamental questions. These transcended such issues as whether and how frequently the phenomenon referred to as punctuated equilibrium occurred, and whether it might indeed be similar to some phenomena studied by political scientists. Rather, I felt it necessary to establish for myself whether, when, and how any biologically based theory or set of hypotheses could be applied to the realm of the social sciences and what cautions might be demanded by such application. I here approach these questions mainly from the viewpoint of a neontologist who studies the charac- teristics and performance of presently living ani- mals. The present article presents a simple set of concepts that helped me clarify my thinking about these topics; I hope that it will be useful to others as well. Before any set of hypotheses is transferred from one discipline to another, it is essential to consider how it was generated, against what background, and with what assumptions. Are the corollaries and concepts common to the discipline in which the hypotheses originated and congruent with those of the discipline to which the hypotheses are to be applied? As I do not expect that the readers wish now to engage in an elaborate study of the primary literature about biological evolution, I have adopted a seat-of-the-pants approach to principles, relying more upon the internal logic of the argument than upon authority. I hope, however, that lack of jargon and of multiple references does not imply that the following statements are oversimplified. The theory of punctuated equilibria applies to changes in the rate of modification of organisms during historical time; the process of such change represents evolution Such evolution has occurred in the past and continues to occur at present and the mechanisms of this evolutionary change are subject to naturalistic explanation. It may be useful, how- ever, as part of the present analysis, to deal briefly with the way organisms (with particular phenotypes) are produced anew in each generation, and to consider how this replicative mechanism is modified to allow evolutionary change with time. Next, it is necessary to consider the hypothesis that the change involved punctuated equilibria: what does this hypothesis state, how was it generated, and to what extent does it fit (or require modification of) the previously proposed mechanisms of change7 Infor- mation about the nature of organismic change and the way our understanding of this has been affected by the theory of punctuated equilibria permits an approach to the more general question of whether POLITICS AND THE LIFE SCIENCES.

Production of Phenotypes and Their Change with Time Organisms have phenotypes (those attributes that we see) and genotypes (the inherited instructions from which the phenotypes are constructed anew in each generation). We know that the nature of ge- notypes changes from generation to generation (i.e., in historical time) and that changes in genotype tend to be correlated with changes in phenotype. Also we know that groups of organisms (populations, spe- cies) are not assemblages composed of identical individuals, but that their members differ from each other and that the frequency of such differences may change with time. Finally, we have ample evidence that selection is often the major factor that affects which phenotypes now occur and that selec- tion has changed the kinds of phenotypes between generations. This leads to several basic questions: How does a genotype generate a phenotype? What produces the different genotypes, and what modifies the rela- tive frequencies of genotypes (and resultant pheno- types) with time? The genotype consists of a complicated set of biological chemicals that furnishes instructions for construction of the phenotype. The chemical tem- plate is most complex. It must contain information that permits the organism to grow to the reproduc- tive stage, as well as the information necessary to let each stage of development (and each sex) maintain its physiological state. Both growth and maintenance must be able to proceed under a range of environmental conditions. The genetic material (often referred to as the genes) generally resides in the nucleus and is here sequestered on chromo- somal strings; the individual portions of particular genes, however, are often located far from each other and their position may be an important aspect of the way that the information they contain is transmitted to the cell's manufacturing machinery. The instructions incorporated in the genotype may be thought of as being of two kinds. The first generates specific compounds, for instance, struc- tural proteins, enzymatic proteins and carbohy- drates. The second serves primarily to affect the rates at which biological processes occur, enhanc- ing and inhibiting them. Each set of instructions is likely to produce compounds that contribute to many diverse aspects of the phenotype, such as materials, shape, and the rate and time of physiolog- ical process and biological development. The tem- plates for these instructions (referred to as genes, even though we now know that each gene has multiple independent components) do not bear a one-to-one relationship to phenotypic characters; rather each aspect of the phenotype results from the often sequential interaction of many instructions. It is important to note that the initial set of instructional templates is tiny in comparison to the size of the resultant organism. Consequently, the template must be duplicated many times (during cell division) both in order to form the organism and to form the germ cells that will provide the next generation. There are two critical implications, the first that much external material has to be acquired and organized during growth and the second that duplication of the genetic instructions within the germ cells will demand near perfection. The first point is that the instructions must control the use of external material during development and that this presupposes particular external substances and conditions. The developmental sequences seen in organisms may be affected by physical (tempera- ture, light) or chemical (oxygen concentration, salin- ity, maternal blood alcohol) conditions. It is moot then to contrast "nature" and "nurture," or to demand whether a phenotypic aspect is "inherited" or "generated by the environment." Both instruc- tions and resources (materials and conditions) will determine the formation of any phenotype. Nevertheless, the genotypic instructions that we now discover to be involved in the formation of particular organs obviously evolved in the presence of particular physical and chemical circumstances. Past selective processes (a concept amplified be- low) presumably favored genotypes that facilitated normal development in these formerly "normal" environments. Hence selection has considerably in- fluenced the response of the organism to the envi- ronment. Indeed, observation reveals two quite different kinds of genotypic response to environmental change. The first comprises mechanisms that com- pensate for or buffer the fluctuating effects of the environment; an obvious example is the capacity of female mammals to continue successful gestation throughout a range of environmental conditions. The second response includes feedback mechanisms, sometimes called physiological adaptations. Each organism contains monitoring mechanisms (which presumably have been selected in the past) that are able to modify an adult or juvenile phenotype to a condition that may prove to be more suitable at a later time. Hence monitoring some current aspect of the environment may allow predictions about its future and the preparation of the phenotype to meet it. Neither response represents conscious choice; for both aspects the action is under genetic control, although environmental cues are utilized to deter- mine the direction of change. In short, one should not expect to encounter individual "genes" that</page><page sequence="3">222 would produce phenotypic aspects, such as finger- nails or the capacity to appreciate the theorems of Pythagoras, independently of the remainder of the genotype. The (physical and presumably the cul- tural) environment influences the nature and extent of genetic expression. Both physical and chemical changes of the tem- plates may modify the genetic instructions and are obviously likely to affect the way these are "read" at the time of cell duplication and during subsequent function. Recent work in molecular genetics has reinforced the notion that such changes (e.g., muta- tions) include modification and deletion of specific genetic instructions and suggests the possibility of duplications and rearrangements of parts of the genotype. Also common are masking and un- masking effects that will affect the actions of part of the genotype. In an evolutionary sense, this replication of the genotype represents a compromise between perfec- tion and random events. Development of a perfect replication scheme in which no changes ever oc- curred would preclude variability within populations. Hence, a population endowed with perfect replica- tion would be static; it could neither adapt nor evolve. In contrast, totally random transmission of genetic information would not permit the accumula- tion of favorable characteristics; it could generate neither stasis nor evolution. The conflict apparently has led to the present mechanism for the transmis- sion of genetic instructions. This mechanism com- bines accurate replication of the overwhelming ma- jority of the genetic information with a relatively minor level of imperfect replication. Such imperfection implies the loss in each genera- tion of those individuals that have become endowed with inadequate phenotypes; however, this imper- fection also endows the population with variability, permitting it to respond to shifting environmental factors. The result is a substrate for evolution within and among populations. The imperfection then gen- erates different genotypes within the populations; however, modification of their frequencies must be driven by other factors. There are several potential driving factors, al- though supernatural causes are set aside here. The recent argument that some genotypic modification is driven by selectively neutral mechanisms applies only to the sources of variation, not to the way variation becomes fixed in the population. Orthoge- netic mechanisms (proposals that evolution pro- gresses in a straight line owing to some internal mechanism) have not recently been accepted by serious workers. Consequently, the implications of catastrophes and of selection provide the likely explanation of the observed effects. Catastrophes obviously represent a potentially important cause, not only because they represent a mechanism for the replacement of species, but because they will change genotypic frequencies. It is unnecessary to view catastrophes solely in terms of mysterious stars that devastate the earth every thirty million years, or of giant comets that lay continents to waste and change the weather for decades; seemingly minor events affecting much smaller regions may well be significant if we con- sider individual species. All species occupy re- stricted geographic ranges and have some poten- tially sensitive aspect in their life. Any change of this aspect over most of the range constitutes catastro- phe for such a species. It may be drought or flood, change of pH (relative alkalinity or acidity) of the water, or the silting of a substrate on which to settle. This is not to rule out major catastrophes, such as volcanic eruptions (witness those of Mt. Saint Helen and Krakatoa) or the invasions of competing ani- mals, such as those that occurred after the forma- tion of a land bridge between North and South America. Yet, even events that seem minor to us may have catastrophic implications for the survival of some populations. A minor climatic shift seems to have doomed populations of the Rocky Mountain toad and the advent of rats doomed many species of birds on mainland New Zealand. Human intervention remains the most significant catastrophe for the biota of our planet, examples included plowing, clear-cutting, paving, the introduction of exotic spe- cies, the application of biocides and the use of fire. Catastrophes change the environment, potentially making some genetic variants (or different species) selectively advantageous. They may also decimate populations to the point at which the "founder effect" or "genetic drift" become significant. The remaining populations then constitute only a small and presumably random fragment of the original genetic variability. Should population size increase again, one would see a markedly modified pheno- type. Such catastrophe-driven changes have cer- tainly occurred, but it is unclear how commonly (particularly prior to the advent of man). Natural selection is a mechanism that acts on the phenotypes. Selection proceeds independently of the origins of the phenotypes, of whether they result from stochastically driven chemical changes or rep- resent the result of drift; selection tests the set of currently occurring phenotypes against the current environment. Superficially, this concept is danger- ously simple. It states that those organisms rela- tively better able to use environmental resources produce more offspring (that are in turn capable of reproducing successful offspring in the third genera- tion).</page><page sequence="4">223 The likelihood of successful reproduction is re- ferred to as relative fitness, and the definition should make it obvious that this concept can be applied only within a species. Thus, there is no basis for discussing the relative fitness of elephants and dung beetles or of people and butterflies. There are also operational difficulties as the determination of fitness requires that we follow the reproductive success of individuals of a population for at least two generations. Furthermore, the way in which phenotypic aspects contribute to fitness tends to be cryptic rather than obvious. Recently, we have learned that selection reflects not only the attributes of the individual, but that one may see advantages to traits that also benefit relatives. Fitness at any moment is of course measured in terms of a particular environment; however, the environment is unlikely to be stable. Some organ- isms monitor the environment and use its cues (e.g., humidity, temperature) to determine when to pro- duce how many offspring and with which sex or what kind of phenotype. Other forms seem to "roll dice," simultaneously producing several phenotypi- cally different kinds of offspring, each capable of fitting a distinct subset of the environment. There remains the operational difficulty that it is easy to document many aspects that permit an organism to survive or will enhance its reproductive potential, but that it is often very difficult to deter- mine how closely these phenotypic details match the adaptive demands. Also, the question remains whether the observed match really reflects selection for the observed adaptation, or whether it repre- sents a by-product of a different historical process. We may hypothesize that the rates of phenotypic change will increase with the intensity of selection for a modified phenotype (i.e., with the intensity of selection against most of the other phenotypes). Also, these rates will decrease to the extent that the genotype does not contain or produce the kinds of variations suitable for the adaptive effect 'required" at present. The possibility of selection and its rate are also affected by factors such as the nature of the breeding system, and the rate of environmental change. Consequently, changing rates of selection and changing rates of phenotypic change must be expected and have been observed. To summarize this section we may note that the observed phenotypes are produced by the interac- tion of genotypes with the environment. Also, these genotypes may change (mutate) owing to alteration in their arrangement and chemical composition. This results in potential variation of the phenotypes in- cluded in any population. Finally, the frequency of phenotypes in the population reflects selection, as well as factors such as the nature and frequency of mutations and occasional catastrophes (which in- elude any major and unforeseeable environmental change). The Hypothesis of Evolution by Punctuated Equilibria A decade ago, it was proposed that evolution occurs at varying rates of change rather than as the gradual process that had supposedly been claimed by many of its advocates; the extreme position was that it tended to proceed by stops and starts. In more technical terms, the fossils of some species were supposed to document "stasis," as they seemingly maintained a phenotypic equilibrium over the long term. These static periods were supposed to be interrupted by sudden "punctuational" changes that led to the appearance of markedly different pheno- types and were followed by another static period. The initial concept of this theory, that evolution generally involved punctuated equilibria, derived from an interpretation of the fossil record. For many successive horizons (layers of rock) of the fossil record the phenotypes seen were supposed to be in equilibrium and show little change; such static peri- ods, however, were followed by punctuations during which markedly different organisms "suddenly" ap- peared. The saltational differences of phenotypes referred to were supposedly so marked that there was talk of "macroevolution"! These "sudden" changes seemed often to be associated with gaps or discontinuities in the fossil record. Consequently, the theory incorporates two concepts, namely stasis and sudden change in organismic structure. That discontinuities occur in fossil sequences has long been known; indeed, it led to the pre-Darwinian hypothesis that "evolutionary" changes had oc- curred by successive catastrophes. Some propo- nents of the theory of evolution by punctuated equilibria have suggested that all adherents of the "previous" view had viewed change as gradual and continuous; it has even been suggested that gradual and continuous change were considered to be the same. Both statements are untrue. A number of reports have even documented that the concept of intermittent periods and variable rates of change already appeared in the writings of Charles Darwin. The question then revolves more around the fre- quency of punctuational events and around the basis for assuming their generality. Claims for gener- ality keep encountering the problem that most cur- rently observed changes in individual and popula- tions of organisms appear to be relatively gradualistic and to involve microgenetic changes. The fossil record provides evidence that permits the argument that "punctuation" has occurred, but the record cannot unequivocally demonstrate it. Even the closest layers documenting seemingly sudden changes were formed over periods ranging</page><page sequence="5">224 from 104 to 105 years. Assuming conservative values of ten to twenty years for generation time (interval from birth of baby to production by it of another baby), this would still mean a gap of 1,000 to 5,000 generations. This is hardly a time course that one would expect to characterize as "sudden." In view of the aim of this article, it may be instructive to consider what these numbers would imply in terms of human history. The fossil record also provides some evidence for stasis. One encounters limited variation in the archi- tecture of fossil shells and in the geometry of certain bones; for some species, this constancy in the general appearance of such structures throughout geological periods is clearly real. However, we still lack a detailed examination of many randomly se- lected sequences to establish whether and how often the phenomenon of stasis actually appears in the fossil record. Also, the system derives most support from the study of hard tissues, and we have observed that the bony structures of many species are often remarkably similar. Bones differ only slightly below the level of genera. Much more critical is that the fossil record has given us almost no information about the state of the soft tissues, and about the rates of change in their structure and chemical composition. We know, however, that most mutations affect these and only show minor effects on the hard tissues. Hence, the observed "stasis" may represent an artifact of the sampling technique, reflecting but poorly the status of the actual organ- isms. There have been a number of attempts to explain paleontologie "punctuations" in neontological terms. These have been driven by the fact that the fossil record is often poor, not only in temporal, but even more in spatial resolution. Even the best sequences, which number fewer than a dozen, appear to be based upon single sites, acres rather than square miles in extent. This retains the very profound possibility that the sudden changes do not reflect modification of species, i.e., change of a single form in place, but rather replacement of one set of species by another. This replacement might have been produced either by gradual changes in the local environment, (permitting invasion by other species from adjacent areas), or by catastrophic events such as glaciation or deforestation. Should either of these explanations be likely to hold, there would be no reason for the common argument that punctuations are associated with the origin of new species. Another by-product of the punctuationalist as- sumption has been the search for distinct genetic mechanisms (sometimes called macromutations) for these seemingly macroevolutionary events. The macromutations are assumed to generate drastically new genotypes (and consequently new pheno- types). Once these had arisen, they would represent the raw material for further phenotypic shifts under the influence of shaping selection. Also, there may have been secondary extinction of those of the variant phenotypes that did not encounter suitable environments. However, even the demonstration that macroevolutionary events had indeed occurred would not demand a new genetic mechanism. There is no direct correlation between the magnitude of genotypic change (in the chemistry of the genetic material) and the magnitude of its effect on the phenotype. Hence, minor genetic changes can pro- duce major changes in the phenotypes. Further- more, most statements about supposedly macroevo- lutionary events are based upon examination only of the phenotype. In short, the theory of punctuated equilibria de- rives initially from examination of remnants of pheno- types preserved in the fossil record. The concept involves both stasis and sudden change; conse- quently, either, both, or neither may prove to be significant. The fossil record by itself is generally too coarse-grained and imperfect to permit decisions as to whether a particular change has been gradual or punctuated. In short, the record is permissive rather than unequivocally demonstrative of the theory. The possibility that phenotypic structures (and hence this aspect of species) commonly remain static throughout geological periods needs further investigation. The ideas about sudden change are even less certain. It is unclear whether macroevolu- tionary events are indeed anything more than occa- sional phenotypic changes, the magnitude of which is larger than usual. Certainly, these do not require genetic macromutations. The association of punctu- ation with speciation events is hardly documented. Consequently, the case for punctuation is weaker than that for gradualism, particularly since almost all cases that have been studied in the Recent show gradual change. This leaves us with a theory that may explain certain cases, but hardly one that subsumes all or even the majority of speciation events. However, even if we were to accept the concept that the theory of punctuated equilibria were to explain most of the history of life, what would be its implication for the social sciences? Biological Theories as Models in the Social Sciences Man has always looked to nature for examples and models permitting the characterization and explana- tion of human attributes and behaviors; the fables of Aesop are one obvious example. However, it is important to note that biological examples and theories may be applied to the social sciences in</page><page sequence="6">225 two distinct ways?as models, with the implication that they represent equivalent mechanisms, and as convenient metaphors that facilitate communication. These seemingly similar usages have profoundly different implications. To the extent that theories may be assumed to represent equivalent mechanisms, the factors seen for the biological system should also govern the behavior of the social one. They can then be utilized as explanatory schemes, to explain the workings and the rules by which both systems operate. Hence, explanatory models should allow prediction of aspects that cannot be examined directly or have not yet been seen. Such prediction is based upon a claim for a real underlying congruence. For instance the flow of air over a scale model suspended in a wind tunnel permits us to make statements about the nature of air flow over a full-sized wing. In the present case, a similar theory of evolution would presumably demand similar methods of inheritance, transcription, and selection. In contrast, the use of biological hypotheses as metapohors does not make any such assumptions. It allows description of a second (and unknown) phenomenon by pointing to a known one. Descrip- tion of the human digestive process in terms of a sausage factory might be a good example. A meta- phor indicates only that a set of the presently known aspects of the two systems is similar (and presum- ably that no part of the defined set shows obvious exceptions to the similarity). As there is no assump- tion that the underlying rules are similar, it does not really matter whether the rules are correctly applied in the original system and whether the usage there is "appropriate"; appropriate or not, usage as a metaphor would not thereby be affected. It should also be clear, however, that metaphors have quite limited predictive power as pedagogic devices; in contrast, theories, such as the theory of natural selection, permit expectations that are subject to test. If biological phenomena or theories are used only as metaphors, aspects outside of the observed set of similarities cannot be assumed to be similar. In this case the similarity is only skin deep. I do not wish here to discuss the relative merits of several biological theories to the social sciences; rather the aim is to clarify the basis for making decisions about their applicability. Clearly, any the- ory might be suitable as a source of metaphors; this requires only some degree of observable similarity, but does not permit predictions. The interest (and risk) in a particular theory increases whenever one attempts to derive predictions about phenomena in the social sciences from models deriving from biol- ogy. Certainly, use of biological hypotheses requires prior demonstration of more than superficial congru- ence. Thus far, this is lacking for the theory of punctuated equilibria. For example, in the present case, I could certainly adduce many situations in human history that may have involved prolonged stability and others in which major changes oc- curred in a short time. The reasons for these modi- fied rates may or may not be obvious; the phenom- ena may have reflected political or other cultural causes, perhaps economic, religious, artistic, and technical ones. Does this permit one to argue that the pattern was caused by punctuated equilibria? The major difficulty in the application of the theory of punctuated equilibria to social systems is that the units of comparison are hardly congruent. In the original theory of punctuated equilibria we are deal- ing with individuals and their phenotypes, as well as with the distribution of these phenotypes throughout populations. What are the units of social selection? Is the system a reproducing individual with a spe- cific phenotype? Or are phenotypes only involved indirectly in the social sciences? Perhaps one could derive statements regarding the inheritance and possible selective advantages of social systems, but the congruence needs to be proven, it cannot be accepted on an a priori basis. Until such proof is provided, we are dealing with a set of metaphors, the applicability of which needs to be checked for each specific case. My argument, that the theory of punctuated equi- libria is at best a source of metaphors for the social sciences, should not imply a view that man or human social systems are outside the realm of natural selection. Biological processes certainly ap- ply to man; indeed, so do the laws of chemistry and physics. However, few serious students use the statistical mechanics of gases as direct models for the interaction of individuals and populations. Al- though these laws do explain the behavior of gases in the human lung, their application to the level of human populations hardly explains all of their behav- ior. There are two extreme ways in which such biologi- cal theory might provide a model suitable for the social sciences, and the difference between them is mirrored in the two conflicting approaches to popu- lation ecology. The first would demand the establish- ment of a "genetics" and an "ontogeny" (sequence of growth stages) for ideas and social behaviors. Most important for this approach to the origin and transmission of new social concepts and systems is its implicit assumption that it proceeds indepen- dently of possible differences and changes in the phenotypes of the human populations affected. The second basis on which a biological theory might ultimately be applicable to the social sciences would be to treat them as purely behavioral phenom- ena reflecting the different phenotypes of the indi- viduals expressing them.</page><page sequence="7">226 Application of theories from biology as models for the former approach would then require the demon- stration that the biological terms involved were indeed appropriate in this context and that they were congruent to the pattern underlying the social system. One is forced to develop definitions about new ideas and about their origin (the "mutation" and "recombination" of concepts). The same de- mands would be made for the concepts of "geno- type," "phenotype," and "transcription" in social systems. It would require at least a theoretical basis showing how such social phenomena were affected by selection. One reason why I detailed the complex nature of biological phenotypes and their modifica- tion has been to support the notion that the parallel cannot be a facile one. The tracing of the biological parallel would be easier for the second approach as concepts of phenotype, selection, and adaptive response to selection would remain restricted to human individu- als and human populations. The connection would lie in the capability of these organisms (due to their distinct phenotypes) to develop, to learn about, and perhaps to respond to different social systems. However, any social system would always be seen as an outgrowth of human behavior, rather than as a set of concepts with independent heredity and evolution. As the human phenotypes would inevita- bly incorporate both genetic and environmental components, the rules discussed in the first section of this review would here apply. Such an approach would involve concepts similar to those often in- cluded under the aegis of sociobiology. This second set of concepts may be easy to state, but is very difficult to evaluate for human popula- tions. It incorporates the impliction that not just the behavioral responses of individual organisms to conspecifics, but their capacity to engage in com- plex interactions, has been subject to selection. In short, it implies that tolerance of and success in the face of the peculiar stresses of a social existence (involving more than the family or flock) followed upon changes in the nervous systems of members of the populations involved. The ability to move in groups, and to generate, recognize, and follow social systems would then be considered to differ among sets of human individuals and to have changed in historical time, i.e., it must ultimately reflect a genetic basis. Test of this position is far from facile. Witness the controversy and real difficul- ties incurred in measuring "intelligence," in this context the ability to learn and retain various kinds of facts and tasks. Even more controversial (and for man fraught with real procedural difficulties) has been the issue of the inheritance of intelligence and of the extent to which its phenotypic expression may be modified by environmental effects. Given these problems in improving our understanding of a rela- tively simple set of components of human behavior, one may expect even greater problems in arriving at decisions about the concept that particular pheno- types (inevitably incorporating a genetic com- ponent) presuppose the capacity to generate or accept particular social systems. It may be useful now to return specifically to the theme of this article: At this time, what is the potential utility of the theory of punctuated equilibria to the social sciences and specifically to political science? Assuming that the theory is to serve as a real model, rather than as a metaphor, it could either be applied to the evolution (e.g., temporal change) of ideas or social systems per se, or to the evolution of members of the human population (for instance by improvement of their ability to exist in high- density groups by accepting certain kinds of con- cepts). We then have a sharp distinction between these two hypotheses, as their corollaries are truly different. In the former application we assume that the stasis (over what length of time?) and sudden "punctuational" changes in social systems pro- ceeded independently of prior genetic changes in the populations involved. (Changes in social sys- tems may of course result in genetic changes; attempts at genocide and mass resettlement of populations represent obvious examples.) In con- trast, the second application suggests that the observed bursts of punctuated social events reflect the fact that the phenotypes of the populations (incorporating a genetic component) have under- gone punctuational changes (that secondarily led to the social changes). This means that the capacity of individuals to generate and utilize particular social systems suddenly became modified. It seems inter- esting to consider the implications of this hypothesis for the time scale on which punctuational events are observed in human social systems; however, the applicability of the concept of punctuated equilibria is far from obvious at this time. Conclusions I hope that I have been able to make clear that phenotypes are produced in extremely complex ways that always incorporate a genetic component and that there are multiple ways in which selection will act upon them. Beyond this, I have tried to note the basis, possible applicability, and limitations of the theory of punctuated equilibria. Its utility as a possible metaphor is not in question. It appears that from a biological viewpoint there are two extremes to the process of evaluating social systems: One end treats them as entities with patterns of change independent of the phenotypes of the individuals engaging in the behavior. The alternate extreme considers them as epiphenomena resulting from the</page><page sequence="8">227 nature of the individual phenotypes. Unfortunately, the theory of punctuated equilibria at present can provide students of social systems with little more than metaphors. Specifically, I have encountered no evidence that this theory has any predictive value in the social sciences; the emergent principles of any similarity do not appear to derive from possible roots in biology. It seems appropriate to note that by their nature the social sciences have the potential of bridging the theoretical and the practical realms. Conclusions presented in theoretical studies are likely to be noted by those who will not follow the arguments. Such readers may assume that the study is sup- ported by scholars and deserves rapid transfer of its conclusions (with which they may concur for other reasons), shifting the "new" from theory to practice. This documents that the facile utilization of biologi- cal theories with social applications, as models and even as metaphors, involves substantial risk; it remains imperative that attempts at such transfer be treated with caution. Note 1. This article represents a slightly modified version of a talk given at the symposium "Punctuated Equilibria versus Gradualism: Political Implications" held during May 1984 in New York City under the auspices of Sections G and Q of the American Association for the Advancement of Science on the occasion of its 150th Annual Meeting.</page><page sequence="9">228 COMMENTARIES SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS AND PUNCTUATED EQUILIBRIA Michael T. Ghiselin California Academy of Sciences Golden Gate Park San Francisco, California 94118 Carl Gans' expressions of skepticism are well founded, but in point of fact an evolutionary theory of social change already exists, and one that fits in very well with punctuated equilibria (Hull, 1975, 1985). Both the theory of punctuated equilibria and the new evolutionary theory of scientific change take it as axiomatic that species and their analogues in the social sciences are "individuals" in the ontological sense (see Ghiselin, 1981 and commentary and references therein). They are wholes made up of parts, not classes that share defining properties. The world consists of a hierarchy of individuals, such as atoms and galaxies in physics; cells, organisms, and species in biology; and nations, languages, and universities in the social sciences. It is metaphysically impossible for a class to do anything whatsoever, such as change. Therefore anything that changes has to be an individual. The individuals ranked at different hierarchical levels often do quite different things. Genes mutate, organ- isms reproduce, and species evolve. The ontological levels are "decoupled." Hence the more recent discussions of punctuated equilibrium theory em- phasize the fact that species are individuals (El- dredge, 1985). Evolutionary theories of scientific change owe much to evolutionary epistemology (Campbell, 1974). Fortuitous (or blind) variation in theories is followed by a process very much like natural selec- tion, with the fitter theories (those best able to solve problems) tending to displace their competitors. Scientific communities have more knowledge than an organism does, and their parts exchange it; therefore they possess the analogue of a gene-pool (Toulmin, 1972). Because theories are individuals, they have no definitions, and, like species, remain the same individual no matter how much they change. In my early work on Darwin (Ghiselin, 1969) I invoked evolutionary epistemology. Soon thereafter, I related this explicitly to the thesis that species are individuals (Ghiselin, 1971). Lately I have proposed that the Darwinian Revolution fits the punctuational model (Ghiselin, 1982). Such views on Darwin ac- cord well with the transformational approach so effectually applied to Newton by Cohen (1980). They flatly contradict the model proposed for scientific change by Kuhn (1962), which treats scientific revo- lutions as if they were Cuvierian successive cre- ations. They reject Kuhn's analogue of group selec- tion, which makes the scientific community, rather than the individual thinker, the central agent. Like- wise, the facts are seen to argue against saltations, but not against a lot of small steps in rapid succes- sion. And intellectual evolution clearly is not an orthogenesis, or analogue of a pre-ordained ontog- eny, as envisioned by some idealists. One could go on and on, and I restrain myself. But I must at least mention the new evolutionary theory of economic development, and the new evolutionary theory of the common law (see conference proceed- ings in Research in Law and Economics, Volume 4,</page><page sequence="10">229 [1982]). Perhaps the ideal field for the study of gradual versus rapid change would be linguistics. The analogies between languages and species were well worked out by nineteenth-century linguists, and a vast body of material just sits there waiting to be worked up. It is unfortunate how the academic division of labor militates against our ability to recognize such opportunities. PUNCTUATED EQUILIBRIA, POLITICAL SCIENCE, AND PALEOPOLITICS Gary R. Johnson Department of Social Sciences Lake Superior State College Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan 49783 Those of us who do interdisciplinary work will appre- ciate the dangers of theorizing outside our own area of expertise. We often congratulate ourselves for our courage in attempting to bring the insights of other disciplines into our own. However, it is an act of uncommon courage to seek to apply lessons from an area of one's own discipline to an outside discipline, especially for an audience probably domi- nated by those from the latter discipline. We should therefore be grateful to Carl Gans for his courage in discussing the implications of punctuated equilibria theory for political science. The Theory of Punctuated Equilibria Gans has rightly drawn attention to the fact that cross-disciplinary analogies are dangerous as well as potentially fruitful. One of the gravest dangers in such efforts is oversimplification of the theory to be used for analogizing. Implications derived from an oversimplified version of a theory are not likely to be fruitful. Perhaps because he is addressing an audi- ence of mostly nonbiologists, Gans has, unfortu- nately, oversimplified the theory of punctuated equi- libria. It seems to me important that this oversimplification be corrected (an effort that may be foolhardy for a nonbiologist). In explaining the theory of punctuated equilibria, Gans says that the theory proposes "that evolution occurs at varying rates of change rather than as [a] gradual process. ..; the extreme position was that it [evolution] tended to proceed by stops and starts" (my emphasis). He goes on to mention the relatively long-term stasis and punctuational changes pre- dicted by the theory. The problem with this explana- tion is one that seems to have plagued a great many discussions of evolution both inside and outside of evolutionary biology?two (at least) distinct usages of the term "evolution." These two usages are frequently not distinguished by authors, including both advocates and opponents of punctuated equi- libria theory. In the first usage, "evolution" refers to</page><page sequence="11">230 changes in gene frequencies in empirically existing systems called populations (this form is often called "microevolution"). In the second usage, "evolution" refers not to changes in empirically existing sys- tems, but to a succession of life forms, a succession on the earth as a whole (e.g., the "evolution" of life), in some geographical region or time (e.g., North American mammalian "evolution" in the Miocene), or within a taxon above the level of the species (e.g., the "evolution" of the horse). This area of study, often called "macroevolution," is primarily the prov- ince of paleontologists. The theory of punctuated equilibria was proposed by paleontologists, is most influential among paleontologists, and is most useful for explaining paleontological data. This paleonto- l?gica! character of the theory reflects the fact that the theory of punctuated equilibria is concerned with macroevolution and not microevolution. While the theory has sparked renewed interest in possible saltational mechanisms of microevolution, the theory itself is concerned with macroevolution, with pat- terns in the succession of life forms (for the most important early statements of the theory, see El- dredge, 1971; Eldredge and Gould, 1972; and Gould and Eldredge, 1977?Stanley, 1981 has provided a non-technical exposition of the theory). The theory of punctuated equilibria is "a theory about speciation and its development in the fossil record' (Gould and Eldredge, 1977: 121). The theory maintains that the transition from one species to a different species is not usually a result of the gradual modification of an entire species into a descendent species (referred to as "phyletic gradualism" in discussions of the theory), but rather is a result of the replacement of an ancestral species by a small descendent population that had become reproduc- tively isolated from the rest of the species and evolved (microevolution) under a different set of selection forces. Such reproductively isolated popu- lations are referred to as "peripheral isolates." Spe- ciation in such reproductively isolated populations is known as "allopatric speciation." The theory sug- gests that peripheral isolates that speciate some- times then invade an ancestral home range and displace descendents of the ancestral species. The term "punctuated equilibria" refers to the manifesta- tion of this process in the fossil record: relative morphological stasis for long periods of time and the geologically sudden appearance in the record of a new species. Under an assumption of phyletic grad- ualism, such "sudden" appearances of a new spe- cies, without "missing links," was attributed to an imperfect fossil record. Under the theory of punc- tuated equilibria, "missing links" will rarely be found because the process of speciation occurs rather rapidly in geological time and in small populations. Rather than expecting a neatly graded sequence of forms in the fossil record, then, we should most often expect exactly what we do indeed often find- sharp breaks. Given this explanation, it should be clear that it is inappropriate to say that the theory of punctuated equilibria suggests that "evolution" proceeds by starts and stops. The evolution that is claimed under this theory to be punctuated rather than gradual is macroevolution. The theory makes no claim about microevolution. If we wish to consider the implica- tions of punctuated equilibria theory for political science, we must keep this distinction clearly in mind. Punctuated Equilibria and the History of the Culture In the strictly logical sense of "implication," there are probably no implications of punctuated equilibria theory for political science, as Gans points out. The closest we could get to an implication in this strict sense would depend upon solid evidence that homi- nid evolution fits the model of punctuated equilibria (as claimed by Gould and Eldredge, 1977 and Stanley, 1981, but denied by Cronin, Boaz, Stringer, and Rak, 1981). If Homo sapiens emerged as a peripheral isolate, and displaced other hominid spe- cies, this might provide support for the view that the human brain is organized as it is, in part, because of interspecific and intraspecific hominid warfare. There would certainly be implications here for the theoretical foundations of political science. While there may be no logical implications of punctuated equilibria for political science at this time, there may well be "implications" in another sense?the sense of suggestions, hints, or allusions. Thus, Gans notes that the theory might be used as a source of metaphors. I would prefer to say that we might use the theory as an analogy. When such scientific analogizing is handled carefully, with scrupulous attention to similarities and differences, this process can be theoretically productive. It must be stressed, however, that superficial similarities can be very misleading. When we employ such interdisciplinary analogies, the differences may teach us much or more than the similarities. Indeed, we may be unable to take full advantage of the similarities unless we carefully analyze the differ- ences at the same time (for a useful discussion of interdisciplinary analogizing, see Gerard, Kluck- hohn, and Rapoport, 1956). In using punctuated equilibria theory as an anal- ogy, we should probably begin with the theory of allopatric speciation, the beginning point for punc- tuated equilibria theory. The appropriate analogue of a population is probably a single society. The ana- logue of a species is probably a group of culturally related societies (related because they are all cul- tural descendents of the same cultural progenitor).</page><page sequence="12">231 The human members of these societies speak the same language, share the same cultural morphol- ogy, and engage in regular social intercourse. As long as such societies maintained regular contact, they might remain culturally similar. However, if one of these societies became socially isolated, and subjected to different forces of cultural selection, cultural evolution in this peripherally isolated society could produce a culture quite different from those of the original group of societies. Although I'm not sure it is an appropriate analogue, we might say that the peripherally isolated society would reach an equiva- lent of speciation when the language of its members and that of the ancestral group of societies became mutually unintelligible. Based upon this allopatric theory of cultural speci- ation, a punctuated equilibria theory of cultural macroevolution would suggest that a peripherally isolated society that had evolved considerably might invade the home range of its cultural cousins. Per- haps the peripheral isolate has developed a new weapon, or more appropriately for our purposes, a new method of political organization that allows for effective organization of larger groups of people. Based upon these differences, the peripheral isolate might be able to displace, absorb, or destroy the other descendent societies of a common ancestory society. To the archeologist (the appropriate ana- logue of the paleontologist), the appearance of this new cultural form in the ancestral region would occur in an archeological "microsecond." Assume, for example, that a particular region had been occupied exclusively by band level societies for thousands of years, and that a society at a tribal level of organization displaced them through inva- sion over a few years or decades. This transition would appear in the archeological record as a sharp break, a punctuational event. Societies at the tribal level might then occupy the region for a long period, until they were in turn displaced punctuationally by a society at the chiefdom level of political organiza- tion. While parts of this analogy may be somewhat strained, this seems to me clearly the closest kind of analogy to punctuated equilibria theory that we could construct for the social sciences. Moreover, the scenario sketched above has probably been repeated many times. Thus, we might say on this basis that cultural macroevolution proceeds punctu- ationally. However, inasmuch as archeology has not been dominated by an assumption corresponding to phyletic gradualism, I'm doubtful that this analogy would be particularly fruitful for archeology. As for the work of the rest of us, who are largely the counterparts of neontologists, I seriously doubt the utility of punctuated equilibria theory, even as an analogy. The next two sections will examine various aspects of this issue. Levels of Evolutionary Analysis One implication of punctuated equilibria theory ad- vanced by its advocates is that macroevolutionary trends are not reducible to the operation of micro- evolutionary processes. They maintain that natural selection operating at a higher level, the level of species ("species selection"), is necessary in order to account for macroevolutionary trends (Gould and Eldredge, 1977; Gould, 1982, 1985; Stanley, 1981, 1982a, 1982b). It seems to me that Gould, Eldredge, and Stanley are correct in maintaining that macro- evolutionary trends are not adequately explained by natural selection operating consistently in one direc- tion among all species in a clade. Differential rates of species survival are no doubt important components of macroevolutionary trends. However, microevolu- tionary processes explain each case of speciation. Microevolutionary processes also explain each case of species extinction. Thus the only new principles we need at the level of macroevolution are those of statistics. I therefore see no "emergent" evolution- ary principles even if macroevolution is "decoupled" from microevolution in the sense explained. This is not to say that there are not important patterns at this level, nor that this is not an important field of study for understanding the history of life. It is only to say that there are no emergent evolutionary principles. This position also means that the concept of "species selection" advanced by Gould, Eldredge, and Stanley is highly suspect. Gould and Eldredge (1977:142-145) draw out an extended analogy be- tween natural selection of individuals within a spe- cies and natural selection of species within a clade. "Species selection," they maintain, is merely natural selection operating at a higher level in life's hierar- chy?it is natural selection operating on species through their differential rates of speciation and survival. Whatever other merit there may be in the analogy, there is a fundamental problem in consider- ing a clade to be an analogue of a species (or perhaps better, a population). A population (and a species under some definitions) is a naturally occur- ring system in the world, a system created by the reproductive interactions of the individual organisms composing it. A clade, by contrast, is not a naturally occurring system in the world. A clade is a meaning- ful category of analysis because of the phylogenetic relationships among its member species. However, the member units of a clade, the species, do not interact to form a system in the world. Indeed, failure to interact reproductively is the crucial element in speciation. By comparison with a population, then, which is a system, a clade is an aggregation (or at the very least it is a different kind of system). Populations (or species) and clades are therefore fundamentally different kinds of things. It is confus- ing enough that we employ the same term (evolu-</page><page sequence="13">232 tion) to refer to change in these two different kind of units; this problem is compounded if we maintain that the same process (natural selection) operates upon both units. Thus, while it may be useful to name certain kinds of patterns in macroevolution, and to formulate generalizations about these pat- terns, we should resist the temptation to find a natural process operating on units at this level (for other perspectives on this issue, see Stebbins and Ayala, 1981; and Charlesworth, Lande, and Slatkin, 1982). I have raised the issue, and stuck out my theoreti- cal neck, for two reasons. First, the issue of "spe- cies selection" has been an important part of the literature of punctuated equilibria. If we are to consider the implications of punctuated equilibria theory, this issue should be addressed. Second, I believe the flaw in the concept of species selection grows out of a common problem in science, a problem which has always plagued the social sci- ences, viz., a failure to identify clearly and consist- ently a meaningful empirical unit of analysis about which valid scientific generalizations can be made. Such failure results in confusion, needless contro- versy, and a great deal of wasted ink. The most important source of this problem is quite likely a species-typical tendency to engage in relo- cation (Peterson, 1981, 1983). Science has always been dogged by a propensity of its practitioners to convert class names into things of the world. Social scientists may be especially prone to such reloca- tion, because anthropomorphism and ethnocentrism are more likely to interfere with dispassionate analy- sis in our fields of inquiry. A few examples should illustrate this problem in the social sciences. It is not uncommon for sociolo- gists or anthropologists to refer to the evolution of "civilization" (e.g., Moore, 1974), the evolution of "culture as a whole" (e.g., White, 1959), or the evolution of "culture in general" (e.g., Sahlins, 1960). Elaborate justifications for these concepts are sometimes offered, and new and separate levels of evolutionary analysis are proposed (eg, Sahlins, 1960). However, a few moments of reflection should convince us that while we might formulate valid scientific generalizations that apply to all cultures, we can formulate no valid scientific generalizations about non-existent entities like "culture as a whole" or "culture in general." We may be able to talk sense about regional or temporal patterns in the history of culture, but we cannot talk sense about the evolution of reified class names. We may see the same phenomenon at work when social scientists consciously or unconsciously em- ploy Weberian ideal types (Weber, 1949). Moderni- zation and development theorists have been espe- cially likely to use such constructs. Their concepts of "traditional society" and "modern society" do not refer to any existing entities. Consequently, the "modernization process" (or "development pro- cess") described by such theorists is often the nonexistent process whereby one nonexistent entity is transformed into another nonexistent entity. From such theoretical mush can come no valid scientific generalizations.1 While this problem has probably not plagued biology as badly as it has the social sciences, there seem to be manifestations of it in some of the discussion that has attended the theory of punc- tuated equilibria. From this aspect of the discussion, political scientists should be reminded of the impor- tance of clearly specifying units and levels of analy- sis, as well as formulating appropriate generaliza- tions for those units and levels. The Pace of Change There's something almost romantic about punc- tuated equilibria theory. Perhaps it is partly the grand scale of its subject; perhaps it is partly the prose of one of the best scientific writers of our time (Gould); and perhaps it is partly that many of us were budding paleontologists when we were six years old. With this romance, and with an elegant solution to an old problem in paleontology, it is tempting to find implications here for theories of change in the social sciences. Thus, Somit and Peterson suggest that a social scientific model of change inspired by punctuated equilibria theory "would stress the nonadaptive nature of existing institutions and behavior and the possible benefits of rapid?that is, revolutionary?change" (1986:29; Stanley, 1981, also discusses implications of this kind). Putting aside the question of the relative merits of rapid versus slow social change (which may be a normative question in any case), is this kind of implication appropriately derived from punctuated equilibria theory? For two reasons the answer must be negative. First, it should be recalled that the theory of punctuated equilibria is a theory about macroevolution, not microevolution. By any reason- able standards, a society must be considered an analogue of a population. The appropriate source of implications by analogy is therefore the principles of microevolution. Second, and relatedly, the rapid change discussed in punctuated equilibria theory is "rapid" by the standards of geological time. A "rapid" change in geological time may sometimes involve thousands of years. Such change is not particularly rapid in biological microevolutionary time (as Gans correctly notes). On a cultural evolu- tionary time scale, such change would be consid- ered sluggish at best, and perhaps nonexistent or unmeasurable at worst. Or to put it another way, the</page><page sequence="14">233 kind of change advocated by Edmund Burke would be faster than "instantaneous" on a geological time scale. Given the relativity of terms like "rapid" and "slow," especially across three evolutionary time scales (or four scales if we were to include a scale of cultural macroevolution), it seems clearly inappropri- ate to attempt to derive pace attributes of cultural evolution based upon the theory of punctuated equilibria. Support for this view comes from Stephen Jay Gould himself: "Punctuated equilibrium is a specific claim about speciation and its deployment in geological time; it should not be used as a synonym for any theory of rapid evolutionary change at any scale" (1982:84). It is, no doubt, a useful exercise to consider the implications of punctuated equilibria theory for politi- cal science. Having engaged in that exercise, and hopefully having learned some lessons, it is appro- priate that we return to microevolutionary theory with a fresh perspective. My own view is that we have barely tapped the potential of microevolution- ary theory as an analogy to be used in constructing theories of cultural evolution. Unfortunately, even if understandably, we most often use analogies to support old assumptions and to deceive ourselves about the subtle and mischievous intrusion of our value preferences. The full potential of a scientific analogy, however, is tapped only when it is used to help us abandon old assumptions and unmask value preferences that are tainting our theories. Political Science and Paleopolitics Even if there are few if any implications of punc- tuated equilibria theory for political science, it seems to me that the interest aroused by this paleontological theory is exciting. It may draw our attention to a fundamental weakness in contempo- rary political science. It is widely recognized that the theoretical core of contemporary biology is evolutionary theory. It is likely that political evolutionary theory will eventually serve as the theoretical core of political science, for it is only through an understanding of how political institutions evolve that we may reach an adequate understanding of how they work today. For this reason, political science must become more of an historical and evolutionary science (Gould, 1986 has argued that Darwin's "most enduring impact" was his combination of history and scientific methodol- ogy). Certainly this argues for more diachronic stud- ies, but perhaps more importantly, it argues for a need for more study of the past and its links with the present. In its self-conscious efforts to become a nomothetic science, political science largely di- vorced itself from historical studies, which were perceived as dealing with the idiographic. We must return to using historical data. Likewise, we must, again like paleontology, pay more attention to living fossils. We have, or have had until recently, numer- ous cases of living cultural fossils?extant hunting and gathering bands, simple horticultural societies, etc. While political anthropoligists have wisely in- vested time in studying such living fossils, political scientists have paid insufficient attention to political anthropology. They have also paid little attention to archeology. The partnership of paleontology and neontology, as unequal a partnership as it may be, suggests that political science should begin paying greater heed to the three different types of data of what we might appropriately (even if a little too cutely) call paleopolitics. Notes 1. It should be noted that Weberian ideal types are quite distinct from ?deal case laws (e.g., Newton's law of inertia). Such laws, while referring to behavior never found in reality, nevertheless specify the conditions under which that behavior would be empirically found. Such laws therefore do constitute empirical generalizations?generalizations which serve as bench marks in the research process and axioms in scientific theory.</page><page sequence="15">234 POLITICS: AN ASPECT OF CULTURAL EVOLUTION Claude S. Phillips Department of Political Science Western Michigan University Kalamazoo, Michigan 49008 Professor Gans has laid down the requirements for an evolutionary process for political systems. First, there must be mechanisms in political systems equivalent to those in biological systems: biological models, he calls them, as opposed to mere meta- phors. Secondly, there must be evidence that the origin and transmission of new social concepts and systems occur independently of possible differences in the phenotypes of the populations involved. Third, the evolutionary model should allow prediction of aspects that cannot be examined directly or have not been seen. I submit that the theory and evidence for cultural evolution are already present. We are on the edge of the beginning of a science of human history. What has been required is that social scientists, rightfully impressed with the human ability to symbol, never- theless look first, not at ideas, but at the stimuli for ideas: namely, societal efforts to survive by using the earths resources. The fullest accounts of an evolutionary model of social evolution have been given by the following scholars: Alland, 1967; Campbell, 1965; R. Cohen, 1962; Y. Cohen, 1968; Harris, 1968; McNeill, 1963; Phillips, 1971; Ribeiro, 1968; Sahlins and Service, 1960; Service, 1971, 1975; Stavrianos, 1966, 1970; Steward, 1955; Leslie White, 1949, 1959; and White and Dillingham, 1973. These scholars, of course, are not all in agreement and refinements are constantly being made in their works. Nevertheless, the key concepts of cultural evolution that emerge from their theories are these: 1) All living systems utilize the earth's resources, and evolution is the progressively more efficient use of these resources. 2) Evolution occurs biologically by gene mutation and natural selection. 3) In one animal, humans, the evolutionary pro- cess resulted in a brain and physiology capable of symbolic language. 4) Symbolic language, unique in humans, coin- cided with culture, consequently also unique in humans. 5) "Culture is the superorganic means available to the human species for utilizing the earth's resources in the service of survival; accumulation of experi- ence through symboling permits improvements in this endeavor; hence, cultural evolution in particular is part and continuation of evolution as a total- ity. . . .Culture, continuing the life process, appropri- ates free energy and builds it into an organization for survival, and like life, culture moves to maximize the amount of energy exploitation" (Sahlins and Service, 1960:8-9). 6) Humanity's ability to symbol has permitted an unfolding process of accumulating energy control, from simple tools to agriculture, urbanization, indus- trialization, and science. This has contributed gen- erai cultural evolution; later stages are higher in the sense that there is a greater per capita exploitation of energy than before. 7) Increasing technology in culture is accompa- nied by increasingly complex social systems and ideological systems to integrate the entire process. 8) Specific cultural evolution occurs by adaptation to environmental (physical or cultural) conditions. Adaptation is a process of selecting means to exact the greatest energy utilization from a given environ- ment. The selection process will be conditioned by social and ideological systems, leading to variations in cultural systems and sometimes to maladapta- tions. 9) Cultural evolution is more rapid than biological since the symboling structure (language) and the symboling process (reflective thinking), which exist in a single species, permit the transmission of acquired characteristics through learning as well as the cross-diffusion of new cultural characteristics from culture to culture. 10) Culture in this perspective is everything de- pendent upon symboling and its primary manifesta- tions are in three interlocking human systems: tech- nological, sociological, and ideological. Adaptation in Cultures Specific cultures are populations of human beings with their own particular combinations of technolo- gies, social forms, and ideologies. Thus specific cultures are located in time and space. They are analogous to animal species in the sense of the variations they display in energy-capture, in ecologi- cal setting, in adaptations, in population, and in the process of birth, growth, and death. The analogy is loose in the sense that specific human cultures are</page><page sequence="16">235 all part of one single species?Homo sapiens? which means that diffusion (cross-cultural sharing of traits) is possible between specific cultures but not between species. Furthermore, symboling makes the transmission of acquired cultural characteristics possible in cultures. Only specific cultures adapt or fail to adapt. Changes occur in specific cultures and add to the accumulation of traits or characteristics of general culture. The total world of possible variation is thus enhanced, but selection of variation occurs in a specific culture. Although individuals in a population vary behavior, "To be adaptive it must become an accepted part of the behavioral system" (Alland, 1967:119). In cultural evolution, as in biological, evolutionary improvements occur by positive feedback processes, i.e., by behavior that reinforces deviation from equilibrium. How this can occur has been illustrated by the Agricultural Revolution in Mesoamerica. Anthropologist Kent Flannery has an- alyzed the revolution by reference to the "deviation- amplifying" process described by Maruyama (1963). Flannery notes that in Mesoamerica between 5000 and 2000 B.C., an insignificant or accidental "kick" resulted in "experiments" (his quotation marks) with maize that produced genetic changes in that cereal. Until that time, maize had not been the chief, or even an important, source of energy. Nevertheless: Starting with what may have been (initially) accidental deviation in the system, a positive feedback network was established which eventu- ally made maize cultivation the most profitable single activity in Mesoamerica. The more wide- spread maize cultivation, the more opportunities for favorable crosses and back-crosses; the more favorable genetic changes, the greater the yield; the greater the yield, the higher the population, and hence the more intensive cultivation. There can be little doubt that pressures for more inten- sive cultivation were instrumental in perfecting early water-control systems, like well-irrigation and canal-irrigation.(1968:80) Service adds to the above account the fact that the Agricultural Revolution was effected by the Toltecs, Chickimecs, and Aztecs, i.e., the more backward cultures of the region. They had been forced off the fertile grasslands and savannahs into the forest areas by the more advanced hunters and gatherers. It was apparently in these forest areas that maize was first domesticated, adding progres- sively more energy to the formerly backward cul- tures. They in turn "rapidly rose to dominate their own locality and the territory beyond by combining in their own development the most effective aspects of the cultures around them" (1971:39). The same explanation can be made for the Indus- trial Revolution: deviation-amplifying behavior rein- forced by positive feedback changed the cultures of Western Europe and is now changing the cultures of the world. Western Europe had been captured as part of the hinterland of the Roman Empire and had contributed nothing to the Agricultural and Urban Revolutions. When the Roman Empire died, how- ever, the hinterland was not to reestablish its pre- Roman cultural forms. No, it was far more fortunate than that. It was to face an experience, unique in cultural history (Stavrianos, 1970:226-227): namely, 500 years of chaos, violence, political disintegration, economic depression, the debasment of religion, and the collapse of literature (Lynn White, 1966:13). This "irrevocable dissolution of the imperial struc- ture and of its classical civilization" cleared the ground, so to speak, "for the emergence of a new civilization that was free to develop along fresh lines in contrast to the traditional civilizations of the rest of Eurasia" (Stavrianos, 1970:228, 232). The explanation is clear. What the Dark Ages did was to shatter, and shatter repeatedly, the ideologi- cal and social systems of Western Europe. But the chaos did not destroy the technology; on the con- trary, technological innovation was stimulated. "In technology, at least, the Dark Ages mark a steady and uninterrupted advance over the Roman Empire" (Lynn White, 1966:14). The West Europeans in- vented the three-field rotation system and the deep plow, which drastically improved food supply (Lynn White, 1962:42, 69, 76). But most of the technology which set Western Europe on the road to wealth was diffused from other cultures, and mainly China: the horse collar, piston bellows, wheelbarrow, cross- bow, stern-post rudder, as well as the better-known gun powder, magnetic compass, and printing, to name only a few (Needham, 1954: 242-243). In addition to these innovations was the Great Plague of the 14th century that killed from 20 percent to 50 percent of the population of Europe, thus in a matter of a few years drastically increasing the per capita wealth (cf. Spengler, 1968:433-437). We now know that this was the period when Western Europe was in the early phases of the Fuel-Industrial Revolution. Western Europe faced a fortunate set of circum- stances that proved to be catastrophic. Deviation- amplifying behavior, reinforced by positive feed- back, became an accepted part of the behavioral system, and resulted in an evolutionary adaptation. Biologist Anatol Rapoport notes that: "The direc- tion of learning, as well as the direction of evolution (biological and cultural), is determined by two fac- tors: (1) adaptation to an environment or a situation, and (2) what has already been accumulated" (1967:136. Rapoport's emphasis). What this sug- gests is that adaptations occur in a changing envi- ronment so that an adaptation made in 8000 B.C., or 1492, or 1986 is different in each case. The total</page><page sequence="17">236 environment in which adaptations occur has not only changed through time, it has changed by a progres- sive accumulation of cultural factors thus providing a progressively varying environment in which partic- ular adaptations occur. Breakthrough and Latent Cultures Adaptations by any culture are controlled by at least three conditions: the resources available from the environment, the challenges that come from other cultures, and what has gone before or what Rapo- port calls accumulations (1967:136). What these conditions tell us is that cultures vary. Furthermore, from an evolutionary standpoint, not all variations are equally important. Those related to efforts to adapt to some changed environment are of primary concern. Furthermore, in today's world and in fact in the world of the last ten thousand years, there appear to be two groups of cultures extant at any one time. I have labeled these the Cultures of Breakthrough and the Cultures of Latency, which I believe puts development in an evolutionary frame- work. The Cultures of Breakthrough. These are the cultures that lead in invention and diffusion in en- ergy-capture. These cultures are the "cutting edge" of a new breakthrough in general evolution and are pushed along by the natural operation of selective mechanisms. As technological changes cumulate, social systems and ideologies also vary, but primar- ily as responses, generally varying only enough to accommodate the new technology. These are the characteristics that dominated the "advanced" cul- tures of the last five centuries. Their strength lay in their technology, which unfolded largely undirected in accelerating acceleration. Social structures were modified or created (mainly piecemeal) to control and regulate the technological unfolding, respond- ing to new educational needs, labor-management relationships, urbanization, population movement, labor displacement, welfare, social services, etc. The ideology constantly adjusted to include con- cepts of living in a changing technological society, attempting to resolve problems resulting from the loss of traditionalism as a guide to action, and attempting also to incorporate the concepts of sci- ence. Breakthrough Cultures do not know where they are going since they are being moved by the unfolding technology rather than rational goal-attain- ing political systems. In such societies, the political function is not to be goal-directed, but to be reactive and integrative. The Cultures of Latency. These are the cultures that come into cognizance of the general advances after "advanced" cultures have moved well ahead (which may be generations or even centuries after the beginning of the breakthrough). It is here that the ideology of advanced technology gains ascen- dance in the political system. The ideology of the advanced technology is at first the main "modern" aspect of the culture. The particular challenge is to find ways quickly to effect the known possibilities. The ideology, seized by a vision of known possibili- ties, thus attempts to bring by social direction what occurred first by technological accumulation. Thus, in Cultures of Latency, there is a greater certainty among political leaders as to the goals of society? to capture the technological possibilit?s known to exist in the world. Thus the political function is to lead, to be goal-directed. The Political Role in Cultural Evolution Human social systems can be divided into political, economic, religious, educational, military, kinship, class, and perhaps other subsystems. These are directly related to how society is organized to control and regulate its technological system. How- ever, just as the technological system in the main is the most significant determinant of change for a culture, in the sociological system the political sub- system is the main determinant of change. As anthropologist Yehudi Cohen notes: "Once we ac- cept the axiom that there are necessary priorities in cultural change, the attempts to organize a record of human evolution leads to a consideration of the relationship between political organization and tech- nological development. The two are inseparable" (1968:53). In fact, he concludes, "the technological and political institutions of a society are its most important means of adaptation" (pp. 28-29). At least one political scientist, Fred Riggs, has demonstrated a clear-cut evolution of political insti- tutions over the past 10,000 years. At first, he notes, politics operated within a variety of stateless socie- ties, related to hunting and gathering and subsis- tence agricultural technologies. As agricultural tech- nology increased in complexity and populations grew, executive institutions were first invented and by the time of the Urban Revolution bureaucratic institutions were added. More recently, as the Indus- trial Revolution unfolded, legislative institutions and then political party institutions were invented. Today the most politically developed cultures have an executive, a bureaucracy, a legislature, and a party system. These however need not be final ends, because new political institutions will surely be invented which "will enable mankind to cope better with the wide range of problems with which the industrial and automation revolutions are con- fronting us" (Riggs, 1970:97; cf. Leslie White, 1959:293). The political institutions described by Riggs were the results of evolutionary adaptations. Executives come before bureaucracies and both must be in</page><page sequence="18">237 place before the creation of systems of mass partici- pation (which may, but need not, include legisla- tures and party systems). What we mean by un- derdevelopment is that a country, attempting to capture industrialization, has not yet been able to create an effective executive system, a penetrative bureaucracy, and a system of mass participation as the political means to select technological variation; it has not become politically adapted. Conclusions Two of Professor Gans' requirements are met for cultural evolution. 1) There are units of social selection. The political system has the primary role in selecting variations necessary for capturing the available technology. Failures of political systems lead to maladaptations and ultimately the isolation or absorption by suc- cessful systems. 2) New social inventions have occurred indepen- dently of changes in human phenotypes. The mech- anism exists in organizations based on the symbol- ing ability of humans. Variations occur sequentially. Once a successful variation occurs in a culture, other cultures even in different gene pools may attempt to adopt or adapt it. A third requirement for an evolutionary model in Professor Gans' provocative article is that there be some predictive aspects. Here, too, the social model holds, although social science is still weak in this aspect. Nevertheless, some "laws" are beginning to appear that are testable and if corroborated are predictive. Space limitations permit me to list only a few, but these are illustrative: technology is easier to diffuse than are either social or ideological systems; cultures in contact advance faster than isolated ones; the more advanced cultures (technologically and politically) tend to expand in their environment at the expense of less advanced ones; deviation- amplifying behavior supported by positive feedback produces new social institutions; environmental change produces adaptive efforts in a culture; politi- cal systems tend to be reactive in Breakthrough Cultures, proactive in Latent ones. Finally, cultural evolution may be more dependent than biological evolution on punctuated equilibrium. The three great cultural revolutions have had cata- strophic impacts on human societies, but those that have been innovative, experimental, and receptive of change have demonstrated adaptation. So far the process has been by trial-and-error. One can only speculate what might happen if social scientists accepted the evolutionary paradigm and began to focus all their research on the details of the process in social systems. We might even learn how to direct some social change. REVIEW OF "PUNCTUATED EQUILIBRIA AND POLITICAL SCIENCE: A NEONTOLOGICAL VIEW" John M. Strate Department of Political Science Wayne State University Detroit, Michigan 48202 The author does an admirable job of reviewing the arguments both for and against the theory of punc- tuated equilibria. The proponents of the theory, such as Stephen J. Gould (1982), challenge the view accepted by most biologists that evolution is gener- ally a slow process, involving small modifications to species occurring as a result of natural selection, and that speciation and macroevolutionary events are an extension of genetic changes within popula- tions (see Maynard Smith, 1982). Rather, the propo- nents argue that the fossil record reveals that spe- cies are substantially stable and that major changes occur quickly, as a result of punctuational events. Furthermore, proponents argue that evolution is a hierarchical process and that speciation and macro- evolutionary events are largely detached from ge- netic changes occurring within populations. Al- though allopatric speciation does occur, it is not the only, or even the most common way. For example, speciation may occur within a few generations whenever reproductive isolation results from large- scale chromosomal aberrations. As Gans argues, given our present limited knowl- edge of the linkage of organic evolution to culture, the theory of punctuated equilibria provides only a set of metaphors for analyzing social systems. Nev- ertheless, although many would disagree, theory in the area of gene-culture coevolution is improving (e.g., Bonner, 1980; Cavalli-Sforza, 1981; Coming, 1983; Lumsden and Wilson, 1981). In addition, we should have confidence in the evolutionary ap- proach, given the numerous empirical studies using it that have successfully tested hypotheses about human social behavior (e.g., Alexander and Tinkle, 1981; Chagnon and Irons, 1979). Gans grapples with the question of whether the theory of punctuated equilibria is an appropriate model for understanding cultural change and finds two possible applications. Applying the model at the level of the entire social system, we might predict</page><page sequence="19">238 that social systems are generally stable but are subject from time to time to punctuational changes that are not the result of prior genetic changes in the affected populations. It seems likely that most large- scale political changes, such as those that occur in the aftermath of coups, critical elections, natural disasters, revolutions, and war, would be of this type. Such changes may be accompanied by or be the cause of shifts in gene frequencies, but they are unlikely to be caused by them. Applying the model at the individual level, we might predict that rapid changes to social systems are due to prior punctua- tional changes in the phenotypes of individuals within the involved populations. The capacity of individuals to "generate and utilize particular social systems suddenly becomes modified." For example, an event such as a severe economic depression may lead to widespread changes in political atti- tudes so that people are more receptive to social and political change. On the evolutionary time scale, of course, changes that occur to political systems, whether they take a single day or decades, occur nearly instantaneously, in a few generations or less. The historical time scale is much more discriminating. On this time scale, it is obvious that political change can occur quickly (e.g., a coup that occurs in a matter of hours) or slowly (e.g., a change in the party system that occurs as a result of generational replacement and failures in partisanship transmis- sion processes; see Butler and Stokes on the de- cline of the Liberals and the rise of the Labor Party in Britain, 1976). At least two complementary approaches are used to analyze culture from the evolutionary viewpoint. One approach starts with the working hypothesis that cultural traits are adaptive?that is, that they enhance the inclusive fitness of the individuals who construct, maintain, use, and transmit them. Most cultural traits should be adaptive in this sense, since if they were not, they would disappear along with the individuals capable of doing those things. Ac- cordingly, the incidence and distribution of particu- lar cultural traits should be correlated with their effects in different environments on inclusive fitness. The value of this approach is that it permits analysis of the adaptiveness (or maladaptiveness) of particu- lar cultural traits in different environments and ex- plains variations in the incidence and distribution of cultural traits. The approach uses induction and relies on the comparative method to explain varia- tion in traits both within and across cultures. Another approach asks questions about the dy- namics of organic and cultural evolution and the interrelationships between the two. An example is the study by Lumsden and Wilson (1981) which argues that epigenetic rules ("genetically deter- mined procedures that direct the assembly of the mind") are heritable and affect the direction and tempo of cultural evolution. The value of the ap- proach is it explains cultural change. The approach uses deduction and develops mathematical models of gene-culture coevolutionary processes that are similar to those developed in fields such as game theory, population biology, and mathematical sociol- ogy. The theory of punctuated equilibria, although it fails as a general theory explaining political change, does focus attention on the phenomenon of gene- culture coevolution, and thereby raises some impor- tant questions. What is the incidence and distribu- tion of political traits? What epigenetic rules exist that are relevant to politics? What correlation is there between epigenetic rules and the incidence and distribution of political traits? What relationship exists between the construction, use, maintenance, and transmission of political traits and inclusive fitness? What factors affect the direction and rate of change of epigenetic rules and political traits? It is unlikely that most epigenetic rules relevant to politics narrowly circumscribe behavioral options in a manner similar to, for example, patterns of incest avoidance. The political environment is "coarse grained" and its relevance to inclusive fitness is often tangential and indirect. In Western democra- cies, for example, many citizens do not perceive the impact that specific public policies have on them personally, although they can evaluate how their own economic situation and economic conditions generally have changed, and reward (or punish) political officials accordingly. Even when politics is directly relevant to inclusive fitness, as in times of war, individuals are able and often do respond in a variety of ways to an external threat. The question of what factors affect directions and rates of political change is especially interesting because of what has occurred over the last 10,000 years. From a situation where humans everywhere lived in small political systems called hunter-gath- erer groups, today humans (nearly) everywhere live in large, complex political systems called nation states. The number of political systems has dimin- ished substantially, while their size and structural complexity has increased. An obvious, proximate cause of these changes is warfare resulting in inter- polity selection (Carneiro, 1970). Those political sys- tems survived that were best able to defend them- selves in the context of balance of power races (Alexander, 1979). A period of 10,000 years encompasses about 500 human generations, a sufficient time for substantial evolutionary change. It seems likely that warfare, because of its direct and indirect effects on fertility and survivorship (Maxson, 1985), generates the po-</page><page sequence="20">239 tential for directional selection and, presumably, changes in epigenetic rules. In addition, because of political changes induced by the existence of exter- nal threat, because of its potentially destructive effects on political systems and the members who construct, use, maintain, and transmit them, and because of the diffusion of political traits, warfare alters the incidence and distribution of political traits. Thus, warfare would seem to be at least one "catastrophic" event that has the potential for pro- ducing punctuational changes in politics and a rapid rate of gene-culture coevolution. MORE THAN METAPHORS: A COMMENT ON GANS' ARTICLE Tat? Vanhanen Department of Political Science University of Tampere 33101 Tampere 10 Finland Carl Gans' article is of great interest for political and other social scientists because he deals with the central problem of biopolitical research. The prob- lem is how to apply, and whether it is possible to apply, biological theories to the study of political and social phenomena. He tries to determine whether biological examples and theories can be applied to the social sciences as models, with the implication that they represent equivalent mecha- nisms, or as convenient metaphors that facilitate communication. Gans uses the theory of punctuated equilibria as an example and asks what is the potential utility of this theory to the social sciences in general and to political science in particular. He discusses the biological side of the problem thor- oughly and very informatively, whereas his presenta- tion on the application of biological theories to the study of social phenomena is shorter than I ex- pected and hoped. I limit my comments to some points on which I slightly disagree or would like to extend his argumentation. Gans emphasizes that the case for punctuation is weaker than that for gradualism and that the genetic mechanism of change may be the same in both cases. In other words, the theory of punctuated equilibria represents only a variation of the tradi- tional Darwinian theory of evolution. It seems to me that from the perspective of the social sciences the difference between these two interpretations is not crucial. In both cases the observed phenotypes are produced by the interaction of genotypes with the environment. Natural selection is the major mecha- nism that tests the phenotypes, although their changes are also caused, among other factors, by various catastrophes, as Gans points out. But what are the phenotypes of the political and social world which are tested by natural selection? I think that Carl Gans has not paid enough attention to this question, although he discusses it. My argument is that social and political systems represent extended phenotypes and that they are tested by natural</page><page sequence="21">240 selection in principle in the same way as individual phenotypes. Gans mentions that the application of theories from biology as models for the social sciences would require that the biological terms involved are indeed appropriate in this context and that they are congruent to the pattern underlying the social sys- tem. I agree with this requirement, but I would like to add that the terms of the theory of natural selection may fulfill this requirement. It seems to me that it provides a theoretical basis to show that social systems are, and that they must be, affected by natural selection. I think that the most important point of this theory is the claim that natural selection is a result of the necessity to struggle for survival in a world of scarcities. Gans does not emphasize this aspect of selection. I emphasize this aspect be- cause it provides an important link between biologi- cal and social phenomena. Politics is also principally a struggle for survival in a world of scarcities. One can assume that social and political systems evolved in this struggle and that they have continu- ally been tested by the same process of natural selection as other phenotypic characteristics. Social systems can be regarded as collective organs which help people in the struggle for scarce resources. This argumentation rests on ethological and sociobi- ological theories which claim that natural selection acts upon the patterns of behavior as well as upon bodily organs and that behavior patterns are as constant as comparable physical characteristics. Social and political systems are institutionalized forms of behavior. Gans concludes that "the theory of punctuated equilibria at present can provide students of social systems with little more than metaphors" and that "the emergent principles of any similarity do not appear to derive from possible roots in biology." I would like to argue that the theory of evolution by natural selection (and probably also its variations like the theory of punctuated equilibria) can provide students of social systems not only with metaphors but also with an explanatory model, because social systems can be regarded as extended phenotypes which are tested by natural selection in the same way that other phenotypic characteristics are tested. My point is thus that the units of comparison can be assumed to be congruent. From this perspective one could hypothesize, for example, that the periods of stable social and political systems are correlated with stable environ- mental conditions, whereas drastic changes in envi- ronmental conditions inevitably cause relatively large and sudden changes in political systems be- cause it is necessary for them to adapt to environ- mental changes. Carl Gans' article emphasizes the necessity of discussing thoroughly the question of the congru- ence of biological and social phenomena from the perspective of evolutionary theory. A satisfactory theoretical solution of this problem would remove one stumbling block which has hindered the ad- vance of biopolitical research.</page><page sequence="22">241 AUTHOR'S RESPONSE When I accepted the invitation to participate in the symposium designed to deal with the applicability of the biological theory of punctuated equilibria to the political sciences, I admitted to some concern about the level to which communication might be possible. Unfortunately, our meeting produced less of a dia- logue than I had hoped. Consequently, I am pleased at the nature and general tone of the comments elicited by the editor of this journal. In responding, I would like to start with comment on some minor or specific disagreements and then to present my overall impression of the review. Whereas I do not wish to be nitpicking in evaluat- ing definitions, there are some restatements which I must note as not matching my set of paradigms. The first one, deriving from Dr. Phillips' account, is his statement that evolution leads to progressively more efficient use of resources. Certainly, this does not apply to organisms in general; many organisms, for instance the mammals, have evolved a pattern that lets them acquire enough resources at a rate that permits their inefficient utilization. Furthermore, the statement incorporates the assumption that there is some absolute standard for efficiency; it does not take into account that resource bases, of whatever kind, will change both with time and as a result of evolution. Role depends on environment, not only on the properties of the phenotype. Next, Dr. Johnson takes me to task for not sepa- rating micro- and macroevolution. I attempted to avoid this particular can of worms because, some of the cited authors to the contrary, I do not see a quantum jump, but a gradation, as do some of the other authors cited by him. Naturally the evolution of major features is less common than the evolution of minor ones; however, I would argue that phenotypi- cally major features grade into minor ones. I do take issue with his explanation that associates punc- tuated equilibria with concepts of allopatric specia- tion and peripheral isolation. The latter concept figures prominently in classical speciation theory, cf. the works of Ernst Mayr. They should not be pre- empted as part of the hypothesis of evolution by punctuated equilibria, even though I admit that the latter has been defined variously during its develop- ment. Another point that deserves attention is Dr. Strate's comment that certain characters must be adaptive, otherwise they would have disappeared; this seems to represent what Gould and Lewontin in another context have referred to as a panglossian view of adaptation. Hence, it cannot be accepted, not even as shorthand. There are many mechanisms that retain traits in a population without the aspect which we may be looking at being adaptive. Now to a more general response. In my statement I provided three potential utilizations of the theory of punctuated equilibria to the field of political theory. The first was in its use as a metaphor. Secondly, it would be pertinent if punctuational changes in the genetics of human populations would thereby pre- dispose their members to an understanding and utilization of different approaches to politics. Thirdly, it would be pertinent if there were an independent theory of the evolution of political systems with the mechanism of political change being congruent to those developed in evolutionary biology. As I read the responses, no one argues that the hypothesis of punctuated equilibria should be used as a strict metaphor, although, for instance, Dr. Johnson noted that the theory was valuable be- cause it generates exciting interest and might be used as an analogy. As the theory appears to owe some iniital debt to the social sciences, it is not too surprising that it now appeals to students of the field.</page><page sequence="23">242 Two of the commentators (Strate and Vanhanen) explicitly accept the idea that there are changes in the genetics of human populations that underlie changes in the accepted social-political systems. They specifically argue that social traits are adap- tive, but neither define the level nor the time scale on which adaptation occurs. Thus, Strate's argu- ment that a depression might change people's approach to political solutions surely represents a phenotypic modification without any documented genetic feedback to the human genotype. Strate's observation that people do not perceive the impact of political events presumably would have no bear- ing either on the heritability of the learning capacity or on the extent to which they would prove to be adaptive. Conscious selection has never been pos- ited as a basis for adaptation. Vanhanen notes that social systems may be tested as extended pheno- types on the same basis as any other phenotypic characteristic. This possibility, which I raised, re- mains appealing but still requires some proof. Drs. Ghiselin, Johnson, and Phillips argue for potential applicability of the theory of punctuated equilibria to the evolution of social systems, al- though Dr. Ghiselin accepts its utility and Dr. Phillips does not do so. Most interesting to me is that the three kinds of arguments proceed on drastically different bases and refer to almost completely non- overlapping sets of references. Dr. Ghiselin's arguments seem to have a philo- sophical basis completely different from that of the other ones; he treats species as individuals, in the ontological sense. Furthermore, the topic of scien- tific revolutions was neither mentioned in the sympo- sium nor in my essay. If this level of argument is accepted, the concept of punctuated equilibria may well have applicability. However, this is clearly nei- ther the level on which the symposium, from which my essay derives, proceeded nor the one on which my essay was written. The recasting of the original question in Dr. Ghiselin's framework and the discus- sion of scientific revolutions would require a sepa- rate discussion. In his account, Dr. Phillips appears to move along the edge of feedback from cultural evolution to changes in human genetics. There is no question but that major and minor political and social events have effects on the fitness of individual members of human populations and that they may lead to changes in genotype frequencies. The question is whether these changes modify the capacity of mem- bers of such populations to accept or reject particu- lar theories. In reading the several accounts, I felt that posi- tions were being stated on the level that trial lawyers refer to as "initial discovery " 1 do not wish to take this particular metaphor further, but only to note that additional discussion involving repeated informal exchange might be the most useful supplementary step, particularly for a topic that involves sets of data as diverse as the present ones. Perhaps the need for such communication, rather than problems posed by the academic division of labor, might be a key issue that needs to be dealt with in the future. References Alexander, R. D.
