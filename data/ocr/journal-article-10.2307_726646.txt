<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERSONALITY IN OPERA THE well-meaning doctrinaires who would reduce operatic composition to the rigid mathematical routine of engineering or cookery, are as surely engaged in beating the air as those who inveigh against the s star ' system. It is pathetic to filnd cleverness so far over-reaching itself as to show worship to the phantoii of a formula, and forget that, as St. Chrysostom wrote: ' The true Shekinah is Man.' For opera is nothing if not the triumph of the personal. ' Man is a gregarious animal' we have long been told; and opera alone of all the arts adequately answers to man's instinctive communal longings. You cannot date the beginning of opera; for its essential funda- mental principle was evident in the ancient Greek chorus, in the primitive choral dance, in the village masques of medieval England, an,d those who have been present at a Zulu war-dance (as I have) would find in it a very obvious and close relationship with part of the second act of ' Gotterdammerung.' I have known a critic to condemn the latter as a blot on the artistic homogeneity of Wagner's great tetralogy; but consistency is no more to be found in Wagner's works than in any human being-because they were the expression of Wagner's humanity. That is one of their chief claims to greatness. His theory of the music-drama was an axe to chop down the choking weeds of old conventions, and also to cut trees to build with for himself-but he could never have contended that an axe alone would suffice to build a beautiful house. Those parts of ' The Ring ' are dullest where it is plain he allowed his prideful skill in the use of that implement to carry him beyond the borders of good balance; those parts are divinest where his human instinct made him fling the axe aside in favour of the palette and brush, as in ' The Spring Song ' in ' Die Walkiire,' the third act of ' Gotterdammerung,' and the love-duet in the last act of ' Siegfried.' His human personality burst out at those and other similar moments, despite all his laboratory-wrought theories, to put a golden aureole on works that might otherwise have never survived outside the study. The length of life-by which I meain public operatic life-of each of the Wagnerian operas will probably prove to be exactly in proportion to the personal element in them. We should realise at a first hearing that ' Die Meistersinger ' is immortal, even if we knew nothing of the personal mood that inspired it; and ' Tristan ' also</page><page sequence="2">PERSONALITY IN OPERA 165 is surely for all time because it gives us Wagner's burning personal expression of what Thomas Hardy has called ' the strongest passion known to humanity '-a passion as uiniversal and eternal as the pain of non-fulfilled or thwarted desire, which is also idealised in that masterpiece. That opera's tribute to the power of a towering personality is the more striking inasmuch as, in form at least, it more faithfully follows the stern aesthetic precepts of Wagner than any other of his works, and might even be supposed from a first superficial glance at the score to be almost anti-human in its stern denial of set choruses and of concerted nunibers, and of what might be called fat singing opportunities; yet we know it for the most glowingly human opera in the repertoire. thanks to its composer's all-conquering personality. ' Rienzi,' on the other hand, will die because it was written, as per recipe, purely to please. There is nothing of Wagner, the man in it: only the composer. In other words, we say that ' Rienzi ' is no more sincere than Meyerbeer's ' Huguenots.' But what is sincerity in music; since we know that Charpentier was consumingly sincere when he wrote ' Julien,' and yet (if my own judgment on hearing the work in Paris is any criterion) it is as little likely to live as the two first-mentioned works? What is the difference? What is this ' sincerity ' about which we all talk so glibly? Let us take ' Louise ' and ' Julien.' The difference is that one is emotionally sincere, and the other is only intellectually well-intentioned; one is the veracious expression of an ardent personality-and the other is merely the pedant's expression of his own proud braininess. We feel that all the laboured mental processes in ' Julien,' in d'Indy's 'Fervaal,' in Zandonai's ' Conchita,' in Joseph Holbrooke's ' The Don,' in Strauss's 'Ariadne auf Naxos ' and in other operas of the class, strike no chord common to the whole of humanity. We miss the precious saving flashlight of a personality that is akin to us ordinary folk. Or you might ask who could question Brahms' sincerity? But it is again an intellectual sincerity only. Brahms looks down pityingly from his lofty eminence on struggling humanity-and humanity pays him out by preferring Beethoven, Schumann, Schubert, Mozart, Chopin, or Tschaikowsky, who did not throw their brains in our faces, but gave us high heart sincerity as experienced in their own persons! Again, Berlioz's operas are (in this country, at any rate) dead as last year's mutton because, despite all his originality in rhythms, colour, etc., he never gave us himself: his music is curiously unemotional, giving us neither pleasure nor pangs-and the same may be said of BMito's ' Mefistofele.' It is in the opera-house, the festal-house of the people, where, more than anywhere else, the supreme test of success is the</page><page sequence="3">166 MUSIC AND LETTERS personality of composers and artists. For here men and women meet in cheerful communion in a way hardly possible otherwise, not even in church. Yet both the village church and the opera-house are supremely social; for, as Novalis said, ' Religion is a social thing, and impossible without a church.' But we are now beginning to realise with the great poet and mystic, William Blake, that Art is Christianity, and Christianity is Art. The high-priests of all Art are not necessarily those with the most marked personalities, but those with the genius that enables them to put their personalities on paper! Puccini seems to delight, as it were, in laying bare his innermost sentiment-but Strauss only wants us to understand what a whole heap of marks he could win at the examinations if he were a school- boy. Only Puccini could have written the Puccini operas; or Verdi the Verdi operas; but any skilled musician (despite the strong personality with which Strauss is ' credited ') might have written most of the operas of Strauiss, if only he could devote time enough to the elaboration of technique, alnd to the search for strong (if not unsavoury) librettos. For the operas of Strauss are not personal. It is the human touch that matters more than anything in opera because, as the Chinese proverb has it, 'All are brothers under Heaven '; or, as Thomas Carlyle expressed it, 'A Person is ever holy to us; a certain orthodox Anthropomorphism connects Me with all Thees in bonds of Love.' But that human touch must be authentic! Then it is sure to respond to something in the soul of every one of us. That is the answer to the critic who complains that the man who is putting his personality into his music is putting a limit on his art. For we know (and Ralph Waldo Emerson says the same in a fine essay) that all existing or conceivable things have their place or their echo in every human soul. And the man of imagination has power to project himself mentally into any kind of situation whatever that may be foreign to him-and the same applies to the great artist. His body is as a mirror that can receive any impression -and then show it to us finer than the original. Or you may say he takes crude ore and transmutes it into gold. It is because his personality has the saving touch of universality! Thus, Verdi can make his music just as convincingly portray the pot-valiant swagger of Falstaff as the poignant death-bed laments of Othello. He can be all things to all men. But if it might be pleaded that the supreme reign of personality in music would make for monotony, and that, in short, we might get different composers treating the same dramatic situation in approxi- mately the same way, the reply is that, however much composers may be alike in their soul-essence, they will always have certain external differences due to their nationalities, their parentage and</page><page sequence="4">PERSONALITY IN OPERA 167 their training. As the old blacksmith once said, as quoted by William James, there is very little difference between men, but what difference there is is mighty important. This difference would always show itself in opera, in the matter of form. Humperdinek, Charpentier, Bizet and Verdi could have moved us with the fate of Madame Butterfly, yet what a difference there would have bewen in their scores! That, however, would be only interesting from the point of view of variety; and what does matter above all things is that each in his own way would have moved us if he had written an opera on that libretto-for all of those composers rank as human personalities. But imagine Brahms or Bach trying to do justice to the pathos of the little Butterfly's story! Imagine Strauss trying to give us the headstrong passion of youth, and the glowing romance of Paris in ' Louise'! He would blow all the sentiment out of it with his orchestral howitzers-and leave nothing behind but a very imposing piece of musical architecture, void of humanity. And yet the devotees of Strauss, Brahms, Schonberg, Max Reger, or Maurice Ravel will tell you that the music of ' Otello' or Butterfly' or ' Pelleas ' or ' Turandot ' or ' Carmen ' is not great, judged simply as music! How pitiful that they should have over- looked the true mission of music, which is not to emulate the business of the fashion-creators of the Rue de la Paix, or to work the science of cross-breeding to death, or to build up intricate edifices according to architects' plans, or to work faithfully (like cooks) upon patented recipes, but to fertilise our spirits! We seek in music for some moving echo of our own fears, joys, sorrows, or yearnings; and that operatic music is most satisfactory which most humanly and faithfully and ardently mirrors the subject it deals with-never mind whether it is correct according to formula or not. We are interested in our souls-and not in the queer mental contortions of an isolated neurotic composer or two. What is another great virtue of personality in operatic compositions? It enables the composer to make his characterisation vital, compelling and unerring. You could shut your eyes during a first performance of ' Tristan ' without knowing anything of the story or of the language in which it is sung, and you could not fail to recognise immediately the characters of the persons singing. In all the composers of personality-Bizet, Charpentier, Debussy, Moussorgsky, Mozart, Puccini, Humperdinck, Verdi, Wagner and the rest-characterisation is a creed; and, even when not consciously practising it, they are contributing to it in some indirect but equally effective way. For example, here and there in ' Louise ' you may say that the music a character is singing is an expression n6t so much of that character as of the drama of the moment-but the xn. B</page><page sequence="5">168 MUSIC AND LEUTTERS point is (and Charpentier probably well knew it) that this does not matter at all when character and drama are essentially and inseparably corporate, as should be the case in a good libretto. Again, take the case of Puccini's ' La Tosca.' I have seen the complaint that in the second act the characterisation is negligible; but apart from the obvious fact that, in such a tumult of warring emotions, clear-cut characterisation at every poimt would be next to impossible and indistinguishable, the total impression which Puccini has cleverly conveyed is that right throughout the act he has characterised its dominating personality-Scarpia! The personality of Scarpia broods over it all and lifts us out of ourselves. We realise intensely his dark scheming and wolfish lusts; and even though Mario'.s ' Vittoria ' or Floria Tosca's tuneful ' Vissi d'Arte ' may not be subtle characterisation they yet serve the great purpose of throwing the Scarpia music into relief. But in the last set (and quite right) it is the lovers who are characterised. In a rough general way, again, the music of ' Madame Butterfly ' is the whole intimate personality of Cio-Cio-San-and ' La Boheme' is simply Mimi. It may be a miniature, but it grips; it convinces; it justifies itself. For when you have grasped the personality of the protagonist in those operas you have also grasped the characters of those who merely serve as foils. Similarly, the whole ' star ' system has its immovable bedrock basis in this hunger of the people for a great personality. The doctrinaire theorists may rage against the iniquities of the system; but, as Thomas Carlyle showed us in his ' Heroes and Hero-Worship,' our reverence for the great personality is a force stronger than ourselves., and universal into the bargain. Besides, the whole basis of grand opera is personal (like the business of making war); we must have our leaders and guides and lode-stars; and, even if we willed it other- wise, the operatic system would create ' stars ' of its own accord. For we must have singers of phenomenal technique for the early decorative Italian operas; we must have towering personalities who can sing greatly and act greatly and pose greatly in the modern music- drama; we must at any rate (having regard to the sadly limited number of successful operas) have ' stars ' who will attract of them- selves and give new lustre to old works. We could not possibly put on ' Faust' for a long run with a cast of merely adequate mediocrities- but in Paris they have given long life to that work (as Covent Garden has to ' Traviata ' and ' Rigoletto ') by constantly gving the principal parts in it to great personalities from all countries. The supreme personality is the one who can monopolise a part without any change ever being called for or desired-such as Ternina in the old days as Isolde; Calve as Carmen; Victor Maurel as Iago;</page><page sequence="6">PERSONALITY IN OPERA 169 Plan9on as Mephistopheles; Mary Garden as Thais or Louise; Emma Eames as Elsa; Tamagno as Othello; Scotti as Searpia; Destinn as Aida, Senta or Madame Butterfly; Lehmann as Sieglinde; Elizabeth Schumann as Sophie; and Van Rooy (or Schorr) as Wotan. So all-conquering is personality in opera that we are often content to accept a singer in a part for which he or she is obviously physically unfitted. (This is why no one really cared a cent about the embon- point of Alboni in the old days.) Who cared that Sammarco was too plump and too placid of features to make quite the typical soldier as Lescaut in ' Manon,' or that Scotti so sadly lacks the natural billowy spaciousness of figure for the part of Falstaff? The sin of over-acting is much greater in the case of the lyric than the purely dramatic stage, because in the former case both the orchestra and voice should have their own histrionically eloquent appeal. When the artist over-acts or gives you calculated artifice you may fairly suspect that there is something deficient either in her personality or her voice. For the supreme personality (like Lotte Lehmann or Frida Leider, or Olczewska) does not exert herself fo stand higher than, and apart from, the opera, but rather sets herself to express the essence of the opera through her own idealising medium! She would not allow her personality to swamp the personalities of others in the cast, well knowing that it is only by aid of their sympathetic co-operation that she can win her fullest effulgence; and she could nlot possibly concentrate her powers on an exposition of herself instead of her r8le without being traitor to her art. Whatever rendering of a part a great personality gives, we must always accept (however we may secretly disapprove of it) as an original contribution from the well of Truth; for it is the strong foundation of the universal in such a personality that makes versatility quite natural. Ternina, Leider, Ivogiin, Rethberg, Sammarco, Marcoux, Scotti, Fremstad, Chaliapine, Van Rooy, Jean de Reszke, Destinn, Renaud and Matzenauer may be numbered in this class; and, if you know the difference in the acting of great artists in the same part (say, for example, Sammarco, Scotti and Marcoux as Scarpia) to be simply the difference in their personalities, yet you find each far superior in some way to the same impersonations of all lesser artists. And you can never control your keenness to see an artist of this type in any new part, whereas you know off-hand just how the small personality would present fifty or more r6les. Would you not agree, if Covent Garden could give us a Tamagno, Titiens, Trebelli, Patti or Pasta again? A. P. HATToN.</page></plain_text>
