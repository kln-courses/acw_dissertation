Present and Future Radiation Dosimetry for Russian Cosmonauts. Radiat. Res. 148, S24-S32 (1997). This report describes the features of the cosmic-radiation monitoring system defined by the parameters of cosmic radiation and by the conditions of operation of dosimeters in space. The objectives of the operative and personal monitoring on board Russian spacecraft have been defined and substantiated. Accord- ingly, the operating characteristics of the dosimeters used during the flights of Russian manned spacecraft are given. The feasibil- ity of perfecting the radiation monitoring facilities to be used in future manned space missions is discussed. The methods used by the Radiation Safety Service during manned space missions are described. ? 1997 by Radiation Research Society INTRODUCTION Cosmic radiation constitutes one of the most adverse factors in space flight and defines the need for in-flight radi- ation safety of cosmonauts. The effects of cosmic radiation become even more important as longer manned space mis- sions become practical technologically and feasible both economically and scientifically. In view of the above, the necessity of appropriate meas- ures for ensuring radiation safety in space flights cannot be doubted. The conventional approach in this case is to preclude any adverse effects by restricting the impact of radiation. A standard or set of standards that would take into account any possible radiation effect, as well as the characteristic features and the feasibility of a given type of space flight, can be the basis of a quantitative index of radiation safety. In principle, different parameters (dose, radiation risk, reduction of life span) may be selected when making quantitative estimates of the effects of radi- ation. All of the parameters should, however, meet a num- ber of requirements, thereby making it possible to esti- mate the radiation hazard to cosmonauts in each of the space flights. The requirements necessitate that: (1) allowance for any possible radiation exposures predicted by any of the models of radiation hazard being used be as complete as possible, (2) the characteristics of radiation exposure (including the sources of the radiation and the effects of the radiation on the human body as well as on individual organs) be known, (3) the radiation hazard level be expressed quantitatively so that the valuable experience and information gained from radiation safety practices in the past can be used to advantage, and (4) an estimate of the radiation hazard level be made using stan- dard methods and equipment. The logic of the above approach is shown in the block dia- gram in Fig. 1. From the figure it can be seen that the major constituents of the scheme include the dosimetry that can satisfy item (4) regarding the particular parameters adopted. On the other hand, the monitoring in the above approach is an element of the overall radiation safety program and, as such, will be affected by all the rest of the elements. In addition, the above approach to radiation safety must include some relevant characteristic activities, namely con- stant monitoring of the radiation environment with an indi- cation of any deterioration therein, identification of the radiation environment and prediction of the evolution of the environment. Bearing these features in mind, the radi- ation safety program described above as applied to a space- craft should be regarded as a radiation monitoring system that incorporates all the other prominent on-board systems. From this it follows that the radiation monitoring system must satisfy all technological, ergonomic and operation requirements of the on-board systems. RADIATION SAFETY NORMS AND RADIATION MONITORING SYSTEM Maintaining radiation safety and general safety in long- term space flights is a complex multi-faceted problem that includes: (1) development of optimal protection of space crews against constant sources of ionizing radiation such as galactic cosmic rays (GCR), radiation belts and sporadic bursts of solar cosmic rays (SCR); (2) in-flight radiation monitoring based on continuous measurements of the radi- ation fields outside and inside spacecraft; and (3) timely determination of in-flight radiation risk. The radiation in low-Earth orbit and in deep space out of the Earth's magnetosphere is characterized by its compli- cated composition and by an energy spectrum that ranges from a few keV to hundreds of GeV, which results in greatly different biological effects. This is unlike the Earth's S24</page><page sequence="2">RADIATION DOSIMETRY FOR RUSSIAN COSMONAUTS S25 Norms based on the 1 Radiation sk radiation risk idea during the flight Complete set of radiation What is the "weight" effects and their distribution ICRP-60 of each effect? with respect to radiation risk recommendation The radiation T o fThe model of the environment  The model of theefct S environment .effects I model influence (radiobiological) physical control biological control Investigation and diagnostics of the Shielding Protection Biological Functionil ual e to Dosimetry radiation environment shielding radiobiological effect FIG. 1. Structure of the problem of radiation safety in space flight. radiation environment, which consists primarily of low-lin- ear energy transfer (LET) radiations and in most cases is uniform. Irradiation that may occur during a space flight is characterized by irregular dose distribution both in time and in depth. The maximum exposure could occur in differ- ent phases of the flight and at different stages of the adapta- tion of the cosmonaut's body to the conditions of the flight, which might affect the cosmonaut's resistance to the effects of the radiation. Currently in Russian space radiation standards, the con- cept of generalized dose is used to assess radiation risk for cosmonauts, and the complex radiation in space is con- verted to a single value. The generalized dose, H, is consid- ered to induce exposure the same early and later radiobio- logical effects as the more complex radiation in space (1). The calculation algorithm in the general form is pre- sented as H[Sv] = D[Gy] . QF TF SF, (1) where H is a generalized dose, D is mean tissue absorbed dose, and QF is the quality factor, which accounts for the different biological effectiveness of cosmic rays in accor- dance with the established model of radiation hazards (Fig. 1). For example, for the carcinogenic hazard, the QF rec- ommended by ICRP 60 (2) should be used. SF is the coeffi- cient of spatial nonuniformity of irradiation that allows for the character of the distribution of the dose in the body and converts the effects of nonuniform irradiation to uniform exposure. TF is the coefficient of temporal nonuniformity of irradiation that allows for the influence of dose rate and temporal dose distribution and converts the effects induced by persistent and fractionated irradiation to the effects of a single acute exposure. The multi-component nature of cosmic radiation and the specific conditions of space flight, which include hypergrav- ity, microgravity, hypodynamic state and long-term psycho- logical stress, requires that the Eq. (1) be modified. There- fore, it is more correct to use the following expression to calculate the generalized dose: H[Sv] = Di[Gy] " QFi Ti SFi MF, (2) where Di, QFi, TFi and SFi are the corresponding values of the mean tissue dose and the coefficients for the ith source of radiation hazard; MF is the modification coefficient of irradiation owing to the factors of space flight that are not related to radiation. The conversion from complex exposure to a standard exposure necessitates the construction of models that allow for the impact of the spatial and temporal nonuniformity of irradiation and models and algorithms that would describe the radiation quality more accurately, determine the modi- fication of the radiation effect by factors other than radi- ation and determine the respective coefficients for each of the types of cosmic radiation. In the orbital and interplane- tary space flights with their potential for radiation exposure, despite the real protection by the spacecraft itself, protec- tion of the blood-forming organs is crucial because damage can reduce the cosmonauts' capacity for work as well as their radioresistance. Therefore, the radiobiological con- cepts concerning radiation-induced damage to the entire organism and the blood-forming organs of mammals (including humans) were used to construct the algorithm for calculating the generalized dose. The concept of equal dose equivalent, G[D(i)], is introduced, and its mathematical model is formulated by analyzing damage to the blood-forming organs as a func- tion of absorbed dose taking into account the spatial dis- tribution of absorbed dose, D(Q), to convert the effects of nonuniform irradiation to uniform exposure and to deter-</page><page sequence="3">S26 V. M. PETROV mine the values of SF (3). As defined, the equal dose equivalent, G, is the equivalent dose of uniform irradi- ation, causing the same degree of damage in the blood- forming organs as the nonuniform irradiation. Simultane- ously the proportion of blood-forming stem cells rescued in the different parts of bone marrow is compared. In ref- erence (3) it is shown that, under persistent low-level irra- diation, when the equivalent dose rate for each part of bone marrow does not exceed 5 cSv/day (for orbital space flights), the equal dose equivalent, G, coincides numeri- cally with mean bone marrow dose, Dbm, and can be cal- culated as G = Dbm = i " D(Qi), (3) where Ni is the relative distribution of red bone marrow at the representative points of anthropomorphic phantom of the skeleton, which is the standardized model of the human body (4); D(fi) is the equivalent dose in the ith representa- tive point, which is determined according to the standard document as: L max D(Q) = XD(S) w (, i)A, (4) i=l where D(5) is the equivalent dose below the tissue layer ( taking into account the attenuation of the radiation; o(5, Fi) is screening function for the ith point. The coefficient of spatial nonuniformity irradiation, SF, according to Eq. (1) may be determined as: D max SF = G / D = G/ m(D)DdD, (5) D min where m(D) is the partial body mass, when the equivalent dose is in the range from D to D + dD. Both the early and late radiobiological effects depend greatly on the dose rate and its change over time, the con- cept of effective dose is introduced and the model of effec- tive dose, Def(t), is worked out for conversion of long-term effects of irradiation to a standard acute exposure. Equa- tion (6) gives the formulation of the effective dose for the relevant conditions: doe dDef = K(D) D(t) for t &lt; 7; dDt dDe = K(D) D(t) dt (6) - o exp{-[X0 + Xr(),t)]t} Def(t - 7) for t &gt; T; where D is dose rate in cSv/day; K(D) is the coefficient of effectiveness of prolonged irradiation, which is dependent on dose rate, and the rapid repair processes at the cell level; r is the delay time when the recovery of the organism is effective; 130o, h0 and Xr are the experimental parameters that define the recovery rate of the organism as the whole. The values of these coefficients are presented in ref. (5). The values of the coefficients of temporal nonuniformity of irra- diation TF, which enter expressions for generalized dose (Eqs. 1 and 2), may be inferred from the relationship TF(t)= Def(t)IJD(T)d. (7) 0 To calculate the values of effective dose, Def(t), and the values of the coefficients TF(t), it is necessary to acquire infor- mation about the changes in the absorbed dose rate during space flight with the radiation monitoring system dosimeters. The effective dose in time t, Def(t), is the integral j dr from Eq. (6). The values of the quality factors of cosmic radiation, QFi, entered in Eq. (2) for the generalized dose may be obtained from the mean quality factors inferred from the readings of the on-board radiation monitoring system dosimeters that measure the LET spectra. The QF values can also be obtained by calculating the relative contribu- tions from different sources of cosmic radiation to the absorbed dose. The mean QF values are calculated by the formulas prescribed by ICRP publications and by other guidelines for the dependences of QF on radiation species or on LET (2, 6-8). The dependence of QF on LET adopted in the Russian Space Radiation Safety Standards is given in Appendix I. The radiation modification factor, MF, may be obtained by analyzing the radiobiological data on the variations in the radioresistance of the organism under a combined effect of the standardized radiation species and the other factors not related to radiation that are inherent to space flights. The current value of MF is unity. The probability and degree of later effects depend partly on the dose distribution in the body and the dose rate of the radiation. Therefore, the above approaches to estimating the hazard of in-flight effects may be used to determine the probability and severity of some late effects. It is necessary to evaluate the possibility of an increased risk of cancer during the cosmonaut's life span. In cases where the dose distribution in the different organs of body is not uniform, the effective equivalent dose, recommended by ICRP and the Earth radiation safety standards, currently accepted in Russia, may be used as the generalized dosimet- ric function (2). This dose is defined as: D = CWTDT using the data for the mean equivalent dose to the different organs and tissues, DT, taking into account tissue weighting factors, oT, in determining the relative probability of cancer in differ- ent tissues when the whole body is exposed uniformly. In the estimation of the radiation hazard it is accepted that there is an increased risk when the space mission is of long duration and that excessive exposure could result in risk of mortality due to acute effects (9). The radiation risk [the generalized radiobiological effect, F(H)] for cosmonauts in flight is calculated in terms of the</page><page sequence="4">RADIATION DOSIMETRY FOR RUSSIAN COSMONAUTS S27 TABLE I The Standard Values for Flights of Different Durations Controlled hourly Flight duration, Standard level of radiation Limited permissible equal equal dose equivalent T (months) risk, Rad (X 10-4) equivalent dose, Gn (cSv) rate, AGn (iSv/h) 1 0.60 10.5 146 3 1.80 21.5 100 6 3.60 37.0 85 12 7.20 66.5 76 18 10.80 93.5 71 24 14.40 118.5 68 30 18.0 140.5 65 36 21.50 162.5 62 mathematical model of the effect as a function of the tem- poral distribution of the generalized dose rate, H(t), and the value of the generalized dose, H(t) (10).

All the constants mentioned above are presented in ref. (10). The model of generalized radiobiological effects has been taken as a guideline for the development of standards for exposure to radiation during long-term space flight (11). The standard values for radiation risk are established based on the duration of the flight using the expression: Rnad(T) = 0.6 x 10-4T, (11) where the risk is a dimensionless number (see Table I) when T is the duration of the flight in months. The values of permissible equal dose equivalent as a function of the duration of the flight were established according to permissible levels of radiation risk based on the following equation: Gn(T) = 0.05 + 4[1 - exp(-T/72)], (12) where Gn is in sieverts if T is in months. In Table I the permissible doses for flights up to 3 years in duration are presented. The standard set for radiation risk for flights and the hourly equal dose equivalent rate for control of the radiation conditions on the spacecraft to con- form with standard levels of radiation exposure are also shown. The dose limits for cosmonauts for a single acute exposure induced by a solar particle event and for the entire career of the cosmonauts are 50 cSv and 4 Sv, respectively. Some specific requirements follow. First, it is necessary to monitor the tissue absorbed dose rate continuously by determining the average hourly levels of absorbed dose. Such detailed monitoring is necessary to control the radi- ation environment and to predict the possibility of a change for the worse. In addition, controlling the temporal behav- ior of the absorbed dose rate makes it possible to define (except for the indicated dosimetric values) the values for effective doses and the coefficients TF of the temporal nonuniformity of radiation exposure, which are necessary to calculate the generalized doses based on Eq. (2). Second, dosimeters must be able to measure the absorbed dose rate over a large range, from jiGy/h up to 0.5-1 Gy/h. Third, to define the quality factor of the cosmic radiation and values of equivalent doses, the dosimetric equipment on board the spacecraft should be able to make measurements in a broad range of LETs, from 0.3 keV/tm to 1500 keV/im. Since sporadic solar particle events (SPEs), as well as disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere, can lead to con- siderable changes in the radiation environment during flight, it is necessary to estimate the doses taking into account changes in the spacecraft's radiation environment. In the simplest form such estimates can be made using continuous measurements of the absorbed dose rate during the flight using dosimeters placed behind the different shields. Such monitoring is equivalent to continuous meas- urement of the depth-dose curve, which changes depend- ing on the spectral characteristics of the radiation. The type of change in the rate and the depth-dose curve define the initial data for making the estimate of the complex dosimetric functions.</page><page sequence="5">S28 V. M.

Finally, the radiation monitoring system must provide information which allows one to predict (at least some hours ahead of time) the type of change in the radiation environment along the route of the flight and inside the spacecraft. In Table II the requirements for the radiation monitor- ing system are shown. It should be noted once again that quantitative data are required for the design of future space vehicles built for different types of missions. The dosimetric and radiobiological criteria that are established for manned space flights necessitate that the doses be calculated for representative points inside a phan- tom to be placed in the areas of a spacecraft inhabited by the cosmonauts. The spherical phantom (4) simulates a cos- monaut's body. The representative points in the phantom are located at depths of 0.1, 0.3, 5.0 and 9.0 cm to simulate skin, the ocular lens, hematopoietic organs and the diges- tive system. Following ref. (12), we used the tabulated self- shielding functions for the representative points in the spherical phantom. The dose D (f) at a representative phantom point T was found to be D(f) = D(x) oW(x, F)dx, (13) where D(x), the dependence of the dose on a planar Al sheet thickness, is taken to be of a tabulated form; o(x, 7), the screening function at representative point i, is also taken to be tabulated. The screening function, ow(x, F), at representative point 7 is the probability of obtaining a mate- rial thickness in the range between x and x + dx around the point of interest. The doses were calculated for nine positions on Mir for the spectra of radiation-belt protons and solar cosmic rays with different characteristic rigidities. The doses were normalized to the calculated R-16 dosimeter readings to obtain tabulated</page><page sequence="6">RADIATION DOSIMETRY FOR RUSSIAN COSMONAUTS S29 TABLE III Scaling Factors from R-16 Readings (KR16) and from Personal Dosimeter Readings (Kpers) to Doses at the Representative Points of Phantom during Solar Minimum Doses KR16 Kpers Absorbed 0.60 1.54 Mean tissue 0.22 0.56 Skin 0.39 1.00 Ocular lens 0.37 0.94 Blood-forming organs 0.20 0.51 Digestive system 0.20 0.51 values of scaling factors from the on-board dosimeter read- ings to the doses at the representative points of a phantom placed in various inhabited zones of the Mir station. The doses were calculated on the assumption that the contribution of GCR is -4 x 10-5 Gy/day during solar minimum and ?3 x 10- Gy/day during solar maximum. The trapped proton spectrum is obtained by the superposition of daily particle fluxes calculated with the AP-8 model (13) for different energy intervals. The spectrum is obtained in a tabulated form. Daily trapped proton spectra for the Mir station orbit are presented in Appendix II. The solar cosmic-ray spec- trum is described as -exp(-R/Ro), where the characteristic rigidity varies within the range of 50-200 MV (14). As an example, Table III presents the scaling factors KR16 and Kpers from the doses measured with the R-16 instrument and with personal dosimeters to the doses meas- ured at the representative points in the phantom during solar minimum. The doses to different organs during the flight are estimated by multiplying the dose R-16 measured with the dosimeter by the appropriate scaling factor KR16. The total flight doses for the organs of the body are esti- mated by multiplying the personal dosimeter doses by the appropriate scaling factor Kpers. ON-BOARD RADIATION MONITORING SYSTEM In view of the foregoing, the radiation monitoring system is one of the core elements of the system of radiation safety on manned space missions. Its function is to monitor the radiation environment in station habitats and provide for assessment of the radiation dose to the crew throughout the mission and toward its completion. In principle, these esti- mations must be made for each crew member individually. However, fulfillment of this requirement in flight will add significantly to the complexity of the structure of the radi- ation monitoring system. Hence, with allowance for the parameters of Mir and Salyut orbits, which are well pro- tected from space radiations by the geomagnetic field, the radiation monitoring system was designed so that the radi- ation effect is assessed as a mean crew dose for the entire flight (on-board radiation monitoring subsystem). Differences in the exposure of each member of the crew are identified by the readings of individual dosimeters upon return to Earth (individual radiation monitoring subsystem). In experiments aboard the Salyut stations, the parameters of the radiation fields were investigated in each of the space modules. It turned out that the differences at the gradient of two measuring sites could be greater than a factor of 2. Also, cosmonauts could work in different locations of the station, whereas active dosimeters (R-15 on the Salyut stations and R-16 on Mir) were allocated to one fixed point of the station. The necessity to upgrade the radiation monitoring resulted in the incorporation of portable self-sustained active dosimeters which allowed measurement of the absorbed dose in practi- cally every part of the space station, including directly on the cosmonauts. Moreover, new radiation safety limits that in- cluded more rigorous limits for crew exposure were adopted, and a new criterion, radiation risk, was identified. Hence, based on one of the major principles of space dosimetry, the assessment of dosimetric variables specified in these limits required the use of data from existing radiation monitoring systems, which were based on different criteria (11). The technique of this assessment has been presented above. Meanwhile, the practice of radiation safety opera- tions in space station missions and the tendency toward fur- ther reduction of permissible limits demand modernization of the radiation monitoring system, to improve accuracy in assessment of the impact of radiation on the health of cos- monauts and to give an accurate account of the character of the exposure to heavy charged particles. In accordance with the general requirements of the radi- ation monitoring systems outlined in ref. (15), the present orbital dosimetric monitoring must ensure that the follow- ing goals are accomplished: (1) real-time evaluation of the radiation environment through calculation of equal dose rate and radiation risk to crew; (2) consideration of the spa- tial and temporal nonuniformity of crew exposure during assessment of the generalized dose; (3) radiation monitor- ing of the station in flight and comparison of measurements with the design model; and (4) supply of the ground Radi- ation Safety Service with sufficient information about the radiation status of the station to assess the conditions and to generate recommendations for the crew aimed at reducing exposure levels if the conditions deteriorate. Hence the purpose of the orbital radiation monitoring system (ORMS) largely boiled down to monitoring radi- ation levels on the station and assessing the doses received by body surfaces and the blood-forming organs. To combine these tasks, the R-16 orbital dosimeter was installed somewhere in the mid-station with as little shield- ing as possible from the station structures and hardware. The actual shielding of the dosimeter in relation to its loca- tion was calculated with the geometric model of the station. Also, in the process of development of the device it was assumed that extra shielding of its detector must simulate the in-depth position of blood-forming organs. Therefore, the design of the device allowed the mounting of two iden- tical ionization chambers as detectors, one of which was wrapped in a tissue-equivalent filter 3.5 g/cm2 thick.</page><page sequence="7">S30 V.

Error in dose measurement at a dose rate of 1.4 x 109-1.4 x 10-7 Gy/s is no worse than 20%; at a dose rate of 1.4 x 10-7 Gy/s, it is no worse than 10%. Dose is measured with two IK-5G ionization chambers. The walls of argon-filled chambers are made of tissue-equivalent plas- tic material, the inside surface of which is covered with graphite. One chamber is used to register the surface dose. The shielding of its working volume is no thicker than 0.5 g/cm2. The personal radiation monitoring subsystem, which is an important part of the manned spacecraft radiation safety system, is essentially aimed at measuring the per- sonal dose during space flights. The operative equipment of the personal monitoring system on board the Soyuz series of spacecraft and the Mir and Salyut space stations included the ID-3 (used in 1967-1982) and ID-3M (1982-1995) packages of integral dosimeters. In the packages, the Russian-made alu- minophosphate glass-based TLDs were used as sensors of absorbed dose.' The package includes six TLG-2 detectors to measure the integral dose from 10-7 Gy to 0.5 Gy induced by 10-1000 MeV protons, 1-2 MeV electrons and 0.15-3.0 MeV y rays. The detectors are 13 x 13 x 4-mm plates with their major faces polished; five TLG-6 detectors are used to measure the integral doses from 10-3 Gy to 5.0 Gy induced by 10-1000 MeV protons, 1-20 MeV electrons and 0.04-3.0 MeV y rays (through a compensating filter). The detectors are cylinders with a diameter of 5 mm and a height of 15 mm with the ends polished. The tissue doses are measured in the above ranges of doses and energies within an error of +20%. The IPD-2 personal active dosimeter has been designed for measuring integral absorbed dose within definite inter- vals and for prompt estimation of the dose rate when in orbit. The dosimeter is made of an ionization chamber with 4 atmospheres of pressure and encased in metal, an elec- tromechanical dose integrator with a dial on the panel, an electronic unit and a power unit. Depending on the given pressure level (the real pressure was below 4 atm), the sen- sitivity of the instrument is 3-5 x 10-5 Gy/pulse. The meas- urement error does not exceed 20% in the range of dose rates of 5 x 10-6 to 2 x 10-1 Gy/h. The maximum measur- able tissue dose with the IPD-2 is at least 10 Gy. The ID-3M packages were first used as personal moni- toring instruments for cosmonauts on the Salyut-7 mission (1982) and are still being used on board the Mir. During September-October 1989, the reading of the orbital R-16 and IPD-2 dosimeter allowed us to determine the dynamics of the exposure of the cosmonauts and to develop recommendations on how the exposures could be reduced (16). IPD-2 was delivered to the station by a cargo vehicle in early October; its readings were used for analysis of the radiation environment on the Mir during the October SPE. During the Mir-5 mission between September 5, 1989, to February 2, 1990, which coincided with the maximum of the 22nd solar cycle, 10 SPEs were recorded. Four of these SPEs on September 29 and October 19, 22 and 24 resulted in significant alteration of the radiation environment of Mir. Armed with the data from the R-16 and IPD-2 orbital dosimeters (Table IV), we can easily assess the effective- ness of the recommendations made by the radiation safety service. It is seen that the dose measured by the R-16 instrument is approximately three times greater than that measured by the IPD-2 unit. To assess the radiation risk for the space crew during the SPE under consideration, we must compare the exposure and the radiation risk caused by the SPEs with the radiation exposure limits. As pre- scribed by the Russian national radiation exposure limits for space crews (11), the radiation equivalent dose from all sources in missions lasting as long as 5.5 months must not be greater than 34.4 cSv and the radiation risk must not exceed 3.3 x 10-4. Previously it was said that the radiation risk for crew members had not been exceeded and reached 2.22 x 10-4 and 2.95 x 10- for flight commander and flight engineer, respectively.2 By the end of the solar flare period the equivalent doses received by cosmonauts amounted to 3.4 cSv, and therefore, despite the significant alteration in 11.

CONCLUSION The material in the preceding sections allows us to out- line more clearly the requirements of the radiation moni- toring system for long-range orbital and interplanetary spacecraft. The need for more accurate and continuous determinations of radiation doses to individual organs of the human body and the feasibility of determining the quality of radiations must be some of the key principles of radiation monitoring aboard future space vehicles. It seems reasonable to base the concept of radiation hazard on the radiation risk to individual cosmonauts and to establish sufficiently sophisticated dosimetric parameters, including adequate assessment of the risk associated with the possi- ble acute exposure of cosmonauts during SPEs. Finally, the growing complexity of flight operations and the related necessity to enhance the independence of the crew mem- bers stipulates the need to increase the amount of auto- matically transmitted data on radiation exposure for the purpose of not only registration of the radiation conditions at the time of transmission but also assessment of the situa- tion on board and its possible evolution to reduce the pos- sibility of radiation hazard. The above postulates the requirement to develop a more complex radiation moni- toring system with some new functions that can predict and analyze the radiation conditions on board the space vehi- cle. In view of the goals of the radiation monitoring system, the system should be divided into two parts: the ORMS, aimed at determination of current and predicted radiation levels along the trajectory and in station modules, and the individual radiation monitoring system, which is intended to determine individual doses of each crew member over the entire flight. This system of radiation monitoring which is under development must provide the following: (1) con- tinuous measurement and storage of dose-rate levels at work sites and in crew quarters, (2) the determination of the spectra of the protons and electrons outside the space station, (3) visual presentation of ORMS information and audible warning and caution signals in the event of deterio- ration of the radiation environment, and (4) transmission of information about radiation conditions. APPENDIX I Dependence of Cosmic-Radiation Quality Factor on Linear Energy Transfer According to the Russian standard (see ref. 8) the dependence of QF on LET is presented by the following equation: 1 - exp(-o1l - a2l2) QF= where 1 is in keV/jlm, a0 = 2.34 x 10-4 pm/keV; a1 = 2.14 x 10-4 Fm/keV; and a2 = 4.75 x 10-5 (pm/keV)2.
