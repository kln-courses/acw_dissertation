<plain_text><page sequence="1">Losses from Natural Hazardst By CLIFFORD S. RUSSELL* IN THE LAST TWO DECADES interest in such natural events as floods, earth- quakes and hurricanes, often called nat- ural hazards, has grown more widespread and more intense. This is true in the federal government where, for example, the Small Business Administration and the Civil Defense authorities have ex- tensive responsibilities in an area which once was the preserve of the scientists and engineers of the Geological Survey and the Corps of Engineers. In the academic world, psychologists, sociolo- gists, anthropologists and economists have joined engineers, climatologists, hydrologists and geographers in working on one or another aspect of the problem.' Several reasons for this expanded in- terest may easily be found. On one level, the ability of television to bring the impact of natural disasters home (lit- erally) to large numbers of people has created a background climate of aware- ness, sympathy and concern about pos- sible local occurrences of these same disasters. A second spur to natural hazard research activity is the hypothesized simi- larity, in their impacts on human society, between some of the more violent cli- matic and geologic crises and a nuclear attack on one or more cities. This line of inquiry has seemed especially inter- esting to students of the phenomena of leadership, group interaction, etc., in such disciplines as sociology and social psychology, and to those concerned with government policies to assist recovery operations.2 A third reason for increas- ing public and private investigation of natural hazards is the feeling that ad- vancing technology will, in the fairly near future, give us some measure of control over a number of presently un- tamed hazards, such as lightning, tor- nadoes and even hurricanes.3 Finally, and perhaps most important, there has been growing pressure from both inside and outside government for improvement in the criteria on which public expenditure decisions are made. This general reforming trend has im- plied quickened specific interest in nat- ural hazards, since many governmental projects are designed to protect against or warn of natural events such as flood, drought, hurricane and tornado, and the benefits to be attributed to such projects are the losses avoided over the future. Thus, flood control works are intended to reduce future flood losses; public sur- t The author is grateful to Professors Robert Kates and David Arey for the initial, stimulating discussions which led to this paper, and to Professor Donald J. Volk for the suggestion that relevant future adjust- ments were a key to a firm conceptual basis for loss studies.

It is our aim in this paper to discuss some of the principles and problems associated with the estimation of losses from natural hazards. First, we argue that a particular level or severity of natural event becomes a hazard only in relation to existing human adjustments. There are, then, no strictly physical definitions of what levels of severity of natural events constitute hazards.4 Actual estimates of losses are always based on a combination of a particular natural event and an existing state of human adjustment. It follows that losses are a measure of the relative success of human adjustment to variable nature, and that losses from a natural hazard should, in principle, always be measured with some future adjustment to that hazard in mind. Now, the fact that we emphasize the central role of human adjustments to natural events in defining hazards and measuring losses suggests that it will be valuable to explore more fully the range of available public and private adjust- ments and to discuss the relation be- tween the two sets; in particular, this presents the problem of incentives created by public institutions aimed at private decision makers. Here we must also deal with the relation between in- dividual perception of a hazard, private adjustment to it, and prevailing social views of the losses suffered. Hazards and Events: Natural Forces and Human Adjustments Nature is always with us in the sense that natural events are always occurring: the sun is shining or the sky is cloudy; streams are flowing at particular rates; the earth's crust is in perceptible motion or it is not. Over a somewhat longer run, an event might be the cumulated pre- cipitation, or the hours of sunshine. Some of these events pass essentially unnoticed; they are merely the back- drops for normal life. Such normal events usually correspond in some way to the long-run average experience of the people and place in question. A few events, on the other hand, are character- ized as hazards, disasters or catastrophes, and we should be clear about the ways in which such events differ from normal natural events. In particular, is it pos- sible to characterize hazards purely in terms of the qualities of the events them- selves? At first glance, there would seem to be one clear difference between hazards and non-hazards for a particular time, place and population.5 That is, hazard- ous events tend to be extreme events, to be found far out in the tails of the relevant probability distributions. Thus, floods are, in a general sense, character- ized by very high streamflows; droughts by extremely low cumulations of pre- cipitation over given periods. But even this line may not be pursued too far; some of the most dangerous snow storms 'Similarly, there are no purely man-made hazards. Man may opt for (or have forced on him) relatively less adequate adjustments to some natural phenomenon; this will in general increase the frequency and severity of hazard occurrence by lowering the necessary level of severity. Nature still must act, however. 5Clearly certain events which would be extreme hazards for one group may be the stuff of normal routine for another. We only need think of ourselves living with the Eskimo or the desert Bedouin to see this.</page><page sequence="3">LOSSES FROM NATURAL HAZARDS 385 in terms of social disruption are very common in terms of the snowfalls in- volved. This example, indeed, points out to us that hazards can be defined only in terms of impact on human society, and hence that they must be seen as the joint product of the events occurring in na- ture and the existing human adjustments to those events., Since hazards are so named because they cause economic damage and social disruption, the level and type of economic activity existing in an area, the institutional framework of the society in that area, and the pre- vious decisions about specific adjust- ments to the natural event in question are all involved in assessing that event's hazardous character. For example, that streamflow which is exceeded only five per cent of the time (the 20-year flood) will have very different effects in different basins de- pending on such variables as the degree of channel encroachment and the ex- tent of commercial occupance of the lower levels of the flood plain. A rain- fall shortage so severe that only one per cent of such events can be expected to be worse, may well wreak havoc with farmers without irrigation, while scarcely being felt by city people served by a large enough surface water storage sys- tem. There is no wind-speed/wave-height combination beyond which a tropical cyclonic storm is inevitably a hazard to us (though there is such a line to sepa- rate gale, storm and hurricane). If a most severe storm comes ashore in a relatively deserted area, it need prove a minor inconvenience only, while a far weaker storm hitting a heavily built up and poorly protected resort can do enormous damage. Thus, while we may say that, in the same human setting, a more severe natural event will cause greater damage and disruption, once we allow that set- ting (the result of past adjustments) to vary, no such simple statement need hold. If we wish to extend our understand- ing of natural hazards, it is necessary to introduce the notion of the relative adequacy of existing human adjustments. A measure of relative adequacy shows the relation between man's "demands" on nature and his ability to devise a system for serving those demands. For example, in the study of the impact of drought on municipal water supply systems, one possible measure of the relative inadequacy of man's existing adjustment is the ratio of potential de- mand to system safe yield.' Potential demand is the amount system customers would (on the average) like to withdraw from the system for given price, etc. Safe yield is the amount the system is able to deliver under all but some small per cent of the possible low flow events (often 5 per cent). Thus, if demand is relatively much greater than safe yield, a low flow event less severe than the 5 per cent will be sufficient to create short- age, and vice versa. As another example, consider a pos- sible measure of adequacy of adjustment to snow storms. Take a city with M feet of streets of average width W feet. As- sume that from historical data it is determined that only 5 per cent of all snowfalls can be expected to be worse than one depositing T tons per square foot per hour. Then the five per cent snowfall event would be one depositing o Professor Kates suggested this definition to the author in connection with a study of the recent North- east Drought. The same idea is clearly at the heart of the flood studies conducted by various of the geog- raphers associated with Gilbert White and the Uni- versity of Chicago. Clifford Russell, David G. Arey and Robert W. Kates, Drought and Water Supply: the Implications of the Massachusetts Experience for Municipal Planning to be published by Johns Hopkins Press.</page><page sequence="4">386 LAND ECONOMICS M x W x T tons per hour on the city's streets.8 This becomes a probabilistic reference point analogous to water sys- tem safe yield. Here, however, we might say that the aim of adjustments is to keep the roads as free as possible of ac- cumulations of snow, so that M x W x T may be taken as one measure of the city's probabilistic requirement for snow re- moval service. If the city has, at a given time, the ability to remove (by chemical or physical means) R tons per hour, the ratio of (or difference between) R and M x W x T is a measure of the adequacy of the city's adjustment to the snow hazard.9 The greater R relative to M x W x T, the less probable a storm severe enough to accumulate snow at a rate greater than the removal capacity of the city (and hence, presumably, to cause traffic delays, accidents, etc.). Adjustment and Loss: A Model for Decision Making The above examples should make clear that to attribute losses to a natural event alone is misleading. Loss studies must, at least, recognize explicitly that losses are the joint product of man and nature. Thus, though it may be of some intrinsic interest to display losses from some natural event in relation to a mea- sure of the severity of the event's physical impact, it is necessary to be clear that this measure of physical impact reflects both the actual severity of the event and the state of human preparation for the event. It is, however, desirable to go beyond recognition of the general character of the losses measured during and after natural events. Because man decides on the adjustments which affect his losses, the matter of real interest is the future, not the past, and the losses we are after are those which will be avoided in the future if we make this or that decision now. The purpose of measuring past losses is, then, to estimate the relation- ship among natural variation, extent (adequacy) of adjustments and resulting losses. The loss estimates, to be of value, must be those relevant to contemplated adjustments, present or future.10 A potentially useful framework for the study of the economics of natural hazards is shown graphically in Figure 1. Here the horizontal axis represents the relative adequacy of adjustment (A) to 8We assume for purposes of our illustration that quantity of snow falling per hour is the only im- portant dimension to the snow hazard. This is not, of course, true. The character of the snow itself (whether it is wet or dry), the air temperature and wind-speed during its fall, the existing snow cover con- ditions, and the time of day of the storm are some of the other dimensions which will, in fact, be im- portant. o Note that it will not matter, in general, what point on the snowfall probalility distribution function we choose for our requirement number. What matters is the underlying distribution itself, for it will deter- mine the expected losses. 10The word contemplated is to be interpreted in the widest sense to include any conceivable adjustments, not just those now technologically or politically feasi- ble. Clearly loss studies aimed at potential benefits from far out schemes will have much to do with whether or not the schemes become seriously considered. a - C E V t $ of L+C Relative adequacy of adjusesnt (A) Relative adequacy of adjusment (A) Figure .

On the vertical axis we measure annual dollar amounts. The curve labelled L repre- sents the expected annual losses from the hazard under study for any partic- ular level of adjustment. The curve C is the annual cost of achieving any given level of adjustment. Losses fall as higher levels of human adjustment are achieved; the costs of achieving successively higher levels of adjustment will, naturally, be in general higher.12 Clearly, the best level of adjustment is the one at which the sum of (adjustment) costs and ex- pected losses is the least. In Figure 1, we show this level of adjustment, A*, as that corresponding to the lowest point on the curve L + C, the vertical sum of the cost and expected loss curves.'3 The study of losses from a particular class of natural events should, then, be seen as an integral part (at least poten- tially) of the process of evaluating alter- native human adjustments to those events. The point of this statement is not that we should have fewer or even less comprehensive loss studies; it is merely that studies which ignore the role of human adjustment are, at best, of very limited usefulness and at worst may be seriously misleading guides to public expenditure. The most familiar viola- tions are those which purport to tell us the average annual losses from this or that natural hazard suffered by the United States. These studies, appearing both in the popular and professional literature, implicitly assume a stable average correspondence between natural events of particular severities and hu- man adjustments of a particular ade- quacy. Thus, a study which estimated the average annual losses from snow- falls on the urban areas of the United States for the last 25 years could be using annual loss estimates which re- flected trends in the climate (the distri- bution of snowfall events) or in snow removal capability relative to urban street system size, or in both determi- nants. Even if there is no reason to suspect a trend in climate or average level of adjustment, however, the re- ported losses stated in this broad way are relevant only to further adjustments totally ridding the nation of the urban snowfall hazard. This will never be possible for any hazard because there are, in general, no upper limits on the severity of the natural events involved. But, in any case, such efforts would surely be enormously expensive relative to the losses avoided. As we illustrated above, what is important is the point at which it no longer pays to incur costs to avoid losses. In the flood control field, concentrat- ing attention on the role of high stream- flows and ignoring the importance of human adjustments in the creation of losses from flooding have led to an ex- pensive program of public investments accompanied by an escalating total of annual losses. Here the problem seems n We assume that, for any particular study, the region or political entity of interest could be relatively easily identified. This choice, and the related choice of an economic point of view for measuring losses (e.g., national or local) will have significant implications for the actual measurement of losses. See, C. S. Russell et al., op. cit., Chapter 10. ' The calculation of annual costs requires the choice of some planning horizon (finite or infinite) and of a rate of discount. For most hazard studies it will be desirable to take account of changing human require. ments over time, as in the growth of a street system which requires plowing. 1If we graphed marginal costs and the negative of marginal expected losses against the adjustment level, the level A* would be found at the intersection of the two curves. There is, however, no reason to expect the intersection of the total cost and loss curves to occur at A0. This point is sometimes confused.</page><page sequence="6">388 LAND ECONOMICS to have been that general public sym- pathy for those who suffered in the dra- matic floods of the thirties was translated into public investment in reservoirs, flood walls, etc., erected with minimal arrangements for the sharing of costs with those benefitting. These measures have been augmented by public and private relief programs for ex post as- sistance to flood victims. The combina- tion has been sufficient to encourage rapidly increasing private investment in flood plains, for the costs of such private decisions have, in effect, been publicly borne. Very little has been done by way of flood plain zoning or the provision of incentives for private flood proofing of individual structures.14 Adjustments to adjustments have thus confounded the original goals of the program by ap- parently increasing expected annual loss- es for virtually every basin even while massive structural works have changed the frequencies of occurrence of flooding of key parts of the flood plains. A truly relevant flood loss study would take ac- count of these private adjustments but not just by projecting increased use of protected (or semi-protected) areas and hence raising both the benefits of the structural measures and the expected losses from catastrophic floods. Rather, flood losses should be related to mixes of private and public actions, to private flood-proofing as well as public control reservoirs.-5 Recognizing explicitly that flood losses depend on private decisions and not only on variability in stream- flows might dampen some of the enthu- siasm for the programs presently distort- ing the decision processes of individuals. Discussions of the proper size of and appropriate mechanism for redistribu- tion toward those inhabiting flood plains could be freed from the present rhetoric about victims who bear losses for the rest of society. Private and Public Adjustments to Natural Events The adjustments possible in the face of variable, and sometimes hostile, na- ture may be categorized in any number of ways. Some consist largely of fixed investments (flood control dams), while others involve primarily recurrent ex- penses for personnel, etc. with only a relatively small capital base (weather forecasting). Some are inherently public (zoning regulations), other private (flood proofing of individual structures). Some involve physical interference with the actual natural events (weather modifica- tion), others are merely attempts to smooth out the effects of natural varia- tions (reservoirs), and still others involve only the control of human society (parking regulations for snow storms). As our discussion above has pointed out, one of the key questions to be asked in any natural hazard study is the extent to which contemplated adjustments inter- act; that is, particularly, the extent to which certain public measures serve as spurs to other private adjustments which may or may not be in the direction of reducing the expected future costs. There are, however, two other inter- 14 See, for example, G. F.

First, consider the situation in which there are no justifiable addi- tional adjustments.'6 What, then, is the conceptual role of an estimate of ex- pected annual losses? What other actions are open to private actors? What should be the public (social) stance? Second, in discussing private adjustments of any sort, it is necessary to keep in mind the conditions under which decisions about such adjustments are made, particularly the private attitudes toward nature and natural variation which may be expected to influence private coping with poten- tially hazardous natural events. If, for every level of additional human adjustment to a particular class of natu- ral events, the marginal costs of the available adjustments are greater than the marginal expected losses, then we may say that no adjustments are justified. Such a situation may be represented graphically as in Figures 2A and 2B. In Figure 2A, we show a set of marginal cost and marginal loss curves for which no further adjustment is justifiable; the status quo (if that is the way we choose to define the zero adjustment level) is better than any contemplated change. In Figure 2B we show a set of total cost and loss curves which could lead to the situa- tion in Figure 2A. The minimum point on this L + C curve is at A = 0.17 What, if anything, remains for the in- dividual to do in such a situation? Es- sentially, one may suggest that some form of spreading of losses either spa- tially or temporally will improve in- dividual welfare. Compulsory insurance against the risk, with premiums based on expected losses, would reduce the variance of every individual's income and presumably result in an increase in welfare so long as those involved are (2A) 0 Level of adjustment x Minimum C r / (2B) - lo S A* Level of adjustment (A) Figure 2. No adjustment justified. risk averters.'8 If the insurance scheme covered the same risk in widely scattered areas with independent natural events, 16 For a definition of "justifiable" in the context of our model, see the discussion below. 17 To say that no adjustment is justified is to say that the damage-cost comparisc.as for all adjustments lead to the same situation as depicted in Figure 2. Specifically, it will be necessary to consider such alternatives as moving out of the hazard area as well as environmental modification and investment in physi- cal protection. Changing technology will often result in new kinds of justifiable adjustments and so no characterization of hazards according to whether or not adjustments to them are possible will be valid permanently. 18And, as Krutilla has discussed (op. cit.), such a scheme could serve as the basis for efficient allocation of costs if and when some loss-reducing adjustment did become feasible.</page><page sequence="8">390 LAND ECONOMICS expected value would be a sufficient measure of risk and the overall variance of losses would be reduced. Some pro- vision for insurance might be made even within a single area (e.g. hail insurance in a single county) if sufficient allowance were made for the between-year variance of losses, either in the size of premium payments (e.g. by paying premiums such that the probability of exhausting the insurance fund in any year would be less than or equal to some small num- ber), or establishing a sufficiently large and long-term line of credit to prevent ruin. With the same qualifications, an individual might undertake self-insur- ance in an attempt to even out his time stream of income. In such a situation, new decisions about locating in the region should al- low for the expected annual losses from the unavoidable hazard. Thus, the proper price to pay for forest or farm land in a region with known precipita- tion distribution (both inter- and intra- year) would reflect the discounted sum of expected annual earnings allowing for droughts.19 Similar statements would hold for other enterprises (and even for private homes with weather-sensitive lawns) to the extent that they depend on the availability of direct precipita- tion. The situation changes, of course, when it is justifiable to store and pipe water. These are adjustments which will reduce average annual drought losses and the question becomes one of the proper degree of adjustment. (It may still be worthwhile to insure in some way against residual losses.) Note that if an insurance scheme is in existence for the area and the risk in question, this expected earnings cal- culation will be an easy and obvious one for the most hard-headed man of busi- ness, for the insurance premiums will be an annual cost of doing business. It is, of course, in situations for which no expert evaluations in the form of in- surance policies are available that indi- vidual attitudes toward and perceptions of nature become particularly relevant for these will be central to the choice of a risk allowance. Indeed, individual knowledge and perception will be im- portant to every type of private adjust- ment including those aimed at decreas- ing future expected losses, so long as the individual is not required to buy a particular expert, actuarial view. Thus, the impact of our remarks below goes far beyond the problem merely of cop- ing with unavoidable losses. One last matter, however, needs to be cleared up in relation to unavoidable losses. That is, given that private factors have open to them a number of ways of improving the time pattern of such losses, what should be the social view of the losses suffered in any given year? Of the long-run average of such losses? Basically what is important here is the ability of society to transfer real income over time in such a way as to smooth aggregate social welfare, as the insurance- type transfer payments we have discussed smooth the income streams of groups within the society. At one extreme in this respect, we may conceive of a society in which the unavoidable expected (annual) losses in real outputs are known and which has 19Allowance for the variance of the return may or may not be necessary, depending on the relative im- portance for the buyer of the income stream involved. For example, a large paper company with forests all over North America could almost certainly ignore variance. A small lumber firm relying entirely on a single wood lot probably could not. The expected an- nual earnings would probably be different from the earnings associated with average annual rainfall. If diminishing returns of tree growth to rainfall hold, the expected annual earnings will be less than the annual earnings from average rainfall (all ignoring intra-year distribution).</page><page sequence="9">LOSSES FROM NATURAL HAZARDS 391 a system for accumulating stocks of these outputs in good years for use in bad years. The rate of accumulation of these stocks would be a function of the vari- ance of losses, depending on the degree of assurance the society wished to main- tain that it would not be ruined, and on the availability of foreign aid. (We note here that Joseph's problem was rela- tively simple because he was faced with a determinate nature. Our locusts, droughts, floods, earthquakes are less re- liable.) In such a society, the relevant indices of economic welfare would be those calculated net of the provisions for future losses for such netting out would reflect the true state of society's relation to nature. Since we have assumed no further adjustments to be possible, such an index could be uniquely defined us- ing the annual product under natural conditions optimal for the existing state of adjustment.20 At the other extreme, a primitive so- ciety with no means of storing its prod- ucts (e.g., a hunting/gathering society without means of preserving meat) has no particular reason to be concerned with expected losses since it has no smoothing option. Indeed, here the en- tire concept of loss is of doubtful useful- ness. It would seem that concern with losses from natural hazards is something relevant only to groups having at least the option to make allowances in ad- vance for such events.21 If a society is in a position to at least anticipate (on the average) the losses it has no economically justifiable way to avoid, then actual year-to-year occur- rences of loss should already have been taken into account in the society's eval- uation of its welfare position. The level of economic activity enjoyed in a par- ticular year is not so important as the average level sustainable in the face of nature (for the given adjustments). In- deed, here again, the word losses may not seem very useful as a name for the difference between optimal and actual production. What may very well be dis- cussed as loss (or gain) is the difference between some anticipated stream of pro- duction over a relevant planning hori- zon and the actual results achieved. If, over 50 years, the initial projections of average production prove optimistic, it seems quite natural to say that the so- ciety has suffered a loss. To say this, however, in relation to a single year for which the results are worse than average is to imply that gains are made in each year that production is above average, and essentially to ignore the implica- tions of society's self-insurance option. Perception and Adjustment: Human Views of Nature For our discussion of the losses at- tributable to a particular combination of natural variation and human adjust- ment, two facets of man's general view of nature are of considerable interest. First, since efficient adjustment to na- ture requires explicit recognition of the random quality of certain natural events, we should like to explore some soThese observations are relevant to the usual in- dices of aggregate economic activity such as GNP. Here the problems of dealing with natural hazards are complicated by present conventions which include the investment total for each year as an addition to welfare for that year, and the future streams of produc- tion from the investments as additions in the years of accrual. At least, however, it should be recognized that what is of interest is the expected annual level of such an index, net of unavoidable expected annual losses from randomly occurring natural events. Year- to-year fluctuations in GNP due to such events do not reflect corresponding fluctuations in aggregate welfare to the extent that rational provision has been possible. 2 This observation is of some interest in connection with our discussion below of man's view of his rela- tion to nature. A society without even our "smoothing" option is very much like a part of nature rather than something different from, and partly in control of her.</page><page sequence="10">392 LAND ECONOMICS common human perceptions of natural randomness. Second, because as we have pointed out, the usefulness and, indeed, the very meaning of losses from events hinges on the ability of society to adjust either to avoid or insure against them, it will be worthwhile to mention certain relevant cross-cultural variations in views of man's relation to nature. Kates and others, in studying flood- ing, have found that people living with a natural hazard tend to adopt one or another view of the future denying the randomness of the size and timing of the events.22 Some adopt the view that the hazard is a repetitive, cyclical event. This implies no need to worry about floods until just before the repetition is due. Others use a naive law-of-averages approach, claiming that the occurrence of a flood in year t reduces the prob- ability of experiencing one in year t + 1.23 This has a similar, if less dra- matic, implication for action as the first view. For some time after the occurrence of some bad event, we are relatively safe from its recurrence. Another strategy is to wish away the hazardous character of the event by renaming it or lowering its amplitude to the commonplace. Thus, a flood becomes a spring freshet or just high water. Finally, some residents of hazard areas avoid thinking about the event at all by invoking a higher power --in particular by referring to God's will. It does no good (and may actually do harm depending on one's view of God's resentment over meddling hu- manity) to attempt to deal rationally with what is clearly part of the un- fathomable plan of an infinitely superior mind. These strategies all work in the direc- tion of discouraging private adjustment to avoid expected losses. Since, in fact, events such as floods do not seem to be cyclical or to behave as the naive law of averages would suggest, those who are anxious to avoid probabilistic views are likely to be caught out time and again. This probably encourages an emphasis on losses, since nature has been more than merely random: it has been actively perverse. The contributions to American cul- ture of the northern European peoples seem to have included a view of man as a master of nature. There is certainly evidence that such a view tends to be the dominant one among the rural white protestants so important in our agricul- tural sector.24 It seems likely that a feel- ing of mastery over nature is even more highly developed among city-dwellers, whatever their cultural backgrounds, for they are very largely cut off from direct contact with a harsh nature. It may be hypothesized then that most people in our society are, in general, unwilling to see nature as other than man's servant. A stress on losses from natural hazards arises easily from a vague faith in the ability of science to find and apply con- trols to even the most spectacular events. On the other hand, a view of nature stressing man's oneness with her forces might be expected to accompany rela- 22Robert W.

Kates, "The Perception of Natural Hazards in Resource Management," Natural Resources Journal, January 1964, pp. 412-41. ~ Note that there are hazards f-r which serial cor- relation of events is important and well established. For example, if streamflows are known to be low in year t, it is more likely that they will be low in year t+ 1 than we would predict from the long-run per- centage of low-flow years.

As we suggested above, a hunter-gatherer society without the means to store food over seasons or years is, in a very real sense, a part of nature. The more easily the society is able at least to allow in advance for bad years, the less pronounced we should expect this feeling of oneness to be- come.25 It seems reasonable to characterize our society as one in which a view of man as the master, actual or potential, of all of nature, goes hand in hand with a general refusal to think in probabilistic terms about natural events. It is not suf- ficient that man's adjustments be re- garded as changing probability distribu- tions of undesirable events; there is a great need to see these actions as elimi- nating hazard entirely. Hence, flood works make the protected area safe; water systems have safe yields; and weather forecasters are urged by the public to say that it either will or will not rain - not that the probability of rain is 4 in 10. The pressures arising from this combination of views seem clearly to favor programs aimed at na- ture directly rather than at man; indeed, programs which provide no incentive for efficient adjustment by private indi- viduals. These same individuals tend to dismiss their own danger by stressing the "safety" of public adjustments and the predictable nature of extreme natural events. When the unpredicted event oc- curs or the event more extreme than the adjustments can handle, it is understand- able that public sympathy for the losers is relatively great and that programs of redistribution in favor of these victims are conceived or expanded. In general, the society's handling of extreme natural events could be sig- nificantly improved by an educational campaign stressing the modification of some key ideas. First, it would be an important contribution to more phases of our lives than only our relation to nature if some way could be found of persuading the average man to think ra- tionally about random events. Purging the naive law of averages will not be easy; our tendency to personify inani- mate objects (and, of course, nature) encourages us to give memories to coins we are tossing as well as to the forces that spawn hurricanes, floods and earth- quakes. If such a purge were to be ac- complished, however, we might find the society more receptive to an accurate de- scription of the relative adequacy of existing and projected adjustments. If, in addition, our ideal of mastery over nature could be realistically modified to allow us to admit that some losses will inevitably occur, we might be able to discuss more carefully the desirable level of those expected losses as against the costs of further adjustments to avoid them. 2 The view that man is under nature would seem to be related not to the relative ability of society to adjust to nature, but to its view of the personal or impersonal quality of that nature. If a society is convinced that there is some anthropomorphic spirit behind natural events ready to react, perhaps whimsically or per- versely, to human adjustments, this would seem to encourage a view of subjection to nature. This view does not, however, so readily fit into our observations.</page></plain_text>
