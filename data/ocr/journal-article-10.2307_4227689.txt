<plain_text><page sequence="1">JeI JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES VoL XAV No. 3 September 2001 On the Origins of Modern Evolutionary Economics: The Veblen Legend after 100 Years Helge Peukert In July 1898, the Quarterly Journal of Economics published an article by Thorstein Bunde Veblen1 which became a classic and the purported foundation document of "old," or rather critical or evolutionary, institutionalism.2 Veblen's writings have pro- voked such intense debates in the last hundred years that he himself has become an institution in economic thought.3 For new institutionalists, his writings represent an old-fashioned type of pre-theoretical reasoning.4 For neoclassical economists his oeuvre is a typical example of ambivalent and sociological prose.5 Positive or negative interpretations, with either a neoclassical,6 a new, or an old institutionalist bias, all have one point in common: they suppose that Veblen developed, or tried to develop, a posi- tive heuristic and a constructive alternative research program. The Veblen Myth The prevailing interpretation of Veblen, both within old institutional economic literature and beyond it, is as follows. In The Theory of the Leisure Class ([1899] 1994), Veblen proposed a positive stage theory of history (peaceful savagery, aggres- sive barbarism, capitalism) and the idea of conspicuous consumption. In The Instinct of Workmanship ([1914] 1990b) one finds an alternative theory of instincts (instinct of workmanship, parental bent, and so on), while in Absentee Ownership ([1923] 1964) there is a description of the changes from the era of free competition to the rise of the corporations. The Engineers and the Price System ([ 1921] 1 990a) is understood to be a description of his positive vision of an economy directed by engineers.7 The author is Privatdozent of Economics, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt/M., Germany. This paper was presented at the workshop "History of Evolutionary Thought in Economics," Max-Planck-Institute for Research into Economic Systems (Jena, Germany), August 26-28, 1999.

K. Galbraith's analysis of the technostructure (1967), and James Duesenberry's consumption hypothesis (1952) are given as examples of work which carried on Veblen's approach or parts of it. In the old institutionalist tradition, members of the Association for Evo- lutionary Economics and the Association for Institutionalist Thought continue to try to develop a research program along Veblenian lines (e.g., Tool 1993). Our understanding of Veblen deviates fundamentally from the common assump- tion that he endeavored to develop a constructive research program in the Lakatosian sense.8 He had only one scientific aim, which he pursued by three different means. This aim was a radical and deconstructive critique of what he called prevailing habits of thought.9 He did not, and did not want to, unfold a positive, new, and evolutionary approach which could practically be applied to the analysis of economic processes. He did not pretend to uncover any developmental logic of economic history or institu- tions. Instead, his destruction of deterministic theories and implicit teleological ten- dencies should be interpreted as his attempts to uncover the implications of the basic freedom of human choice and valuation. Veblen's challenge can be summarized as follows: "This is the paradox never to be resolved: the endemic indetermination ren- ders man free to choose, yet this freedom is invariably deployed in frenzied efforts to foreclose the choice" (Bauman 1995, 143). These foreclosures were Veblen's main concern which he tried to dismantle. This may explain why all attempts to formulate an alternative to mainstream economics in a Veblen-Ayres tradition had to fail (e.g., Clarence Ayres (1944), who combined post-Darwinism with an optimist technocratic position and a putative Veblenian instinct theory). Even the most ardent defenders of a constructive Veblen, like Rick Tilman (1992), had to interpret at least Veblen's late writings as an aberration or as writings with strong satirical intent, and not as a serious contribution for an alternative research program (Tilman 1988). Veblen 's Subversion Veblen formulated his essential critique of everyday and scientific patterns of cognition by three means: (1) he constructed "counterfactual histories," which were diametrically opposed to prevailing economic theories and everyday preconcep- tions;10 (2) his second deconstructive method consisted of dialectical reasoning by reducing habits of thought and theories to absurdity-in themselves and in compari- son with each other (e.g., Darwinism versus pragmatism or the contradictions within specific instinct theories of his time, as in Veblen 1 990b); and (3) Veblen expounded a radical and critical modern epistemological position which will be analyzed in the fol- lowing."1 These three strategies explain the skillful redundancy of some of his writ- ings (especially Veblen [1923] 1964).</page><page sequence="3">On the Origins of Modern Evolutionary Economics 545 It is not surprising that the exasperated secondary literature pointed out that Veblen had "no system" (Dowd 1958, VII), that a consistent statement of the doctrines of Veblen is missing (Anderson 1933, 598), and that no constructive methodology (Coats 1954) or any other methodology can be found in Veblen (Comehls 1969). Fur- ther, it is argued in the critical literature that he did not delineate causal relationships and that his "theory" is non-testable and does not contain any theorems, e.g., on out- put, employment, and money (Walker 1977). Should Veblen therefore be dismissed? I argue that the realization of his program as a disclosure of preconceptions from within is unique in the history of economic thought.'2 Veblen's basic intention to dis- close scientific preconceptions is the dominant characteristic (e.g., from Joseph Dorfman's description of Veblen's life, "All the efforts of his fellow students in and out of class, his definite views could not be determined" [1966, 42]). Even later, when Veblen was lecturer in Chicago and forced to put forward "positive knowledge," oth- ers have noted, "it was still almost impossible to get from him an exact answer on any question ... here was a subtle mind, penetrating to fundamental issues without dis- closing its own views, except the one determination to get to the bottom of things, if possible ... the students received not the slightest inkling of his own belief or convic- tion" (118, 120). When Veblen reached the age of fifty, the perplexity of his intellec- tual environment had still not vanished. "Of Veblen's own opinions on prevailing questions no one was certain. Students suspected that he was an agnostic, if not an atheist, but they were not sure" (1966, 246; all citations are remarks of Veblen's con- temporaries). 13 Veblen's methodological criticism was deeply influenced by Immanuel Kant and Charles S. Peirce. In one of his earliest articles about Kant's "Critique of Judgment" (1884), a first exposition of his epistemological and substantial program can be found. Veblen tried to carry out for the social sciences, and especially economics, what Kant had undertaken for the categories of time and space. Reading Kant in the perspective of Peirce's pragmaticist turn, he wanted to show the time- and space-bounded schemes of perceptions which influenced the political and theoretical economic debates of his time (John Dewey's pragmatism, historicism, Spencer-Darwinism, Marxism, Christendom, early neoclassical economics, and so on). 14 Peirce argued that the function of thought is to produce habits of action. The guiding principles of inquiry are habits of the mind. "Intellectual power is nothing but facility in taking habits and in following them in cases essentially analogous to ... the normal cases of connections of feelings under which those habits were formed" (1958, 152).i The Natural Order Veblen's epistemological skepticism was motivated by his endorsement of the idea that there was a lost or abandoned natural order. In 1915 and 1918 Veblen formu- lated a positive vision of economy and society, which may have to do with his cultural</page><page sequence="4">546 Helge Peukert Norwegian background and with the transformation of agriculture in the United States at the turn of the century. "His guide lines remained always those of a sophisticated, sceptical Norwegian agrarian thrown into contact with the impersonal calculus of the credit economy as it took form in modern corporation finance" (Dorfman 1966, 518). The Baltic Stone Age corresponds to Veblen's conception of a natural order: "A small scale system of tillage and presently of mixed farming ... The scheme of institu- tions, economic, civil, domestic and religious, that would fit these circumstances would be of a relatively slight fixity, flexible, loose-knit, and naive, in the sense that they would be kept in hand under discretionary control of neighborly common sense .... It is a civilisa- tion of workmnanship and fecundity rather than of dynastic power, statecraft, priestcraft or artistic achievement" ([1915] 1966, 17, 43). Veblen affinned that this "civil system might be described as anarchy qualified by the common sense of a deliberative assembly that exercises no coercive control" (46). But Veblen was a realist-he knew that direct democracy and solidarism as a life- style are bound to small-scale communities and neighborhoods. At the turn of the cen- tury, the great trade-off between (individual) liberty and "efficiency" (i.e., the development of mass production and consumption) was apparent. The touchstone of Veblen's moral values is to be found in the peaceful farmer, craftsman, and citizen, the freeholder of the primitive Icelandic community who did not strive to outdo others in aping one's superiors. Veblen's personal "defense mechanism" against the fatal real- ization that there can be no return to the alleged good old days consisted of his relent- less subversion of modem methodologies and economic constructions of meaning, especially those which legitimized the transformation and the resulting new order. Veblen's ideal coincides to a large extent with the agrarian democratic princi- ples of Jefferson, and he made the basic ambivalence of the American people explicit. "Two souls dwell in the bosom ... of the American people. The one loves the abundant Life, as expressed in the cheap and plentiful products of large-scale production ... The other soul yearns for former simplicities, for decentralization, for the interests of the 'little man,' . . . denounces 'monopoly,' and 'economic empires,' and seeks means of breaking them up" (D. Thompson in 1938, cited in Adelstein 1989, 614). Veblen's thinking is an expression of the former beloved simplicities and a confrontation against the American ambivalence toward that which he rejected-an abundant but mechanized economy and political and cul- tural mass society. Why Is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science? Veblen did not unfold a positive research program in economics or sociology. He deciphered preconceptions and habits of thought. His first contribution along these lines of thought was his article on economics and evolutionary concepts (1898). Most proponents and adversaries of Veblen presuppose that his 1898 article was conceived</page><page sequence="5">On the Origins of Modern Evolutionary Economics 547 as a first building block for an evolutionary economic theory.'6 It is usually under- stood as a critique of the unrealistic assumptions of (neo)classical economics. In fact, he criticized rationalist and empirical theories. But his fundamental methodological starting point is that there are millions of observable "brute facts" (395) in the real world; in the Peirce tradition he argued that these facts have to be cognized by frames, models, or theories to explain interrelations. There is no knowledge without the cre- ative combination of facts and frames. "The difference [between theories] is a differ- ence of spiritual attitude or point of view ... or in the interest from which the facts are appreciated" (377). Veblen wanted to demonstrate the epistemological defects of all concepts, which pretend to have "unmediated [i.e., unframed] cognitions" (Peirce 1958). This includes economic rationalism, empiricism, and evolutionary theories, the latter of which became the fashion at the turn of the century. He introduced the question of the title of his article very polemically: "It may be taken as the consensus of those men who are doing the serious work of modem anthro- pology, ethnology, and psychology, as well as of those in the biological sciences proper, that economics is helplessly behind the times, and unable to handle its sub- ject-matter in a way to entitle it to standing as a modem science" (Veblen 1898, 373). He stated explicitly that the critics of orthodox economics had not made the weak points of economic theory really clear (1898, 375). He defended pre-evolutionary eco- nomic theories against their critics. He asserted that these theories do not fail "to offer a theory of a process or of a developmental relation ... It will not even hold true that our elders overlooked the presence of cause and effect in formulating their theories and reducing their data to a body of knowledge." It is mainly a difference in using dif- ferent frames and preconceptions to organize facts in a meaningful structure. "But the terms which were accepted as the definitive terms of knowledge were in some degree different in the early days from what they are now ... [their] constraining normality is of a spiritual kind. It is for the scientific purpose an imputation of... coherence to the facts dealt with" (376-377). Evolutionary concepts, defined in a broad sense, give coherence to facts in a spe- cific and necessarily one-sided way. "All the talk about cytoplasm, centrosomes, and karyokinetic process, means that the inquiry now looks consistently to the life process, and aims to explain it in terms of cumulative causation" (1898, 384). For Veblen, there was no epistemological superiority in evolutionary approaches. His call for a "genetic account of an unfolding process" (388) is consciously dissolved in triviality, e.g., when he states that the analysis should start with "the entire organic complex of habits of thought" (393), which could mean all or nothing. Some commentaries correctly rec- ognized that "Veblen never systematically applied to social or economic phenomena the leading Darwinian concepts of natural selection, survival of the fittest ... and adaptation" (Davis 1945, 135). Instead, Veblen began to develop a secular theory of knowledge (1898, 379ff.) in distinguishing an archaic-animistic-metaphysical and a matter-of-fact, imper- sonal-mechanical stadium of cultural, economic, and cognitive development. For</page><page sequence="6">548 Helge Peukert Veblen, most economic theories like classical economics, Austrian marginalism, the historical school, hedonist conceptions of man, and most equilibrium approaches belong to the first "primitive" phase in which "there is little of impersonal or mechani- cal sequence visible to man in their every-day life" (379). In the first phase of small communities without the application of mechanical techniques, knowledge is "fornu- lated in terms of personality-in terms of habit and propensity and will power" (378). Teleological willpower is also applied to objects of the external world. Veblen called this a contamination of the "instinct" of workmanship, a projection or "imputation of a workmanlike propensity in the observed facts. External objects are believed to do things" (1990b, 52-53). Like people in the first stage, classical economists like Adam Smith-but also the Austrians and the adherents of the historical school-projected an accepted ideal of conduct, a conventionalized nomenclature with a tendency to an equilibrium at the normal: "Laws of the normal or natural, according to a preconcep- tion regarding the ends to which, in the nature of things, all things end" (Veblen 1898, 382). For Veblen, economic laws are habits of thought. In larger societies and with mechanical productive equipment, the end-state and natural order concepts make room for what Veblen understood to be evolutionary pre- conceptions. "The evolutionary point of view ... leaves no place for a formulation of natural laws in terms of definitive normality, whether in economics or in any other branch of inquiry. Neither does it leave room for that other question of normality, What should be the end of the developmental process under discussion?" (1898, 392). Instead of a definitive normality, facts are looked at in terms of ongoing sequences, "a cumulative process of adaptation of means to ends that cumulatively change as the process goes on, both the agent and his environment being at any point the outcome of the past process" (391). Veblen believed that this is not the natural, the best, or the sci- entific way to look at things. But "(u)nder the stress of modern technological exigen- cies, men's every-day habits of thought are falling into the lines that in the sciences constitute the evolutionary method" (397). For Veblen, mankind's cognitive develop- ment is caught between animistic teleological metaphysics and an aimless, cumulative development, driven by the matter-of-fact attitude in the age of the machine process with a high degree of standardization and an interdependent, interlocking multiplicity of mechanical appliances, "under the guidance of highly impersonal, mechanical, morally and aesthetically colorless conceptions of causal sequence" ([1904] 1978, 372). Three Phases of Mind and Society In subsequent articles,17 Veblen extended and clarified his concept. In his last and most clearly written essay he underlined that the modern evolutionary postulate of consecutive change "is an unproven and unprovable postulate-that is to say, it is a metaphysical preconception" (1919a, 33). Idle curiosity is tamed by norms of system-</page><page sequence="7">On the Origins of Modern Evolutionary Economics 549 atic knowledge. "A scientific point of view is a consensus of habits of thought current in the community" (38). In his three articles on preconceptions in economics ([1899] 1919c, [1 899] 1919d, and [1900] 1919e), Veblen discussed Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, the utilitarian philosophy, David Hume, Alfred Marshall, John Elliott Caimes, and especially physiocracy and Smith in detail. He demonstrated the ("animistic") imputation of final causes in physiocracy (e.g., the concept of the pro- ductivity of nature, Quesnay's natural order, and so on). They are also prevalent in Smith, who postulated a different "standard of normality." Smith also stressed cause-effect, matter-of-fact elements but in a pre-evolutionary way because at his time it was not the mechanized machine process but the handicraftsman and his skill and diligence which was the practical mode of production. And with craftsmanship, an easily identifiable 1:1 relationship between cause and effect existed (i.e., the action of a handicraftsman leads to an immediate productive, observable result) ([1899] 1919c, 104).18 For Veblen, the main reference point is epistemological agnosticism. "Before anything can be said as to the orderliness of the sequence, a point of view must be cho- sen by the speculator, with respect to which the sequence in question does or does not fulfill this condition of orderliness; that is to say, with respect to which it is a sequence" ([1900] 1919e, 162). In Veblen ([1906] 1919b, 1-31), a more detailed developmental scheme of knowledge related to his stage theory of social and economic systems is presented. In the peaceable, savage societies and economies of hunters and gatherers the causal relation "between vulgar work and product is vaguely taken for granted and not made the principle for comprehensive generalizations" (10). Instead, "cosmologies are built up, but always in dramatic form" (9). Objects and their life histories are interpreted in an anthropomorphic way as agents with teleological aims. What counts is spiritual consistency and not quantitative equivalence. A body of knowledge is organized "into myths and legends, which need have no pragmatic value for the learner of them [and] no intended bearing on his conduct of practical affairs" (7). In the second phase of higher "barbarism" with settled, predaceous life conditions and a feudalistic hierarchy (e.g., in the Middle Ages), metaphysical-teleological conceptions continue to prevail. But their dramatizations now have the pragmatic function to give meaning to "mastery and servitude, gradations of privilege and honor, coercion and personal dependence" (10). In the third phase in early-modern industry with craftsmen, the law of cause and effect (the law of efficient causes) with an anthropomorphic-personal reference pre- vails. In the fourth phase "the machine process has displaced the workman as the archetype in whose image causation is conceived by the scientific investigators. The dramatic interpretation of natural phenomena has thereby become less anthropomor- phic; it no longer constructs the life-history of a cause working to produce a given effect-after the manner of a skilled workman producing a piece of wrought goods-but it constructs the life-history of a process in which the distinction between cause and effect need scarcely be observed in an itemized and specific way, but in</page><page sequence="8">550 Helge Peukert which the run of causation unfolds itself in an unbroken sequence of cumulative change" (16). This "imputation of brute activity only" ([1906] 1919b, 18) is Veblen's very abstract epistemological characterization of the operative preconception in the machine age. It has been misunderstood as a call for a new "evolutionary economic science," based on some clearly specified, substantive, and superior concepts. Veblen makes absolutely clear that in his view the canons of validity of causal evolutionism are not more "objective" than those of the Pueblo myth makers. All preconceptions of causality are "essentially metaphysical" (15) habits of thought. For Veblen, it is "an insubstantial coincidence that much of the knowledge gained under machine-made canons of research can be turned to practical account" (16). The emergence of the inte- grated machine process establishes the cumulative causative habits of thought. But modem man takes them as objective and real as our ancestors took the old metaphysi- cal frames. Veblen is very critical of the "inhumanly dispassionate sweep of the scien- tific quest . .. the inhumanly ruthless fabric of technological processes" (26).19 The dramatic play in former metaphysics vanished, but our 'jungle-fed spiritual sensibili- ties" (27) remain. To subdue the humanities as a "field alien to the [modem, 'evolu- tionary'] scientific spirit is as curious as it is wasteful" (28). Conclusion Veblen stated that "the normal man, such as his inheritance has made him, has therefore good cause to be restive under its [the machine process and matter-of-fact thinking] dominion" ([1906] 1919b, 31). Thorstein Veblen was not an enthusiastic supporter of the modem "opaque, materialistic interpretation of things" (29), but one of its most ardent critics. There was no correspondence between his natural order and the established order of the machine process. The (scientific) idea of evolutionary cumulative causation underwent an epistemological bewitchment: in metaphysical preconceptions it was the projection of will power to external objects, in the cumula- tive causative preconceptions of today it is the subjugation of agent's and society's teleological plans to the interdependent autonomous machine process. Today's pre- conceptions eliminate all knowledge concepts beyond matter-of-fact knowledge. Instead, only never-ending cumulative processes are under consideration. This could be and has been understood as a positive research program in the Lakatosian sense. But Veblen's point is that such a program excludes considerations concerning ulterior teleological ends and questions of meaning. This is Veblen's main critique, contrary to the great misunderstanding of "old" institutionalists who saw in Veblen the construc- tive precursor of an alternative, positive, and evolutionary research program.20 Instead he came close to so-called postmodern thinkers like Richard Rorty (1979). Veblen shared their critique of scientific foundationalism, the belief in an absolute bedrock of truth in the Cartesian-Lockean-Kantian tradition. Veblen com-</page><page sequence="9">On the Origins of Modern Evolutionary Economics 551 bined his deconstructivism with an attitude of irony and pastiche, and sometimes mel- ancholy, cynicism, and despair. For Rorty and Jean-Frangois Lyotard modernity was characterized by the tendencies of commodification, mechanization, and technology (which-according to Veblen-led to the concept of cumulative causation). Postmodernity means the end of the secure positivities, grand referents, and finalities (like Smith's concept of a civil and commercial society), an incredulity toward meta-narratives, and a hermeneutics of suspicion with reference to the matter-of-fact problem of meaninglessness. There is no truth beyond alternative and often opposing frames (scientific or oth- erwise), and the mirror of nature is only accessible for us by the hermeneutics of lan- guage and the insuperable belonging to idiosyncratic language communities. Veblen formulated a postmodern epistemology at the turn of the century when the machine process and methodological foundationalism in economics were ascending. He deconstructed the concept of objective knowledge in his methodological articles and their underlying assumptions and principles. He focused on four cognitive human meta-narratives and their limits and one-sidedness. Further, he highlighted the misun- derstanding within these meta-narratives in their attempts to simply convey nature, the truth, the world out there and its interrelations. He was much ahead of his time, so mis- understandings of his epistemological achievements and their necessary limitations21 have been unavoidable. Notes 1.

Examples: (a) For the theorist of the leisure class ([1899] 1994, ch. 2), private property evolved from "theft of women," and its purpose is to enable barbarians to pursue leisure activities; this counterfactual is opposed to, e.g., Smith's ([1776] 1976) or D. C. North's (1996) concept of the emergence and function of private property. (b) His theory of Absen- tee Ownership ([1923] 1964) and of the fimctioning of financial markets, in which Veblen proposed that shareholders destabilize financial markets (1978, chs. V and VI) and control the management, which has to perform shortsighted "sabotage" ([1921] 1990a) in the absentee owner's interest (e.g., downsizing); this is a counterfactual to the mainstream</page><page sequence="10">552 Helge Peukert functional theory of finance (matching function of savings and investments). For a Veblenian line of reasoning see Henwood 1995. 11. The validity of his first two methods is demonstrated in Peukert 1998, ch. 6. 12. Neither the essential differences to the rhetoric approaches "from outside," e.g., McCloskey 1985 and White 1974, nor the articles of Alan Dyer (1997) and Warren Samuels (1 990)-which come closest to our interpretation-can be discussed here due to the need to limit the scope and length of this paper. 13. Further evidence of this attitude and behavior is given in Dorfman 1966, 31-32, 56, 235, 247-251, 253, 273-275, 305, 315, 317-318, 423-425,451-453,486, and 499-500. 14. Veblen attended Peirce's lecture on the "The logic of Science" at Johns Hopkins University; his decision to specialize in Kant was also a decision against the prevailing hedonist and Spencer-Darwinian tendencies. Jennings and Waller "show that the role of biology in Veblen's social theories was quite specific and restricted, despite the prominence of biolog- ical terminology in his writings" (1998, 189). 15. Peirce's complicated philosophical position cannot be dealt with here; see, e.g., Apel 1995. 16. Nelson 1995, 85; Witt 1996, 708; Saviotti 1996, 39; Hodgson 1993, 125, 134-135. 17.

Neither his intricate analyses of these early economic concepts nor his critical discussion of Karl Marx, Gustav Schmoller, and the marginal utility school can be traced in detail here. It should only be mentioned that Veblen never tried to show that they were "wrong" or that their theories did not coincide with the "real world": he tried to highlight their preconceptions. 19. In the substantial deconstructivist part of his approach he argued against modem days and Smith's assertion that an increase in goods increases welfare and happiness. For Veblen, the envy-status function of today's essentially positional consumption is an irrational zero-sum game (see also the Veblenesque arguments in Frank 1987). "However widely, or equally, or 'fairly,' it [wealth] may be distributed, no general increase of the community's wealth can make any approach to satiating this need, the ground of which is the desire of every one to excel every one else in the accumulation of goods" ([1899] 1994, 32). 20. A referee argues that Veblen's position could also be interpreted as simply contradictory and that he never resolved an advocacy of a postmodem epistemology versus a positive, constructive theoretical endeavor-an ambivalence which he never fully resolved. In my view, Veblen was very consistent in his writings. Let me give another example of his deconstructive theorizing. In his reflections on price theory, he distinguished the normal price-, the bandwagon-, the snob-, and the Veblen-effect proper (increase in demand as a reaction to an increase in price). Every price change can therefore initiate four effects. Which of these effects will be positive or negative depends on the relative strength of the Veblen- in relation to the price-effect. Both depend on the direction of the price change: an increase in price leads to negative price- and bandwagon-effects and positive Veblen- and snob-effects if the price effect is stronger than the Veblen-effect. If the Veblen-effect is stronger than the price-effect, then in the case of a rise in price, the bandwagon-effect would be positive and the snob-effect negative (Leibenstein 1950; for the empirical relevance of the bandwagon-effect see Kuran 1995). With this sophisticated deconstructivism of the neoclassical price theory of his time he challenged Marshall's law of demand, the logi- cal-methodological starting point of neoclassical economics with the utility maximizing individual, the assumptions of (strictly) convex, and intrinsic preferences, the non-interde- pendence of utilities, and so on. In our view, Veblen's sophisticated deconstructive message gets lost in Bagwell and Bemheim 1996. 21. The main weak point in Veblen (not only in the methodological contributions discussed here) is that he analyzed all scientific utterances (e.g., the quantity theory of money, or the loanable funds approach in Smith) exclusively as pre-analytical concepts (in Peirce's termi- nology: abductions) or as myth-equivalents. He thereby avoided a closer economic discus-</page><page sequence="11">On the Origins of Modern Evolutionary Economics 553 sion of the theorems dealt with. But this is (according to Veblen's epistemology) the unavoidable excluding aspect of his deconstructive intention, because a postmodern episte- mology and a positive research program may be both essential for critical institutionalist analysis but cannot be done at the same time and Veblen was well aware of this.
