<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eternity and Modernity Bakhtin and the Epistemologica! Sublime Graham Pechey There is neither a first nor a last word and there are no limits to the dialogic context (it extends into the boundless past and the boundless future). Even past meanings, that is, those born in the dialogue of past centuries, can never be stable (finalized, ended once and for all) - they will always change (be renewed) in the process of subsequent, future development of the dialogue. At any moment in the development of the dialogue there are immense, boundless masses of forgotten contextual meanings, but at certain moments of the dialogue's subsequent de- velopment along the way they are recalled and invigorated in renewed form (in a new context). Nothing is absolutely dead: every meaning will have its homecoming festival. The problem of great time. 1 The last thoughts written down by Mikhail Bakhtin before his death turn not on the meaning of life but rather on the life of meaning. The gesture is characteristic: the 'meaning of life' could not be other than a monological 'transcription' and generalization of that forcefield of the singular and situated which (for him) is life as it is lived and endlessly becomes. The whole internally open-ended work of his life is brought to an external end with the words 'great time', by which he signifies the immortality of all meanings, the endless circulation and return of semantic energies, the interaction of live contexts in infinite dialogue across hundreds and even thousands of years. 'Great time' is a concept that should speak quite directly to us as we move towards the end of our catastrophic century in a world where supposedly forgotten themes and narratives are being revived or newly inflected, not just by single writers in theory but by whole collectivities in practice. I 'Every meaning will have its homecoming festival', Bakhtin writes, using a trope which is deliberately archaic and anthropomorphic, not only propelling the idea of an ancient ceremony of welcome into the (open) future but also flaunting its form as a little personification allegory. To see anthropomorphism as a disease of thought is to close oneself to the challenge of a kind of thinking that 'hear[s] voices' Theoria, October 1993, pp. 61-85</page><page sequence="2">62 Theoria (Bakhtin 1986:169) everywhere and discerns the lineaments of a potential hero in even the most depersonalized and detemporalized discourse. The story of meaning is, like much of Bakhtin' s own story, a tale of exile which is often the richer in outcome for the length of its duration. Time in properly human terms is nothing other than the dimension in which meaning opens out. Just as the word in Bakhtin is defined as that which strives always to be heard, which posits implicitly a forever absent ideal or optimal listener, so meanings tendentially seek out the means of their return. A meaning is at home wherever it comes up against a context that will re-open the context(s) it has preserved through time, in a Gadamerian 'fusion of horizons'.2 By explicitly casting meaning itself in the role of hero, by bringing to life what is otherwise suspended or suppressed, Bakhtin exemplifies in a sort of instant discursive miniature the very realization of potential that he is describing and celebrating. There had been other candidates for immortality earlier in Bakhtin's work: in the Dostoevsky book it is personality ; in the Rabelais book it is the people : immortalities respectively of the spirit and the flesh. The immortality contemplated by the dying Bakhtin is more encompassing, more of the ground of our humanity, than either of these. It is not incompatible with a strong emphasis upon historicity, though it is at odds with any tendency towards a radical relativism. As an eternity of potential, it has nothing in common with that eternity of closure by means of which Bakhtin apophatically thinks the sense of 'historical time' that is for him the great defining discovery of modernity. In this 'naïve' eternity of epic the first words and deeds are also the last words and deeds, and the past is the highest value. This 'absolute past'3 is precisely extra-temporal in so far as those in it cannot imagine that their epoch was ever someone else's future or that it will ever be someone else's past. In their primal temporal introversion they show no foresight that the likes of us will ever follow them further down the line of time. Bakhtin imagines the eternity of mediaeval Christianity as similarly closed, as a vertical axis of everlasting synchrony from which the horizontal of history at length detaches itself. The exemplary site of this move (for him as for Erich Auerbach)4 is The Divine Comedy , while the eighteenth-century move that decisively launches history as a category of thought bears the proper name of Goethe. Now these classical and feudal orders of extra-temporality serve Bakhtin mainly in the middle of his career as antitypes of the novel's self-conscious chron(otop)icity. Great time must not, I think, be seen as flatly contradicting his valorization of the novel's orientation towards the present of 'unresolved contemporaneity'5 - its sensiti- vity to languages of 'the day'6 - or as marking a turn to 'poetry' with</page><page sequence="3">Eternity, Modernity and Bakhtin 63 its stately, epochal temporality. This eternity of semantic potential should instead be seen as fashioning for the novel a friendly dialogizing other rather than a purely heuristic opposite, thereby averting the dangers of a fall into 'small time' that might ensue for any hermeneutic that makes a dogma out of the socio-historical relativity and novelty of cultural meanings. It's one thing to use the novel as a battering ram to bring down the bastions of poetics, or indeed to use the still more extreme idiom of carnival against all law or authority whatever; it's quite another thing to build a new hermeneutic on that highly polemical base. With great time Bakhtin seeks to reduce the threat of a radical forgetting posed by both of these powerfully deconstructive categories. His early concept of 'outsideness' in 'aesthetic activity'7 is now refunctioned in the direction of diachrony and of the reception (rather than production) of cultural texts. The problem with carnival is that it is one of those hyperbolic concepts that can always go over into their opposites. Starting as a will to freedom, this paradoxical rule of non-identity contains the threat of becoming a finalized unfinalizability, a category without an outside, enshrining 'jolly relativity' as a metaphysical absolute. As an eternal corrective to this possibility, Bakhtin revives and rethinks for other purposes what I will call his positional absolute. This category is the wild card among categories in that it requires that we think of uniqueness as multiple, of a non-commutable situatedness as infi- nitely repeated across the whole of (human: the qualifier is redundant) reality. No one situatedness can be known except from the standpoint of another such situatedness. Applied to history, it means that we neither reduce a work of the past to its conditions nor read it as if it were a product of our time, but always read its uniqueness from our own; that we avoid the abstract objectivity achieved by forever putting ourselves out of the picture and instead think of the work as precisely needing us for the realization of its semantic potential. Besides the (mutually dialogizing) chronotopes within the work, and as the condition of their having their effect, there is this chronotope of the reader 'outside' the work. Reading is the meeting of these chronotopes, by means of which the work is freed from the 'captivity'8 of time. This redemptive hermeneutic of Utopian surplus offered by Bakhtin in his last writings is no different in kind from the aesthetic activity conceptualized in his earliest writings. Works and/or their (internal) authors are now themselves the heroes; readers are the authors that these text-characters everywhere posit and search out. Thanks to this readerly authoring, the 'text' becomes the 'work', internalizing - activating within itself - the unforeseen and unforeseeable con- texts) in which it finds itself. Or rather: the 'text' is an analytic</page><page sequence="4">64 Theoria abstraction from the work, which is always the text-and/in-a-context, the context-and/in-a text. The hermeneutic of the late Bakhtin is this 'consummating' activity made reflexive, taken as it were to the second power. Qualifying the strong mid-career emphasis upon histor(icit)y is the perspective of a newly-reaffirmed philosophical anthropology, a deeply committed phenomenology of the ways we live our humanness at once in and beyond history. Before we live in those purely conceptual objectivities called 'society' or 'history' we live absolutely in meaning; the infinity and eternity of meaning is both the outcome and the making-good of our own finitude. Meaning is always everywhere because we as individuals can never be, because we end both spatially and temporally where and when our bodies end. II It should be clear by now that the turn taken by the late Bakhtin is from the grotesque-in-history to the sublime-in-theory, and from an avant-gardist agency rooted in the people to one that now devolves upon the practitioner of hermeneutics within the 'human sciences' . In his last essays and notebooks Bakhtin revives the Diltheyan distinc- tion between Verstehen and Erklären in the new situation presented by the mid-twentieth century, when the 'sciences of the spirit' were adopting or had widely adopted the paradigm of language and were no longer in the thrall of the methodology of the natural sciences. The peril faced by these disciplines making up the dominant or emergent field of structuralism in the period after the Second World War was not the lapse into causal explanation: they were founded precisely upon a programmatic rejection of any concern with genesis, any genetic approach to cultural texts. The systemic options of which texts were made up were internal determinants; its realized virtualities were its composite 'inner' or immanent cause. Bakhtin must at this moment have felt alienated by both official and academic discourses on culture in the Soviet Union: on the one hand, there was 'Marxist' ideology- critique enshrining a species of vulgar causal explanation rooted in 'class' - in the empirical author's given or chosen place in the social division of labour - and backed always by the violence of repression; on the other, there was the structuralism of the Tartu school which, like its Western counterpart (though less polemically), abolished any causality other than structural causality. The scientificity of both discourses about culture would have amounted for Bakhtin to little more than rival scientistic ideologies, theoretical monologisms of the</page><page sequence="5">Eternity, Modernity and Bakhtin 65 same order. The 'linguistic turn' of twentieth-century thought might have promised the instalment of a more appropriate paradigm for the human sciences, if the conception of language invoked by these disciplines had been different. Dilthey' s work had been done before that 'turn' took place - before language became the model of all social objectivation and interaction.9 Bakhtin is writing at a time when that paradigm-shift had been only too successful, in the age of the growing hegemony of what he calls 'the potential single language of languages' (Bakhtin 1986:107). The successful 'revolt against positi- vism'10 in the name of those strong claims made for the language- paradigm by so many disparate currents of contemporary thought had resulted in the triumph of yet another objectivism. That paradigm stood in need of correction. The ontological- hermeneutic turn of the late Bakhtin is also in some sense a turn towards the dimension (and problem) of time. Why did this happen? Well, the metaphors of both structuralism and of his own popular- carnivalesque deconstruction are predominantly spatial metaphors; space, it would seem, is the privileged dimension of any body of thinking which (like structuralism, notoriously) foregrounds synch- rony at the cost of diachrony. In the last writings it is omnitemporality and 'depth of meaning' - he is very careful to say 'not height or breadth' (Bakhtin 1986:127) - that preoccupies Bakhtin before all else. And so the Bakhtinian Dasein enters the last of its incarnations as 'great time', the plane in which all meaning lives and grows. To be is to understand: understanding is the activity called forth both by texts proper and by those potential texts-to-be called human acts. Texts are events and not those quasi-spatial entities: 'systems' or 'structures'. The text is at once that which is nothing if not understood and yet also that which can never be 'completely translated', in the sense of being subordinated to a 'common logic' (Bakhtin 1986:106). Complete translation would effect a logical reduction of the text, its derealiza- tion as a text-event, the resolution of all of its elements into a potential metalanguage and their rerealization in another text. Structuralism is the paranoiac ideal of 'complete' translation inasmuch as it takes the text as far as possible towards the extreme pole of language-as-sign- system - the highest hierarchical level of removal from its radical 'eventness' or historicity. Both 'poles', according to Bakhtin, are 'unconditional': there is the logical absolute of the ultimate meta- language, and there is the ontological absolute of the 'unique and unrepeatable text' (Bakhtin 1986:107). All knowledge begins with such singularities; what is distinctive about hermeneutic understand- ing is simply that it strives to theorize such singularity and thus to remain within and faithful to that realm of the unique for which 'the text' is so potent a figure. All understanding - even Erklären if only it</page><page sequence="6">66 Theoria knew itself - is dialogical 'to some degree' (Bakhtin 1986:111). Even the comprehension of a foreign language that proceeds by rote-learning of its rules partakes of the dialogical: between it and the comprehension of a text in a known language there is no absolute boundary. Bakhtin is always at pains to stress the epistemological and methodological 'impurity' of both the human and the natural sciences: the former mix hermeneutics with a certain (of course subordinate) use of causal explanation; while the latter deceive themselves twice over - firstly, if they believe they do not begin with singular phenomena, and secondly, if they fail to see that their own moves are as much rhetorical as logical. Causal explanation is after all itself a genre of utterance; rhetorically and dialogically speaking it is equivalent to a 'refutation' (Bakhtin 1986:123); internally and in terms of content monological, it is none the less externally and formally caught up in the dialogue that constitutes its disciplinary field. One way of summing all this up is to say that 'the text' rather than 'language' is Bakhtin' s paradigm; that we cannot understand deeds except as (possible) texts; that the deed and the text are figures for each other - the potential verbal elaboration of the first being only the other side of the potentially performative, active character of the second. Bakhtin associates this latter characteristic with premodern speech and writing, above all with 'ancient inscriptions' (Bakhtin 1986:115). Hermeneutic understanding is for him not so much a response to the 'misunderstanding' that comes about as the print culture of modernity dissolves the face-to-face speaking and teaching of the past; it is rather a late-modern means of bringing to consciousness the effects of that 'entire about-face in the history of the word when it becomes expression and pure (actionless) information' (Bakhtin 1986:115). Hermeneutics conducts a rearguard action against the modern reification of meaning in the methodological discourses of the humanities. It is this collusion of causal-explanatory methodologies with the neutralized word that is the antagonist in these last essays - not the traditional genres or 'feudal ideology', as had been the case in his earlier work. The antagonism is in any case deeply modified by an insistence on the necessary hybridity of all methodo- logies; so perhaps we should say that the work of this phase abolishes the role of the polemical adversary to which so much of the force of the early and middle writing is to be attributed. We are not surprised then to find that dialogism is now carefully dissociated from those antagonistic modes - such as parody and polemic - with which it had before been all but identified. In place of the almost routine emphasis upon contradiction we have the notion of a deep consensus no less dialogical than its opposite; indeed the</page><page sequence="7">Eternity , Modernity and Bakhtin 67 infinite shadings of 'agreement' are lauded as the least 'crude' and 'externally most obvious' (Bakhtin 1986:121) of dialogical pheno- mena. Submission to authority conceived as dialogical concurrence with the 'authoritative word' takes the place of - without of course contradicting or invalidating - those earlier denunciations of an authoritarian monologism. Bakhtin at his most Gadamerian speaks of 'the mandatory nature of deep meaning' (Bakhtin 1986:121). Like Paul Ricoeur, he seems to be suggesting that a conflictual intersubjec- tivity, exploitable for its possibilities of freedom or critique, emerges only against the ground of a profoundly consensual intersubjectivity experienced as fate. With the categories of the novel and carnival what was foregrounded was wilful non-communication, the deliberate misunderstanding of orthodoxy, authority, spirituality, tradition. Dialogism now becomes the key category of a communicative rationality that does not so much oppose the instrumental reason of our time as benevolently assert its own more fundamental and prior (in the Kantian sense, transcendental) status. Not only the carniva- lesque force of undermining and forgetting, not only laughter and parody, but also the positive work of understanding finds its place in what Hans-Georg Gadamer would call 'the dialogue [Gespräch] "we are'".11 Where before the almost exclusive emphasis in Bakhtin was on the present of 'unresolved contemporaneity' militantly pitted against an oppressive past, we now find him invoking the nexus of past and future as the real ground of a present threatened with the reification that ensues when heuristic methodological moves are allowed to develop ontological pretensions - in short, when 'method' comes to believe that it is 'truth'. When Bakhtin writes of the 'layering of meaning upon meaning, voice upon voice' or of 'departure beyond the limits of the understood' (Bakhtin 1986:121), he seems in these sublime evoca- tions of the bottomless depth of the word to be seeking not (to be sure) some metaphysical ground but nonetheless some profound and underlying dialogical rationality in which both the living and the long-dead and the yet-to-be-born all take part. Beyond the exceptional moment of carnival or the programmatic novelty of the novel there is this substratum of our Dasein as beings whose being it is to understand. The Bakhtin who had sought to intervene in the crisis of late European modernity by projecting the avant-garde back into the past - reminding the modern project of its repressed insurgency - now intervenes precisely by refusing to isolate exemplary moments or instances from the historical record. Without quite deserting that project, he no longer sees it as centrally involving the critical overcoming of tradition; instead we are offered a distinctively postmodern perspective in which tradition conceived as the infinite</page><page sequence="8">68 Theoria chain of voices past and to come (that long temporal distance which Bakhtin regularly correlates with depth of meaning) is the only basis not simply of our freedom but of all value as such, and without which even critique itself would be meaningless. Our freedom lies in grasping our conditions of possibility rather than in any story of perfection or revolution in this world. Bakhtin decisively joins those other philosophers of our century who have broken with the nineteenth-century post-Kantian philosophy of history by (re)instating a philosophical anthropology. 'The Problem of the Text' ends (more or less) with Bakhtin' s new concept of the 'third' , or 'superaddressee' . Just as 'those whose voices are heard in the word before the author comes upon it . . . have their rights' (Bakhtin 1986:121), so we always posit in our speaking and writing this 'third' by whom we will be heard and absolutely understood. This Habermasian 'ideal speech situation' is not con- ceived in Bakhtin as realized or realizable sometime or somewhere, but rather as always implied in every speech situation whatever and wherever: an 'as if of every interaction, every bit as ineluctable as it is indispensable. Bakhtin is now more concerned to stress this transcen- dental instance of 'absolutely just and responsive understanding' than to stress the empirical failures of communication. Our being consists not in our presence on hand but in our ability to recollect and anticipate acts of understanding - to hear and be heard in our turn. The working of the superaddressee can perhaps best be illustrated by Bakhtin' s remarks on two special speech situations: the 'dialogue of the dead' and the 'dialogue of the deaf. These are (respectively) the dialogue of those who are not present to each other in life but nonetheless come to hear each other in the afterlife; and the dialogue of those who cannot hear each other at all though they are present to each other and both alive. The first of these - 'the imagined situation of a meeting in the hereafter' (Bakhtin 1986:124-125) - almost or actually dispenses with the 'third'; in the second, the 'third' is the condition of even the most elementary understanding taking place. All non-pathological exchanges in this world lie somewhere between these two extremes, presupposing as they do a third party 'in some metaphysical distance or distant historical time' (Bakhtin 1986:126) who will absolutely understand the 'whole self of the author. 'The author', Bakhtin holds, 'can never turn over his whole self and his speech work to the complete and final will of those who are on hand or nearby' (Bakhtin 1986:126). If Bakhtin does not wholly play down the near and the contemporary in these essays, he nonetheless redresses an inadequate emphasis upon distance and depth, and upon the hearing no less than the speaking subject - more especially the subject who hears the echoes of voices coming, temporally and</page><page sequence="9">Eternity , Modernity and Bakhtin 69 culturally speaking, from afar. Speakers, it is now acknowledged, are also listeners (always already listeners); and we are reminded of Jean-François Lyotard on the theme of justice when Bakhtin writes of the 'rights' of all voices to be heard and identified as equal to the 'rights' of the speaker.12 Before we speak, we listen, and after speaking we listen again, and so on endlessly. Ill Those who might think that the postmodern Bakhtin offered here forsakes the modern project altogether need look no further than the opening pages of the 'Notes made in 1971' to be disabused; for there we find a ringing celebration of irony as a feature of all European languages since the onset of modernity. Nevertheless there are two points on which this Bakhtin differs from the outright modernist of the middle period. In the Rabelais book irony is a form of sadly 'reduced' or 'muted' laughter; here we notice that what had been a phenomenon of the decline of the carnivalesque in European history now becomes a great historical gain in itself, and more than that: an aspect not only of certain genres and styles but of whole languages and the cultures they carry in suspension. This quintessentially modern discourse of irony - the 'equivocal language of modern times' - is everywhere we read or listen; our modern speech without fixed occasions is also a speech that is always 'with reservations' (Bakhtin 1986:132). Even liberated carnival speech had its specific occasions; the modern language of irony is not denounced for its faint echo of the belly laugh but rather celebrated for its ubiquity, its everydayness, its universal opening-up of our freedom. We breathe a linguistic atmosphere that has already been freed for us; we are at home in a language of emancipation. Bakhtin clearly subscribes to a view of language which sees it as subject not just to neutral or arbitrary change but as being in some sense tendentially 'progressive', fraught with implicit value and pre-understanding. Neutral only in so far as they are systems of signs, the European languages have 'precipitated' within their very 'syntac- tic and lexico-semantic structure[s]' (Bakhtin 1986:133) a story of freedom from authority. Irony has historically helped to rid us of the authoritarian word - not to be confused with the authoritative word, which carries authority only in so far as it is 'internally persuasive' (to use a phrase from 'Discourse in the Novel'). Bakhtin effectively deconstructs the modern opposition between reason and authority, at once internalizing and moving beyond the Romantic critique of the Enlightenment, along with Gadamer and other twentieth-century</page><page sequence="10">70 Theoria hermeneutic thinkers. The second point to be made about this case for the emancipatory force of ironic discourse is that to have broken with this modernist narrative of linguistic freedom - to have 'overcome' it critically or dialectically - would only be to rehearse a typically modernist reflex. The argument for a late postmodern Bakhtin is precisely strengthened by the evidence he here gives of the will to include the phases both of his own earlier thought and of earlier European history. Juxtaposing them in this way gives a certain dialogical character to the very form of his meditations - refuses the language of sublation, transformation, supersession. Irony and the authoritative word coexist as peacefully in the postmodern condition as in Bakhtin' s reflections upon them. It is then not surprising that these reflections are followed straight away by a brief consideration of silence . Raising language to ontological status as Bakhtin does here, seems almost inescapably to entail imaging its absence. As creatures whose being is language, it behoves us to think through the meaning of the empirical absence of speech. If my transcendental and situational at-homeness in language is not incompatible with the contingent stopping of speech, that is because silence is not simply the lack or failure of speech but is rather what can positively begin when speaking stops. Silence is not the negation of language but its greatest and most wholly human potential: my being (in a Heideggerian phrase) is a being-towards- silence. Silence makes us aware that what founds our humanity is not a ground: it is the ever-shifting boundary between speech and its cessation. Our at-homeness in language is not to be conceived empirically. In contrasting (what the translator renders as) 'quietude' and silence Bakhtin invokes and adapts the Diltheyan opposition between Erklären and Verstehen . Quietude can be (causally) exp- lained; silence, being not a condition but an experience, can only be (hermeneutically) understood. In the case of quietude there is nothing that can be heard by anybody who might be listening; we have a mere physical absence of sound in which no listener need be presupposed. In the case of silence I do not hear the voice of another. The listening subject must needs be reckoned into the equation. The elaborating sub-text of quietude is a sentence in the passive voice; the sub-text of silence is a sentence in the active voice. In these thoughts on silence Bakhtin reinflects Diltheyan terms in the context not of consciousness (which is where Dilthey himself was) but of the paradigm of language. The intersubjectivity in which our being consists is language conceived as a chain of speech whose constitutive outside is silence. Language and silence are not so much opposites as forms of - potentials within - each other. Or again: language when it passes into silence is only turned inside-out and as such retains its human shape</page><page sequence="11">Eternity , Modernity and Bakhtin 71 and constitution. The 'logosphere' which is our home is the endless and forever open-ended alternation and interpénétration of silence and 'intelligible sound' (Bakhtin 1986:134). What does Bakhtin mean by describing irony as a 'form of silence' (Bakhtin 1986:134)? I can only think he means that a culture of the serious and single tone fixes subjects in positions, cannot imagine an other than itself, must always be proclaiming itself. Irony is a mode of speaking-by-implication whose extreme instance and perhaps most powerful manifestation is saying everything by saying nothing in the empirical sense of speaking audibly for another to hear: in short, speech with such radical 'reservations' that it reserves its right not to manifest itself at all. Silence is then the ultimate 'loophole'; speech with reservations so absolute that it reserves itself altogether; the ultimate measure of one who wants to ensure that the last word is never spoken. Bakhtin is suggesting that there may be situations in which to refuse a culture of the last word I must refrain from speaking at all and all articulation must be renounced. Silence is, after all, all implication: it is nothing more or less than the absolute rule of implication, and therefore demands that acutest variety of hearing (listening for intelligibility) called understanding. Just because it doesn't activate physiological hearing it brings the deep-semantic or spiritual hearing of understanding into full working and self- awareness. Irony is a form of silence because silence is the transcendental irony of language itself, the world of pure implication that is in constant constitutive tension with its own dense intersubjec- tivity. Nowhere is Bakhtin's refusal of the metanarratives of any (Hegelian or Marxist) philosophy of history clearer - nowhere is his alternative of philosophical anthropology better spelt out - than in his story of 'the witness and the judge' (Bakhtin 1986:137). This character (they are not two but one) is not in any sense modern like 'the writer' but hails from the very dawn of consciousness itself. With the appearance anywhere upon the global scene of the witness and the judge, the whole event of Being changes utterly. This is emphatically not the story of being as a higher subject coming to consciousness in Man: like Jürgen Habermas, Bakhtin rejects that solution to moderni- ty's problem of self-grounding which gives primacy to the 'higher' subjectivity of Absolute Spirit, the solitary subject-object of both Nature and History.13 The whole of Being alters with its very first and most narrowly local acknowledgement, inasmuch as everything else then becomes the unacknowledged. Being is not presence or presence-to-itself; it is that which is forever passing over the border from the uncognized to the cognized. The 'supra-existence' or being-to-the-second-power that is consciousness makes an absolutely</page><page sequence="12">72 Theoria new event of being. The tacit polemic with Marxism comes out most evidently in Bakhtin's claim that the 'absolute freedom' of the 'supra-I' is its 'creativity' and that this contrasts with our merely 'relative freedom' to change existence materially (Bakhtin 1986: 137). Its creative knowing is not and can never be a 'material force' - and not because it is weak but because it has the real (the truly human) power of changing the whole sense of things. Which is to say: the most radical revolution of all is semantic, and it has always already happened. The other side of the misunderstanding of the work of meaning in our constitution is the modern fetishization of material force, the false worship of our very much less than absolute freedom to change existence in itself. For Bakhtin as for Habermas, both historical materialism and Hegelian idealism solve modernity's problem of self-grounding only too well. Bakhtin returns in the notes of 1971 to the issue of epistemologica! 'impurity', and - in a move that is of a piece with the general leavening of antagonism by consensus in these late writings - insists that reified 'relations among objects' and personified 'relations among subjects' form a continuum of mutual transformation rather than a sharp polarity. We are better able to understand and exercise our 'real freedom' if we realize the 'transitions and combinations' of these relations and actually practise or encounter 'death-dealing analysis' (Bakhtin 1986:138-139). In other words, the methodolo- gical hybridity of our thinking has a positive and even emancipatory ethico-political charge within the conditions of our late modernity. The Geisteswissenschaften constitute an area in which it is 'hardly possible to think about necessity'; but the self-consciousness of this realm of freedom - of ' possibilities and the realization of one of them' (Bakhtin 1986:139) - only comes about thanks to a constant thinking and making of the difference between this realm and that other (nomothetic) world of causal determination and necessity. The late-modern sciences of the spirit can only become the active custodians of our freedom if they free themselves from the Eurocen- tric 'miniature world' of the nineteenth century and boldly claim for themselves that whole world of texts (and potential texts, or acts) which is 'as boundless as the universe' and 'as bottomless as the depths of matter' (Bakhtin 1986:140). The epistemological sublime that has been usurped by the sciences of matter and nature must be (reclaimed by the knowledge that takes as its field the infinite depths of meaning. Bakhtin would seem to be calling for the humanities to modernize themselves, though not in the direction of letting the natural sciences impose their model of objectivity. The humanities must catch up with the latter, achieve an equality with them not by resorting to similiar methods but by keeping the difference from each</page><page sequence="13">Eternity, Modernity and Bakhtin 73 other forever in view, and by claiming for their own special (semantic) dimension the depth and scope of the phy sical world opened up by the natural sciences. Now this is a paradoxical modernization inasmuch as it commits Bakhtin to a deeper and deeper archaization of thought, a further and further reaching-back to the premodern, a listening to and for the oldest voices, and a reconstruction of the universal conditions of the possibility of our understanding and being-in-the- world. Modernity having brought in its train the mixed legacy of irony and reification, it is no answer simply to revalorize myth over reason: cultures of myth are legitimately and happily closed, deaf to what is outside their bounds; for modern cultures to try to re-invent myth is (as Lyotard has argued) to produce the monster of a monopolistic narrative with global pretensions, a particularism that becomes terroristic because it thinks universally.14 Fascism is of course the major empirical instance of this sociopolitical teratology. The problem for radical critics of modernity like Bakhtin is then to redescribe the personalistic universe of myth so that it poses no such threat and its naivety does not become the basis for an oppressive totalization. In a move that recalls Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in Dialectic of Enlightenment, the myth of reason is to be dissolved by unfolding the reason of myth. The interest of emancipa- tion is to be served by bringing communicative and instrumental orders of rationality into dialogue with each other. For this to happen the human sciences must somewhat distance themselves from the avant-gardist ethos that proclaims the shock of the new; instead it is their task to confront a self-satisfied modernity with the revelation of the old and the not-yet-born, the past in the yet-to-be and the yet-to-be in the past. The hermeneutics that Bakhtin proposes as the appropriate methodology of the human sciences is assured of being a critical hermeneutics in so far as its deep-semantic knowledge of time is in constant dialogue with the other knowledges of our epoch: that is to say, in so far as it is the complex and inwardly distantiated self-consciousness of a heterogeneous spectrum of (non-violently) coexisting rationalities. 'To understand a given text as the author himself understood it. But our understanding can and should be better' (Bakhtin 1986:141). Bakhtin in these words appears to be half-quoting the best-known dictum of Friedrich Schleiermacher, the founder of modern hermen- eutics. But then we find him immediately rethinking this maxim in a way that signals his break with this Romantic paradigm and with the whole method that sought to understand understanding as the marriage of empathy and paraphrase, 'divination' and 'translation'. Re-activating his early work on self-other relations, he reconceives understanding (along lines uncannily close to those of Gadamer and</page><page sequence="14">74 Theoria Ricoeur) not as the 'loss' of one's unique position in absolute identification with the other but precisely as the full use of one's 'outsideness', one's spatial and/or temporal and/or cultural exotopy with regard to the other (text). Distance is not to be overcome but rather to be maximally put to use, as the very condition of 'creative understanding'. Understanding is 'co-creation', the multiplication of meaning thanks to outsideness, which - and again we are reminded particularly of Ricoeur - transforms the one who understands. Understanding is quite literally a 'meeting' that places an obligation upon the understanding subject, and the 'highest moment' of such deeply committing understanding is the meeting with 'a great human being' (Bakhtin 1986:142). In understanding recognition and dis- covery, apprehension of the known and apprehension of the new are inseparably united. The human sciences will work our salvation by bringing to consciousness the 'primary fact[s]' of consciousness itself in a study of the everyday miracle of understanding. Among such 'primary' realities are the 'complex interrelations' between the small world of my own words and the 'immense, boundless world of others' words' (Bakhtin 1986: 143) into which I come and which will be there after I am gone: a reality which is not only not conceived but positively obscured by the study of culture which rarefies and effaces the struggle that takes place between these two verbal worlds of the 'mine' and the 'yours' in the construction of 'objectivity'. 'Objec- tivity' arises on the ruins of the I and the thou . Abstraction is not the value-free, ethically neutral act of resolving already lifeless particu- lars into still more ethereal generalities; it is quite specifically 'abstraction from the / and the thou ' ; it is 'life as the object of thought' (Bakhtin 1986:143-144). Life cannot become the object of thought without the prior move of turning the intersubjective nexus of first and second persons into the 'position of the third party' (Bakhtin 1986: 143). Bakhtin's point is that abstract thought by definition unfits itself for conceiving that on the destruction or rarefaction of which it has itself been constituted; that it cannot make a theme of that which it implicitly posits itself against in its very form and constitution. Hermeneutic understanding by contrast is the self-consciousness of 'the most vital, experienced life' (Bakhtin 1986:144): the unmerged I and thou and he will be brought to light only by sciences of the spirit which conceive their own method as the unmerged and unmerging interaction of an I and a thou , of two 'spirits', the person who understands on the one hand and the understood on the other. What is understood is meaning ; and Bakhtin at this point proffers a definition of (a) meaning in negative terms when he writes: 'anything that does not answer a question is devoid of sense for us' (Bakhtin 1986:145). We might develop this by saying that the meaning of a</page><page sequence="15">Eternity, Modernity and Bakhtin 75 text is then to be found on the boundary between the question it answers in its context and the question it in turn asks of me in mine. (A) meaning is the living precipitate of an act of understanding - living in so far as it always demands of me another act of intersubjective understanding. The answer to a question which always asks or provokes another one: that is a meaning. In reconstructing the question to which a text is an (not the) answer, I cannot but at the same time frame the question it asks of me and prepare an answer accordingly. This answer may not be articulated - may not be a text but instead those potential texts which are my later deeds. This is what Bakhtin calls 'contextual meaning': meaning that is responsive, universal, omnitemporal. Contextual meaning is 'truly' universal; 'formal definition', the product of 'abstract thought', is universal only as it were in theory, only 'potential meaning' (Bakhtin 1986:145). In abstract thought, context carries a connotation of the particular, the less than universal. The universality of contextual meaning is therefore a case of paradoxical hyperbole from the standpoint of such thinking; even a contradiction in terms. From Bakhtin' s point of view it is the claim of abstract thought to be universal that is paradoxical, inasmuch as that order of thought is the product of a particular history and of a determinate mental operation. It is itself the result of an act in a certain historical European context which hubristically elevates its own claim to universality over that of the world of contextual meaning, a world which it at once historically springs from and thematically represses. All of our time and all of our space is filled with contextual meaning. Hermeneutic understanding has privileged access to life as it is intersubjectively lived; it does not seek to supplant abstract thought; by rendering reflexive that meeting of contextual meanings by which we all truly understand, it can tell the story of abstract thought which that thought itself is constitutively unable to tell. Pragmatically, it can help us to put abstract thought in its place: determine where such thinking is appropriate and where not. Before we even begin to think of our world as 'objective' we must remember that we already live in and are occupied by the everlasting agonistics of contextual meaning that is everywhere in our reality. We have seen how the 'Notes' of 1971 began by giving a new face to irony - positively revaluing it as the ubiquitous modern language of freedom rather than as a sort of etiolated remnant of carnival. Near the end of the same text we find Bakhtin giving a new face to the novel, in a structurally similar move. Thirty years earlier he had presented the novel as the genre of contemporaneity par excellence , the modern narrative, defined by its difference from the ancient narrative form of epic wedded to the 'absolute past'. Now the operative opposition is between the polyphonic novel (not mentioned</page><page sequence="16">76 Theoria since 1929) and what we might call the genre of absolute contempor- aneity: journalism. This modern counterpart of ancient rhetoric is the genre of now-as-the-time-of-resolution. Like the law - and is Bakhtin also perhaps thinking of politics here? - journalism assigns guilt and innocence absolutely, and its subjects are 'third part[ies]' (Bakhtin 1986:150). It is dominated by a logic of winning and losing and by a kind of dialogue that can be resolved and ended. Bakhtin seems to imply that, unlike true contextual meaning - that greatest of all powers in the world which nevertheless cannot change 'existence itself - the discourse of journalism is a case of language seeking to approach the condition of an 'empirical force', an instrumentalized language that can be 'translated into action' (Bakhtin 1986:152) almost immediately. Journalism is the sort of (relatively) impover- ished meaning that can become a material force; the corollary of its relative weakness as meaning is its relative strength as the discursive accompaniment or impulse to material intervention in reality. This discourse of either-or, of winners and losers, of subjects that are categories of persons rather than 'personalities', 'acting agents' (Bakhtin 1986:152) rather than hero-ideologues, is also (surely) in some sense the discourse of parties - of 'the Party'. However that may be, what is certain is that the polyphonic novel is the form that is at the furthest remove from the discourse of 'small time', with its 'issues that have been resolved within the epoch' (Bakhtin 1986:151). Where before Bakhtin had encoded a modernist stance in offering the novel as the genre of modernity, he now openly proclaims the Dostoevskian prototype of modernist fiction as the genre of omni- temporality. Polyphony opens us to a semantic eternity in so far as it resolves the immediate struggles of all epochs into the forever irresolvable 'dialogue on ultimate questions (in the framework of great time)' (Bakhtin 1986:151). Like the church in Orthodox theology, its heroes speak and act and think 'before heaven and earth' (Bakhtin 1986:152), compelling the intimate and immediate into the ultimate. We can now see the truth of Tzvetan Todorov's observation that in Bakhtin 'Dostoevsky has ceased standing as the object of study' and has *pass[ed] to the side of the subject'.15 That is to say, there is an analogy between hermeneutic philosophy and polyphonic poetics: Bakhtin finds in Dostoevsky's fiction a model of the infinite reach of understanding outside fiction, in life. As Dostoevsky does with his heroes, so must we go to work with cultural texts and their meanings; we must become readers (in the widest sense) after the fashion in which he was a writer. Dostoevsky's poetics of fiction is trans-rhetorical in exactly the way that the hermeneutics here espoused by Bakhtin is translinguistic: in both cases the discourse is 'beyond' in the sense of 'outside', a metalanguage but without</page><page sequence="17">Eternity, Modernity and Bakhtin 77 the (mono)logical implications usually carried by that term. Dostoevski's (proto)modernist aesthetic is given a postmodern reinflection as the model for a critical knowledge of and in late modernity. His nexus of ultimacy and intimacy offers us a paradigm of a sort of politics of the spirit that Bakhtin wishes to launch into the world as the 'consummating' outside of a politics that resolves issues summarily and in the short term - rather in the way that Justice should ideally both embrace and inform the practice of Law. Ethics for Bakhtin is just such a spiritual politics, a realm of deeply obligating imperatives that can never be assimilated to the realm of state decrees and formal legality that it always and everywhere lovingly-critically shadows. IV Bakhtin's last reflections in Towards a Methodology for the Human Sciences' begin with the word 'Understanding', capitalized, much like a single note or chord struck at the start of a piece of music. Understanding is a complex, composite act whose phases - component acts, as it were - have their 'semantic independence' even as they merge in the whole 'empirical act' itself (Bakhtin 1986:159). These phases are: perception; recognition; understanding 'significance' in the 'given context'; and finally 'inclusion in the dialogical context' (Bakhtin 1986:159). Only the last of these is truly actively evaluative, extending beyond the immediate context to deep-universal meanings in the dimension of great time. Now it is here that we find yet another of those striking revaluations of earlier categories that I have twice remarked upon, and this time the category to be reinflected/rehabilitated (this was after all a moment of many 'rehabilitations' in the then Soviet Union) is the symbol . In 'Discourse in the Novel' the symbol had been assimilated to the poetic trope, and it had been construed as the monological correlative of the (dialo- gized) 'prosaic' symbol.16 The symbol was then single-voiced in so far as it rested upon a logical relation, was self-identical, and was always adequate to its referential object. Here, by contrast, the symbol becomes the valorized term of a new pair, and its other is now the 'image'. As the word which connotes the world, the symbol is now counterposed to the verbal trope with a limited reference. Indeed 'the image' now seems to be much the same entity as was earlier meant by the (undialogized, unprosaicized) symbol. An image can be made into or understood as a symbol by activating in it the potential infinity of contextual meaning. Correlated with 'worldwide wholeness' and resolving the particular into the primordial, the symbol produces in</page><page sequence="18">78 Theoria me 'an awareness that [I] do not coincide with [my] own individual meaning' (Bakhtin 1986:159). In other words, it is the aesthetic resolution of the ethical 'I-for-myself into 'I-for-another/another- for-me'. The understanding of the symbol is itself symbolic, an instance of 'somewhat rationalized' symbolicity tending towards - without ever reaching - conceptuality: 'there can be relative rationa- lization of the contextual meaning (ordinary scientific analysis) or a deepening with the help of other meanings . . . through expansion of the remote context' (Bakhtin 1986:160). The symbol is understood only by opening an 'infinity of symbolic contextual meanings'; the image, while it can be submitted to this kind of understanding, does not demand more than the unfolding of 'significance in the given context' (Bakhtin 1986:160). In the symbol we have that which imperatively calls upon us to effect an unfolding of the remotest contexts; the discursive phenomenon which brings all conceptual analysis up against its limits. With the symbol the hermeneutic circle is stretched to its widest reach before the return to the text is made: it is the textual part which invokes the most extensive contextual whole, the most extensive semantic opening-out through time-space. It does not follow that a word with the temporal reach of the symbolic is an ancient phenomenon, a survival: it is as modern as the polyphonic novel. Bakhtin' s periodization of the history of meaning moves from an epoch of 'naïve mythical personification' through the 'epoch of reification of nature and man' - presumably the mid-life of modernity in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries - and on to our own time, which he characterizes as that of 'personification of nature and man', but without loss of reification' (Bakhtin 1986:169). The symbol is a feature of this last phase of late modernity which has seen the rise of philosophies which repersonify 'nature and man' not naively but self-consciously, reflexively, in conscious resistance to high-modern reification, taking this stance in some cases all the way to a total critique of reason of the kind that has prompted Habermas to relaunch the project of reason under late-modern conditions. This reflexively personifying thought, which takes as its field the radically interpersonal nature of our being-in-the- world, is Bakhtin' s alterna- tive within modernity to the purposive rationality that holds sway over modern life. Its equivalent to the orthodox conceptuality of modern reason is, one presumes, the 'relatively rationalized' (metalanguage of symbol: in short, something like the discourse of Bakhtin himself in these late fragments. The universalism of this language is achieved without reification or abstraction, and it is also more encompassing than the universalism of laughter which Bakhtin had championed in his middle period. It is 'not hostile to the mythic, and frequently utilizes its language (transformation into the language of symbols)'</page><page sequence="19">Eternity , Modernity and Bakhtin 79 (Bakhtin 1986:169). That is to say, it doesn't share the prejudice of Enlightenment reason against myth; on the contrary, it puts myth to use in a way which is appropriate to a late-modern critique of reason that wishes to avoid the 'self-destruction' of reason described by Adorno and Horkheimer. The symbol along with its quasi-symbolic interprétants is the most potent signifier of a late-modern discourse which is critical of the concept and yet knows it cannot return to the spontaneous personification and ritual performativity of the pre- modern. It would seem that the sub-textual act of understanding going on in these thoughts on understanding is the effort of the old and dying Bakhtin to understand his own ideas, to make deep sense of his whole career as a thinker and thereby to fashion a philosophy for our postmodernity. For Bakhtin the 'place of philosophy' (Bakhtin 1986:161) is on the boundary between exact science and hermeneutic understanding, as the metalanguage of all knowledges. If then Bakhtin is plainly no 'postmodernist' in the Lyotardian mould - that view of philosophy hardly bespeaks a thinker who doubts the commensurability of language games and is suspicious of all 'meta-' claims - he is certainly in a broad sense postmodern first and last. We might even see his modernist middle period as a digression, an interlude between two phases which reconnect beyond its end, without the last being either a simple or 'dialectical' return to the first. The populist aesthetico-political modernism of the nineteen-thirties and early forties takes its place within the longer temporality of his whole thinking life. Bakhtin now seeks to situate the phases of his thinking in relation to each other and to situate that thinking as a whole in relation to the context(s) of its inception and reception. The remarks he makes on Dilthey and Hegel as both of them monological thinkers signal this reflexive self-consciousness that now comes to character- ize his thought. Dilthey' s post-dialectical move fails to establish a properly dialogical order of thinking: narrowly psychological and epistemological, Dilthey' s hermeneutic is predicated upon a philoso- phy of consciousness which eschews Absolute Spirit only to install an equally single-voiced Einfühlung . The turn from objective Spirit to psychology as the ground both of understanding and action merely supplants one philosophical monologism with another. The diachro- nically inflected metaphysics called dialectics, in which philosophy is the sublation of all earlier expressions of Spirit, was not challenged by a revival of empathetic Romantic hermeneutics which extends the definition of 'text' to the events of history. Einfühlung , in short, is no challenge to Aufhebung. Thought is nothing if not worldly for Bakhtin, in the sense that at its highest and deepest it is both 'in' and 'about' the world. Thought is a special kind of event in the world</page><page sequence="20">80 Theoria because at its fullest stretch it embraces that greatest of all events which is the world. In the hermeneutically inspired fundamental ontology Bakhtin is here exploring (for the last time), thought is nothing less than the self-awareness of the multifarious 'eventness' of everything. Or again: there is a great intersubjective project that we call 'the worlď, and thought is the reflection of this project upon itself which deeply respects and faithfully preserves the open-ended heterogeneity of being. Occupying his boundary position as a philosopher between the precise and the human sciences, Bakhtin accordingly rethinks the objects of these knowledges - the 'thing' and the 'personality' respectively - not as substances but rather as extremes of a con- tinuum between which all thought oscillates asymptotically. That contact between texts in which alone texts live and are understood is at bottom a 'contact of personalities and not of things (at the extreme)' (Bakhtin 1986:162). Yet Bakhtin also insists - and that last paren- thesis begins the suggestion - that thing and personality are hypothe- tical limiting cases which are never actually encountered in their pure state: there is simply thinking that is tendentially reificatory, and thinking that is tendentially personificatory. Reification and personi- fication are not absolute conditions after all, but tendencies subject to mutual modification: in short, relative states. The language of causality and 'material conditions' realizes and absolutizes things: unmodified by the language of interacting texts (personalities), it monopolizes understanding. Bakhtin is seeking a philosophical narrative which neither heroizes the personality nor demonizes the thing, but rather sees both as effects of the way I speak about what is not myself, effects which realize extreme possibilities of speech but which are never fully 'effective'. Bakhtin's old friends tone and intonation put in a last appearance in this context. The tone of performative utterances can find its way into speech or writing that is not technically performative; the intonation of words that take speech as close as it ever gets to action (words that 'do things') can take leave of its typical content and inform any aspect of speech. All our understanding is informed by an underlying 'tonality' of conscious- ness, a quasi-semantic context of inexplicit evaluation on the ground of which 'complete, semantic understanding' arises (Bakhtin 1986: 164). Within this accompanying music of cognition are tones that reify, tones that personify. To affect a personality a thing must already have become a (potential) word, a contextual meaning. Aesthetic activity at its strongest is exemplary inasmuch as it is the one human function that makes its business the assimilation of the world of things to the world of personalities. And so we come at last to Bakhtin's closing meditation upon great</page><page sequence="21">Eternity , Modernity and Bakhtin 81 time. An important stage in the train of thought is the reflection on 'form' and 'content' in his last notes - and in particular on the more-or-less smooth and automatic issue of form into content in premodern times. Form is conceived as generic pre-understanding or 'congealed' content which always precedes the initiative of those who put it to use; it is also seen as an 'implicit context' that doesn't need to be spelt out because it is assumed in the very implementation of the form. Bakhtin associates form in this sense of tradition with 'general collective creativity' and 'mythological systems' (Bakhtin 1986: 166). The cultural texts of post-traditional societies effectively turn this situation inside-out, in that the work now thinks of itself as new and does not so much presuppose tradition as challenge me to create the tradition from which its novelty might be supposed to have sprung. Hermeneutic interpretation only becomes at once necessary and possible when innovation has to be deconstructed in what is simultaneously a reconstruction of tradition: the 'before' or 'already' that the work might have acknowledged is brought to light in order that its 'after' or 'not yet' - its reception by a collectivity in principle without bounds - might be realized. Symbols are an instance for Bakhtin of this modern 'form': at one and the same time the 'most stable' and the 'most emotional elements' of discourse (Bakhtin 1986: 166), they proclaim within the condition of modernity a universality which is non-conceptual. In order for this non-conceptual universal- ism to be apprehended, I must move beyond the mere 'recognition' of meaning at the level of the text's iterable technicalities (and their corollary: the anonymous and uncontextualized 'individual con- sciousness') to attain to - or rather activate - that deep-semantic understanding which is essentially 'evaluative'. The symbol calls forth this understanding beyond 'definition', and is nothing without it. When Bakhtin writes that the work's 'evaluative-semantic aspect' is 'meaningful only to individuals who are related by some common conditions of life ... by the bonds of brotherhood on a high level' (Bakhtin 1986:166), we are strongly reminded both of the Kantian notion of the aesthetic as founded upon community and of the Wittgensteinian notion of the relation between meaning and 'forms of life'. Perhaps then the difference between 'myth' and 'symbol' in Bakhtin's (late) sense of those terms is that the 'common conditions' that are taken for granted in the texts of the first have to be explicitly posited in the texts of the second. 'Assimilation' to a 'higher ... at the extreme absolute value' (Bakhtin 1986:166) is the modern surrogate for the implicit pre-understanding and pre-evaluation of premodernity. 'Deep' understanding in our epoch presupposes the transformation of what had been given into a project, the formation of</page><page sequence="22">82 Theoria a past which is paradoxically also a future. The category of the aesthetic is the offshoot of an eighteenth-century move in which posited community filled the space vacated by the departure of given community, while at the same time containing any emancipatory ethico-political implications by conceiving the aesthetic as a separate faculty of the same subject that carried the dominant (paradig- matically logical or mathematical) rationality. The Romantic moment saw the partial liberation of the aesthetic as it was freed into an autonomy over-against the rational - an autönomy which in the end only reproduced the Enlightenment structure of oppositions it had sought to invest with opposite values. Turning the binaries of reason on their heads left them much as they had always been, resulting not in a critique of the modern project but in a new lease of life, and thereby opening the space for those revivals of its promises that bear the names of Hegel and Marx. Bakhtin represents a twentieth-century hermeneutic or philosophical-anthropological move which revives in a radical way the move that inaugurated the aesthetic as a category, without keeping it from challenging the dominant conceptuality; or posing it as an anti-conceptuality ; or sweeping it up as a moment in the totalizing conceptuality of the dialectic. With his help we are able to think an agonistics of deep meaning which challenges the dominant conceptuality on a ground other than of the latter' s choosing, and which is not to be superseded by 'philosophy' in the grand march of the Concept in history. The deep 'form' characteristic of modernity is the 'tradition' of post-traditional societies, and it is what we must (re)turn to if we wish to argue that the loss of 'given' community does not have to be made good by the abstract universality of the unsituated thinking subject. Community comes to take up its residence in language conceived neither as a tool nor as a system but as our only home. Great time cannot be properly elucidated without, finally, probing further Bakhtin' s crucial distinction between 'the work' and 'the text' . The work is the text as performed (read) or potentially performed (read); it is what we have when the text is enabled at least partially to realize the far larger and potentially infinite context in which it resonates. Commenting on the notion of 'kin' in one of his earliest essays, Bakhtin writes that we ought to say not 'They are mine' but rather 'I am theirs':17 his translinguistic project is analogously a hermeneutic which concerns itself not so much with this text's context as with this context's text(s). Most profoundly, this 'extratextual' context is neither one of inert things - that much we have already seen - nor is it one of words in any lexico-semantic or purely linguistic sense: it is a context of tones. It is the never-fully-realized 'intonational-evaluative context' against which the text is perceived,</page><page sequence="23">Eternity, Modernity and Bakhtin 83 in which alone it lives as a work. The work', Bakhtin writes, is enveloped in the music of the intonational-evaluative context in which it is understood and evaluated' (Bakhtin 1986:166). Un- derstanding is, then, listening for context: context conceived as the music of the spheres of meaning, the resonance within which the work is individuated and resonates in its turn. Great time is not an objective state of things; it is a level of understanding in which the remotest of contexts meet and make mutual sense. It is nothing less than 'outsideness' launched into history. It is the temporal dimension of 'I-for-another' and 'the-other-for-me' , while 'small time' is the equivalent of 'I-for-my self , the easily memorable past and the merely 'imaginable' future of fear and hope. The cultural text read in the dimension of great time is understood prophetically: that is, as a moment in a process which I use my outsideness to apprehend but which at the same time I can only apprehend if I also enter imaginatively the realm of its outsideness in respect of me. At the last boundary of his life, going out of the phenomenal world, Bakhtin contemplates 'the future without me' (Bakhtin 1986:167). Un- derstanding in the aspect of great time I learn to turn my temporal and cultural outsideness inside-out; I learn to transcend in terms of time the category of 'I-for-myself'; I enter the sphere of 'evaluative non-predetermination, unexpectedness . . . absolute innovation, mir- acle' (Bakhtin 1986:167). The new in this deep-semantic sense is of the order of grace: the future neither hoped for nor feared but in which our completion as finite beings lies. We must live in the present, recalling at every moment that where we are, the anticipation of the past and the memory of the future intersect. Modernist notions of amnesiac novelty have no appeal for the dying Bakhtin; not because he takes an anti-modernist stance but because late modernity both needs and makes available a new sense of the miraculous. The event that nobody living in the category of 'I-for-myself and 'small time' could have expected is the event that only the community of others-for-others could most deeply understand. We are 'in' great time in so far as texts are for us not mere iterable entities but provisional climaxes in the unceasing music of contexts speaking to each other against all the material odds and across the deepest of empirical divides.</page><page sequence="24">84 Theoria NOTES 1. Bakhtin 1986, p. 170. The present essay takes the form of a relatively unstructured commentary on the three last texts in this volume (see pp. 102-172), which the reader is advised to read before reading the essay itself. Like the texts upon which it is a meditation, it is wholly provisional and exploratory and has no pretensions to an 'argument' . This episode in my understanding of the late Bakhtin is dedicated to my wife Nola Glendinning, the miniaturist and painter of icons whose extraordinary work will be known to many friends of this journal, and who died very shortly after it was finished; and to my mother Dorothy Martin, who died while I was writing it. 2.

Auerbach's claim that Dante's 'beyond' is 'changeless and of all time and yet full of history' (Auerbach 1968, p. 197) coincides closely with Bakhtin's notion of a 'tension' between 'living historical time' and the 'extratemporal otherworldly ideal' (Bakhtin 1981, p. 158) fiat governs the form of The Divine Comedy. 5. Bakhtin's own phrase for this preoccupation of the novel is the 'inconclusive present': see (for example) Bakhtin 1981, p. 26. 6. Bakhtin, 1981, p.291. 7. Vnenakhodimosť in the Russian; Todorov (1984) renders this concept as 'exotopy'. Its force resides in its stress on the uniqueness of my place in being: answering to my outsideness to (all) others is their outsideness to me. We 'consummate' each other but can never 'consummate' our individual selves. Aesthetic differs from cognitive or epistemological activity in its respect for this absolute mutual outsideness of others-for-others.
