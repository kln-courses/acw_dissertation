<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> ARTICLES Animals and Moral Agency:   The Recent Debate   and Its Implications GRACE CLEMENT Salisbury University, Salisbury, Maryland. In the last 25 years, several philosophers and scientists have challenged the historical  consensus that nonhuman animals cannot be moral agents. In this article, I examine  this challenge and the debate it has provoked. Advocates of animal moral agency have  supported their claims by appealing to non-rationalist accounts of morality and to  observations of animal behavior. Critics have focused on the dangers of anthropomor- phism and have argued that we cannot know animals’ states of mind with any certainty.  Despite the strengths of the arguments for animal moral agency, the critics’ skeptical  counter-challenges seem to bring this debate to a stalemate. However, I suggest that  recent philosophical work focusing on personal experiences with animals may reveal  a way to dissolve skeptical concerns and offer new insights about the role of animals  in morality. key words: animals, moral agency, morality, anthropomorphism, skepticism,  animal advocacy, human–animal relationships, companion animals We sometimes speak of nonhuman animals as if they can possess virtues such as loyalty,  courage, and friendship or even vices such as untrustworthiness or cruelty. When we think  about this matter more carefully, however, we may regard this as just a way of speaking,  not something we really mean. Morality, we know, is a human affair. Moral beings must be  able to think about their actions, life, and values in ways that nonhuman animals cannot.  Animals may be the recipients of moral (or immoral) treatment, or be moral patients, but  only humans are truly moral agents. Indeed, the view of nonhuman animals as amoral—as  not responsible for their actions and thus undeserving of any moral praise or blame—has  been the prevailing view in the history of Western philosophy.  However, in the last 25 years a number of philosophers and scientists have made  the case that at least some nonhuman animals are best understood as moral agents in  some ways, and this question has become a subject of a good deal of academic discus- Journal of Animal Ethics 3 (1): 1–14 © 2013 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois </page> <page sequence="2"> 2 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013) sion and debate. In this article I examine three focal points of this discussion: first, the  nature of morality and what this implies about nonhuman animals; second, whether we  can know animals’ states of mind; and third, how the question of animal moral agency  relates to human–animal relations. There is obviously a great deal of detail and depth  to these discussions that I am not able to cover here,1 and I do not claim to resolve the  issues surrounding the notion of animal moral agency. I do show that the view that some  nonhuman animals are moral actors to some extent finds support from a number of di- rections, yet it cannot decisively defeat skeptical challenges. In addition, I suggest that  an alternative approach arising out of personal experiences with animals may be able to  dissolve skeptical concerns and offer new insights about the role of animals in morality. CHANGING CONCEPTIONS OF MORALITY AND THEIR  IMPLICATIONS FOR ANIMALS The problem with psychopaths is not so much that they lack a sense of duty (though they  may) but that they do not care about other people, and their desires are not extinguished,  changed or inhibited by the sight of distress. —Stephen Clark (1984, pp. 40–41) The recent discussion of the idea that some nonhuman animals might qualify as moral  agents began in the mid-1980s when some philosophers challenged rationalist concep- tions of morality in favor of more empiricist conceptions. I begin with a little historical  background for their work. Some Western philosophers, most notably Descartes (1970),  have taken the position that nonhuman animals lack even consciousness—they are “ma- chines.” But most philosophers have not gone so far. Most allow that animals have con- scious intentions—that, for instance, mother animals do desire to help their infants. Yet  they deny that such intentions or desires constitute moral agency, on the grounds that  they do not necessarily involve the rationality that is essential to morality. According to  Kant’s (1997) account of morality, for instance, rationality allows an individual to decide  to do the right thing because it is right and thereby to override passions to the contrary.  In general, rational beings not only can do the right thing but also can think about what  the right thing to do might be. They can go beyond satisfying their immediate wants and  attempt to fulfill an ideal way of life. In this view, humans are also animals, as evidenced  by their “non-rational” faculties—variously labeled desires, inclinations, sentiments, or  emotions—but humans, unlike other animals, use reason to rise above their “animal na- ture” and become moral beings. Without reason, there is no way to know whether one’s  inclinations are good or bad.  One figure in Western philosophy who avoided—and even combated—this rational- ist conception of morality is David Hume. According to Hume, morality is based on  sentiment, not reason, and animals experience many of the same sentiments as humans.  Hume’s list of natural virtues includes a number of virtues that are arguably held by ani- mals, such as friendliness, fidelity, industry, perseverance, and courage. He also argues  </page> <page sequence="3">  Clement, Animals and Moral Agency 3 against those who would say that such qualities are in fact virtues only if they are volun- tary.2 On the other hand, in a number of passages Hume (1978) asserts that morality is a  distinctively human phenomenon, even referring to the moral sense as the principle of  humanity; he writes, “Thus animals have little or no sense of virtue or vice; they quickly  lose sight of the relations of blood; and are incapable of that of right and property” (p.  326), arguing also that “their want of a sufficient degree of reason may hinder them from  perceiving the duties and obligations of morality” (p. 468). In this view, animals lack the  capacity for moral evaluation. Our natural sympathies tend to be biased toward those  close to us, and to make moral judgments we must compensate by developing artificial  virtues such as justice that require an impartial point of view. Although Hume describes  moral judgment as a kind of sense, this sense is different from both sense perception and  the passions that animals share with humans.  In sum, Hume accepts that animals may have natural virtues but denies that they can  have artificial virtues or make moral evaluations. This suggests a distinction that we (and  philosophers) do not usually make: that between moral agents and moral judges. Thus,  Hume’s theory suggests that perhaps some nonhuman animals can be moral agents even  though they cannot be moral judges.3 A being, whether human or animal, who acts in a  sympathetic way can evoke our moral approbation, independently of whether that being  himself or herself can make a similar moral judgment. Hume also suggests that there are  degrees of moral agency. To reach the highest levels of moral agency, one would have to  develop one’s own character based on one’s own moral judgments of oneself. But this  need not mean that only moral judges can be moral agents in any sense.  The contemporary moral philosophers Steven Sapontzis and Stephen Clark initiated  the recent debate when they defended non-Kantian accounts of morality and connected  them to the notion of animal moral agency. According to Sapontzis (1987), an act can be  instinctual or conditioned yet still be a response to moral goods and evils (pp. 32–33). “For  better or worse, unswerving dedication, loyalty, and commitment to recognized values have  been and still are commonly valued as highly as, or even more highly than, the mastery of  ‘subtle’ moral reasoning” (Sapontzis, 1987, p. 23). We should not, Sapontzis says, confuse  morality with moral theory: Although abstract reasoning and principles are necessary for  constructing moral theories, they are not necessary for intentional, straightforward moral  action (Sapontzis, 1987, p. 37). Based on this conception of morality, Sapontzis holds that  (some) nonhuman animals are best understood as moral agents in some ways. “Although  many animals possess sufficient sensitivity and intelligence to recognize virtues and to do  virtuous deeds, they seem to lack the ability to lead a fully moral life dedicated to the at- tainment of an ideal” (Sapontzis, 1987, p. 44).  Clark is more influenced by Aristotle than Hume but reaches similar conclusions. To  be ethical, for Clark (1984), requires responding to aspects of a situation that a good man  would respond to (p. 107). Thus, to respond sympathetically to the needs of others (as  a good man would) is morally good. Moral goodness does not require that an individual  use his or her intellect to determine what makes this good or that he or she act out of a  sense of moral duty. Clark concludes that animals can be ethical but not moral: </page> <page sequence="4"> 4 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013) Beasts are ethical: that is, they respond to aspects of a situation and to features of their  kindred, that a good man also would respect. But they are not moral: for they do not,  as far as we can see, have any occasion to moralize about themselves or to construct  intellectual systems to accommodate their immediate responses. (Clark, 1984, p. 107) Following Aristotle, Clark (1984) holds that animals do not have developed moral systems  and are not motivated by a wish “to do the right thing.” However, animals are not “forced”  to do what they do; what they do can be influenced by their awareness of relevant aspects  of the situation, and their behavior shows their character just as much as what we do  shows ours. For Clark and Sapontzis, then, moral agency is not an all-or-nothing condi- tion; there are levels of moral agency. Thus, although beings—human or not—lacking  highly rational capacities may not be able to be moral philosophers or even full-fledged  moral agents, they may still be able to be ethical or participate in virtue.  Hume’s influence is also evident in the work of Bruce Waller and other recent philoso- phers who have made the case that the origins of morality are found in the natural sentiments  humans share with nonhumans.4 Such philosophers have argued that it is implausible that  morality came into being when selfish but rational beings agreed to a set of moral rules  or when a single selfish but rational being realized the contradiction entailed by his own  selfishness. As Waller (1998) argues, it is much more plausible to think that beings who  already cared for their family and group used reason to sustain and to extend their car- ing sentiments (p. 76). For instance, our reason helps us extend our concern beyond our  own children to more distant children by revealing relevant similarities between the two.  Of course, our sentiments are not always moral, and our rational capacities can help us  develop and correct our passions. But our most basic caring inclinations are not rationally  justified; instead they might be better understood as the basic premises from which reason  proceeds. This line of argument suggests that certain nonhuman social animals might best  be considered proto-moral agents, in that they possess the origins of and certain necessary  conditions for moral agency, even if they lack the sufficient conditions for full moral agency.  These philosophical arguments have found support from some recent scientists, most  notably the ethologists Marc Bekoff and Frans de Waal. De Waal, a primatologist, argues  in the same vein as the philosophers just mentioned that some animals have the founda- tion or “building blocks” of morality. There are, in his view, three levels of morality: moral  sentiments, social pressure, and judgment/reasoning (de Waal, 2006, p. 168). Morality  finds its fullest expression among human beings, but we can observe the building blocks  of morality—moral sentiments and social pressure—among nonhuman primates. De  Waal (2006) concludes, To neglect the common ground with other primates, and to deny the evolutionary roots  of human morality, would be like arriving at the top of a tower to declare that the rest  of the building is irrelevant, that the precious concept of “tower” ought to be reserved  for its summit. (p. 181) The most important point, for de Waal, is that morality cannot be understood as a “veneer”  humans laid over our selfish, aggressive, or otherwise nonmoral natural core. Morality, in this  </page> <page sequence="5">  Clement, Animals and Moral Agency 5 “veneer theory,” is not natural. Against this, de Waal (2006) argues that humans are by nature  good, and we have in fact inherited our good nature from our nonhuman ancestors (p. xii).  Bekoff develops a somewhat different account of how nonhuman animals can par- ticipate in morality. In their book Wild Justice, he and philosopher Jessica Pierce define  morality as “a suite of interrelated other-regarding behaviors that cultivate and regulate  complex interactions within social groups. These behaviors relate to well-being and harm,  and norms of right and wrong attach to many of them” (Bekoff &amp; Pierce, 2009, p. 7).  Notice that this is a very inclusive definition: As long as animal groups have and somehow  enforce social norms, they would seem to have morality. In fact, Bekoff and Pierce write,  “there isn’t a moral gap between humans and other animals. . . . Morality is an evolved  trait and ‘they’ (other animals) have it just like we have it” (p. xi). Contrary to de Waal’s  view, this is a species-relative view of morality, recognizing that norms of behavior—and  morality—will vary across species (Bekoff &amp; Pierce, 2009, p. xii). There are patterns of  moral behavior that have evolved as unique to each species. It is a mistake to assume that  the patterns unique to humans—such as forming and acting on judgments of what we  ought to do—define morality as such (Bekoff &amp; Pierce, 2009, p. 40). But there are also, in  this view, important commonalities among different species’ moralities: Human language  and judgment have added new layers to moral behaviors that we share with other animals.  One apparent difficulty for this position concerns the possibility of animal immorality. If  animals can be fully moral, then it would seem they must be able to be immoral as well.  Bekoff and Pierce address this question directly, claiming that animals (who can be moral)  can indeed be immoral. They give as an example “Nasty Nick,” a baboon who bullied,  harassed, bit, and otherwise acted in clear violation of baboon social norms (Bekoff and  Pierce, 2009, p. 16). In contrast, the wolf who hunts and eats an elk is not, in this view,  immoral; there is no common society and hence no violation of a social norm.  There are significant differences among the positions discussed in this section, differ- ences that we cannot examine here. But there are greater similarities among them: the  emphasis on sentiment rather than reason as the basis of morality, the view that there  are layers and degrees of morality, the view that the evolutionary continuities between  humans and nonhumans are morally significant, and the conclusion that some nonhuman  animals participate in morality in some ways. SKEPTICISM ABOUT ANIMAL MORALITY The conclusion that some animals have morally laden emotions is underdetermined by the  evidence. This is not a proof that establishes that it is necessarily wrong to attribute to ani- mals these kinds of emotions. But in my opinion this conclusion about what animals share  with humans should not be treated as obviously true, requiring no justification whatsoever. —B. A. Dixon (2008, p. 242) A number of thinkers, both philosophical and scientific, have challenged the interpreta- tions of morality and of animals discussed in the previous section, asserting that there  is not sufficient evidence to justify calling any nonhuman animals moral agents. In this  </page> <page sequence="6"> 6 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013) section I focus on the challenges of one scientific skeptic, I. S. Bernstein, and one philo- sophical skeptic, B. A. Dixon, and consider whether advocates of animal moral agency  have a satisfactory response to such challenges.  Advocates of animal moral agency emphasize the observable, behavioral aspect of  morality. Sapontzis (1987) writes, “The reason why animals cannot act morally, if they  cannot, is not to be found at the behavioral level” (p. 31). The scientist Jonathan Balcombe  (2010) illustrates this behavioral focus when he writes of the baboon Benjamin, “Although  it is impossible to confirm whether Benjamin was motivated by desire to do what is right,  there can be no question that his behavior was virtuous. He saved the lives of two terri- fied children, and at great personal risk” (p. 121). This passage suggests that virtue is not  defined in terms of the agent’s motivation. Yet although they focus on the behavioral side  of morality, those taking a stand on animal moral agency also draw important conclusions  about the motives and experiences of animals. Thus, Balcombe’s book from which the  preceding statement comes is subtitled “The Inner Lives of Animals.” Bekoff and Pierce  (2009) likewise go beyond describing behaviors to claim that animals have a sense of justice,  “empathy, forgiveness, trust, reciprocity, and much more as well” (p. xi).  To say that a being is a moral agent is to make a claim not just about that being’s be- haviors but also about that being’s cognitive and emotional states. The difficult question,  then, becomes just what we are justified in inferring about animal intentions from animal  behaviors that we observe. Critics insist that we should not attribute moral emotions to  nonhuman animals if there is a plausible nonmoral explanation for animals’ apparently  moral behavior. I. S. Bernstein (2000) labels this commitment “the law of parsimony,”  writing, “Of course it is possible that animals have a sense of justice and morality. . . . In  science, however, one must present evidence that a certain relationship is true and that  no plausible alternative is possible” (p. 33). The skepticism of this position expresses an  appropriate caution against the tendency to anthropomorphize, to project distinctively  human traits onto nonhumans. People may hold birthday parties for their dog companions,  but that does not mean that they and the dogs have similar conceptions of such events;  the dogs’ caregivers are no doubt projecting onto the dogs their own views about the  importance of birthdays. One way to guard against such anthropomorphism is to avoid  attributing more complex mental or emotional capacities to animals than are necessary  to explain their observed behavior.  Let’s consider how this sort of challenge applies to specific examples of animal behav- ior. Experiments have shown that both rats and rhesus monkeys are willing to give up the  opportunity to eat if pressing the lever for food delivers a shock to a second member of  their species visible in an adjacent chamber. Even though some animals eventually start  pressing the lever for food again, they do so less than when no shock is delivered to the  animal next door (Hauser, 2000, p. 219). In such cases it has appeared to observers that  the animal is indeed acting out of a moral motive such as sympathy and thus is in some  sense a moral agent. However, although these behaviors may superficially resemble moral  acts, there are plausible nonmoral explanations for such animal behavior. Perhaps the  animals refrained from eating not out of sympathy for the second animal but because  </page> <page sequence="7">  Clement, Animals and Moral Agency 7 the shocked animal’s screaming and wriggling were simply unpleasant. Supporting this  second possibility is the result of another experiment, in which rats were deterred from  pressing the food bar even more by white noise than by recordings of rat squeals (Hauser,  2000, p. 220).  The philosopher Beth Dixon (1995) expresses a similar skepticism about the claim  that a dog pulling a child from a fire exhibits moral agency: “Perhaps the dog is made  anxious by the cries for help and only wishes to stop these sounds by the most expedient  method—removing the child from the burning building” (p. 40). A possible response to  this suggestion is as follows: Let’s assume that this speculation is correct, that this dog is  motivated by the fact that he finds the child’s screams unpleasant. This by itself would  not prove that the act was not one of sympathy; in fact, the dog might find the child’s  screams so unpleasant precisely because he sympathizes with the child. A being without  sympathy for the child might not find the screams unpleasant at all, or if he did, he could  no doubt find an easier way to avoid that unpleasant sensation than to run into the burn- ing building. In general, an individual’s interpretations of what is good and bad lead him  or her to have corresponding experiences of pleasant and unpleasant. Thus, even if we  grant that the dog in this example is not acting based on rational principle, we can see  that the dog may still be motivated by a compassion that has moral significance. That  some experiences of unpleasantness are not morally significant (such as hearing white  noise) does not mean that no experiences of unpleasantness are morally significant.  In a later work, Dixon (2008) develops a careful argument against this sort of inter- pretation, one focusing on emotions and their role in morality. She holds that emotions  are morally significant and accepts that animals can act out of emotion, but she makes  the case that not all emotion is morally significant. A “thin” account of compassion, or  a “feeling of kindness that motivates an animal (or a person) to perform morally right  action,” is not morally praiseworthy on its own (Dixon, 2008, p. 68). A “thick” account  of compassion must have a cognitive structure; in particular, it must include both the  belief that the misfortune in question is serious and undeserved and the judgment that  one would suffer in similar circumstances. For Dixon, only a thick account of compassion  is “morally laden” or praiseworthy because only a thick account of compassion specifies  why compassion is morally praiseworthy (2008, pp. 66–67). Dixon holds that animals and  humans share thin compassion but that this is not enough to establish a moral connec- tion. We cannot conclude that animals are moral agents when they behave in ways we  would describe as compassionate if the beings in question were human. Thus, the dog  in the earlier scenario may well act out of compassion, in that he is motivated by kind- ness to perform the morally right action of saving a child, but we have no good reason to  believe that the dog considers the child’s misfortune serious and undeserved and that he  imagines he would suffer in similar circumstances. Dixon’s account of morality focuses  on emotion, and thus it may seem to depart from the tradition of drawing a sharp line  between the moral world of humans and the amoral world of nonhumans. However, her  distinction between “thin” and “thick” emotion is every bit as absolute as the Kantian  distinction between “persons” and “things.” </page> <page sequence="8"> 8 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013)  De Waal does not respond to Dixon in particular, but he defends conclusions about  the “inner life” of nonhuman animals by appealing to evolutionary continuities between  humans and other animals. He agrees that we must be parsimonious in our interpretations  of animals’ experience but argues that there are two different principles of parsimony  to which we might appeal in interpreting apparently moral animal acts. The principle  used by skeptics might be called the principle of cognitive parsimony, in that it claims  that we should prefer explanations in terms of the simplest cognitive capacities that can  account for the behaviors to be explained. On the other hand, de Waal, writing with Jes- sica Flack, defends a principle of evolutionary parsimony, according to which we should  avoid postulating differences between closely related species unless compelled by avail- able evidence (Flack &amp; de Waal, 2000, p. 72). They write, If a person embraces a victim of attack, we assume empathy and perspective-taking to  underlie her behavior. On what grounds would we conclude otherwise when a chim- panzee embraces a victim of attack? To propose a different explanation in the cases of  these animals seems uneconomic, and from an evolutionary perspective, thoroughly  puzzling because identical actions under functionally similar circumstances are unlikely  to be produced through entirely different emotional and cognitive channels. (Flack &amp;  de Waal, 2000, pp. 71–72)5 Although the theory of evolution does not tell us that radical discontinuities between  related species are impossible, it does suggest that they are less likely than continuities  and thus that we should first attempt explanations of such animal behavior in terms of  human–animal continuities.  Whereas critics focus on the dangers of anthropomorphism, de Waal (2001) defends  a certain kind of anthropomorphism on the grounds that it is a “logical starting point  when it comes to animals as close to us as apes” (p. 41). He distinguishes between “bad”  anthropomorphism, which “attributes human feelings and thoughts to animals based  on insufficient information or wishful thinking,” and “informed” anthropomorphism, in  which we “use the fact that we are animals to develop ideas we can put to a test” (de Waal,  2001, p. 78). In fact, he argues, just as we must refer to our own experiences to help us  understand the experiences of other humans, we must refer to our own experiences to  help us understand the experiences of other animals.  De Waal’s arguments do not persuade the skeptics. Sympathy, they would say, is not  moral agency, and the origins of morality are not morality. The fact that there are continu- ities does not mean that there are not also crucial differences. In particular, skeptics would  claim that the human species is so radically different from other species in its capacity  for reason that any anthropomorphism is unwarranted. Skeptics are no doubt correct  that the arguments for animal moral agency—arguments about the nature of morality  and based on observations of animals—are not decisive. Yet the certitude expressed in  skeptics’ rejections of these arguments suggests that they disagree with thinkers such  as de Waal at a more fundamental level. For instance, as noted at the beginning of this  section, Dixon (2008) writes that “this conclusion about what animals share with humans  </page> <page sequence="9">  Clement, Animals and Moral Agency 9 should not be treated as obviously true, requiring no justification whatsoever” (p. 242).  De Waal may well be mistaken in the justifications he offers, but it is simply false to say  that he treats his conclusion as “requiring no justification whatsoever.” Also, despite insist- ing on “the law of parsimony,” some skeptics express what is in fact a non-parsimonious  account of animals. For instance, Jerome Kagan (2000) argues that animals cannot be  moral agents because they have no conscious intentions (p. 47). Bernstein (2000) holds  that animal “mothers do respond to the cries of their young, but not because of a desire  to improve their genetic fitness and not because they know that the infant is distressed  and want to alleviate its suffering” (p. 31). One wonders how Kagan knows that animals  have no conscious intentions and how Bernstein knows that nonhuman animals lack  the requisite cognitive and emotional states to be moral agents. Rather than cautiously  limiting themselves to that which is proven, these skeptics seem to assume that a failure  to prove that a characteristic is present amounts to proof that it is absent.6  This suggests that the two sides in this debate are ultimately divided not by judg- ments about the quality of particular arguments, but by background assumptions about  the nature of the differences between humans and animals. Notice that we do not appeal  to the principle of cognitive parsimony when it comes to the question of whether other  humans are moral agents. Of course, we have no more direct access to their minds than  we do to animals’ minds, but we assume that our commonality with other humans means  that they have moral experiences much like our own. We do not insist on ruling out all  plausible nonmoral explanations of apparently moral actions to be convinced that another  human being is a moral agent. Thus, the insistence that we rule out all plausible nonmoral  explanations of apparently moral actions before we can know that a nonhuman animal is  a moral agent may be the result of accepting a human–animal dualism as a default posi- tion. That is, unless nonmoral explanations prove implausible, animals are assumed to  be completely outside the realm of moral agency. In contrast, those arguing in favor of  animal moral agency take as a default position that humans and animals are biologically  and socially connected; thus, unless proven otherwise, humans and animals are assumed  to have moral capacities that are similar to each other. This suggests that resolving this  debate may require new ways of thinking about and assessing our background assumptions. MORALITY IN HUMAN–ANIMAL RELATIONSHIPS I think there are certain thoughts that can emerge only in the space between a wolf and a man. —Mark Rowlands (2009, p. 11) The recent debate about animal moral agency has taken place at the same time as ex- tensive philosophical debate about animal rights and human responsibilities to animals.  Oddly, though, the two debates seem to have little to do with one another. In fact, almost  all of those on all sides of the animal rights debates seem to take for granted that non- human animals are not moral agents. Animal rights advocates in particular often argue  that a being need not be capable of thinking and acting morally in order to have moral  </page> <page sequence="10"> 10 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013) status.7 Much animal rights literature focuses on where to draw the line between beings  who are and are not entitled to full (or direct) moral consideration. Some draw the line at  sentience, some draw it at being the subject of a life, and some draw it at moral agency.  Those opposed to animal rights tend to draw the line at relatively “higher” faculties such  as moral agency, whereas those in favor of animal rights tend to draw the line at relatively  “lower” faculties such as sentience. Animal advocate Gary Francione (2000), for instance,  writes, “I draw the line at sentience because . . . sentient beings have interests and the  possession of interests is the necessary and sufficient condition for membership in the  moral community” (p. 175). Similarly, comparisons of animals to “marginal” human be- ings such as the mentally disabled, the comatose, or infants have been made in an effort  to break down the view that only humans have rights and to thereby protect animals.8  Although animal advocates’ approach of drawing the line for moral consideration as  low as possible might succeed in protecting animals, there is a danger of appearing to  concede that animals are merely sentient beings. As we have seen, it is difficult to estab- lish in any uncontroversial way that nonhuman animals possess “higher” faculties such  as rationality or moral agency. That animals are sentient is relatively uncontroversial,  however, so an argument for animal protection based merely on animal sentience seems  to present fewer stumbling blocks than one based on moral agency. Likewise, it is much  easier and more immediately morally pressing to argue that a sentient being should be  free from torture than it is to argue that a human and a dog can be friends. Thus, there  has not been much incentive for animal rights advocates to consider whether nonhuman  animals are moral agents.  However, the claim that sentience is a sufficient condition for membership in the  moral community raises questions. Obviously, sentience is not sufficient for full member- ship in the moral community, given that full members of a moral community have not  only moral rights but moral responsibilities as well. A being who is sentient but does not  in any sense participate in moral agency cannot have moral responsibilities. The reason  that the question of animal moral agency is not merely a metaphysical one but a morally  significant one is that we want to know not just whether we have moral responsibilities  to animals, but what kinds of responsibilities we have and what kinds of relationships we  can hope to have with animals. Deciding whether we should take care of a being, should  refrain from interfering in a being’s life, or can develop a personal relationship with a  being will depend on the nature of the being in question. One does not respect an amoral  being the way one respects a moral agent or even a quasi-moral agent, nor can one trust  a machine-like being the way one can trust a being who has social sentiments similar to  one’s own. Thus, questions of whether and to what extent nonhuman animals might be  moral agents would seem to play an important part in an ethical approach interested not  only in protecting animals from human interference but also in imagining and creating  more positive relationships between humans and other animals.  But many of us already have such relationships with animals, or at least we think we  do. We do commonly hold animals responsible for their behavior; we do praise them for  certain acts and blame them for others. For instance, my dog companion Rosie showed  </page> <page sequence="11">  Clement, Animals and Moral Agency 11 what seemed to me a maternal instinct toward my young children, and I relied on her  to alert me when they awoke and needed me, much as I would rely on my older child to  alert me when the baby awoke and needed me. Given that we do not have philosophical  justification for such attitudes toward animals, should we regard those attitudes as inap- propriate? Or is it possible that such relationships with animals might yield philosophical  insights about the role of animals in morality?  This is the suggestion of recent work of anthropologist Barbara Smuts and philoso- phers Raymond Gaita and Mark Rowlands, all of whom begin with narrative accounts of  their own relationships with specific animals. They do not address the question of animal  agency directly, but they do call their relationships friendships, and they make it clear that  they regard friendship as morally significant. For instance, Smuts (1999) writes of her  relationship with her dog companion Safi, “As in any genuine human-to-human friend- ship, our relationship is predicated on mutual respect and reciprocity” (p. 118). These  authors do not seek to establish what can be known about the “inner lives” of animals.  Rowlands (2009), for instance, writes of his wolf friend Brenin, “Despite living with him  for more than a decade, I’m not sure I’m competent to make such judgements in anything  but the most simple of cases” (pp. 9–10). Rather than addressing these questions as a  way of justifying their interactions with animals, these authors accept and examine the  interactions and relations that they already experience; they consider how best to describe  those relationships and the faculties of both humans and animals that must exist to make  possible these relationships.  It might seem that such an approach begs all the important questions, presupposing  rather than proving that nonhuman animals can be moral agents. In The Philosopher’s Dog,  Gaita (2002) uses his experiences with his companion dog Gypsy to develop a philosophi- cal justification for this approach,9 beginning with the seemingly simple question of how  he can know that Gypsy is a sentient being: Does the dog’s behavior prove that the dog  is sentient? We might say that a dog who howls after being hit by a car gives evidence of  being in pain (Gaita, 2002, p. 51). Ultimately, though, we would probably say that such  a conclusion is highly probable but not absolutely justified. In the end we cannot be  sure what dogs think or feel. Influenced by Wittgenstein, Gaita holds that the search for  justified belief about whether a dog is sentient is mistaken. Instead, he would say, we are  certain that dogs can feel pain and pleasure. Neurological evidence can of course be cited  for this claim, but since we cannot experience the world as a dog, we cannot conclusively  prove that dogs feel pleasure and pain. Moreover, our certainty that dogs feel pleasure and  pain has nothing to do with neurological evidence; rather, it has to do with our ordinary  interactions with them. Even children who know nothing of neurological structures are  certain that dogs feel pain. Thus, Gaita argues, that a dog is a sentient creature is not a  justified belief; it is, rather, an attitude that no one can seriously doubt (Gaita, 2002, p.  45). Although we cannot prove that a dog is a sentient creature, it does not follow that we  should retreat to skepticism about whether dogs are sentient creatures, any more than we  should retreat to skepticism about whether other humans have minds, another certainty  that we cannot definitively prove but cannot seriously doubt. </page> <page sequence="12"> 12 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013)  Gaita (2002) argues that the charge of anthropomorphism often reflects a denial of  the deep connections between humans and other animals: There is no reason to think that we form the concept of intention, for example, first in its  application to human behavior and that we then apply it to animals, when for example,  we see a dog running after a cat. That is what is assumed when people speak of anthro- pomorphism—that we illegitimately apply to animals concepts of conscious states that  we have legitimately developed in relation to human beings. But such concepts, I have  suggested, are formed in responses to animals and to human beings together. (p. 60) Like intention, friendship is not originally a uniquely human phenomenon that is ex- tended, perhaps mistakenly, beyond the human realm. Humans have always experienced  their relationships with companion animals—particularly dogs—as a kind of friendship.  The very concept of friendship emerged, at least in part, from a history of close human– animal interactions.  More generally, this line of thinking suggests that our very understanding of moral- ity is grounded in the kinds of relationships and interactions we can have with (some)  nonhuman animals. Although human–animal relations may not provide an obvious basis  for a Kantian conception of duty, such relations can involve experiences of attention and  trust that may help ground our understanding of a care-based ethics. As an example, my  mother has told me that I learned to walk primarily by holding onto the family dog, who  cooperated and enabled my efforts in this process. This collaboration depended on the  trust of all the parties involved, including the dog, and it was surely also a contribution to  my understanding of what trust means. If trust is an important moral concept10 and one  that emerges from experience, then animals can participate in our moral development  and in the development of our moral understanding.  Gaita’s argument does not establish (or seek to establish) that nonhuman animals  are moral agents. It does, however, suggest that there might be more productive ways  to approach this issue than those that have dominated the recent debate. As we have  seen, disagreements regarding animal moral agency can seem impossible to resolve.  Those on one side of the debate give reasons for thinking it is probable that animals are  in some sense moral agents, whereas those on the other side point out that we cannot  know animals’ states of mind with any certainty. Both sides are probably correct, but it  is not clear where this leaves us. The approach exemplified in the narratives of Smuts,  Rowlands, and Gaita suggests where we might go from here. Rather than redoubling  our efforts to draw inferences about the inner lives of animals based on observations of  animal behavior or dismissing our experiences of nonhuman animals as moral actors,  this approach suggests that we instead regard our relationships with animals as possible  sources of insight and understanding. Notes  1. For instance, I do not examine precise definitions of “moral agency” or differentiate areas  of morality such as cooperation, empathy, and justice. Nor do I consider differences among  species with regard to moral agency. I focus on animals most closely related to humans, both  </page> <page sequence="13">  Clement, Animals and Moral Agency 13 evolutionarily and socially. When I use the term “moral agency,” I mean simply participation in  acts of moral significance.  2. “Most of our qualities, of heart as much as of head, are, he believes, ‘involuntary and neces- sary,’ and so are not likely to be changed by moral scolding. . . .
