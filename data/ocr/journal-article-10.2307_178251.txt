<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ritual Drama of the Sanni Demons: Collective Representations of Disease in Ceylon GANANATH OBEYESEKERE University of Ceylon In this paper I shall analyse the rituals for Sanni Yaka ('the demon of Sanni').l Sanni Yaka is also known as Kola Sanniya and is a pantheistic deity who incorporates eighteen other demons known as Dahaata Sanni (eighteen Sanni) or simply as Sanni Yakku (Sanni demons; Yakku is plural of Yaka). The rituals performed for the Sanni Yakku appear in a large-scale ceremony known as the Sanni Ydkuma, 'the demon ceremony of the Sanni'. In my analysis I shall emphasize the dramatic aspects of the rituals, where the demons appear on stage in masked representations. In these rituals a great deal of comic dialogue and obscenities prevail. Their significance has been missed by Wirz who describes one of these rituals, the dolaha pelapaliya (spectacle for the twelve gods) in the following terms: 'This scene is called simply 'pelapaliya', which may best be translated as 'dance suite', or 'musical show.' . . . In reality, it is only interposed for diversion and has no deeper meaning' (1954: 59). A highly sophisticated anthropologist presumably refers to similar comic humour when he says that 'after more hocus-pocus, Riri Yaka is eventually told that by the orders of the Buddha (Budu anin) and the power of the gods (deviyange bale) he must accept the dola (offering) and remove his curse from the patient' (Ames, 1964: 42). Almost identical words are spoken to Kola Sanniya in the Sanni Ydkuma ritual, but we shall interpret and unravel the symbolic meaning of these humorous ritual dramas and consider their evolution and social functions. INTRODUCTION According to the Sinhalese Buddhists of Ceylon, diseases can be caused by natural or by supernatural agents. The naturalistic theory of disease causation is entirely based on the Sanskritic Ayurveda. On the village 1 I thank the Foundations Fundfor Research in Psychiatry for a research grant which made possible the field work and leisure that went into writing this paper. I am grateful to Edward B. Harper who read the first draft of this paper and made valuable comments; and to Sarath Amunugama and H. L. Seneviratne who also helped me in various ways. The area in which I did field work was Hinidum Pattu in South Ceylon. However, I've seen the same rituals performed in other parts of the southern and western provinces of Ceylon. I74</page><page sequence="2">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS 175 level the practitioner of the Ayurveda is known as the vedarala (gentlemen learned in the [ayur] veda). According to Ayurveda, disease is caused by the upsetting or excitement of any one or more of the three humours basic to the human organism: vata or vayu (wind), pitta (bile), sleshma or kapha (phlegm). Collectively these are known as the tri-dosa, 'the three troubles' (Sinhalese, tun dosa). In addition to the diseases that spring from within the organism are those caused by external (supernatural) agencies. Thus demons, and gods, may also cause diseases and other types of misfortune like drought, flood and famine and certain types of illnesses. These misfortunes caused by external agencies are also called dosa: yaksha dosa (dosa caused by demons), deva dosa (dosa caused by gods), preta dosa (dosa caused by mean spirits), and so forth. Ultimately all misfortunes caused by external agencies are due to unfavourable planetary movements (graha dosa): astrology in turn however simply indicates a person's karma, in this case bad karma or karma dosa (see Obeyesekere, 1967 for details). In this paper what is relevant are the misfortunes caused by demons (yaksha dosa). Generally the misfortunes caused by demons are illnesses (leda, roga). However, the demonic theory of disease causation is linked to the classical Ayurvedic theory in a very interesting manner. Demonic incursions, as well as incursions by any external spirit, cause in turn the upsetting of the three humours, so that the symptoms of demonic illness may be similar to the symptoms of physical illness. The cure however is different. In Ayurveda the symptoms are treated, and humoral homeostasis is restored by physical medicine. But according to ritual medicine, the demon or spirit possessing the patient has to be banished in order to restore proper humoral functioning. Herbal medicines and decoctions may be given, but they are ancillary to the main treatment which is the placation and banishment of the agents causing the disease. Ritual special- ists also recognize that the identical disease may be caused by either naturalistic (Ayurvedic) or demonological factors. For example, le male (menorraghia) can be caused by a natural excitement of heat (uszsa) or bile (pitta) in the body, or by the demon Sanni Yaka, or Riri Yaka (blood demon). If Ayuryedic medicine does not work for this condition, one assumes that it is caused by a demonic agency, and ritual curing is in order. Yaksha misfortunes arise when demons cast their eyes (bdlma) on a patient. This can happen in various ways. For example, the demon may himself cast his eyes on a person and thereby make him ill. Alternatively, a demon may be made to do so by another person, a sorcerer; for accord- ing to Sinhalese magic, ingredients used in sorcery contain the essence of the deity. When a demon's look falls on a person or object, the latter is infused with the spirit or essence of the deity known as dishti. The idea</page><page sequence="3">I76 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE that the eyes, or the look, contain the essence of the deity is very important in Sinhalese belief. For example, statues of the Buddha or one of the Gods are viewed as imbued with 'life' only after an 'eye-laying' ritual, hedged around with many taboos, is performed (Hocart, 1927; Gombrich, 1966). In the context of demonological illness, the essence of the demon resides in the patient, causing a serious change in the ritual status of the latter. One manifestation of the changed ritual status is illness. In Sinhalese religion there are various demons or yakas who belong to two types: major demons of the Sinhalese pantheon whose myths of origin relate them to the time in which the Buddha was living, and minor demons, like spirits, ghosts and goblins who are continually being born. Of the latter type the most common illness-causing demons are the pretas and mala yakas, the mean spirits of dead ancestors. Most illnesses are caused by the major demons of the pantheon such as the sanni demons and by the inferior pretas. The major demons, according to myth, have been banished from the earth by the Buddha and live in a special abode under the command of their king, Vesamuni (Sanskrit, Vaisrdvana, a deity who appears in Buddhist texts as the Guardian of the Northern Quarter). Thus these demons cannot be physically present in the human world; they can be present only in their essence and as apparitions (avatara). This is not true of the inferior spirits of dead ancestors, the pretas and mala yakas; they have become spirits because of their great attachment (tanha) for the living or for the goods of the world. Thus they hover about the human habitations they have unwillingly left behind. The typical manner in which these inferior spirits of the ancestors cause illness is by possessing a living person. Both the inferior spirits of the ancestors and demons exemplify Buddhist notions of 'evil'. They possess humans because of attachment (tanha), greed (lobha), anger (krjdha); they thus are embodiments of evil. They have been born in their present states because of their evil karma. Negatively, they are contradictions of Buddhist ideals like dana (giving), sTla (virtue), karuna (compassion), upekha (equanimity). They afflict humans without reason, unlike the Gods of the Sinhalese pantheon who are 'just' gods. From their abode beyond they look upon the human world. There are special times, however, when they are specially active, i.e., when they cast their looks or appear as apparitions. These critical (diacritical) times are known as samayan velava or 'demon time': daybreak, noon, evening and mid- night. Some demons may specially prefer one of these periods to others, as Mahasona favours midnight, and Rtri Yaka, the noon hour. Demons are attracted, specially during the 'demon' times, by various stimuli, e.g., fried foods and meat, blood, nudity or exposing of genitals. Human beings are often made frightened, or attacked, or possessed by demons when they are alone (taniyama). Aloneness is not simply physical aloneness, but</page><page sequence="4">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS 177 psychological aloneness as well. It refers to a state when one's psychological defences are weak. Generally physical aloneness is a precondition, or sets the stage for, psychological aloneness, which produces the demonic attack. Illness produced by demonic attack when a person is 'alone' is called tanikam dosa. Its importance in Sinhalese views regarding the etiology of demonic illness is so great that this term is often used as a synonym for the wider class of misfortunes caused by demons. According to Sinhalese belief there are innumerable demons: these hosts constitute a samagama (a company or unity), and have always to be collectively placated in rituals. Among these theoretically innumer- able demons there are about a dozen major ones who are named. How- ever there are no healing rituals for each of these named demons. There are generally four demons for whom specific, named rituals are performed, these being Riri Yaka (blood demon), Mahasona (great demon of the graveyard), Huniyan Yaka (sorcery demon), and the Sanni demons. The theory is that any ritual should be held under the leadership of one of these four demons. The Sinhalese use the term 'mul karala', i.e., 'under the primacy of X demon'. Though the ritual may be held under the primacy of one of the four demons, most major demons, as stated earlier, have to be propitiated. Alternatively, if the demon causing the illness can be identified unequivocally, one of the standard rituals may be held but in addition a special item involving the demon concerned may be added on to the main ritual. Thus if a woman is afflicted by the sensual demon Kalu Kumaraya (Black Prince), one may perform a sanni ritual, but in addition one may have an image (bali) of Kalu Kumaraya and special invocations and oblations to him. If illness is caused by a mean ancestral spirit, one generally performs a sanni ydkuma (or a ritual for Mahasona) in which a special ritual item-the preta pideni (the oblation to the preta or ancestral spirit)-is added. Sometimes the illness may involve the primacy of two demons in which case there may be a combination of a sanni ydkuma and huniyama ritual, or a mahasona and huniyama ritual. However, there cannot be a combination of a mahasona and a sanni ritual because, according to Sinhalese belief, the two demons are opposed: Sanni Yaka has a noble kshatriya ancestry while Mahasdna belongs to the inferior potter caste. Thus it is not possible to have a ceremony under the primacy of both these demons.' THE RITUAL OF THE SANNI DEMONS: THE INITIAL RITES The sanni ydkuma is a major ritual which is performed if various pre- liminary minor ones known as arakadva (protective charms) have failed. 1 A similar distinction is made between Sanni and Riri Yaka, 'the blood demon'. The former is of royal birth and causes diseases of the right side, while the latter causes diseases of the left side.</page><page sequence="5">178 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE All these minor rites have a sima, i.e., they are effective for a limited period like three days, seven days, one month. If the disease is not cured within the specified period one of the major rituals, like the sanni yikuma, may have to be performed (see Wirz, 1954 for details). It is interesting to note that these minor rituals are viewed as dpa, or 'bail', i.e., a promise made to the demon that a larger ritual in his honour will be held within a certain period if the disease is cured. Yet invariably no such ritual will be held if the minor rituals succeed in curing the disease. The sanni yikuma like all major rituals for persons afflicted with the essence of demons or an inferior ancestral spirit have to do with three things. Most important, the essence of the demon has to be banished from the patient. Secondly, the humours which had been upset owing to the demonic incursion have to be restored to their normal equilibrium. Thirdly, the ritual, in theory at least, has to be conclusive, unlike the tying of a charmed thread, which is temporary. There is a special formula constantly repeated in the rituals which illustrate the permanent, conclu- sive nature of each ritual act: tindui-nivaranai; 'it is done, completed, finished'. These purposes or ends of the ritual do not follow a sequential development in the ritual; they are repeated time and again in the course of the night's proceedings. In this paper I am not concerned with the tech- niques of healing per se. I shall deal with the dramatic aspects of the sanni ydkuma ritual in order to illustrate the symbolic meanings of the ritual drama and its social functions. The drama of the Sanni demons is performed after the midnight watch (mdda ydma). The activities that precede the midnight watch are practically identical for all major healing rituals. The reader is referred to Wirz for details (1954: 27-94). Very briefly what happens at this time is that the ritual arena is purified with fumes of resin and incense; the priests shed their lay clothes, wear 'vestments' (priestly clothes) and purify their inner being by inhaling resin, 'eating' the flames of torches, and 'burning' their bodies with them. At the evening watch (sindd samayama) the demons are asked to cast their eyes on the altars (pideni, mal yahan) and reside in the dancing area or arena. Several rituals are performed between the evening watch and the midnight watch. The most important of these is the 'ritual of the mat'. In this lengthy ritual the priest lies on a mat, invites the demon, Riri Yaka, to consume in essence (kipa ganin) the foods placed on the chest of the priest, and then later, consume the priest himself. At the conclusion of this ritual the mat is folded around the priest (the ancient way of disposing of corpses) and he is taken with cries of weeping and wailing to the nearby bush, i.e., the 'cemetery'. The theory underlying the whole procedure is that the priest has offered a 'life for a life'; his life is given to the demons and they are asked to leave the patient. The striking feature of this ritual, as well as the rituals that precede the entry of the</page><page sequence="6">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS I79 masked sanni demons on stage, is their utter seriousness. Frenzy states, possession, 'fire eating', stylized dancing all occur during this part of the proceedings. The significance of the initial rites performed at the sanni ydkuma should be obvious. A special area is demarcated and bounded, and through rites of consecration and purification declared a sacred area, within a larger profane environment. The sacred area becomes a venue for a special kind of interaction situation: the demons, invisibly present in this area, the patient, the priest, his assistants and drummers, and on the periphery of the sacred area, the assembled audience consisting of relations and friends of the patient and simply curious spectators. I shall examine a few features of this interaction situation; first in relation to the status and role of the priest (ddura) and later the relationship between the demon and the human actors. The problem that is related to the status-role of the priest could be stated as follows. The status of priest (ddura) or 'the priest of the demon cult' (kattadirala), is an achieved one, open to almost all the castes in the society. In fact, however, all the priests of Hinidum Pattu come from low subcastes of the goigama caste (the highest caste in the region), the drum- mer and washerman castes. Thus these ritual specialists have in addition to their priestly statuses several other statuses, most of them low, which they occupy. The sum of statuses ('status set') that goes to constitute a priest's over-all position or rank in society may be low, even though compensated for by the prestige that the status of priest carries. The nature of the cult he specializes in is such that his services are not continuously required, and hence his status-role as priest is not continuously operative. Outside the context of his specialized role activity he is like any other villager of his caste, a bearer of statuses common to others of the group. In normal village life he wears lay clothes and is indistinguishable from the ordinary villager. He is, in this sense, in complete contrast to the Buddhist monk, or Catholic priest whose religious calling requires a permanent status identity which isolates him from the rest of the group. This isolation may be effected by a permanent religious attire or vestment, by physical isolation, etc. Such techniques, as Murphy following Simmel puts it well (1964), create a 'marked social distance'; in this case between the ritual specialist and the rest of the group, dichotomizing the religious from the secular sphere and facilitating the performance of specialized religious roles. In the case of the priest of the demon cults there are no visible symbols of permanent social distance or isolation. When he is not performing his ritual roles he is indistinguishable from the 'common man'. Yet when he is performing a ritual he must transcend his normal status-role. This transcendence is difficult to achieve, for his normal everyday roles pertain to the mundane or worldly sphere whereas his</page><page sequence="7">I80 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE priestly roles pertain to the religious or sacred sphere. Several problems arise at this point. From the priest's own point of view, how does he effect the transference? If most of.the time he is the bearer of ordinary statuses, a performer of ordinary roles and a carrier of the associated 'role-selves', how does he on special occasions put into effective action his status-role as ritual expert, give up his ordinary roles for extraordinary ones, and adopt or put up a new role-self before his (familiar) audience. Again, from the point of view of the human alters he is interacting with, there is another problem. Is it possible for them to forget the priest's other social statuses, to ignore his social person, as Radcliffe-Brown may put it, and view him in isolation in the highly specific context of religious role performance? For the proper performance of the priest role he must be able to command the respect and confidence of his audience. Thus techniques must be available to prevent the public attitudes towards him in the village context from being general- ized into the ritual situation. He must cease to be a villager, often of low status, occupying a niche in the village social structure. There have to be instrumental procedures which effect a role transformation. This is done initially in the ritual through various means. First, he sheds his ordinary lay clothes and wears a vestment, symbolising his priestly status. Second, he is made sacred-a transformation of his physical person through the inhalation of resin and the burning of the body with a torch. Third, through his acts of frenzy and trance states there occurs 'social distancing'. Through these several acts, he has systematically and temporarily shed his normal lay roles which relate him to the audience. In his trance states he is socially removed from the audience, isolated from the mundane world and set apart as a redoubtable being. (The isolation of the priest from his lay roles has a spatial dimension; he is physically confined to the sacred area of the arena. He rarely goes into the house of the patient; his food and refreshments are brought to him.) In the eyes of the public the priest who cannot effect this role metamorphosis is viewed as ritually inferior and does not inspire the same confidence. There cannot be, in such a case, any marked social distance between public and priest. The attitude that the public have towards the priest as a villager is generalized to the context of his role performance in the ritual. When the ritual specialist is a fellow villager, or a person from a village nearby, some role generalization is inevitable. This kind of role generalization can be avoided if one hires a ritual specialist from a distant village with whom one does not interact normally. It is indeed a Sinhalese custom to hire a 'well-known' priest from a 'distant' village when 'serious' rituals have to be performed. In sum, the various procedures adopted in the first part of the sanni yikuma ritual counteract role generalization, and facilitate the performance of the priest role by creating a social distance between priest and audience.</page><page sequence="8">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS i8i THE DRAMATIC REPRESENTATIONS: THE SANNI DEMONS The sanni ritual could be divided into two parts on the basis of the quality of the interaction that occurs in the ritual arena. The first part of the ritual deals with consecration and purification rites, invocations to deities to reside in the arena and the dramatic episode when the priest lies on the mat and offers himself to the demons. After the midnight watch most of the humorous dialogues and ritual dramas take place. The first part is charac- terized by seriousness, and during this period the priest wears his priestly garb and plays his role as priest. The latter part is full of humorous dramatic episodes, and the priest wears a mask or the attire of the demon whom he represents. With the aid of the mask he effaces his earlier role performance as priest. We noted that the activity that precedes the masked entry of the Sanni demons-that is between the evening watch and midnight watch-is standard for all rituals. The major interest of the ritual is, of course, the Sanni Yakku themselves. This part of the ritual commences after the demons have been invoked in the rites performed at the midnight watch, generally between midnight and about two a.m. The priest faces the sanni vTdiye (altar or hut for Sanni, literally 'street of the Sanni') and dances facing it. He then faces in the direction of the patient and dances. With a graceful movement of his hands he performs gestures of obeisance in the direction of the other altars. He now enters the altar for sanni and there sings invocations to the major gods of the pantheon. He asks these gods to reside (vadinna) in the arena. Then he enumerates in song the manner in which the altar hut should be constructed. After this he blesses the audience and the patient with a movement of his hands. A short interval follows. About fifteen minutes later two altars (pidini) for the Sanni demons are brought into the arena and placed on the chair (mal bulat putuva) in front of the patient. A white curtain (kadaturava) is placed before the patient so that he will not see the forthcoming proceedings (but of course will hear them). The priest plants a thin torch (villakku) on each altar. He utters a dishti mantra (essence charm) to get the Sanni to 'reside' in the arena. Then the priest, his assistants and a drummer sing the origin myth of the Sanni demons (sanni upata). Three of these myths on the Sanni demons are quoted below. The first text is a field recording of a long prose invocation known as a kannalavva (plaint). Since this text is not clear it will be quoted only in part. The other two poetic versions of the myth are from the same ritual tradition, but not from the same performer. Their content, known to practically every priest in the region, is also almost identical to that recorded by Paul Wirz (1954: 45-6). Text I: The Birth of Kola Sanniya Two births of the demon, Kola Sanniya, are recounted in this text. Accord-</page><page sequence="9">I82 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE ing to text I, Kola Sanniya was born at the time (or 'dispensation') of Padumuttara, a legendary Buddha of a bygone age. The text describes how the queen of the ruler of Visala became pregnant. The king known as Sankapala suspected adultery and ordered his executioner to take the queen to a cemetery, hang her on a pubberiya tree like a common thief, and then split her body in two. The executioner performed his task as ordered but before the queen died she gave birth to a child who was called Prince Vadakamana (vadaka = torture, i.e., his mother was tortured). Vadakamana gave an eightfold offering (eight essential items prescribed for Buddhist monks) to the Buddha of that age, Padumuttara, and obtained that Buddha's authority (varan: warrant) to destroy the city of Visala. After his death, Vadakamana was reborn in a hell named raurava where he lived for 'twenty thousand sixteen fold and sixfold five years'. Subse- quently he was reborn at the time of Gautama Buddha and it was at this time that he decided to have his revenge on the city of Visala. With a group of eighteen Sanni demons he began to ravage the city. The smells of death and disease attracted other demons also, but the Buddha who was residing at Jetavanarama saw all this with his 'divine eye' and decided to quell the demons. Seeing the disaster in the city of Visala, the Buddha stood (in the sky) about a yoduna (16 miles) above the city and spoke, ' Yanadi butani' (the first words of the famous Pali text, the Ratana Sutta); seeing that the demons were going to fall into mid-ocean and die (because of the power of the text he uttered), he spoke 'Samagatani' (the next word in the Ratana Sutta). The Buddha took a kendi (pitcher) of water in his right hand and a kosamba branch in his left (kosamba has medicinal properties) and chanted the Ruvan Sutara (Sinhalese for Ratana Sutta) and dispelled the yakshas and rakshdsas (demons). Thereafter he called the great sage, Ananda (Buddha's chief disciple) and asked him where these demons now were. He replied: 'My Lord, there is none this side of the four- fold circle of salt water (the sea), but there is a deity with two dead bodies at the four- fold gateway (moat ?).' 'He then is the devata Sanni sunian (siunian = sorcerer)', said the Lord, and spoke the words, 'Yakkantu Bikkantu nena nena vare' (distorted Pali of Sinhalese charms which roughly indicates 'Demon without fail come near the monk'). Then the demon said, 'Ilavve!' (Alas!) and hid underneath some cow dung in the city. Then our Omniscient Exalted King-Teacher-Lord contemplated the Buddha meditation of 'Buddha, Dhammo, Sangho, Triratne' (i.e., the three jewels; the Buddha, the doctrine and monkhood) and spoke 'Come you Kola Yakshaya.' Then the demon Kola knelt on one knee and looked (at the Lord) with one eye. Then our Exalted, Omniscient Teacher-Lord speaks 'Paduna damsala vettu visala puttu kola sanni yakshaya vara vara esvahah' (a spell containing a hodge-podge of Sinhalese, Pali and Tamil roughly meaning, 'The demon Kola sanni I order come come, svaha'). Then the demon saying, 'Alas, three times Alas!' knelt on both knees and assumed the pose of worship with both hands. Then spoke our Omniscient Exalter Teacher-Lord, 'Doer of bad karma (i.e., sinner) what demon are you! Rid yourself of your evil karma. Commit no more sin and be gone from this city'. Then the demon taking three steps forward said, 'Does Your Lordship know who I am and what I am (i.e., how powerful I am)? This city does not belong to Your Lordship. It belongs to me. You begone', and rolling his eyes frowned at our Buddha. Then our Omniscient Exalted Teacher-lord says 'Fly as I say,</page><page sequence="10">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS 183 demon Kola'. Then says the demon, 'I gained this city after making an eightfold offering to the Omniscient Exalted (previous) Buddha named Piyumatura. How can you have the power to punish me as if I were a common visitor (to this city)? Saying thus he sent eighteen fevers up eighteen riyanas (24 feet); this was like a wind in the hot season. Then our Omniscient Exalted King, Teacher-lord, emanated a single glittering ray and when its heat engulfed and began to burn the demon from head to foot, he said: 'Your Lordship please do not destroy me. I would come or go as you order me, even after five thousand years and even though it is the era of Kali (Kaliyuga, the present evil age), if you command me to come I'll come and if you command me to go, I'll go, if you command me to cure sickness I'll do so, if you ask me to intensify sicknesses I'll do that also'. Then our Buddha obtained from Sakra (the King of the Gods) a handful of sweet smelling 'El rice' asked a priest named Yama to place at the gateway of his teeth (danta) a parcel of rice and ordered that this offering of rice be accepted as a sacrifice in the name of the future Buddhas. (Now the priest speaks to Kola Sanniya present in the arena in his essence) 'By the power of this binding order even today you Kola Sanni demon followed by your retinue of Pisachas, Vetalas and Kumbandas (inferior spirits) cast your dishti from the eight cardinal directions, from the right and left sides of this altar (vidiya), and at this recital of your birth story come, come with your following with your dishti falling on all sides....' The following verse texts give more details about Kola Sanniya. According to these texts also he was born at two periods. His first birth was in the city of Visala, and the story is pretty much the same as the preceding one except that the Buddha of the period was another legendary Buddha known as Dipankara. The Buddha Dipankara, according to other texts in my possession, but not translated here, quelled the demon by the power of his magic in almost the same manner as Gautama of Text I. Subse- quently, according to these texts the demon was reborn in the time of the Buddha of our own age, Gautama. Both Dipankara and Gautama quelled the demon by reciting the famous Pali text, the Ratana Sutta, except that Dipankara utters charms and spells like any village priest, whereas Gautama behaves with considerably more decorum! The significance of attributing similar actions to two Buddhas (legendary and 'historical') will be interpreted later on. Text II: Birth of the Sanni Demons (Sanni upata) Oh God Ishvara ruling over mortals, I shall compose songs and worship you That you may banish the woes (vipat) of mortals I shall sing the birth of the Sanni demons. At the beginning of this kalpa, on this earth Soon after the beginning of the human race Tempted by the beauty of a princess of Aryan gotra (ariyagot) A beam from the sun entered her and she conceived. Thus the womb of the princess was polluted (kill, polluted, i.e., conceived) Thus foetus in her was a fleshy mass, Ten months gradually passed by, She gave birth to a mass of flesh.</page><page sequence="11">184 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE The assembled people were alarmed, 'A horrible calamity portents for the world' (they said). They placed the mass of flesh in a leaden pot, They floated it down the river. At that time, by the river, the Bodisatva (the Buddha in a past birth) Was meditating as an ascetic with compassion for all mankind When he saw it floating on the water Removed the foetus (daru-biju, lit. child-egg) which was concealed. He kept it in his care for a week, Then when he looked he saw two children. They were sucking their thumbs happily These thumb-sucking children did he see. He saw the children and loved them. He took them to an inhabited village He gave them the clan name of Lichavi He left them in the care of the village head (ganpati). The two children born in this manner Grew in beauty like the waxing moon. One day the people assembled together They held a grand wedding for these two. They held a grand wedding in the middle of Visal forest With all the festive custom of the time. The people held several processions, They provided these two with male and female servants. From them were born the people of Lichavi Blessed with countless years of life. They multiplied greatly, they were beautiful Such were the people (gotra) of Lichavi. Oh Lichavi people blooming with greatness, They knew not death and decay They spent their days in love and happiness Till their old evil karma caught up with them. Sankapala, a great king of the Lichavis, Married a beautiful princess. Constantly affectionate he lived with her -We shall recount how she conceived. The king did not know she was pregnant. He fought in a far country and returned victorious, To his palace he returned victorious But he saw the pregnant queen and was wroth. The king was angry at the foetus-which he had created- 'If you do not inform me what happened here I shall torture you cruelly and put you to death', Thus he told the maids whom he summoned.</page><page sequence="12">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS I85 One maid invented a cruel lie, 'The very day you left for the wars She fell in love with the chief minister And lay in the beautiful bed together'. The king's anger flared forth like fire: 'I don't want to see her ever again Take her to the cemetery and on a kiiballa tree Hang her and split her body in two.' The hangman (lit. torturer) heard the king's command He held the Queen by her hands, dragged her along; He tortured her continually and hung her on the tree and Cut her in two with one part hanging on the tree. The powerful prince lying in that womb Fell down, but the parts united again. Not the least bit weary he stood up. Thus the powerful chiefly demon was born. He grew up feeding on his mother's corpse. He took various dreadful guises. 'I will destroy the cruel king my father All humans I see I'll tear apart'. He hoped to kill the king with poisons He collected poisons from the forest In the ancient manner he ground them into lumps Holding these lumps he charmed them. The eighteen lumps that he had made Changed into eighteen powerful demons. The eighteen demons stood up in three lines Waiting for warrant (varan, permission) for the demon dance. 'What warrant do you want? What warrant should I give you? Capture humans and cause illness through wind, phlegm and bile; I'll give you warrant to enter the city of Visal and destroy the Lichavis'. 'Let us go', said the nineteen demons and leapt into the city of Visal. Shouting deathly cries they ran into Visal city. Wearing the guise of death he (i.e. Kola Sanniya) entered the king's palace: 'You listened to falsehoods and you slew my mother From today Death will stalk your citizens'. Thus he said and he broke the king's neck. He ate the king's flesh and drank his blood, He looked for all the humans hiding in the palace, Having drunk their blood he went into the city. Thousands daily they used to kill and eat; The stench of dead bodies spread wide and far; Hosts of pretas invaded the city of Visal Pestilence spread over the whole city.

Text III: The Conquest of Kola Sanniya by Gautama Buddha When the Buddha was preaching And living at Jetavanarama In order to cure The deadly pestilence in Visala He concentrated his mind And saw with his divine eye (lit. mind eye) Demons all assembled Devouring humans Eating bones in heaps. These he saw and The Lord of all World compassionately Summoned his chief disciples And told them, When you take pirit water (to Visala) The power of the demons will be quelled. The chief disciples then took The pot of water given by the Buddha Travelled across the sky to Visal city The power of the demons vanished. The Buddha saw with his divine eye That the demons were running frightened (owing to the pirit water) And thought it would be good To banish the smell of death- To clean the city To wash the city of Visal. God Sakra (sensed the Buddha's wish and) arrived. 'You run to Visal City Create a great rain To clean the city' (the Buddha ordered Sakra). Sakra obeyed His words. In order to bring rain He raised black clouds Like a roaring stream. The rain washed the city. The rotting corpses were washed away Into the mid-ocean; (and) The city was cleansed. The people of the city Who had cringed with fear Decided to listen to pirit To banish their fear of demons. They constructed a large pavilion; With silks they ornamented it Canopies above,</page><page sequence="14">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS 187 And frills on the sides, Pots full of pure water, (Artificial) trees of flowers Curtains all around Beautiful paintings, Sandal and dewy water And sweet smelling kunkuma And various scents -All these were collected. All the people of Visal then Observed the Five Precepts They assembled in a mass And went to Jetavanarama Saw the Buddha there. They worshipped his blessed feet. 'Have pity on us', They fell on the floor And pleaded with him. That day our Lord With great compassion for them Together with his arhats Got ready to depart. The Buddha's rays spread in all directions The whole earth shone with splendor. The people conducted them with great pomp To the city of Visal. Pirit was recited from the 'Jewel Sutta' (Sinhalese, Ruvan Sutura; Pali, Ratana Sutta) The minds of the demons Were struck with fear. Today too by the power of that pirit We'll banish the demons The diseases of this patient We'll banish from the root We'll give him long life and protection Power and youthfulness.... The Gods had been invoked sometime back and now they are present (in their essence or dishti) in the arena. The Sanni demons and the other major demons are also present in this unique interaction situation between men and the deities. The origin myth of the Sanni demon has been sung and the time has come for him to be represented physically in the arena. This initial representation of the Sanni demon occurs in the next rite known as the dolaha pelapaliya. The world dolaha means 'twelve' and paliya is 'act or spectacle', and pela is 'string, row, or series'. However the complete phrase does not mean 'a series of twelve acts' but rather 'a series of acts or spectacles for the Twelve (gods)'. These 'spectacles' are also per- formed by priests in other Sinhalese rituals like the gammaluva, a com- munal ritual for the major gods of the pantheon. In the sanni ritual how- ever these spectacles in honour of the assembled gods are performed by the</page><page sequence="15">i88 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE Sanni demons themselves in various guises or apparitions. Its significance will be discussed later in my interpretation of the ritual. The pelapali are generally performed by the priest's assistants who initially appear in the arena dressed in 'royal' clothes as befits the royal ancestry of the Sanni demon(s). They dance and recount their origin and ancestry. Then commence the pelapali proper soon after three a.m. Eight pali or acts are performed; each act is performed by an assistant who enters the arena in one of the guises of Sanni Yaka. Each act has a stereo- typed technique. The entry of the demon is heralded by a song sung by the priest and drummer, specifying the act to be performed. Then Sanni Yaka in one of his guises appears, carries on a comic dialogue with the drummer, performs the acts in honour of the gods, blesses the patient and departs into the altar hut. The eight pali are generally as follows: (1) pandam pali, 'spectacle of the torches' where the gods are honoured and the patient blessed with torches; (2) salu pdliya, 'spectacle of the shawls' where the gods are fanned with shawls and the patient blessed with them; (3) kendi pdliya, 'the spectacle of the water pot' where the altars of the gods are lustrated with turmeric water and the patient blessed and 'cleansed' with it; (4) male pdliya, 'the spectacle of the coconut flower'; (5) muguru pdliya, 'the spectacle with the sticks' i.e., the stick dance. (6) tdnbili paliya, 'the spectacle of the red coconut', where the demon dances with a red coco- nut (tdmbili) before the altar of the gods; (7) dalumura pdliya, 'spectacle of betel leaves', where betel leaves are offered to the gods; and finally (8) su- vandapadliya, 'the spectacle of incense', where incense is offered to the gods. I shall not give examples of the songs and humorous dialogue between the demon and the drummer because this type of comic dialogue will be amply documented in the latter part of this paper. Immediately after the dolaha pelapaliya an act known as the aturu paliya (extra spectacle) or bille paliya (sacrifice-spectacle) is performed. The atura paliya or 'extra act' is a kind of diacritical act between the dolaha pelapaliya on the one hand and the arrival of the eighteen masked Sanni (dahaata pelapaliya) that follows. The 'extra act' is a brief but exciting performance. A demon wearing a black jacket, black 'coat' and 'trousers', black hat, his face and arms all coated with soot, enters the arena hooting and shrieking. He dances for a while and suddenly without warning throws apart the white curtain (kadaturava) that had separated the patient from the preceding events and jumps at the patient as if to devour him. The patient gets a sudden shock; sometimes he shouts in alarm and always a startled reaction takes place. Even the audience is startled and there is a brief spell of silence. Aturu yaka departs as suddenly as he arrived. After the 'special act' there commences the main item of the ritual, which is the representation of the eighteen Sanni demons and that of their</page><page sequence="16">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS I89 leader the Sanni Yaka or Kola Sanniya. This ritual drama is known as the dahaata pelapaliya, 'the series of spectacles of the eighteen (demons)'. The eighteen demons are created by the Sanni Yaka who is known as the Raja Maha Kola Sanniya (the Great, Royal, Comic Sanni demon). They are also manifestations of Kola Sanniya, personifications of the various disease symptoms he creates. There is no uniform list of the eighteen Sanni on which all ritual specialists in Ceylon agree, though there is a great deal of overlap. My impression is that about twelve of the Sanni demons are common to every list I have seen. The list given below is from one ritual specialist in Hiniduma; Wirz has a slightly different list. Name of Sanni demon 1. bita sanniya 2. buta sanniya 3. abuta sanniya 4. olmdda sanniya 5. kala sanniya 6. jala sanniya 7. deva sanniya 8. demala sanniya 9. ncga sanniya 10. bihiri sanniya 11. maru sanniya 12. vata sanniya 13. avulun sanniya 14. vevulum 15. gulma 16. vedi sanniya 17. kana sanniya 18. gini sanniya Major symptom of patient afflicted by demon obscenities, confused behaviour, timidity (bita-timid) nonsensical talk or valbuta humorous nonsensical talk or kolam babbling patient cannot eat, gets thin excess of phlegm, dysentery (jala-water) sees beautiful people in dreams, a sign of disease performs pranks and utters nonsense that sounds like Tamil (demala) sees snakes in dreams diseases of the ear (bihiri-deaf) deliriums rheumatism, stiff joints difficulty in breathing, pains in chest shivering diarrhea, vomiting, inability to eat food, nausea sees guns and shooting in dreams difficulty in seeing (kana-blind) excess of heat, bilious diseases All these demons and their symptoms unite in their chief, Kola Sanniya, who is the last to enter the arena. It is rare for all eighteen demons to be represented in the dahaata pela- pdliya. The stipulated reason is lack of time, for the chief of the Sanni, Kola Sanniya, must arrive in the arena, perform his drama and depart be- fore the break of dawn. Thus in average rituals only six or seven of the Sanni appear 'on stage'. The rest are however mentioned in the songs sung by the priest, or one of his assistants, and the drummer. The entry and departure of the Sanni are highly conventionalized. The priests and his assistants may take their turn in the impersonations of the Sanni. Each Sanni, wearing a mask or a garb appropriate to the demon he represents, enters the arena from the altar-hut (sanni vTdiya). Drums beat and one of the priests utters a few songs describing the Sanni and indicating his entry into the arena, The demon performs a comic act, often coming near the patient and em- barrassing him with lewd gestures or obscenities.</page><page sequence="17">190 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE Let me illustrate briefly a few of these comic acts. For example, Bita Sanniya enters the arena carrying two bundles of leaves and indiscrimin- ately utters lines from various songs. He acts like a person who is utterly confused. He sees a cat but thinks it is a buffalo; he mistakes pus for curd. He says he wants to say his prayers. This he does by 'brushing' his teeth, holding his ears and saying 'Allah, Allah ve allah!' He falls on the ground in Muslim-type worship. He says 'I believe in the Buddha's teachings; the dhoby taught it to me. What does a monk know anyway'. He utters Buddhist prayers which happen to be gibberish; he gives them crazy inter- pretations. He chants: 'Om namo! Egoda golde ridi (the washerwoman from the upper side of the village), mego.da gode ridi (the washerwoman from the lower side). The ridi (washerwoman) urinated by the power of this prayer'. Similarly Amukka Sanniya enters the arena and vomits; then eats the stuff. Jala Sanniya has diarrhea and utters scatalogical obscenities. After each act the demon comes to the patient and says 'tmndui nivaranai' (it is done, finished), i.e., by this act the symptoms represented by that particular Sanni have left the patient. The demon leaves the arena: the departure of the demon is an indication that the symptom he represents has left the patient. Six or seven Sanni demons appear and depart in this manner. Finally the priest and drummer sing songs about the demons who cannot be represented on stage-they are considered as if they are present on the arena. After the eighteen demons have left the arena the patient puts flowers, betel leaves, lime, coins (pan.duru) into the two pideni on the chair. These auspicious offerings are a gift to the demons for having left the patient. Then the patient keeps both his hands over his head and brings them downwards to the altars three times, each time uttering the formula tindui nivaranai. The significance of this act is explained by the priest in his chant. He says the r6ga (illnesses) and dosa (upset humours, troubles) of the patient are over (tfndui). One of the assistants takes the two pideni and places it on the kapala kuduva, the revolving altar which contains the offerings for the Sanni. The climax of the ritual is the entry into the arena at about five in the morning of Kola Sanniya himself, in whom is coalesced and united all the preceding demons. He has a standard mask with three snake-hoods, a crown made of banana bark, also serving as an altar for offerings later given by the patient; a square frame of banana bark round his waist also serving as a pideni; and two small pideni for his hands; the last item is kept in the kapala k.duva and used only when the occasion demands. Leaves and branches hang from his waist. I shall present in detail an almost verbatim account of the ritual drama of Kola Sanniya from one of my tape record- ings. Two persons drawn from the audience stand holding two pestles, in the manner of a barrier. These pestles represent the kadavata (city gates,</page><page sequence="18">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS I9I gates to any province or region). The two persons represent two leading guardian gods of the Sinhalese pantheon. Behind the symbolic city gates the patient sits on a mat: a ka.daturava or curtain covers the patient. The priest in the guise of Kola Sanniya enters the arena. The curtain is lifted and the patient sees the demon. Drums beat as he enters the arena back first. Then he turns around and carries on the usual dialogue with the drummer. Kola Sanniya wants to know from the drummer the names of persons at the city gates. D.: Yes there are certain signs (lakuna) at the city gates. K.S.: Who is on the east side of the city gates? D.: The King of the Gods is on the East. K.S.: Who is on the right of the city gates? D.: The God Vishnu. In this manner other major gods of the pantheon-Nata, Kataragama, Pattini-are listed as guarding the 'city gates'. The power of the twenty- four Buddhas resides there. Kola Sanniya now bursts into song: Who guards the Eastern side of the city gates ? The king of the Gods resides in the city gates. Who bars the way, not allowing me to enter Open the ka4avata (city gate) and let the Sanni pass. Now Kola Sanniya struts in a dance up to the pestles symbolizing the city gates. He goes up to one guard who at this point represents the God Vishnu. He tries to go past the city gates but to no avail. He comes back to the drummer and tells him that he was asked to leave by the 'guard'. K.S. (Song): Who guards the right side of the city gates? The God Vishnu resides in the city gates. Who bars the way, not allowing me to enter? Open the city gates and let the Sanni pass. Who guards the left side of the city gates? The God Nata resides in the city gates. Who bars the way, not allowing me to enter ? Open the city gates and let the Sanni pass. Who guards the Western side of the city gates? The God Kataragama resides in the city gates. Who bars the way, not allowing me to enter? Open the city gates and let the Sanni pass. The same text can be used for other major deities of the pantheon like Saman and Vibisana. The number of deities mentioned depends, as always, on the availability of time. Each time Kola Sanniya tries to get past the city gates the deities impassively hold fast the barrier. Kola Sanniya in feigned frustration comes back to the drummer.</page><page sequence="19">192 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE K.S. (Song): Look at these two fellows here With their shrunken buttocks, their bellies bulging; They are dirty tricksters guarding the city gates You cheats, you scoundrels, clear out of here. Oh pot-bellied rascals guarding the city gates, Notorious rogues, eating stale food from house to house, Oh rogues guarding the entrance to the city gates, Let me enter you 'stale-food-eating' rogues. Oh stale-food-eaters guarding the city gates, Going from house to house eating stale food, The bastard sons of an untouchable beggar (rodiya) from Magama, Let me pass, you stale food-eaters. At the end of each stanza he dances up to the city gates, but the imper- turbable deities block his path. K.S.: Say, what is wrong with them they are haraha vela (lying across). D.: Not haraha vela but taraha vela (angry). K.S.: Hey fellow (ane maha yodayo, lit. Oh big giant), these two chaps want me to address them as hamudoruvo (lord) and mahatmaya (gentleman). How can I? This chap (running up to Vishnu and jabbing his stomach) is like that 'big fatty' at Kohilagolle (a village). Ha! Ha! And this other fellow (pointing at the other deity), well I've seen him before in the district of Giruva Pattuva (in South Ceylon). He was carrying a long knife and a bundle of clothes. I asked him where he was going. He said he'll tell me if I won't tell anyone else. He went to Kakulkuna's (rotten legs) house, Heavens! (hat illavve!) he must be the adulterous visitor at the house of the woman with rotten legs (i.e. syphilis). Look, look, these two chaps are shivering. D.: They aren't shivering, they're mad at you. They say they want some kind of food. K.S.: Is that so. I thought they were afraid of me. D.: No, their stomachs (ba.da) ache with hunger. K.S.: True, there are cobwebs around their mouths. Looks as if they haven't had a meal since last night. D.: This won't do at all. They say you must look around and bring them some nice things. K.S.: Look around? D.: Yes, give them something for their hunger, cajole them (ravatanna). K.S. (Song): Listen, I'll plead with you two kindly, I want to know what I should bring you, Don't feel shy, I'll not tell anyone, Speak softly into my ear O soldiers. K.S.: Hey fellow, these two chaps say they want flesh of the eel (anda malu). D.: Not dnda mdlu but ana malu (a variety of banana). They want banana. K.S.: Is that so. (Song): I know all sorts of tricks and pranks, I watch these proud fellows at the city gates. O soldiers who wanted me to bring them things Eat these two bananas I've brought you. (Words like 'soldier', 'guards', are terms of insult.)</page><page sequence="20">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS I93 Kola Sanniya collects two bananas (ana malu) from one of the baskets placed near the altar hut. He struts up to the deities represented by the two members of the audience and tries to 'feed' them by thrusting the banana at their various orifices-anus, mouth, ears. The gods stay impassively. He comes back to the drummer. K.S.: These chaps won't eat the stuff. D.: Of course not. They say that you must go to Devundara (southern tip of Ceylon where the main shrine of Vishnu is located) and bring some large kdvun (kdvun is a festive and ritual food made of dough and fried in oil. It has a protrusion in the middle known as the 'navel' or buriya. Its shape sculpturally is like the conjunction of penis and vagina). K.S.: Nonsense. I can't go all the way to Devundara for these two people. D.: It has to be done. K.S.: So I'll go there. (In a dance he imitates going to Devundara. He comes back with kdvun and goes up to the drummer.) He sings. Devundara is where god Vishnu landed; The Buddha he walked on seven flowers (at the time of his birth) Along with the others they guard the city gates here, Eat kdvun and open the city gates. I have taken two kdvun in my hand, Look! they are like two blossoms, Eat these kindly, and don't be annoyed, Eat the kdvun and open the city gates. K.S.: The stuff looks good, I like to eat the navel (buriya). (Kola Sanniya goes up to the gods and tries to look at their navels. He thrusts the kdvun into their orifices. He comes back.) D.: Those two want to know why the kdvun is light (lit. white) in colour. K.S.: That's because the treacle used is not of the best. The trouble I had in getting good treacle! I looked all over the place-even Colombo. At last I saw some treacle in the spittoon under the village priest's bed.... D.: This won't do at all. K.S.: Why? They want something else? Maybe they want gevala pudi (spoonerism for puvalu gedi, a variety of banana). Kola Sanniya goes out in a dance to search for this banana. He sings. I looked all over and found them at last But I can't remember exactly what you wanted Don't misunderstand me my friends But eat these, they're such nice bananas. Kola Sanniya has two bananas in his hands. He fondles them lasciviously. He spits into them, he says to 'contaminate them' (indul karanava). He goes up to the gods and thrusts a puvalu in their mouths, but the gods are not tempted. They stare at Kola Sanniya stiffly. D.: They don't seem to like the stuff. They want appa (a breakfast food like a round crepe; also in vulgar parlance used for vagina). K.S.: Dammit! dppa? Where can I get crepe at this time? D.: From the shop of course. K.S. (Song and dance):</page><page sequence="21">I94 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE Having stolen all sorts of things from shops I collected them and tied them up nicely; I saluted everyone there saying 'father's younger brother' (bappe); Open the city gates and eat the crepe I've brought. K.S.: They refuse to eat? One chap says ap and the other says pa (ap and pa = appa). D.: Not ap-pa, but ep-pa (take it back). They don't seem to like it. Maybe another kind of food is required. Song and dance as Kola Sanniya goes in search of another favorite sweet, asvada. For a long time those two have been full of rotten greed The stuff from the washerman's house is good enough for them. Hey! You have stayed long enough embracing the city gates! Here are some sweets, open the city gates. The gods again refuse to eat food brought from the low-caste washer- man's house, in spite of the food being thrust at them. K.S.: They refuse to eat. My fault for having told them from where I got the food. D.: Sure they won't eat. They say they have two wives and many children.... K.S.: Dammit, do they expect me to bring up their children. D.: No, they want a basket load (kada) of sweetmeats. K.S.: Is that so? Why don't they go and get it themselves? D.: They refuse. K.S.: Then I'll have to go, I guess. A basket containing sinipittu and atirasa (sweetmeats) Vellavdhun (pancake with sweet stuffing) and all other sweetmeats Eat all this and forget your annoyance Eat these and open the city gates. Kola Sanniya carries two baskets in his hands and gives them to the gods who brush him aside. He looks puzzled. He comes back, as usual, and addresses the drummer. K.S.: I took it to them but they refuse to eat. D.: Well let us see what you have in your basket. K.S.: Do I have to do that? Well, lots of nice things here ... a potfull of yaws, a pot of toddy, a potfull of feces. D.: That stuff is no good. K.S.: Why? Now is it true that these two chaps are getting married soon. If so I've got here a menorraghia (lemale) and some hepatitis (sengemale). D.: But these are diseases. K.S.: Really...? D.: No, none of this would do. You now have to dance and say 'may you live long' (ayuboveva, a salutation). K.S.: I'll dance and bribe them with it. (Song): Oh Lord Vesamuni, king of the demons I have no more words to bribe them (the gods) with This is due to the sins of my past births Look at these dances and open the city gates. Kola Sanniya performs some awkward dances. Then he turns his back on</page><page sequence="22">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS I95 the deities, pushes out his buttocks and approaches them, back first. He collides on each of the deities. D.: You don't salute people with your arse. No wonder they defy you. They defy you to go through, and scorn your might. K.S.: (bragging tones) I'll show them I am Kola Sanniya. (He approaches the gods who turn aside. He shouts aloud.) I am Lord Kola Sanniya. If you won't let me past the city gates I'll kill you and cut you into small pieces with my sword. (Song): Listen old fellow guarding the city gates I'll destroy the city gates and go past! I won't allow you to escape either I'll slash the city gates with my sword. Kola Sanniya dances with sword (made of banana bark) in hand. He slashes the symbolic city gates (i.e. the pestles) with his sword. His sword breaks. He comes up to the drummer crestfallen. K.S.: What kind of city gates are these; it's more like a guard stone. D.: (speaking on behalf of the gods) These tricks won't work. They say you must go to the Jetavanaramaya where the Buddha resides... K.S.: (interrupting, startled) No, no, I can't go there. D.: No you must ... and get permission, warrant (varan) from the Buddha. K.S.: All right. I'll worship the Buddha and bring a letter of authority (sannasa). (Song): He goes to the assembly of Gods and worships them. He gets permission (varan) from thepase Buddha (Pali,pacceka Buddha).' (May the command of the twenty-four Buddhas last!) He brings the first letter of authority (sannasa) with his foot. Kola Sanniya holds a 'letter' (a piece of coconut leaf) between his toes. He hops towards the deities guarding the 'city gates' and places his foot on each one of them. They are visibly angry. K.S.: (innocently) What's wrong now? D.: You brought it with your feet. You should place it on your head. (Song): He (the Buddha) saw all these falsehoods enacted, He burned the demon with rays powerful. The demon runs shivering in fright; Yet, the second time too it was a hoax. Kola Sanniya comes dancing up to the deities. This time he comes hopping with the letter of authority tied on his knee. The deities push him aside. K.S.: Hey fellow, I went to the Jetavanaramaya. D.: Did you see the Buddha? K.S.: Of course I saw him. I saw the Buddha in a cave by the paddy field lying down eating venison.... There were budu pdtau (Buddha's litter) also crying 'chin- chin'. There were lumps here and there and also a long thing at the back. (This is of course a real insult to the Buddha who abstains from meat entirely and is continent. Actually Kola Sanniya has seen a leopardess, its litter, feces and tail. Since the leopardess is yellow he identifies it with the yellow-robed Buddha.) 1 Pase Buddha-a Buddha who lives by himself and does not spread or preach the doctrine to others.</page><page sequence="23">I96 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE D.: Is that so? It must have been a leopard. K.S.: Well, no more of these false illusions. Let me go and bring the third letter of authority. (Song): I first worship the assembly of the Gods I listen to the command of Makkama Muni (Buddha viewed as Lord of Mecca!). I invoke the four gods residing here The third letter I bring on my head. Look at the letter of the city gates See if our Lord's signature is on it. Read the letter carefully, Read it and open the city gates. Kola Sanniya comes into the middle of the arena. He shivers, snores, cries-trembles-the power of Buddha's rays (budu rds) have burnt him. But Kola Sanniya still tries to avoid reading the letter of authority. D.: Now you can read the letter. K.S.: You read it. D.: I would like to but I am not literate! Kola Sanniya attempts to read the letter of authority several times. He speaks unfavorably of the Buddha's handwriting; then he says that the letter reads that 'the organizers of this ritual should be bound and thrown into a well'. Again, he reads that the priest should be given nice things to eat. Now he attempts to clean the letter with his saliva saying that the letter is full of soot. The Gods now insist that he read it correctly. Kila Sanniya cries and stammers. K.S.: Our Lord Buddha who is great, great, gr-r-eat, grr- (the words stick in his throat). No use stalling any more. Let me read. He now reads the Buddha's order. 'The Great Lord, Our Buddha says, according to this letter of authority, that the devata Kola Sanniya has come here at the break of dawn. Give this mean ancestral spirit (preta), this mean one, seven bags of rice and seven bags of food, burn him with the rays of the Buddha, chase him beyond seven villages, beyond the seven bounds of villages'. All the dosas (misfortunes, upset humours) are nivdranai-tindui, tindui (over, finished). Note that the Buddha calls Kola Sanniya a devata (noble deity) because of his royal birth and later calls him preta because he is a sinner. By now Kola Sanniya has accepted the supremacy of the Buddha and therefore the gods open the city gates. The city gates are now open and Kola Sanniya goes past. He then comes back to the patient and sings various songs. Listen to the marks (or signs, lakunu, i.e., the manner of construction) of the pideni of the head. Measure one span and three inches Include four compartments (tattu) in it Take offerings of rice (bat dola) for the pideni of the head.</page><page sequence="24">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS 197 The patient puts flowers, betel leaves, rice, limes, coins, rose water, hair ash, thread from a cloth, phlegm and snot into the pideni (altar) which Kola Sanniya carries in his hand.' Kola Sanniya then blesses the patient and sings: Listen to the marks of the two pideni for the hands: Measure one span and one inch Include only one compartment (ta.tt) in it Take offerings of rice for the pideni of the two hands. Listen to the marks of the pideni of the waist: Measure three spans and three inches Include four compartments in it Take offerings of rice for the pideni at the waist. Like a piece of butter that is melted, Like gun powder thrown at a flame, In order to banish the darkness of disease (roga) Take coins (pan.duru) and depart immediately, O Sanni. The birth (upata, i.e., origin) of limes was in the world of nigas (It) grew in the city of Kusinara. May the misfortune (dosa) descend from the head to the feet Take limes and give release from the illness. With one leap he (Sanni) reached the city of Visal. He asked permission (varan) from Raja Vesamuni (King of the demons) on that occasion. The powerful Gautama Muni gave permission to him There! take the limes and the Sanni will be gone for good (nivdranai). Take the golden water pot in the hand. When the water is sprayed the misfortune will sink. Hereafter there will be no infertility here, Give the flower water (mal pan, little bottles of rose water) and obtain release from the illness. Our teachers were versed in all the arts, They taught us these arts generously; We invoke the command of the Great Muni. Give phlegm-snot (sema-sotu) and obtain release from disease. The dawn (sun) is about to break, alas (illavve)! The moon is about to leave, alas! The demons have departed helter-skelter, alas! The Kola Sanni demon departs, alas! INTERPRETATIONS The Eighteen Collective Representations Who are the eighteen Sanni demons and what do they represent? First, it is obvious that they represent symptoms of certain diseases, either mental 1 The foods given to Kola Sanniya are a combination of pure and impure foods, symbolizing his dual status as both prince and demon.</page><page sequence="25">198 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE or physical or both. There also seems to be no uniform list of these symptoms. Second, not all the Sanni demons are equally important, but the ones that enter the arena always express comic, ludicrous, bizarre behaviour. Third, all the different Sanni demons are united in Kola Sanniya who has thus a 'pantheistic' character. If each demon represents a certain symptom, then Kola Sanniya, the 'pantheistic' demon, perhaps represents a central disease entity of which the rest are only aspects; or alternatively, he represents the 'cause' of all these symptoms. What then more specifically do the demon Kola Sanniya and his associates represent? We will advance comparative and etymological evidence which will throw light on the nature and evolution of the Sanni demons. In popular Sinhalese physical medicine the term sanni refers to delirious states and convulsions. The term sanni we believe is derived from the Sanskrit, san-ni-pita (lit., getting together, collapse, encounter). In Sans- krit (Ayurvedic) medicine, as well as in Sinhalese usage, san-ni-pata (Sin- halese, sannipata) refers to the upsetting of all three dosas or humours in the human body and hence the cause of the most serious of all illnesses. These illnesses are generally fevers (jwara) and the term sanni-pata jwara frequently appears in both Sinhalese ritual and in Ayurvedic literature. Could then the Sinhalese term, sanni, refer to the various types of illness or fevers (jwara) produced by the upsetting of the three humours? This view, however, meets with a serious linguistic objection for according to the normal rules of the Sinhalese language one cannot elide pata from the Sanskrit san-ni-pata and simply form a new noun from the two Sanskrit prefixes san-ni. While such a derivation is, according to formal usage, impossible, nevertheless such derivations are not impossible through folk etymological processes. Yet none of the scholars I consulted could give me another similar case in Sinhalese. Therefore, it seemed reasonable to conclude that the term was derived only indirectly from Sanskrit, through diffusion, like many other aspects of popular Sinhalese culture. A clue is available in the ritual which sometimes refers to Kola Sanniya as Demala Maha Kola Sanniya. Demala in Sinhalese means specifically 'Tamil' and more generally 'South Indian'. The Tamil dictionary (1936) gives the following meaning of sanni. channy: noun, from the Sanskrit san-ni-pata. Diseases resulting from the disturbed condition of the three bodily humours, thirteen in number. The dictionary goes on to state that the term sanni or canni is a tadhbhava from the Sanskrit san-ni-pata, i.e., the Sanskrit word is modified owing to the lack of corresponding sounds in the borrowing language. The classification of these diseases into thirteen is in turn derived from the Sanskrit medical text of Dhanvantari. Several inferences could be drawn at this point. (a) The term sanni may</page><page sequence="26">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS 199 have been derived indirectly from the Tamil source rather than the Sans- krit. (b) The number thirteen is both South Indian and Sanskrit classifica- tion of the fevers which result from san-ni-pata. The Tamil dictionary lists the thirteen sanni diseases; but references to over a dozen other sannis were found scattered in the Tamil dictionary. We could not get the Sinhalese number eighteen from Tamil sources, but in one Tamil text, Agastya Vahanan ('Vehicle of the Sage Agastya'), five extra sannis are recorded: marama channy (tetanus ?); amirta channy (hypertensive encephelopathy ?); mukavatha channy (facial paralysis ?); chirasu channy (delirium due to non- infective cerebral disease?); and chuka channy (delirious mania ?).1 On the assumption that a great deal of Sinhalese magic and ritual diffused from Kerala (an assumption which cannot be spelled out here), we looked at Malayalam sources. Dr. Gundert's Malayalam dictionary listed eighteen sanni; moreover the number eighteen is not derived from a Sanskrit source but from a prose medical text written in Malayalam (Gundert, 1872: 1035). Though we could not locate the medical treatise referred to by Gundert, we were able to locate references to eighteen sanni, and the use of eighteen as a standard number in several Malayalam sources. The Malayalam work Sahasrayooga has a list of eighteen, thirteen of which are diseases produced by san-ni-pata and partially duplicated in the Tamil list while five are pyrexias caused also by the upsetting of the three humours.2 Therefore, from the evidence advanced above it seems reason- able to infer that the notion of eighteen sanni in the Sinhalese texts is derived from a South Indian source, probably from Malayalam. Relevant to my thesis is the fact that in Malayalam, eighteen is a standard number used in classifying various other types of illness also. For example, there are eighteen types of unmada (lunacy) and eighteen types of apasmara (epilepsy) according to a list in a medical treatise.3 According to this treatise nos. 15, 16, 17 of the lunacies (unmada) refer to humoral excess from 1 I am greatly indebted to Professor V. I. Subramaniam Pillai and Sri P. Ramachandran Pillai of the University of Kerala, Department of Linguistics, for information on South Indian references to Sanni. 2 These are: (1) sandika sanny (rheumatic fever); (2) anthaka sanny (acute sinusitis); (3) rugdaha sanny (lung abscess); (4) chitha vibhrama sanny (erysipelas); (5) seethamgasanny (coma in cholera); (6) thandrika sanny (delirium due to toxemia from general infections with thrush); (7) kantakubjaka sanny (quinsy); (8) karnaka sanny (acute mastoiditis); (9) bhugna nethraka sanny (empyema of the accessory nasal sinuses); (10) rakthashteevaka sanny (pem- phigus); (11) pralapa sanny (delirium due to infections of the nervous system); (12) jihwaka sanny (delirium due to exogenous poisons); (13) abhinnyasa sanny (acute bronchitis); (14) santhatham (continued fever); (15) santhatham (remittent fever); (16) anyedyu (quotidian fever); (17) thirtheeyakam (tertian fever); and (18) chathurdhakam (quartan fever). 8 (a) Eighteen types of unmdda: (1) uttama; (2) rogini; (3) atmadveeshi; (4) pisachika; (5) vyaja; (6) gandharva; (7) kaumara; (8) brahma; (9) bodhika; (10) chancala; (11) suni; (12) brahmaraksus; (13) mahatii; (14) raksasam; (15) vatonmadam; (16) pittoonmadam; (17) haphoonmadam; (18) sannipctham. (b) Eighteen types of apasmara: (1) deehi; (2) kali; (3) chamundi bhairavi; (4) sarasyamohini; (5) chutala badrakali; (6) brahmi; (7) ratyubhayamkari; (8) ratrardha panchami; (9) yamanii- murthi; (10) kotumkali; (11) brahmavahiniidevi; (12) jamini; (13) karumurthi; (14) durgha; (15) bhairavi; (16) kaumari; (17) bhasureeswari; (18) bhaminii durgha.</page><page sequence="27">200 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE vdta (air), pitta (bile) and kapha (phlegm). It is also apparent that some of the lunacies (Nos. 4, 6, 8, 12, 14) are caused explicitly by external (supernatural) agents. It is extremely striking that the last type of lunacy is called sannip~tham (from Sanskrit san-ni-pata) even though the term sanni does not appear in any of the previous words in the list. The conclu- sion is irresistible that the cause of lunacy in Kerala is directly or in- directly traceable, as it is in Sinhalese folk theory, to the upsetting of hum- oral homeostasis. While the unmada list has five lunacies that are caused by supernatural agents, this is much more explicit in the list of apasmara where all the epilepsies are caused by female demonesses. We are therefore justified in further concluding that in the Malayalam lists of diseases there is a tendency, as in Ceylon, to attribute causation of illness to ex- ternal agents when diseases are not amenable or explicable in terms o physical medicine, as in the case of lunacies and epilepsies. Now we are in a position to draw more positive inferences regarding the origin and nature of the Sanni demons. The evidence strongly suggests that the term sanni, a tadbhava (derivative) of the Sanskrit word san-ni-pdta, is derived from South India, probably Kerala. We have no evidence that the demons themselves are of Kerala origin. This seems, however, to be the likely source of diffusion, specially in view of the fact that, according to Kerala medical texts, there is a tendency as in Ceylon, to a 'demono- morphic' representation of disease symptoms not amenable to physical medicine. Furthermore, texts of spells (mantra) in my possession suggest that Kola Sanniya causes various types of purely physical illnesses, among them the fevers from sanni-pata in the classic Sanskrit sense. While these texts are omitted from current performances, or are uttered softly as befits spells, they are nevertheless important for understanding the historic development of the Sanni demons. One popular manuscript in my posses- sion records the confrontation between the Buddha Dipankara and Kola Sanniya at Visala. Buddha Dipankara asks Kola Sanniya about the nature of the diseases he causes. Kola Sanniya replies thus: 'vataijwara (fevers from air or wind), pitta (bile) jwara, sleshma (water, phlegm) jwara, sannipata jwara (fevers from san-ni-pata), ushtand jwara (?) and eighteen such jwaras....' These texts suggest very strongly that sanni sometimes refers to physical illnesses caused by humoral disequilibrium even in Sinhalese ritual. Yet this aspect of sanni is de-emphasized in the actual ritual where the stress is on the eighteen masked Sanni demons and their symptoma- tology. When we consider this latter list of eighteen Sanni demons we note that some of their names represent obvious physical illnesses: for example, Bihiri sanniya (deafness), Kana sanniya (diseases of the eye), Vevulun sanniya (shivering), Jala sanniya (dysentery, diarrhea), etc. Yet on the other extreme there are sannis which suggest psychosomatic or psychological ailments, such as Demala sanniya (uttering of gibberish), Kala sanniya</page><page sequence="28">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS 201 (getting thin), Ndga sanniya (seeing snakes in dreams), Vedi sanniya (seeing guns in dreams), Olmada sanniya (babbling), etc. Some of the ailments that suggest physical illness could also conceivably be psychosomatic (e.g., vevulun, shivering), while the psychosomatic ones could also be physical (e.g., olmdda, babbling, kala, getting thin). How can we explain these odd assortments of physical and psychological illnesses ? The answer I think is simple. The Sanni demons, both in their South Indian home and in Ceylon, were probably originally representations of physical illnesses caused by humoral disequilibrium. Even today the formal attributes of the eighteen masked demons, as signified by their names, suggest somatic as well as psychological illnesses. However, the actual behavior of these demons 'on stage' strongly emphasizes psycho- logical symptoms almost to the total exclusion of physical ones, as I shall demonstrate later. Such a pattern of evolution, from the physical to the psychological, is entirely plausible for various reasons. First, the physically caused sanni diseases were the most serious forms of illness according to Ayurveda. Second, according to both South Indian vernacular medical texts and Sinhalese 'spells', sanni sometimes explicitly refers to physically caused san-ni-pata diseases. On the village level, however, even serious physically caused san-ni-pata diseases may not have been amenable to physical treatment due to at least a lack of knowledge of Ayurvedic medicine; hence ritual treatment may have been necessary. In the course of the practice of these rituals the physical aspect of sanni would have been de-emphasized and the psychological aspects developed, for various reasons. For example, it would become apparent through continued practice that demonic curing is primarily efficacious for diseases of a psychological or psychosomatic etiology. Furthermore, patients who possess hysterical and psychopatho- logical symptoms are attracted by this form of cure. Finally, with the development and spread of Ayurvedic physical medicine on the village level many illnesses of demonstrably physical origin would be treated by Ayurvedic medical practitioners who are now found in practically every village. The spread of Ayurvedic medicine in Ceylon was a continuous historical process, but the twentieth century saw its rapid acceleration largely due to the establishment of two major colleges for training Ayurvedic physicians. The spread of Ayurvedic (and recently modern Western) medicine erodes the field of ritual curing in respect to physical illness, for these illnesses have now become comprehensible in terms of Ayurvedic theory. Thus today ritual curing caters primarily to persons with psycho- logical or psychosomatic symptoms, or 'incurable' physical illnesses (see Obeyesekere, 1967 for details). The preceding interpretation receives more support when we look at the dances of the Sanni demons themselves. Here each demon comes into the F</page><page sequence="29">202 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE arena and 'parades' before the patient displaying the symptom that demon represents. For example, Amukku Sanniya vomits and eats the stuff; Jala Sanniya has diarrhea and utters scatalogical obscenities. Wirz describes how Maru Sanniya, the demon of death-bed delirium, enters the arena, performs a spectacular dance, and then settles down to a comic dialogue. (Wirz, 1954: 61). Kana Sanniya literally means 'blindness'; Kora Sanniya is 'cripple' or 'paralytic'; and Golu Sanniya is 'dumb'; yet when they enter the arena what is emphasized are the comic aspects of these physical symptoms. Indeed, in Wirz's account the physical symptoms are totally ignored in the masked representations; the comic dialogues engaged upon by these three demons have little relation to the physical symptoms their names represent (Wirz, 1954: 60, 62). It seems that the rituals have developed in such a manner that it is not the mere physical symptoms that are depicted, but the psychological meanings of these symptoms. The original sanni of physical medicine have developed psychological symptomatology in accordance with the propensities of curing rituals and the needs of the masses. In these ritual dances what is uniformly emphasized is bizarre behaviour charac- teristic of the serious psychoses and neuroses. In fact one reason for not representing all eighteen Sanni demons is not simply lack of time as the practitioners state. In general those Sanni that could be utilized to empha- size psychological symptoms are presented on stage; the others have little psychological relevance and hence are forgotten or ignored. Moreover, one reason for lack of time is that great emphasis is given to comic, obscene dialogues. These dialogues, whose psychological meanings we shall discuss later, again express bizarre, psychotic thinking and sense confusion. Olmada (babbling, lunacy; Sanskrit, unmada) is the keynote of these dialogues. An examination of the evolution of the names of the Sanni illustrate further the psychological process we have discussed. For example, take Buta sanniya and Abata sanniya. Each of these terms in Sanskrit has two fundamental meanings. Bhita means literally (a) that which has been, i.e., the elements; and (b) non-humans, both derived from the root bhu (elements). In Sinhalese, buta (or bhata) generally means demon; abata, as a name of a demon, is probably derived from the Sinhalese word, adbhata, which in Sanskrit is also adbhata (fantastic, mysterious, wonderful). Similarly, the name Bata Sanniya, according to informants, denotes valbfta, which in Sinhalese means 'nonsensical babbling'. In Sinhalese folk plays there is a comic character known as Bahu Bata (bahu, plural, multiple). It seems that bata which is common to all three Sinhalese words denotes 'bizarre, comic, fantastic' in addition to its meaning of 'demon'. While the derivation of the words flouts the normal rules of the language, their meanings make good psychological sense in relation to the psychotic symptomatology they suggest. It is also likely that originally these words</page><page sequence="30">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS 203 had none of the popular connotations which they have today, but their association with comic demons resulted in the development of these meanings. For example, it is likely that the Buta Sanniya was originally derived from buta (Sanskrit bhuta) or 'demon'. Subsequently, as a result of the demon's behaving in a nonsensical manner, he became an embodiment of valbata (nonsense). A similar inference may be made about Abata Sanniya. In Laggala, Central Ceylon, which is a different cultural region, there is a distinct demon known as Abuta placated in rituals. The Abuta of Laggala is a 'serious' deity, and the term is probably derived from those meanings of adbata which connote 'mysterious' rather than 'bizarre'. The latter meaning probably developed as a result of the association of the word with a 'comic demon' in the southern and western provinces. What we are suggesting is that originally all three (including the character Bahu Buta of folk plays) were butas, demons. Subsequently they became (val) bata, a(d)buta, and (bahu) buta. Once the demons developed ludicrous propensities, the term buta, in Sinhalese, developed connotations of 'nonsense' and 'fantasy'. Similarly some practitioners refer to a demon known as Sat Dina Sanniya, 'seven-day Sanni'. This term is the semantic analogue of either santhatham (continued fever) or sathatham (remittent fever) or anyedyu (quotidian fever) in the Malayalam sanni list (note 2, p. 199). This Sanni demon has practically gone out of vogue and is never represented on stage, because the Sanni ritual has ceased to serve diseases of primarily physical origin. Then there is Kola Sanniya who we noted was a pantheistic demon representing the most serious of all illnesses (sannipata) or the cause of all the preceding illnesses. True to our interpretation, kola in Sinhalese physical medicine refers to coma. Yet the ritual specialists interpret this term differently, blissfully violating 'normal' grammatical rules: kola is kolam, 'ludicrous behaviour' or kolavipirita, 'foolish babbling'. Thus while the original meaning of kola as 'coma' has lost its relevance, the psycho- logical meaning has come to stay. An even better example of etymological distortion is Viidi Sanniya (Veddha or 'Aboriginal Hunter' Sanniya) men- tioned in Wirz's list and other sanni lists I have seen (Wirz, 1954: 61). In Hinidum Pattu, however, this demon does not appear; instead Vedi Sanniya (literally, 'shooting with a gun' Sanniya) appears. Grammarians may not like the derivation, but it is psychologically and sociologically entirely plausible. Wirz mentions that Vddi Sanniya appears with bow and arrow. But bow and arrow, as well as Veddhas, have little significance in con- temporary western and southern provinces. So Vedi ('gun-shooting') Sanni has taken the place of the former for many ritual specialists in these areas, and a man with a gun takes the place of the Veddha with bow and arrow. Moreover, according to my informants, dreams of guns are a symptom of ve/i sanni disease. Guns in dreams are probably phallic symbols. In some</page><page sequence="31">204 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE Sinhalese harvest rituals (gamma.duva) the gun is a blatant phallic symbol placed below the abdomen of the performer. In another Sinhalese ritual known as the ambavidamana (shooting of the mango), the mango is shot sometimes in a peculiar manner. The priest lies face upwards on the floor, places the bow and arrow on his abdomen and shoots phalli- cally. Thus Vedi sanniya and Vddi sanniya are easily interchangeable demons, because they are functionally equivalent both sociologically and psychologically. THE FUNCTIONS OF OBSCENITY We noted earlier that the ritual arena represents a special interaction situa- tion and that one problem pertaining to the interaction situation is role generalization in relation to the priest. A similar problem arises in relation to the demons, invisible presences who have been summoned by the priest and are now interacting with priest, patient and the assembled villagers. If religious ritual could be viewed as a means of interacting with deities, we could justifiably analyse the status-role of the deities in relation to the human 'others' in the special interaction situation of the ritual arena (Horton, 1960: 210-23). As far as the demons are concerned, there is also a problem of role generalization that has to be solved. In normal life humans define the demon role in terms of power, malevolence and irrational vindictiveness. Human beings in everyday life are utterly afraid of con- fronting these dreaded beings that inhabit their behavioral environment. The demons in turn attack human beings: and the patient who is present in the ritual arena is direct evidence of the vindictive power of the demons. If the role of the demon were generalized into the ritual situation, human beings would be cowed with terror and fright, for here too is a situation where man confronts the demon. Thus there have to be techniques of resolving the problem of role generalization in respect of the demons. There are several ways of coping with this problem. There is, initially, public confidence in the priest who has the magical 1 A similar evolution can be seen in respect to kapala kuduva and kapala sanniya. The kapala kaduva is the revolving altar that contains offerings to the Sanni demons. In Wirz's account it is simply called Sanni kiduva (lit., 'nest of the Sanni'). None of my informants could give a satisfactory explanation of kapala kuiduva. The likely explanation is that kapala in Sanskrit means 'skull' (Sinhalese kabala). In midnight rituals for Mahasona held in a ceme- tery, and in a ritual known as nichakula tinduva (low-caste ritual), I have seen food cooked in a human skull and offered to demons. It is likely therefore that kapala kuduva was originally a skull in which oblations were offered to Sanni, and was later formalized into a circular, revolving altar. Reference to kapala sanniya is found in Wirz who describes this demon as 'the sanniya who spreads insanity among men' (1956: 44). Two explanations come into my mind: (1) perhaps kapcla sanniya was the guardian demon of the kapala kuiduva; (2) alternatively, kapala is skull, and by extension could mean 'head' and Kapala Sanniya is 'sanni of the head'. In Sinhalese, insanity is often referred to as 'the head gone bad'. However I am not entirely satisfied with this explanation, for one could have expected the popular Sinhalese ritual term for head-sirisa-to be used. Indeed in the Tamil sanni list the term chirasu channy (sanni of the head) appears. But in Sinhalese this should read as sirasa sanni and not kapala sanni.</page><page sequence="32">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS 205 know-how to control the demons. We have discussed earlier the manner in which public confidence is brought about. Second, and more important, there is the prescribed obscenity and horseplay which has the social function of easing this special interaction situation. This is achieved mainly by stripping these beings of their mythological attributes and presenting them in the arena as ludicrous, comic and humorous figures. Previous to their physical appearance in the arena, their violent, blood-thirsty, canni- balistic attributes are emphasized, as in the ritual of the mat, and in their myths of origin. Their masked representations that follow contradict these mythological attributes. These inversions not only ease the interaction situation, but prevent the attitudes one has towards demons in ordinary life from being generalized to the ritual situation. Villagers enter into the ritual situation with the expectation, not of confronting terrifying beings but of seeing another aspect of the demons as comic ludicrous beings. Furthermore, the prescribed obscenities have a more general social function. In ordinary social life one is utterly afraid of these beings; the ritual provides a release from these fears, and prevents them from developing into an obsessive component of the social life. It should be noted that not only is the 'normal' attitude towards demons inverted in the rituals, but attitudes towards other deities in the pantheon as well-the Buddha and the Guardian Deities. In general social life these beings are treated with the greatest reverence and circumspection. In the ritual, vulgar references are made to the Buddha; and the Guardian Gods become the victims of Kola Sanniya's crude horseplay. The manner in which the audience participates in the obscenities illustrates the general status of the Buddha and the Guardian Gods vis-a-vis the demons. The demons behave ludicrously in the arena; the audience laughs directly at them and often adds its own vulgar comments in the performance. To laugh directly at the revered high-status deities like the Buddha and the Gods is unthinkable; rather these deities are made fun of by K1la Sanniya, and the audience participates in the activity indirectly and vicariously. The problem can be summed up thus: the deities demand absolute respect, or fear or allegiance; any superordination-subordination relationship of this sort creates tensions towards the latter by the former; these tensions are relieved by the cathartic mechanism of obscenity; the expression of these feelings in the ritual permits individuals to better interact with these authority figures in normal social life.1 What is the meaning of these obscenities for the patient, for whom the 1 According to psychoanalytic theory, the general attitude to authority is based on the specific attitude to the parents-specially the father. The relationship to the father in Sin- halese social structure is one of 'extreme respect tending to avoidance' (Leach, 1960: 126). If, furthermore, attitudes to supernatural beings represent (in the unconscious) attitudes towards the father, one of the major personal functions of these rituals is the release of ambivalent feelings towards the father generated in the family interaction situation.</page><page sequence="33">206 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE ritual is held? In general the sanni ritual is performed for a person afflicted or possessed by a demon. Serious forms of demonic attack, possession or confrontation are frightening experiences. Here the patient is 'told' that demons have another aspect, the reverse of his perception and experience of them. This situation is dramatized in the Atura Sanniya episode, which heralds the appearance of the Sanni demons. Here, it will be remembered, the patient is covered with a white curtain (kadaturava); suddenly a demon enters the arena, tears apart the curtain, confronts the startled patient and departs as swiftly as he had arrived. This episode dramatizes the aspect of the demon as originally perceived by the patient; a being causing fright. Immediately after this episode, the ritual drama of the Sanni demons commences; here the opposite aspect of the demons, as ludicrous beings, is being represented. If the frightening aspect of demons represents an anthropomorphism of inner anxieties, then their conversion into ludicrous beings permits the patient to laugh at these inner fears; laugh his terrors away, so to speak. Moreover, an overwhelmingly large number of patients seeking ritual remedy are females; rigid, highly repressed women with strong superegos. Here the patient listens to the moral aspect of the religious life treated with disrespect. The patient can participate in the scatalogical, urethral and sexual obscenities normally held in abhorrence, and never aired in public. Nor need there be any guilt regarding obscenities directed at the higher deities for it is not the patient but the demon who does all this. It is a part of the demon role in the ritual drama and hence 'temporary'. At the conclusion of the drama, the demons acknowledge the superiority of the Buddha and the Gods. Obscenities of the type described here are prescribed, as Evans-Pritchard noted for Azande obscenity (1929). They are also stereotyped and their performance is considered necessary for the success of the ritual. While spontaneous humour is permitted, it has to be accommodated within a stereotyped framework. The obscenities are also not there for their own sakes, but have a 'logic of their own'. The logic of obscenity constitutes its 'purpose', and the purpose or envisaged end is a serious one. Thus Kola Sanniya and the other Sanni demons perform comic antics to the great amusement of the audience. But the obscenities are a dramatization of the manner in which a person afflicted with a particular demon would behave. The comic 'act' is a dramatic representation of a psychological disease syndrome as noted earlier. Kola Sanniya, for example, utters kola vipirita, 'foolish and babbling talk', which is the way a person afflicted with the demon would behave in his delirium. Other demons like Btta Sanniya and Amukka Sanniya enter the arena and demonstrate how a person afflicted by them would behave-confusing one thing for another, uttering obscenities, babbling, eating one's own vomit, etc. All these comic enactments of psychological disease symptoms end in a deadly serious note: the demon</page><page sequence="34">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS 207 takes the offering (dola) and promises to leave the patient for good (tindui- nivdranai). Exclusion and Inclusion The central symbol in the ritual drama of the Sanni demons is the ka.davata or 'barrier at the entrance to a city'. The barrier is guarded by the guardian gods: the demon tries to cross the barrier, but he is barred from doing so by the guardian gods. This process is identical to what happens in initiation ritual and symbolizes an exclusion, to use Hertz's term (Hertz, 1960). Kola Sanniya is forbidden to cross the barrier; at the conclusion of the ritual the barrier is opened by the gods and Kola Sanniya crosses it and reaches the other side. This symbolizes the process of inclusion. Van Gennep and Malinowski used the terms separation and aggregation, separation and incorporation, respectively, to describe similar processes (Van Gennep, 1960; Malinowski, 1948). In puberty rites exclusion and inclusion symbolize a status change among the initiates. The initiates are excluded from their old status of child and included in the new status of adult. In the Kola Sanniya ritual the symbolic act of crossing the barrier has a similar meaning. Fundamentally, a status change has occurred here; in this case a status change associated with conversion. Kola Sanniya is a non-Buddhist, non-believing deity, whose alien nature is emphasized. He is, we noted, sometimes called Demala Maha Kola Sanniya (the Great South Indian Kola Sanniya), who insults the Buddha and the guardian deities and ridicules Buddhist prayer. As an alien he is excluded from crossing the barrier (the city gates). Then later he is included in the Buddhist pantheon and given a status in the formal hierarchy of deities. The barrier also represents obstacles that have to be overcome, or tasks performed prior to the change of status and is struc- turally equivalent to ordeals and tests of strength in puberty rites. Initiation rites imply changes in status as well as changes in the moral values that govern those statuses. The initiate in puberty rites renounces childhood values and is taught the values of the adult world. There is a basic opposition between the values of the contrasted statuses. In the Kola Sanniya ritual a similar value opposition is seen; the barrier sym- bolically separates the world of mundane values represented by Kola Sanniya and that of ethical values represented by the Buddha and the guardian deities. Kola Sanniya tries to quell the guardian gods with those techniques that may be successful in worldly interaction: food, bribery, cajoling, threats, etc. He does not understand them and consequently insults them by calling them 'guards, soldiers, beggars', and bringing them polluted foods. He also insults the Buddha and his teaching. But the demon does not succeed, and ultimately he has to accept the supremacy of Buddhist values. He gives up his old habit of killing and eating humans; instead he</page><page sequence="35">208 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE accepts offerings of food from them. The sannasa or letter of authority, which in feudal Ceylon is associated with royal grants, symbolizes his acknowledgement of the superior Buddhist values, and gives Kola Sanniya a formal status (however low) in the Buddhist pantheon. Note how this occurs. After Kola Sanniya realizes that he cannot dislodge the gods from the barrier, he is asked to go to the Buddha's residence at Jetavanarama to obtain a letter of authority or sannasa from him. At the word 'Jetavana- rama', Kola Sanniya gets frightened and says, 'No, no...', expressive again of the opposition between the values represented by the Buddha and the demon. The manner in which Kola Sanniya brings the letter of authority also is interesting. On the first occasion he brings the letter on his foot; then tied to his knee; and the third time on his head. Head-foot oppositions we know are extremely widespread cross-culturally and suggest 'superior- inferior', 'pure-impure', 'supramundane-worldly'. The three stages as phases of inclusion are also found in puberty rites for females in Hiniduma. On achieving menarch a Sinhalese girl is excluded in a hut (kiliga) in the bush outside the house; after a few days she is brought into a hut almost adjacent the house; and finally she is brought into the house and included again with the family in the status of marriageable female. To sum up, the barrier and its associated ritual symbolizes (a) change in status, in this case conversion of an alien deity and his inclusion in the formal pantheon, and (b) a value opposition with the triumph of good (Buddha) over evil (demon). Note that evil as represented by the demon is not eliminated; this would be naive. Rather the existence of evil is recognized and given its proper place at the conclusion of the ritual. It is brought under control and sub- ordinated to the higher values of the society. The ritual, like many similar ones performed in Ceylon, ends with the taming (Kola Sanniya is burnt by the Buddha's rays) and the humanization (Kola Sanniya desists from killing mortals) of an alien deity and an affirmation of Buddhist values. Indeed, the whole drama is also a validation of the respective roles of the deities in the pantheon-the Buddha as the major, presidential deity, the guardian gods as protectors of Buddhism, and the inferior subordinate demon who is under the authority of both the Buddha and the gods. No informant could express directly or clearly the symbolism of the barrier. This interpretation is ours: but informants could express, howbeit hazily, that the drama represents a triumph of Buddhist values, that it depicts the subjugation of a non-believing (mitya disti) being by the Buddha. Thus the symbolism affects the audience on a level that is only partly conscious, as is probably true of all art and religion. Nevertheless, I believe that the message of the symbol is communicated to the audience through the medium of the drama. Note that this core symbolism of the barrier involves the following 'plot': alien demon-barrier guarded by the gods-permission of the Buddha and the opening of the barrier. Any kind</page><page sequence="36">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS 209 of story, or detail, can be woven around this plot without affecting the core-symbolism. In the present instance the story is not simply the enact- ment of the origin myth of Kola Sanniya; several details in the myth are omitted and others, not mentioned in the myth, included. Thus it was possible for informants to give various interpretations of the story; yet all the time the central values represented by the core symbolism remained constant. Regarding the story enacted in the arena, we were given at least three important interpretations by ritual specialists: (1) Everyone recognized that the story is an enactment of the subjuga- tion of Kola Sanniya by the Buddha. It refers to that part of the Kola Sanniya origin myth where the Buddha by his extraordinary powers sub- jugated Kola Sanniya and banished fear and disease from Visala in India. (2) In addition to this some informants asserted that the ritual drama also depicts Kola Sanniya's attempts to enter the human world (nara loka); the kadavata or 'city gates' represents the entrance to the world. Many elements in the ritual drama are consonant with this interpretation: for example, the humanizing and taming of Kola Sanniya before he is permitted to enter the human world; and the gods' guarding of the cardinal points. (3) It is Kola Sanniya's attempt to enter Ceylon: the 'city gates' are the point of entry. The guardian gods do not allow him to come through until he gets permission from the Buddha. The three interpretations imply one thing at least. It is possible to project into the formal plot substantive detail that may receive different interpretations. Yet if we ignore contra- dictions in the references to places and times, the drama moves in a fairly straightforward manner. While the differences in time and place may seem to pose logical contradictions and stimulate different versions (stories) of the plot, they can be nevertheless resolved from the symbolic point of view of myth and ritual. The basic feature of the differences in time and place manifested in the ritual drama is that the incident depicted occurs on three levels: (a) in the past in the time of the Buddha, at his place of residence (Jetavanarama); (b) in Ceylon, either in the past or in the present in well-known villages- Devundara, Magama, Giruva Pattu-and in the village temple; (c) in the arena at the present time, where the demon is present in person and is later banished from the patient. These seeming contradictions can be resolved if, following historians of religion like Eliade (1959), one views time in ritual as cyclical, rather than historical. In ritual the enactment of the past serves in a sense to recreate it and to make the past relevant for the present. Such a view of time is explicitly recognized in Sinhalese ritual. Often after the enactment of a dramatic episode or the performance of a healing ritual, a standard formula is uttered: 'As on that occasion such and such a ritual was performed to banish X illness, so today by the performance of this</page><page sequence="37">210 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE same ritual, illness is banished'. The underlying idea of time is that the prototypical act which cured the disease in mythical times is recreated here and now, and thereby the consequences that followed the mythical per- formance-the curing of the disease-will also follow. In the Kola Sanniya episode the prototypical act where the Buddha subjugates the demon is recreated in the present, and the prototypical consequences also follow- the demon leaves the patient and cures the illness. If Kola Sanniya is indeed a deity who was present in the past as he is in the present-then distortions of time and place are not anachronisms from the experiential point of view. Kola Sanniya is present in the then and now, in the time of the Buddha and in the body of the patient. Let me explain further what I mean by the experiential point of view. Ritual time is not something arbitrary, but is rooted in the nature of human experience in small communities. Kola Sanniya, like most deities in religious pantheons, is not an 'historical' being but rather someone perpetually present. The illnesses he represents are a perennially experienced reality for the community and hence Kola Sanniya is perennially present. The cause of the present disease and its cure is explained by the prototypical mythic charter. Originally, according to the myth, death was the result of the disease caused by the Sanni demons; but the Buddha in his compassion subjugated the demons, ordered them to leave humans after receiving substitutive offerings (dola) from them. The recreation of the myth in the context of present illness reminds the demon of his obligations and gives the patient an opportunity to fulfill his part of the contract by the offerings of gifts, prestations or oblations. To sum up, the perennial, ahistorical notion of time found in ritual and myth are not arbitrary, but products of perpetually recurring human experience. Viewed in this light, the three interpretations of the Kola Sanniya story are not mutually exclusive. The ritual drama is an enactment of the prototypic subjugation of the deity by the Buddha and his conditional acceptance into the pantheon; it is also the entry of the demon from the demon world in which he lives into the human world in which he causes illness, and his conditional taming and humanization. It is furthermore an entry of the demon into Ceylon and his subsequent inclusion in the pantheon, for his presence in Ceylon is already experienced, accepted and evident. Finally, in so far as the demon represents perpetually present illness, he is right here and now in the arena accepting offerings from the patient. In fact the distortions of time and place give the ritual drama its sense of ahistoricity, its impersonality and the relevance of the past for the present. HISTORICAL NOTE The preceding analysis suggests very strongly that the Kola Sanniya episode reveals a real historical process of diffusion where an alien deity,</page><page sequence="38">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS 211 probably South Indian in origin, is accepted by the Sinhalese, proselytized and incorporated into the Sinhalese Buddhist pantheon. It is difficult to place this event in time, but it is possible to show another technique where- by the alien cult is legitimated as part of Sinhalese religion by neatly linking the myth of the birth of Kola Sanniya with a text from the doctrinal corpus of Theravada Buddhism. This integration of the Kola Sanniya myth with a Buddhist doctrinal text is one of the fascinating problems that arise in the study of this ritual drama. Most versions of the Kola Sanniya myth refer to the Lichavis and their capital city of Visala (lit., large, wide, huge). The term Visala is identical with Vesali of the Pali (Theravada) texts and Vaisali of Sanskrit (Mahayana) texts. The Buddhist texts, and to a lesser extent Jain and Hindu sources, are replete with references to the Lichavis of Visala. According to Pali sources, the Buddha preached several important suttas (texts) in Visala. 'Among important suttas preached at Vesali are the Mahali, Mahasahamada, Cula-Saccaka, Tevijja, Vacchagotta, Lamakhatta and Ratana. The Telovada Jataka (No. 246) and the Sigala Jataka (No. 152) were preached at Vesali. After the Buddha's death a portion of his relics was enshrined in the city' (Malalasekera, 1960: 943). A detailed account of the city, its system of government, custom and religious beliefs is available in B. C. Law's work on Some Kshatriya Tribes of Ancient India (1923: 1-113). Malalasekera has a briefer summary (1960: 779-82, 940-3). From our point of view what is relevant is that the Lichavis of Visala, from whom Kola Sanniya had sprung, had a well-known kingdom in Eastern India in the time of the Buddha. Thus the geographical locus of the Kola Sanniya myth is rooted in Buddhist history and tradition. The first part of the Kola Sanniya myth, which deals with the origin of the Lichavis and their city, is almost identical with accounts given in Pali and Sinhalese (but not Chinese Sanskrit) commentarial texts. All Buddhist sources-Pali, Sanskrit and Sinhalese-agree with the Kola Sanniya myth in recording that there was a pestilence in Visala, that many people died, and that it was quelled when the Buddha preached the sacred text or paritta known as the Ratana Sutta (Jewel Discourse). Because of this remarkable consonance of a folk myth (little tradition) with the higher doctrinal (great) tradition, it will be interesting to examine the sources in more detail, so as to provide an explanation for the resemblances. The Ratana Sutta or 'Jewel Discourse' that the Buddha is said to have recited on the occasion of the plague in Visala is found in the Khuddhaka- patha, or 'The Minor Readings' (trans. Nanamoli, 1960: 4-6) and in the Sutta Nipata. These canonical sources give the bare text and make no references to the occasion on which it was recited. The latter evidence comes from the commentaries on the canon written in Pali and Sinhalese. I shall use three major commentarial sources: the commentary on the sutta</page><page sequence="39">212 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE by Buddhaghosa, the famous Indian scholar who lived in Ceylon in the fifth century; the Pujavali, a popular thirteenth-century Sinhalese com- mentarial volume on the Buddha; and the famous Sanskrit (Chinese- Mahayana) text, the Mahavastu. Let us first consider the Pali and Sin- halese commentarial sources which give an account of the origin of Visala. I shall give a summary of the story as is found in Buddhaghosa's com- mentary (trans. Nanamoli, 1960: 172-5). A child was conceived by the Queen of Benares, who later entered a maternity home and gave birth to a child one morning (morning birth indicating meritoriousness). But she gave birth to a piece of flesh that looked like a lump of lac or like hybiscus flowers. Since minor queens of the harem gave birth to princes like golden statues, she became quite distressed and in order to avoid criticism she put the flesh in a vase, covered and sealed it with the royal seal, and set it afloat in the Ganges. Deities however inscribed on a gold label in vermilion the sign 'offspring of the King of Benares' chief queen' and tied it on the vase. The vase floated down-river and was picked up by an ascetic who was living on the charity of the cowherds' family on the banks of the Ganges. He read the seal and label, opened the vase, took it to his hermitage and put it in a clean place. After a fortnight there were two pieces of flesh; two weeks later swelling representing hands, feet and legs appeared in each of them; a fortnight later one piece of flesh became a boy resembling a golden statue and the other a girl. 'Child love' sprang within the ascetic and milk was produced from his thumb. 'Whatever entered their stomachs was as visible as if they were inside a crystal jug, so skinless (nicchavi) were they-some others have said however, that their skins adhered (lind chavi) to each other as if stitched together. At any rate they became known by the name of Licchavi either because of their skinlessness (nicchavita) or because of their skins' adherence (linacchavita).' The ascetic who looked after the children had perforce to neglect his ascetic duties. The cowherds therefore suggested to him to give over the children to them to look after. The ascetic agreed and the next day the cowherds with great pomp and ceremony came to remove the children. The ascetic exhorted them to educate the children, marry them to each other, obtain land from the King, build a town there and anoint the boy. They agreed and brought up the children. As the children grew up they bullied the cowherds' children. 'Then their parents said "those children are bullying and hurting the other children, they must not be kept company with, they must be kept away from (vajjitabba)", and after that, it seems the place three hundred leagues in length was called Vajji (keep away), (which was how the people in those parts came to be called Vajjians)' (Nanamoli, 1960: 174). The cowherds with the King's permission built a city there and anointed them. No girls were to be brought in from the outside for marriage or sent out from there. 'From their first cohabitation two children were born, a daughter and a son. Sixteen times there were two born in this way. Then when the children had eventually grown up and when there came to be insufficient room to contain the wealth of the gardens, parks, dwelling places and retainers, they three times built a certain wall round it, each time a quarter league's distance outside the last. Because of that repeated enlargement (Nesali Kattaka) the (town) came to be called Vesali' (1960: 174-5). The Sinhalese account in Pujavali (ed. Nanavimala, 1965: 432-53) is substantially the same; but it is more ornate and lacks the succinctness and economy of style that characterizes the Pali account. The Sinhalese account here, as elsewhere in the Pujavali, is probably directly borrowed</page><page sequence="40">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS 2I3 from Pali sources. The version of this myth in the Ko1a Sanniya ritual is basically similar, though there are minor differences: (a) in the ritual text the mythological setting is in the very beginnings of the human race and not in Benares (which is incidentally the classic setting for many Buddhist jataka stories); (b) the assembled people cast out the 'foetus' and set it afloat, according to the ritual tradition. No reference is made to the gods of the river protecting the 'foetus'; (c) the ascetic who found the casket was, according to the ritual tradition, not simply an ascetic but the Buddha in a previous birth; (d) the ritual sources state that the ascetic kept the children for a week and then gave them to the care of the villagers; (e) in both, brother marries sister, but no reference is found in the ritual to sixteen twins, or the etymologies of Lichavi, Visala and Vajji. Probably the really major difference is that the ritual tradition states that a sunbeam entered the womb of the princess, whereas no reference to the manner of conception is found in the Pali text and in the Pujavaliya. Interestingly enough, the genealogy of the Nepalese Kings states that the Lichavis belonged to the solar dynasty (suryavamsa) of the Kshatriyas (Law, 1923: 12). This tradition must have been more widespread for it seems to have influenced the Sinhalese ritual tradition. This states that the beam of the sun entered the womb of the Aryan princess and she conceived the fleshy lump from which arose the Lichavis. The Tibetan and Chinese (Sanskrit) sources make no references, as far as we know, to the origin myth of the Lichavis. There is then a remarkable consonance between the Sinhalese ritual tradition and the Pali and Sinhalese commentarial tradition regarding the origin myth of the Lichavis. However from this point onwards there is a divergence, for nowhere in the Pali tradition is there reference to the story of Kola Sanniya himself. Both sources agree that there was a plague in Visala but according to the Buddhist commentaries it was due to a drought which resulted in a scarcity of rice, and subsequent famine. The famine brought pestilence and plague in its wake, and people died by the thousands. Demons were then attracted by the smell of death, and this caused further fright in the hearts of the inhabitants (Nanamoli, 1963: 175-6). The people of Visala were thus beset by three fears: the fear of disease, of famine and of non-humans (Nanamoli, 1963: 176; Pujavaliya, 1965: 437). While the commentaries unequivocally state that the original cause of these fears was a drought, the ritual sources state equally un- equivocally that they were caused by the demon Kola Sanniya and his associates (or according to the one version of the myth, by a preta named Dan Udiya). Pestilence and famine were the results of the depredations of the Sanni demons. After this point however the commentarial and ritual sources again converge: in both accounts the Buddha arrived at</page><page sequence="41">214 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE Visala and was instrumental in (a) cleaning the city with a rain created by Sakra, the king of the Gods; (b) reciting the paritta (pirit) known as the Ratana Sutta; (c) banishing the demons by the power of pirit and/or by the rays of the Buddha. There are minor differences but the three funda- mental incidents listed above are similar. The Sanskrit (Chinese) source, the Mahavastu, is also basically agreed regarding the latter account, but it also disagrees with the Pali commentaries and agrees with the Sinhalese ritual tradition regarding the origin of the plague at Visala. According to the Mahavastu, the plague at Visala was caused by non-humans, though not by the demon Kola Sanniya. On the slopes of the Himalayas there dwelt a yaksini, named Kundala, who in two successive years gave birth to five hundred sons, and when she had begotten these thousand sons she died. These sons were sent to Vaisali to rob it of its strength, and when they came there they robbed men of their strength. There are two kinds of disease which are produced by demonic agency, mandalaka and adhivasa. The plague mandalaka, when it attacks a family, does not spare anyone, but carries away everybody. The plague called adhivasa attacks a whole district. Now the people of Vaisali were stricken with the adhivasa and many died (Mahavastu, transl. Jones, 1969: 208). What are we to make of these remarkable convergences and diver- gences between a myth sung in contemporary Sinhalese rituals and those of formal doctrinal Buddhism? Historically viewed one of two answers seems probable. First, we may say that the Kola Sanniya text (or rather the tradition it contains) is antecedent to the Pali commentary and there- fore the Pali text is a rationalization of the former. It is characteristic of Theravada Buddhism to de-emphasize magic as far as possible and the naturalistic explanation of the drought in Visala suits such a tradition. This is not the case with Mahayana Buddhism, and it is conceivable that the Mahavastu explanation of the event belongs to an older tradition. Alternatively, one could say that the Kola Sanniya text is a later develop- ment. One could also argue that the Mahavastu account is also later, or a tradition totally independent of the Sinhalese ritual one. Anthropological bias may favour the first explanation but I am inclined to accept the second. In comparing the ritual and doctrinal sources one fact clearly emerges. That part of the myth which deals with Kola Sanniya himself finds no mention in doctrinal sources and is therefore an independent myth, most likely diffused from South India and incorporated into a larger Buddhist mythological tradition. The rest of the myth, which deals with the origin of the Lichavis and the plague in Visala, is derived directly from Buddhist canonical and commentarial sources. The Ratana Sutta has been one of the most popular Pali texts recited by villagers from at least very early times, for the Sinhalese chronicle, Culavamsa, records the tradition that Ratana Sutta was first recited in Ceylon to ward off drought</page><page sequence="42">THE RITUAL DRAMA OF THE SANNI DEMONS 215 and plague that beset Ceylon in Upatissa's reign (died A.D. 409) (Cula- vamsa, 1953: 18-19). If the Culavamsa account is correct, then the story of the plague of Visala was also a part of a popular tradition for Upatissa says: 'Did not the Great Sage (Buddha) when the world was visited by such famine and the like, provide some kind of help for the world' (Culavamsa, 1953: 18). Buddhaghosa's commentary, which was written in the next reign (Mahanama, A.D. 409-31), simply records a pre-existent tradition (probably a popular one). Thus the Ratana Sutta and its asso- ciated popular mythology would have been an intimate part of the culture of the people, and hence it would have been an easy matter to incorporate the Kola Sanniya myth into this pre-existent corpus of myth. Irrespective of the historical explanation, however, the significance of the convergence lies in the attempt to incorporate a 'folk cult' into the dominant Buddhist religion through its mythological system. But it should be noted that this incorporation has occurred only on the level of the Buddhism of the masses. Doctrinal religiosity as reflected in the Pali tradition totally ignores Kola Sanniya, a point which suggests the utility of viewing mass and doctrinal religiosity as analytically separate frames of reference (Obeyesekere, 1963, 1967). Finally, one may ask why the incident of the quelling of Kola Sanniya is repeated in the 'ages' of both Dipankara, the legendary Buddha of the previous age and the Buddha Gautama in Texts II and III, whereas in Text I the episode occurs in the time of the 'historical' Buddha Gautama. My own view is that there is an attempt on the part of some priests to resolve a cognitive impasse regarding the attributes of the Buddha. The myth and ritual drama 'requires' that the Buddha should quell the demon and tame him generally with those magical techniques (spells, charms) that are used today by village priests for the same purpose. Yet the role of the Buddha as arch-magician is singularly inappropriate, for according to general Sinhalese belief he is the embodiment of supreme benevolence and represents supramundane, as against worldly, values. This cognitive dilemma is resolved in the 'tradition' represented in Texts II and III, by attributing the role of arch-magician to the Buddha of the previous age, Dipankara. Gautama the Buddha of the present age is therefore spared embarrassment. In version I, this development has not taken place and Gautama behaves in a singularly indecorous manner. Yet even in Text I a discrimination of the same sort takes place. This text states that K6la Sanniya in his first birth obtained the authority of the Buddha to destroy the city of Visala. This again is a grossly unorthodox role for the Buddha; hence this incident is foisted on another legendary Buddha, Padumuttara, who, according to tradition, lived in an even more distant age.</page><page sequence="43">216 GANANATH OBEYESEKERE REFERENCES Ames, M.
