<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERSONALITY AND INSTINCTS OF ANIMALS The Personality of Animals. By H. Munro Fox, F.R.S., Professor of Zoology, University of Birmingham. Pelican Books A. 78. (Pp. 124. 6d.) * Harmondsworth : Penguin Books, Ltd. Until comparatively recent times the study of zoology was divided between the morphologist and the field naturalist, who exchanged few contacts. Some twenty to thirty years ago a school of experimental zoology arose which has studied animal life under rigidly controlled scientific con ditions. In this entertaining little book, free from the anthropomorphism to which animal lovers are so prone, Prof. Munro Fox has given a popular account of some of the results obtained thereby. We learn that fishes can not only hear but can discriminate between sounds if not less than an octave apart ; that a dog's perception of sound includes notes of much higher pitch and is not only ten times as acute as ours but in discriminating the source of a sound is also twice as accurate. We are told that bees can see blue but not red, while they can see ultra-violet rays ; hens can see blue but not violet ; pigeons can see the red end of the spectrum better than the further end ; while cats and dogs are colour-blind. But if animals have poorer colour discrimination than we have, their sense of smell and of position are far more accurate. There is an entertaining chapter entitled "Do Animals Count?" which suggests that the more intelligent ones can count up to five but not beyond, as well as a fascinating description of the way in which a bee's sense of time can be accelerated by thyroid and delayed by quinine. The importance of the hormonal drive in directing instincts is emphasized. Through such information we are skilfully led to realize how differently our world appears to animals. The author reaches the conclusion that those animals</page><page sequence="2">558 AttUL 12, 1941 REVIEWS mT?^ which have fewest instincts possess most personality, for then each individual in its lifetime accumulates a different store of experience on which it acts ; each individual is different from its neighbours. Mammals, and more particularly man, have fewest instincts and therefore have the greatest degree of personality.</page></plain_text>
