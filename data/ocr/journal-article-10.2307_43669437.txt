Danow* FICTIONS WITHIN FICTION: A Note on the Art of Jurij Oleša The work of literature is commonly regarded to bear two important functions: the communicative and the aesthetic J It shares the former with all instances of written communication, while the latter is what makes it an entity whose pri- mary focus is upon its own message. 2 In bearing a dominant aesthetic function, the literary work is distinguished from other forms of writing (as in the distinc- tion between literatura and siovesnosť, where the latter, as all-inclusive, em- braces the former as distinctive). Furthermore, by depicting a fictional world rather than the "real/' which it nevertheless models in some sense ,3 the problem arises as to whether the distinction between truth and fiction in reality may be legitimately posed with regard to literature. As Tzvetan Todorov observes, "literature is not a discourse that can or must be false, in contrast to the discourse of the sciences; it is a discourse that, precisely, cannot be subjected to the test of truth; it is neither true nor false, to raise this question has no meaning; this is what defines its very status as 'fiction /"4 Jan Mukarovský asserts essentially the same thing in somewhat more technical, semiotic terms: "But is information . . . contained in a work of literature . . . actual information, or does it somehow differ from it? And how? It is different, precisely because the aesthetic function, by dominating over the informational function, has changed the very nature of the infor- mation. Within the realm of fiction exclusively, however, the problem re- mains as to whether on some ontological level we can distinguish between truth and "fiction" in literature. And here, what Mukarovský has to say is crucial to our present concerns: "The fact of whether, to what degree and in what manner the writer presents the narrated event as real or fictional, will be ... an important element of the structure of the literary work. . . ." "Fic- tionally" in literature is thus something totally different from communica- tive fiction. . . .Falsehood. . . acts as an element of structure and not of real- life values having practical importance."® In other words, one can speak of truth and lie in the "real world" but only of different levels of fiction in liter- ature, where the "lie" might be realized as metaphor, serve as a device such as the "false lead," or, in short, function as a definitive element within the greater structure of the work itself. The stories of Jurij Oleša represent a striking vehicle for considering the problem of what role fiction plays within fictional constructs. The present study is concerned with the manner in which Oleša creates fiction within his * David K.

Certain events related within the pages of his works do, indeed, occur, while others simply do not take place as "real" events but rather as dreams, visions, or fantasies. These latter appear as a kind of capricious "fictitiousness" juxtaposed with episodes which are meant to be understood as having truly happened within the context of the given story. The two levels of fiction are themselves interwoven in a fashion which allows the resultant works to reflect upon some "real world" presumably recognizable to all, and an imaginary one apprehended by only a gifted, chosen few. The questions which are to be explored here are the ways in which one level of fiction is distinguished from the other. What function do they play in relation to each other and to the work as a whole? And, by what artistic method are they intermeshed as episodic sequences making the work an integrated whole rather than a series of dissociated narrative units? As a further, preliminary observation, it should be remarked that the two levels of fiction under consideration consistently represent opposed intentions and thus make for one of the basic governing tensions in the author's work. On the one hand, there are the sheer figments of imagination generated on the part of either a character or narrator, whose views and observations are intended, nevertheless, to be credited on some semantic plane. Such figments are then set in opposition to pieces of information conveyed differently and to be under- stood as being of a "factual" nature. Both, of course, are ultimately features of the author's imagination; however, one form is intended to communicate, the other to dissimulate - or, better, to extend the realm of fiction into another, less accessible realm, which the writer calls the "invisible land." Thus, he explains: Я вглядываюсь все сосредоточеннее, и вдруг какой-то сдвиг происходит в моем мозгу: происходит подкручивание шарниров мнимого бинокля, поиски фокуса. 7 Once that movement of the screw has been effected, the invisible land begins to loom large; the voyage to that other land of the imagination seen through the reverse end of binoculars is then completed.^ The basic tensions of the works to be considered are dependent upon the opposed intentions of communication and dissimulation, where the latter term is surely not to be taken as giving the lie any more than fiction itself is to be understood as being a blatant falsehood. Rather, Oleša simply extends the spectrum of reality to include not only various dream sequences and roman- tic speculation of all sorts, but goes beyond to embrace what is either improba- ble or impossible - but which nevertheless occupies a large place in the mind of the dreamer-hero of the stories. Thus, what might have been and what is never to be are artfully incorporated within a continuum which yields a special kind of vision or understanding of reality. By contrast to the invisible land, there is the "land accessible to normal 168</page><page sequence="3">perception/' where "something different takes place" ("Vse èto proisxodit v nevidimoj strane, potomu čto v strane, dostupnoj normal 'nomu zreniju, proisxodit inoe. . p. 215). That something different is born of a prosaic quality alien to the artistic imagination and is, in effect, accessible to anyone. The world of the imagination, on the other hand, is not open to all potential converts and enthusiasts; rather, it is an exclusive place belonging properly to madmen, dreamers, and romantics. In short, it belongs to Olesa's composite vision of the artist, described as follows ("Ja smotrju v prošloe") : Так создается одиночество - навсегда, одинокая судьба, удел человеку оставаться одиноким везде и во всем. Его называют мечтателем, над ним смеются; он допускает это, он и сам смеется с другими, - и люди объясняют это тем, что он ничтожен, угод- лив, он идет одиноко, втянув в плечи голову, в которой тщесла- вие, высокомерие, самоунижение, презрение к людям, сменяю- щееся умилением, мысли о смерти образуют никогда не утиха- ющую бурю (р. 226) . The Oleàa hero remarks complacently - "Ja puteščestvuju po nevidimoj strane," and in the same innocuous tone asserts - "Ja soveršaju dvojnoj puť" (p. 215). The two linked observations define the type: the "I" of the stories is endowed with the gift of a special vision which enables him to travel two paths at once. First, there are the laws of reality, dictated by the world in which even the dreamer must live and to which all are subject. However, in addition, there are certain dispensations allowed an individual by his own imagination. Hence, the narrator of "The Cherry Pit" walks hand in hand with two "sisters," Attention and Imagination, where the former, it appears, is repeatedly subordinated to the latter - or transformed from a certain "objec- tive" vision into one that is primarily subjective. Similarly, as the narrator, who has adopted the persona of the writer, explains with regard to spectacles in the circus ("Zrelišča") : Такие события составляют предел фантастики. Они наиболее необычайны для нашего земного восприятия, потому что, когда они происходят, перед нами на секунду возникает картина какого- то несуществующего мира с физическими законами, противопо- ложными нашим (р. 276) . It is that non-existent world which occupies the writer. Thus, in one instance, realized metaphor is made part of a character's experience when it is explained that his feet were hanging in the air, that he was flying," and then immediately thereafter, it is asserted ( from a nearby window"!) that he is "Flying on the wings of love" ("Letit na kryl'jax ljubvi," p. 200). Moreover, it is stated earlier the The law of gravity no longer existed" ("Zemnogo pritjažen i ja bolee ne 169</page><page sequence="4">suščestvovalo," p. 199), thereby allowing the student to fly. But how, then, is the appearance of Isaac Newton, who reproaches the young man for defying the laws of gravity ("Vy , kažetsja, segodnja letali, student? . . . Vy, kažetsja, segodnja letali, molodoj marksist? . . . Vy, segodnja, kažetsja, letali?" p. 201) to be reconciled with the fact that his very appearance represents a new breach of other "laws" as well? In effect, we can only assume that the writer asks the reader to regard two "realities" as viable at the same time, in analogous fashion to the character who is himself "following a double path." Within Olesa's fictional realm, however, the peculiar realities of the invisible land are never so accessible as to be perceived by everyone. In "Visnevaja kostočka," as a case in point, the first-person narrator explains: . . .встречный видит человека, идущего по пустынной зеленеющей местности. Но что происходит с этим мирно идущим человеком? Он видит впереди себя свою тень. Тень движется по земле, далеко протянувшись; у нее длинные бледные ноги. . . . тень поднимается по кирпичной стене и вдруг теряет голову. Этого встречный не видит, это вижу только я один (р. 215). Such exclusivity extends in many directions to include numerous peculiar perceptions and odd capabilities. Thus, for example, a hand "thinks" (p. 215); the hands of a clock are transformed into "a fly rubbing its legs together. The restless fly of time. . ." ("Èto muxa sucit łapkami. Bespokojnaja muxa vremeni," p. 216); a lovesick boy is changed into a policeman directing traffic (p. 217); a tree becomes a child ("Èto derevo - moj rebenok ot vas, Nataša," p. 218); a stone shouts ("Podożdi! . . . Posmotri na menja!," p. 21 9); a cherry tree blos- soms in honor of unrequited love" ("v česť nerazdelennoj ljubvi," p. 220); trees offer greetings "with an ovation" ("Derev'ja vstrečajut Lelju ovaciej," p.^ 198); and Isaac Newton appears to listen to "the great silence of nature" ( "Znamenitý j fizik slušal velikoe molcanie prirody," p. 200). In addition, for one color-blind character, pears are blue;another is gifted with a certain immediate per- ception: for him, pits cast onto the earth instantaneously bring forth trees in blossom. By contrast, elsewhere a tramway becomes a rosegarden as a result of an old woman's acute retrospective perception, while the narrator of the story ("V mire"), with his own special vision, perceives that "the silhouette of the old woman s head is heart-shaped."9 ("Siluet staruxinoj golovoj serdeckoobrazen," p. 240) . Moreover, he conceives of her as being a paleontologist rummaging in her memories for an irrevocably lost past, while she blithely explains to her little grand- daughters that, as part of their former property , the moon, too, had once belonged to them. Perceptions are thus refracted one upon another as though through a series of distortion mirrors or prisms, which affect both vision and reason. The world becomes a highly individualized place, determined not by any kind of common view but by some character's highly idiosyncratic vision, which, at a given moment in time, is granted contour and dimension by the creator of the verbal 170</page><page sequence="5">construct of which the character is part. Hence, Oleša's stories repeatedly undercut "reality." Daydreams and imagination are interwoven, leaving the reader uncertain as to where the boundaries lie between "fact" and ''fiction." The problem is frequently left only partially resolved at best - with the invisible land made only ephemerally triumphant in its confrontation with the "new world" of the Soviets. But since imagination figures centrally in the Oleša story, dream and fantasy are given meaning and value in a world given over to the Five Year Plan. And, on occasion, even the Plan will allow for - or incorporate - the dream, as in the conclusion to "Višnevaja kostočka." -Корпус этот будет расположен полукругом, - сказал Авель. -Вся внутренность полукруга будет заполнена садом. У вас есть воображение? -Есть, - сказал я. - Я вижу, Авель. Я вижу ясно. Здесь будет сад. И на том месте, где стоите вы, будет расти вишневое дерево (р. 220). As in the instance just noted, in the Olesa story various constructs of the imagination are interwoven with other planes of experience, making for the general intrigue of the individual works. Moreover, the reader is allowed to participate in what appears to be - through the writer's artifice - the actual process of creation. Thus, it is remarked at the conclusion to one story: "Nužno napisať 'Putešestvie po nevidimoj strane.' Esi i ugodno, vot glava iz 'Putešestvija/ kotoruju sleduet ozaglaviť: 'Čelovek, potoropivšijsja brosiť kamen',"' p. 219). What follows represents a certain discourse from the artist's perspective on the continued writing of the original story but including the incorporated "chapter" at the end. In a sense, we see the artist contemplating his work and determining in what manner it is to conclude. Similarly, in another work ("V mire"), the narrator-writer observes: "Vot uže god, kak dumaju o romane. Znaju nazvanie - 'Niscij (p. 234). Four pages of description and incident later, he concludes: "Vot tak spokojno, v realističeskoj manere, po starinke, xotelos' by mne načat' roman 'Niščij'" (p. 237). On one level, the material amounts to an inserted miniature "novella" within a very short story, whether it be viewed as simply an unintegrated digres- sion or as information obliquely supportive of the story's main concerns. Secondly, it may be regarded as an exemplification of a kind of ars poetica in a minor key or brief explanation of one aspect of the making of verbal art. At the same time, it represents an instance of the author shifting planes from one stated intention to another. Having begun one account, he interrupts the telling to weave a separate web of images by which he ostensibly offers the raw material to- wards the making of another story - which is, all the same, incorporated into the first. Within one tale a new one is superimposed. One level of fiction tempo- rarily yields to another in a potentially unending series of imaginative efforts. In the end, one might say that the world of the "real" is superseded by that of 171</page><page sequence="6">''fictions" in Oleša's vision - or that imagination generates fictions, and these, in turn, model the art-making process. At times, the two worlds are clearly differentiated by various disavowals made to distinguish one level of fiction from another. Thus, the narrators or characters of the different stories remark on various occasions: Письмо это - воображаемое. Я не писал его (р. 220). Я вижу то, чего нет (р. 198) . Так мне представляется (р. 205). Он предался игре воображения. ... Он воображал страшную сцену. То, чего не было (р. 243) . Он воображал картину (р. 212) . In other instances, the invisible land seemingly becomes primary with no clear transition effected back to the world of "real" events ("Kakoj vek? Kakie gody? Gde èto? Ne vse li ravno?" p. 243)- that is, from some apparently secondary level of narration to what had appeared to be the story's original, main concern. Within the invisible land, it would seem, anything can happen (or be per- ceived as happening). A faucet is seen to be "quietly blowing its nose ("Kran tixo smorkalsja," p. 1 91 ). A dying man (like a well-known comic strip character) has only a blanket for company ("Odejalo sidelo rjadom, loži los' rjadom, uxodilo, soobščalo novosti," p. 192). A spider flies away, in that same story ("Liompa"), at a boy's "mere thought of touching it with his hand." ("Pauk uletel pri odnoj mysli mal'čika potrogať pauka rukoj," p. 193). Thus, the normal laws of cause and effect are temporarily suspended or rearranged. A feeling of unrequited love transforms a lonely, disillusioned young man into a policeman directing traffic. At one point, he thinks that all that is necessary to make the transformation complete is for a nightstick to emerge from his hand. And, a moment later, one indeed materializes. This is followed by the observation: "Какое strannoe skreščenie mira praktičeskogo i voobražaemogo" (p. 217). The remark is emblematic of both the art and the method by which it is made: the crossing of the real with the imagined, giving each equal credence and presumed viability. In essence, the lavish intersecting of the two worlds is accomplished through complex transformations of imagery. Архитектура летания птиц, мух, жуков была призрачна, но можно было уловить кое-какой пунктир, очерк арок, мостов, башен, террас - некий быстро перемещающийся и ежесекундно дефор- мирующийся город (р. 196) . As the writer explains in another context: "Lines came together and spread out around him. . . Suddenly an optical illusion appeared (". . . slagalis' i raspredel jal is' linii. . . Polučalsja vdrug svetovoj fokus," p. 193). Such is the method by which the Olesa story is made: lines and dots become reorganized into new and startling 172</page><page sequence="7">configurations, while the resultant illusory aspect takes temporary precedence over the ''real/' Thus a character may simply wake up "in a new world'' (p. 199), where a seemingly endless process of transformations is rendered possi- ble and even probable: ". . . na meste padenija kostočki vozniklo derevo, tonkoe, sijajuščee derevce, čudesnyj zont" (p. 198). In this instance ("Ljubov"'), a pit is instantaneously and miraculously transformed into a tree, which - through the agent of poetic vision - is itself perceived as "a wonderful umbrella." In the same story, the spine of a sleeping girl "looked like a slender reed" ("'Udočka,' podumał Šuvalov , 'bambuk,'" p. 199). The transformations emer- gent from the artist's crucible appear endless. Again, as a kind of brief ars poetica, the writer explains how in a world of "double existence" - the one "ordinary, everyday, completely insignificant," the other of "night-time" significance - "the laws of this new world" may take over "five minutes before plunging into sleep." Внезапно подступив вплотную, части узоров увеличились, детали- зировались и изменились. На грани засыпания, близкий к детским ощущениям, он не протестовал против превращения знакомых и законных форм, тем более что превращение это было умили- тельно: вместо завитков и колец он увидел козу, повара. . . -И вот скрипичный ключ,- сказала Леля, поняв его. -И хамелеон. . .- прошепелявил он, засыпая (pp. 198-199). Upon awakening, the character experiences further such transformations but of a less soothing nature. Теперь Шувалов боялся подумать о чем-либо страшном. "В комнату вошел тигр" - готов был подумать он против желания, но успел отвлечь себя от этой мысли. . . Однако в ужасе посмо- трел он на дверь. Материализация произошла, но так как мысль была не вполне оформлена, то и эффект материализация полу- чился отдаленный и приблизительный: в окно влетела оса. . . она была полосата и кровожадна. -Леля! Тигр!- завопил Шувалов (р. 199) . Here the tiger of his fears is brilliantly transformed into a far less frightening creature by the creative vision which informs the invisible land. Yet, signifi- cantly, when Šuvalov cries out, he all the same refers to the wasp as a tiger, thereby testifying to the vitality of that vision and to the fact that the percep- tions generated by it will, for the moment at least, triumph over the mundane. In all such instances, the pattern is essentially the same: imagination generates fictions. Generally, the imagination at work will ostensibly belong to a given character, but the way in which that character's particular fictions are mani- fested ultimately defines or reveals the process by which art is made. Thus, 173</page><page sequence="8">as Šuvalov remarks in wonderment: "Proisxodit kakaja-to erunda. Ja nacinaju myslit' obrazami. DI ja menja perestajut suščestvovať zakony" (p. 1 98). In short, thinking in images leads to the formation of new images, and such trans- formations are at the core of the art-making process as envisioned and projected by the writer of the stories. Hence, the principle of integration of the two worlds - the invisible land and its more mundane counterpart; that is, of the two juxtaposed fictions- depends upon and is defined by the transformation of imagery. Equivalencies are established from the world of seeming reality to that of fiction and back again. Such equivalencies are accomplished through the alternation between two kinds of perception. At times these are realized in the form of dream sequences as opposed to "waking" realities. The former are common within the Oleša story, where one dream is seemingly contained within another making for a "framed" series of illusions by which reality appears to dissipate ("Prorok"). Moreover, to make viable these complex transitions from one level to another, the composite hero of the stories is himself endowed with the ability to pass through a series of fantasies, as well as from dream to reality, with as much facility as if one were passing through a series of revolving doors. In certain instances, the realm of the imagination is momentarily "appropri- ated" by the persona of the poet-narrator who, for example, in describing the last moments of a dying man, relates ("Liompa") : К вечеру у него начинался бред. Флакон смотрел на него. Рецепт тянулся, как шлейф. Флакон был бракосочетаюшейся герцо- гиней (р. 192) . Here anthropomorphism and simile yield a striking, entirely new image. Such revivifying imagery achieves the generalized function of allowing the reader "to see the world anew." At the same time, the repeated transformation of imagery produces - depending upon the subjective view of the reader - either distortions or agreeable illusions. In any case, it presents a vision of the world whose relations are to some degree altered - presumably for the better. Thus, the final, all-embracing transformation is noted by the innocent dreamer-hero Suvalov ("Ljubov"'), who declares in a moment of bedazzled yet clear vision: "Čto že mne delať? Zemlja prevratilas' v raj" (p. 201). 10 The remark might well be emblematic of the poetic vision informing the stories and of the manner by which the bland is transformed into the splendid. For in giving equal credence to both the invisible land and that "accessible to normal perception," the writer is establishing within his own aesthetic framework the validity of the creative artist's special domain - the realm of imagination, which serves, in one sense, as his source of creativity, but which, ideally, is realized in the completed work of verbal art. Finally, the mechanism by which the artist's transformation of imagery is 174</page><page sequence="9">accomplished may be explained as follows. First, in verbal art the word is, of course, the main constituent element. It is considered to bear potential meaning on two levels - the concrete and the figurative - and is also regarded as bearing a main denotative aspect as well as possible connotative features. The latter may be highly particularized or idiosyncratic, offering a special meaning for a given individual. Since the literary work as a whole is composed of this main constituent element (the word in all of its nuances), the individual artistic images contained within the work are similarly composed. Moreover, the artis- tic image itself must also be viewed as being denotative and potentially connota- tive as well. In other words, in addition to depicting some aspect of a fictional world in a more or less "concrete" fashion, it may also connote some other feature in the form of a related image to the individual perceiver, thus recog- nizing a certain "knowledge of similarities . . . detected among a whole series of objects" (". . . znanie o sxodstvax, zamečennyx . . . meždu celým rjadom pred- metov," p. 214). It is the job of the poet to acknowledge and utilize such poten- tial associations. In the stories under consideration, the writer skillfully reassigns levels by establishing a poetic connotative aspect as primary, while relegating the more prosaic denotative feature to a secondary role. Thus, an apricot pit is transformed into a tree, which in turn becomes an umbrella; a young girl's spine is seen as a reed, a fishing-rod, as bamboo; a wasp reminiscent of a tiger is transformed into one in the mind of the dreamer; a cherry pit connotes a future tree "foreseen" in the present; to an aging grandmother-paleontologist with the gift of hindsight the world is divided between a park and a garden; to a young man in love the world becomes a paradise; while, for the poet, percep- tion of the world is personified by two sisters, Attention and Imagination, who escort the writer-persona through the "invisible land" of the stories. In each case, what is denoted on one plane (as "objective" reality) is connoted on another (as subjective perception or imagination). The blending of the two juxtaposed fictions into a single integrated narrative is Oleša's method by which the attendant imagery is transformed and the individual stories are told. NOTES 1.
