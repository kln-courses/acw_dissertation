<plain_text><page sequence="1">ORCHIDS Encyclopaedia of Cultivated Orchids, by Alex D. Hawkes, Faber &amp; Faber Ltd., London, England, 602 p., 12 guineas ($36). In the early part of the nineteenth cen- tury large numbers of a great variety of orchid species were introduced into England and Europe. They soon caught the fancy of the wealthy and landed gentry, many of which established and maintained large collections. As these collections grew, so did the need for comprehensive, almost encyclopedic, books dealing with orchids. Several such works were published in the past and filled the requirements of early orchidists. Williams' Orchid Growers' Manual was published in seven ever-improving editions, the last in 1894. It was reprinted for use by modern growers in 1961. James Veitch and Sons, of the famous nursery by that name, published a Manual of Orchidaceous Plants in 1894. It included chapters on both horticulture and botany. This was followed by Sander's (of the well- known firm) Orchid Guide in 1901. A number of works of similar nature were published in Europe, including Franz Josst's Beischreibung und Cultur Einer Grossen Unzall Tropischer Orchideen, Prague, 1851. The last comprehensive treatise on the subject is Rudolph Schlech- ter's Die Orchideen published in 1914 (and currently being updated for re- publication in the Spring of 1968). No encyclopedic book on orchids has been published since then. The advance pub- licity of Hawke's efforts suggested that his may indeed be the long-awaited mod- ern, comprehensive work on orchids. Unforunately, this is not the case. The Encyclopedia purports to deal with all, or most, cultivated orchids and be the most comprehensive and bot- anically accurate work on the orchid ever written." Sadly, it is probably neither. Possibly the book touches upon the great majority of cultivated orchids, but much space is devoted to genera and species which are not found in cultivation (for one example of many, see Diceratostele, p. 169). But there can be no doubt that botanical accuracy is completely lacking from it. The author seems to equate bot- any with classification and taxonomy and completely ignores or is ignorant of all other aspects of plant science. "An Introduction to the Orchids" es- sentially opens the book and strives to ex- plain this rather complex family in a total of 3/2 pages. The results are, of course, disastrous because the reader is not even given an inkling of the complex and interesting aspects of orchid mor- phology, anatomy, heredity, physiology, biochemistry, ecology, pollination, evolu- tion, etc. In addition, the introduction is written rather poorly and is replete with errors, ambiguous statements, and ex- clamation marks. Perhaps the most dis- turbing bit of nonsense can be found in a footnote appended to the statement that "orchids are perennial herbs. .. ." The footnote tells us that "Zeuxine strateu- matica appears to be the only annual orchid known . . . to botanists" and that "certain other incompletely known ter- restrial species may well prove to be of only annual duration under special condi- tions" (italics mine-J. A.). Perennation in Z. strateumatica is by specialized un- derground branches which grow into green shoots at the advent of the next growing season. A detailed description of this interesting phenomenon was published 35 years ago (Joshi, A. C. 1933. J. Indian Bot. Soc., 12: 20-23-) and although the synonym Z. sulcata was used (Holttum, R. E. 1957. Flora of Malaya, 1: 133), it is only reasonable to expect that the author of the "most accurate" book on orchids ever written would be familiar with all of the literature and synonymy of his subject. The second part of the footnote is even more nonsensical when one con- siders its anthropomorphic, Lamarckian, Lysenkoist, or teleological implications in addition to the complete lack of evidence for it. The Introduction maintains its mediocrity throughout but never really drops below the level of its second foot- note, maybe because this is not possible. June 1968 527 527</page><page sequence="2">The Genera and Species of Cultivated Orchids is listed as a purely horticultural description of a great number of genera and species. This section is not bad if one can wallow through the author's unique nomenclature. The Check List of Orchid Genera, in which he lists what he con- siders valid names and synonyms, may be of some help to those trying to unravel the maze. Culture instructions are not always clear, and at times useless. For example, we are told that Oreorchis Ldl. should "presumably be cultured like Corallorrhiza (Haller) R. Br." (which according to the far more authoritative Generic Names of Orchids by Schultzes and Pease should be spelled Corallorhiza). But one finds only a short discussion of why Coral- lorhiza cannot be maintained in collec- tions. Time after time "presumable" culture methods are provided for genera not found in collection. There is "information" about three genera: Cordanthera L. O. Wms., Cordiglottis J. J. Sm., and Coruna- stylis Fitzg. Many other genera and species listed are not in cultivation, e.g., Dicera- tostele Summerh, Neobolusia Schltr., and Pleurothallopsis Porto and Brade. On the other hand, several orchids which are widely cultivated in England, such as Pleione formosana have been omitted. Some of the descriptions of genera and species may at times be helpful, but many are meaningless in their generality and lack of critical diagnostic characters. The description of Aceratorchis Schltr. pro- vides an example: "Two apparently valid species of Aceratorchis are known to sci- ence, these rather inconsequential ter- restrial orchids of the subtribe Haben- arinae, which are possibly better referred to as Orchis (Tournef)L. They are native to China and at this time unknown in our collections. Nothing has been ascer- tained regarding the genetic affinities of this rare group. Culture: Possibly as for Orchis, the temperate zone Habenarias, etc." Similar nonsensical statements can be found regarding Adenoncos Bl., Centro- glossa B. R., Herpysma Ldl., Monosep- alum Schltr., Phymatidium Ldl., Risleya King and Pantl, Thylacis Gagnep, and many others. Zeuxine Ldl. is artfully de- scribed as "Rather simulating narrow- leaved species of Anoectochilus in most instances, and differs from the allied gen- era-Eucosia B1 and Myrmechis Bl-in technical detail of the typically very small, but complicated flowers." We are not told what any of these flowers look like, but we can learn that Eucosia BI simulates Anaectochilus "but they differ in critical detail of the small flowers." The follow- ing on Myrmechis B1 can be found: "It is somewhat allied to Zeuxine ... , but differs ... in its typically solitary, or paired flowers, the technical structure of which is divergent." It is obvious that different species do differ from each other in tech- nical or critical details, but the reader is not told what they might be. Nomenclatural inaccuracies appear throughout the book, obviously due to lack of familiarity with the literature. One example is the "little known and misunder- stood" genus Pachystele Schltr., which is well known to competent orchidists who have placed it in Scaphyglottis Peoppig and Endicher (Williams, L. 0. 1951. Ceiba 2(3): 202-208; Ames, 0., and D. S. Correll, 1953. Fieldiana: Botany, 26(2): 429-442; Garay, L. A., 1966. Am. Orch. Soc. Bull., 35(5): 390-392). The confusing statement "Nothing is known of the genetic affinities . . ." keeps recurring in the description of many gen- era. It apparently means that no informa- tion is available on the cross-breeding potential of the genus in question. Un- fortunately, however, like so many other statements in the Encyclopaedia, this state- ment is not always reliable or correct. For example, we are told that "No hybrids are known in Nigritella," but Gymnigritel- la is listed as the natural hybrid of Gymna- denia X Nigritella. The first Gymnigritella hybrid was described in 1787 as Orchis suaveolens but was reclassified as Gymni- gritella in 1892 and illustrated in Camus' iconography of European orchids in 1921 (Garay, L. A., and H. R. Sweet, 1966). Such scattering of information is not at all uncommon in orchids, but anyone pur- porting to produce "the most accurate" work on the subject should be familiar with all the facts. The Orchid Authorities, a listing of ab- breviations and full names of botanists who have named orchids occupies pp. 499- 502 and is followed by a check list of Orchid Genera. An incomplete list of Mul- tigeneric Orchid Hybrid Groups (for an excellent up-to-date treatment of this sub- ject see Garay, L. A., and H. R. Sweet, 1966). Bot. Mus. Leaflets, Harvard Uni- versity (21(6): 141-212) is followed by an index to Multigeneric Orchid Hybrid Groups and a glossary of botanical terms. A two-page Appendix covers matters which have come to the author's atten- tion after the Encyclopaedia had been set up in print. Most of it is devoted to po- lemics and self-aggrandizements. It also in- cludes a call to readers who have "particu- larly extensive reference libraries" to de- cide whether certain invalid nomenclatural combinations by the author are valid. The simple truth is that they are invalid due to earlier published studies (V. S. Summer- hays, 1964. Orch. Rev., 72: 88). The author should have known that. The index is most extensive and con- tains a list of phonetic pronunciations. Un- fortunately, the latter represent only the author's idea of what the Americanized- English version of each name should be and these are not necessarily accepted by orchidists in non-English or even English- speaking countries (Summerhays, V. S., 1966. Orch. Rev., 74(872): 46-48). Ac- cording to a noted South African orchidist, Disa Berg should be pronounced with the i as in like whereas here we are told that dee-zah is "correct." Also, Leochilus is pronounced in England (where the book was published) as lee-o-kye-lus and not lee-ok-i-lus as suggested in the Encyclo- paedia (Summerhays, V. S., 1966. Orch. Rev. 74(872): 46-48). The illustrations, which are mostly bor- rowed from other sources, at times without permission (Garay, L. A., 1966. Taxon, 15(5): 197-199 and Am. Orch. Soc. Bull., 35: 390-392), are generally good, but there are exceptions. Color Plate Ilb appears to be of a Catasetum oerstedii Rchb. f. with wilted sepals. Several of the illustra- tions are black and white reproductions of a series of color plates by G. C. K. Dun- sterville, published and distributed by Shell Oil Co. of Venezuela to a fortu- nate few several years ago. A comparison with the originals shows that Schomburgkia undulata Ldl. has been mislabeled as Laelia undulata Ldl (L. O. Wms.), wher- eas Oncidium bicolor Ldl. is erroneously listed as 0. varicosum Ldl. In both cases the original publication discusses these species and carefully points out their cor- rect nomenclature. One can point to many more deficien- cies in the Encyclopaedia, but this would be an obvious waste of time and space. It is not an accurate botanical and scientific work. A purely horticultural book it may be, but not a very good one. Williams' Manual is at least as good or better than this rather over priced and over ambi- tious Encyclopaedia. A good up-to-date, modern encyclopedic work on orchids has long been needed. It still is, perhaps more than ever before. JOSEPH ARDITTI University of California, Irvine</page></plain_text>
