<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPINOZA'S THEORY OF MIND Spinoza has told us that knowledge of the union that the mind has with the whole of nature is the true and highest good (De In tellects Emendatione, ed. Van Vloten and Land, p. 6). That union (Ethics, II, Prop. XIII) consists in the body's being the object of the idea constituting the mind; or as stated slightly differently (e.g., at II, Prop. XIX),1 the mind's being the idea itself or the knowledge of the human body. If to interpret this cryptic pronouncement we appeal to the definition of idea as "a conception of the mind which the mind forms because it is a thinking thing," then mind turns out to be a conception which the mind forms of the body. This looks deplorably circular. Let us go at it more obliquely. I. The Division of Man Man is composed of mind and body (II, Prop. XIII, Cor.). Spinoza defines neither mind nor body. If this does not matter about body, which "exists as we perceive it," it is otherwise with mind, which in philosophy is a theoretical term. The distinction of these components in man is not obvious to perception, nor is it unam biguously marked in ordinary discourse, nor do philosophers who make the distinction agree on how to make it and what is to go on each side. In considering Spinoza's use of the word mind it is not much help to notice that the mens of the Ethics is evidently the same as the ziel of the Short Treatise, for the soul presents at least as many problems of circumscription as the mind does. Perhaps Spinoza's shift of terminology between the two works is explained in the re mark after the definition of Mens in the Principles of Cartesian 1 References in the paper beginning simply with a Roman numeral are all to The Ethics.

MATSON Philosophy ( VL page 118) : "I speak here of Mind rather than Soul, for the latter is equivocal and often misused as a name for a bodily thing/' But Spinoza would not accept the definition (or rather, theory) there given: "Substance in which thought inheres im mediately, is called Mind"-and even if he did, it would not help us. Before we can try to state Spinoza's theory of mind clearly, we need to know what comprised the denotation of the term for him. A survey of the Ethics shows that the mind, in general, acts (II Def. 3) and suffers (III 1); more particularly, it forms conceptions (II Def. 3); perceives (II ll C) the body and what happens in it (II 12,13), as well as the nature of many other bodies (II 16 C 1); remembers (II 17 C); knows itself (II 23) and the body (II 19) in a way, but in another way does not (II 23, 24), yet has adequate knowledge of God (II 47); imagines (II 17 S); affirms and negates (II 49 S); and restrains the affects (III 56 S). We are told explicitly that the mind does not form images (II 17 S), nor move the body (III 2; nor is the mind moved by the body), nor tremble or laugh (III 59 S). This list is not consonant with ordinary English usage, nor, I daresay, Latin. We may say of a man that he has an active mind, but we do not construct such sentences as "my mind perceives my body," "my mind knows the nature of yonder tomato," "my mind re strained my lust," nor even, pace Descartes, "my mind is now think ing." In fact, a single instance is hard to find in which the word mind occurs straightforwardly as the subject of a transitive verb of action in the active voice. To point this out is not to reproach Spinoza for sins against language, but to show that he does use the word as a term of art whose meaning we must not suppose we know just because we pronounce the vocable every day. The list is, however, a typical (incomplete) philosophical inven tory of "the mind's operations." Perceiving, conceiving, remember ing, knowing, imagining, affirming-why do philosophers pick these out to form a special list from which they exclude inspecting, com posing, testifying, narrating, laughing, swearing, and digesting? They think of the former as constituting a natural class. What is its defining characteristic? To this question various answers are given, each of which supplies the substance of a "theory of mind": (1) that</page><page sequence="3">SPINOZA'S THEORY OF MIND 569 they are private; (2) that they are the immediate operations of the mind; (3) that they are the varieties of consciousness; (4) that they constitute the domain of the predicate "is certain of." But as for Spinoza, (1) he expressly rejects privacy (II 3); (2) he does not al low for any mediate operations of the mind with which these might be contrasted (III 2); (3) he does not make consciousness a neces sary condition for mind (II 12 would otherwise be incredible), nor even a sufficient condition (III 59 S); and (4) he utterly rejects skepticism (III 10 et passim). But the items in the Mind Hst have a negative characteristic in common: they are evidently not motions nor reducible to motions. They are human activities (or at any rate it is natural and tempting to use this word about them-they are at least happenings, changes of some sort) that do not involve gross, observable movements of the tissues. This is perhaps the real underlying rationale for the division between the mental and the physical that philosophers have drawn even when their official descriptions are in terms of other fea tures. Motionlessness easily accounts for privacy: any outward sign, by which you might detect my thoughts, is necessarily a motion. But I can think without moving. And that, it seems, is all I can do with out moving; thought and privacy are co-extensive. Having established this equation, other human activities such as piano-playing, lecturing, and fighting, which do include motions, and which seem to the naive observer to be unities (hence "I lec ture," etc.-neither "my mind lectures" nor "my body lectures," much less "my mind and my body join in lecturing"), are philosophically analyzed into two parts, one the bodily motions, the other the mo tionless/"conscious" accompaniments. This is the way Spinoza divided up mind and body, as appears from his making motion and understanding the immediate infinite modes of the attributes of extension and thought respectively (KV, Chapter 9)-indeed it is clear from the very distinction of the two attributes themselves. Understanding must here be taken as the name of the class of all items of reality, that can come within our cognizance, that are not particular modes of the infinite mode of motion and rest. Thus it includes feeling and willing, for example, and as we have noticed already, it is not limited to items of con sciousness.</page><page sequence="4">570 WALLACE I. MATSON IL The Mind-Body Problem Actions of the one class impinge on those of the other in almost everything a man does. But philosophers, including Spinoza, have concentrated their attention on two types of situations: sense percep tion and willing. To describe these as neutrally as possible: sense perception is when movements of the world exterior to my body induce motions in my body, particularly in the eyes and other sense organs, and concomitantly with these motions there occurs an awareness of some sensation or feeling. Willing is when I decide to do something-this deciding is an identifiable feeling, or if that is not the right word, at least it is an awareness-and shortly after wards the appropriate muscles move to initiate the action decided upon. Yet these descriptions are far from neutral-we don't use such words as sensation, feeling, and awareness in these ways, not be cause philosophy is so strange to us, but because this division is. Be that as it may, the happenings on the physical side are ( and already were in Spinoza's day) in broad outline, subjects of uncontroversial knowledge. Spinoza expounds the physiology of sense perception in terms of a change in the body's proportion of motion to rest, brought about by external causes impinging on the sense organs, the change being propagated ultimately to the central nervous system (II 14 and preceding lemmata; KV, Appendix 2). In vision, an image is formed inside the body; but Spinoza warns us emphatically (II 48 S, II 49 S ) not to confuse images, which are physical, "formed of bodily motions alone," "at the back of the eye, or, if you please, in the middle of the brain," with ideas, which are thoughts and not pictorial. Spinoza had no need to discuss the physiology of voluntary action, which, once we get beyond its putative mental precursors, is if anything more straightforward in its physiology. The Mind-Body Problem, generalized from such commonplace examples, may straightway be put as: How are those human activi ties that are not motions related to those that are? (For reasons men tioned above, Spinoza would rej'ect the commoner but less perspicu ous formulation, How is consciousness related to bodily activity?) But before going ahead to the philosophical theorizing, let us ask what need there is for it. Leaving aside the historically decisive</page><page sequence="5">SPINOZA'S THEORY OF MIND motive, the desire to provide a separable personality to survive death, is there any reason not to be content with physiology? We want an explanation of sense perception. Why is it not enough to do the best we can to describe how the cornea, tympanum, taste buds, nerves and brain all do their work? That would be like the way we explain earthquakes, supernovas, and digestion. Why can we not set out the ascertainable facts, add "-and that is what seeing (smelling, thinking, deciding) is.", then stop? What would be left out? Some philosophers have held that indeed nothing would be left out, that the physiological explanation is in principle complete. Rejecting the distinction between bodily motions and other human activities, they postulate micro-motions under the skin as the puta tively private happenings. There can be no change of any kind that is not at bottom a motion of bodies, they hold. Significantly, they are accused of denying mind. But many will agree that Hobbes, the foremost advocate of this view, in the very act of stating it exposed its inadequacy: "All which qualities called sensible, are in the object that causeth them, but so many several motions of the matter, by which it presseth our organs diversely. Neither in us that are pressed, are they anything else, but divers motions; (for motion, produceth nothing but motion.) But their appearance to us is Fancy . . ." (Leviathan, Chapter 1.) For the Malmesburyan philoso phy (so they say) here is forced into making two correlative distinc tions in violation of materialist principles: the first, between motion and its appearance, the second, surreptitiously, between the us who are matter in motion and the us to whom the appearance of motion is "Fancy." And any attempt to make the appearance and the deutero-us into motions would generate a vicious regress. So, they conclude, physiology is not enough. Only philosophy can make the Mind-Body relation intelligible. Spinoza did not deem reductive materialism worthy of dis cussion. In two passages of The Improvement of the Understanding the notion "that there are bodies which, by their composition alone, give rise to intellect" is offered as a specimen of obvious falsity; and he tells us that "when we know the nature of the soul, we cannot imagine it as square, though anything may be expressed verbally." In the Short Treatise (Part II, Preface), seeking an appropriate categorical pigeonhole for the soul by exhaustive division, he says</page><page sequence="6">572 WALLACE I. MATSON that soul "cannot be a mode of extension, because, etc."-which is the via brevissima in refutations. Spinoza has nothing to say about reductive idealism. Now if not everything is matter, nor mind, the possibility still remains that the two exhaust reality between them. And if the Mind-Body Prob lem is a genuine problem, the dualist solution of Descartes is perhaps the solution that presents itself with maximal obviousness, and has the greatet immediate appeal. Thus Spinoza, who generally eschews polemics, devotes two fairly long passages (III 2 S and V Preface) to its demolition. The attack is focused not on the doctrine of two substances, from which his own view might be thought to differ only subtly and minimally, but on the speculations concerning interaction. Thus Descartes has the honor (I use the word without irony) of being the only philosopher of Spinoza's era to be discussed by name in the Ethics. It suffices against the pineal gland to set out the hypothesis in deadpan summary. In III 2 the target is not an ex clusively philosophical theory but the monarchical model of man, which, though perhaps originated by philosophers and theologians, has passed into the common consciousness. After denying the pos sibility of interaction in III 2, Spinoza in the scholium battles against our habit of conceiving deliberate action as analogous to command and obedience (or rebellion). He is particularly concerned to abolish this kind of thinking because of the support it affords to the doctrine of free will. He repeats his anti-libertarian argument from I Ap pendix, that we believe we are free only because we are ignorant of the causes that determine the mind. Proceeding to observe that we are ignorant likewise of "what the body, without being deter mined by the mind, can do . . . from the laws of nature alone, in so far as nature is considered merely as corporeal," he instances the amazing feats reported of sleepwalkers. This indecisive empirical argument should be read ad hominem, for on Spinoza's own prin ciples the separation of body from mind for a method-of-agreement experiment is necessarily out of the question. The passage is addi tional evidence that Spinoza did not equate mind and consciousness. III. Mind and Body as Attributes From his rejections we can infer that Spinoza recognized two necessary conditions of an adequate theory of mind: 1. It should be nonreductive: mind is not really matter, nor is</page><page sequence="7">SPINOZA'S THEORY OF MIND 573 matter really mind. "The [material] object has nothing of Thought, and is realiter different from the Soul." KV, Appendix 2. "Man is composed of mind and body." (II 13 C.) 2. It should reject interaction: "The body cannot determine the mind to thought, neither can the mind determine the body to motion nor rest, nor to anything else, if there be anything else." (III 2.) These conditions imply psychophysical parallelism, which in deed seems to be the express content of the master proposition II 7, "The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things." We may thus be tempted not to take seriously Spinoza's insistence that mind and body are not substances but attributes of one substance, especially when we remember that not only substance but each attribute of substance must be "conceived through itself (I 10). And after all, Spinoza himself apparently once used the words substance and attribute synonymously (KV, Chapter 7). If we see clearly that thought and extension have "nothing at all in common" (KV, Chapter 2), it seems merely verbal to explain their union by averring that they are united in God-like saying that parallel lines meet at infinity. Anyway, if you are going to insist on this device, why not make the connection of mind and body to be that of being joint effects of the divine causality-in other words, why not be an Occasionalist and have done with it? And language can be found susceptible of interpretation in such a sense. Nevertheless, these speculations are unprofitable. II 7 S is de cisive: "A mode of extension and the idea of that mode are one and the same thing expressed in two different ways," a dictum re peated at III 2 S. Mind and body cannot determine each other simply because nothing can intelligibly be said to interact with itself. And it is misleading, at least, to speak of "psychophysical parallelism" when the alleged parallels are not separable. The other label that one finds in the textbooks, "double aspect theory," pre sumably derives from the remark just quoted, "one and the same thing expressed in two different ways" ("wna eademque est res, sed duobus modis expressa"). But this says nothing of two aspects, only of two expressions. The difference is important. Two aspects require two observers, or at least two observation points; and what might those be? That is how mythological entities proliferate. But now, what has become of the distinction realiter between mind and body? To answer this question we need only to take seri</page><page sequence="8">574 WALLACE I. MATSON ously Spinozas doctrine of one substance with different attributes. This is no mystery. Suppose the world were the infinite Library of Borges: we could describe it, Spinozistically, as one substance with two attributes, typography and meaning-which would be to say, we could give a complete description of the library in exclusively typo graphical terms, and another complete description in terms of mean ing. Typography and meaning are distinct realiter, and it is nonsense to talk of one causing the other; yet a book is not an assemblage of two things, (1) letters and (2) meanings. Rather, the meaning is the idea of the typography. This analogy is intended to be suggestive rather than exact, since meaning is a relation (involving a mind), hence cannot be "conceived through itself." (But later I shall suggest that perhaps neither can mind.) To take a more prosaic example: a world of individual material objects, with no variations in density. This would be one nature with at least two attributes, volume and mass. Given the volume of any thing, we could determine its mass, and vice versa; changes in the one would correspond exactly to changes in the other (cf. e.g. II 17 C, Demonstration, etc.); yet there would be no interaction between the attributes. It is nonsense, moreover, to speak of the length of mass or the shape of inertia. There would be, in short, a functional but not a causal relation between the attributes. And that is how Spinoza conceives mind and body. Formally, then, the substance-attribute scheme affords adequate terms in which to conceive the union of mind and body. But we are still far from understanding the particular nature of their relation. IV. Mind: The Idea of the Body Spinoza says that the mind is an idea (or rather, II 15, a com posite of many ideas; but it is convenient to follow Spinoza's usage of the singular number). The object of the idea is the body "and nothing else" (II 13). Some have taken this to express the paradox that my mind perceives only my body-a position that might be called psychophysical solipsism. This is a misunderstanding. Spinoza repeatedly reminds us that the human mind can be aware of external bodies only through their effects on the perceiver's body (II 14-29, passim), and he expresses this notion, as so many philosophers do, in an alarming and pessimistic manner: "The ideas we have of external bodies</page><page sequence="9">SPINOZA'S THEORY OF MIND 575 indicate the constitution of our own body rather than the nature of external bodies" (II 16 C 2); "the idea of each affection of the human body does not involve an adequate knowledge of an external body" (II 25); all our perceptual knowledge, whether of external bodies, our own body, or even of our own mind, is "mutilated and confused" (II 29 C). Nevertheless Spinoza allows us, though grudg ingly, to perceive "the nature of many bodies" (II 16 C 1). What is this perception? The tomato works on me, producing an image-an affection of my body, a change in the ratio of motion to rest, a physical happening. The idea of this affection is not some product of the affection, nor yet a miraculous counterpart, but the affection itself under the attribute of thought. It is necessary to emphasize the point: there is no process whereby the affection of the body gives rise to an affection of the mind; there is no mental receiver, bringing in the broadcast from the physical transmitter; still less is there a ghostly observer of interior theatricals. Nor yet are there two parallel processes; there is only the bodily process and the idea of it-roughly, as there are the letters CAT and the mean ing they convey; or as when a governor mechanism whirls faster, the configuration changes so that the weights are farther from the center and the moment of inertia increases. Neither the physical process nor its idea need terminate once the tomato has been recognized. Appropriate bodily organs and members may be caused to salivate and grasp; on the mental side the will may come into play, and from the affirmation "There's a tomato" I may proceed to the volition "I have to have that tomato." But (II Axiom 3; II 49 and Corollary) a volition is only a variety of afiirmation, it is an idea. Indeed there are no separate mental faculties at all, there are only species of ideas. Not only is the notion of volition assimilated to that of afiirmation, so is that of "affect," or, in later terminologies, passion or emotion. (III, general definition of the affects.) Spinoza, like Schopenhauer, makes will or appetite to be the very essence of man (III 9 S) and indeed of all things. But he turns Schopenhauer around: will is explained as idea, not vice versa. The difference between the two thinkers on this point, however, may be merely verbal. Spinoza affirms of every thing, man, worm, stick, stone, that it endeavors to persevere in its being (III 6). Its effort to do so is its very essence (III 7); and the essence of every</page><page sequence="10">576 WALLACE I. MATSON thing is its idea (I Definition 4). But Spinoza ascribes consciousness only to human beings and perhaps the higher brutes (II 22). Bearing this in mind, we may make some progress in compre hending the intent of the grand assertion that (II 7) "The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things." For every thing does endeavor to persist in its being; this effort is its essence or idea; hence it is not astonishing but obvious that there is an idea of every thing, and that these ideas duplicate the order and connection of things. It is not yet so obvious what the idea of a tomato (in this sense) has to do with what I think of as a tomato; and what it means to say that the mind is the idea of the body. We can now essay answers to these questions. The tomato is not a conscious being, but it does endure and endeavor to maintain itself in existence-by which is meant nothing anthropomorphic but only such facts as that it offers some resistance to knives and forks. This endeavor is a sort of rudimentary affirmation of existence. Some of the consequences flowing from this positive characteristic may involve me, e.g., the tomato may be thrown at me. In that case a particular affection of my body results. I am conscious of this affection, i.e., the idea of it forms part of my mind, and it involves a reference to its remoter cause. Thus "my idea of the tomato" comes into being. It is miserably (and doubly) inadequate, but such as it is, it bears some relation to that adequate idea of the tomato which exists in God. Here something should be said about the objection brought against Spinoza that he cannot allow for intentionality. A tomato (they say) is what it is, it has no meaning, it points to nothing beyond itself. Similarly with my body, or any other particular mode of extension. Now if "the order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things," every idea must be as devoid of intention as is its object. But that would be to deny mind. The reply to this objection is to be found in Spinoza's recognition of the affective modes of thought: joy, sorrow, and all the rest that derive from them. Certainly these are intentional; they derive their origin from the idea tout court, just because (so Spinoza holds) there cannot be an affect without an object: that is to say, inten tionality is of their essence. (II Axiom 3; discussion in KV, Appendix 2. ) It is of the essence of the very idea itself as well, for the en</page><page sequence="11">SPINOZA'S THEORY OF MIND 577 deavor to self-preservation stems from self-love (ibid.). So far from not being able to account for intentionality, Spinoza in effect antici pates the definition of mind in terms of that notion. To emphasize this, however, is to expose Spinoza to another fundamental criticism. He insists that each attribute not only can but must be "conceived through itself' (I 10). But it is hard to comprehend how thought can be conceived without reference to an object of thought, and that object, on Spinoza's own showing, must at least sometimes be an extended thing. This difficulty is (it seems to me) insuperable if intentionality is held to be a universal charac ter of thought. But it may be permissible to doubt whether the absolute equality of the attributes is indispensable to Spinoza's philosophy. In all this we should bear in mind Spinoza's warning (II 43 S) that by idea he does not mean "something dumb, like a picture on a tablet," but "a mode of thought, that is to say, intelligence itself." (Cf. II 49 S.) We do not contemplate ideas. Thus to say that the mind is a conception that mind forms of the body, is as harmless a circle as "to be is to be the value of a variable." And "the mind is the idea of the body" says that the mind is (the summation of) the thinking (the afiirming and negating) that a person does-"intelligence itself." This formula, so far from being obscure, suffers from the opposite defect of being so obvious as to be seemingly unhelpful. We knew that to begin with, we say. But did we really? Did we conceive of mind as intelligence itself? or did we go on thinking, at least in our philosophical closets, of the mind as what we are intelligent with? But where is the explanation of consciousness? Where is the solution to the Mind-Body Problem?-There is no Mind-Body Prob lem, Spinoza has told us. Consciousness has been explained in the only way it can be explained-in terms of the body, but functionally, not causally (passim, but see especially V 39). Now we see why it is so hard to find the right label for Spinoza's theory of mind. If a theory of mind is a survey of thinking, willing, feeling, and the like-the natures of these concepts and their inter relations, our powers and limitations with respect to them-then Spinoza's theory of mind is by general consent one of the greatest contributions ever made to human understanding. It is not a rival of some other theory, hence needs no label.</page><page sequence="12">578 WALLACE I. MATSON But if "theory of mind" means psychophysical parallelism, two way interactionism, double-aspect theory, epiphenomenalism, and all that, then Spinoza has no theory of mind. He leaves everything just as it is-in philosophy a feat as difficult as it is rare. WALLACE I. MATSON UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY</page></plain_text>
