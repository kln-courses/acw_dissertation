Langley 539 Prospect Avenue, Rockdiffe Park, Ontario KIM 0X6, Canada Abstract No evidence of writing in the form of inscriptions or documentary records has been found at Teotihuacan, the most populous, urbanized, and mercantile society of its period in Mesoamerica (circa a.d. 500), although it had close contact over several centuries with other cultures that had developed writing systems. What do exist are glyphic signs that form part of the iconography of mural paintings and pottery decoration. Analysis of over a thousand of these artifacts suggests that the Teotihuacanos developed an unusual notational system comprising, at present count, about 120 signs. This article discusses the sign system and the ways in which it was used to supplement the information conveyed pictorially by Teotihuacan art. Teotihuacan, whose massive ruins lie some 30 miles north of Mexico City, flourished during the first centuries of our era. It developed a complex urban civilization, becoming the largest and most populous city of its time in Mesoamerica, the hub of a large trading network, and a major influence throughout the area. It appears to have achieved its preeminence without the benefit of a writing system such as was developed by the con temporaneous Maya and Zapotee cultures. In effect, since the Spaniards first glimpsed the ruins of the city on the eve of the battle of Otumba in July 1520, and despite more than a century of intensive survey and excavation, no inscriptions or other written records of a kind commonly associated with the remains of ancient civilizations have come to light there. By contrast, in scribed stone monuments were among the most notable finds of the early explorers at Maya and Zapotee sites and new dis coveries continue to be made. The absence of commemorative monuments is surprising at a site such as Teotihuacan whose grandiose, awe-inspiring ar chitecture reflects the society's great power. However, our fail ure to find administrative records of any kind is even more astonishing in the light of the ample evidence of bureaucratic control, domestic economic activity, and external trade from which the society derived much of its character and prosperity. There are indeed few examples of even such a basic activity as counting in either the dot or dot and bar systems common in the rest of Mesoamerica, suggesting that Teotihuacan did not par ticipate fully in one of the great intellectual achievements of Me soamerican culture, namely the calendar through which the passage of time and its natural cycles were tracked. A few numerals and possible calendrical signs have been found at Teotihuacan, but they are on portable objects that may have originated elsewhere; consequently, there is as little tangible ev idence of the use of the calendar as there is for writing of the kinds known in other parts of Mesoamerica. This situation cannot be attributed to ignorance since the elite of Teotihuacan had ample access to the literate societies of the Maya and Zapotee. Artifacts of all three cultures and other evidence of contact and exchange are widely diffused, and ex amples of Maya and Zapotee glyphs have been found at Teoti huacan; likewise, typically Teotihuacan signs are incorporated in a few inscriptions in the Maya area and at Monte Alban. Should one therefore conclude that the written records of Teoti huacan do indeed exist, awaiting the moment of discovery? Or was a deliberate choice made at Teotihuacan to forego glyphic writing in favor of other forms of graphic communication? Unfortunately our data are incomplete in that only a frac tion of Teotihuacan's artistic output has been recovered and, more significantly, little perishable material has survived the ravages of time, depriving us of a potential source of informa tion that has been critical to our understanding of cultures such as those of the Mixtee and Aztec. However, the available evi dence—the absence of texts and the wide diffusion of mural painting at the site —weigh heavily in favor of the conclusion that Teotihuacan opted for pictorial forms of visual communi cation in preference to glyphic writing. This would be consis tent with the distinctive character of Teotihuacan art which has been described by Esther Pasztory (1988a:50) as expressing "val ues that are impersonal, corporate and communal." In this art the representation of the individual is subordinated to a stan dardized human image, and both the commemoration of his torical events and the depiction of overt violence appear to be wholly absent. Glyphic writing, on the contrary, was much used elsewhere in Mesoamerica for recording dynastic history, con quest, and commemorative rites and may, therefore, have ap peared irrelevant to the interests and concerns of the people of Teotihuacan. Such a conclusion would raise profound questions about the nature of Teotihuacan's sociopolitical system. For ex ample, what motivated the elite in its choices, what was the role 285</page><page sequence="2">286 Langley of information in public administration and social control, what kinds of information were thought worthy of graphic commu nication, and how did the communications system work? The present article examines the last of these questions in the belief that Teotihuacan art includes a more complex and effective system of symbolic notation than has been generally recognized. It is based in large part on my doctoral research published in 1986. It also draws on important contributions to the subject since that time and includes some preliminary thoughts on the purposes served by the signs and their rela tionship to sign usage in other contemporaneous Mesoamerican cultures. The article begins with an examination of signs in Teotihuacan art and the criteria for identifying those whose us age is notational. It continues with an analysis of the ways in which signs cluster and ends with a commentary on the inter pretation of signs, suggesting that the thematic information that can be deduced from the pictorial imagery with which signs are usually associated is especially useful in determining their mean ing. This contextual information suggests that war and sacrifice are the predominant themes of the notational system. THE NATURE OF TEOTIHUACAN SIGNS The symbolic content of Teotihuacan art has long been recog nized. For example, nearly a century ago Peñafiel (1900:51) noted that the pottery figurines found in great profusion at Teotihuacan often wear distinctive ornaments and items of clothing that denote the civil and military attributes of its citizens and the identity of its deities. Somewhat later, Eduard Seler asserted that what is now called the Storm God insignia demonstrated progress from picture to hieroglyph (1915:428— 429). However, neither lead was followed up systematically and the examination of both attributive codes and glyphic signs re mained for many years a by-product of iconographic analysis. With the passage of time, more attention came to be focused on the signs themselves, and a good deal of information about them has now accumulated. The initial task in analyzing this material has been to deter mine whether the abstract symbols and other motifs of which it is composed form part of a coherent notational system and, if so, the extent of the sign corpus. Since many of the motifs that appear to function as signs depict objects that may occur naturally as part of representational imagery, the first essential was to distinguish between the notational and pictorial use of such motifs. A process of trial and error during the examina tion of many artifacts in a variety of media —mural paintings, decorated pottery, figurines, stone sculpture, and the occasional bone or shell ornament —suggested that a few simple criteria would serve as a reliable guide to the identification of signs and their notational use: (1) that a sign must be compact and ap proximate in appearance to a standardized prototype, (2) that any pictographic sign must be divorced from its natural context, and (3) that the configuration of which the sign is a part must be compatible with the encoding of verbal messages. These criteria have proven effective in identifying signs and their notational uses although they do not provide absolute cer tainty. For example, signs out of their natural context may be decorative rather than notational. Nevertheless, the "notational configuration" criterion is particularly useful and reliable: It in volves both the contextual evidence of possible notational use Figure 1. The tassel headdress. (Figurine fragment in a private collection.) and the truism that notation entails the clustering of signs in patterns that vary with the conventions of the notational sys tem and the substance of the communication. Thus sound scrolls imply either speech or song, and sign clusters affixed to them suggest encoded messages. Another example is provided by the Postclassic convention of rendering toponyms by the as sociation of signs with the images of trees or hills. Ethnographic analogy suggests that the same convention may have applied at Teotihuacan where similar clusters are found. One recurrent problem in identification is posed by the pos sibilities of confusion between attributive codes and notational signs. The attributive usage of pictorial motifs is common at Teotihuacan. Warriors are denoted by the weapons they carry, and priests by their incense bags. Such motifs are also often found as notational signs and one must draw a clear distinction between the two usages in order to understand the notational system and determine the extent of the sign corpus. The need for this distinction is well illustrated by the tassels that often em bellish the headdresses of Teotihuacanos portrayed in the metropolis, at Monte Alban, and in the Maya area. In a semi nal analysis Clara Millón (1973) established that one particular type of tassel headdress was used attributively as the insignia or badge of office of a high-ranking social group with leadership and military attributes and that its presence was always sig nificative (Figure 1). However, not until a two-part inscription, probably a title and either a personal or group name, was found in a mural painting (Figure 2) was there reason to think that its use was also notational. Since then other similar examples of its notational use have come to light at Teotihuacan and Monte Alban. On the basis of the criteria, my 1986 study identifies some 147 notational signs, including variants, in metropolitan Teoti huacan arts. In addition another 82 motifs meet the first two</page><page sequence="3">Forms and usage of notation at Teotihuacan 287 gL _• A Figure 2. Two-part notation. (Detail from a mural painting in the Museum of Art and Archaeology, University of Missouri, Columbia.) criteria but have not yet been confirmed in notational contexts. All these signs and motifs are illustrated and briefly annotated in an appendix to the study, from which a selection of nota tional signs is reproduced in Figures 3 and 4. As a convenience all signs are given simple descriptive names, which are not to be regarded as interpretations of the sign although names may co incide with ostensible meaning in the case of some pictographic signs. Variants of the same sign are given alphabetical suffixes. PATTERNS OF SIGN USAGE As part of the process of sign identification, the imagery on each artifact in the database has been analyzed and recorded on a form devised for this purpose. Every putative sign is noted to gether with the other signs with which it clusters and the pic torial context with which the cluster is directly associated, if there is one. Thus, for example, a pottery vessel might (as in Figure 5) portray a human figure with sound scrolls and asso ciated signs. The record of such a scene takes the form of a hi erarchical breakdown of the data with pictorial contexts and related signs nesting within contexts of greater generality. The signs associated with any context —those in a sound scroll, for example —can be said to cluster fraternally. Such clusters are particularly interesting because, if their use is notational, the juxtaposition of the signs of which they are composed implies a corresponding affinity of meaning. As the analysis proceeded, a great deal of information was accumulated about the clustering of signs, their associations with pictorial imagery, and the constituents and conventions of pictorial composition. Although some of this information is not directly relevant to sign usage, the more we know about Teoti huacan representational arts the more confidently we can inter pret the notational symbolism. Initially, however, the most significant aspect of the analysis was the information it yielded about the patterns formed by sign clusters. The extent of such patterning guarantees that sign use is deliberate and systematic. It is only after the notational hypothesis has been tested by ex amination of the patterns themselves, their repetitions and vari &amp; A Jit &amp; BE Figure 3.

Verification is particularly important in the case of two cat egories of motif, flowers and shells, that are common at Teoti huacan and are used both notationally and decoratively. The presumption of notation is strong if, for example, the motifs occur in sign clusters associated with sound scrolls but on other occasions their usage, though patterned, could equally well be decorative. Repetitive sequences of shells appear in the borders of mural paintings and in bands around the rims and bases of pottery vessels. Little if anything distinguishes these patterns from those of notational sequences, and their status will remain ambiguous pending progress in sign interpretation. In the meanwhile, it can be said that a characteristic of the signs identified in this study is their selective and consistent clus tering in graphic entities that are clearly distinguishable from any related pictorial imagery and their frequent association with contexts that appear, by their very nature, to involve notation. Although the internal patterning of sign clusters is repetitive, their overall structure is varied. What a systematic examination of these uniformities and diversities can tell us about the sign system is the subject of the next section. THE STRUCTURE AND USAGES OF NOTATION Simple Clusters and Vertical Stacks Although their distribution occasionally seems to be random, most Teotihuacan signs cluster in a few well-defined structures. They may be aligned in linear sequences, form two-dimensional arrays of various kinds, or more rarely, appear singly in asso ciation with anthropomorphic figures or natural objects. Each of these structures conveys a specific kind of information and there is, in addition, some correlation between them and differ ent artifact types. Linear sequences, for example, are most com mon in mural paintings and are suited for the expression of consecutive words or ideas. Figure 6. Flowering trees and compound signs, (a) Detail of a mural paint ing, Techinantitla. (After Pasztory 1988b:Fig. VI.3a.) (b) Detail of a mural painting, Tepantitla. (After Pasztory 1988b:Fig. VI. 10.) (Courtesy of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.) The recent publication of a group of mural paintings be queathed to the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco (Berrin 1988) has greatly extended the data available for study. Most of the paintings, remarkable for their preser vation and beauty, come from an apartment compound called Techinantitla. They include excellent examples of sign usage and cluster structure, that were previously poorly represented in the mural corpus. One group is particularly interesting as an illus tration of the importance of patterns of sign usage in the inter pretation of notation. The murals in question depict feathered serpents beneath whose bodies there are flowering trees with single and compounded signs on the trunks (Figure 6). Unfor tunately the murals are incomplete, but in the most comprehen sive study of them made so far, Pasztory (1988b) proposes a hypothetical reconstruction involving nine basic signs and sev eral significant variants. These signs are closely correlated with eight different types of tree, 13 trees apparently being associ ated with each of four serpents. It is thus generally assumed that</page><page sequence="5">Forms and usage of notation at Teotihuacan 289 Figure 7. Examples of compound signs: (a) Bleeding Heart; (b) Flaming Bundle; (c) Bleeding Feathered Eye; (d) Flower-Bone; (e) Arm-Shell-Petals; (f) Blood-Feathers-Bowl. there are 52 trees in all. Although the ordering of the tree/sign clusters in the murals is not entirely clear, the same three clus ters seem always to go together, and the basic pattern therefore implies the alternation of cluster triplets. It has never been sug gested that these clusters should be read sequentially, but we must assume that the pattern of alternation is a significant fac tor in the meaning of the murals. The interpretations that have been offered so far, that the sign clusters are toponyms, patro nyms, deity names, or identify the trees or their properties, do not adequately address this issue. Among the signs associated with the flowering trees are sev eral compounds, perhaps best defined as the fusion of two or more signs to form a new and distinctive visual and connota tive entity (Figure 7). There is no significant difference to the way in which they cluster with other signs, and usage patterns therefore play the same role in their interpretation. An exam ple of this occurs in the Techinantitla murals in which elaborate compound signs appear in close association with a group of processional figures wearing tassel headdresses (C. Millón 1988). Because of these headdresses, this pattern of juxtaposi tion warrants the assumption that the compounds signify a ti tle and either a personal or institutional name (Figure 8). The signs in most compounds are arranged vertically and a similar vertical configuration occurs in several classes of sign Figure 8. Compound signs as possible patronyms.

Storm Cod and martial insignia on sculpture and pottery arti facts. (The Etnografiska Museet, Stockholm, and private collections.)</page><page sequence="6">290 Langley Figure 10. Examples of the Feather Headdress Symbol. (Detail of a mural painting and of champlevé decoration on pottery vessels.) cluster. One that is common at Teotihuacan is an emblematic device known as the Storm God insignia (Figure 9). Ubiquitous in Teotihuacan arts, this deity, the counterpart of the Postclas sic Tlaloc, has both fertility and martial attributes. His insig nia, which appears on shields, stone sculptures, and pottery vessels, is composed of signs either derived from his facial fea tures or otherwise closely associated with him. The signs are stacked vertically in a border of feathers or in a cartouche and appear to invoke his patronage and protection or express alle giance to him. Their frequent appearance on shields and other evidence of the martial attributes of the deity, suggest that they served as emblems of military leadership. A second example of vertical stacking is found in the con text of what 1 have called the Feather Headdress Symbol (FHS), first discussed by Pasztory (1976:121). This motif, consisting of an arrangement of feathers and of other elements, is clearly in tended as a schematic representation of the elaborate Teotihu acan feather headdress. In examples on champlevé pottery vessels, and more rarely in mural paintings, the motif is used as a framework in which a variety of signs are placed vertically (Figure 10). The interpretation of this cluster is uncertain. Pasz tory has suggested that it was a general religious symbol with out the specific calendrical significance it had in some other Mesoamerican cultures. In a recent study, Sugiyama (1989b) has identified the serpentine head that alternates with the feath ered serpent on the facade of the Pyramid of the Feathered Ser pent at Teotihuacan as a zoomorphic version of this symbol and has proposed that it "may have been a symbolic expression of the religious and political power of a dominant institution as sociated with the Ciudadela." As the analysis of the tassel headdress has shown, feathered headdresses worn by anthropomorphic figures are symbols of power and leadership, and the emblematic use of a headdress to express these concepts in either a religious and secular con text would be no more than a natural extension of this sym bolism. One might then expect the signs that cluster within the framework of the headdress to indicate either the kinds of power signified by the FHS or the identity of its beneficiaries. The vertical stacking of signs is also characteristic of several clusters that are particularly associated with the type of ritual censer known in Spanish as the "Incensario-Ofrenda." Typi cally, it consists of an incense bowl with an inverted bowl as lid and a tubular chimney. To this is affixed a superstructure that acts as a support for a human head mask and a variety of decorative pottery ornaments (Figure 11). Among the latter are usually four small rectangular plaques ("mantas" in Spanish), each bearing the same variant of the vertical sign cluster that I have called the Manta Compound (MC). Over 100 mantas in the data sample have been analyzed and reveal a remarkable va riety of detail within a few basic configurations. Figure 12 illus trates the two main types of which the tabular is both more complex and by far the more common. It has four main vari ants distinguished in Figure 12b by the letters A-D. Variant D has a loop at the top level; C has no loop but includes a seg mented quadrilateral; and the remaining specimens are assigned to variants A and B, depending on whether the compound is composed of two or three strata. Though this study does not include a detailed analysis of the signs that form this compound, it is interesting to note that most of them (the triangle, bow, knot, loop, and twisted cord) have strong calendrical associations in other Mesoamerican cul tures in which they form part of the symbolism of the "Binding of the Years" and the "New Fire" ceremony. These associations do not constitute proof that their usage at Teotihuacan was calendrical, particularly in the absence of convincing evidence of other forms of Mesoamerican calendrical notation there, but the possibility of such usage requires exploration as further data become available. One line of inquiry is suggested by the other signs and sign clusters with which the MC is habitually associated. Though it is a coherent entity in its own right, the tabular form of the compound has some form of affix in 65 of the 88 examples in the data sample. This enlarged cluster may either occupy the en tire surface of a manta or appear as a panel enclosed in a car touche on champlevé pottery vessels (Figure 13). The RE and RM signs (Figure 14) predominate in this cluster, being present</page><page sequence="7">Forms and usage of notation at Teotihuacan 291 Figure 11. Incensario-ofrenda. (Private collection.) in 55 cases, the next most frequent affixes being the Rhomboid Eye and the C&amp;B sign. Although the analysis is not yet com plete, it can be said that the signs are consistent with the end of-calendar-round symbolism of the MC and of the butterfly imagery that is so prominent in the composition of the Incen sario. Both are present in the two lateral tablets that flank the recess in which the human head mask is placed. The imagery on these tablets is quite variable, but it is not unusual to find a combination of dartbutts, water/fire signs, and butterfly or avian imagery on the left tablet; butterfly symbolism and nota tional signs are commonly found on the right tablet. Other Sign Sets and Linear Sequences Vertical stacking is the general rule for the foregoing clusters, but there are occasional exceptions in the case of the FHS and MC. Signs, such as footprints or eyed drops, may for example appear on either side of the FHS, and the cartouche that en closes the MC panel on pottery vessels may itself be composed of one or more signs. More radical departures from the rule constitute separate cluster classes of which the best defined is the "four element group" first identified on pottery figurines by von Winning (1958:6-8). Typically this class takes the form of a rectangle divided into four vertical bands, each containing a sign. The four signs alternate and, as von Winning has demon strated, almost invariably represent liquid and fire (Figure 15). Although this cluster has been interpreted as a religious invo cation, solid evidence demonstrates that it is the earliest known Figure 12. Examples of the Manta compound: (a) the "finger" type; (b) the "tabular" type. Figure 13. The Panel Cluster on a champlevé tripod cylinder vessel. (Courtesy of the Museo Nacional de Antropología, Mexico.) expression of what was to become the primary metaphor for war among the Postclassic societies of the Mexican Highlands: Water-Fire or Atl-Tlachinolli as it was known to the Aztecs. The duality of this metaphor is appropriately expressed within the four-part structure of the cluster that also appears in mu ral paintings, notably in the border of the most striking depic tion of warriors at Teotihuacan (Séjourné 1969:P1. 4). However variants consisting of just two signs also appear on pottery ves</page><page sequence="8">292 Langley © O/ 'cp ooo, N v-/ r\ O O/ \0 o/ 10 fnl oj K).»S4Ro o Figure 14.

The "four element" group in a mural painting, Tetitla. seis, and one example has recently been identified on the left lat eral tablet of an incensario that also bears a butterfly and dart butts (Figure 16). An unusual form of sign cluster is characterized by unifor mity of content and extreme irregularity of structure. It invari ably involves permutations among half a dozen distinctive signs Figure 16. Martial symbolism of the left lateral tablet of an Incensario. (Courtesy of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, Mexico.) and a few geometrical motifs and, for this reason, is called the Core Cluster. Its format appears, at one extreme, to be random (Figure 17a), while at the other, it is repetitive and symmetri cal (Figure 17b). In view of this diversity it is difficult to gen eralize about the meaning of the cluster, but of its usage one can say that, like so much of the notational symbolism of Teoti huacan, it appears frequently on incensario adornos and that its primary pictorial association is with butterfly imagery. The repetitive use of a limited number of signs suggests a corre spondingly narrow range of encoded information, although the variety of permutations in the clusters implies variation in the messages conveyed. There are few clues to interpretation in the signs themselves, even though several of them are picto graphic; however, the artifacts on which the clusters appear are suggestive of warfare and death. In one distinctive kind of Core Cluster the signs form a lin ear sequence. In Figure 18a the signs are enclosed in two volutes that flank a raptorial bird. In Figure 18b the cluster lies along one side of the right lateral tablet of an incensario. These two examples are typical of a cluster class that approximates closely to "texts" in traditional writing systems, although the signs are rarely aligned in a precisely horizontal or vertical direction. Most of the known examples are associated with sound scrolls (Figure 19), and this combination of sign with the visual repre sentation of oral communication provides persuasive contextual evidence that sign clusters encode messages. A few similar clus ters fall from the hands of elaborately garbed figures and may represent metaphorical offerings (Figure 20). The corpus of published sign clusters of this kind has been significantly increased by the mural bequest to the de Young</page><page sequence="9">Forms and usage of notation at Teotihuacan 293 Figure 17. The Core Cluster on moldmade pottery adornos: (a) (Courtesy of the Museum of the American Indian, New York.) (b) (Courtesy of the Museum für Volkerkunde, Berlin.) a o * m b Figure 18.

(Courtesy of the Museo Nacional de Antropología, Mexico), (b) Detail of the right lateral tablet of an incensario, (private collection.) Museum (Berrin 1988, see Chaps. IV-VI). As with similar ear lier material, the sign clusters are associated with either human or animal figures in procession. The figures depicted on the walls of a single room closely resemble each other, but major differences appear between the groups of figures in different rooms and structures. By the same token, the sign clusters as sociated with each group of figures are similar, though rarely identical, while major differences of content and arrangement appear between different groups. For example, the sound scrolls associated with the Tassel Headdress murals (C. Millón: 1988) contain only shells and shell-like signs, whereas similar shells in the sound scrolls of the Maguey Bloodletting Ritual murals (Figure 19) are accompanied by other quite different signs. Somewhat similar remarks apply to the clusters enclosed in the falling panels that are usually interpreted as liquid libations</page><page sequence="10">294 Langley Figure 19. A linear sign sequence associated with a sound scroll. (Detail of a mural painting in the Art Institute of Chicago.) Figure 20. A linear sign sequence in a falling panel. (Detail of a mural painting, Tetitla, after Miller 1973:Fig. 324.) although other possibilities, such as either the sowing of seeds or divination by casting, have been suggested. These panels are not as common as sound scrolls in Teotihuacan mural art but they are nevertheless found throughout the site. The falling pan els are usually filled with either multiple dots or a pattern of identical flowers, but occasionally the infixed cluster is more characteristically notational. The apartment compound known as Tetitla is particularly rich in murals containing such falling panels, the largest group of which is located on the walls of the portico of the so-called Jade Tlalocs and in a nearby corridor (Miller 1973:Figs. 301-314, 324-327). REFLECTIONS ON THE NOTATIONAL SYSTEM Signs and Meaning No matter how suggestive the patterns of sign usage in Teoti huacan arts, proof that they are part of a notational system must ultimately rest on convincing interpretations of their meaning. It is not sufficient to show that in certain cases a pic tographic sign may signify the object that it depicts: that is the essence of representational art. A safeguard against error or worse — the fictive interpretations that have plagued the study of early writings — lies in the demonstration that the semantic values of signs remain the same throughout the corpus or that variations are explicable in philological terms. Such a test is not available at Teotihuacan at the present time. In the first place, we do not know the language or lan guages spoken there. The few contemporaneous references to Teotihuacan in the inscriptions of other Mesoamerican cultures can be interpreted in a variety of ways, and the brief discussion of the subject in early Postconquest literature, in Chapter 29 of Book X of the Florentine Codex (Sahagun 1961:191-195), is ambiguous and of uncertain reliability. In one passage, the abandonment of Teotihuacan is said to have involved several distinct political and linguistic groups, among them the Toltec, each with its own leaders. This suggests that Nahua was at that time one of the languages spoken in Teotihuacan, but while lin guists agree on the complexity of the subject, most seem to doubt that the language could have reached the Valley of Mex ico much before the demise of Teotihuacan (Kaufmann 1976: 113). Perhaps the most that can be said of the oral tradition re corded by Sahagun after a lapse of 750 years is that Teotihua can had probably developed into a multilingual and multiethnic society well before its final collapse, a notion compatible with the archaeological evidence of cultural evolution during the site's history and of established ethnic enclaves there. The complications introduced by the likelihood of multilin gualism at Teotihuacan and our ignorance of the languages ac tually spoken there are compounded by the relatively small number of sign clusters now available for study. For example, only about 20 linear sequences associated with sound scrolls have been discovered, and many of these are damaged and in complete. However, several conclusions can be drawn from the available data. First, the heterogeneity of Teotihuacan signs is obvious. Discounting all but the most distinctive variants, some 120 notational signs have now been identified. About three quarters of these are pictographs, representing either man-made or natural objects. The remainder are either geometrical ab stractions or motifs so conventionalized as to be unrecogniza ble in nature. Second, there are evident affinities between many of these signs and elements in the writing systems of Mesoamerican cul tures contemporaneous with Teotihuacan. Although this sub ject has not yet received the full attention it deserves, some signs clearly had a wide currency throughout Mesoamerica during the Classic period. Interlaced Bands, for example, is found in the Maya area (T664), among the Zapotee (Caso's glyph L) and at El Tajin. Other widely diffused signs, whose depictions are vir tually identical regardless of the culture involved, are illustrated in Figure 4 and include the Kan Cross, Quincunx, Saltire, and Footprint. Another group of signs is characterized by concep</page><page sequence="11">Forms and usage of notation at Teotihuacan 295 tual similarity, although the signs may differ greatly in appear ance from culture to culture. Typically this group comprises human and zoomorphic heads, flowers, and sound scrolls. Fi nally, a number of signs unique to, or intimately associated with, Teotihuacan (Figure 3) include trispiral and trilobal signs, human and feathered eyes, nose pendants, signs derived from Storm God imagery, and such characteristic Teotihuacan glyphs as the Trapeze-Ray, the RE, and the RM, as well as many com pounds formed of the foregoing. The way in which Mesoamerican writing systems developed and the influence that they exercised on each other are matters of scholarly debate. However there can be no doubt that there were extensive contacts between the peoples of Mesoamerica, including resident ethnic enclaves in cities such as Teotihuacan, Kaminaljuyu, and Tikal. Precisely how pan-Mesoamerican signs diffused is uncertain but it has long been the practice to trace Teotihuacan influence in the rest of Mesoamerica on the assumption that architectural and iconographic features closely associated with the metropolis were diffused from there. Thus talud/tablero structures, Teotihuacan martial attire and wea pons, and Storm God imagery have all been interpreted as evi dence of Teotihuacan presence or influence, particularly in the Maya area. An important evidential role has been played by a few typically notational signs, such as the Trapeze-Ray, whose singularity and relative rarity in the corpus of Maya iconology make them distinctive and sensitive markers of interaction be tween Teotihuacan and the Maya. The columnar sculpture dis covered early in the 1980s in Group 6C-XVI at Tikal offers a striking example. The top of the column takes the form of a feathered disk commonly found at Teotihuacan. On the two sides of the disk appear quintessential Teotihuacan signs: a Storm God insignia and a bird with atlatl, respectively. These signs also appear in the text on the column otherwise composed of Maya glyphs. On the basis of present knowledge it seems reasonable to ac cept the hypothesis that the writing and notational systems of the Classic period shared some elements but otherwise devel oped independently and that unique elements in the Teotihua can notational system are among the evidence available for tracing its interaction with the rest of Mesoamerica. The situ ation following the demise of Teotihuacan in the eighth century a.d. is rather different. Teotihuacan was no longer able to ex ercise direct influence abroad even if, as is thought, a residual population survived. However, elements of its notational sys tem were transmitted to its successors in the Mexican Highlands in a form more complete and closer to the original than had ear lier been diffused to its contemporaries. This legacy is clearly visible at sites such as Cacaxtla and Xochicalco. A number of Teotihuacan signs also passed into the Toltec culture, and some are found many centuries later in use by the Aztecs. Notation is thus one of the areas in which Teotihuacan might be regarded as a bridge to the Postclassic period, and in studying its sign sys tem, analogical evidence from these later cultures is as worthy of consideration as is that from its Mesoamerican contem poraries. Our ignorance of Teotihuacan's lingua franca is a serious im pediment to the interpretation of its notation. Without know ing the language involved, or indeed if the notation is tied to any specific language, trial and error is the only way to tackle such basic questions as whether the signs are ideogrammatic or phonetic and whether they encode continuous messages or represent the juxtaposition of discrete ideas. In recent years several ambitious attempts have been made to apply just such a method. Thomas S. Barthel has argued that the signs in the clusters associated with sound scrolls and falling panels are graphemes and can be read sequentially in an early form of the Nahua language (1988). Conversely, David Brown (1988) has asserted that both the culture and the lingua franca of Teotihuacan were Maya and that attempts at interpretation based on analogy with the Postclassic cultures of highland Mexico are mistaken. One of the problems with both theses, apart from their incompatibility, is the small corpus of sign clusters available for analysis and the much smaller sample on which the generalizations are based. Although one or the other may be correct, they are at this stage most interesting as exam ples of the hypothesis that the Teotihuacan sign system is nota tional and phonetic, validation of which will require more extensive data and more far-reaching exploration than that un dertaken so far. A rather different application of the trial-and-error method has already been cited in discussing the interpretation of the tas sel headdress and the FHS. It is modest in its objectives, seek ing to determine the general meaning of signs rather than their linguistic value. It uses a variety of means to this end, notably the structure and patterning of sign clusters, the pictographic identity of signs, analogy with other Mesoamerican cultures, and the thematic information that can be deduced from the pic torial context in which the sign appears. Together they offer some hope of progress toward an understanding of Teotihua can notation even though each has its limitations. In the first place, while the meanings of many Teotihuacan pictographs at the visual level are self-evident, some are ambig uous. The so-called Reptile's Eye glyph (Figure 14) is a well known example of this. It clearly depicts a stylized eye, and its long-standing identification with the reptile is based on the su perposed volute that resembles the eyebrow of the typical Teoti huacan serpent. However, the RE does not appear to have any other serpentine associations; the glyph is often found with but terfly symbolism, and Séjourné (1962) is probably correct in be lieving that it represents a butterfly eye and proboscis. The dots that usually appear inside the glyph's cartouche are also ambig uous. It has been argued that they are decorative but such dots function as numerals throughout Mesoamerica and the way in which they are correlated with other elements in sign clusters that include the RE suggest that they are significative in this case and may, in particular, express some form of numerical co efficient. If the interpretation of signs by their visual appearance sometimes poses a problem, a more serious difficulty arises from the more recondite levels of meaning and, possibly, the phonetic values that they may express. The compound in Fig ure 6a illustrates both these points: it has been called a "mask step" but might as plausibly be regarded as a compound of hu man eye, mountain, and rudimentary footprint, of a kind more explicitly depicted in Figure 6b. As to meaning, the sign recalls the recurrent use of the mountain symbol in several Mesoamer ican cultures as an element in toponyms. In Aztec writing, for example, the mountain pictograph (tepetl) expresses a phonetic locative in such names as Chapultepec, "place or mountain of the grasshopper." One cannot be sure on the basis of the avail</page><page sequence="12">296 Langley able data that there was a similar usage at Teotihuacan, but it seems likely. The wide diffusion of identical signs in space and time offers many possibilities for analogical reasoning of this kind. Pro vided that the notorious disjunctions between form and mean ing that may occur among different times and cultures are borne in mind, such reasoning can play a major role in inter pretation. However, experience suggests that the most signifi cant contribution to our understanding of Teotihuacan notation comes from the thematic information to be derived from the pictorial contexts in which signs usually appear and that the combined use of all available techniques is likely to yield the most reliable results. A simple example is presented by the row of linked scrolls (Scroll Chain) that is derived from the image of waves (Figure 4). In a mural at Tetitla this sign forms the border of a mural painting of shell divers (Miller 1973:Fig. 377); it is also associated with fish and other marine creatures in the arts of Izapa, the Mixteca, and Tenochtitlan. Pictographic, an alogical, and contextual information, therefore, all point to the conclusion that the sign denotes a body of water. A more problematical example from a mural painting illus trates both the possibilities and limitations of the method dis cussed above. Figure 20 reproduces a libation in the form of a falling panel with an infix of three signs and several circlets. The first sign, a hand, is the exact counterpart of a Maya glyph (T710) whose generally accepted meaning is "to sprinkle or scat ter," more specifically in the context of blood sacrifice; the cir clets are a Maya symbol for blood or "precious substances" in general. The nose pendant is a typically Teotihuacan artifact of ten, but not exclusively, associated with armed figures. The third sign appears to be the head of a figurine ethnically foreign to Teotihuacan. The whole image and the first sign suggest that some form of offering is here recorded. The other signs are compatible with the idea of a blood sacrifice by a Teotihuacano and involving an ethnic foreigner, but there are other plausible interpretations. For example, Love argues (1987:12) that sim ilar imagery is associated in the Maya area with offerings of substances other than blood, such as incense and ground maize, which would be consistent with the variation in the colors of the circlets —blue, green, yellow, and red. Thus, while the gist of the imagery is clear an exact interpretation of the notation is not yet possible. The Usages of Notation The notion of blood sacrifice at Teotihuacan would have been anathema to scholars a few decades ago. In keeping with a gen eral disposition during the first half of this century to regard Classic period societies as theocratic and peaceable, it was at one time thought that Teotihuacan imagery was essentially litur gical and that most sign clusters represented petitions to the gods for fertility or other favors. On closer examination, how ever, it has become clear that mural painting and the other arts depict a variety of activities that, though they might represent the religious practices of the culture, were nevertheless remote from the image of peace and innocence formerly in vogue. Al lusive references to militarism and blood sacrifice are particu larly prevalent and have provoked a reassessment of the themes of Teotihuacan graphic imagery with significant implications for our understanding of Teotihuacan notation (not to mention the whole social system). Figure 21. Probable victim of heart sacrifice. (Pottery figurine, courtesy of the British Museum.) Perhaps the most striking conclusion to emerge from recent analyses is the prominence of the martial element in Teotihu acan representational art. Figures clad or armed as warriors provide the main graphic evidence. They are often goggled and may wear cotton armour, helmets, or the zoomorphic and tassel headdresses that have been identified as martial attributes; they may wear hip shields or carry shields, atlatls, or darts. They are often associated with either raptorial birds or other zoomorphic imagery, particularly that related to coyotes and butterflies. This imagery also plays a prominent part in the abstract repre sentation of militarism, such as the bird-shield-weapon cluster analyzed by von Winning (1948) and recently identified in the Techinantitla murals (Berrin 1988:Pls. 17-23). An even greater degree of abstraction has already been mentioned in the use of water and fire symbolism to signify war and in the martial in signia derived from Storm God imagery. A closely related theme of Teotihuacan art is illustrated by figures brandishing lithic knives on which bleeding hearts are often impaled. This scene has been convincingly interpreted as the depiction of heart sacrifice and is reflected in a more sym bolic manner in many representations of knives and hearts in the headdresses of human figures, and of blood and hearts in</page><page sequence="13">Forms and usage of notation at Teotihuacan 297 front of the mouths of birds and animals, as well as in abstract compositions involving these same motifs (Figure 7). Although martial and sacrificial imagery can be clearly distinguished, con siderable overlapping in their symbolism suggests that the two themes were inextricably linked at Teotihuacan, as is demon strated by a remarkable mural in the Duke University Museum of Art recently published by Pasztory (1990:Fig. IX) in a study that examines Teotihuacan militarism in the light of such im agery. Curiously, this imagery never includes scenes either of overt violence or of war and its victims such as one finds in the art of the Maya area and in other areas of Postclassic Mesoamer ica. However, this forbearance is not absolute since figurines occasionally depict corpses, at least one of whom appears to have suffered heart extraction (Figure 21). In the past decade the graphic evidence of militarism and sacrifice at Teotihuacan has been dramatically corroborated by archaeological research. As a result of the partial excavation of the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent during the "Proyecto Teotihuacan 1980-82," some 126 individuals are known to have been buried at the time of the pyramid's construction. Most were sacrificial victims, and it is estimated that the total num ber may have been as high as 200 (Cabrera, Cowgill and Sugiyama 1990; Sugiyama 1989a). It is not clear whether these burials represent an isolated episode in the early history of the site or reflect an enduring pattern of social behavior, but it is noteworthy that sacrificial imagery appears in the art of Teoti huacan throughout its latter history. It is also a remarkable fact that almost all the known linear sign sequences are associated with martial or sacrificial symbolism. CONCLUSION If the results of the study of notation at Teotihuacan fall short of precise interpretations of its sign clusters, one can still say that the signs clearly distinguish themselves from the pictorial imagery with which they are usually associated and cluster in patterns that imply the coding of information. Our ignorance of the city's lingua franca complicates this study and may pre clude the literal interpretation of its signs, but evidence that helps us to discern their general import is available from a va riety of sources. Allusions to war and sacrifice abound in Teotihuacan arts and the extent to which the notational system is associated with such imagery is quite striking. Although there is a risk of over estimating this factor, it does appear that a more intensive ex amination of sign clusters as an expression of ideas or metaphors associated with war and sacrifice would be rewarding. Much else remains to be done within the confines of exist ing data to clarify the meaning and usage of individual signs as well as the broader issues relating to the character of the nota tional system. In addition, the potential for progress in research is enhanced by every artifact that becomes available for study and there is a reasonable expectation that, as in the recent past, new data will emerge to cast light on the many obscurities that cloud our understanding of this enigmatic society. RESUMEN Ninguna evidencia de escritura en forma de inscripciones o registros documentales han sido encontrados en Teotihuacán, aún cuando tuvo cercanos contactos por varios siglos con otras culturas mesoamericanas que habian desarrollado sistemas escritos y podría haberse esperado, por ser la sociedad más populosa, urbanizada y mercantil de su período, (cerca de 500 d.C.) por haber compartido su desarrollo. Lo que existe son signos glíficos que forman parte de la iconografía de pinturas murales y la decoración en cerámica. Análisis de más de mil de estos ar tefactos sugieren que los teotihuacanos habían desarrollado un sistema notacional inusual comprendiendo, según la cuenta actual, cerca de 130 signos. Este documento discute criterios para la identificación de los signos y los problemas incluidos en su interpretación. Mientras hay al gunos datos que sugieren su uso como nombres personales, toponímicos y títulos, la evidencia más conocida de notación en Teotihuacan está en contrada en la ampliamente difundida función de grupos de signos como indicadores, insignias y emblemas de actividad militar y liderazgo. Ellos pueden haber servido también para propósitos dedicatorios y con memorativos, pero la evidencia es menos concluyente. Es particular mente difícil en base de los datos disponibles y en vista de nuestra ignorancia de los lenguajes hablados en Teotihuacan, determinar si se cuencias de signos tales como aquellos asociados con los rollos de es critura y libaciones, codifican mensajes verbales consecutivos.
