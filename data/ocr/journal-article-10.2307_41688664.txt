<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS AXIONOETICS, (By Dr. A. G. Javadekar, M.A., Ph.D., M. S. University, Baroda, Publishers - Allied Publishers, ( 1963 ) Price-Rs. 16 ) Dr. A. G. Javadekar of the M. S. University, Baroda, has already published his doctorate thesis 'A Study of Reality' with his characteristic point of view. Now he has recently published his second work ' Axionoetics ' as a systematic treatise in Philosophy. It is with great self-confidence that the author of ' Axionoetics ' says that he has found quite a satisfactory viewpoint of the ť valuational theory of knowledge ' which enables him to arrange and systematise in the most logical manner the various viewpoints in ethics, philosophy, religion, science and art. It is the claim of this author that his axiological viewpoint is original and distinctive, and with its help he is able to organise knowledge in all its various spheres without any disharmony. The book is broadly divided into 14 chapters. The author says : ' Axionoetics is a valuational study of human experiences in general and intellectual acquisitions in particular ' ( p. 1 ). He explains the concept of value in the following manner : '•The value is not a subjective addendum to reality, nor is it an indefinable quality attached to reality, nor again is it a form of utility that satisfies practice, but value is the very condition or essence of existence and knowledge. It is an error to abstract the actual from the ideal, the reality from the worth, the being from the meaning and the fact from the value. To recognize the value that is a thing's essence is to comprehend fully the truth of it " ( p. 6 ). Axionoetics tries to evolve its own point of view of the supreme value with the aid of which it can harmonise the different social, political, moral, aesthetic and religious values in au all-comprehensive integral view, It approaches the most</page><page sequence="2">148 Annal s of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute ticklish problem of validation of knowledge through a valua- tional organisation of knowledge. The author considers the ' egocentric predicament ' in knowledge as supremely important, because ultimately all valuation is made by a knower. Only when the knower is free from all limitations and defects of subjectivity, fie can understand the reality properly as it is, because knowledge is of reality and valuation is through knowledge ; thus valué, knowledge and reality are related inextricably by a vital relationship. He stresses the need of purity and moral integrity of the knowing individual in the following manner : " In proportion as an individual rises above the limitations of his times, in proportion as he is able to regard in one moment the whole drama of existence, in propor- tion as he has a vision of the eternal values worthy to be realized, he fulfils the mission of carrying forward the message of history to the mankind " ( p. 46 ). Thus the author emphasizes again and again the need of the mental, moral and spiritual purity of the individual as knower and the width of his vision. The author examines the appropriateness of the various criteria of truth as correspondence, coherence, consistency, workability, sensuous verification, etc. and concludes that none of these criteria by itself is able to establish the truth. He has also made a critical scrutiny of the various theories of knòwledge which he calls ' epistemological pluralism ', but accuses every theory of the ' fallacy of exclusive particularity '. He also points out the limitations of the sociological view of knowledge. - All ethical thinking is fraught with valuation and the goodness or badnsss of act is dependent upon the nature of values adopted by a person. Stupidity, insanity, madness, ignorance all these properties imply at least indirectly the awareness and judgement of value. As the author says: n Harmony, balance, equilibrium characterize wisdom, sanity and goodness. Disharmony, imbalance, inequilibrium characterize folly, insanity and badness goodness is an elemental state of equilibrium " ( p. 80 ). Thus the concept of harmony is necessarily involved in all sane and healthy thinking, which is a valuatioual concept. According to Axionoetics, knowledge has</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 149 absolute priority over reality and we cannot avoid determina* tion of reality in terms of knowledge. Human knowing and valuing, though distinguishable, are inseparable in human con- sciousness. The author criticizes the ethical view of the Westerners and says that by freedom they mean self-determina- tion ; in it when they identify the selfish reason and will, they speak of the empirical self ; but according to the author morality proceeds from the empirical reason which is necessarily condi- tioned by psychological factors. Freedom really belongs to the spiritual self because the intimations of freedom come to the empirical self from the spiritual self. Man's reason is impure and so it needs purification for a sound moral life, and purifica* tion of reason consists in spiritualizing reason. According to the author, activity belongs not to practical or empirical self, but to the spiritual self. He is not one who would accept the view that knowledge is for its own sake. He says that knowledge itself is a value, and it is necessarfly related to life, it does affect life. Knowledge gains value* The statements of Dr. Javadekar sound somewhat like pragmatism, but he believes that truth cannot be indifferent and unrelated to life. The author takes a critical survey of the different method* of determining and defining truth such as rationalism, mysticism, authoritarianism, pragmatism, scepticism, relativism, subjectivism and the sociological view, and finally asserts that Axiorioetics tries to appreciate the value and significant element oť truth in each theory and tries to systematise them all and arrange them in a gradational hierarchy» He protests against the traditional descriptive epistemology and says that it is no philosophy, but is only a science. He is of the view that knowledge and error have to be understood in a concrete social situation. Knowledge and art, being primarily human affairs, cannot be abstracted from human life; and when they are thus abstracted, knowledge is neither true nor false, but ir simply meaningless. Error according to him, is at once epistemie and axiological dimunition. He further says "Truth it no*</page><page sequence="4">150 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute truth if it is not in organic relationship with good. Its desirabi- lity ( priyatva ) because of its promotion of happiness ( änanda ) makes it a worthy object of knowledge. To know that which is worth knowing is more than truth ; and a worthless knowledge is error. Knowledge that leads to peace and progress, love and understanding, is truth ; knowledge that engenders fear, war, insecurity, hatred and misunderstanding constitutes error" ( p. 112 ). Tha author tries to explain the nature of the Brahman by applying to it the eight categories and the concept of Catuskoti and analyses the ineffable nature of the Brahman. He discusses the various types of ineffabilism and says that the real cannot be ontologically indeterminate though epistemologically ineffable. The author maintains that the correlation between ontology and epistemology would be compíete if both are oriented from the infinite point of view. So far as the approach of the Linguistic ¡Philosophy is concerned, the author says that there are more realities than our language can catch adequately. To keep silent with regard to inexpressible experiences is not to deny their reality. All superb experiences are inaccessible to words. He rightly remarks that the linguistic philosophy should not end in linguistic solipsism ( p. 126 ). According to him the position of ineffabilism is neither dogmatic nor unintelligible. Very eloquently it is repeated by the author that in ineffabilistic position there is no dogmatic assertion that the ultimate Reality is of the nature of Matter, or Life, or Mind, or even Spirit. Such an assertion only reveals a prejudice for some of these categories, and therefore the truth ceases to be impartial. In such a refusal to assert definitely any anthropomorphic category originating in finite human experience lies the essence of ineffabilism ( p. 127 ). In a critical evaluation of science and its method, the author very appropriately points out that to limit all experience to the verifiable experience is to ignore the vast fields and magnitudes of. other unverifiable experiences. He sharply criticizes the illogicality involved in the method of Reductionism and refers to thje fallacy of vicarious substitution of methods. There is a</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 151 -perversion of view and abuse of reason ' in the encroachment of science over philosophy ( p. 132 ). He maintains in brief that the scientific attitude must not end in scientific dogmatism and intolerance. According to the author, the scientific attitude itself will become unscientific, if it does not recognise its limits ; it is a moral attitude since the, scientist, needs in him virtues such as sincerity, disinterestedness, love or truth, freedom from bias and partiality, etc. Science generally becomes dogmatic, while philosophy, being self-critical, remains com- prehensive, liberal and catholic in its attitude. It is for this reason that Yoga preaches the necessity of the purification of the body, mind and intellect for becoming worthy of receiving the highest experience and the vision of the ultimate Reality ( p. 141 ). The author has rightly said that the scientists are responsible for both the kinds of knowledge good and bad ; but good knowledge has got to be wedded to good will. Quoting the Socratic conception that ' virtue is knowledge ', the author rightly maintains that " Good will is blind without the right knowledge for effecting good results, and the right knowledge is lame without the strength of the good will ". A proper synthesis of the two, viz. right knowledge and good will, alone çan bring about material prosperity and spiritual richness. The author develops a comprehensive conception of Dharma as a principle of Dynamic Existence. Dharma for him means to live a creative life so as to bring forth the latent potentia- lities. There are different planes of existence and the higher includes the lower. There is a need for a harmonious co-ordina- tion and harmonisation of the biological, physical, mental, moral and spiritual planes of existence. Dharma is a compre- hensive whole which contains in it material prosperity ( pusti &gt; and spiritual beautitude (tusti); it comprehends pleasure. ( bhukti ) and spiritual good ( mukti ). Dharma is not in conflict with science. It stands for truth, unity, universality, progressiveness and a continuous approximation to moral and spiritual perfection ( pp. 153-54 ). One value. cannot be reduced to another ¿ truth cannot.be reduced to beauty and beauty to goodness j but life is complete</page><page sequence="6">152' Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institut» and whole. Therefore all values must be synthesized and harmonized into an integral whole. The internal harmony among the values is a fact and also the law at the root; there is the unity of life behind it. Harmony is a very important criterion of truth, beauty and goodness. The harmony is due to intrinsic unity and so is natural. According to Axionoetics, the essential nature of philosophy is evaluation of human knowledge in all its concrete forms. Philosophy is wisdom, and there is no wisdom without valua- tional discrimanation. Axionoetics recognises the important role of the creative activity in the ever renewing process of organisation of knowledge with changing times. There is no finality to it. The creative activity is characterised by spontaneity, freedom, openness, originality, novelty and sporti- vity. Creativity is a paradoxical concept. Creativity is a mysterious phenomenon in which the logically invariable practically manifests itself in variations, the ideally immutable actually expresses itself in mutations. It must be at once identical and different, one and many, homogeneous and heterogeneous, universal and particular, being and nothing. While expounding the valuational orientation, the author says that the understanding of Reality is to be evaluated in terms of valued personality and thus value determines validity and validity determines Beality ( p. 181 ). It is true that the meaningfulness of anything becomes obvious and understood only when its relation to an end is considered. It is certain that the end and value-context of every thing and experience alone cfrp make intelligible its nature and meaning. The all-pervading nature of value is carved and brought out very well by the author. The knowing subject, the knower's subjectivity and personality, need to be mentally and morally perfected and internally harmonised and integrated, ónce the knower's personality is internally purified, integrated, freed from the sway of passions and morally perfected, ,he¡ becomes competent for the understanding of the infinite and all- comprehensive Beaiity. Such a perfect personality can under« stand in his moments bf intuition the whole world with all its</page><page sequence="7">Review • 153 variety and multiplicity in an organised and harmonised whole at a glance ; in such a vision of the infinite, all the apparent contradictions, diversities, inconsistencies and incompatibilities cease to appear ultimately real ; they get dissolved they get thoroughly graded and reorganised harmoniously in a larger unitary whole. To such a visionary, the whole cosmos is a harmoniously integrated unitary whole ; he understands the relative position of everything in the cosmos and sees it in its proper perspective. Perhaps in such a perspective of the infinite experience, everything is adequately placed in its rightful position and all the things are mutually related in a perfect harmony. But such a view of a visionary is difficult to understand for a rational man ; for it is unverbalisable, inexpressible and so ineffable. Such a vision loses in it all the sharp distinctions of the worldly objects and phenomena, and so it dwindles into ambiguity and incomprehensibility. Moreover, because of its unverbalisable character, it becomes unverifiable and so mysterious and incomprehensible. The view of Axionoetics may be correct and theoretically sound, but it may be properly understood and appreciated only by a mystic. There is often disagreement even among the mystics about the meaning of their mystical and ineffable experiences. It is difficult to under- stand how Dr. Javadekar's visionary and intuitive viewpoint can be objectively defended and fruitfully used by rational beings for founding their social, political and artistic enterprises on. The Axionoetic view is a kind of ' transcendental subjecti- vism which, if rationally viewed, is beyond comprehension of even the best talented persons. Dr. Javadekar's axionoetics lands us into a kind of mysticism in which all the empirical distinctions get washed off and there is only a homogeneous whole of mere existence. It is the claim of the author of this work that his viewpoint is meant for the perfect organisation of the whole integrated life of the society. However, in the life of the society the distinctions and demarcations, the contrasts between good and evil, right and wrong, truth and fallacy have' to be accepted as real ; their distinctions, contrasts- and con* 20 [ Annale, B. O. R. I. ]</page><page sequence="8">154 Annals of the Bhandarjcar Oriental Research Institute tradicfcions have to be accepted as real, a tough fight has to be given by the good and the right against the evil and the wrong. But the integral and intuitive view of Dr. Javadekar will not admit these sharp distinctions; his viewpoint transcends them giving them less significance. How can Dr. Javadekar's prescription of the axionoctic view serve as a panacea to all the ills and evils of life if it does not accept the distinctions and their sharp contradictions ? Perhaps a mystic, one among scores of crores may properly understand and occupy such a point of view. An important philosophical problem arises out of this discussion. Perhaps a confusion between the transcendental and empirical planes is likely to be created by this august effort to apply the transcendental viewpoint to the empirical problems for the latter's solution. Such efforts have been and are being made very often by spiritually oriented social reformers ; but perhaps their success in this respect is , negligibly small. The main problem which awaits its solution in this context is how to bridge over the gulf between the two realities -i. e. the empirical and the transcendental realities. A serious thought needs to be given to this problem, namely, whether the empirical problems have to be dealt with and solved in empirical manner by means of laws suitable to the empirical reality, or whether the transcendental point of view and laws of the transcendental reality can be fruitfully applied to the empirical situations and problems and supply satisfactory solutions for these problems and can reform consequently the life of the society, and eíevate the society to a higher plane of life. The main problem is to decide as to whether the transcendental and the empirical realities can be reconciled and united into an integrated whole or the old dichotomy of the Empirical and Transcendental realities as propounded by jŠri Šaňkaracarya is the - eternal insoluble, irreconcilable and incompatible duality in which the transcendental cannot be attained unless and until the empirical iß given up.</page><page sequence="9">Reviews 155 Axionoetics has made a gigantic effort to understand and reconcile the various planes of reality and unite them into a harmonious whole of an integral experience. It is certainly a novel and commendable approach to the complete field of knowledge and experience ; but owing to its mystical leanings and culmina- tion into a superrational vision, it may not really help the cause and the need out of which it has taken its birth, and which it aspires to fulfil. However, the book is certainly a novel and an unusual approach deviating from the traditional ways of thinking. It carries in it a great force of persuasion ; it does have in it all the possible clarity and eloquence. The book deserves all the careful reading and understanding ; and the author deserves sincere congratulations and gratitude. G. N. Joshi</page></plain_text>
