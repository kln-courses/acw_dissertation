<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SECOND PSALM ISAIAH SONNE, Hebrew Union College As a homo novus in the field of biblical studies, I feel com -ii. pelled to make the following preliminary remarks about the method adopted in this essay. In the first place, not being thoroughly versed in the vast professional literature, I could not follow the usual scientific construction which requires, as basis for one's own theory, the passing in review of all the conjectures attempted up to date and the exposure of their shortcomings. Fortunately enough, to a certain extent, this work has recently been done in a superb manner by Dr. Morgenstern in his brilliant essay on 1.נשקו בר Our own essay in fact owes its stimulus to this work. Secondly, I am well aware of the fact that in many respects my approach is out of date, and does not keep pace with the latest fashion;2 rather it goes back to the rational-historical approach prevailing a century ago. At that time, the biblical text was considered chiefly as an old document, the genuineness and authenticity of which had to be established through a prescribed scientific procedure, in which palaeography and con text text are the basic tools aiding the reconstruction of the genuine text. The former tends to show the process of the alterations which unwittingly crept into the text; the latter explains the alterations introduced into it consciously. In a way, therefore, biblical criticism was considered a branch of historical studies, and the most conspicuous representatives came from the ranks of the new historical schools in Germany. In spite of all the 1 JQR., vol. 32 (1942), pp. 371-385. 2 One catches a glimpse of the modern trend in the following statement: "The Messianic traits in this Psalm make its interpretation simple. What king is referred to is immaterial from the present point of view." (W. O. E. Oesterley, A Fresh Approach to The Psalms, 1937, p. 187). 43</page><page sequence="2">[2] 44 ISAIAH SONNE limitations of this approach it seems to me that, under certain circumstances, especially when used with due caution, the historical method still remains the best guide for the handling of textual obscurities. One of the features of the desired procedure consists in the temporary elimination from the text of all the passages which appear questionable, either because of their formal irregularities or because of their obscurity and the inconsistency of their contents. We simply consider all these passages as lacunae, or or rather as so many X-es which have to be determined by means of the remaining unquestioned and well known parts. In other words, we proceed more algebraico and try to find the unknown elements on the basis of the known. It is now easy to see how essential it is for our purpose to establish the general character of the whole text in question before we try to fill the lacunae and to substitute our emendations for the X-es. In our specific case, therefore, the first problem we have to face is whether the scene described in the first three verses of the Psalm, namely that of a gathering of nations conspiring against their ruler, reflects a real historical event or represents rather a messianic eschatological picture. The controversy on this point can be traced back to the first century and runs through the various exegetical schools of the Middle Ages down to our time. We do not intend to consider all the arguments for the one or the other interpretation, but we think that one im portant instance has been overlooked in the discussion. As far as I could examine the matter, those among the exegetes who maintain the messianic eschatological point of view base their opinion mainly upon v. 2c על יהוה ועל משיחו "against the Lord and against His annointed," v. 7 : אספרה ...יהוה אמר אלי בני אתה אני היום ילדתיך . . . "I will tell .... The Lord said unto me: Thou art My son, This'day have I begotten Thee," and v. 12a: נשקו בר "Kiss the son." Without these passages I doubt whether so many scholars would be inclined to take'into serious consideration the eschatological explanation of the Psalm. Now even a superficial examination of our Psalm shows that none of these three passages is devoid of formal irregularities and that two of them (7, 12) offer almost insoluble difficulties</page><page sequence="3">[3] PSALM TWO 45 as to content. As matter of fact almost all the verses of our Psalm are composed of two parallel parts (a, b) with three beats to each. But the three verses in question form an excep tion and contain an additional part (c). As for w. 7 and 12, these have always been known as a crux interpretum and are still awaiting a satisfactory interpretation. According, therefore, to the procedure we propose, all three passages, being question able, have to be eliminated for the time being, so that the re construction of the whole text may be undertaken while prac tically disregarding those passages. And all the more so because our Psalm, as a whole, except for the three passages from which a messianic interpretation can be inferred, is one of the most transparent with regard both to meaning and to metrical form. Thus the fact that such clarity vanishes whenever messianic allusions appear must make us suspicious of their authenticity. Let us therefore consider the three passages as so many Y-es and try to reconstruct the text out of the remaining verses. The Psalm starts with a vivid picture of a gathering of regional vassal kings3 and princes conspiring against their sovereign ruler; they wish to cast off their bands of dependence (w. 1-3, leaving out 2c because of its formal irregularity). In a dramatic move, the psalmist transfers us from the earthly scene to the heavens, the seat of Yahweh who alone decides the fate of nations. There'Yahweh mocks at the enterprise of the נ The usual translation of מלכי ארץ "kings of the earth" has led most of the modern commentators to the conclusion that the Psalm reflects a uni versalistic perspective, characteristic of post-exilic Judaism. But there exists no reason for translating the phrase otherwise than according to its earlier meaning "kings of the land," here elliptically for "kings of the land of the Philistines," after Jer. 27.21: כל פלכי ארץ פלשתים. This verse has been over looked by Kimhi who remarks in his commentary that the Philistine rulers were never styled kings (אף על פי שלא ראינו בשום מקום שקראם אלא סרני פלשתים) As matter of fact, not only at the time of Jeremiah are they called kings but already in the famous cuneiform inscription of Sennacherib's campaign against Palestine we find: Zidqa, king of Askelon', Padi, king of Ekron; Metinti, king king of Ashdod• Zillibel, king of Gaza (cp. G. Smith, Assyrian Discoveries, 1878, p. 303 ff.). Obviously the poet, a contemporary of the events, did not feel the need to mention the name of the nations in revolt; they were well known to his listeners.</page><page sequence="4">46 ISAIAH SONNE [4] rebellious kings and tells them that He has established His king upon Zion. It is His supreme decree to which they have to bow (vv. 4-6). At this point the lucidity of the text disappears and obscurity sets in (v. 7), this being the first lacuna in our text. When the text resumes its clarity, we realize that, in the mean time, the direction of Yahweh's speech has shifted from the rebellious kings to the. king of His own choice. To him Yahweh assures the subjection of the rebellious kings and a crushing victory over them (w. 8-9). Sure of Yahweh's decision, the psalmist returns to the earthly scene where the regional rulers are still debating and advises them to "serve Yahweh with fear, and . . ." For the second time the text becomes obscure, and the second lacuna sets in (11b-12a). The clarity returns when the psalmist threatens the rebellious kings saying that unless they bow to Yahweh's will they will succumb to His wrath (v. 12b). Let us start our reconstruction with the last lacuna, and venture the solution of the extremely tortured phrase נשקו בר. We shall bear in mind that the preceding verse in its second part וגילו ברעדה is anything but regular. It consists of only two beats, contrary to the metrical form which requires three beats. Moreover, as pointed out by modern commentators, "and rejoice with trembling" hardly constitutes the required parallelism to "serve Yahweh with fear" עבדו את יהוה ביראה. We therefore include rib in the lacuna and try its reconstruction on the basis of 11 a. In looking for the most fitting parallelism to "serve Yahweh . . ." we at once realize that the most satisfactory one would be '1And'1And prostrate yourselves before Him ..." As a matter of fact the two expressions frequently occur together in the Bible. Compare for instance Ex. 23.24: לא תשתחוה לאלהיהם ולא תעבדם; Deut. 8.19: ו ע ב ד ת ם והשתחוית להם: Judg. 2.19: לעבדם ו ל ה ש ת ח ו ת להם; Jer. 13.10! and especially II Ki. 17-35: לא תיראו ... ולא תשתחוו להם ולא תעבדום' כי אם את יהוה ... אותו תיראו ולו תשתחוו. Our Hebrew text in lib would then read: ולו ברעדה תשתחוו.« 4 It is true, the classic style of syntax would require a.) ולו תשתחוו ברעדה or b.) וברעדה לו תשתחוו. Nevertheless, I do not consider this sufficient reason</page><page sequence="5">[5] PSALM TWO 47 Examining carefully the whole lacuna, composed of nb and 12a וגילו ברעדה נשקו בר, and considering it as a unit, we cannot fail to realize that it still presents striking traces of the genuine text ולו ברעדה תשתחוו. Indeed, the emendation of וגילו into ולו will hardly provoke any protest, since most of the modern exegetes had to introduce לו anyway. Not so transparent, at first glance, appears the transformation of תשתחוו into נשקו בר. Not only the misreading of certain letters has to be explained but also the transposition of the word תשתחוו from v. 11 to v. 12 as well as its division into two words. Curiously enough, by allowing for the vacant space pro duced by those changes of position, we gain a clear insight into the complicated process that transformed the lucid text into a puzzling riddle. As matter of fact, the transposition of the last word from v. lib to v. 12a clearly indicates that, in the MS, after the word ברעדה preceding תשתחוו, there was a gap larger than that dividing two words of the same verse. We are led to suppose that this space originated from the fading of the right part of the first letter ת of תשתחוו. The remaining left part, which in the old Aramaic script is almost a vertical line, is identical with the letter נ in the same alphabet. And so we get נ instead of ת to start with, followed by ש. The deformation of the first ח caused the copyist to read ק instead of the second ת following ש, since נשת did not make sense. We must bear in mind that ק and ת are very similar in the old Aramaic alphabet. Thus we gain some insight into the transformation of the first three letters תשת into נשק. More difficult to explain are the alterations to which the last three letters חוו have been subjected. But again for a further emendation of the text, because the poet might purposely have deviated from the classic pattern. As matter of fact, he seems to have ruled out a) because he wanted עבדו and השתחוו to form the beginning and the end respectively of the verse (cp. also Ps. 72.11: והשתחוו לו כל מלכים כל גויס יעבדוהו). On the other hand, b) would make the caesura of the verse equivocal; וברעדה could be connected erroneously with the first hemistich (... עבדו את ה' ביראה וברעדה // לו ת, and ביראה could easily be attached to the second hemistich ... עבדו את ה' // ביראה וברעדה לו ת). In order to prevent such disturbances of rythm during the recitation, the Psalmist might have thought it advisable to make use of poetic license and to depart from the classic form, preferring the unequivocal ולו ברעדה תשתחוו.</page><page sequence="6">48 ISAIAH SONNE [6] we are aided by allowing for the factor of space. For the division of the word into two entailed, of course, another vacancy. At that point there was a space larger than that dividing two letters belonging to the same word. As in the case of the trans position from v. 11 to v. 12, here too we must suppose that the additional space originated in the fading of a part of the letter n. This time, however, the left part of the letter vanished, so that the copyist had only the remaining right part which, in the old alphabet as well as in the new, forms a perfect ו, and he thus got his first word נשקו. That ר ,ב and ו are very similar in the old alphabet and therefore easily exchanged, is generally known and needs no special emphasis. Hence our copyist, having נשקו in his text divided from the following two וו, could not help reading them בר, the only construction which made sense.5 We shall now endeavor to find the solution of the other X, and to fill the lacuna of v. 7. Our procedure will remain the same as before with the difference, however, that in this case we are unable to make as much use of the parallelismus membrorum and will have to fix our attention more on the whole situation in order to find the missing link. The description of the situation, as we have seen above, is clear; the only cleavage in the whole picture appears in. Yahweh's speech (vv. 6-9) in which we feel the lack of transition from the rebellious kings (v. 6) to His chosen king (v. 8). This transition as well as the beginning of Yahweh's speech to His king are to be sought in our lacuna (v. 7). Now it is safe to assume that Yahweh's first words directed to His chosen king were somewhat parallel to those which He directed to the rebellious kings and that they consisted in the s It is worth while to note that Symmachos has here προσκυνήσατε — ,סגודו (Syriac) which is the usual translation of תשתחוו. Can we assume that Symmachos still had the genuine uncorrupted text השתחוו? If so, he could not, according to our conjecture, have had the word בר, and yet he renders the word בר by «at?apis — דכיאית. We may try to explain the coexistence of תשתחוו and בר the following way. Symmachos' text might have come from a copy in which the corrupted text נשקו בר had been corrected on the margin and changed into תשתחוו. A copyist who did not realize that the correction תשתחוו was meant to take the place of two words (נשקו בר) took it as substitute for נשקו alone and consequently wrote in his copy תשתחוו בר.</page><page sequence="7">[7] PSALM TWO 49 solemn announcement of the appointment of His king. In the one case the announcement aimed at deterring the rebellious kings from their futile enterprise and at producing their submission; in the other case the announcement sought to encourage His chosen king to remain firm in his sovereignty. Such parallelism is also indicated formally in the word אני which appears in v. 6 as well as in v. 7. (ואני נסכתי . . אני היום). Consequently in the same way as Yahweh announces emphatically to the rebellious kings: "Yet I have anointed my king" ... (v. 6) ואני נסכתי מלכי, we may reasonably expect Yahweh to apprise His anointed king in a similar solemn formula: "I have appointed thee king ..." The assurance of his victory over the rebellious kings as expressed in vv. 8-9 (ואתנה גוים נחלתך ... תרעם בשבט ברזל) would then follow as the logical corollary to Yahweh's announcement in v. 7. We therefore suggest the following reconstruction of this verse: // אספרה אל (...?) / אני יהוה המלכתיך ואתנה ג ו ים ... "I will tell (? = the king of My choice): I have appointed thee king," followed by v. 9: "And have given nations . . . ." At first glance our suggested text appears toto coelo different from the masoretic text, and it seems almost impossible to think that the latter could ever have originated in the former. But upon closer examination we realize that the process of transformation followed the usual pattern of text alteration known in the scientific field of documentary research. To begin with, it should not be difficult to recognize our reconstructed text אני יהוה המלכתיך in the last part of v. 7 : אני היום ילדתיך. We shall only bear in mind that the Tetragrammaton, already in ancient times, was often rendered in an abbreviated form, such as 'יה ,ה, or 'יהו, and that, in the old Aramaic alphabet, the letter ה, when the top happened to be split, could easily be misread יו. Provided the copyist believed he had . , אני היומ instead of . . . אני ה' המ he could not help reading the remaining letters כ ,ילדתיך and ד being almost identical in the old Aramaic alphabet. Now the copyist or some reader could not fail to realize that: אני היום ילדתיך "This day I have begotten thee," put in the mouth of Yahweh, was too gross an anthropomorphism to be left without</page><page sequence="8">[8] 50 ISAIAH SONNE further explanation. He therefore added, probably on the margin, the explanatory note אמר אליו בני אתה "He said unto him thou art My son." In other words: אני היום ילדתיך has to be taken fig uratively and means that Yahweh has adopted the king as son.6 There still remains to be found the equation of the last X left in our verse, namely (?אספרה אל (חק יהוה, indeed a crux interpretum.interpretum. We have seen above that on the basis of the context we have paraphrased this X and rendered the verse: "I will tell to the king of My choice: I have appointed " Now if our supposition that the Psalm reflects a real historical event is true, it would be logical to look for the name of a king who could be meant by "the king of My choice." If we apply the palaeographical tool we shall find that the best solution of our equation is the name Hezekiah חזקיהו. As matter of fact, even a superficial examination shows how easily חזקיהו can be misread חק יהוה, the more so if we bear in mind that the letter ז in the old alphabet is the smallest of the letters and that it could have been easily overlooked in a somewhat faded manuscript as that of our copyist seems to have been; and also that the Tetragram maton is often abbreviated into יהו. Moreover, if the copyist wrote at a time when the Psalms in general were already attrib 6 It may be noted that, in his own way, already Don Isaac Abravanel sensed that the phrase אמר אלי בני אתה is an explanatory one, indicating the metaphorical sense of the following ילדתיך (Cp. Yeshuot Meshilio, ed. Karlsruh, 1828, sec. Ill, chap. 3, p. 34a: והסתכל בדברי דוד כי הנה ל ה ש מ ר עצמו מתעתועי אמונת ה ע כ ו *'ם בטלת ילדתיך אסר בתוזלת הפסוק אספרה אל חק ה' אמר אלי בני אתה ... הנה באפרו אספרה אל חק הודיע לבני האדם שלא יאמר ה' אלי אני היום ילדתיך על צד הדיוק האמיתי... אבלת!1היה ספורו ודבריו אלה אל חק, ר'ל מנהג בני אדם והקם שאומרים לעבדיהם הנאמנם והנאהבים בני אתה). Among modern scholars, I find Gunkel pointing out that the phrase אסר בני אתה is a typical formula of adoption and is used here by the Psalmist in order to indicate that ילדתיך should be understood figuratively. (Cf. H. Gunkel, Ausgewaehlte Psalmen, 1911, p. 13: "Dass auch hier ein bildlicher Sinn gemeint ist, zeigt die Form des Gottespruchs: die Worte "Du bist mein Sohn" sind die Formel der Adoption." Abravanel and Gunkel, however, attributing the phrase אני היום ילדתיך as well as the explanatory אמר אלי בני אתה to the psalmist himself and not respectively to a scribal error and to a later glossator, fail to explain why the psalmist used the term ילדתיך at all, if he felt that it is not appropriate with reference to God and that it needed a comment.</page><page sequence="9">[9] PSALM TWO 51 uted to David, he could not help reading, or even correcting, חק יהוהיהוה instead of חזקיהו. The entire verse reads therefore : אספרה אל חזקיהו אני יהוה המלכתיך.' What historical event in Hezekiah's reign does our Psalm reflect? Obviously our first guess tends to connect it with the miraculous deliverance of Jerusalem from the siege of Senna cherib (701 B.C.). And, in fact, sortie of the commentators, have already referred our Psalm to Sennacherib's defeat before Jerusalem. However, upon deeper consideration of the whole picture of the Psalm, especially after our reconstruction of v. 7, such interpretation appears unsatisfactory. For one thing, the salient points in the Psalm, the two climactic verses 6-7, indicate clearly that the scene took place at the very beginning of Heze kiah's reign, yes, at his accession to the throne (720 B.C.). If so, our Psalm would indicate that after the death of Hezekiah's predecessor, King Ahaz, some of the local kings, probably petty rulers over Philistine cities subject to Judah, planned to seize the opportunity to cast off Judah's domination. Do we have any other source corroborating such an event? We have only to read the passage in Isa. 14.28-32 : בשנת מות המלך אחז היה המשא הזה. אל תשמחי פלשת כלך כי נשבר שבט מכך כי משרש נחש מ7" .יצא צפע ...ומה יענה מלאכי גוי, כי ה' יסד ציון the year that king Ahaz Ahaz died was this oracle'. Rejoice not, 0 Philistia, all of thee, because because the rod that smote thee is broken: For out of the serpent's root root shall come forth a basilisk What then shall one answer the messengers the messengers of the nation? That Yahweh hath founded Zion . . ." Who will deny the striking affinity of this oracle with the scene pictured in our Psalm? And is not the answer to be given to thé "messengers of the nation" decidedly parallel to Yahweh's words ' At first v. 7 may appear more appropriate before v. 6, in which Yahweh proclaims that He has already anointed His king. For reasons of his own, Briggs proposes the transposition of 7a before 6. But we shall bear in mind that, according to the Biblical and especially the prophetic concept, God's decision is regarded as a fait accompli. No wonder therefore that, in the mind of the psalmist, Hezekiah was practically anointed king before he was aware. Similarly Samuel announces to Saul that Yahweh has taken away the king dom from him, and "has given it to a neighbour of thine" (David) long before Samuel himself knew who was to succeed Saul (cp. I Sam. 15.28: קרע ה' את ממלכות ישראל מעליך ונתנה ?1רעך הטוב מסך).</page><page sequence="10">52 ISAIAH SONNE [10] directed unto the nations: "Yet I have anointed My king upon ZionZionZion . . .?"8Zion . . .?"8 Indeed, the famous cuneiform inscription which reports Sennacherib's campaign against Hezekiah, tells us that the towns captured in J udah were given to the Philistine kings who remained loyal to Assyria. There is every reason to assume that this was the general policy of the Assyrian conquerors and that Sennacherib's predecessors acted in the same way. Since Ahaz was always loyal to Assyria, he probably received some of the Philistine towns captured by Tiglath-Pileser. It now goes without saying that the rulers of these towns would not miss the tempting opportunity offered by Ahaz's death (especially if it coincided with the death of Tiglath-Pileser as many scholars maintain) of trying to regain their independence. The conspiracy referred to in our Psalm was therefore directed not only against Judah but also, or even chiefly, against Assyria, Judah's protector. This would explain the use of the plural in v. 3: . . . מוסרותימו עבותימו, which probably induced the copyist or some reader to add: על יהוה ועל משיחו in v. 2. Actually, however, the plural refers to Judah and Assyria. 8 True, this oracle is anything but clear, and the modern exegetes are somewhat skeptical about the authenticity of the heading: "In the year that King Ahaz died." Nevertheless, all of this does not substantially affect our suggested reconstruction of חזקיהו for ,חק יהוד. It would affect only our opinion about the date of the composition not our view of its meaning. Indeed, what ever we may think of the heading in Isa. 14.28, one thing is certain, namely, that at the time it was written, certain literary circles, endeavoring to collect old epic songs, especially those connected with the deeds of Hezekiah and Isaiah, had knowledge of a tradition (whether true or legendary is immaterial) of a Philistine rebellion against Judah during the interregnum between Ahaz and Hezekiah. Otherwise no one would have thought of tracing to the "year that king Ahaz died" the above mentioned oracle against the Philistines. Should therefore the heading in Isaiah prove to be a later addition, our Psalm would still refer to a rebellion of Philistines (if not a real, then a legendary one) at the time of Hezekiah's accession to the throne. We would only have to place its composition in a period when the tradition of that rebellion was widely current in the literary circles which added the above mentioned heading. If, however, the heading in Isa. 14.28 be authentic, which seems to us more likely, the composition of the Psalm might be placed in the very period of Hezekiah's accession to the throne and might even have originated in Isaiah's circle.</page><page sequence="11">[11] י PSALM TWO 53 In the light of this consideration, the emphasis laid upon Hezekiah's appointment by Yahweh in the central verses of our Psalm assumes new and special significance. It is generally known that, even under the reign of Ahaz, there still was an anti-Assyrian faction in Judah. Obviously the rebellious Phil istine towns tried to make common cause with that faction and pointed out that Judah, instead of remaining a vassal state and an instrument of oppression in the hand of Assyria, would do better by joining the anti-Assyrian coalition in order to regain its own independence. Our psalmist, probably belonging to Isaiah's circle opposed to any coalition, inverts the positions and the terms. Hezekiah, the king of Judah, far from being a vassal to Assyria, derives his sovereignty over Judah and the subjected kings not from Assyria but exclusively from Yahweh. Thus the emphasis: "Truly it is I that have established My king upon Zion," I Yahweh have appointed thee king" — I Yahweh and not the Assyrian ruler. Furthermore "I have given nations for thine inheritance ..." I Yahweh and not Assyria. Far from being an instrument in the hand of Assyria, it is Assyria which is My instrument, "the rod of Mine anger," in Isaiah's language, or in the Psalmist's language "the rod of iron," with which Judah shall crush the rebellious kings (תרעם בשבט ברזל). This may also shed light upon the obscure verse of Isa. 14.32 : ומה יענה מלאכי גו? כי יהוה יסד ציון. The meaning can be paraphrased as follows: How shall Hezekiah answer the kings of the Philis tines who ask Judah's renunciation of the Philistine towns which Judah received as a vassal state of Assyria? The answer is: "Yahweh has founded the kingdom of Zion." The basis of Zion's domination is not Assyria but Yahweh. Having reached this point, we venture to exceed the mere palaeographical limits and to embark on a question concerning the position of our Psalm in the Psalter. According to the gen erally accepted view, this Psalm is really the first in the entire collection, the previous one being considered an introductory Psalm added by the compiler. In view of the fact that our Psalm stands apart from the series of the so-called Davidic Psalms immediately following, modern scholars wonder what may be the circumstance to which the Psalm owes its distinguished</page><page sequence="12">54 ISAIAH SONNE [12] first place in the Book. Our suggested reconstruction enables us to advance a plausible explanation. Let us assume, with some scholars, that the Book of Psalms, in its present form, constitutes the last stage of a long process of collecting Israel's religious and national songs, the beginning of which goes back to the "Men of Hezekiah king of Judah." It certainly would not be surprising to see that a collection of religious and national songs undertaken under Hezekiah's auspices should start with a hymn celebrating this king's coronation. Now our Psalm which, according to the suggested recon struction, contains in its climactic verses (6-7) Yahweh's solemn announcement to Hezekiah: "I have appointed thee king," seems to be precisely such a coronation hymn. Little wonder therefore that the Psalm was put at the head of the first col lection of Psalms under Hezekiah and that it has maintained its prominent position in all of the later revisions. Since, in finding the key for our reconstruction, we were greatly aided by the formal aspect of the Psalm, we think it proper to conclude our reflections by putting in due relief another formal aspect of this Psalm, namely, the symmetrical arrangement of the verses. Contemplating our Psalm as a whole, I am impressed by the perfectly symmetrical form it assumes after our reconstruc tion. The first three verses correspond to the last three. Both tercets, in fact, refer to the scene at the gathering place of the rebellious kings on earth. There is however a change in the Psalmist's attitude. In the first tercet, he appears as a mere observer of the foolish enterprise of the kings, while in the last tercet, the Psalmist assumes the stature of an active prophet, admonishing the kings to give up their foolish plans in order to avoid Yahweh's wrath. This change from poet and observer to participating prophet was brought about by the psalmist's presence at the scene in heaven described in the six verses between the two tercets. Within this section, again, the central two verses (6-7) stand out in bold relief through the emphatic "Ego" with which Yahweh's solemn announcement of Hezekiah's enthronement is introduced. The central verses are so closely connected with each other that no parallelism is to be found</page><page sequence="13">[13] PSALM TWO 55 within any of them but, like two parts of one and the same verse, each verse corresponds to the other. These verses form the axis of the Psalm's symmetrical structure. תהלים ב 1 . למה רנשו נוים / ולאמים יהגו ריק:ריק: 2. י ת י ע צ ו מלכי ארץ / ורוזנים נומדו־יחד*: 3. ננתקה את מוסרותימו / ונשליכה ממנו עבתימו: יושב בשמים ישחק / אדני ( = יהוה) ילעג למו: 5• אז ידבר אלימו / באפו ובחרונו יבהלמו: 6. ואני נסכתי מלכי - על ציון הר־קדשי: 7• אספרה אל חזקיהו* -אני יהוה המלכתיך 8. * ואתנה נוים נחלתך / ואחזתך אפמי־ארץ: g. תרעם בשבט ברזל / ככלי יוצר תנפצם: 10. ועתה מלכים השכילו / הומרו שפטי ארץ:ארץ: 11. עבדו את־יהוה ביראה / ולו ברעדה תשתחוו: 12 פן יאנף ותאבדו* / כי-יבער כמעט אפו**: 2a.
