<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEIRS OF ETERNITY: AN ESSAY ON THE POETRY OF KEATS AND MANDEL'SHTAM It seems as if the honey of common summer Might be enough, as if the golden combs Were part of a sustenance itself enough, As if hell, so modified, had disappeared, As if pain, no longer satanic mimicry, Could be borne, as if we were sure to find our way. Wallace Stevens, Esthetique du Mal What the modern European poet seeks in returning to the literature of Classical times is difficult to define, but what does seem certain is that it involves a distinct awareness of return. The more the poet moves within the compass of a mytho- logical past, the more his poetry (assuming it to be vital) must negotiate the distance between it and his own age. For him, the past is felt to be at once a norm and a Geist that pervades the present. It is a norm in the sense that the present is in some way measured against the past and a Geist in so far as the culture he usurps is regarded as possessing abiding values that survive the ravishment of time. History accommodates what time destroys. My interest in this essay is to trace lines of affinity between two European poets, Keats and Mandel'shtam, in their respective appropriations of the culture of ancient Greece. It serves my purpose more, not less, that they are separated from each other by language, nationality, literary tradition, and period, for this brings more sharply into focus the single feature of their shared interest in what Keats has called 'Grecian grandeur' and Mandel'shtam 'domestic Hellenism'.1 Even so, this 'single feature' is so large that I have chosen to limit myself to a commentary that is based on the interpretation of a complex of images, common to the two poets, the centre of which is the analogy of the poet and his craft to the honey-bee and, in Mandel'shtam's phrase, its 'instinctive stereometric genius'. I propose in my analysis to move from theme to theme, utilizing the poetic material as supportive 1 There is a difference in orientation between the two poets, which I have tried to bring out by referring to Keats's 'Grecian grandeur' and Mandel'shtam's 'domestic Hellenism'. If, to take up my distinction between 'norm' and 'Geist', I would associate the term 'Classical' more with norm (in accordance, for example, with Mandel'shtam's claims in Slovo i kul'tura that 'Revolution in art inevitably tends to Classicism' and that 'Classical poetry is the poetry of revolution'), then I would regard Keats's 'Grecian' and Mandel'shtam's 'Hellenism' as indicative more of their individual receptions of the Zeitgeist of antiquity, where the distinction between the 'domestic' of Mandel'shtam and the 'grandeur' of Keats functions as an index to their respective orientations. The term 'Classical', which I have used generically, may in itself seem to beg a question, namely, the validity of such a term in reference to the work of modern writers. I have, nevertheless, adopted it for its convenience. For an evaluation of the term in respect to Keats's poetry, see H. Levin, The Broken Column, A Study in Romantic Hellenism (Cambridge, Mass., I931), and in respect to Mandel'shtam's poetry, see V. Terras, 'Classical Motives in the Poetry of Osip Mandelstam', Slavic and East European Journal, 3 (I966), 251-67, and C. Brown, Mandelstam (Cambridge, 1973), pp. 253-75. Brown offers a 'pre- liminary definition' of Mandel'shtam's Classicism as 'the amalgam of Greco-Roman loftiness and distance with the familiar homeliness of Russian circumstance' (p. 255). Mandel'shtam's debt to Vyacheslav Ivanov as a source of his Classicism is treated by K. Taranovsky, 'Pcholy i osy v poezii Mandel'shtama', To Honor Roman Jakobson; Essays on the Occasion of His Seventieth Birthday (The Hague, I967), pp. I973-95.</page><page sequence="2">LEON BURNETT 397 evidence, rather than to practise full readings of individual poems.1 In other words, I am more concerned here with poetics than poetry, with epistemology than the text. For each poet the mythological past of Greece was both distant and proximate. Two urgent concerns shine through the awkwardnesses that constitute the Preface to Endymion, Keats's one public utterance in prose on the subject of his own poetry: one is for 'the honour of English literature' in his time, the other is for the 'brightness' of 'the beautiful mythology of Greece'. Both touch him personally. Recognizing the imperfection of Endymion, Keats concludes the brief Preface with a declaration of his intent to return to the venture of composing a large poem with a broad, mythological subject: 'I wish to try once more, before I bid it farewel' (Poems, p. I 3). One feels, in reading the poetry that Keats wrote between Endymion and the two variations on the theme of Hyperion, that the poet's life was a constant living with a vision of antiquity and its gods.2 Mandel'shtam's interest in Hellenism was as intense as Keats's in 'the beautiful mythology of Greece', though of a different order. It is hinted at in his definition of Acmeism (and, by extension, his own poetry) as a 'homesickness for world culture',3 but the terms of reference ('world culture') are wide enough to embrace his attraction to the Renaissance and Gothic spirits (no strangers to Keats either) as well as the Classical. Where Mandel'shtam is specific, however, is in his insist- ence on the philological relationship of Russian literature to its Hellenic past.4 In his essay, 'O prirode slova (About the Nature of the Word)', he writes: The Russian language is a Hellenic language. Due to a whole complex of historical con- ditions, the vital forces of Hellenic culture, which had abandoned the West to Latin influences, and which found scant nourishment to prompt them to linger long in childless Byzantium, rushed to the bosom of Russian speech and communicated to it the self- confident secret of the Hellenic world view, the secret of free incarnation, and so the Russian language became indeed sounding and speaking flesh. (SE, 68/S-F, II, 245) 1 I shall be concerned principally with the poetry that Keats wrote in the 'living year', to use R. Gittings's phrase (i.e., 2I September I818-2I September I819), and the poetry that Man- del'shtam included in his second collection, Tristia (1922). The editions of their works that I have used are The Poems of John Keats, edited by Jack Stillinger (London, I978), The Letters of John Keats 1814-I821, edited by Hyder Edward Rollins, 2 vols (Cambridge, 1958), hereinafter referred to as Poems and Letters, respectively, Osip Mandel'shtam: sobraniye sochineniy v tryokh tomakh, edited by G. P. Struve and B. A. Filippov (Washington, 1967), abbreviated as S-F in all references, and, for quotations from the prose in English translation, Osip Mandelstam: Selected Essays, translated by Sidney Monas (Austin, I977), cited as SE. (Note: the essay 'Conversation about Dante' (I933-34) was translated by C. Brown and R. Hughes.) 2 This was certainly the impression made on his contemporary, John Clare, who remarked critically of Keats that 'he keeps up a constant allusion or illusion to the grecian mythology &amp; there I cannot follow' (The Prose of John Clare, edited by J. W. and Anne Tibble (London, 1951), p. 223). 3 Mandel'shtam's phrase, 'toska po mirovoy kulture', is quoted by Anna Akhmatova, Sochineniya (Washington, 1968), n, 185. 4 In this, as in so many other respects, Mandel'shtam follows Pushkin in a strongly nationalistic conception of the Russian language. Pushkin wrote that 'as a literary instrument Slavonic is un- questionably superior to all other European tongues: its fate has been exceptionally fortunate. In the eleventh century the lexicon of Classical Greek, a veritable treasure-house of harmony, was laid open to it. Greek endowed it with its carefully thought-out laws of syntax, its splendid nuances, its majestic flow of speech, in short - adopted it, freeing it in this way from time's slow, perfecting processes. Sonorous and expressive in itself, it inherited at that time flexibility and correctness. Colloquial speech had of necessity to draw apart from the language of literature; but with time they flowed together again, and that is the element that we have inherited for the expression of our thoughts' (Pushkin on Literature, selected, translated and edited by Tatiana Wolff (London, 1971), p. 122.)</page><page sequence="3">398 Keats and Mandel'shtam Mandel'shtam's 'domestic Hellenism', as the quotation should make clear, was quite a different matter from Keats's 'Grecian grandeur', yet the Zeitgeist of antiquity (understood as Hellenic by the one, Grecian by the other) re-emerges to pervade the poet's literary present. Thus, to underline the distinction, Keats begins his sonnet 'On First Looking into Chapman's Homer' with a line evocative of the grandeur of Greece, 'Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold', whereas Mandel'shtam's well-known lyric poem from Tristia starts with the resigned statement that takes for granted the poet's residence in a world ruled over by a Classical queen of the dead : B VIeTponoAe npoapaaHoM MbI yMpeM, Fre BAacTByeT HaA HaMH Ipo3epnIHHa. (S-F, no. 89, 11. I-2) But the Classical past is also a norm, and it is its normative aspect that distances it, making it an objective presence in the realm of the Imagination that both poets inhabited. They needed that objective presence. Both poets reacted strongly against a vague- ness that was a vogue in their respective lifetimes. Keats was at pains to distinguish his poetry from that of the 'Wordsworthian or egotistical sublime'. He was, if anything, a man of'genius' as opposed to a man of'power'.2 His poetry is remark- able for its concentration on the actual presence of the aesthetic object at the cost of the subjective mood or Wordsworthian recollection in tranquillity.3 Mandel'shtam, similarly, distinguishes himself from his contemporaries. He con- demns the taxidermic practices of 'professional symbolism' in Russia, where 'the figures are gutted like a stuffed owl and packed with a strange content. Instead of a symbolic forest, a taxidermist's shop' (SE, 76/S-F, In, 254), and he attacks Blok for his poetic depiction of Dante 'with his aquiline profile' which was derived from the 'voluptuous ignorance on the part of the ecstatic adepts of Dante, who did not read him'. Mandel'shtam wishes, instead, to make him into an author 'striving for clear and exact knowledge' (SE, i6/S-F, II, 378). He initiates the attempt, in a fragmented, if not entropic, world, to rebuild the shattered universe, not being content as some of his contemporaries (the European as well as the Russian poets) were, to stand back and address himself to the broken bits. For Mandel'shtam, in his essay 'Utro akmeizma (The Morning of Acmeism)', to build 'means to fight against emptiness, to hypnotize space. The fine arrow of the Gothic belltower is angry, because the whole idea of it is to stab the sky, to reproach it for being empty' (SE, I30oS-F, n1, 323). 1 Mandel'shtam calls her here by her Latin name, Proserpina, but elsewhere (in the three other poems in Tristia where she is mentioned, that is, S-F, nos. 93, I 2, and I I6) by her Greek name, Persephone. Brown (Mandelstam, p. 264) suggests that the reason 'lies partly in the Russian consonants and vowels'. I would suggest that the reason lies partly in the requirements of rhyme. The only occurrence of the name in a medial position is in no. 93, where 'Persephone' is found. On the four occasions in which she appears by name in Keats's poetry (that is in Endymion, x, 944, Lamia, i, 63, 'Ode on Melancholy' 4, and The Fall of Hyperion, I, 37) she is called 'Proserpine'. 2 Keats makes the distinction in a letter to Bailey (22 November 1817): 'Men of Genius are great as certain ethereal Chemicals operating on the Mass of neutral intellect - but they have not any individuality, any determined Character. I would call the top and head of those who have a proper self Men of Power' (Letters, I, I84). 3 Compare G. Hartman's differentiation between the poetry of the two Romantic writers in The Fate of Reading and Other Essays (Chicago, I975), pp. 144-45.</page><page sequence="4">LEON BURNETT 399 A corollary to the opposition to the prevailing literary trends was the attempt both poets made at propositions of their own to challenge the established modes of thought. This brings us to the crux of their return to Classicism. I have taken the distinctive features of Classical art to be the imposition of limit, proportion, harmony, in which aspects it is contrasted with the Judaeo-Christian that, through its excess of spirit, altered the course of European culture for good or for bad.1 Christianity does not demand structure, since ultimately all takes place on a level of existence above the corporeal. It remains true to the Jewish concept of God with 'his lack of form, his lack of habitation, his singleness' (Auerbach, p. 6). The Hellenic arts of sculpture and pottery, on the contrary, depend upon a perceptual awareness of the formal outline to maintain their sense of limit, but at the same time they possess an inner form by virtue of the pagan ideology of an indwelling deity. A vestige of pagan animism and the anthropomorphic view of the world that accompanies it remains in the humanism of Keats and Mandel'shtam, affecting their philosophy of form, if we grant what was little more than a disposition this grand title. For Keats the remnant of antiquity is immanent with history. Valued as 'historian', it becomes a 'friend to man'. Keats's feeling for the objective presence of the remnant from ancient Greek civilization assumed an almost unbearable intensity in the sonnet 'On seeing the Elgin Marbles for the first time': Such dim-conceived glories of the brain Bring round the heart an undescribable feud; So do these wonders a most dizzy pain, That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude Wasting of old Time - with a billowy main A sun, a shadow of a magnitude. (11. 9-14) The Elgin marbles would rank as one of Keats's consecrated objects.2 Stone functions as, among many other things, a symbol for the physical presence of the past for Mandel'shtam,3 but it is on a far more 'domestic' level that Hellenism exists for him: 'Hellenism is a baking dish, a pair of tongs, an earthenware jug with milk; it is domestic utensils, crockery, the body's whole ambiance; Hellenism is the warmth of the hearth felt as something sacred; it is any personal possession that joins part of the external world to a man' (SE, 75/S-F, II, 253). 1 The rise of the Hebraic influence on English literature of Keats's era is treated in M. Roston, Prophet and Poet (London, I965). 'Classical art' is a large category. It may be helpful, therefore, to refer to a single, representative source for my description of it. To that end, I would be inclined to name E. Auerbach's monumental work, Mimesis (Berne, 1946). More specifically, I would quote from his description of the Homeric text (on Odysseus's return to Penelope) in the first chapter of his book as containing in embryo the main points I make in this essay concerning Mandel'shtam's 'Classicism' (especially in my discussion of the poem on Odysseus's return). I have italicized the phrases most pertinent to Mandel'shtam's poetry. 'All this is scrupulously externalized and narrated in leisurely fashion ... the syntactical connection between part and part is perfectly clear, no contour is blurred. There is also room and time for orderly, perfectly well-articulated, uniformly illuminated descriptions of implements, ministrations, and gestures....' (E. Auerbach, Mimesis, translated by Willard Trask (Princeton, I953), p. I.) 2 See the letter to Bailey (13 March 1818): Letters, i, 243. 3 Stone contains not only the past but also the future, according to 'Razgovor o Dante': 'A stone is an impressionistic diary of weather, accumulated by millions of years of disasters (likholetiy), but it is not only the past, it is also the future: there is periodicity in it' (SE, 4I/S-F, II, 409).</page><page sequence="5">Keats and Mandel'shtam Man and the things of this world occupy the central place in the poetry of Mandel'shtam. He called his a man-centred poetics,l and we may with justice use the same description for Keats. What attracted Mandel'shtam to Hellenism as he conceived it was the same thing that figured so prominently in Keats's love of natural beauty, what the Russian poet referred to as 'the humanization of the surrounding world' (SE, 75/S-F, II, 253). For Mandel'shtam this was most fully recognized as a domestic factor; for Keats it meant, above all, the quintessence of virtue, of the noble or, in a favourite epithet of his, the fine (as when he remarks in a letter that 'Scenery is fine - but human nature is finer - The Sward is richer for the tread of a real, nervous, english foot - the eagles nest is finer for the Mountaineer has look'd into it' (Letters, I, 242)). One large consequence or, it would be more accurate to say, concomitant of the clear predilection that each poet feels for 'consecrated objects' is a strong hostility towards the temporal advancement that is perpetually proving the absolute to be, after all, relative. Keats, as long as he stayed within such protectorates of bliss as the Cave of Quietude (Endymion, IV, 512-48) appears to be, was able to draw the sting of human pain, but then he was constitutionally incapable of sustaining that serenity which freed him from the mortal world where ripeness is inevitably followed by over-ripeness and decay.2 He always returned to the 'undescribable feud' and it was this feud that gave the great odes their dynamic structure. So opposed was Mandel'shtam to the destructive aspect of time, the 'foolish infinity' (durnaya beskonechnost')3 of evolutionary progress, that erases the past or, at best, allows it a mechanical part in the meaningless chain of cause and effect, that he liberates his poetry from temporal considerations altogether. It is a startling realization that, in Tristia, there are no images of growth whatsoever. All change takes place through transformation and displacement. It is no accident that in Tristia the image of the 'black sun' is more powerful than that of the natural yellow, or golden, light of day. The black sun, with its anti-maturation function, presides over a shuttle service between the underworld of Classical mythology and the over- world of Mandel'shtam's poetry.4 There is no room for the dialectical process of Keats's 'undescribable feud', between the constant and the changing, in the sealed world of the Hellenic word. Time does, however, have a constructive aspect, which Mandel'shtam calls history. 'History' is the antithesis of'progress': 'Unity cannot be created or invented 1 Mandel'shtam writes in 'O prirode slova' that 'the ideal of complete manliness is prepared by style and by the practical demands of our time' (SE, 78-79/S-F, II, 258). Adamism (the rival to Acmeism for the official description of the new poetic movement in its early days) made essentially the same claim: see D. Mickiewicz, 'Apollo and Modernist Poetics', Russian Literature Triquarterly (hereafter RLT), I (I97I), 243. 2 Compare Hartman, The Fate of Reading and Other Essays, who says, commenting on a poem of Keats ('God of the meridian'), that it 'breaks off, like Hyperion, when "bearing" becomes "over- bearing", when maturing, instead of strengthening the prophetic or foreseeing character, leads to an overload destructive of it' (p. 326). 3 The phrase, deriving from Dostoyevsky's Zapiski iz podpolya (and translated as 'vicious circle' by R. W. Rotsel in M. Bakhtin, Problems ofDostoevskii'sPoetics (Ann Arbor, I973), p. 4I and elsewhere), appears in Mandel'shtam's essay, 'O prirode slova': 'A science built on the principle of connection rather than causality exempts us from the "foolish infinity" of evolutionary theory, not to mention its vulgar appendage, the theory of progress' (SE, 66/S-F, IT, 242). 4 The image of the black sun in Mandel'shtam's poetry has been discussed by Brown (Mandelstam, pp. 216-I8), Ivask (S-F, III, x-xii) and Taranovsky (To Honor Roman Jakobson, I977). 400</page><page sequence="6">LEON BURNETT or learned. Where there is no unity, at best there is "progress", but not history; the mechanical movement of a clockhand, but not the sacred linkage and succession of events' (SE, 102-I03/S-F, II, 286). Mandel'shtam took his metaphysical stand in this matter beside the French philosopher, Henri Bergson, whose theory of duration provided him with a model he readily accepted.' The essential argument of Bergson's theory, as it was under- stood by Mandel'shtam, is paraphrased in the Russian poet's essay 'O prirode slova': Bergson examines phenomena not through the logic of their subordination to the law of temporal sequence, but, as it were, through the logic of their distribution through space. It is exclusively the inner bond of phenomena that interests him. This bond he liberates from time and examines separately. In this way, interconnected phenomena form a kind of fan, the folds of which may develop in time, while at the same time the fan may be collapsed in a way that allows the mind to grasp it. (SE, 66/S-F, ii, 242) This position is not so far removed from one which we may adduce to be Keats's from the evidence of his letters. We find the same aversion to causality, or 'the law of temporal sequence', shown by a statement in the letter to Bailey (dated 22 November 1817), where Keats writes: 'I have never yet been able to perceive how any thing can be known for truth by consequitive reasoning' (Letters, I, 185). This attitude is reinforced by a remark in a further letter to the same correspondent (dated 13 March I818) in which he maintains that 'nothing in this world is prove- able' (Letters, I, 242), going on to say that 'evey point of thought is the centre of an intellectual world' (p. 243). The epistemological procedure that is hinted at in the second of the remarks in the later letter to Bailey is elaborated in another letter written in the same month (on 24 March I818, to James Rice): I must let you know that as there is ever the same quantity of matter constituting this habitable globe - as the ocean notwithstanding the enormous changes and revolutions taking place in some or other of its demesnes - notwithstanding Waterspouts whirlpools and mighty Rivers emptying themselves into it, it still is made [of] up of the same bulk - nor ever varies the number of its Atoms - And as a certain bulk of Water was instituted at the Creation - so very likely a certain portion of intellect was spun forth into the thin Air for the Brains of Man to prey upon it. (Letters, I, 255) What Keats is arguing here is that nothing is destroyed. There is 'constant change' (The Fall of Hyperion, I, 259) :2 an accumulation of matter or of intellect in one place at one time, in another place at another time. The 'distribution through space' of phenomena attains priority over the 'law of temporal sequence'. This philosophical stance holds major implications for Keats's poetry. It justifies him in his belief in the immortality of the Imagination, for it assures him of the possibility of seizing a 'truth' from the dim, but not extinct, recesses of the past, whether it be in the 'unheard' melody of an urn or the 'heard' voice of a nightingale that sang to emperor and clown. These are the true historians, for they are the custodians of history as 'the sacred linkage and succession of events'. The reaction against time, as presented in the previous section, explains (if explana- tion be necessary) the significance of the analogy in the writings of Keats and 1 As Brown has observed, 'the connection between Bergson and Mandelstam is a topic that would repay extensive study' (Mandelstam, p. 154). 2 Compare The Fall of Hyperion, I, 423: 'There is no death in all the universe.' Although Saturn goes on to say that 'There shall be death', it is his twilight, part of the constant change, which he forecasts. 26 401</page><page sequence="7">Keats and Mandel'shtam Mandel'shtam. The analogical becomes the alternative to the logical with its insistence upon causality. Analogy is akin to magic in that it may attract by a natural sympathy rather than conjoin by rational necessity.' Analogy (or trans- formability as Mandel'shtam calls it) is opposed to logical development.2 Mandel'shtam, in his 'Razgovor o Dante', takes us further into the structural basis of poetry than the simple analogy. He writes that 'Dante's similes are never des- criptive, that is, purely representational. They always pursue the concrete goal of giving the inner image of the structure or the force .... The force of Dante's simile, strange as it may seem, is directly proportional to our ability to get along without it. It is never dictated by some beggarly logical necessity' (SE, I5/S-F, II, 377-78). That is to say, as Keats said, that every point of thought is the centre of an in- tellectual world. The poem, morphologically speaking, is efferent, centrifugal. Analogy's kinship with magic brings us back to the original point of the Classical orientation of the two poets. For analogy bears the same relationship to magic in a Classical frame of reference as anagogy does to mystery in a biblical frame of reference. If the former is centrifugal or efferent (and one may point to the omphalic origins in Delphos), then the latter is decidedly centripetal or afferent (with an omnipresent God at once centre and circumference). The anagogical mystery, such as the inexplicable identity of Eve's birth from the rib of Adam, and the Mother Church's birth from the spilt blood of Christ's lance-penetrated flank, has a unified meaning only outside the occurrence of either event, or the words that describe them. Analogical, or sympathetic, magic depends upon a likeness that resides within the form or, with our particular interest, within the word. When Keats writes at the beginning of The Fall of Hyperion that Poesy alone can tell her dreams, With the fine spell of words alone can save Imagination from the sable charm And dumb enchantment (11. 8-II) he is both arguing for and exemplifiying the magic of language. Words are able to spell in two ways. We may call the pun the most concentrated form of linguistic analogy, possessing that characteristic of poetic material, its transformability, which we find to be equally prominent in the lability of Mandel'shtam's word-formations (where sound dictates to sense). Meaning radiates outward from the cellular centre of the word in rather the same, surprising way as the subsequent fateful 1 W. H. Evert, Aesthetic and Myth in the Poetry of Keats (Princeton, I965), pp. 6-7, referring to Keats's aversion to 'consequitive' thought, observes that his system was primarily 'rooted in analogy': 'Keats's adjective merely defines the difference between the logical and the poetic processes: in logical (i.e. "consequitive") thought, one thing leads to another; in poetic thought, one thing is perceived to be like another in its essence or its configuration or its effect on the perceiver. Keats's system was primarily rooted in analogy, and, while it pretended to a certain consecutiveness at its upper levels, its logic was built upon analogies among data not properly comparable.' 2 Mandel'shtam, 'Razgovor o Dante': 'As in all true poetry, Dante's thinking in images is accom- plished with the help of a characteristic of poetic material which I propose to call its transformability or convertibility. It is only by convention that the development of an image can be called develop- ment.' (SE, I9/S-F, n1, 382). 402</page><page sequence="8">LEON BURNETT event emerges from the terse, gnomic utterance of the Delphic Pythoness in the depths of her oracular cave.1 The transformability of poetic material is the subject of two crucial analogies in Keats's writing which reveal his profoundly spatial consciousness. They both appear in the form of insect analogies in a letter (of 19 February I818) to his close friend and fellow poet, John Hamilton Reynolds, in which Keats advises 'taking hints from every noble insect that favors us with a visit' (Letters, I, 232). The first analogy, which is a speculation on the same subject as in the letter to James Rice quoted earlier, concerns the activity of the spider: Now it appears to me that almost any Man may like the Spider spin from his own inwards his own airy Citadel - the points of leaves and twigs on which the Spider begins her work are few and she fills the Air with a beautiful circuiting: man should be content with as few points to tip with the fine Webb of his Soul and weave a tapestry empyrean - full of Symbols for his spiritual eye, of softness for his spiritual touch, of space for his wandering of distinctness for his Luxury ... (Letters, I, 231-32) This comparison is the first of two complementary analogies that deal with taking in and giving out. The emphasis here is on production in which the spider's spinning is offered as an analogy to man's creative output.2 We may notice at this point that from the dominant spinning or weaving analogy Keats introduces two de- pendent metaphors of the created work that find close parallels in Mandel'shtam: the 'airy Citadel' and the 'tapestry empyrean'. Keats's analogy, as a whole, attests to the poet's feeling for the formal economy and autonomy of the created work. The production is economical in that fJe points are required and autonomous in that the performance proceeds 'from his own inwards'. It is significant that the formal property is designated by the sequence of abstractions - symbol, space, and distinctness (in combination with Keats's particular aptitude for softness) - that disclose the affinity of thought with a dominant Classical mode. Symbol, space, and distinctness have all, in Hellenic culture, to do with an attentiveness to demarcations and their legitimate transgressions, that is to say, with form and transformation. How Keats applied the four abstract categories (symbol, softness, space, and distinctness) in a Greek setting in his own poetry may be illustrated by the descrip- tion of the Corinthian wedding-feast in the second part of Lamia: Between the tree-stems, marbled plain at first, Came jasper pannels; then, anon, there burst Forth creeping imagery of slighter trees, And with the larger wove in small intricacies 1 W. K. C. Guthrie, The Greek Philosophers from Thales to Aristotle (London, I967), relates the pervasiveness of magic in Classical times to the 'law of sympathy': 'We may remind ourselves how close were the Greeks in early times, and many of the common people throughout the classical period, to the magical stage of thought. Magic is a primitive form of applied science.... Applied science is based on laws of nature. So was magic, though its laws were such as we have ceased to believe in. Fundamental was the law of sympathy, which posited a natural connexion between certain things which to us seem to have no such connexion at all.... This sort of connexion exists between a man and his image or portrait. It exists also between the man and anything which once was part of him ... even clothes which through close contact have become charged with his personality.... Sympathy exists moreover between things or people and their names' (p. 12). 2 'D. B. Green, NQ [Notes and Queries], November II I950, pp. 499-50o , shows that this long passage on the spider and the bee is borrowed from Pliny and Swift' (Letters, I, 231, footnote). 403</page><page sequence="9">404 Keats and Mandel'shtam Before each lucid pannel fuming stood A censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood, Each by a sacred tripod held aloft, Whose slender feet wide-swerv'd upon the soft Wool-woofed carpets.. ......~.~- the gorgeous dyes, The space, the splendour of the draperies, The roof of awful richness, nectarous cheer, Beautiful slaves, and Lamia's self, appear, Now, when the wine has done its rosy deed, And every soul from human trammels freed, No more so strange; for merry wine, sweet wine, Will make Elysian shades not too fair, too divine. (Part II, 11. 138-4I, 175-79, 203-8; my italics) Lamia appears in the middle of the 'space' which she has created out of nothing. She is the predatory serpent, a kinswoman to the spider as the weaving in the palace indicates, who has entangled Lycius in her mesh. She is, moreover, a creature of wonderful metamorphoses, appearing earlier in the poem (at I, 53) as the very tapestry of a snake. She is poetry, albeit false poetry in that she has a design - in more senses than the one. The second analogy that Keats employs in the letter to Reynolds represents an expansion of the first to take into consideration the 'male' principle of time and activity (as it is embodied in the bee) in addition to the 'female' principle of space and passivity (as it is embodied in the flower) that was the focus of the spider analogy. It gives equal play to the external world (passed over lightly as 'leaves and twigs' in the first analogy) and the internal (originally the web): It has been an old Comparison for our urging on - the Bee hive - however it seems to me that we should rather be the flower than the Bee - for it is a false notion that more is gained by receiving than giving - no the receiver and the giver are equal in their benefits - The flower I doubt not receives a fair guerdon from the Bee - its leaves blush deeper in the next spring - and who shall say between Man and Woman which is the most delighted? Now it is more noble to sit like Jove that to fly like Mercury - let us not therefore go hurry- ing about and collecting honey-bee like, buzzing here and there impatiently from a knowledge of what is to be arrived at: but let us open our leaves like a flower and be passive and receptive - budding patiently under the eve of Apollo and taking hints from evey noble insect that favors us with a visit - sap will be given us for Meat and dew for drink... (Letters, I, 232) Whereas the spider analogy was directed at the self-production of the created work, this comparison concerns its inception as a fusion of fretful activity and wel- come repose; the 'buzzing impatiently' set against the 'budding patiently'. It takes into account an outside world (of flowers) from which matter must be taken in order to be transformed internally (into honey) by the operator and it expresses a preferencefor being the outside world rather than the operator. This is fully consistent with the Keatsian concept of Negative Capability, or 'annulling self', but it does involve the poet in the paradox of his own identity. This paradox Keats solves elsewhere by maintaining that he has no identity.1 1 Keats refers to 'Negative Capability' in a letter to George and Tom Keats (Letters, I, 19I-94; see p. 193, footnote 7, for a reference to critical discussion of the term). He maintains that he has no identity in a letter to Richard Woodhouse (Letters, I, 386-88): 'The Sun, the Moon, the Sea and Men and Women who are creatures of impulse are poetical and have about them an unchangeable attribute - the poet has none; no identity... .'</page><page sequence="10">LEON BURNETT Again, if we take the example of Lamia, we find the analogy implicit in the poetry. Lamia, associated at the start of the poem with Mercury, takes on the active 'male' principle, and Lycius, described as an acolyte ofJove (I, 229), becomes her passive victim. The inversion of male and female roles, taken together with the metamorphic power of Lamia, should be sufficient to alert us to the variability of personal identity in the poem. If we take this hint then we may contend that at another symbolic level Lycius is the poet. Should we identify Lycius with the poet on the ground that each prefers the receptive part,1 then we may observe that the poem ends only when the poet-figure achieves his own annulment in Lycius's death. Such an identification is supported by the recurrent tendency of Keats's poems to terminate with self-annihilation (sometimes annihilation of the poet-surrogate) or a wish expressive of it.2 The annihilation which is the fate of Lycius is also apparent in other poems of the 1820 volume (Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St Agnes, and Other Poems). It is evident in the image of a future state of suspended animation in the last line of the 'Ode on Melancholy', in the loss both of the 'faery lands forlorn' in the 'Ode to a Nightingale' and of the desolate 'little town' in the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn', and in Apollo's transformation at the truncated ending of Hyperion. Indeed, in every instance the annihilation is associated with, and augments, a transformation, whether it be from life into death (Lycius), from death into life (Apollo), from sleeping into waking, or from the visible into the invisible. One may offer the general observation that in his poetry Keats came to regard the poem as the creation of a space in which to record the poet's sense of the annihilation of space.3 Mandel'shtam employs analogies of formation and transformation that are taken from two similar sets of symbolic complexes: spinning and honey-making. In the first of these he has recourse mainly to human activity, but in the second he intro- duces the bee as a worthy comparison to the poet in the process of creation ex nihilo.4 They are complementary in Mandel'shtam in much the same way as they are in Keats. Thus we find him, as we found Keats, using the two sets of analogies 1 It might be mentioned that the pseudonym Keats chose in the popular Romantic game of the concealment of authorship was Lucy Vaughan Lloyd (for The Jealousies): see Poems, p. 678. 2 This is a recurrent motive in the sonnets of Keats. For example, 'After dark vapours have oppressed our plains' has as its final image 'a poet's death'; 'On a Leander Which Miss Reynolds, My Kind Friend, Gave Me' ends with the line: 'He's gone - up bubbles all his amorous breath'; 'Why did I laugh tonight? No voice will tell' concludes with the statement that 'death is life's high meed'; and 'Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art' finishes with its speaker's wish to 'so live ever - or else swoon to death'. This last sonnet, in particular, sets up an association between immortality and death which it is the achievement of the longer poems of the I820 volume to cele- brate. 3 I would point out, but not pursue, an affinity with the early poems of Mandel'shtam (in Kamen' (Stone), his first collection of poems), which treat the theme of silence. Brown (4Mandelstam, pp. 167, I75) writes that silence 'is the primal state, the condition preceding even creation itself.... The poems came from silence where they were perfect: such is his Platonic notion'. The kinds of trans- formation which I mention in the text (life/death, visible/invisible) are central to the poems of Mandel'shtam in Tristia and may be associated with the dominant Persephone-figure, the chthonian goddess of the dead. 4 There are references to the spider (pauk) and its web (pautina) in Mandel'shtam's poetry, but none in the pages of Tristia. Keats, it should be said, was attracted to the bee-image consistently, but had little interest in the spider as symbol, being more preoccupied with spinning or weaving in itself as an analogue for the creation of the text. 405</page><page sequence="11">406 Keats and Mandel'shtam in the same poem or prose piece.

(S-F, I, 76-77) Although either the comb or the web supplies sufficiently the comparison with poetry's transformability to warrant its usage as an analogy, neither alone is adequate to suggest the duality of poetry's sensuous-abstract nature. The bee transforms the nectar into honey in its comb and the spider spins from few points (or from out of the air) the thread that constitutes the web. The former process is slow and sensuous, the latter rapid and abstract. This combination of qualities accounts for the appeal to Mandel'shtam (and Keats) of the two analogies.1 For Mandel'shtam, and not only in this poem, 'heaviness' (tyazhest') and 'tenderness' (nezhnost') are akin. Their association as 'sisters' suggests not only their feminine, grammatical form as abstract nouns, but also the sensuous relation- ship of their analogy, which the imagery or 'signs' (primety) of the rest of the poem confirms. The apparent, semantic opposition between 'heavy' and 'tender' is overcome in the course of the poem, so that by the end the two adjectives become descriptive of the 'rose' (1. I I). The rose, their signature, establishes their analogous status. They are, as the first line has said, the same (odinakovy). 'Heavy' and 'tender' are key words in the Tristia volume. In this poem their sororal relationship is set up against the background of another favoured yoking of symbolic terms in Mandel'shtam's poetry: black and gold.2 The third line of the poem speaks of a man dying and warmed sand cooling, the fourth line presents the abstract statements of the preceding line in terms of physical images - 'yesterday's sun' (vcherashneye solntse) and a 'black litter' (chornykh nosilkakh). The relationship between the two images, reinforced by the twining device of chiasmus, is analogical, not logical: warmth passing out of the man and the sand. It may be that there is an obscure reference to the 'handful of dust' topos, where 'sand' replaces 'dust',3 but such a reference must remain obscure. 1 The dual nature of Keats's mind was such as to lead him at one time to exclaim 'O for a Life of Sensations rather than of Thoughts!' (Letters, I, 185) and at another to refer to 'those abstractions which are my only life' (Letters, I, 370). 2 D. Rayfield, in his introduction to N. Mandel'shtam, Chapter 42 (London, I973), refers to the 'Jewish colours of black and yellow' embodied in a succession of images (p. o). 3 Some support, perhaps, may be found for this in the last two lines of no. 90 in the Struve-Filipov edition: 'Primi zh ladonyami moimi j Peresypayemyy pesok.' The two poems are otherwise linked by the motive of the name that remains (no. 90, 11. 29-30; no. o08, 11. 6-7).</page><page sequence="12">LEON BURNETT 407 The two sets of twinned images (heaviness/tenderness and gold/black) are interrelated in this poem, and in Tristia as a whole. The relationship between the 'heavy combs' (tyazholyye soty) and 'gold' is self-evident.l The relationship between the 'tender nets' (nezhnyye seti) and 'black' requires some explication. This explica- tion may be supplied most directly by reference to other clear instances in Tristia, in which Mandel'shtam states the relationship quite openly.2 Thus, in the poem 'Sumerki svobody (The Twilight of Freedom)' there occur lines which deploy similar imagery to that of the fourth and fifth lines of the present poem: CKBO3b CeTH - cyMepKH rycTbe - He BHIAHO COAHIUa H 3eMA IlAbIBeT. (11. 17-18) Here the nets are related to 'thick twilight' and the disappearance of the sun. In two other poems (nos. 112 and 1 3 in S-F), we encounter the coupling 'S stigiyskoy nezhnostuyu' ('With Stigian tenderness'), where 'tenderness' is associated with the dark world of Hades. There is, finally, a linkage rooted in language that, as it were, justifies Mandel'shtam in his association of certain images, in particular, the main associa- tion of soty ('combs') and seti ('nets'). These 'semantic cycles' (semanticheskiye tsikly)3 include vremya ('time') and bremya ('burden'), a linguistic concidence that confirmed his spatial preference. The web analogy in Keats's letter broke down, as we noticed, into two sub-sets: the 'airy Citadel' and the 'tapestry empyrean'. If we turn to Mandel'shtam's prose, we shall discover examples similar to Keats's. In 'Razgovor o Dante' Mandel'shtam describes poetic speech as 'a most durable carpet, woven out of water' (SE, 4/S-F, II, 365) and, in the fourth section of his essay, gives the example of Geryon in Canto xvii of the Inferno as a Dantesque equivalent to Lamia. The brilliant colours of Geryon's skin (more brilliant than the carpets of either Turkish 1 The equivalent sense of 'heavy combs' is to be found in Keats's poetry, I would suggest, in the 'clammy cells' of'To Autumn' (1. I I). This image, at which the first stanza of the ode arrives by means of an ineluctable poetic propriety, contains two divergent associations involved in the bees' activity of building the honeycomb, which takes us to the heart of the analogy I am concerned with. The more obvious appeal, for Keats, is contained in the epithet, which points to the tactile quality of the structure, but there is also, in the substantive, an allusion to the structure itself, the comb, that occupies the last place in a series of voluminous bodies introduced by the sixth line of the ode ('And fill all fruit...'). Clamminess is something that may be known only by physical contact, a contact moreover that, like honey, insists on adhering and spreading. (C. Ricks, Keats and Embarrassment (Oxford, 1974), p. 141, quotes the most fitting commentary on the viscidity of honey.) The building of a structure implies a sense of limit, but 'clammy' hints at the violation of that limit, which is the outcome of duration, of an unanticipated, continuing process that has 'o'er-brimm'd' (the word itself has punctuation doing overtime!). Without an awareness of form and limit the growing tension of the stanza (the series of infinitive governed by the participle 'conspiring', which gradually moves to an accommodating softness with the verb 'plump') would fail to register. The image of the 'clammy cells', at a phonic level, functions as one of transformation from activity, the 'humming' of 'For summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy . .', into the liquidity of the' . . . cells'. This melodic play of m and I sounds, lengthened out in doubled consonants, recapitulates the movement of the ode's first line, from emphasis to eliquation. 2 It should be clear that in my approach to the imagery of Mandel'shtam's poetry that I do not share the anti-symbolic view of B. Bukhshtab as regards Mandel'shtam's 'poetic system'. See his comments in section 7 of his article, 'The Poetry of Mandelstam', RLT, I (1971), pp. 262-82. 3 'Razgovor o Dante' (S-F, II, 375). It is interesting to note that the first example Mandel'shtam gives from Dante could apply equally well to his own poetry (especially as the phonic co-incidence is a Russian one), namely myod (honey) to med' (bronze).</page><page sequence="13">408 Keats and Mandel'shtam or Tatar weavers) Mandel'shtam takes as a text illustrative of 'a continuous trans- formation of the substratum of poetic material, which preserves it unity and strives to penetrate into its own interior' (SE, i9/S-F, II, 382). This idea of penetration into one's own interior (reminiscent of Keats's phrase 'from his own inwards')1 is conveyed in a metaphor, appropriately Hellenic, from '0 prirode slova', in which the Russian poet contrasts the word (the 'sealed image', obraz zapechatannyy) with the outside threat of chaos: We have no Acropolis. Our culture has been wandering until now and has not found its walls. But to make up for it, every word of Dal"s dictionary is a kernel of Acropolis, a small castle, a winged fortress of nominalism, equipped with the Hellenic spirit for incessant struggle with the formless element, with the nonbeing that threatens our history on all sides. (SE, 73/S-F, 11, 251) Art is an organization that wages continual war on the inarticulate from the relative security of the 'winged fortress' or 'airy Citadel'. The threat is from without, so the armament must take place within. 'The poem is alive through an inner image, that resounding mold of form, which anticipates the written poem', wrote Mandel'shtam in Slovo i kul'tura. (SE, 52/S-F, II, 226) The spider at the heart of the web, the bee in the midst of the comb, and the word at the nub of history all assert the central and self-sufficient nature of the poet. So, indirectly, does Penelope in the fifth stanza of one of Mandel'shtam's finest poems in Tristia: 30AOTHCToro MeA4a CTPYs 153 6YTLIAK14 TexAAa TaK Trry'e H AoAro, 'ITO MOABHTh X03Rit(a ycneAa: 34ecb, B ne1naALHoH TaBpsH4e, xy,a Hac cyA4b6a 3aHecAa, MMl COBceM He cxy'aeM - H 'epe3 nrAe'o norAAeAa.

Penelope sits patiently ('and waiting endures')1 at the centre of the home for the arrival of Odysseus, as the flower does for the bee, and until his return home, in the sixth stanza, there is emptiness and the inability to speak her name.2 She embroiders the tapestry that is unwoven every night (fit emblem for the poetic process),3 unable to complete it for fear of the threat on all sides. The idle spinning- wheel is an image of the instrument, or 'utensil' (utvar'), that plays an important part in Mandel'shtam's assertion regarding the Hellenic nature of the Russian language.4 To put it in abstract terms: if logos is what man lives by, the transcendent force that generates the processes which repeated we know (if good) as pattern or (if bad) as habit, then the utensil is that which has bodily form, a copy that incor- porates the ideal image or archetype and puts it to use.5 The processes of life depend upon the polarity of the active and the receptive through the interaction of 'logos' and 'utensil'. The polarity is regulated by man, for whom time is the potential by which he puts space to use. Such abstract formulation, however, is alien to the poetic speech of Mandel'shtam, where the idea appears in the simplicity of a single image: ,JAm KCeHIHH BOCK, VTO 4Am MyVXHHHbI MeAb. (Tristia, 1. 30) The utensil, with its domestic connotations, complements man in his aspect of Homeric virtue. The poems of Tristia would seem to take as their premise the nihilistic conclusion of a lyric Mandel'shtam wrote in I9Io (and which appeared in his first volume of poetry, Kamen', in 1913): TBott MHp 6oAe3HeHHbIfi H CTpaHHbIH 5I npHHHMaoo, nyCTOTa! (S-F, no. 15, 11. I I-I2) The more ambitious, one dare hardly say optimistic, poems of Tristia move on from the acceptance of a drained world towards the attempt at a minimal retrieval of a past invested with human values, by means of a recognized returning. Mandel'shtam's quest, like that of Homer's Odysseus, is finding what is lost.6 1 From Tristia (line 3): ' . .. i dlitsya ozhidan'ye'. 2 Penelope is named, indirectly, as 'not Helen - the other' ('Ne Yelena - drugaya'), that is, as one of two 'sisters', presumably the 'tender' one at her 'net'. A possible clue as to why Penelope remains unnamed is contained in 'Razgovor o Dante', that is, that there is not always time for naming. The images are too fleeting: 'In Dante the images depart and say farewell. It is difficult to make one's way down through the breaks of his verse with its multitude of leave-takings. We have scarcely managed to free ourselves from that Tuscan peasant admiring the phosphorescent dance of the fireflies nor rid our eyes of the impressionistic dazzling from Elijah's chariot as it fades away into a little cloud, before the pyre of Eteocles has already been mentioned, Penelope named, the Trojan horse has slipped past, Demosthenes has lent Odysseus his republican eloquence, and the ship of old age is already being fitted out' (SE, 24/S-F, II, 388; my italics). The final reference is, surely, an ironic one - to Pushkin's poem 'Osen", which also has no time to include everything. 3 Compare Keats's remark: 'I feel assured I should write from the mere yearning and fondness I have for the Beautiful even if my night's labours should be burnt every morning and no eye shine upon them' (Letters, I, 388). 4 'Hellenism means consciously surrounding man with utensils [utvar'] instead of indifferent objects; the metamorphosis of these objects into the utensil, the humanization of the surrounding world; the environment heated with the most delicate teleological warmth' (SE, 75/S-F, In, 253). 5 'And yet, the sealed image, removed from use, is hostile to man...' (SE, 76/S-F, II, 254). 6 Compare M. Grant, Myths of the Greeks and Romans (New York, 1962), pp. 75-76.</page><page sequence="15">410 Keats and Mandel'shtam In the poem 'Zolotistogo myoda struya iz butylki tekla' the spider's strategem of Penelope is rewarded by Odysseus's return in the final stanza, where the tabula rasa of the embroidered tapestry is transformed into another piece of woven material, the threadbare canvas ('I pokinuv korabl', natrudivshiy v moryakh polotno'). The last word of the poem is 'full' (polnyy), an overcoming of the emptiness that Mandel'shtam had earlier accepted as his world. The poem ends with the poet, also, returning with space (the poetic text)1 and time (the past performance that is the reading or, alternatively, the creating of the text).2 Although the providence of nature that is found in Keats has been replaced by the austerity of man in Mandel'shtam's poetic world and his approach to the problems of limit commences from a more desperate vantage-point, we find him turning to the same analogy of the honey-bee in his search for a metaphor to illuminate the poetic process as autonomous and transformative. He writes of the composition of Dante's verse structure in the Divina Commedia as follows: Only with the aid of metaphor is it possible to find a concrete sign for the forming instinct with which Dante accumulated his terza rima to the point of overflowing. Thus, one has to imagine how it would be if bees had worked at the creation of this thirteen-thousand-faceted shape, bees endowed with instinctive stereometric genius, who attracted more and still more bees3 as they were needed. The work of these bees, who always keep an eye on the whole, is not equally difficult at the various stages of the process. Their cooperation broadens and becomes more complex as they proceed with the formation of the combs, by means of which space virtually arises out of itself. (SE, I4-I5/S-F, II, 377) The important expression is the last one-'by means of which space virtually arises out of itself' (posredstvom kotorogo prostranstvo kak by vykhodit iz sebya samogo). It is a metaphor that Mandel'shtam utilizes in his prose and poetry frequently. In the same essay, 'Razgovor o Dante', he describes Dante's Hell as being 'sus- pended on the iron wires of urban egotism', and continues: 'Hell contains nothing, and it has no volume, the way an epidemic, an infectious disease, or the plague has none; it is like any contagion, which spreads even though it is not spatial' (SE, 36/S-F, I, 402). Structures that are self-contained have a specific appeal for Keats and Mandel'shtam: they are time-defying. Mandel'shtam called the word a 'sealed image' and he regarded the image as an instrument of poetry by which the poet constructed his world, economically, autonomously free from space and time. He stressed the point, at the start of the essay on Dante, that 'poetry is not a part of nature, not even the best or choicest part. Still less is it a reflection of nature, which would lead to a mockery of the law of identity; but it is something that, with astonishing independence settles down in a new extraspatial field of action, not so much narrating nature as acting it out by means of its instruments, which are 1 Text, from the Latin textus, something woven. Mandel'shtam employs a somewhat different 'radical' relationship by linking 'weaving' (tkachestvo) and 'quality' (kachestvo) in a 'semantic cycle': see 'Razgovor o Dante' (SE, 40/S-F, II, 407). 2 Brown (Mandelstam) discusses 'the movement... from the imagery of liquid to that of textiles' in this poem, noting that 'in the last stanza the two are brought together: the canvas sails have been worn out in the water of the sea' (p. 266). A careful reading of this poem is made by D. M. Segal, 'Nablyudeniya nad semanticheskoy strukturoy poeticheskogo proizvedeniya', International Journal of Slavic Linguistics and Poetics, I I (968), pp. I59-71. 3 There is something of the Mandel'shtamian joy of recognition in encountering the translators' Keatsian locution for a text on bees and overflowing (compare 'To Autumn', 1. 8-9).</page><page sequence="16">LEON BURNETT commonly called images' (SE, 3/S-F, II, 363). This concept of the hermetic quality of language, sealed off from nature, has its counterpart in Keats's attraction to a certain kind of verbal formula, in defiance of logic, which is most familiar in the culminating stanza of the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn': 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty', - that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know. There is an image, which implicates the bee in its honey-making function, that occurs in the first stanza of the lyric poem by Mandel'shtam that I have quoted earlier in this section. It is an image that treats of 'slow time' and endurance, and thus, to that extent, corresponds to Keats's image of the Grecian urn: 3oAoTHCToro Meea CTpys H3 6yTbIAKH TeKA Tax Tsryqe H AoAro, ITO MOABHTL XO3fri,Ka ycneAa: 3Aecb, B neqaAbHofi TaBpHae, Ky~a Hac cy4b6a 3aHecAa, MbI COBCeM He cKyIsaeM - H iepea IIAeto norAsHeAa. (11. 1-4) Mandel'shtam uses the image of the viscidity of flowing honey as one of retardation, introducing the leitmotiv in the poem of the leisurely passage of time. It is, however, a leisure behind which one hears the impatience of Keats's buzzing bee.' We find support for the interpretation of the image of the pouring honey as one of retarda- tion in the observation (in 'Razgovor o Dante') that 'there exists no power on earth which could hasten the movement of honey flowing from a tilted glass jar' (SE, 3I/S-F, II, 397). This is a peculiarly Bergsonian perception.2 In the first stanza of the poem Mandel'shtam's allegiances to Bergson and to Hellenism (as he interpreted each of them) combine to produce an image of 'history ... spread out instantaneously in space' as duration or, in Mandel'shtam's orientation, as endurance. The poem's ambivalence is indicated by the words of the hostess. The very denial of boredom would seem to imply its existence. The contrast between the 'alleged' lack of boredom3 of the hostess and the patience of Penelope serves to show the latter to be a woman of true endurance. She is prepared to wait as long as Odysseus is away, but she hopes for an end to her waiting. It is this hope that distinguishes her from the Stoic. She looks forward to Odysseus's return, just as the hostess at the beginning of the poem 'looked over her shoulder' to the domestic past from the vantage of exile 'in sad Tavrida'. Penelope's tapestry 1 The buzzing bee not only of the letter to Reynolds ( 9 February I8 8) but also of Lamia, in, I I-I 5. 2 Mandel'shtam's observation seems to be a conscious echo of the example Bergson gives in L'evolution creatrice. The quotation is from M. 6apek, Bergson and Modern Physics (Dordrecht, 1971), p. 190: 'If I want to mix a glass of sugar and water, I must, willy-nilly, wait until the sugar melts. This little fact is big with meaning. For here the time I have to wait is not that mathematical time which would apply equally well to the entire history of the material world, even if that history were spread out instantaneously in space. It coincides with my impatience, that is to say, with a certain portion of my own duration, which I cannot protract or contract as I like. It is no longer something thought, it is something lived. It is no longer a relation, it is an absolute.' It seems safe to assume that Mandel'shtam was familiar with this passage, for the sentence that precedes it provides the example of the spatio-temporal fan that he associated with Bergson in his essay 'O prirode slova'. Bergson's sentence reads: 'Though our reasoning on isolated systems may imply that their history, past, present and future, might be instantaneously unfurled like a fan, this history, in point of fact, unfolds itself gradually, as if it occupied a duration like our own.' Compare S-F, n1, 242. 3 In section 7 of'Razgovor o Dante' (which moves through a series of conversions: honey - cello - prison - time), the example of the slow movement of flowing honey is chosen to illustrate 'a sense of expectation and of agonizing impatience' (SE, 3I/S-F, 11, 397). 4II</page><page sequence="17">412 Keats and Mandel'shtam is a perpetual retardation (Pomnish'... kak dolgo ona vyshivala?),1 a counterpart to the pouring of honey (Tak tyaguche i dolgo) to which it is related directly by the repetition of the word 'long' (dolgo). Both women in the poem have in their hands the means to slow time down, for the present. There is unease in the hostess's gesture, the involuntary look over the shoulder. It is a nervous reaction, and the sense of threat is reinforced in the lines following, which refer to a world of Bacchus, watchmen, and dogs. Alien rites and watching eyes confront the backward look. The alternatives that the poem offers as it develops are preferable: either not to look at all (as in the image of the third stanza, Kak resnitsy na oknakh opushcheny tyomnyye shtory) or to look forward as Penelope does. There are many secret (or 'sacred') linkages in the poem, which point to that characteristic of symbolic language, its potential for transformation. The 'fan'-like connexion between the two time-consuming activites of the hostess and Penelope, the flowing out of honey with which the poem starts and the return home of Odysseus from the seas with which it ends, or the 'domestic' relatedness of the honey and the fresh wine (the fare of hospitality) have the same quality of identity as, let us say, the appearance of Lamia in the colours of a serpent ('She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue', Lamia, I, 47) and her disappearance under the baneful glare of a Sophist who solved his 'knotty problem' (II, I60; my italics), because he knew how to 'unweave a rainbow' (II, 237). In operation is the 'law of identity' of which Mandel'shtam writes in Utro akmeizma.2 This is the formal economy and autonomy of classic art. Light is a structural principle for the builder, whether his medium be words, wax, or stone, for it is by light that one defines limit. Mandel'shtam refers to the 'inner illumination of Dante's space by light - light derived from nothing more than the structural elements of his work' (SE, I6/S-F, II, 378). It is light and the definition that edge gives, which were presented as the architect's tools in 'Admiralteystvo' ('The Admiralty Building'), a poem appearing in the second edition of Kamen': AaS,ba Boa3ymUHa H MaaTa-HeCoTpora, CAyxKa AHHefiKOiO npeeMHHKaM rIeTpa, OH yqIrr xKpacoTa He npnxoTb noAy6ora A xHIIgHIf rAaoMep npocToro CTroApa. (S-F, r, 29,11. 5-8) The poet's worlds of light are worlds that exist only outside of nature, 'extraspatially' in the imagination. They arise, virtually, out of themselves like the webs of spiders or the combs of bees. They represent forms that came easily for Keats and thus required a scrupulous discrimination on the poet's part to avoid the meretricious attraction of false states of consciousness (states such as those experienced by victims of Circean enchantment - Glaucus in Endymion, Lycius in Lamia, and the pale knight in La Belle Dame sans Merci), whereas they represent forms that were hard to realize for Mandel'shtam, whose cry of anguish for the 'lost word' (poteryannoye 1 The translation by J. Greene (Osip Mandelstam: Poems (London, 1977)) paraphrases the line in a way that emphasizes the temporal aspect of the act: 'It was time she embroidered.' 2 Section 5: 'A = A: what a splendid poetic theme.

It is to be remembered that the precious Penelope is unnamed in Zolotistogo myoda struya iz butylki tekla. Mandel'shtam's light is stolen out of darkness. His quest would be Promethean were it not, in the later poetry, stated so unheroically ('No ne volk ya po krovi svoyey', S-F, I, 162, he writes in a poem of 1931), were it not so deliberately domestic ('Ya vsyo otdam za zhizn' - mne tak nuzhna zabota - I I spichka sernaya menya b sogret' mogla', S-F, i, 96). Yet there is the occasional cry of Promethean agony in the later poetry: KaKaa 60Ab - ICKaTb HOTepIHHOe CAOBO, BOAbHbie BeKH nOAHHMaTb H c H3BeCTbO B KpOBM, Amh nAeMeHH qyworo HoqHble TpaBbI co6npaTb. (s ranvarya I924, 11. 21-24) Black and gold suns burn through the pages of Tristia.1 Although the black sun of night often appears as a menacing image, it is, as one poem of the collection states, less dreadful than the yellow sun of daylight.2 One reason for this is that the yellow sun shines on a natural world where all spiritual values have disappeared, whereas the black sun (a more striking image than the pale moon of Keats's Romantic world) illuminates the underworld, the shapeless, formless void out of which shape, form must emerge. The dread of the yellow sun, then, is of the same order as the fear expressed in the opening lines of another tradition-straddling poem published in the same year as Tristia, namely, Eliot's The Waste Land: the fear of natural growth in a dead world. Black, however, is the complement of yellow in Mandel'shtam's poetry (compare the colours of the bee), not its negation. The blackness of the underworld is the precondition of light in our world. Mandel'shtam struggles, like the sculptor at the uncarved block, to free his words from their home of shadows, where they pre-exist. The failure to transform the darkness into light is the paradoxical theme of one poem in Tristia.3 The Mandel'shtam poem, in its opacity (or self-referential function), supplies its own light (or meaning). The black sun, associated with Pushkin, who was buried at night,4 is the sun of poetry. According to one poem by Mandel'shtam, the first lyrists of the Muses were blind ('kak pcholy, lirniki slepyye j Nam podarili ioniyskiy myod', S-F, I, 74). So, too, was Homer. In several ways he serves as the reference-point for the Classicism of Keats and Mandel'shtam. Their poetry abounds with allusions to him or his epic works. In one reference, the sonnet 'To Homer', he supplies a rare example in Keats's poetry of the darkness motive comparable with Mandel'shtam's treatment. It is, however, Dian, the moon goddess, who performs the function equivalent to that of the image of the black sun. I quote the sestet. 1 I would add one, hitherto unnoticed, example of the 'midnight sun' motive in Classical literature to the store garnered by Mandel'shtam's commentators. It is of interest for its allusion to Proserpine's threshold status: 'I approached near unto hell, even to the gates of Proserpine, and after that I was ravished throughout all the elements, I returned to my proper place: about midnight I saw the sun brightly shine (nocte media vidi solem candido coruscantem lumine), I saw likewise the gods celestial and the gods infernal' (Apuleius, The Golden Ass, with an English translation by W. Adlington (1566), (London, I965) pp. 380-81). 2 Poem no. 91 (S-F, I, 63). 3 Poem no. 113 (S-F, I, 81-82). 4 See the prose fragment, Pushkin i Skryabin (S-F, nI, 313-19).</page><page sequence="19">Keats and Mandel'shtam Aye on the shores of darkness there is light, And precipices show untrodden green, There is a budding morrow in midnight, There is a triple sight in blindness keen; Such seeing hadst thou, as it once befel To Dian, Queen of Earth, and Heaven, and Hell. The imagery is characteristic of Keats in one important aspect, an aspect to which I have drawn attention earlier in referring to the 'humanization of the surrounding world'. This aspect belongs to a larger theme, one that we may call a theme of the 'print'. The precipices that show untrodden green are part of the 'midnight' world in as much as they have not been trodden by man, have not, in other words, been put to use. The promise is nevertheless latent, a 'morrow in midnight', where we encounter the epithet 'budding' with its positive association for Keats.1 Keats came to recognize the presence of darkness in life with an enforced imme- diacy as the light of his own existence began to gutter. We may trace the outlines of the movement toward recognition from the rhetorical question in his first public poem For what has made the sage or poet write But the fair paradise of Nature's light ? (I stood tip-toe upon a little hill, 125-26) -to the defeated utterance of his last private letter (where he refers to 'the knowledge of contrast, feeling for light and shade, all that information (primitive sense) necessary for a poem', Letters, II, 360). Too much sympathy for Saturn may have contributed to the inability to complete The Fall of Hyperion. The interest of the poem is all with Saturn and Thea 'speeding to the families of grief, I Where roof'd in by black rocks they waste in pain | And darkness for no hope' (I, 461-63). In this, the second version of Keats's myth of poetry, Apollo, so to speak, never gets off the ground. The death and darkness of The Fall of Hyperion is present also in the great odes and gives them the necessary contrast with the light. The 'embalmed' or suspended present of the fifth and sixth stanzas of the 'Ode to a Nightingale' is introduced by the exclamation, 'But here there is no light. . .'. Nor time, either, we may add. Light conspires with time, sun with season, to bring the maturation process to its climax in the first stanza of'To Autumn', and with that climax the awareness that nature, once it has 'o'erbrimm'd', must die, that autumn is (in Faulkner's phrase) 'an awakening of halfdeath'. The final comparison I wish to make involves the imagery of two poems that contain reference to Persephone/Proserpine and bees: Keats's 'Ode on Melan- choly' (1819) and Mandel'shtam's 'Voz'mi na radost' iz moikh ladoney' (I920). I shall consider the Russian poem first.

(S-F, x, 84) It was the same combination, once it had been conceptualized to the point of abstraction, that was offered by Matthew Arnold as the basis of culture. Yet it was precisely such an evasion of the concrete that Mandel'shtam reacted most strongly against in his prose and poetry, where he fought to restore the primacy of objective over conceptual reality. Thus it is that his poem proffers not 'sweetness and light' as a defence against anarchy, but a more immediate gift of 'a little sun and a little honey' (nemnogo solntsa i nemnogo myoda), a gift the more precious for its scarcity.' The ceremonial, and ceremonious, gesture implicit in the first line of the poem (which I presume to be similar to the one described at the start of 'Zolotistogo myoda struya iz butylki tekla', namely the pouring of honey from a tilted jar) is, as the third line suggests, a ritual libation. Persephone, queen of the underworld and mediatrix between darkness and light, is the ruling deity of the Tristia volume.2 Bees are associated with her (as in the fourth book of Virgil's Georgics), so is trans- parency. In each of the four poems in Tristia where her name is mentioned, there occurs an image of the transparent other-world. Every disappearance from this world betokens, alternatively, an appearance of Dis. If the imperative with which the poem commences (Voz'mi ...) introduces the motive of presentation,3 it also conveys the notion of subtraction. The reiterated infinitives of the second stanza confirm that this world, for the poet, is one of minimal positivity. The three impossibilities of the second stanza, enumerated in a parallel list read like an itemization on some cosmic account to be set on the debit side, with the 'remaining kisses' of the third stanza to stand as a balancing credit. The three impossibilities, referring to the incapacity of freeing what is already free, of hearing what is muffled, of living with the terror of congestion, all seem to con- verge on the primary image of poured honey, which once released flows freely, silently, and thickly. Mandel'shtam's world is not empty; something remains. Or, rather, since a word is not a thing, some vestige survives in the word. Poetry, naming, is magical 1 This poem is treated by Taranovsky, 'Pcholy i osy v poezii Mandel'shtama", To Honor Roman Jakobson, pp. 1987-93, and N. A. Nilsson, 'Mandel'shtam's Poem "Voz'min a radost"' ', Russian Literature, 7-8 (1974), 165-80. 2 Compare Brown, Mandelstam, pp. 255-56. 3 See Bukhshtab, 'The Poetry of Mandelstam', RLT, I (I97I), 265-68, on the non-logical function of verse formulas in Mandel'shtam.</page><page sequence="21">416 Keats and Mandel'shtam (where magic is opposed to nature),1 and what remains is prized for its representa- tion of victory over time.2 The kisses that remain supply the linkage between love and language as expressions from the mouth.3 The bees are dead, nourished by time and the odoriferous plants of antiquity medunitsa (the Greek 'melilotus') and mint.4 It is a neat touch that Mandel'shtam should offer his gift (a plain, dry Acmeist poem) as a 'necklace of dead bees' (ozherel'ye I Iz myortvykh pchol), for he thereby once more links the honey-motive with the threading-motive to produce the text of the poem. The distinctness of the poem from the natural world, moreover, is underlined by the fact that the natural process is reversed in the last line, the honey having been transformed into the sunlight. In terms of the imagery and themes discussed in this essay, Keats's 'Ode on Melancholy', where Proserpine and the bee are associated by a shared toxicity, is a comparable achievement. No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine; Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine; Make not your rosary of yew-berries, Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl A partner in your sorrow's mysteries; For shade to shade will come too drowsily, And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul. 2 But when the melancholy fit shall fall Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud, That fosters the droop-headed flowers all, And hides the green hill in an April shroud; Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose, Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave, Or on the wealth of globed peonies; Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows, Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave, And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes. 1 There are numerous assertions in Mandel'shtam's poetry of the 'magical' significance of names and naming. The final stanza of no. go is closest to the present poem. It ends: 'Nam ostayotsya tol'ko imya- I Chudesnyy zvuk, na dolgiy srok. I Primi zh ladonyami moimi I Peresypaemyy pesok'. 2The same motive may be found in Keats's Ode on a Grecian Urn: 'Cold Pastoral! I When old age shall this generation waste, I Thou shalt remain. . . ' (11. 45-47, my italics). 3 A variant of the poem I quoted earlier ('Syostry - tyazhest' i nezhnost' - odinakovy vashi primety'), given in S-F, I, 447, would suggest that the unspoken 'name', the 'golden care' of the second stanza, is 'love' (lyubit'). The variant of line 6 reads: 'Legche kamen' podnyat', chem vymolvit' slovo - lyubit". Compare, particularly in relation to the ode by Keats discussed in this section, 'Razgovor o Dante': 'A new link is revealed here: between feeding and speaking' (SE, 35/S-F, n, 401). 4 Minthe was the nymph who was metamorphosed by Persephone as Hades appeared with his golden chariot and four black horses, intent on seducing her.</page><page sequence="22">LEON BURNETT 417 3 She dwells with Beauty - Beauty that must die; And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh, Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips: Ay, in the very temple of Delight Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine, Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine; His soul shall taste the sadness of her might, And be among her cloudy trophies hung. The large design of the ode resembles that of Mandel'shtam's poem with the background presence of the Classical Persephone-Proserpine figure and the ambi- ence of death, with the association of the honey-bee as a transforming agent in an image that is essentially oral, and with the transfer from the firm reiteration of negative statements to a triumphant assertion in gift or trophy. Similarly, the slighter details correspond to a remarkable degree: the kissing, the shadows, the death-image of necklace or rosary, the texture of bees (mokhnatyye) and owl, the hands, the mood of joy tempered by some darker emotion (fear, sorrow). These facets alone would do much to establish an affinity of mood between the English Romantic poet and the Russian Acmeist poet, but we may also point to the import- ance in other poems by Mandel'shtam of the main theme of the third stanza of Keats's ode: the theme of farewell.' Keats, as ever, is seeking entry in this ode into the charmed world of imaginative stasis. The shrine of veiled Melancholy is a variation of the Cave of Quietude in Endymion, and the only keys that unlock these doors are intensity and patience. The recognition of limits may equally well be the knowledge of one's own exclusion as of one's own inclusion. The anaphoric 'nor' must precede the syndetic 'or'. Thus, it is necessary, in the first stanza, to dismiss all the wrong approaches that are aimed at a wilful surrender of the soul, before it is possible, in the second stanza, to arrive at all the right actions that are directed to a proper observance with the eyes. The third stanza represents a consolidation rather than an advance in the argument. It stands in relation of a synthesis to the thesis and antithesis of the first two stanzas and incorporates the vocabulary of both. Although a unit (for each stanza is a single sentence), the final stanza may be divided into two parts dependent upon the common oral metaphor of tasting. The crucial image of the first part of this stanza is the 'bee-mouth'. The inevitability of temporal process in nature is symbolized in the frail moment 'while the bee-mouth sips'. This image, coming as it does after the sequence of present participles ('bidding', 'aching', 'turning'), bespeaks duration. By presenting the consequence of an action in the description of the action itself, the device of anticipation becomes the conceptual inverse of the 'print' theme mentioned earlier, with which it shares the common feature of identifying transformation as a telescoping of time (like Mandel'shtam's 'fan'). In the poem Tristia Mandel'shtam describes parting as a 'science' ('Ya izuchil nauku rasstavan'ya | V prostovolosykh zhalobakh nochnykh', 11. I-2). As Brown notes, the Ovid whose presence is felt behind so much of the Tristia collection is the poet of exile (Mandelstam, p. 255). Compare, also, Brown, p. 274. 27</page><page sequence="23">Keats and Mandel'shtam The most important aspect of the synthesis, however, is reserved until the end. What concerns Keats ultimately in the ode is the relationship between 'soul' (the last word of the first stanza) and 'eyes' (the last word of the second), that is to say, between the abstract and the sensuous, between, in another context, Truth and Beauty. The ode's conclusion affirms the Keatsian credo that eyes which see provide the passport to the soul's delight. A triple set of images combines, synaes- thetically, to chart the threshold passage of the melancholic man: the tongue bursts through the grape's skin, allowing the eyes to penetrate the shrine's veil, and the soul to pass beyond the boundary of the visible to the sacrificial space of the 'cloudy trophies'. 'Cloudy', with its suggestion of the indistinctness by which the reader is cut off from a clear view of the metamorphosed soul, is descriptive of both insubstantiality and elevation. Furthermore, it reverberates with the cloud/ shroud rhyme of the second stanza to imply a transfiguration through death. In this final respect the ponderous vowels of the terminal image (of 'her cloudy trophies hung') have an effect comparable with Lamia's closing cadence of 'the heavy body wound': the words are a dead weight after the soul has flown. It is worth noting that even in this final stanza, when it might seem that Keats is far from his ideal of'Grecian grandeur', he remains within a Classical frame of reference. The 'Romantic' conjunction of pleasure and pain, the combination of the themes of death and the immortality of the soul with the motive of the drinking of poisonous wine, are all to be found in Plato's account of Socrates's suicide in the Phaedo, where the master is given to observe 'how singular is the thing called pleasure, and how curiously related to pain, which might be thought to be the opposite of it; for a man never feels both at the same instant, and yet he who pursues either is generally compelled to take the other; their bodies are two, but they are joined by a single head'.1 To transmit is to transmute. Imagination, with its capital 'I' for Wordsworth, was for Keats part and parcel of Negative Capability with its small, but discriminating, eye for the life of the object apprehended. 'I live in the eye', wrote Keats in a letter describing his first sight of a waterfall (Letters, I, 30 1). The 'truth' of a thing is seized by an intense act of imaginative speculation, when 'not myself goes home to myself' (Letters, I, 387). Emerson, with his great gift for synthesizing diverse strands of English Romantic thought in the name of Transcendentalism, described Imagination as 'a very high sort of seeing, which does not come by study, but by the intellect being where and what it sees, by sharing the path or circuit of things through forms, and so making them translucid to others'.2 This characteristic of Imagination is echoed by Bergson's words, in his Introduction to Metaphysics, where he defines intuition as 'the kind of intellectual sympathy by which one places oneself within an object in order to coincide with what is unique in it'.3 The capacity for 'intellectual sympathy', a 'magical' power which Keats possessed in abundant measure,4 finds its place in Mandel'shtam's repeated emphasis on the 1 Plato, The Four Socratic Dialogues, translated by B. Jowett (Oxford, 1903), p. I76. 2 R. W. Emerson, Complete Works (Boston, I903), III, 20. 3 H. Bergson, An Introduction to Metaphysics, translated by T. E. Hulme (London, 1913), p. 6. 4 According to the testimony of the letters, Keats was able to grasp from within the 'life' of such diverse objects as a sparrow pecking at the gravel, a rotted grain of wheat, and a billiard ball (see Letters, I, I86, 273, and 389). 4I8</page><page sequence="24">LEON BURNETT presentation of the inner image or quality of a thing. The essay on Dante provides the most concentrated evidence of this insistence. In it, Mandel'shtam maintains that Dante's similes 'always pursue the concrete goal of giving the inner image of the structure or the force' (SE, I5/S-F, I, 377), that it is the 'inner illumination of Dante's space by light- light derived from nothing more than the structural elements of the work' (SE, I6/S-F, nI, 378) which informs his work, that it is Hell which 'contains nothing' (SE, 36S-F, II, 402). Form is that which is within.' Mandel'shtam cites Dante as his authority on this: He himself says: 'Io prernerei di mio concetto il suco' (Inferno, xxxII, 4), 'I would squeeze the juice out of my idea, out of my conception.' That is, form is conceived of by him as something wrung out, not as something that envelops. Thus, strange as it may be, form is pressed out of the content - the conception - which, as it were, envelops the form. Such is Dante's clear thought. (SE, I3/S-F, nI, 375) 1MIandel'shtam called for the recognition of the uniqueness of the thing through an unmediated perception. This demand conformed, on the one side, to the insistence of French Symbolism for a 'dereglement de tous les sens' (Rimbaud) and, on the other, to the insistence of Russian Formalism for a 'making strange' (Shklovsky). In retrospect, it seems but a short step from Rimbaud's 'Je est un autre' to the introduction of Shklovsky's now familiar device of ostraneniye into the literary lexicon. It is not difficult to see how the new awareness of the need for seeing things afresh was nurtured by Romanticism, just as the modern, psycho- analytical interest in role-playing or transformations of the self was the outcome of a Romantic concern with the problem of 'identity'. Habitual vision was a Romantic aversion, a 'universe of death' as Wordsworth called it (Prelude, XIII, I4I; I805 edition), a 'film of familiarity' that blinds, deafens, and desensitizes in Coleridge's view.2 Different though they were, the fundamental drives within to the sanctity of structure have a common denominator for Keats and Mandel'shtam in the recourse to the inviolability of Greek mythology, which outlasts the 'sad wasting of old time'. One unifying factor was the desire each poet had to construct a self- enclosed world, the perfect analogy of the physical one, but 'Shut from the busy world of more incredulous' (Lamia, I, 397). Mandel'shtam felt, and feared, the loss of sound and vision, the props of percepti- bility. When the poet no longer possesses the power to renew language, his per- ception has failed him. The field of vision becomes repetitive, or transparent, or empty, that is to say, in each case, imperceptible. To build means to fight against emptiness, to hypnotize space. Both poets, each in his own way, sought the fulfil- ment of form. For Keats it came with painful rapidity; for Mandel'shtam with agonizing slowness. L LEON BURNETT UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX 1 The most extreme case of Mandel'shtam's insistence on the innerness of form, the metaphor of the candle burning inside a paper lantern (SE, 77/S-F, II, 256), removes the distinction between form and content, and places them both within ('the very same candle in the same lantern'). Compare the relationship between 'word' and 'thing' in 'Slovo i kul'tura' (SE, 52/S-F, nI, 226). 2 S. T.
