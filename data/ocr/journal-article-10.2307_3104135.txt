<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BACK-TO-NATURE MOVEMENT, MODERN TECHNOLOGY, AND THE INVERSION OF DR. DE GREGORI To the Editor: In his communication, Thomas De Gregori expresses the opinion that even though modern science and technology have provided a better life for almost everyone with access to them, there is nonethe- less an enclave of atavistic thinkers who either irrationally or unin- formedly regard the products of science and technology as "death- dealing systems." Because of my defense of the policy of employing less advanced technology on the basis of its greater "redundancy" (i.e., its greater ability to survive disrupting external events), De Gregori has declared me guilty of "topsy-turvy thinking." In response, the first thing to note is that to defend is not to advo- cate, and in particular to note that my observation concerning the relatively greater safety and stability of alternate and intermediate technology was not necessarily an invitation to throw more advanced forms to the wind. In point of fact, however, although I appreciate many things about modern technology besides its dangers, De Gre- gori is correct in surmising that I do not hold the same purblind enthusiasm for modern developments as he does. Indeed, it is clear that he is nothing less than a True Believer in one of mankind's strongest and most widespread present-day religions, the Faith in Technology; whereas I consider myself something of a Skeptic and a Dissenter-though certainly not a Luddite, as De Gregori apparently thinks I am. The substantive issue, then, between De Gregori and myself is the degree of vulnerability to breakdown of our increasingly technological society. Personally, I regard De Gregori's confidence in technology as naive, but since one's attitude on a question of this sort is evidently a matter of judgment and not of Truth-and since our respective judgments are based on a lifetime of widely differing experiences-it is useless to condemn one another except as a mere prolegomenon to recounting a few of our more convincing experiences, in hopes that interested but unprejudiced parties might be made to feel more sym- pathetic to our respective points of view. (There is, of course, no expectation that we will persuade one another.) Accordingly, in the paragraphs below I shall set forth some of the more salient reasons why I believe that De Gregori's faith has been misplaced. 218</page><page sequence="2">The Back-to-Nature Movement The first general area in which technology has had a death-dealing effect is in the environment. To begin with nuclear technology, we should certainly mention the near-catastrophe at Three Mile Island; but we should also mention the fact that there have been numerous other accidents at other nuclear plants-2,300 in 1979 alone. Cer- tainly, in speaking of nuclear technology, we should not pass over the threat of nuclear war, which has been with us for some time; nor should we pass over the threat of nuclear terrorism, which has only quite recently become a problem. Perhaps the most death-dealing element of nuclear technology, however, is its waste products, which not only seem impossible to dispose of safely but which continue to drip, leak, wash, seep, creep, flow, and blow their way mysteriously into the environment from storage sites too numerous to mention, and of course from many of the conveyances that transport them directly past our doors. The nuclear specter is only a small part of the technological threat to the environment. My own environmental consciousness was first raised when my parents took me to visit Ducktown, Tennessee, which at the time had been devastated by industrial fumes. Not a single piece of vegetation was to be seen anywhere, the eroded land itself having taken on a bizarre purple-cum-yellow hue. Since my contact with Ducktown occurred considerably before the term "environment" had been discovered by the media, I long supposed that Ducktown was merely an isolated incident. Now, however, most of us are faWniliar with such technological nightmares as acid rain, strip mining, par- ticulates, exhaust emissions, oil spills, asbestos, DDT, the erosion of the ozone layer by fluorocarbons, the greenhouse effect, and kepone, PCBs, and other toxic industrial wastes which are not only being dumped by the tankerful along our highways courtesy of the Mob, but are also turning up in our backyards in the form of un- documented and long-forgotten waste-disposal sites. Someday, perhaps, we will be forced to acknowledge the truth of the observa- tion that every Hooker has a Love Canal. The death dealing of modern technology goes far beyond mere environmental problems, however, one example being the sup- posedly life-supporting field of medical science. Perhaps it would be in bad taste to mention the well-meaning efforts of the technology which gave us heroin as a cure for morphine addiction, or recom- mended the phocino-teratogenic thalidomide as a cure for pregnant women's morning sickness, or brought Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever to the East Coast in an innocent attempt to study it. But it is more difficult to pass over the myriad of technological wonders such 219</page><page sequence="3">220 John Bryant as valium, librium, methedrine, dexedrine, methaqualone, and phenobarbital, to which so many of our solid and semi-solid citizens are quietly and shamelessly enslaved. Another threat from medical science is that the drugs used to combat harmful microorganisms eventually lead (via natural selection) to the development of drug- resistant strains which are then more lethal than the original strain because of the tendency of the human population to lose its natural immunity while under the protection of the drug. (This particular problem has already shown up noticeably in the case of both polio and gonorrhea, and is exacerbated by the tendency of medicos to use antibiotics against viral infections even though such drugs are com- pletely ineffective against viruses.) A related scandal is that hospitals themselves are sources of supergerms which breed in the near-antiseptic environment of the Semmelweissian irony, and which strike down with lethal force the very people who come expecting to regain their health. Another death threat from medical technology is gene splicing, which may very well succeed in manufacturing custom-designed islets of Langerhans for ailing diabetics, but may just as well devastate the world by the inadvertent release of an Andromeda Strain. And again, medical technology threatens to pollute our gene pool by keeping alive all the anthropomorphic travesties who would otherwise merci- fully pass on before they could reproduce. Furthermore, in combina- tion with the technology of agriculture, medical science has managed to create a population explosion which promises to deal death not only to the world's overstrained and ecologically fragile environ- ments, but also-as nations battle over increasingly scarce resources-to mankind itself. And finally, in a crowning irony, medi- cal technology deals death to life by threatening us with the possibility of being sustained beyond our years or our consent, with only the rhythm of a respirator or the drip of a catheter to keep us company. Another area in which the death-dealing threat of technology is significant is agriculture. For example, the fact that grand-scale ag- ribusiness has numbered the days of the independent farmer means that a practical knowledge of farming-an operation which is crucial to our survival-is becoming rapidly extinguished. A second technological threat concerns the double bind of food processing which first removes natural elements and then adds synthetic ones as replacements, thereby possibly starving us of unknown but essential micronutrients while poisoning us with overdoses of known ones. Then there is widespread plant hybridization, a threat since entire crops or species could be wiped out as a result of a hybrid's lack of immunity to pests or disease that natural selection would have con-</page><page sequence="4">The Back-to-Nature Movement ferred upon a hardier, though perhaps less prolific, natural strain. Yet another threat is in the technology of animal husbandry, where, for example, turkeys have been bred with such large breasts they can no longer copulate, and are dependent for their continued reproduc- tion on the loving hand of a turkey milker with a test tube. So far I have spoken of death dealing by technology only as it relates to physical well-being, but no less important is technology's thanatophoric effect on human culture. Certainly there is no need to detail the Orwellian nightmare of 1984 nor the not-much-more- palatable Brave New World. But whatever we may opine about the future, the present certainly offers sufficient cause to fill a lacrima- tory. For one thing, the technology of industrialization has drawn people away from small communities and left them rootless and adrift. For another, children no longer bother to learn the multiplica- tion table (or its Trachtenbergian analogue) as a result of the ubiquity of the electronic pocket calculator. Or, again, within the space of a single generation the omnipresence of television has caused the printed word-and literacy itself-to become endangered. Even more threatening than this, however, is television's rapid amalgamation of our culture into a sort of parody of democracy and the melting pot, for in our faithful attendance at the feet of this cretinogenic electronic guru we are becoming sponges for its predigested presentations, superficial analyses, and lowest-common-denominator thinking, to say nothing of its salvation-through-purchase commercialism, all of which we regurgitate upon our neighbors in our dutiful imitation of its New York-cum-Hollywood patois. Technology, I think, is a sort of Newtonion mechanics writ large- its successes are so obvious that its failures, however crucial, go un- noticed. But in spite of all that we have said so far, it is not so much any particular failures or dangers of technology that makes me leery of it; it is rather that even the Best and the Brightest can be-and usually are- enormously stupid at times; and it is just such beings whose fingers will be on the buttons. It is understandable, of course, why Dr. De Gregori (or is it Dr. Pangloss?) is so enthusiastic about technology-he has grown up with it and knows through certain pain- ful experiences that he would be very much at a loss without it. A larger perspective, however, should make it clear that the marvels of technology have been in existence hardly longer than a nanosecond in the brief hour of human history, so that any attempt, such as De Gregori's, to extrapolate from such limited experience and arrive at some ataractic conclusion about future technological safety can be seen to be risible in the extreme. In this respect, then, technology is not only dangerous from the 221</page><page sequence="5">222 John Bryant standpoint of the destruction it can create, but also from the stand- point of the illusions it can foster. For my own part, I would like to see technology make progress, but I also believe that the danger that exists in separating man from his Mother Earth increases exponen- tially with the distance, and that this factor must be interpolated into the field equations that are used for navigation by the scientists and philosophers who are leaning so heavily on the technological throttle.
