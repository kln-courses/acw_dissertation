METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS CONCERNING 'THE PARTICU- LAR' AND 'THE GENERAL' IN NEAR EASTERN RELIGION IN THE HELLENISTIC AND ROMAN PERIODS' Introduction Any student of the religious life of a particular city or region in the Hellenistic and Roman Near East is faced by a dilemma: how can one account for the application of comparative material from elsewhere to one's own study of a local religion without embracing the hotly debated concept of 'Oriental cults'? Modem research on so-called eastern religious practices in the period from Alexander to Constantine often starts from arguing that the category of 'Oriental cults' conflates matters which ought to be kept separate, and that, although there were a great number of similarities between the cultures and religions of the several different towns and local areas in the Near East, above all the various places were very different from each other.2 Naturally, by combining different local perspectives, and by taking into account both how far they correspond and how far they are divergent, it should also be possible to make careful observations about religious life in the Near East in a wider context. But by focussing on the evidence from one city it proves only too easy to lose sight of the necessity for justification for bringing in visual and textual sources from other local or regional cultural spheres of influence in order to illustrate one's argument or to help filling in This paper follows up a challenge which I owe in the first place to Martin Goodman and Stephen Mitchell, the examiners of my D.Phil. thesis on Palmyrene religion, who pointed out to me that the assumption "that religious life in the Near East in the Roman period was above all local" ought to be supported by more methodological exploration. An earlier version was presented in London in January 2001 as a public lecture at the annual joint meeting of the Palestine Exploration Fund, the Societyfor Arabian Studies and the Councilfor British Research in the Levant. I am very grateful to Michael Macdonald for the invitation which sparked off my attempts to write this paper, and to Olivier Hekster for serving as a sounding board for my ideas. Subsequent revised versions have benefitted from the generous comments of Nicole Belayche, Corinne Bonnet, Jag Elsner, Jane Lightfoot and Fergus Millar. Finally, I owe thanks to the British Academy for support through the award of a Postdoctoral Fellowship. 2 For some comparative studies of localities and regions in the Near East, see H.J.W.

Broad patterns of continuous similarity, such as the system of name-giving and the application of particular cult titles to deities, certain features of religious practice, and the background of a world in which Semitic (and other non-Classical) languages played a role, easily seduce the observer into explaining elements known only from specific local contexts as automatically belonging to a wider 'Oriental' whole. This paper aims to bring together a number of methodological issues with regard to this juxtaposition of 'the particular' and 'the general' within the study of religious life in the Classical Levant. But rather than studying the assorted aspects of worship in the Near East in the Hellenistic and Roman periods which can be framed under the headings of 'localisation' and 'universalisation' in opposition to each other, this paper will argue that they ought to be viewed as being integrated. In the process, a variety of ways will be explored of how to conceptualise the interaction of local cultures and wider interpretative frameworks without having to resort to constructs which are as little justifiable as the notion of 'Oriental cults' itself. The present treatment of the problems involved may be cursory, but it deals with matters which have not always received the attention they deserve. 'Oriental cults' Any search for 'Oriental cults' necessarily starts with the sobering observation that this very notion implies a non-oriental point of departure. In the early second century AD the satirist Juvenal made his famous statement that "the Syrian Orontes river has long been discharging into the Tiber."3 Ancient authors referred to the foreign nature of many individual cults which were on offer in the Roman world and, even if the modem terrn does not correspond to any formal differentiation consistently applied in Antiquity itself, it was especially in the scope of religious matters that the eastern parts of the Empire were dealt with in differentiated modes.4 In the modern world the Belgian scholar Franz Cumont became the "high priest of 'oriental' cults".5 His Les religions orientales dans le 3 Sat. 3,62. It ought to be remarked, however, that the poet's voice is directed at mainland Greece (Amydon in Macedonia and Sicyon on the Peloponnesus), the Aegean islands (Andros and Samos) and Asia Minor (Tralles in Lydia and Alabanda in Caria) rather than at the inhabitants of the Near East.

A supporter of the historical-critical method, Cumont sought to explain both Christianity and paganism in their common origin. In his evolu- tionary view of the cults from the East he interpreted these religious movements as being similar mystery religions whose main attraction was the promise of after-life, and which accordingly paved the way for a triumphant Christendom.6 Once coined by Cumont, the designation 'Oriental cults' was definitively preserved as a major research tool by Maarten Vermaseren as editor of the series Etudes preliminaires sur les religions orien- tales dans 1'empire romain.7 Since then, it has been remarked numerous times that the term implies a non-existing unity, and does not do justice to the diversity of the forms under which religious experiences could be expressed in various places.8 In any case, 'Oriental cults' has come to be used in the first place to denote the veneration of those gods who spread beyond the Fertile Crescent and other homelands, such as Asia Minor, Persia and Egypt, and who attracted worshippers throughout the whole Roman Empire. It needs therefore to be emphasised that this paper is not concerned with Cumont's broad range of entirely disparate forms of worship, but with the question of to what degree there exists an integral unity of cults whose local origins lay within the eventual boundaries of those areas which, at some point in their history, would constitute the Near Eastern provinces of the Roman empire. In Maurice Sartre's words, it is about 'the indigenous gods at home'.9 Scholars have for a long time been looking for common characteristics of religious practice among the inhabitants of the Near East who spoke one of the Semitic languages.

Turcan admitted that, in approach and structure, his work paid tribute to Cumont, but it may be considered significant that the English version of his book, a translation of Les cultes orientaux dans le monde romain (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1989), missed an important word in the title. Compare the comments on the similarities between Turcan and Cumont as made by Belayche, 'L'Oronte et le Tibre' (n.3), p. 5 n.36: "Le plan des deux ouvrages est sensiblement identique et on ne peut expliquer autrement que par une inspiration le fait de rejeter dans un dernier chapitre Dionysos et Sabazios."

Ideally, an examination of shared cult-related vocabulary (e.g. concerning cult titles, but also linguistic formation in general) could produce new insights into the problem of whether deities who were specifically linked to certain localities or regions tended to express their local or regional character in similar ways. For our purpose at present, however, it is sufficient to note that any interpretation of a local religion will have to take into account certain parallels to its religious phraseology in other languages. And this raises indeed further questions as to which degree a local religious system is dependent on its language, and whether cults underwent some sort of transformation when they were expressed in a language which was not their 'original' one. Different words in different languages can transmit different values, and it is impossible to measure exactly the impact which the inherent meaning of sacred terminology originating elsewhere could have on a local religious system in which it was introduced in a later phase.'3 Problems arise especially when scholars intend to analyse religious features in terms of a convergence of indigenous oriental layers on the one hand and of structures which were introduced from the Greek, or rather the Graeco-Roman, world on the other. There is still a tendency to argue that the so-called 'true nature' of indigenous gods, and of local rituals and religious systems, remained unaffected by the application of the ubiquitous interpretatio graeca, Graeco-Roman imagery and other aspects of Greek culture. 14 However, it has been convincingly argued that 'Hellenism' should not be viewed automatically as opposed to indigenous traditions: once transmitted to the Near East, Graeco-Roman cultural facets could come to serve as a medium by which a local culture could find renewed expression.15 But simultaneously, they would intro- duce a completely different historical, cultural, mythological and religious knowledge to the region.16 In neither case is the influence of Graeco-Roman culture on religious life in the Near East easily quantifiable. An ongoing process of hellenization is certainly insufficient to explain the developing nature of the local cultures in the region: new traditions, once introduced alongside the native traditions, could become 12 According to G. Bowersock, Hellenism in Late Antiquity (Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1990), p. 15-6, it was only Greek that "met that need". 13 See J.F.A. Sawyer, Sacred Languages and Sacred Texts (London: Routledge, 1999), on the relationship in general between 'sacred' languages and texts fulfilling certain religious functions.

Sartre, L'Orient romain (n.9), p. 496: "II ressort de tout cela que l'interpretatio Graeca est au mieux un vernis superficiel, destine a donner aux dieux et aux sanctuaires de Syrie un aspect gr6co-romain. Mais ni la nature des dieux ni la cel6bration du culte ne s'en trouvent r6ellement affectees." But see now his D'Alexandre a Zenobie (n.2), p. 287-9, for a more balanced view. Cf. M.

The epigraphist Javier Teixidor, in what is still one of the very few academic efforts to deal with aspects of religion in the Near East as a whole, concluded that "popular religion must have remained practically unchanged in Greco- Roman times, for the inscriptions do not reflect the impact of new fashions".18 He further argued that the religious practices sometimes show "a bourgeois content- ment"19 and that "it was this traditional confidence that made pagan religion so popular".20 But to conclude that pagan religious practice in the Near East did not undergo changes in the Roman period because of the static nature of the documentary evidence is in itself a risky assumption, as it passes over the fact that religious inscriptions commonly applied standard formulaic patterns which did not necessarily continue to refer to the same notions over time.21 The misleading presentation of the divine world in literary sources How can one ascertain the validity of the interpretation of evidence from a local religion in the context of evidence from elsewhere in the Near East, or even from outside this wider region, without falling into the trap of creating constructs similar to 'Oriental religion'? In other words, is it possible to demonstrate that a 'local religion', i.e. the religious life of one particular place, was indeed first and foremost local, without using comparative evidence at particular stages of the argument? Naturally, it is not. Issues concerning 'the particular' cannot be understood properly without resort- ing to 'the general', and it is undeniable that the imbalance in spread of evidence has shaped the way in which modern scholars present their material. The challenge must therefore be to use the full range of sources in such an integrated way that this imbalance can be redressed. 1 7 For an attempt to apply this model, based on recent sociological studies, to the local cultures of the Roman Near East, see T. Kaizer, 'The "Heracles Figure" at Hatra and Palmyra: Problems of Interpretation' in Iraq 62 (2000), p. 219-32.

To be sure, there was no such thing as a 'Semitic pantheon' underlying the multitude of divine worlds which populated the Near East in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. The modem division of the divine world of the region into a Phoenician, an Aramaean and an Arab pantheon, which correspond to each other without being identical,22 is a grave oversim- plification. It is even debatable whether there were any 'local pantheons' in the region, at least when we interpret a pantheon as an organised and somehow structured assemblage of divine beings in which each deity's place and function result from continuous interac- tion with others.23 As far as our evidence can tell us, there are only vague relations between the divinities worshipped in places such as Palmyra, Hatra, Edessa, the Nabatae- an region and the cities of the Decapolis.24 And a presentation of the genealogy of a divine world such as the one by Philo of Byblos (with regard to the Phoenician gods) ought to be explained as a literary construct rather than as truly representing an institu- tionalised religious system.25 The contemporaneous co-existence of so-called 'supreme gods' within a divine world, which has so often been embraced by modem scholars in their quest for the measuring of an assumed dormant, and as yet not fully developed, monotheism among the Semites, may point to the presence of more than one main cultural sphere of influence, rather than to a strictly organised and hierarchical pantheon. Although it would be absurd to claim that we can actually know the 'true nature' or 'personality' of Near Eastern gods in the Roman period, it is possible to catch glimpses of the variations in standing that a deity could have in different religious contexts. But our source material has severe limitations. The evidence mainly consists of epigraphic and sculptural material and the remains of temples. We know close to nothing with regard to the mythological realms of the various local religious worlds, most of which were delineated orally.26 And early Christian authors have managed to distort our understanding and appreciation by publishing deliberately oversimplified interpreta- tions of the divine worlds which surrounded them. As regards the contemporary 22 Sartre, L'Orient romain (n.9), p. 490: "Le premier aspect qu'il faut souligner est la presence de pantheons diff6rents, qui se recoupent sans etre identiques." 23 I may be too sceptical on this point.

These texts, the Phoenician History by Philo of Byblos, De Dea Syria (ascribed to the satirist Lucian of Samosata) and a section on pagan cults in the enigmatic Syriac Oration of Melito the Philosopher, all reveal a mythological interest in the past, paralleling a trend which in the Graeco-Roman world had its most obvious exponent in Pausanias' Descrip- tion of Greece.27 Thus in De Dea Syria various contradictory traditions with regard to the foundation of the temple of Atargatis in Hierapolis are listed28, an aspect which has long since contributed to academic pleas for an authentic authorship of Lucian, "producing a deliberate linguistic parody of Herodotus".29 Regardless of the problems of authorship, which are now settled beyond reasonable doubt by Jane Lightfoot's major commentary, the huge inconsistency inherent in these passages can be perceived as striking: interpreta- tive statements seem to be at odds with documentary evidence. But to what degree the coexistence of different and 'contradictory' traditions also shocked the inhabitants of the ancient world remains to be seen. I remain unconvinced by Andreas Feldtkeller's sugges- tion that we should see the different aetiologies in De Dea Syria as a sign of the disagreement of the local population with 'official cult theology'.30 In contrast, one of Keith Hopkins' time-travellers to ancient Hierapolis may have captured the spirit of the times better when he "realised that having a variety of accounts, instead of a single 'true' account, made some sense", which he supposed "in a minor way ... was a conversion".31 A closer look at the relevant 'pagan' section in the otherwise Christian Oration of Melito the Philosopher may serve to cast light on the confusion which its contents cause about the notion of 'the particular' and 'the general' in Near Eastem cults. As this unique Syriac text is not well-known outside the field of Oriental Studies, I deal with it 27 See the commentaries by respectively A. Baumgarten, The Phoenic ian History of Philo of Byblos.

The traditions listed in De Dea Syria would not necessarily have been recognizable to the actual worshippers in the temple at Hierapolis.</page><page sequence="8">In Search of Oriental Cults 33 here at some length. It is preserved only in the same British Museum manuscript which also contains the famous Book of the Laws of Countries or the Dialogue on Fate by Bardaisan of Edessa, and has not been edited since the discovery of the manuscript in the mid-nineteenth century.32 Possibly written in the early third century AD, this "remarkably frustrating Syriac text"33 does not seem to be what it claims to be, 'a discourse of Melito the philosopher before Antoninus Caesar' (m'mr' dmylytwn pylswp'dhw' qdm 'ntwnynws qsr). Although Cureton maintained that the text was from the second-century Melito bishop of Sardes in Asia Minor34, the Greek fragments of a speech addressed to Marcus Aurelius by this Melito, included by Eusebius of Caesarea in his Ecclesiastical History (IV 26), do not correspond with our Syriac text. Indeed, the fact that Melito is explicitly called 'the philosopher' in the Syriac text may indeed lead us to suggest that the latter was composed shortly after its model, the apology of Melito of Sardis as presented by Eusebius, became known in the Near East.35 It is unclear which emperor is meant by the 'Antoninus Caesar', before whom the discourse claims to have been presented. It is possible that the author meant Marcus Aurelius, if only because he wanted to give his text some cachet by addressing the same emperor as the historical apology of Melito of Sardis. In any case, if the claim in the Syriac text, of having been addressed to a Roman emperor, is correct, there will at least have been a Greek counterpart, or even a Greek original, for the actual address. But it is equally possible that the text of the Syriac Oration is an example of pseudonymity and that it was never addressed to an emperor at all. The Oration of Melito starts with an exposition of the distinction between that which truly exists and is called God and that which does not exist, followed by an account of how mankind went astray. This fascinating passage takes a euhemeristic form, and describes how particular deities were worshipped by a particular people, region or city, in acknowledgement of their benign benefactions. I will quote the relevant section in full:36 32 The most accessible publication of the text is still Cureton, Spicilegium Syriacum (n.27), p. 22-31 (Syriac text), p. 41-51 (translation), with notes to the text on p. 85-95.

Gabba argued that the Syriac Oration was written under Caracalla or Elagabal. 36 The following is my translation (based on the one made by Cureton) of the whole euhemeristic account within the Oration, and not just of those sections relating to the Near East (cf. p. 24 1.15 - p. 25 1.23 of Cureton's Syriac text). I have aimed to stay as close to the Syriac text as possible, which may occasionally have resulted in artificial English. Personal, divine and place names are followed by the Syriac words in brackets. Footnotes are kept to an absolute minimum.</page><page sequence="9">34 TED KAIZER I, then, according to what I know, I will write and show how and for what reasons images were made for kings and for rulers, and why they became like gods ('yk 'ihyn). The people from Argos ('rgws) made images for Heracles (hrqls), because he was a son of their town and powerful, and because he killed with his courage wicked animals, and especially because they were afraid of him, for he was forceful and carried off (in captivity) the wives of many, for his desire was great, as was that of zwrdy the Persian, his friend. Again, the people from Aqta ('qt') worshipped king Dionysos (dynwsws mIk') because he first brought the vineyard into their land. The Egyptians (msry') worshipped the Hebrew Joseph (ywsp 'hry'), who is called Serapis (srps), because he provided them with food in years of famine. The Athenians ('tny') worshipped Athena ('tn')37, the daughter of Zeus (zws), king of the island Crete (qrt'), because she built the fortress Athens ('tns) and installed as king there her son rktyps38, who was (born) for her from adultery with the smith Hephaestus (hwpsts), the son of the wife of her father. And always she spent time with Heracles (hrqls), because he was her brother via her father, for king Zeus loved Alcmene ('iqymn'), the wife of Electryon ('Iq!rywn), who was from Argos ('rgws), and committed adultery with her, and she gave birth to Heracles. The people from Phoenicia (pwnyq') worshipped Belti (blty), the queen of Cyprus (qwprws), because she fell in love with Tammuz (tmwz'), the son of kwtr39, king of the Phoenicians (pwnyqy'), left her kingdom, came and dwelt in Byblos (gbl), the fortress of the Phoenicians, and at that very time enslaved all Cyprians (kprwn') to king kwtr. Because before Tammuz she had fallen in love with Ares ('rws), and she committed adultery with him, and her husband Hephaestus seized her and envied her. He came, killed Tammuz at Mount Lebanon (Ihbn twr') while he was hunting boars (?).40 From that time Belti remained in Byblos, and she died in the town Aphaca ('pq'), the place where Tammuz was buried. The Elamites ('ylmy') worshipped nh"1, the daughter of the king of Elam ('ylm). When enemies led her away in captivity, her father made her an image and a temple in .fw4n, the palace in Elam. The Syrians (swryy') worshipped Atti ('ty), a woman from Adiabene (hdybyt'), who sent the daughter of blt, a nurse, and she cured Simi (symy), the daughter of Hadad (hdd), the king of Syria (swry'), and after some time, when leprosy came over Hadad, that same Atti beseeched the Hebrew Elisha ('ly&amp;' 'bry'), and he came and cured him from his leprosy. The people from Mesopotamia (byt nhryn) also worshipped the Hebrew woman kwtby, for she rescued Bakru (bkrw), a patrician from Edessa ('wrhy), from his enemies.42 On Nebo (nbw) then, who is in Mabog/Hierapolis (mbwg), why shall I write to you? For behold, all the priests who are in Mabog know that this is the image of Orpheus ('rpwvs), the Thracian magian (mgw.?' trqy'), and Hadaran (hdrn), this is the image of Zaradusta (zr'dK.t), the Persian magian (mgws' prsy'), because these two practised magianism to a well which was in the forest near Mabog, for there was an impure spirit (rwh' tnpt') in that well, harming and assaulting anyone who wanted to pass by that place in which in the present time the fortress of Mabog is situated. And they, as magians, ordered Simi, daughter of Hadad, to draw water from the sea and to put it in the well, so that the spirit would not ascend and harm people, 'according to that which was a mystery in their magism'.43 And like this, also the rest of mankind made images for their kings and worshipped them, which I will not describe further. 37 Note that 'tn' is also the word for she-ass in Syriac. 38 According to Cureton "evidently an error for Erethonius or Erechteus." 39 Cureton referred to the Ktv6paq of the Greeks. 40 The Syriac text at this point reads kd 'bd hnyr' bwrz', but Cureton argued that "there is no such word as hnyr'. It is evidently an error of the copyist for nhsr' or nhsvr', 'hunting'." 41 Both Cureton and Renan suggested another blunder by the manuscript's copyist for 'nyy, the goddess Anaitis/Anais. 42 See now Ross, Roman Edessa (n.24), p. 85, who argues that "Kutbai at Edessa may have been a manifestation of Nebo, who was the god of literature and the arts, among other things". 43 This last line is taken literally from Cureton's translation.</page><page sequence="10">In Search of Oriental Cults 35 The longest and very wordy part of the Oration then follows, in which Melito advises the emperor not to direct his worship towards man-made images, but instead to the only God who made them all. If the emperor acknowledges this God of justice, he will be able to guide his empire in peace. The euhemeristic account clearly forms a 'break' in the text, and this has naturally led scholars to interpret it as coming from a different and possibly Greek source.44 In any case, in none of the above-quoted passages does the author provide us with anything like an authentic 'insider's' view: 'standard' mytholo- gy and local variations are irretrievably mixed up.45 Travel to sacred centres The Oration of Melito is a prime example of the oversimplifying accounts which have distorted our view of the pluralist polytheistic religious world of the Near East. There is no doubt that their readership knew very well that worship of individual deities was not restricted to one particular locality or region. But it remains a fact that the linking of a god or goddess with a specific place could catch the imagination of readers and worshippers alike, resulting in the place's pre-eminence as a sacred centre in the cult of the respective god or goddess. According to one interpretation, a deity who was of special importance in a particular locality had a 'functional importance' in that place which was substantially more extensive than his or her 'supraregional importance' within a wider polytheistic religious system.46 But even if one temple was known to accommodate the most 'intensi- fied' version of a deity, it is clear that he or she could be worshipped enthusiastically also in many other places throughout the wider region.47 Conversely, it can be noted that "possession of a sacred center was not, of course, a precondition of universality".48 On 44 See H.W. Attridge and R.A. Oden, De Dea Syria, Graeco-Roman Religion 1 (Missoula, Mont: Scholars Press for the Society of Biblical Literature, 1976), p. 1, who claim that it "is plainly a distinct and originally Greek section of this Syriac work". See also R.A. Oden, Studies in Lucian's De Syria Dea (Missoula, Mont: Scholars Press for Harvard Semitic Museum, 1977), p. 127-32, and Drijvers, Cults and Beliefs at Edessa (n.24), p. 93. 45 Note how, at the end of the second century, Tertullian had written in his Apologeticus (24.8) how "unicuique etiam provinciae et civitati suus deus est", linking Atargatis to Syria and Dusares to Arabia. A later text in which deities are similarly connected with particular localities, mostly situated in the Near East, is Jacob of Sarug's Discourse on the Fall of the Idols. In this sixth- century homily, the author preaches how 'Satan' had provided Ephesos with Artemis, Rome with Zeus, Antioch with Apollo and other divinities, Edessa with Nebo, Bel and many other gods, Harran with Sin, Baal-Shamin, Bar-Nemre the lord of the dogs, and the goddesses Tar'ate and Gadlat, Aqaron with Beelzebub, the Moabites with Camosh, the Amonites with Malkom, and Sidon with Astarot. For the text and what is still the standard translation, see M. I'Abbe Martin, 'Discours de Jacques de Saroug sur la chute des idoles' in Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgen- landischen Gesellsclhaft 29 (1875), p. 107-47.

Naturally, there will have been many who crossed the boundaries of their own physical environment or conceptual homeland only seldom. And it is clear that there may have been quite extensive and disproportionate variations in both the number and the variety of the clientele of the many local and regional cult centres in the Hellenistic and Roman Near East. In short, temple complexes located in the interior lands of this wider region reveal less evidence of visitors from elsewhere than focal points of worship situated on the coast or within the Fertile Crescent. But this is not to say that all sanctuaries on or near the significant channels of transport and communication which stretched across the Near East attracted crowds of worshippers from everywhere.49 It seems to be in contrast with the Graeco-Roman world at large that there were no 'oracular cult centres' in the Levant.50 In Asia Minor, especially at the sanctuaries in Claros and Didyma, Apolline oracles blossomed in the Roman period, as is known both from abundant references in the Classical sources and from the epigraphic records at the sites themselves.51 Our evidence, however, is simply not good enough to discern similar patterns of 'pilgrimage' further east. As elsewhere in the Classical world, Near Eastern deities were well able to transmit freely their messages to man. But the evidence with regard to the advice that the local gods could give via dreams or other channels of transmission should not be automatically interpreted as referring to 'oracu- lar' cults. There was no need for worshippers to travel to one particular sacred centre, as the gods chose to communicate with them at various places. With the exception of the Temple at Jerusalem, whose unique position in the Jewish world resulted in visits from far away which were not only of a devotional but also of a 'normative' character, our limited source material suggests that, in the Near East, the great majority of the temple clientele and of attendants at any festival came from the immediate hinterland (even if that is not what the rhetoric of the De Dea Syria proclaims).52 Notions of 'travel', 'tourism' and 'pilgrimage' are of course completely 49 Which may be the impression after reading through MacMullen, Paganism in the Roman Empire (n.5), esp. p. 18-34, who incorporates Near Eastern material in his synthetic discourse on the pluralist religious worlds of the Roman Empire. 50 This statement is made in full awareness of literary references to imperial visits and inquiries made to the god of the Carmel by Vespasian (Tac., Hist. II.78; Suet.,.Vesp. 5), to Zeus Kasios by Hadrian (SHA, Had. 14) and Julian the Apostate (Lib., Or. 18.172), and to Bel of Apamea by Septimius Severus (Dio 79.8.5-6), or of the presentation of Apollo as an oracular god at the temple of Hierapolis (De Dea Syria 35-7). This and other material is conveniently assembled by Y. Hajjar, 'Divinites oraculaires et rites divinatoires en Syrie et en Phenicie a l'epoque greco-romaine' in ANRW II 18.4 (1990), p. 2236-320. But the title of his catalogue seems to make too much of the evidence and runs the risk of implying discrepancies which are not necessarily the case between gods who are listed and gods who are not. 51 See in general H. Parke, The Oracles of Apollo in Asia Minor (London &amp; Dover, N.H.: Croom Helm, 1985), esp. p. 69-92, and R. Lane Fox, Pagans and Christians (Harmondsworth: Viking, 1986), p. 168-261. 52 Pilgrimage to the Temple at Jerusalem was not, however, rigidly restricted to Jews, as is shown by evidence for the participation of 'Greeks' and other gentiles in the annual feasts of the Jewish calendar. See E. Schiurer, The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ II, edited by G. Vermes and F. Millar (Edinburgh: T &amp; T Clark Ltd, 1979), p. 76 and p. 309-13.

This is of course partly a problem of reportage, in the same way that Pausanias seems deliberately blind as regards fairs, but not festivals, in Roman Greece. In any case, stressing the important socio-religious functions that the local cult centres had within their surrounding region is not to insist on the absolute absence of travellers from far away. But the relatively few foreigners who were present at any festival could just have "added greatly to the prestige of the festival".57 Many cult sites in the Near East consisted of tiny chapels within a sacred enclosure (a 'hima' or 'haram')58, which were supposed to be the dwelling-place of a deity; but shrines and sanctuaries were not the only places which were inhabited by the divine, pilgrimage' in Idem (ed.), Sacred Journeys.

The travellers who invoked divine protection for their essentially non-religious journey shade into the pilgrims whose religious voyage could embrace many material opportunities."

Accordingly, the very fact that visits to a certain centre became attractive may have aroused interest among other potential visitors, a process which in itself contributes to a further differentiation of motives for visiting a sacred place. The sanctuaries on the Phoenician coast, the enclosure of Atargatis at Hierapolis ("presented as absolutely primary in its holiness"60) and indeed the Temple at Jerusa- lem all boasted impressive histories. In contrast, some of the cult centres in the interior lands of the Near East seem to have emerged, or at least developed suddenly, only in the Roman period. And it could be suggested that it is precisely such a lack of "involvement with the past"61 that had a direct bearing on the absence of centres of pilgrimage in the Near Eastern steppes that attracted visitors from outside their own territorium.62 Nonetheless, it ought to be taken into account that notions of tradition could be ascribed to newly introduced modes of religious life as well: the main temple in the central temenos of Hatra, which dates from the early second century AD, and whose predecessor seems - according to the most recent excavations - not to predate the beginning of our era, is called sgyl in the local dialect, which must be a reminis- cence of the famous Esangila of Marduk-Bel in Babylon.63 It is of course unclear how far such a 'reconstitution of the past' resulted from a certain nostalgia or from a quest for identity, and it is equally unclear to which degree 'new traditions' could become considered authentic in their new setting.64 If none of the Near Eastern sanctuaries wanted to attract large crowds in order to spread particular forms of belief to as many worshippers as possible, some of them still managed to draw more visitors than others, which would have resulted from a variety of factors. The interplay of those factors has been formulated as 'spiritual magnetism', of which three variables (in addition to the appearances of divine beings) are distin- guished: miraculous cures, sacred geography and difficulty of access65, features which 59 On the other hand, it is important to realise "how the religious response to particular landforms can only be understood in terms of a system that reaches far beyond the locality." Thus Horden and Purcell, The Corrupting Sea (n.53), p. 440. 60 Elsner, 'Describing Self in the Language of the Other' (n.29), p. 152. 61 A formula taken from P.

Bounni, 'Palmyre, ville de pelerinage' in Bulletin d'Etudes Orientales 52 (2000), p. 195-7. In contrast, what happened in Hierapolis, or at least what the author of De Dea Syria claims to happen in Hierapolis, looks much more like 'pilgrimage'. Compare J.L. Lightfoot, 'Pilgrims and Ethnographers: in search of the Syrian Goddess' in J. Elsner and I. Rutherford (eds.), Pilgrimage in Graeco-Roman and Early Christian Antiquity: Seeing the Gods (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 333-52. 63 See Kaizer, 'Some remarks about the Religious Life of Hatra' (n.24), p. 235, for further references. 64 Cultural continuity (in contrast to mere influence) can hardly ever be proved, although some cases may seem very plausible. The below-described 'canonical' portrayal of Jupiter Dolichenus is "an unmistakable borrowing" from much older Hittite reliefs found in the same region, see Millar, The Roman Near East (n.2), p. 249. Occasionally, the archaic sculptures were re-employed in the late Hellenistic and Roman period, see e.g. LIMC 8 (1997), s.v.

This development, hardly traceable in itself, must have taken place spontaneously. If people travelled or emigrated, they tended to pay homage to their 'ancestral' gods on foreign sand, while on the other hand the introduction of new deities on return to the home town was never excluded. Multifarious idolisation Literary sources discussing pagan cults in the Roman Near East, with their limited scope, are seriously delusive as regards the way in which the divine world of the region was built up. And the apparent repute of some of the great local cult centres, where deities who were worshipped throughout the region attracted noteworthy attention, ought to be viewed in the context of an assorted distribution of sacred sites with their own individual historical and topographical circumstances. Considering the empire as a whole, "the lack of an articulated religious system that integrated both ritual and belief' has been stressed recently in order to explain the fact that the Romans "were apparently quite content to accept that things worked differently in cult from how they did in myth, even if that meant that a god could simultaneously be multiple and singular, local and universal".67 Indeed, this may have lain behind the development of additional divine names. As regards the Classical Greek world, tensions between cultic realities and the Panhellenic pantheon are more easily pinned down. But the quest for an Oriental pantheon will always be frustrated due to the lack of anything comparable to Homer and Hesiod. The absence of coherent mythological accounts in the Hellenis- tic and Roman Near East which were spread over the whole region in more or less 'fixed' written formats will have aggravated the multifariousness of forms of appear- ance of 'a' deity. And one could argue that this was further intensified by the multiplic- ity of the collective memory of the worshippers, which contributed concomitantly to the unconscious conceptualisation of a 'basic' fabric of aspects of the divine world.68 It is tempting, then, when studying the evidence mainly dating from the Roman period, to focus on those forms of worship which create the impression that they are the more 'original' and 'indigenous' ones, and to extrapolate from this source material a com- mon denominator behind a deity who received cults in numerous societies and commu- nities. But sociological processes of 'archaicization', through which certain religious aspects could be endowed with distinction, may occasionally obscure our perceptions. 66 On Echmoun, see E. Lipinski, Dieux et deesses de 1' univers phenic ien et punique (Leuven: Peeters, 1995), p. 158-60, and for a study of the variety of sculptures from all periods found at the temple see R.A.

It is the modem historian's challenge to peel off in separate case- studies the layers of the 'Roman' evidence, to investigate how far particular aspects were actuated or even transformed by distinctive spheres of influence, and only then to see how near one can get to instances of 'Oriental cults'. The idea that gods and their cults have to be interpreted first and foremost as conditioned by their direct local context was propagated (with regard to Greek religion) in the nineteenth century by Karl Otfried Muller, who stated "dass derselbe Name im geordneten griechischen Gottersystem oft Verehrungen von sehr verschiedener Natur bezeichnet".69 Indeed, those aspects which together made up the religious system of a particular locality were themselves not always 'local' in character. But the fact that so many Near Eastern deities were named after localities (either at their own temple only, such as Zeus of Baetocaece, or away from their homeland, such as Jupiter Dolichenus) shows how their worshippers deliberately applied forms of cultural and possibly ethnic identification to them, and a closer look at this variegated evidence may contribute to a more complete understanding of the way in which different local societies were built up and conceived themselves.70 Two examples from Palmyra should suffice to illus- trate this point. A certain Wahballat erected an altar in the city 'for the god of Sa'bu, who is called the Gad of the Nabataeans'. This local or regional deity ('Ih s'h[w]), also known from two Nabataean inscriptions, is here explicitly referred to as the personified good fortune of the people to whom the dedicant doubtless belonged.71 But the inscription itself is written in the local Aramaic dialect of Palmyra. The same holds true with regard to another dedication at Palmyra made to a god known to have been worshipped amongst the Nabataeans: a Nabataean horseman (identified as such, nb!y' prs') set up an altar 'for Shai'-al-Qaum, the good and generous god who does not drink wine', the peculiar appellation being possibly a reference to a prohibition on the drinking of wine in his cult.72 The crux of the matter is that by deliberately inscribing their altars in the local Palmyrene dialect, rather than in their own language, which would always have been an option73, these Nabataeans - not deliberately - extended the local religious system of Palmyra. 69 K.O.

Belayche, 'L'Oronte et le Tibre' (n.3), p. 17, who pointed out that the 'exoticness' of cults coming from the East was also expressed "des le prononce du nom de la divinite, souvent un topique obscur et barbare, que le grec et le latin on transcrit phonetiquement avec une orthographie incertaine, en l'accolant (ou non) au generique jovien".

And the same could, obviously, also happen the other</page><page sequence="16">In Search of Oriental Cults 41 Those who worshipped a deity with the same name in the various localities in the Near East will have shared a certain focus in their worship of this god, although they may have operated quite differently from each other within their respective local contexts. Thus the god Bel received a cult in the Hellenistic and Roman periods in Babylon, Palmyra, Apamea, Edessa, and many other places.74 And in all these mani- fold local societies and communities, worship of Bel was indispensably incorporated into a local religious world, with the god in each case surrounded by different divine beings, his cult embedded in different topographical settings, and his main religious functionaries engaged in different socio-political careers.75 At the same time, spatial and geographical distinctions notwithstanding, a worshipper of Bel in one place will have perceived the cult of Bel in another place as belonging to the same 'network' as the one he knew from home, even if an additional name or title, which would have more emphatically given the god a common identity everywhere, was lacking. Rather than assuming one central 'cult of Bel', distributed over the Near East, one ought to view the problem the other way around. One can understand these occurrences of idolisation as local cults whose totality of pluralist identities serves to create the conception of an instance of a wider 'Oriental cult'.76 Iconography, exclusivity and organization of the divine world I have argued that the notion of a central 'theological orthodoxy', co-ordinating the cult of one particular deity throughout the Near East, is not supported by good evidence, and that it is methodologically more correct to approach the multifarious idolisation in the region in the Hellenistic and Roman periods from the local perspective. However, if this notion of a 'theological orthodoxy' can be left behind, it ought to be recognised that an 'orthodoxy of iconography' is often recognisable, although usually liable to a variable use of motifs and deviating details. The nearly 'canonical' type of Jupiter Heliopolitanus (occasionally he could be represented in a different manner) portrays the god as a beardless person with curly hair usually crowned with some sort of calathos, standing on a plinth, flanked by bulls, enclosed in a kind of sheath which is neatly divided in a varying number of sections displaying busts, and holding a whip in way around: in shrine XIII at Hatra, a remembrance inscription in the local Aramaic dialect ('Hatrean') relates a sculpture (in Palmyrene style) to the tutelary deity of that shrine, but it is added in Palmyrene Aramaic that it was dedicated to the goddess Allat. See W.I. al-Salihi, 'Palmyrene Sculptures Found at Hatra' in Iraq 49 (1987), p. 58 and pl.XIII-XIV, with PAT 1604. 74 See S. Dalley, 'Bel at Palmyra and Elsewhere in the Parthian Period' in Aram 7 (1995), p. 137-51, for a discussion of some of the relevant evidence. 75 With regard to virtually all instances, our understanding is severely limited by the available evidence. But we know e.g. that in the second half of the third century AD one of Palmyra's leading figures, Septimius Worod, fulfilled not only the symposiarchia of the priests of Bel, but also important civic functions as procurator of the emperor, ducenarius, and both duumvir and aedilis of the Colonia Palmyra, see PAT 0288 (AD 267). And at Apamea a priest of Bel served as head of the school of the Epicureans (6td5oXo; ?v 'AnagEia TCov 'ExtKoUpeiOV) in the middle of the second century AD, see J.-P. Rey-Coquais, 'Inscriptions grecques d'Apamee' in AAAS 23 (1973), p. 66-8.

Occasionally he is accompanied by his female counterpart, 'luno Dolichena', standing on a cow and holding sceptre and mirror.78 Atargatis, better known as 'the Syrian Goddess', was commonly associated with a lion, although it ought to be stressed that in her case there was no fixed iconography.79 Naturally, some of the main characteristics of one deity could be applied to another, as is shown by Palmyrene sculptures of Allat on which she is equally depicted as seated between two lions.80 But the latter goddess could also be represented in the same area as a warrior goddess, wearing a helmet and holding a spear and a shield, and by inclusion of the aegis assimilated with the Greek Athena.8' She is a clear illustration of a deity whose worshippers could apply two completely different - and non-competitive - iconographies within one and the same locality.82 Occasionally, 77 See Y.

The striking identifications of deities, as featuring in the literary texts, will have had their effect on the apparent ease with which divine names from different cultural backgrounds could be matched with particular deities.84 As the notion of exclusivity does not seem to have been present at a popular level in the polytheistic world of the Near East, worshippers could interpret deities from a divine world unknown to them, having in mind familiar deities whose characteristics were thought to correspond with those from the unknown ones. Naturally, different worshippers would make different interpretations, as different worshippers would emphasise different aspects of different deities.85 It is therefore not surprising that modems can easily be left so confused as to retreat into the (attractive but dangerous) option of creating scholarly chains of identi- fications between ancient deities. On a theological level, the question of exclusivity leads to a different discussion. How do Jupiter Optimus Maximus Dolichenus and Jupiter Optimus Maximus Heliopolitanus relate to Jupiter Optimus Maximus whose temple had stood on the Capitol in Rome for centuries? We should always keep in mind that "worshippers could literally make of him what they would"86: in Aquileia in North Italy a dedication was actually made to a composite deity 'Jupiter Optimus Maximus Dolichenus Heliopolitanus'!87 According to their names, the cults of IOMD and IOMH originated in the local religious systems of Doliche (located in the territory which had once formed part of the kingdom of Commagene)88 and Heliopolis-Baalbek (during an 83 On a relief from Khirbet el-Sane in the Palmyrene the goddess is seated between two lions and simultaneously depicted with helmet, aegis, shield and spear.

It has been argued by Feldtkeller that the penetration of gods from 'outside' into a local religious system would necessarily result in a conflict situation, as the new deities would be competing with those deities already settled within the local religious system who fulfilled similar functions.94 However, this limited point of view does not take into account that a number of deities could be covering partly the same 'field of interest', a field whose tenor could also be gradually modified and ought to be interpreted always within the context of a wider divine world.95 Feldtkeller's statement that a Pantheon 89 See now K.S.

This does not, of course, automatically assume a notion of 'resistance' to the religious establishment. But compare Elsner, 'The origins of the icon' (n.47). 92 To be fair, it ought to be stressed that, although both deities had a huge following in the empire as a whole, especially among the military (also on the Eastern frontiers), with regard to the Near East the cult of Jupiter Dolichenus penetrated other local religious systems only in the territory of Com- magene, while the cult of Jupiter Heliopolitanus was spread also in other parts of the wider region. 93 This is most clearly visible in evidence from outside the Near East, in surviving sculptures from the sanctuary of Jupiter Dolichenus on the Aventine in Rome which depict Apollo (Horig and Schwertheim, CCID [n.781, n? 380) or Heracles (CCID, n? 358), or show Dolichenus with Isis and Serapis (CCID, nOs365 and 386). Special mention ought to go to two inscriptions found in Dacia, where a certain 'Commagenian god' is mentioned alongside IOMD: CCID n? 147 (a dedication to IOMCommagenorum by a priest of IOMD) and no 148 (a dedication to IOMD et deo Commaceno).

Instead, the interaction between a framework of a set of local cults and the worship of deities who are in some way or another identified as coming from outside ought to be viewed in a more integrated manner. Even if it is not implausible that the literary notion of rationalisation had some influence on popular experiences, there is no good documentary evidence which would show how any local religious system in the Hellenistic and Roman Near East was organised in a clear-cut set-up providing the respective deities with ranks and levels of authority attuned to each other. The closest we may get to something like a 'composed' structure of a local divine world seems to be by taking into account numismatic evidence (even if the respective figures are mostly chosen separately): which deities are represented on coins of which city, in what way and accompanied by which legend? In a way, coins are more significant than individual dedications, since they come from a locality as a collectivity. But the fact that they therefore present, by nature, an official facade, also means that they do not always provide a reliable picture of the local divine world.97 Both on coins and by means of other visual media, the gods would be presented in a miscellaneous pastiche: one can easily trace the assimilation process, without grasping its full significance. In addition to the input of deities who are explicitly identified as coming from a particular locality, worshippers could apply Graeco-Roman imagery to give visual expression to their deities. Here, the main example is the so-called 'Heracles figure', who was almost never identified as 'Heracles' in the region, and who seems often assimilated with divergent indigenous gods such as Nergal, Melqart or Reshef.98 Furthermore, a deity who seems to have been taken over straight from the wider Graeco- Roman religious system could be incorporated in a Near Eastern divine world. It is still an enigma why the goddess Nemesis was identified a few times in Palmyrene inscrip- tions with an Aramaic transliteration (nmsys) of her Greek name, and as such counts as the only instance of the exact opposite of the common Palmyrene practice, by which the majority of the gods kept their indigenous names also in Greek transliteration.99 Finally, mention should be made of aniconic images, such as large stones, 'betyls' (sg.

More than a century after the creation of the Roman provincia Arabia, coins could still (or rather again?) be minted at Bostra depicting three betyls, symbolising Dusares, an important god within the region of the Nabataeans.100 In the cities of their former kingdom, the application of aniconic images was a widespread and characteristic phenomenon.10' But it was certainly not the only manner in which divine powers could be manifested. And what is more, virtually all attestations of these aniconic, non-anthropomorphic cults date from precisely the Roman period.'02 Thus, although there is abundant evidence to show both the use of aniconic cult objects in the Near East as a whole103 and the fact that the Classical authors knew about this contrasting form of worship,104 it remains uncertain how close this sort of imagery was to the heart of 'Oriental cults'.105 Conclusion This paper has sketched out some methodological issues with regard to the study of religious life in the Hellenistic and Roman Near East which are in need of further hypotheses to test.

It argued that conceptions (both ancient and modern) of 'Oriental cults' could be created by the cumulative effects of a variety of local cults, with their multifarious identities and their wide range of rituals. Local and universal aspects of idolisation ought therefore to be studied in a unified manner. On the one hand, the direct context should always be the basis for discussion of religious phenomena, as it was a particular society (or subgroup of society) that provided the framework within which a cult functioned. On the other hand, any local cult was also, simultaneously, a manifestation of patterns of worship known from the wider region, and a constant convergence of religious structures should be taken into consideration. Trying to find a way forward in the study of the cults of the Classical Levant, further exploration of the relevancy of those languages and dialects present in a certain area to the functioning of its religious structures remains one of the main desiderata. However, demarcating the wider region of the Near Eastern lands in terms of a linguistic force field, where the effects of the overlapping presence of Classical, Semitic and other Eastern languages could be felt, does not automatically imply that the study of the semantic features of individual cults will yield major results in each instance. In addition, models for the conceptualisation of local forms of rituals and of beliefs ought to be constructed in such a way as to encompass evidence for rural worship, without the need to fall back on the fashionable though ultimately unhelpful distinction between 'indigenous' and 'allochthonous' cults. In order to comprehend more fully the impact of first Hellenistic then Roman rule on the religious life of the Near East, the developing nature of what was there already, and the varying influences at work of what had been there in earlier phases, need to be taken more into account. What is left for us to see in the Roman period is a continuous interplay between deities from different cultural spheres of influence, a haphazard application of Graeco- Roman imagery to the divine world, and a multitude of deities that were deliberately identified as coming from elsewhere. And all of this universally, different for each locality. This diversity, however, does not necessarily show up in the eyes of the modern scholar. But it is this very diversity which should define the religious world of the Near East in the Hellenistic and Roman periods as a whole, and failure to recognise this has contributed to conceptions of 'Oriental cults'. It need not surprise us. Modern scholarship approaches the unified field of the Hellenistic and Roman Near East from a multitude of different angles, viewing it according to preference as Mesopotamian, Arab, Greek, Roman, Phoenician or Syrian. Behind a seemingly homogeneous concept looms a great deal of heterogeneity. It might well be, therefore, a unification of our miscellaneous approaches that would form the best guide in search of Oriental cults.
