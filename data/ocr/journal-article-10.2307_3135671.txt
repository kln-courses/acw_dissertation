<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIG IOUS EDUCATION The Socialization of Education The conception of the essential unity of the mind, says Albert B. Cunningham, is destined to be of large service to religious education. Under the old psychology the mind was supposed to have about as many divisions as it had functions to perform. There was a faculty for this and a faculty for that; and if one wanted to be religious he exercised his religious faculty without bothering in the least, say, his faculty for mathematics. But we have swung far away from this conception today. We look upon the mind as a unit; and as a unit it functions, no matter what its object. The value of this conception for religious education resides in that we are enabled to transfer over into religious education the pedagogical prin- ciples of secular instruction. The boy brings the same mind to Sunday school that he uses in the public school. We get near the real purpose of education when we say that it really is life itself. Morally and religiously then we must make the Sunday school life itself. That is, we must provide moral and religious situations differing in no wise, save in degree, from</page><page sequence="2">212 THE BIBLICAL WORLD adult situations, in which the children may sustain precisely the same relationships that they will encounter in adult experience. It is of supreme importance then that the Sun- day school should be a social unit. On a small scale it should be a reproduction of the sphere of adult activity. The boy who learns to conduct himself properly in this organization will not be long in getting his bearings in the social groups of adult life, for with slight variations all social groups are alike. Morality is largely a matter of the habit of right conduct in group life. We must therefore form habits of moral rectitude in our boys and girls by putting them in life-situations where they may react toward other people in an upright way. This can only be done when the Sunday school is socialized to conform to actual life con- ditions. The Dramatic in Sunday School and Church One of the surest ways in which to deepen the interest of the young people in the affairs of the church and Sunday school is to turn their passivity into activity by giving them something to do. W. B. For- bush, a recent convert to more modern methods, has contributed two articles to the Graded Sunday-School Magazine on the introduction of more of the dramatic ele- ment into our services. Three-fourths of all play is dramatic, and most of the child's time is spent in fancying imaginary situations which are all intensely dramatic; and yet we try to interest him by making him sit bolt upright in a chair and listen to a prosy harangue. The Bible is a most dramatic book, as any book must be that consists so largely of biographies. We lose most of the sense of the dramatic by the way we teach the Bible. The writer would disarm criticism by as- suring his readers that if dramatizing the Bible means merely aping the theatrical he wants nothing to do with it. He would at once make this distinction: that proper dramatizing is a means of self-expression, improper dramatizing is a self-exhibition. The dramatizing of a Bible story is not a "show"; it is a religious exercise. It is not done simply for the amusement of the audience, but for the benefit of the per- formers. It is intended for their religious education. Several illustrations are given indicating the ways in which biblical presentations may be made in an interesting and yet unpre- tentious manner. Boys are given the name of Bible heroes and each is required to give a five-minute sketch of "his own life," putting the narrative into the first person. The shorter epistles are condensed into abbreviated form, written in modern style, and addressed to some present-day person, class, or church. A child is asked to write an imaginary letter from Simon Peter to his wife just after he left home to follow his Master, telling what he is doing and how he is finding his new life. If one wishes to undertake something more elabo- rate, the life of Elijah or of any of the biblical heroes might be dramatized. The essential thing in all these devices is to identify each pupil with some char- acter other than his own, so that he may get inside and think his thoughts from within. Can the Child Experience God? Writing in the Graded Sunday-School Magazine, A. G. Wardle seeks to answer this question in the affirmative. Now can a child of tender years experience God ? Even by the adult God is experienced, in part at least, as immanent in his world. How much more will the little child find God in the created world about him: physi- cal blessings, home care, and nature's beauty. At first these will suggest nothing but comfort and pleasure to the child, but the Christian parent will connect them with the name of God, and the child will</page><page sequence="3">THE CHURCH AND THE WORLD 213 unconsciously be laying the foundation for the later conscious relating of all of life to the thought of God. As the child grows older and home care calls forth the consciousness of parental personality, God takes on the form of being in his mind, and in the receiving and appreciating of life's ministries to him he learns fellowship with God. From the consciousness of parental personality he passes easily to the conception of divine personality. There will doubtless be re- peated again the anthropomorphism of the Old Testament age. God will be a human father grown large. The motor-minded child will think in terms of physical prowess, as did the Hebrews of old; while the sensory-minded one will dwell in a sort of fairyland of the soul, and unless care be taken will imagine God to have a ghost existence with the ability to speak out of dark corners during the night hours. As the child passes out of the kinder- garten period to that of the primary de- partment, the parental conception of deity expands into that of ethical authority. God is then thought of as pleased with goodness and pained when the child goes wrong; and wrong is largely disobedience to parents and failure to conform to the morals of the group. But the sense of sin normal to the adult moral wreck and the introspective heart-searching consist- ent with later years are not to be expected in the tender age which so easily and naturally seeks God. These are not essential pre- requisites to the child's consciously relating himself to God-a fitting climax to the earlier years in which the sense of God has been that of delight in his presence and confidence in his care. Reconstructive Forces after the War We take the liberty of culling out a few thoughts dealing with the foregoing sub- ject taken from "Prospects of Liberal Education after the War," by President Chas. F. Thwing, in the Hibbert Journal. The author sees the world's attention given over to the one task of perfecting efficiency in order to destroy the menace of German efficiency. The years succeeding the war must of necessity be devoted to the repairing of the enormous material waste incurred. In the meantime an alarming number of the world's idealists, the poets, the seers, and the college men, have perished, for they were the first to respond. If the prize of higher idealism, for which we are fighting, is not to be submerged under the weapons of material efficiency, special thought must be given to what is termed "liberal education"; that is, education which liberates from narrow provincialism of any kind, education which teaches a man to appreciate as well as to weigh facts and construct things. The quartet of studies to which Dr. Thwing looks for the salvation of mankind are: history, in that it gathers up the experiences of the past; literature, in that it above all things is cosmopolitan and gathers up the experiences of all people--the four greatest poems are written in four different languages; philosophy, in that it seeks to appreciate and co-ordinate the fundamental and the true in all forms of learning; and religion, which represents God upon earth. "Religion gives a sky to the life of the community, a sense of infinity in the midst of its minute finiteness, and a God to a world living in the lust of the flesh and of the eyes. Thus interpreted, religion is to become the mightiest force in the rebuilding of man." No other forces are comparable to these. "They represent the eternal spirit of humanity of the past, they shall make the eternal spirit of human- ity in the future." But for the securing of these results one other factor must be reckoned with, the force of the teacher himself. In the teacher two forces are pre-eminent-personality and</page><page sequence="4">M14 THE BIBLICAL WORLD truth. If personality be lacking, the result is weakness; if truth be lacking, falseness and error will prevail. The teacher is him- self the great force in education. "Personal character devoted to duty, under the force of love, will be the guiding star of humanity. Do We Teach the Truth about the Bible? Under this caption Rev. E. L. Pell, D.D., writing in the Westminster Teacher, has some very pertinent remarks to make with reference to the way in which the Sun- day school and the home must share the responsibility for the loss of faith of many of our young men and women as they pass through college. Many people do not accept the Bible, not because they don't want to believe it, but be- cause they cannot believe it, and that for a very simple reason. That reason will be found in the vast gulf that yawns between the ideas of the Bible which they gathered in their childhood and the ideas of the Bible which they found floating about in the world when they grew up. Nobody ever told me when I was a child that God wrote the Bible with a pen made from a quill that he had plucked from an angel's wing. They only said that it was written by the finger of God. But some teachers never stop to reflect that if you don't explain what you mean to a child he is going to find an explanation for himself. And of course nothing was easier than to see God sitting on his throne, writing in a book in his lap, while the angel from whose wing he had plucked the quill stood by waiting to carry the book back down into the world as soon as it was finished. Nor was that all. Those early teachers, so far as I can recall, always spoke of God as the author of the Bible, just as they would speak of Dickens as the author of my Christmas book. I knew that Dickens had the help of a printer, but I thought that my Bible was all God's work, and if any i remained undotted or a t uncrossed God alone was re- sponsible for it. And the way those teachers would repeat those terrible words: "If any shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy." I have hardly gotten over the horror of it yet. "Our children will learn the stern reality soon enough; let us help them to enjoy life while they can," said our good mothers, and with the best of intentions they proceeded to trans- form child life into a beautiful fairyland. That is what is the matter with many a young man and woman just home from college today. So many of our young people go to college with a fairyland Bible. No wonder they come back with no Bible at all. What Can Be Done with a Postcard Some of the most effective means are those which lie right at our hands and are frequently overlooked because of their very nearness and simplicity. M. Florence Brown calls attention to the possibilities which lie unnoticed in the humble little messenger called a postcard. The beauty of a postcard rests in the fact that it is personal and it is concise; it bears your name, it bears a signature, and lack of space forces brevity in statement. While what follows is addressed particularly to Sunday-school workers, we are sure that the wide-awake pastor will find a hint or two. Little people like to receive a message through the mail with their own names written on the outside. What a thrill of importance is felt when the good-natured postman calls out the name, or when, as the case may be, the mail is brought to the father at the breakfast table and he singles out a piece and with great surprise and pomp hands it to the one-who-is- just-beginning-to-read. The new pupil who has just been enrolled is both surprised and flattered when he receives a pretty postcard with an expression of pleasure at his coming, the sincere hope that he will be at Sunday school the next Sunday, and a word about some "nice and special" thing that is to be done and the desire to have him help. Again, an invitation to some simple function in connection with the Sunday school seems to be much more interest- ing when addressed personally on a postcard. Memory work, and home work of any kind can be effectively stimulated in the same way. The tedium of a long illness is brightened con-</page><page sequence="5">THE CHURCH AND THE WORLD 215 siderably by a short message from the teacher frequently sent on a cheery-looking picture postcard. Considerable care must be given to the selection of the cards if they are of the picture type, and at all events it must be made the bearer of a personal message. All "mani- folded" communications lose half their flavor. You will find that it amply repays for the time expended; and many of the quaint and ingeni- ous little replies will give you a peep into their hearts, and will cause you pleasure indeed. Teacher Training For one month, from September 15 to October 15, the united effort of the Sunday- school forces of the evangelical churches of the United States and Canada, representing a Sunday-school membership of more than nineteen million, is to be centered enthusi- astically upon the promotion of teacher training during the coming winter. This Teacher-Training Drive has the following objectives: i. At least one teacher-training class in every Sunday school of North America, meeting at the Sunday-school hour. 2. A monthly worker's conference in every Sunday school, meeting at least ten months out of each year. 3. A midweek training class for present Sunday-school teachers in every Sunday school where such a class is needed. 4. A co-operative community training school of religious education for every com- munity where practicable; this school to have three functions: (a) to do graduate and specialization work; (b) to train leaders for classes in the local church; (c) to pro- vide central training-class facilities for those churches of the community unable to main- tain their own classes. The following general community pro- gram has been agreed upon: i. On September 22 the pastor of every evangelical church is asked to preach a sermon on "Teacher Training a National Necessity." 2. On the afternoon of this same Sunday an interdenominational community con- ference should be held to consider the best means of securing trained teachers for the Sunday schools of the community. 3. On this same Sunday an inspirational evening service, either a union service or a separate service in each evangelical church, should be held, having for its theme "The Importance of the Sunday School in the Present Crisis." 4. On some evening preceding Teacher- Training Sunday, and also on another evening following, there should be a worker's conference with supper to perfect plans for the coming Sunday and to conserve the results obtained. It is evident that these plans depend upon local co-operation. Unless pastors and superintendents enlist in active co-operation they cannot succeed. The program should command itself to all.</page></plain_text>
