      <p>Near the end of the first book of his <italic>Argonautica</italic>, Apollonius describes a ritual that Jason and his men must perform in honor of the Great Mother before she will allow them to depart the island of Cyzicus, where they have been confined by fierce winds. They perform this ritual while calling upon the goddess together with Titias and Cyllenus, who are said to be two of the Idaean Dactyls and special assistants to the Great Mother (1125–31):

            <p>. . . as they called upon the Dindymian Mother, the much-revered mistress who dwells in Phrygia, along with Titias and Cyllenus, who alone of the many Idaean Dactyls on Crete are called dispensers of destiny and ministers of the Idaean Mother. The nymph Anchiale once bore the Dactyls in the Dictaean Cave while clutching the ground of Oaxus with both hands.</p>
         </disp-quote>
At issue is Apollonius’ digression on the Idaean Dactyls and the way in which Anchiale creates them in the Dictaean Cave (lines 1129–31). Apollonius’ account is ambiguous and more than a little puzzling. What is Anchiale doing, and by what process do the Dactyls come into being?</p>
      <p>Modern scholars are divided on these questions, and even in antiquity there was debate about what precisely Apollonius’ account is supposed to envision, as the extant scholia to the <italic>Argonautica</italic> attest.<sup>1</sup> One tradition suggests that Anchiale creates the Dactyls autochthonously, like Pyrrha and Deucalion re-creating humans after the Flood, by taking handfuls of earth and pouring them through her fingers (schol. a on Ap. Rhod. <italic>Argon</italic> . 1.1126–31):<sup>2</sup>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>ὅτι δὲ νύμϕη τῆς Ἰἰαξίδoς γῆς δραξαμένη τoὺς καλoυμένoυς Ἰδαίoυς Δακτύλoυς ἐπoίησϵ, παρὰ Στησιμβρότoυ ϵἴληϕϵ. &lt;. . .&gt; καὶ ὅτι διὰ τῶν χϵιρῶν διϵρρύησαν, Δακτύλoυς κληθῆναι.</p>

         <disp-quote>
            <p>He took from Stesimbrotus the idea that the nymph, “taking handfuls of the earth of Oaxus,” made the ones called the Idaean Dactyls. &lt;. . .&gt; And they were called “Dactyls” because they flowed through her hands.</p>
         </disp-quote>
Another says that Anchiale produces the Dactyls anthropomorphically, grasping the ground in the throes of labor and giving birth to them just like the goddess Leto did when she gave birth to Apollo and Artemis on Delos (schol. e on Ap. Rhod. <italic>Argon</italic> . 1.1126–31):<sup>3</sup>

The confusion about the Dactyls’ origin springs from Apollonius’ use of two ambiguous words in line 1131, ἐβλάστησϵν and δραξαμένη, which represent all the action of the digression. This paper briefly surveys the semantic range of these verbs and shows that they can denote both autochthony and anthropomorphic childbirth. It suggests, however, that Apollonius’ ambiguity is meaningful, hinting at variant traditions and contemporary debates over the origin of the Dactyls. I argue that while Apollonius allows for both readings, parallel usages of βλαστά(ν)ω in the epic and an etymological wordplay with δραξαμένη suggest that he prefers the autochthonous <italic>aetion</italic> . Besides contributing to Apollonius’ aetiological and Alexandrian poetics, this passage clarifies why the Dactyls are the Great Mother’s special assistants and hints at why the Argonauts invoke them: the Argonauts must placate the Dactyls together with their true parent, the earth incarnated as the Great Mother, because they have slaughtered the Earthborn Men of Cyzicus, the Dactyls’ similarly autochthonous step-siblings and the children of the same Great Mother. Apollonius’ inclusion of the Dactyls as receivers of the ritual and his allusion to their origins from the earth thus signal the connection between the ritual and the slaughter for which it serves as atonement.</p>
      <p>The verb ἐβλάστησϵ is the clause’s main verb, of which Anchiale is the subject and the Dactyls the object. This word is formed from βλαστά(ν)ω, which denotes germination, growth, and production and can be used either intransitively (“to bud, sprout, grow”) or, more rarely and as Apollonius uses it here, with transitive force in a causative sense (“to make grow, produce”).<sup>4</sup> Properly, the verb denotes the production or growth of plants and other inanimate objects,<sup>5</sup> but it can also be used metaphorically to signify the birth of animals, abstract qualities or concepts, and children.<sup>6</sup> From a purely lexical standpoint, then, we cannot say for sure which Apollonius has in mind. The same problem holds for the participle δραξαμένη, which modifies Anchiale and takes γαίης Οἰαξίδoς, “the land of Oaxus,” as its object. This word is formed from δράσσoμαι, which denotes the act of grasping something with one’s hands, especially handfuls of small objects or of particulate matter.<sup>7</sup> The difficulty is that δράσσoμαι can be used of clutching the ground in pain (e.g., at Hom. <italic>Il</italic> . 13.393, where Asius is stabbed through the throat by Idomeneus’ spear and dies “grasping the bloody dust” [κόνιoς δϵδραγμένoς αἱματoέσσης]) or of grabbing objects with the aim of keeping hold of them or achieving some end through their use.<sup>8</sup> Interpreting δραξαμένη as “clutching” the ground in the throes of labor pain or as “grasping handfuls” of earth is equally plausible on lexical grounds.</p>
      <p>Of course, Apollonius had plenty of tools at his disposal to render the action clearly, so it seems likely that his ambiguous word choice is significant, especially in light of the complex and contradictory traditions associated with the Dactyls and their origins. They are variously said to have come from Phrygia, Crete, or Samothrace and to have been produced by Rhea, Anchiale, or the Curetes (with whom they are also sometimes identified).<sup>9</sup> Moreover, the scholia cited above and the other references to their parentage indicate that the Dactyls’ genesis was much contested in the mythological and literary tradition. Alexandrian poets frequently employed ambiguity and oblique allusion to encompass multiple variants like these.<sup>10</sup> We might compare debates over the etymology of the Argo, which Apollonius nods to at 1.111–12: αὐτὴ γὰρ καὶ νῆα θoὴν κάμϵ, σὺν δέ oἱ Ἄργoς / τϵῦξϵν Ἀρϵστoρίδης κϵίνης ὑπoθημoσύνῃσιν (“For [Athena] herself also fashioned the swift ship, and with her had Argus, son of Arestor, built it according to her instructions”). The poet does not link them explicitly, but he clearly suggests the derivation of the ship’s name from that of its shipwright as his favored explanation; an internal parallel at 1.18–19 corroborates this idea: νῆα μὲν oὖν oἱ πρόσθϵν ἔτι κλϵίoυσιν ἀoιδoὶ / Ἄργoν Ἀθηναίης καμέϵιν ὑπoθημoσύνῃσιν (“As for the ship, the songs of former bards still tell how Argus built it according to Athena’s instructions”). At the same time, the adjective θoή, “swift,” hints at an alternate derivation from ἀργός, “swift,” that occurs elsewhere.<sup>11</sup> Apollonius’ <italic>aetion</italic> of the Dactyls’ origins uses the same technique by keeping multiple explanations in view while signaling his preferred version through internal parallels and etymological wordplay, which I will now explore in detail. As we will see, Apollonius uses these to promote the autochthonous interpretation of the Dactyls’ genesis, which in turn helps to explain why the Dactyls are central to this portion of the epic’s narrative.</p>
      <p>Let us begin with the internal parallels, particularly for Apollonius’ use of βλαστά(ν)ω. The verb appears four other times in the <italic>Argonautica</italic> .<sup>12</sup> Apollonius uses it intransitively twice: metaphorically at 3.919–23, to denote the origin of heroes descended from divine blood, and in its proper sense at 4.1422–26, to denote the sprouting of plants as Orpheus greets the nymphs in the Garden of the Hesperides. Neither example constitutes a parallel for our passage. In the first example, the verb’s intransitive force obscures the method of production, conveying information about the heroes’ origins but not about their physical birth, and the poet qualifies the verb using the phrase ἀϕ’ αἵματoς, “from the blood” of the gods, stressing lineage rather than production.<sup>13</sup> The second example displays the proper usage of the verb to describe plant growth, so it offers little insight into what it means as applied to animate creatures.</p>
      <p>The remaining two instances of βλαστά(ν)ω are particularly relevant for understanding its meaning at 1.1131, as they are also transitive with causative sense and describe the wondrous origins of animate creatures by using brief aetiologies.<sup>14</sup> The first occurs when the Argonauts see Circe surrounded by half-formed beasts, which leads to an <italic>aetion</italic> on primordial life (4.676–80):

The second occurs when Apollonius describes the source of the first snakes (4.1513–17):

            </p>
         </disp-quote>
In both passages, the poet is discussing the autochthonous production of nonhuman creatures, in the first instance the earth’s initial experiments in creating animal life and in the second instance the origin of snakes from the blood that dripped from Medusa’s severed head. As in the passage about the Dactyls, the poet pauses in the narrative of both to provide an aetiology, and in each case the creatures under discussion are said to have sprung from the earth (ἐξ ἰλύoς ἐβλάστησϵν / χθὼν αὐτή, 4.676–77; oὖδας, 4.1516). Moreover, the number of offspring produced in each of these passages is significant. Circe’s creatures come out in a throng (ἀθρόoι, 4.674) and all the droplets (πᾶσαι, 4.1517) of Medusa’s blood give rise to a brood (γένoς, 4.1517) of snakes. For obvious reasons, autochthony lends itself to such mass production more easily than childbirth. The same is true of the Dactyls, of whom Apollonius suggests there are not a few: he says that Titias and Cyllenus are only two of the many Idaean Dactyls (πoλέων . . . ὅσσoι ἔασιν / Δάκτυλoι Ἰδαῖoι Κρηταιέϵς, 1.1127–29).<sup>15</sup> Given the many similarities between these passages, it seems probable that ἐβλάστησϵ at 1.1131 likewise points to the Dactyls’ autochthonous origins.</p>
      <p>We find stronger confirmation of this idea in the participle δραξαμένη and a subtle and previously unnoticed etymological connection between this word and the name Δάκτυλoι. As I noted, the set of scholia that understands the Dactyls to have been produced autochthonously alludes to an etymology for their name from the word δάκτυλoι, “fingers.” The scholiast says that they were born from the earth that ran through the hands of the nymph Anchiale (καὶ ὅτι διὰ τῶν χϵιρῶν διϵρρύησαν, Δακτύλoυς κληθῆναι). Moreover, the word δάκτυλoς is often derived from the verb δράσσoμαι, “to grasp,” since people grasp what is being given to them with their fingers (δάκτυλoς ἀπoβoλῇ τoῦ ρ· δράκτυλoς γὰρ ἦν ἀπὸ τoῦ δράσασθαι τὰ διδόμϵνα).<sup>16</sup> It is no coincidence that the two lines framing this digression begin with elements of these etymologies. As James O’Hara has shown, the placement of related words at the beginnings and endings of consecutive lines of poetry often serves as a marker of etymological wordplay, as does the placement of such words at the beginnings and endings of lines framing an entire passage.<sup>17</sup> Apollonius’ use of this “vertical juxtaposition” and “passage framing” in Δάκτυλoι and δραξαμένη at the start of lines 1129 and 1131 marks the connection between these words, encouraging the reader to retrace the derivation of the former from the latter (δραξαμένη → δράσσoμαι → δάκτυλoι generally → Anchiale’s life-producing δάκτυλoι → Δάκτυλoι). Readers must supply the word δάκτυλoι, “fingers,” but this kind of etymological “suppression” is common in Alexandrian poetry.<sup>18</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Apollonius uses similar etymological strategies in the poem’s most famous autochthony, the origin of the Spartoi, the men born from the teeth of the Aonian dragon whom Cadmus slays before founding Thebes and whom Jason must slay before obtaining the Golden Fleece. The poet nods to their etymology when he recounts Cadmus’ founding of the Theban race (3.1185–87):
<disp-quote>

               <verse-line>καί ῥ᾽ ὁ μὲν Ἀoνίoισιν ἐνισπϵίρας πϵδίoισιν  1185</verse-line>
               <verse-line>Κάδμoς Ἀγηνoρίδης γαιηγϵνῆ ϵἵσατo λαόν,</verse-line>

         <disp-quote>
            <p>Cadmus, son of Agenor, sowed his [teeth] in the Aonian plain and founded the earthborn people from all those left when Ares was reaping them with his spear.</p>
         </disp-quote>
While he never says their name explicitly, Apollonius alludes to it through the verb by which the Spartoi are produced, ἐνισπϵίρας (1185), from σπϵίρω, “to sow.” And just as their autochthonous generation is their essential quality (γαιηγϵνῆ . . . λαόν, 1186) and source of their name, so too the Dactyls acquire their significance through their associations with the Great Mother earth goddess and their name through the method by which they are produced from her.<sup>19</sup>
      </p>
      <p>We can see, therefore, that while Apollonius’ ambiguous verbs allow for both readings of the passage, he uses several techniques to encourage the autochthonous interpretation. Placement of both ἐβλάστησϵν and δραξαμένη at the end of the passage also helps mark that this digression is significant rather than a superfluous display of learning, since they are striking: “. . . the Idaean Dactyls, whom once the nymph Anchiale in the Dictaean Cave with both hands, grasping the earth of Oaxus . . .” leads the reader to expect a verb like ἔτϵκϵν, “gave birth,” so ἐβλάστησϵν comes as a surprise. The verb, which the poet uses only of exceptional creations such as Medusa’s snakes, Circe’s beasts, the Hesperides’ plants, or semi-divine heroes, is remarkable and signals that the Dactyls’ origins deserve special attention. This gives us pause to look more closely and notice the etymological play linking the Dactyls’ name to their manufacture from the earth. The suppressed etymology offers an oblique aetiology that explains why the Dactyls are special to the Great Mother, since as earthborn creatures they are more her children than Anchiale’s.</p>
      <p>This etymological and aetiological relationship between the Dactyls and the earth as the Great Mother (and as their true mother) clarifies why the Argonauts are performing this ritual for them in the first place. Titias and Cyllenus could, of course, be understood as mere accessories to the ritual, called on by the Argonauts only because they are servants of their actual audience, the Great Mother. But Apollonius’ complex wordplay suggests otherwise, especially in light of the “biological” relationship between the goddess and the Dactyls. At the same time, this connection between them explains the motivation behind the ritual, which the poet never explicitly states: in asserting their autochthony through these techniques, the poet ties the Dactyls’ <italic>aetion</italic> to the event that comes before it in the narrative, namely the Argonauts’ killing of the Earthborn Men (1.989–1011). Jason and his men slaughtered these children of the earth, and they must atone for this act by placating their nearest relatives, the Great Mother earth goddess and the Idaean Dactyls, their step-siblings related through autochthony.<sup>20</sup> Apollonius thus uses these allusions to tell not only how the Dactyls came to be, but also why they are important for this pivotal aetiological ritual.</p>
      <p>Apollonius’ ambiguous diction and complex poetic technique reveal active engagement with variant traditions, demonstrating both awareness of literary controversy and willingness to contribute specific interpretations to ongoing debates. Although only a short passage, this <italic>aetion</italic> displays all the hallmarks of Apollonius’ Alexandrian poetics and ties together the complex and competing strands from his predecessors into a coherent but polyvalent narrative whole.</p>
