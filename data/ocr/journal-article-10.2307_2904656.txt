Where and how, then, do these questions originate? Where, if any- where, do they lead? And what, if the preoccupations with place and sacred space, as can be surmised, should prove to be vulnerable to the appropriation by the most disastrous historico-political causes, could be undertaken in order to desert them and to vacate or dis- place the topoi they tend to privilege? What would it entail to wander off into a no- or non-place, to dwell, if one could say so, u-topically? What would it mean to question the primacy of the question "where?" Could one ascribe any intelligible signification to beings or Being out of all place, of which the whereabouts could no longer be determined by any ontology? Would it be more promising to define the task of thinking in view of a future atopics, utopology or utopogra- phy rather than in terms of a topography or topology? And, could such a thinking still be thought along the lines of an Erirterung in the sense Heidegger has given to this word? What, finally, are the ethico-political or topolitical ramifications of each of these endeav- ors to situate thought? Within the limited space of this article, it cannot be pretended to provide a detailed answer to these questions. The following remarks should be read, therefore, as nothing but an attempt at preparing the ground for them. For this purpose, it will be necessary to discuss some dieux-dits and lieux-dits as they appear in the writings of Nancy, Levinas and Derrida. These authors, in turn, respond the question- ing of place in the texts of Heidegger, most notably in his commen- taries on the poetic work, the Dichtung, of Holderlin and Trakl. I.

This question provides for a very different inquiry into the concepts, the names and the tropes or, more precisely, the topoi of the divine, more in particular of its empty or open spaces, than all those other discourses about the 'Other,' which reduce this prob- lem to that of linguistic insufficiency or ineffability. Each of these so- called apophatic discourses, ranging from the figures of negative theology of Pseudo-Dionysius to Eckhart and Angelus Silesius, up to the atomistic premises which lead Wittgenstein's Tractatus logico- philosophicus to its very conclusion (Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, dariiber muff man schweigen"), would presuppose yet another, more fundamental suspension, retreat or dispersion, which Nancy sets out to bring to light with the help of a remarkable fractured topology. Seen in that perspective, Des Lieux divins would be nothing less than the attempt to elucidate and to situate the historical and epochal displacement resembling a relentless Dei paralysis progressiva.2 In our modern epoch the question and the naming of the divine would have taken on the form of an ongoing reduction, which, as a continuous process of erosion, as a reductio perennis, that is, never reaches solid ground. This process, Nancy writes, has had the effect of an irrevocable diffusion of the divine, of the deity and of gods, and this well beyond the point of their being recognizable as sepa- rate and significant-immortal, eminent or infinite-entities: 'God,' the motif or theme of God, the question of God, no longer means anything to us. Or else-as is all too obvious to an unbiased eye-what the theme of God might mean to us has already moved or been carried entirely outside of him. Is there any statement about the divine that can henceforth be distinguished, strictly speaking, from another about 'the subject' (or its 'absence'), 'desire,' 'history,' the 'other' [autrui], 'the Other,' 'being,' 'speech,' 'the sublime,' 'community,' and so on and so forth? It is as if 'God' were in fragments, an Osiris dismembered through- out all of our discourse (indeed there are those who will now continue to speak of the divine in terms of explosion, dispersal, suspension, etc.). As if the divine, God, or the gods formed the common name or place- divins (Mauvezin: Editions Trans-Europ-Repress, 1987).

(112/3-4, translation modified) Nancy shies away from Jean-Luc Marion's suggestion, stated in L'Idole et la distance, that it is precisely in this discovery of the struc- tural insufficiency of the principle of reason-in the uncovering, that is, of a "principle of insufficient reason," culminating in the death of the ontotheological and moral conception of God-that theology, as the privileged discourse of difference or, rather, 'dis- tance,' can take its chances and finally conquer its proper place. For, in the very distance from everything else, from beings and Being and, as it were, even from 'itself,' the religious and theologi- cal notion of 'God' loses all specificity and thereby all relevance: far from being rediscovered, God disappears even more surely and defin- itively through bearing all the names of a generalized and multiplied difference. Monotheism dissolves into polyatheism, and it is no good asserting that this polyatheism is the true word and the true presence of God in his distance from the supreme Being of metaphysics. For the infinitely absent god ... should no longer be termed 'God,' nor be pre- sented in anyway as 'God' or as divine .... there is no theology that does not turn out here to be either ontological or anthropological-saying nothing about the god that cannot immediately be said about 'event,' about 'love,' about 'poetry' . . . (113/4). On the one hand, this implies that the language of 'modernity' subtracts the privilege to speak of "the Other, the Infinitely-other, the Other-infinite" from the jurisdiction of so-called theology; the proper negativity of our present and future thoughts seem to enable us to address the "absconditum" (113/5) that was formerly reserved for esoteric discourse only. And yet, on the other hand, this secular- ization or, rather, becoming-exoteric of the absolute, places thought in a paradoxical situation. Nancy describes this aporia in no uncertain terms: In baptizing or abysses with the name of God, we are guilty of at least two errors or incoherencies: we fill in the abysses by attributing a bottom to them, and we blaspheme ... the name of God by making it the name of something. On the other hand, the most subtle-and most theological- error would doubtless consist in believing that the infinite cannot provide a bottom and that naming a person [for example, 'God'] is not naming a sort of 'thing.' (113/5)</page><page sequence="5">M LN 449 Not only would this aporia belong to the very nature of theological discourse, but the slippage and, indeed, the blasphemy would be as old as 'Western' thought itself. Here, we would find the unavoidable and, in a sense, transcendental, illusion of all discourse, whether written or oral. The word and the notion 'god' would always be accompanied by precisely this "dual temptation," to wit: the seduc- tion of 'baptizing' all experiences of the limit of our world with nothing less than a divine name, and to desire to protect this name and the obscurity of our experience from idolatry and superstition. This double and yet incoherent allegiance to two types of naming, of ascription and of apohasis, cannot be resolved as long as one continues to move within the horizon of reference, that is of positive and negative attribution only. And if 'god,' as Nancy insists, is nei- ther "a manner of speaking" nor some "ultimate truth of mankind" (142/ 40), then the uses and abuses of this name, which is not a concept, a term or a figure, properly speaking, are no longer gov- erned by any semantics or, for that matter, metaphorics. Given the inconsistencies of any discourse on or about God (de Deo), whether ontotheological or not, whether coming from God or not, the conclusion seems justified that it no longer suffices to ask: "What is God, if He is?" The question quid est deus? could very well turn out to be the surest means of falling short of the question (if indeed it is a question, if it still hides or still reveals a true question), for God has perhaps become everything (or nothing); perhaps he has become, po- tentially at least, every true question, exigency, or furthest extreme of thought. (114/5-6) For Nancy this circumstance does not mark the beginning of an ethics or pragmatics of the realm of the divine. To construe or recon- struct a 'system' of morality in philosophy or religion, would repre- sent, in the first place, a "forgetting of thought," and, in the second place, a "forgetting of the divine" (138/35). Nor does Nancy choose to take the said aporia of divine attribution as occasion to inaugu- rate an analysis of the primacy of the so-called performative aspects of theological language over and against its constative or predicative features, which can still be found in the particular negativity of the via negativa, in the hyperbolic rhetoric of the via eminentiae, and even in its mysticism, celebration, and prayer. It is only at one iso- lated point in his text that Nancy reminds us that: "Naming or calling the gods perhaps always necessarily resides not in a name, even one equipped with divine epithets, but in whole phrases, with</page><page sequence="6">450 HENT DE VRIES their rhythms and their tones." (146/44). But this observation is not pursued in any further detail and serves only to introduce a list of random literary citations which are each in their own way centered around the meaning of the divine. Instead, Des Lieux divins emphasizes the question of place and space, with a remarkable turn and intensity which seems at once close to Heidegger's thought of the site (of the Ort, the Ersrterung, as well as the Situation of which Sein und Zeit speaks) and moving far beyond the confines of the thinking-of as well as the prerogative of (the one) Being. Writing of divine places, Nancy interrogates the being-one, the being-indivisible, of the place and the determination of whatever place or space as a site of gathering, more in particular of the Versammlung, of Being and beings, of divinities and mortals, heavens (the sky) and earth. Instead of having to ask-ad infinitum -whether or what 'god' is or names, we should be in the position to ask: If there is a place for god, if there is still room (place) for him: that is, a place where he does not become indistinguishable from something else, and where it is consequently still worth calling him by the name of God ... Could we then in fact be dealing with a question of place, of distinct location (lieu) and not with a question of being? (114/6) The very title Des Lieux divins would thus come to stand for a frag- mentary and partial, indeed local and topical, exploration of the gods and their places; of the places they have abandoned and of those where they hide; of gods without hearth or home, of nomadic gods; of the here where the gods are also; of the common places of God; of the gods common to all places, to some places, to no place; of God: in what way he is topos; topics and atopics of the divine; of gods and places; treatise on divine paronomasia; where is God to be found? in what place? (114/6) What takes place in and with these formulations? Where do they come from and where do they go? It is noteworthy that Nancy, for all the subtlety of his rephrasing of a traditional question, retains, if not the question 'what is . . . ?' (quid est), then at least the form of the question and of questioning as such. Here, it is the question 'where, if anywhere?' (or 'is there any place, somewhere, where...?') which is substituted for-and takes the place of-the ontological interrogation 'what is X in its very essence and existence?' It is no less remarkable that Nancy, in this context, refrains from putting into question the principle of identity. The very exclusion of a third</page><page sequence="7">MLN 451 possibility beyond the alternative X or not X (tertium non datur) regulates the basic assumptions on which Des Lieux divins is based. For the notion 'god' to be meaningful and not a mere fiatus vocis, an empty word or sound, it must, Nancy maintains, have some differen- tia specifica, some distinctive feature. Not that the word 'god' would have to have a semantic core (it has not), not that one should have to be able to first answer the question of His existence and essence by proving, for example, that (and how) the substance called divine must of necessity have all perfect properties and can therefore, by 'implication,' be said to exist eminently. But, on Nancy's account, the notion and the word 'god' has to have at least some 'presence' here and now in order to make sense at all. Whatever the radicality of his project, Nancy replaces the traditional question as to whether 'god' exists (an sit) and, if so, what He is in essence (quod sit), by the more topical and timely question where He is, not in fact but in essence (quo sit). And to ask where and when his 'essence' can be said to 'exist' comes down to posing the question "how he withdraws from existence, how he is not where we expect him to be" (133/29). Of course, one might wonder, why, now that the name 'God' can no longer be taken to refer to the highest or the supreme Being, the first cause of all as well as of Himself-causa prima and causa sui-this notion and the very 'presence' that it evokes should be 'indistinguish- able from something else' at all? Why should there be a specific difference where, precisely, the sublime indifference vis-d-vis finite differentiations is at stake? Indeed, one might raise doubts as to whether the 'presence' at or in a certain locus or locution could ever hope to provide the divine with a distinctive feature or a discrimina- tory marker. Would not an always possible confusion and transgres- sion constitute 'God's' or the god's unpredictable occurrence, if and wherever He occurs? Is not every epiphany characterized by a trans- position which in its very transcendere-in its transascendance and transdescendance, to cite Levinas-retains something (of the) unde- cidable, as if it were on both sides of the same line at once, as if this 'line,' which is supposed to set the finite and the infinite apart, were 'itself' infinitely divided? Nancy does not engage these questions here, in Des Lieux divins, they are not his topic. Instead, he recalls the H6lderlinean motif of the lacking of divine names, here and now, at this place, where we are, and opposes it to the at bottom metaphysical preoccupation with the inexpressible, beyond any ontic and, for that matter, ontological determination, epekeina tes ousias, beyond es- sence. In our days, Nancy writes, 'God' is not</page><page sequence="8">452 HENT DE VRIES unnameable in the metaphysical sense of that being that is inaccessible to all names . . ., including the name of being itself, according to an unbroken tradition that is the very tradition of onto-theology. God is not unnameable in that sense, because in that sense unnameability is the result of an overflowing of names and language, whereas the un- nameability of the god to whom I address myself (if I can) results from the lack of a name .... There is no impotence on the part of names in general to express or refer to God (just as, conversely, the unnameable is neither necessarily nor exclusively divine. . .) In fact it could well be that the 'unnameable' is never divine, and that the divine is always named- even if it is for want of a name. (117-118/10)3 This retreat and wanting of the divine name is remarked and com- mented upon by the texts of Holderlin and this Nancy notes, with an intensity and subtlety which is captured only in part by Heidegger's exegeses. Holderlin's words in Heimkehr-"es fehlen heilige Namen," "sacred names are lacking" or "there is a lack of sacred names"- should not so much be read against the background of the tradition of negative theology (in which Nancy includes the names of Pseudo- Dionysius, Eckhart, Levinas and Marion and which, he adds, was always focused on the difficulty of using concepts when speaking of God). Nor could this lack be interpreted in terms of a mere empirical-historical, cultural-absence, as if the names were lack- ing in the sense of their not-being-ready-at-hand or vorhanden. No doubts are cast, in Holderlin, on the possibility of divine names. On the contrary, the assertion of a lack of sacred names implies that we know what such names are-names, as Heidegger's commentary puts it, 'which are commensurate with the sacred (or the holy) and which themselves cast light upon it.' These names are thus not only proper to the divine, they bring it to light, they make it known as the divine that it is. These names are the manifestation of the divine, they are thus perhaps not far from being the divine itself. It is simply . . . that these names, here and now, are lacking (118/11, translation modified). The lack is not tied to a cut, to the being cut off, marked by the so- called caesura or by the circumcision of language which comes with the baptism in a given community. The wanting of names is consti- tuted not by the lack of this or that name, but by the (temporary or 3 "it turns out that all divine names refer, as to a common destiny written down in the distant past of the Western world, to the unpronounceable Name, to the un- vocalizable Tetragram. As if in Judaism it were written that the divine is destined to withdraw its own name, and in so doing to abscond from call and from prayer. And that we would then be left only with this withdrawal of the name of God, in place of all gods, and also in place of the god of Israel" (118/11, translation modified).</page><page sequence="9">MLN 453 perpetual) absence or cessation of the gesture of naming, that is of appellatives, of invocation or 'prayer.' And the dislocation of this allocation is not tied to its mere historical or historial displacement. The lack of names unsettles and uproots the address in a more radical sense still than by simply transporting it into a different context. It de-contextualizes or eradicates the very hic et nunc of saying or praying mon dieu!And this "apparent possessive" is the sole basis of the sublime destitution and abandonment that Nancy sees at the origin-at the roots-of divine topoi, namely the "interpella- tive" signaling nothing other than: "you, here, now, are entering into a singular relationship with me. This does not ensure the rela- tionship, nor in any way provide the measure of it. But it proclaims it, and gives it its chance" (117/10). Now, the lack of divine names implies the end or the suspension of such prayer. No sublimation of negative theology, no negative theology of the sublime, can ever hope to substitute for this "singu- lar address to a singular god." (121/14). No mysticism can come and take the place of this prayer. No mon dieu! can return un- changed, unaffected: "From all the rites and all the liturgies, not the least canticle is left over: even the believer who prays can only quote his prayer" (148/47).4 This view would make it possible to keep oneself at a distance, at least philosophically-more precisely, insofar as the task of 'thought' is concerned-from all those naive and dangerous at- tempts to explore and exploit a purported renaissance, resurrection or reveil of the religious. The death of God seems irrevocable, and gods return only as idols and idle kitsch. And yet, the presupposi- tion on which this confident statement is based-the assumption, namely that for want of prayer there can only be the parody of its re- citation-is vulnerable in turn. Nancy's own words suffice to make that clear. Just as the validity of the concept of the 'idol' as well as that of 'idolatry' is based on the presupposition or postulation of the very Idea of which it is thought to give a distorted-anthropomorphic and profane-image, also the suspicion of mere re-citation makes sense only in view of the ideal of direct and pure address. Conversely, there can be no immediate or genuine address without repetition or 4 "All that remains is a distant quotation (citation) in the memory: schema Isra- el ... Pater noster... Id ildh illa 'lldh. . .. This recitation, like our cultural or cult memory of divine names, merely sustains the reality of a lack of prayer. The recita- tion prays for want of praying." (ibid.)</page><page sequence="10">454 HENT DE VRIES reiteration, and thus without the risk of parody. Nancy seems to acknowledge as much when he writes: Wherever divine service takes place, we cannot be sure that it is not merely the pious and ridiculous repetition of what it once was, or else that it is not confined to being the exercising of a social convention.... Yet after all has it ever been any different? Where and when can we say that true worship takes place? ... We feel that there must be celebration of the glory of the god. And yet we can say nothing about worship. (134/29-30) The 'feeling' that there has to be "celebration" is not due to some sort of subjective "inwardness"; faith is not a psychological category, a mental state induced by some inner or outer, unconscious or conscious 'object.' Faith, Nancy writes: is entirely an outward act of presence [une compuration a l'exteri- eur] ... like clearly turning one's face toward the manifest heavens. (140/37) However, the comparison is hardly an innocent one. It recalls a Holderlinean topos-a topos aistheton rather than a topos noeton- which cannot be easily situated. It is to this place without place that we now turn. II. The Face of the Sky The question "What is god?," which Des Lieux divins starts out to discuss, if only to raise doubts about its topicality, figures also promi- nently as the title and incipit of one of H6lderlin's poetic writings. It is this poem which is taken as the point of departure for an elucida- tion of the premises and the scope of Heidegger's commentaries or, rather, Erliiuterungen to Holderlin. The poem, which is also cited in ". . dichterisch wohnet der Mensch . . ," begins as follows: WAS IST GOTT? Was ist Gott? unbekannt, dennoch Voll Eigenschaften ist das Angesicht Des Himmels von ihm. What is God? Unknown, yet Full of his qualities is the Face of the sky.5 5 M. Heidegger, Poetry, Language, Thought, trans. A. Hofstadter (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1971), 225.</page><page sequence="11">MLN 455 "What is god?," is, Nancy suggests, a question for want of divine names, expressing the lack of prayer. It is the question which H61- derlin poses and answers by pointing at the aspect or the face of the sky, the Angesicht des Himmels. Moreover, it is the question which Heidegger's commentary sets out to elucidate. However, in doing so, Heidegger's reading takes its lead in yet another passage, a pas- sage from In lieblicher Bldue bliihet ... [In lovely blueness . . . blos- soms], a poem whose authenticity has been disputed, but which for Heidegger, in its "substance" (sachlich) and its time, belongs the same "ambience" (Umkreis)6 of the aforementioned poem. Accord- ing to more recent commentators it reveals some of the "unmistak- able traits of H6lderlin's late poetry".7 Ist unbekannt Gott? Ist er offenbar wie der Himmel? Dieses Glaub' ich eher. Des Menschen Maass ist's. Voll Verdienst, doch dichterisch, wohnet der Mensch auf dieser Erde. Doch reiner ist nicht der Schatten der Nacht mit den Sternen, wenn ich so sagen k6nnte, als der Mensch, der heisset ein Bild der Gottheit. Giebt es auf Erden ein Maass? Es giebt keines. [Is God unknown? Is he manifest like the sky? This rather I believe. It is the measure of man. Full of acquirements, but poetically, man dwells on this earth. But the darkness of night with all the stars is not purer, if I could put it like that, than man, who is called the image of God. Is there a measure on earth? There is none.] Now, when Heidegger interprets the first lines of this passage as saying that the divine, while retaining its invisibility and un- knowability, is made manifest (offenbar) by the heavens, sending, dispatching or destining itself in the appearing of the world, which nevertheless remains foreign to it, he is in danger of reducing the modality of this 'revelation' to that of a logic of absence and pres- ence, revealment and concealment. The manifestation of the divine is still thought here, Nancy suspects, in terms of an Hegelian alter- native, that is to say as the manifestation of a god who does or who does not wish to be "close to us" (123/16).8 6 M. Heidegger, "... dichterisch wohnet der Mensch . . .", Vortrdge und Aufsdtze (Pfullingen: Neske, 1985), 181-198, 193. 7 Chr. Fynsk, Heidegger: Thought and Historicity (Ithaca and London: Cornell Uni- versity Press, 1986), 220, n.31. 8 "Can we still be content to go on conceiving of God, with or against Hegel, with or against St. Augustine, as a form of extreme intimacy? Will a day not come when we shall have to confront a god outside, exposed in the open sky, nowhere hidden and internal to nothing?" (123/16)</page><page sequence="12">456 HENT DE VRIES It is for this reason that Nancy proposes another, more provoca- tive, reading of these very same lines. The poem, he claims, does not so much maintain that God is revealed "by means of the heavens," rather it suggests that "the god" 'is' only "as manifest as the heav- ens": "The face of God is as manifest as the Angesicht of the heavens" (123/17). The heavens are not the mere appearance, reflection, mirror-image or projection screen for a god whose existence (or presence) and essence ought to be located elsewhere, beyond this surface: The invisible divine lets itself be seen resting, itself, upon the face [here: the Angesicht des Himmels], or woven into it, sent or destined therein, but as another face that lets itself be seen here, without 'here' serving as a mediation for it. (124/17) For lack of a better word, Nancy speaks here of the "im-mediacy" of the divine, the "im-" implying neither a negation nor a privation nor, for that matter, a mere indifference, but, rather, a 'relation' or a 'state' which has absolved itself from that of both mediacy and im- mediacy, and concerns man alone. The "im-mediate" gives a hint man can follow up on, or not. What the heavens and the god have "in common," is neither a common measure nor an analogia entis, but "the sovereign interplay [jeu] of darkness and radiance [Veclat], of radiance withdrawn into darkness and of darkness as manifest as radiance" (126/19). From this Nancy draws what seems a dazzling conclusion. For, seen in this light, against the background of the said 'radiance,' revelation can be neither thought as a "presenta- tion" nor as a "representation" (the conveying of some message), but merely as "the evidence of the possibility (never the necessity) of a being-unto-god" (124/17). The 'radiance' reveals nothing but a 'possible.' What there is revelation of is not 'God,' as if he were something that can be exhibited . . ., it is rather the unto-God [l'd-dieu] or being-unto-god. Or more exactly, it becomes manifest that such a being-unto-god is possi- ble. (124/17-18) If this analysis brings out the extent to which Heidegger 'ontolo- gizes' H6lderlin's Gedicht-by his suggestion that the divine is made manifest by the heavens, by his interpretation of the presence- absence of the gods in terms of Being's manifestation and conceal- ment, and by his taking the Holderlinian "time of need" as the time in which the gods have fled while the god is still to come, thus</page><page sequence="13">MLN 457 "extracting" a future "positive" out of a past and present "privative"9 -then it is not itself without problems. For the very postulation and quasi-phenomenological description of any such 'possible,' more in particular of the "evidence of the possibility ... of a being-unto-god," seems to rely, in turn, on an ontological or onto-theological topos, if not commonplace. So much so that we should now have to pose the question as to whether the analysis has gained any 'new ground' at all. For does not the mere introduction of the possible, more pre- cisely of the possibility of a possibility, and with it of the language of transcendental philosophy, remain indebted to the ideal of an architectonics-and thereby a spatial and figural hierarchy-of thought? In De dieu qui vient a l'idde Levinas says as much when he suggests that the transcendental method of searching the "founda- tion" and of justifying an idea by finding the "conditions" of its possi- bility, is itself based upon the presupposition of an "immobile" world, a world at rest, a world which supports, as an habitat as much as an "astronomical world of perception," in short, a world in which one encounters nothing but the Same (le Meme).10 Seen from this perspective, even the quasi-transcendental-the transcendental not used and mentioned or intended as such, but quasiment, or other- wise still-could run the risk of not being able to escape this predic- ament of following an architectural (rather than, say, an archi- textual) design. For the very formulation quasiment, for all its fictionality or fabulosity, would already imprint the seal of some generality into the very singularity which is at stake here, that is to say into this 'one' yet divisible 'singular' or 'single' place or passage from which the other as Other (l'Autre, I'd-dieu) comes. Whatever precautions one would want to take here, speaking of the 'quasi-' (directly or indirectly, quasiment or otherwise still) would already run the risk of turning this one-singular, and more or less than one-topos into a place already too common, a place which gathers or collects, the Ort of a Versammlung, the simplicity of the onefold (the Einfalt) in the very heart of the Fourfold (the Geviert) of heav- ens and earth, divinities and mortals.

No multiplication or proliferation of places, whether divine, common, empty, or not, could protect against their being read as more of the same (or, rather, the Same). Indeed, as Derrida reminds us: When Heidegger defines place, Ort, he recalls that in its High or Old German idiom, Ort refers to the point of a spear, there where all the forces are joined and gathered in the end; and when he says that ques- tioning is the piety of thinking, he recalls thatfromm, Frdmmigkeit, comes from promos: what comes first, leads, or directs the front line [I'avant- garde] in a 'battle,' in other words, that which comes at the first place.11 It is here, then, that the question of place and the quest for the meaning of Being-that is to say, of the horizon or dimension of Being as well as of the chiasmic crossing of the Fourfold, the Geviert-would seem to touch upon each other. For if, in Zur Seinsfrage, Heidegger comes to the conclusion that the word Sein, in order not to be misunderstood in terms of an object before a sub- ject, ought to be submitted to the erasure of a crossing-out (a kreuz- weise Durchstreichung), then this cross does not entail a privation or a "negative sign" (Zeichen). Rather, it points towards the four Gegenden of the Geviert, the Fourfold, and their being collected together in the place (Ort) of the crossing.12 The place, Derrida concludes, is for Heidegger a place of "collecting together (Versammlung).13 And, it is precisely against this background that Zur Seinsfrage will propose to graft the possibility of a topography of nihilism on a more origi- nary topology of Being.14 Now, where does Nancy's theo-topography differ and depart from the topology of Being as it can be found in Heidegger's later work? Could the horizons and dimensions of possibility that situate the Erorterung of thought also give a proper place to 'God,' 'the god' or the gods? And could the same be said of the crossing point of the Fourfold? Is Being itself, as such, the topos, the manifest space, the ll J. Derrida, The Other Heading, trans. by P. A. Brault and M.

Is Being the opening which "gives place" (donne lieu) and "access" to God (d Dieu), like the "outer sanctuary," the parvis or the vorbiirge, of which Meister Eckhart remarks that it forms the residence of God and "gives place without being either essence or foundation"?15 Should one not, conversely, insist on the 'possibility,' if that is still the right word, that it is not so much the manifestation of Being or, for that matter, the sacred (das Heilige) but the singular notion and experience of 'God'-that is to say, of this or that, present-absent, future and immemorial 'god,' and whatever takes its place or name-which opens up all space, orients all spacing and thus ex- ceeds the horizon of Being? Does not the doctrine of the creatio ex nihilo or, for that matter, the creatio continua name precisely this beyond and otherwise than being which is neither a space nor place, a foundation nor ground, but, rather, that which situates and spaces, traces space and even stages space traces?16 It is against this background that Levinas can write that the work of Derrida, in marking a second Copernican turning, that is in deconstructing the origin-after and beyond Kant and Heidegger-can help us to re- think the very notion of creation. III. Boga nyet: No God Up Here Following Nancy, we ought to conclude that Heidegger ascribes to the manifest sky what Levinas accuses him of attributing to the place (le Lieu), to the world, to the earth. It is worthwhile, therefore, to briefly pause here for an excursion into what, according to Levinas and Heidegger, uproots the enrootedness (enracinement, Verwurze- lung) of man in the place, namely the quest and the question of modern technology. According to Levinas, Being, whatever its manifestation by the heavens, presents itself as an anonymous luminosity, which is with- 15J. Derrida, Psyche, Inventions de l'autre (Paris: Galilee, 1987), 591-592. Similar examples of places, common places, topoi and tropes can be found in the works of Pseudo-Dionysius who writes that "God resides in a place" without being this place. "To gain access to this place is not yet to contemplate God" and Derrida cites the Mystical Theology where it is said of Moses that he "does not see God-for God is unseen-but the place [toppon] where God is." 16 With respect to the notion of God as creator, Nancy remarks: "God is not he who makes beings be. Nothing and no one "makes" beings "be": they are not pro- duced and production exists only within the world of beings" (131/27).</page><page sequence="16">460 HENT DE VRIES out a face (and a face, in turn, as the very primum intelligibele, is not, does not belong to the order of the existing). There is no Being with a human face, for Being orients and disorients the human existence in "building and cultivating, in the midst of a familiar landscape, on a maternal earth. Anonymous, neuter, it directs it ... foreign to all guilt with regard to the other."17 It is precisely this ethical indif- ference, combined with an unforgivable naivete with respect to the "pretechnological power of possession effected in the enrootedness of perception"18 as well as with an equally fatal blindness vis-a-vis the chances or even hopes of technological innovations, which provokes Levinas' well-known desire to leave the "climate" of the Heideg- gerean province. Not in order to go elsewhere and to simply change places; not in order to inaugurate and to practice a purportedly nomadic thought (nomadism also presupposes the horizon of a climate and a landscape; whatever its peregrinations, it still confines itself to the space under the sky and continues to situate itself with respect to the earth). The thought of the other is inspired, moti- vated and 'moved' by a wholly other topology and topolitology, which to a certain extent finds in technology its ally. More precisely, the thought of the other can be said to follow the trace of an u-topia, a non-place or no-place, irreducible to any thought of Being, wheth- er of its immanence, its transcendence or its 'radiance' or fluores- cence. The thought of the other re-traces the steps, if one can still say so, of an otherwise than Being, an out-of-the-order-of-things, themes, tropes and common places, in other words: an out of place, hors sujet. Instead of evoking a peasant-like existence rooted in the place, a flourishing like plants, the relation to the Other would turn the subject itself into an improbable 'place' where the weight of being is supported, weighed and found wanting. When Heidegger calls attention to the forgetting of Being, veiled by the diverse realities it illuminates . .. when he deplores the orientation of the intellect toward technology, he maintains a regime of power more inhuman than mechanism; [more inhuman, Levinas continues, since] it is not sure that National Socialism arises from ... mechanist reification of men, and that it does not rest on peasant enrootedness ... an exis- tence which takes itself to be natural, for whom its place in the sun, its ground, its site, orient all signification-a pagan existing.19 17 E.

For instead of obstructing the awareness of the modern coin- age of metaphysics and the responsibility it imposes, the space opened by technology (space-technology) provides the means to face others in the first place. This injunction of the technological age is double: communication technology, the use of satellites, brings others who seemed at a distance into a disturbing proximity. It prepares the ground for a responsibility which is no longer to the tribe, the family, the people, the state, the neighbor, but acts "with- out entering into the Promised Land."21 Second, it is only by affirm- ing the potential of the technological world that we are able to respond to their call with more than words or gestures alone. Le- vinas describes this situation as follows: "This is the great paradox of human existence; we must use the ontological for the sake of the other, to ensure the survival of others, we must resort to the techno- political systems of means and ends."22 Technology thus mediates the other for the sake of the other; it represents the medium for the other's immediacy and the means for immediate help. Moreover, when Gagarin left his supposedly natural place on earth, he demonstrated that, at least for an hour, man could exist "outside of every horizon," in mere "geometrical space,"23 and thus signal a meaning without context, without determinable place of origination, regardless of the measures of all earthly coordinates. Gagarin thus hinted at a non-place, which offers no room for sedimentation and makes the self weightless. One of the epigraphs placed at the opening of Autrement qu 'etre ou au-deld de l'essence is taken from Pascal's Pensees and makes very clear what is at stake in the claim to possess or oversee a certain space: the demarcation of mine and thine and thereby the unleashing of impe- 20 E.

There is the beginning and image of the usurpation of the whole earth."24 Instead of grounding itself in the earth, in whatever place, the self, in Levinas' account, would have to be thought of as the point-less than a point in space-on which the world rests. The self is not implanted in the world, not of this world, the self neither is nor is not and thus otherwise than being and nothingness. The self carries the weight of the earth and of being and nothingness on its shoulders.25 Gagarin's voyage and the technology that made it possible and that is made possible by it, would find an ally in the Jewish religion, which in its supposed "abstract universalism" and in contrast with Christianity, radically "demystifies the universe" and demands the destruction rather than the "sublimation" of the tribal, local or national idols.26 And yet, in insisting on the distance between the thought of the Other and the journey of Ulysses, in contrasting the latter with Gagarin's odyssey in space (his 'space odyssey'), Levinas leaves no doubt that also the realm of the stars has its place within the sphere-in the hemisphere-of the same;27 "the space of the universe manifests itself as the home [demeure] of the others;" it is only insofar as others regard me and are facing me that the "pre- geometrical essence of space" can be described.28 Gagarin's posi- tion in space, then, reveals not so much a condition of possibility of the relation to others, nor this relation itself, but serves as a figure for- and, for that matter, a 'sign' of-their manifestation. One, more- over, which does not let itself be captured by the situating (Eror- terung) of thought in its place (Ort).

Here, it is read as an evocation of the incondition humaine. Rimbaud's words, however-"La vraie vie est absente. Nous ne sommes pas au monde"30-are interrupted. Only the first sentence is cited and the second subjected to an alteration that makes all the difference of the world. The true life is elsewhere, Levinas reiterates, but we are in the world. This ambiguity marks our situation, our metaphysical desire and our hypocrisy of being at- tached at once to philosophers and prophets. IV. Ein Fremdes auf Erden In different contexts, Levinas argues that for Heidegger to think in the closure of metaphysics comes down to responding to an anony- mous call which addresses itself first of all to poets and thinkers and only lets itself be heard if man 'dwells poetically.' It is here that the silence and the peace of an originary language can resound. But there is more: This simplicity and wonder are also the endurance and extreme atten- tion of the poet and the artist; it is, in the proper meaning of the term, to keep [garder] silence. The poem or the work keep silence, let being's essence be, as the shepherd keeps his flock. Being requires man as a native land or a ground requires its autochtons. The foreignness of man in the world, his stateless condition, is taken to attest to the last spasms of metaphysics and the humanism it sustains.31 Levinas' interpretation seems to be confirmed by a passage in Unter- wegs zur Sprache, which is analyzed by Derrida in De l'esprit. For when Heidegger quotes a verse from Trakl's poem "Frfihling der Seele" [Springtime of the Soul]: "Es ist die Seele ein Fremdes auf Erden" [The soul is something strange upon earth], this citation, Derrida explains, hardly amounts to a celebration of a nomadic existence or an erring of thought. On the contrary, in radically distancing him- self from the Platonic-Christian, onto-theological and ecclesiastical interpretation of the spiritual which implies a figural opposition of "the below and the beyond, of the low and the high, of the sensible 29 Levinas, Autrement qu'etre ou au-deld de l'essence, 151. 30 Une saison en enfer, Delires I, Vierge folle, l'epoux infernal. 31 Levinas, Collected Papers, 144 (translation modified): Humanisme de l'autre homme, 90.</page><page sequence="20">464 HENT DE VRIES and the intelligible,"32 and has become reified as the rational, the intellectual, the ideological; moreover, in relying on the Old Ger- man meaning of fram as being on the way towards another, more original and future, destination-a being unterwegs nach rather than a mere wandering-Heidegger would suggest that in Trakl's Gedicht another understanding of the spiritual (geistliche) determination of the soul is underway. In this view, the soul would be "far from being exiled on the earth like a fallen stranger," but, on the contrary, in search of, "on the way towards the earth." Heidegger writes: "Die Seele sucht die Erde erst, flieht sie nicht."33 [The soul only seeks the earth, it does not flee it]. On this reading, the soul is hardly that of an autochton, certain of his place under the sun, settled and compla- cent in some sedentary form of existence. Rather, the soul is por- trayed here as a stranger which does not yet (or should we also say: no longer?) inhabit the earth. "fremd", althochdeutsch "fram", bedeutet eigentlich: anderswohin vor- warts, unterwegs nach .. ., dem Voraufbehaltenen entgegen. Das Fremde wandert voraus. Doch es irrt nicht, bar jeder Bestimmung ratios umher. Das Fremde geht suchend auf den Ort zu, wo es als ein Wanderndes bleiben kann. "Fremdes" folgt schon, ihm selber kaum enthillt, dem Ruf auf den Weg in sein Eigenes. Der Dichter nennt die Seele "ein Fremdes aufErden". Wohin ihr Wandern bisher noch nicht gelangen konnte, ist gerade die Erde. Die Seele sucht die Erde erst, flieht sie nicht. Wandernd die Erde zu suchen, dass sie auf ihr dichterisch bauen und wohnen und so erst die Erde als die Erde retten konne, erfillt das Wesen der Seele. So ist denn die Seele keineswegs zunachst Seele und dazu noch aus irgendwelchen Grfinden nicht auf die Erde geh6rig.34 And yet, Trakl's Gedicht remains in its very formulation highly para- doxical. It circumscribes the place as one of separation, more in particular as separateness (Abgeschiedenheit).35 To the extent that it 32 Derrida, Of Spirit, 33. 33 Heidegger, Unterwegs zur Sprache, 41, Cf. Of Spirit, 87: "That the soul is a 'strang- er' does not signify that one must take it to be imprisoned, exiled, tumbled into the terrestrial below, fallen into a body doomed to the corruption (Verwesen) of what is lacking in Being and in truth is not." 34 Heidegger, Unterwegs zur Sprache, 41. 35 Heidegger writes: "Die bisher genannten Strophen und Verse weisen uns in eine Versammlung, d.h. [sic] an einen Ort. Welcher Art is dieser Ort? Wie sollen wir ihn benennen? Doch wohl aus der Anmessung an die Sprache des Dichters." Heidegger, Unterwegs zur Sprache, 52.</page><page sequence="21">MLN 465 gathers itself around and in the figure of the stranger, the one who is separated, its own place is that of separateness: Alles Sagen der Dichtungen Trakls bleibt auf den wandernden Fremd- ling versammelt. Er ist und heisst 'der Abgeschiedene'. Durch ihn hin- durch und um ihn her ist das dichtende Sagen auf einen einzigen Ge- sang gestimmt. Weil die Dichtungen dieses Dichters in das Lied des Abgeschiedenen versammelt sind, nennen wir den Ort seines Gedichts die Abgeschiedenheit.36 Along these same lines, one could be tempted to demonstrate that Heidegger's texts on the question of technology, in the turn (Kehre) as well as the releasement, the letting-go or Gelassenheit this turning evokes and demands, are also far more complex than Le- vinas's violent reading suggests. For the domination of the instru- mentalist worldview is said not only to dissolve man's enrootedness in the earth. Paradoxically, modern technology also calls forth a releasement with respect to things (Gelassenheit zu den Dingen), an openness for the secret (Offenheit fur das Geheimnis), which presup- poses and entails a thinking-of 'space,' more precisely of the 'ether' (Ather), of the wide open heavens, and of spirit.37 The nearness or proximity to things finds its proper place only in the movement that elevates thought. And in this 'lift off' it distances itself from the world of all representational and, for that matter, transcendental thinking. In this letting-go, which is neither active nor passive, a Nicht-Wollen that is no longer a modification of the will but a waiting without specific horizon of expectation and thereby pure openness,38 the thinking-of (the Andenken) is placed in front of the unsayable.39 The danger (Gefahr) to which it thus responds, is itself no longer localizable. This danger is everywhere and nowhere and does not have a place (Ort). Danger marks the epoch of Being as that of technology, of the Gestell; it is "the placeless place" (die ortlose Ortschaft)40 of its presencing. As such, it makes places for a yes and no to technology, for its utilization, be it not for its own sake.41 It does not help, then, to insist too much on the different orienta- tion and tonality of, say, Gelassenheit and "Heidegger, Gagarin et 36 Ibid. 37 M.

Not only does it not suffice to decry the "climate" of the thought of an other where, as Levinas himself emphasizes, the other behind and beyond any spheric horizons or 'climates' is at stake. For even the very need to leave the 'climate' of Heidegger's thought, proclaimed with so much fervor by the preface and the title De l'existence i l'existant, cannot be thought as something which would be "totally exterior"42 to this thought itself. When Heidegger calls Being itself "eschatological,"43 when he recalls time and again that the manifestation and concealment of Being in the existents and in the epochs of world history is an 'erring,' an lrren,44 then, Derrida notes, this affirmation complicates an all too immediate identification of the thought of the place with some geo- or, for that matter ethnocentric violence: erring and the epochal essence of Being are irreducible. Henceforth, how can one accuse this thought of interminable wandering of being a new paganism of the Site, a complacent cult of the Sedentary? Here, the solicitation of the Site and the Land is in no way, it must be emphasized, a passionate attachment to territory or locality, is in no way a provincial- ism or particularism. It is, at very least, as little linked to empirical 'na- tionalism' as is, or should be, the Hebraic nostalgia for the Land, a nostalgia provoked not by an empirical passion, but by the irruption of a speech or a promise.... The Site, therefore, is not an empirical Here but always an Illic: for Heidegger, as for the Jew and the Poet. The proximity of the Site is always held in reserve, says H6lderlin as com- mented by Heidegger.45 And if Sein und Zeit had already insisted on the ontological pri- macy of the Unheimlichkeit and the "nudity"46 of the Un-zuhause of the existence over and against the commonality of the Man, then the later work, notably the readings of Holderlin and Trakl, further amplifies this essential feature of our being-in-the-world without being of it, that is, without belonging to it as a part belongs to a whole. For the very same reasons, the meaning and the essence of 'dwelling poetically' would not let itself be reduced to mere patrio- tism or chauvinism even if it cannot be without some grounding in 42 Derrida, "Violence and Metaphysics," Writing and Difference, trans.

In the context of a discussion of divine places, it is worthwhile to look at this relation more closely. Derrida describes it in the following terms: The Sacred of which it [the thought of Being] speaks belongs neither to religion in general, nor to a particular theology, and thus cannot be determined by any history of religion . ., in a sense which is neither chronological nor logical, nor ontical in general, it precedes every relation- ship to God or to the Gods. This last relationship, of whatever type, in order to be lived and stated supposes some precomprehension of the Deity, of God's Being-God, of the "dimension of the divine" of which Levinas also speaks by saying that it "is opened on the basis of the human face." This is all, and as usual it is simple and difficult. The sacred is the only essential space of divinity which in turn opens only a dimension for the gods and the god. .. This space (in which Heidegger also names Elevation ... is within faith and atheism. Both presuppose it.48 Indeed, the relation between the thought of Being and religion- the revelation or the coming of the god(s)-is more convoluted still. That the gods or God cannot be indicated except in the Space of the Sacred and in the light of the deity, is at once the limit and the wellspring of finite-Being as history. Limit, because divinity is not God. In a sense it is nothing.... Wellspring, because this anticipation as a thought of Be- ing ... always sees God coming, opens the possibility (the eventuality) of an encounter with God and of a dialogue with God.49 We will return to this ambiguity when we raise the question as to whether the thought of Being does not prejudge the possible com- ing of gods by associating the lack of divine names with a withhold- ing or keeping itself in reserve (see VI below). For now, it suffices to note that, despite the apparent differences between a thinking which, as a lamentation for human victims, ex- iles itself from Being, and an erring thought of the site that takes the form of a hymn of a promised nearness to the earth, some striking 47 Derrida recalls that "concerning H6lderlin's poem Return [Homecoming, Heimkunft], Heidegger notes that in his commentary the word 'country' is "thought in an essential sense, not at all a patriotic sense, nor a nationalist sense, but rather, from the point of view of the History of Being" (ibid., 319 n. 80). 48 Ibid., 145. The reference is to the Brief iiber den Humanismus and to the Eriiuterungen zu Holderlins Dichtung, 14. 49 Ibid., 146.</page><page sequence="24">468 HENT DE VRIES similarities remain in place. While moving in seemingly opposite directions, both Heidegger and Levinas rely on conceptual opposi- tions and a figural language of height or elevation and nearness which are reinscribed in a 'space' which precedes and exceeds all ontic and, for that matter, spatial determination, that is to say 'in' 'what' no longer simply obeys the common concepts of space and place, of heavens and earth, of down here and up there, of proximity and distance.50 If it gives itself to be thought at all, if it signals itself through and in the concepts and figures of what it surpasses and calls forth, it presents itself as the giving of whatever given. V. The Utopography of the Gift In his thought of the atopics, utopics or utopography of the gift, Derrida could be said to prepare such a thinking of 'space.' If there is (has been) a gift, if the gift has taken place, then it will not have occupied a space. If there is (or has been) one, then it will have (had) no there that could be pointed or even hinted at deictically, dialectically, phenomenologically or even rhetorically: II y a ld cendre. And with respect to the attempt to answer the question "what (or where) is the li (there) here?," the least that should be said would be that the ld of I y a ld cendre no less dis-places the Dies of the Hegelian Phdnomenologie des Geistes than it re-places and re-situates the insistence on the Da of Dasein in Sein und Zeit. The there, the ld of II y a ld cendre, would thus be transported into a realm without proper location, "residency" or "domicile," where neither the dia- lectical sublation of the empirical nor the different modalities of the possible, grounded, for example, in the existential structures of the being-there, can be of help in determining whether and where a next step-a pas d criture-may come.51 If the Da of Dasein, in Sein und Zeit, recalls the irreplaceable singular structure of Jemeinigkeit before or beyond any "organic or atomic indivisibility" of human subjectivity, that is to say before or beyond any definition of the being that we are in terms of an animal rationale, ego, self, person or 50J.

It traverses and unsettles the Jemeinigkeit with- out therefore becoming the latter's presupposition. The ld escapes the condition of all possibility, of the transcendental as much as of its functional equivalents (the quasi, quasiment, etc.). In the same vein Derrida writes that the "singular spacing" which can be ascribed to the call, the Ruf of the voice of the friend-and the same could be said mutatis mutandis of the voice of conscience, the Stimme des Gewissens, in Sein und Zeit-consists in its being "neither near nor far away," "neither inside nor outside," "neither in the ear nor far from the ear."53 At different places Heidegger's text would allude to a topos, more precisely to the "opening of the Da, of Da- sein," and thus to a "topology of Da-sein,"54 which can only be de- scribed as a non-topos and gives rise only to an atopics. In De l'esprit, Of Spirit, Derrida proposes to read this atopics in conjunction with the thought of the call of language of which Unter- wegs zur Sprache speaks. Retrospectively, Derrida writes, this Ruf, Zuspruch or Zusage, "instead of disqualifying or recommencing every- thing," must guide thought to "another strategy and another strati- graphy," other "strata" which "restructure a space."55 And this, Der- rida continues, "is useful not only for reading Heidegger and serving some hermeneutical or philological piety. Beyond an always necessary exegesis, this re-reading sketches out another topography for new tasks, for what remains to be situated of Heidegger's thought and other places of thought-or of the en-gage-places which one pic- tures as regions but which are not (ethics or politics .. .)."56 The question of place, more precisely the beyond of the question which calls forth and demands 'another topography,' would already mark all the folds or 'strata' allowing for another 'stratigraphy.' The latter would no longer presuppose or entail the common distinction be- tween, on the one hand, the ontological (i.e. the explication of the 52 "'Eating Well,' or the Calculation of the Subject: An Interview with Jacques Derrida," E.

Instead it would signal or hint at an atopics of 'that which is' as near as it 'is' distant, here and nowhere, simultaneously, always already, whenever, wherever, 'it' 'is.' It is tempting to read Derrida's "Comment ne parler? Denegations" together with his more recent Chora and Saufle nom as an exploration of this atopics. At least two of these texts are centered around "the question of place."57 Not only is this "privilege" of the place, of the "experience" of the place, tied to the "immense problem of figurative spatialization (both in speech or writing in the current sense and in the space between the current sense and the other, of which the cur- rent sense is only a figure);" not only does place stand for "figuration" and rhetorical topoi.58 First and foremost these texts reflect upon the fact that the apophatic discourse-even if it says nothing determin- able and "deprives itself" of a referent-"takes place:" "that which committed or rendered it possible has taken place" or could well be a "taking-place" which is "still to come."59 And this "trace of the other," which is presupposed and preserved by even the most negative or nihilistic of all discourses, can only be given the name of 'God' ("This is what God's name always names, before or beyond other names: the trace of the singular event that will have rendered speech possible," the "deja-la" expressed in Il y a Id cendre.60 It comes as no surprise, then, when Derrida maintains that in his reading of the different paradigms of negative theology and its "phan- toms" from Pseudo-Dionysius through Eckhart and Heidegger, "a certain void, the place of an internal desert" allows yet another tradi- tion to be discerned: all these analyses, Derrida writes, "surround a resonant space of which nothing, almost nothing, will ever be said,"61 namely the non-Greek and the non-Christian, the Jewish and the Islamic. Here as well as elsewhere, the exposition is exposed to what- ever it is that precedes and exceeds it and has already taken place and has always already been given. Again, if the Jerusalem address, "Com- ment ne pas parler?," meditates on the significance of this place as the context of a reconsideration of the negative, apophatic way, it not 57J.

The logic of the without, of the sans, does not only present the coming before of the trace or the call in function of a temporal indica- tor, but interprets this before in terms of a spacial figuration.62 This logics can be read as the exploration-an utopics or utopography-of a given space, of the gift or the giving of space, of the space and the spacing of the gift. VI. Winke Unlike Derrida, Nancy continues to insist on a certain ontological priority of Being over the gods and their places. Since Being is itself not confined to any particular place or time nor to space in general, since it has no 'here or there' that would be localizable on the map of historical representation, it distances itself from whatever god(s) might come or not come. Being is neither this nor that being, nor for that matter the highest Being. Being 'is' nothing but the fact that beings, whether gods or mortals, are. In its epochs and dis- patches it comes and gives 'itself' otherwise than beings. One should try, then, to "have done once and for all with a constantly recurring error," to wit: the common place of all onto-theology; the identification of being, more in particular of the highest being, with God or the god: being is not God, in any way. Being is the being of beings, what is. Or rather-for it is not part of a being-what it is about a being is the fact that that being is. Consequently, being itself, in return, is not. The god, on the contrary, is... and in that respect he is one being among all other beings .... God is not the supreme being .... God is the being we are not, which is not at our disposal, either, but which appears or disap- pears before the face of the existing, mortal beings, we are" (131/26-27). "the gods necessarily have places, just like a person, a star, or a bird. Being has no place: it is (it 'makes') the disposition, the spacing out of beings according to their places (that is to say according to their times) but it has itself neither place nor time. It is not.... The gods have a history and a geography; they can move off, withdraw, spring up, or decline: they can come, here or there, now or later. (132/28) 62 And Derrida leaves no doubt that "the figures or places of rhetoric are also political strategems"; whenever apophatic texts are structured around some secret, something secret, something of the secret, which ought to be protected against its diffusion or betrayal, "the allegorical shield becomes a political shield, the solid barrier of a social division; or, if you prefer, a shibboleth" (ibid., 93).</page><page sequence="28">472 HENT DE VRIES How does one suppress the suspicion that Being could be just one more topos or common place, marked by an unmistakable here and now, taking place and coined in such and such a manner: an uncan- ny sending-an envoi as much as a Schicksal-coming from Greek- German soil? What if Sein or Seyn, like death (der Tod) in Paul Celan's Todesfuge, would prove to be, not the most universal and most individual concept, but, indeed, ein Meister aus Deutschland? And could not the same thing be suspected of the cross-shaped crossing-out (the kreuzweise Durchstreichung) of Being, of the to- pological figure of Being as being a Fourfold? The crossing-out or crucifiction of the word Being or, for that matter, of Nothing, spaces the Fourfold, the Geviert or the Gegend of Being, and makes it read- able. Nothing more traditional and onto-theological than this crypt- ing of Being in a "spatialized typography"63 decipherable by poetic saying only. It is only when he reinscribes Heidegger's problematic formula- tion into the Holderlinean topos of the Winke of the divine, that Nancy seems to efface the last remnants of the onto-theological legacy that can be discerned in the very restriction of thought to the openness for a possible being-unto-God. Reading Heidegger against Heidegger, without referring to other, perhaps more topical, dis- courses available at this point (the ones developed by Levinas, Der- rida, Marion), Nancy proposes that a better name for the peculiar modality of the 'presence' of 'God,' 'the god,' and 'the gods," as they are revealed and manifest like the heavens, is that of the Wink, the divine 'nod' or 'sign.' The divine does not signal something, it signifies nothing in particular, nothing of that which exists, nothing of the phenomenal, not even the radiance of the heavens them- selves. But if the divine "glory" is said to be "open, offered, dazzling like that of the heavens and effaced like them" (125/19), then this appears to mean, if anything (since the order of meaning and ap- pearance is precisely what is displaced or erased here), that it has the 'nature,' the 'mode' or the 'quality' of a Wink. The god, Nancy writes, is only im Vorbeigang, "passing," "in passing" (115/7), de pas- sage, and, to the extent that all departure entails some sort of death (partir c'est . ..), always already passed away. . . . und Winke sind Von Alters her die Sprache der Gitter64 63 Ibid., 125. 64 Heidegger, Eriduterungen zu H'lderlins Dichtung, 46.</page><page sequence="29">MLN 473 At the risk of filling an abyss, Nancy emphasizes the double reading that these words allow. Holderlin's verse would not so much imply that the realm of the profane has in and of itself the ability to make a gesture toward the sacred. There is no analogical continuity or dialectical sublation that helps to surmount the abyss between ap- pearance and essence, the many and the One, the mortal and the divine, but, Nancy immediately adds: "to 'give a sign' is perhaps always-divine" (115/7). To be sure, the relation between the different modes of giving a sign while signifying nothing in particular, between the Wink, that is, which is a divine gesturing and the gesturing being a Wink, is hardly symmetrical even though there is a secret correspondence here. Not every, for example our, giving of signs, calling, seducing, etc., can pretend to present us with the divine. Strictly speaking, only the poets can be said to function as the heralds-and, perhaps, the Winke-of the divine Winke. But, once again, this privilege can- not be attributed to the semantic or metaphorical potential of poet- ic speech, just as, conversely, the lack of divine proper names cannot be ascribed to the purported "metaphysical surfeit of the thing over the sign, of the real over language" (119/12). On the contrary, if the lack of names is the absence of a Wink which 'is' or evokes a gesture of naming, then the want for a name has nothing to do with some "signifying capacity" (ibid.) or the lack thereof. And, as a consequence, the lack of names "cannot be judged in relation to sense." Paradoxically, it is precisely this circumstance which makes that all names can address-or name-the gods. How, then, can the poem-the writing, reading or re-citation of the poem as well as the simple aisthesis of the heavens of which it speaks-signal the turning of a possible being-unto-the-god, with- out at the same time returning this relation to the order of significa- tion and of aesthetic representation? Where does the Wink touch upon art, if anywhere? Nancy's demarcation between the two modes of manifestation seems to leave no room for confusion. Apodictically, Des Lieux divins upholds a clear cut distinction between the presence without (re)presentation of the divine, on the one hand, and the presenta- tion of/as representation of art, on the other: God . comes in the ruin of all appearing [le paraftre]. Art, on the contrary, infinitely incises the edges of appearance [I'apparaztre], but keeps it intact. (130/25)</page><page sequence="30">474 HENT DE VRIES Two traditions seem to cross their respective paths here. Nancy identifies them as two modes of the sublime, each of which has left its imprint in the texture of Des lieux divins: There is the sublime in art, going from Kant to Benjamin and from there on to us [sic]. It signifies: to feel the fainting away of the sensible, to border on the furthest extreme of presentation .... And there is divine sublimity, that in terms of which Hegel seeks to characterize the Jewish moment in religion .... The coming of God reduces the phenomenon to nothing. Here the sublime is no longer to be found at the furthest extreme of presentation where presentation is transformed into offering. It is in a presence that ruins all presentation and all representation. It is no longer the gesture of offering, it is the imposition of glory. It is no longer the limit of forms and figures, it is the light that disperses the visible. (130/25) It is precisely the difference between two these sublime modes of signifying at the limit and beyond which Nancy tries to retain in the fragmentary-indeed paratactic-form of presentation adopted in Des lieux divins. The two modes are irreconcilable, they cannot be translated into each other and have no common measure. And yet, Nancy writes, each mode 'can offer the other': each of these sublime modes can offer itself to or as the other: Between the 'thing' of sublime art and the sublime 'thing' of the divine, there can be said to be that infinitisemal (and in its turn sublime?) difference that lies between presentation at the limit and naked pres- ence: it follows that each can offer the other, but also that it is impossible to confuse one with the other. (130/25) One could be tempted to argue that the reverse statement must be equally true. Given the 'infinitesimal' difference and distance be- tween the two sublimes, none of them can ever hope to offer the other, strictly speaking. Nevertheless, it is impossible not to take the one for the other. One cannot but keep them apart and confuse them. In both, contradictory, cases, the infinitesimally small but lasting difference (or distance) between the limit(ed) and the limit- less regulates their impossible yet inevitable 'relation.' If the divine gives or offers itself in an 'im-mediacy' or 'sublimity' which destructs the order of the phenomenal, rather than in an infinite 'cutting away at its edges,' then it follows that art does not lead us the way to the gods. Indeed, Nancy writes, "nothing leads to god, neither art, nor nature, nor thought, nor love. The gods come or do not come." (131/26). But this coming or going, this imposi- tion or leavetaking, takes place 'on the face' or the 'surface' of the</page><page sequence="31">MLN 475 sky and the earth, in the space, as the spacing of things, of nature, and, last but not least, art. It is this circumstance which explains the possibility, perhaps the necessity, of a confusion between the 'radi- ance' of the divine Wink, inscribed 'in space,' and the sublimity that marks the edges of this 'medium.' The face of the divine is not a countenance (it is not the other [autrui]). But it is the material, local presence-here or there . . -of the coming, or the non-coming of the god. All presence is that of a body, but the body of the god is a body that comes (or that goes). Its presence is a face; it is that before whose face we are offered, and this is inscribed in space. (146/44) What does it mean for the gods not to come? Could not the lack of the address, prayer or worship, itself, in turn, be taken as a modal- ity or, perhaps, even the most proper manifestation-the Wink-of the divine, of its very being, of its being in retreat as opposed to its being absent, pure and simple? Heidegger seems to claim as much when he writes that "the source of this lack is probably concealed in a reserve (Vorenthalt) of the sacred."65 Of course, the very notion of the withholding of the sacred, a keeping itself in reserve, if only to offer itself in an ever more sublime manner, could easily be mis- taken for a metaphysical doctrine of dialectical potency or, for that matter, latency. Nancy, therefore, chooses to read Heidegger's word differently: The lack of sacred names is not a surface lack concealing and manifesting the depths of a sacred held in reserve. It bars the way to the sacred, the sacred as such no longer comes [advient]. (120/13) In this reading, it would no longer be possible to "ontologize H61- derlin's negative."66 There 'is' no more divine advent, no more ad- venture of the divine.67 This non-advent, Nancy writes in "Hyperion's Joy," does not express a 'tragic vision,' a 'bad infinity,' an 'intermin- able task,' let alone a 'rupture' and 'incompletion:' in the mourning 65 Heidegger, Erlduterungen zu Holderlins Dichtung, 14: cited in Of Divine Places, 120/13. 66 Warminski, Readings in Interpretation, 47. Cf. Nancy: "There is no faith in a vanished god: as he withdrew he took faith with him, for faith had never addressed itself to darkness, but solely to the radiance of the divine. What henceforth puts us face to face with the no-return (sans-retour) of the gods cannot be a faith, nor even- nor especially-a faith in the mystery of this no-return, or this 'no-god' " (140/37). 67 One could still claim, of course that to "keep open, available, undecided, the possibility for man of a 'being-unto-god' is in itself a most resolute gesture of wel- come to the divine." (131/26). But this "undecidedness alone-our own" is not, Nancy hastens to add, an "already unto-the-god" (ibid.). In the end, the manifesta- tion of the divine cannot be thought or felt as a mere 'possible.'</page><page sequence="32">476 HENT DE VRIES of the lack of unity and reconciliation that goes with it (the 'loss of Greece,' nature, the gods), it only "borrows the appearance of nos- talgia."68 And with reference to the fragment of Heraclitus which is cited by Heidegger in order to elucidate the meaning of ethos (namely Aufenthalt, Ort des Wohnens),69 Nancy raises a 'possibility,' which the author of the Brief uber den Humanismus will always be in danger of foreclosing: Einai gar kai entautha theous: "Here too are the gods to be found"; these words of Heraclitus can today be given one further meaning at least ... according to which 'here' can be without place [lieu], nowhere, or from place to place, a 'here' wandering in and out of places. (134/30) This possibility that marks the present age, is, however, not com- pletely new. In a sense, it was always already inscribed in the very heart of all places of worship which have always been sites of "aban- donment" and "destitution" as well.70 According to Nancy, this des- titution which is epitomized by the 'experience' of the temple should be distinguished from yet another 'destitution,' namely an 'abandonment' of the other in a more strict or radical sense. The gods of the sacrificial religions-and every religion, Nancy claims, is sacrificial, a translation of the gesture of offering into an exchange, into an oppressive economy of "terror" and "guilt" (135/31)- ultimately prohibit man's true "sacrifice." The latter is an abandon- ment in the sense of an "oblation," "libation" (136/32), which is interrupted or obstructed by the doctrine and the practices of posi- tive religions insofar as they, as Nancy puts it, "prevent the supreme undecidedness of man" (ibid.). We should learn to distinguish, therefore, between the abandonment of the temples and the rites in which man faces his mortality and does not risk himself any further than this, and a "generosity" and "freedom" which moves beyond 68 Cf. J.-L. Nancy, The Birth to Presence, trans. Brian Holmes &amp; others (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1993), 58-81, 62, cf. 63. 69 Heidegger, "Brief iiber den Humanismus", Wegmarken, 351. 70 "It is always in extreme destitution, in abandonment without shelter or protec- tion, that man appears, waxes, or wanes before the force of the god. Wherever he presents himself or absents himself, God brings about destitution and denuding... Destitution should not be contrasted with the magnificence of worship or with the splendor of hymns. All of these, on the contrary, are apt to reveal the infinite abandonment and fragility of the one who performs the rites. One might even say: destitution before the face of the god is the experience of the temple." (147/46). As Derrida reminds us in Glas and, again, in "Prejuges-devant la loi," Hegel points out that Pompejus, upon entering the inner center of the Jewish temple, found nothing but an empty, open space.</page><page sequence="33">MLN 477 religion and is, perhaps, no longer unto-the-gods, whether unto "another god said to be coming" or unto "no god" (ibid.).71 This 'freedom' does not have to wait for the end of religion in order to show its face-its 'radiance,' its Winke?-nor is it made possible by it. It has always already "forged a path" (ibid.) through the myths, the doctrines and, more importantly, the rites and prayers of histori- cal religions and thus lets itself be retraced, by theotopographies or otherwise. Nevertheless, these very same religions that allow this 'freedom' to be read have also "irresistibly diverted it and misap- propriated it" so as if to prevent this abandonment to "accomplish itself" (ibid.). But what could accomplishment mean here? How and where, if anywhere, could 'freedom' give itself without being at the same time diverted and misappropriated? No place can be named where this comes about. And if Des Lieux divins leads to no place, even though it, in turn, "forges a path," as it were as a Wink of "freedom," then it does signal a rupture with the essence of place, indeed with the place as essence. Not in order to go anywhere else or to enter another region, let alone some ontological level, but in questioning, in an almost Levinasian manner, the unconditional privilege of the question where? Paradoxically, Nancy's lieux divins hint at the topicality of a non-lieu. 71 This 'freedom,' Nancy continues, "has death as its generic name, and an infi- nite number of forms and occasions throughout our lives." (ibid.). For a detailed reading of these motifs and others, notably in relation to the notion of ektopie (ectopics), cf. W. Hamacher, "Ou, seance, touce de Nancy, ici," a fragment of which has been published in Paragraph, vol. 16, no. 2, 1993.</page></plain_text>
