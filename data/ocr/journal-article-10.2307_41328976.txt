He is experiencing the sudden inaccessibility of his body when steeped in sin. When Hamleť s Claudius commands his stubborn knees to bend in prayer, he similarly discloses an attempt to reinhabit a body from which he finds himself banished through frat- ricide. The theological undertones of this idea are old: if humans are created in God's image, or if the body is a "temple" of the Holy Ghost ( Corinthians 6:19), then estrangement from the body through sin is the body's way of purging a divinely sanctioned space of the polluting effect of wrongdoing. Sin, rather than being regarded as rooted in an uncontrolled body mastering a soul, serves as the origin of a mind/ body split: in sin one is suddenly confronted with the body as other. Such categorical splits are relatively easy to articulate and represent. But how to capture more diffused, less assured, modalities of trans- formed relations between thought, body, and morality? I will suggest that a motif that recurs in Western literature, the image of a human being metamorphosed into a tree, articulates in various ways such pat- terns. By mobilizing a pictorial language that is symbolic rather than literal (Macbeth and Claudius refer to their actual hands and knees), humanized trees denote morally relevant transformations in a person's relation to inhabited space and his or her experience of the tension between what is constitutionally imposed and what is self-determined and freely chosen. This essay's first objective is, then, to elucidate and substantiate what may be called "moral embodiment" by analyzing literary episodes in which humans are transformed into trees. The loss of a human body - specifically its metamorphosis into a vegetative rather than an animal life-form - brings out the body's singular significance for those who are changed and for those with whom they communicate. Moral embodiment will include experiences such as the body becoming vis- ible in some unexpected way or acquiring a new meaning or unpre- dictably disclosing a hidden feature or being experienced as somehow withdrawing from the self. This literary analysis will then be wedded to New Literary History, 2011, 42: 439-453</page><page sequence="2">440 NEW LITERARY HISTORY moral approaches that emphasize fuller recognition of the other as the basis for moral interaction. The explanatory power (or lack thereof) of these recognition-based moral approaches (Stanley Cavell, Martin Buber, Emmanuel Lévinas) turns on the content provided to notions such as "recognition" or "acknowledgement," notions that are too often explained merely by stressing noninstrumental perception of another. Human-to-tree metamorphosis brings out several additional features regarding what substantive acknowledgement must mean, relating spe- cifically to the intake of another's somatic experience. A second implication of the following interrogation of human metamorphosis into trees - and it will remain largely an implication - concerns a significant, potentially damaging, discontinuity within the evolution of ethics. Moral thought, as it has been handed down to us, bifurcates personal experience into decision-making minds versus docile performing bodies. "Moral agency " is the outcome: a mind operating a body, much like a skilled driver operates a vehicle. Such vocabulary is a legacy of modernity's increasing association of the human body with a machine. We know that this ur-metaphor awaited the eighteenth cen- tury to be explicitly formulated by Julien Offray de La Mettrie, and that it was probably rooted in the materialistic outlook animating Thomas Hobbes's and René Descartes's writings (on animals) a century earlier.1 By suggesting a possible corporeal layering of moral experience, this essay participates in the growing literature within Anglo-American phi- losophy that attempts to destabilize this modernist heritage.2 Implied in the following is the suggestion that, from modernity on, moral thinking has receded from a previous intricate embeddedness of the moral in the corporeal. Implied, too, is the suggestion that some of these lost connections should be reclaimed. I. Consider, first, human metamorphosis into a tree as an outcome of sin. The most salient aspect of such punishment is that the sin ner-as- tree is doomed to perpetual immobility. Vices such as pride, sloth, gluttony, lechery, wrath, envy, or greed all progressively delimit freedom. The im- moral person can fully perceive his own entrapment, yet feel impotent to change. The sinner qua tree thus pictorially captures the self-defeating psychology of sin. Vice affects not merely the sinner's potential for action, but his organic constitution, which progressively becomes the means of his imprisonment. Such can be read into the figure (on the left) in Andrea Mantegna's painting Minerva Chasing the Vices from the Garden of Virtue (1502) :3</page><page sequence="3">TALKING TREES 441 Fig. 1. Andrea Mantegna, Minerva Chasing the Vices from the Garden of Virtue. Oil on can- vas. 161 X 192 cm. Louvre, Paris. Photograph from Réunion des Musées Nationaux/ Art Resource, NY Edmund Spenser's Fradubio (The Faerie Queene , Book I, Canto 2) un- dergoes a similar transformation due to sin. But in his case, he is not the only one to be changed. Fradubio's lover, the one he abandoned for fraudulent Duessa, is also metamorphosed into a tree. Fradubio and his lover are thus planted together, touching one another, as trees may, in a place that all shepherds shun. The lover whom Fradubio forsook allegorically stands for true religion, surreptitiously replaced by a false and glittering one. By placing Fradubio within sight and (wooden) touch of his previous lover, the punishment encompasses not only the sinner's petrified state and his awareness of being shackled by his own nature, but also the proximity of the right way, one which is now pain- fully - even tantalizingly - close, but forever out of reach. An additional dimension of the punishment consists in being placed in an inescap- ably exposed condition. Fradubio twice complains about his exposure to harsh weather. The allegory is thereby highlighting the pain induced by revealing the sinner to others. It brings out a sense of guilt consisting of</page><page sequence="4">442 NEW LITERARY HISTORY a felt incapacity of the sinner to diminish or conceal his accessibility to the public gaze, regardless of what they actually perceive (others, while avoiding the place, only see a tree). Alternatively, critics have also asso- ciated Fradubio with Adam (through an interpretive tradition in which Adam hid himself in a tree "by which concealment he has not hidden himself from the Lord, but the Lord from himself.").4 In this reading, exposure in sin is manifested not in being perceived, but consists of an attempt to avoid looking at others. From the perspective of this read- ing of the image as emblematic of guilt, the transformation into a tree articulates the loss of the sinner's capacity to reciprocate another's look. In contrast to Macbeth or Claudius, and like Mantegna's sinner above, Fradubio does not exhibit a dissociation from the guilty body. He is, rather, riveted into the distorted shape this body takes. We have here an image combining punishment, guilt, and a visual depiction of sin. The woodenized body - like the sick or aging body - is a body that no longer merely contains the mind. It is a body no longer capable of being smoothly and perspicuously used. By being represented as the source of corruption in this way, as constitutional rather than as a collection of performed deeds, sin becomes externally binding, limiting one's capacity to change. Sin - and this seems certainly appropriate for sins such as lechery or sloth - is thereby visualized as a prisonhouse which grows from within. Since sins often involve the participation of the lit- eral body, the iconic articulation of the sinner as tree does not merely capture symbolic relations between constitutional change and limited freedom, but extends to progressively developing restrictions that are imposed by a sinner's actual body over his or her identity. II. The transformation into a tree is often emblematic of a state of deep sadness and grief. Cyparissus, mourning for the death of his beloved deer, turns into a cypress tree, whose sap forms tearlike shapes on its trunk. Phyllis kills herself and is then transformed into an almond tree because her lover Demophoon fails to return. A Mediterranean folktale relates how red-barked Arbutus first grew in a spot where a shepherd slew his father; the Arbutus thus becomes a bleeding reminder of patricide. Why should trees stand for sadness or grief? The simpler connection is the anthropomorphic tendency to impose (for example, on weeping willows) a visual similarity between branches and arms raised or lowered in lament. But there also exists a deeper material link between burial rites and the growth of trees. Aware of the ultimate decomposition of</page><page sequence="5">TALKING TREES 443 human bodies, of their transformation into plants, the literary imagi- nation employs trees, the most resilient of plants, as facilitating both the griever's need to commemorate and his or her aggression towards this change. In Elsa Morante 's La Storia , the heroine begins to recoil from nature when grieving for her dead son, because all nature - and particularly its trees - strikes her as being nourished by her son's dead body. The ostensible similarities between burying and planting should also inform our perception of the significance of the imaginative links between trees and grief. The Chinese custom mentioned by James Frazer in The Golden Bough - planting trees on graves - is probably linked to the realization that the plants growing on the grave of a loved one incorporate something of the person who died. Burial is thus on some irreducible level a distorted form of planting. It is here that moral embodiment enters the picture. That burial may ben planting yokes together two distinct senses of life. On the one hand, we have individual life: the biographical segment that begins in birth and ends in death and that includes a personal history, attachments, memories, beliefs, sensitivities, achievements, and so forth. On the other hand, there exists a second, transpersonal experience of life: the life of matter, endlessly flowing into and out of us, never dying, merely changing its form and the kind of existence into which it passes.5 It is this second sense that is discomfiting, since it undercuts the immediacy of possessing one's body, questioning the tacit identification of the self with a proprietor, an identification which harmonizes so easily with the arch-metaphor of body-as-machine.6 It is also this second sense of life that is evoked by the image of a subject-turned-tree: a metamorphosis into a different living structure, motionless, yet still alive, somehow participating in and experiencing the organic rebirth and recycling of matter, which would usually occur only after death. From a perspective endorsing these two senses of life, what ties the humanized tree image to death is the overcoming of personal life by an impersonal mode of existence. When grievers are transformed into trees, the image captures a degree of identification with the deceased in which grievers duplicate the process they lament: that is, like the person who died, they too pass into a nonindividual form of life. The bond between griever and departed transcends personal connection and reaches into the griever's own transpersonal existence, registered in and through it. Cyparissus is the more interesting of the examples above, because he grieves for an animal, a companionship shaped by the vocabulary of touch, gesture, and smell. Being attuned to such dimensions is obviously personal, though touch and smell are personal in a different way than opinions, beliefs, biographies, or preferences. The bond with a com-</page><page sequence="6">444 NEW LITERARY HISTORY panion animal revolves around the material aspect of bodies (human bodies, animal bodies, and the interaction between them) . The currency of such relations is the way bodies feel, smell, or position themselves. The need for such transpersonal love is arguably the source of people bonding with animals in the first place. By turning into a tree, Cyparis- sus not only identifies with the ability of matter to outlive a particular lost entity, but he registers the loss of a particular tactile and olfactory constitution of living matter, the matter that perhaps only an animal, or perhaps only this animal, could fully take in. III. The previous section read Cyparissus's metamorphosis as touching on forms of attachment that are sensitive to the continuity of the matter out of which we are formed, rather than only to the personalities we cultivate. I claimed that the episode is one in which our twofold nature - impersonal, infinite, pliable matter versus personal, finite, structured identity - is united into a hybrid form that emphasizes the transformation of matter to which one's identity gives way. It is transpersonal matter that mediates the attachment with the animal over which one grieves. Accordingly, it is matter, rather than Cyparissus's identity, which registers the grief - the process whereby the griever expresses the inability to go on as who and what they were - through matter's transition into a dif- ferent life form. A similar pattern - in which the transformation into a tree is linked with an attachment to the transpersonal - figures in epi- sodes in which the change into a tree results from an attempt to avoid intercourse. Daphne warded off the sexual advances of Apollo and was "saved" by her father, Peneus, who turned her into a laurel tree (figs. 2 and 3) . Pitys escaped the sexual advances of Pan by metamorphosing into a pine tree. Apollo turned Acantha into a tree when she fought him off as he tried to rape her. Attis was remade into a pine tree by Cybele when he rejected the goddess. In all these tales, the unfortunate human being has been picked out as a love object by a god. The logic underlying such transformation, when it comes about as a defensive measure, is that these trees are kept as close to living human beings as possible, while being removed from the sensible experience that could render them vulnerable to pain or undesired sex. When, however, the transformation is applied as punishment for resisting intercourse, the tree state becomes a reduction rather than a defense. The infuriated, sexually frustrated god seems to be adverting the human being that if he or she truly wishes to avoid being ravished by a god, a tree - an entity which is alive yet no longer desiring or desired - is what they must become.</page><page sequence="7">TALKING TREES 445 Figs. 2 and 3. Bernini, Apollo and Daphne. Detail of the heads and Daphne's face. Galleria Borghese, Rome. Photographs by Mauro Magliani for Alinari/Art Resource, NY</page><page sequence="8">446 NEW LITERARY HISTORY A different linkage between the metamorphosis into a tree and sex is suggested in Orlando Furioso. Alcina, the wicked and beautiful witch, transforms a formidable knight into a myrtle tree upon discarding him as a lover (a forest of myrtle trees hides those destroyed by love in Virgil's underworld) . Here, the loss of agency caused by the metamorphosis into a tree includes degendering. The lover's reduction to a tree following the decline of his allure intriguingly taps into the ubiquitous, universal experience of waning passion. Once the beloved's charm ceases to draw the lover, there ensues in the beloved an experience of helpless, sexless, and genderless rigidity. Encased within a confining shell which cannot be loved, cannot reciprocate or make love, the humanized tree as discarded lover captures the experience of being doomed to stay put, of wavering between waiting (the myrtle's association with fidelity) and expecting nothing. What is this "sex" that one loses by being transformed through the punishment/defense of turning into a tree? Whatever else it is, inter- course can be a form of contact in which any imposition of a distinction between the physical and the psychological breaks down. Sex is that which takes place among bodies, in which the physical does not "sym- bolize" or "manifest" some "deeper" psychic communion, but can come to be that communion. Sex is connectedness and response constituted by both senses of being alive specified above - the personal and the transpersonal. When it is not a chore, an exchange, or an expression of power, sex can thus be a precious and unique form of acknowledging another, both in what one acknowledges in the other and in the fullness and variety through which one acknowledges. By "acknowledgement," a Cavellian term, one plausibly means a qualitative dimension of per- ception, in which looking at another imparts a welcoming acceptance of the perceived self in his or her embodiment as well as a wish to be similarly perceived. Acknowledgement is not a prelude to some deeper contact occurring through words and gestures, but occurs between bodies, coloring the words and gestures that they exchange. Sexual acknowledgement - unlike other forms of acknowledgement - is specifi- cally attuned to the pleasure-yielding capacities of bodies and is thus a unique meeting point of mind and body. By prematurely enacting a metamorphosis into the vegetative, hu- manized trees lose the capacity to bond in this dual way with another and - through the other - with their own matter. The metamorphosis robs individuals of the particularity of their own matter - now irrevers- ibly rearranged - and the ability to have such distinctiveness registered and welcomed by someone else.</page><page sequence="9">TALKING TREES 447 IV. These arguments about the dual structure of life and its relation- ship to the motif of the humanized tree can also deepen our sense of the meaning of violence. On one level, in some forms of violence, the transpersonal life of matter is forced into conflict with individual psychic identity. Elaine Scarry has already claimed that in torture the body is turned against the victim, as when, for example, the body's need for rest or breathing becomes a vehicle for generating pain. If one is in the grip of the image of the mechanized body, the body can merely be conceptualized as the source of the pain, which is consequently felt in the controlling mind. But if the self does not just use or inhabit a body but is somehow a dimension of it, we access a different meaning of violence. Violence can break the self down, in the sense of teasing out autonomous living structures that lie dormant within it. Violence is, in this sense, the precise opposite of erotic love as understood above. Love, too, is largely directed at those self-determining structures, at what was termed above "the transpersonal life of matter." Yet it touches them not in a way that fragments another's experience, but rather in in a way that occasions a momentary harmonization within the loved person. In erotic love, one is made to like the autonomous aspects of one's physical being, enjoying their independence and capacity to attract and give pleasure. In violence, the victim is horrified by these same aspects, repelled by their autonomy and ability to produce pain, and erase who one is. A different process relating to articulating pain through tree images is captured by the use of tree imagery in Toni Morrison's Beloved or in Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus. In these works, tree imagery un- derscores how violence works its way deeper into the psyche, feeding on the tormented self s own resources, hardening into an experience which becomes more and more resilient, permanent, inescapable, and entrenched. In Shakespeare's Lavinia, hideously cropped and "trimmed" (the play's terms) of her arms and tongue and then confronting her appalled father, or in Morrison's Sethe and the tree of whip scars that lives on her back, trees symbolize a reification of pain. I have discussed this particular use of tree imagery elsewhere in detail - specifically the extern alization of grief.7 1 would here like to add that these tree shapes are physically produced by the perpetrators of violence. More than a forced modification of another's body, violence entails the implanting oí an autonomous experiential structure that grows out of, and is nourished by, the victim's own resources. At times, the violence entailed in turning another into a tree seems to capture something of the form of trauma itself. Trauma possesses a</page><page sequence="10">448 NEW LITERARY HISTORY This brings us to transformations in the experience of words, a theme often touched upon by the talking trees of classical works of literature. Consider Ovid's description of the transformation of the Heliades into trees while grieving for the death of their brother ( Metamorphoses , 11.356-66). After four months of mourning, the sisters are startled to discover that they are being rapidly transformed into trees. They call their mother for help; she struggles to free them of the speedily en- crusting bark, tearing it away. Yet they scream in pain as she does so, begging her to stop, since the bark is becoming part of their bodies. The mother complies, and the last she sees of them is the bark sealing off their mouths, stifling their screams. The description accesses a depth of grief in which the screams of the griever are gradually internalized and are no longer heard on the outside. The sisters are removed from their mother, a fellow griever, who will, from now on, only be able to guess their pain. Ovid portrays a profound vision of the isolation of grief, of the manner by which language itself is transformed: it is no longer communicative but reverberates in an inner, secluded void from which nothing returns but the echoes of one's own voice. The description first suggests that this loneliness is not broken or mollified by fellow grievers. Secondly, that by retaining an external voice in a world devoid of those who are capable of listening to her, the mother is plunged into an even deeper seclusion than her daughters. Thirdly, that from the mother's perspective, the metamorphosis of her daughters into trees represents, too, the loss of other loved ones when one is in grief (tearing away at the bark is, in essence, a desperate attempt to retain them within a mother's loving reach). A twofold dysfunctionality living quality, its own development and resilience, as well as a seasonal nature. Part of trauma's mesmerizing hold over the victim is that the latter is not only crushed under his or her suffering, but is also hypnoti- cally gripped by witnessing the autonomous evolution of pain. Repre- sentations such as Sethe's tree of scars carried on her back or Lavinia haunting Titus as a walking bleeding tree become an external analogue for the experience of trauma as a self-determining, animated structure inhabiting another living entity. Self-fragmentation in trauma means that pain can be experienced as external to the subject, interpenetrating, possessing, exiting, and returning. Such banishment from the kernel of one's experience - even one's pain is not one's own - taps one of the more devastating aspects of the consequences of violence.8 V.</page><page sequence="11">TALKING TREES 449 of language in grief is thus mobilized by Ovid's image: the daughters' pain can no longer be adequately externalized, whereas that of their mother is heard by none. To be in grief is to be reembodied in a non- communicative structure, seemingly linked to one's human context, but actually disassociated from it. One's body ceases to respond and reach out, one's ears no longer hear, one's mouth no longer talks. Nothing in Ovid's image suggests that the griever cannot be acknowledged by another. His point is different. Such recognition, even if achieved, will never truly reach the griever, due to the woodenization effected by loss. The Heliades lose their voice altogether. But literary images of a person turned into a tree sometimes latch onto a less categorical withdrawal from language. A requirement of accessing the significance of these specific images of partial loss of voice is that one must avoid a mere instrumental understanding of vocalization. The voice is not simply used , nor does it merely express. To voice is to materialize words - mental enti- ties - through one's body and breath. Voice is thus embodied language, the meeting point between mind and body, private and public, between the unarticulated and the stated, between the qualitatively undefined and the pitch specific. The inability to move smoothly from intended articulation to actual speech arrests the woodenized person between what one feels and what one can potentially share, between crude and specific meaning, between naked, uninflected text and the particular, temporally specific personalization effected by an act of verbalization.9 The labored speech of a humanoid tree in Dante's Wood of the Suicides ( Inferno , XIII) instances a being thrown into this intermediary state. The strenuous narration of the suicide highlights the huffing and puffing through the broken, bleeding spigot which intermingles speech and blood (1. 44). Language - the quintessentially and distinctively hu- man attribute - resists the man-turned-tree and can no longer be simply employed once one has ungratefully abdicated one's unique existence.10 Ludovico Ariosto 's Orlando Furioso (VI. 27-53), devotes entire stanzas (27, 32) to a prolonged analogy between the roars and groans emanating from a burning piece of wood - as the heat transforms the entrapped air into sound - and Astolfo's effort to speak once he is transformed into a myrtle. In Ariosto's sizzling picture, boiling sap drawn out of a bark resembles the words that are forced out of wooden Astolfo. The essential relation of both images to vocalization is that by becom- ing a tree, one's experience of using language has been augmented. Contrary to expectations, the bleeding trees in Dante, Spenser, Torquato Tasso, or Virgil do not appear to be interested in talking, or eager to prolong the conversation with those who visit them. Language becomes a response triggered by a subject who chances on the woodenized person.</page><page sequence="12">450 NEW LITERARY HISTORY The specific quality of this passivity is noteworthy, too. Speech ceases to flow spontaneously, and will only be initiated by a painful and ag- gressive breaking off of a shoot (it sometimes requires breaking two or three branches to activate speech). For talking trees, the volitional act that makes one's speech one's own is replaced by a distant, cause-effect experience of language. Language emanates from a remote body, com- municating but no longer conveying, and the unique embeddedness of thought in the body enabled through vocalization is no longer there. Language is drawn out of the trees like milk from the dug of a cow.11 VI. Noting patterns of moral embodiment harmonizes with approaches in ethics in which morality involves a fuller intake or acknowledgment of the other, approaches for which the right actions and virtues flow out of achieved meaningful contact. For such orientations, morality is centrally about accessing and touching particularities of the state in which another's thoughts, emotions, fantasies, regrets, guilt, and hopes interplay. The crucial term to explore in the context of these theories is "accessing." The degree to which acknowledgement becomes a sig- nificant act or merely an empty placeholder depends on the capacity to infuse palpable and operative content into what accessing another means in practice. The pictorial clusters surveyed in this essay belong to a world in which inhabiting a body encompasses and makes manifest one's psyche, and in which one's mental world is sometimes located in one's incarnation. The crudely literal versions of this claim, upholding some parallelism between looks and moral virtue - for example, Francis Bacon's Of De- formity or Cesare Lombroso's Criminal Man - are, thankfully, no longer with us (modern cartoons being an exception). Ideas such as these, or the medieval notion that sin is a physically corrupting disease which can be subjected to a medical cure,12 should not be reclaimed. But the examination of literary images involving de- and reembodiment exposes an entwining of morality and somatic experience in much more subtle and interesting ways, ways that can be rewardingly reintroduced into perceptions guiding contemporary moral thought. Some forms of human loss or suffering involve a transformation of the experience of objects, space, body, and language. In such states, the inner erupts onto the surface, controls one's body, and is transformed into an ungovernable entity that restricts movement, determines posture, prevents the refocus- ing of one's attention, and desensitizes the self. In such states, moreover,</page><page sequence="13">TALKING TREES 451 the self is insulated. Its capacity to change and control its surroundings through movement is hampered. The self is also rendered inescapably visible, and only partially communicative. Some forms of suffering, pun- ishment, grief, or moral failure are thus not simply "mental" states, but a recreation of the self as an altogether different life-form. They are a kind of rebirth, in which one begins to inhabit one's world in a new way. The convergence between the progressive secularization of morality in modernity, a depictorialization of moral outlook, and a corresponding mechanization of the body may be responsible for the disappearance of this imagery of metamorphosis from a post-Renaissance literary vo- cabulary. The more the body was reduced to an instrument carrying the self or worn by it, as Cartesian dualism implied, the less it was able to contain and express abstract meanings. The body could merely furnish psychophysical "symptoms," surface indicators of some "genuinely work- ing" inner structures. No longer was it perceived as that which can be lost through sin, grief, punishment, or violence, as that which can change its feel and capacities through loss. Here literature aids the philosopher, since while Western philosophy was almost unanimously denigrating the body, the literary imagination was able to record a more complex picture of the body's involvement in moral experience and more subtle relations between the body and particular values. Such complexity re- cedes in literature, too, once the mechanization of the body came to be progressively established as the only credible explanatory paradigm. Finally, let us note that literature's moral contribution here does not consist of the conventional appeal to empathy and literature's excep- tional suitability as a medium for invoking it. The bark with which the humanized trees are overlaid is imported into their rough and jagged links with the reader, preventing us from experiencing empathy. Like the characters who encounter these talking trees, we mostly wish to leave them. Such insulation is not an aesthetic flaw, but part of the liter- ary insightfulness of these descriptions. Unlike empathy, a notion that underscores the possibility of knowing what it is like to be another, the tree persons and the protagonists who find their presence unbearable bring out the difficulty one has in meeting the gaze of a sufferer/sinner/ victim, the choice not to imagine what such experiences are like. The literary image here facilitates contact, but also articulates resistance to it. To note that such is our response strengthens rather than weakens the moral contribution implicit in these images. For once we are open to the possibility that the body is somehow nonmetaphorically involved in particular processes and experiences, and that our present, mechanically inclined conceptualizations of the body occlude such participation, we are prompted to seek to deepen and refine what acknowledging others</page><page sequence="14">452 NEW LITERARY HISTORY might mean. If acknowledging others crucially depends upon attending to the modes by which another's "inner" reality is their embodiment rather than accessing the discursive ways in which they would describe their experience, the psychologically oriented empathy we rightly strive to cultivate and refine ought to be complemented by forms of looking and attending embodied presence that achieve a different connection with another's experience.

The "pro-body" philosophical movement is obviously less contemporary if one considers phenomenology (primarily Maurice Merleau-Ponty) and its offshoots within continental philosophy (see The Body: Classic and Contemporary Readings , ed. Donn Welton [Oxford: Blackwell, 1999]). It is less contemporary too, if one considers various counterthoughts to the marginalization and instrumentalization of the body within Western philosophy itself. Plato, for example, was complementing the Socratic image of the soul as riveted onto the body with much more subtle models: the soul and body likened to the relations between harmony and instrument, for example ( Phaedo ), or the body as that which, while controlled by the mind as a chariot and horses are by the charioteer, also contains its own separate wings, parts, that is, which elevate the individual ( Phaedrus ). 3 I will read the figure on the left of the painting as a sinner in the garden, but she can also be plausibly read as a victim of other sinners if one associates her with Daphne, an association supported both by the particular tree she turns to in the painting (which seems to be a laurel tree), and the inscriptions covering her body, inscriptions that befit a victim more than a sinner (the inscriptions call the virtues to expunge sin). 4 James Nohrnberg (citing from Gregory's Moralia), The Analogy of the Faerie Queene (Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ.

Press, 1996] ) that when Sigmund Freud introduced his concept of traumatic repetition, he drew heavily on an episode in Tasso 's Jerusalem Delivered : Tancred's beloved, Clorinda, speaks to him from within the tree she says she has become after he had mistakenly killed her (Jerusalem Delivered, 13.42-6). Although the voice is not really issuing from Clorinda, but is rather counterfeited by Ismen, the episode figures centrally in Freud's analysis of trauma as a compulsion to repeat painful experiences. Freud regards Tasso's story as one of the most poignant instances of traumatic repetition: the process of undergoing trauma, and then recreating it through one's own agency. Although Freud misreads the story, it is significant in our context that his theory of trauma can be traced back to tree imagery. Freud highlights repetition as such, eschewing the fact that the image involves a tree (or that the incorporation of the tree is, perhaps, what makes the image so moving for him). Standing for the traumatic kernel, the tree incorporates a) the experience of one's guilt as a living structure that one can abruptly encounter-, b) that the source of one's pain, guilt, and shame speaks-, and c) that what one used to love now induces terror. 9 For more extended elaboration of these remarks on the voice, see my "Listening to Actors" (in preparation). 10 Ruben Borg, a colleague and a Dante scholar, informs me that it is a commonplace of this canto's criticism to note how Dante repeats words in various inflections and modes, creating a twisting, knotty linguistic quality that mimics the tree imagery. 1 1 Intriguingly, in some of these representations, the effect of the speaking tree on its human recipient is contagious. Aeneas reports that his voice stuck in his throat when listening to Polydorus. Ariosto's Ruggiero has to regain the power of speech in order to reply to the tree. 12 Rosanne Gasse, "The Practice of Medicine in Piers Plowman," The Chaucer Review 39, no. 2 (2004): 177-97, n. 5.</page></plain_text>
