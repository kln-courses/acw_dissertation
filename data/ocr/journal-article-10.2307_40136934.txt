<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPANISH: NOTED 87 Federico Bermudez-Canete. Transparencia de la tierra. Madrid. Insula. 1980. 53 pages. The tradition of lyrical descriptions of nature, apparent in his first work, Paisajes vividos, also gives structure to Bermudez- Canete's second volume, and the esthetic qualities of his prose fully separate this collection from works conceived primarily to inform the reader. Metaphorical expressions augment the subjective tone and the theme in the title: that nature is a manifestation of something beyond itself. Although the author concentrates on landscape, with sparse references to human population, the personification of na- ture, primarily through the use of verbs (nubes desfilan, lomos se despliegan), and the second-person pronoun addressed to an un- identified being anchor these descriptions of eastern Andalucia to an anthropomorphic base. Sentence fragments and a select vocabulary create a rhythm and tone commensurate with the content. J.H.Abbott</page></plain_text>
