Abstract  In Swedish preschools, visits to nature environments are traditionally seen as  important, and during the past two decades, interest in outdoor education has  increased. This article concerns different ways of talking about and making use of  nature in everyday activities in a Swedish preschool with an outdoor focus. The  researcher studied 32 children between 11⁄2 and 6 years old and their teachers  during a one-year period. The data collected include ethnographic material such as  video observations, interviews and local documents. The analysis indicates that  nature is used in three ways: as a classroom where children learn about nature, as  a home—a peaceful place for eating, sleeping and playing, and as an enchanted  world, a fairyland.

This preschool has been studied in the  context of a project about nature as a symbol of ideal childhood.1 In Scandinavia,  there is a strong notion that children and nature belong together (Gullestad 1997),  and this connection is the focus of our interest in the project. The studied preschool  is special because it has an outdoor profile, but the results nevertheless say  something about ordinary preschools, as spending time outdoors and in natural  environments are preferred activities in Swedish preschools. In an inquiry sent to  100 preschools in Stockholm, staff report that the average time spent outdoors was  5.8 hours on a summer day, 3.6 hours on a spring or autumn day, and 2.0 hours  on a winter day if the weather was nice. When the weather was bad, the  corresponding figures were 2.6 hours, 2 hours and 1.5 hours. In preschools with  outdoor profiles, even more hours were spent outdoors (Söderström et al. 2004).     The curriculum for the Swedish preschool states that “great emphasis” should be  put on “issues concerning the environment” and that the preschool “should  contribute to ensuring children acquire a caring attitude to nature and the  environment, and understand that they are a part of nature’s recycling process”  (Swedish National Agency for Education 2006, 7). The interest in outdoor education  for all age levels is increasing in Sweden. In teacher education programs, courses in  outdoor education are being offered. At Linköping University, the National Center  for Outdoor Education is involved in research as well as education.    Since the first kindergartens were started in Sweden around 1900, nature has been  seen as an important part of the program. Jean Jacques Rousseau’s and Friedrich  Fröbel’s ideas about nature have had a strong impact on the Swedish preschool  (Swedish Government 1997, 157). The conception of the child and the ideas about  education that Rousseau promotes in his book Emile ou de l’education (Rousseau  1762) still have an influence (Dahlberg and Lenz Taguchi 1994). Rousseau thought  children should be brought up in nature to avoid the damaging influences of  society. Children were supposed to learn through their own experiences rather than  through instruction. Nature was an important resource and a source of knowledge,  and children should learn through physical interaction with the material world,  beginning with the closest environment and gradually progressing to wider circles.  Children ought to spend considerable time outdoors, preferably barefoot and lightly  dressed. In a similar way, Fröbel’s ideas have had a great influence on the Swedish  preschool. In the philosophy that he formulated in his book Die Menchenerziehung  in 1826, nature has a central position. Children were supposed to learn to love  nature early. Their knowledge about nature should be based on experiences and  observations. The teacher’s task was primarily to awaken in them a feeling for  nature. The important thing was not that children learned the names of natural                                                    1 The project is called “The Significance of Nature in Modern Childhood” and the project  leader is Gunilla Halldén at Department of Child Studies, Linköping University. The project  was funded by the Swedish Research Council.     </page> <page sequence="3"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 6  objects, but that they got to know them by using their senses. Fröbel’s decision to  call the institution kindergarten mirrors his pedagogical view; he saw the child as a  plant and the teacher as a gardener who was to make the plant flourish.     Nature as a Cultural Symbol  Gullestad (1992) argues that nature is an important cultural symbol in Scandinavia  and that the national identities of the Nordic countries are related to nature.  Gullestad shows that the concept of nature is complex and that this complexity is  related to its symbolic character. Symbols are not restricted to a single context;  they absorb meanings from different situations. Symbols contain their own  oppositions, often only one of which is expressed, while the other is implicit.  Gullestad suggests that nature is a part of two oppositions of particular importance.  First, there is the opposition between home and nature, where home is related to  order and security while nature is connected to wildness and danger. Nature  provides resistance; in nature the human is trained to cope and survive. Second,  there is an opposition between nature and the city. In this opposition, nature  represents cosmos, order and wholeness, while the city represents chaos and  fragmentation. Nature helps to create a feeling of wholeness in a person, and many  people have spiritual experiences in natural environments. In the nature-city  opposition, nature, like the home, represents harmony. Gullestad does not consider  the complexity of the concept of nature problematic; she thinks instead that good  symbols can always be understood in different ways. Complexity allows many  people to identify with a symbol without having to agree on its meaning (Gullestad  1992).    (Natural) Places as Socially Constructed  Olwig and Gulløv (2003) have stressed that although places are of great importance  to social life, the notion that the character of places is socially constructed has not  been problematized sufficiently in sociology and social anthropology. Rasmussen  (2004) discusses the place concept in an article about “children’s places.” He draws  on Relph (1976), who thinks that place refers to a specific, recognizable part of  space. A place is given meaning through human experiences of that given physical  locality. Rassmussen also refers to Tuan (1977), who in a similar way considers  that a place is constituted through experiences as humans get to know it better and  connect it with social meaning.     One point of departure in my understanding of natural places is that they are also  given meaning through human experiences, including social experiences. The  meaning they are given has to do with the different ideas people have about  nature. In turn, the meanings we associate with the concept of nature influence  how we talk about and relate to it. The aim of the present article is to show how  nature is used for pedagogical purposes in the setting under study. How do the  teachers make use of and present different nature places to children in the  everyday life of a preschool?    The Study  The study discussed here was carried out from August 2006 to June 2007. The  investigation had an ethnographic approach; I acted as a participant observer on    </page> <page sequence="4"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 7  average one day a week. The data consist of field notes, video observations (38  hours), informal conversations with children, interviews with staff members (10  hours) and parents (12 hours), photographs and local documents. This article  mainly draws from my field notes, video observations in nature environments and  interviews with staff.     In ethnographic research, the analysis process starts from the first day of the  investigation and impacts the choices made for data gathering (Hammersley and  Atkinson 1995). In August 2006 when I made my first visits, new children were  introduced to the preschool. This awoke my interest in how the forest near the  preschool would be presented to the beginners. I decided to observe the new  children’s first days in the forest and how the nature environment was introduced to  the children by the staff. My first analysis was based on field notes that were typed  out immediately after the field work and video observations and interviews that  were transcribed in rough outlines. I posed different questions to the material: How  is nature used in play and pedagogical activities? How is it presented to the children  by the staff? Which aspects of nature are put forward? I read the transcriptions  several times and noted and developed categories. During the year, I continued to  put the same kind of questions to the material and transcribed some episodes from  the video observations in detail. My interpretations were cross-checked in  workshops and seminars where I shared the material with members of the project  group and other research colleagues.    Data from the observations and the interviews were consistent; the staff expressed  the same view of nature in the interviews as they did in action in nature  environments. This article mainly draws from video transcriptions2 to underpin my  findings, as these concrete episodes are more illustrative and interesting than  utterances.     Outdoor Preschools  The studied preschool is a so-called “I Ur och Skur” (approximately translated as  “all-weather”) preschool. These preschools are conducted in cooperation with  Friluftsfrämjandet, which is an important national organization for outdoor life in  Sweden.  This type of “forest” or “outdoor” preschool has existed since the mid- 1980s, and today there are around 170 of them in Sweden, according to the  registry of Friluftsfrämjandet. I Ur och Skur preschools carry out outdoor education,  and a large part of the day is spent outdoors. Their aim is to give children  knowledge about nature, to make them aware of the environment and help them  acquire a feeling for nature.     Nature awareness education is mediated through play and pedagogy characterized  by exploration. In this kind of preschool, the traditional preschool program is  integrated with the approach of Friluftsfrämjandet, which has organized outdoor  activities for children of different ages since 1950. At that time, schools in which                                                    2 In the transcripts, brackets are used to mark non-verbal actions carried out  simultaneously with talk.

In  the forest schools, children learn about flora and fauna, environmental protection  and camp life. One central idea is that children should learn by having fun, by  playing, singing and fantasizing about the animals and plants of the forest. A  special part of the pedagogy involves imaginary characters, which are used to  arouse excitement and encourage the children to use their imagination. The most  important of these characters is the troll Mulle, a forest creature who is made from  the material of the forest (Rantatalo 2000).     During the first decades of the outdoor schools’ existence, many different kinds of  materials were used to teach children about flora and fauna; for example, pictures  of animals were brought to the forest. An important development in the forest  schools’ pedagogy took place in the 1970s when magnifying glasses were  introduced. The children’s own experiences became central. They are encouraged to  explore and to collect, sort and compare. Sensory impressions are considered  important to the children’s understanding and conceptualizations, and their desire  to discover and explore is considered even more important than it had been before  (Rantatalo 2000).    The Preschool  In the preschool under study, here called The Rainbow, there are two groups, one  with 18 places for children between 3 and 6 years old and the other with 14 places  for children between 1 and 3 years old. The staff consists of three leaders3 for each  group plus two extra leaders for children with special needs, a manager (who also  has the responsibility for an outdoor primary school), and a cook who prepares  breakfast, a hot meal for lunch and snacks. The preschool is located in an ordinary  residential building. The premises are adapted to preschool activities, and the site  are as big and well-equipped as in a “regular” preschool. The yard is shared with  people who live in the surrounding houses, which means that the staff has limited  opportunities to influence its design. The preschool is located about 50 meters from  the edge of a wood.     The preschool is imbued with nature in different ways. First and foremost, a large  part of the day is spent outdoors in natural environments. Nature is also  incorporated in other ways; conversations, fairy tales, songs, rhymes and games  mostly have themes from nature. The preschool and the two groups have names  connected to nature. Furthermore, the artifacts used during gatherings—books,  pictures, objects—preferably depict nature elements.     Three or four days a week the groups head for the forest. One day a week is spent  in the yard so that some staff members can have meetings while the others take  care of the children. The weather does have an impact. If it is very cold or if there  is snow and ice on the ground, the small children stay in the yard.                                                       3 In I Ur och Skur-preschools, the teachers are titled leaders in accordance with the  tradition of Friluftsfrämjandet.    </page> <page sequence="6"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 9  Each of the two groups has its own “base place” near the preschool. In these base  places, the “log ring” is an important place (Figure 1). It consists of four thick logs  placed in a square. The log rings are used for gatherings and snacks. The 3- to 6- year-old group’s base place is located in a grove close to the preschool. The 1- to  3-year-old group’s place is situated a few hundred meters away. For the small  children, the walk to the base place is considered important, and there are special  “stop places” along the way where children and staff wait for each other and look at  something that nature provides or that the leaders have prepared. The base places  are carefully chosen to provide environments that are considered appropriately  challenging in relation to the children’s ages. The 3- to 6-year-olds’ place contains a  small hill, trees, a ditch that is sometimes filled with water, and it includes areas  where children can play out of sight of adults and other children. The 1- to 3-year- olds’ place is an open plateau with minor differences in ground level, and it is  surrounded by trees and bushes. There are stones and two big pits sometimes filled  with water. Both places have flat areas where organized games led by the staff are  played. The groups generally leave the preschool shortly after nine o’clock. During  the winter half of the year, they stay in the forest until noon. Lunch is served at one  o’clock and a snack consisting of sandwiches and a warm drink is served in the  forest around ten o’clock. During the summer half of the year, the groups often  stay in the forest to have lunch and sleep or rest. Sometimes warm food is fetched  from the preschool by one of the leaders, and sometimes prepared food is warmed  on a camping stove or over an open fire.     Figure 1. The 3- to 6-year-olds’ log ring4                                                          4 All photographs were taken by the author.    </page> <page sequence="7"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 10  All the children at The Rainbow also are divided into smaller groups called forest  school groups which are a traditional part of Friluftsfrämjandet’s program (see  description above). The forest school groups start when the preschool semester has  been underway a few weeks in the autumn and spring and are terminated some  weeks before Christmas and the summer holiday. The forest school groups consist  of approximately five children of the same age, who once a week walk to the forest  with their own leader, who is one of the staff. They leave the preschool slightly  after nine o’clock and stay out between one-and-a-half and three hours, depending  on the children’s ages. They walk to a special group place selected by the leader  and they always follow the same paths to get there. During group time, the children  are taught about nature in different ways, they play games and eat snacks that  each child has brought in her or his rucksack.    Besides the forest school groups, the 3- to 6-year-olds’ group from The Rainbow  sometimes takes excursions to the sea or other places in the surrounding forest.    Different Ways of Using Nature  In my observations, I found that nature was used at the school in three main ways:  • as a classroom where children learn about nature in different ways.  • as a home—a peaceful place in which to eat, sleep, socialize and play.  • as an enchanted world—a fairyland populated by fairy figures and animals  with human traits.    A Norwegian study in a nature-oriented child care center (Nilsen 2006) identified  other ways of using nature, such as a place to be protected and cared for and  nature as a place for outdoor life. However, as these were less common in my  observations I have chosen to exclude them from the present paper and focus on  the three predominant ways of using nature.     Nature as a Classroom    One day in June, the 3- to 6-year-old group visits a lake not far from the  preschool. When we, after a short bus trip and a walk, reach the shore,  we sit down in the shade under a tree to have a snack. One of the  leaders walks together with two children out on a bridge to check the  water temperature. Another leader shows the children items they are  allowed to use, like strainers, pipettes and magnifying glasses. There are  also reference books for plants and insects that live at the water’s edge.  The children are told they are allowed to go into the water, but only until  the water reaches their knees, no farther. Children and adults spread out  along the shore. Most of the children wade in the water and pick up  plants, stones and other material from the lake. The children are dressed  in T-shirts, shorts or rolled-up pants, and sunhats. One of the leaders sits  on the bridge together with a couple of children, looking for an insect that  one of the children has found in a reference book.      </page> <page sequence="8"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 11  Figure 2. Excursion to a lake        In this episode, the children appear as small researchers who investigate, invent  and discover various elements of nature. They are intensely busy exploring their  findings. They are used to this kind of activity. They have visited the same place  many times during different seasons, and both the environment and the tools are  familiar to them. A “regular” preschool on the other side of the shore constitutes an  interesting contrast. In this group, the children and the staff are sitting in the sun  on blankets a few meters from the shore. They are all dressed in bathing suits.  Spades and other plastic toys in bright colors are placed in the sand. A few children  swim together with adults.     In the example above, the children at The Rainbow learn by exploring, something  that can be related to the new ideas brought into Friluftsfrämjandet in the 1970s.  This exploratory pedagogy is also common in the forest school groups. When I join  the forest school group for the 5- to 6-year-olds one day in March, the children  each have a magnifying glass hanging around their necks. To begin, we walk over  an open area with dry grass, bedrocks and moss. On the way to the group’s own  place, we make several stops. The leader encourages the children to look at the  moss with their magnifying glasses. She also rolls over two stones and together  with the children she examines what is under them. They find ants and a snail. The  leader also urges the children to observe what has happened since they walked this  way a week earlier, and to look for signs of spring. Among other things, they look  at and touch pussy willow buds. When we reach the forest, the leader and the  children examine some trees—mountain ash, aspen and birch—by comparing their  buds and leaves from last year, lying on the ground with pictures in a book.     </page> <page sequence="9"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 12    The group has also done an experiment: The last time they met before Christmas,  they nailed things on a board: a leaf, a plastic bag, a piece of fabric and an orange  peel. They dug the board down into the soil and left it there over the winter. When  they returned for the spring semester, the leader and the children investigated  what had happened to the different materials. Starting from the experiment, the  natural cycles were discussed.     This pedagogy, in which children are given opportunities to actively explore and  experiment, is based on the theories of John Dewey and Jean Piaget. They both  underline, though from different theoretical perspectives, that children learn best  when they are allowed to actively explore their environment (Dewey 1990; Piaget  1989).     Some of the exploratory activities are organized as themes. For example, one of  the forest schools for 4- to 5-year-olds is working with a special butterfly species  for the entire spring semester, a theme chosen by the children. The leader  introduces the theme by conducting interviews with each child to find out what they  know about butterflies. She also lets every child draw a butterfly. The children work  with the theme in different ways. Butterflies are studied in nature and in books,  games in which the children pretend to be butterflies are played and pictures of  butterflies are created and discussed. The project ends in the same way as it  started—the children are interviewed and invited to draw a butterfly again. The  organization of the project is similar to the pedagogical approach used in the Italian  town of Reggio Emilia, where projects start from children’s pre-understanding of a  subject and are developed in interplay between the teachers and the children. One  project often lasts for a long period (Rinaldi 2004)    Alternating with this exploratory and experimental pedagogy is a more traditional  pedagogical approach in which the leader mediates facts. When the 5- to 6-year- olds go to the forest in the episode above, the leader teaches them about the  different animals and plants they are observing. She tells the children, for example,  about how the snails protect themselves against cold in the winter and that there  are different kinds of birches. The gathering in the forest later on is reminiscent of a  classroom situation. The leader uses a wall chart that illustrates different signs of  spring, and together with the children she recalls the signs they have seen today.  In these activities, she poses questions to the children. Here, a well-known pattern  in pedagogical situations can be seen: the leader poses a question, lets a child  answer, and then gives feedback (Mercer 1995). This is in accordance with  observations in the Norwegian study mentioned above; Nilsen (2006) found that  this classroom pattern was common when the staff talked about animals with the  children.    In the work with the youngest children, knowledge of species is not given great  weight, although such elements do appear. The focus is instead on encouraging the  children to experience nature with their senses, like in the following episode.      </page> <page sequence="10"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 13  A leader and her forest school group are heading out into the forest. This  day four children, 2-21⁄2 years old, are participating. It is raining slightly.  When they have walked a few meters on the path, the leader stops. She  squats down, gathering the children around her.   Leader: Can you see that there is something on this leaf?  Child: It has rained.  Leader: They are wet—raindrops—you can hear them if you listen. Can  you hear that it’s raining on the leaves!  Niclas: (takes of his cap to hear better) Raindrops on my head! (He  laughs.)   The leader starts to read a rhyme about rain together with the children.  They carry on walking along the path and stop after a few meters at a  small juniper shrub.   Leader: How does this feel? Is it soft? Prickly? It prickles a little, do you  feel it Niclas?  Niclas: (touches) Yes.  Next stop is at a rock with moss on it.   The leader tells the children to touch it and that Jenny, who is wearing  mittens, can feel it with her cheek.  Leader: Feels like it’s wet.  Niclas: It is wet!  Leader: Did you feel it Jenny? Or you can feel it with the tip of your  nose—you can smell it at the same time.    When the leader talks with the children about nature elements, she encourages  them to use all their senses. She invites them not only to look but also to feel,  listen to and smell things. The sensory impressions are central, and using her voice  and facial expressions the leader in this episode helps create a feeling of fascination  and wonder. This way of presenting nature is in accordance with the aims of the  forest schools.     This way of teaching is also close to what both Rousseau (1762) and Fröbel (1826)  suggested. The teacher’s task is not to teach children about the names of different  species, but to encourage them to experience nature with their senses and thus get  a feeling for it. This opinion also is expressed by the manager of the preschool at an  information meeting for parents who are applying for a place in the preschool for  their children. She says that the important thing is not to teach the children facts  about nature, as that comes automatically when the children play, experience and  have fun.     To conclude, at this preschool, nature is used as an environment for learning, a  classroom outdoors, where different pedagogical methods are used to encourage  children to learn about and experience nature. Great importance is given to sensory  exploration, to experiencing nature with all the senses. The children are made  observant of the details in nature.       </page> <page sequence="11"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 14  Nature as a Home    It is a day in June and the children in the 1- to 3-year-olds’ group are  going to have a rest after eating lunch at their base place. Before lunch  they have had time for play. An open tent is raised and blankets are  spread on the ground. The children take off their caps and boots. Some  of them want to keep trousers and socks on, others just want to wear  underpants or briefs and T-shirts. The leader who is responsible for the  rest time places the eight children close to each other and puts a blanket  over each of them. Some of them have pacifiers. The leader lies down by  their heads and reads a fairy story to them. The wind flutters in the  canvas and a blackbird warbles nearby. Some of the children are lying on  their backs and touch the canvas with their feet. One girl is lying on her  face and plays with some needles while she listens to the story. Some of  the children fall asleep while others are allowed to go on playing after  having rested for a while.    Figure 3. Rest time for the small children        During the summer half of the year, the groups spend as much time as possible in  the forest. They eat, sleep, go to the toilet, play and socialize in the forest. Every  function has its own place. Just as in a home, there is a “dining room,” a “bedroom”  and a “bathroom” in each of the base places. In this regard, it is possible to say  that the base place is made use of as a home.       </page> <page sequence="12"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 15  The focus on care and physical needs—eating, sleeping, wearing appropriate  clothes, and relieving oneself—also creates a home feeling. It is also possible to say  that the base places are used as preschool settings with the same kind of rooms  and functions found indoors in a Swedish preschool.5 In part, the same routines as  in indoor preschools are used. The gathering at the log ring is an example. Here the  groups are gathered for a time of daily interaction. The episode above in which the  children were having a rest was preceded by a gathering at the log ring with  teacher-led conversations and song time. After that it was time to go to the “dining  room”—a flat piece of rock with a thin layer of grass—to have lunch. This dining  area was chosen because it is easier for the children to sit on the ground when they  are eating than to sit on a log where it is difficult to balance their cups and plates.     A leader who has been in the preschool’s staffroom for a break returns  with a stroller loaded with food. Today meat, mashed potatoes and  vegetables are being served. As they arrive with their water bottles and  sitting cushions, the children are helped to sit down at their places. They  sit in a circle in the same order as at the log ring. One of the girls has  taken off her boots and picks at her toes. She is corrected by Malin, one  of the leaders, who says: ‘Lisa, at the table we don’t need to sit and pick  at our toes.’ Malin also tells Lisa, Ulrika and Ellen to put away some of the  pegs they are playing with and that they can ‘play with them later on,  after the rest time’. Karin, another leader, spreads a tablecloth that  functions as a serving table on the ground. She puts food on the plates  and as they are filled a boy helps her to give the plates to his peers. A  girl is told to go around and offer the children pieces of carrot, cucumber  and tomato. When the meal is almost over, Ellen and Ulrika turn around  at their places and continue playing with the pegs they were playing with  earlier. Lisa leaves her place and sits down opposite the other two girls.  Malin says to her: ‘Lisa, come and take your seat again, we are still  eating, we are going to have fruit as well and clear the table.’ A child  collects the plates. Karin asks one child after another which fruit they  want: ‘apple, kiwi or banana.’ Ulrika and Ellen have found pieces of birch  bark that they pretend are foldable cell phones. Malin says: ‘Ulrika and  Ellen, put those away, we are still sitting at the table.’ The girls put the  pieces of birch bark behind their backs.    The lunch in the episode above is reminiscent in several ways of an indoor lunch at  preschool or at home. Though lunch takes place in the forest, a warm and complete  meal with meat, potatoes, vegetables and fruit is served. A tablecloth is used as a  serving table. The children are engaged in serving food to their peers, which is  similar to the common practice in Swedish preschools of letting the children set the  table. Verbal expressions such as “at the table” and “clear the table” create a  feeling of sitting at a dinner table. The children are seated in a certain order, the                                                    5 In comparison with English preschools, the premises of Swedish preschools are organized  in a homelike manner (Nordin-Hultman 2004). Care and education are combined. Many  children spend a great part of their days in preschool. A warm meal is served in the middle  of the day and after that the children generally have a rest.     </page> <page sequence="13"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 16  same from one day to another, something that is common in preschools and in  many homes. Furthermore, the staff require that the children use their indoor table  manners—they are not allowed to pick at their feet or to play during the meal.    “Going to the toilet” is also an important part of the daily program. All children,  except the oldest, are gathered by one of the leaders “to go and wee-wee,” often  directly after meals, before the next event in the schedule begins. The groups have  special places that they always use to urinate. The girls are taught to hold on to a  tree so they can squat down, lean slightly backwards and urinate without wetting  their trousers. If the children in the 3- to 6-year-olds’ group need to “do number  two” one of the leaders follows them back to the preschool. The 1- to 3-year-olds  who wear diapers have their diapers changed in the forest, while the others use a  potty that is brought to the forest.     The staff at The Rainbow consider routines to be important. They strive to follow  the same routines every day, as far as possible. They walk in a line to the forest.  The stay in the forest starts with a gathering and a snack in the log ring, followed  by organized games, free play, lunch and rest. The children urinate at certain  times, often after the meals. Another important part of the routines is that the  children are trained to dress themselves. They also are expected to learn to  recognize when they are too warm or too cold, to undress if they are too warm and  put on extra clothes if they are cold. Every child is also expected to learn to take  responsibility for his/her personal rucksacks with extra clothes, sitting cushion and  water bottles. The leaders believe that routines provide children with a feeling of  security, as they always know what is going to happen next. This applies  particularly to the youngest children. The older children, however, sometimes take  excursions to other places, which leads to changes in the routines.    The leaders often described nature as homey and peaceful. One mild day in  November, one of the leaders told me that they had had a nice and “cozy” day in  the forest the day before. They had lunch there and sat around the fire and listened  to a book. When the dusk fell around 3 p.m., they lit lanterns and hung them in  trees so that the children could go on playing.     Connected to the description of nature as homey is the notion that being outdoors  counteracts stress. The Rainbow’s manager feels that the children’s play is more  harmonious when they do not have to compete about toys and that the noise level  is lower than indoors. She also thinks that nature itself has a calming effect. She  describes the feeling of coming to the forest: “So you get out and you sit down out  there—the stress simply drains off you and that has to do with nature ... you sit  there under the oak and you think it’s cozy and nice, the birds warble, maybe a  hare runs by.” One of the leaders expresses herself in a similar way; she says that  nature is “peaceful for the mind” and “provides contemplation.”    To conclude, the base places used by the groups several days a week are used as  homes or preschool premises with “rooms” for different functions like eating,  sleeping and going to the toilet. If the way of using nature described in the previous  section meant that nature is a place in which to learn, then this way means that    </page> <page sequence="14"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 17  nature is a place in which to be. The base places are described as peaceful and  homey places, free from stress. When nature is used as a home or a preschool, it  appears as secure and well organized. At the same time, it is important to manage  and master the difficulties connected to staying outdoors. This is achieved by  wearing the right kinds of clothes so that you do not get cold or wet, by managing  to relieve oneself outdoors, by managing to walk in uneven topography and by  coping with hardships. This mastery creates security and eliminates stress. An  important part of collective mastery is the organization of time and space. The  routines and the spatial structure replace the security and frames provided by the  preschool premises.     Nature as a Fairyland    Along the path leading to the 1- to 3-year-olds’ base place, there is a  “stop place”—a tree where the group always makes a stop. In the tree,  there is a nesting box with a red parrot made from fabric that the leaders  have placed there. One day in December when I follow the children and  their leader to the forest, the children run in advance until they reach the  tree.   Mikael: I want to see the parrot.  The leader gropes in the nesting box, finds the parrot and puts it on her  finger.  Mikael: It was there!  The children are invited to caress the parrot one after another. The leader  tells them to ask if the parrot has something to say. She pretends that it  whispers something in her ear and says that the parrot wants them to  sing. They sing a song about a parrot. The leader says “bye, bye” to the  parrot. The children say “bye, bye” and the leader returns the parrot to  the nesting box.    Figure 4. The parrot in its nesting box        </page> <page sequence="15"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 18  In the episode above, facts are mixed with fantasy. An artifact—a bird  manufactured by the staff—is placed in a “nesting box” set in the tree by the staff  (Figure 4). It looks like a real nesting box but it is not. It has no hole on the front,  instead the leader lifts the roof to open it. Furthermore, the fabric bird represents a  bird, but not one that occurs in the Swedish fauna; rather, it is an exotic bird that  the children probably know about mainly through TV and other media. The children  are excited when they reach the tree. They know that the parrot is there and they  think it is fascinating and fun to look at it and “talk” to it.     This is one of many examples of a pedagogy in which the leaders make up stories  and dramatize and in which nature, in particular the animal world, is charged with  magic. When the 3- to 6-year-olds sit in the log ring, the leaders often tell stories  about animals. They make up their own stories, and they use gestures and  intonation to create excitement. The animals are often given human traits, as in the  example of the parrot. This anthropomorphic and animistic approach occurred often  in my observations, both among children and adults. Animals are called “small  friends” whom one sings to and visits. In the following episode, which takes place in  the 3- to 6-year-olds’ log ring, snails are given human traits.    Several snails are placed on a stone in the middle of the log ring.   Hanna: (to the leader) Sanna, one of the snails is escaping!  Sanna: (with a mysterious voice) No they are saying something!  Sanna bends down and pretends to talk with the snails. She tells the  children that snails can get close to each other and if they like each other  they can talk and then there is a lot of foam. A little while later Sanna  steps on one of the snails by accident. It crunches loudly. Sanna quickly  decides that they have to arrange a funeral. She asks the children how a  funeral is organized. She makes a coffin out of leaves and picks a flower  that she puts on the top. She invites the children to recite a rhyme about  a snail and then she asks the children who are responsible for delivering  the snack this day to serve the “funeral coffee.”    In the example above, Sanna ascribes human traits to the snails when she says  that they talk to and like each other. When she happens to step on a snail, it turns  out to be more dramatic and frightening because of that. Sanna improvises and  quickly finds a solution, using the cultural rituals that are available to handle death.  She invites the children to help her discuss how a funeral is arranged and stages a  ceremony. In this way, the snail is anthropomorphized even more.    Not only animals are used when the leaders tell stories and dramatize. In  Friluftsfrämjandet’s program there are also fairy characters, among them the troll  Mulle. These characters are an important part of the pedagogy. On special  occasions, Mulle or another character, played by an adult in costume, comes to visit  the children. At The Rainbow, there is another character who sometimes comes, the  Red Feather. The story of the Red Feather has been used in the preschool for about  ten years. The inspiration came from a visit to The Ethnographic Museum in  Stockholm, but the leaders have made up their own story. In this story, the Red  Feather, a wise, old Indian woman, rescues a boy. She warns him about a buffalo    </page> <page sequence="16"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 19  flock that comes running against him by shouting “lililili” with a high guttural sound.  This sound is used by the leaders to gather the children. When the call sounds, the  children leave whatever they are doing and hurry to the leader making the sound.  The leaders want to keep the story alive to motivate the children to come when  they call. Sometimes the story about the rescue of the little boy is retold, and it  also happens that the Red Feather comes to visit the children. In the following  episode, puffs of smoke are produced to make the Red Feather come.    One of the leaders makes a fire. One of the children tells me that they  are going to make puffs of smoke “so that the Red Feather can come.”  Leader: Does everybody know what we are going to say to the Red  Feather? (she makes puffs of smoke using a sitting cushion).  The children suggest different things to say to the Red Feather.  Leader: (shouts) Come to us now Red Feather!  She tells the children to watch out for the Red Feather.  Some of the children walk around calling for the Red Feather.  Child: I saw something red there!  Child: Here is another clue. (picks up a candy wrapper)  Child: Another clue. (points at a cigarette butt)  Child: I can smell the Red Feather.  Some pegs are placed on the ground in the shape of an arrow. The  children think it is another clue.  The leader has extinguished the fire and joins the children.  Leader: (points at a footprint on the soil) Here you can see a footprint  from the Red Feather, she has probably walked here.    An important aspect of the enchantment of the forest is the fantasy play. During a  great part of the day, the children are allowed to play freely in the forest. When  new children join the groups in the autumn, the leaders participate in the free play  to mediate play possibilities in the forest.     In the group for the small children, Malin, one of the leaders, takes two of  the new children, Oskar, 11⁄2 years old and Mikael, who is 3, to a pine  whose trunk runs parallel with the ground a bit before it strives upwards.  She says that it is a motorcycle and sits down with the children on it,  pretending to drive away. The next day Mikael wants to go for a ride  again. Malin follows him to the pine.  Malin: Shall we sit down like we did yesterday?  They sit down and Mikael growls.  Malin: Where are we going?  Mikael: To ICA [a food store]. Now we close the doors.   Malin: Are there doors?  Mikael: On the bus ... hello McDonald’s!  Malin: How nice, what do you want? Hamburger and French fries, that’s  what I want, and a Coke.    In this episode, in the interaction between Malin and Mikael, nature is presented as  a place for play just as in the indoor environment at the preschool or the preschool    </page> <page sequence="17"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 20  garden. Malin demonstrates how the pine can represent a motorcycle and Mikael  elaborates on the play when he pretends that it is a bus. In the play, “civilized” life  is integrated into the natural environment—they pretend to take the bus to a food  store and McDonald’s.    To conclude, nature is presented as a fairy world where animals have human traits  and where magical things can happen. The approach is connected to traditional  preschool pedagogy which includes fairy stories, songs and fantasy play as  important parts.  It is connected as well to Friluftfrämjandet’s tradition of  populating nature with imaginary characters. The stories, songs and imaginary  characters help the children create a relationship to nature. They make the forest  more exciting and interesting to the children and provide them with symbols they  can use in their play.     Concluding Discussion  As shown above, several different ways of using nature can be discerned in the  preschool I have studied. Besides the predominant ways of relating to nature I  describe above, there are others as well; for example, nature is presented as a  place that should be protected and cared for, and as a site for wildlife.6 Nature is  thus presented in many, partly contradictory, ways. One could say that the school  leaders have a multidimensional conception of nature. This complexity is in line with  the fact that the concept of nature is an important symbol in Scandinavia. The  concept absorbs meaning from different contexts and in that way covers a wide  range of meanings. It is included in several binary oppositions, where both sides  are present, often so that one of them predominates while the other one is implicit  (Gullestad 1992).    When nature is used as a classroom, the notion of nature as scientific has been  foregrounded. Through the centuries, since the days of Aristotle (382-322 BC),  many philosophers, psychologists and pedagogues have stressed that knowledge is  gained empirically, through sensory exploration. Jean Jacques Rousseau and  Friedrich Fröbel, mentioned above, have both had a great impact on the Swedish  preschool. Another protagonist is John Dewey, who considered that one of the  problems with schools was that school education did not start from natural contexts  but was fragmentary and artificial, with the result being that children did not learn  how to understand whole processes (1990). An important advantage of outdoor  education, according to Lars Owe Dahlgren (2007), is that the outdoor space, as  opposed to the classroom, is an authentic environment. The outdoor environment  provides experience-based learning (Szczepanski 2007). The experiences inspire  the children to ask questions, questions that are not forced upon them from above  and that create good conditions for learning. The teacher can take responsibility for  the questions and together with the children try to answer them. In that way, the  children can gain knowledge about processes that create good conditions for a  deeper form of learning (Dahlgren 2007). According to this line of reasoning about  nature as a context for learning processes, there is an opposition between “natural”                                                    6 In her study of a Norwegian nature-oriented childcare center, Nilsen (2006) found these  two areas, together with the fauna, to be central.     </page> <page sequence="18"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 21  and “artificial” (Gullestad 1992), where nature is seen as a genuine and authentic  context, while the classroom is seen as artificial and unnatural.     When used as a home, nature is involved in two different oppositions: between  nature and city, and between nature and home. When nature is used as a home (or  a preschool), where one eats, sleeps, goes to the toilet, plays and socializes, it  appears as an orderly place. Nature represents the opposite of the city, which is  (implicitly) understood as dangerous, chaotic and stressful. The opposition to the  city is underlined by the fact that the children mainly play with natural materials.  Grahn and colleagues have investigated the importance of nature to people of  different ages in Sweden (Grahn 1991; 1992; Grahn et al. 1997). Grahn (1992)  states that staying in natural environments counteracts stress and provides  possibilities for recreation in an everyday life filled with artifacts and stress. He  refers to the Kaplans’ research about nature as a resource for recovery. In natural  environments, as opposed to urban environments, people do not have to make  efforts to block unnecessary information such as advertisements, noise and  unknown persons (Kaplan and Kaplan 1989). Nature provides opportunities for  spontaneous attention at the same time that thoughts can wander freely.  Frustration is less common in natural environments than it is elsewhere (Kaplan  1990).    In the opposition between nature and home, nature is understood as wild and  unbroken, in contrast to the well-organized, safe and cozy quality of the home. The  wild and unpredictable side of nature is made homelike and safe by mastering the  difficulties associated with being outdoors. This is reflected in the name of the  organization—”I Ur och Skur” means approximately “in all kinds of weather.”  Routines are created to replace the safety provided by the walls of the preschool,  and the children are trained to adapt to the wild character of nature. They are  taught to dress themselves from an early age and to observe their own bodies to  handle cold and warmth. They are also encouraged to develop their motor skills,  move well through hilly terrain and become strong and brave. Nilsen (2008)  describes similar findings from her study of a Norwegian child care center. She  shows how the pedagogy in the studied center constructs a robust child who can  cope with hardships and take responsibility for his/her own well-being. Thus, in the  use of nature as a home, we find a duality. On the one hand, nature is constructed  as safe, cozy and welcoming; on the other, as something that one must master.  This contradiction is similarly found in people who practice outdoor activities.  Nature is understood as cosmos, a place for contemplation—but it is also  comprehended as chaos, which has to be mastered.    The third presentation of nature as an enchanted world can also be tied to the  opposition between home and nature. The wild and chaotic side of nature is used to  construct nature as an exciting and unpredictable place where anything can  happen, a place with space for the imagination and excitement. Nature as an  enchanted world is tied to the traditional culture for children. Fairy tales often take  place in forests, and the animals and elements of the forest are given symbolic  meanings (see, e.g., Bettelheim 1976). Throughout European history, the forest  has been animated and populated with different kinds of creatures (Ekman 2007).    </page> <page sequence="19"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 22    These different ways of talking about and using nature are partly contradictory. For  example, the scientific use of nature as a classroom and the practice of animating  nature and giving animals human traits can be understood as incompatible. In  practice, however, this contradiction seems unproblematic. The multidimensional  character of the concept of nature is essential in enabling different ways of talking  about and using nature to exist side by side. All three approaches address the aims  and intentions of the curriculum for the Swedish preschool. For example, as  mentioned in the introduction, one of the aims stated in the school’s curriculum is  that children are to gain knowledge about nature’s recycling process and about  plants and animals. Furthermore, the curriculum states that care, nurturing and  learning should be seen as a coherent whole and that preschools shall provide a  “well-balanced daily rhythm” in which care is balanced with other activities  (Swedish National Agency for Education, 2006, 7). This is achieved at The Rainbow  through the homelike use of nature, where priority is given to care routines. The  curriculum also states that the preschool shall develop children’s cultural creativity  as well as pass on a cultural heritage from one generation to the next. This is  achieved at The Rainbow when nature is presented as an enchanted world.     A further factor that allows nature to be constructed in contradictory ways is that  the different uses of nature are partly separated in time and space. Through the  lived life in the studied preschool, different places are given different meanings.  These meanings can vary during the day. The base places, for example, are used as  playrooms during some parts of the day and as places for care and rest during  others. Through organization in time and space, an immanent pedagogy is created  (Ennew 1994; Markström 2005). The use of nature as a classroom is mostly  connected to the places used for the forest school groups and the excursions. The  homelike ways of using nature are linked to the base places and the routines for  gatherings, meals, rests and general corporal care. The enchanted presentation of  nature is also mostly connected to the base place, to the children’s play and the  staff’s stories and dramatizations. Fantasy elements occur in the forest schools as  well, for example when Mulle comes to visit the children.    One interesting point is that the 3- to 6-year-olds’ base place is a grove of trees  that is visible from the preschool’s windows. It would hardly be called a forest by an  outsider, but the leaders talk about it as “the forest”—as opposed to just the  preschool yard. The present presentation of the forest is interesting to compare to  that observed in Nilsen’s (2008) study. At The Rainbow, the forest is talked of as a  safe and secure place that the group returns to on a daily basis, living their life  there as residents. The place has been claimed by building the log ring on it. In the  Norwegian day care center, the forest is seen as something far away from human  settlement, with a character of being wild and untouched. The children and their  teachers appear as nomads. They leave the day care center every day on skis or on  foot, and they visit several different places in the forest.     Something that permeates all three ways of presenting and using nature in the  Swedish preschool described here is a wish to create a feeling for nature in  children. Such a feeling is thought to emerge in the nature classroom when the    </page> <page sequence="20"> Making Use of ”Nature” in an Outdoor Preschool: Classroom, Home and Fairyland 23  children use their senses to explore elements of nature and learn about flora and  fauna. When the children learn the names of plants and animals, these things  become visible to them, and a world that earlier was invisible and undifferentiated  becomes accessible. When children learn about what grows and lives in the forest,  and when they learn to understand nature’s recycling process, the conditions  needed for them to acquire a feeling for their environment are established. Further,  there is a notion that the children will experience a feeling of wholeness and  harmony through sensory experiences in natural environments—like feeling the  wind and the warmth of the sun on their skin and listening to the wind in the trees  and the warble of the birds. These experiences are connected to the homelike use  of nature as a peaceful place to be. Finally, a special feeling for nature is achieved  through enchantment. Through the leaders’ stories and the children’s play, nature  is presented as a fascinating place with many opportunities for fun and adventure.       Eva Änggård, Ph.D., is senior lecturer at Stockholm University, Department of  Didactic Science and Early Childhood Education (DoPA). Her field of research  includes meaning-making processes in early childhood settings. In her dissertation  study, children’s art activities were analyzed as a part of their peer cultures. In the  current nature and outdoor project other articles deal with children’s play activities  in natural environments.      References    Bettelheim, Bruno (1976).
