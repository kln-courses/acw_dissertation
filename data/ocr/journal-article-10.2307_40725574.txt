<plain_text><page sequence="1">POSTWAR JAPANESE STUDIES ON CHINESE PAINTING AND SCULPTURE Harrie Vanderstappen and Watanabe Keiko 8£ Ä Jg ^ The following list contains postwar Japanese studies on Chinese painting and sculpture which may be of interest to west- ern scholars and students. News items and writings of popular interest only have not been included. Major work on Buddhist sculpture and wall paintings has been done by Mizuno Seiichi and Nagahiro Toshio, both of the Research Institute of Humanistic Sciences, Kyoto. Among the works on Tun-huang those of Matsumoto Eiichi are outstanding. Except for the scholarly articles by Shimada Shüjiro and a few others who did work on Sung and Yuan paintings the interest in Chinese painting is concentrated on the Ming and Ch'ing dynasties. In this last field a large number of good contribu- tions have been made by Yonezawa Yoshiho, Tõyõ Bunka, Tokyo. The journals Bijutsu kenkyü, Bijutsushi and Kokka have English summaries. Readers not familiar with Japanese should refer to these summaries since duplication in English has been avoided as much as possible. Some other magazines have an index of titles in English. Exhaustive lists of publications on Chinese art may be found in Tõyõshi kenkyü bunkeri ruimoku j|C#iiîW:^3£jÎK2ïî @ (An- nual Bibliography of Oriental Studies), Research Institute of Humanistic Sciences, Kyoto ; Tõyõ kobijutsu bunken mokuroku ^ ^■fiüífi^ifcSifc (A list of studies on Oriental art) , and Nihon bijutsu nenkan B íiií^ (Japanese art yearbook) , both compiled at the Bijutsu Kenkyüjo ü*W5S0f (Art Re- search Institute) , Tokyo. Short surveys and critical commentaries occur occasionally in Sekai bijutsu zenshü geppõ flt Ur H '$$ {£ |g ñ SI (World art monthly); Heibonsha, Tokyo. The authors express their thanks to Prof. Yonezawa who kindly read the manuscript and gave valuable advice. 419</page><page sequence="2">420 HARRIE VANDERSTAPPEN AND WATANABE KEIKO I.
