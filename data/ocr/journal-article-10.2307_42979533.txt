<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER 7 Ecological Relations Historically, mans can be from traced Eurowesterners nature. back to The ancient dualisms have Greece embraced of mind/matter, and Plato's an ontology ontological man/nature, that separates categories soul/body hu- of Historically, mans from nature. The dualisms of mind/matter, man/nature, soul/body can be traced back to ancient Greece and Plato's ontological categories of the Forms. For Plato (Meno, 1970; Republic, 1979), our soul is not of this material world and therefore mortal, as our body is, but instead our soul is immortal and one with the Forms. The Forms are the material world Idealized and made Transcen- dent. The material world of nature which our body inhabits is a world that is tempo- rary and particular, a world that distracts us and deceives us. Since our soul is im- mortal and has experienced all, it knows all Truth. We are able to tune in to what our immortal soul already knows by separating our mind from our body, from matter, from nature, and using our mind to recollect the Truth we already know. The ancient Greek anthropocentric dualisms are reinforced by the religious views of the Judeo-Christians. From a Judeo-Christian perspective, God created the world, and placed humans in the world as his descendents, with nature there to serve humans. Humans are commanded to subdue nature and multiply themselves. There is a strict ontological hierarchy with God in the transcendent role, humans following, and nature following humans. Christianity is based on the belief that the end of history is coming, and then humans will leave Earth, which is an evil place of pain and suffering, for Heaven, which is a glorious place of only goodness (Deloria, Jr., 1995). Since the Age of Enlightenment and the dawning of the Scientific Revo- lution, philosophers and scientists in the 16th to 17th centuries further codified the ancient Greek anthropocentric dualisms by defining nature like a machine, a system of dead, inert particles moved by external forces, which needs to be con- trolled and shaped for the benefit of human beings (Merchant, 1980). Thus, histor- ically we find that in Euro-western philosophy, religion, and science 'nature' is placed in an "Other" category, in contrast and opposition to humans. Buddhists and Native Americans have never embraced such views about nature. For them, the world in which we live is alive and intimately connected to us. Bud- dhists believe that people and nature are mutually dependent on each other and</page><page sequence="2">184 Relational "(e)pistemologies" equally valued, and so it is vital that we care for all of life's forms; doing so is how we care for ourselves. Native Americans say the planet is our mother, Grandmother Earth, and she "is physical and therefore a spiritual, mental, and emotional being. Planets are alive, as are all their by-products or expressions, such as animals, vegeta- bles, minerals, climatic and meteorological phenomena" (Allen, 1990, p. 52, em- phasis in original). We gain knowledge and understanding of this world by partici- pating in events, and observing all of nature around us, the birds, animals, rivers, and mountains (Deloria, Jr., 1995, p. 56). Native Americans consider themselves, still today, part of the Sacred Hoop of nature, of the same value as other living things, not of higher status and worth, as Euro- western Judeo-Christians seem to be- lieve (Allen, 1986). There are several different theoretical perspectives offered as to why the split between humans and nature exists in the Euro-western world and various recom- mendations are offered concerning what we need to do to heal this split. Much evi- dence is offered from a variety of theorists and activists to demonstrate the destruc- tive results this split continues to cause today: depletion and erosion of soil; air pollution, ozone depletion, and the resulting greenhouse effect; water pollution and acid rain; human overpopulation and starvation and disease; the extinction of one fourth of the earth's species of plants, animals, microbes, and fungi; the cutting down of the Rain Forests, causing loss of homeland, more extinction, and loss of oxygen. Buddhism blames the split between humans and nature on false illusions we create and learn through our social cultures that we must unlearn. We create the ap- pearance of a self that is separate from others and we must empty ourselves of that delusion so that we can be aware of the Truth that all things, including ourselves, are interdependent and exist in relation with each other. Environmental philoso- phers point to Judeo-Christianity, rationalism, mechanistic science and technology, colonialism, and capitalism for causing the split between humans and nature (Cal- licott &amp; Ames, 1989). Euro- western ecofeminists blame the split on patriarchy, making it clear that man has always been placed higher on the hierarchy than woman, with woman identified with nature (Daly, 1978/1990; King, 1990; Mer- chant, 1980; Warren, 1990). Native Americans point to the same culprits that en- vironmental philosophers and ecofeminists point to (Allen, 1986; Deloria, Jr. 1995). Allen (1990) suggests our planet is entering upon a great initiation, a passage where she is becoming someone else, she has gone coyote, hey oka. "She is giving birth to her new consciousness of herself and her relationship to the other vast in- telligences, other holy beings in her universe" (p. 54). This chapter will explore some key ecological theories offered in efforts to heal the Euro-western split between nature, man, and woman. I am arguing that a rela- tional (e)pistemology, supported by a relational ontology, must include an emphasis on ecological relations for the natural world is a world in which human beings are intimately connected. Again, I must be very selective about which theories I choose</page><page sequence="3">Ecological Relations 185 to discuss, due to limitations of space and time, but I hope that my exploration will cause the reader to want to seek others' views as well. I have narrowed my focus sharply by choosing to discuss only one or two representatives of the major positions presented so that I can consider their work in more depth. What I offer just begins to scratch the surface in ecological relational approaches, a fact I find very exciting and heartening. While the field of ecological philosophy is relatively new (since the early 1970^), natural relational approaches to knowing date back to the beginning of time. Indigenous people have persevered a vital storehouse of environmental wis- dom based on over 40,000 years of continual relationships with special environ' ments (Cajete, 1994). As a result of recent efforts to record this knowing in printed form, there is a wealth of text available for reading. I have divided this chapter into two basic sections: one considers the human/ nonhuman nature split mainly from a metaphysical angle, and the second section looks at the human/ nonhuman split more with a focus of power issues, introducing patriarchy into discussions of domination over nature. The first section will con- tinue the discussion introduced in Chapter 6 of Buddhist and Native American spiritual beliefs concerning nature, as well as present Arne Naess's deep ecology view. Environmental philosophers, ecological feminists, and social ecologists will serve as critics of these views. The second section will present the ecofeminist per- spectives of Mary Daly, Carol Merchant, Ynestra King, and Karen Warren, with various feminists serving as critics of these views. In this way a dialogue should emerge, and from this dialogue we should be able to discover tensions as well as key themes and central ideas held in common that will help us further develop a rela- tional (e)pistemology. Ecological theories seek to describe humanity and nature in an inclusive, biolog- ical manner as biocentrically connected. They emphasize principles of w/holistic unity and systematic integration, internalistic life-movements, and organic bal- ance. Ecological theories serve as another example of an ontological and (e)pistem- ological shift away from metaphysical dualisms and absolutism, toward a transac- tional model of organism-environment. The shift is away from a model emphasizing rationality and quantitative calculations toward a model that is more reflective of concrete experiences of life in their fullest dimensions. As theories, ecology breaks the artificial boundaries of philosophy, religion, and science, offering examples of w/holistic theories based on a relational ontology and (e)pistemology. We will find in Chapter 8 that there are examples of current Euro-western scientists in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, and geology making similar shifts away from meta- physical dualisms and absolutism, toward a relational ontology and (e)pistemology. General systems theory, quantum mechanics, and cybernetics are based on a mutual causality similar to classic pragmatism, Buddhism, Native American, and ecofemin- ist philosophy, with their emphases on transactional relationships, change and pro- cess, complexity, contextuality, and interconnectedness.</page><page sequence="4">1 86 Relational "(e)pistemologies" Human/ nonhuman Nature Environmental philosophy began in the early 1970^, as a product of the 1960^, ac- cording to Callicott and Ames (1989). From its beginning, Euro- western environ- mental philosophers have assumed that we can find ecological wisdom in the East, as well as among Indigenous cultures such as the Native Americans, The assump- tion is that while the Asian or Indigenous cultures cannot offer us better scientific understanding of nature, they can offer us different ontological perspectives- Study- ing these alternative philosophies will provide an outsider standpoint, which will help Euro-westerners be better able to critique themselves as they become more aware of their own deep-level, background assumptions. These alternative cultures can offer Euro-westerners new metaphors that will help us imagine new ways of ar- ticulating our world. They can help us reach the goals of cultural redirection and environmental rehabilitation (Callicot and Ames, 1989). At the same time that Euro-western environmental philosophers have pointed to the values of studying Native American and Asian philosophy for their environ- mental wisdom, Euro-western authors have pointed to ecologically destructive practices in these same cultures. Based on fossil evidence that predates European contact on the North/South American continent, Native Americans are accused of hastening the extinction of animals such as the buffalo by driving herds of buffalo off cliffs (Callicot and Ames, 1989). The East is accused of mass slaughtering of an- imals such as whales, severely polluting their water, ruthlessly exploiting the rain forests of southeast Asia, gross overpopulation, and massive soil erosion. It is argued that there are glaring inconsistencies that exist between professed ideals and actual practice (Callicot and Ames, 1989). In defense of Native American practice, we will find below that Vine Deloria, Jr. (1995) questions the fossil dating techniques of Euro-western scientists and other methodologies used to establish the Pleisto- cene overkill theory. Deloria, Jr. effectively calls into question this theory, and oth- ers, based on flawed evidence. As for much of the evidence currently held against sound Asian ecological practices, many of these practices can be shown to be a di- rect result of Euro-western imperialism and industrialization. Tragically, the current trend in Asian countries is to adopt Euro-western practices, which are perceived to offer great technological advances that will make life easier and more comfortable, as Euro-westerners are now beginning to realize the threat technology creates for our natural environment (Callicot and Ames, 1989). Given the supposition that Asian philosophies can offer the Euro-west an eco- logical wisdom, it is surprising to discover that Asian philosophers have not partici- pated much in conversations with Euro-western philosophers on this topic. That is, it is surprising until we uncover Euro-western philosophical biases that have pre- cluded such serious philosophical discussions. Euro-western philosophers histori- cally have defined philosophy in terms of certainty, objectivity, rationality, and</page><page sequence="5">Ecological Relations 187 logic, and then used that definition to exclude the East from philosophical discus- sions due to its not meeting the West's criteria. The East has been judged by the West to not have any strong philosophical positions, and the East's views have in- stead been classified as religious. However, recent developments in Euro-western philosophy by pragmatists, feminists, and postmodernists have caused the Euro-west to abandon certainty, objectivity, dualism, and determinism. Now Eastern views, which represent worldviews that are nondualistic, w/holistic, relational, and or- ganic, can meet the new criteria and have risen in status. Still, most of the Euro-western philosophical conversations about Eastern phi- losophies have taken place by Euro-westerners who study Eastern philosophies as outsiders. Even in a text such as Nature in AsianTraditions of Thought: Essays in Envi- ronmental Philosophy (Callicott and Ames, 1989), which had the explicit aim of en- couraging more conversation between the East and the West, Asians are conspicu- ously missing, representing a small minority of the authors included in the anthology. Within many of the essays included, it is still difficult to find serious pres- entations of Asian views; what are most often presented are in-depth discussions of Euro-western philosophical influences, in contrast to Eastern ones. And nature, which is suppose to be the main topic of the entire text, is barely included in many of the essays, often finally appearing in the concluding remarks of the authors, as an afterthought. Unfortunately, this text represents the rationalistic Euro-western cri- teria its authors and editors are critically aware of and yet still model in their own practice. At this point I would like to explore the Euro-western supposition that Asian philosophies can offer the Euro-west an ecological wisdom by taking another look at the Mahäyanä Buddhism we considered at some depth in Chapter 6. It is impor- tant to remind the reader that Eastern philosophies are complex and diverse and cannot be reduced to one view. There is no one "Eastern" view - there are many - each representing unique perspectives with significant histories and intricate devel- opments. In Chapter 6 several key ideas of the Buddhist doctrine were presented, the dharmas of dependent co-origination, emptiness, egolessness of self, and com- passion. These fundamental beliefs are central to understanding Buddhism's ecolog- ical philosophy. Recall that the dharma of dependent co-origination, or co-arising, is a metaphysi- cal position that subverts the concept of ontologically independent entities . Bud- dhists claim that all beings are mutually dependent and interconnected. While it is possible to maintain distinctions and differences among different forms of nature, de- pendent co-origination reminds us how porous and fluid these distinctions really are. Nature is perceived w/holistically as a structured, differentiated whole. Dependent co-origination also subverts the idea of individual life forms having higher or lower status, thus undermining a hierarchical approach to nature. In believing that all life forms are interconnected and mutually dependent, Buddhism helps us understand</page><page sequence="6">1 88 Relational "(e)pistemologies" that all life forms are interrelated. All life forms participate equally in a dynamic cosmos. This means that all life forms have intrinsic value and they all affect each other. Buddhists do not place different forms of nature, e.g. plants, animals, human beings, on a hierarchical scale and rate them according to varying importance, worth, or value. Humans are not ontologically privileged. To a Buddhist, that kind of thinking is dangerously deceptive and arrogant. All life in all its forms are valu- able and important; all of the natural world has intrinsic value. This philosophy maintains an ecocentric view of nature rather than an anthropocentric one. As Francis Cook (1989) points out, if we compare historically the art in our museums, we find the European art reveals a strong anthropocentric bias, for the subject of its art is people, represented mainly by portraits. Nature serves as an unobtrusive back- drop for the human foreground. However, the main subject of Asian art is land- scapes, with people represented in the visual display, but barely visible in scale to the land. "Nature here is not a background for man; man and nature are blended to- gether harmoniously" (p. 218). In Chapter 6 we learned that emptiness and dependent co-origination are one and the same concept for Buddhists. The dharma of emptiness teaches us that our original mind is empty of false illusions of separate entities and full of limitless possibilities. Our original mind understands that things exist only interdepen- dent^, thus again undermining the concept of separate entities, including the concept of a separate self. The concept of mutual dependence applies to all phe- nomena. Our self, as a separate entity, is only an illusion. Buddhists embrace a process concept of self, which they describe as 'no self' (anatman). We are imper- manent and nonsubstantial, lacking any self-essence. We are in process, in a state of becoming, always in flux. The term 'self' signifies a relation. The dharma of emptiness helps us understand that if we empty our minds of the false illusions we have built up, we will be able to see nature as undistorted, and understand that we are nature. For the Mahäyanä Buddhist, the way we destroy the illusion of a self is not by ex- tinction of all desire, but rather by reorientation. We overcome our greedy desires to contain and control nature by changing greedy desires to altruistic desires to help us fully participate with nature. We develop our compassion and love, our total open- ness. We relate to nature with care, and develop a deep emotional affinity with na- ture. We listen and attend to nature, and begin to establish communication. We begin to understand that nature is not dead at all, but is most vital and alive. We re- alize that nature is endowed with divine presence, and that while we, as sentient be- ings, must seek Buddhahood, nonsentient beings already have Buddhahood. We cultivate an intimate relation with nature that is mutually interpenetrating, an intersubjective experience, an authentic experience of nature, an "awareness un- tainted by the habits of conceptualization" (Shaner, 1989, p. 171). We overcome our sense of separation from the world. "The epistemic mode of experience to be</page><page sequence="7">Ecological Relations 189 cultivated is therefore a dynamic process; it is primarily an attitude, a becoming that occasions an intimacy with the whole of dynamic nature" (Shaner, 1989, p. 168). Mahäyanä Buddhists strongly emphasize nonviolence, and nonexploitation of the natural world in their ecocentric philosophy. They experience profound feelings of gratitude and respect for all of life. There is much they can teach us about how to live in peace with each other, including our natural surroundings. The Euro-western supposition that Asian philosophies can offer the Euro-west an ecological wisdom is sound, and we will find their influence in the deep ecology movement described below. This is not to say that Mahäyanä Buddhists have been able to avoid the en- vironmental disasters the Euro-west has embraced. However, their ecological view that all things live in interdependence and are interrelated offers important insight and hope for all of us. This view emphasizes the intrinsic value of all phenomena. Cook (1989) refers us to the metaphor of "the jewel net of Indra" to help us understand. Imagine an infinite net that is stretched over the entire world. At each eye of the net there is a single glittering jewel, and since the net is infinite, there are an infinite number of jewels. When we look at one jewel, we discover that all the other jewels are reflected in that one jewel, and this is true for each individual jewel, "so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring." This image "symbolizes a cosmos in which there is an infinitely repeated interrelationship among all the members of the cosmos" (Cook, 1989, p. 214). The jewels represent simultaneous relationships of mutual identity and mutual intercausality. For Buddhists, the cos- mos is a nonteleological, self-creating, self-maintaining, and self-defining organism. It is a universe in which everything counts, and we all share our destinies. I move on to consider the deep ecology movement. We will not be leaving Bud- dhism completely behind though, for Buddhism has influenced various people in- volved in the ecological movement, in particular the view I wish to explore here of Arne Naess. Naess does not often directly cite Buddhism as a source for his ideas, but he is influenced by Spinoza and Gandhi, and thus we can trace his Buddhist in- fluence through them. Naess is a Norwegian philosopher, who is credited with introducing the term 'deep ecology' into ecological discussions in 1973 in an article titled "The shallow and the deep, long-range ecology movements." Naess worked for over thirty years as a professor in philosophy, contributing to work in semantics, philosophy of science, and analysis of the philosophy of Spinoza and Gandhi. He re- signed his academic position in 1969 in order to become a social activist in the eco- logical movement, believing philosophy can help guide our actions as we seek to heal the split between humanity and nature. In 1976 Naess published a book, 0kologi, samfunn , og livsstil, which was not published in English until 1989, as Ecol- ogy, community and lifestyle -1 He has also published several articles (1984, 1985, 1986). As he is considered an important thinker in the deep ecology tradition, I turn to his work to help us understand what has become a movement in the last 20- 25 years.</page><page sequence="8">190 Relational "(e)pistemologies" Naess (1986) describes deep ecology as a religion and a philosophy, and he sug- gests that deep ecologists come from various religious backgrounds, including Chris- tian, Buddhist, and Taoist. Naess (1985) uses the term 'deep' "to suggest explication of fundamental presuppositions of valuation as well as of facts and hypotheses" (p. 256). He wants us to question the foundational normative and descriptive prem- ises of ecological philosophy. Naess suggests that the way to heal the split between humanity and nature is by changing our consciousness through an inward transfor- mation. He offers a new ontology that posits humanity as inseparable from nature. The methodology he relies on to help him develop this new ontology is phenome- nology, using his intuition to develop his concept of Self-realization (Naess's spelling). Naess suggests the term 'ecosophy' to describe philosophy inspired by the deep ecology movement that is a synthesis of theory and practice. He prefers to refer to ecological philosophy as an ecological movement, to highlight the fact that art- ists and poets are contributing to this movement, not just philosophers, and to em- phasize the important of social action, not just philosophical theory development, in order to help us change our conditions. Naess describes his own particular philo- sophy in regards to ecology and philosophy as 'Ecosophy T.' He does this to suggest that his is not the only one; there are many others, A, B, C, etc. For deep ecologists, the argument that we should take care of the Earth so hu- mans can survive is a weak argument. The stronger argument is to insist that all non-human life on Earth has intrinsic worth, just as human beings do. Naess rejects a view of man-in-environment in favor of a relational, total-field image that empha- sizes biospherical egalitarianism in principle. In "A defense of the deep ecology movement," Naess (Fall 1984) described the basic tenets of the deep ecology move- ment, which he says he developed with the help of George Sessions. In 1985 he fur- ther adjusted these tenets, and in his 1989 book publication they are further altered to the following: ( i ) The flourishing of human non-human life on Earth has intrinsic value. The value of non-human life forms is independent of the usefulness these may have for narrow human purposes. (2) Richness and diversity of life forms are values in them- selves and contribute to the flourishing of human and non-human life on Earth. (3) Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital needs. (4) Present human interference with the non-human world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening. (5) The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease of the human population. The flourishing of non-human life requires such a decrease. (6) Significant change of life conditions for the better requires change in policies. These affect basic economic, technologi- cal, and ideological structures. (7) The ideological change is mainly that of appre- ciating life quality (dwelling in situations of intrinsic value) rather than adhering to a high standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference</page><page sequence="9">Ecological Relations 191 between big and great. (8) Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an ob- ligation directly or indirectly to participate in the attempt to implement the neces- sary changes, (p. 29, emphasis in original) In his various discussions of these tenets, we find that Naess (1989) realizes there are vague terms such as "vital needs" within the tenets that need further clarifica- tion, but he purposely uses these terms to encourage us to engage in conversations concerning the concepts and "to allow for considerable latitude in judgment" (p. 30). His hope is that these conversations will point us to the metaphysical as- sumptions on which our different world views are based. Naess (1989) does not do more than sketch his own Ecosophy T in Ecology, community , and lifestyle for the same reason. His aim in the text is to encourage his readers to clarify their own views. Consequently, Murray Bookchin's (1988) criticism of Naess's theory for being vague is a fair criticism, but it mainly points to the differences in their two philosophical positions. Naess's (1989) position is that completeness is impossible, and even meaningless while Bookchin, as a social ecologist, counts on the human species evolving reasoning ability to give humans the clarity of understanding nec- essary to intervene and change nature, by way of society. Naess's (1989) Ecosophy T begins with a basic axiom or postulate he describes as "Self-realization!" (Ni). He uses explanation points with his normative statements to emphasis that these are calls to action. Self-realization is a concept that Naess employs to try to connect unity with diversity, individuality with the whole. Self- realization is the universal right to self-unfolding, to live and blossom. Naess does not mean self-realization in terms of just individual human self development, as the classical liberalists use the term. He calls this the narrow self, the ego. Self- realization is the realization of the comprehensive Self, not the cultivation of the ego. Yet, Naess does mean individual self-development in a classical liberal sense of self-sufficiency, self-determination, autonomy; he just wants to expand this concept so that it includes other forms of nature, not just human beings. Apparently, the ex- panded Self is a gender-neutral concept of self (Kheel, 1990), although Naess does not specifically address women in his text at all. For Naess, plants and animals have the right to self-unfolding too. This is why Naess uses the capital S in Self- realization, to emphasize a large concept of Self which includes all of nature. While he includes all of nature in his concept of Self-realization, and he wants to empha- size we are part of the ecosphere as much as we are part of society, he does not want to dissolve the individual self either. Naess points toward the East and their mysti- cism, but moves in the end to reinstating the central position of the existential in- dividual, for fear of determinism. There is a tension in Naess's (1989) philosophy between wholism and existential- ism. Naess means Self-realization is a process, a way to live one's life. He talks about</page><page sequence="10">1 92 Relational "(e)pistemologies" identification with greater wholes and the need for us to more toward I/Thou rela- tionships. However, he does not recognize, as Buber (1923, 1937, 1958) suggests, that we begin our lives in I/Thou relationships that become I/It. Naess (1989) de- scribes individual selves in terms of diversity, and as intimately interconnected. He uses a both/ and logic, refering to this as a gestalt understanding of the piece as a whole , with whole and part internally related (p. 57, emphasis in original). He in- sists there are no completely separate objects, just objects in relation with each other (similar to Buddhism's dependent co-origination, or co-arising). However, while he refers to the Buddhist concept of no-self (anatman), he does not com- pletely embrace anatman in his own philosophy, for he wants to maintain a separ- ate, individual self while we already know that Buddhists argue such a concept is an illusion we socially construct to ward off our fears of the absence of self. Naess (1989) includes the norms of self-sufficiency, decentralisation, and auton- omy as his second-level principles in his Ecosophy T (N6-8), thus further revealing his leanings toward classical liberal norms which undermine his wholism. Deep ecology seems to represent an expanded self that is an enlargement and an exten- sion of egoism. The assumption still seems to be that human nature is egoistic and that the alternative to egoism is self-sacrifice (Plumwood, 1991). Buddhists argue that self-sufficiency and autonomy are illusions we create which cause us a great deal of suffering. The concept of autonomy depends on the belief that the self is a continuous, independent subject. For Buddhists, the 'self' represents a relation, not a solid entity, and all phenomena, including the self, are impermanent and con- stantly changing. The 'self ' comes in and out of being as a consequence of mutual dependence. Naess recognizes this mutual dependence when he says that complete Self-realization requires the realization of all (similar to the Buddhist idea of all at- taining Buddhahood). However, for Naess (1989) the realization of all is never reached but is an Ideal worth striving for. Self-realization is a kind of perfection. It is a process as well as an ultimate goal. "The term includes personal and community self-realization, but is conceived also to refer to an unfolding of reality as a totality" (p. 84). Naess wants to embrace a concept of self that includes others, but his con- cept of separate self hinders the relational approach he seeks to take. Naess's (1989) underlying illusion of separate selves undermines his response to the human/nature divide as well. He wants to dissolve the split between humans and nature. He argues for an egalitarian position that does not set human beings apart from nature and higher in value than nature. He describes all of nature as hav- ing intrinsic worth, including all living species. He opposes the historical Euro- western tendency to place humans at the center of the moral universe (to be anthropocentric), and to assume that nonhuman nature has no value in itself. He wants humanity to be for nature instead of against it, to care for it and nurture it, mainly by leaving it alone as much as possible. Naess argues for self-realization for all living beings, and for the importance of making room for nature to diversify and</page><page sequence="11">Ecological Relations 193 develop in complexity, in order to continue the evolutionary process (N2-4). Di- versity and complexity are necessary to increase Self-realization potentials. For Naess (1989), making room for nature to diversify and develop in complex- ity means allowing for large, open spaces of land that have no human contact. The state of nature is one that is undisturbed by human beings. Thus, we discover that Naess still maintains a split between humans/nature, for he assumes a state of nature is one that does not include human beings. He describes humans as against nature, rather than as part of nature. As Watson (1983) explains: if we view the state of nature or Nature as being natural, undisturbed, and unper- turbed only when human beings are not present, or only when human beings are curbing their natural behavior, then we are assuming that human beings are apart from, separate from, different from, removed from, or above nature, (p. 252, empha- sis in original) Deep ecology is based on a position that sets humans apart from nature, even though deep ecologists' most fundamental position is their opposition to the histor- ical Euro-western propensity to place humans at the center of the moral universe (to be anthropocentric). What deep ecologists accomplish is the abstract negation of the original dualism between man/nature (King, 1991) and nature/culture (King, 1987, Warren, 1990). Naess's (1989) Ecosophy T assumes the importance of: no exploitation, no sub- jugation, equal rights, no class societies, and self-determination (N9-13). He is op- posed to a hierarchical view in regards to humanity and nature. He wants us to iden- tify with our ecosystem and other species by widening our concept of the self. Strong identification with the whole of nature in its diversity and interdependence of parts is what will motivate us to actively participate in the deep ecological move- ment. Naess wants us to recognize that our ecosystem and other species have their own intrinsic value independent of our valuation. Identification with nature is a source of belief in intrinsic values. How do we widen identifications? By widening our perspectives, deepening our experiences, and reaching higher levels of active- ness (Naess references Spinoza's "self-preservation" concept, p. 85). Increase of identification will help us achieve what moralizing cannot, beautiful actions that are the result of "acting more consistently from oneself as a whole" (Naess references Kant's "beautiful actions," p. 86, emphasis in original). Unfortunately, Naess's altru- ism calls for an impersonal love of the cosmos. Plumwood ( 1991 ) criticizes his wide identification for beings as indiscriminate and intent on denying particular mean- ings. This kind of love is very different from the love of their land that Indigenous people express, which is very specific and local, as we will discover below. Others worry that deep ecology's description relies too much on logic and language, causing nature to become a disconnected abstraction (Cheney, 1987).</page><page sequence="12">194 Relational "(e)pistemologies" Deep ecologists such as Naess are criticized for failing to supply an adequate his- torical perspective or an adequate challenge to the human/nature dualism (Plum- wood, 1 99 1, Bookchin, 1988)- Some criticize deep ecologists for still relying on a rationalist- inspired account of the self (Plumwood, 1991), while others criticize them for not relying enough on man's reason to solve our ecological problems (Bookchin, 1988, Watson, 1983). We will find out below that ecofeminists criticize deep ecologists for ignoring the role of androcentric thinking. Robert Sessions ( 1 99 1 ) informs us that the controversy between deep ecology and ecofeminism has been going on since 1980. "Some deep ecologists have accused ecofeminism of shal- lowness, anthropocentricism, short sightedness, and environmental naivete, while various ecofeminists have called their accusers sexist, shallow, ahistorical, stoical, and even fascist" (Sessions, 1991, p. 91). Ynestra King (1991) describes deep ecolo- gists as "Daniel Boones in ecological drag." It does not go unnoticed by ecofeminists that most deep ecologists (and ecological philosophers, and social ecologists, for that matter) are White males. We will discover below that ecofeminists do not disagree with deep ecology's anthropocentrism. They argue that anthropocentrism relies on the same either/ or logic as androcentrism. However, they insist that anthropocentrism is deeply em- bedded within androcentrism. Deep ecologists agree that ecofeminists such as War- ren (1990) have successfully shown that the logic of androcentrism is parallel to the logic of anthropomorphism. They agree men are far more implicated than women, as are certain cultures and classes, in the exploitation of nature. They agree that egalitarian attitudes should apply to all humans too. For Warren (1990), deep ecology must be feminist at its core for nature and women are parts of a whole. Fail- ure to notice the connections between nature and women is male-gender bias (Warren, 1990, p. 144, emphasis in original). Deep ecologists are not androcentric, but they are guilty of complicity by not recognizing sexism and naturism. What we have discovered with Naess's ecosophy in particular is that he has not successfully made the ontological transformation to which he points. He has not succeeded in dissolving the Euro-western human/nature split himself, but rather has recom- mended a philosophy that shifts the value from humans to nature. Still, his consid- eration of Buddhist ideas and process ideas such as gestalt, point us in an ecological relational direction. I return now to a discussion of Native American ecological views. Native Americans do not embrace a human/ nonhuman split, thus eliminating the need to create a hierarchy between humans and nonhumans. For them, human beings are part of Nature, and Nature is part of us. This is a transactional relationship that can- not be separated. "(H)umans not only live in relationship to the natural world; we are the natural world" (Cajete, 1994, p. 80). For Native Americans, spirit and mat- ter are one and the same, and Nature is a sacred, spiritual being. They describe hu- mans and nonhumans as relatives, interrelated and connected to each other, part of</page><page sequence="13">Ecological Relations 195 one whole which is the planet Grandmother Earth. Paula Gunn Allen (1990) de- scribes Nature as relatives of womankind and mankind. I am speaking of all our relatives, the four-leggeds, the wingeds, the crawlers; of the plants and seasons, the winds, thunders, and rains, the rivers, lakes, and streams, the pebbles, rocks, and mountains, the spirits, the holy people, and the Gods and God- desses - of all the intelligences, all the beings. I am speaking even of the tiniest, those no one can see; and of the vastest, the planets and stars, (p. 55) We learned from the Navajo creation stories shared in Chapter 6 that while hu- mans are described as descending from dyinii (gods), the boundary between the spiritual world of gods and humans is flexible and fluid. The Navajo experience themselves as being part of something larger than themselves, linked to the imma- nent powers of the universe in a profound oneness. They are the Holy People them- selves. We also learned that people were described, First Man, First Woman, as being born from Nature, from Black Cloud and White Cloud, from Blue Cloud and Yellow Cloud. Nature is described in spiritual terms, as imminent, and the boundary between Nature and humans is again a flexible and fluid one. Not only are the Holy People descended from Nature, but Nature serves as a teacher and mentor for the Holy People and helps guide them in their lives. Nature advises people through the Holy Wind talking to them, whispering in their ears. The Holy Wind gives people life, animates them, and directs them. The Holy Wind is Spirit. Even though Mabel McKay, as a Pomo Indian, described Spirit in different terms, she still described a similar connected relationship with Spirit and Nature, in unified and w/holistic terms, with Spirit advising her and giving her life, speaking to her in her Dreams in- stead of in her ear, teaching her how to heal others and make them whole again. Native Americans did not place themselves above animals, plants, and the land, but instead described themselves as one with Nature. We can see the results of their connectedness to Nature in how they chose to live their lives, historically, and con- tinue to do so today. Native Americans did not clear the forests and erect fences, trying to claim the land as theirs, and tame it. They tried to maintain a harmonious relationship with the land. Indian people lived with as little impact on the natural state of the land as possible. They allowed the land to be, taking from it only the resources necessary for their survival, but always remembering that it was given to them as a gift. (Cajete, 1994, P- 77) They did not view themselves as property owners of the land they lived on; that is an Euro- western idea they had to adjust to in order to have any remaining land on which to live. Rather, Native Americans viewed the land as alive and helping them be alive, and they continue to relate to Nature in this way. They literally view</page><page sequence="14">1 96 Relational "(e)pistemologies" themselves as having been born from the land. They view it their sacred respon- sibility to maintain a harmonious, sustainable relationship with the land. They reg- ularly give thanks to the land's spirit for supporting their lives. Land is sacred to Na- tive Americans, indeed, all Indigenous people. "Indigenous means being so completely identified with a place that you reflect its very entrails, its soul" (Cajete, 1994, p. 87). Loss of land for Indigenous people means more than loss of a home. It means loss of a way of life, loss of meaning and identity, for their culture is tied so in- timately to the land. Native Americans do not try to amass wealth by accumulating more of Nature than they need to survive. Animals, as kin, are often described as transforming into human shapes in tribal stories, and then offering their human relatives advice on such things as hunting, so that they do not risk offending the Animal Spirits. In general, Native Americans have historically only killed what animals they needed for survival, and when they did kill an animal, they apologized for doing so and gave thanks for the gift of life the Animal's Spirit gave them. They promised to offer their human body back to the plants and animals and the land in order to help sustain those lives as well. It was very important that the hunter have a good heart, for his actions represented his community to the Animal Spiritual world. The hunter's journey is a spiritual journey toward completeness, as he participates in the "great dance of life" (Cajete, 1994, p. 54). Native Americans also try to show their grati- tude by not being wasteful of Nature so that, for example, they use the animal's body as thoroughly as they can so as not to need to kill more than a necessary number of animals. They have a history of sharing what they have with others in their tribe, so that everyone has enough to survive. To Native Americans, plants are the hair of Mother Earth. They are sacred too, and must be used with care and gratitude. Plants not only supply people with a source of food, they serve as material for making clothing, housing, and for artistic expression, for example. Plants also serve as sources of medicine. Indigenous people have tremendous knowledge about plants and their uses for healing. They are heal- ers, and herbalists, naturalists, botanists, and ecologists. They view illness as a sign of loss of dynamic balance and displeasure of the Holy Ones. Shamans and healers try to diagnose what is wrong and apply a treatment so that balance and harmony can be restored. Illness is due to disrespect, dishonor, disturbance, misuse or miscon- duct, and ignorance. From a Native American perspective, the current condition of our Earth, with its unprecedented exploitation of human and natural resources, and profound alienation, is a tremendous sign of our lack of balance and harmony with Nature, and the displeasure of the Holy Ones. As we know from the previous chapter, Native Americans have historically relied on an oral tradition to pass on their cultural wealth to the next generation. Deloria, Jr. (1995) tells us that the reliance on oral tradition is still true today, and that only 10% of the information Indians possess is printed and available for discussion. Many</page><page sequence="15">Ecological Relations 197 of their stories are witness stories or scouting reports of such things as geological events that occurred a long time ago, yet Euro-western scientists treat oral tradition as if it is not true. This disrespect for oral tradition is in spite of the Native American claim that their elders are like scientists, for as storytellers they specialize in particular stories and treat storytelling as a precise art. The people who often be- came the tribe's great storytellers were scouts, who had to be good observers and an- alyzers, and had to be trusted for telling the truth. As a Dakota Sioux Indian, Deloria, Jr. (1995) offers powerful criticisms of Euro- western science's view, since Descartes, of Nature as an inert object. He points out practical examples of science gone mad, and the impact of scientific doctrine on the status of Indians in American society. The Indian explanation of Nature is al- ways cast aside as superstition, and childish ignorance. Euro-western science does not respect non-western traditions. Racism is inherent in Euro-western academia and in scientific circles, and the evidence is seen in how information offered by a Native American scholar is discounted, and will only become valid when it is of- fered by a White scholar recognized by the academic establishment (p. 49). De- loria, Jr. (1995) points to many examples of Euro-western scientific frauds (e.g. Medel, Pasteur) and he points to subjects that are prohibited because they call into question long-standing beliefs. He describes how Euro-western science tenaciously holds on to its beliefs and how prestigious personalities dominate a field, creating a scientific folklore. Given that background defense, Deloria, Jr. (1995) offers a Native American ac- count of North American history. He looks at the scientific fields of anthropology, geology, and biology to call into question geological time scales, the Pleistocene overkill theory, and the Bering Strait theory. He helps us understand that Native Americans possess tremendous knowledge of Nature because they treat Nature as alive, and consider it a knowledgeable teacher, offering them countless lessons. They study mammals and birds to learn the use of medicinal plants, for example, and have always done so. However, Euro-western science does not recognize that knowledge as authentic until it is "westernized," as can be seen by the 1992 an- nouncement, at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advance- ment of Science, of a new field of study - "zoopharmacognosy" - studying the use of medicinal plants by animals (Deloria, Jr., 1995, p. 58). Deloria, Jr. suggests that in order for the Euro-western scientific world to take Indian knowledge seriously, a fundamental (e)pistemological shift must occur, one that recognizes humanity and nature as interconnected, interrelated, and alive. Paula Gunn Allen (1986) connects Euro- western judgment of Native American philosophy-religion-science to patriarchy. She presents the case that Native Americans embraced gynocentric creation stories pre-contact by Euro-westerners by pointing to many examples of various tribal creation stories where women play central roles. Allen's case draws our attention to a strong connection for Native</page><page sequence="16">198 Relational "(e)pistemologies" Americans between females and nature. She describes how women have always held honored, respected roles within Native American tribes as spiritual leaders due to their intimate connection with Nature. Allen argues that Euro- western coloniz- ers sought actively to replace the gynocentric focus of Native American views with patriarchal Euro- western models. One of the major ways this reshaping and remod- eling occurred was through severing the Native American connection to Nature. Euro-westerners pushed the Indigenous people of North America off their lands. By doing so, Native Americans were separated from not only their physical liveli- hoods, but also their source of knowledge, and their spiritual strength. With the loss of their land, they lost their sense of connected wholeness and their sense of direc- tion. Native Americans lost control of not only their land, but their heritage as well. They have fought in every way imaginable to them to regain and maintain their connection to Nature, even resorting to allowing their gynocentric focus to be replaced with a patriarchal one. The results of these battles between Native American and Euro- western views have been devastating for Native Americans. Only recently have they begun to regain control of their heritage and heal the split between human beings and nature, between man and woman, forced upon them by Euro-westerners. Allen's (1986) connection of Native Americans relationality with Nature to Native American ways of relating to women is a very important connection. While Buddhists and deep ecologists describe a strong relationality between human beings and nature, they do not address woman's role in this relationality. They deny the necessity of specifically addressing 'women' as a category. For Buddhists this speci- ficity is not necessary for women can evolve to the higher spiritual category of men, as they continue their spiritual journey to Buddhahood. It is argued by deep ecolo- gists that 'women' are subsumed under the general ontological category of 'human being.' However, feminists argue that history belies that assumption. 'Man' is as- sumed under the category of 'human being,' and 'woman' falls below man in the hierarchy, associated more with nature than with man (Merchant, 1980). For a long time feminists have been trying to make explicit the connection between women and nature, and the destructive oppression that results to women and nature, due to a patriarchal hierarchy that devalues both of them. More re- cently this connection has been strongly drawn, and feminists working on this project have been labeled ecofeminists.2 The efforts of ecofeminists make an impor- tant contribution to our understanding of ecological relations. They expand the metaphysical arguments for ecological relations to include political issues of power and domination. They help us understand that in order for us to begin to rethink environmental problems we must begin to reshape the power relations in the world. They argue that ecology remains an abstraction that is incomplete without making the connection between misogyny and hatred of nature (King, 1989). While deep ecologists argue against anthropomorphism, ecofeminists argue against</page><page sequence="17">Ecological Relations 1 99 anthropomorphism and androcentrism. With that distinction in mind, I turn now to a closer examination of women's relation to nature, and how this relation effects our ecological relations. Woman and Nature Feminists have been aware for a long time of the socially determining efforts of var- ious cultures to link women to nature. In The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir (1952/1980/1989) described women and nature as the original "others." Women are defined in contrast to men and nature is defined in contrast to human beings and culture. Predominantly, women are linked conceptually to nature through bio- logical arguments that focus on women's reproductive role. In the Euro-western world, where nature is described in contrast to human beings and is viewed as a force to dominate and control, linking women to nature places women in a domi- nated role as well. Linking women to nature also means women are defined in contrast to culture. The effort to link women to nature has been an argument for biological determinism. It has also been an argument for women's inferiority, and for harmful female sex-gender stereotypes used to justify women's subordination. It is an argument that is socially constructed so that "(w)omen's oppression becomes neither strictly historical nor strictly biological. It is both" (King, 1981, p. 15). Ecofeminists such as Karen Warren (1987, 1988, 1990) and Ynestra King (1981, 1987, 1989, 1990) help us consider more closely the connection between the sexist treatment of women and ecological devastation. They suggest that these problems may have the same root, patriarchy. Ecofeminists insist that analysis of the human/ nonhuman split must be grounded in an understanding of power and social repro- duction. King, one of the earlier feminists contributing to the ecology movement, has been actively participating in ecological issues since the early 1970's, prior to the coining of the term 'ecofeminist.' King has contributed significantly to the de- velopment of ecofeminism as a concept and as a movement, publishing articles and teaching classes on ecofeminism at the Institute for Social Ecology in Vermont. She has helped organize conferences, and she has participated in direct action pro- tests against war, nuclear energy, and toxic waste dumps, and in support of clean water, and organic farming, for example. She (1989) defines ecofeminism's basic principles as: i ) Western civilization is built around the subjugation of nature and women, who are believed to be closer to nature. 2) "Life on earth is an interconnected web, not a hierarchy" (p. 19). Ecofeminism seeks to show the connections between all forms of domination. Ecofeminism practice is necessarily anti-hierarchical.</page><page sequence="18">200 Relational "(e)pistemologies" 3) "A healthy, balanced ecosystem, including human and nonhuman inhabitants, must maintain diversity" (p. 20). 4) We need a renewed understanding of our relationship to nature, one that chai' lenges the dualism of nature/culture (pp. 19-20). King (1981) argues that the nature/culture split is the primary contradiction of our time, and it is also the split that weds feminism to ecology. "Without an ecolog- ical perspective which asserts the interdependence of living things, feminism is dis- embodied" (King, 1981, p. 15). As King (1990) describes the task of ecofeminism, it is antidualistic, dialectical, involving theory and praxis. "Ecological feminism is about reconciliation and conscious mediation, about recognition of the underside of history and all the invisible voiceless activities of women over millennia. It is about connectedness and wholeness of theory and practice" (King, 1981, p. 15). She calls for a reenchantment of human beings with nature. I will come back to this call later in this section. Warren (1990) carefully defines ecological feminism as "the position that there are important connections - historical, experiential, symbolic, theoretical- between the domination of women and the domination of nature" (p. 126). Warren argues that the connection between women and nature is a conceptual one that has been socially constructed. However, she rightfully points out that connecting women to nature does not lead automatically to oppression. We have already found this to be true, for Native American spiritual views connect women and men to Na- ture, as Spirit, and even emphasize women's biological role of reproductive mother- ing, and yet this connection did not lead to the domination and oppression of women. Instead, the connection of women to Nature led to Native Americans hon- oring and valuing women's role in creation. Women earned roles as spiritual leaders and healers in their tribes due to their relationship with Nature (Allen, 1986). We have to introduce what Warren (1990) calls the "logic of domination" in order to explain and justify the subordination of women and nature to men and cul- ture. Even if we consider socially constructed realities that are based on hierarchies and dualisms, hierarchies and dualisms are not inherently problematic either, ac- cording to Warren. She points to taxonomies and biological nomenclature as exam- ples of hierarchical thinking that are important for classifying, organizing, and com- paring material, and yet they do not make judgments concerning the value of that which is classified. We can even make value judgments and still not be guilty of op- pression. It is what we do with our judgments, the way we use them to establish in- feriority and then to argue that inferiority justifies subordination, that causes prob- lems. The logic of domination is the step where subordination is applied. Without the establishment of moral superiority and that superiority justifies subordination, all we have established is that there are some differences (between man and woman, between man and nature, between culture and nature).</page><page sequence="19">Ecological Relations 201 Warren (1990) carefully diagrams the ecofeminist argument, by first laying out the argument for patriarchy as argument B: (Bi ) Women are identified with nature and the realm of the physical; men are identified with the 'human' and the realm of the mental. (B2) Whatever is identified with nature and the realm of the physical is inferior to ( 'below') whatever is identified with the 'human' and the realm of the mental; or, conversely, the latter is superior to ('above') the former. (B3) Thus, women are inferior to ('below') men; or conversely, men are superior to ('above') women. (B4) For any X and Y, if X is superior to Y, then X is justified in subordinating Y. (B5) Thus, men are justified in subordinating women (p. 130). Notice that step Bi establishes an assumption of dualism, and step B2 establishes an assumption of hierarchy. We will find out below that some ecofeminists, such as so- cial ecofeminists like Carol Merchant (1980, 1989, 1990, 1992), deny Bi as being true, biologically, while other ecofeminists, such as radical cultural ecofeminists like Mary Daly (1978/ 1990) claim that women are connected to nature, biologically, in ways that men are not. Some liberal feminists, such as de Beauvoir (1952/1980/ 1989), argue the truth of B2 is the reason for insisting on the severing of the dualism in Bi, separating women from nature. No matter whether feminists agree on the truth of Bi and B2, all feminists oppose the logic of domination, step B4, and all feminists agree that it is a historical fact that Bi and B2 have been assumed to be true in the dominant Euro-western philosophical tradition. Ecofeminists argue that although Bi and B2 are historically sanctioned claims, they are problematic claims. "(T)hey are problematic precisely because of the way they have functioned histori- cally in a patriarchal conceptual framework and culture to sanction the domina- tions of women and nature" (Warren, 1990, p. 131). We found in the section above that Buddhists, deep ecologists, and Native Americans all deny the truth of B2, although they do not deny that B2 is a histori- cally accurate description of Euro- western views of nature. Ecofeminists also deny the truth of B2. Deep ecologists are working to overturn the human sense of super- iority over nonhuman nature. Buddhists and Native Americans deny the dualistic split in Bi between humans and nature. Warren (1990) argues that "ecofeminism is necessary to any feminist critique of patriarchy, and hence, necessary to feminism" (p. 131, emphasis in original). This is because ecofeminism clarifies why a logic of domination must be abolished. "Femi- nism must embrace ecological feminism if it is to end the domination of women be- cause the domination of women is tied conceptually and historically to the domina- tion of nature. ... A responsible environmental ethic also must embrace feminism"</page><page sequence="20">202 Relational "(e)pistemologies" (pp. 143 and 144, emphasis in original). Warren does not present the arguments for the historical connections between the domination of women and nature. Instead, she points to others' work where that argument has already been made - one of the others being the feminist historical scholar, Carolyn Merchant (1980, 1989). Mer- chant serves as an excellent resource in this manner, for although she is not a phi' losopher and consequently her philosophical analysis is lacking, she is a historian of science and her historical analysis is strong. I turn to her as my source to help make the case for the historical sanctioning of nature and women as connected and infe- rior, by Euro-western philosophers, and scientists. Following Merchant, Mary Daly (1978/ 1990) will be my source to add to deep ecologists' case for the domination of women and nature by Christian theologians. This historical sanctioning by Euro- western philosophers, scientists, and theologians justified the subordination of na- ture and women to men and their cultures. I will return to Warren at the end of this section, for her argument for loving perception directly relates to my argument for caring reasoning. As a historian of science, Merchant's (1980, 1989) focus is more on the contex- tual social and intellectual factors involved in the changes in science, than on the actual content of science itself. Merchant (1980) is interested in the overlapping values expressed by both feminism and ecology, as expressed by sharp criticism "of the costs of competition, aggression, and domination arising from the market eco- nom(y), [and] the consequences of uncontrolled growth, [as well as by their efforts to] restore the balance of nature, . . . [and] live within the cycles of nature" (pp. xvi and xvii). She (1980) examines "the values associated with the images of women and nature as they relate to the formation of our modern world and their implica- tions for our lives today," in an effort to liberate women and nature from anthropo- morphic and androcentric views (p. xvii). In Death of Nature, Merchant (1980) traces the changes in European views of nature and women from ancient Greece through the work of the founding fathers of modern science: Francis Bacon, William Harvey, René Descartes, Thomas Hobbes, and Isaac Newton. In Ecological Revolutions , she (1989) traces the ecological history of North America, in particular New England, by looking at colonial America during the time frame of 1600- 1860. She chooses to focus on New England because changes in its ecology and society were rapid and revolutionary. What took Europe 2500 years of development, the USA did in 1/ 10th the time. In both books Merchant's (1980, 1989) themes are the same: the roots of the en- vironmental crisis, the roles of women in history, the change from nature as mother to nature as machine, and the place of science in the creation of the modern world. She analyzes reproduction in relation to production, and science within the broader context of human consciousness. She looks at different ways of knowing nature, and how they change over time. Merchant (1989) tells us:</page><page sequence="21">Ecological Relations 203 My thesis is that ecological revolutions are major transformations in human rela- tions with nonhuman nature. They arise from changes, tensions, and contradictions that develop between a society's mode of production and its ecology, and between its modes of production and reproduction. These dynamics in turn support the ac- ceptance of new forms of consciousness, ideas, images, and worldviews. (pp. 2-3) For Merchant (1980, 1989), science and history are both social constructs. She (1989) argues that nonhuman nature is an active complex that participates in change over time and responds to human- induced change. "Nature is a whole of which humans are only one part" (p. 8). The human- nonhuman relationship is re- ciprocal. Merchant describes an ecological paradigm as one that takes relations, context, and networks into consideration, and asserts the primacy of process in the natural world. Merchant (1980, 1989) concludes that in 1500 the cosmos was bound together as a living organism. By 1700 it had become a machine. These two views have ex- isted in underlying tension throughout time. The mechanistic view of nature as- sumes that nature can be divided into parts, the parts can be rearranged, and facts can be extracted and tested and verified by resubmitting to nature. The mechanistic view of nature assumes that science offers us objective, value-free and context-free knowledge of the external world. It attempts to reduce human behavior to statisti- cal probabilities and conditioning (e.g. Skinner). Replacing the mechanistic para- digm is going to take a global social and economic revolution. According to Mer- chant (1989), this revolution will require getting rid of capitalism and patriarchy. If we can reintegrate nature with culture, mind with body, male with female, we can make the transition to a sustainable earth. Ecological thinking rests on different assumptions about nature: ( i ) everything is connected to everything else in an integrated web; (2) the whole is greater than the sum of the parts; (3) nonhuman nature is active, dynamic, and re- sponsive to human actions; (4) process, not parts, is primary; and (5) people and na- ture are a unified whole. (Merchant, 1989, p. 263) Merchant (1989) points to new work in science: Gregory Bateson's ecology of mind; David Bohm's physics; James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis; and chaos theory, as ex- amples of changes that are taking place, moving us toward an ecological paradigm shift. I will turn to some of these examples in Chapter 8, for they do indicate a shift in science's focus to cyclical processes, the interconectedness of all things, the es- sential role of every part of an ecosystem, and the leveling of hierarchies. Merchant (1990, 1992) classifies her analysis of ecology and feminism as repre- senting a socialist ecofeminist perspective. Social feminists place their focus on issues concerning social justice and domination, and offer a critique of capitalist patriarchy.</page><page sequence="22">204 Relational "(e)pistemologies" Social feminists describe nature in terms of how it functions as a material basis of life, supplying food, shelter, clothing, and energy. Nature is described as being so- cially and historically constructed (not biologically). The focus of their analysis is on the transformation of nature by production and reproduction. In general, social feminists have not paid too much attention to ecological issues, but rather place their focus on class, gender, and race issues. Merchant is an exception to the case, for as a social feminist, Merchant is the main scholar who has placed ecology on the socialist agenda. King (1981) compliments Merchant for focusing ecofeminists' at- tention on material conditions. But she criticizes Merchant for not including a spir- itual focus. Social feminists do not place their attention on spirituality, preferring to focus on materiality as the force driving social change. They do not offer a Utopian vision of how the world could be and a strong cultural foundation, and King ( 1981 ) suggests this is a lack, for it is vision and spirituality that drive a revolution. King ( 1981 ) attempts to align Merchant's social feminism with liberal feminism, but this is an unfair representation of Merchant's work. Let me show why. Simone de Beauvoir (1952, 1980, 1989) is an excellent representative of a liberal feminist. De Beauvoir's position is that feminists must sever the woman-nature connection in order for women to achieve liberation. As long as women are tied to nature they will be devalued by society. She suggests that it is a sexist ploy to define women as being closer to nature than men. This liberal position does not seek to question the dualis- tic split between nature and man, or nature and culture, but rather seeks to place woman on the same side of the split as man, separated and disconnected from na- ture, and higher in value. Liberalism assumes the anthropocentric notion that hu- manity should dominate nature and that the domination of nonhuman nature is a precondition for human freedom. Because of this, as King ( 1981 ) rightly points out, liberal feminism is unwittingly anti-ecological. Merchant (1990, 1992) compares the liberal position to reform environmentalism, in contrast to radical ecology. Re- form environmentalism seeks to improve our natural conditions and change human relations with nature through the passage of new laws and regulations. Their belief is that better science and better laws will solve our environmental problems. Liberalism's roots reside in the Enlightenment Euro-western philosophical-scientific analysis of nature as composed of atoms moved by external forces, and humans as in- dividual rational agents who are motivated by self-interest. Clearly, Merchant (1990) does not represent a liberal feminist position, such as de Beauvoir represents, for liberal feminism maintains its roots in the very mechan- istic science Merchant argues against. Unlike liberal feminists such as de Beauvoir, Merchant does challenge the culture/nature split and she strongly maintains an ec- ological view of science. However, King's (1981) criticism that Merchant's socialist feminism lacks spirituality is a fair criticism. Merchant does focus on materiality at the expense of spirituality. Merchant (1990, 1992) labels the spiritual position that connects women to nature "radical ecofeminism." King (1981, 1990) labels the</page><page sequence="23">Ecological Relations 205 same position "radical cultural feminists," which is the term I will use as it more spe- cifically describes the view. As we will find next, with a discussion of Mary Daly's Gyn/Ecology (1978, 1990), radical cultural feminists argue that women are closer to nature than men, and they celebrate women's biology and nature as sources of fe- male power. Radical cultural feminists, such as the Native American, Paula Allen (1986), emphasize spiritual connections between women and nature, and consider spirituality to be the driving force for social change. Merchant (1990, 1992) tells us that she worries that radical cultural feminism, "in emphasizing the female, body, and nature components of the dualities male/fe- male, mind/body, culture/ nature, . . . runs the risk of perpetuating the very hier- archies it seeks to overthrow" (1990, p. 102). However, there are many different ex- amples of radical cultural feminists, some of whom are more dualistic in their perspectives than others, so to reduce them to one position is an unfair and inaccu- rate description. Paula Allen (1986) has a different perspective from Mary Daly (1978, 1990), or Susan Griffin (1978), and both Allen and Griffin avoid the dual- isms Daly seems to want to embrace. Also, in her expressed concern, Merchant con- flates dualities with hierarchies, yet Warren (1990) has demonstrated for us logi- cally that dualisms and hierarchies are not one and the same thing. Warren also shows us that logically either one or even both together do not necessarily lead to oppression without the logic of domination. Still, I share Merchant's concern about dualisms and hierarchies, for even though logically they do not necessarily lead to domination, historically they have tended to do so. Like King (1989, 1990), I think ecofeminism must be anti- hierarchical and anti-dualistic in its philosophy in order to have a chance of chang- ing views on nature and women in a wholistic direction. We need to embrace a both/ and logic. We must recognize the existence of differences and their vital im- portance in helping us gain perspective on our own views and in stimulating growth and change and at the same time we need to emphasize connections. I hope this text helps us recognize the interconnectedness of all things, as in a web, and their essential role in our ecosystem. In dualistic thinking the emphasis is on differences at the expense of connections. Before we know it, hierarchical values are placed on the differences, and one is valued more than the other. Then the logic of domina- tion is applied easily to one side or the other of the dualistic split, and the result is oppression. Native Americans stand as a strong example of cultural groups that maintain Nature is Spirit, and recognize that women have a strong connection to Nature, and yet Native Americans value women and honor them because of this connection, rather than devalue them and treat them in a subordinated role. Men are not disfa- vored in their cultures either. Yet, we will discover with Mary Daly's position, below, that Daly inverts the male/female, mind/body, culture/nature dualisms and em- braces a hierarchical value in favor of the female, body, and nature components of</page><page sequence="24">2o6 Relational "(e)pistemologies" the dualities, against the male side of the dualism. Her position threatens to reintro- duce the logic of domination as she names males the enemy, and she refuses to teach male students in her classes.4 In spite of Daly's radical stance, she does help us understand how to dissolve the very dualisms she seems to want to reify. And, she offers an important, strong analysis of Judeo-Christian theology's role in historically sanctioning the domination of women and nature. Before turning to Daly's analysis, there is another criticism of Merchant's work that I would like to offer. It is also a criticism that will apply to Daly's work, below. Both authors contribute significantly to our understanding of the dominant Euro- western influence of philosophy, science, and theology on our present ecological condition. But, in the process they both neglect minority views and race as a cate- gory, so that the dominant influences, which are White, become totalizing and es- sentializing. Their arguments neglect an important form of domination and risk being reductionistic, as a result. The general criticism of neglecting minority views is a criticism that all feminists are guilty of to varying degrees. As to the neglect of race as a category, this is a problem feminists such as Mer- chant and Daly have learned from and have sought to alleviate in their subsequent work. Because all feminists are opposed to the logic of domination, as Warren (1990) explains, they are easily able to include race as a category, once it is brought to their attention. Racism depends on the same logic of domination as sexism. Nei- ther Merchant, nor Daly, intentionally neglected race and for both of them their analysis can easily be expanded to include race as a category as well as specific mi- nority ethnic perspectives in their discussions. Merchant (1989) does expand her own historical analysis in Ecological Revolutions to include more minority perspec- tives, in particular Native American cultures. She offers a new synthesis - how dif- ferent cultures occupied the same space with different effects on the environment. Daly addresses this issue in her newer introduction written for the 1990 printing of Gyn/ Ecology, pointing out that she does cite women of color often in her original text, for example Adrienne Rich, and she thanked Audrey Lorde in the original Preface for her encouragement. She means her book to be an "Open Book." She apologizes for any pain her unintended omissions may have caused others, espe- cially women of color. "The writing of Gyn/ Ecology was for me an act of Biophilic Bonding with women of all races and classes, under all the varying oppressions of patriarchy" (p. xxxi). Let us move on to a discussion of Daly's (1978/1990) Gyn/ Ecology specifically. Mary Daly (1978/1990) represents an excellent example of a radical cultural feminist. Rather than trying to sever women from nature, as liberal feminists tend to do, radical cultural feminists delve deeply into the woman/nature connection and celebrate the relationship between women and nature. Rather than focusing on ma- terial conditions, as socialist feminists tend to do, they embrace a spiritual focus. Theirs is a deeply women- identified position that celebrates spirituality. Allen</page><page sequence="25">Ecological Relations 207 (1986) serves as another excellent example of a radical cultural feminist whom we have already come across. Allen (1986) turns back to pre-contact Native American creation stories to highlight women's connection to nature. We find in Gyn/Ecology that Daly (1978/ 1990) looks to prehistory (pre-Greeks) for examples of Goddesses (Ishtar, Isis, Demeter and Persephone, Shekinah) to highlight women's connection to nature. Daly (1978/ 1990) is a philosopher and theologian, holding Ph.D.'s in both fields of study. She is a professor of theology and her approach to the women/nature issue emphasizes her theological background, in particular her Christian background. Gyn/Ecology is Daly's powerful deconstruction of Christianity's hatred of women and nature, and her own celebrative embracement of the women/nature connec- tion. As Daly describes her task, she is exorcising Christianity, as noxious gases, and spinning anew. As I shift into Daly's language, it is important to point out that Daly plays with language a great deal in her text, similarly to other postmodern philoso- phers. Her use of language is very consciously done, to draw our attention to the meaning of words, and to actively work to change that meaning. For example, Daly does not capitalize words we commonly capitalize, such as 'Christianity,' and she does capitalize words that are not normally capitalized, such as 'Lesbian.' Gyn/ Ecol- ogy is written in a non-scholarly style that draws the reader's attention to words and language, and invents new words as well as recreates old ones. Many of Daly's refer- ences are to the dictionary and the etymology of words. Notice that even in her title, she takes the standard term for the medical science of women's diseases and severs the term, and reappropriates it. When the title is displayed visually, we dis- cover that the '/' used to split 'gyn' from 'ecology' is the double-axe of the Amazons, the Labrys, which Daly uses to cut through double-binds and double-binding words. Daly (1978/1990) seeks to emphasize that her view is a woman's view, a wild woman's view. Her sources are women's experiences, thus the reason for 'gyn' in her title. She describes a Journey, a Voyage for the Lesbian imagination in All Women, for the Hag/Crone/Spinster in every living woman. She uses 'ecology' to point to the complex web of interrelationships between organisms and their environment. Daly is concerned with what she calls pollutions of the mind/body/ spirit inflected through patriarchal myth and language on all levels. Thus, besides focusing on lan- guage, Daly focuses on myths and symbols that are direct sources of christian myths. One of Daly's (1978/1990) very important contributions to feminist scholarship is the distinction she makes between foreground (which is the male, patriarchal world) and deep Background (which is the feminist world). We discovered in Chap- ters i and 2 that Dewey and James make a similar distinction between foreground and background. Background is pure experience and foreground is the meanings we give to that pure experience. Foreground experiences are always in addition to pure experiences; they do not take away from pure experience. But foreground draws our attention to noticing certain of our experiences and not others, causing us to lose</page><page sequence="26">2o8 Relational "(e)pistemologies" awareness of much of our pure experience, all that is not caught in the ontological net of categories our foreground uses. I also discussed this idea in Chapter 5, with Berger and Luckmann's description of a socially constructed reality as foreground. Daly (1978/1990) makes a metaphysical distinction between pure experience in its fullness, undifferentiated, as background, and experience that is categorized and socially constructed, as foreground. For Daly, the foreground we all experience is pa- triarchy, and she means all, for she describes patriarchy as the prevailing religion of the entire planet. Here is an example of the tendency to reductionism I pointed to earlier, for we know from Chapter 6 that Native American cultures did not embrace patriarchy in their creation myth stories. According to Allen (1986), patriarchy was imposed on Native American spirituality by the White colonizers of America, when they brought their christian myths to America and insisted that Native Americans must convert to Christianity. In Gyn/Ecology, Daly (1978/ 1990) tries to uncover the language and myths that hide the background of women's experiences. For Daly, every woman is a battered woman, at a psychic level, from the start, due to the patriarchical foreground that surrounds her. Part I is an uncovering of the master's maze in Christianity, a charting of deadly deception and dismemberment (Processions). Daly (1978/ 1990) focuses on the all male Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Ghost) and its circular pattern for muted exis- tence. She also considers christian myths, pointing to Apollo as "the personification of anti-matriarchy, the opponent of Earth deities" (p. 62), and Dionysus as the other face of the same god. Dionysus's mother is already dead long before he is born, as his father, Zeus, "dispenses with the woman and bears his own son" (p. 65). Daly de- scribes Sadomasochism and male methods of mystification: erasure of women, re- versal, false polarization, and divide and conquer techniques (p. 8). She contrasts the christian trinity as the paradigm of processions to triple Goddesses of early my- thology, such as Athena (Greece), Neith (Libya), Hera-Demeter-Korê (pre- Hellenic), and Eire-Fodhla-Banbha (Irish), for example. The basic pattern repre- sents Maiden, Nymph, and Crone, or Maiden, Mother, and Moon (p. 76). The Goddesses represent the Tree of Life, but with Christianity, the tree becomes the symbol of the torturing cross, and "Christ assimilates/devours the Goddess," as he becomes the symbol of life (p. 81). The cauldron, which was a symbol associated with the Mother Goddess, identified as women's transforming power, is stolen by christian myth and becomes the chalice, "a symbol of the alleged transforming power of an all male priesthood" (p. 82). Daly's point is that "(i)n Christendom as well as in postchristian secular society, the words/expressions of female spirit are raped, twisted, tortured, dismembered" (p. 93). Part II is a study of various Sado-Ritual Syndromes, the Re-enactment of Goddess Murder. In particular, Daly shows us how the female spirit is "raped, twisted, tor- tured, dismembered" through the vivid examples of: India-Suttee (widows ceremo- niously burned alive on the funeral pyres of their husbands); Chinese footbinding</page><page sequence="27">Ecological Relations 209 (binding a young girl's feet so they will remain small, thus crippling her); African genital mutilation (the circumcision and then sewing up of much of the young girl's exterior genital area, to insure virginity at marriage); European witchburning; American gynecology; and Nazi medicine and American gynecology compared. Part III is Daly's (1978/1990) positive vision, Gyn/Ecology, which she describes as: Spooking (positive paranoia, unpainting, re-membering, enspiriting the self, bonding with daughters, learning to hear and respond to the call of the wild), Sparking (Female Friendship, in contrast to war's comrades), and Spinning (weav- ing tapestry's of our own creation, spiraling, whirling). Daly affirms in Gyn/Ecology that everything is connected with everything else. Creativity is spinning in the sense of dis-covering the lost thread of connectedness, repairing the web, spiraling, whirling. Spinning as amphibious/multibious be-ings, spinning as spiders. "Genuine Spinning is spiraling, which takes us over, under, around the baffle gates of god- fathers into the Background" (p. 405). It's a holistic process of knowing. "The meta- patriarchal journey begins with hearing the dissonent voices of the foreground and dis-spelling them" (p. 405). This is the function Part I and II have in Daly's text, to hear the dissonent voices of the foreground (patriarchy) and dis-spell them. She seeks to re-claim life-loving female energy, and argues that males' very existence de- pends on stolen female energy. "If patriarchal males loved life, the planet would be different" (p. 352). Daly describes the State of Patriarchy as the State of War (rape). Daly (1978/ 1990) argues that males fear female bonding as a much bigger threat then infidelity. This is because Sisterhood is an affirmation of freedom. Sisterhood does not result in loss of self- identity but rather encourages the expression of it, dis- covery of it, creation of it. Sisterhood encourages self-acceptance. Female Friend- ship does not result in merging, tokenism, or self-sacrificing. Since we begin our lives in patriarchy, we begin in an injured state, not a state of innocence. Our Voy- age is not to regain lost innocence, but is to learn innocence, to increase innocence. "Powerful innocence is seeking and naming the deep mysteries of interconnected- ness" (414). Crones are constantly weaving and unweaving. "Unweaving involves undoing our conditioning in femininity" (p. 409). Daly's Part I and Part II are exam- ples of unweaving. Part III is her weaving. She is Spinning so she can survive. "Ceasing to Spin is subviving" (p. 410). Daly affirms that gyn/ecologists have "a deep communion with our natural environment" (p. 409). The reader can easily see that Merchant (1990) is right to be concerned that Daly's position is one that reifies the very dualities she seeks to overthrow. Daly (1978/ 1990) vividly portrays the logic of domination as it has been used in Christi- anity to oppress women and nature, so vividly that it is painful to read. Her focus is on the logic of domination as patriarchy, and its effects on women. She does not dis- cuss how patriarchy harms males as well. Consequently, she maintains a sharp split between women and men, and romanticizes women as good in contrast to evil men. In doing so she also essentializes women, not adequately addressing the real diversity</page><page sequence="28">2 io Relational "(e)pistemologies" of womens' lives and histories across race, class, and national boundaries. As King (1981) points out with radical socialist feminism (Merchant) and radical cultural feminism (Daly): "The problem with both analyses, however, is that gender identity is neither fully natural nor fully cultural. And it is neither inherently oppressive nor inherently liberating" (p. 13). Daly's (1978, 1990) painful, powerful analysis of Christianity's patriarchy and its harm to women and nature can work to help us become aware of the acculturation, the conditioning we have all experienced (not just females). Her methodology of carefully examining the symbols, myths, and language upon which our ideas rest, similar to Allen's and Merchant's, helps us understand how to critique our own accul- turation. Daly's historical tracing of myths back to origins helps us find ways to undo the harm our myths created, through the wrong-headed directions our myths took. She shows us how to contrast our myths and symbols to others, not like ours, so we can better critique our own by gaining an outsider's perspective. We can retrace our steps and learn where we went wrong, re-conceive and re-vision our world, then re- tell our myths, re-write them, re-weave them. In that re-telling, it is vital that we eliminate the logic of domination, in all its forms, and create "a world in which dif- ference does not breed domination " (Warren, 1990, p. 145, emphasis in original). This section should make it vividly clear to Buddhists and deep ecologists that focusing on nature's domination without addressing women's domination will not lead to the end of oppression for either nature or women, as both are supported by patriarchy. The voices of socialist feminists should remind us we must address material issues as well, and work to solve the oppression of poverty. The voices of Native American scholars and other minority scholars represented here should also make it clear to White scholars, male and female, that we will not end the oppression of nature until we ad- dress racism as well. These same voices, and those of radical cultural feminists such as Daly, should remind us of the importance of addressing our spiritual needs. King (1990) contrasts ecofeminism to liberal, social, and cultural feminism, ar- guing that they all make contributions to help us find our ways, but they all surrender to some form of natural determinism that ecofeminism does not surrender to (p. 130). She points to a need for a dynamic developmental theory of the person, a need for mystery (spirituality) and attention to personal alienation. She calls for "rational reenchantment," which she means as a healing of the heart/mind split, a healing of the split between the political and the spiritual, between the spiritual and material, between being and knowing. This is the project of ecofeminism, "the moment where women recognize ourselves as agents of history - yes, even as unique agents - and knowingly bridge the classic dualisms between spirit and matter, art and politics, reason and intuition" (King, 1990, pp. 120- 121). As King (1987) points out, ecofeminists do not think we should abolish science, but rather that we should do science as Barbara McClintock (Keller, 1983) and Ra- chel Carson ( 1962) have done, with compassion, by connecting loving and knowing</page><page sequence="29">Ecological Relations 211 (p. 731). I will discuss McClintock's work in Chapter 8. This connection between loving and knowing, between the heart and the mind, is what I refer to as caring rea- soning (see Chapter 4). Caring reasoning is not practiced just with other human be- ings, as part of the larger natural world, but with all others that make up the natural world. Caring reasoning is the art of generously and attentively listening to the other, presuming and maintaining differences (pluralism), recognizing the impor- tance of valuing and respecting the other, while at the same time acknowledging and appreciating our commonalities and our interconnectedness with each other. Caring reasoning highlights how we are separate and distinct and how we are connected. Caring reasoning allows us to use our hearts and our minds, to openly embrace others as well as critique others. We cannot fairly critique until we have lovingly perceived the other. By other, I do mean all others in the cosmos, as related kin. With an ecological relationality we do not need to draw our attentions to social justice at the expense of spirituality or vice versa, for a w/holistic relational ontol- ogy insists the two cannot be separated. Our metaphysical assumptions and our epis- temologica! assumptions exist in a transactional relationship with each other. Issues of power, as we have found with our discussion of patriarchy, are very connected to spirituality issues, as we discovered with our discussion of transcendental theology. A relational (e)pistemology, which is supported by a relational ontology, helps us focus our attention on our interrelatedness, and our interdependence with each other and our greater surroundings. It helps us become more aware of our fore- ground so that we can critique it. A relational (e)pistemology is contextually situ- ated and in process. It is critically deconstructive as well as creatively reconstruc- tive&gt; It helps us dive back into our inarticulate primal experience, as a whole, not separate from nature or each other, but one with all of life. I move on now to con- sider recent changes in scientific ideas, which depend on a paradigm shift away from atomism and individuality, away from mechanism and dead, inert nature, toward an alive, compassionate, connected, relational approach.</page></plain_text>
