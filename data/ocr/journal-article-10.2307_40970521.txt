<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Self and Its Vicissitudes: An "Archaeological" Study of the Psychoanalytic / Avant-Garde* / BY LOUIS A. SASS 1 he "self," once banished by mainstream psychology to the cloudland of unobservable and irrelevant abstractions, seems to have returned with a vengeance. Not only in psychoanalysis, but also in empirically harder-nosed fields like cognitive, behavioral, and social psychology, the nature and nurturing of the self has become a central concern- the stimulus for an outpouring of new theories, therapies, and research.1 Similar trends are, of course, prominent in other disciplines through- out the social sciences and humanities.2 1 The following are some examples of the trend in psychology: R. Fine, Narcissism, the Self and Society (New York, 1986); K. J. Gergen, "Theory of the Self: Impasse and Evolution," in Advances in Experimental Social Psychology 17 (1984): 49-1 15; K.J.

It is true that, in the more avant-garde fields of the human studies (in literary theory, Marxist studies, and French psychoanalysis, for example), this modern turn to "the self" has been superseded by theoretical strategies that aim to destroy the claims of this secular god. But even in these quarters- the realms of "postmodernism" and "poststructuralism"- selfhood remains a central obsession: for, as we shall see, many who claim to disbelieve in the self seem to take an inordinate delight in dancing round its burning image.4 New as it may be in empirical psychology, preoccupation with the nature of the self is, of course, hardly a recent development in Western thought. Indeed, according to many historians, concern about the self is the central theme of the last several centuries of Western culture- whose spiritual history can be read as a sort of "journey into the interior," marked by such events as the Renaissance "discovery" of individuality and "the dignity of man," the Enlightenment assertion of human freedom and self-determination, the romantic glorification of York, 1978); R. Mischel, ed., The Self: Psychological and Philosophical Issues (Totowa, N.J., 1977). 3 On the prominence of "self disorders," see C. Lasch, The Culture of Narcissism (New York, 1979), and A.

The present essay considers several major positions on selfhood in contemporary psychoanalysis in the light of this history. I hope to show the intellectual roots and underlying "root metaphors" of four of the most influential and creative theorists of recent years: the Freudian analysts Roy Schäfer, Heinz Kohut, and Jacques Lacan and the Jungian James Hillman.5 Since the nature of the self is perhaps the central issue of psychoanalytic debate today, to survey this theme is to cover many of the major issues of contemporary psychoanalysis. Also, it is in the psychoanalytic branch of psychology that views about the self have been most highly elaborated, polarized, and influential. All too often, however, psychoanalysis has tended to be highly insular, ignoring its historical roots in other disciplines and leaving the impression that its theoretical advances have sprung full-grown from the brow of a Kohut or a Schäfer. The present essay is in the postpositivist spirit that recognizes psychology's need to consider its own historical- cultural foundations and, in particular, to acknowledge "doubts concerning the putative 'independence' of psychology from philosophy."6 I hope to provide what the philosopher/ historian Michel Foucault has called an "archaeology" or "genealogy" of contemporary thought. Thus I am not interested in the history of ideas for its own sake, but for the light such a perspective can shed on contemporary conceptions and controversies. (Foucault has described such a study as not 5 On the notion of "root metaphors," see S. Pepper, World Hypotheses (Berkeley, 1942). 6 Quote from S. Koch, "Afterword," in S. Koch and D. E.

In concentrating on problematic aspects of the psychoana- lytic approaches, I do not mean to detract from the contributions of these four theorists. All are major figures who have focused attention on aspects of personality or therapy that may not have been sufficiently appreciated in psychoanal- ysis. The special contribution of an "archaeological" analysis such as mine is, however, to clarify those deep and usually unacknowledged presuppositions that tend to control a writer's thinking without awareness, and to show how certain characteristic contradictions and exaggerations are likely to flow from this fundamental position. The point, then (as Foucault has said of his genealogical method), "is not that everything is bad but that everything is dangerous."8 A study such as this is important, however, not solely for the light it sheds on psychological theories per se, but also for what it may suggest about modern culture and the modern mind in general. With the emergence of the social sciences and the receding of philosophy into more and more technical concerns (at least in England and America), psychology has usurped the role once played by philosophy (and before that by religion). 7 M. Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison (New York, 1979), p. 31. Also see M. Foucault, The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences (New York, 1970). I am obviously using the terms "archaeology" and "genealogy" more loosely than does Foucault, who distinguishes between the two and contrasts both with more traditional studies of the history of ideas: see H. Dreyfus and P. Rabinow, Michel Foucault (Chicago, 1982). My approach in this essay is in fact closer to the history of ideas, though the greater concern with implicit or hidden assumptions and with unrecognized affinities between thinkers may bring it somewhat closer to Foucault's "archaeology." 8 Quoted in M.

Therefore, in the models and metaphors of psychological theory, we can discover the various aspirations, sometimes conflicting, of modern Western culture, and can observe what Lionel Trilling has called "the moral life in process of revising itself."9 I begin by surveying the history of philosophical notions of the self in modern Western thought, relying here on the historical analyses of the philosopher Charles Taylor. After this schematic overview, I will turn to psychoanalysis, considering the theories of the two most influential "human- istic psychoanalysts" of recent years, the "action language" of Roy Schafer and the "self psychology" of Heinz Kohut. My purpose here is to analyze the root metaphors of these important theories, and thereby to demonstrate how each is a manifestation of one of the two modern notions of selfhood that, according to Taylor, have emerged in Western thought since the seventeenth-century Enlightenment. After pausing to consider certain self-vitiating dilemmas which both of these alternatives involve (dilemmas that, in a sense, afflict the whole project of modern "humanism"), I will consider, in somewhat less detail, two other approaches that react strongly against "humanism": namely, the "archetypal psychology" of James Hillman and the poststructuralist psychoanalysis of Jacques Lacan. Whatever one may think of the cogency of their theories or the efficacy of their therapies, these four psychologies have been among the most important sources of innovation and controversy in recent psychodynamic thought. Two of them might, in fact, be thought of as the major heresies of modern psychoanalysis: for, while Kohut's self psychology has recently gained much support in North America, the Lacanian approach has had an enormous influence on European and South American psychoanalysis, as well as on 9 L. Trilling, Sincerity and Authenticity (Cambridge, Mass., 1971), p. 1.</page><page sequence="6">556 SOCIAL RESEARCH literary theory in North America. Though somewhat less influential, Hillman and Schäfer are nevertheless figures of considerable importance. Hillman is the most innovative and vital among contemporary Jungian (or post-Jungian) thinkers, while Schafer is the most famous and, perhaps, prototypic representative of a very major trend of current psychoanalysis: the rejection of "metapsychology" in favor of a less determin- istic and, supposedly, more "hermeneutic" approach. Before turning to these schools- perhaps the most impor- tant representatives of what one might call the contemporary psychoanalytic avant-garde- it is first necessary to consider the major concepts of selfhood in the last several centuries of Western thought. Given the enormity of such an intellectual task, I am fortunate in being able to rely on Charles Taylor's masterful survey of the major trends, which is summarized in the next section.10 Notions of the Self: Modern, Protomodern, Premodern In Taylor's view, the "modern" conception of human subjectivity and its relation to the world is largely based on two conceptions or images of human nature that emerged in the late eighteenth century. One of these conceptions emphasizes as the human essence the exercise of radical freedom, an autonomy unfettered by external constraints of nature or society. The other emphasizes a more complex aspiration: self-expression as the organic unfolding of an innate essence enfolded within the individual human being, an essence that, despite its innerness and its individuality, can be realized only through communion with nature and one's fellow man. Although there are significant differences between these two "modern" conceptions- the "autonomous" and the "expres- sivist" images of man- they also have profound affinities: most 10 C. Taylor, Hegel (Cambridge, England, 1975), espec. pp. 3-126.</page><page sequence="7">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 557 importantly, an "inward turn" that Taylor sees as the essence of their shared "modernity." Thus each of these images conceives of the human subject as essentially self-denning rather than as defined by its relationship to some all- encompassing cosmic or religious order. In Taylor's view (as in that of many historians of Western culture), this inward turn is the essential fact about modern man, and its origins can be traced to a crisis and transformation of European thought and experience that occurred somewhat earlier, at the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth centuries, and that came to permeate the thought of the Enlightenment (ca. 1670-1 770). n Before considering the two late-eighteenth- century images of man, it is first necessary to consider this earlier transformation of European consciousness. Central to the "crisis of European consciousness" of the late sixteenth century was the emergence of the Galilean/Newto- nian worldview of modern science and the undermining of the "premodern" Aristotelian worldview that this entailed. In the Aristotelian vision, which had prevailed throughout the medieval and early Renaissance periods, man could be said to have found his place by looking outside himself toward a cosmic order, an order imbued with "value concepts, such as perfection, harmony, meaning and aim."12 The meanings and values by which one lived were felt not to be emanations from within but reflections of the surrounding cosmos, a "great chain of being" in which man himself played a small and predestined but secure part. In Alexandre Koyré's description of the earlier conception, the world was then seen "as a finite, closed, and hierarchically ordered whole ... a whole in which the hierarchy of value determined the hierarchy and structure 11 In this essay, I often use "man" to refer to human beings in general. Given the nature of my subject matter- the history of ideas- it seems appropriate to adopt this usage, which has, of course, been standard in the philosophical traditions I summarize. " A.

Lovejoy, The Great Chain of Being (Cambridge, Mass., 1936).</page><page sequence="8">558 SOCIAL RESEARCH of being, rising from the dark, heavy and imperfect earth to the higher and higher perfection of the stars and heavenly spheres "1S In the world of Galilean or Newtonian science, this looking-outward for the source of meaning no longer made sense, for by then a radical separation had been set up between the inner realms of mind or consciousness and the external realm of matter and the physical world. The external world of nature came in the Enlightenment to be understood in a mechanistic and materialist fashion -as a "disenchanted" realm of merely contingent correlations utterly devoid of human meaning, and subject only to purely causal laws and modes of explanation. The categories of purpose and value, and all associated modes of ideological understanding, tended either to be rejected as illusory projections onto an indifferent universe or else to be treated as applicable only to the "inner" realm of human experience. Thus this Galilean/Newtonian worldview involved two main ways of understanding human nature. To avoid confusion with the two "modern" images of man already mentioned, and with the "premodern" Aristote- lian worldview, I will refer to these two Enlightenment views as "protomodern."14 According to the first protomodern view, man was just like any other object in nature- to be studied by the same methods of objective observation and understood as being subject to the same mechanistic and atomistic laws of causation. The associationistic psychologies of Hobbes, Hume, and Bentham (like that of their behavioristic successors) are examples of this homogenizing worldview which assimilates mind to matter. The second protomodern conception, by contrast, viewed human consciousness as radically different from the phenom- 13 Koyré, From the Closed World, p. 2. 14 Intellectual historians have dated the origins of the modern era in a number ot different ways. My use of the terms "modern," "protomodern," and "premodern" is not meant to enter into this controversy, but only to provide heuristically useful labels for an otherwise confusing progression of ideas.</page><page sequence="9">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 559 ena of the natural world; here the best example is Cartesian philosophy, with its famous dualism. Thus Descartes' well- known method of doubt (the cogito ergo sum) involved withdrawing from a supposedly dubious external world and concentrating on a supposedly indubitable and secure realm, the subjective domain of one's "own processes of observation and thought about things."15 This inward move was doubly inconsistent with the outer-directed, premodern view of the early Renaissance: in Descartes' conception, not only did self-knowledge require turning away from the external world or cosmos; it also revealed an "inner" realm, a realm of consciousness that was felt to be more fundamental and meaningful than the ambient universe. From this new standpoint of the "self-defining subject," the old (premodern) model, with its orientation to the cosmic order, "looks like a dream of self-dispersal; self- presence is now to be aware of what we are and what we are doing in abstraction from the world we observe and judge."16 Taylor points out, however, that this (Cartesian) conception of consciousness as a self-sufficient, inner realm cannot be separated from the antithetical, but ultimately complementary, vision of a purely contingent, meaningless external world: it is only because of its sharp contrast with such a deterministic world that the "inner" and "subjective" realm could come to seem so independent of all natural constraints, and thus so totally free to define and control itself. Also, the very comprehensibility and predictability of an external world of contingent correlations and causal laws contributed to the subject's exhilarating sense of having the power of manipula- tive control over the world. It is for these reasons that, as Taylor puts it, "A disenchanted world is correlative to a 15 Taylor, Hegel, p. 7. 10 Ibid. See Foucault, Order of Things, for another description of the epistemic and cosmological shift from the Aristotelian to the mechanistic view, and also for discussion of the inherent contradictions of modern notions of "man."</page><page sequence="10">560 SOCIAL RESEARCH self-defining subject."17 If we bear in mind these protomodern views, which emerge with the seventeenth century's scientific revolution and inform the consciousness of the Enlightenment, we can better understand the "modern" images of man that follow. For, as we shall see, the two "modern" images (the autonomous and the expressivist) both perpetuate and oppose these earlier developments. The first modern view, that of "autonomous" man, seems to derive in a relatively straightforward fashion from the Cartesian vision of a self-defining subject, but with one important addition. As Taylor explains through the example of Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), the most important exponent of the autonomous view, the (descriptive) notion of self- sufficiency came, in the late eighteenth century, to take on a prescriptive or ethical cast, to be conceived not simply as a fact about human nature but as something it was morally incumbent on man to recognize and to exercise. Kant defended a radical notion of human freedom and argued that morality and determinism were absolutely incompatible, since praise or blame was relevant only to acts freely chosen and performed. To recognize one's fundamental independence of all forms of natural causality was to be "free in a radical sense, self-determining ... as a pure, moral will." Against Hume's notion that the self was "a mere bundle of perceptions' with no visible principle of unity," Kant argued (by means of his famous "transcendental deduction") for the necessity of assuming a unified self, the unity of the "I think" which accompanies and constitutes all possible experiences.18 This immensely influential doctrine initiated a "cult of moral autonomy"19 and thereby contributed to a broad current of 17 Taylor, Hegel, p. 8. 18 Ibid., pp. 31,30. ltf I. Berlin, The Counter-Lnlightenment, in V. Wiener, ed., Dictionary of tue History of Ideas (New York, 1973), p. 107.</page><page sequence="11">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 561 radical individualism which still pervades Western and perhaps especially North American culture.20 Such a conception is consistent with the Cartesian version of the Enlightenment world view in two ways: first, it opts for the notion of the self-defining subject; second, it accepts the dualism of mind versus matter. This Kantian vision is a reaction against the Enlightenment only insofar as it rejects the other (i.e., the Humean or Hobbesian) side of the Enlighten- ment view of man, the homogenizing or naturalizing tendency to treat the human being as just another object in the natural world, amenable to the same modes of objective study and mechanistic explanation as apply to the physical world. More deeply inconsistent with ( protomodern) Enlighten- ment conceptions is the more complex view that Taylor terms "expressivist," for expressivism rejects not only Newtonian mechanism but also Cartesian dualism as guides to the understanding of subjectivity and its place in the world. Central to the expressivist aspiration, which largely coincides with romanticism (ca. 1780-1830) but is rooted in earlier, Counter-Enlightenment thinkers like Vico (1668-1744), is the attempt to overcome all forms of separation, both those within man and those that separate man from the social or natural world, for these are seen as leading to a sterile, devitalized, and alienated sense of human existence. Expressivism reacts against the analysis of the mind into different faculties, against the separation of feeling, will, and the imagination from intellect, against the division of man into a material body and an immaterial soul, and, finally, against the polarization of consciousness and an objectified physical world.21 This expressivist overcoming of all dualisms is intimately bound up with the emergence of a new root metaphor: 20 See R. N. Bellah et al., Habits of the Heart (Berkeley, 1985). 21 Thus Coleridge wrote that the objective of his philosophy was to substitute "life and intelligence . . . for the philosophy of mechanism, which, in everything that is most worthy of the human intellect, strikes Death": quoted in M. H. Abrams, The Mirror and the Lamp: Romantic Theory and the Critical Tradition (New York, 1958), p. 65.</page><page sequence="12">562 SOCIAL RESEARCH organicism. The Newtonian/Cartesian image of a mechanistic universe of extended substances in external, causal interaction is replaced by that of the biological organism.22 Since this latter model of the natural world emphasizes qualities that also characterize human experience- unity, wholeness, and purpo- siveness (but a purposiveness that need not be conscious or involve volitional choice)- the Cartesian dualism of mind and matter is undercut. This allows for a reduction or overcoming of the (Cartesian) polarizations both within man (soul versus body) and between man and the external natural world. Thus such an organicist vision holds out hope for achieving a new kind of connection with the physical world, a relation quite different from the manipulative or causal-deterministic ones offered by the autonomous visions of Kant and the Enlightenment. Because of its teleological nature, the biologi- cal organism could be seen as akin to consciousness. Insofar as the physical world was conceived on an organismic (rather than physicalistic) model, it was therefore possible to imagine the world as having a certain resonance with the "inner" life of man- whose own mode of self-experience the expressivists conceived as a vital, organic pulsation felt from within (rather than as the intellective, contemplative, and wholly independent self-awareness of the autonomous Cartesian or Kantian subject, who does not coincide with his body so much as exist inside it, like a captain in a ship or a ghost in a machine).23 The expressivist rejection of Cartesian dualism also had important implications in the realm of methodology and epistemology, 22 See ibid., pp. 204-208; Pepper, World Hypotheses, pp. 280-316. 23 One of the clearest expressions of this vision of essential unity between man and nature, consciousness and matter, is contained in Henri Bergson's comment on the phenomenon of habit: "Now, our inner experience shows us in habit an activity which has passed, by imperceptible degrees, from consciousness to unconsciousness and from will to automatism. Should we not then imagine nature, in this form, as an obscured consciousness and a dormant will? Habit thus gives us the living demonstration of this truth, that mechanism is not sufficient to itself: it is, so to speak, only the fossilized residue of a spiritual activity": quoted in Heller et al., Reconstructing Individualism, p. 6.</page><page sequence="13">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 563 for expressivism rejected objectifying vision and insisted that understanding requires the observer to enter empathically into the inner and emotional life of the observed. In some respects, the expressivist vision might seem to involve a return to the premodern era, when nature was a locus of human meaning. But, given the accentuation of subjectivity in expressionism, "communion with the surround- ing world was desired not in the form of the contemplation of a cosmic order of ideas [as in the Aristotelian, premodern world], but rather as a communion appropriate to subjectivi- ties." "What is sought for," writes Taylor, "is interchange with a larger life, not rational vision of order."24 Also central to expressivism is the notion of growth. Change is understood on an organic rather than a mechanistic model, as involving an inborn and inner essence that initially exists in potentia and, as it were, yearns to realize itself through a natural process of self-unfolding. Though it is conceived as an innate teleological process, this self-unfolding can fulfill itself only when it occurs in an environment that harmoniously echoes the self's inner pulsations. For many expressivists (notably the German romantic Herder), the unique or individual nature of this inner essence was emphasized: fulfillment for each individual (or for each culture or Volk) meant expressing the person's or the culture's own special way of being human.25 Understandably, discover- ing this unique essence was extremely important; for not only did the expressivists conceive of the unique inner essence as guiding self-expression (rather like a genetic program), they often considered the very process of discovering this essence to be one of the modes o/such self-expression. Consequently, just as the aspirations of the radically autonomous conception encouraged the project of self-control, that of expressivism 24 Taylor, Hegel, pp. 23, 25. ^Ibtd., p. 15.</page><page sequence="14">564 SOCIAL RESEARCH valorized self-exploration and self-expression.26 Art and the process of art-making- understood not as Aristotelian mimesis but, on the romantic model, as organic self-expression- served as the prime example of this process of self-unfolding; art thereby took on a quasi-religious function.27 This natural and spontaneous seJf-unfolding was not, of course, seen as inevitable; it could be stifled or go awry. Expressivist theorists have, however, tended to conceive of any distortions of this process of unfolding as necessarily resulting from the negative impact of an unsympathetic environment, not from anything intrinsic to the self. Society as it exists- with its artificiality and rigidity- has generally been seen as distorting the intrinsic organicity of the natural world, and thus as providing a hostile rather than a mutually resonating environment for the self-unfolding of the individual. The differences between these two strains of modern humanism seem evident enough. The position of "moral autonomy" accepts a dualistic universe and then enjoins man to express his essence through an exaggeration of this dualism. As Taylor points out, the separation or "diremption" from nature (both external and internal) that inevitably results is at cross-purposes with the expressivist ideal of wholeness within the self and unity between self and external world. Further, the self-clarity inherent in the exercise of a purposeful Kantian rational will is very different from the purposes, but not necessarily transparently self-aware, self-actualization inherent in organic unfolding. And yet, as Taylor emphasizes, we should not forget the important affinities between the autonomous and expressivist perspectives. Both aspirations did, after all, arise in reaction 26 In a recent article, Taylor associates this project with the Counter-Enlightenment essayist Montaigne, who was such a major influence on the Western tradition of autobiography. See C. Taylor, "The Moral Topography of the Self," in S. Messer, L. Sass, and R. Woolfolk, eds., Hermeneutks and Psychological Theory (New Brunswick, N.J., 1988). 27 Cf. Abrams, Mirror and Lamp; Taylor, Hegel p. 21.</page><page sequence="15">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 565 against a certain homogenizing materialism and objectivism (i.e., against the first "protomodern" strain); accordingly, both place great emphasis on the ideals of freedom and of individualism. Also, both suggest that the true expression of self will occur in opposition to external forces, whether those of the material universe or of the artificial customs and morals of existing society. Since many post-Enlightenment thinkers have been simultaneously drawn to both these ideals of modern humanism, we should not expect to find absolutely pure cases of one or the other aspiration. Nevertheless, current psychoanalytic visions of the self do gravitate toward these alternatives, and they do incur the same problematic conse- quences as afflict these classical positions. As we shall see, some of these problems can best be understood as involving conflicts between the aspirations toward autonomy and toward expres- sion-that is, as ways in which fulfillment of one of these ideals tends to bring with it an undermining or abdication of the other (a problem deeply felt by those many moderns who, while emphasizing one ideal, have actually been drawn to both, often without realizing the incongruence between them). Perhaps even more significant, however, are certain internal contradictions: ways in which pursuit of a single one of these aspirations tends, paradoxically enough, to undermine certain of its own deepest yearnings. Now we are ready to turn to the psychodynamic perspectives of Schafer, Kohut, Hillman, and Lacan. Despite their differences, all four of these theorists have at least one thing in common: opposition to the "ego psychology" that has become the psychoanalytic orthodoxy of our day. (Ego psychology, the immediate successor to Freud's first or "classical" version of his theory, grew out of Freud's postulation of the structural or tripartite model of personality as the interaction of id, ego, and superego. To the classical psychoanalytic concern with instinct, ego psychology adds a heavy emphasis on the functions of the ego, especially mechanisms of defense against inner drives and the outer-directed capacity for accurate assessment of the</page><page sequence="16">566 SOCIAL RESEARCH world, i.e., "reality-testing.") As we shall see, however, "ego psychology" means different things to different people. The humanistic psychoanalysts Schafer and Kohut emphasize ego psychology's continuity with classical psychoanalysis, both of which they reject as too deterministic and reifying (i.e., for being too closely akin to the homogenizing mechanism of the protomodern position described above). Hillman and Lacan, on the other hand, criticize ego psychology precisely for deviating from classical psychoanalysis, and thereby losing Freud's most valuable insight into the fragmentary, decen- tered, or illusory nature of the self (and thus for being, in the sense discussed above, too "modern"). Our first example, Schafer's action language, turns out to be a rather straightforward expression of the radically autono- mous conception of modern self-defining subjectivity; as we shall see, Schafer accepts not only a Cartesian ontology but also something akin to a Kantian ethics. Schafer's "Action Language" Schafer criticizes the traditional psychoanalytic modes of discourse (known as "metapsychology," and including both classical psychoanalysis and ego psychology) for their tendency to reify psychological processes, thereby treating these pro- cesses as events that happen to the patient rather than as actions the patient performs- that is, as the doings of "a unitary, fully responsible agent."28 ("Metapsychological" expla- nation involves the translation of observable behavior and lived experience into abstract terms defining the relationship of various hypothesized realms or faculties of the mind- for example, "unconscious," "preconscious," "conscious," and "cathexis," or "id," "ego," and "superego.") In contrast with what Schafer calls "the premodern language of mind used by 28 R. Schäfer, The Analytic Attitude (New York, 1983), p. 246.</page><page sequence="17">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 567 Freud," the primary rule of his "action language" alternative is that all the phenomena of human experience and behavior- not only all thoughts and actions but also all experiences, emotions, desires, and dreams- are to be designated by verbs in the active voice and understood as "actions," as "intentional or goal-directed performances" "for which the analysand accepts some significant measure of responsibility." Only in this way, says Schafer, will we (as, presumably, we should) "unquestionably require there to be a specific author of the action in question."29 Like that of Descartes and Kant, Schafer's reasoning tends to be very either/or. In his argument, he presupposes a dualistic ontology with a fundamental rift between two modes or realms of being: a physical world to which natural-scientific and causal-deterministic modes of explanation apply, and a human realm where only the "empathic-introspective method" and teleological-purposive explanations are applicable. In contrast with philosophers like Ricoeur and R.S. Peters who regard psychoanalysis as necessarily a "mixed or even ambiguous discourse," Schäfer insists that "the natural science and the experiential rhetorics simply do not mix."30 Psychoanalysis, he says, must reject Freud's "Newtonian idea of psychodynamics" and adopt "a thoroughly non-mechanistic, non-organismic language," a language of reasons, not causes. He contrasts this action-language approach with the misleading logic of the traditional psychoanalytic "metapsychology" - an approach which supposedly demands "that every psychological process or phenomenon must be located within the realm of psychic determinism or psychodynamics."31 As Schäfer sees it, the traditional approach commits the same error as did the 29 R.

Schafer's notion of activity is meant to apply not only to the subject's movements and manipulations of the world but also to his or her experience of the external world. Thus, for Schäfer, the point to be emphasized is that experience is always an active construal, never just a passive reflection of a determin- ing external reality.32 For him, the very fact that the subject contributes to what is experienced indicates that the subject is "active" and "responsible"- even when the subjective contribu- tion would hardly seem to imply that the subject of experience is in any sense in control (e.g., when experience can be shown to be imbued with "phase-specificity," with, say, meanings appropriate to the "oral" or "anal" stage).33 On his action- language reading, therefore, the point of psychoanalysis is not so much that consciousness and action have unconscious and instinctual causes as that people are "authors of their existence," since the realm of "action" includes "all their mental operations and thereby all the circumstances they contrive and all the meanings they ascribe to their circum- stances, whether contrived or imposed on them."34 Such a position assumes not only that subjectivity is self-defining, but that in the most essential sense it also defines- rather than derives from or participates in- the encompassing world or 32 Schäfer, Narrative Actions, p. 4; R. Schafer, Langwage and Insight (New Haven, 1978), p. 197; Schäfer, Analytic Attitude, p. 89. 33 Schafer, Analytic Attitude, pp. 99-100. Thus Schäfer reasons from the premise that "strictly speaking, there are no phenomena accessible to us in which the subject has not already played a part" to the conclusion that "every action must be located within the realm of reasons" (New language, pp. 201/307); and from the "recognition that bodily categorizations play a great part in the child's construction" of situations to the conclusion that "a situation corresponds to an action," and indicates that one "author[s] one's own life" (Analytic Attitude, p. 100). Incidentally, this kind of reasoning belies Schafer's occasional claims that action language "does not exclude necessity" in the human domain (Analytic Attitude, p. 84). 34 Schafer, New Language, p. 153; Analytic Attitude, pp. 107, 233.</page><page sequence="19">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 569 the bodily substrate.35 "People, thus, are far more creators and stand much closer to their gods than they can bear to recognize," writes Schäfer.36 Schafer's acceptance of the modern notion of self-defining subjectivity seems clear enough. And, as we have seen, this goes along in his case with an acceptance of the ontology of the second, dualist strain of Enlightenment thought. Obviously, Schafer's rejection of causal or quasi-materialistic explanations regarding human action and experience is not the same as denying dualism itself. Indeed, the very single-mindedness of Schafer's insistence on activity and responsibility in the human or mental domain attests to his unquestioning acceptance of this Cartesian ontology, in which the realm of mind or experience is associated with freedom and contrasted with a domain of mechanistic determinism.37 (One could, of course, accept the significant role played by consciousness in the "construction" or "interpretation" of the world without assuming that this role is intentionalistic or under the subject's control. Indeed, as we shall see in the case of Kohut, and still more obviously in the cases of Hillman and Lacan, interpretive knowing can, from an organicist, an archetypal, or a structuralist standpoint, be seen as something that, as it were, happens to the subject rather than as something the subject does in an "active" way. The subjectivity of experience need not, then, indicate that the individual subject's role is active or "responsible.") 35 As Schafer (New Language, pp. 8, 153) realizes, such an argument is reminiscent of Sartrian existentialism, with its radically dualistic ontology and its emphasis on the absolute freedom of human consciousness. But, as Sartre himself came to realize, such a view is seriously one-sided since it fails to grasp the ways in which consciousness itself is, if not determined, at least profoundly influenced by factors beyond its own ken: cf. the summary in R. D. Laing and D. Cooper, Reason and Violence (New York, 1971). Schafer, New Language, p. 153. Schäfer does admit that there are circumstances where the action concept does not apply: e.g., severe brain damage and early infancy (Analytic Attitude, pp. 84, 99, 112). This does not, however, mitigate his essential dualism, since he treats these conditions, where determinism applies, as existing on the other side of an ontological divide. They do not make him question the applicability of his action-concept to the rest of human experience and behavior.</page><page sequence="20">570 SOCIAL RESEARCH Schafer sometimes presents action language as just another creative "construal" of the world- a "narrative" choice no more or less "true" than other such construais38 (though he will say it has more "consistency, coherence and transforma- tional effectiveness"39). In fact, however, he is not as relativistic as this sounds. In his view, the causal-deterministic or anthropomorphic descriptions or explanations of traditional psychoanalysis are clearly less valid than intentionalistic ones. (Here, incidentally, we see the two major threads of Schafer's work coming into conflict. The modernist relativism or fictionalism implicit in his writings on the various "visions" of reality- largely informed by his reading of Northrop Frye- is not really consistent with the more positivistic bent of his action language.) Thus, whereas he refers to action language as providing "the locutions of insight" and the accounts of "a more reliable narrator," he constantly reiterates the merely hypothetical and illusory nature of metapsychological, causal descriptions- writing, for example, that "people are fantasiz- ing whenever they disclaim action," and that "to refer to happenings" rather than actions is to "reinforce certain resistant strategies."40 Like many Enlightenment thinkers wary of what the empiricist Francis Bacon called the "idols of the mind," Schafer also opposes what he calls "the careless importing of experiential terms into theory"; thus he criticizes "traditionally evocative or richly metaphoric language"- as, for example, the language Freud used in telling "the tale of an 38 Schäfer, Narrative Actions, p. 35; Analytic Attitude, pp. 212, 268, 277. Also see R. Schäfer, "Narration in the Psychoanalytic Dialogue," in On Narrative (Chicago, 1980). 39 Schafer, New Language, p. 141. 40 Ibid., p. 146; "Narration in the Psychoanalytic Dialogue," p. 44; Analytic Attitude, pp. 243, 93. This is apparent in the following passage where Schäfer criticizes the (metapsychological) statement "He can't control his sexual drive": ". . . we must appreciate that 'can't' is a hypothetical inability-word that is often used carelessly or defensively in place of the more exact and simple descriptive words 'don't' and sometimes 'won't'. . . . The idea that one is powerless is a common variation of the inexact word 'can't' " (New Language, p. 208). It should be obvious that for Schafer to assert that "won't" is more exact and descriptive, and less hypothetical, than "can't" amounts to saying that the former, intentional statement is the more correct or true.</page><page sequence="21">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 571 Ego Ideal or Superego measuring the ego, judging it, and shaming or punishing it, as though it were another forceful person or another person's forceful will."41 With these traditional modes of psychoanalytic description -the causal- mechanistic and the anthropomorphic picture of homunculi in interaction- Schäfer contrasts the supposedly less fanciful, less metaphoric action-language account. The following is one of Schafer's examples of an action-language account, in this case of a conflict about overeating: One might say, "I ate excessively according to the standards I maintain regarding quantity, and I contemplate what I did regretfully and contemptuously." ... In this action version of self-indulgence, rather than two selves being at odds with one another or at least interacting with one another, there is a single agent performing and considering certain of his or her actions in different, more or less incompatible ways, which is to say performing them, and perhaps consciously considering them, conflictedly.42 Schafer sees action language as "an attempt to describe analytic data with as little use as possible of blatant unsystematized metaphors, especially those metaphors derived from and conducive to a model of a mind-machine or a brute organism with a tamed mind."43 From a non-Cartesian (say, an expressivist) standpoint, however, a description like the above is hardly devoid of metaphoric components: it is just that the prevailing metaphor is a Cartesian one- that of a self-defining subject who seems to survey, as if from a position of detachment, a set of possible courses of actions that are arrayed before him almost like visual objects. As mentioned, Schaf er often backs off from an explicit claim that his approach has more objective truth than does metapsychology; at these times, he often retreats to a more 41 Schäfer, Narrative Actions, pp. 34, 35; Analytic Attitude, pp. 250-251.

Such a shift encourages in the patient "an enhanced and more rational sense of personal responsibility" and agency- the very quality that, for Schäfer, is virtually definitive of psychological maturity and health.46 Consequently, Schäfer claims that action language is the "native tongue" of psychoanalysis and, presumably, of all effective psychotherapy.47 For example, he writes that it is "a defining feature" of psychoanalytic interpretation to retell happenings as actions, and thus to transform "disclaimed actions" into "claimed actions" (defined as "those for which the analysand accepts some significant measure of responsibility"48): During the progress of an analysis . . . [l]ess and less do analysands present themselves as lived by impulses, emotions, defenses, or conflicts; more and more . . . analysands come to 44 Schafer, New Language, p. 146. 45 In recent writing, Schäfer claims that he never intended to prescribe action language as something to be used "explicitly and consistently in the clinical dialogue": R. Schäfer, "A Response to Meares," Contemporary Psychoanalysis 21 (1985): 445-448. Rather, he says, action language is meant to provide only a "theoretical language." Actually, his writings do imply that the therapist should use action language whenever possible (e.g., ". . . when we make optimal interpretations, we avoid any suggestion that we are speaking of happenings in the mind .... Rather ... we want to refer ... to the analysand's being engaged in ... actions": Analytic Attitude, p. 93). Also, Schafer does claim that it is an empirical fact that, as patients improve, they begin to speak of their lives in ways that claim action. 46 Schäfer, Analytic Attitude, pp. 242, 1 12. 47 Schafer, New Language, p. 36 1 . 48 Schäfer, Narrative Actions, p. 4.</page><page sequence="23">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 573 realize how much has always depended on what they have made of these factors, whether they be family constellations, traumas, infirmities, losses, or sexual anatomy.49 In support of his argument that the "person as agent has always stood at the center of psychoanalytic understanding," Schäfer refers to Freud's well-known demonstrations of unconscious intentionality in actions previously seen as random or causally determined (slips of the tongue are the most obvious example).50 To claim, as Schäfer does, that action language is the "native tongue" of psychoanalysis and provides "the locutions of insight" seems, in fact, to involve a serious foreshortening of both psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, a reduction of each to what is really but one of its possible modes. For, as seems obvious enough on reflection, psychoanalytic explanations do often move in the opposite direction- as was the case with Freud's equally characteristic demonstrations of the role played by unconscious, quasi-causal factors in acts generally assumed to be purely the result of conscious rationality or volition. There also seems little plausibility to the idea that therapy should always bring about a greater acceptance on the patient's part of responsibility for actions. Certainly, this is sometimes and even often true. But there are many patients who come into treatment with an exaggerated or misplaced sense of responsibility or guilt and who need to diminish such feelings. There are also patients who feel alienated from their emotions and actions precisely because they have too great a tendency to experience these emotions and actions as involving volition and arbitrary choice.51 49 Schäfer, Analytic Attitude, d. 107. 50 Schafer, New Language, p. 361. Such patients, who often have significant "schizoid" traits, may need to feel that their experiences are grounded in something more substantial than their own choices or whims; contrary to Schafer's general recommendation, they hardly need to recognize even their emotions as being "actions" in Schafer's sense (Analytic Attitude, p. 102). Such a therapeutic approach would run into the problem described by Johnson: "The alienated person has already 'solved* the problem of subject-object relatedness by</page><page sequence="24">574 SOCIAL RESEARCH That Schafer should be so one-sided in his emphasis can be seen as a reflection of both the Cartesianism and the Kantianism of his assumptions. Whereas the Cartesianism prevents him from imagining a third way between (or beyond) mechanism and voluntarism, the Kantianism makes him embrace, as somehow truer and more virtuous, one of these Cartesian alternatives to the (almost) complete exclusion of the other.52 Schäfer has, in fact, been accused of fostering a subtly moralistic kind of psychotherapy, an implicitly antagonistic relationship in which the patient is likely to feel criticized and held responsible.53 Though Schäfer, naturally enough, has denied that this is his intention, one can see how his Cartesian/Kantian presuppositions might subtly, and perhaps ineluctably, have led to such a position. Schafer does admit on occasion that agency can be overemphasized, that the relentless use of action language could involve an overly "guilty or omnipotent discourse."54 But, not surprisingly, he fails to elaborate on this important point, whose implication would call into question the whole thrust of his argument.55 To reducing everything to a fusion of subject and object within himself. Regrettably, an existentialist procedure which reinforces this solution only leads to the reification of separateness, despair and hopelessness": F. Johnson, "The Existential Psychotherapy of Alienated Persons," in The Narcissistic Condition (New York, 1977), p. 149. Also see Heidegger's essay, "The Age of World View," which argues that this subjectivization of reality is one of the most pervasive and problematic themes of modern culture: M. Heidegger, The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays (New York, 1971). 52 Despite Schafer's claims (in New Language and Analytic Attitude) of a deep affinity with the thought of the later Wittgenstein, both Schafer's implicit Cartesianism and the one-sidedness of his action language set him apart from this antimetaphysical philosopher. For an excellent discussion of this point, see R. Meares, "Metaphor and Reality: A Response to Roy Schäfer," Contemporary Psychoanalysis 21 (1985): 425-448, and Schafer's wholly inadequate reply, "A Response to Meares." 53 See D.

The negative and, in some ways, self-vitiating implications of the autonomous stance emerge most clearly when one recog- nizes that the natural world exists not just outside but also within the person- in the form of those biological processes that give rise to desires and physical sensations. Hegel, who was strongly drawn to the expressivist ideal, criticized Kant on just these grounds. In his view, the Kantian ideal demanded a kind of self-enslavement, since it enjoined man to assert his freedom not just with regard to the outer world but also with regard to his own inner inclinations. If nature within had to be subjected to rigorous control, this meant that the Kantian "autonomous" man "carries his Lord in himself, yet at the same time is his own slave."56 Such an internal division between a controlling and a controlled part of the self was, of course, anathema to the expressivists; for them, true "freedom" could inhere only in the spontaneous unfolding of a unified organic being. What is perhaps less obvious is how this mode of selfhood can undermine something central to the autonomous aspira- tion itself- namely, its own valorizing of the unity of the self (which is implicit in Schafer's concept of the "unitary, fully responsible agent"). Hegel thought that the feeling of being a single, integral self would necessarily conflict with the aspiration to absolute autonomy; he argued that the integral mode of selfhood- he called it "simple, placid conscious- rather than to be willed? On this point, see William James's famous discussion of willing oneself to get out of bed in Principles of Psychology (New York, 1890), p. 524; also Merleau-Ponty's penetrating critique of the notion of freedom, The Phenomenology of Perception (London, 1962), pp. 434-456. In an attempt to capture this truth about human existence, the hermeneutic philosopher Gadamer, a disciple of Heidegger, uses the image of being caught up in and, in a sense, controlled by, a game that one plays: Truth and Method (New York, 1984), pp. 91-98. 56 Hegel, quoted in Taylor, Hegel, p. 60.</page><page sequence="26">576 SOCIAL RESEARCH ness"- would necessarily feel too limiting, too tainted with the kind of substantiality and inertia that characterizes the physical universe. Therefore, argued Hegel, the unchecked press toward the expression of the autonomy of consciousness would lead to a rapid shifting among many different roles, each of them experienced not as a true identity but as a mere mask. For this reason, the aspiration toward total autonomy would lead not to the experience of being "a unitary, fully responsible agent" but to the "self-estrangement" and self-fragmentation of what Hegel called "disintegrated consciousness."57 At first glance, Schafer's protests against psychoanalytic reification might seem to place him squarely in opposition to these self-objectifying, self-alienating, and self-fragmenting trends. After all, instead of allowing the patient to treat his own experiences as thing-like objects of contemplation that operate independently of the observing or controlling self, Schäfer reminds us of the process-like nature of psychological events, and of their intrinsic oneness with the acting subject.58 And, against the divided self of, say, the psychoanalytic structural hypothesis (with its id, ego, and superego), Schäfer insists on the "unitary, fully responsible agent." On closer consideration, however, one discovers in action language the potentiality for the negative and self-contradictory conse- quences criticized by Hegel and others of an expressivist persuasion. Schäfer does not overtly argue for the domination of the passions by reason, nor for disengagement from the self or detachment from external moral sources- the elements of the Cartesian/Kantian project. However, his insistence on active over passive modes of experience and on admitting one's nearly hegemonic agency amount to much the same thing. What, after all, is the likely effect of this relentless claiming of 57 Hegel's phrases are quoted in Trilling, Sincerity and Authenticity, p. 45; also see pp. 26-53. 3W Schafer, New Language, p. 147.</page><page sequence="27">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 577 responsibility* this denial or downplaying of the automaticity, natural inertia, or objective grounding of action and experi- ence? Is it not something akin to the Cartesian project of self-mastery- a project that, as Taylor says, "calls on me to be aware of my activity of thinking or my processes of habitua- tion," and that "demands that we stop simply living in the body or within our traditions or habits, and by making them objects for us, subject them to radical scrutiny and remaking"?59 Schafer's position encourages the vision of a self in ultimate control, relentlessly "claiming" responsibility even for its dreams, desires, and emotional responses, and becoming explicitly aware of its own role as interpreter in all that it experiences. An expressivist might wonder if any actual increase in self-mastery is likely to come about from this semantic and conceptual shift toward the autonomous vision of the self. (How, for example, could action language make one in fact any less the witness and more the author of one's dreams?) It does, however, seem that external reality might come to feel subjectivized, and one's social and physical being alienated, when so much emphasis is put on realizing the extent to which we are, as Schäfer says, "authors of our own existence." Thus while Schäfer, like Kant, may seem to be offering a reunification of the self with itself, the danger is that his aggrandizement of the self-as-agent may actually encour- age a further isolation and self-alienation, and a sense of the weightlessness and foreignness of the physical and social worlds. Kohut's "Self Psychology" If Schäfer is the defender of the Cartesian/Kantian concept of selfhood, emphasizing autonomy, self-control, and respon- sibility, Kohut is the champion of the expressivist self, 59 Taylor, "The Moral Topography of the Self."</page><page sequence="28">578 SOCIAL RESEARCH emphasizing organic wholeness, empathie union, and self- expression.60 As we shall see, this is apparent in the theoretical presuppositions underlying both the descriptive and prescrip- tive aspects of self psychology. Although Shafer and Kohut share an aversion to the traditional psychoanalytic "metapsychology," they differ in the nature of their objections. As we have seen, for Schafer the essential problem is the tendency for metapsychological explanation, in both its mechanistic and anthropomorphic variants, to deny or underplay the role of the patient's intention, volition, and responsibility in favor of deterministic interpretations. Kohut's main criticism, by contrast, derives from his commitment to the ideal of empathy; the issue of freedom versus determinism hardly arises. He faults metapsy- chology for its tendency, both in theory and in therapy, to slight the empathie description of the patient's lived experience in favor of a mode of explanation that is abstract, detached, and, in many instances, Procrustean- for the fact that its concepts are, as he says, "experience-distant" rather than "experience- near." As is well known, Kohut sees failures of empathy as the essential source of psychopathology, and the provision of appropriate empathy as the essence of a psychotherapeutic cure. However, in addition to being the sine qua non of healthy maturation and effective psychotherapy, empathy is also, for him, the key element in scientific observation. Thus, in the central statement of his later theory, Restoration of the Self, Kohut associates the full development of his self psychology with complete acceptance of "the fact that the psychological field is defined by the observer's commitment to the introspective-empathic approach." He criticizes traditional psychoanalysis's adoption of the Enlightenment ideal of 60 Heinz Kohut's most important works are: The Analysis of the Self (New York, 1971); The Restoration of the Self (New York, 1977); and How Does Analysis Cure? (Chicago, 1984).</page><page sequence="29">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 579 scientific objectivity, with its separation of subject from object, and faults Freud for having "gazed at man's inner life with the objectivity of an external observer."61 Kohut's dissent from the objectivism of the traditional Cartesian epistemology is firmly in the expressivist tradition, since he calls for overcoming divisions both between subject and object and within the subject himself. For the Enlighten- ment tradition, knowledge requires distance and the recogni- tion of difference: one must stand back from one's object and refrain from making those anthropomorphizing projections that Bacon called "the idols of the mind." Kohut's views, in contrast, are reminiscent of Counter-Enlightenment and romantic claims that man can know only that which resembles him and with which he can identify (e.g., Vico).62 Thus Kohut emphasizes that knowledge requires a mutual intertwining or fusion of subject and object, since the observer cannot even "see" his object of study- the consciousness of an other- unless he empathically enters into the other's experience and observes as if from within (he calls this "vicarious introspection"63) . As is characteristic of expressivists in general, Kohut insists that this knowing from within cannot be a purely cognitive process. A confluence of feeling and intellect is required if the observer is to bridge the gap separating him from the other and to fully appreciate (or, in the case of therapy, to enhance) the essential unity of the other's existence. For this reason, Kohut criticizes the narrowness of the traditional psychoana- lytic "commitment to truth" and to "the primacy of knowledge- 61 Kohut, Restoration, pp. xiii, 67; How Does Analysis Cure?, p. 174. Kohut quotes a letter to Binswanger in which Freud wrote that "consciousness is after all only a sensory organ," a statement which Kohut sees as "the statement of the man who has become all vision and vision-explaining thought ... of the man of clear-eyed empirical observation whose mental processes are engaged in the service of his proud realism" (Restoration, pp. 66, 67). 62 See Berlin, "Counter-Enlightenment"; also Abrams, Mirror and Lamp. 03 Kohut, How Does Analysis Cure?, p. 82.</page><page sequence="30">580 SOCIAL RESEARCH expansion values."64 In his view, the goals both of understand- ing and of curing the patient require the analyst to be "less reserved" and more "emotionally available," to "respond with deeply reverberating understanding and resonant emo- tionality."65 Equal in importance to Kohut's emphasis on empathy is his reliance on organicist and developmental models. Thus Kohut describes the development of personality as involving a "spontaneously unrolling sequence of transferences" or "the unrolling of a specific epigenetic sequence" of stages of selfhood. Like any biological organism, the Kohutian self supposedly "aims towards the realization of its own specific program of action."66 And, as with any instance of organic growth, this most fundamental process cannot be understood solely through mechanistic causes operating from behind; a ideological element is clearly involved.67 We can clarify this expressivist vision, and how it fundamentally differs from the autonomous one, if we consider one of Schafer's criticisms of Kohut. Schäfer has criticized Kohut for not sufficiently emphasiz- ing the agency, responsibility, and unity of the analysand.68 In his view, "mechanism lingers on" in several aspects of self psychology -such as in Kohut's tendency to reify the "self" by ascribing to it the independence of a drive or a propulsion, and in his tendency to forget the necessary unity of the person by speaking of autonomously acting subselves (such as the 64 Kohut, Restoration, pp. 65, 66. 65 Kohut, How Does Analysis Cure?, pp. 81-82. 66 Ibid., p. 6; Restoration, p. 35; H. Kohut and E. S. Wolf, "The Disorders of the Self and their Treatment," International Journal of Psychoanalysis 59 (1978): 413-425. b7 Kohut contrasts self psychology with classical psychoanalysis on this issue ot a teleological emphasis: "classical psychoanalysis discovered the despair of the child in the depth of the adult . . . self psychology has discovered the despair of the adult in the depth of the child- the actuality of the future. The child whose self is stunted by the selfobject's failure is, in his depression, mourning an unlived, unfulfilled future": Kohut, Self Psychology and the Humanities (New York, 1985), pp. 74-75. 68 R. Schäfer, "Action Language and the Psychology of the Seit, Annual of Psychoanalysis 8 (1980): 86, 90.</page><page sequence="31">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 581 "grandiose self").69 If, however, one bears in mind the organicism central to Kohut's perspective, one can readily understand why Kohut would not emphasize the kind of agency and responsibility implied in action language. After all, in sharp contrast with Schafer's Cartesianism, where the only alternatives are determinism or an at least quasi-volitional intentionality, Kohut's emphasis is on precisely those processes that dissolve this dualism: developmental processes that are purposive without necessarily being purposeful, where there is goal-directedness without conscious volition or the responsibil- ity this would imply. It would obviously not be appropriate to speak of such developmental sequences as purposeful actions, to be explained by reference to "reasons" and as the products of a "unitary, fully responsible agent."70 But to call this "mechanism," as Schäfer does, quite misses the point, since it categorizes Kohut's approach in the terms of the dualism of an alien root metaphor- Cartesianism. In an expressivist/orga- nicist universe such as Kohut's, the question of claiming or disclaiming responsibility for actions- Schafer's central issue- either dissolves as conceptually incoherent or recedes to become an issue of minor importance. It should not be thought, however, that Kohut's position is any less value-laden or moralizing than Schafer's. All world- views have their ethical dimension, their own notion, explicit or implicit, of what is "normal," "healthy," or "good." In self psychology, however, such notions are not bound up with 69 Incidentally, Schäfer ("Action Language and the Psychology of the Self") says that this lingering "mechanism" keeps Kohut from attaining his own goal of being truly "experience-near"; here Schäfer seems to assume that action-descriptions more accurately capture the feel of lived-experience, as if experience were generally felt-as-intentional. However, when faced with the fact that, in everyday life, people often spontaneously describe themselves in ways that disclaim action (Analytic Attitude, p. 92), Schäfer takes the position that we should not feel any obligation "to use unsystematically the terms of experience to explain experience"; rather, he claims, one should opt for an action-language description, which, supposedly, is more valid than the person's own spontaneous self-description. Here we clearly see Schafer's metaphysical biases overriding his phenomenological predilections. 70 Schäfer, Analytic Attitude, p. 246.</page><page sequence="32">582 SOCIAL RESEARCH issues of responsibility and self-control but with the aspiration toward self-expression, toward the organic unfolding or actualization of the inner essence of the individual. The "good," we might say, is this inner essence itself, and anything that fosters its natural unfolding; the "bad" (or the "unnat- ural") is anything that halts or inhibits this spontaneous process. Thus, whereas the implicit moralizing of Schafer seems to point a finger back at the self, in Kohut's case, as with all forms of expressivism, the finger of blame points outward, toward the family, the insensitive therapist, or other representatives of the social order. In Kohut's case, in fact, this blaming can be quite explicit and harsh. He indicts the social order for failing to provide "self-cohesion maintaining self objects"- that is, interpersonal experiences in which the inner life of the child is mirrored or otherwise responded to empathically.71 Despite Kohut's idea that "optimal frustration" encourages the "transmuting internalizations" of progressively more mature selfobjects, he directs his criticisms overwhelmingly against the dangers of frustration rather than those of overindulgence. Thus Kohut chastizes therapists who show "even the faintest trace of disapproval"72 (and not, of course, on the classical psychoanalytic grounds that they should be blank screens). Kohut also criticizes a confrontative approach in psychother- apy as tending to be "trite, superfluous, and experienced as patronizing." In contrast with analysts like Otto Kernberg who would confront the "unrealistic" and exaggerated perceptions of the patient, Kohut claims to have found that the patient is generally right, and he states that one of his patients was correct to insist that Kohut, the therapist, "see things exclusively in his way and not at all in my way."73 For self psychology, then, virtue resides not in "reality-principle 71 See R.

In his view, central elements of therapy like transference and termination are "predeter- mined," and "correct psychoanalytic technique can do no more than allow it to evolve."75 (The "normal," writes Kohut, is "that which functions according to its [own] design."76) Kohut's expressivist biases are clearly evident in this faith in an inner self that seems able to do no wrong. He explicitly states that the productivity, fulfillment, or creativity of the "inner program . . . the pattern of the nuclear self" does "not refer primarily to the values of society."77 We should not, therefore, be surprised to find Kohut taking as his paradigm of human fulfillment that standard expressivist ideal, the creative artist as conceived by the romantic tradition. By the end of the eighteenth century, the notion of art as essentially mimetic and communicative- a portrayal of external reality for an audience of like-minded individuals- had given way to a new conception; increasingly, art was seen as a form of 74 H.

Also see Ehrlich, "Social Dimensions," pp. 334, 337. 75 Kohut, Restoration, p. 49. Several aspects of Kohut's expressivism are evident in his defense of "action-thought," activities which more traditional analysts would see as mere "acting-out," i.e., as ways of "regressing" to motor activity in an attempt to avoid the insight that, for them, is the true source of a cure. In Kohut's view, such actions "are not regressive steps; they constitute a not-quite-but-almost-completed forward movement" (Restoration, p. 37). Kohut's position on this issue illustrates his expressivist faith in the spontaneous processes of the self; also it represents a refusal to valorize consciousness as against physical activity, which is typical of the Cartesian/Kantian position. 76 Kohut, How Does Analysis Cure?, p. 187. 77 Kohut, Self Psychology and the Humanities, p. 75.</page><page sequence="34">584 SOCIAL RESEARCH ¿¿/f-expression, an actualization of the artist's inner world, which found its justification simply in manifesting itself, rather than through communication with an audience or through depiction of an outer world. Kohut's critique of Freud's conception of mental health relies on such standard expressiv- ist ideals. Thus, while Kohut allows that psychotherapy may increase the capacity for the other-oriented and outer-directed commitments mentioned by Freud- "to love and to work"- Kohut believes that the more essential goal of psychotherapy should be to establish one sector within the realm of the self through which an uninterrupted flow of the narcissistic strivings can proceed toward creative expression- however limited the social impact of the achievements of the personality might be and however insignificant the individual's creative activity might appear to others. Such a sector includes always a central pattern of exhibitionism and grandiose ambitions . . . . 78 I mentioned above the criticism frequently directed at the autonomous form of modern humanism: its tendency to foster a separation from both inner and outer nature, to lead to what Taylor has described as "the sense of fragmentation within, and of exile in a dead, mechanical universe and society."79 As we saw, Schafer's action language seems prone to these problematic consequences. What is perhaps not so obvious is the potential for a certain isolation of self inherent in the expressivist aspiration, a potential strongly felt by many in the romantic and postromantic tradition of Western culture and which seems to be implicit in self psychology. (Erich Heller has described "the romantic malady" as "a severance of mind from world, soul from circumstance, human inwardness from 78 Kohut, Restoration, p. 54.

Consequently, the meaning of the external world is, in a sense, determined by its relationship to this inner essence, which it must either echo or remain estranged from. I have already mentioned how, from the expressivist point of view, the social world tends, because of its artificiality and its indifference, to be seen as alien from and in opposition to the self. This attitude is likely to be encouraged by self psychology's emphasis on the grievous consequences of the failure of selfobjects and its implicit validating of a critical attitude toward the social world. It would seem that such a vision might foster and justify a sense of isolation from those aspects of the environment that fail to "mirror" the inner life of the patient. A common criticism of expressivism is that when this is not the case, when the external world is not felt to be somehow in opposition to the self, this is because its very externality or difference has in fact been effaced. Thus expressivism has sometimes been seen as running a risk opposite to that of Cartesianism- as encouraging not a diremption but a too-easy fusion of the inner and outer or the mental and the physical. Many critics of nineteenth-century romanticism believed, for example, that the romantics had been too eager to overcome the cleavage between man and nature. According to these critics, this led the romantics to indulge the "pathetic fallacy," the naive, facile, and uncritical "attributing [of] life, emotion and physiognomy to objects of the physical world"81 - culminating in the loose sentimentality that the antiromantic critic T.E. Hulme (1883-1917) once derided as "the state of 80 E.

The negative side of this yearning for fusion between man and world was not just a certain scientific and moral weak-mindedness. What we might call an overemphasis on assimilation and neglect of accommodation also had the self-contradictory result of exaggerating man's sense of isolation. For if the world was too readily humanized, its very otherness was being effaced- and therefore the self of romantic expressivism did not so much commune with the world as subsume it. Any feeling of connectedness would thus be little more than a disguised expression of that essential and all-encompassing inwardness which has so often been re- marked about romanticism. A similar overemphasis on assimilation at the expense of accommodation also seems characteristic of Kohut. Often, for example, he is concerned to defend and valorize early infantile states of fusion ("primary narcissism," in the psychoanalytic vocabulary) against those who would see such states as pathological or merely regressive. Thus Kohut insists that the primal experience of oneness never really ceases, and that, far from being shameful, the yearning for the "old reassurance of a merger bond" or an "oceanic feeling and cosmic narcissism" are human universais and constants, and particularly salient in the glorified "creative" person.83 I would not question that Kohut's point is valid in many re- spects, and that it may serve as a useful corrective to the ego- psychological tendency to glorify separation and realism. But one must also recognize the dangers of this valorization of as- 82 Quoted in W. J. Bate, ed., Criticism: The Major Texts (New York, 1952), p. 560. 83 D.

If ac- cepted too uncritically, the insights of self psychology, like those of romanticism, run the risk of degenerating into a rather sub- jectivist and egocentric worldview. For it would seem that such a vision could easily foster a sense of isolation from those external objects that fail to mirror the inner life of the patient while, at the same time, making those objects that do feel connected with the self seem, in a sense, to have lost their very quality of otherness (since they would be experienced as self objects). One might say, then, that if the danger of action language is that it may entail a burdensome sense of isolation, responsibility, and arbitrariness, that of self psychology is to waver between two states: resentment of an indifferent outer world and a "pathetic" ignoring and as- similation of its otherness. Humanistic Psychoanalysis: Schäfer and Kohut The expressivist yearning for unity between the self and the natural world does place expressivism in conflict with radical autonomy, for the latter ideal aims to accentuate and valorize a fundamental distinction between human consciousness and the natural world. As we have seen, this opposition between expression and autonomy is reflected in the rather different conceptions of the goals and processes of psychotherapy espoused by Kohut and Schäfer, as well as in the different dangers to which each system is prone. It would, however, be a mistake to ignore the important ways in which the two projects are similar. After all, both Schäfer and Kohut react profoundly against what they perceive to be the oppressive or devitalizing implications of a homogenizing mechanism or quasi-materialism that would deny to man his goal-directedness and his freedom- a position that both theorists associate with the reductionistic and reifying</page><page sequence="38">588 SOCIAL RESEARCH tendencies of classical psychoanalysis and ego psychology. Both men are uncomfortable with the postulating of elaborate metapsychological schémas onto which the lived events of the clinical encounter are mapped; and both reject or downplay the role of universal, instinctual forces (especially aggression) that might be seen as the external causes or primal sources of human experience and action. Both deemphasize extensive exploration of a deep and hidden unconscious or of a distant and presumably deterministic past in favor of experiences that are more present and more conscious- "experience-near," in Kohut's phrase. These similarities can be understood as manifestations of their shared commitment to the characteris- tically modern aspiration toward self-defining subjectivity- an aspiration that, as discussed above, conflicts not only with the (protomodern) mechanistic denial of the relevance or reality of meaning but also with the premodern locating of the source of meaning outside man. Taylor has described this modern notion of selfhood as involving what he calls "radical reflexivity," a quasi-solipsistic stress on the first-person perspective, on the importance of recognizing that this experience is my experience.84 For Kohut, heir to the tradition of self-exploration and self-expression, this emphasis on the first-person quality of experience shows up largely in the importance accorded to the uniqueness and the innerness of experience. For Schäfer, heir to the tradition of autonomy and self-control, the first-person quality involves not primarily innerness or uniqueness but, rather, agency- a sense of doing or having done. The two theorists are alike in emphasizing the integrity or cohesiveness of the self, the importance of recognizing and fostering one's sense of the self's distinctness and inner unity. Both recommend what Jacques Derrida (an outspoken "poststructuralist" opponent of such a goal) has called "the 84 Taylor, "Moral Topography of the Self."</page><page sequence="39">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 589 self-presence of the present in the living present,"85 that is, a certain coinciding of the self with the self, through recognizing and heightening the sense of çohesiveness, of innerness, or of agency. The visions of self psychology and action language seem, then, to be congruent in their tendency to aggrandize the self at the expense of the world. For both schools, the correct attitude- and the one held out as a source of psychological health- directs attention inward and not toward ideals, realities, or determinants outside the self. This tendency is apparent in Schafer's frequent stressing of the subject's active participation in his "construing" of his world. Thus Shafer writes that "more and more the alleged past must be experienced consciously [by the patient] as a mutual interpénétration of past and present," and that in psychotherapy "The time is always present. The event is always an ongoing dialogue."86 Such an emphasis seems likely to subjectivize the sense of reality, both for the analyst or theorist and for the patient in treatment. Similarly, Kohut's emphasis on "selfobjects" encourages one to focus not on the world as it is "in-itself " but insofar as it echoes or mirrors the self. In interpreting dreams, for example, Kohut advocates an approach that views dreams as being, in essence, symbols of self states.87 The radical reflexivity of Ko- hut's vision of human nature is, however, most apparent in his central concept of empathy, which he variously defines as "vi- carious introspection" and as "the recognition of the self in the other."88 The essential inwardness of this conception of expe- rience (i.e., of the experience that one is attempting to grasp) is apparent if one contrasts it with the notion of "being-in-the- world" adopted by existential-phenomenological philosophers 85 J.

Sartre has described most vividly the outer-directed, object-intending phe- nomenological conception of human existence: "If per impossi- ble, you entered consciousness, you would be seized by a whirl- wind and thrown outside near the tree in the dust for consciousness has no 'within'."89 One wonders whether the self- psychological conception of human existence could actually en- courage a certain introversion: might a therapist who empathi- cally hovers over experience which he conceives as being essen- tially introspective not be likely to increase rather than diminish the patient's sense of inwardness, uniqueness, and isolation?90 The special qualities of both these "humanist" psychotherapies can, incidentally, be foregrounded by contrasting them with the modes of therapy prevalent in many non- Western cultures: for example, the duty-oriented and gratitude-inducing therapies of modern Japan; or the shamanistic treatments practiced (by all accounts, rather successfully) in the Amazon- where the patient's experience is assimilated to the préexistent and shared forms of myth, rather than having its uniqueness or innerness accentuated.91 One potential problem with the positions of both Schäfer and Kohut is one that afflicts all modern variants of self-defining subjectivity: they can lead to an "unbearable lightness of being," a feeling of lacking any solid grounding in a larger, encompass- ing, and external world or in transcendent values. For if one dispenses with, or deemphasizes, the past, the instincts, the unconscious, and the metapsychological apparatus- as do both 89J.-P.

If one no longer moves inward toward a metapsycho- logical schema felt as real, nor backward toward a past felt as solid, nor downward toward the unconscious and the instincts, what is left as the goal of one's exploration? The danger of these psychotherapies, then, is that they will contribute to rather than help overcome the conditions so often depicted in con- temporary fiction: the "breakdown of connection between the self and an engageable social milieu, the fading into each other of subjective perception and objective reality." In his book on recent fiction, John Aldridge describes how the "disappearance of all other modes of authoritative measure" beyond the self has left the artist "encapsulated in a bubble of self-awareness afloat in a void."92 And what another critic has written of Rilke, Stevens, and Valéry- three great poets of our age- could as well be said of these modernist psychologies from which all external reference points tend to fall away: "The most imme- diate datum of experience to be explored appears as an intran- sitive consciousness, unconcerned with outer objects except as counters in the game of positing the self."93 One might say, then, that in psychologies like those of Kohut and Schafer, the shadow of the self has fallen on the world. Subject-centeredness has also been criticized on other grounds: for encouraging a rapacious or possessive individual- ism and an attitude of selfishness and exploitation toward both the natural and social worlds.94 It is easier to understand how this could develop from the autonomous position where, as we have seen, the yearning for absolute freedom sets the self up as against the external and physical world.

The holistic emphasis of the expressivist position, on the other hand, might appear to discourage rampant individualism. It must not be forgotten, however, that expressivism is in fact no less subject-centered; that for it too the essential locus of value and meaning is in the self, not the ambient universe. The essential congruence of Kohut's position with the individualism of modern Western humanism emerges in his valorizing of narcissism (both "primary" and "secondary"), and even more clearly in his declaration that "We should not deny our ambitions, our wish to dominate, our wish to shine," and in his defense of the "current materialistic rationalism in Western culture" for giving "freedom to the enhancement of the self" (as against the value system of the Orient, which "extols altruism and concern for others and disparages egotism and concern for one's self").95 Still other critics of the humanist positions, most notably the French poststructuralists and their followers, have focused on the oppressive potential in the search for the "true self" and in the valorizing of unity and control as attributes of mature self- hood (e.g., Lacan, Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze and Guattari, Lyotard).96 These critics argue that such a self is really only an illusion; and further, that such a search may actually be a ruse of power- a ruse that, in the guise of liberation, enjoins the person to impose upon himself a consistency that both belies and shackles the actual polymorphousness of human nature. Thus both projects of self-defining subjectivity, which themselves arose in profound reaction against the oppressive or devitalizing implications of mechanism and materialism, 95 Kohut, "Forms and Transformations of Narcissism"; H.

Despite their profound influence in Europe and in avant-garde thought generally, these antihumanistic develop- ments are not familiar to most American psychologists. I would like to conclude this archaeological tour of the psychodynamic avant-garde with brief discussions of two such thinkers. As we shall see, in both cases, their theories involve strong reactions against the devitalizing, burdensome, or isolative implications of the characteristically modern aggrandizement of the self; and, not surprisingly, each incurs problems rather different from those of humanism. One of these antihumanists is Jacques Lacan, the most important of the poststructuralist psychoanalysts and a major influence on much "postmod- ernist" thought. The other, whom I shall consider first, is James Hillman, perhaps best described as a post-Jungian. Hillman adopts not a postmodernist but a primitivist vision of the no-self doctrine, calling for a return to a polytheistic and pagan concept of the psyche- or better, of the soul. Hillman' s "Archetypal Psychology9' Hillman's most important book, Re-Visioning Psychology, begins with an attack on the separation of subjectivity and matter characteristic of the modern worldview.97 This is one source of the affinity he feels between his own work and that of Counter-Enlightenment, romantic, and postromantic fig- ures like Vico, Schelling, Coleridge, and Dilthey- all of whom also rejected Enlightenment rationalism and dualism. It would, however, be wrong to consider Hillman an expressivist; his 97 In Hillman's opinion, this vision is rooted not only in Cartesianism but also in Christianity's rejection of pantheism and insistence that the only carrier of soul is the human person.</page><page sequence="44">594 SOCIAL RESEARCH position is actually more congruent with the worldview that preceded the seventeenth century's scientific revolution. Thus Hillman explicitly associates himself with certain classical, medieval, and early Renaissance thinkers- like Plato, Plotinus, and Ficino- and his psychology calls for the emergence of the Renaissance man who lives with us still, in our dreams. Hillman's "archetypal psychology" is, as he says, not a humanism,98 and his perspective is antithetical to the positions of Schäfer and Kohut- those champions of the unitary, self-defining subject who seek the source of meaning within. In Hillman's view, the true basis of human fulfillment is not self-expression or autonomy but the suppressed yet ever- present yearning-outward toward a disparate assortment of personifications felt as external. Thus he quotes the third century a.d. philosopher Plotinus, the greatest of the Platon- ists, who thought that "those ancient sages, who sought to secure the presence of divine beings by the erection of shrines and statues, showed insight into the nature of the All."99 In Hillman's view, what modern man needs is not a liberation from graven images and toward the self-presence of radical reflexivity, but the provision of a richer and more vital pantheon in which to lose himself. One might say, in fact, that for Hillman it is iconoclasm which is the height of oppression. "Iconoclasm" here should, of course, be taken in the literal sense- as the breaking of those idols of the mind, the reified paraphernalia of metapsychology found so offensive by Schaf er and Kohut, those champions of the "experience-near." For this reason, the very elements of traditional psychoanal- ysis that most offend a critic like Schäfer are precisely its strength to Hillman. In his view, all psychology is inevitably and appropriately driven by the "will to believe"- "sexuality," "humanism," or "self" are idols like any others. Further, the problem of modern man is that he gives too little, not too 98 J. Hillman, Re-Vùioning Psychology (New York, 1975), pp. xi, 224, 29-30, 171, 173.

What is needed is not, however, the "abstract, quantitative, and topographical concepts" of objectiv- ist or mechanistic psychology, but "an inscape of personified images," a "fostering of images" for the "portions and phases" of a soul in touch with its own disparateness. Therefore, for Hillman, unlike for Schäfer, Freud was declaring a strength, not admitting a weakness, when he wrote that "The theory of instincts is, as it were, our mythology. The instincts are mythical beings, superb in their indefiniteness." Hillman praises those independently operating personifications and reifications of traditional psychoanalytic metapsychology: "the Censor, the Superego, the Primal Horde and the Primal Scene" as well as libido and thanatos, projection, sublimation, and condensation- notions that, for him, have the pleasing ring of Greek mythology and medieval alchemy.100 In a display of his powerful if rather purplish prose, Hillman calls for a pantheism rekindled by the psyche's belief in its personified images . . . space to receive the mass immigration, the resurrection of the repressed, as the Angels and Archons, Daemons and Nymphs, Powers and Substances, Virtues and Vices, released from the mental reservations that restrain such primitivenesses and from the conceptual prisons of small-letter descriptions, now return to enter again into the commerce of our daily lives.101 In sharp contrast with Schafer's action-language emphasis on "owning" one's experiences, Hillman says that [the] autonomy of fantasy is the soul's last refuge of dignity, its guarantor against all oppressions .... If we are willing to accept internal controls upon the imagination, we will have succumbed already in soul to the same authoritarianism that would dominate the body politic.102 Hillman might seem somewhat closer to Kohut the 100 Ibid., pp. 228, 37, 19, 23, 225; Freud quoted on pp. 19, 17-19. 101 Ibid., p. 42. 102 Ibid., p. 39.</page><page sequence="46">596 SOCIAL RESEARCH expressivist, since, for both these writers, the unconscious has its own telos, which must be respected and given free rein. The crucial difference is that, in Hillman's conception, this telos is not unitary; nor is it some unique or inner process that belongs to me. ("[T]his meness is not mine," he writes.103) Hillman emphasizes, in fact, that the very feeling of individuality is an illusion, the deceiving precipitate of archetypal experiences of "anima" and "soul" (the "personalistic fallacy"). For this reason, he recommends something very different from Kohutian empathy, a technique closer to the shaman's listening through a veil of mythic, transpersonal meaning: You have to listen for what's going on with an ear that is not attuned to the same wavelength as the patient's story. There's a jarring, a discomfort. It's not supportive understanding and sympathetic being in tune. It's more a curious hearing things differently.104 It is hard to imagine a more eloquent spokesman for this premodern perspective. But, much as one may admire Hillman's attempt, it must be admitted that his Dionysian flight from mod- ern alienation is, in a way, as unbalanced as Kohut's and Scha- fer's exaggerated humanism- though the risks it poses are rather different. One danger- difficult to deny given the twentieth cen- tury's disastrous experiences with irrationalist ideologies- is that such a perspective can turn into an uncontrolled, destructive, and perhaps authoritarian irrationalism. The other, rather different flaw in Hillman's approach is one that is likely to keep it from ever taking hold. Archetypal psychology ultimately founders on the same contradictions as afflict any attempt to foster a religious or magical worldview in the modern age of skepticism, scientism, and psychologism. Traditional religious belief does provide a "sacred canopy" of transcendent meanings;105 but the orienting and protective 103 lind., d. 49. 104 J.

Unlike the world views of Schäfer and Kohut- Cartesianism and organicism- the essential animism of Hillman's archetypal psychology blatantly contradicts contemporary scientific assump- tions about both mind and world, and therefore is unlikely to elicit belief, at least among more sophisticated people. Hillman tries to finesse this issue by arguing that explicit cognitive belief in his God and Daemons is not required; that it is sufficient if one is "sensing the soul in the world . . . feeling the world as personified, as emotional."106 But, of course, this argument won't do, since modern man is, if anything, even more cut off from this kind of natural, taken-for-granted embeddedness in an animistic world. In a phrase referring to another manifestation of modern primitivism and ir rationalism, surre- alism, the poet and critic William Empson perfectly captured this ineluctable dilemma of a modern skeptical mind- namely, the ineffectuality of beliefs that are adopted, always with a certain self-consciousness, for the pragmatic or esthetic purpose they may serve: How can one believe, one might ask, "in a nightmare handy as a bike"?107 Lacan9 s Poststructuralism The other champion of an antihumanist and Dionysian alternative to self-defining subjectivity, Jacques Lacan, man- ages to evade this problem of disbelief (though at the expense of other dilemmas no less severe, as we shall see).

Thus, on the one hand, both his position and his literary style encourage a certain voguish skepticism about truth and reality-leaving the impression that it would be either gauche or naive to demand a clear or testable account of his views. On the other hand, however, Lacan founds his arguments on a rather dogmatic acceptance of a quasi-metaphysical system, the "structuralism" derived from modern linguistics.108 It is often forgotten that Lacan was originally a member of the surrealist circle, publishing his first articles in their journal Minotaure. As we shall see, his aspirations remained much the same as those of the surrealists. It seems, however, that Lacan sensed the fatal flaw of surrealist irrationalism, for he developed his own irrationalism on the basis of more up-to-date and "scientific" principles. Lacan did not see the unconscious as a cauldron bubbling with archaic fears and desires, nor as a theater of personified images; he conceived it in the terms of contemporary semiotics, as the crossing-place of vast formal systems. In contrast with Hillman's animism and polytheism, as well as with the primitivism of the surrealists (who were fascinated by alchemy, magic, and "savage" culture, and sought a lost "language of innocence, a renewal of the primordial pact"109), Lacan's belief system is at least superfi- cially consistent with the scientific or scientistic assumptions of modern culture and is not, therefore, liable to provoke skepticism for being a merely "convenient" belief. There are two crucial aspects of Lacan's Byzantine complex of theories that must be considered. The first, that pertaining to what he calls the "Mirror Stage" and "The Imaginary," is, from our point of view, a negative argument, a way of accounting for the illusion of controlled, integral selfhood. The 108 Lacan's most important translated works are Ecrits (New York, 1977), and The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis (New York, 1978). 109 O. Paz, Alternating Current (New York, 1973), p. 50.</page><page sequence="49">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 599 second, pertaining to "The Symbolic," concerns Lacan's positive, if rather paradoxical, account of the true nature of selfhood (or the lack thereof).110 According to Lacan's notion of the mirror stage, there is a moment or period of development when the young child, first recognizing himself in the mirror, is thrilled to identify with an image of what looks to be an integral and controlled person. As Lacan conceives it, the infant at this stage (somewhere between the eighth and eighteenth month) does not yet have actual control over its own actions, or an actual sense of the unity of its own sensations: it is still "sunk in motor incapacity, turbulent movements, and fragmentation"- that is, still experiencing what he calls the corps morcelé (the body-in-parts).111 Precisely for this reason, the infant is, as it were, seduced into an illusory iden- tification with its own reflection, for only there does it glimpse a unity that it cannot actually live. Lacan sees this moment as the true source of the sense of the unified, authentic self so often glorified by humanistic psychologies and sought by indi- viduals in Western culture. But the ironic truth which this La- canian fable is meant to teach is that the "true self" is both false and inauthentic; not only does the illusion of integral selfhood originate in a masking of an actual fragmentation (the corps morcelé), it does so by means of a certain alienation: for the source of a sense of self is, after all, a mirrored image at a distance, a being who stands outside the self, like an other (i.e., as a moi, not aje; self-as-object rather than self-as-subject). Ac- cording to Lacan, integral selfhood is, therefore, founded on both alienation and illusion: "the assumption of the armour of an alienating identity, which will mask with its rigid structure the subject's entire mental development."112 1 10 For discussions of these notions in Lacan, see F. Jameson, "Imaginary and Symbolic in Lacan," Yale French Studies 55/56, pp. 338-395; and E. Ragland-Sullivan, lacaues Lacan and the Philosoöhx of Psxchoanalxsis (Urbana and Chicacro. 1986V 111 See Lacan, Ecrits, pp. 1-7; W. j.

What Octavio Paz has said of modern poetry ap- plies perfectly to Lacan (as well as capturing the difference be- tween him and Hillman): "Language now occupies the place once occupied by the gods or some other external entity or out- ward reality."113 Thus Lacan, like most structuralists and post- structuralists, imagines language as a preexisting structure of intersystemic rules so constraining as to deny to the speaker any possibility of freedom or originality, and to the discourse any possibility of reference to a world beyond the system. Language on this account is a kind of prime mover or uncaused cause- a self-referential, self-generated system which must no longer be seen as man's instrument but as the source and limit of his con- sciousness. This can best be grasped if we consider Lacan's ac- count of how language creates the (in a sense, illusory) feeling of being a subject of experience. As Lacan describes it, the sense of being an active subject of experience is bound up with, and fundamentally dependent on, the use of the word "I."114 But, just as the word "I" (known in linguistics as a "shifter") belongs to no one, and moves about among the participants in a conversation, so, in a sense, the feeling of being a self-as-subject is not a transcendent quality that inheres in a person but a fleetingly elusive and merely "grammatical" reality (an "effect of the signifier")- a reality that, as it were, precipitates out of the conversation in this spot or that, but lingering only for a moment before moving on to the next speaker. According to Lacan, then, the sense of being a controlling center of consciousness or a unified source of 113 Paz, Alternating Current, p. 4. 114 See W. J. Richardson, "Lacan and the Subject of Psychoanalysis," in J. H. Smith and W. Kerrigan, eds., Interpreting Lacan (New Haven, 1983).</page><page sequence="51">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 601 causal efficacy is an effect of language, one that, paradoxically enough, can be experienced only if one lets oneself be taken over by this transpersonal system that preexists and transcends one: "I identify myself in language, but only by losing myself in it like an object."115 And so, just as the irony of the moi is that it is born in the self-alienation of visual reflection (in "The Imaginary"), that of the 7* is that it requires one to lose oneself in something quite impersonal, the larger system of language. It follows that the only kind of freedom that reigns in "The Symbolic" (the realm of the subject, the je) is the somewhat paradoxical freedom of automaticity emphasized by the surrealists- freedom not as a (Kantian) seizing of responsibility and control or as the unfettered self-unfolding of expressiv- ism, but as a giving oneself over to the larger systemic flows. It seems, then, that the two great heresies of contemporary psychoanalysis, Kohut's American heresy and Lacan's Conti- nental one, are at polar extremes on the question of the self. For Lacan, the "Self" is the central illusion of "The Imaginary," poised as a fictive moment between the fragmen- tation of the corps morcelé and the infinite elusion of "The Symbolic." In Lacan's view, "the ego is structured exactly like a symptom. Interior to the subject, it is only a privileged symptom. It is the human symptom par excellence, it is the mental malady of man."116 From such a standpoint, self psychology and action language would be but the playing-out and reification of the delusion of the mirror phase- a form of experience that is also self-alienated, though without recogniz- ing this fact at all. The humanistic therapies of Kohut and Schäfer are, on this account, doomed to the continuing reification and pétrification of this "privileged symptom"- and all this, ironically enough, under the guise of liberation and an overcoming of estrangement. From Lacan's standpoint, as 115 Lacan, Ecrits, p. 86. 116 Quoted in J. P. Muller, "Ego and Subject in Lacan," Psychoanalytic Review 69, pp. 234-240.</page><page sequence="52">602 SOCIAL RESEARCH from Hillman's, these psychoanalytic revisionists would, in fact, be the perpetrators of an even more extreme ego psychology- a psychology that, by jettisoning the mechanisms and anthropomorphisms of the "metapsychology" (with its warring part-selves and its cathexes colliding eerily in the dark) rejects all that would allow psychoanalysis to grasp the truly nonvolitional and nonunified aspects of human existence. Lacan, who has said that he is not at all sure man even has an interior, is committed to overcoming the illusion of integral, controlled selfhood, to showing "the self's radical excentricity to itself."117 He interprets Freud's line, "Where id was, there ego shall be" (which he translates as "La ou c'était il me faut advenir"xm)&gt; not as meaning that the ego should replace the id (the standard reading), but that the ego should come to exist in the realm of the id- that is, that it should shed the illusion of integral, controlled selfhood and dissolve into those associative chains normally repressed into the unconscious (and perhaps also into the fragmentary existence of the corps morcelé). In espousing this vision of human nature, Lacan has stayed surprisingly close to his roots in surrealist irrationalism. For, it was André Breton, the high priest of surrealism, who believed that poetic practice demanded the surrender of the ego and who, in 1928, declared the "crucial inadequacy ... of any action which requires a continuous application and which can be premeditated" and celebrated the "great victory of the involuntary over the ravaged domain of conscious possibili- ties," over the "tremulous ennui" of normal consciousness.119 Like Lacan, the surrealists believed that mind was, in a sense, both all-powerful and passive120- a view that obviously disrupts the accepted polarities of the Cartesian worldview (and that conflicts with Schafer's view, as discussed above). 117 Lacan, £mfe, p. 171. 118 See Z.

Like that of many poststructuralists, his position has a quality that seems somewhat paradoxical in the context of the history of Western thought- what one might call a "high-tech irrationalism" or a "Dionysian mechanism." Such poststructur- alists imagine the self as dissolving not into an animist demiurge or biological pulsation but into a quasi-linguistic labyrinth or a mechanical process: into the "host of networks and relations, of contradictory codes and interfering messages" of Jean-François Lyotard,121 or the "desiring-machines" of Deleuze and Guat- tari- the tenor of whose influential book, Anti-Oedipus, can be gleaned from its first several lines: It is at work everywhere, functioning smoothly at times, at other times in fits and starts. It breathes, it heats, it eats. It shits and fucks. What a mistake to have ever said the id. Everywhere it is machines -real ones not figurative ones: machines driving other machines, machines being driven by other machines, with all the necessary couplings and connections.122 This passage from Deleuze and Guattari (who, like Lyotard, have been deeply influenced by Lacan) brings out a somewhat surprising aspect of the poststructuralist perspective- the fact that it is, in certain respects, an application to the human domain of mechanistic or, at least, quasi-mechanistic metaphors.123 1 would argue, in fact, that, just as Hillman can be viewed as escaping modern humanism by returning to the "premodern" worldview, Lacan can be seen as taking a position akin to the homogenizing mechanism of the "protomodern" era. It is true that, in emphasizing language as the crucial locus or 121 F. Jameson, "Foreword," in J.-F.

This does not, however, gainsay the shared quasi-mechanism of their various views of human nature.</page><page sequence="54">604 SOCIAL RESEARCH medium of human existence, Lacan opts for a middle realm, neither inner nor outer, neither spirit nor matter; in this sense, his position is unlike one that would assimilate mind to matter. However, Lacan's opposition to any form of humanism is so intense that he ends up emphasizing only the automatic, deter- ministic aspects of language, as if language lived itself in man and the reverse were not at all true- and this is akin to a ho- mogenizing mechanism.124 1 will leave aside the conceptual prob- lems inherent in this sort of poststructuralism- for example, the unwarranted leap of reasoning from the existence of deep struc- tures to the conclusion that all sense of conscious control is illu- sory or trivial. Let us instead consider some of the consequences such a worldview is likely to have. As with Hillman's system, there seems in Lacanian poststruc- turalism to be a disturbing potentiality for irrationality and authoritarianism- potentialities that, given the obscurantism and the autocratic ways that have characterized the Lacanian movement, seem already to have emerged.125 A second problem is, in a way, the opposite of what we found in Hillman's primitivist psychology. It is not that a sophisticated modern cannot believe in Lacan's attempt to transcend the estrangement and isolation of modern humanism (witness the widespread popularity of Lacan and other forms of poststruc- turalism among intellectuals) but, rather, that his doctrines actually seem liable to exacerbate certain characteristic problems of modernity. For Lacan's version of structuralism would seem to offer at most a Pyrrhic victory: if it overcomes the division between man and world, it does so by effacing both these poles, thereby giving up most of the aspirations of the modern Western tradition. Instead of being reconciled, self and world 124 According to the French philosopher Bouveresse, the essential message of structuralism (and to this one could certainly add poststructuralism) is: Where I was, there the It shall be: Le philosophe chez les autophages (Paris, 1984), p. 160. 125 See the accounts in S. Turkle, Psychoanalytic Politics: Freud's French Revolution (New York, 1978), and F. Roustang, Dire Mastery: Discipleship from Freud to Lacan (Baltimore, 1982).</page><page sequence="55">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 605 simply disappear into the middle term, the language-like structures that replace these supposedly outmoded polarities. Thus freedom and self-expression are given up since the volitional and individual self turns out to be an illusion, a deceiving epiphenomenon of "The Imaginary" and "The Symbolic";126 truth is illusory, since there is no world but what the structures allow to appear; further, as we have seen, the unity that is achieved is a unity devoid of vitality- since it is that of a mechanical rather than organic system. And so perhaps the most that such a perspective could promise is (to borrow Fredric Jameson's suggestion about postmodernism in general): not to overcome alienation but "to make ourselves at home in our alienated being."127 Conclusion In concluding, let me consider a question that may have arisen for many readers. Given the different forms of excessive emphasis that characterize all the avant-garde schools, one might well ask if psychoanalysis has a more balanced worldview to offer- that is, a psychological/philosophical vision that understands the roles of both freedom and constraint, and that 126 In a letter, Charles Taylor has kindly pointed out to me that, in addition to the criticism of Lacan offered in this paper, an opposite one also applies. This has to do with the paradoxical fact that the Lacanian position often attracts people who are looking for a kind of unsituated freedom, a fact that Taylor explains as follows: "Being the subject *in the know,' grasping a theory of iron necessity, is having a certain disengagement from all those things which ordinary subjects take with ultimate seriousness. The whole poststructuralist vogue partly draws people by the radical freedom it seems to offer. This is more evident, of course, with people like Derrida, and all the talk of 'play' than with Lacan. But I think it also true of him." The radical freedom to which Taylor refers is, of course, not the same as what I, in my discussion above, called the "somewhat paradoxical freedom of automaticity emphasized by the surrealists . . . giving oneself over to the larger systemic flows"; it is, I assume, rather more akin to the kind of freedom that is possible for a Cartesian mental substance that has recognized, and therefore distanced itself from, the realm of causal necessity.

For another critique of the postmodernist attempt to efface the self, see Lasch, Minimal Self, ch. 4.</page><page sequence="56">606 SOCIAL RESEARCH leavens its inward focus with a sufficient appreciation of the necessary, and potentially salutary, role of external constraints and values. Ironically enough, Freud in his own formulations may have come closer to achieving such a balance than have those successors who have tried it improve or modernize the theory by overcoming its inconsistencies. This seems to be implied by the thought of some philosophers (R.S. Peters and Paul Ricoeur among them) who see the essential value and raison d'être of psychoanalysis as lying in the very fact that it is essentially a double discourse- the application to the human domain of two quite different forms of understanding, both of which are equally necessary and valid, even though they are mutually incompatible in a strict logical sense. For Ricoeur, these are the languages of hermeneutics and of energetics; for Peters, a philosopher in the Wittgensteinian tradition, these are the languages of reasons and of causes (the "purposive" and "mechanical" models).128 There seem to be two possible reactions to this realization of the simultaneous necessity and logical incompatibility of two perspectives. One reaction is to accept a contradictory discourse as the best possible alternative. Perhaps the essence of human understanding just is to compare the infinitely complex, multifaceted, and mysterious nature of reality to simplified, and therefore better understood, models or analogies.129 Perhaps the best one can do is to recognize this propensity of the act of understanding even as one indulges it. Given such a view, the tendency to think in overly simplistic models- like pure causality and pure intentionality- is intrin- sic to the human mind, something without which we would lapse into obscurity and confusion. Perhaps, then, the error to be avoided is not using such models but losing sight of their metaphorical nature, or of the need to shift readily between 128 Ricoeur, Freud and Philosophy, p. 65; Peters, Concept of Motivation, p. 94. 129 See, e.g., Pepper, World Hypotheses.</page><page sequence="57">THE SELF AND ITS VICISSITUDES 607 them as necessary. On this view, Freud's switching between the languages of cause and of reason is not something to be deplored or overcome. The second alternative would be to attempt to develop a new vocabulary or mode of understand- ing that somehow manages to transcend the exaggerated and simplistic models. Such a route does not seem as yet to have been seriously pursued by psychoanalysts (with the possible exception of Politzer, the teacher of Merleau-Ponty and Sartre who was killed during World War II).130 The first position seems consistent with the approach of the philosopher Wittgenstein- that archenemy of all "metaphys- ical" thinking who wrote that "Ordinary language is all right," so long as one doesn't take its (often contradictory and overly simple) metaphors too literally.131 The second is closer to the thought of Martin Heidegger, that other seminal philosopher of the twentieth century who attempted, at the inevitable risk of obscurity and incomprehensibility, to transcend standard conceptual structures and develop a new vocabulary that avoids the all-too-familiar polarities that have informed Western thought for centuries (e.g., inner versus outer, freedom versus determinism, or body versus soul).132 Here I can do no more than mention these alternatives: to consider in any detail a Wittgensteinian or Heideggerian approach to the self is, of course, far beyond the scope of the present essay.133 130 G.
