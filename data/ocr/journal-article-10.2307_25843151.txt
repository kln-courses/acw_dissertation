Religion, Earthquakes and National Unity in the Republic of Altai, Russian Federation* Agnieszka Halemba, Geisteswissenschaftliches Zentrum, Geschichte und Kultur Ostmitteleuropas, Universitat Leipzig Abstract. This article proposes an interpretation of the conflicts that occurred in relation to the recent archaeological discoveries in the Republic of Altai. First, a particular controversy over the body of the so-called Ukok Princess is introduced. Subsequently, the author considers those characteristics of con temporary Altaian religious life that made an application of this discovery as an explanatory device pos sible, especially after the 2003 earthquakes. An analysis of those characteristics of Altaian religious life is made with the help of the metaphor "religion moving under one's feet", which is employed in three different ways: 1. with reference to particularities of Altaian religious life based on the principles of unity of land and people and of importance of movement. Here, movement is understood both as a key feature underscoring Altaian religious practices as well as a metaphor that stands for flexibility and un certainty of their encounters with spiritual worlds. 2. with reference to specific reformulation of Altaian religious life in the context of building a na tional ideology. This reformulation includes reduction of various forms of mobility and flexibility for the sake of stability. 3. with reference to the earthquakes, when the land - the foundation for Altaian religious life - shakes under peoples' feet. [Siberia, religion, national identity, archaeology, natural disaster] Background In 1993, a team of archaeologists, led by Natalia Polosmak and Viacheslav Molodin from the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science in Novosibirsk, discov ered the elaborately tattooed body of a young woman that had survived in the perma frost for around 2500 years (cf. Polosmak 1994).1 The body was found on the Ukok * Research and writing-up of this paper were undertaken during my Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology in Halle/Saale. 1 See the following link for "The first report on a burial of a noble Pazyryk woman on the Ukok Pla teau" by Natalia Polosmak. http://ambal.archaeology.nsc.ru/gen-i/Editions/Electronical/Bulletens/ Herald/Voll/Chapter7/Pol4.htm Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 133 (2008) 283-299 ? 2008 Dietrich Reimer Verlag</page><page sequence="2">284 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 133 (2008) Plateau in the Republic of Altai and, subsequently, other preserved bodies were found in tombs. Although archaeological research in this territory has been conducted at least since the 1970s (Soenov and Surazakov 2001), this particular discovery brought Ukok to the attention of an international audience, also extending beyond academic circles. In 1994 Ukok was declared a protected territory with a status of "Quiet Zone",2 and in 1998 it was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. In 1994 the National Geographic Magazine published an article, and in 1996 the BBC produced a film about the discovery. Immediately after the body was removed from the tomb, it was flown to Novosibirsk for further investigation and preservation. Since then, it has been taken to various museums and exhibition halls, and has become known worldwide as the Ice Maiden or the Ukok Princess. After each trip, the Ice Maiden was returned to Novosibirsk. From the very beginning the news about the Ukok Princess captured the imagi nation of the Altaians, the titular nationality of the Republic of Altai.3 Various local organisations as well as Altaian politicians and other public figures expressed their displeasure that the bodies from the Ukok Plateau were removed from the territory of the Republic. Obviously, the media played the crucial role in turning the public attention towards the discovery. The Ice Maiden was found at the height of the na tional-cultural revival {natsionalno-kuTturnoe vozrozhdenie) that dominated local po litical and cultural discourses in the federate republics following the collapse of the Soviet Union.4 The Republic of Altai was in this respect no exception, and the Ice Maiden was adopted by the national leaders as the ancestress of contemporary Al taians. This respectful attitude towards the Ice Maiden was readily accepted by the Altaian people, and during my research, conducted in the Altai since 1993, I have heard many times from inhabitants of Altaian villages that the bodies found on Ukok Plateau should never have been removed from the ground. The prompt accep tance of the claims voiced by Altaian intellectuals was probably influenced by the fact that in general Altaian burial grounds are carefully avoided after the final ceremony is conducted a few months after death. The dead should not be disturbed, otherwise they could try to capture the souls of the living people, causing illness and death (Halemba 2006). 2 Law 6-15 of Republic of Altai "On territories and objects of special nature protection in the Re public of Altai". 3 The Russian Federation is composed of administrative units of various statuses, including 21 feder ate republics. Although at present in most of the republics the majority of population is Russian, they all have a so-called "titular nationality", which is an ethnic group for which the territory of the repub lic is supposed to form a historic homeland. Usually the republics have two official languages: Russian and the one of the titular nationality. The republic also can adopt its own constitution, elect a parlia ment, president and adopt a range of political symbols: coat of arms, flag and an anthem. 4 E. g. Anderson 2000; Khazanov 1995; Argounova 1995, 2000; Fryer 1999; Humphrey 1998; Balzer 1999; Nowicka (ed.) 2000; Smith 1998.</page><page sequence="3">Agnieszka Halemba: "What does it feel like when your religion moves under your feet?" 285 Nevertheless, the displeasure of the local population with regard to the removal of the bodies also has another dimension. The discovery led to a discussion of her iden tity. Some statements by the Russian scientists5 were interpreted as a straightforward denial of the existence of any relationship between contemporary Altaians and the Ice Maiden, contributing to a controversy which was explored as the main theme in the 1996 BBC feature. As Rimma Erkinova, director of the Altaian Museum in Gorno Altaisk,6 stated: "In the perception of the local population, the Ukok Princess embo dies the image of the earliest ancestress and ancient protector of Altaian people. The crudeness of her handling and especially her forced separation from her birth land is even today perceived with sharp pain".7 Although on one level the battle over the Ice Maiden can be understood through the idioms of struggle over political symbolic capital, I argue that the arguments around this case provide interesting insights into various concepts of relatedness and group identity that are simultaneously present among the Altaians. The Earthquake With renewed force the issue of the Ice Maidens fate returned to public attention in 2003. In September 2003 Altai was shaken by a series of earthquakes. In their after math, in February 2004 Auelkhan Dzhatkambaev, head of the most affected region of Altai, Kosh-Agach, issued an open letter addressed to the head of the Republic of Altai and other officials, which included an urgent request to return the mummy to Altai. Allow me to quote:8 "Our land cannot find peace. People are under stress, they are waiting for more earthquakes. (...) The scientists were telling us that the earthquakes would stop soon. (...) However, from the beginning of January the quakes have been getting stronger again. My fellow people (zemlyaki) think that the reason for this is the archaeological excavations carried out on the Ukok Plateau, in a place sacred to Turkic people, and above all the removal of the bodies of the princess and the prince from the district of Kosh-Agach, where they had been buried for at least 1000 years. One can deal with misfortune more easily, if one knows the reason for it (...) We people, we do not understand everything in our lives. Why then should we play with the fate and with a history of the nation? The scientists, 5 For example http://www.den-za-dnem.ru/page.php?article=278 and rg.ru. 1. 07. 2004 6 Gorno-Altaisk in the capital of the Republic of Altai 7 Interview conducted by Dimitrii Verkhoturov published on 4. 02. 2008 at www.regrus.info/an ounces/11/243.html accessed on 12. 02. 2008 my translation 8 Original in Russian, my translation. Published also at http://inform.gorno-altaisk.ru (accessed 27. 09. 2006)</page><page sequence="4">286 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 133 (2008) who have found and dug the tomb of the princess and the prince in Ukok, have received everything: scientific data indispensable for science and history, academic degrees, PhDs and professorships; they published books for future generations in all world languages. Further retaining of the princess and the prince and, even more so, earning money through displaying their naked bodies is contrary to hu man values. This is not a superstition, neither is this whim - this is wisdom, which has arisen from the depth of the centuries, and we are not in the position to judge it". He finished his letter with a firm request to return the bodies to Ukok. Otherwise, he says, the earthquakes will continue. In fact, Aulelhkan Dzhatkambaev is not an Altaian, but a Kazakh. Kazakhs have been settling in this region of Altai since the end of the 19th century and at the mo ment form roughly 50 percent of the population of Kosh Agach region, the other half being mostly Altaian.9 It is clear from his letter, however, that he refers not so much to his own perception of the situation, but rather to the perception of his zemlyaki, i. e. literally people who share the land (Rus. zemlya - land). It is quite probable that he wrote this letter in order to improve his chances with his potential Altaian electorate, the issue to which I return later. Nevertheless, I have chosen to refer to his letter for several reasons. First, it was written by an elected leader of the affected region, and as such it was received very favourably by the local Altaians and might have actually se cured some votes for Dzhatkambaev. Secondly, I believe that it succinctly summarises the actual attitude of many Altaians towards the issue, the one that I have heard during many conversations and that my Altaian friends shared with me in their letters sent after the quakes. D. V. Maslov (2006), who conducted field research following the earthquakes in Kosh Agach confirmed that the removal of the princess was quoted by Altaians as the main cause of the earthquakes. Thirdly, Dzhatkambaev's statement was picked up by the Russian media and received numerous reactions.10 He provided a ready quotation used by the media and, probably for political reasons, picked up the theme which resonated with local perceptions. Nor was his voice isolated. As Rimma Erkinova says in the interview quoted above: "The situation regarding the return of the mummy became acute in 2003 once more at the time of the earthquake. There were a few thousand pleas. Simple inhabitants as well as deputies from the affected regions 9 Since the census in 2002, the inhabitants of Kosh Agach could also declare themselves Telengit (see Halemba 2006; Filippova 2003). Before, Telengit were considered to be a sub-group of Altaians. Still, for complex reasons that are not relevant for the argument in this paper, during the 2002 census most of non-Kazakh inhabitants of Kosh Agach declared themselves as Altaian. 10 See e. g. http://english.pravda.ru/science/19/94/377/l4995_mummy.html; http://sibir.rian.ru/print_version.html?nws_id=84290; http://www.freerepublic.eom/focus/f-news/l 109463/posts; http://www.inauka.ru/english/article40985/print.html; http://www.vn.ru/24. 03. 2006/culture/75264/</page><page sequence="5">Agnieszka Halemba: "What does it feel like when your religion moves under your feet?" 287 wrote letters to all kinds of agencies, demanding the return of the Altaian mummy to her original place. In the consciousness of the people she is not just a 'biological ob ject', as she is for the scientists. Instead she is a princess and ancient ancestress. People even say that she is Ochy Bala from the heroic epics - the hero-girl who saved her people in the time of attack from foreign enemies".11 This paper proposes an understanding of a connection made by many inhabitants of Altai between the removal of the body of the Ukok Princess and subsequent earth quakes. I focus on this interpretation that in my opinion enriches our understanding of group identity formation and relies on Altaian understanding of the relations be tween land, religious life and personhood. Starting from the case of one particular controversy, I consider the characteristics and the contemporary changes of Altaian religious life using the metaphor of "religion moving under one's feet". I employ this metaphor in three different ways. In the first usage the metaphor refers to particularities of Altaian religious life, based on the prin ciples of unity of land and people and of importance of movement. In this sense, I understand movement both as the key feature underscoring Altaian religious beliefs and practices as well as a metaphor that stands for flexibility and uncertainty of their encounters with spiritual worlds. In the second sense, the metaphor of "movement of religion" refers to change. I argue that at present the Altaian religious life is reformu lated in the context of national ideology building. This reformulation includes reduc tion of various forms of mobility and flexibility for the sake of stability. In the third sense, the metaphor refers directly to the earthquakes, when the land - the foundation for Altaian religious life - shakes under peoples' feet. Religious Life of the Altaians The Republic of Altai is part of the Russian Federation that borders with Kazakhstan, China and Mongolia. "The Altaians" is a complex national/ethnic label, given to di verse groups of Turkic-speaking inhabitants of Altai, excluding the Kazakhs. It is used both in academic and non-academic contexts, such as in the Russian censuses, media, and popular books. Recently some of the groups previously classed in the Russian cen suses as "the Altaians" (altaitsy), have started to be listed separately and the relations between different Turkic-speaking groups of Altai such as Telengit, Kumandy or Tuba, have provided material for separate analyses (see e. g. Donahoe et al. n. d., Filippova 2003; Halemba 2006). However, notwithstanding all these divisions and debates, which to a large extent arise from the political and economic situation in the Russian Federation, all the 11 Interview conducted by Dimitrii Verkhoturov published on 4. 02. 2008 at www.regrus.info/an ounces/11/243.html accessed on 12. 02. 2008 my translation</page><page sequence="6">288 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 133 (2008) groups of primarily non-Muslim and Turkic-speaking inhabitants of Altai are united at least by one common and explicitly acknowledged feature - the worship of their land, the Altai. The underlining feature that shapes religious practices among the Altaians is the cult of nature in general and the cult of Altai in particular. Those religious practices are referred to locally as Altai jay, which can be roughly translated as "Altaian way of doing things".12 Within Altai jay one can find a whole array of religious practitioners, who are collectively called neme biler ulus (sing, neme biler kizhi), which can be literally translated as "people who know something". Generally, the human world is divided into biler ulus and bilbes ulus - people who know and people who do not know. Among people who 'know', there are some who have meaningful dreams, some who hear sounds produced by wandering souls, some who can see them and others who can foretell coming events.13 Biler kizhi "proper" (chyn), however, are the ones, who receive assistance from their spirit-helpers. The most powerful of them, especially the ones who have ttiyiir - a kind of device,14 which has a role similar to shaman's drum (and is called the same), is called kam, which is usually translated as "shaman". The most important task of kam dar (pi.) and other biler ulus is to negotiate and maintain contact with spiritual beings that are responsible for human well-being. In order to understand what these spirits are like, I have chosen to employ Alfred Gell's notion of "the occult". In one of his early works, Alfred Gell, drawing on a paper by Meyer Fortes (1966), developed an idea of "the occult", which he saw as being "those aspects of homogenous reality which seem to bespeak a hidden articulating power, inaccessible in itself, but manifest in its effects" (Gell 1974:20). Subsequently, he did not view gods, spirits and disembodied powers (as mand) as being identical to "the occult" per se, but as images or manifestations of it. Using Gell's own terminology from his later works, it can be said that spirits, gods and powers are indices of the occult (Gell 1998, 1999). In his 1998 work Art and Agency Gell treats artworks as indices, i. e. entities on a basis of which the observer can make abductive inferences on the agency of another person - here an artists (p. 13). Here, I suggest that we could use the notion of index with re ference to spirits in shamanic practice. In this sense the spirits are indices of the occult, and on the basis of encounters with the spirits shaman can make inferences about the agency of this hidden realm. The occult itself can never be accessed, grasped or under 12 Jay in Altaian means (1) authority; (2) faith; (3) custom, law, principle; (4) canon, ensemble of rules (Baskakov 1947) 13 For more information on biler ulus including the nature of their special abilities see Diakonova 2001 and Halemba 2006. 14 Nowadays biler ulus in the Kosh Agach region use ttiyiir, which is composed of a piece of white cloth upon which either a schematic map of the kind described in the literature for shamanic drums is drawn or a more abstract representation of shamanic experiences (see also Diakonova 2001, pp. 168 ? 170; Halemba 2006 p. 155).</page><page sequence="7">Agnieszka Halemba: "What does it feel like when your religion moves under your feet?" 289 stood. Indices (in this case spirits) can be known, but in a specific sense. In my usage, index comes into being at the intersection of two agencies - one of the occult and one of the perceiver. The spirits and deities as indices are diverse, because they come into being on the intersection between the occult and the agency of the knowledgeable per son. The result is that the images of spirits are not rigid - they are indices of some thing else, coming into being here and now for a particular perceiver. This is how the spirits exist for the Altaian "knowledgeable people". The spirits with whom they collaborate are in constant flow, they change their characteristics, they arrive and disappear, they change their voice, appearances, moods, and they are not always predictable. The Altaian spirits appear as outcomes of sporadic actions or per sonal encounters, and they do not form a coherent cosmology. The changeability, flow and movement are one important feature of Altaian reli gious life. The other crucial feature lies in an importance of the land - Altai. Apart from being a name of the chain of mountains, a name of the political unit and a source for a national designation, Altai is also a spiritual entity. "The Altai" is a crucial and complicated notion situated at the basis of the Altaian faith and at the source of their most important religious concepts: Altaidyrj eezi and Altai Kudai. Altaidyrj eezi is a master spirit of all Altai. Although there are many stories about the characteristics of Altaidyy eezi, people seem to understand and perceive it rather as a kind of energy, important through its very existence regardless of the form it takes. The same term is used for a master of the Altai as a whole and for masters of particular places. Hence, if a person talks about Altaidyrj eezi, she/he would use the same term while talking about a power of Altai as a whole and about a spirit master of any parti cular place. Altaidyrj eezi may be seen therefore either as singular/general or as plural/ particular, as at the same time one and many. This, presumably older, image of Altaidyrj eezi has been supplemented in recent decades by the image of Altai Kudai. Altai Kudai is unique and refers to the Altai as a whole. The emergence of this concept shows that all the cults of particular moun tains connected with particular clans or territories, which are confirmed for Altai in older literature (Potapov 1946; Tokarev 1936; Anokhin 1994 [1924]), have gradually been amended today by a more general cult of Altai. Altai Kudai is understood both as Altai (the place), which is worshipped, as well as the transcendent and unreachable God of Altai; so it implies that transcendence and immanence are both aspects of the same phenomenon. Therefore, Altai Kudai should be understood through the image of Altai itself as a God, with magnificence, power, impressiveness and influence on peoples lives, which is intrinsic to its features as a place, landscape and territory. Altaidyrj eezi is the Master of Altai, but is perceived rather in the form of unshaped energy that fills everything and makes everything alive, than through its anthropomorphic image. If the differentiation between the land and the God is indistinct, there is also no strict separation between the land and the people. Probably one should not use the word "between" here at all, because it presupposes ontological existence of two spheres:</page><page sequence="8">290 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 133 (2008) humans and land, between which the relation can be established, broken, sustained or abandoned. Still, the Altaians and the Altai are so tightly bound up that at times they cannot be considered as ontologically separate. Even the notion of "bounding up" can be misleading. The more accurate phrasing would probably be that personhood in cludes Altai in a similar way that it includes parts of the body, emotions, plans, feelings and sensual abilities. This is to say more than just to acknowledge that the Altai is a spiritual being, a subject with consciousness and intentionality. Instead, people and land are one. There is no need, however, to exoticize Altaians as having a completely different "worldview", in comparison to the one which understands the self, or the body, as a depository of individual features, subsequently reaching outwards in relations with other people, objects and places. Rather, there are different strategies, identities and practices that people employ. At times the Altaians can treat the Altai as an object. During the earthquakes, I received letters from Altai saying such things as the follow ing: "People do say here that the earthquakes have happened, because the Altai was offended with our disrespect, cutting trees on the slopes of sacred mountains, polluting its rivers or over-hunting. There may be some truth to this. But really, we are educated people and we know that it was because of some shifts in the geological structure of the earth". In this quotation Altai is both object and subject, treated either as an unin tentional structure of sand and stones or as a conscious agent, who retaliates if mis treated. However, these are not the only two possible ways of viewing Altai. In both of those humans and land are seen as separate entities, with multiple possibilities of creat ing interrelations. Still, at times the Altai is also seen as an integral part of a person and what happens to humans happens to Altai and the other way round. The most striking examples of such an approach are the narratives about the impossibility of abandoning Altai. I was told many times that if a person leaves Altai, she/he dies. This is not be cause of the longing and emotional distress, but because of physical separation. It is as if a part of the person has been severed, such as when people fall ill and die after parts of their body has been removed. Of course this is not to say that there are no Altaians who actually live beyond the Altai Mountains, who study in Moscow or even emigrate to Europe, although Altaian emigration seems to be relatively low in comparison to other Siberian nations, including neighbouring Tuva.15 Still, narratives about the impossibility of abandoning Altai are very powerful. The unwillingness to leave the mountains has been confirmed also by 15 So far, there is no systematic study on the contemporary migration patterns among Siberian peo ples. My claims are based on my personal observations confirmed by my colleagues involved in Siber ian studies. While I have met quite a few Buriat, Yakut, Tuva, Evenki and other people living in Eur opean cities including Berlin, I have only heard about two Altaian women based at present in Germany.</page><page sequence="9">Agnieszka Halemba: "What does it feel like when your religion moves under your feet?" 291 sociological research. At the beginning of the 21st century, Tony Glendinning from the University of Aberdeen conducted a comparative research on the values and life projects of young people in several Siberian regions, both in cities as well as in rural settlements. Apparently, in comparison to other groups, the majority of young Altaians declared that they want to stay in the Altai or, at most, move to the Republics capital of Gorno-Al taisk. This was also in contrast to the local Russian population, living in the same re gions of the Altai; young Russians declared the will to emigrate more often.16 Contemporary Changes in Religious Life Nowadays, however, the religious life of the Altaians is undergoing significant changes and the metaphor of "religion moving under ones feet" refers also to these contempo rary transformations. In general what one can see in the Altai today can be interpreted as the processes of religious institutionalisation. Here, I understand as institutionalised religions those that have an explicit system determining religious knowledge as a valid or a non-valid one. This leads to a discourse on the inclusion/exclusion employed in order to clarify what belongs to a given religious system and what does not, which in turn usually leads to an establishment of some kind of hierarchy of religious specialists, church-like structures and a canon of religious dogma. In this sense, religious life of the Altaians has not been institutionalized so far, although, as stated below, the pro cesses of institutionalisation are currently underway. Another terminology that is useful when analysing the contemporary religious sit uation in the Altai, most recently reworked by Harvey Whitehouse (2000), introduces the differentiation between doctrinal and imagistic modes of religiosity. As imagistic mode of religiosity Whitehouse describes a tendency for revelations to be transmitted through sporadic collective action, evoking multivocal iconic imagery encoded in memory as distinct episodes and producing highly cohesive and particularistic social ties. In such a mode one rarely encounters relatively stable and coherent cosmology; rather, there are particular revelations, specific and concrete encounters with spiritual beings. Whitehouse asserts that the doctrinal mode, by contrast, consists of the tendency for revelations to be codified as a body of doctrines, transmitted through routinised forms of worship, memorised as a part of ones "general knowledge", and producing large, anonymous communities. I argue that the shift towards a doctrinal mode of re ligiosity can be seen as part of the processes of religious institutionalisation. Although these fundamentally contrasting dynamics are often to be found within a single reli gious tradition, the distinction between imagistic and doctrinal modes of religiosity corresponds to empirically significant trajectories. 16 Tony Glendinning, personal communication.</page><page sequence="10">292 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 133 (2008) The distinction made by Whitehouse between different modes of religiosity is helpful in the analysis of a situation, in which different religious traditions meet, as is the case in contemporary Altai. These two modes of religiosity are simultaneously present to different degrees in all religious traditions, as they correspond to the dif ferent ways in which human memory operates (episodic versus semantic memory - see Whitehouse 2000 pp. 9-11). However, I argue that one can empirically observe shifts in the given religious tradition, which correspond to the predominance of one of the modes of religiosity at a given time. It can be said that the flexible experience of spiritual specialists in Altai is situated close to an imagistic mode of religiosity as described by Whitehouse. Religious experience here is highly individualistic, as each knowledgeable person interacts with spirits in a specific way, depending on his or her particular capabilities. Nowadays though, the dogmatic mode of religiosity is becom ing more significant. This is happening through the interactions of local religious tradition with national ideology, with institutionalised religions and also through in teractions with other agents, for whom Altai jay has to be presented as a structured whole. Religion occupied a very important place in the discussions concerning Altaian national unity especially in the first half of the 1990s, when, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Republic of Altai was established. The basic message of these discussions can be summarised as follows: Altai jay, in the form which it takes at present, cannot be a basis for religious unity of the Altaian nation. This is because it does not provide its followers with a well-defined code of beliefs, images and practices. Although it is obviously not always the case that national ideology seeks to include religion as one of the national markers, such an attitude has been present in the Re public of Altai since its establishment. Religion was seen as a potentially unifying fac tor for the Altaian nation, which is not surprising if we consider what was stated above - that the worship of Altai is the most evident feature which unites all diverse Turkic-speaking and non-Muslim groups inhabiting Altai. The problem was however: what should this religion be like? To give a simple example of a problem that faced Altaian national ideologists: If you are a national leader and want to organise a com munal ceremony that can be represented as a "traditional religious ritual", you have to be clear about the purpose of it, its leaders and the ritual actions to be employed. Still, in the Altaian case, what you get instead is a variety of responses and a message from the knowledgeable people {biler ulus) that such communal rituals are almost impossi ble to conduct, because one cannot generate general rules of the Altaian religion per se. Although for different reasons than analysed here, Roberte Hamayon also under lined the difficulties in combining shamanism and state formations: "... shamanism seems to refuse its own codification, because this would hinder the play of partnership with supernature - a partnership always available, so far as it consists in turning ima ginary entities into partners with whom to exchange and negotiate ..." (Hamayon, 1994, p. 88)</page><page sequence="11">Agnieszka Halemba: "What does it feel like when your religion moves under your feet?" 293 In such a situation, what were the choices for the Altaian national leaders? They could either abandon the idea that religion could be a building block of national unity, or they could support conversion to an institutionalised religion, or they could suggest changes to the Altai jarj itself, which would turn it into institutionalised religion (see also Halemba 2003; 2006). Some of the Altaian national leaders decided that Bud dhism, being a religion of neighbouring countries and having in other regions incor porated various rites of land worship, would be the best choice for the future of the Altaian nation. Still, what happens to local religious tradition when it begins to inter act with Buddhism? The relations between Buddhism and local nature cults have been presented as an axis of difference in several anthropological works (Ortner 1978; Mumford 1989; Sa muel 1990 1993; Mills 2003). The common premise of these works is the grounding of the analysis in the ethnographic material concerning regions, where Buddhism has been firmly established and where there are Buddhist monasteries and communities: e. g. Tibet. Subsequently, the questions asked concerned relations between Buddhism (as a dominant religion) and local modes of religious knowledge. Although there is no doubt that Buddhism has influenced the Altai for many cen turies, the situation there is very different from that in Tibet and the Himalayas. The only lamas living in the Altai at the moment have been educated recently in monas teries in other part of the Russian Federation (mainly Buriatya). There is no evidence of the past existence of Buddhist shrines or monasteries within the territory of the con temporary Republic of Altai, as there is no evidence that a considerable number of peripatetic lamas reached Altai in pre-Soviet times. From the works mentioned above, the work by Martin Mills is most interesting for my argument. Mills claims that local spirit cults and Buddhism cannot be straightfor wardly compared, because they do not function in the same or even a similar way. Therefore, he offers a critique of earlier works on interactions between Buddhism and local nature cults: "The cult of local deities has been relegated to the status of 'folk religion by most analysts, and indeed it is usually regarded as interacting with Buddhist institutions in the matter of a corrupting or compromising influence. Such models of religi osity depend on the assumption that local spirit worship can be counted as a re ligious tradition of a comparable nature to Buddhism, and therefore their rela tionship is one of either contrast, syncretism or contestation. (...) such an assumption is mistaken, and local deity worship in Tibetan and Himalayan re gions is part of a powerful (...) cultural construction of the social and ritual capacities of humans, one which conceives of embodied personhood as a nexus of productive and reproductive relationships with local chthonic sources, em bedded within the wide landscape in which the person is born" (Mills 2003: xvii-xviii) Hence, the difference between Buddhism and local religious traditions concerns the very basis of what spiritual experience, authority, knowledge and personhood are</page><page sequence="12">294 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 133 (2008) about. In Mills' work, the Buddhist monks, being themselves embedded in what he calls a chthonic personhood, actively contribute to the production of the local deities. It is vital to point out, however, that before the local spirits can interact with the in stitutionalized traditions through relations of contest, conflict, submission or replica tion, they must first begin their existence as deities, i. e. beings attributed with particu lar and relatively stable characteristics concerning their appearance, functions and realms of influence. To give an example: There is one very significant and recurring motif in the narra tives on recent visits of lamas to Altai. In such stories, the lama stands in the valley between the mountains or in the middle of the steppe and tells people that they have a powerful land inhabited by powerful spirits. He points at the mountain and says that there is a spirit of the place there, who is a young man, and that at that sacred spring there is a young lady. He also reveals to people what he calls the real names of the places, using names, which have never been heard before. His listeners are surprised and full of admiration for his knowledge - they have never heard such detailed ac counts from their knowledgeable people {biler ulus). Still, their awe is mixed with dis belief. How is it possible to know the spirits so precisely, to give such detailed descrip tions of them? This lama knows so much and claims to know it for certain! It is argued here that through the practice of naming spirits and fixing their images, the lamas pre pare the way for subjugation of the land and for a doctrinal mode of religiosity. They re-form the flexible images of Altaian spirits into deities, thereby establishing them as partners for the future dialogue between different religious traditions. In a sense, they establish local cults as a religious tradition of nature comparable to Buddhism. The Buddhist protagonists are not just entering into dialogue with the pre-existing systems of beliefs, but they are actively creating such systems in order to be able to interact with them. The Earthquakes and the Ukok Princess To return to the initial issue of the Princess of Ukok and the earthquakes: here the metaphor is taken literally. We can ask: If the land is the basis of religious life of the Altaians, how does it feel when the basis of your religion literally moves under your feet? And what can you do about it? While analysing the basic features of Altaian religious life, I have underlined the fact that the relations between the Altai and the people go beyond the object-subject division and that the local way in which personhood is conceptualised includes the land - Altai. This unity of land and people can be seen as underscoring the conflict over the body of the Ukok Princess, which reached its peak after the recent earth quakes. Most Altaians have opposed the removal of the body of the Ukok princess from the burial grounds or at least from the territory of Altai from the moment of the discovery. This opposition has also given impetus to discussion of her identity.</page><page sequence="13">Agnieszka Halemba: "What does it feel like when your religion moves under your feet?" 295 Who was she? Most of the Altaians do not have any doubt that she was Altaian, whereas Russian academics seem to publicly express an opinion that she was not. Inter estingly, it seems that the reason for this discrepancy is a difference in an idiom of argu mentation over her identity. The Russian academics argue their position according to principles of modern anthropological measurements and genetics. First, research on the bodily structure of the mummy was conducted, and later genetic samples were ob tained from her remains. While in the specialist articles written for academic circles one could find statements confirming the genetic relationship between the bodies found in Ukok and the contemporary Altaian population (Voevoda et al. n.d.), in the popular articles and interviews for the general public the situation is presented in a different way. For example, Nikolai Makarov, director of the Institute of Archaeology of the Rus sian Academy of Science, stated the following in an interview with the all-Russia news paper Rosiiskaya gazeta regarding the Altaian mummy: "There is no straightforward re lation with contemporary Altaians. They are completely different people (narod), who are neither genetically nor historically linked to this ancient culture, whose tombs were investigated by the expedition of the academician Molodin on the Ukok Plateau".17 Although contemporary Altaians do care very much about opinions of academics and would probably like to have their relation with the Ice Maiden also confirmed through genetic research, in the face of such claims they recourse to a different line of argumentation. They claim that the woman is Altaian, because she was found in Altai, she was dug out of the Altaian land, and through the land she is related to the people. This cannot be changed even by genetic research. It must be mentioned that the Altaians are quite consequent in their insistence that what is from Altai is Altaian. For example, in the discussions about strengthening and stabilising the position of the Altaian clans, there were many voices concerning clan-membership of old Russian settlers. The Rus sians do not have clans, but there has been a serious, not yet finalised discussion, about the necessity of integrating them into the system of the Altaian clans. This is because in a sense, they are Altaians, as they have lived on this land for generations and behave to wards it with respect. At present the mummy is still in Novosibirsk, and people who attribute recent mis fortunes in Altai to her removal have been repeatedly ridiculed and accused of mysti cism, backwardness, if not of plain stupidity in the Russian media. Many interviews were conducted by various media with the academics, and the genetic arguments were used many times in order to show that the fate of the Ukok Princess cannot be related in any way to the fate of the Altaians. The principle, which has been employed so far in this article to understand the Altaian opposition to the removal of the Ice Maiden, the one of unity of land and people, could be strengthened, if the reader were introduced to some other ways in 17 Rosiiska gazeta, 7. 07. 2004, interview with Nikolai Andreevich Makarov, by Maria Agranovich. Available at www.rg.ru</page><page sequence="14">296 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 133 (2008) which Altaians relate to land and to the dead. For example, the funeral customs could be described, with special attention given to restrictions on grave-digging, and a ban on repairing graves' fences or visiting the graves after the final commemoration cere mony. Altaian reservations towards agriculture could be mentioned, as well as the older form of Altaian shoes, in which the toe-ends curve upwards so that they do not touch the ground while walking. However, instead of introducing more similar details, I want to reflect more upon the fact that while the land-people relations present a possibility of making an argu ment for both the return of the mummy to Altai and for the connection between her removal and the earthquakes, they do not explain why this argument has been em ployed. In other words: the Altaians are not, by virtue of "having Altaian culture" bound to make such an argument. As it was said above, they do not have one "world view" within which they make all decisions and within which they exclusively think and act. They can see land-people relations in the way described above, but they can see them and act on them in other ways as well, as it was mentioned in letters that reached me from the earthquake-shaken Altai. The use of a particular argument can depend on particular relations of power. The above sentence is substantiated, e. g. when we consider that the author of the letter concerning the Ice Maiden and the earthquakes is not an ethnic Altaian but a Ka zakh. Moreover, he is not exactly a person known for his respect towards the Altaian customs. Quite the contrary: Auelkhan Dzhatkambaev is often accused in his region of having a patronising attitude towards anyone or anything Altaian. Still, in the light of an overall argument in this article, a valid question should be stated: in what sense he is not an Altaian? Is Dzhatkambaev an Altaian in the sense in which the Ice Maiden herself is? Son of this land, born onto Altai and living there his whole life, the same as his fore fathers? Still, many inhabitants of Kosh Agach, a district headed by Dzhatkambaev, would shudder at the very thought of calling him an Altaian. On the contrary, he is con stantly accused of favouring Kazakhs in local politics, of supporting Kazakh culture and of a straightforward disdain towards some of the Altaian customs. Instead, one must conclude, that in this situation different ways of understanding identity co-exist and that the term: "an Altaian" is used simultaneously in different ways. As was also perceptible in the discussions about the identity of the Ice Maiden, "to be Altaian" can be under stood either as to descend (from common ancestors) or to partake (in the land). These applications can appear within a single discussion sequence. In a similar way, Dzhat kambaev is and is not Altaian: He had a possibility of writing such a letter both as an elected representative of a region, where c. 50 % of the population is classed by Russian law as Altaian,18 as well as a life-long inhabitant of Altai, partaking in the land. 18 As it was already mentioned above, since the census in 2002 the inhabitants of Kosh Agach could also declare themselves Telengit (see Halemba 2006; Filippova 2003).</page><page sequence="15">Agnieszka Halemba: "What does it feel like when your religion moves under your feet?" 297 The letter he wrote was sincerely supported by Altaian inhabitants of Kosh Agach, although they were aware that Dzhatkambaev wrote it mainly for political reasons. By the time of the earthquakes the interethnic situation in Kosh Agach had become tense, and one may suspect that Dzhatkambaev wanted to make some concessions or gestures towards the local non-Kazakhs, in order to stabilise his own position before the new elections. The issue of the Ice Maiden was a good opportu nity; he put himself forward as a spokesman for "his people", suffered some ridicule in the media, but he could hope (and rightly so) to gain respect locally. The argu ment he made was locally accepted and possible to make; still, it was a political con figuration in the district of Kosh Agach, which triggered the writing of this particu lar letter. Final Notes Thus, it can be said that in the Altai religion moves under people's feet in many ways. Firstly, the mobility and flexibility of spiritual knowledge and of the spirits themselves have been managed by the Altaian religious practitioners long before recent changes and developments. Secondly, the movement understood as a change towards stability is carefully and consciously being addressed at present. Thirdly, in order to manage the situation during which the land literally shook under their feet, people have resorted to their knowledge about the land, which lies at the basis of their religious life and other forms of sociality. They want to calm the land through the means that are embedded in the approach underlining unity of the land and the people. Moreover, in the light of recent processes of re-definition of local religious tradi tions in the Altai, we can talk about a paradigm shift. Beginning in the mid-1990s, several formal and informal organizations concerned with Altaian religious life have been established. Almost all of them have one common feature: They wish to put some formalised order into the religious life of the Altaians, they wish to know something certain about the spirits, the land and the rituals. For example, scientific research on the qualities of sacred places (magnetism) can be encouraged. Or some basic logical system can be devised in order to transform seemingly disordered sha manic worlds into a system (e.g. Merjdesh and Kanichin 1993). In Whitehouse's terms, because of the political situation and religious competition, some people want to shift Altai jarj from a mainly imagistic to a fairly doctrinal mode of religi osity. Finally, it has to be underscored that the people living in the Altai have had the possibility of using their ideas and practices concerning land-people unity in order to argue for the return of the mummy and for the connection between her removal and the earthquakes. Still, the argument they have made has been just a possibility, which was used because of local configurations of power.</page><page sequence="16">298 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 133 (2008) References Anderson, David G. 2000: Identity and ecology in Arctic Siberia: the number one reindeer brigade.
