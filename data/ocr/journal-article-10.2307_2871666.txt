<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Journal of English Literary Hif1ory VOLUME NINE MARCH, 1942 NUMBER ONE THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT: A SELECTIVE AND CRITICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR THE YEAR 1941 WALTER GRAHAM, Editor This bibliography as a whole, is designed to cover a " move- ment" rather than a period. While it is generally limited to the years 1800-1837, as far as the English items are concerned, it is not so limited, of course, in the items regarding other literatures. Important books published earlier are included in the list for 1941 when for some reason they were inadequately noticed in the bibliography for 1940 (ELH 8.1-40) or when significant reviews have appeared within the year 1941. In all cases where no date for the year is given, 1941 may be assumed. The Editor acknowledges with gratitude the assistance, given him by his several collaborators, for materials gathered or for critical comments or for both. They are Walter G. Johnson (English and Scandinavian items), Andre Leveque (French), Robert T. Ittner and Edwin H. Zeydel (German), Felix Gio- vanelli (Italian), Nicholson B. Adams (Spanish), Jules Bernard (Slavonic); Alice D. Snyder, Clarence D. Thorpe, A. D. Mc- Killop, Newman I. White, Paul Landis, Horace A. Eaton, and Charles F. Harrold.

This most ambitious of all bibliographies of English literature is a major achievement of scholarship. Its survey of 16,000 authors and 40,000 titles is the product of some ten years' collaboration of about 200 distinguished British and American scholars. It professes to list completely all books of the most important writers and "in some instances " all of their contributions to magazines, also " generally " all the writings in their major genres of minor poets, dramatists, novelists, and essayists (but not their more miscellaneous works). More selection has been necessary in the works of historians, scientists, letterwritersj travellers, etc. In critical works dealing with these authors an even greater amount of selection is avowed, though the field of selection is widened to include al languages and countries up to 1936, 1937, and 1938 for volumes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Almost 1400 closely printed, double-column pages consisting mainly of dates, names and titles may be expected to furnish (and do furnish) many examples of inaccuracy. Few editors in the whole history of editing have faced such a task of proof-reading. Such a work should be condemned for such errors, if at all, only upon a proportionate rather than an: absolute basis-provided a reviewer could be found competent to do so. A more justifiable criticism might be found in the elaborate arrangement by chronology and subject-divisions which causes the searcher commonly to use first an index volume and then examine line by line several pages in various parts of the work before he is sure the search is ended. The subject-divisions of the various volumes are confusingly numerous, and the cross-referencing and even the simple indexing are therefore somewhat deficient. The amount of selection made necessary by the wide scope of this work will require most students to carry their bibliographic research beyond these</page><page sequence="4">4 THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT: BIBLIOGRAPHY volumes. But the volumes themselves show the way by providing for each period an excellent list of general and special bibliographies. In addition each volume is equipped with a number of highly useful detailed bibliographies of various background materials. For the 19th century volume these include sub-divided general sections on Literary Relations with the Continent (19 pp.), Intellectual Background (20 pp.), Book Production and Distribution (35 pp.), Education (37 pp.), Political and Social Background (13 pp.). The section on Newspapers and Magazines is particularly copious and well-organized. Bibliographers for individual Romantic authors are in general well-chosen, and the relative space assigned each author seems, with some exceptions, well-proportioned. As examples, Wordsworth receives 14 columns, Coleridge 14, Shelley 12, Byron 49, Keats 8, Lamb 12, Hazlitt 6, and DeQuincey and Hunt 8 each. (N. I. W.)

Mr. Hungerford temporarily resuscitates the well-forgotteli " speculative mythologists " of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, to the end of exhibiting their effects upon some of the Romantic poets. The new mythology itself had taken various forms: it was sometimes concerned to</page><page sequence="8">8 THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT: BIBLIOGRAPHY prove that the ancient myths were a disg-uise for historical or natural Jacts; sometimes it was an effort to identify the myths with persons and events of the Old Testament; in the hands of such theorists as Harcanville and Knight, it conceived of the myths as allegories of the procreative powers; or according to other schools it explained them as symbols of divine revelation, or the means for tracing the origins of races and the beginnings and dissemination of religion and other aspects of culture. Intrinsically of small value as literature, the considerable body of writing which embodied this strange pot pourri of lore and fancy has, Mr. Hungerford believes, a secondary importance for its influence on creative writers of the period, whose imaginations were stirred by its bold speculations and who, weary of the shopworn tales of tradition, gladly seized upon the new materials for framework or embellishment of their works. In the light of the mythological diversions to which he devotes his earlier chapters, Mr. Hungerford essays modified interpretations of Blake's "Albion," Keats's "Endymion " and " Hyperion," Shelley's "Adonais " and "Prome- theus Unbound," and Goethe's " Helena." These interpretations are enter- taining reading and they furnish useful hints as to possible sources of imagery and -of untraditional and obscure mythological references and events, as well as suggestions for the meanings of individual passages in the poems. Mr. Hungerford is not content to rest with such accomplishments, however: he elects, with the aid of his special evidence, supplemented by materials from his classical reading (though he does not find it necessary to show that his authors had read the works by which they were supposedly influenced), to offer final solutions to the major problems of the poems he examines. In so doing he is inclined to go beyond the warrant of his facts, and at times quite outreaches scholarly caution in imaginative reconstruction of his author's intentions. Such is the case in his venture at recreating Keats's scheme for the complete " Hyperion." Again, in his anxiety to show that the passage on the " Cave of Quietude " represents Endymion's descent into Hades, he evidently quite neglects the lines that show that the Cave is the Soul, not a place, and appears not to notice that Endymion is still in the air (on the black steed) at the time the passage opens and that, following it, " down his steed him bore/Prone to the green bead of a misty hill." It may be remarked, too, that Mr. Hungerford's impulse to say the final word sometimes leads him to a captious attitude toward the ideas of others. Thus he assures us, on page 100, that his own explanation precludes the possibility of attaching to " Endymion " the " vapid allegories which criticism has attempted to read into the poem." It turns out, however, that it is not to allegory that he objects-for he himself finds moral allegory in the poem- it is only the "vapid" explanations of others that irk him. One would prefer a more tolerant critical attitude. It is when Mr. Hungerford is tentative and explorative, rather than cocksure, that he is best, and he is often enough this way to make his book a useful and challenging document. (C. D. T.)

These five papers were contributed to a symposium on " The Romantic Movement in Europe in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century," at the meeting of the American Historical Association, Section on Intellectual History, held at New York City, December 30, 1940. One might surmise that this symposium was planned with the idea of implementing, with special reference to the field of historical and economic thought, the thesis advanced several years ago by Professor Lovejoy, that any proper study of the Romantic period must begin with recognition of the fact that there are many Romanticisms which must be carefully dis- criminated. We could logically expect in a series of studies based on this conception a summation and analysis of the characteristic ideas of each Romanticism with an indication of the relation of these ideas to each other.</page><page sequence="10">10 THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT: BIBLIOGRAPHY We might also reasonably hope for a synthetic view in which we should see the bearing of each Romanticism on the others and on the field of activity or thought in question. If something like this was the original purpose of the symposium it must be admitted that the results are not an unqualified success. There are papers on German, French, and English Romanticism, it is true, and individually the contributions are informative and stimulating-some of them brilliant. They lack uniformity of attack, however; and it would be an overstatement to say that they do as much as one would hope, to discriminate among the several Romanticisms or to help the reader to a final synthesis of the distinctive effects of each. The German movement is most adequately dealt with in papers by Professors Lovejoy, Briefs, and Anderson, which together give us, perhaps, one of the most comprehensive treatments of the subject to be found-particularly in those aspects of it which have a bearing on economic and political history. Professor Lovejoy's discussion is invaluable as a lesson in the proper methodology for a historian of ideas, and not less so for its able examination of the " ruling ideas " of German Romanticism. And, though there is no final synthesis, the papers of Professors Briefs and Anderson furnish useful supplementary detail and interpretation. The French movement, however, is presented from so limited a point of view that the reader gets little aid in interpreting French Romanticism as a whole, or in discriminating it from the German and English. Professor Fairchild's study of the relation of English Romanticism to the Oxford Movement is generally excellent, and is adequate to its thesis, that the Oxford Movement and Romanticism stem from quite different impulses; but his paper takes a course of its own apart from the general pattern, and the self-imposed limits of his subject do not require a full treatment of the English phase of Romanticism. Furthermore, his view that his own definition of " liberal Romanticism "-which Mr. Lovejoy would no doubt call a rather " personal " one-is the only true Romanticism, and that it applies about equally to the German, French, and English movements, at least in their purer stages, tends to put us back just about where we were before. Mr. Lovejoy made his appeal for the " discrimination of Romanticisms." There is space here for but two tentative critical comments, one on a matter of conclusions, the other on the value and limitations of symposiums in general. The first three writers seem to be in essential agreement on the genetic relationship between certain German Romantic ideas, particularly the concepts of Das Ganze (or " organism ") and Eigentiumlichkeit, and National Socialism; may it not be inquired, however, whether the idea of a unified state, said to be implicit in " organism," and the tendency towards extreme nationalism represented as integral to Eigentiimlichkeit were par- ticularly new in the Romantic era, or are to be charged to it as a unique contribution? Regarding symposiums in general, it may be ventured that this group of papers represents both the strength and weakness of co-operative scholarship. The individual contributions are competent, and each of them adds something, but they fail in the final goal of a synthetic, over-all view. Such seems to be the inevitable upshot of co-operative scholarly effort: it may furnish indispensable materials, but in the end a single comprehensive mind must weld these materials into synthesis, and exhibit them in their rightful and larger relationships. It may not be too audacious to suggest that Professor Lovejoy is the man for such an achievement in the subject of this symposium. (C. D.

Rev. by Albert Guerard in NYHTB June 1, p. 4; by Peter Munro Jacks in NYT Nov. 23, p. 10; by Randall Jarrell in N July 26, p. 75. Allen Tate has placed on Coleridge's shoulders such a heavy load of responsibility for the " positivist," " psychological," and " historical " criti- cism which he deplores, that it-is appropriate to list in this bibliography Section 4 of his essay Literature and Knowledge, the section in which most of his remarks about Coleridge appear (Reason in Madness, pp. 45-51). Without presuming to argue here about Tate's general philosophical position, I must question certain specific assumptions about Coleridge's influence. What ground has Tate for saying that -a confused passage on "poetry " and " a poem " in Chapter 14 of the Biographia " has probably done more damage to critical thought than anything else said by any critic "? VWhy does he attribute such dire results to Coleridge's well recog- nized vacillation between metaphysics and psychology, or to his " Intellect- or-Feeling " dilemma? Was Coleridge the original or even the most danger- ous sinner in these matters? Tate has given some helpful interpretations of Coleridge (and more especially, in other sections of the essay, of his critic I. A. Richards), but his inclination to use Coleridge as a scapegoat seems to me to interfere with the intelligent understanding of at least one im- portant clause in the definition of a poem-that on the relation of parts to whole.

A brilliantly written narrative of Byron's life between his leaving England and his departure for Greece. There is no important new material, but the known facts are interpreted with an intelligence which extracts the truth from legend and produces a credible personality. Although there is little direct treatment of the poetry, it is clear that the author's problem was always to present the man who, living as he did, could have written it. (P. L.) Siegel, Paul.

Griggs has brought to his biography of Coleridge's daughter the results</page><page sequence="13">ENGLISH: STUDIES OF AUTHORS 13 of years of work on Coleridge family letters and other documents, pub- lished and unpublished. As editor of letters by S. T. C. and by his son, Hartley, and as biographer of Hartley, he was well prepared to reconstruct for us Sara Coleridge's life in its domestic and literary relationships. His biography is based largely on MS materials, though it naturally makes use of some letters that were published in Edith Coleridge's Memoir and Letters, and in such recent works as Stephen Potter's A Minnow among Tritons, L. N. Broughton's Sara Coleridge and Henry Reed, and the de Selincourt edition of the Wordsworth letters. Sara is not idealized in this biography, but is portrayed as a sensitive and gifted woman, who deserves to exist in her own right, not simply as her father's daughter. A good deal of light is thrown on various members of the family, including the cousin who became busband, and on Sara's attitude toward them. Grigg's summary of Sara's intellectual work of filial piety in " setting Coleridge's house in order" is an important part of the book, and one that perhaps deserves to be amplified by some philosophical student. Primarily, however, this book is a domestic narrative of the Coleridge family and a small circle of friends, written, with sympathy and psychological sensitiveness. (A. D. S.) Logan, Sister Eugenia.

This is a generally sympathetic and gracefully written biography, but it tells us little or nothing about Keats that we did not already know. Two appendixes, one devoted to the question of whether Keats had a cockney accent, the other containing a letter from a granddaughter of Charles Brown anent the relation of Brown to Abigail O'Donaghue (to whom, according to this letter, he was married), virtually exhaust the new material in the volume. The publisher's blurb promises a book in which " Keats the Poet, about whom so much has been solemnly written " and " Keats, the gay, tragic, sprightly little figure" about whom so little has been said, are re- united with " affectionate, shrewd understanding." But in reality the poet gets scant attention in this book. Lady Askwith's interest is distinctly in the events of Keats's life, his personal doings, his friendships, his sex life, his love affair with Fanny Brawne, his tragic last days. She shows only a subordinate concern for the poems. Her general comment on Keats as a</page><page sequence="15">ENGLISH: STUDIES OF AUTHORS 15 poet is that " our attitude towards him should be that of his own towards the thrush "-which has no knowledge and frets for none yet sings a song of native warmth to which "the evening listens." When she cites poetry it is usually to a biographical end, as in the case of "La Belle Dame," which she appears to regard (erroneously, surely) as a poem about Fanny Brawne, and of the wooing scene in "Lamia," the content of which she imagines Keats learned from Fanny. The Keats Lady Askwith presents is human and likeable, but, it is to be feared, somewhat reduced in dimensions. The emphasis is less on the earnestly aspiring young poet, more on those personal things that have appeal for the lover of fiction. The author recognizes on occasion a seriously thoughtful Keats, who was developing in character and spiritual depth; but she does not follow such ideas through. She quotes the Mansion of Life letter, but shows little of its significance-slips away from it, indeed, in a swan dive into immaterialities; she cites Keats's utterances on the need for knowledge and the passage on the Vale of Soul-making, but lets them stand without interpretation, apparently untroubled by the contradiction they offer to her own idea that we must always look upon Keats as he himself thought of the thrush. This is a layman's book. It furnishes an interesting and generally reliable account of the facts of Keats's life, with emphasis on those intimate relation- ships in which the reading public delights; it does little, however, to illuminste or to add to the appreciation of " Endymion," or " Hyperion," or " Lamia," or the great odes.

Mabbott, T. 0. (See Wordsworth) Pershing, James H. " John Keats: when was he born and when did he die? " PMLA 55 (1940). 802-814. (Cf. Briggs above.) Mr. Pershing undertakes to examines such evidence for the dates of Keats's birth and death as would have standing in a court of law. He finds that from the legal point of view, he must accept the entry in the baptismal register at St. Botolph's church, namely October 31, 1795, as the date of Keats's birth; also, again from the standpoint of legal evidence, that the date given on the register of burials and on the tombstone at Rome-to wit, February 24, 1821-must be regarded as correct for the date of Keats's death. Mr. Pershing also takes into account the question of the reliability of Severn's testimony, arguing that his loss of sleep and possible lapses in memory are reasons for challenging the validity of his conflicting statements. Mr. Briggs argues cogently against the conclusiveness of Mr. Pershing's findings, maintaining that, in view of the full evidence, the date of Keats's birth is still uncertain, and that the assumption that his death fell on February 24 rather than February 23 is erroneous. The entry in the parish register may have been carelessly made, Mr. Briggs argues, or the parents may even have forgotten by December 18-the date of the baptism-the exact day of John's birth. Moreover, the issue is clouded by the fact that the Apothecaries' Certificate of July 25, 1816, speaks of Keats as of " full age." As for the date of Keats's death, Mr. Briggs points out that if Severn's testimony was unreliable on one point it is fair to infer that it was question- 2</page><page sequence="16">16 THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT: BIBLIOGRAPHY able on others; he holds further that in citing Severn, Pershing neglects one statement about Keats's death in favor of another, and misreads the one he uses. Even the date on the register of burials and on the tombstone is on the authority of Severn, and may well represent the time the death was reported rather than the day it occurred. Weighing the data presented by Mr. Pershing and Mr. Briggs, one may conclude that Mr. Pershing probably has the better of the argument on the birthday of Keats, but that, while the lawyer is perhaps right on the legalistic aspect-of the matter, on the basis of common-sense evidence Mr. Briggs has a sufficient edge to leave the question of the time of Keats's death at least in doubt.

The author has studied Balzac, " not as a social reformer, but as a social historian, faithful recorder of events, conditions and trends of society." As a matter of fact, the undertaking was difficult, for a novelist always remains the creator of his own world and the sole judge of its truth. Nevertheless, the thesis offers us a picture of society such as it is represented in the novels of Balzac, as well as a study of the principal questions of the era, family and individualism, the role of money, government, church and religion, education, marriage, class conflicts, reform movements, etc. Spitzer, M.

In this thesis, the author has undertaken to trace the origin and develop- ment of Lamartine's ideas-metaphysical, religious, social, economic, political, etc. Unanimism is the tie which has served to unite the different aspects of Lamartinian thought. Perhaps, one should not insist too much on the analogies between contemporary unanimism and the theories of the Romantic poet, who belonged to an intellectual milieu very different from ours. In any case, the origins of Lamartine's ideas are clearly indicated in this study, as well as the relationship which exists between the Lamartinian concept of the world, of the destiny of man, and the political and historical theories of the poet. The work is interesting, not only for the study of Lamartine, but also for the knowledge of ideas in the Romantic period. Lamennais. Bede, J. A.

The question proposed is: What was Nietzsche's opinion of Wagner's music dramas when he wrote the final version of his Die Geburt der Trg6cdie? The conclusion: Nietzsche had by then given up Wagner as the chief hope of a tragic renascence and now regarded him as representing the "tragic idyl" and as preaching renunciation and redemption as clearly and (to Nietzsche) as disappointingly as Schopenhauer.

However, he fails to present clearly the characteristics of that type of individual in Biedermeier literature, although for the sake of his argument that would seem to be called for. (R. T. I.) Gode von Aesch, Alexander. Natural Science in German Romanti- cism. N. Y. Columbia University Press. This 300-page book is heavy but also meaty. It is characterized by a new approach, which endeavors to consider two intellectual fields, literature and natural science (as they appear in Germany between 1795 and 1830), as manifestations of one and the same spirit, viz. in their " physiognomic identity." Goethe, in whose writings this identity is most obvious, furnishes the starting point and leads to the romanticists (not only the imaginative writers, but also the philosophers and "scientists "), whose thought is called " biocentric " because in it the phenomenal world is seen as a physiog- nomic representation of universal life. Romantic science and literature are then studied, not in terms of influence but in their physiognomic identity. Much attention is paid to eighteenth-century poetry of the Lucretian kind, and this leads to the question of man's relation to the surrounding world as the basic problem of all modern universalism. It is considered under the following heads: The Unity of Organic Nature: Man and Animal; Time and Eternity: The Problem of Evolution; Romantic Anthropomorphism: The Biological Problem; The Infinity of Nature; Type and Organism; Totality: The Psychic Problem of Ego and Cosmos; Vital Force; Man the Measure of All Things; Physiognomics; Cosmic Poetry: The Quest for a Modem Mythos. The work is extremely thoughtful, mature and discriminatingly done. Clearly it represents years of reflection on the problems which it discusses quite comprehensively and competently. But it can not be adequately pre- sented in a brief review. Nor could its method be applied to any period but German romanticism. No doubt the most damaging remark that can be made about the book will issue from the scientists, whom we can hear asking: " But by what stretch of the imagination can those materials which Dr. Gode von Aesch discusses so seriously be called science at all?

But it is neither critical, nor scholarly, nor complete, although Rudolf Bach, who has supplied an introduction on Eichendorff, may be regarded an authority on German romanticism. It differs widely from the earlier Eichendoff edition of the Insel house by Franz Schultz in offering a fresh, though also fairly representative selection of the lyrics, some under new titles. An index of all first lines, including the poems occurring in the prose writings, is a novelty. Besides the usual tales and novels, the satire Auch ich war in Arkadien, the comedy Die Freier and among other autobiographic pieces, the Kapitel von meiner Geburt are included. (E. H. Z.)

The article presents a valuable letter, recently found in Philadelphia, from Jakob Grimm to Kemble, dated Cassel, July 14, 1840. As background for the letter the authors offer interesting material on the relations of Kemble and the Grimms, and also on the difficulties Kemble experienced when he vociferously sang the praises of the Grimms as scholars.

Hoffmann as a Lyric Writer . MLQ 92 (1941) .43-58. This article calls attention to the "hitherto ignored" lyric poetry scat- tered throughout Hoffmann's prose and asks why it was inserted and what the origin and significance of this romantic practice of interspersion may be. It points out that lloffmann was not a leader in the field of the lyric, and</page><page sequence="25">GERMAN: STUDIES OF AUTHORS 25 that his poetry merely indulges given playful caprices and shows his innate musical bent. But Porterfield makes no attempt to answer his own deeper questions of origin and meaning of verse interspersion in romantic prose. He might have gone far toward finding the answer in Paul Neuburger's Die Verseinlage in der Prosadichtung der Romantik (Palaestra), Leipzig, 1924, a work which he does not even mention. (E. HI. Z.)

The author finds that the attitude of any literary movement toward the "Marchen" throws light upon the character of that movement. This is especially true of romanticism, which unlike Enlightenment, Storm and Stress (both reveal hostility toward the spirit of the " Miirchen ") and Classicism (it seeks a compromise between imagination and reality) uses the Marchen " atmosphere as its very own. Of all the romanticists, Novalis intertwines and blends " Marchen " and reality most inextricably, so that the former finally becomes the goal of all world happenings and a part of Novalis' metaphysics of history, making him a denizen of both spheres at the same time.

Deutsche Ausgabe von Willy Grabert. Hamburg, 1940. Several years ago Countess de Pange, a descendant of Mme de Stael, discovered about 150 letters of A. W. Schlegel and others to Mme de Stael in the Broglie collection. They were published and utilized in Auguste- Guillaume Schlegel et Madame de Stael, d'apres des documents inedits (Paris, Albert, 1938). The Schlegel letters, all in French, have now been translated into German by Willy Grabert for this edition and are here reproduced incompletely in this form. These two facts detract markedly from the value and significance of the collection. The letters reveal Schlegel's loyal German sentiments and throw some new light upon his late Bonn period. (E. H. Z.)</page><page sequence="26">26 THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT: BIBLIOGRAPHY Schlegel, Friedrich. Kainz, Friedrich. Friedrich Schlegels Sprach- philosophie. Zeitschrift fur Deutsche Geisteswissenschaft 3 (1941) .263-82. Although this article is somewhat loosely organized, it presents, never- theless, many important features of Schlegel's conception of language. Most valuable perhaps is the fact that Kainz shows the gradual development away from an almost purely philosophical interest toward an ever greater scientific consideration of the observable linguistic data. Paulsen, Wolfgang. Friedrich Schlegels "Alarcos" und die Um- bildung der Friihromantik. MLN 56 (1941).513-21. This brief but significant article shows that the drama Alarcos is just as important for understanding its author as is the novel Lucinde. Both are products of his spiritual crisis, and represent a settling of old accounts and a pioneering step into the future. Both are thoroughly autobiographic and seek new forms and new content-the beginning of their author's climb up- ward to the light, to knowledge. Schlegel is here groping for an esthetic and philosophic support outside the individual. In a misleading classicistic form he expresses his early romantic ideal of freedom. (E. H. Z.)

Hermann discusses penetratingly the filiations and differences between Leopardi's classical aspects and modern anti-Romanticism, especially as manifested in such writers as Seilliere, Lasserre, Maurras, et alia. He con- cludes that, somewhat as in Leopardi's case, they are Romantics more than they are aware, and that one of the chief differences between L. and these gentlemen consists in the fact that while Leopardi was sincere if mistaken in his strictures (of De Breme), the latter are merely using the whole European Romantic movement as a stalking horse while trying their level best to dis- credit the democratic ideas emergent from 18th century revolutions.
