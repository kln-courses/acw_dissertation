<plain_text><page sequence="1">A TIV POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS IDEA* PAUL BOHANNAN T IS, since the monumental studies of the thirties and forties, fairly simple for the anthropologist of an African society to record that aspect of the social and political structure which the French call morphologie sociale. It is not equally easy for him to record and analyze the workings of his society-to analyze the vectors of social process. In order to make an analysis of social morphology we must investigate the relevant words, concepts, and images with which the people of that society themselves visualize it. It is equally true that we must analyze the rele- vant words, images, and concepts by which a people discuss the process of their society if we are to understand these processes. We must know not only about indigenous ideas of "political organization" but also about indigenous ideas of "government"; not only about words for "lineage" and "clan" but also those for judicial processes and executive action; not only concepts of "god" or "fetish" but those for "worship." This article is an exercise in the exposition of a Tiv idea which deals both with government and with ritual-the word tar. It can-very inadequately as we shall see-be translated "country" or "land"; sometimes one can translate it "home." Tar is an especially rich word with an internal structure which gives us a key to the linkage of several concepts which are to us, thinking in English words and categories, distinguishable-indeed, vastly different-systems of thought and ac- tion. The word has meanings which we must take into consideration when we examine the social morphology of Tiv society. There are still other aspects of it which must be taken into consideration when we examine Tiv notions of economics and the food quest.1 There are still further notions in the word tar which we would classify as belonging to Tiv cosmographical world-view, and to religion. The concept is most adequately studied by first comparing and contrasting the word tar with several other words, and then later investigating carefully some of its usages. The words I have paired for contrast are not specifically so paired by * Research among the Tiv of central Nigeria was carried out for twenty-six months, be- tween 1949 and 1953, with the financial assistance of the Social Science Research Council, The Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Colonial Social Science Research Council, and the Government of Nigeria, to all of whom gratitude and acknowledgment is expressed. 1 Other discussions of tar will be found in Laura and Paul Bohannan, The Tiv of Central Nigeria (London: International African Institute, 1953), pp. 20-22; Paul Bohannan, Tiv Farm and Settlement (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1954), pp. 8-14. 137 VOL. 11, 1955</page><page sequence="2">138 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY Tiv-all the statements which I shall make were told me by Tiv in one context or another, but the arrangement is an analytical one, not an ethnographic one. The first section will review briefly (I) the relationship between tar and ipaven, the segment in the lineage system; the second (II) will contrast tar with nya (earth) and both with Aondo, sky and God. Finally, section III compares and contrasts tar with the imborivungu and the po'or, two very important parts of Tiv religion. I. TAR-IPA VEN (LINEAGE SEGMENT) A tar is a territory occupied by a lineage segment (ipaven). Tiv organize them- selves into what we call, in anthropological English, a lineage system. They formulate this organization in terms of genealogies running patrilineally from themselves back seventeen or eighteen generations to "Tiv," the original ancestor of them all.2 Each of the ancestors in the genealogies who is postulated to have lived more than four or five generations ago lends his name to the social group of his agnatic descendants. These social groups, who call themselves by the plural form of the name of their agnatic ancestor, form the basis of communities. The areas of the smallest lineages to form local groups come to about 1200 acres or rather indefinitely larger, and the population is from 150 to as many as 1500 people. This area, within which eighty-three percent of the resident males are agnatic members of the lineage which is associated with it, is called the tar. The name of the tar is the same as the name of the agnatic lineage which inhabits it- the plural form of the patronymic ancestor. All of the homesteads and farms within this area-and they will be fairly evenly spread over the ground-are the homes of agnatic members of the lineage associated with the tar, or of their kins- men or "guests" (mba va inya) to whom they have given temporary cultivation and building rights. In such a situation, Tiv refer to the lineage (nongo) which is associated with a tar as a "segment" (ipaven). The term "segment" is applied to a social group; the word tar is applied to the area occupied by that social group. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the term "segment" has overtones of both descent principles and spacial group principles. The term tar on the other hand, refers to the same group as a co-residential unit, and it refers to the ground on which they reside and farm. Two minimal utar which are side by side, whose associated lineage segments are descended from a common ancestor, are taken together and form a larger, inclusive segment and a larger, inclusive tar, both named after the common an- cestor. At this new, higher level of the lineage system--associated with larger and 2 See Laura Bohannan, A Genealogical Charter (Africa, vol. 22, pp. 301-315, 1952), p. 302.</page><page sequence="3">A TIV IDEA 139 more inclusive utar-the same statement can be made: two larger utar which lie side by side, whose associated segments are descended from a common ancestor, are taken together to form a still larger segment and a still larger tar. The largest tar which Tiv see, in this particular set of images is "Tivland"-Tar Tiv. Thus the first meaning of tar-and I believe it can be said to be the "basic" meaning-is the notion of a territory associated with and defined by a social group, in this case a lineage which Tiv will consent to call an ipaven, a segment. We might, to make the comparison clear, say that the system of utar is a view of geography, for Tiv have no place names (except those of streams and hills) except the names of their utar. The tar is the country, the land of the Tiv; it contains many smaller utar which are defined by the lineages into which Tiv divide them- selves and in terms of which they see some of the most significant of their relation- ships with one another. II. TAR-NYA (EARTH) That Tiv do see the word tar in connection with social groups was indicated also by the answer I received from an elder when I asked him to help me dis- tinguish tar from nya, earth or soil. After some thought he said, "Plants grow in the earth, but come up on the tar. Plants and people and their compounds com- prise the tar." Therefore, tar can be said to represent, at least in part, something which we might compare with our notions of human geography, whereas the word for earth is associated solely with what we see as physical geography or with cosmography. Tiv tell me that the earth-this same word, nya-is a cone of soil (again nya) which is surrounded by water which they call the "great river" (ifi i tamen), the sea. The summit of this cone of earth is at a high hill reputed to lie vaguely to the southeast of Tivland, but not too far away. Some Tiv say that this hill may be among the Sonkwala Mountains, others that it is in the area known to us as the Cameroons Highlands. But no Tiv care to place the summit of the earth anywhere precisely. All insist that they have never been there, so they do not know exactly where it may be; however, it is a place to which a person might well go. From this summit of earth, all rivers flow first through the land of the black men, including the land-the tar-of the Tiv. They become larger as they con- tinue their descent, and the rivers enter the land of the Europeans, eventually flowing into the great river which surrounds all earth. Tiv tell me that they live comparatively near the summit of the hill which is the summit of the earth. Like most people, they hold an ethnocentric view of the universe. All of the other black men, they say, live nearby, scattered about over</page><page sequence="4">140 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY the large area on and just below the summit. All Europeans live farther down the hill than do Tiv and the other black men. One informant-an ex-policeman-had talked (in Hausa, for the most part) with several District Officers about their homes, and all had told him that they had to cross great bodies of water-much larger than the Benue-to reach their homes. Therefore, he reasoned, their homes must be farther down hill. "The huts of black men," he told me, "are along the small rivers; the huts of Europeans are farther down, near the great river." Another man, an ex-soldier who had been in Burma during the war, told me that the Indians, the Burmese, the Japanese, the British, and the Russians all lived near the bank of the great river. He had, he said, travelled on the great river to get from Lagos to Burma. Tiv do not know and do not consider whether there is anything beyond the great river, that is, beyond the sea. All Tiv with whom I discussed these matters insisted, "We have never been there, so how should we know?" When I insisted on asking this question, "Can there be more land on the other side of the great river?" one man said No--if there is more land on the other bank, you have reached only another of the large rivers (dzege-ifi) above its confluence with the great river (ifi i tamen). It can be so large it might easily be mistaken for the great river. I have been told that in all probability the great river never ends; but all informants insisted that they could not know. The problem of what lies beyond the great river is considered by Tiv to be a difficult problem, but also one without significance. Most were interested in and curious about Europe and America; none was curious about what might lie beyond the great river. Tar, which is the social aspect of space, can be correlated in many respects with this notion of earth. Tiv do so primarily in terms of a metaphor. They say and teach their children that Tar Tiv is the back of a man, stooping with his head to the southeast. The direction of the man's head, which is also toward the summit of the earth, is called the "top (or head) of the tar" (ityou ki taregh), while the reciprocal direction, northwest, is known as "the bottom (or buttocks) of the tar" (ityo tar). Northeast and southwest are referred to as the right and left flanks or sides of the country (mbusa tar i mese, mbusa tar i yaan respectively). There are no other words for "cardinal" directions in the Tiv language than these. There is a tendency on the part of many (particularly younger) Tiv to correlate the "top of the tar" with the rising sun, and the English notion "east." But Ukum elders have pointed out to me the difference between the "top of the tar" and the "sunrise." In MbaDuku and Shangev Ya, many elders indicated the "top of the tar" as lying at about 1100 (though there was as much as 150 varia- tion in either direction) and some declared that it had nothing whatever to do</page><page sequence="5">A TIV IDEA 141 with the sun, but rather with the hill which is the summit of the earth. Though I believe there is a tendency for the "top of the tar" to change direction from one area to another, it is usually east by southeast. More or less actively assuming this metaphor of the man leaning southeast, Tiv can also indicate directions by means of prepositions: sha means "up" (or "on"); shin means "down" (or "in"); and ken means "across" (or "beside" in some contexts). When one goes toward a place to the southeast, one goes "up" to it; to the northwest "down" to it; and in either of the other two directions "across" to it. These words are, however, applied to vertical position (as in hills) irrespective of their cardinal direction; and one always goes "up" to the top of a compound or to the top of a field. There are verbs which also carry these direc- tional ideas. Sen means to "go down," whether it be down hill (this is the verb used of running water) or toward the northwest. Unde is to "go up," whether toward the southeast or uphill. If the direction of the incline is in conflict either word may be used.3 It is seldom, however, that Tiv give the traveller directions by indicating cardinal directions or these metaphorical directions relating to the earth and the tar. Rather, they do so in terms of the various smaller utar through which a man must travel. If a man in MbaDuku asks the way to Jato Aka's, he will not be told to "go east" or "go toward the top of the tar" (though the verb may imply it), but rather something like this: "You leave (due) Kunav and enter Shangev; then you cross it and enter Ikurav, but don't go very far into Ikurav but leave it again and go into Turan. Turan is Jato Aka's tar." Within their own country, and those nearby, Tiv do not need cardinal directions, for all adults have a pretty good idea of the location and juxtaposition of the utar: they know the relative location of all small lineages nearby, and the relative position of all the major segments of Tivland. I am not, of course, suggesting that in the West we do not do the same thing. But when we do indicate direction and distance in this way, we do so-like Tiv- when we are speaking to people familiar with the country, who think in terms of communities rather than in terms of mere lines, angles, and distances. I believe that Tiv always think of space in these community terms. There is no uniformity of opinion whether the metaphor of the man leaning forward must apply only to their own tar-Tar Tiv-or whether it is applied to a larger area, containing the utar of other peoples as well. I have been told both 3 These facts have struck other writers on the Tiv (Rupert East, tr., Akiga's Story, London: Oxford University Press, 1939, p. 16; R. C. Abraham. The Tiv People, London: Crown Agents, 1940, p. 27).</page><page sequence="6">142 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY that the Udam (who live to the south of the Tiv) are on the right hand side of the tar, and that they are off the tar, to the right. This is obviously a matter of indif- ference, for one expression gives the position of the Udam as well as the other. Yet in relation to Tar Tiv, the land of any other people, or the collectivity of lands of other peoples, may be called "outside" (won). If a traveller is going someplace within Tiv country, he tells the inquirer--an inquiry of destination is a standard greeting-the name of the tar to which he is proceeding. If he is going outside Tiv country, it is usually sufficient to say "I'm going outside." The same expression is used of going outside a hut. It is not, however, used for going outside the tar of one's own lineage into another tar of Tivland. The Tiv are very much aware of the metaphorical nature of their representa- tion of Tar Tiv as the back of a man. They call it a "metaphor"4 and they are the first to insist that the metaphor is silly if it is carried too far-I was once teased mightily for taking it literally enough to ask if the man had a name. We might view it as a mnemonic device for straightening out the directional prepositions. Comparison of the word tar with the Tiv word for "earth," nya, has made it possible to draw certain further conclusions about the nature of tar. By earth, nya, is meant soil, dirt-the physical concrete earth. There need be no social reference. But tar is the social and political arrangement of people and communities in space. The summit of the earth lies to the southeast of Tivland; the top of the tar is that portion of Tivland, or that portion of black man's country which lies to the south- east, thought to be closest to the summit of the earth because of the direction of flow of rivers in Tiv country. Today, however, the "top of the tar" has further meanings, which one hesi- tates to call either "extended" or "metaphorical." I have heard it used to refer to the territories of politically important lineage segments. In 1950 I heard the seg- ment of MbaDuku referred to as the "top of the tar" by persons of other lineage segments of Kunav, of which MbaDuku is itself a segment. Their explanation, to me when asked specifically, was twofold: MbaDuku is the senior (tamen) lineage of all Tiv country, and all the streams of MbaDuku flow into Tiv terri- tory, not out of it. In 1952, I heard both Turan and Ngenev lineage of Ukum called the "top of the tar." The same reasons were given for doing so. Thus, the notion can be used as a metaphor for political importance, and when it is feasible, the metaphor is given further validity by geographical position. 4 Orun-kwagh, literally a "speaking thing." The kwagh, when used as a substantive, has the purpose of giving materiality to modifying participles. I think it perfectly reasonable to trans- late this notion as "speaking device," almost "speaking tool" (work tools are called "working kwagh" etc.). The best English translation varies between "metaphor" and "idiom."</page><page sequence="7">A TIV IDEA 143 Tar can never be considered apart from the people who inhabit it; a stretch of empty country, Tiv say, is the tar of those people who last lived on it, though they have moved away. If MbaDuku were to move into the area now occupied by the Udam tribes to their southwest, the land they left-as well as their new site- would be Tar MbaDuku. If Ute (an equivalent lineage to MbaDuku which bor- ders it to the north) were to come into the site left by MbaDuku, it would thence- forward be known as Tar Ute. Tiv refuse to consider the possibility of a piece of ground (nya) which has never been inhabited. Finally, when Tiv speak of land shortage, they say that it is the earth or soil, the nya, which is insufficient or, more likely, the fields or the fallow are insufficient. Tiv never say that the tar is insufficient: such a phrase would be meaningless. Soil or earth-it is the same word-may be good or bad; the criterion is the pro- ductiveness of the soil. The tar may be good or spoiled; the criterion is to be found in the social relationships of the people and the social groups who, in their spatial aspect, comprise the tar. It ought also to be mentioned that both Tiv dictionaries that have been pub- lished give one of the possible translations of tar as "the world." It is my opinion that Tiv have no notion comparable to the English notion of "world" and that we had better be more precise: tar, as opposed to the Tiv word sha which means "the upwards," can mean what we would call "world" as opposed to the heavens; but a translation such as "here below" is somewhat more accurate. Tiv also some- times express another notion which we might express in an idiom of the "world" when they say "all the utar (utar chii)" meaning Tivland and all the lands of all other peoples. Here also the basic referent is to all the peoples of what we would call the world, in whatever tar they may live; the reference is not to the physical world itself. Tar refers to the peopled world; sha or "upwardness" to the unpeo- pled "above." In precisely the same way, Tiv classify closely related plants as "those down in the stream" (shin wagh) and "those up on the tar." Tar, in this sense, means "on peopled, dry land" as against the swampy stream-beds which men enter, but in which they do not live." There is one other meaning of nya, the word for "earth," which must be con- sidered lest it be thought that I am unfairly selecting my information. Tiv often juxtapose this notion of earth (nya) with that of heavens (Aondo). Aondo is a most difficult word which has been used, correctly, by the missionaries to translate 5 For instance, one species of plant commonly used for soup is ityenger on the tar, while another which Tiv consider to be closely related is ityenger in the stream. There are many pairs of such terms, but the only ones I recorded which I can identify are agbur sha tar (Strophanthus hispidus) and agbur shin wagh (Clerondendron capitatum).</page><page sequence="8">144 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY "God." It is also the only way to say "sky." It means both these ideas, yet I am convinced that to say "Sky-God" in English gives a completely false impression. "Heavens" is not much better. There is a common intensive "God (Adndo) knows and the earth (nya) knows that . .. ." Tiv say that since sky or God and earth are always present, they "know" (fa) all things. It must be insisted, however, that simply because this might be translated as "God knows and the earth also knows" we cannot for that reason assume that Tiv assimilate or correlate God and earth in any way. No sacrifices are made to the earth; there is nothing which can be called a shrine which is connected with the earth in any way. The earth is not personalized-at least not to the extent that it is among other Western African peoples such as the Ibo, who even make anthropomorphic representations of it. Tiv language allows anthropomorphizing, though not so much as English, and the anthropo- morphic qualities of the earth are a function of this linguistic factor. Tar is not contrasted with Aondo as earth can be contrasted with Aondo. I have never heard it done, and I cannot think of any situation in which it might arise. Tar does, however, have religious meanings and usages which are to be considered in the next section. We have seen that tar refers not only to the spatial and territorial aspects of some social groups, but that it also has the further meaning of "peopled world"- that is, it is the social world of men, contrasted with the non-social world of things. It has been suggested by most of the Englishmen with whom I have dis- cussed this matter that the Tiv word tar means "home." That is to say, as the territory associated with a lineage, it is the "home" of that lineage.6 I think it should be pointed out, however, that there are other ideas and notions in Tiv which must be brought in to get the entire meaning of either English or American usage of "home." When a Tiv says "I am going home" he uses the word for com- pound, or homestead, not the word tar. A man's tar is always the territory associ- ated with his agnatic lineage; his compound may be in some other tar. In this latter case, he will never say "This is my tar" but rather, "My compound is in the tar of so-and so," or simply "I live in the tar of so and so." Thus, tar is home in the sense that it is where one belongs, but not where one actually is living. Similarly, Tiv marriage is virilocal. When a woman goes to join her husband in his com- pound, her tar is still the territory of her natal lineage. She can say she is a wife in the tar of her husband, and that she lives there, but never that it is her tar, for 6 The word "home" means something slightly different in American speech than it does in English, and I am not completely satisfied with this translation--this is one reason that I have retained the Tiv word. Yet, many aspects of the word "home" are to be found in Tiv tar.</page><page sequence="9">A TIV IDEA 145 indeed it is not. Her compound-her home in that sense--indeed is always referred to as the compound of her husband, after her marriage. But her tar is the territory of the lineage to which she was filiated at birth. III. REPAIRING THE TAR. We have emphasized, in both the preceding sections, that tar refers both to the local group of people, and to the social relationships which exist among them. The complementarity--the unity, in fact-of these two meanings can be illus- trated in several usages of the word tar: first, the notion of "eating tar" and second that of "repairing tar." "To eat (ya) tar" means to feast; but more important, it means "to enjoy prosperity." It is always contrasted with warfare and violence: the opposite of being aggressive and violent is to "eat tar." The peaceful, quiet man who is strong without being aggressive is the Tiv ideal human type. Such a man will, it is said, always "eat tar," that is, be prosperous: he will have a sufficiency of crops; his hunting will be good; he will have many wives and children; and he will be gener- ous, successful, and well loved. To "eat tar" is the reward of virtue.7 All of these meanings-that of local group, that of the values in human rela- tionships, and that of prosperity-are to be found in a veritable knot of ambigui- ties in the notion of "repairing the tar." Tiv, like many African peoples, often use the phrase "to spoil (vihi) the tar." Vihi is an expression of general unpleasantness which has two antonyms: do (either as what we would classify in English as an adjective or a verb--the dis- tinction is not so simple or clear-cut in Tiv) which means "good" or "to make good," and the verb sdr, "to repair or to set right." We are interested mainly in that aspect of the word "spoil" (vihi) which is an antonym to "repair," and not as an antonym to "good" (in which usages vihi means bad, ugly, or unpleasant). To spoil a bicycle is to wreck it and make it unuseable; to repair (sdr) it is to put it in working order again. These words can be used of any utensils, tools, or apparatus, and of some mystical forces as well. The word vihi, "to spoil," has other meanings which throw light on the usage we are investigating. When a person does something to you or for you which you do not like (especially if you can make a case that he acted in some way incorrectly), you say that he spoils you, that he spoils your heart, or that he spoils the tar, any of which we might 7 Several persons who have read this paper have asked how I know that these meanings of the word tar form a single concept. How, indeed, does one know a word from its homonym? I have questioned Tiv on this point and been constantly assured that the tar associated with the lineage and the tar which one eats, and which means prosperity, are the same tar. There are, even if the words are homonyms, participations between the two meanings.</page><page sequence="10">146 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY translate rather pedantically as "he ruined the basis of relationships between us." Thus tar is one of the things which can be spoiled; it can also be repaired. The tar is, in its nature, good (do); when it is not spoiled it is usually described as "cool" (ndoho); if it has been spoiled it is described as "hot" (tse). When I asked Tiv about the meaning of the phrase "to spoil the tar," the immediate reply was always, "A man who goes around looking for a quarrel (kelen iyongo) spoils the tar," and some-especially in the area in which we had recently experienced a war-would add, "A war spoils the tar more than anything else." One informant went on to point out that when the elders stop a war, they do so by walking into the middle of the fighting, unarmed, carrying branches of ayande (Marantochloa flexuosa); this, he said, was the first step in repairing tar. We con- tinued to talk about repairing tar; after a great deal of thinking and discussing, he decided that the real meaning is to sit and listen quietly and dispassionately to all sides of a dispute or case, then to give a just decision. Repairing tar is a matter of arbitration. What this informant said, in effect, is that repairing tar deals with law and with authority and force in society-in a word, repairing tar is government. To repair tar is to govern or to arbitrate justly. The Resident of Benue Prov- ince at the time we made our study was said to know more of repairing tar than any other European. When an elder or a group of elders settle a quarrel, at the end of which the principals take water into their mouths and blow it out in a spray to show that they have no suppressed anger in their hearts, the arbitrating elders are said to have repaired tar. When a Native Administration court sits, it is said to be repairing tar. Settlement of land disputes-no matter by whom it may be done --is called repairing tar. I emphasize that today the main meaning of "repair tar" is to arbitrate or govern. It can be applied to any arbitrator, to any person with governing functions derived from the British Administration, or to any man who is known to give good advice and to have the respect of and influence within his community. So far as I am aware, this basic meaning of "repairing tar" is not pointed out in the literature on the Tiv. Rather, another and more sensational and esoteric aspect has received attention. "To repair tar" has a second meaning, the investigation of which takes us immediately into the difficult idiom of ambiguity, metaphor, and equivocality in which Tiv discuss religion and witchcraft. This second meaning of tar is to be found in the secret language (liam) of the mbatsav. Mbatsav are thought to be an organization of the elders of the community, in their combined roles of "witches" and mystical protectors of the community. In their nocturnal meetings</page><page sequence="11">A TIV IDEA 147 -and also in communicating with one another in daylight-they are said to use a special "language." This "language" is in fact a series of noun substitutions which varies from one part of the country to another. Tar is one of the everyday words which is given a special symbolic meaning in the language of the mbatsav, or league of witches. Akiga says, and Captain Abraham also notes,8 and my southern informants agree that tar refers to the magical instrument which Tiv call an owl pipe or imborivungu. The owl pipe is made from a human tibia-a few were of cast brass-which is decorated with gum from any of several trees, and the red seeds of Abras precatorius. Often cowries and bits of felt and mirror are added. It has a membrane of spider's egg case covering one of the openings, and a single hole in it, like a flute. In some cases the top is open, in some cases not. This membrane makes the owl pipe what is usually called a "voice disguiser" by museologists.f It is talked or hummed into, and the membrane changes the char- acter of the voice. The owl pipe is usually given the shape of a human head with a very long neck; sometimes the entire human body is represented, particularly in the brass specimens. According to Akiga, there are two types of owl pipe: those of individuals (or mtswen) and those of patrilineal descent groups (ity6). The ownership of a private owl pipe is a very closely guarded secret, because if it is known to exist, the patrilineal descent group will "demand that he should give it to them, and they should perform the rites together,"'0 and that it be used by them for repairing tar. Akiga is most explicit that the owl pipe of an individual can become an owl pipe of a patrilineal descent group, but that although owl pipes of descent groups are used to repair tar, those of individuals are not. Another magical apparatus sometimes said to be represented in the language of the mbatsav by the word tar is the one which Tiv call the "father's head," the ityough ki ter. My own informants in eastern Tivland told me this, and Captain Downes tells me that he has also heard the word tar so used. The head of the father, which is sometimes called tar, is the skull said to be that of a former mas- ter of the po'or. Such skulls are owned by some-by no means all-masters of this "fetish" (akombo). Actually, the owl pipe and the father's head are both parts of the more inclusive mystical apparatus called the po'or. There may thus be a regional variation or it may be that anything connected with the po'or can be called tar. To repair tar, then, sometimes means to perform a ceremony for the owl pipe 8 Akiga's original manuscript (not in translated portion in East, Akiga's Story); Abraham, The Tiv People, p. 36. 9 Henry Balfour, Ritual and Secular Uses of Vibrating Membranes as Voice Disguisers (Journal, Royal Anthropological Institute, vol. 78, pp. 45-69, 1948). 10 East, Akiga's Story, p. 226.</page><page sequence="12">148 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY or the skull. The use of the word "repair" in this context is not unusual, for per- formance of almost all rites associated with fetishes are referred to by this word." Akiga says that the ceremony for repairing the individually owned owl pipe necessi- tates no more than the killing of a mouse, but that the repairing of the owl pipe of a patrilineal desecent group-repairing tar-requires the life and blood of a person. He notes further that though some people say that a person is killed for the owl pipe, those whose knowledge he respects say that the ceremony is actually performed with the aborted foetus of a first pregnancy. He also states specifically (in different places) that the rite is carried out by both all the members of the patrilineal descent group in question, and by the mbatsav.'2 In the same way, "to repair tar" may sometimes mean performing a ceremony involving killing a chicken for purposes of activating a force thought to be inher- ent in a properly consecrated "father's head." As in the case of the owl pipe, this is thought to involve the sacrifice of a human life in some way or another. Usually the actual mechanism is a mystery, and its being a mystery is part of its value. Any death which occurs in the community can be-but may not be-attributed to the master of the po'or and the mbatsav. They need human lives to carry out their work of "repairing tar," which involves the prosperity of the social group. We can read such a statement as a metaphorical expression that the social group and its well-being must come before the life and well-being of any specific, given individual. All reports agree that the matter of "repairing tar" (owl pipe or father's head) is connected with the fertility of farms and crops, with hunting, with fertility of women and with health-all of these things at once. Now, again, I want to look at the possibility of translation of tar in this con- text with the English word "home." It definitely gives us part of the meaning of the word to say that government as well as religious activities are concerned in repairing the home-especially when we think of that aspect of "home" which deals with rather larger communities than just the house and family. What we are doing if we do make such a translation is to make the English word "home" mean the sum of social relationships, as well as the peace and prosperity with which it is desirable to endow these relationships. The redefinition of the English word necessary to make the translation is very extensive. The "cult" (if we may call it such) of the owl pipe, of the father's head- indeed, of the whole po'or-has been driven very far underground today. In 1929, in an "anti-witchcraft" drive, government took up all the owl pipes, as well as all other emblems, which they could lay their hands on. I have seen a good many 11 The antonym in this case is not "to spoil" but "to pierce" (per) or "touch" (bend e). 12 East, Akiga's Story, pp. 227-229, 248.</page><page sequence="13">A TIV IDEA 149 specimens of both owl pipes and skulls, with two exceptions in museums. I know that po'or rites were carried on in the compound in which I was present in 1952; I got a great deal of information on these rites, but I did not see them all. I had not been initiated, and my Tiv friends-who, though they knew me well and trusted me in most matters-trust no one with a white skin with all the full knowl- edge of po'or. They were very polite, and raised the initiation fee to a point which they knew I could not pay. Enough has been said here, however, that we can see that the notion of tar, and concepts of repairing tar, lie at the basis of Tiv social process. The phrase "repairing tar" contains an ambiguity: it means government, more or less in the sense that we know it-the temporal restoration and control of human relation- ships toward the state which is conceived as a maximum good. But it also means the religious reparation of the community, and with it supernatural aid in the production of wealth, plenty, and contentment-of prosperity. To "repair the tar" is to arbitrate, and to keep the tar "cool." It is also to carry out the rites which contribute toward health and fertility. Within the notion of "repairing tar" temporal political activity, economic activity, and religious belief and ritual are a single idea. There is an aspect of law and warfare-and therefore of government -and also an aspect of cosmography and of demography and of religion. Tar is one of the basic notions which underlie Tiv organization and imaging of their own way of life. INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD OXFORD, ENGLAND</page></plain_text>
