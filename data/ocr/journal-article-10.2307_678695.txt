Karen Barbara Strier Harvard University Primate Paradigms: Sex Roles and Social Bonds is an ambitious review of sex differences in primate behavior. Though it focuses on non- human primates, Fedigan's treatment is clearly intended to provoke, if not provide, insight into human male and female behavior. In response to the male-dominated view of primate societies popularized in the 1960s and early 1970s, Fedigan presents a similarly strong counter- perspective emphasizing the central role of female primates in their social groups. Readers familiar with the literature will find some of her descriptions, especially of Hamadryas baboons (ch. 15) overly feminist; those unacquainted with these species may be misled. However, Fedigan's tendency to accentuate the impor- tance of females illustrates her own repeated warnings about the effects of personal and cultural biases on interpretations of behavioral phenomena. The 19 chapters in this volume cover a broad spectrum of primatological and sex-related topics. They are arranged into five sections, facilitating selective, subject-oriented reading without detracting from the continuity of the text. The first part introduces the primates and basic issues in primate studies related to sex dif- ferences. It also conveys Fedigan's philosophical and methodological approach. In an important chapter entitled "Words," Fedigan is justifiably wary of the connotations of "anthropomorphic labels" (p. 18) on our perceptions of primate behavior. All readers will benefit from this reminder of our inability to completely escape our own subjective viewpoints. Part I concludes with a noteworthy chapter on sexual dimor- phism. Fedigan challenges the behavioral cor- relates of sexual selection theory, calling for "more direct measures of the intensity of male- male competition" (p. 66). She suggests that closer consideration be paid to the bioenergetic and anatomical constraints operating on females and males. The second section examines in separate chapters the concepts of aggression, dominance and alliances, roles, kinship, and sociosexual behavior as they pertain to understanding behavioral sex differences. In her chapter on aggression, Fedigan cautions that intraspecific killing in primates "is rarely reported from field studies and cannot be considered the 'norm' " (p. 83), and that reports of infanticide in langurs are mostly "isolated instances and/or in- ferred cases of killing" (p. 86). Though she con- cedes that these events may have important biological impact, many readers may feel that in emphasizing their infrequency, she fails to give adequate consideration to their dramatic consequences despite her contention that preoc- cupation with such gory accounts of male ag- gression has led us to ignore more subtle forms of female aggression. Part III discusses the experimental research regarding the ontogeny of sex differences. Devoting an entire chapter to the deprivation studies by Harlow and his students may be in- dulgent in a book of this nature, but Fedigan's comments on the difficulties of conducting and interpreting results from laboratory experi- ments are valuable. Her discussion of socializa- tion (ch. 12) is well organized and thorough in its coverage of relevant topics such as play behavior, maternal care, paternal care, and peer interactions. Unfortunately, there have been a number of intriguing hypotheses about allomothering and male-infant relationships published after this volume was sent to press.</page><page sequence="2">702 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [85, 1983] Thus, the ideas presented are somewhat dated. In Section IV, Fedigan describes three species of primates in each of the major types of social systems: multimale, multifemale societies (e.g., Japanese macaques, vervets, chimpanzees); polygynous societies (e.g., geladas, patas, langurs); and monogamous societies (e.g., mar- mosets, titi monkeys, siamangs). Here, and throughout the book, Fedigan should be more careful in specifying when she draws on data from captive rather than field primate studies, particularly when contrasting equivocal results. She does furnish a highly readable account of these species that convincingly demonstrates, as do the works of a number of other primatol- ogists (e.g., Hrdy, Silk) that female primates are more than passive, subordinate members of social groups subject to the whims of their male counterparts. The final section deals with evolutionary theories of sex differences. The material Fedigan presents is fundamental, but she mis- represents some critical concepts. For example, she argues that the "assumption that a male . . . is either totally fit or unfit" (p. 277) oversimplifies the complexities of primate behavior but neglects to point out that fitness is only meaningful in a relative sense. Her discus- sion of kin selection, reciprocal altruism, and parental investment (ch. 18) reflects a contro- versial and ongoing debate about the validity of sociobiological theory. Though many readers will undoubtedly disagree with her rejection of kin selection, her reasoning is not unfounded: the assumption that "energy expenditure is a meaningful and adequate measure of cost in terms of fitness" (p. 292) is unproven, and our inability to confirm male paternity in multimale primate groups is problematic (p. 294). Never- theless, Fedigan subsequently commits a similar error in her own proposition that males as well as females have "considerable if non- comparable investments in the offspring" (p. 302) by failing to suggest a means of measuring investment. In her last chapter, Fedigan discusses three models of human behavioral evolution based on savannah baboons, gelada baboons, and chim- panzees. This chapter is highly appropriate in a volume that refers to the classical primate literature since reconstructing human evolution provided the initial impetus for many of these early studies. It is not surprising that Fedigan prefers the more female-oriented chimpanzee model which emphasizes sharing and female technological know-how. Refreshingly, Fedigan qualifies her support by noting that despite its more egalitarian implications, the chimpanzee model can provide nothing more than an ex- tended analogy for humans vulnerable to the same subjective interpretations as all others. This book does not provide a new synthesis of the behavior of female primates or sex dif- ferences in behavior. Fedigan critically points out biases in theory, methodology, and inter- pretations but offers only tentative or obvious alternatives. The careful reader will be frustrated by occasional omissions and inac- curacies in the references, but these do not detract seriously from the content of the book. Primate Paradigms does draw together a sub- stantial amount of information from experi- mental and field studies on the better-known Old World anthropoids. As such, Fedigan pro- vides a cogent and provocative overview of primate social roles in a format that will appeal to anyone with an interest in sex-related pat- terns of behavior.</page></plain_text>
