<plain_text><page sequence="1">BYRON: TROUBLED STREAM FROM A PURE SOURCE BY LESLIE BRISMAN In his 1821 Diary, Byron waives questions about origins with the studied nonchalance typical of the narrator of Don Juan: If, according to some speculations, you could prove the World many thousand years older than the Mosaic Chronology, or if you could knock up Adam and Eve and the Apple and Serpent, still what is to be put up in their stead? or how is the difficulty re- moved? Things must have had a beginning, and what matters it when or how?1 To the poet meticulous about historical accuracy, the prehistorical when did matter a great deal-if not in literal, calendar chronology, at least in terms of the mythic chronology of the passions, the prohi- bitions, the guilt. To the poet obsessed with the divorce between the tree of knowledge and the tree of life, it mattered how these emblems were represented in allusion and retellings of the myth. Perhaps most of all it mattered that questions of creation be deflected into awarenesses of the fallen world as we know it. Adam and Eve can scarcely be mentioned without a shift of interest to the apple and serpent, for the creation story remains a distant fiction while the Fall is a present truth. "With a characteristic ellipsis," writes Michael Cooke, "Byron blanks out the supposedly historical perfect world and shows the certified world going from bad to worse."2 What Byron "blanks out" remains as much a presence in his poetry as the materials of repression are presences in the psyche generally. In A Map of Misreading Harold Bloom suggests that a poet's greatest moments are related to his powers of repression, and his verse seems daemonized with special energy when presences the poet would rationally or consciously dismiss are given voice while an inner censor sleeps. Calvinist in temperament but no Christian in belief, Byron thought that an undisguised faith in a paradise was at the root of intellectual and social error. Whether out of rivalry with Shelley on the subject of evil or simply in pursuit of the satirist's antimask, Byron implies that the history of inauthentic poetry-and the prog- ress of the world at large from bad to worse-may be the responsibil- Leslie Brisman 623 ELH 42 623-650 (1975) Copyright : 1975 by The Johns Hopkins University Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.</page><page sequence="2">ity of those who have failed to forget the belief in an anterior, perfect world. No doubt he would mock the idea of deep repression as much as he did the failure to put radical innocence out of mind, for Byron makes public the gesture of assigning nostalgias about an unfallen condition their proper place. What for others are the hidden work- ings of the psychic defenses and tropes of representation are often for him the surface subject or plaything of his verse. Remarkable always is the way he gets us to discard commonplaces about the traumatic or scandalous stuff of repression and to see sexuality and fallen experi- ence as what we find acceptable to expose, while innocence and its priority need to be hidden. I Cain, Byron's most successful reworking of Genesis myth, an- nounces from its very title the deferral or temporal shift away from prelapsarian origins to fallen experience. Early on the drama also makes clear the concomitant turn on ordinary belatedness-that radical innocence, not sexuality or a Fall, is what we cover. Oblivi- ous to the loincloth of Christian theology, Cain points to what seem to him to be unaccommodated facts: The snake spoke truth: it was the tree of knowledge; It was the tree of life: knowledge is good, And life is good; and how can both be evil? (I.i.36-38) In hushing him, Eve asks Cain to content himself with what is, and let the innocence of his perspective be relegated back in history- and to the back of the mind. Bringing to the surface what Eve has repressed, the devil offers Cain knowledge, leading him to a differ- ent sort of statement than the one with which he confronted Eve: "It was a lying tree-for we know nothing" (II.ii.366). It is hard to be a devil of stature in the devil's presence, especially when Lucifer is contriving to accentuate his epigone's sense of creatureliness. The full daemonization of Cain depends on Lucifer being gone, and Cain seems closest to the spirit whose presence he disdains when, away from Hades, he insists grandly on his innocence of the Fall and shares Lucifer's revaluation of temporal and moral priorities. Byron shares them too. Before the drama proper he prefaces a note that ostensibly belittles a demonic stance: "The assertion of Lucifer, that the pre-Adamite world was also peopled by rational beings much more intelligent than man, and proportionably powerful to the 624 Troubled Stream from a Pure Source</page><page sequence="3">mammouth, etc., etc., is, of course, a poetical fiction to help him make out his case." The particularities of this preexistence may be a "poetical fiction," but the interest in upsetting the priority of the received account is for Byron a most authentic business of poetry. In the play proper Byron dismisses the primacy of the Genesis creation, and has Lucifer present visions of anterior worlds. At the same time, he images his own belatedness by centering on a fall after the inherited one, not on Adam but on Cain. References to earlier crea- tion seem designed not for the assertion of temporal priority by itself but for the pressures they place on Cain to bear~the burden of new anteriorities, and stand as the focal point on which the turn from the received to the new myth can pivot: Cain: Where dost thou lead me? Lucifer: To what was before thee! The phantasm of the world; of which thy world Is but the wreck. Cain: What! is it not then new? Lucifer: No more than life is; and that was ere thou Or I were, or the things which seem to us Greater than either. (II.i.151-56) If we read just the first two sentences of this exchange, we could entertain, with justified suspicion, the notion of a time-machine. And "the phantasm of the world" seems a Luciferic reduction to the level of clap-trap of Shelley's magnificent fiction of a shadow world in Prometheus Unbound. But contempt for such machinery is under- mined when the word "world" is replaced by the word "wreck." If past glories are not as such to be recaptured, ruins of the past can still be very much present; if other worlds are the business of romancers turned science-fiction visionaries, still the belatedness of this world has an authentic ring. Thus, while we can hardly make a significant imaginative gesture towards recapturing the purity of origins- which belong somewhere back in God's country-we can come to recognize that we stand at a significant distance from such things, and can come to see an external Hades or a dark region of the mind haunted by the phantasms of anterior creation. When Lucifer tells Cain that they are on their way to view shades of pre-Adamite beings, Cain's surprise, "What! is [the world] not then new?" presents the newness of the world balanced, as it were, on the tenuous point of the interrogative. For the moment Cain holds the world up on one questioning finger. Lucifer's casual shrug, "no Leslie Brisman 625</page><page sequence="4">more than life is," topples that world from its fragile axis. Though the action and reaction are verbal, "in the beginning was the word," and this verbal exchange seems to demand priority over what is to be seen in space. "Language is properly the medium for this play of presence and absence," writes Derrida: "Is it not within language- is it not language itself that might seem to unify life and ideality?"3 For Lucifer and for Byron language rather separates present life from preconceptions of ideality, and a particular verbal exchange consti- tutes a particular victory over both the presence or givenness of spatial reality and the possibility of past spaces and times. At this point in Byron's drama the verbal exchange precedes the sight of anterior creatures and precludes the sight of alternate worlds. Lucifer does not take Cain to other planets but passes them by: "The lights fade from me fast, / And some till now grew larger as we approach'd / And wore the look of worlds." The experience of passing by these worlds preludes the experi- ence of confronting shadows of the past, and introduces the perspec- tive from which dismissals prove more authentic than actual con- frontations with preexistants could be. Indeed, Cain finds the trip he does take no match for his anterior and superior desires. But the attitude cultivated in outer space extends to contempt for priority more generally. Lucifer tells Cain, Many things will have No end; and some, which would pretend to have Had no beginning, have had one as mean As thou. Beginnings are mean things, and sublimity is to be sought not in the dawning of days or worlds but in what Nietzsche called the twilight of the gods -in grand dismissals ofthe past. Lucifer is thus educating Cain to the indifference towards beginnings that Byron expressed in his diary entry. Or perhaps more precisely, Lucifer is abetting the process that Byron's diary witnesses by which the sense of creature- liness (of feeling what Milton's Adam felt when he first woke and knew himself made) goes underground and is covered by indiffer- ence to origins and the posturings of a fallen angel. Brought back to his own, postlapsarian world, Cain finds the price of his proclaimed freedom from the past to be a radical naturalism, knowledge of mortal nature's nothingness regardless of (or repress- ing knowledge of its Creator. When Cain's offering of fruits is scattered on the earth, he exclaims, "From earth they came, to earth 626 Troubled Stream from a Pure Source</page><page sequence="5">let them return." This is radical innocence because rooted in the earth, ignorant of the fact of human death that lies hidden in the phrase as it lies hidden in Cain's effort to cast down Abel's altar and return it too to the earth. If Abel's piety leads him to acknowledge God as spiritual source, Cain's knowledge of the earth makes him stick to his earthy vision of origins. "There may be always a time of innocence," Wallace Stevens tentatively proposes in The Auroras of Autumn, "There is never a place." Dismissing Jehovah as a bloodthirsty God who delights in sacrifice, Cain could be said to claim both "There never was a time of innocence" and "This must be the place." Insisting on the present time, the present place, he exclaims to Adah before Abel comes on the scene to make his sacrifice, "Why, we are the innocent." To make this a place innocent of sacrifice, sublimation, and all experiential orderings of the world into higher and lower, spiritual and earthy, Cain proposes leveling Abel's altar. He asks Abel to "stand back till I have strew'd this turf along / Its native soil." The intended physical deconstruction of the altar and metaphysical deconstruction of the hierarchies it acknowledges may be taken as an emblem of Byron's lifelong efforts to reduce spiritual pretensions and fictions to their "native soil." To challenge prevenient mythology, Byron needed to do more than inherit the dichotomies of good and evil, God and Satan, and choose the other side. Nor could he simply adapt the dual vision of man as both creation of God and creature of dust who to dust returns, and create a protagonist who is wholly committed to one of these Biblical statements of origins. The conflict between Cain and Abel, while it concerns two views of man's original substance, subsumes an argument between two views of what constitutes original action. For Abel and for the Bible one discovers one's originality in relation to the Originator. For Cain and for Byron one does not discover one's originality in relationship to the Author of Evil; nothing can be thought "original" till it separates itself from relationship to sources. So Byron argues about his Cain in a letter to John Murray: Cain is a proud man: if Lucifer promised him kingdom, etc., it would elate him: the object of the Demon is to depress him still further in his own estimation than he was before, by showing him infinite things and his own abasement, till he falls into the frame of mind that leads to the Catastrophe, from mere internal irritation, not premeditation, or envy of Abel (which would have made him contemptible), but from the rage and fury against the inadequacy of his state to his conceptions.... Leslie Brisman 627</page><page sequence="6">If Cain's action is to be his own, not Satan's, it must be motivated by "internal irritation," not a larger dialectical quarrel with God in which he would be a victim, and no originator. Even envy would not have been sufficiently his own, depending directly as it does on awareness of the priority of the envied. To the scene of the murder Cain brings a preexistent sense of infinite things and a preexistent sense of abasement, of dust-to-dust, both of which have been abetted by Lucifer. Impelled towards both awarenesses, he is now on his own; and if the glory seems a vision borrowed or imposed, the naturalistic dismissal of preexistent sublimity is something experi- enced as original to the self. From his flight with Lucifer Cain returns to his natural existence, his existence as natural man-a paterfamilias, as tiller of the soil, one who feels his littleness far more native to his consciousness than his memory of "'extinguish'd worlds." The glory he could call his own would come from the possibility of transcending memory, trans- cending the givenness of the past, and striking (if need be, with a death-blow) a point for the originality of the self. Writing of Proust, Gilles Deleuze voices a kind of credo for the mind unextinguished by its immersion in preexistent materials: "It is no longer a matter of saying: to create is to remember-but rather, to remember is to create, to reach that point where the associative chain breaks, leaps over the constituted individual, is transferred to the birth of an individuating world."5 Blake repeatedly finds this point; Byron re- peatedly discovers it to be an illusion. His Cain is disappointed in the possibilities of breaking the chain of the past and attending the birth of an individuating world; he is confronted instead with the natural birth of an individual-his flesh-and-blood son which Byron, in a telling revision of the Bible, has antedate the slaying of Abel. When Adah berates Cain,, "do not whisper o'er our son / Such melan- choly yearnings o'er the past," she voices the simplist demystifica- tion that would put all hankerings for romantic origins in their place. It is the kind of rebuke Byron himself makes of Cain's weak desires, and of his own moments of soft romanticism from the lingering over childhood scenes in Hours of Idleness to the moments of innocence in the Haidee episode of Don Juan. Adah continues with cheerful- ness she seems to have picked up from the end of Paradise Lost: "Why wilt thou always mourn for Paradise? / Can we not make another?" But the awareness of death intervenes and keeps Cain (to borrow Byron's own term from the letter) "depressed." This depression is not simply sadness, but the reduction of man to 628 Troubled Stream from a Pure Source</page><page sequence="7">his earthy origins and first nothingness. Tiller of the soil, father of an earthly creature who is overshadowed by cypresses and the fact of death, Cain finds that the awareness of man's grotesque lowness is the concomitant of his sublime ambition to stand original and free. "Nota," says Stevens' rejuvenated Crispin: "His soil is man's intelli- gence. / That's better. That's worth crossing seas to find." Cain has crossed vast seas of space and thought with Lucifer to find this soil the sum total of his intelligence and knowledge. In a terrible irony, even the soil is alienated from Cain when it absorbs Abel's blood; as a vagabond, Cain will be estranged from the earth he had thought most truly his own. In Genesis, Cain protests that his burden is too great and that whoever finds him will slay him. In Byron, Adah voices these objec- tions while Cain himself asks to be allowed to die. The visual brand on the forehead is thus all the more imposed, and is accompanied by a verbal brand: "Stern hast thou been and stubborn from the womb, / As the ground thou must henceforth till" (III.i.503-04). These signs of separation magically rouse Cain into authentic voice, for he speaks now with Shakespearean power and Miltonic resonance, but comes into his own: After the fall too soon was I begotten; Ere yet my mother's mind subsided from The serpent, and my sire still mourn'd for Eden. That which I am, I am; I did not seek For life, nor did I make myself; but could I With my own death redeem him from the dust And why not so? Truer than the plain fact ("I did not seek / For life") is the extraordi- nary imaginative independence that comes precisely in the di- minished idea of causality-the narrowed sense of priority that nevertheless aggrandizes the self. The opening lines of this speech are like those of Shakespeare's Edgar saving for himself what little imaginative freedom there is left after the wheels of causality have rolled to this catastrophic point: "The dark and vicious place where thee he got / Cost him his eyes." Asserting the metaphor-making power (the power of localizing a symbolic topos or a time) over the catastrophe from which the need for metaphor springs, these speeches leave the imagination triumphant yet. Byron's Cain seems to surpass Edgar in moving from slender to full-fledged self- assertion: "That which I am, I am." If the power of this seems limited by our awareness that it is borrowed from Milton's Satan (Tenny- Leslie Brisman 629</page><page sequence="8">son's Ulysses will be similarly threatened), it becomes all the more Cain's and Byron's own when compacted with a new, unsatanic- indeed, Christlike-impulse. Even if it does come from despair, the wish to redeem Abel by sacrificing himself seems to contradict everything Cain stood for in opposing Abel and the sacrifice-loving God Abel worshiped. But instead of a capitulation, these lines, so summarily dismissed by the angel, represent a final fictiveness, a last emblem of the mind's capacity to transcend its circumstances and create its own vision of things. The power given to the branded Cain is like that Byron gives his Prometheus: "Thou art a symbol and a sign / To mortals of their fate and force." Turned into signs, Cain and Prometheus have restored to them a purity of figuration which asserts both the individual origina- tion of their actions and their special connection with ultimate ori- gins. One's act is divine, one's demonic, but branded forever they share the fate of having their daemonized power abstracted from their persons and made a sign of the human condition. We do not worship, but we "read" or recognize the sign, point to it and say: Like thee, Man is in part divine, A troubled stream from a pure source; And Man in portions can forsee His own funereal destiny, His wretchedness, and his resistance, And his sad unallied existence. To which his Spirit may oppose Itself. ("Prometheus") II The idea of a "pure source" can be safeguarded from both the assaults of experience and the jibes of the worldly satirist by appear- ing to be translated from this earth to some imaginatively anterior one. In the diary entry quoted in the beginning of this essay, Byron speculates on an original innocence: "I sometimes think that Man may be the relic of some higher material being, wrecked in a former world, and degenerated in the hardships and struggle through Chaos into Conformity." The stipulation of material being guards the inno- cence of the idea of preempting the satirist's ammunition and im- agining man's faded spirit to have the form, originally, of a more fulfilled natural man. In the context of his satirical poems, Byron makes the anterior world that of sexuality which, he loves to protest 630 Troubled Stream from a Pure Source</page><page sequence="9">too much, he has long renounced. Man's "original" moments, to be recalled but not recovered, are moments of satisfied love: No more-no more-Oh! never more on me The freshness of the heart can fall like dew, Which out of all the lovely things we see Extracts emotions beautiful and new. (Don Juan, I, ccxiv) As an addition to the manuscript of Don Juan, this little nostalgia for innocence appears amid the flamboyant posturing with something of the air of Christ among his mockers. A similar tone is struck by Byron explaining his treatment of Contessa Guiccioli to the Countess of Blessington: "I am worn out in feelings; for, though only thirty-six, I feel sixty in mind, and am less capable than ever of those nameless attentions that all women, but, above all Italian women, require."6 (The man who could no more resist adding that last particularizing slur than he could resist Italians was not to be worn out.) Blessington records Byron's myth of im- aginative independence as that of an antecedent world from which the imagination, like a Son of God, emerges never to be capable of feeling quite at home with a single, belated Daughter of Man: The way in which I account for it (my boorishiness, or the "some- thing. . . in the poetical temperament that precludes happiness") is, that our imaginations being warmer than our hearts, and much more given to wander, the latter have not the power to control the former; hence, soon after our passions are gratified, imagination again takes wing, and finding the insufficiency of actual in- dulgence beyond the moment, abandons itself to wayward fan- cies, and during this abandonment becomes cold and insensible to the demands of affection.... It is as though the creatures of another sphere, not subject to the lot of mortality, formed a factiti- ous alliance (as all alliances must be that are not in all respects equal) with the creatures of this earth, and, being exempt from its sufferings, turned their thoughts to brighter regions, leaving the partners of their earthly existence to suffer alone. Depicting the imagination as a 'creature of another sphere," he grants it priority, so that turning away from a particular alliance and letting one's fancy wander back to the brighter regions becomes a matter of visionary loyalty to the mind's original place. Whether the marriage is that of man's spirit to his natural being or more literally the entanglement of a man with an actual lady, the marriage metaphor allows for both the legitimate pull into nature and the legitimized resistance to that pull on the grounds that spirit would be Leslie Brisman 631</page><page sequence="10">pulled down into unequal alliance. The concept of "factitious al- liance" provides a vehicle for the conflicting ideas of origin: spiritual preexistence and demystified naturalism. Obviously the concept Qf "factitious alliance" was attractive to Byron the man, allowing him to turn biographical facts into a kind of personal fall myth. The concept also has much to do with the struc- ture of Don Juan and the way originality is regained in the love- encounters. But let us turn, rather, to a poem whose more muted tones give the romantic alternative to naturalistic origins a better chance. The advertisement to the 1814 edition of Lara seems to play coyly with the nature of the "factitious alliance" of the hero and heroine of the poem: The reader of Lara may probably regard it as a sequel to a poem that recently appeared: whether the cast of the hero's character, the turn of his adventures, and the general outline and colouring of the story, may not encourage such a supposition, shall be left to his determination. If we follow these suppositions, Lara and Kaled are Conrad and Gulnare of The Corsair now caught in the unequal alliance of preoc- cupied man and devoted lady. What these identifications tell us about either poem is more difficult to determine. Byron seems to be toying with the concept of origin, as though seeing Lara as sequel to The Corsair answered questions about the genesis of the poem or about the mysterious preexistence of its hero. But the plot of Lara seems to be neither dependent nor significantly clarified by the story of The Corsair, and it is not immediately apparent what insight we gain into one dark hero by the suggestion that he is to be identified with another, equally mysterious character. The story of Lara may be briefly stated. After a long absence, Lara returns to his feudal seat accompanied by his faithful page Kaled. At a party sometime later, Lara is recognized by Ezzelin, who, before he can challenge Lara or reveal Lara's past identity or crimes, mysteri- ously disappears. Hostility to Lara grows, and in an all-out battle Lara is mortally wounded. He is attended in his dying moments by Kaled, whose grief reveals her identity as a woman. As Byron himself commented on the tale, "it is too little narrative, and too metaphysical to please the greater number of readers."7 The 632 Troubled Stream from a Pure Source</page><page sequence="11">"metaphysical" quality needs to be discussed, though we may dis- miss Byron's habitual protestations about his poetry being carelessly composed and insignificant. There is too little narrative in Lara for the "metaphysical" cast not to be a conscious goal, and one belies the work by seeming to discover, as critics have done, the obvious clanking of gothic machinery and the overt resort to mysterious silence. In general, Byron's fondness for mystery is almost as great as his delight in satiric demystification. The poet of DonJuan, for example, toys with the penchant for the secret, protesting that he will, rather, be perfectly open. Introducing Haidee and Zoe, he declares, "I'll tell you who they were," as if to forestall dark conceits about their nature. "Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air/ Of clap-trap which your recent poets prize" (II, cxxiv). More than an incidental laugh at his own "clap-trap," the dismissal of mystery underlies the genuine effort at the pristine. Not simply gothic trappings, but the sophisti- cated joking about trappings must be gotten out of the way if the Haidee episode is to glimpse an unsophisticated simplicity. Later in Don Juan the demystification is less gentle, and it is worth recalling the last episode of that poem to keep in mind how much of what came easiest to Byron had to be laid aside in cultivating the "metaphysi- cal" in Lara. Here is Juan reacting to sounds of the Black Friar ghost's reap- pearance: Were his eyes open?-Yes! and his mouth too. Surprise has this effect-to make one dumb, Yet leave the gate which eloquence slips through As wide as if a long speech were to come. Nigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew, Tremendous to a mortal tympanum: His eyes were open, and (as was before Stated) his mouth. What open'd next?-the door. (XVI, cxv) The listing of opened apertures prepares for the openness of the full naturalistic disclosure to come: the phantom is "her frolic Grace," the very much flesh-and-blood (though not too much flesh, indulged taste makes Byron pause to note) woman. The revelation of Fitz- Fulke is a veritable apotheosis of naturalism, defeating once and for all any pretenses to possible sublimity. What is banished for good is not simply the ghost-as-mystery, but more particularly the Black Friar ghost, the ghost that recalls a lost patrimony and, by extension, Leslie Brisman 633</page><page sequence="12">betrayed spiritual paternity. It is just those suggestions that Lara would explore, raising the metaphysical speculation of whether "some higher material being" and not simply some natural woman may lie at the origin of the story and the center of its mystery. But let me delay our return to Lara a little longer to glean from the Don Juan stanza a symbol and theme central as well to the earlier poem. Caught with his mouth open, unable to speak, Juan is comically but significantly restored to an innocence that would fit him not for the degenerate Fitz-Fulke but for the more primary beauty (whose very name suggests beginnings) Aurora. Throughout Don Juan speech is the mark of the fall, and the hero's ease at social pleasan- tries betrays his distance from "higher material being." Aurora dis- dained Juan's talk, but "approved his silence" (XIV, cvi). "The ghost at least had done him this much good / In making him as silent as a ghost" (XVI, cvii). Insofar as the ghost in this ghostly silence is man's ghost or geist, his spiritual nature, Juan finds revived in him "the love of higher things and better days," glimpsing thus the vision of preexistent sublimity that haunts Byron, though not usually his hero in Don Juan. Aurora herself seems to come from such another world, and is preserved from degeneration by the outward manifestiation of spiritual quietude: The worlds beyond this world's perplexing waste Had more of her existence, for in her There was a depth of feeling to embrace Thoughts, boundless, deep, but silent too as Space. (XV, xlviii) From her perspective we can look back at the several ladies of the epic and find them measured by their talk. Julia, who has the priority only in terms of biography or biology in Juan's life, falls into the poem's longest speech when first discovered by Alfonso. If nature is thus victorious in Canto I, the Haidee episode images a pre-natural sublimity in portraying the lady coping with the pleasing restraint of a language barrier. That edenic possibility closed, the poem moves to a parody of the speech problem when Gulbeyaz expects Juan to melt by her "merely saying, 'Christian, canst thou love?' " (V, cxvi). From the still more depraved Catherine we get no direct words. Keeping in mind the Haidee episode, where the language prob- lem is recognized and valorized, we may return to Lara, where master and page share memories of a preexistent state under the cloak of a foreign tongue. "Cloak" belies the innocence of their 634 Troubled Stream from a Pure Source</page><page sequence="13">speech, however, for the magic of the former language is that it is spoken not behind dbors but in all openness, entrancing its uncom- prehending auditors. Lara is perhaps Byron's most silent poem, and we stand in relation to it as do the retainers or antagonists of Lara when the communication with Kaled is not to be shared. What Byron says of his hero can thus comment on or forestall what others could say of Byron here: "his silence formed a theme for others' prate" (I, xvii). We cannot dismiss Lara as a simple tale overlaid with mystery, because silence is theme, story but the setting in which the central silence can be examined and admired. As the poem opens it presents in setting what I have described in theme. Lara is returned, and "the gay retainers gather round the hearth, / With tongues all loudness and with eyes all mirth." The gathering round of loud-tongued retainers is pictorially representa- ble as a centering, and it describes in social terms what Wordsworth might have called a central silence at the heart of endless agitation. The potential is all there at this point for a tale like Keats's Eve of St. Agnes, or a little later, Lamia. But Byron deliberately suppresses narrative and gives mystery its barest background. One fact seems both to call for and strangely defeat further expla- nation. Since Lara is returned, he does not descend into the poem like a Christ-figure into earth, trailing clouds of preexistent glory from the soul's home. The land to which he returns is home, and the other-worldliness has been acquired elsewhere, in a place not native to him. In a way this simple story-fact captures all that story can do to dramatize the conflicting claims of natural and supernatural origins. The father-land seems less one's own than some other land one has made one's own, for natural and spiritual paternities seldom corres- pond. The question of priority is complicated by the question of whether the father-land is a place to live or a place to die. Corres- ponding to the sense that Lara has "too little narrative," that the story is essentially over before the poem begins, would be the hero's sense of his life having really been lived elsewhere. He is now but the shadow of himself, a death-in-life figure8 or more accurately, the remains of a figure of spiritual life returned to the death that is natural life. The conflict between spiritual and natural paternities, or perhaps more accurately between the alternate voids of both failures of rela- tionship, is expressed in the second stanza's description of Lara, "Left by his sire, too young such loss to know / Lord of himself-that heritage of woe." As Byron discovered biographically and Leslie Brisman 635</page><page sequence="14">dramatized in stories of absent or hostile father figures, one is not simply left to oneself by a father's death; to take the self as one's domain one must both abandon a natural patrimony and seize or create a realm elsewhere. To discover in the self a "heritage of woe" one needs to conceive of experiential possibilities as exhausted and one's futurity burdened by belatedness. With all but the woe spent from the self-heritage, Lara returns to the patrimonial heritage, al- most knowing, perhaps, that that too will be shortly spent. In the years away was the domain of self conquered or squan- dered? One could retreat to the pun on a life "spent," and say simply that the gaining is the spending. Byron gives the two actions just a little more space than they would have in a pun, and depicts self- knowledge as the waking from self-indulgence. A manuscript read- ing, "for his feelings sought / Their refuge in intensity of thought," is corrected to read, "his feelings sought/ In that intenseness an escape from thought" (I, viii). "Escape" suggests that self-consciousness surrounds indulgence, preceding and following it, and evading questions about anteriority. In lines that follow, however, experi- ence becomes not the void between moments of heightened aware- ness, but the height from which awareness of the soul's home can spring: "The rapture of his heart had look'd on high, / And ask'd if greater dwelt beyond the sky." Does the question signify assurance and satisfaction, challenging heaven to provide greater pleasures than those enjoyed? Or does the question, disdaining all earthly achievement, point via the appetite's insatiableness to the soul's infinity? The glimmer of ambiguity provides a glimpse at the mys- tery of Lara, the dark relationship between past experience and the kind of alternate celestial worlds Lucifer and Cain passed by. The mystery is intensified (one cannot really say "explored") in the stanzas that follow. In the portrait gallery, "where his fathers frown'd," Lara's attendants heard "The sound of words less earthly than his own." What, or whose words these may be, if they be, "must not be known." To say that mystery here is serving its own purposes is to be on precisely the right track, though to say that mystery without communication is gothic clap-trap seems to me to avoid both the intention and achievement of such episodes. Parody of such moments will come soon enough in Don Juan; and exploitation of such moments requires more narrative-the kind of mystery that provides significant or misleading clues, not the deliberate paucity of detail we find here. We are given simply the suggestion of voices, "the sound of words" without the words, and the single descriptive 636 Troubled Stream from a Pure Source</page><page sequence="15">detail-always ready, in gothic literature, to turn from adjective to verb-of frowning fathers in the portrait gallery. If those portraits were to respond to Lara, would their frowns or voices be the com- munication of dead fathers to their heir, or would they be protesting the intrusion of another ghost, another voice out of the past that belongs to Lara alone and not to them? The moment is too tenuous to permit such speculation to take hold, but again a manuscript revision points to Byron's care with suggestive ambiguity. The line "sound of words less earthly than his own" was originally written, "sound of other voices than his own." The original line is closer to clap-trap, allowing suggestions of a general communication with the dead or, for possible naturalistic solution, voices of the living; the revised line properly focuses the ambiguity on communication "less earth- ly" because spoken by a spirit of the earth's past or a spirit from other realms and other skies. A similar ambiguity attends a fearful call one night when the palace occupants hear a sound that rouses them from their sleep and confronts them with preoccupied Lara's bad dream-or what may be the pre-occupied palace's ghostly Presences: 'Twas midnight-all was slumber; the lone light Dimm'd in the lamp, as loth to break the night. Hark! there be murmurs heard in Lara's hall- A sound-a voice-a shriek-a fearful call! A long, loud shriek-and silence; did they hear That frantic echo burst the sleeping ear? They heard and rose, and tremulously brave, Rush where the sound invoked their aid to save; They come with half-lit tapers in their hands, And snatch'd in startled haste unbelted brands. (I, xii) As in Coleridge's Christabel, question and answer help suggest the disparity between spiritual quest and the declarative nature of the world we know. When Lara wakes with (or is it "to"?) a shriek and fearful call, the sound of words puzzles his attendants, for the deliri- ous prince speaks in what seem to be "accents of another land" (I, xiii). Neither attendants nor readers discover what those words are, though it is not difficult to say that they have more to do with the "'sound of words less earthly" than with anything explicable in "his native tongue." At this point we are given what comes closest to being a narrative thread to seize on. Lara's words were "meant to meet an ear / That hears him not-alas, that cannot hear!" If we are Leslie Brisman 637</page><page sequence="16">tired of mystery, we can use this thread to weave the connection between Lara and The Corsair. Lara would thus have had a dream of his dead love Medora, who "cannot hear," and would be comforted by Gulnare-Kaled, who knows of Medora, can speak her language, and at least quiet the spirit of the man she cannot distract into love. To say that such are the identifications behind the "mystery" is less to resolve than to deny the mystery and its richness. If we turn back to the dream night we can discover more from the setting, the poetry that lies just outside narrative: It was the night, and Lara's glassy stream The stars are studding, each with imaged beam; So calm, the waters scarcely seem to stray, And yet they slide like happiness away; Reflecting far and fairy-like from high The immortal lights that live along the sky. (Ix) A small, but not insignificant contribution to the air of romance may be noted in the identification of the stream as "Lara's." The country too is called "Lara's" rather than by any national name, and in general the paucity of proper names or properly externalized events makes one view what story there is as belonging more to the psyche than person of Lara. The commerce between external and internal nature seems imaged in the lines about reflection. It is not that the mind, like the stream, receives images of external nature; rather, the stream for the moment seems to image a higher spiritual reality represented by the stars. Waters that "glide like happiness away" are easily enough separated from the human emotion they are said to represent. But "the immortal lights that live along the sky" are not so easily divorced from the anthropomorphic, the inspiriting humani- zation of the verb "live." The adjective "immortal" moves the de- scription into a realm of higher being, thus insulated, as it were, from assaults of self-consciousness about such projections. The river bed seems a little Eden, complete with flowers and waters "mazy like the snake." To Lara, who feels he is already fallen, such Eden vision is best left alone, for its unadulterated perfection but "mock'd such breast as his." This mockery takes the place of the ordinary mockery satiric naturalism directs at visions of "higher spirit," and at the myths of organized religion generally. Here, where any potential demystifying mockery would have to be spirit's scorn of flesh, "You scarce would start to meet a spirit there." What kind of spirit? Some daughter of God come down to mingle 638 Troubled Stream from a Pure Source</page><page sequence="17">with the sons of men? Or some ghost of a daughter of man, haunting the consciousness of Lara as fallen son of God? To rephrase, would one imagine such a spirit come from man's mythic, idyllic past, or Lara's biographical, actual past? The alternatives, for the moment, mingle. If stars in water are a visual illusion and spirits in nature a romantic fantasy, the mingling of mythic and personal past is nonetheless a real mingling. Lara is painfully reminded "of other days, / Of skies more cloudless, moons of purer blaze." By itself "other days" most properly belongs to his personal past, while the purified scene belongs to imagination's ideal or anterior world. One can neither scorn Byron's fancied "higher spiritual being" as the delusion of young love nor scorn young love as an inadequate vehi- cle for the sense of spiritual being. Scorn is preempted by this fallen spirit who remembers what he was, yet must endure the descent into nature or the nature of loss. In a stanza Byron added to the original manuscript, Lara's relation- ship to his Luciferic literary ancestry is made explicit: As if the worst had fallen which could befall, He strove a stranger in this breathing world, An erring spirit from another hurl'd; A thing of dark imaginings. (I, xvii) Taken by themselves, either the implied satanism or the naturalistic pity for lost love would seem self-indulgent. Tenuously identified, the spiritual potential of each is given a local habitation in the other. In The Corsair, Conrad is a little too good to be seen capable of grand satanic crimes. Lara taints its hero with just a suggestion of some- thing less than sweet. Aloof from others, his mind dwelling "in regions of her own," Lara is capable of fixing himself upon others' memory like a serpent round a tree. The detail may be there to prepare for Ezzelin's recall; more significantly, it keeps the sugges- tions of spirit menacing as they are attractive. Lara himself is the most menaced, victim of his own power to defy forgetfulness. The introversion of this power is dramatized in the encounter with Ezzelin, who points to Lara at Otho's party the way Keats's Apol- lonius stares down the no less serpentine Lamia. These demystifiers would clear away all but memory of the actual, historical past. Yet an incomplete exposure only mystifies further, and Ezzelin leaves Lara with the cryptic warning, "O! never canst thou cancel half her debt, / Eternity forbids thee to forget" (I, xxiii). Is the debt to Eternity or to a Leslie Brisman 639</page><page sequence="18">specific lady? The possible absence of antecedent for "her" only heightens the thematic mystery concerning antecedence and forget- ting. Though the encounter with Ezzelin is as spare of detail and information as was Lara's dream, its very silence tells us more than details of the past could. Ezzelin's questions, "how came he thence?-what doth he here?" (I, xxii) seem not to demand an ac- count of the slings and arrows of Lara's outrageous fortune, but to strip away the accidents of fortune and confront Lara's romantic origins. Robert Gleckner calls the Ezzelin encounter "a transparent device to dramatize the presentness of all the past and the inescapa- bility of one's self, one's inner world."9 Ezzelin's own mysterious disappearance, while teasing the fancy into inventing story explana- tions, arouses the imagination to confront Ezzelin as a spectre of Lara himself. Instead of asking "what did they do with Ezzelin?" we are directed to more Wordsworthian intimations: "Whither is fled the visionary gleam? / Where is it now, the glory and the dream?" Not that Ezzelin embodies glory and dream, but his presence marked the presence of the question to Lara. As voiced by the poet, the question asked the next day about Ezzelin teases us out of thoughts about visionary gleam: "But where was he, that meteor of a night, / Who menaced but to disappear with light?" (II vi). At a moment of visionary failure, Wordsworth looks around him and finds "waters on a starry night / Are beautiful and fair. . . But yet I know, where'er I go, / That there hath past away a glory from the earth." If we turn back from the night of Ezzelin's disappearance to the night of Lara's dream, we can find in the waters of the starry night reflections of glory past. Lara is a fallen star, and Ezzelin, "meteor of a night" an image of a star's fall-its fading into the light of common, naturalistic day. Inasmuch as these star references are images, they suggest that an experiential loss is being treated, under the license of romantic hyperbole, as a Lucifer fall from heaven. But in a poem so spare, where these few images are so much the light and the life of the poem, we are thrown back into the romance element with the conviction that story details, experiential losses, can only represent the starry connaissance that makes metaphoric language closer to reality than narrative plain song. While the story lasts, the relative claims of starry and earthy realities, spiritual and natural origins, must be kept in balance. The ambiguity is represented, for example, by the description of Lara leaving Otho's party with Kaled. "His only follower from those climes afar, / Where the soul glows beneath a brighter star" (I, xxv). If "climes afar" describes the ordinary terri- 640 Troubled Stream from a Pure Source</page><page sequence="19">tory of romance, the extent to which this distance is natural or super- natural depends on whether one emphasizes "beneath" or "star."' Nature-lovers flourish beneath their star, but the star represents all that transcends nature and connects man to primeval glory. Love is, the poet says in The Giaour, "A spark of that immortal fire / With angels shared" (1132-33). Only after Lara's death does the poem return to the Ezzelin night, as if to record that the stars shine still though the flesh is mortal. With the death of Lara the character, the poem can dispense also with the ordinary bounds between man and man or mind and mind that keep one literary figure an antagonist rather than a projection of another. In terms of the story, the demystification of Lara-when our hero is reduced from the ambiguous element Byron elsewhere calls "fiery dust" and is returned to dust-is followed by the demystification of Ezzelin's death. But whether we are wholly in the realm of nature now remains a further mystery. The story of Ezzelin's death is sepa- rated from the main narrative by being presented as a peasant's tale. Within that tale comes the poem's most startling detail, all the more prominent if the peasant's tale is read beside Byron's source, where the detail is not to be found.10 The Serf watches the stream into which a body has been cast: He caught a glimpse, as of a floating breast, And something glitter'd starlike on the vest; But ere he well could mark the buoyant trunk, A massy fragment smote it, and it sunk: It rose again, but indistinct to view, And left the waters of a purple hue, Then deeply disappear'd. (II, xxiv) If one wishes to see the star here merely as Ezzelin's badge of knighthood, one's desire for naturalistic reduction receives this final dousing. If one sees instead an echo of the night of Lara's dream, one finds Byron approaching, in muted tones, the kind of imaginative triumph Shelley more flamboyantly executed at the end of Adonais. Shelley's star beacons from on high, Byron's-building into the image itself its insurance against demystification-glimmers for a moment from below. If Ezzelin was a pursuing spectre to Lara, his death here shadows forth the life of the hero. The mysterious Lara returned to his father-land is the star "indistinct to view" at second and final remove from its prelapsarian state. In terms of the peasant Leslie Brisman 641</page><page sequence="20">narrative, the star sinks; in terms of romantic narrative, the star image outlasts Lara's life in nature. The mystery of Lara lies in the strange relationship between narrative and preexistent sublimity revealed at the end. If one be- lieved in the temporal priority of a prenatural state, the fall into narrative-telling the story of a man's loves and losses on earth- would be a fall into nature. In itself, the Byronic speculation about an anterior spiritual state has the same fictive status as naturalistic narrative. But a narrative true to one's sense of fall restores the spiritual sublimity that lies "behind" and thus anterior to the story. Not that romance comes first, satiric reduction next. Byron's revi- sions, whether on the scale of individual lines of Lara, the addition of the romantic stanzas at the end of Don Juan I, or the major reworking of Act III of Manfred, show that often the impulse to reduction came first and had to be purged or laid aside to allow for a possible sublimity. Within the achieved fiction, however, one can find re- stored the primariness of the higher spiritual state and the belated- ness of nature. An account of a fall contains no assurance that the prelapsarian condition will convincingly represent a higher spiritual state; neither does satire insure the anteriority of the serious. But if a narrative has earned its emblems of spirit, the degradation of those emblems can authenticate what they once were. As the poem draws to a close, the very story seems a degradation of the spiritual into the literal. It is one thing to sense that a pure adventure tale is being embroidered by sophisticated innuendoes and images, or turned into embroidery by having narrative detail cut out to leave a delicate, lace-like story-fabric. But it is something very different to sense that the literal level has itself descended from the metaphysical, and darkly reflects a purer literary origin. With the battle lost, Lara's faithful soldiers see that "One hope survives, the frontier is not far, / And thence they may escape from native war" (II, xi). To cross that border would be (or once would have been) to become border figures, and haunt the ambiguous geographical spaces that used to be more than geographic. They would "bear within them to the neighboring state / An exile's sorrows or an outlaw's hate." These burdens are theirs proleptically, for the exile's sorrows are the inner sorrows of alienation regardless of where one stands; and the outlaw's hate grew from the mind's war with nature before the war became that of Lara and Otho, or before it could become the war of outcasts and citizens. The geographic border seems a descendant of a temporal one, and reminds us of Lara's exile 642 Troubled Stream from a Pure Source</page><page sequence="21">from an original, unnative home, for which a new exile could be but a literalizing repetition. In abstract terms the significance of such a new border-crossing is figured by Foucault, who speaks of the "recession of the origin.... on the far side of experience." Speculating on the return to an earlier sense of time, Foucault can ask the rhetorical question: "And if the recession of the origin is thus posited in its greatest clarity, is it not the origin itself that is set free and travels backwards until it reaches itself again, in the dynasty of its own arcaism?"11 Picture the "far side of experience" literalized geographically; imagine the retreat of origins turned into a military retreat, and one sees Lara's forces traveling backwards across the border to the dynasty of archaic or arcadian imaginings, under the government of which the mysteries of life and the simple patterns of life peacefully coexist. But is Byron's "recession of the origin . . . posited in its greatest clarity"? Lara and his men look more closely and discover not arcadia-the mythic land of prelapsarian pastoralism-but Otho's men, who have preempted the border ground and cut off Lara's forces from retreat. Byron's poised verse matches one preemption with another, first decrying the romantic or pre-posterous perspective of Lara's men, then the realistic fact of Otho's ambush: It is resolved, they march-consenting Night Guides with her star their dim and torchless flight. Already they perceive its tranquil beam Sleep on the surface of the barrier stream; Already they descry-is yon the bank? Away! it is lined with many a hostile rank. Return or fly!-What glitters in the rear? It is Otho's banner, the pursuer's spear! Are those the shepherds' fires upon the height? Alas! they blaze too widely for the flight. (II, xii) The "star" misguides, the "already" mistakes, and those wonder- ful "shepherds' fires" come to be seen with greater clarity as fires from the enemy camp. The plaintive, gentle music of the questions and answers in this stanza forms an equivalent, in narrative voice, for the undertones in Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, the sad music of the god Hercules leaving Antony before that star falls. The effect in Byron's stanza is also more particular, for the misprision in the last two lines quoted does more to create a sense of the lost pastoral than could any Leslie Brisman 643</page><page sequence="22">extended description of shepherds in the beyond-the-border land from whence Lara came. These two lines express a further loss, the absence of the particularity in the lines that precede them. By them- selves, the last two lines would capture ordinary delusion, the defeat of expectation when an envisioned land of escape turns out to be the enemy's camp. This is what any such loss might be. The lines before, however, depend for their resonance on all that stars and streams have come to be in this poem. The expectation that reflected starlight will appear prelapsarian tumbles when the lights are more clearly described. Whether or not a prelapsarian state was a tenable myth, the loss of that topos, that expectation, is a real loss, authenticating the imputed anteriority of the preexistent spiritual state. For the mo- ment we are caught expecting stars of redemption-or at least a battle of angels in which the stars throw down their spears and become the fallen angels. But the spears are simply Otho's spears, and the war is not heavenly but corporeal. The weight of allusion is lost; simultaneously, and consequently, the anteriority of the "higher spiritual state" is assured. As far as the narrator of Lara is concerned, "the secret long and yet but half conceal'd" (II, xxi) is the sex of Kaled. By itself this revela- tion is so meager that the aura of mystery maintained throughout the poem would be no more than what the Quarterly Reviewer found the dream episode to be, "a mere useless piece of lumber."12 Is the secret any more, one must ask, when we extrapolate from the revela- tion of Kaled's sex that she is Gulnare, and that Lara-Conrad has been pining over Medora (first love of the hero of The Corsair)? By itself the turn from one set of literary facts to another avails naught. Yet the very inadequacy of such information proves instructive, and leads to the recognition that specific identity of Kaled, like the sex of Kaled and sexuality in general, are not the secrets of poetry but the cover for the mysteries of love, of innocence, and of the priority of spiritual life. Byron's admission that the secret of Kaled's sex has been but half-concealed all along makes public the kind of half-concealment characteristic of the workings of repression. In a sense Kaled's devo- tion to Lara is founded on forgetfulness of Lara's preoccupation with Medora, and Kaled's mystification figures that of the reader. Yet as revelation, the baring of Kaled's breast is as poor a thing as would be the baring of plain facts of past experience to one undergoing psychoanalysis. To represent the fact that nothing has really been revealed, Kaled is seen ever silent while all around demand facts: 644 Troubled Stream from a Pure Source</page><page sequence="23">"Vain was all question ask'd her of the past, / And vain e'en menace-silent to the last." What she has to reveal is love, and that has just come out, though it has been but half concealed all along. What she has to conceal is the transcendent rather than purely sexual nature of love, and that is something no physical unveiling could destroy. The preexistence of this bond between Lara and Kaled preempts the status of organized religion's bond between God and man. Dismissing the special sanction of churches, Byron presents Lara resting as much at peace as man could be: "Nor is his mortal slumber less profound, / Though priest nor bless'd, nor marble deck'd the mound." Yet these lines mystify as much as they demys- tify, for while denying special status to church or fame, they grant special status to the emotions of Kaled, which add to the burial of Lara a special grace. The literary kinship between The Corsair and Lara confirmed at this moment also encourages the renewed mystification. We are drawn not to the sexual facts that bind the stories but to the fact of love which, transcending the single poem, seems to transcend natural life as well and image a source purely "literary" and there- fore purely spiritual. The one-sidedness of love-Kaled-Gulnare loves Lara-Conrad who loves Medora-keeps the line of transcen- dence looking pure, and while ostensibly confronting the fact that Lara is really the old disappointed lover of The Corsair, we re- member also that Conrad was as much a fallen angel there as Lara is in this poem. "The relic of some higher material being," Byron specified, "wrecked in a former world." One could say that the very entrenchment of the myth of preexistence inmnature authenticates it. More accurately, the entrenchment is not in nature but in a previous poem. If Conrad is not Lara but Lara's literary precursor, then the reference Lara makes to a preexistent state is both natural (equal fictions represent states on the same plane) and supernatural (the reference to another fictional framework represents the movement outside nature). The preexistence is real, while the knowledge that this realm is but another fiction safeguards such poetry from further demystification. Iv Granted Byron's enormous skepticism of any romantic assertion, some solution like that discovered in Lara is necessary to safeguard the authenticity of the representation of a higher spiritual state. Unless the poet were to undertake a more strenuous career of poetic Leslie Brisman 645</page><page sequence="24">re-making-as does Wordsworth, for example, in The Prelude-the technical solution found in the relationship of Lara to The Corsair is a device available only once. What are other possibilities? Perhaps closest to the play between fictions in the Tales is the play with the reader's knowledge within a given fiction. Byron's dramas, in particular, catch the reader in his tendency to draw premature conclusions. When the false prematurity is exposed, one is embar- rassed or persuaded into accepting some other figure or story as prelapsarian. Werner; or The Inheritance, in which degeneration is literalized (the son is more a demon than the father) may be a successful melodramatic representation of achieved anteriority. Act III, Scene iii takes place in a "secret passage" between Werner and Stralenheim's chambers, as though spatially representing the mys- terious and morally dubious paths between the generations. We are tempted into believing that Gabor's soliloquy precedes the murder of Stralenheim. When we discover later that the murder has already been committed, that the scene of anticipation is in fact belated, the degradation of our sense of time and judgment makes us more will- ing, in turn, to accept glimpses of fallen angel in Gabor and Werner. Though the terms are those ofimelodrama, the internal argument is that of, for example, Wordsworth in Prelude VI, confronting the fact that he has crossed the Alps before he was aware of it and finding, retrospectively, an unfathered vapor of imagination. Perhaps Werner remains, ultimately, the story of a too clearly fathered heritage of woe: but perhaps the very blatancy of the family romance leaves some room for intimations of spirit redeemed from the general curse. More thematic and less technical solutions to the problem of representing the anteriority of a higher spiritual state may be discov- ered in Byron's stories of individual or governmental tyranny. If the present state of oppression can be seen as having degenerated from a purer form of nature, then our sense that demystification would parallel or participate in the degeneration helps forestall demystifi- cation. In the song at Haidee's banquet in Don Juan III, the hypothesized poet sung-or would have sung-of past glory and past song, bemoaning how the lyre "degenerated" into hands like his. "The voices of the dead / Sound like a distant torrent fall," more a part of nature, and for the moment more real, than the artificial aestheticism of the banquet or the lighthearted attitude of the poet of the surrounding stanzas. Having stood for the moment with Lambro discovering what has happened to his island home, we extrapolate on the basis of the degeneration of this paradise from our first view of 646 Troubled Stream from a Pure Source</page><page sequence="25">it to the larger sense of paradise lost in the degeneration of historical Greece. In The Two Foscari, Marina exclaims that "this crowd of palaces and prisons is not / A paradise" (III.i.147-48), a remark that poses only the pristine of understatement against the weight of Venetian corruption and unhappiness. Less lady-like is the Doge's myth of preexistence: "Methinks we must have sinn'd in some old world / And this is hell" (I.i.364-65). Byron's grandest adaptation of imputed anteriority based on a sense of present fallenness is Manfred. In other dramas and the tales the myth of preexistence is generally safeguarded by being grounded thoroughly in nature, so that to the skeptical eye there are only two geographies, or two historical periods, or at most, two poetic fictions. In Manfred the concept of an anterior spiritual state is further guarded by the distinction drawn between Manfred's spirit and the world of other spirits, whose authenticity is ultimately de- nied when their power over Manfred is denied. The kind of am- biguity about spiritual or biographical past, so necessary in Lara, is still there: Manfred's longed-for lady is Astarte, her very name suggesting an other-wordly attraction as much as a flesh-and-blood lure. Ultimately the drama distinguishes between Manfred's quest for spiritual originality and the questionable primariness of the supernatural personae. In his first approach to the "mysterious agency" of spirits, Manfred conjures unsuccessfully with "written charm" and magical signs. Denying the primal quality of this writing scene, the spirits respond rather to a spell "which had its birthplace in a star condemn'd / The burning wreck of a demolish'd world" (I.i.44-45). The song of the Seventh Spirit would imply that this is Manfred's star, though he seems both to operate under its influence and to operate its influ- ence. The question of whether the power to raise spirits is Manfred's own or is but lent him, as the Seventh Spirit claims, "but to make thee mine," is one of a number of questions about the past which need to be demystified rather than simply answered. Another such question concerns forgetfulness "of what-of whom-and why?" as the First is to answer the question-perhaps a necessary stage in the demystification, and one Byron relegates, not without tact, to the confrontation with the Witch of the Alps in Act II. Beyond answers, however, the whole concept of forgetfulness needs to be exposed and perhaps discarded. Byron was all too fond of the stance urbanely versified in the 1805 poems "'To Caroline": "Nor let thy mind past joys review-Our only Leslie Brisman 647</page><page sequence="26">hope is to forget." The passion for forgetfulness marks the turn to more postured romanticism in the opening of Canto III of Childe Harold. Perhaps poems like Lara sophisticate the efforts to suppress the past or escape victimization by it. Biographically, the call for forgetfulness seems more self-indulgent. Memory had no pleasure for him, he was fond of confessing, and he expressed the wish "for insanity-anything-to quell memory, the never-dying worm that feeds on the heart, and only calls up the past to make the present more insupportable."'13 It would be too easy to walk away from Manfred as from a portrait of man under the weight of his personal burden of the past. Nor can we simply say that forgetfulness is dismissed in the drama. Perhaps the desire for forgetfulness is purged, but only when it is demystified, or shown to be a misdirec- tion, or misapprehension of the object of desire. Already in Act I Manfred discovers the powerlessness of super- natural agency in his search for oblivion. "I lean no more on super- human aid, / It hath no power upon the past" (I.ii.4-5). At this point the path of the superhuman and the path to power over the past divaricate. Manfred does not immediately pursue either of these paths, however. He turns instead, whether by conscious redirection or the accidents of external nature, to the scene around him, and discovers the beauty of nature. "Why are ye beautiful?" is another misleading question, however, and it takes suicidal thoughts to con- front him with the importance of nature: its primariness. Part sub- lime, part pastoral, the scene is through both attributes primordial, in touch with the sources of power because in touch with the past in a way that has nothing to do with personal memory. "Here," Manfred notes parenthetically, "'the patriarchal days are not/ A pastoral fable" (I.ii.310-1 1). If it would be too radical a dismissal to say that incest is not Manfred's crime, we could at least say that incest only makes literal a perverted relation to paternity and the past. The scene in the Jungfrau mountains less indulges than purges Byron's tendency to bemoan the burden of experience, and self-dramatization as fallen angel is aborted when Manfred is rescued by the Chamois Hunter. The literalized, dramatic height of the Alps permits the momentary fiction that a suicidal plunge would be a Luciferic fall. This fiction confronts us with a greater truth, that Manfred literally unfallen cannot so melodramatically impute to himself the state of fallen angel. Literally unfallen man is also spiritually unfallen in some sense not yet fully recognized by the abortive suicide, but implied in 648 Troubled Stream from a Pure Source</page><page sequence="27">the grand injunction of the hunter: "Stain not our pure vales with thy guilty blood!" (I.ii.372). Not acquiescing to Manfred's self- abnegation, the hunter calls Manfred's blood "guilty" only prolepti- cally. The blood would be guilty of staining the vales which are yet pure. Just as the vales retain the stamp of the primeval, Manfred himself retains a contact with the unfallen element of human nature. "Power upon the past" was a misapprehended object of desire, and questing for it is like the child's questioning of whether God could build a mountain he would be unable to move. I compare a quest to a question not for verbal play but to suggest that this is the kind of play Manfred himself is engaged in. When the Witch of the Alps retires, Manfred claims he has one resource left: "I can call the dead / And ask them what it is we dread to be" (I.ii.271-72). Has he himself confused his quest with a question? He needs to learn that the object of his own quest is not power over the past or future; the real desire is to be able to approach, in the future, the power of the past. The mountain scene was a first contact with the primeval; the colloquy with the spirits in Act II is the second. When the phantom of Astarte answers Manfred-and she answers only him-she gives not the information Manfred requests, but knowledge nonetheless that he will translate into power. Questions of forgiving or forgetting were misdirected questions, betraying- regardless of their answer-a subjugation to the past. With the in- formation given by Astarte, that he will die the next day, Manfred is forced to analyze or deconstruct into its components the desire to redeem his relationship with Astarte: on the one hand, guilt at violating another can be erased only by passive resignation to the will of another; "forgive me!" is something only the you can do for the me. On the other hand, the desire to be forgiven or to forget is the desire to restore the primariness of his own will, the desire to feel his "&lt;original" power unburdened by the past. The component of resig- nation baffled, Manfred asserts the full power of original will. The mystification dispelled by the act of will involves the relation- ship between the past and the supernatural. In a confusion about primariness and power, the supernatural personae had been ap- pealed to; but if they could not dispel the past, Manfred learns that he can dispel them. His was the spell that conjured them, and his is the power to deny their primacy. One's past belongs to one's self, not to any other powers, and demons are de-mans, spirits who come from man and not parental figures who bequeath power to students of the past. Manfred identifies his present power with his skill Leslie Brisman 649</page><page sequence="28">In knowledge of our fathers when the earth Saw men and spirits walking side by side And gave ye no supremacy. (III.iv.377-79) In this vision of primordial times man is not degenerated from the spirits but an equal with them. Thus dispelling Byron's myth of degeneration, Manfred restores the primariness of his will and lifts the burden of the past. When the "original,," in the sense of what took place originally, is distinguished from the "original," in the sense of manifested originality, the original moment is no longer in the lost then but in the present now. Making an end of the demons, Man- fred stands like God in the primary act of imagination asserting "I am" and silencing the deep. The mind becomes "its own origin of ill and end."
