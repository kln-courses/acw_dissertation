First, ecosystems and the services they provide are of central im- portance to human and other existence; yet, second, environmental governance has traditionally given short shrift to the protection of such ecosystems and services. Thus, protection of ecosystems and the services they provide is a significant environmental priority that has not engendered a meaningful or effective regulatory re- sponse. The importance of ecosystems and the services they provide does not seem to be in dispute. A burgeoning literature explains that ecosystems provide conditions and processes that are neces- sary to sustain human life.4 These processes include purifying the air we breathe and the water we drink, recycling waste, replenish- ing soil nutrients, maintaining biodiversity, regulating climate, flood and pest control, and pollination.5 Jim Salzman points out in a recent article that, for example, "[o]ne cannot begin to under- stand flood control . . . without realizing the impact that wide- spread wetland destruction has had on the ecosystem service of water retention . . . ."6 This example is particularly salient in light of the enormous damage that Hurricane Katrina wrought. Several studies have suggested that past destruction of wetlands contrib- uted significantly to the devastation from Hurricane Katrina be- cause the loss of these wetlands reduced the capacity of the natu- ral environment to retain the water unleashed during the storm.7 Other examples abound of the services that different types of eco- 3.

Stavins ed., 4th ed. 2000) (noting that "negative externalities]," such as pollution, may produce a total social cost of production that exceeds the value to consumers, so that regulation is appropriate because, "[i]f the market is left to itself, too many pollu- tion-generating products are made."). R. David Simpson highlights the need to consider the value of ecosystem services in formulating regulatory strategies in Economic Analysis and Ecosystems: Some Concepts and Issues, in ECONOMICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT; SELECTED READINGS 529, 536-37 (suggesting that "[governments must act to correct 'externalities.' . . . . Pollution is the 'classical example' of [a negative externality.] . . . [W]e need to think about the value of ecosystems and environmental amenities in order to make reasonable social decisions concerning their conservation. The fact that many of the things we care about are not traded in the existing economic system makes it more, rather than less, im- portant that we think carefully about what their values really are."). 11.

My main purpose in this article is to make the general point that enforcement has promise as a mechanism for protecting ecosystem services, and to explore the different types of enforcement relief that may be especially valuable. To some degree, I conflate the con- cepts of protecting ecosystem functions and maintaining or protecting ecosystem services in order to facilitate my making this broader point. While the two are, of course, related, there are important distinctions as well. Enforcement intended to protect the environment may be structured to protect ecosystem services, or not. For example, as Professor Ruhl points out in his wetlands piece, wetland banking might be neutral with respect to ecological functions in a watershed but, because it moves wetlands, have negative effects on the distribution and absolute total of ecosystem services within the watershed. See Ruhl &amp; Gregg, supra note 11. Thus, if, for instance, a violator destroys or degrades wetlands in one location (place A), and the government, through an enforcement action, enjoins the violator to restore wetlands in a different location (place B), that injunctive relief might make the environment whole in the sense that it would address any aggregate ecological impacts, but that relief might not re- store service values to the human population around place A. This distinction between eco- system functions and services has implications for the type of relief that is appropriate if the goal is to redress harm to ecosystem services (in addition to redressing harm to ecosystem functions). Those interested in pursuing relief that advances ecosystem services in particu- lar would be well-advised to keep this distinction in mind, particularly to the degree that a purpose of such relief is to redress the harm to ecosystem services that a violation causes. One option is to require relief that would, in some way, offset the loss of the lost or reduced ecosystem services. 15. See generally, A.

Markell, Deterrence-Based Enforcement, supra note 3, at 10-12. 17. There are questions concerning optimal levels of compliance, and optimal levels of environmental protection. See, e.g., Daniel A. Färber, Taking Slippage Seriously: Noncom- pliance and Creative Compliance in Environmental Law, 23 Harv. Envtl. L. Rev. 297 (1999); Polinsky &amp; Shavell, supra note 15, at 72 (concluding that "it . . . appears that these [present] levels [of deterrence] are often too low.... [S]ociety probably should raise levels of deterrence in many areas of enforcement.") I do not address these issues here. Compliance with norms is a significant issue at all levels of governance. See, e.g., Jutta Brunnée, Multi- lateral Environmental Agreements and the Compliance Continuum, in MULTILEVEL GOV- ERNANCE of Global Environmental Change: Perspectives from Science, Sociology AND THE LAW 387, 387 (Gerd Winter ed., 2006) (noting that "[t]he promotion of compliance with international environmental commitments is among the most challenging issues of global environmental governance.").</page><page sequence="5">Spring, 2007] THINKING INSIDE THE BOX 553 ronment, including protection of ecosystems and the services they provide. I focus on the possible value that each of three "tools" in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) enforcement tool box - 1) penalties, 2) injunctive relief, and 3) a form of "beyond com- pliance" injunctive relief, known as SEPs -- has for producing eco- system benefits.18 Theoretically, there are at least five ways in which enforcement has the potential to protect the environment, including ecosystems and the services they provide. First, en- forcement has the potential to prevent harm to ecosystems by de- terring violations that would cause such harm. Second, enforce- ment has the capacity to require violators to cease violations that are causing or threatening harm. Third, enforcement includes the authority to require violators to fix ecosystems they have harmed (to restore or remediate harmed ecosystems). Fourth, EPA has used enforcement to negotiate settlements that commit violators to take action to benefit the environment in circumstances in which EPA otherwise lacks the legal authority to compel performance of such projects or to undertake them itself (to achieve protection "be- yond compliance'). Finally, enforcement has the capacity to ad- vance learning that will help to protect ecosystems and the ser- vices they provide.19 The three enforcement tools I discuss in this Article appear to have the potential to protect ecosystems in several ways. For ex- ample, EPA's power to penalize violators enables the agency to de- 18. For a summary of different regulatory tools and approaches, see for example, U.S. Congress, Office of Tech. Assessment, Environmental Policy Tools: A User's Guide OTA-ENV-634 (U.S. Gov't Printing Office, 1995). 19. For a recent assessment of key data needs, see for example, THE H. JOHN HEINZ III Center for Science, Economics and the Environment, Filling the Gaps: Priority Data Needs and Key Management Challenges for National Reporting on Ecosystem CONDITION 27 (2006), available at http://www.heinzctr.org/Programs/Reporting/Working% 20Groups/Data%20Gaps/Gaps_LongReport_LoRes.pdf (identifying ten key information gaps that "prevent effective reporting on . . . the condition and use of U.S. ecosystems" and thus limit our capacity for informed decision making.) A 2002 Heinz Center Report previously found that nearly half of the 103 "ecosystem indicators" that "described ecological conditions in the nation's coasts and oceans, farmlands, forests, fresh waters, grasslands and shrub- lands, and urban and suburban areas" could not be reported on because of data gaps and other deficiencies.

There is also much to learn in terms of valuing ecosystems and their services. See, e.g., Jason F. Shogren, A Politi- cal Economy in an Ecological Web, in ECONOMICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT: SELECTED READ- INGS, supra note 10, at 646, 656 (noting "that while nonuse values may be a valid concept, the measurement tool is still blunt."); Simpson, supra note 10, at 540 ("economists cannot make any very precise statements about the values of most ecological goods and services. . . . It will be a long time . . . before we can make as strong statements about the value of eco- logical goods and services as we can about, say, the value of a potato or a haircut.").</page><page sequence="6">554 JOURNAL OF LAND USE [Vol. 22.2 ter violations, particularly to deter regulated parties from violating the law in ways that harm the environment (including ecosystems and the services they provide).20 EPA claims the injunctive au- thority as part of its enforcement arsenal to require regulated par- ties to end violations that are causing such harm and to repair any harm their violations have caused.21 In addition, for over two dec- ades EPA has used its enforcement authorities to negotiate set- tlements of enforcement cases that commit violators to take steps to protect and restore the environment that go "beyond compli- ance," that is, beyond their obligations under the law.22 Each of these enforcement tools has the potential to advance learning that is likely to be helpful in protecting ecosystems and their services. Further, the latter two tools empower EPA to shift the burden of doing much of this ecosystem-beneficial work to the regulated community.23 This feature is likely to be of particular appeal, es- pecially during times characterized by scarce government re- sources and limited government capacity (i.e., all times). Enforce- ment offers an opportunity for environmental progress and new learning that, quite simply, is not likely to occur if it were depend- ent entirely on government resources and initiatives. Part II of this Article provides an overview of regulatory en- forcement that offers a framework for considering the possible util- ity of enforcement in protecting ecosystems and their services. Parts III-V review in more detail the three types of relief listed above, notably penalties (Part III), injunctive relief (Part IV), and "beyond compliance" actions that EPA commits regulated parties to complete through negotiated settlements of enforcement pro- ceedings (Part V).24 I also include a brief conclusion. 20.

Some economists would look at the efficiency of such expenditures regardless of the party bearing them. 24. While my effort in this article is to focus on current key elements of EPA's en- forcement tool box, there obviously are an enormous range of possible mechanisms and ap- proaches that may be helpful in protecting ecosystems and the services they provide. As indicated in the text, this article focuses on the relatively incremental approach of revamp- ing existing regulatory enforcement approaches as a possible strategy to increase protection (including enhancement and restoration) of ecosystems that provide important services; it does not consider fundamental restructuring of our regulatory apparatus as a way to achieve this goal.</page><page sequence="7">Spring, 2007] THINKING INSIDE THE BOX 555 II. An Overview of EPA Regulatory Enforcement25 A. The Level and Nature of EPA Enforcement Activity EPA's enforcement world is a busy one. Agency officials under- take a significant number of inspections each year in order to monitor compliance with the various environmental regulatory statutes. In FY 2005, for example, EPA staff conducted 22,000 in- spections and investigations.26 Through a variety of means, in- cluding government inspections, self-reporting by regulated par- ties, and tips that workers and members of the public provide, Agency staff annually discover significant numbers of violations, including a substantial number that are serious enough to warrant formal enforcement. To use the statistics from EPA's most recent fiscal year again, in FY 2005 EPA issued a total of 2,229 adminis- trative penalty complaints and initiated 259 civil judicial referrals (generally, referrals to the Department of Justice of cases involv- ing violations of environmental laws for filing of civil complaints in federal court).27 In FY 2005, EPA finalized a total of 2,273 admin- 25. This article focuses on traditional enforcement situations, in which a regulated party violates the law and the government decides to undertake a formal enforcement ac- tion against the party in order to obtain an adequate penalty and, potentially, appropriate injunctive relief. The government uses a wide variety of compliance promotion tools beyond traditional enforcement. See, e.g., U.S. Envtl PROT. AGENCY, FY 2005 PERFORMANCE AND Accountability Report, Goal 5-1 (Nov. 2005), available at http://www.epa.gov/cfo/ fin- statement/2005par/par05.pdf [hereinafter EPA FT 2005 Report]; Markell, Deterrence-Based Enforcement, supra note 3, at 8; RECHTSCHAFFEN &amp; MARKELL, supra note 20, at 60-83. While these are worth considering for their possible relevance to ecosystem services, they are not the focus of this Article. 26. EPA FY 2005 REPORT, GOAL 5, supra note 25, at 160; see U.S. ENVTL.

In many states, for one or more of the major pollution control regulatory programs, state officials have primary im- plementation responsibility. David L. Markell, "Slack" in the Administrative State and its Implications for Governance : The Issue of Accountability, 84 OR. L. REV. 1, 20-21 (2005) [hereinafter Markell, Slack]. This includes conducting inspections, reviewing facility- generated reports, identifying instances of significant non-compliance for possible follow-up action, and undertaking such action in appropriate circumstances, either through adminis- trative or judicial enforcement. See, e.g., ENVTL. COUNCIL OF STATES &amp; U.S. ENVTL. PROT. Agency, One Stop Reporting Program, Environmental Pollutant Reporting Data in EPA's National Systems: Data Collection by State Agencies l (1999) (suggesting that states conduct approximately ninety percent of all inspections and initiate more than eighty percent of all enforcement actions each year). The ideas explored in this Article are poten- tially relevant to state enforcement efforts as well. Furthermore, some of the regulatory statutes require regulated parties to monitor their own compliance and to report the results to the government. The Clean Water Act discharge monitoring report (DMR) program is probably the best example of this approach. 27. Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, U.S. Evntl. Prot.

In- creasingly, EPA has sought to monitor and measure the environ- mental impacts (benefits) of its enforcement actions. According to an EPA FY 2005 report, "28.8 percent of enforcement actions re- quired that pollutants be reduced, treated, or eliminated and popu- lations and ecosystems be protected."31 In the following section I review the nature and mechanics of contemporary enforcement in order to explore in some detail the opportunities that this significant level of government activity po- tentially affords for protection of ecosystem services. B. An Overview of Traditional Enforcement32 The enforcement process, considered broadly, includes several steps. Key elements include: 1) monitoring regulated parties' per- formance of their legal obligations; 2) identification of violators; 3) prioritization of violations (deciding which violations to pursue and which to give low priority); 4) choice of an enforcement or compli- ance-promotion approach in particular cases;33 5) pursuit of the selected approach in cases for which the Agency decides action is warranted; and 6) post-action follow-up (e.g., to assess whether a violator has returned to compliance).34 ofyear/eoy2005/2005resultscharts.pdf; NUMBERS AT A GLANCE, supra note 26. 28.

As is the case with many lists, this one creates somewhat artificial categories.</page><page sequence="9">Spring, 2007] THINKING INSIDE THE BOX 557 EPA does not pursue a formal enforcement action in the vast majority of situations in which it uncovers violations.35 As might be expected, EPA's policy is to reserve initiation of formal enforce- ment proceedings for the most serious violations. Many of EPA's programs characterize these violators as being in "significant non- compliance," or SNC.36 The criteria EPA uses to determine the types of violations that are significant and that warrant formal enforcement action have been the subject of considerable debate over the years.37 Each of EPA's major regulatory programs has developed specific defini- tions of "significant noncompliance."38 In some cases the program offices have revisited these definitions periodically.39 But, as might be expected, a constant is that a key factor or criterion has been the extent to which a violation has caused or threatened sig- nificant harm to human health or the environment.40 EPA often considers seeking a variety of types of relief for vio- lations for which the Agency determines formal enforcement action is warranted. EPA typically will seek to require such violators to It is possible (and reasonable) to categorize the enforcement process in different ways. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, Principles of Environmental Enforcement, 1-5 (Feb. 1992). Many of these elements include several components. Monitoring, for example, requires deciding which sources to monitor (priority-setting, etc.), determining the nature of the monitoring effort (the development of monitoring protocols and the like and deciding the appropriate level of monitoring for different situations), and scheduling and performance of inspections and other monitoring activities. 35.

I fo- cus on one such form of relief in this article, notably environmen- tally beneficial projects that violators agree to undertake, even though they do not have a legal obligation to do so. These are ne- gotiated projects incorporated into formal settlements used to re- solve enforcement actions without litigation (or to conclude litiga- tion). As part of such settlements, EPA generally reduces a viola- tor's payable penalty as the quid pro quo for the violator's com- mitment to perform such "beyond compliance" work. EPA labels these actions Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs).45 The following data, from EPA's report for the most recent fed- eral Fiscal Year (2005), entitled FY 2005 Compliance &amp; Enforce- ment Annual Results, shows the dollar value for each of the past five years of each of these types of relief - penalties, injunctive relief, and SEPs.

Under most regulatory statutes EPA has the authority to bring an enforcement action administratively or judicially. See e.g., CWA § 309(b), (d); CAA § 113(b); RCRA § 3008(a), (g) (all authorizing civil actions); CWA § 309(g); CAA § 113(d) (authorizing administrative enforcement penalties for viola- tions) 43.

I turn now to a more detailed look at each of these forms of traditional enforcement relief in order to explore this issue. III. A More Detailed Look at Penalty Calculations This section contains an elaboration on five points that I think are worth making in considering the promise of penalties for pro- tecting ecosystems and their services. First, penalties give EPA leverage to deter violators from committing violations that will harm or threaten to harm such ecosystems and their services.48 Related, Congress has periodically ramped up penalty levels to en- sure EPA's legal authorities are adequate to give it substantial penalty leverage to promote deterrence.49 Second, Congress and EPA have embraced an "economic benefit plus gravity" framework for determining appropriate penalties in particular cases; penalties are to be sufficient to "disgorge economic benefit" (that is, to re- quire a violator to pay an amount at least equal to the economic benefit it gained through its violation), and also are to include a "gravity" component that is tailored to the seriousness of the viola- tion and puts the violator in worse position financially than if it had complied with its legal obligations.50 Third, there is theoreti- cal support for EPA's paying attention to harm in calculating pen- alties, in addition to considering economic benefit.51 Fourth, there is reason to believe that EPA may not be fully exploiting the lever- age its penalty authorities provide it to promote deterrence be- cause of the relatively little attention the Agency traditionally has given in determining penalties to the harm (especially harm to ecosystem services) that violations cause or threaten.52 Finally, there appears to be at least some practical capacity for EPA to do better - that is, to increase the attention it gives to harm (includ- ing harm to ecosystem services) in calculating penalties.53 In short, my premise is that, while 1) EPA's legal penalty au- thorities give it the ability to deter violations, including violations that harm ecosystems and the services they provide, through im- 48. Markell, Deterrence-Based Enforcement, supra note 3, at 40. I am not suggesting that EPA is obligated to determine that any particular level of harm occurred when deciding to pursue an enforcement case or determining to impose a penalty. Instead, EPA's legal authorities generally impose strict liability and do not require EPA to establish that a viola- tion caused or threatened harm as a predicate for suit. 49.

In the remaining portion of this section, I work through these four issues, pointing out the significant empirical and other questions that need to be addressed in testing the accuracy of this premise. A. EPA's Authority to Impose Penalties to Deter Significant Violations EPA's authority to impose penalties gives the Agency signifi- cant leverage to create general and specific deterrence in order to reduce the number and significance of violations of the environ- mental laws. Under many of the significant regulatory statutes, EPA can impose substantial penalties - up to $32,500 per day, per violation.54 As a result, the maximum statutory penalty for a set of violations can be quite high. For example, if a regulated party violates a law such as the Clean Water Act for thirty days, the total maximum penalty is $975,000 (thirty x $32,500). If the regulated party has committed three different violations of the Clean Water Act for a month, the total maximum potential penalty increases to $2,925,000 ($975,000 x three). For cases that involve multiple violations that continue for an extended period of time, in short, the violator is potentially subject to significant penalties, which easily extend into the multi-million dollar range.55 EPA enforcement policies make it clear that, as noted above, the EPA staff are to consider three key factors in determining ap- 54. Congress has increased the maximum penalties significantly over the years for violations of major environmental regulatory statutes such as the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and RCRA. For example, the CWA provided for penalties not to exceed $10,000 per day of violation until Congress increased this maximum civil penalty amount to $25,000 per day in the 1987 Amendments. Water Quality Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-4, Title V, §313, 101 Stat. 45 (Feb. 4, 1987) (codified at 33 U.S.C. § 1319). Because Congress provided for penalties to keep pace with inflation, the current statutory maximum is $32,500. Adjust- ment of Civil and Monetary Penalties for Inflation, 40 C.F.R. 819.4 (2007). 55. A January 2007 search of EPA's Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) database found that, in 2006, EPA settled 24 cases in which it assessed penalties of $500,000 or more. Four of those were administrative cases, the rest judicial. See http://www.epa.gov/echo/index.html. See e.g., Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc. v. Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd., 791 F.2d 304, 313-14 (4th Cir. 1986) (holding that a violation of a monthly average parameter constitutes a violation of each day of the month); cf. U.S. v.

First, the staff are to consider the eco- nomic benefit the regulated party gained through its violations. Second, the staff are to consider the gravity or seriousness of the violations. Finally, staff consider "adjustment" factors, such as ability to pay.56 EPA has made considerable progress in making the calculation of economic benefit more routine, systematic, and consistent. It has developed an interactive computer model known as BEN to facilitate calculation of economic benefit.57 BEN is intended to be a user-friendly tool that "yields a reliable, objective dollar figure" that represents the economic benefit a violator gained through its violations.58 The Science Advisory Board (SAB) has concluded, and EPA enforcement officials have acknowledged, that the Agency de- votes the majority of its penalty calculation efforts to determining the economic benefit associated with particular violations.59 The SAB has characterized recapturing economic benefit that accrues from noncompliance as "the cornerstone" of EPA's objective of us- ing penalties to deter violators.60 It is clear that Congress intended that EPA consider the seri- ousness or gravity of a violation in determining an appropriate penalty. Most of the major statutes direct EPA to do so. Section 309(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) (covering civil penalties), for example, provides that: "In determining the amount of a civil pen- alty the court shall consider the seriousness of the violation "61 Similarly, CWA section 309(g)(3) (covering administrative penal- ties) provides that: "In determining the amount of any penalty . . . 56.

It also is clear that EPA has taken several steps to "operation- alize" this Congressional direction to consider the significance of violations, including the harm the violations cause, in determining penalties. The Agency has developed general enforcement guid- ance that adheres to this statutory direction. EPA's 1984 over- arching enforcement directive, entitled A Framework for Statute- Specific Approaches to Penalty Assessments: Implementing EPA's Policy on Civil Penalties A68 directs each EPA media program (wa- ter, air, etc.) to "develop a system for quantifying the gravity of vio- lations of the laws and regulations it administers."69 The Frame- work indicates that the system "must be based, whenever possible, on objective indicators of the seriousness of the violation." The Framework provides that "[t]he seriousness of the violation should be based primarily on: 1) the risk of harm inherent in the violation at the time it was committed and 2) the actual harm that resulted from the violation."70 In other words, elaborating on the "gravity component" of penalty calculation, the Framework directs EPA 68.

EPA intended that this Framework "provid[e] a framework for medium-specific penalty policies." EPA's Framework is intended to be a companion document to the Agency's 1984 Policy on Civil Penalties* which was to "establish a consis- tent Agency-wide approach to the assessment of civil penalties. . . ," and "to promote the goals of deterrence, fair and equitable treatment of the regulated community, and swift resolution of environmental problems."

EPA in- tended in the Policy on Civil Penalties to "focus Q on the general philosophy" behind EPA's approach to penalties. Id. The Policy directs EPA staff to assess penalties with three main components: 1) a "benefit" component - "penalties generally should, at a minimum, remove any significant economic benefits resulting from failure to comply with the law [p. 3], 2) a "gravity" compo- nent that "reflects the seriousness of the violation," and 3) consideration of "adjustment" factors such as ability to pay.

The Framework's offers the following guidance for do- ing so: Assigning a dollar figure to represent the gravity of a violation is an essentially subjective process. Nevertheless, the relative seriousness of different violations can be fairly accurately determined in most cases. This can be accomplished by reference to the goals of the specific regulatory scheme and the facts of each particular violation. Thus, linking the dollar amount of the gravity component to these ob- jective factors is a useful way of ensuring that viola- tions of approximately equal seriousness are treated the same way.72 Beyond its overarching Framework, EPA has further opera- tionalized or implemented its approach to penalty calculation through development of a series of program- specific policies. EPA has issued at least 35 "penalty policies" or "enforcement response policies" for its different programs.73 There are variations among these policies in their approach to environmental harm, but the idea that EPA should consider environmental harm as a factor in determining penalties is a common feature of these policies.74 71. 1984 Framework, supra note 68, at II. The Framework provides that EPA should consider the amount and toxicity of any pollutants involved, as well as the sensitivity of the environment, in evaluating actual or possible harm. Id. See also SAB Report, supra note 57, at II. (noting that EPA is to rank violations based on the seriousness of the act and consider actual or possible harm in completing such rankings). In addition to actual or potential harm, the Framework directs EPA staff to consider "importance to the regulatory scheme" (that is, the importance of the requirement to achieving the goal of the statute or regulation) in determining the gravity component of a penalty. Id. 72. 1984 Framework, supra note 68, at app. H.A. The Framework also reflects inten- tion that EPA staff consider the harm a violation causes to the environment in determining the gravity component of a penalty by providing that EPA staff may reduce the gravity component of a penalty if the violator "cooperates" by correcting the environmental problem prior to litigation. Such cooperation may justify a 50% reduction in the gravity component of a penalty. Thus, a violator may be able to reduce its penalty by taking actions to abate or redress environmental harm that it has caused, including to an ecosystem and the services it provides.

EPA has identified three basic goals for its enforcement efforts: 1) deterrence, 2) fairness, and 3) swift resolution of environmental problems.75 Particularly when violations cause significant harm, the theoretical literature sug- gests that imposing a penalty that incorporates such harm fur- thers at least the first two of these goals. B. Theoretical Support for EPA's Considering Significant Environmental Harm in Determining Penalties There is theoretical support for EPA's considering harm in im- posing penalties, particularly for significant violations that cause or threaten substantial harm.76 Failure to consider harm ade- TiONARY Source Penalty Policy (May 2002), available at http://www.epa.gov/compliance/ resources/policies/civil/caa/stationary/penpol.pdf; U.S. Envtl.

States similarly are not obligated to use them. Some states have developed their own policies, but not all. State approaches deserve focused attention, particularly since states conduct the vast majority of enforcement. 75. 1984 POLICY ON Civil Penalties, supra note 56, at 1 (establishing a "single set of goals for penalty assessment," notably "deterrence, fair and equitable treatment of the regu- lated community, and swift resolution of environmental problems."). 76. There is a considerable literature on the issue of optimal enforcement. Mark A. Cohen, Optimal Enforcement Strategy to Prevent Oil Spills: An Application of a Principal-Agent Model with Moral Hazard , 30 J.L. &amp; ECON. 23 (1987); Daniel A. Färber, Taking Slippage Seriously : Noncompliance and Creative Compliance in Environmental Law , 23 Harv. ENVTL. L. Rev. 297 (1999). For purposes of this article it is necessary only to make the point that enforcement theory supports considering harm in a variety of contexts. To provide a very brief and incomplete overview, there are two key types of deterrence, abso- lute and conditional. As the SAB has put it, society would never condone some offenses - like violent assaults and rapes - and these are treated as "unconditionally deterred" of- fenses. They are to be deterred, regardless of the private benefit to the offender. One framework for absolutely deterring violations in the environmental arena is to require the violator to disgorge the economic benefit it has gained through its violations. The idea is that if a rational economic actor knows that it will be required to disgorge any benefit it gains from the violations, it will have no incentive to violate. Economists also recognize, however, that this theory of absolute deterrence does not always work in practice, and that it may be appropriate to consider harm or other factors to increase the penalty beyond eco- nomic benefit when the goal is absolute deterrence. As the SAB and others have noted, environmental violations may also be treated under a framework known as "conditional deterrence." The notion here is that pollution is usually a byproduct of a socially beneficial activity and therefore should be considered to be a "con- ditionally deterred" offense - one that we only want to prohibit when its overall social costs exceed its overall social benefits. Economists suggest that harm is an appropriate basis for determining penalties in a context in which the goal is conditional deterrence because under this approach a violator's incentive is to obey the law if the harm it will cause by violating</page><page sequence="19">Spring, 2007] THINKING INSIDE THE BOX 567 quately in determining penalties may result in under -deterrence (i.e., it may result in too high levels of non-compliance), particu- larly of violations that cause significant harm. Regulated parties are more likely to commit violations that harm the environment (and that reduce the services ecosystems provide) when the penal- ties imposed do not force the violators to internalize the costs of such harm.77 The SAB provides an example to explain why in order to achieve appropriate deterrence EPA and other agencies should consider the harm a violation causes in determining an appropri- ate penalty amount, particularly when the harm is significant: It is worth emphasizing that this optimal penalty is based on the "harm" caused by the offense, not the "gain" to the offender. To take a simple criminal example, if a mugger obtained $100 in a robbery and the victim ended up spending three days in the hos- pital, a penalty based on the $100 gain to the of- fender would surely be too low - and would "under- deter" such offenses. The appropriate penalty would compensate the victim for three days in the hospital and pain and suffering. In the context of environmental offenses, suppose a firm fails to in- stall a $100 safety valve and as a result 10,000 gal- lons of crude oil spilled into a sensitive coastal area. The $100 "gain" to the offender would certainly not be an appropriate starting point for a penalty. In both of these cases, the problem is the failure to take account of the harm done to the victim in setting the penalty.78 will exceed the benefit it will derive by doing so. Under this framework, a penalty based on harm creates the proper incentives for behavior in the economics literature. It should be noted that, under conditional deterrence theory, if the gain due to noncompliance is large relative to the harm, a harm-based penalty will not deter noncompliance, but many econo- mists are comfortable with this "conditional deterrence" result since, because the gain from noncompliance exceeds the harm, noncompliance is actually the overall socially efficient outcome. Some environmental violations are considered to be of the "unconditional deter- rence" variety; thus, while economists might argue that they should be forgiven if the bene- fit from committing them exceeds the costs, the legislature has answered that question dif- ferently. SAB Report, supra note 57, at 25. 77. See SAB report, supra note 57. Penalty authority carries with it a risk of over- deterrence as well. This is true, for example, in a case in which a penalty includes an esti- mate of the harm that is too high. 78. Id. at 25. As noted, supra at note 76, there is an argument that, theoretically, penalties that recoup economic benefit should absolutely deter violations. As the SAB puts it, if EPA were in every case to impose a penalty equal to the gain to the offender divided by</page><page sequence="20">568 JOURNAL OF LAND USE [Vol. 22.2 The threat of more significant sanctions for violations that cause relatively significant harm also may provide what some economists have characterized as marginal deterrence. As Polinsky and Shavell put it: [E]xpected sanctions influence which harmful acts individuals choose to commit. Notably, such indi- viduals will have a reason to commit less harmful rather than more harmful acts if expected sanctions rise with harm. Deterrence of a more harmful act because its expected sanction exceeds that for a less harmful act is sometimes referred to as marginal de- terrence.79 Polinsky and Shavell conclude that: Other things being equal, it is socially desirable that enforcement policy creates marginal deterrence, so that those who are not deterred from committing harmful acts have a reason to moderate the amount of harm that they cause. This suggests that sanc- tions should rise with the magnitude of harm. . . . [M] arginai deterrence is naturally accomplished if the expected sanction equals harm for all levels of harm; for if a person is paying for harm done, he will have to pay appropriately more if he does greater harm."80 The SAB suggests that EPA should also consider harm in set- ting penalties because doing so will lead to more fair results (an- other policy objective EPA articulates in its enforcement policies): An important aspect of fairness is the restoration of the status quo : the law has been violated, and one the probability of detection and punishment, it would never be in the potential offender's interest to violate the law. SAB Report, supra note 57, at 25. But, there are several circum- stances in which this argument does not hold - e.g., if there is uncertainty as to whether EPA will discover a violation, or pursue it, or be successful in determining, and requiring the disgorgement of, the entire economic benefit. Id. at 25-26. 79. Polinsky and Shavell, supra note 15, at 63. 80. Id. "[M] arginai deterrence also can be promoted by increasing the probability of detection as well as the magnitude of sanctions. For example, [as the SAB puts it,] kidnap- pers can be deterred from killing their victims if greater police resources are devoted to apprehending kidnappers who murder their victims than to those who do not." Id. This point obviously has implications for the allocation of resources to, and design of, EPA in- spection and monitoring schemes and their effectiveness in uncovering violations that threaten or cause significant harm to ecosystems and their services.</page><page sequence="21">Spring, 2007] THINKING INSIDE THE BOX 569 objective of the penalty system is to return to the status quo before the violation occurred. . . . [Rļemoving the economic benefit is not the only ac- tion that might be required in order to restore the status quo. With a violation of an environmental regulation, there is a loss resulting from the pol- luter's action in the form of some harm to the natu- ral environment. Whether the natural resource that is harmed belongs to a private individual or the gen- eral public, restoration of the status quo can call for some appropriate compensatory action, perhaps in the form of a penalty based on harm to the environ- ment rather than on gain to the polluter.81 To sum up, it appears to be undisputed that Congressional and Agency policies direct Agency staff to consider environmental harm (actual and potential) in determining penalty amounts. There also appears to be theoretical support for EPA to pursue such approaches. Thus, the major remaining questions involve the extent to which EPA is, in fact, considering harm, including harm to ecosystem services, in determining penalty amounts and, re- 81. SAB Report, supra note 57, at 1. The SAB characterizes as "the major focus" of EPA' s penalty policy the fairness notion that the "restorative objective of a penalty system is to undo the violation and return the situation to how it was before the violation occurred." Id. at 9. The SAB notes that restoring the status quo requires not only disgorging the un- warranted gain to the violator, but also making good on the "unwarranted loss" to some other party. The SAB notes that a compensatory action could include both clean-up and some form of environmental restoration. 'The costs of clean-up and environmental restora- tion are thus compensation that should be paid by the polluter in order to restore the status quo." Id. The SAB elaborates on this issue as follows: In summary, the restoration of the status quo would appear to be an im- portant aspect of the fairness objective in setting the penalty for a viola- tion of an environmental regulation. This restorative goal can be seen to have two possible implications. If one focuses on the polluter's unlawful gain, restoration of the status quo implies that he should give up the gain. If one focuses on the unlawful harm to the environment, restora- tion of the status quo implies that he should pay an amount covering the cost of cleanup and/or environmental restoration. In general, there is no reason to expect that the two different approaches will lead to a similar assessment of a monetary payment: the cost avoided by failing to control pollution need bear no relationship to the damage caused by the pollu- tion. This raises two questions: Which approach is presently adopted by the EPA? Which approach seems preferable, or should they be combined in some manner? With regard to the first question, . . . the current EPA penalty policy . . . contain [s] some elements of both approaches. . . .

It is to these questions that I now turn briefly in the following section. C. EPA's Experience in Assessing Environmental Harm in Determining Penalties and its Challenges in Doing So A recent SAB report suggests the possibility of a significant gap between the Congressional and Agency policy direction (dis- cussed in Section III.A) and the theory supporting considering harm (discussed in Section III.B), and the reality on the ground. The SAB report indicates that the reality in the penalty calcula- tion context is that, despite the direction in the generic and media- specific agency policies, EPA has traditionally focused much of its penalty calculation efforts on the first prong in the Agency's pen- alty calculation methodology, determining economic benefit, and it has paid little attention to harm.82 After spending almost two years reviewing EPA's approach to calculating penalties,83 the SAB noted that EPA devotes much more effort to determining and re- couping economic benefit than it pays to determining and monetiz- ing environmental harm as part of its gravity analysis. "[T]he cur- rent EPA penalty process appears to focus overwhelmingly on the calculation of the unlawful gain to the polluter, with no systematic consideration of the monetary value of the environmental damage caused by the violation...."84 Along the same lines, the SAB con- cluded that "[s]ince 1978, the EPA has made the violator's eco- nomic benefit from . . . violating the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts the centerpiece of its calculation of civil penalties." 85 In its comments on the SAB report, EPA acknowledges this is the case.86 The SAB has concluded that it is feasible for EPA to calculate harm, and has recommended that EPA embark on such an effort, but EPA has not embraced this recommendation with open arms. The SAB offers the following advice in its cover letter to the 2005 report: "The Panel believes that the state-of-the art in benefits es- timation has progressed to the point where EPA should seriously explore how it might incorporate 'harm-based' measures into its penalty formula. . . . "87 On the other hand, EPA points to various 82. SAB Report, supra note 57, at 10. 83.

Little such in-depth assessment has been done to date. Thus, my main purpose in this section is to suggest the beginnings of a fu- ture research agenda to develop a better understanding of current practices, and future challenges and opportunities. Questions that deserve attention include: 1) How often does EPA consider harm, including harm to ecosystem services?; 2) What motivates the Agency to consider harm in some cases and not in others?; 3) How does EPA carry out such efforts?; 4) Are there significant regional variations in the answers to these questions; and 5) To the extent there is a gap between theory and policy directives, on the one hand, and implementation on the other, what are the practical constraints or other factors that may account for this gap, and are there ways EPA can overcome these constraints so the Agency is able to consider harm to ecosystem services more than it does cur- rently? The answers to these questions will help to inform consid- eration of the extent to which, and possible ways in which, EPA can and should pay more attention to the harm (and potential harm) a violation causes in determining the appropriate penalty. A final observation is that EPA's penalty calculation authori- ties provide it with a forum for promoting learning about ecosys- tem services. The ecosystem services literature is full of references to data limitations.89 To name three, there are significant limits to our knowledge about: 1) baseline conditions - the current state of the environment and the services it provides; 2) impacts - the ex- tent to which different types of environmental insults cause harm to different types of ecosystems; and 3) valuation - the dollar value of the level of harm particular violations cause. EPA has the opportunity to advance learning in all three of these areas as part of its efforts to calculate penalties. To provide one example, if a Johnson, EPA Administrator (Sept. 7, 2005) (on file with the author). See also SAB Report, supra note 57, at 5, 26. In concluding that benefits estimation is feasible in some cases, the SAB notes that "there is some continuing disagreement about the relative merits of alterna- tive approaches and their overall reliability." Id. at 26. 88. Id. at 4. EPA also indicates that "[w]hile the Agency's penalty policies do consider the environmental harm from the violations (when present)," it asserts that "the violations EPA prosecutes rarely involve provable environmental damage." Id. 89. See e.g., supra note 19.</page><page sequence="24">572 JOURNAL OF LAND USE [Vol. 22.2 violation harms a particular wetland, EPA has the authority, in determining an appropriate penalty, to gather data on the natural environment involved (e.g., the qualities of the wetland and the services the wetland provides); it has authority to gather data on the nature and extent of the harm that the violation caused to the wetland and the services it provides; and the Agency has the au- thority to calculate, and place, a monetary value on this harm. EPA can use these types of data-gathering and valuation efforts to learn more about the particular resources involved. It also can in- corporate this knowledge and expertise on a broader scale, to bol- ster our knowledge of natural inventories by improving our under- standing of baseline conditions and services. Thus, in short, learn- ing the Agency derives from calculating a "harm-based" penalty for one set of violations may provide information that will facilitate understanding, protecting, and restoring ecosystems and the ser- vices they provide in a range of contexts. IV. Injunctive Relief As noted above, EPA's enforcement authorities include the au- thority to impose injunctive relief, in addition to the power to im- pose penalties. In at least some circumstances, EPA has defined the scope of its injunctive authority to include the power to require violators to cease violations and to repair any harm the violations have caused. EPA has noted, for example, that "[i]n settling en- forcement actions, EPA requires alleged violators to promptly cease the violations and, to the extent feasible, remediate any harm caused by the violations."90 EPA's injunctive authorities appear to give it significant oppor- tunities to protect ecosystems and the services they provide, in at least three ways. Most obviously, if a violation is causing harm to an ecosystem or threatening to do so, EPA can enjoin the violator to change its behavior by terminating the activities that are caus- ing or threatening harm and to take steps to minimize the pros- pects for recurrence. There are limitations on EPA's authority, in- cluding courts' having the equitable discretion to determine appro- priate relief in particular cases and thereby override EPA's pre- ferred approach.91 Nevertheless, in broad terms EPA has long as- 90. Final EPA Supplemental Environmental Projects Policy Issued, 63 Fed. Reg. 24796, 24796 (May 5, 1998) [hereinafter Final SEPs Policy]. 91. Courts generally have extraordinarily broad equitable authority to "do justice" in resolving cases involving violations of the environmental laws. See, e.g., Weinberger v. Ro- mero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 320 (1982) (indicating that the CWA "permits the district court to order that relief it considers necessary to secure prompt compliance with the Act"); cf. Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978). (holding that Congress had limited</page><page sequence="25">Spring, 2007] THINKING INSIDE THE BOX 573 serted the power to require violators to cease their violations and return to compliance.92 Second, as indicated in the initial paragraph in this section, in at least some cases EPA asserts that its injunctive authorities em- power it to enjoin a violator to act affirmatively to address harm that it has caused. Professor Edward Lloyd and others have sug- gested limits to this authority. 93 In many cases, however, EPA has negotiated agreements that obligated alleged violators to remedi- ate harm their violations have caused, and in others courts or EPA's judges or Environmental Appeals Board have required vio- lators to do so. Finally, EPA's injunctive authorities appear to give it signifi- cant capacity for learning that will promote protection of ecosys- tems and the services they provide by advancing understanding of ecosystems and these services. As noted above, the ecosystem ser- vices literature identifies significant data-related shortcomings to our ability to protect and restore ecosystems. These include limits in our understanding of: 1) baseline conditions - the current state of the environment and the services it provides; 2) impacts - the extent to which different types of environmental insults cause harm to different types of ecosystems and, related, the impact of these harms on the capacity of ecosystems to provide services such as pollination, flood control, and the like; and 3) the efficacy and cost of different approaches to protecting and restoring ecosystems and the services they provide. EPA has the opportunity to use its injunctive authorities to advance learning in all three of these ar- eas. To use the same example discussed above, if a violation harms a wetland, EPA claims the authority, in determining appro- priate injunctive relief, to: 1) gather data on the qualities of the wetland and on the services the wetland provides; 2) develop in- formation on the nature and extent of the harm that the violation caused to the wetland and the services it provides; and 3) require the courts' traditionally broad equitable jurisdiction). EPA also has broad enforcement dis- cretion to decide whether to prosecute, how to prosecute, and whether to settle a case. See e.g., Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985) (an agency's discretion not to enforce is gener- ally committed to the agency's absolute discretion); Oil Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers v. Oc- cupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm'sn, 671 F.2d 643, 650 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (EPA's enforcement discretion includes the discretion to settle a case). 92. 1984 EPA POLICY ON CIVIL PENALTIES, supra note 56. 93.

While the same types of barriers to EPA's pursuing more harm- based penalty calculations exist in the injunctive relief context, such as resource constraints, methodological challenges, and the like, the fact that EPA has the ability in some cases to direct the violators to do the basic investigatory and remedial or restorative work means that EPA can reduce these barriers by shifting much of the work to the violators rather than undertake this work itself. While EPA needs to maintain the capacity to direct and oversee a violator's work, the resource demands should be less than if EPA were doing the work itself. Further, the economic valuation work will be in much less demand on the injunctive end of the relief spectrum, thereby simplifying EPA's methodological challenges in justifying commitments from violators. Another point worth mentioning concerning the promise of EPA's injunctive authority as a tool to protect ecosystems is that EPA has structured its enforcement policies to create leverage for its efforts to have violators undertake needed remedial work. EPA's Framework allows Agency staff to reduce the gravity com- ponent of a penalty significantly if the violator "cooperates" by cor- recting the environmental problem prior to litigation.94 This ap- proach obviously creates an incentive for violators to reach agree- ment with EPA on appropriate injunctive actions to abate and/or redress environmental harm that they have caused, including to an ecosystem and the services it provides, so that the violators may reduce their penalty by taking such actions. V. SEPS EPA has coined the acronym SEPs (shorthand for Supplemen- tal Environmental Projects) to refer to a third type of enforcement- related relief that holds promise for advancing knowledge of eco- systems and the services they provide, and for protecting, restor- ing, and enhancing such services. This Part examines the poten- tial for SEPs to serve as a useful form of relief for improving pro- 94. 1984 Framework, supra note 68; See also Catskill Mountains Chap, of Trout v.

More generally, the Clean Water Act's direction that courts consider a defendant's good faith effort to comply in assessing a penalty similarly indicates that efforts to comply can help to mitigate a penalty.

While I focus on EPA's SEPs policies and practices, states' interest in SEPs ap- pears to have increased as well.

For favorable characterizations of SEPs, see, e.g., Dana, supra note 96, at 1205 (noting that several commentators and others have referred to SEPs as "win-win" opportu- nities); Laurie Droughton, Comment, Supplemental Environmental Projects: A Bargain for the Environment , 12 PACE ENVTL.

First, firms can be motivated to innovate . . . through penalty reduction, improved relations with the Agency, and improved public relations.

The Agency issued its Final SEPs Policy in 1998," but the Agency had been entering into SEPs for approximately twenty years prior to its is- suance of the 1998 Policy.100 The Agency has continued to give SEPs substantial policy attention; it has issued at least 17 guid- ance memoranda on SEPs since 1998. 101 The Agency's rhetoric has generally been quite supportive of SEPs. In its 1998 Final SEPs Policy, EPA announced that it "placed a high priority" on including SEPs in settlements.102 EPA has issued a series of post- 1998 refinements to its SEPs Policy in order to "help promote the use of SEPs in enforcement settle- ments."103 It has, for example, taken steps to simplify the process for approval of SEPs and to increase incentives for violators to agree to SEPs.104 In a 2002 Memorandum, the Agency stated that regulators, regulated parties, and interested citizens.) Professor David Dana identifies a variety of reasons why regulators may be favorably disposed to SEPs. Dana, supra note 96, at 1200-1 (suggesting that regulators may generate political backing from local residents and that this increased local goodwill may produce more resources. Further, "[iļncreased local goodwill may translate into purely psychic benefits for regulators. [Regulators may experience psychic satisfaction in witnessing an environmental improvement that results directly from their efforts." Regulators may find it beneficial to use SEPs as a learning op- portunity or as a "testing ground" for future regulatory programs.). Dana also suggests that SEPs may be beneficial by engendering greater internalization of "the norms of good envi- ronmental citizenship" and therefore lead to increased compliance. Id. at 1211.

We encourage the Regions to continue to promote SEPs and look for opportunities to incorporate such projects into their set- tlements."105 Echoing the Agency's rhetoric, Professor David Dana suggested in a 1998 article that "the use of SEPs by public regula- tors . . . soon will become (or arguably already has become) a major component of environmental enforcement."106 In light of the internal and external optimism about SEPs and support for them, EPA's track record in negotiating SEPs might come as a bit of a surprise. The use of SEPs has not increased substantially, as one might expect from EPA's rhetoric.107 Instead, as the Annual Results data above reflects, in EPA's FY 2001, EPA estimated the value of the SEPs it entered into that year to be about $90 million, while over the past four years, the value of SEPs has declined to amounts in the range of $45-$65 million an- nually.108 Data that Professor Kenneth Kristi has compiled indi- cates that the number of SEPs has not increased in recent years either.109 The rest of this Part reviews key features of SEPs. It concludes by identifying, and briefly exploring, several possible strategies for expanding use of SEPs beyond historic and current levels. A. Definitions: What are SEPs? As EPA explains, SEPs have a unique role in EPA's enforce- ment tool box. They are intended to "obtain environmental and public health protection and improvements that may not otherwise 105.

While David Dana reported in 1998 that the dollar value of SEPs in FY 1995 substantially exceeded the value of civil and administrative penalties that EPA assessed ($103,840,773 vs. approximately $70 million), in 1996, SEPs declined to $65 million, while civil and administrative penalties increased to more than $96 million. Dana, supra note 96, at 1189. The Annual Results , supra note 27, at 5, which brings these figures up to date for the past five years, reflects that while the ratio of the value of SEPs to the value of civil penalties was relatively stable from 2001-2003, at about 65-70% (2001 = 71%, or 89/126; 2002=64%, or 58/90; and 2003 = 68%, or 65/96), there has been a dramatic drop-off in SEPs the past two years. In 2004, the ratio is only 32%, $48 million SEPs/$149 million civil pen- alties; and in 2005 the ratio was 37%, $57 million/$154 million.

See Kristi, supra note 96.</page><page sequence="30">578 JOURNAL OF LAND USE [Vol. 22.2 have occurred . . . ." 110 In this way they complement EPA's tradi- tional injunctive authority to require violators to cease violations and remediate any harm the violations have caused.111 EPA has established three threshold criteria for consideration of a project as a SEP. First, the project must be "environmentally beneficial." EPA explains that "environmentally beneficial" means a "SEP must improve, protect, or reduce risks to public health, or the environment at large."112 Second, the violator must not be legally obligated to perform the project that it will undertake as a SEP. EPA notes that, for example, "if a court is likely to order a defendant to perform a spe- cific activity in a particular case, such an activity does not qualify as a SEP."113 Third, the alleged violator must commit to perform the project as part of a settlement of an enforcement action.114 SEPs are available only in the enforcement arena; they are not available as part of EPA's regulatory process (for example, as permit conditions EPA includes in authorizing a facility to operate under one or more environmental laws) or through EPA's exercise of its rulemaking authorities. Further, in the enforcement arena, EPA only pursues SEPs in settlements, not as relief in litigated cases.115 B. Additional Requirements for and Features of SEPs EPA has established additional requirements for approval of SEPs, directing that its staff use a four-step process in considering a possible SEP project, after ensuring that the project meets the definition of a SEP: 1) the project must satisfy all legal guidelines (including "nexus"); 2) it must fit within a designated category of SEPs; 3) EPA staff must determine the appropriate amount of penalty mitigation; and 4) EPA staff must ensure that a project satisfies various implementation and other criteria.116 This section 110.

Legal Guidelines118 SEPs raise at least two threshold legal questions: 1) whether EPA has the legal authority to negotiate commitments to perform environmentally beneficial work that it cannot require a defendant to undertake; and 2) whether EPA has the authority to reduce the size of a penalty in exchange for such a commitment? The short answer is that for the past twenty-plus years, EPA has answered each of these questions in the affirmative, in its various SEPs policies and elsewhere. The Agency has consistently claimed that it has authority to negotiate commitments for work that it lacks legal power to impose or require; and, further, the Agency has the ability to offer reduced penalties in exchange for such commitments.119 The Agency has, however, established certain "legal guidelines" to bolster its legal position that SEPs are defensible, including re- quiring a "nexus" between a proposed project and the violations at issue.120 In its 1998 SEPs Policy, EPA indicates that the requisite 117. For more extensive treatment, see generally Lloyd, supra note 93; Kristi, supra note 96; Dana, supra note 96. 118. Final SEPs Policy, supra note 90, at 24798-99. 119. EPA' s lawyers and others claim that EPA has the authority to enter into SEPs that commit alleged violators to take action that EPA could not order the violators to under- take because the SEPs are the result of negotiations and, as a result, they are projects the violator has entered into willingly. Final SEPs Policy, supra note 90, at 247897-98. I do not address the merits of this issue in this article. For legal analyses of EPA's authority, see for example, Kristi, supra note 96, at 24-34; Dana, supra note 96, at 1182-1184 (suggesting that "[t]he only serious controversy regarding SEPs has concerned their statutory basis," and summarizing some of the arguments pro and con); Lloyd, supra note 93, at 413-15 (conclud- ing that "[b]oth the courts and Congress have accepted, if not actively encouraged, SEPs either by affirmative approvals or passive acceptance" and that EPA has "adopted SEPs as a major component of its own enforcement regime.") (Professor Lloyd acknowledges that he is an attorney with Columbia's law clinic, has brought several citizen suits that included SEPs, and is a strong advocate for SEPs); and Bonorris et al., supra note 95, at 198, 199 ("courts have upheld the legality of consent decrees that go beyond the express relief out- lined in a statute, with the proviso that the decrees are consistent with the underlying pur- pose of the statute."). EPA, and the U.S. government through the Department of Justice, have opposed SEPs in citizen suits in some cases. Lloyd, supra note 93, at 430 (suggesting that EPA and DOJ have '"kept a watchful eye" on settlements of citizen suits). Lloyd notes that courts "ordi- narily" have entered proposed consent decrees resolving citizen suits with a SEP compo- nent, even over EPA and DOJ objections. Id. 120. See e.g., Suarez, Expanding Use, supra note 103. To ensure that the Agency's enforcement discretion is used appropriately and in compliance with the U.S. Constitution and the MRA, all SEPs must satisfy several key elements. To be approved as a SEP, a project must: 1) Be related to or have a "nexus" to the underlying violation; 2) Provide significant environmental and public health benefits; 3) Benefit the community affected by the violation; and 4) Secure public health</page><page sequence="32">580 JOURNAL OF LAND USE [Vol. 22.2 relationship between a project and a violation may exist in any of three ways: 1) the project will reduce the likelihood that similar violations will occur in the future; 2) the project will reduce the ad- verse impact to public health or the environment to which the vio- lation at issue contributes; or 3) the project will reduce the overall risk to public health or the environment potentially affected by the violation at issue.121 This broad definition of SEPs seemingly would include a sig- nificant number of projects that have the potential to improve the environment. For example, under the third type of nexus, a SEP project would seem to have adequate nexus if the project operates to protect or enhance a part of the environment if a violation poses a risk to that part of the environment, such as a particular ecosys- tem. There is some suggestion that EPA is prepared to define "nexus" even more broadly than that. EPA's SEPs Policy contin- ues that "[n]exus is easier to establish if the primary impact of the project is ... in the same ecosystem or within the immediate geo- graphic area."122 Implicit in this is that a SEP is approvable even and/or environmental improvements beyond what can be achieved under applicable environmental laws. Id. at 2. Not all commentators agree that nexus is needed. See e.g., Kristi, supra note 96. EPA has established other limitations on SEPs as well. For example, the Final SEPs Policy indicated that SEPs may not be profitable to a defendant. Final SEPs Policy, supra note 90, at 24798. EPA modified this policy in 2003, issuing a memorandum that EPA may accept SEPs that prove profitable to a defendant in some cases. Memorandum from John Peter Suarez, Asst. Adm'r, EPA OECA, to Reg'l Counsel et al., Guidance for Determining Whether a Project is Profitable, When to Accept Profitable Projects as Supplemental Environmental Projects, and How to Value Such Projects (Dec. 5, 2003), available at http://www.epa.gov/ compliance/resources/policies/civil/seps/seps-profitableprojects.pdf. 121. Final SEPs Policy, supra note 90, at 24798. The other four "legal guidelines" that EPA identifies in its Policy appear to limit the availability of SEPs in ways that might limit SEPs for ecosystem services in some contexts, but by no means all. Thus, a project cannot be "inconsistent with any provision of the underlying statute;" EPA cannot play a role in managing or controlling funds for the SEP or manage the SEP, but it can oversee it; the settlement agreement must provide sufficient detail concerning the project; and EPA cannot use a project to meet its statutory obligations or another agency's obligations. Id. at 24798. EPA's Lowrence, 2002 SEPs Memo, supra note 105, reiterates these elements of the Policy. The 2002 SEPs Memo also lists other restrictions: 7) A project may not provide EPA . . . with additional resources to per- form a particular activity for which Congress has specifically appropri- ated funds. 8) A project may not provide additional resources to support specific ac- tivities performed by EPA employees or EPA contractors. 9) A project may not provide a federal grantee with additional funds to perform a specific task identified within an assistance agreement. 10) Projects that involve only contributions to a charitable or civic or- ganization are not acceptable.

He indicated that EPA staff may, in certain circumstances, aggregate SEPs in multiple cases (e.g., EPA may allow regulated parties to pool re- 123. For example, EPA officials indicated that if a violation occurs in a tributary or stream of a larger river; the SEP may take place in a different part of the river to improve the overall quality of the river as a whole. E-mail from Beth Cavalier, supra note 104. On the other hand, in an October 2002 memorandum, EPA suggests that "geography alone does not create nexus. The mere fact that a SEP is beneficial to an area near a facility does not by itself satisfy the nexus requirement. Enforcement staff must be able to demonstrate how the project relates to the violations that are the subject of the enforcement action." Memorandum from Walker Smith, Dir., Office of Regulatory Enforcement, to Reg'l Counsel, Importance of the Nexus Requirement in the Supplemental Environmental Projects Policy 2 (Oct. 31, 2002), available at http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/policies/civil/seps/ sepnexus-mem.pdf [hereinafter Smith, Importance of the Nexus]. (ORE is now called the Office of Civil Enforcement.) Thus, while geography does not appear to be necessary in all cases to establish nexus, it is also not necessarily sufficient to do so.

Specific Categories of Projects EPA lists seven specific categories of projects that may qualify as SEPs. This list provides strong evidence that EPA is prepared to approve SEPs that have significant potential to protect ecosys- tems and the services they provide.132 For example, EPA's fourth category of permissible SEPs, entitled "Environmental Restoration and Protection," refers explicitly to projects "which enhance [ ] the condition of the ecosystem or immediate geographic area adversely affected."133 The Agency continues: "These projects may be used to restore or protect natural environments (such as ecosystems). . . . This category also includes any project which protects the ecosys- tem from actual or potential damage resulting from the violation or improves the overall condition of the ecosystem."134 EPA lists "[restoration of] a wetland in the same ecosystem ... in which the 129.

On the other hand, then Enforcement head Suarez indicates that EPA's OGC vetoed the idea of aggregating SEP funds because of concerns that doing so would raise questions under the MRA. "A cash payment, such as a payment ... to a SEP 'bank,' where there is no further responsibility for the defendant ... to ensure that a specific project is completed, is prohibited because it could easily be construed as a diversion from the Treas- ury of penalties due and owing the government." Id. at 3. Suarez indicates that defendants may hire third parties to assist with SEPs, so long as the defendant retains full responsibil- ity for the SEP. A defendant may not negotiate a SEP that involves making a cash payment to a third party to conduct the SEP without the defendant's retraining full responsibility. Id. at 4. 132.

Several of the types of projects EPA lists in this Memorandum similarly reflect EPA's policy position that SEPs may encompass protection and restoration of ecosystems and ecosystem services: Implement projects that create, restore and/or pre- serve threatened aquatic resources, including wet- lands.

EPA's Section 404 Penalty Policy, for example, offers the following regarding SEPs: SEPs are particularly encouraged in the Section 404 program if the SEP results in protection of a wetland resource or other special aquatic site. For example, purchase and dedicated use of buffer land around a wetland helps ensure the survival of wetland re- sources, and is an appropriate and valuable SEP, as is upland land acquisition lying in wetland mosaics. In addition, deeding over wetlands in perpetuity for the purpose of conservation promotes program inter- ests and the goals of the Clean Water Act.140 In short, EPA's SEPs policies, and some of its program- specific enforcement policies, define permissible (and desirable) SEPs in a way that encompasses projects that will protect, enhance, and re- store ecosystems.141 In at least some circumstances, these projects may focus on ecosystems other than the one that a violator has harmed. In this way, SEPs would seem to have the potential to serve as a helpful compliment to EPA's traditional injunctive relief authority in protecting and restoring ecosystems and the services they provide. 3. SEPs' Penalty Mitigation Potential The discussion in the preceding two sections highlights the po- tential value of SEPs as a "beyond compliance" tool that EPA po- tentially can use to require protection and restoration of ecosys- tems. A violator may, however, need to spend considerable funds to negotiate a SEP with EPA, to develop and implement the SEP, and to monitor and document its effectiveness. Further, a violator 139.

EPA's 404 Policy continues that "restoration of any area of the viola- tion, or any mitigation in the form of injunctive relief to remedy such violations (including mitigation for the temporal loss of wetlands functions and values), does not constitute a SEP." Id. at 20. 141. As indicated above, EPA's SEPs policies identify a wide variety of projects that may qualify as SEPs. The 1998 Policy includes as a catchall category "other types of pro- jects" that have environmental merit. Final SEPs Policy, supra note 90, at 24800.</page><page sequence="37">Spring, 2007] THINKING INSIDE THE BOX 585 may take on new sanctionable commitments in agreeing to per- form a SEP. The obvious question is, why would an alleged viola- tor agree to perform such "beyond compliance" work and accept the additional attendant liability risks.142 This is work the violator is not obligated to do, money it is not obligated to spend, and risks of punishment it is not required to accept. The intuitive short answer is that EPA's substantial penalty authority gives it significant leverage to negotiate SEPs, since EPA has indicated its willingness to reduce a penalty for a SEP. EPA indicates in the 1998 SEPs Policy that Evidence of a violator's commitment and ability to perform a SEP is also a relevant factor for EPA to consider in establishing an appropriate settlement penalty. All else being equal, the final settlement penalty will be lower for a violator who agrees to perform an acceptable SEP compared to the violator who does not agree to perform a SEP.143 The 1998 SEPs Policy spells out the extent to which EPA is prepared to reduce a payable penalty in exchange for a commit- ment to perform a SEP. Ordinarily, a penalty would be the sum of the economic benefit and gravity - in EPA's words, "this sum is the minimum amount that would be necessary to settle the case without a SEP."144 The SEPs Policy provides that "in settlements in which the defendant/respondent committed to conduct a SEP, the final settlement penalty must equal or exceed either: a) The economic benefit of noncompliance plus 10 percent of the gravity component; or b) 25 percent of the gravity component only; which- ever is greater."145 Thus, the SEPs Policy anticipates that EPA staff may mitigate up to 90% of the gravity component of a penalty in some cases, in exchange for a regulated party's commitment to perform a SEP. This is likely to be attractive to a violator, at least in cases in which the gravity component of a penalty is substantial. Two examples make this clear. Assume a situation in which EPA would seek a penalty of $500,000, based on the Agency's cal- culation of a $400,000 economic benefit and a $100,000 gravity component. In this case, a violator would still have to pay a pen- 142. Another question involves the scope of EPA's authority to encourage and agree to "beyond compliance" projects as a factor EPA will consider when determining an appropri- ate penalty. 143. Final SEPs Policy, supra note 90, at 24797. See supra note 98 for other reasons why a regulated party might be interested in performing a SEP. 144. Final SEPs Policy, supra note 90, at 24801. 145. Id.</page><page sequence="38">586 JOURNAL OF LAND USE [Vol. 22.2 alty of $410,000, even if it committed to do a SEP.146 Next assume a situation in which the figures are reversed: the economic benefit is $100,000 and the gravity is $400,000. Here, a violator conceiva- bly could have its penalty reduced to $140, 000.147 In the latter case, a violator has the ability to significantly reduce its penalty by performing a SEP; SEPs in such cases are likely to hold particular interest. The SEPs Policy includes a number of other details relevant to deciding how much a SEP should reduce a payable penalty. For example, EPA considers the "quality of the SEP' to determine what percentage of the SEP cost should be applied as mitigation against the amount EPA would settle for, but for the SEP. 148 EPA lists six factors to consider in evaluating the quality of SEPs. Two are particularly relevant to ecosystem services. Indeed, in its de- scription of each factor EPA specifically refers to protection and restoration of ecosystems as reasons to provide maximum penalty reduction in exchange for a regulated party's implementation of a project. First, EPA considers "benefits to the public or environ- ment at large." 149 EPA notes that SEPS will "perform well" on this factor "to the extent they result in significant and . . . measurable progress in protecting and restoring ecosystems (including wet- lands and endangered species habitats)."150 Second, EPA considers "innovativeness." 151 It elaborates on this factor as follows: SEPS which perform well on this factor will further the development, implementation, or dissemination of innovative processes, technologies, or methods which more effectively: reduce the generation, re- lease or disposal of pollutants; conserve natural re- sources; restore and protect ecosystems; protect en- dangered species; or promote compliance.152 146. The violator would have to pay the entire economic benefit of $400,000, plus ten percent of the gravity component of $100,000, for a total of $410,000. 147. The violator would have to pay the entire economic benefit of $100,000, plus ten percent of the gravity component of $400,000, for a total of $140,000. 148. Final SEPs Policy, supra note 90, at 24802. The Policy defines the "SEP cost" to be the "net present after-tax cost of the SEP." The notion of "SEP cost" has been the subject of considerable debate.

The other four factors that EPA considers in assessing the quality of the SEP and therefore the mitigation percentage the violator should receive, are environmental jus- tice, community input, multimedia impacts, and pollution prevention. Id. SEP projects that are of high quality because of the factors discussed in the text presumably will fare even better if any of these other factors exists also.</page><page sequence="39">Spring, 2007] THINKING INSIDE THE BOX 587 EPA indicates that the "better the performance of the SEP under each of these factors, the higher the appropriate mitigation per- centage." 153 A second key feature of SEPs' impact on penalty amounts is that, with limited exceptions, the mitigation percentage may not exceed eighty percent of the SEP cost.154 Some commentators have criticized this limitation on the ground that it makes rational vio- lators less likely to agree to perform SEPs.155 Even with this limi- tation, however, the possibility exists for significant penalty reduc- tion in exchange for a SEP in some circumstances. The bottom line in terms of SEPs' potential for penalty mitiga- tion is that, particularly for substantial penalties that include a significant gravity component, EPA has significant leverage to en- courage a regulated party to perform a SEP by offering in ex- change a sizeable reduction in that component of the penalty.156 4. Additional Implementation and Other Criteria The SEPs Policy identifies several other key features for ac- ceptable SEPs projects. Two features are likely to be especially useful in terms of SEPs' potential value as learning experiments. As indicated above, there is a lot to learn about ecosystems and the services they provide, and about the efficacy of different ap- proaches in restoring or protecting such ecosystems and services. The Policy encourages efforts to fill this gap. Further, it creates an expectation that defendants will bear the cost of such efforts. The Policy provides that "[t]o the extent feasible, defen- dant/respondents should be required to quantify the benefits asso- ciated with the project and provide EPA with a report setting forth how the benefits were measured or estimated."157 This feature of a SEPs project gives EPA the ability to encourage a violator to esti- 153. Id. 154. Id. In a 2000 memo, EPA's Director of the Office of Regulatory Enforcement rein- forced that the mitigation percentage should rarely exceed 80 percent of the SEP cost. Memorandum from Eric V. Schaeffer, Dir., Office of Regulatory Enforcement, to Reg'l Coun- sels, Appropriate Penalty Mitigation Credit under the SEP Policy (Apr. 14, 2000), available at http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/policies/civil/seps/seppenmit-mem.pdf. 155. See e.g., Kristi, supra note 96, at 42 (suggesting that EPA could increase violators' incentives to do SEPs by increasing the extent to which the Agency is prepared to forgive a penalty in exchange for such a project, and recommending that EPA increase its mitigation percentage to one hundred percent of a SEP's cost). Edward Lloyd has concluded that EPA's approach to penalty mitigation is a "rational" one. See Lloyd, supra note 93, at 437. 156. EPA encourages its staff to "consider giving more credit to a defendant who agrees to implement a SEP where there has been a commitment to include affected commu- nities into the SEP selection."

Final SEPs Policy, supra note 90, at 24803.</page><page sequence="40">588 JOURNAL OF LAND USE [Vol. 22.2 mate the benefits the project produces in terms of ecosystems ser- vices. To the extent that EPA is able to pursue such analyses in numerous settings throughout the country, involving a wide range of ecosystems and services, this experience is likely to advance learning about the value added from different types of projects in terms of their impacts on the services that ecosystems provide and the value of such services. Similarly, the Policy requires violators to submit a final report to EPA that documents completion of the SEP and SEP expendi- tures.158 Thus, in addition to fostering learning about benefits to ecosystems and the services they provide from different types of projects, SEPs have the potential to foster learning about the costs of such projects. This type of information, too, is likely to be help- ful to EPA and others interested in exploring options for protect- ing, enhancing, and/or restoring ecosystems and the services they provide. In sum, EPA's SEPs policy reflects EPA's view that it may ne- gotiate enforcement settlements that commit violators to imple- ment projects that protect, enhance, and restore ecosystems and the services they provide. Such projects logically may include pro- jects that: 1) help to diagnose the extent of ecosystem and ecosys- tem services degradation; 2) identify and implement strategies to protect and/or improve the ecosystem and its services; and 3) monitor the effectiveness of the work done. The fact that EPA can negotiate to have violators bear the responsibility and cost for un- dertaking this work adds to the potential value of SEPs as a tool to advance understanding and protection of ecosystems and their services in a world of limited government resources.159 158.

Challenges and Possible Opportunities The preceding discussion is intended to suggest that SEPs have substantial promise as an enforcement tool to protect ecosystems and the services they provide, and that those interested in advanc- ing such protection would be well-served by learning more about this tool and exploring its greater use.160 The intriguing question about SEPs with which I end this sec- tion is whether there are ways to enhance the value of SEPs for this purpose - are there steps EPA can take, for example, that are likely to increase the number of SEPs that protect ecosystems and the services they provide, or that increase the value such SEPs provide. As noted above, the Annual Results data reflects that, despite EPA's rhetorical support for SEPs, the track record over the past five years reflects stable (at best) use of SEPs since 2001, rather than increasing use.161 EPA's own high-ranking enforce- ment officials have touted the promise of SEPs to move well be- yond this level.162 There are some likely inherent limits in the use of SEPs. These include the additional transaction costs that regulated par- ties and the Agency each need to invest to negotiate a SEP. In some cases these are undoubtedly significant. Thus, unless the potential penalty is significant, it may not be worth the transac- tion costs to pursue a SEP. Further, there are likely cases in which the regulated parties desire finality by concluding an en- forcement matter, rather than agreeing to continuing obliga- tions.163 waterbodies; 3. researching methods of reducing pollution or otherwise improving the envi- ronmental health of those waterbodies; habitat restoration). 160. Again, I am not suggesting that SEPs are necessarily the most desirable way to advance such goals (see, for example , Dana, supra note 96), or that their use does not raise concerns. See e.g., Greve, supra note 97. 161. In his recent article, Kenneth Kristi claims to have made the first effort to ana- lyze SEPs data from 1992-2005, and concludes that less than thirteen percent of settlements annually in cases involving penalties during this period included SEPs, and that this per- centage has been "steadily declining" since the mid-1990s. Kristi, supra note 96, at 2. Kristl's data, which provide numbers of SEPs finalized rather than dollar value of SEPs negotiated, appear to show a highwater mark of 348 SEPs finalized in 1995. Beginning in 1998, the SEP numbers he reports are: 1) 1998: 221; 2) 1999: 197; 3) 2000: 193; 4) 2001: 164; 5) 2002: 157; 6) 2003: 150; 7) 2004: 213; and 8) 2005: 207. Kristi, supra note 96, at 22-23. For a review of Kristl's methodology, see Kristi, supra note 96. EPA itself has suggested that there is a "tremendous opportunity" to increase negotiation of SEPs. Suarez, Expand- ing Use, supra note 103, at 1. Because SEPs are limited to enforcement settlements, it is important to consider the numbers of SEPs negotiated in the context of the number of set- tlements finalized each year. 162.

I offer below four possible approaches to increase the use of SEPs, assuming this is the policy direction of choice. None of these is intended to be a panacea - challenges will remain, and there are policy reasons not to pursue some of these approaches, in addition to reasons to consider them. 1. Revamping the process for proposing and approving SEPs, and the substantive criteria for doing so. One obvious place to look for possible opportunities for EPA to improve upon its SEPs per- formance is at the processes the agency uses to review and approve SEPs, and at the substantive criteria it applies in doing so. The current process does not appear seamless, in a number of respects. One question is whether there are steps EPA can take that would streamline or expedite the process for identifying SEPs and then reaching agreement with a regulated party on an appropriate SEP for a particular case. EPA's policies place EPA staff in a reac- tive position with respect to SEPs. EPA may react to a regulated party's proposal to include a particular SEP in an enforcement set- tlement, but EPA staff may not propose a SEP themselves.164 This approach would seem to create the potential for a "we'll know it when we see it" scenario, a structure unlikely to inspire violators to pursue creative possibilities for SEPs.165 EPA reports that it has made progress in educating regulated parties about the likely parameters for acceptable SEPs, through creation of libraries of SEPs projects and other steps.166 Close review is needed, however, penalties if this occurs. Final SEPs Policy, supra note 90, at 24802. Further, a violator may not transfer this liability to the contractor or consultant that it retains to help it to imple- ment a SEP, if it does so. Id. Interestingly, the Final SEPs Policy also provides that a viola- tor should pay stipulated damages if it completes the SEP for less money than estimated. Specifically, if the SEP costs less than ninety percent of the estimated cost, the violator must pay between ten and twenty-five percent of the original mitigation awarded percent. Id. at 24,803. 164. EPA currently expects a violator to propose a particular SEP, rather than do so itself. Bonorris et al., supra note 95, at 213; Kristi, supra note 96, at 40; U.S. Environ- mental Protection Agency, Interim Revised EPA Supplemental Environmental Projects Policy, 60 Fed. Reg. 24858 (May 10, 1995). Some states follow this approach while others do not. Bonorris et al., supra note 95, at n.209 &amp; 210. EPA officials informed me that EPA may provide suggestions for a SEP if a violator asks. In addition, as noted above, EPA's website includes a list of potential projects, and EPA staff often direct alleged violators to that website. EPA may also encourage an alleged violator to reach out to community groups, who may have ideas for projects that could be considered as a SEP. E-mail from Beth Cavalier, supra note 104. 165. Separation of powers concerns have motivated some governments to follow this approach. The concern is that the administrator otherwise might implement "her own pro- grammatic agenda under the guise of environmental enforcement." See Bonorris et al., su- pra note 95, at 213. 166. See e.g., EPA, Community Involvement Guidance, supra note 138, at 35,887; Bon- orris et al., supra note 95, at 213, 214 (regarding state initiatives of this sort and identifying</page><page sequence="43">Spring, 2007] THINKING INSIDE THE BOX 591 of the effectiveness of these initial steps, and of the opportunity to improve upon these actions by doing more to inform regulated par- ties of the types of SEPs that would be acceptable in particular in- stances. Further, it would be worthwhile to explore the extent to which putting EPA staff in a reactive position, rather than allow- ing them to identify SEPs they believe would be particularly use- ful, dampens EPA staffs', and regulated parties', enthusiasm for SEPs.167 A second issue, which concerns both process and substance, in- volves the extent to which EPA Headquarters has sent its staff a "mixed message" in terms of the enthusiasm they should have in pursuing SEPs. Perhaps somewhat paradoxically, in addition to its expressions of encouragement to Regional staff to pursue SEPs, EPA Headquarters also has issued a variety of memoranda that would seem to have the opposite effect. In particular, EPA has sent out what Regional staff would likely consider to be mixed sig- nals by: 1) cautioning Regional staff that they should consult with Headquarters personnel before approving a SEP if there is any question concerning nexus; and 2) warning staff that they face dismissal and sanctions if they approve a SEP inappropriately.168 The practical consequence of this direction, given the apparent considerable confusion that exists about the definition of nexus, 169 Delaware, Maine, and Illinois as having created SEP libraries); Suarez, Expanding Use, supra note 103, at 1 (discussing the "piloting [of] a SEP library which will serve as a clear- inghouse for possible SEPs."). 167. There are procedural justice as well as distributive justice issues associated with the identification, review, and approval of SEPs, and one question is whether the current process is structured appropriately in terms of each of these sets of issues. See David L. Markell, Understanding Citizen Perspective on Government Decision Making Processes as a Way to Improve the Administrative State , 36 Envtl. L. 651 (2006) for a review of procedural and distributive justice. 168. Smith, Importance of the Nexus, supra note 123, at 2 (citing 31 U.S.C. § 3302(d)). The opening sentence provides that "[t]he purpose of this memo is to emphasize the impor- tance of nexus in evaluating proposed [SEPs]" and it indicates that nexus is importance to "avoid[ ] problems related to the Miscellaneous Receipts Act (MRA)." Id. at 1. EPA indicates that the MRA requires that an EPA "official that receives money for the Government from any source shall deposit the money in the Treasury . . . ." Id. at 2 (citing 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b)). The memorandum also notes that penalties for violating the MRA include removal from office and personal liability for the amount of money misappropriated. Id. (citing 31 U.S.C. § 3302(d)). Professor Kristi takes the position that "elimination or substantial relaxa- tion of the nexus requirement would create significant opportunities for increasing SEP utilization." Kristi, supra note 96, at 3. In Kristl's view, the EPA/DO J fixation on nexus as a way to minimize EPA's problematic legal authority to negotiate SEPs is misplaced; he ar- gues that the "nexus requirement" is "not legally justified." Id. at 3, 24. 169. EPA Headquarters noted in memos in 2002 and 2003 that there was considerable confusion about the definition of nexus. In a 2003 memo EPA indicated that several Regional and Headquarters offices raised questions about the complexity of the existing SEP Policy. Specifically, we heard a number of questions concerning how to define an appropriate nexus in certain situations, and whether or not nexus can be waived in particular cir-</page><page sequence="44">592 JOURNAL OF LAND USE [Vol. 22.2 is that Regional staff are likely to favor consultations in a substan- tial number of cases where SEPs might be in play. EPA includes a list of "action items" in its June 2003 SEPs Guidance that identify steps the Agency committed to take to ef- fect improvements in the SEPs policy. The Agency, while reaffirm- ing that nexus is "important to ensure compliance with the MRA and . . . cannot be waived," also indicated that EPA believed that "there may be ways to simplify nexus, and still ensure that there remains a connection between the underlying violation and the SEP."170 While the Agency indicated in 2003 that it was "launch- ing an effort to simplify the SEP Policy,"171 in a recent article Pro- fessor Kenneth Kristi refers to EPA's current guidance on nexus as "a kind of 'we know it when we see it' platitude."172 He indicates that, while "as of 2003, the agency knew that the nexus issue con- tinued to create internal issues and that further clarification was necessary-though so far it has not issued such a clarification."173 Professor Kristi continues: "In lieu of providing guidance on how to deal with such circumstances [when nexus is not clear], the memo- randum in effect takes the decision out of the hands of enforcement personnel and puts it squarely within USEPA headquarters."174 cumstances .... Given this ... we believe that there may be ways to simplify nexus. . . ." Suarez, Expanding Use, supra note 103, at 3. A 2002 EPA Memorandum similarly reflected EPA Headquarters' awareness that the nexus requirement was a source of confusion for staff with the front lines capacity to negotiate SEPs, noting that Headquarters "continues to receive many inquiries from enforcement staff regarding nexus in reviewing proposed SEPs." Smith, Importance of the Nexus, supra note 123, at 1. 170. Id. at 3. 171. Suarez, Expanding Use, supra note 103, at 2. 172. Kristi, supra note 96, at 240. 173. Id. at 245. 174. Id. at 241. I reviewed the entire list of SEPs Memoranda, Policies, and Guidance to try to determine the approval process EPA uses. The only documents that I found that are relevant are the April 1998 Final SEPs Policy itself, and a July 21, 1998 Memorandum from Eric Schaeffer, then Director of EPA's Office of Regulatory Enforcement, entitled Re- vised Approval Procedures for Supplemental Environmental Projects (July 21, 1998). The July 21, 1998 memorandum indicates that SEPs that do not meet all of the legal guidelines "may require Assistant Administrator approval" and will require a legal analysis from the relevant staff explaining why the project is within EPA's legal authority. Further, all pro- jects that "may not fully comply" with the SEPs Policy "must be approved" by the OECA Assistant Administrator. For "other" projects, the appropriate OECA official has approval authority, with consultation by the Special Litigation and Projects Division, unless other- wise delegated. Otherwise, per the April 1998 Policy, "the authority of a government official to approve a SEP is included in the official's authority to settle an enforcement case and thus, subject to the exceptions set forth here, no special approvals are required." April 1998 Final SEPs Policy, supra note 90, at 20 (section J). EPA officials advised me that the major- ity of SEPs do not need Headquarters approval. They indicated that only two categories of SEPs need approval from the media-specific enforcement division director in Headquarters: Compliance Promotion SEPs and Other SEPs and this is usually done quickly, and is not a burdensome process. In addition, a settlement may need approval from the AA for OECA if</page><page sequence="45">Spring, 2007] THINKING INSIDE THE BOX 593 His pessimistic conclusion is that EPA's more recent memoranda on SEPs "likely result[ ] in eliminating nexus as a useful policy concept that can guide Agency staff or defendants seeking to con- duct SEPs because it is difficult to tell just what is needed to sat- isfy the nexus requirement."175 Headquarters' cautionary notes to the Regions about SEPs seem to be worth investigating further for their possible impact on regional interest in negotiating SEPs. These memos raise a con- ventional "efficacy of delegation" issue.176 Part of the answer to this question lies in the empirical data, which has not been com- piled to my knowledge - questions concerning the number of cases in which the Regions have negotiated SEPs without Headquarters input compared to the number of cases in which the Regions sought such input; the level of effort required to solicit and obtain Headquarters "sign-off' on SEPs projects (e.g., the number of peo- ple to be contacted and the number of approvals required, the level of effort needed to initiate and complete such contacts, the amount and length of time it took to pursue this consultation process, etc.); and the results of consultations with Headquarters (e.g., the num- ber of cases in which SEPs were ultimately negotiated, the number of situations in which SEPs were significantly modified, the num- ber of cases in which SEPs fell through, etc.). Intuitively, it would seem that the greater the transaction costs associated with obtain- ing "sign-off' or pursuing other consultations, and the less likely the consultations are to pay dividends, the less likely a regional official would be to bother. Thus, it seemingly would be worth- while to try to assess the costs these signals engendered and, if the costs appear to be significant, it would seem to be worthwhile to consider alternative delegation structures that might yield a more effective balancing of concerns about possible Regional missteps with the desire to encourage the Regions to pursue SEPs. Professor Kristl's conclusion appears to be that, conceptually, it is logical to assume that EPA's cautionary notes have led EPA offi- cials to play it safe and not be overly ambitious in pursuing possi- ble SEPs: Without clear guidance on what nexus really is, Agency personnel and defendants are likely to 'play it safe' and choose projects that have been approved the minimum penalty requirement is not met; again, this is not usually a lengthy process.

See Markell, Slack , supra note 26, at 21.</page><page sequence="46">594 JOURNAL OF LAND USE [Vol. 22.2 before or simply avoid SEPs altogether instead of exploring new ways of utilizing SEPs that might in fact be at the outer limits of nexus. 177 His further view is that the empirical data on SEPs support this perspective. These data show a "steady decline" in the actual number of SEPs and in "annual SEP utilization rates" after 1995, which is when EPA issued an earlier version of its SEPs Policy that included an "emphasis on nexus and lowered the mitigation percentage ceiling from 100% to 80%."178 He contends that these data "strongly suggest that a link between these policy changes and the SEP utilization declines is more than simply coinciden- tal."179 EPA officials from whom I sought input offered a different per- spective: It is not accurate to look at the numbers of SEPs without also considering the number of enforcement cases concluded each year, as SEPs cannot occur in the absence of an enforcement action. The number of enforcement actions concluded each year varies. The percentage of settlements each year that include a SEP has remained constant at approximately 9- 10% over the past several years. The data does not support the conclusion that there has been a decline in the inclusion of SEPs in settlements.180 In either case - a decline in SEPs as Kristi suggests, or a rela- tively stable level of use, as EPA contends - the type of data- gathering effort I suggest above might yield insights about why SEPs use has not increased, despite Headquarters encouragement 177. Kristi, supra note 96, at 19. 178. Id. at 23-24. 179. Id. at 24. Kristi suggests that relaxing or eliminating nexus requirements would enable EPA to approve a wider variety of SEP projects. He suggests that the nexus re- quirement creates limits on aggregation of SEPs based on factors such as geography and time that, if relaxed, would create a "more hospitable environment for SEPs and the bene- fits they can produce. . . ." Id. at 36. The Hastings Report, in contrast, concluded that legal doctrine supports a nexus requirement and recommends that states include a variant of nexus in their policies. Bonorris et al., supra note 95, at 188. The Hastings Report also indi- cates that: "Most state environmental protection agencies find themselves in the same posi- tion as EPA, fashioning settlements not expressly authorized by their legislatures. PLRI has uncovered no state court case finding that a state environmental agency overstepped its statutory authority in implementing SEPs." Id. at 195. The Hastings Report also indicates that "PLRI research indicates that no court has ever invalidated an EPA-approved settle- ment with a SEP." Id. at 196. 180.

One fix to at least some of these issues that would likely in- crease SEPs use significantly would be for Congress specifically to empower EPA to negotiate SEPs. EPA has developed many of the administrative constraints it has created for SEPs because of con- cerns about the agency's legal authority to pursue SEPs.181 Clear Congressional endorsement for SEPs would alleviate these con- cerns and, depending on Congress's direction, might be a signifi- cant inducement for more aggressive agency pursuit of such pro- jects. 182 2. Revising the incentives for regulated parties to agree to con- duct SEPs. One way to increase regulated parties' incentives to pursue SEPs is for EPA to increase the financial benefit violators reap by doing so. One possibility in this arena is for EPA to reduce penalties by one hundred percent of the cost of the SEP project, rather than limit the reduction to eighty percent of the project's cost, as is currently the case.183 In other words, rather than give a violator at most a $0.80 reduction in penalty for a $1.00 SEP, EPA should give the violator a full $1.00 reduction. Professor Kristi, urging such a change in his recent article, criticizes the "clear 'sec- ond rate' status that dollars spent on SEPs suffer" under EPA's SEP policies.184 He argues that this eighty percent limitation in mitigation is "neither legally nor economically justified," and that "allowing dollar-for-dollar penalty reductions would create signifi- cant opportunities for increasing SEP utilization."185 Kristi con- tends that raising the mitigation percentage to one hundred per- cent (and abolishing nexus, as discussed above) are "simple, legally justifiable steps that will unshackle SEPs and allow the maximum environmental benefits possible."186 To date, EPA has concluded 181. Kristi, supra note 96, at 25-26. 182. Commentators have suggested that only the CAA specifically provides for SEPs. Kristi, supra note 96, at 25 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 7604(g)(2) which allows a court to order that civil penalties be used in beneficial mitigation projects rather than be deposited in the U.S. Treasury). See also Nicholas Targ et al., The Possibility of SEP Legislation and Lessons from the Fifty States , TRENDS (ABA-SEER), July/August 2007, at 4. 183. EPA considers the after- tax cost of the SEP in order to prevent a violator from benefiting twice. As a result, the defendant should not get economic value for doing a SEP that should raise the value of a SEP dollar. Kristi, supra note 96, at 37. See also, Final SEPs Policy, supra note 90, at 24801. Other possible reasons to discount SEP dollars in- clude: 1) the possibility that a violator reaps a public relations benefit from a SEP; and 2) SEPs have less deterrent effect than penalties.

Revising EPA's measures for evaluating enforcement per- formance to create greater incentives for Regional Staff to encour- age SEPs. Other changes that might be effective in encouraging SEPs go beyond the world of SEPs. One such change involves the measures EPA uses to evaluate enforcement performance. EPA traditionally has used "output" measures as one indicator of en- forcement performance - e.g., the number of inspections con- ducted each year, or the number of cases brought in a particular year. To the extent that EPA staff are evaluated based on these sorts of "beans," or activity measures, such measures seem to have the potential to create disincentives for staff to pursue time- consuming projects, including SEPs. This is not necessarily the case, of course. An appropriately calibrated weighting system might give a Regional official or office more credit for a time- consuming project (like a SEP) than for a less time-consuming one (such as a "simple" penalty case). The question is whether current measures, and the weight attached to them, may create manage- ment-based disincentives to undertake particularly environmen- tally valuable work, including negotiating SEPs that yield espe- cially useful results. Research into EPA's current performance measures would be helpful in determining the extent to which per- formance measures serve to discourage (or encourage) EPA staff to pursue SEPs. 4. Expanding EPA's administrative enforcement authority. A final set of possible actions that might encourage SEPs would in- volve an expansion of EPA's administrative enforcement authority. EPA's SEPs Coordinators indicate that most SEPs are negotiated in the context of administrative rather than judicial settlements.188 On the one hand, this is not surprising since EPA brings many more administrative than judicial cases.189 Further, steering a proposed SEP through multiple agency bureaucracies may well entail increased transaction costs.190 On the other hand, because some of EPA's statutes allow for more limited penalties in the administrative setting than in judi- 187.

EPA and DOJ both typically would need to sign-off on a judicial settlement, while only EPA would typically sign-off on an administrative settlement.</page><page sequence="49">Spring, 2007] THINKING INSIDE THE BOX 597 cial enforcement,191 there are a variety of reasons why one might expect SEPs to be particularly promising in cases that EPA cur- rently lacks jurisdiction to settle. Judicial cases are likely to be the more significant cases that warrant higher penalties, and therefore are more likely to involve environmental harm. Further, the higher penalties available in judicial cases seemingly would give EPA more leverage to reduce penalties in exchange for per- formance of a SEP. One option is for Congress to increase EPA's administrative penalty authorities. Congress has made legislative changes of this sort (increasing penalty authorities, including administrative pen- alties) as it has amended the major regulatory statutes over the past twenty years. Congress initially did not provide administra- tive penalty authority in the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, for example.192 It only created such authorities in later iterations of these laws.193 For the Clean Air Act, Congress first established administrative penalty authority in its 1990 Amendments to that Act.194 One option is for Congress to adopt in the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts its RCRA model, by eliminating the artificial limits it has included in the former two statutes on administrative penalties vis-à-vis civil penalties.195 VI. Conclusions Ecosystems provide enormously important services to our spe- cies, in addition to the non-anthropomorphic benefits they pro- duce.196 Yet, many knowledgeable scholars have complained that we have failed to design systems of governance that recognize this reality or devote sufficient attention to understanding or protect- ing the services ecosystems provide.

Thus, a focus solely on such services risks un- der-valuing these natural resources and poses a challenge for those interested in preserving such resources for other reasons. The question of how best to approach this challenge is a critical one, but it is beyond the scope of this article.</page><page sequence="50">598 JOURNAL OF LAND USE [Vol. 22.2 under-value these services quite substantially and, as a result, we squander them in various ways. In the world of ecosystems and the services they provide, igno- rance is unlikely to be bliss. Instead, it is a recipe for ill-informed market-place decisions and for ill-informed policy choices that lead to under-protection of our natural environment. There are numer- ous strategies for learning more about the threats that human ac- tivity poses to ecosystems and their services and for enhancing protection of such systems and restoration of systems that have sustained harm. Market-based approaches offer considerable promise,197 as do new or refined regulatory regimes. In this effort to consider these questions in the context of regulatory enforce- ment, my tentative conclusion is that, at both the conceptual level and in the real world, enforcement has promise to serve as an ef- fective tool to help us improve our understanding of ecosystems and the services they provide, and to aid in protecting and restor- ing such ecosystems and services. In addition to suggesting some possible regulatory fixes myself to advance the goal of more effec- tive protection of ecosystems and the services they provide, this article is intended to serve as a challenge to regulatory aficionados and experts in various types of ecosystems to consider how best to structure and use these enforcement tools (and compliance promo- tion more generally) to achieve this important public policy objec- tive. 197.
