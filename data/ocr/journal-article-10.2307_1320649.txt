An examination of the literature of pedagogical methods of art criticism leads to a perception that there is a split between those which emphasize intellectual analysis at the expense of intuition, and those that stress intuition at the expense of systematic analysis. The following method, beginning from a base which structurally resembles the Feldman (1987) and Mittler (1980) genre, attempts to reconcile intuitive and analytic thinking by systematically incorporating the affective and intuitive into all stages of an analytic, pedagogically specific methodology. Introduction Art criticism, while it may be a philosophically contested concept (Geahigan, 1983) in a practical sense may simply be defined as the linguistic exploration of artworks, or talk about art (Feldman, 1970). Art criticism is driven by various individual percep- tions, world views, mores, and values. Conceivably there are as many effective methods of art criticism as there are reasons for critiquing. Much of the confusion and debate about the merits of various methods of art criticism may be seen as a lack of clarity about the underlying reasons for critiquing which are held as values within the structures of those systems. With this in mind, it should be made clear that the fundamental reason for the development of the following method is to systematically incorporate the intuitive and affective with the intellectual and analytic components of seeing and understanding works of art. The premises of such a systematization include Arnheim's (1986) notion that intuition and intellect are two inextricably interdependent and foundational cognitive procedures, and Broudy's (1972) conception that "aesthetic experience is based on a compound of imagination and perception" (p. 28). Premises of the Method There seems to be a polarity in pedagogical criticism with many rationally weighted methods on one end of the spectrum and a couple of intuitively weighted methods on the other.1 Rather than allowing either intuitive and affective or intellectual and analytic procedures to dominate, the following method incorporates both types of cognition integrally into all stages of the critical process. Through the process of learning this method students should develop a balanced approach to understanding art works. It is also a goal that they may become "affectionately knowledgeable about art" (Lanier, 1980). They should come to understand art as a formal system as well as in the context of the roles it plays in expressing the human condition. Although the following method is fairly prescriptive, one caution is in order. It should be obvious to most casual observers that what really happens in art criticism cannot be reduced to a formula. It cannot be reduced to an abstraction based on various stages of perceptually cognitive, reflective, and imaginative activities. What really happens in art criticism relies heavily on that flash of insight based on gut feelings, life experiences, and perceptual information coming together just right. Yet, having said this, it must also be stressed that it is good to have conceptual structures on which</page><page sequence="2">A STRUCTURE ... to base inquiry. If the living substance of art criticism forms in that place where careful observation and the leap of the imagination come together, then the platform for such a leap should be carefully constructed, especially for pedagogical purposes. General guidelines include some basic suggestions about the viewer's attitude and assumptions. The student critics should approach a work with a sort of controlled "stream-of-consciousness" (James, 1966) attitude, in which varying kinds of mental activities dominate at certain times. Thus they should avoid pedantic categorical consideration of the work. Instead they should allow for intuitive insight at any point which should then be held for application at the right time or be used to help redirect the pervasive evolving quality of the critique. This model moves from a highly intuitive, general, fairly vague, and simple first response, which serves as a tentative hypothesis, to a complex, rich, and in-depth response. It moves through several stages involving an attempt to understand the initial response, allowing for the continual internal alteration of the hypothesis in light of additional, inconsistent discrepant information. It is assumed the percipients have self- selected intents to understand both their own reactions and the artworks as transmis- sions of human aesthetic sensibility throughout the critical examination. The stages move from what Marantz (1965) calls the analytic to the synthetic, from finding what has gone into the work to what the individual gets out of it. Pedagogical specificity as suggested by Hamblen (1984, 1986) is addressed in a concise delineation of the critical structure rather than in terms of student-teacher behaviors. The dynamics of actual classroom instruction, with the teacher acting as a moderator between the students and the work, demand that the model be flexible and conceptually clear as well as instructionally specific. The method developed here has seven stages which are discrete operations prac- ticed independently and serially, but which are functionally interdependent in the development of meaning and significance in viewing a work. The stages are: 1) reaction; then three related stages of perceptual analysis, including 2) representation, 3) formal analysis, and 4) formal characterization; 5) then personal interpretation; 6) contextual examination; and 7) synthesis. It is assumed that subjective qualities will be allowed for throughout the critical process since these are a natural part of cognition. However, different types of cognitive functioning will dominate the process at different times. In order, these modes are responsive (stage 1), analytic (stages 2, 3,4, and 6), inventive (stage 5), and synthetic modes (stage 7). In addition, stage 6 relies primarily on genetic inquiry (Beardsley, 1966). Genetic inquiry tells us about a work from sources external to its forms, where it came from, when it was made, the process of its making and the cultural and historical influences on its form. Incorporation of this external/contextual information presumes that criticism is informed judgement. Its placement in this method (6th stage) presumes that external information should not precede personal experience with an art object so the weight of expert opinion will not smother the vital spark of personal encounter (Taylor, 1981). Reaction The first stage is Reaction. This is a strongly intuitive and affective response to the work of art. The first and most fundamental question of this first stage of Reaction is, "How does this work of art make me feel? Although a professional critic may assess art works in an almost emotionless way to determine their pecuniary value or historical place, such criticism is not desirable for pedagogical purposes. The premises of beginning with acknowledgment of feelings in encountering a work include the notion that cognition is reflection on sensation (Carroll, 1984; Locke, 1970; Koffa [in Pastore], 1971), that one constantly interprets 29</page><page sequence="3">TOM ANDERSON what is seen while seeing it (Arnheim 1969), and that intuition plays a large role in making sense, or making a "wholeness" of the field observed (Amheim, 1986). If the object under observation is a work of art the primary realm of which is the objectifi- cation of the subjective or inner reality (Feinstein, 1982; Langer, 1942/1980; Rand, 1971), then it seems reasonable that perceptual cognition will focus initially on the affective ambience projected upon and by the forms in the work of art. This approach is sustained by Neisser's contention that the first stage in attention of any kind is pre- attentive emotive response (Neisser [in Kneller], 1984). This global, intuitive, emotive response has been defined by Dewey (1958) in reference to the critical perception of artworks as an initial judgment. Functionally this means students should be encouraged to express how an image makes them feel more so than what they think an image means. They should also be instructed to avoid the words "good" and "bad" in expressing themselves since normative judgments are premature at this point. Students may refer to aspects of the imagery in making this very brief statement. This initial response then serves as a guide for anaylsis and interpretation: first comes the reaction, then comes the need to find what caused it. A second pedagogical benefit is that in acknowledging that they do have a reaction students are making an initial commitment to an image. This psychological commit- ment is mandatory in establishing empathy for an image that is necessary to interpret it meaningfully (Chapman, 1977; Dewey, 1958). This empathy becomes increasingly important as thinking processes become more complex and demanding (Hamblen, 1984). Art criticism is an inventive process. Inventive processes spring from desire. Therefore, from this perspective, it is extremely important to make an initial emotive commitment to an image. A practical technique which facilitates psychological commitment to an image in pedagogical situations is to display a wide variety of artworks or reproductions. Students should be encouraged to look at and enjoy these works. After a few minutes each student chooses one work that is appealing or that has made a strong impression in some way. The instructor's guiding question in relation to these images should be "How does it make you feel?" Perceptual Analysis To have a feeling and not to know it is not to have it. To think about a feeling is to know it. (Eisner, 1985, p. 143) The next question, then, is "Why does it make you feel that way?" Pepper (1945) states that in art criticism one is seeking the convergence of visual facts which may only be attained through the venturing of an initial hypothesis. Analysis begins with an anticipatory categorizing which provides lead time for adjusting one's responses to the art object in question. This is a future-oriented behavior that Bruner sees as the first stage of learning (Bigge, 1982). If the visual evidence is in tune with the initial reaction it continues to become more clearly defined and elaborated. But examiners must be excruciatingly honest in collecting visual evidence, for if it does not fit the initial reaction the hypothesis must be changed in the face of new information which does not support previous categorical ventures (Merleau-Ponty, 1962). In analysis, tentative interpretations which rise in the mind are continually being tested, at least sublimi- nally, to see if they fit the established, pervasive quality. Perceptual analysis consists of three distinct operations which move from more obvious and concrete discriminations to increasingly abstract and subtle discrimina- tions of the symbolic and formal qualities of an artwork. Discrimination should begin with the most certain to be agreed upon facts and then proceed to the more interpretive 30</page><page sequence="4">A STRUCTURE ... and debatable (Smith, 1968). It should go from the simple to the complex, and from single elements to relationships among forms. The student critic should begin with the forms themselves, including their obvious symbolic substance, and then increasingly commit to determining the nature of the forms being discussed. At the point where it is almost exclusively the nature of the forms that is being discussed one has entered the realm of interpretation, in that one is no longer talking primarily about form, but about meaning (Kaelin,1981). While the point of initially articulating a reaction is to illuminate how the work makes one feel, the point of Analysis is the collection of evidence which tells us why, and which alters, sharpens, and deepens that original perception to the point where fully mature interpretation is possible. Feldman (1987) proposes that Description and Analysis should be objective and value free. However, it must be remembered that one can only make determinations of perceptual significance in the context of the emergent act of the critical process, arising from the conjunction of the qualities of the image in the outer, so-called objective, world and those inner qualities brought to that image by the critic (James, 1966; Dewey, 1958; Gurwitsch, 1964; Heidegger [in Kneller], 1984; Lankford, 1984; Pastore, 1971). Memory and association, knowledge and belief cannot help but enter into the selective act of perception (Arnheim, 1969, 1986). This selective act relies on pre-existing internal visual images for guidance in understanding what is being perceived (Arnheim, 1986; Nadaner, 1984). Further, there must be an "alternation between perception and reflection" (Burgin, 1986, p. 16) since perception is held within cognition. Finally, meaning arises in continual associative reference to that which is being critically examimed (Amheim, 1969; Kaelin, 1972; Lankford, 1984). In short, it is the nature of the visual aesthetic image never to be restricted to one discursive and agreed upon quality or meaning (Amheim, 1986; Langer, 1942/1980). Representation: First Operation of Perceptual Analysis At the stage of Representation, the observers should articulate the work's most obvious thematic and formal qualities, paying particular attention to those they suspect have a significant bearing on the initial Reaction. The acknowledged subjective motive is to search for the objective causes, in the work, of that reaction. In addition to driving and informing the search for objectively observable qualities, this incorporation of a pervasive subjective quality is also a safeguard against the mechanical enumeration of visual qualities which often passes for description and which ultimately leads to lifeless and shallow interpretations of art works. On the other hand, to adjust for perceptive subjectivity, a well-structured and thorough discrimination of the work's qualities must be accomplished before giving attention to predominantly interpretive functioning. Every attempt should be made to complete an inventory before developed interpretive theories are posited since inter- pretive ventures, at this stage, interrupt the representation of evidence, which is a crucial foundational task. According to Dewey (1958), "artistic criticism is always determined by the quality of first hand perception" (p. 298). Functionally, Representation is a careful accounting of the obvious symbolic (cognitive and denotative) and formal qualities of a work of art, beginning first with those qualities that interest selects and proceeding to those less immediately striking. Students should begin with general statements of obvious thematic content and then work to the specifics of detail and form. In examining Escher's Sky and Water, for example, a student might begin with something like, "This is a picture of birds and fish metamorphosing into each other," rather then beginning with details of textural quality. The subject matter of a work must be considered, at the very least, as something the artist thought was worth representing. Whether it is Marc's Blue Horses or Botticelli's 31</page><page sequence="5">TOM ANDERSON Venus, the subject matter is of significance simply because it does exist. Likewise, it is of significance that some artists chose not to represent denotative images. In the absence of representational forms an image might be described in terms of its formal qualities. A Gottlieb painting might be described as blue and red circular shapes above twisting thick black lines on a neutral background, rather than as two suns in the sky above a tangled Earth. If the work is very abstract but not nonobjective it is better to venture a guess than to describe it as having no denotative content. Thematic content, if it exists, is always significant for expressing meaning. Munro (1941) explains that it is better to "start by erring on the side of indiscriminateness rather than exclusive- ness" (p. 340). The title of a work should also be acknowledged in Representation since it often sheds light on what the artist sought to represent. Since evidence collected is not impersonal, the collection of evidence requires self- honesty and the flexibility to change one's impression and go where the evidence leads. The student critic must allow for the intuitive inferential leap to come about at any point during the stockpiling of information, and must allow such leaps to influence further examination. Pepper (1945) explains that the appeal of the aesthetic is based upon intuitive certainties such as emotion and sensation, yet these aesthetic facts must be in balance with corroboration from objective physical facts. These facts change as intent and perception change. To fail to change one's driving speed when coming to a curve results in going off the road. Formal Analysis: Second Operation of Perceptual Analysis Formal Analysis is the critical examination of the technique(s) and formal qualities contained within an art work, with special emphasis being placed on the relationship among those qualities. The search for visual evidence must assume that marks, movements, colors, and relationships are intentional and have expressive significance. Whether an artist is deliberate as with a Harnet still life or intuitive and semi-automatic as with Jackson Pollock or Robert Motherwell, artists use visual forms to create, construct, recreate, or reconstruct some aspect of their understood reality. Whether that psycho-epistemological process (Rand, 1971) consists of the seen and experienced, the felt and unseen, the intuited, or some combination of all of these, the artist intends a cohesive, interrelated statement using the raw materials of visual form. So the perceiver must attempt to impart meaning to these forms in the same holistic spirit in which they were constructed. The point to tell to students is that art works are all of a piece. There are no parts in an art work that do not count; all forms and relations have expressive significance. In this context, the next question is, "What strikes you asformally significant in the work?" Again, since personal interest guides perception, students should not be looking for every formal quality randomly and exhaustively, but only for those most salient clues suggested by interest. A beginning assumption is that relationships in a work form patterns, and that within the pattern lies the stylistic significance of the work. Students should assume that the pattern as a whole has an artistic purpose. The final goal is to see the pattern, then to see its parts and how they contribute to the whole and ultimately to the thematic content and overall expressive purpose of the work. Students should look for formal units which are distinguishable from one another but which all belong together in some larger sense. They should be seeking internal relationships and "right" relationships between forms (Pepper, 1945). Students should be attuned to divergences, places where the work flows, ripples, stops, squats, flexes, backs up, tenses, threatens to break into some other pattern. These are the points of significance. A useful tool is to use comparison and contrast. One should be making ever more 32</page><page sequence="6">A STRUCTURE ... subtle discriminations between one quality and another all the while mentally testing how each discrimination fits with the developing hypothesis/driving pervasive quality. Students should test impressions initiated by form against others initiated by other forms to establish an internal verity within the work. It is effective at this point to use varying principles of design such as unity, variety, balance, and so on, as conceptual tools giving students clues about significance in the work. Other potentially helpful visual concepts are proximity, similarity, direction, closure, motion, and implied motion. Each concept might be tried to see if it fits the situation, used if it does, and discarded if it does not. Formal Analysis is perceptual organization. In Formal Analysis, the student attempts to make visual sense of the forms presented. Students should be looking for visual structure, visual groupings, visual emphasis, visual sense. Such analysis de- mands a deepening attention to the nature of the compositional arrangement evolving from those qualities first noted in the stage of representation, and leads to features and relationships not previously noted. Formal Characterization Students might next ask, "What is the point of the formal structure? What is the intended impact on my emotions? Am I meant to feel harmony, explosiveness, abandon, agitation, or what? Is the work calmly symmetrical or actively asymmetri- cal?" We pin our emotions to an art work's formal character in the relationship of the vehicle and the stated or thematic content. According to Ayn Rand (1971), "the theme of an art work is the link uniting its subject and style" (p.40). Here, students try to grasp a work's style. Style is art's most revealing and aesthetically significant element. Subject matter is what an artist considers important to be treated. Style is how that artist feels about it. The expressive content of a work is embodied in its forms, and the nature of the forms mark the nature of the expression (Taylor, 1981). Formal Characterization, then, deals not with subject matter or formal qualities themselves, but with tertiary qualities (Santayana, 1896; Kohler, 1969), that is, the forms' expressive nature. This is of primary import in understanding aesthetic response. Kohler (1969) suggests that these tertiary qualities are retained in the mind long after the concrete qualities which contribute to them have faded. One remembers the ominous turbulence in El Greco's Sky Over Toledo long after the specific formal qualities of the clouds have faded. A problem for many students is knowing when they have finished analyzing and have begun interpreting (Beardsley, 1982). To describe the foreboding orange in Duccio's Betrayal of Christ or distorted lustful abandon in Nolde's St. Mary of Egypt Among the Sinners proves a real problem when talk must be either analytic or interpretive. Clements (1979) suggests a need to bridge inductive and interpretive functions in art criticism by ascribing human and other characteristics to form. Formal Characterization, in allowing for cognitively hybrid statements, fills this need. It serves as a bridge from the predominantly analytic early stages of criticism to the predomi- nantly inventive/interpretive later stages by incorporating both properties. The proper role of formal characterization is inventive analysis. It is interpretation of the character of formal qualities. It sets the mood, the timbre, for interpretation. At this stage, statements by varying perceivers may become more divergent. Characterization relies heavily on one's past experiences and general world view. A Wesselman nude may be characterized as depersonalized sensuousness, eroticism, or licentiousness, depending on the viewer's preconceptions and propensities. Therefore, teachers should allow for individual and varying student responses. Techniques for approaching formal characterization include metaphor, mimesis, 33</page><page sequence="7">TOM ANDERSON and anthropomorphism. Metaphor is a structure which attributes the characteristics of one entity to another (Feinstein, 1982). Much of art is visual metaphor which may often be most easily approached through an equivalent linguistic structure. For example, Karel Appel's Angry Landscape might be described as blasting heads of fire. A characterization technique suggested by Feldman (1987) is mimesis. Mimesis is suggesting what a form reminds one of or makes one feel like. This technique is an especially effective bridge to interpretation in nonobjective art works. For example, Mondrian's Broadway Boogie Woogie, seen as syncopated light blips moving in a gridlock, sets the stage very well for mature interpretation. Another tool is anthropomorphism, that is, ascribing human qualities to nonhuman forms, in this case, colors, textures, and so on. Thus, upright, thick lines might be bold; slender lines in the corer of a format might be timid; and so on. In anthropomorphi- cally examining, for example, Pollack'sLavender Mist, one might say that it swings and moves and jerks and stops like dancing. Also at the conclusion of the stage of Formal Characterization students may focus on stylistic categorization. Characterization should provide evidence for categoriza- tion which reveals aspects of the work that may otherwise remain hidden. If a work is found to have exaggerated and active forms which ignore local color in favor of arbitrary color, one may fairly confidently predict that it is expressionistic in intent and so on. Categorical systems may be as broad as realist, formalist, expressionist, fantastic (Feldman, 1987; Chapman, 1977), and instrumental (Feldman, 1981), or as specific as Abstract Expressionism, Process Art, or Impressionism. Ultimately, Formal Characterization concerns itself with how the formal qualities of a work come together stylistically to fund the pervasive quality which has been building in the student's mind. It is a transitional stage between predominantly objective analysis and projective interpretation. It is an imaginatively based analysis of formal qualities grounded in one's own world view and past experience, and it serves as a primary funding source of the next stage: Interpretation. Interpretation Interpretation is thinking with feeling and feeling one's thoughts in relation to the work's expressive content. The task of the initial stages of criticism is to prepare the viewer for Interpretation, which is the heart of the critical process. Mature Interpreta- tion tells us what the work means at the elemental level as an aesthetically emotional experience. The meaning students find may or may not be that intended by the artist. Interpre- tation brings the information of analysis as well as the viewer's life experiences to bear in developing an expressive meaning stimulated within them by the work of art. The chance of all these factors being in exact conjunction with the artist's projection are practically nil. Yet that does not invalidate the viewer's personal response. In discuss- ing Guernica, George Kneller (1984) states that to reduce the painting to a given specific truth, a particular meaning such as "war is hell," trivializes it. Rather than stating a proposition, Picasso was representing a catastrophe that leads us to our own conclusions. " If certain conditions are met during the interpretive process, a thousand different sentiments ["polysemy," (Olsen, 1983)] excited by the same object are all right" (Hume [in Carroll], 1984, p. 182.) Among these conditions is the requirement that Interpretation avoid free associa- tion. Every interpretive statement should be guided by the fully developed driving pervasive quality and funded by the objective visual facts contained within the work. If Interpretation is not referenced to visual properties, discourse leaves the realm of criticism and becomes conjecture, therapy, reminiscence, or some other manner of 34</page><page sequence="8">A STRUCTURE ... purely subjective functioning. Interpretation is the application of creative insight to the assimilation of perceptual facts, the analysis of various technical processes involved, the awareness of relations and previous learning. As such, careful adherence to observable qualities gives a common basis for consideration and is the main safeguard ensuring that one's interpretation will at least be understandable if not acceptable to others. Interpretation should make full use of mimesis, imitation, symbolic language, common associations, and references to life experience. Students should use as rich and as fully developed language as they have to convey the mature emotional and cognitive meaning evoked by the work. Contextual Examination Modem hermeneutics suggest that all learning takes place in a tradition, a system, a mode of understanding, and that knowledge is based on models of reality constructed from one's culture and adapted for personal use (Bruner [in Biggel, 1982). Another body of work (Gombrich, 1972; Jung, 1964) further suggests that artists consciously or unconsciously embed meaning in visual symbols arising from their personal, social, and psychological contexts. Bumham (1971) explains that visual symbols are intrin- sically devoid of meaning except as signs within a larger, referentially contextual framework. Thus, while the primacy of personal response is certainly to be guarded, to deny external/contextual influences in interpretation is impossible because of human beings' syntactic propensities. Contextual Examination must be included in art criticism, either overtly or subliminally. In this case, as with the Mittler (1980) method, for pedagogical purposes Contextual Examination is held until after personal interpretation. Functionally, the teacher may supply significant information if the context is a group critique in a limited time frame. Alternatively, students who are preparing written or oral individual critiques may stop observing the work to do corollary research at this point. The most valuable genetic information will directly contribute to the student's understanding of the particular image. For example, in talking about Victor Brauner's Surrealist one wants to know the point behind his seemingly arbitrary and dream-like associations of form, rather than the fact that he painted sets for Oscar Wilde's production of Salome. One wants to know why he painted what he did, as he did. What was the artist's intent in making this painting? Information about the specific work is most desirable. In the absence of that, material related to that specific time and style of that artist is most valuable. What stimulated the work? What were the artist's technical and thematic goals? What processes were used? Other important genetic information might include the materials the artist had available and what the basic artistic assumptions and restrictions were. Finally, it could be important to understand the social, political, religious, and economic nature of the artist's world and how these factors influence the artist's role in that world. Was the artist an advocate of the system or a rebel, an innovator or a synthesizer, a spiritualist or a pragmatist? Synthesis Synthesis is the act of creatively combining the descriptive and analytical compo- nents and their resulting personal interpretation with expert opinion and arriving at an evaluation of the work. Evaluation, in the educational context, is not an act of determining the work's importance in the chronology of art nor of assessing its historical or potential pecuniary significance. Significance should be determined by the aesthetic power of the image in its relationship to that particular viewer. But this aesthetic power is both affective and objective. In the light of the personal and contextual examinations, the driving question of Synthesis is, "What is there about this work that is significant to me, and why?" 35</page><page sequence="9">TOM ANDERSON Students might first briefly restate personal interpretations, and then salient points of expert opinion. The next operation is to try to reconcile personal and expert views by discussing how they agree or overlap and to note where they disagree. It is perfectly acceptable for the student critic to disagree with expert opinion at this point. In accepting the multiplicity of meanings inherent in visual images, the teacher must accept students' interpretations as being as valid as any other. After personal examina- tion and contextual research they have earned the right. The final operation of synthesis is making an evaluation of the work as determined primarily by the student's response to it, and tempered by the influence of genetic information. Students do not have expertise or depth to make comparative expert evaluations and should not be expected to do so. Rather, they are reflecting on the position they have come to in relation to the work to see if it holds. At this stage students should be very clear as to the nature of their evaluations. They should understand the difference between saying "I like it," and, "It is good," or between "It moves me," and "It does what it tries to do." To make these distinctions students should address the work's compositional success, technical proficiency, and oneness of purpose and form. Stylistically, does it feel proficient? Technically is it up to what it attempts? Composi- tionally, does it hold together? Students should also attend in their evaluation to the expressive content of the work in relation to personal and social values. Is the best commercial poster (whose intent is persuasive and mercantile) as good as the best "fine" art (the intent of which may be persuasive for other reasons, or purely aesthetic)? How does the work reflect life forces, social themes, and causes and sensibilities of its times? Is the work valid in its purposes? What is the work's contextual significance? The nature of this reflection should not be ignored in synthesis. The operations of synthesis include an evaluation of the student's personal experi- ence, in light of expert opinion, and finally an evaluation of the work in question in light of all that has been learned. The final question is, "What is the work's pervasive nature, its ambience, its place in the [student's] scheme of things? This is very much like the initial question, "What is the work's driving pervasive quality?" The difference is that at this point the student has earned the right to answer such a question with at least tentative authority. Summary If, as Amheim (1986) claims, the human mind functions in the two basic, interde- pendent modes of intuitive perception and intellectual analysis, both of which are crucial to intelligent cognition, it makes sense to consciously and systematically incorporate both aspects in pedagogical art criticism. "In education, to neglect the one in favor of the other or to keep them apart cannot but cripple the minds we are trying to nurture" (Amheim, 1986). 'Among the rationally weighted methods currently in use are those developed by Broudy (See Roucher, 1986), Chapman (1977), Feldman (1987), Hamblen (1984), Kaelin (1981), Lankford (1984), Marantz (1965), Mittler (1980), Salome (1981), and Smith (1968). At the intuitive pole is Johanson (1982), and giving at least a nod to the intuitive position is Clements (1979). References Amheim, R. (1969). Visual thinking.
