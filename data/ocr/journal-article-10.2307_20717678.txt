<plain_text><page sequence="1">Living the Eternal Return as the Event: Nietzsche with Deleuze * Keith Ansell Pearson It's the failure to live that makes one ill, and humiliates one (Lawrence 1995: 125). Subjectivity is never ours, it is time, that is, the soul or the spirit, the virtual. (Deleuze 1985: 110; 1989: 82-3) There is a profound link between signs, events, life, and vitalism: the power of nonorganic life...(Deleuze 1990: 196; 1994: 143). It is by no means an easy or simple affair to determine what kind of thought Nietzsche's doctrine of eternal return is. Is it the thought of an incommunicable experience? Is it an experience not simply of a thought but of thought itself (of the simulation and dissimulation 'of thought, of the semination and dissemination 'of thought)? As to whether it is a philosophical thought or a thought that is in some sense 'outside' philosophy a great deal obviously depends on the conception of philosophy and its history we have. If, for example, we imagine, perhaps too inattentively, that philosophy has been governed in its history by principles of identity, self-sameness, self-presence, etc., then one might wish to contend that a thought such as this is indeed outside metaphysics. Whatever form or character we choose to bestow on it, however, the thought of eternal return does not cease to lose its uncanny character or any of its demonic force. It remains monstrous in spite of, and no doubt because of, our vain attempts to tame it and make it work for us. It is the ghost of a thought that continues to live on long after one has confronted it and believes oneself to have left it behind. It is perhaps the thought par excellence of simulacra, of originary difference or heterogeneity, and of reality as virtual. Its experiment operates on many levels, both theoretical and practical, cosmological and ethical. There is also the question of its status as a thought-experiment within the wider context of Nietzsche's encounter with history, with what man is and may still become as the great undetermined animal, the sick animal whose repetitions provide it with a futurity, the animal whom nature has invented in order to enjoy and endure the promise of life (the promise which can only reside in futurity). But in thinking through its relation to the over-man, the being of promise, we need to ask: is this overhuman an intensification of man, an enhancement of this curious species, or is the change of concept so dramatic that it denotes a mode of evolution that heralds something wholly other to, rather than more than, the human? This question never gets fixed in Deleuze's texts, rather one finds different configurations and stagings of it (see, for example, the appendix to the Foucault book on The Death of Man and Superman', where le surhomme is taken to denote not the disappearance of living human beings and as requiring much more than a simple change of concept, and where the eternal return is construed as the 'Superfold' (Surpli) that offers an 'unlimited finity'). In the texts of the late 1960s at least Deleuze takes seriously 64</page><page sequence="2">Nietzsche's presentation of the eternal return as a 'great cultivating thought', that is, as a thought of culture and a paideia of thought. It thus plays a crucial role in his conception of the art or praxis of philosophy as an attempt to think 'beyond' the 'human condition', where such a 'beyond' denotes the acquisition and cultivation of a 'higher human nature' (une nature humaine superieure) (Deleuze 1968: 114; 1990: 129). For Deleuze the eternal return provides the human with this experience of TDeyond', in effect, a mobile thinking of the overhuman as an intensification and enhancement of the human condition that is always implicated in...'a life'. If the doctrine of eternal return demands a new relation to time, a new thought of time involving the undergoing of time, then surely the thought is also critically related to, and informed by, the times of modernity. I would mention three as being of special significance: the time of capital, the time of entropy, and the time of the death-drive (times of the eternal return of the same without becoming or the invention of the event). As the author of a crucial postwar text on difference and repetition Deleuze noted himself that such a thinking emerges at a fairly precise moment in history when the most mechanical and stereotypical repetitions appear to have overtaken life altogether and subjected it to a law of homogeneity and sameness. Such a thought is designed, therefore, to be both critical and clinical. In this essay I shall focus my attention on the 'superior' compulsion to repeat (the compulsion of the overhuman and of the differential future) that Deleuze locates in Nietzsche's eternal return, superior, that is, in relation to the entropic model of the repetition-compulsion which informs Freud's death-drive. The thought is designed to fill so many holes and fulfil so many roles it is perhaps in danger of collapsing under its own weight, and we with it.' The pressures it intends to bear on us are so immense that we are crushed by it. All that remains is to continue the task of its strange encounter, especially the encounter with its 'ethical' dimension. In Nietzsche and Philosophy Deleuze made the innovation of reading the eternal return as an ethical and selective thought which could be imaginatively worked through in relation to Kant's categorical imperative since it provides the will with a new practical rule and a practical synthesis that heralds the 'becoming-active of forces' (1962: 77-81; 1983: 68-71). This working through of the eternal return in relation to Kant is taken up again in the opening pages of Difference and Repetition where Deleuze seeks to show that the formalism of Nietzsche's doctrine overturns Kant on his own ground. It does this by divorcing repetition from the moral law and making repetition itself the only form of a new law that is beyond morality. At this point we attain the 'suspension of ethics' and a thought that is heyond good and evil' (Deleuze 1968: 14-15; 1994: 6-7). In this essay, however, I want to examine the role this experiment in thought plays in Deleuze's thinking of an 'ethics' of the event.2 It is necessary to note that there is no contradiction here between a 'suspension' of ethics and an 'affirmation' of ethics. The suspension refers to the 'law' of the human condition, while the affirmation appeals to the 'event' of the overhuman. As may become clear, for Deleuze there is no other way to think ethics - the arts of living and dying - except in terms of the event. On this reading of the thought, therefore, one 65</page><page sequence="3">could legitimately claim - claim with an authority that is always open to contestation, open to the movement of a superior justice - that the eternal return is the ethical thought par excellence, and that the only way to conceive it as such is in terms of an encounter with the event. I want to stage an exploration of the nature of this strange encounter in this essay. Transcendental Encounters The specific task Deleuze set for philosophy in The Logic of Sense, and continuing up to his 1993 piece on 'Immanence', was to think, inhumanly and transhumanly, the transcendental as a field of immanence and to articulate from the insights into life gained an ethics of the event. This is a task that involves for Deleuze emancipating the event from both 'everyday banality' (la banalite quotidienne) and the 'sufferings of madness* (les souffrances de la folie) (1969: 290; 1990: 248). These are the two extremes, on the one Hand becoming subjected to the banalities of consciousness with its fixation on the ephemeral and the superficial, and on the other hand descending into an undifferentiated abyss from which nothing can 'return'. Deleuze's thinking is distinguished and marked by its attempt, inspired chiefly I would argue by Bergson,3 to think the intense life that is both germinal and nonorganic: ...not all Life is confined to the organic strata: rather, the organism is that which life sets against itself in order to limit itself, and there is a life all the more intense, all the more powerful for being anorganic. There are also nonhuman Becomings of human beings that overspill the anthropomorphic strata in all directions. (Deleuze and Guattari 1980: 628; 1988: 503). Although the notion of nonorganic life is not found in either Difference and Repetition or The Logic of Sense, it could be argued that these books are devoted to nothing other than the mapping out of such a life. It is Bergson who defines the task of philosophy as one of learning to think beyond the human condition. Deleuze configures this task as follows: To open us up to the inhuman and the superhuman (durations which are inferior or superior to our own), to go beyond the human condition: This is the meaning of philosophy, in so far as our condition condemns us to live among badly analyzed composites, and to be badly analyzed composites ourselves' (Deleuze 1966: 19; 1988: 28). Indeed, I would suggest that Deleuze's reading of the eternal return as an ethics of the event is of Bergsonian inspiration.4 Deleuze's contribution to a new way of thinking and existing resides in the way in which he approaches questions of life and death, seeking to remove them from the restrictive economy of an existentialist or personalist ethics (an ethics of the T and the self, Je and Moi) in order to open up the human to the ?ver-human. This 'beyond' of the human denotes for Deleuze nothing transcendent but is implicated fully in the superior durations that characterize the plane of immanence. Deleuze's avowed aim is to produce an 'art of living', in which the line upon which life and death exist in 66</page><page sequence="4">implicated and complicated movement can be mapped out in terms of the logic of the 'Outside' (Deleuze 1990: 149-151; 1995: 110-111). It is the forces of the 'outside' which impinge and impact upon us, upon what we think we are and what we think we are capable of becoming, offering the possibility of living dangerously, experimentally and 'ethically'. It is the peristaltic movements of the outside which serve to destratify fixed and stable identities and produce through doubling processes new possibilities for an intenser and more creative existence. The double is never, therefore, a projection of the interior, so that the process involves not a 'One' but a redoubling of the 'Other', not a reproduction of the same but a repetition of difference, not the radiant emanation of a possessive T but the immanent production of a non self: 'It is never the other who is a double in the doubling process, it is a self that lives me as the double of the other' (Deleuze 1986: 105; 1988: 98). This means that in an encounter it is never a question of meeting oneself on the outside but only ever the other within the one that is always caught up in doubling and folding processes (Deleuze compares the process to the invagination of tissue in embryology and to the act of doubling in sewing that involves twisting, folding, stopping, repeating, and so on). The 'outside' denotes a field of immanence in which, strictly speaking, there is neither an internal self nor an external one (T and 'not-I'). The 'absolute Outside' is devoid of selves 'because interior and exterior are equally a part of the immanence in which they have fused'(Deleuze and Guattari 1980: 194; 1988: 156). The aim of this new art of living is not to identify with the line, though madness and suicide always exist as a risk, since this would be to destroy all thinking and life. Rather, the task is to both 'cross the line' and make it endurable and workable; in short, this is the line of life cracked by death and conceived as germinal The 'outside' is the line of life that links up random and arbitrary events in a creative mixture of chance and necessity. A new thought of the outside, and a new way of living on the outside, involves drawing new figures and mapping new diagrams, in short, a general intensive and vital topology of thought that folds the outside into the inside. The passion of the outside is the passion of germinal life, releasing the forces of life from entropic containment and opening them up for a time to come. The significance of this thought of germinal life can only be fully appreciated to the extent that the nature of Deleuze's movement beyond a philosophy of the subject has been understood and this requires, in tum, some understanding of his engagement with Kant's founding project of philosophic modernity. In The Logic of Sense Deleuze seeks to develop a new conception of the transcendental philosophy by approaching it as a topological field not inhabited by the T, the cogito or the synthetic unity of apperception, but populated by pre-individual singularities that constitute a 'Dionysian sense-producing machine' (Deleuze 1969: 130-1; 1990: 107). It is this 'surface topology' made up of populations (multiplicities that are not simply a combination of the one and the many) and preindividual singularities which constitutes the 'real transcendental field'. Singularities refer to 'ideal events' (ideal in the sense that they exist or endure beyond their specific individual manifestations and significations), such as bottlenecks, knots, points of fusion, processes of condensation, crystallization, and boiling. This surface topology cannot be restricted 67</page><page sequence="5">to the determinations of a centred subject (consciousness or natural perception); it is rather the surface of a 'skin' that acts as a membrane which allows for an interior and exterior to take shape and communicate, transporting potentials and regenerating polarities: Thus, even biologically, it is necessary to understand that "the deepest is the skin,M (ibid.: 126; 103). Deleuze does not pretend that determining the transcendental field is an easy task. In The Logic of Sense he accepts that Sartre's objections to endowing this field with the T or the synthetic unity of apperception are decisive (a point he repeats in the 1993 piece on 'Immanence', referring to Sartre's essay The Transcendence of the Ego). Before examining in more detail the character of Deleuze's encounter with Kant, it is important to note that the attempt to map the transcendental field as a field of pre-individual singularities resists the position which would claim that unless the conditions of the real object of knowledge are conceived as the same as the conditions of knowledge, then transcendental philosophy becomes impossible since it would have to establish autonomous conditions for objects and thereby be forced to resurrect the old metaphysics. Deleuze thus refuses to accept that the only option available to us is to choose between either an undifferentiated ground (an abyss without differences) or a supremely individuated Being and a personalized Form. In Kant the transcendental turn is the only secure way of refuting the skeptical claims of empiricism and securing solid foundations for knowledge in terms of both its universality and necessity. The transcendental denotes the unity of self-consciousness but not qua a merely personal consciousness. The unity is in our own minds, it is not part of the objects apart from our knowledge of them. Experience can never give us anything that would be either universal or necessary. If knowledge remains empirical it can only ever be contingent and arbitrary. In applying a priori knowledge to experience we are already going heyond', notes Deleuze, what is given in experience. Now although this moment beyond the given is already present in Hume it is only with Kant that this movement beyond is provided with transcendental principles and arguments. In Hume, in other words, the principles which take us beyond the given are merely principles of human nature, that is, psychological principles of association that concern our own representations of, and designs upon, the world. In Kant, however, 'the subjectivity of principles is not an empirical or psychological subjectivity, but a "transcendental" subjectivity' (Deleuze 1963: 21; 1984: 13). Hegel frequently notes that expressions like 'transcendental unity of self consciousness' have an ugly air about them, suggesting, he says, that there might be 'a monster' lurking 'in the background' (Hegel 1974: 150). This is precisely what Deleuze will locate in his reworking of the transcendental in both Difference and Repetition and The Logic of Sense, namely, a thought of the monstrous and one that must become monstrous itself (as a thinking of difference 'and' repetition). This involves for Deleuze, whether one is speaking of these texts of the late 1960s or the later text What is Philosophy! of 1991 and the short essay of 1993 on 'Immanence', emancipating the transcendental field from the perceived stranglehold it undergoes at the hands of consciousness, whether this consciousness be psychological or phenomenological.5 Deleuze is committed to the seemingly extravagant and disorienting idea that all phenomenology is eprphenomenology, since, his argument 68</page><page sequence="6">goes, it fails to penetrate the more profound individuations that are implicated in a life, or creative evolution, of difference and repetition. This concern with the virtual actualization of pre-individual singularities through the mediation of individuation perhaps serves to explain Deleuze's preoccupation, atypical for a so-called 'continental philosopher' of difference, with biology and its mapping of modes of individuation (which is also clearly inspired by the example of Bergson and heavily mediated by the influence of Simondon). What is an individual and how does it become what it is in a field of individuation structured by intensities and singularities? Deleuze's argument is incredibly complex and convoluted, and I can only here present a synoptic version of it, seeking to bring out those features that are pertinent to the concerns of this essay. If the individual is inseparable from a world it is necessary to determine more precisely the character of this 'world'. A world can be viewed from two perspectives, that of an individual which actualizes and incarnates in its body the singularities which 'evolve' through forms of folding (envelopment, development, etc.), and that of the singularities which continue to persist and subsist over and above their particular incarnations and actualizations within an individuated body and self. There is, therefore, a 'continuum of singularities' that is distinct from the individuals that envelop it in variable degrees of determination. The world, says Deleuze, is not only actualized but also expressed, and while it is the case that such a world only comes into being in and through individuals, in which it exists only as a predicate, it is equally true to claim that it subsists in a highly different manner, namely, 'as an event or a verb, in the singularities which preside over the constitution of individuals' (1969: 135; 1990: 111) (expressed in Bergson's terms: the singularities enjoy a virtual existence, and although they are actualized, and must be actualized, the actualization does not exhaust their powers of invention, and neither do the contours of an actualization ever resemble the potential that has been realized). These insights will become crucial when we approach the eternal return as a thought and willing of the event (how one becomes what one is as an event of becoming, becoming the event of one's own actualization through a counter-actualization). The error of attempts to define the transcendental with consciousness for Deleuze is that they get constructed in the image of that which they are supposed to ground, running the risk of simply reduplicating the empirical (Deleuze 1969: 128; 1990: 105). Metaphysics and transcendental philosophy are only able to think singularities by imprisoning them within the confines of a supreme self (un Moi supreme) or a superior T (un Je superieur) (Deleuze 1969: 129; 1990: 106). In The Logic of Sense the subject is transmuted into a free, anonymous, nomadic singularity which is said to 'traverse' humans, plants, and animals. This 'nonorganic' life does this by being not dependent on the matter of the particular individuations and the forms of their personality. This transversality, says Deleuze, constitutes the universe of Nietzsche's 'overman' (1969: 131; 1990: 107). In later work this transversal field is identified as the plane of immanence, which, starting with Descartes and running from Kant to Husserl, gets treated as a field of consciousness: 'Immanence is supposed to be immanent to a pure consciousness, to a thinking subject' (Deleuze and Guattari 1991: 47-8; 1994: 46). So, while Kant denounces the employment of transcendent Ideas he 69</page><page sequence="7">discovers at the same time, Deleuze contends, the 'modem way of saving transcendence' through the auto-productive subject (the subject to whom immanence gets attributed and which is treated as an efficacious power). The character of Deleuze's peculiar transcendentalism can be perhaps further clarified by examining the discussion of Kant which figures in the chapter called The Image of Thought' in Difference and Repetition. In rethinking the 'image' of thought - the image by which thought becomes and goes astray - Deleuze argues that it is within our conception of thought that the empirical and the transcendental get distributed and related. He is concerned to show how within Kant and phenomenology the transcendental is never made truly transcendental. What does this mean? And why is it such a problem that philosophy fails to get right the installation of the transcendental? Deleuze's argument is that although it is Kant who discovers the prodigious powers of the transcendental he never escapes, in spite of his immense labours, to free transcendental structures of thought from the empirical acts of a psychological consciousness. We only have to witness in this regard, says Deleuze, the moves taking place between the first and second editions of the Critique of Pure Reason, and the fact that although psychologism is better hidden it still cannot be prevented from exposing itself. The reason why this is such a problem for Deleuze is that it means* in effect, that philosophy fails in the Kantian revolution to emancipate itself fully, if at all, from the domain of doxa, and which is always for him constituted by the two halves of common sense and good sense (we may also recall at this juncture that for Deleuze critique must always be violent and never at peace with established powers, a conception of philosophy which informs his reading of Nietzsche as the true philosopher of critique in his book on Nietzsche) (1962: 102-6; 1983: 89-93).6 His argument here is quite specific, and needs to be cited in its details: No doubt philosophy refuses every particular doxa; no doubt it upholds no particular propositions of good sense or common sense. No doubt it recognises nothing in particular. Nevertheless, it retains the essential aspect of doxa - namely, the form; and the essential aspect of common sense, namely the model itself (harmony of the faculties grounded in the supposedly universal thinking subject and exercised upon the unspecified object)...so long as one only abstracts from the empirical content of doxa, while maintaining the operation of the faculties which corresponds to it and implicitly retains the essential aspect of the content, one remains imprisoned by it (Deleuze 1968: 175-6; 1994: 134). Deleuze seeks to undermine the idea of knowledge that is implied in the transcendental model of modern metaphysics, which, he argues, is a model and form of recognition. Construed in these terms philosophy is unable to open itself up to that which exceeds its faculties and the norms it imposes on their operation (the aberrant, the anomalous, the fiizzy, the indiscernible, and so on). It is for this reason that Deleuze refuses to distinguish the transcendental form of a faculty from its transcendent application: The transcendent exercise must not be traced from the empirical exercise precisely because it apprehends that which cannot be grasped from the point of view of common sense' (ibid.: 186; 143). Ultimately, this means that the transcendental must be answerable to a 'superior empiricism', which is obviously not the empiricism of common and good sense but that of another 'logic of sense' 70</page><page sequence="8">altogether: the empiricism of the unknown, the demonic, the anarchic, etc. There is something in the world that forces us to think. For Deleuze this something is not to become an object of recognition but rather assume the form of a 'fundamental encounter* (rencontre) (ibid.: 182; 139). It has to be an encounter with demons - as in Nietzsche's encounter with the demon who offers him the fateful and fatal task of undergoing the thought-experiment of eternal return, of taking up and passing on the gift and task of the over-human (Nietzsche 1974: section 335). The over-human exceeds established philosophical modes of recognition and the reduction of becomings in the world to perceptual and affective cliches. Ethics after Individuation Deleuze goes on to argue that the T and the 'Self (Je and Moi) are little more than indices of the species, in particular of 'man'. By contrast, individuation is that which precedes species and makes them possible.7 It is individuation conceived as a field of intensive factors which informs Deleuze's rethinking of ethics 'beyond* the subject, to move thought beyond the 'human condition' and to open it up to the inhuman and overhuman. The abyss of this Dionysian and delirious world, a world of free and unbound energy, is not, Deleuze insists, an impersonal or abstract Universal beyond individuation. For him this is precisely what defines Nietzsche's break with Schopenhauer (see Deleuze 1969: 131; 1990: 107). It is rather the T and the self that are abstract universals which need to be conceived in relation to the individuating forces that both constitute and consume them: 'What cannot be replaced is individuation itself (Deleuze 1968: 332; 1994: 258). This is to think life not as the expression of a determined world but as a possible one, replete with diffuse potentialities and virtual actualizations. The 'life' of the individual always exceeds that of the species, but the individuating factors that are implicated in a process of individuation assume neither the form of the T nor the matter of the self (if the former represents the psychic determination of the species, the latter expresses its psychic organization). The formation of the T is inseparable from a form of identity, while the self is always constituted by a continuity of family resemblances. 'Individuation', Deleuze writes, 'is mobile, strangely supple, fortuitious and endowed with fringes and margins' (Deleuze 1968; 331: 1994: 257). In 'becoming what it is' the self is implicated in dissolution and the T finds itself fractured: 'For it is not the other which is another I, but the I which is an other, a fractured T (ibid.: 335; 261). Death can be situated from this life of the dissolved self within the folds of an involution. In the becoming of any system death has a double face: a face of implication and involvement, a face of involution, and a face of explication and evolution, a face of entropy. The most powerful face of death is that which is hidden, almost noumenal. It is the death which acts as the agent of dissolution and decomposition, being that internal power' which frees the process of individuation from the form of the T and the matter of the Self in which life has become imprisoned. Every death, therefore, can be deemed to be double, being both a cancellation of large differences through entropic extension, and the liberation of those little differences which swarm through an intensive involution. Deleuze always considered it superficial to regard the late Foucault as making a naive 71</page><page sequence="9">return to the subject. There are only for Foucault, Deleuze argues, processes of subjectification and relations of self to self that involve relations of forces and foldings of forces (intensities, densities, etc.). The 'ethical subject' exists only as the being that problematizes itself - it does not know what it is - and allows itself to be constituted within a field of problems (Deleuze 1986: 126; 1988: 118). Ethics concerns the production of new creative lines of life that depend on how one folds the forces, producing not a new subject but a 'work of art' (Deleuze 1990: 127; 1995: 92). What gets produced in this art of living is a field of forces (electrical, magnetic, kinetic), speaking of an individuation that evolves and involves through weak and strong intensities and through active and passive affects. The subject on this model is divested of both inferiority and identity, transformed into an 'event' of individuation, so that a self always exists as a mode of intensity, never simply as a personal subject (ibid.: 134-5; 98-9). The cracked line is, more often that not, deadly, moving fast and violent, transporting us into 'breathless regions'. The task, however, is never to simply surrender to the lethal character of the line, but to always seek to extract some surplus value from its productivity and fecundity, so as to pass something on that will continue to exist germinally: 'You write with a view to an unborn people that doesn't yet have a language' (Deleuze 1990: 196; 1995: 143). Deleuze's commitment to this mode of thinking beyond an active or phallic subject is such that it leads him to making a rigorous and strict separation of the movement of 'desire', which is always transversal, from the experience of 'pleasure'.' Pleasure is 'on the side of strata and organization', serving only to interrupt the purely immanent process of desire (Deleuze 1997a: 189-90). He insists that desire does not have pleasure as its 'norm' because pleasure always wants, on Deleuze's austere reading, to attribute the production and distribution of affects to a subject or person, acting as a means for the person to find himself or herself again in a process that overwhelms them and which ensures that the act of repetition is always undergone again and again (Deleuze 1977: 119; 1987: 99-100). In making this point Deleuze is, in part, following Nietzsche in his incisive attack on the great errors of psychology. Nietzsche points out that our inability to allow for new experiences and new sensations lies in the tendency to stratify existence by always tracing the unknown back into what is already known and familiar, producing for ourselves effects that are alleviating, gratifying, soothing, and giving ourselves 'moreover a feeling of power'. This, he notes, is 'Proof by pleasure ("by potency") as criterion of truth' (Nietzsche 1979b: 51). The result is to exclude from experience the unexperienced, or the yet-to be experienced, as well as the strange, the uncanny, and the new and the immeasurable.9 This explains why in his reworking of Freud's positing of a 'beyond' of the pleasure principle Deleuze grants primacy to the phenomenon of repetition. The death-drive needs to be related not so much to destructive tendencies and aggressivity, but more to phenomena of repetition. If the pleasure principle is tied inextricably to a psychological principle, that of the 'beyond' is linked necessarily to a transcendental principle (Deleuze 1968: 27; 1994: 16). It is not so much a question of drawing something new from repetition as more a matter of making repetition a novelty, that is, liberating the will from all that binds it by making repetition the object of willing: 72</page><page sequence="10">The question in each and every thing: "Do you desire this once more and innumerable times more?" would lie upon your actions as the greatest weight' Nietzsche 1974: section 341). On this reading the 'subject' of this willing in eternal return is the field of intensities and singularities, chance encounters and fortuitous circumstances, that a self finds itself implicated in, In other words, the subject is not the self (the speck of dust), but this moonlight, this spider, this moment; that is, it is the haecceity and the world to which it belongs and which it must turn, along with its singular becoming, into the event.10 As such, the demonic question invited by the eternal return seeks to transform mere action in the world into the event of a world, that is, it seeks to cultivate the event ('a life'). Deleuze cites the following important passage from a piece by Klossowski: the vehement oscillations which upset the individual as long as he seeks only his own center and does not see the circle of which he himself is a part; for if these oscillations upset him, it is because each corresponds to an individuality other than that which he takes as his own from the point of view of the undiscoverable center. Hence, an identity is essentially fortuitous [the innocence of becoming - KAP] and a series of individualities must be traversed by each, in order that the fortuity make them completely necessary. (Deleuze 1969: 209; 1990: 178). The experience of repetition is never for Deleuze, as it is in Freud, simply implicated in a 'regression' (such as the compulsion to repeat which determines the death-drive)." This would entail reducing death to the model of a purely physical or material repetition, to what Deleuze calls a merely 'brute repetition'. The reason why Freud has to construe the death-drive in terms of the step backwards, a desire to return to inanimate matter, is because of his cornmitment to a conception of the personal unity and integrity of the organism. On this model death must, therefore, always be conceived as a negative splitting and falling apart, a 'regressus' involving reactive, internalized violence of a self on itself, for it is full of self-loathing and self contempt, and expresses ressentiment towards what perceives to be outside itself and alien to it (the stranger, the unfamiliar and the uncanny).12 In the repetition of return, however, we are exposed to 'demonic power' that is more complicated, living between life and death, at the border, on the edge of chaos: 'If repetition makes us ill, it also heals us; if it enchains and destroys us, it also frees us...' (Deleuze 1968: 30; 1994: 19).13 Deleuze always insists on thinking beyond the death which is apodeictic knowledge (our sense of the mortality of the self is both empty and abstract, he maintains) and places the stress on the importance of coming to know the 'event' of death that always enjoys an open problematic structure ('where and when?') (Deleuze 1969: 170-1; 1990: 145). For Deleuze it is the eternal return which creates the time of the event through which the vital powers and unbound energies that make possible 'creative evolution' in Bergson's sense can be emancipated from the containment of a closed system. This will now be explored in the next major section of the essay. The Eternal Return and the Heredity of the Crack In a meditation on Zola and the 'crack-up' that appears as one of the appendices to The Logic of Sense Deleuze draws a distinction between two types of heredity: the one small, historical, and somatic; the other epic and germinal. A heredity of the instincts 73</page><page sequence="11">and a heredity of the crack or fault-line. The somatic heredity might include a phenomenon such as alcoholism being passed down the generations from one body to another (the example given by Zola himself in La Bete Humaine when writing of the hereditary crack). This kind of transmission reproduces the return of the same. What is novel about Deleuze's reading of Zola is the attempt to implicate the somatic transmission in a different crack; where one kind of crack transmits something well determined, reproducing whatever is transmitted, the other communicates in terms of a vital and virtual topology (dealing with thresholds, limits, transformations, connections and disconnections, implications and complications, closed and open systems). In the case of the heredity of the crack 'it is not tied to a certain instinct, to an internal, organic determination, or to an external event that could fix an object'. It is thus able to 'transcend lifestyles' (my emphasis). The movement of the heredity of the crack is for Deleuze 'imperceptible' and 'silent'. The crack cannot be 'replicated' since its mode of transmission is diffuse and inchoate, it proceeds via an 'oblique line, being ready to change directions and to alter its canvas' (Deleuze 1969: 377; 1990: 325). The crack transmits only the undetermined crack, capable of changing directions and transforming its canvas. With the heredity of the crack characteristics are not simply acquired but have to be invented and are forced to undergo transmutation. The crack 'follows' only itself, like a runaway train destined for derailment. On the tracks of this germinal train of life there is neither beginning nor end, neither a given genealogy nor a given teleology, but only the broken middles that allow for novel intersections, cross-connections, and unpredictable growths, constituting a cornucopia of good and bad. The crack enjoys a capacity for self overcoming, making possible creative 'evolutions', in which the creation involved offers not a simple redemption but allows for the germinality of the most destructive inclinations and tendencies. 'He knew that all his life he had been wrenching at the frame of life to break it apart. And now, with something of the terror of a destructive child, he saw himself on the point of inheriting his own destruction' (Lawrence 1995: 221). But if one inherits one's destruction - as in Freud's death-drive (a principle of death through life) with its inversion of Weismann's thesis on the continutiy of the germ-plasm (a principle of life through the death of the soma) - how is it possible for this destruction to be reconfigured as a force of a 'creative evolution'? It is in addressing this question that Deleuze is led to turn to the eternal return as a thought experiment able to think the play of 'difference and repetition'. In the crucial chapter of the novel Dr Pascal (the final book in a cycle of twenty) entitled The Genealogical-Tree' Zola has the doctor lay out before himself and the young woman Clotilde the entire genealogical tree of the Rougon-Macquart family in order to present her with a 'terrible lesson in life' (Zola 1989: 109ff). But this tree stretches way beyond and over this particular family, encompassing the strata of races and civilizations from the dawn of time to the present and branching out endlessly into unknown futures (ibid.: 126). This is 'the whole monstrous flourescence of the human tree' (ibid.: 131). Moreover, this genealogy is presented in the terms of a highly complex, erratic, and unpredictable, monstrous descent, a descent subject to, to employ Delezue's terms, perpetual deterritorialization and reterritorialization. 2^ola is imaginative in depicting the unfolding of this tree of human life in terms of a complicated entanglement of sickness and health, of death and renewal, a vitality of 74</page><page sequence="12">life that is caught up in destruction, decay, and degeneration. Pascal asks, for example: once the floodgates have been opened by the overflowing river of life (creative evolution as monstrous), and as detected by the emergent science of heredity (as the science of difference 'and' repetition), then is it possible to say that among the weeds and flowers on the banks there also mingles and floats by - gold? (ibid.: 132). This is, says Pascal, a world 'beyond good and evil'. The chapter concludes by asking whether it is necessary to bum the tree of genealogy or whether this can only be a matter of the future as its matter. In the novel Zola presents Doctor Pascal's work on the new science of heredity moving through Darwin's confused theory of pangenesis, the peri-genesis of Emst Haeckel (whose works were avidly read by Nietzsche), the eugenics of Galton (also keenly read by Nietzsche), finally arriving at an intuition of Weismann's major thesis on the continuity of the germ-plasm in which a portion of this 'delicate' and 'complex' substance is held in reserve and passed on without variation or mutation from generation to generation (ibid.: 36). Pascal, however, does not stop there, which is what makes his case especially interesting. He propounds his own theory which he calls 'the failure of the cells theory', which consists in granting a high degree of freedom and novelty to plasmic evolution. It is not atavism that Pascal privileges but 'perpetual change', the change that denotes '...an increasing transformation, due to that transmitted strength and effort, that perturbation, which imbues matter with life, and which is, indeed, life itself in an abstract sense' (ibid.: 38). In short, there is no plasmic finality and it at this point that Zola is able to resist the biological nihilism of Weismann's continuity thesis. It is in terms of such a nihilism that Weismann is appropriated in Hardy's tragic fiction where the anomalous and the aberrant (the 'unfit') are not allowed to survive but must face extermination (Tess, Jude the Obscure, etc.). This biological nihilism amounts, in short, to repetition without difference, to the eternal return of the same, since the germ-plasm is posited as evolving completely independently of external perturbations (Deleuze's 'crack'), and it is certainly free of any endogenous powers the organism might possess itself. In his reading of literature, therefore, Deleuze is proposing a vital reworking of heredity, in which it is shown that it is not heredity that passes through the crack, which would fix desire to a morbid ancestry, but that heredity is the crack itself. Hence the claim: 'In its true sense, the crack (la felure) is not a crossing for a morbid heredity; it a lone is the hereditary and the morbid in its entirety' (Deleuze 1969: 373; 1990: 321). For Deleuze everything depends on grasping the significance of this paradox, confusing this heredity with its vehicle, that is, the 'confusion of what is transmitted with its transmission' (the transmission which transmits only itself). This is what he means when he declares the 'germen' to be the crack and nothing but the crack. The way Deleuze links the heredity of the crack up with the death-instinct is crucial since it wants to implicate death in the dimension of 'difference and repetition'. This accounts, therefore, for the momentous and monstrous role Nietzsche's eternal return plays in Deleuze's re-working of the death-drive, subjecting all questions of descent and heredity (origin and genealogy) to deterritorialization. In Freud the desire of the 75</page><page sequence="13">organism to return to inanimate matter assumes that there is an original model of death to be returned to (the One death, the single truth of death). As such, the death drive is a desire for identity (Nirvana). This is what Deleuze means when he maintains that Freud's positing of the death-drive is caught up in a 'brute' model of 'bare repetition' (repetition without simulacra, without originary difference). So far as the possibility of difference enjoying its own concept, as opposed to being laid out under the dominion of a concept in general that already presupposes a founding identity, Nietzsche's thought-experiment of the eternal return amounts to something of a 'Copernican revolution'. Identity now operates as a secondary power and speaks only of differences qua differences (it speaks of repetition). The true subject of the eternal return', Deleuze contends, are the intensities and singularities which refer to the mobile individuating factors that cannot be contained within a self, and in which the One does not return (that which aspires to recentre the acentred or decentred circle of desire). Rather, what returns is the divergent series and inclusive disjunctions: 'In the circle of Dionysus, Christ will not return; the order of the Antichrist chases the other order away' (1969: 348-9; 1990: 300-1). The system of the Antichrist convulses a world where the identity of the self is lost - 'not to the benefit of of the identity of the One or the unity of the Whole, but to the advantage of an intense multiplicity and a power of metamorphosis...' (ibid.: 345; 297). Thus if there is an 'essential relation' to be encountered between eternal return and death it is because the repetition of eternal return implies the death of that which is one 'once and for all*. Likewise, if it enjoys an essential relation with the future it is because the future is the explication and complication of the multiple, the different, and the fortuitous, 'for themselves and "for all time'" (Deleuze 1968: 152; 1994: 115). The eternal return thus selects against the One, against that which will not select. A great deal of confusion surrounds Deleuze's commitment to a conception of univocal Being which is regarded as implying a commitment to the 'one'. The erroneous nature of this characterization can be readily demonstrated by appealing to what is at stake in the repetition of the eternal return, namely the affirmation of originary difference and the play of simulacra.14 It is the eternal return which articulates the nature of univocal Being. The affirmation of the eternal return is the affirmation of all chance in a single moment and Being as the unique event, 'one Being and only for all forms and all times' but always as 'extra-Being' (Deleuze 1969: 211; 1990: 180). On Deleuze's model the eternal return provides nothing less than a 'new image of thought*, of the birth of thought and the thought of birth. It is the 'phantasm' that constitutes the site of the eternal return, endlessly mimicking the birth of a thought and the thought of a birth, beginning *a new desexualization, sublimation, and symbolization, caught in the act of bringing about this birth' (ibid.: 256; 220). Deleuze utilizes Zola's appropriation of work on heredity, which identifies the 'difference' between a homologous and determined heredity and a dissimilar or transformational heredity, in order to render impossible any stable duality of the the hereditary and the acquired. Deleuze concedes that the small type of heredity may well indeed transmit acquired characteristics, simply because the formation of instincts is inseparable from a social field and historical conditions. But in the case of the grand heredity the acquired characteristics are brought into a quite different relationship since here we are dealing with a 'diffuse potentiality' (ibid.: 377; 325). 76</page><page sequence="14">Moreover: ...if it is true that the instincts are formed and find their object only at the edge of the crack, the crack conversely pursues its course, spreads out its web, changes direction, and is actualized in each body in relation to the instincts which open a way for it, sometimes mending it a little, sometimes widening it, up to the final shattering...The two orders are tightly joined together, like a ring within a larger ring, but they are never confused, (ibid.) The crack is simply the emptiness, the great void, it is death - 'the death instinct' (I'Instinct de Mori) (ibid.: 378; 326). For all the the 'noise' they make, the swarming instincts cannot hide the fact that they belong to this more profound silence from which they burst forth and to which they return. When death happens the stillness in the room is such that one can hear a 'Fly buzz'; it is 'like the Stillness in the Air - Between the Heaves of Storm' (Dickinson 1969: 31). The death instinct is 'not merely one instinct among others, but the crack itself around which all of the instincts congregate* (Deleuze, ibid.).15 On this model of life entropy is not allowed the final word or the last say; rather, its 'transcendental illusion' must always be exposed. Deleuze wants to argue that the death-instinct constitutes the complicated 'grand heredity' of the crack (it's not tragic but epical, since it concerns revolutionary movement). But the death-instinct is retrieved from any global entropic determination or telos: 'Is it possible, since it [the death-instinct or drive] absorbs every instinct, that it could also enact the transmutation of the instincts, turning death against itself? Would it not thereby create instincts which would be evolutive rather than alcoholic, erotic, or financial...' (1969: 385; 1990: 332). For Deleuze it is enough that we dissipate ourselves 'a little', 'that we are able to be at the surface, that we stretch our skin like a arum', liberating singularities that are neither general nor individual, neither personal nor universal, from their containment in the self and the T: AH of this is traversed by circulations, echoes, and events which produce more sense, more freedom, and more strength than man has ever dreamed of, or God ever conceived' (ibid.: 91; 73). In Freud the 'daemonic power' of the *beyond' of the pleasure principle (the compulsion to repeat that characterizes masochism and the death-drive) is too readily domesticated by being reduced to an Oedipal determination and articulation, namely the influence of early infantile experiences which are invariably used to explain the apparent 'malignant fate' we feel possesses us, driving us on and tormenting our minds. Deleuze's reading of Zola endeavours to remove the death-instinct from the tragic model Freud traps it in order to open it up to the pagan space of the epos. The crack comes from the future as a sign of the future. In the 'exaggeration' of life as composed by the great writer or artist, inspiration comes not from the logos but the epos, which discloses to us that we can never go far enough in the direction of 'decomposition', 'since it is necessary to go as far as the crack leads' (ibid.: 385; 332). Art is, therefore, implicated in degeneration. Civilization is haunted by its discontents and malcontents. Degeneration and decay not only disclose signs of the future but show that the future is only possible to the extent that it grows out of the great health (the health that has incorporated the crack as that which allows for repetition and difference). Zola's 'putrid literature is a literature of the future: 'Zola's optimistic literature is not anything other than his putrid literature. It is in one and the same movement...' 77</page><page sequence="15">(Deleuze 1969: 385; 1990: 332). The death-instinct on this model is not a manifestation of buried repressed desires, a primeval lust for murder, but is to be read as signs of the future, of new life, new affects, and new bodies of desire. In learning to will the Event one undergoes a 'volitional intuition and transmutation' (ibid.: 176; 149). One does not will exactly what occurs, but rather wills terminally\ willing something 'in that which occurs' and as 'something yet to come', namely, the concealed and revealed Event. This is a willing of life that is one 'with the struggle of free human beings'. A thinking of the eternal return as the time of the event seeks to make comprehensible, therefore, much of the paradoxical aspect of the doctrine, such as how, for example, it involves an affirmation of everything as it is but yet entails no Stoic resignation. Zarathustra's Thus I willed it!' is above all, on Deleuze's reading not a mere acceptance of the past but a battlecry, bearing witness to the event of 'a life', and the highest affirmation of the arrival of the future in its difference. We have yet, however, to think truly madly deeply about the nature of the event. For Deleuze the crucial question pertaining to the actualization of the event concerns the possibility of sustaining its non-actualization: Is it possible to will the event without also not willing its full actualization in a corporeal mixture? Is it possjble to maintain the 'inherence' of the incorporeal crack while not incarnating it in the depth of the noisy body? Is it possible, Deleuze asks, and risks asking (taking the risk of making oneself appear as a philosophical fool), to live, love, and die 'a little alcoholic', 'a little crazy', 'a little suicidal'? It is to addressing these difficult questions that I now turn. Staging the Event of Return The eternal return, Deleuze argues, is not a theory of qualities but of pure events. Before we can comprehend the meaning and significance of this claim we need to understand better both the conception of ethics and the notion of the event he is working through. 'Either ethics (la morale) makes no sense at all', Deleuze writes, 'or this is what it means and has nothing else to say: not to be unworthy of what happens to us' (1969: 174-5; 1990: 149). This, says Deleuze, is ethical life beyond the ressentiment of the event, in which we use moral notions like just and unjust, merit and fault, immorally by rendering them personal. The event is greeted by resentment whenever we treat whatever happens to us as unjust and unwarranted. There is no other ill will', Deleuze says, than this revenge against time itself, time's 'it was'. The event is the event of time (the moment) that both happens to us and which lives beyond us (eternity): 'The event is not what occurs (an accident), it is rather inside what occurs, the purely expressed. It signals and awaits us' (ibid.). Learning to live the crack (and crack-up) as the event requires perfecting one's complex inheritance, both its misfortunes and its promises, becoming what one is as a piece of necessity and fate. Every event can be said to have a double structure. On the one hand, there is necessarily the present moment of its actualization: the event 'happens* and gets embodied in a state of affairs and in an individual ('the moment has come'). Here the time of the event, its past and future, are evaluated from the perspective of this definitive present and actual embodiment. On the other hand, the event continues to 78</page><page sequence="16">'live on', enjoying its own past and future, haunting each present, making the present return as a question of the present, and free of the limits placed upon it by any given state of affairs. The event both happens to an individual and lives on beyond the subject or person. My life appears as too weak for me, slipping away at the present instant, or I appear as too weak for life, the life that overwhelms me, the life that scatters singularities all around me without any relation to what I take to be me myself I (this is the life, says Deleuze, akin to Blanchot's death that has two faces, the death that has an extreme and definite relation to me, grounded in my mortal coil, and the death that has no relation to me at all, being incorporeal and impersonal, grounded only in itself). The concept of the event is not to be confused with any actualized state of affairs, but rather refers to the 'shadowy or secret part' that can always be subtracted from or added to an actualization as an 'infinite movement' which gives life consistency. This is the 'virtual'; not a chaotic virtual but one that has acquired consistency. And while the event may appear transcendent to the state of affairs to which it relates, it must be conceived to be an entirely immanent movement ('L'evenement est immateriel, incorporel, invivable: la pure "reserve"'). Ironically, it is the state of affairs in which the event becomes actualized that is transcendent, as well as 'transdescendent'. The time that is implicated in the becoming of the event is not that of the determination of isolable points or the measure of discrete instants, but that of the 'meanwhile' (un entre-temps), the duree of the interval or 'dead time'. The event names not the passing of time but the vectorial passage of time: 'When time passes and takes the instant away, there is always a meanwhile to restore the event' (Deleuze and Guattari 1991: 150; 1994: 158). The germinal life enjoyed by the event refers to a becoming that takes the battlefield and the wound as components and variations that live in excess of the subject's own body, including its rapport with other bodies and the physico mathematical field that determines them.16 The 'dignity' of the event is lived, unlived, and over-lived by philosophy and its ethic of amor fati on account of the fact that philosophy becomes equal to the event by being able to 'disembody' it as a state of affairs, that is, to free it for a germinal existence. Paradoxically, it is only through this disembodiment that the event can become truly embodied (ibid.: 150-1; 159). This is how, for example, it is possible to 'treat' death as an event: 'Death may be assimilated to a scientifically determinable state of affairs, as a function of independent variables or even as one of the lived state, but it also appears as a pure event whose variations are coextensive with life...' (ibid.: 153; 161). Such a concept of death - death as event - is only possible to the extent that one has gained, and won, a conception of germinal life. Death is ungraspable not simply because it does not correspond to the order of the human desire for meaning and its fulfilment (an order of representation) but because it belongs to the Event, even and especially 'one's own' death: the event can never be owned by (the) one, just as there cannot be a death that can be owned as my death. If the event of death is always too late (see Critchley 1997),17 it is precisely this which constitutes on Deleuze's conception of the event the basis for an affirmation: 'Death is...the last form of the problematic, the source of problems and questions, the sign of their persistence over and above every response, the "Where?" and "When?" which designate this (non)-being where every affirmation is nourished' (Deleuze 1968: 148; 1994: 112). 79</page><page sequence="17">'Nothing more can be said, and no more has ever been said: to become worthy of what happens to us, and thus to will and release the event, to become an offspring of one's own events, and thereby to be reborn, to have one more birth, and to break with one's carnal birth...'(Deleuze 1969: 175-6; 1990: 149-50). The play of different kinds of heredity can now be configured in terms of a play between actions and events. In becoming what one is' the task is to become the offspring of one's events, not one's actions, since the action is produced only by the offspring of the event. This is the eventful life of the cracked actor who belongs to the incorporeal time of Aion, not the God who lives in the eternal present, where the circle is complete to itself, where no transformation and transmutation are possible (the time of Chronos). 'Aeon' captures the indefinite time of the event, a floating line which travels via speeds, continually dividing, always too-late and always too-early, never quite on time (the excess of time or time of excess). Inhuman time. Chronos signifies the time of measure, always the right time, a time which corporeally situates persons and things, developing forms and determining subjects. Human time (Deleuze and Guattari 1980: 320; 1988: 262). Chronos is the time of presence, in which only the present exists in time and gathers together both past and future into a unity. The 'unlimited Aion', by contrast, names a past and a future that inhere in time and which divide every present into an infinite becoming. Events are of the order of Aion: not living presents but infinitives, heralding a becoming that in dividing itself infinitely in two directions at once - past and future - must always elude the gathering of the present. In his encounters with Fitzgerald and Artaud, Deleuze wants to know, as already indicated, whether it is possible to maintain the silent trace of the incorporeal crack at the surface without letting it descend completely, where it is lost forever in a black hole, into the coagulating thickness of the noisy body. Surely if we are to go to the outer limits we must go all the way and never come back? Does the philosopher not find himself or herself dancing close on the edge of ridiculousness, speaking from the safety of the shore? Why not just take gallons of alcohol and have done with all this futile philosophizing on matters of life and death? Does not the truth of Fitzgerald speak from the depths of alcoholic excess and does not the truth of Artaud speak from the depths of self-mutilation and the abysmal pit and pendulum of schizophrenia? However, to take just the one case, it is not a question of saving Nietzsche from madness for the reason that Nietzsche saved himself from complete descent into its black hole, giving himself over to a future germinal life by making sure that he would be born posthumously. The eternal truth of the event is grasped only if the event is also inscribed in the flesh. But each time we must double the painful actualization by a counter-actualization (contre-effectuation) which limits, moves, and transfigures it. We must accompany ourselves - first, in order to survive, but then even when we die. Counter-actualization is nothing, it belongs to a buffoon when it operates alone and pretends to have the value of what could have happened. But, to be the mime of what effectively occurs...like the true actor and dancer, is to give to the truth of the event the only chance of not being confused with its inevitable actualization. It is to give the crack the chance of flying over its own incorporeal surface area, without stopping at the bursting within each body; it is, finally, to give us the chance to go farther than 80</page><page sequence="18">we would have believed possible, (ibid.). For Deleuze it is not simply a question of asking how one can choose not to be free, but of pointing out that the freedom chosen and artificially selected bears the greatest weight as the burden of germinal life. The point Deleuze makes is that it is impossible simply to opt for the good healthy life with its denigration of the consuming passions of bodily life. Attention must be drawn to the confusion of lines, of flight and death, of paranoia and schizophrenia, 'the central point of obscurity which raises endlessly the problem of the relations of thought to schizophrenia and depression...' (Deleuze 1969: 243-4; 1990: 209). All life involves a process of demolition, even and especially the speculative life. Which is greater, the more monstrous, the more extreme, the more experimental - corporeal, individual life (somatic life) or the incorporeal life of the event (germinal life)? It's a question of being superficial out of profundity, which involves having the courage, Nietzsche says, to stop at the surface, at the fold. The depths are always to be navigated in terms of a geography of thought and existence, for in the 'entire biopsychic life' it 'is a question of dimensions, projections, axes, rotations, and foldings. Which way should one take? On which side is everything going to tumble down, to fold or unfold?' (ibid.: 272; 222-3). Germinal life does not live and die in the name of victims, of the tortured, oppressed, and depressed; rather it gives them the living line as a broken line. In dying we come to know that 'death is neither the goal nor the end, but that, on the contrary, it is a case of...passing life to someone else' even in destruction, murder, and the worst (Deleuze 1977: 76-7; 1987: 62). To return to the question of eternal return as a theory of pure events. The problem of a 'logic of sense' is, says, Deleuze, one of knowing how an individual is able to 'transcend' its form and its syntactical link with a world so as 'to attain to the universal communication of events' (which involves affirming disjunctive syntheses that are beyond mere logical contradictions).18 This involves the individual learning to recognize itself as the fortuitous case, as just like everyone else (perhaps as all the names in history). This would amount to the individual recognizing themselves solely as the event, the event that is 'actualized within her as another individual grafted onto her' (1969: 209; 1990: 178). The task of the eternal return is to effect this transformation of the individual - its qualities and actions - into the event: 'we raise each event to the power of the eternal return in order that the individual, bom of that which comes to pass, affirm her distance with respect to every other event. As the individual affirms the distance, she follows and joins it, passing through all the other individuals implied by the other events, and extracts from it a unique Event which is once again herself, or rather the universal freedom' (ibid.). This is the moment of 'eternity', not the eternity of immortality or immutability sought by the person but the eternity of the event that lives on, like a spectropoiesis and a ghost of time, never ceasing to divide into the already past and the always yet to come. Conclusion: Deleuze Beyond Weismann ('How One Becomes What One Is') One could ask an overwhelming number of questions concerning this thinking of the ethics of the event, questions at once naive, unwise, and unphilosophical and impudent. Is this ' life'? Is it 'a life' that is live-able? Is it faithful to Nietzsche? Not 81</page><page sequence="19">to the letter of Nietzsche but to his 'spirit'? Of course, Deleuze's thinking makes Nietzsche live on in an incredibly beautiful, intense, and powerful way. No other reading could, in fact, be more faithful to Nietzsche's ghost. It raises the stakes of selection to an extraordinary level of intensity. It betrays life - a certain life, a particular life, the ephemeral life of consciousness and its banalities - for the sake of another life, the intense life of the nonorganic and of the event. What could be more 'Nietzschean'? Deleuze, it has been remarked, conceded too much to life. This is an extraordinary remark, and a profound complaint. It communciates what is truly other and alien about Deleuze and what perturbs many who encounter him. Deleuze is a philosopher who ends up giving everything to life, including death, also suicide, drug use and abuse, alcoholism, schizophrenia and the people or subjects who become addicts, alcoholics, schizophrenics. But this concession - the 'too much' seeks to measure that which does not, in actuality, lend itself to measurement - only makes 'sense' when comprehended in the context of Deleuze's thought of the event. One can only concede to life the event (precisely that which cannot be calculated once and for all). Deleuze has reconfigured the Weismannian legacy that informs biophilosophical modernity, running from Bergson and Freud to our contemporaries such as Derrida, in a particular and highly novel way. The germinal life is not fixed to the continuity of the germ-plasm, but allows for cracks and fissures through which new life is possible and given a chance. Germinal life is fundamentally anti-entropic in relation to both the entropy of the river of DNA (the contemporary rendition of the germ-plasm) that is immune to external perturbations and the entropy of the Freudian death-drive (both, in effect, examples of closed systems). What is key in Deleuze is the stress on the field of pre-individual singularities that allows for the vital powers of life to express themselves beyond entropic containment. In this way he fundamentally reconfigures Weismann and invents a philosophy of life that exists beyond the opposition of absolute life and absolute death, beyond the opposition of Eros and Thanatos, and beyond good and evil. Germinal life is the life of the fold, of implication, explication, and complication. Of course, one can still deploy in connection to it the neo Darwinian language of vehicles and replicators (organisms and genes on the well known model of Richard Dawkins). In Deleuze's conception of germinal life, for example, organisms become vehicles for the transmission of intensities and singularities or haecceities. The event does not relate the lived to a transcendent subject = Self, he writes, T^ut, on the contrary, is related to the immanent survey of a field without subject...' (Deleuze and Guattari 1991: 49; 1994: 48) (the notion of self survey is taken from the work of the French philosophical biologist Raymond Ruyer). Deleuze maintains to the end, for example, that a singular haecceity, a life of pure immanence that is neutral and beyond good and evil, is only prevented from becoming what it is by the subject that incarnates it and makes it good or bad. Subjects in this logic of life, then, become bearers of singularities and intensities, they are both created by them and destroyed by them.19 Living for the event does not, however, amount to affirming the nihilism of the subject. Singularities and intensities do not subordinate the continuity of life to a simple 'reproduction' of the same. The logic of the event is a logic of nuances, of co-implication and co-evolution between 82</page><page sequence="20">the organism and the field of individuation it is implicated in, while the continuity is always heterogeneous, involving the repetition of vital differences, their living on and not their 'living off (Freud). This is Bergson, for example, working out the relation between his conception of creative evolution and the legacy of Weismann: There is no doubt that life as a while is an evolution, that is, an unceasing transformation. But life can progress only by means of the living, which are its depositaries. Innumerable living beings, almost alike, have to repeat each other in space and in time for the novelty they are working out to grow and mature...Heredity does not only transmit characters; it transmits also the impetus in virtue of which the characters are modified, and this impetus (elan) is vitality itself (Bergson 1962: 232; 1983: 231). The best way to think of the ethics of return as an ethics of the event (an ethics 'beyond' the subject) is in terms of the central paradoxical formulations Nietzsche surrounds his doctrine on 'how one becomes what one is' with, such as: (a) one must not have the faintest idea what one 'is' (one is a 'becoming', understood in Deleuze's sense of the fractured T and the dissolved self, which refers to the death-drive that is peculiar to the eternal return), and (b) one wants only to love everything that has happened to one, wanting nothing to be different (an event that makes all the difference). There can be no greater danger, Nietzsche insists, than catching sight of oneself with the task of becoming what one is (necessity, a piece of fate). There only persists the event of becoming. Perhaps it is in the thought of the event that we can discover and invent the meaning of Nietzsche's cryptic formulation that in order to understand anything at all of his 'Zarathustra' one must have one foot beyond life - not, I would suggest, one foot in the grave but one foot in the event. Nietzsche expresses the fatality of a non-heroic life in the form of a riddle, a riddle that captures what is at play in Deleuze's heredity of the crack: as one's father one is already dead, while as one's mother one continues to live and grow. This dual inheritance complicates the heredity of life, offering the chance and necessity of attaining 'freedom from party in relation to the total problem of life' (Nietzsche 1979: 38). It is a critical and clinical modernity that Nietzsche is putting to the test here, requiring the subtle sense and sensibility 'for signs of ascent and descent' in which one knows both for one is - and becomes - both. This dual task requires the complex art of seeing with more than one pair of eyes, it requires an enhanced perspectivism: looking 'from a morbid perspective towards healthier concepts and values, and again conversely to look down from the abundance and certainty of rich life into the secret labour of the instinct of decadence...1 (ibid.: 39-40). Deleuze has shown us better than any other reader of Nietzsche, I believe, what this 'secret' labour refers to and involves. This is the secret labour of inventing oneself as an event, 'mixing up nothing, "reconciling" nothing...the art of dividing without making inimical...a tremendous mulitiplicity which is nonetheless the opposite of chaos...' (ibid.: 65). One does not know what is growing inside one until one day capacities and powers 'leaps forth' ripe 'in their final perfection'. Living life - and death - as the event requires living 'beyond intention'; there is only the 'mere waiting' so that one enters involuntarily into the world 'of exalted and delicate things' (ibid.: 42). Such a life requires that we learn to become physicists of the higher human nature, of those that we are, stylists of nature, and creators of concepts of life that enjoy and affirm the 83</page><page sequence="21">beatitude of the living beyond'. This is a life beyond ephemerality, a life that enjoys the eternity of the event and its eternal return. Living the event means living those 'superior durations' beyond the human condition, it 'is' a life of immanence20: We can not foresee, we must take risks and endure the longest possible time, we must not lose sight of the grand health (Deleuze 1969: 188; 1990: 161). * This essay forms part of a book I am working on that bears the working title Germinal Life: The Difference and Repetition of Deleuze, and which one day may see the light of day as its special dawn or daybreak. The denouement to this essay owes a great deal to my dialogues with James Williams about the matter of Deleuze, the event, and matters of life and death. 84</page><page sequence="22">Bibliography Badiou, A.

The Nachlass notes, however, clearly reveal the weight of transformation Nietzsche placed on this thought, including the weight of a great politics, the weight of a cultivating thought that aims to ensure that all other modes of thought will perish, and the weight of a new, non-Darwinian selective principle that is to be placed in the service of strength and barbarism (see Nietzsche 1968: 544ff). 2 I fear that in this essay it is only possible to give an 'impression' of what it might mean to think the eternal return as the event, since my deployment of Deleuze's concepts is highly condensed (the event itself, but also 'individuation', 'intensities', 'singularities', the 'virtual', and so on). In The Logic of Sense Deleuze deploys the thought of the event through a reading of Stoic doctrine, as well as the philosophy of Leibniz, in which it serves to denote neither an attribute nor a quality of subject but rather the incorporeal predicate of a subject of the proposition (so instead of saying 'the tree is green' one would say 'the tree greens'). In his book on Leibniz (The Fold, 1988/1993) he attempts to unfold the 'meaning' of the event once again in terms of Leibniz's chief principles, namely, the principle of sufficient reason and the principle on the identity of indiscernibles. He seeks to show that the predicate is above all a relation and an event. Predication is not attribution but rather a movement and a change: That the predicate is a verb...irreducible to the copula and the attribute, mark the very basis of the Leibnizian conception of the event (Vevenement)' (1988: 71; 1993: 53). Such a conception of thought and event necessarily leads to a dramatic reworking of the notion of substance, since it no longer denotes the subject of an attribute but rather the inner unity of an event and the active unity of change. This is precisely how Bergson conceives of the substance 'of duration: 'There are movements, but there is no inert or invariable object which moves...' (Bergson 1965: 147). This is relevant to comprehending what is at stake in Nietzsche's attack on duration in 'Reason in Philosophy' in Twilight of the Idols. What Nietzsche is attacking there is the idea that there is a substance (an essence) behind duration (as in the metaphysical superstition of a doer behind the deed). But if the only substance is the movement peculiar to duration (no subject of a predicate, only predication) then Nietzsche's thinking and Bergson's are in total agreement on this point. For further insight into Deleuze's concept of the event see: the helpful remarks in Paul Patton's introduction to his Deleuze Critical Reader (1996: 12-14), the superb and critical essay by Badiou (1994), and Boundas's incisive essay (1994: esp. 105-6). On 'intensity' see Bergson 1960: chapter 1, and also Kant Critique of Pure Reason A169/B211; and, in relation to Kant and Bergson, Deleuze 1968: 286ff; 1994: 222ff: 'Everything which happens...is correlated with orders of differences: differences of level, temperature, pressure, tension, potential, difference of intensity'. On 'singularities' see Badiou 1994, 89</page><page sequence="27">and the fifteenth and sixteenth series in Deleuze's Logic of Sense. 3 In Creative Evolution (1907) Bergson construes life as like a current passing from germ to germ through the medium of a developed organism[ (Bergson 1962: 27; 1983: 27). Life appears in the form of an organism as if the organism were only an 'excrescence, a bud caused to sprout by the former germ endeavouring to continue itself in a new germ' (ibid.). Such an insight, however, should not be taken to indicate that the invention 'of * the organism is not treated seriously by Bergson. For him an organism is a complex ensemble that does not simply 'adapt' to its environment but actively 'replies'. Here his approach anticipates many of the moves associated with contemporary developments in biology, notably in complexity theory. 4 Of all the recent commentators it is Badiou who comes closest to making this insight when he notes that for Deleuze the event denotes 'an immanent activity over a background of totality, a creation, a novelty certainly, but thinkable within the interiority of the continuous. Un elan vita? (1994: 60). For Badiou's reading of eternal return in Deleuze see 1997: 101ff.,esp. 113-116. 5 Deleuze writes: 'Contrary to what is stated by the banal propositions of consciousness, thought thinks only on the basis of an unconscious...' (1968: 257; 1994: 199). This demotion of consciousness does not, however, involve erecting an opposition between thought and the unconscious drives and affects. Deleuze is quite explicit on this point: The model implies no devaluation of Thought relative to Extension, but merely a devaluation of consciousness relative to thought (Deleuze 1968:236; 1990: 257). The Bergsonian-Nietzschean critique of consciousness that informs Deleuze's revaluation here rests on the insight that consciousness is merely superficial, a faculty for regularizing and homogenizing experience, making equal what is different, and making general what is singular. Consciousness can only experience effects, not 'causes', and it makes the double mistake of then identifying these effects as causes (according to Nietzsche every proposition of religion and morality contains this error). It is concerned with the world of the familiar and the normal, and often finds itself assaulted by the strange and the uncanny - by what is 'outside' normal experience. It is, says Nietzsche, the 'genius of the species' translated into the morality of the herd (Nietzsche 1974: section 354). Thought still lives in Deleuze; indeed, one could argue that it lives more intensely, productively, and inventively than it does in the overt philosophies of consciousness and self-consciousness which have characterized most of philosophic modernity. 6 In his essays of 1993 gathered together as Critique et Clinique Deleuze will become even more unorthodox in his reading of the history of thought, claiming Spinoza to be the true founder of critique and then naming his four successors as: Nietzsche, Artaud, Kafka, and Lawrence (1993: 158). 90</page><page sequence="28">7 In Difference and Repetition Deleuze links together Simondon's reworking of individuation (1964) with Darwin's thinking on the origin of species, Weismann's thesis on the continuity of the germ-plasm, and the embryology of von Baer. For detailed analysis of the links Deleuze is making see my forthcoming Germinal Life (Routledge 1999). 8 It is at this point that Deleuze distances himself from Foucault. In an essay published in 1994 on 'Desire and Pleasure' Deleuze tells of the time he and Foucault last met, with Foucault saying he could not 'bear' the word 'desire', and with Deleuze replying that he found the word 'pleasure' almost intolerable (Deleuze 1997a: 189). 9 In Difference and Repetition, however, Deleuze does advance at one point in the text a very precise conception of pleasure, maintaining that the reason why pleasure is able to serve, after Freud, as a principle of thought, and not simply as an element in our psychic life, is because of its role in the contemplation that characterizes the sub representational 'evolution' of the larval self. He argues that if we accept that an organism is a sum of contractions, retentions, and expectations in its receptive and perceptual dimensions, as well as in its viscera, then pleasure can be construed on this model as the beatitude' associated with the passive syntheses that inform the becoming of the 'self: '...we are all Narcissus in virtue of the pleasure (auto-satisfaction) we experience in contemplating, and even though we contemplate things quite apart from ourselves...We must always first contemplate something else - the water, or Diana, or the woods - in order to be filled with an image of ourselves' (1968: 102; 1994: 74-5). 10 Deleuze acknowledges the philosophical writings of Duns Scotus (c. 1266-1308) as the source for the word 'haecceity', where it names 'individuating difference' (Duns Scotus 1987:4 &amp; 166). The word can also be found deployed in Leibniz's 'Discourse on Metaphysics' of 1686, where it names individual substances that can only be known in their complete virtual form by God (Leibniz 1973: 19). In Deleuze it has no reference to either subject or substance; on the contrary, it endeavours to deprive both of these notions of their efficacy in order to grant primacy to a mode of individuation which is not that of a definite person, determined subject, or a formal substance. This mode is the haecceitas which concerns longitudinal relations of movement and rest between molecules/particles and latitudinal capacities of affect and affectedness. These absolute individuals or haecceities refer to degrees and intensities that combine with other degrees and intensities, and which, although irreducible to a subject, nevertheless compose an individual. For example, a degree of heat is an individuated warmth that is distinct from the so-called 'subject' that constitutes it. Similarly, times and lengths of day are not actually extensions but rather degrees or modulations. 11 '...the Freudian conception of the death-instinct, understood as a return to inanimate matter, remains inseparable from the positing of an ultimate term, the model of a material and brute repetition, and the conflictual dualism between life and death' 91</page><page sequence="29">(Deleuze 1968: 137; 1994: 103^). Deleuze further contends that Freud's model of death suffers from being individualist, subjective, soiipsistic and monadic. It concerns a 'difference', that of the ego or self (the One), which only deserves to perish. He will go on to insist that the unconscious is not governed by either degradation or contradiction, which leads him to proposing an entirely different conception of the workings of the unconscious: not involved in limitation and opposition and conflict but rather informed by 'questioning and problematising'. He is thus able to declare: The celebrated phrase "the unconscious knows no negative" must be taken literally' (ibid.: 143; 108). 12 Gillian Rose argues that death, like repetition, enjoys two meanings in Freud: on the one hand it is linked, negatively, with the compulsion to repeat, and amounts to a blocked memory and a passive relation to death; on the other hand it is linked, positively, to the risking of one's life, the 'daring death' that heralds a 'perfect memory', an 'active relation to death' and a positive repetition forwards (see Rose 1992: 104, 109). But what this distinction between two deaths fails to appreciate is the extent to which for Freud the active desire for death, through the risking of life (one's own and that of others), is equally implicated in regression and the latent destructive tendencies of the instincts (enduring life by preparing oneself for death means, says Freud in the 1915 essay, taking 'the backward step') (Rose recognizes this in the case of the Beyond the Pleasure Principle' essay but restricts it to this piece). I think the reason why Rose is misguided in her reading of Freud on death is because she pays insufficient attention to what is at stake in Freud's 1915 essay. Freud writes the essay in order to 'overcome', or work through, the sense of disillusionment which has accompanied the onset of war among those who are not combatants and cogs in the huge machine of war. How can the unexpected, the worst, happen in the midst of European civilization? How could the 'world-dominating nations of the white race' regress to such tribal instincts and brutality? The aim is to learn something ancient and buried about death from this destructive experience. We are to discover that war gives way to dis-illusionment only because it is the result of fundamental illusion regarding the real character of life, a truth hidden to us by the veneer of civilization. In this essay Freud does not simply declare the unconscious to be ignorant of death, but rather ascribes to it a lust for annihilation and war. On the one hand, the unconscious, Freud says, does not believe in its own death but considers itself to be immortal. The deepest strata of our minds that is made up of only so-called 'instinctual impulses' is said to know 'nothing negativc.no negation' (Freud 1987: 85). In this denial of death deep within our unconscious there resides, speculates Freud, the 'secret' and illusion of heroism. On the other hand, the unconscious houses the desires of the ultimate paranoid monad that is full of death-wishes towards strangers and outsiders. In our unconscious impulses we thus 'daily and hourly get rid of anyone who stands in our way...The expression "Devil take him!"...which really means "Death take him!", is in our unconscious a serious and powerful death wish' (ibid.: 86). Our unconscious, says Freud, murders over trifles and can be compared to the Athenian code of Draco which knows only death as the punishment for some perceived crime (in this case, the crime of being strange, a stranger, to the 'unconscious'). It is such an 'insight' which leads Freud to declare that 'if we are to be judged by our unconscious wishful impulses, we ourselves are, like primeval man, a gang of murderers' (ibid.). It is on the basis of these claims that Freud then arrives at his so-called 'positive' or affirmative 92</page><page sequence="30">conception of death. War, Freud tells us, strips away from us the 'later accretions of civilisation', so laying bare before each and every one of us our real primeval self. Moreover, it 'compels us to be heroes who cannot believe in their own death; it stamps strangers as enemies, whose death is to be brought about or desired...' (ibid.: 88). The issue for Freud, therefore, is not one of abolishing war but, on the contrary, adapting ourselves to its inescapable and positive reality and affirming the primeval pleasures it allows the self that risks life to indulge in, notably the destruction of what is outside and strange to itself - hence his affirmation in this essay of the war between nations as a war of strangers. This, Freud notes with due cruel irony, amounts to a positive regression (war brings about an 'involution', ibid.: 74), one which at least has 'truth' on its side. The illusion that we can live life without us all being, at some point in time, mass murderers is what makes life intolerable, Freud challenges. 13 In a recent reading of the death-drive, as it figures in Freud and Lacan, Zizek takes the drastic step of divorcing it from the unconscious altogether, marking it as the site of the symbolic order. On this reading the drive is not to be defined in terms of a simple opposition between life and death since its space is occupied by, on the one hand, the monstrous split within life itself between ordinary or normal life and 'horrifying "undead" life', and, on the other hand, that within death between the ordinary dead and the 'undead' machine. Like Deleuze and Guattari in Anti-Oedipus, Zizek wishes to separate the Freudian death-drive from any Heideggerian 'being-towards-death', but maintains that, although the drive itself is 'immortal, eternal, "undead" (the annihilation towards which the death drive tends is not death as the unsurpassable limit of man qua finite being'), death belongs, along with mortality, to the domain of consciousness. For the unconscious there is no death-anxiety since such anxiety belongs only to consciousness (Zizek 1997: 89; see also Zizek's Lacanian remarks on the death-drive - it is not a biological fact but 'defines la condition humaine..' - in Zizek 1989: 4-5; and on its complex relation to the symbolic order, ibid.: 131-6). 14 The simulacrum', Deleuze writes, 'is not a degraded copy. It harbors a positive power (puissance positive) which denies the original and the copy, the model and the reproduction' (1969: 302; 1990: 262). Furthermore, it 'is not even enough to invoke a model of the Other, for no model can resist the vertigo of the simulacrum' (1969: 303; 1990: 262). 15 In Deleuze's reading of Zola Weismann's well-known distinction between the two plasms, soma and germ (a distinction that fully informs Freud's positing of the duality of life and death-drives in Beyond the Pleasure Principle), operates as a distinction between a love or a body which dies and a movement which creatively 'evolves' through germinal intensity. This is a movement from the organized body of the organism to the 'body without organs' which involves the releasement of singularities and intensities from entropic containment (Deleuze 1969: 384; 1990: 331). But the two exist in implication and complication; this is life and death lived and died from 'within the folds' or 'on the train' as in Zola's La Bete Humaine (published in 1890 as the seventeenth of the twenty 93</page><page sequence="31">novels that make up the Rougon-Macquart cycle), where the machine functions as the pure death instinct: The instincts or temperaments no longer occupy the essential position. They swarm about and within the train, but the train itself is the epic representation of the death-instinct' (ibid.). In the novel the train is undoubtedly depicted in terms of the demonic power of a death-drive: '...the train was passing, in all its stormy violence, as if it might sweep away everything that lay in its path...It was like some huge body, a giant creature laid out on the ground...past it went, mechanical, triumphant, hurtling towards the future with mathematical rigour, determinedly oblivious to the rest of human life on either side, life unseen and yet perennial, with its eternal passions and its eternal crimes' (Zola 1996: 44). Unlike the murder of the husband in Therese Racquin, committed by Therese and Laurent simply because he stands in their way and is an inconvenience, Zola's aim in La Bete Hwnaine was to link murder with an ancient hereditary impulse buried over by the sedimented layers of civilization, to show the 'caveman' dwelling deep within the civilized man of modernity, as he put it in a letter to a Dutch journalist. In the novel the 'hereditary crack' is not simply a matter of ill-health but is said to be involved in those 'sudden losses of control' that lie deep within our being 'like fractures, holes' through which the self seeks escape, losing itself 'in the midst of a kind of thick haze that bent everything out of shape' (Zola 1996: 53). At such moments as these, where the self is no longer the master of its own body but the obedient servant of one's muscles and the 'rabid beast within', one is forced into paying back an ancient debt: '...paying for the others, for the fathers and grandfathers who had drunk, for the generations of drunkards, of whose blood he was the corrupt issue...paying the pirce of a gradual poisoning, of a relapse into primitive savagery that was dragging him back into the forest...' (ibid.). The extent to which Zola's novel, with its stress on a hereditary regression and atavistic instincts, anticipates both Freud's conception of death (1915) and his positing of the death-drive (1920) by several decades is indeed remarkable. On Deleuze's reading, however, the complicated investment of the erotic instincts in destructive ones - Zola's novel was read in the precise terms of this complication on its publication - expresses not simply the noise of primal instincts caught up in an involution but rather the silent echoes of a repetition that drives us ever on forward and upward. This is why for him the key actor or agent in the novel is the train itself (a field of action, a body without organs distributing intensities and producing transformations). The train is a creation of modern civilization but it is also the crack which derails it, making sure that it is the 'great health' which lives on in humanity (the dissolutions of the novel, it should be noted, take place against the backdrop of the dying days of the Second Empire). Michel Serres is incisive in detecting in Zola's epic series of novels with its cycle of destruction, waste, dispersion, irreversible ebbing towards death, disorder and degeneration, revolving around in La Bete Hwnaine a veritable thermodynamics of the train, an 'epic of entropy' (see Serres 1975: 78; see also 1983: 39ff.). Such an insight, however, discloses on Deleuze's reading only half of the story. Deleuze's conception of germinal life aims to demonstrate that entropy is never the final word. Thermodynamics always needs to be linked up with good sense since it shares the same characteristics: the single direction, that this direction go from the most to the least differentiated, from the singular to the regular, and from the remarkable to the ordinary, so orienting 'the arrow of time from past to future, according to this determination' (1969: 94; 1990: 76). 94</page><page sequence="32">16 Does the wound exist apart from its becoming and its memory? Is memory both the wound and the overcoming of the wound? As Deleuze notes, 'A scar is the sign not a past wound but of "the present fact of having been wounded'" (Deleuze 1969: 105; 1994: 77). On the memory of wounds see Lawrence, especially 1995b: 261: 'But why the memory of the wounds and the death? Surely Christ rose with healed hands and feet, sound and strong and glad? Surely the passage of the cross and the tomb was forgotten? But no - always the memory of the wounds, always the smell of grave-cloths? A small thing was Resurrection, compared with the Cross and the death, in this cycle'. See also Nietzsche in the foreword to Twilight of the Idols: 'A maxim whose origin I withold from learned curiosity has long been my motto: increscunt animi, virescit volnere virtus' ('the spirit grows, strength is restored by wounding'). 17 In facing the event of death with a great refusal Very Little, Almost Nothing provides a powerful and eloquent account of, and testimony to, the profound limitedness of the human condition. 18 According to Deleuze, Nietzsche's perspectivism operates as an art of inclusive disjunctions, in which divergence is not a principle of exclusion and disjunction is not a means of separation; rather, incompossibility 'is now a means of communication' (Deleuze 1969: 203; 1990: 174). Deleuze stresses that in the case of inclusive disjunctions it is not a question of making the disjunction a conjunction; rather, it remains a disjunction that continues to bear on divergence: 'But this divergence is affirmed in such a way that the either...or itself becomes a pure affirmation. Instead of a certain number of predicates being excluded from a thing in virtue of the identity of its concept, each "thing" opens itself up to die infinity of predicates through which it passes, as it loses its center, that is, its identity as concept or as self. The communication of events replaces the exclusion of predicates' (ibid.). The 'schizo' experience or becoming, for example, 'is and remains in disjunction', not reducing two contraries to an identity of the same, but affirming their 'distance as that which relates the two as different' (Deleuze and Guattari 1972: 96; 1984: 76-7). Perspectivism, on Deleuze's reading, is not a relativism, in which truth would vary according to the subject in question; rather, perspectives denote the conditions within which 'the truth of a variation appears to the subject' (Deleuze 1988: 27; 1993: 20). 19 One should consult the astute remark by Francois Zourabichvili in this regard: 'Yet nevertheless, there is no life, and therefore no health, without a minimal organism. Life is non-organic, but its relation to the organism is one of reciprocal presupposition: it builds a house in order to take flight from it, it is House-Cosmos, a house standing against the cosmos, tuned in to the cosmos, haunting as much as inhabiting it' (1996: 198). We should also note the extent to which Bergson's thinking of the matter of a 'creative evolution' is governed by the play between the solidified life of the organism and the excessive life of the germ and nonorganic forces. 95</page><page sequence="33">20 In short piece entitled 'Immanence: A Life...', written in 1993, Deleuze argues that the transcendental field needs to be mapped out as a 'life' that involves neither subject nor object but rather 'an absolute immediate consciousness whose very activity no longer refers back to a being but ceaselessly posits itself in a life* (Deleuze 1997b: 4). This, says, Deleuze, is the immanence of the late Fichte (the text Deleuze of Fichte's referred to is Die Anweisung zum seligen Leben, oder auch die Religionslehre of 1806, appearing in French as Initiation a la vie bienheureuse). It is the impersonal but singular iife of the individuating haecceity (the Tjeatitude' in the title of Fichte's work). This is a germinal life since it is not positing life in a 'simple moment' confronting a 'universal death' but rather a life that is 'everywhere', contained 'in all the moments' that a 'living subject passes through', a life of virtualities, events, and singularities (ibid.: 5). It is odd, however, that Deleuze should locate in the later Fichte a renaissance of 'Spinozism' given Fichte's own declared hostility towards Spinoza and his influence (see Fichte 1994: 98-99, where he argues that Spinoza could not have believed in his own philosophy, but could only have 'thought' it). Nevertheless, in this series of popular lectures Fichte does present Being in terms akin to Spinoza's immanent substance as that 'which is absolutely through itself, by itself, and from itself...a self-comprehensive, self sufficient, and absolutely unchangeable Unity (Einerleiheit)' (1962: 53; 1848: 48-9). This is a Being that 'ex-ists' outside of Time and outsideof Becoming. The spiritual life of blessedness is the life filled with consciousness, love, and self-enjoyment. It is through the laws of reflection which govern its operations that consciousness creates a system of separate and independent individuals and so confronts itself with numerous paradoxes concerning the reality of time and change. It should be noted that Fichte's text is bound up in the moves it makes with classical metaphysics, notably the distinction between a 'true world' (life/blessedness) and an 'apparent world' (death/unblessedness). This is a distinction that Fichte presents as one between the merely sensuous world and the higher suprasensuous world that is available to, and attainable only by, Thought. It is lecture VUJ that is the most philosophically serious and which is would be the decisive one for staging an encounter between Bchte and Deleuze (ibid.: 122ff; 144 ff). See also Fichte 1987: 9Iff., where beatitude is related to the achievement of supersensible death 'in life and through life..!, which speaks of the praxis of a rational self as its peculiar 'sublime vocation'. The self-expressive life of the spiritual is one in which the universe can no longer be thought in terms of the circle 'returning to itself, that endlessly repeating game, that monster which devours itself so as to give birth to itself again as it already was'; rather, there is 'constant progress to greater perfection in a straight line which goes on to infinity'. This is because 'All death in nature is birth...in dying does the augmentation of life visibly appear...It is not death which kills, but rather a more living life which, hidden behind the old life, begins and develops* (ibid.: 122). My death can only be a festive passing. It is not, therefore, for Fichte a question of living 'according to nature' simply because this is not even what nature does. The only 'law of life' is, in Nietzsche's almost Fichtean language, 'self-overcoming'. On the world as a 'monster of energy', 'without beginning or end' but as ceaseless transformation, a world of repetition and difference (the 'joy of the circle' as the only goal), compare Nietzsche 1968: 1067 (in German, Nietzsche 1987, volume 11, pp. 610). On beatitude see also Deleuze's 'big' book on Spinoza (Deleuze 1968: 282ff ; 1990: 308ff). Clement Rosset has argued that beatitude constitutes the central and constant 96</page><page sequence="34">theme of Nietzsche's thought -1 would willingly say the only theme' (Rosset 1993: 26). Nietzsche's expression of a beat-philosophy informs the entire endeavour of 'gay science' (Nietzsche 1974: sections 276-7), with its commitment, in the eternal engagement with/to life (especially its gloom and doom), to the 'art of cheerfulness' (Heiterkeit). It would be instructive to determine the difference between types and expressions of beatitude, whether Spinozist, Fichtean, Nietzschean, or Stoic. Clearly Nietzsche's challenge resides in the attempt to think theodicy without God, a challenge most evident in his reading of Leibniz (see Nietzsche 1968: sections 411,419, 1019) (this is a move which, according to Rosset, makes Nietzsche more Leibnizian - more cheerful - than Leibniz), 97</page></plain_text>
