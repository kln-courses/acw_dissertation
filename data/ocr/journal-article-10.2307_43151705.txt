<plain_text><page sequence="1">Regicide and readers: Robbe-Grilleťs politics Until the publication of his two volumes of autobiography politics had never really been on the agenda of Robbe-Grillet's writing. The experi- mentalism and the formalism which characterize the nouveau roman seemed thoroughly a-political.1 However, with the publication of Le Miroir qui revient (in 1984) and Angélique ou l'enchantement (in 1987)2 we are confronted with a content that directly raises questions about the political colour of Robbe-Grillet's writing as a whole - not only in the new autobiographical texts, but also, retrospectively, in the previous fictional (and also filmic) works. The chief items in the overt political content of the autobiographical texts are these: Le Miroir contains an affectionate portrait of his parents who, as supporters of the Action Française, were on the far right of French politics - welcoming the Nazis in 1 940, and perversely, professing themselves more ardent Pétainistes in the 1950s than they had been under Vichy; both volumes of the autobiography have a fictional character called Henri de Corinthe whose extremist politics are flaunted by Robbe-Grillet who has him flirting with the communist party in the thirties, taking part in a cavalry charge against the German tanks in 1939 and working for the Nazis as a secret agent in London during the second world war; in terms of straight autobiographical record, Robbe-Grillet's own experience working (as many French students had to under the Vichy government) in an armaments factory in the Third Reich is interpreted as having had a decisive, if generally negative ideological and political impact on him; and finally, the autobiographies contain a series of rather petulant political remarks by Robbe-Grillet which may or may not add up to a coherent political position (I'll come back to this later), but which seem to suggest a fairly strong antipathy towards the left in general and Mitterrand's socialist government in particular. In view of all of this it seems important to go back to Robbe-Grillet's earlier work and reread it in order to try and see how far his writing might or might not constitute some kind of political project. I am not going to suggest that the autobiographies can be used as a crude critical key to unlock authorial intentions (including political intentions) from the fiction (not least because as texts the autobiographies are far too problematic to lend themselves to that kind of abuse). But Le Miroir qui revient does Paragraph Volume 13 © Oxford University Press 1990</page><page sequence="2">Regicide and readers: Robbe-Grillet's politics 45 throw down a highly polemical challenge to Robbe-Grillet's critics with its opening claim that 'Je n'ai jamais parlé d'autre chose que de moi' (io) (I have never talked about anything other than myself). Robbe-Grillet is not saying: 'I'm going to tell you all about me in this autobiography so that you can then go and see what I have really - or secretly - been talking about in my novels all the time'. Instead, when he writes, 'Je n'ai jamais parlé d'autre chose que de moi. Comme c'était de l'intérieur, on ne s'en est guère aperçu' (I have never talked about anything other than myself. As it was from inside, people barely noticed), he is seeking to provoke the critical institution, first by invoking the three-fold heresy of the myths of humanism, biographism and representation that are present in the claim (Le Miroir, io); and second, by suggesting that his critics had failed lamentably in their previous readings of his novels. In other words, the claim is designed precisely to instigate a re-reading and re-evaluation of the existing fictional corpus - a re-reading which may or may not elicit a political theme, and whose undertaking would mark one of the auto- biographies' major achievements. What I shall also be arguing here is that, over and above the political content which I shall be emphasizing, Robbe-Grillet's very demand for a critical re-evaluation can itself be read as having an important political function in so far as it is also an implicit attack on the critical ideology he ascribes to his readers. I hope in this paper to show how this might be and why it is that this attack ultimately figures at the head of the political concerns raised by the autobiographies. First, however, I want to return to Robbe-Grillet's beginnings as a writer in order to trace the emergence of these concerns, and try to work out not so much what Robbe-Grillet's politics are, but what form his politics take, and what defines the political in his world. It's a story that begins with an attempted but ultimately unsuccessful regicide, and ends with an attempt which is, I believe, equally unsuccessful, to kill the reader. And in my view, the underlying motivation behind both attempts is more or less the same. Robbe-Grillet's first novel, Un Régicide, was completed in 1949 but initially rejected for publication; it was eventually published in more or less its original form in 197 8. 3 In it the hero Boris makes at least two attempts to kill the king of the imaginary country in which he lives, and although in the end the king does seem to have died, Boris recognizes that killing a monarch makes no difference to anything, and - as if to emphasize the futility of his regicidal enterprise - he dies himself. However, in spite of the apparent futility of his action, Boris continues to regard the attempt as profoundly necessary. In his autobiography Robbe- Grillet describes regicide as 'the major political crime' {Le Miroir, 46), but</page><page sequence="3">46 Paragraph it is political not in so far as it might be motivated and justified by a set of political beliefs and strategies, but rather, in so far as it is an affirmation of the individual against the political order: 'tuer le roi (...) est une méthode sûre pour se faire reconnaître comme individu' (ibid.) (killing the king (. . .) is a sure way of getting recognition as an individual). It is not a particular politics that is the target of Boris's political crime, but politics in general. Neither he nor the king has any political affiliation, the king having no committed link with the party of the Church which is in power, and Boris none with the secret opposition group of 'fanatics' (this is his word) which his girlfriend Laura belongs to. What Boris is opposed to is the numbing effect (the 'engourdissement') of all political ideologies, for which the king is the symbol, and these effects operate regardless of their political content. Ultimately Boris succumbs to the lethal 'engourdissement' which he set out to destroy - in other words, he is killed by the effects of political ideology which Robbe-Grillet describes in the novel in terms of a disease to which its unfortunate individual victims are liable to succumb (not unlike the 'rhinoceritis' in Ionesco's Rhinocéros). But the story provides us with the outline of a model of Robbe-Grillet's politics in that it equates politics with ideology (and, more specifically, defines the political as an inevitably repressive ideology) and makes politics the target rather than the inspiration of the 'major crime' (regicide) directed against it. This aggressive depoliticizing continues in the essays in Pour un nouveau roman (written between 1953 and 1963) which are usually read as proposing the outline for an experimental programme in fictional form, proscribing the traditional components of character and plot, and foregrounding language and structure as the proper material of fiction.4 But while the essays undoubtedly are concerned with these things, the formal experiments carry on the aims of Boris' regicide in that they are also directed against a series of targets that may be ultimately defined as political. There seem to be three main areas of concern in Robbe-Grillet's theoretical essays - the demand that fiction be free from authorial engage- ment (cp. Sartre); the demand that description in the novel dispense with anthropomorphizing metaphor; and the demand that fiction abolish the outmoded forms of the nineteenth-century novel. Robbe-Grillet's defence of art in general and literature in particular is a broadly libertarian one, but unlike Sartre whose example dominated the literary scene in the early fifties, he doesn't regard literature as a means towards a libertarian end. For Robbe-Grillet art defends freedom best when it demands freedom for itself even against political and ideological programmes that may themselves have libertarian goals. Revolutionary art</page><page sequence="4">Regicide and readers : Robbe-Grilleťs politics 47 is not going to be helped by a revolutionary politics, and vice versa : 'la Révolution socialiste se méfie de l'Art révolutionnaire et, qui plus est, il n'est pas évident qu'elle ait tort' ( Pour un nouveau roman , 42) (the socialist revolution mistrusts revolutionary art, and what's more, it's not obvious that it is wrong to do so). Revolutionary art is not going to be helped by revolutionary politics, because artistic needs will always find themselves subordinated to political goals. Either political goals will impose a formal conservatism which is at odds with the formal innovation that constitutes freedom in art (Robbe-Grillet cites the example of socialist realism); or else the formal innovation of the literary will be misinterpreted by the revolutionary politicians as reactionary: Ou bien l'art n'est rien; et, dans ce cas, peinture, littérature, sculpture, musique, pourront être enrôlées au service de la cause révolutionnaire; ce ne seront plus que des instruments, comparables aux armées motorisées, aux machines-outils, aux tracteurs agricoles; seule comptera leur efficacité directe et immédiate. Ou bien l'art continuera d'exister en tant qu'art; et, dans ce cas, pour l'artiste au moins, il restera la chose la plus importante au monde. Vis-à-vis de l'action politique, il paraîtra toujours, alors, comme en retrait, inutile, voire franchement réactionnaire. (42-3) (Either art is nothing; and in this case, painting, literature, sculpture and music can be enlisted in support of the revolutionary cause; they will be no more than an instrument, comparable to motorized armies, machine tools, or agricultural tractors; all that will count will be their direct and immediate efficacy. Or else art will continue to exist as art; and in this case, for the artist at least, it will remain the most important thing in the world. In comparison with political action it will always appear marginal, useless and even frankly reactionary.) Once art is yoked to political goals it will be reduced to a purely instrumental role which Robbe-Grillet's rather loaded images define extremely negatively through their association with the Third Reich and Stalinist Russia. (The motorized army features in Le Miroir as the army of occupation, and the machine tools as those in the factory outside Nuremberg where Robbe-Grillet was conscripted as a student; the tractor, although less strictly autobiographical in origin, presumably hails from Stalin's collectivization programmes in the thirties). What Robbe-Grillet is saying here is that it is only by allowing art its freedom from political concerns that it will be in a position to achieve the goals that even the 'good' political revolutionaries are seeking: nous savons que, dans l'histoire des peuples, lui seul, cet art censément gratuit, trouvera sa place, aux côtés peut-être des syndicats ouvriers et des barricades. (43)</page><page sequence="5">48 Paragraph (we know that in the history of nations, it is only supposedly gratuitous art which will find its place, perhaps alongside the trades unions and the barricades.) The reason why Robbe-Grillet sets literature up in opposition to politics becomes clearer in the second major area of concern of Pour un nouveau roman where he deals with the question of description in the novel. In his famous essay 'Nature, humanisme, tragédie' Robbe-Grillet denounces the anthropomorphism of traditional representation in the novel and declares his campaign against metaphor. This seems oddly marginal and not a little idiosyncratic until you see that the issue is being construed as a defence of individual liberties against ideological oppression. In demanding that the 'thereness' of things be respected in literary repre- sentations of the world (this is the famous 'chosisme' of early Robbe- Grillet), he is defending their individual freedom against the repressive tyranny of ideology. When we look at the world, says Robbe-Grillet, we are not free because our view of it is distorted by ideologies that affect both us as observers and the objects themselves: c'est la liberté qui devrait (...) être possible, et qui ne l'est pas (...). A chaque instant, des franges de culture (psychologie, morale, métaphysique, etc.) viennent s'ajouter aux choses. (20, Robbe-Grillet's italics) (it is liberty which ought (. . .) to be possible, and which isn't (. . .). At every moment strands of culture (psychology, moralism, metaphysics, etc.) are added on to things.) He goes on to describe this cultural 'adding on' as a 'systematic appropriation' (21), and later he quite simply calls it a 'tyranny' (24). In resisting this process, the 'chosisme' of a Robbe-Grillet description is actually defending the freedom of things in the world against ideological distortion and oppression. And in doing so it simultaneously liberates the onlooker from the 'tyranny of [ideological] signification' by restoring his individual freedom to him: L'homme voit les choses et il s'aperçoit, maintenant, qu'il peut échapper au pacte métaphysique que d'autres avaient conclu pour lui, jadis, et qu'il peut échapper du même coup à l'asservissement et à la peur. (65) (Man looks at things and now he realizes that he can escape from the metaphysical pact which was drawn up for him long ago by others, and that in the process he can escape from slavery and fear.) Writing in the form of a chosiste description is thus a liberating dis-</page><page sequence="6">Regicide and readers: Robbe-Grilleťs politics 49 engagement (in both the French and the English sense of the word) from the tyranny of an ultimately political ideology. It is the same sort of disengagement that is entailed by Robbe-Grillet's attack on character and plot. I shan't rehearse the arguments about charac- ter and plot since they are so well known, but, translated into political terms, what Robbe-Grillet is saying is that to continue to write fiction in the Balzac- ian mould with larger-than-life characters and causal narratives is, quite simply, to maintain a complicity with the bourgeois ideology of the nine- teenth century. Dispensing with the intelligibility of character and the coherence of plot is, in short, yet another way of throwing off an ultimately political tyranny. This is because, while the fictional components of nineteenth-century fiction are of their time, those of the twentieth century are exempt from the ideological associations of their historical moment, and are construed as purely oppositional: in Robbe-Grillet's view a concern with structure and language rather than character and plot is a revolt against an old oppression rather than the vehicle of a new one.5 From all this it is clear that when Robbe-Grillet speaks of ideological tyranny he doesn't necessarily have a particular political programme in mind, such as the Nazism and Stalinism evoked by the motorized armies and agricultural tractors from whose instrumental status he is seeking to free literature. Rather ideology is synonymous with the totalizing and naturalizing effects of any vraisemblable. The vraisemblable is perceived by Robbe-Grillet as a form of oppression, first because it supports a pre- established system which is by definition at odds with the aims and wishes of individuals; and second, because political and social institutions rely heavily on systems of the vraisemblable in a way that ignores or represses individuals and their experience- as Robbe-Grillet's accounts of his various encounters with journalism, the law-courts, the censors and the academy are designed to demonstrate in the autobiography.6 Now, paraphrased in broad political terms, what Robbe-Grillet is implying in all this is: (i) freedom is not a viable political goal, because politics are always ideological and thus are fundamentally at odds with freedom. And this is so because (2) freedom is always defined in relation to the individual: in other words, there is no such thing as freedom for a class, or a group of people, which for Robbe-Grillet would be a contradiction in terms. The third point implicit in all Robbe-Grillet's thinking is the belief that there are positions outside of ideology and outside of politics which the individual and the work of art (which to all intents and purposes has the same rights and ideals as the individual) could ultimately hope to occupy, or, more precisely, to recover. The arguments and claims in Pour un nouveau roman do generally</page><page sequence="7">50 Paragraph apply to the novels of the period spanned by the essays, that is from Les Gommes (1953) to Dans le labyrinthe (1959). After 1959 Robbe-Grillet went on to produce two films (published as ciné-romans) and a collection of nouvelles, but no novel until La Maison de rendez-vous which came out in 1965. And with the appearance of La Maison de rendez-vous there seems to be a change in the way he is writing. The change has been noticed by a number of critics and it's here for example that the transition from the New Novel to the New New Novel has been located, as has the nouveau roman' s shift from modernist to the postmodernist.7 It's a shift which does alter some of the basic principles outlined in the early essays, but at bottom it is just another tactic in Robbe-Grillet's underlying disengaging, depoliticizing, de-ideologizing strategy. What has happened in the transition from the New Novel to the New New Novel is the result of a recognition on Robbe-Grillet's part that ideology is more pervasive than he had hitherto allowed: it's not enough to have non-anthropomorphic descriptions and to jettison traditional character and plot in order to keep ideology out of fiction. Instead, ideology is now recognized as an inevitable component of the novel, but it is reduced to the status of 'material' by a formal (largely ludic) structuring. La Maison de rendez-vous is full of heavily 'ideological' material: brothels and drug smuggling in a classically stereotyped Hong Kong; however, the novel disengages itself from the ideological, which is reduced to the status of 'material', by means of the non-recuperable ontological shifts between its various levels, and by the equally non-recuperable contradictions in its narrative. So that the ludic organization of the text is operating against ideology in exactly the same way that the claims for the gratuitousness of art, the chosiste descriptions and the attack on character and plot were in the programme outlined in Pour un nouveau roman and executed in the fiction of the fifties - except that in the later novels ideological material is allowed into the text before being defused, rather than being excluded from it in the first place. The novels that follow continue to use the same kind of strategy. In the case of Projet pour une révolution à New York (1970) Robbe-Grillet portrays an utterly stereotypical New York with its consumerist wealth and its squalor, its subway violence, its detectives and its terrorist conspiracies, but treats them in a way that is designed to strip them of their ideological oppression - not reinforce it. This it does again by means of purely ludic ordering of the material. In an article on the novel published at the time it came out, Robbe-Grillet explains himself as follows: Face à ces mythes modernes [the ideological stereotypes], deux attitudes sont possibles: ou bien les condamner au nom des valeurs admises (...). Ou bien alors</page><page sequence="8">Regicide and readers : Robbe-Grilleťs politics 5 1 les assumer, et, tout en les laissant à leur platitude d'images de mode, reconnaître que ces images sont autour de moi, c'est-à-dire en moi, et qu'au lieu de boucher les yeux en me voilant la face, il me reste la possibilité de jouer avec elles.8 (Confronted with these modem myths [the ideological stereotypes], two attitudes are possible: either one condemns them in the name of received values (. . .). Or else one accepts them; and while allowing them their character as fashionable images, I can acknowledge that these images are all around me, that is to say, within me, and instead of closing my eyes to them, there remains the possibility for me to play with them.) The choice seems to be between the denunciation of one myth or ideology in the name of another - which advances nothing - or to disengage from 'myths' altogether through freeplay. The idea of a purely playful response to the ideological material of the novel is central to Robbe-Grilleťs writing, and he concludes by saying that 'seules les organisations ludiques demeurent possibles' (only ludic organizations remain possible). In the case of this novel and the ones which follow it, the 'ludic organization' operates by treating the material as a source of 'generative themes' to be manipulated by the creative ordering of the writer. But behind it all, there is still the same regicidal dis-engagement in the name of the same freedom of the individual. In the Nouvel Observateur article Robbe-Grillet describes the relationship between his stereotypical material and his ludic ordering of it in terms that are at bottom very similar to those in which he discusses his 'chosiste' descriptions in Pour un nouveau roman : Désignées en pleine lumière comme stéréotypes, ces images ne fonctionneront plus comme des pièges du moment qu'elles seront reprises par un discours vivant, qui reste le seul espace de ma liberté. (My italics.) (Once they have been designated in the full light of day as stereotypes, these images will no longer function as traps, since they will be taken up by a living discourse, which remains the only space in which my freedom can operate.) The creative ordering of the writer liberates him from the oppression of stereotypes, first by unmasking them as such and stripping them of their illusory innocence, and second through the creative process itself which Robbe-Grillet still considers to be without ideological association. However, at this stage Robbe-Grillet is beginning to make problems- and ultimately these become inescapably political problems - for himself.</page><page sequence="9">52 Paragraph In an interview with Vicki Mistacco he describes how the stereotype- ludism relation works in Topologie d'une cité fantôme (1976). The stereotypical material of the novel is 'the raped virgin' which, he says, 'is really the gimmick which is in our entire civilisation, from Greek mythology to the popular novels you can buy in train stations'. The ludism is constituted by a sequence of generative puns based on the name of Gradiva: 'divan - vierge - vagin - gravide - engendra - david'.9 The problem is this: that when the punning sequence generates a series of scenes in which the virgin is repeatedly raped and violated in a particularly nasty and sadistic way, the liberating effect of Robbe-Grillet's creative and playful ordering doesn't necessarily operate for his readers who might be more inclined to accuse him of the very ideological complicity from which he claims to be extricating himself. Here the readers whose liberation had previously been the justification for Robbe-Grillet's subversive innova- tions may begin to part company with him. Robbe-Grillet is clearly aware of the problem, but he sees it from the other end on: in his view, it's not he who is guilty of ideological complicity, but his readers, and in a significant move, the one-time beneficiary of Robbe-Grillet's writing (the reader) now becomes its enemy. This is evident, for example, in the following remarks about one of Robbe- Grillet's films, where having described how his own artistic discourse is a structure consisting of fragments cut out of the ideological continuity of social discourse, he goes on to say: The danger is that of re-establishing ideological continuity so that nothing is seen in the film but what the narrative would be if it were organized according to the rules (...). An inattentive spectator conditioned by ideology would completely miss these structures of the film and would re-establish the discourse of the society in which he lives, but this discourse is not mine, and is even the opposite of mine. Because, he goes on: my parole as a writer or as a cinéaste, in my novels or in my films, is abrupt, inexplicable, non-recuperable for any correctly organized discourse.10 It is axiomatic in Robbe-Grillet's thinking that the creative parole of the writer who refuses to keep to narrative rules must necessarily be free of ideological contamination, and therefore his parole could never be used like a 'motorized army' or an 'agricultural tractor' in the service of ideological goals. If people are reading ideology into his work it is because their unreconstructed habits of reading are projecting ideology back on to</page><page sequence="10">Regicide and readers: Robbe-Grilleťs politics 53 texts whose organization is designed precisely to disengage from that ideology. He also shifts his ground on the stereotypical content of his films and novels where it involves what the readers whom he rejects would call 'pornographic' material. He accepts that he has some personal investment in this material and indeed he is quite open in his autobiography about his sexual preferences (young girls) and perversions (distinctly sadistic). So that the raped virgin ceases to be a 'gimmick of civilisation' and is acknowledged as a personal fantasy. But these fantasies become the site of a new freedom: according to Robbe-Grillet, fantasies (or what, following psycho-analytic terminology, he calls 'fantasms') are at once personal and universal but not originally ideological; however, says Robbe-Grillet, most people prefer to keep them hidden both from themselves and from others behind the ideological forms of the vraisemblable. Robbe-Grilleťs disengagement from these forms not only allows him to acknowledge his own fantasms without guilt, but also serves to guarantee the freedom which he sees as the hallmark of the fantasm itself. Or more precisely, beautiful and free as it is, the fantasm is also so elusive and so fragile that only art (or ludism) can hope to capture its qualities: De toute façon, dans sa monstrueuse et fragile grandeur, le fantasme ne se réalise pas. Sa beauté absolue, sa liberté, sont incompatibles avec les misérables imperfections contingentes. Seul, parfois, le simulacre {dans l'œuvre d'art ou dans le jeu expert) parvient à en donner quelque approximation fugace. ( Angélique , 194-5, m&gt;' italics). (In any case, the fantasm is never realized in its monstrous and fragile grandeur. Its absolute beauty and its freedom are incompatible with the wretched imperfections of contingency. Only the simulacrum (in the work of art or expert play) manages, sometimes, to convey a fleeting approximation of it.) So once again we have the idea of an original freedom (the fantasm) which needs to be salvaged from the distorting and oppressive grip of ideological form (the vraisemblable) through the liberating effects of a freely created artistic order. However, this defence doesn't solve his problems with his readers, and it certainly didn't wash in the Italian courts where his Italian distributor was prosecuted for showing Glissements progressifs du plaisir (see Angélique , 199 ff.). The tribunal is unmoved by Robbe-Grillet's line of argument and the judge upholds the prosecution case whose argument is that nudity and 'immodesty' can only be justified by the narrative requirements of the plot, and since Robbe-Grillet's plot was largely incomprehensible the many</page><page sequence="11">54 Paragraph nude scenes must inevitably be deemed to be pornographic. As the judgement in the court put it: Un artiste a le droit de montrer des scènes déshabillées, voire impudiques, mais à la condition expresse que ces scènes soient justifiées par les nécessités de l'intrigue. Nous avons vu le film du sieur Grillet, et nous n'avons absolument rien compris à l'intrigue, qui ne comporte aucune nécessité dans l'enchaînement des scènes. Les nombreux passages déshabillés qu'il contient ne sont donc que de la simple por- nographie. ( Angélique , 201) (An artist has the right to show scenes of nudity and even immodesty, but on the express condition that these scenes are justified by the needs of the plot. We have seen the film by Signor Grillet, and we were completely unable to understand the plot whose scenes are not linked by any logical necessity. The numerous nude scenes which it contains are therefore pure pornography.) In Robbe-Grillet's view this judgement completely reverses his own definition of pornography and is based on sheer ideological obtuseness. As far as he is concerned his film was condemned not for its so-called pornographic content, but for its lack of narrative vraisemblance - or, as he puts it, 'pour cause de non-narrativité (zoé) (for non-narrativity). Moreover, in his eyes, it is not just the Italian courts of law who misread Robbe-Grillet's creative parole on the subject of sexual fantasy, but the feminists ('nos amazones à oeillières', 209) (our blinkered amazons) whose view he regards as equally bigoted in its own ideological way. There would be much to be said about Robbe-Grillet from a feminist perspective, but for my present purposes feminism figures as a convenient focus for Robbe-Grillet's increasing sense of the reader as ideological enemy: although the 'pornographic' aspects of Robbe-Grillet's work tend to mobilize the particular hostilities of particular groups (feminists, for example), he clearly regards ideological recuperation of any kind by any readers as a serious threat to all aspects of his work. Robbe-Grillet seems to have become more and more sensitive to this threat and to regard it as more and more widespread; it certainly haunts the two volumes of autobiography. Indeed, I would suggest that the move from fiction to autobiography is itself a response to Robbe-Grillet's anxieties about ideological recuperation, and is exploited as a means of countering it.11 At any rate to judge from Le Miroir and Angélique, it seems that there are four major areas from which this threat is seen to come: the first is represented by overtly political literary criticism (Marxist, feminist); the second by any discourse that relies on the traditional assumptions of the vraisemblable ( viz the Italian law courts).</page><page sequence="12">Regicide and readers: Robbe-Grillet's politics 55 The third and the fourth are new to Robbe-Grillet's thinking, the third being the ideology spawned by the shifts brought by historical change and the fourth, ironically, is the critical ideology of the nouveau roman itself. Robbe-Grillet repeatedly anticipates and rebuffs political readings of his work which he describes as a trap for readers with recuperative intentions: the modern novel, he says, is constructed as 'un piège à multiple détente, piège pour lecture humaniste, pour lecture politico-marxiste ou freudienne' (Le Miroir, 4 1 ) (a trap with multiple springs, a trap for humanist readings, politico-Marxist or Freudian readings). These readings all pose a threat to the text because of their recuperative power which is based on an ideology that would treat all novels as 'mechanized armies' or 'agricultural tractors' and recruit them into the service of a goal of its own. The second source of threat is also familiar from the arguments of Pour un nouveau roman : the narrative vraisemblable invoked by the censorship tribunal in Venice and which Robbe-Grillet says is defended by the guardians of ideology in schools and universities. It is to resist the threat of academic recuperation that the autobiographies defy narrative coherence through their con- struction as a set of heterogeneous fragments that systematically blur the autobiographical and the fictional. More interesting is the third source of recuperative threat, because in recognizing it Robbe-Grillet is acknowledging for the first time that his work might be affected by the historical situation in which it finds itself. There are a number of occasions in the autobiography where Robbe- Grillet comments that the subversive character of a particular remark or position of his has been undermined by a historical change in ideology. For example, he says of his opening heresy ('I have never talked about anything other than myself') that between 1977 when he first wrote it and the early eighties when he came back to his autobiographical project there had been a return to values that made such a claim perfectly unexceptionable ( Le Miroir, 9-10). Similarly the flaunting of his family's right-wing politics in the face of what he chooses to view as a largely leftist readership no longer has the shock-effect that it once had before the arrival of a socialist government, because the oppositional reflexes of the intellectuals will automatically shift them to the right in the face of a government of the left: il me semble que le scandale s'en [of his family's politics] effrite plus rapidement qu'on n'imaginait. Qui cela peut-il encore choquer aujourd'hui? A présent que le 'socialisme' est au pouvoir en France, tous les intellectuels mal-pensants vont bientôt se retrouver à droite, après un bref purgatoire de silence. (Le Miroir, 57-8)</page><page sequence="13">56 Paragraph (it seems to me that its scandalous aspect [his family's politics] is evaporating faster than one could have imagined. Who is likely to be still shocked by it today? Now that 'socialism' is in power in France, all the unorthodox intellectuals are going to find themselves on the right, after a brief purgatory of silence.) This sense that ideology moves with the times and could legitimate all sorts of unanticipated recuperations is extremely disquieting for a writer for whom writing had always been by definition avant-garde , at least one jump ahead of what he viewed as the inherent conservatism of ideologies. Equally disquieting for Robbe-Grillet seems to be his recognition that the critical polemic of his essays, interviews and lectures has itself become institutionalized as an ideology. The function of the autobiography will therefore in part be to extricate him from an orthodoxy of his own making which he now dismisses as '[de] rassurantes niaiseries' (reassuring silliness). He rejects the programme outlined in Pour un nouveau roman because in being 'bureaucratized' by the literary institution the theory has been stripped of the revolutionary quality which it had in the fifties: Si je me décide aujourd'hui à les combattre, c'est qu'elles me paraissent avoir fait leur temps: elles ont perdu en quelques années ce qu'elles pouvaient avoir de scandaleux, de corrosif, donc de révolutionnaire, pour se ranger dorénavant parmi les idées reçues, alimentant encore le militantisme gnangnan des journaux de mode, mais avec leur place déjà préparée dans le glorieux caveau de famille des manuels de littérature. (If I have decided to attack them now, it is because they seem to me to have had their day: within the past few years they have lost their scandalous, corrosive and revolutionary character, and have joined the 'idées reçues', still a part of the whining militantism of the fashionable journals, but assured already of their place in the glorious family vault of the manuals of literary history.) And the conclusion he draws is this: L'idéologie, toujours masquée, change facilement de figure. C'est une hydre- miroir, dont la tête coupée reparaît bien vite à neuf, présentant à l'adversaire son propre visage, qui se croyait vainqueur. (Le Miroir, 1 1 ) (The face of ideology, which is always masked, changes very easily. It is a hydra- mirror, whose head grows back again very quickly after being cut off, presenting the enemy who thought he was the victor, with his own face.) Clearly, things have turned out to be more complicated than Robbe- Grillet thought when he was writing his 'chosiste' descriptions, or even when he was constructing the ludic order of La Maison de rendez-vous .</page><page sequence="14">Regicide and readers: Robbe-Grilleťs politics 57 But his underlying strategy remains largely unchanged. He is still defend- ing the cause of his individual freedom, which is still synonymous with the writing of the literary text, and ideological oppression is still the enemy of this freedom. Robbe-Grilleťs job has become harder but it is still basically the same job; all that has changed is that the oppression has multiplied and diversified, and now has to be anticipated as something that might happen in the future and isn't necessarily confined to the historical past. The many-headed hydra of ideology is, in part at least, Robbe-Grilleťs readership, and his writing has become a campaign of terror directed against his readers' recuperations. He accepts his readers as an un- fortunate necessity which he tries to turn to his advantage by making his text a trap to catch them in. Writing becomes a device which par les formes mêmes du récit, va conduire aussitôt à frustrer le lecteur, à l'appâter puis à le décevoir, à lui montrer sa place dans le texte en même temps qu'à l'en exclure (. . .); elle devra seulement 'fonctionner', dans la transparente étrangeté d'un piège à multiple détente, piège pour lecture humaniste, pour lecture politico-marxiste ou freudienne, etc., et, pour finir, piège pour amateur de structures dépourvues de sens. (Le Miroir , 41 ) (through the very forms of the narrative, will immediately lead the reader to being frustrated, lured in and then disappointed, to being shown his place in the text while he is simultaneously excluded from it (...); it should only 'operate' with the transparent strangeness of a trap with multiple springs, a trap for humanist readings, for politico-Marxist or Freudian readings, etc., and finally, a trap for devotees of structure devoid of meaning.) The text might not be a motorized tractor or a machine tool, but the above suggests with chilling euphoria that it is now undoubtedly designed as a machine of awesome complexity capable of putting its readers through the mill of every conceivable abuse. And in Angélique Robbe-Grillet goes so far as to claim the right, Hercules-like, actually to kill his many-headed readers: Contrairement à l'homme désirant le désir d'un autre, le romancier a le droit de tuer son lecteur. D'autres lecteurs viendront prendre la relève, pour le reconnaître, à travers tous les siècles. Car, paradoxalement, il n'y aura pas de dernier lecteur. ( Angélique , 84) (Unlike the man who desires the desire of another, the novelist has the right to kill his readers. As the centuries go on, other readers will take over and give him recognition. For, paradoxically, there will never be a last reader.) Although this undisguised hostility towards readers seems to have taken us into a new sphere of engagement, the killing of readers who will</page><page sequence="15">58 Paragraph inevitably be replaced by others brings us back full circle again to the beginning since it so closely recalls the regicide of Robbe-Grillet's first hero, Boris. Robbe-Grillet's repeated, if futile, violence against his readers is like Boris's repeated and futile assassination of the monarch. Both are the targets of a political crime, both the victims of the aggressive depoliticizing of art. And yet readers prove to be very like kings - hydras whose heads always grow back however many times they are cut off. You might say, The reader is dead! Long live the reader! Now although I have said that the argument has come full circle I nevertheless have to recognize that my own account of it is heavily implicated in the problem I am describing. I began by trying to illustrate the where, the how and the what of Robbe-Grillet's politics, and I tried to show that his writing was conceived as a defence of individual liberty against the tyranny of ideological oppression that was supposed to take literature out of the political arena altogether. But once the reader, and the academic critic in particular, have been identified by Robbe-Grillet as one of the sources of that oppression, then my own reading becomes one of the targets anticipated by the text's violence and the terms of its discussion have to be altered. In other words, my sense of being aggressed by Robbe- Grillet's texts has incited me to respond in kind, and I shall conclude with a move which they have scripted so as to appear frankly recuperative. This may sound like pique but it's a response which the texts themselves impose as the only alternative to the passive acceptance of the role of the victim of the text-as-trap. In Le Miroir Robbe-Grillet professes indif- ference to his readers: ce livre-ci (...), qui semble s'adresser nommément au lecteur, ou même au critique, je ne suis pas si sûr de ne pas en être, comme d'habitude, l'unique cible. On crée toujours pour soi, même si l'on rêve de tirages planétaires ou de salles combles. ( 1 84-5 ) (this book (...) seems to be addressed particularly to the reader, or even to the critic, but I am not sure that I am not, as usual, its sole target. One always creates for oneself, even if one dreams of astronomical sales figures and auditoria crammed full of people.) A remark in Angélique makes it clear that this indifference is part of the desire that Robbe-Grillet attributes to Corinthe (but which is also his own) to be the 'dernier écrivain' (last writer) and so to have the last word. He claims that the writer needs to see himself as</page><page sequence="16">Regicide and readers: Robbe-Grilleťs politics 59 l'unique créateur de toute loi écrite, les tables sacrées que je brandirai face au monde comme une (. . .) oriflamme, pour mieux la violer ensuite. (37) (the sole creator of all written law, the holy tables which I shall brandish in the face of the world like a (. . .) banner, in order subsequently to violate it all the better.) Robbe-Grilleťs texts are constructed in such a way as to deny their readers any satisfactory position for their reading: one is confronted with a choice between a complicity which many now find distasteful and untenable, and a resistance which the texts themselves have defined in advance - and not without reason - as necessarily conducive to misreading. This constitutes a double-bind of the most insoluble kind. The author- reader relation in Robbe-Grillet is probably best thought of as being similar to relations between the sexes as he envisages them in that there is always a victor and a victim - even if there is sometimes also some anxiety about which is which. Authors and their readers are like men and women (although Robbe-Grillet says that heterosexuality is not obligatory, homosexuality is modelled on the heterosexual paradigm) where power is always the issue and where asymmetry is endemic to the sexual system: L'égalité des sexes dans la société future n'implique pas (...) la fadeur d'un nivellement égalitariste, d'une abolition radicale de toute différence (...). La pos- sibilité qu'existe quelque jour un couple libre (...) ne peut advenir que dans une lutte des contraires exacerbés, impliquant, au moins, le jeu de l'esclavage et de la domination. Vaincre et se soumettre. S'avouer 'chose' et contraindre. Posséder et subir . . . Il n'y a pas de vie érotique sans de tels excès, une telle injustice. {Angélique , 211) (The equality of the sexes in the society of the future doesn't imply (. . .) a wishy- washy, egalitarian levelling down, or the radical abolition of all difference (...). The possibility that there might one day exist a free couple (...) can come about only as a result of a struggle between exacerbated opposites, implying at the very least a play of enslavement and domination. Conquering and submitting. Being a 'thing' and exerting force. Possessing and being subjugated . . . There can be no eroticism without excesses of this kind, or without this kind of injustice.) These are the sado-masochistic terms of Robbe-Grilleťs erotic relations, and the forms of his writing seem to be elaborating something un- pleasantly similar for his readers who have the choice only of accepting the whip or applying it, of being a 'thing', or taking on the role of 'dominatrice, cruelle de préférence' (dominating woman, preferably cruel) whom men placing small ads in Libération are supposedly in search of</page><page sequence="17">60 Paragraph (211). It's not a happy choice, and it's the result of Robbe-Grillet's refusal to create a dialogic space for his readership. So what I want to do in the space that remains is reluctantly to take up the whip and question very briefly Robbe-Grillet's claim that his writing, its values and its strategies are inherently non-political. Politics may be cast as the enemy of Robbe-Grillet's creative and individual freedom, but he consistently uses a distinctly political vocabulary to describe his creative disengagement from politics. The term 'revolution' crops up again and again.12 And the terms 'terrorism' and 'violence' are regularly used to characterize the forms that literature takes in its opposition to politics, for example on page 9 of Le Miroir he asks (rhetorically) if the time has come to 'reprendre les actions terroristes des années 55-60?' (return to the terrorist action of the late fifties). On page 1 1 he regrets that the institu- tionalization of the nouveau roman' s critical polemic has deprived it of 'its charm and its violence '. Elsewhere he describes Barthes as 'a good terrorisť {Le Miroir , 69) and Pierre Boulez as 'a smiling terrorist ' (. Angélique , 167, all italics mine). These underlined words are all offered as terms of praise and, more significantly, if you read them as having serious political import they have distinctly anarchist overtones. Similarly, if you look at the terms of abuse that Robbe-Grillet uses to attack ideology, they also prove to have a certain political history and certain political associations. What Robbe-Grillet seems to hate most about the ideology (any ideology, all ideology) he is attacking are its collectivizing, communal implications. For instance, he has his hero Corinthe defend the artist's rights against the demands of all political ideologies that promote the notion of community: le projet socialiste (...) est aussi incompatible avec les motivations profondes de l'artiste véritable que n'importe quelle autre idéologie communautaire, généreuse ou répressive, syndicale, patriarcale, nationaliste, religieuse ou fascisante. ( Angélique , 35, my italics). (the socialist project (...) is as incompatible with the deeper motivations of the true artist as any other community-based ideology, whether it be generous or repressive, syndicalist, patriarchal, nationalist, religious or fascist.) Elsewhere he denounces ideology's claims to 'Truth' as a device that merely serves the interests of ' bureaucracy ' which he equates with 'oppression' {Le Miroir , 11). In this defence of the individual against corporatism and bureaucracy one can hear quite distinct echoes of the language of the right in France, particularly that strand of the right for which the state represents little less than a form of absolute evil.</page><page sequence="18">Regicide and readers: Robbe-Grilleťs politics 61 And moreover, in the context of the far right, even the advocacy of the literary takes on a certain political significance, since the ideology of the Action Française was born of a very literary programme, and specifically, a programme in which style rather than substance was the essence, and form inseparable from content.13 I am not suggesting that Maurras and Robbe-Grillet meant the same thing by style, merely that an emphasis on literary issues of this kind has a certain political history and a certain ideological resonance. I do not wish to press this point too far, not least because it would inevitably yield a number of contradictions. Indeed, there is already something of a contradiction between the right and the anarchism which I have identified, and there may also be a certain difficulty in reconciling Robbe-Grilleťs supposed support of the right with his regicidal ten- dencies. But it is precisely this kind of contradiction that Robbe-Grillet is using as part of his design to prevent the kind of recuperation that my suggestions about his politics constitute. And to bring the point home he has his autobiographical narrator in Angélique give up in defeat in face of the apparently unresolvable contradictions in his fictional hero Corinthe's politics. But when it comes to his (non-fictional) parents he does seem to accept that political positions can be thoroughly contradictory positions, as is very strikingly the case with his father whose politics he describes in just such contradictory terms: individualiste ombrageux, mais faisant à l'occasion des professions de foi fascisantes, anarchiste dans l'âme, mais partisan déterminé d'une monarchie absolue de droit divin (tempérée toutefois par le régicide), maréchaliste sincère - acceptant sans déplaisir de remplacer le 'Liberté. Egalité. Fraternité' de la république par la devise de l'ordre nouveau 'Travail. Famille. Patrie' - mais pourtant hostile d'instinct à tout embrigadement, quel qu'il fût. {Le Miroir, 132) (a prickly individualist, who could nevertheless on occasion make fascist professions of faith, an anarchist at heart, but a determined supporter of absolute monarchy and the divine right (tempered, however, with regicidal tendencies), a sincere Pétainiste, - who was quite happy to replace the republican 'Liberty. Equality. Fraternity.' with the slogan of the new order 'Work. Family. Fatherland.' - but at the same time was instinctively hostile to being recruited to the ranks of any cause whatever.) If my diagnosis is right, Robbe-Grillet junior seems to have inherited quite a lot of his politics from Robbe-Grillet père , and the paternal example suggests that contradictions are no obstacle to political beliefs. But not only</page><page sequence="19">62 Paragraph does Robbe-Grillet refuse to acknowledge that these political positions might have any application to himself; he also fails to draw any lessons from his father's own political experience. For although his father was too eccentric and too much of an individualist to have participated very actively in any political cause, it didn't prevent the politicians from taking advantage of his position to suit their own political needs. Nor did it prevent him from being involved in real-life consequences of that political advantage-taking. So that, even if Robbe-Grillet père' s anti-militarism disqualified him from serving as an officer in the First World War, he still had to fight as a private. And similarly, although his parents' welcome of the Nazi occupation was motivated chiefly by their anti-republicanism, their tacit support for the régime contributed, albeit in a very small way, to the deaths of millions of innocent individuals (Jews, and various oddballs no odder than themselves). Robbe-Grillet doesn't make the connection between his parents' politics and the concentration camps, but he does mention them both. He also records, but without passing comment on the fact, that until her death his mother refused to believe that the concentration camps had been anything other than a malicious lie. What I am saying, in other words, is that - whether he likes it or not, and also, whatever its historical provenance - Robbe-Grillet's writing is political from the moment that other people choose to make it so; and it remains so in spite of any attempt on his part to dismiss such a response as ideological recuperation. His lifelong defence of individual freedom against the encroachment of political ideology constitutes a private individual intention that is not and would never be capable of with- standing co-option by a public and political institution. And by way of conclusion I should like to contrast Robbe-Grillet's obstinacy and his blindness to this possibility with Milan Kundera, a novelist with whom Robbe-Grillet has little connection except as a reverse image on this issue. For it seems to me that Kundera's work can be read as a sustained exploration precisely of the way that history and circumstance repeatedly hijack the acts of individuals and strip them of their original motives and intentions. In other words, Kundera's novels confront the very problem which Robbe-Grillet is so desperately trying to dodge. This is the theme of Kundera's novel The Joke whose hero's life is wrecked by his insistence on his right to determine the meaning of his actions in the face of a society and a régime which not only define them differently, but which, more terribly, also lose all interest in them. And, as with Robbe- Grillet, what is true of the individual is also true of his art - which is exactly what Kundera's earlier novel, Life is Elsewhere, demonstrates. In it Kundera shows how Poetry (with a capital P) which the European</page><page sequence="20">Regicide and readers : Robbe-Grilleťs politics 63 tradition has preserved as 'an inviolable value', failed - or at least in Czechoslovakia it failed - to see the hijacking process taking place. Kundera sums it up in the Postscript to the novel which has chronicled the life of the fictional poet Jaromil: '[The Poets] thought they were playing their customary part in the glorious European drama and had no inkling that the theatre manager had changed the program at the last moment and substituted a trivial farce',14 a farce moreover, in which poetry, far from remaining politically inviolate, found itself conscripted into the political ranks of the post-war régime, and turned, in spite of itself, into the mechanized army, the machine tool, the agricultural tractor that Robbe- Grillet's work condemns, yet so futilely seeks to resist. Where Kundera's writing takes as its starting point the fact that the management can change the programme like this, and recognizes that the work of the writer-actor always needs to take account of this possibility, Robbe-Grillet obstinately persists in a Herculean struggle in which he can never be sure of having the last word, however many readers he kills off. ANN ANN JEFFERSON JEFFERSON ANN ANN JEFFERSON JEFFERSON New College, Oxford NOTES i Previously the only way to read the novels in a political light was to do as Lucien Goldmann did and treat the fictional forms as homologies for social and political reality. See his Pour une sociologie du roman (Paris, Gallimard, 1964). Jacques Leenhardt's Lecture politique du roman (Paris, Minuit, 1973) undertakes a broadly Goldmannian analysis of La Jalousie for which he produces a political content - colonialism and its abuses - on which he bases a reading which treats Robbe-Grilleťs politics as broadly progressive. But the political scope of Leenhardt's study is not easily transferrable to the rest of the Robbe-Grillet corpus , and the interpretation remains very localized. Fredric Jameson in his interesting review of Leenhardt's book argues for the need to broaden out the political dimension of Robbe-Grilleťs writing, first by doing as Leenhardt does, and acknowledging it as having a contents and second, by claiming that we need to investigate the position of modernist writing within post-war culture in general. (Fredric Jameson, 'Modernism and its repressed: Robbe-Grillet as anti-colonialist', Diacritics 6:2 ( 1976) 7- 1 4.) In what follows I shall be taking content as the initial justification for my own argument which, while not dealing specifically with the issue of modernism, will nevertheless examine the fate of Robbe-Grilleťs writing within the cultural context of its reception. 2 Both published in Paris by Minuit.

He too proceeds by confronting the content of Robbe-Grillet's writing, and though the essay was written before the appearance of Le Miroir , Hill's argument and conclusions are amply corroborated by the autobiographical texts. 6 At one point, Robbe-Grillet also refers to 'ideology' as a synonym for what was once - classically in Flaubert's day - called 'les idées reçues'. This term also suggests a much closer alignment between Robbe-Grillet's conception of ideology and Barthes's doxa , than between Robbe-Grillet and Althusser on ideology. Robbe-Grillet seems to be trying to combine an insistence on his own individuality with a denial of his subjecthood in terms which an Althusserian analysis would doubtless find not only suspect but also deluded. A comparison between Robbe-Grillet and Barthes would be illuminating, as would an Althusserian analysis of Robbe-Grillet's wrestlings with the issue of ideology. Regrettably, I have undertaken neither here. 7 For the distinction between New Novel and New New Novel see Ben Stoltzfus, Alain Robbe-Grillet : The Body of the Text (London &amp; Toronto, Associated University Presses, 1985). Incidentally, this book is a prime example of a persistently formalist reading of some very dubious ideological content in Robbe-Grillet, and it shows what is entailed in a reading based on what, below, I shall be calling complicity.
