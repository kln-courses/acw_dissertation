<plain_text><page sequence="1">307 The Beginning of Southern Melanesian Prehistory: The St Maurice-Vatcha Lapita Site, New Caledonia Christophe Sand Service des Mus&amp;es et du Patrimoine Noumda, New Caledonia The peopling of the Western Pacific south of the Solomon Islands started with the spread of Austronesian populations more than 3000 years ago. The initial colonization of Remote Oceania is archaeologically linked to the Lapita Cultural Complex, identified at more than 100 major sites from Island Papua-New Guinea to Western Polynesia by a distinctive type of dentate-stamped decorated pottery and associated items. Until the last decade, Lapita sites of New Caledonia, the southernmost archipelago ofMelanesia, had been poorly studied, leading to unsatisfactory conclusions about the characteristics and the length of the found- ing cultural complex. New excavations undertaken at the most southerly Lapita site of the Pacific, the St Maurice-Vatcha site on the Isle of Pines, shed new light on the matter Although one of the first Lapita sites identified in the region and excavated by different teams over the years, its stratigraphy, chronology, and artifacts were not well understood. The new excavations have led to a precise understanding of the stratigraphy, and a large set of new 14C dates have firmly established Lapita chronology. The study of the archaeological material helps to test the proposal of a "Southern Lapita Province," characterizing the earli- est sites of southern Melanesia. Introduction The initial peopling of Remote Oceania from the end of the 2nd millennium B.C. is one of the most rapid Neolith- ic colonizations known (Kirch 1997). This advance ofAus- tronesian sailing populations is signaled in a hundred ma- jor sites distributed over more than 4000 km (FIG. I) by the presence of a distinct ceramic tradition called Lapita. Pottery in the Lapita tradition is often of complex form and frequently bears a characteristic surface decoration of den- tate-stamped geometrical motifs. The large number of ex- cavations over the last few decades has defined a "Lapita Cultural Complex" (Green 1979; Spriggs 1997) associat- ed with the colonization front, in which characteristics vary according to the front's spatial and temporal advance. The chronology of population movement through the south of Melanesia to Fiji and to Western Polynesia re- mains a central problem in regional archaeological re- search. The first series of datings seemed to have Lapita potters in both New Caledonia and Fiji from about 1500 B.c., which led to discussion of an almost instantaneous peopling of the region. Golson (1961: 176), for example, spoke of a "community of culture" that crossed the Melanesia-Polynesia divide 3000 years ago. But more re- cently it has become apparent that the datings carried out during the 1960s and early 1970s are often not reliable. Attempts at reconstruction of the first phase of human oc- cupation of this vast region, based on a few uncertain dates, can only result in chronologies that vary according to the different aims of the researchers concerned (Spriggs 1984; Kirch and Hunt 1988a; Spriggs 1990a). The need to have new and unambiguous data has sent archaeologists back to key sites such as Mussau and Natunuku in order to rede- termine on the one hand, the beginning of a site's occupa- tion, and on the other, the date when Lapita pottery is no longer present (e.g., Kirch 1987; Kirch and Hunt 1998b; Davidson et al. 1990). Site KVO003 at St Maurice-Vatcha on the Isle of Pines, in the south of New Caledonia, has occupied a special place in the study of advancing Lapita populations. Here, for the first time, in 1950 the geologist Avias recognized the exis- tence of a dentate-stamped ceramic tradition stretching from Watom in the Bismarck archipelago to New Caledo- nia, a distance of 3000 km (Avias 1950). In addition, this</page><page sequence="2">308 Beginning of Southern Melanesian Prehistory/Sand EA ST'A ASIA : MICRONESIA ISLAND MELANESIA OTHEA POLYNESIA ASIA S 4  0o Uvea Solomon * Futuna 0ea Samoa "-""" ; ?t _DFiji 6 Vanuatu Fiji o0 ' 0 ?

Lastly, this was the site that, in the 1970s, yielded the oldest date at the time for a Lapi- ta settlement, with the possibility of two archaeological levels containing dentate-stamped sherds, separated by a gap of several centuries (Frimigacci 1974, 1975). Unfortunately, publication of the site remained incom- plete. Thus the chronology is based on only two dates ob- tained at the end of the 1960s and at the beginning of the 1970s. The stratigraphy, too, is hard to understand from the few published reports, which makes it difficult to in- corporate St Maurice-Vatcha into any overall consideration of the beginning of Austronesian occupation of New Cale- donia (Sand 1996b). In order to place site KVO003 in its regional cultural context, the Department of Archaeology of New Caledo- nia carried out two studies in December 1995 and March 1996 (Sand 1996a). The controversial chronological lim- its of Lapita pottery in New Caledonia, supposed to have lasted until the beginning of the first millennium A.C. (Galipaud 1996; Frimigacci 1999), come under particular scrutiny, and the idea of a "Southern Lapita Province," pro- posed recently by Kirch (1997), and different from the Western and Eastern Lapita Provinces identified two decades ago (Green 1979), is examined in the light of the new data. The Research Area The Isle of Pines, ca. 20 x 15 km wide, lies 50 km to the SE of the Grande Terre (mainland) of New Caledonia (FIG. 2). Structurally it can be divided roughly into two ge- ological assemblages (Guillon, Trescases, and Prinzhofer 1986). The central assemblage is of peridotites, with an av- erage plateau 100 m in height. Around this kernel a fring- ing coral reef has developed which, today, is uplifted be- tween 5 and 20 m above sea level. The Vao tribe lives on the south point of the Isle of Pines, in the area where the peridotite assemblage is clos- est to the shore and where the slope is greatest, reaching as much as a 50% incline. Regular flow of water has given rise to the formation of a basin which over the millennia has not been greatly colonized by coral. Today this forms a par- tially marshy plain of about 25 ha, used for stock raising and crops. During heavy rain, water is able to flow to the sea by snaking between the uplifted coral plateau and a quaternary dune that closes off the plain. It is on this dune that the Lapita site KVO003 of St Maurice-Vatcha is situ- ated. The dune (FIG. 3) measures about 350 m along its NE- sw axis parallel to the sea and 180 m across at its widest, middle part, with its ends resting upon the uplifted coral</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 26, 1999 309 lb GADJI 4 So "DA VAO KVO 0035k 0 5 km Figure 2. The Isle of Pines in the south of the Grande Terre of New Caledonia and the location of site KVO003 of St Maurice-Vatcha. plateau. The central part of the dune measures 180 x 90 m, with a slightly rounded summit reaching 3 m above the level of the highest tides (FIG. 4). In the first 50 m from the slope of the dune the vegetation is composed mostly of "pepper trees" (Schinus terebenthifolius Raddi), leadtrees (Leucaena leucocephala [Lamarck] De Wit) and a few co- conut trees (Cocos nucifera L.). In the central area this gives way to a coastal forest that includes banyans and beach hi- biscus (Hibiscus tiliaceus L.). At the back, the plain is occu- pied by savanna and cultivated gardens. A zone of sandy concretion forming slabs occurs in front of the eroding dune, partially restricting marine progression. The natural environment of St Maurice-Vatcha includes several characteristics that may well have influenced the Austronesian navigators in their choice of settlement near- ly 3000 years ago. Just opposite the site is one of the is- land's most easily accessible natural passes in the coral reef, giving easy reach to Gu and Upi, the island's deepest bays, and the best protected from prevailing winds with good fishing and abundant shellfish. Such an environment would have appealed to groups of seafaring people. The second feature of the site, complementing the presence of the raised dune that gave protection during even the high- est tides, must have been the presence of the large marshy area on the landward side. This area would have guaran- teed a supply of fresh water in an uplifted coral environ- ment, which is not the case in other coastal zones on the Isle of Pines. Also, the moist ground would have allowed these navigators, who in all probability brought tubers with them (Kirch 1984, 1997), to engage in horticulture.

The complex was defined at the end of the 1970s by R. C. Green on the basis of the then known sites (1979). Main- ly working on decoration patterns differentiation, Green identified two major stylistic provinces: one in the west, comprising the Melanesian chain from Island Papua New Guinea to New Caledonia, and one in the east, spanning from Fiji to Western Polynesia. Early settlements were dat- ed around 1500 B.c., with an end of the production of Lapita pottery supposed to have taken place around the time of Christ. The more detailed work on Lapita decoration by Anson (1983) led to identification of an early set of complex and finely made dentate-stamped motifs in the Bismarck Arch- ipelago, prompting him to define a Far Western Province in that area, that had developed before the colonization of Central and Southern Melanesia. Another subdivision has been recently brought up by Kirch (1997) who identified a Southern Lapita Province comprising Southern Vanuatu and New Caledonia. Kirch's proposal was rather theoretical, without defining the char- acteristics of this supposed Southern Province, leaving it to archaeologists of the area to work out the differences to sites in the north (Sand 2000). The picture that emerges out of the last synthesis is of a step by step colonization process (Spriggs 1997), with Austronesian populations developing the characteristics of the Lapita Cultural Complex in the Bismarck Archipelago starting about 1500 B.c. (Kirch and Hunt 1988b), with cultural influences from the west, before expanding to Cen- tral Melanesia by 1300-1200 B.C. (Green 1991; Specht and Gosden 1997) and to Southern Melanesia at the end of the 2nd millennium B.C. (Sand 1997). It is in this re- gional context that the work on the Lapita site at St Mau- rice-Vatcha has been developed. Research on the StMaurice-Vatcha Site The site at St Maurice has been known since Lenor- mand's (1948) initial publication of a short article report- ing sherds of dentate-stamped pottery on the beach. Avias (1950) included the site in an attempt at understanding the prehistoric chronology of the archipelago, based on a seri- ation of archaeological material. The large quantity of den- tate-stamped pottery that had been inventoried led the So- ci~t d'e tudes Melan siennes de Nouvelle-Calidonie to ask Golson (1962) to undertake an archaeological excava- tion, designated PIN-1. According to the published re- sults, 38 sq m were excavated between December 1959 and February 1960. Although important archaeological mater- ial was discovered, the excavations were never completely published. C. Smart, one of Golson's students, used part of the data for the ceramic chronology in his thesis on the pre- history of the south of the Grande Terre of New Caledonia. A single 14C date from the oldest level gave a result of 2855 ? 165 b.p. (ANU262), calibrated 1290-810 B.C. (Kirch and Hunt 1988a). Following the discovery of large pieces of Lapita pottery in the cut face, Frimigacci undertook a new study of the site in 1970 and 1971. At nearby Vatcha he located an archae- ological level, at the base of the dune, containing two fire- places built of beachrock slabs and an area of occupation. This early stratum was numbered "level IV" and that exca-</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 26, 1999 311 vated by Golson, as "level II.' Level IV was dated from the shell of a terrestrial gastropod (Placostylus) to 4010 ? 130 b.p. (GAK) (Frimigacci 1970). This was the oldest date ever obtained for a Lapita site in the Pacific. But the dating of terrestrial shells poses technical problems (Green and Mitchell 1983) and the Japanese Gakushuin laboratory, which undertook the dating, has over the years given erro- neous results for numerous sites in the Pacific (Spriggs 1990a). This date was calibrated by Frimigacci (1975) to about 1600 B.C., and to about 1400 B.C. by Green and Mitchell (1983: 39). The Department of Archaeology of New Caledonia re- sumed excavations at the site in 1995-1996, within a wider program concerning the reevaluation of the Lapita-com- plex chronology in the archipelago (Sand 1997). The aim was to carry out a general archaeological study in order to clarify the stratigraphy, assess the amount of archaeological material in the deposits, search for structures, and evaluate the chronology. It was especially important to have a bet- ter understanding of the relationship between "level II" and "level IV.'" Thus a large part of the work was concerned with identifying the supposed deep level, considering, in particular, information from the preceding excavations. Excavations The dune of KVO003 can be divided into two parcels, an area called St Maurice to the sw, excavated in Decem- ber 1995, and an area called Vatcha to the NE, excavated in March 1996 (Sand 1996a). The seaward part of the site is being eroded, with strata apparent in cutbanks allowing a preview before excavation. Section 5 in St Maurice, oppo- site location 1, has an archaeological deposit about 0.6 m thick. The sandy layer 3, gray in color, yielded practically all the archaeological material. The archaeological levels lie on a layer of light-colored sand, sometimes slightly hardened, about 0.75 m thick, which covers an irregular crust of in- durated sand about 0.5 m thick. The remains of plant roots have been observed at the top of this layer, corresponding to Frimigacci's (1975) "level IV,' but no archaeological ma- terial has been found. One of the main aims of the excavation was to confirm the presence of this "level IV" in the St Maurice parcel and to redate the "level IV" in the Vatcha parcel. Three loca- tions were chosen about 40 m apart, near the points where Frimigacci (1975) had indicated the presence of deeply buried deposits. Location 1 was in the sw area of St Mau- rice next to the eroded slope. Three test pits, perpendicu- lar to the seafront, were excavated towards the interior of the site so that its extent could be determined. Location 2 was chosen in the central area of St Maurice, next to the slope of the dune, and location 3 was in the same place as Frimigacci's (1975) main excavation on the Vatcha parcel. Location 1 This location is at the back of Frimigacci's section 7 (1975: fig. 46). Four square meters were opened up dur- ing the December 1995 fieldwork, with five different stratigraphic layers observed (FIG. 5). Layers 1 and 2 are re- cent, reworked sandy formations, with little archaeological material, mainly water-worn rounded sherds. From 0.35 m, the light-gray soil (layer 3) is sandy with yellow pumice, and contains abundant archaeological material, including shells and stones. Large fragments of pottery were found in this layer, including joining sherds, indicating a layer that has probably seen little disturbance. A posthole and pits were identified at the base of the layer: one part of these structures has colored the sand of underlying layer 4. Lay- er 4, 0.6 m thick and loose, is composed of light-colored dune sand with yellow pumice. Layer 5 is made of consol- idated sand, more or less cohesive. Traces of plant roots can be seen in its upper part but no cultural remains were found in this layer in any of the four square meters of the excavation, which agrees with the observations of section 5. Layer 5 is about 0.2 m thick and lies on a layer of very fine yellow sand. The excavation was not continued be- yond a depth of 1.7 m, during which no other hardened layer was found. Location 2 The absence of "level IV" in location 1 led us to the north of Frimigacci's test-pit K of 1971, where deep mate- rial had been reported (1975: 171). Four square meters were excavated (FIG. 6), and seven different stratigraphic layers recognized. The first two sandy layers had very little material. Layer 3 contained numerous bivalve shells. It sealed the Lapita level 4, which is 0.2-0.35 m thick, gray in color and contains most of the archaeological material, shells, and stones. The base of the layer is irregular because East South B1 A1 Al A2 3. -3. "'0--.1_ -9, P. -12 Figure 5.

View of location 2 during excavation. of the presence of pits, one of which was 1.07 m deep. All the lower layers, down to 1.5 m, are natural marine for- mations without archaeological remains. Excavations in the St Maurice Parcel Three test pits, each 1 sq m, were dug towards the in- land side of the site. Arranged along a Nw axis from loca- tion 1, they are located 24 m (test pit A), 36 m (test pit B) and 60 m (test pit C) from the slope of the dune. Eight stratigraphic layers were recognized in test pit A. Only layer 3, gray in color with yellow pumice, contained rich archaeological material, including shells and stones. Judging from the amount of carbonized remains found at the base of the layer, we intercepted the edge of an area of burning. The lower layers, down to 1.8 m below the sur- face, were all sterile sand levels with some beachrock for- mations. The stratigraphy of test pit B is broadly the same as that of test pit A, with only layer 3 having a large amount of archaeological material. The excavation was ended at a depth of 1.8 m, and no other anthropogenic layers were found. Test pit C investigated the stratigraphy of the highest part of the sand dune, at the edge where the savanna area gives way to forest towards the Nw. There are four strata, all disturbed by roots. Layer 3, gray earth lying between 0.25 m and 0.4 m deep, contains some shells and pot- sherds, but in a lesser density than the other squares exca- vated in this site. Location 3 Excavations were carried out in March 1996 in the NE area of the site, called Vatcha. The absence of "level IV" in the St Maurice area led to the setting up of location 3 im- mediately inland of the large sounding undertaken by Frimigacci in 1970. Test pit B1, at the edge of the dune slope, encountered 12 different stratigraphic layers (FIG. 7). Layers 3 to 6 correspond to a level of occupation start- ing at a depth of 0.3 m, where a small stone oven and a large pit were recognized. Layer 7, sandy and gray, like lay- er 3, preserved a post-hole. Layer 9 consists of light-colored sand without archaeological material. Beneath it is layer 10-hardened sand with traces of charcoal and yielding</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 26, 1999 313 one sherd. The lower layers, down to a depth of 1.55 m, were sterile sand formations. The presence of charcoal traces and a small sherd at the top of layer 10 suggested an equivalence to Frimigacci's "level IV,' which he has reported restricted to a small zone next to the sea. We reconstructed the 1970 grid from the published plan (1974: fig. 7) and opened two square me- ters, El and Fl of location 3 (Frimigacci's unexcavated square G4) to expose a new part of level IV (FIG. 7). The upper levels had slumped at the edge of the old excavation, mixing the materials. The only level that can be clearly rec- ognized in section is the stratum of light-colored sand that contains no archaeological material (Frimigacci's level III, layer 9 of test-pit B1). The top of the infilling labeled "lev- el IV" (layer 1 in our squares) is composed of a hard dark gray sediment, containing archaeological material. It varies in thickness between 0.2 m and 0.4 m, lying on sterile sand except where a deep-seated hearth is present. The south part of square El and practically the whole of square Fl contains a fireplace formed from 12 slabs of beachrock placed mainly on the edge in the sand (FIG. 8), with an internal stratigraphy subdivided into layers that differ in texture and hardness (FIG. 7). The hearth is trian- gular in shape with an average height of 0.5 m with slabs ranging in width from 0.2 m to over 0.45 m. This struc- ture resembles that discovered by Frimigacci (1975: 93) in square C2 of the 1970 excavation, which is about 5 m to the west of the site. Radiocarbon Dating One of the aims of the excavations carried out at site KVO003 was to check the date of 2855 ? 165 b.p. (ANU- 262) obtained at the end of the 1960s on "level II" at St Maurice, and to undertake new datings of "level IV" at Vatcha, where a terrestrial shell has yielded a date of 4010 ? 130 b.p. (GAK). Our excavations found the limits of the undisturbed Lapita layer and charcoal samples have en- abled 18 new dates (TABLE I). Concerns regarding the early date reported by GAK on terrestrial shell has been confirmed by the conflicting dates of 1955-1670 B.C. obtained on a Placostylus shell and 800-415 B.C. for a carbon specimen found stuck to the shell. The oldest date for "layer II" at St Maurice, 1425-1000 B.C. from the base of test pit A, seems too old, as the dat- ing of the same layer in nearby test pit B gave a result of 1015-805 B.C. which is consistent with all the other basal dates of this area. It is possible that the specimen was sub- ject to the "old wood" effect, which can give a dating result too old by several centuries (Spriggs 1990a). The earliest period of occupation of "level II" in the St Maurice area is represented by five dates which match nicely on a medium range of 1040-810 B.C., with a cumulative intercept date of 910 cal B.C. The end of that occupation, associated with the fabrication of Lapita pots on this site, has a single date with an intercept of 777 cal. B.C. (range 805-410 B.C.). Four dates come from "level IV" in location 3. Dates for the hearth and the base of layer 1 overlap with the results obtained for "level II." The date for the end of this occu- pation also agrees with the results obtained from nearby St Maurice. According to these results "level II" of the St Maurice area and "level IV" of the Vatcha area are contemporane- ous; therefore there are not two Lapita periods on the St 0 50. 150 2 B1 El F1 Figure 7.

Contrary to data published during the 1970s, this occupation did not begin before the very first decades of the 1st millennium B.C., probably about 950 B.C., and ended one and a half to two centuries later. As one of the aims of the present research was to deter- mine if the upper layers represent a human occupation that has no connection with the Lapita phase at this site; five samples from these layers were dated. The first, unreliable result from the oven from location 3 (B 1), with a date of 560-195 B.C., was redated to 165 B.C.-A.C. 85. The dates on the upper layers all indicate that the site was occupied only sporadically several centuries after the initial, and ma- jor, Lapita settlement. Material Culture Ceramics The ceramic assemblage of the Lapita Cultural Complex is characterized by different forms of carinated, flat-bot- tomed and pedestal vessels, decorated with dentate- stamped, incised or shell-impressed motifs, along with un- decorated pots (Kirch 1997). Research has shown major typological and stylistic differences between regions and periods, starting with the most intricate designs and most elaborate forms by 1500-1300 B.C. in the Bismarck archi- pelago of Papua New Guinea (Specht and Gosden 1997), and ending with the simplest sets of motifs around 950-850 B.C. in the Fiji-West Polynesian area (Anderson and Clark 1999; Burley, Nelson, and Shutler 1999). The position of the St Maurice-Vatcha site at the southernmost end of the Melanesian chain makes it important in under- standing the typological and chronological changes in Lapita ware. Over 7000 sherds were discovered during our excava- tions, the great majority belonging to the Lapita tradition and 25% of all sherds were decorated, mostly with dentate- stamped patterns (FIG. 9). The presence of large sherds made it possible to reconstruct some motifs, in particular triangular and labyrinthine ones (FIG. io), vertical linear themes, simple wave or zigzag motifs, as well as more com- plex festooned decorations with, in particular, anthropo- morphic faces. Outcurved rims, composite rims, and a few dentate-stamped incurved rims have been noted; some rims are pierced on the lip. Typologically the forms are var- ied, with the presence of carinated pots (the dentate- stamped pattern then restricted mostly to the zone above the carination), and also of flat-bottomed vessels and pedestal-footed bowls. Preliminary observation shows that several types of clay were used, often tempered with coral sand, and sometimes including mica flakes. About 20% of the decorated sherds belonging to the Lapita tradition have incised decoration but only two sherds were found with shell impressions. The incised dec- oration consists mainly of triangular geometric and simple parallel designs, crossing to form checked patterns (FIG. II). The other type of decorated pottery is paddle-impressed Podtandan pots in which decoration is characterized by fine stamping. Sometimes the paddle impressions are associat- ed with dentate-stamped Lapita decoration. These vessels have outcurved rims and are sometimes carinated. The Podtandan pottery is scarce in the excavation units next to the sea, but makes up a large part of the decorated materi- al of test pits B and C towards the interior of the dune. This difference in the location of Lapita and Podtandan pottery, also observed at other Lapita sites in New Caledonia (Sand 1995a), is probably linked to a different use of the two ce- ramic traditions: the Lapita pottery had a special non-util- itarian use while the more robust Podtandan pottery prob- ably served as a utility ware. A different type of incised decoration was seen in the up- per part of the Lapita level, a triangular style found on ves- sels with a weakly outcurved rim of the Puen tradition (Sand 1999b). The Puen tradition is characteristic of most of the pottery production of the south and west coasts of the Grande Terre, in parallel with paddle-impressed (Pod- tandan) pottery, during the 1st millennium B.C., after the disappearance of Lapita pottery (Sand 1995a, 1999b). This type of pottery had already been reported by Frimigacci in his "level II" at St Maurice (1974: 38, fig. 19) and shows that on this site vessels of the Puen tradition occur before the end of the Lapita pottery. Significantly, fewer than ten sherds dating to the last two millennia have been found here, confirming low use of the site after the first centuries of settlement. Shell Objects A considerable number of objects for adornment (FIG. 12) were found, the largest group consisting of about 60 carved Conus-shell "armrings" with associated manufacture debris. One of the particularities of the St Maurice-Vatcha assemblage is the number of armrings that have one, two, or sometimes three grooves engraved in the central part of the shell. Two specimens are engraved with repeated chevrons, very similar to patterns on Lapita pottery. Last- ly, a plate of Conus-shell was found with two holes at one end, possibly for linking plates together or for suspension. The second largest group consists of flat pierced beads, made from gastropod shells and mother-of-pearl, with an average thickness of 1 mm (none over 2 mm) and a diam- eter between 4 mm and 8 mm. Several unfinished examples representing various stages of manufacture are also present.</page><page sequence="10">316 Beginning of Southern Melanesian Prehistory/Sand ............. Figure 9.

Attempt at the reconstruction of Lapita pots with triangular and labyrinthine decorations from the St Maurice parcel. The number of beads could indicate strings of flat beads, still known today in the north of Melanesia, or armbands of the sort discovered in Vanuatu (Garanger 1972). The presence of necklaces is suggested by other objects suitable for stringing together, such as shell beads, a pol- ished fish vertebra, and perforated clam-shell pendants. Certain of these objects, known from other sw Pacific arch- ipelagoes (Best 1984; Poulsen 1987), are here reported for the first time in New Caledonia. Also present were several fragments of Trochus-shell armrings, several large waste flakes, and two Tridacna-shell armring fragments of very high quality. Numerous Tridac- na-shell flakes, sometimes polished, were found as well. Lithic Material Stone flakes, mostly of phthanite, quartz, rock crystal, and red jasper, were discovered in all the test pits. In gen- eral this material comes from the Grande Terre. Although most of the phthanite flakes are debitage, the presence of tools such as sharpened scrapers, awls (for piercing the beads?), and a notched flake are noted. The main interest of the lithics is the presence of a micro-tool set, in contrast to the larger specimens in the early contexts in the Grande Terre (Forestier 1999). Five flakes of obsidian, which does not occur naturally in New Caledonia, bear on the lines of arrival of initial populations in Southern Melanesia. The nearest source is</page><page sequence="12">318 Beginning of Southern Melanesian Prehistory/Sand .0 5 cm Figure 11. Attempt at the reconstruction of a Lapita pot with incised decoration from the St Maurice parcel. some 1000 km to the north, in Vanuatu. Three of the flakes from St Maurice-Vatcha are sourced to Kutau/Bao at Ta- lasea in the north of New Britain (Papua New Guinea) (Pe- ter Sheppard, personal communication, 1998). Two ob- sidian flakes discovered in 1960 had already been identified as coming from Talasea (Ambrose 1976), nearly 3000 km to the north. Of local significance is the relative abundance of rock crystal fragments. Rock crystal is found mostly in the north of the Grande Terre (Forestier 1994), although recent re- ports have it in valleys in SE Grande Terre. The flakes from St Maurice-Vatcha have not yet been sourced but clearly, from the beginning of human occupation of the archipel- ago, some Austronesian groups undertook expeditions in- to the hinterland. Rock crystal is present in particular on Lapita site WBR001 at Nessadiou and on location WKO013A at Lapita, Kond (Sand 1996c). Polished tools comprise adze fragments and two more complete examples. The adzes have cut edges, are ovoid or nearly rectangular in section and are made out of siliceous rock of the phthanite type or a type of green rock (FIG. 13). These forms are known in New Caledonia only in associa- tion with Lapita pottery (e.g., Sand 1998a). Like the tool set made from flakes, the polishing stones (fine-grained gabbro and basaltic rock), probably used in part in the manufacture of adornments, are small. Of note is the presence of peridotite pebbles, beads of chrome (iron oxide), and fragments of nickel ore, all possibly imported from the Grande Terre. Shell Tools Several oyster shell flakes have cut edges, indicating that they were used as tools. A thick polished fragment of Trochus shell and a small mother-of-pearl tip constitute the remains of fish-hooks, along with two skullcaps of Cypraea for octopus lures. A polished Conus shell with a shaped edge at one end could have been used as an adze. Lastly, a bivalve fragment, probably a grater, bears indentations on one side. Floral and Faunal Remains The amount of carbonized vegetable material was too small for a useful study (Hather 1992). The economy of the Lapita cultural complex remains unclear. Some think they were a sort of"strandloopers" of the sea, living by fish- ing and gathering (Groube 1971, Best 1984); others argue the existence of primitive agriculture (Green 1979, Kirch 1997). Fauna The faunal assemblage indicates a great reliance on ma- rine life (Leach et al. 1997), while a report on bones is</page><page sequence="13">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 26, 1999 319 S5 cm Figure 12. Objects of personal adornment discovered on the St Maurice-Vatcha site. forthcoming. Animal bones were concentrated (almost wholly so) in the grayish layer corresponding to the Lapi- ta level, a circumstance that reinforces the idea that the principal occupation of the site was mainly during the ear- ly phase. The Lethrinidae (emperor fish) represent more than 70% of the fish bones identified. Coridae or Labridae, Lutjanidae, and Epinephlidae, all in small numbers, are com- monly taken with a baited hook in shallow waters, contrary to the Scaridae (parrot fish), which are usually netted. Fish of deeper waters, like the Carangidae, may have been tak- en with lures. Clearly, most of the fishing involved baited hooks and inshore species, probably just off the beach at the St Maurice-Vatcha site. The great majority of remains represents turtle (1612 bones, over 1.1 kg). Fruit-bat and rat are concentrated at the base of the Lapita layer. Shells The simple division into gastropods and bivalves is ap- propriate for examining the shellfish remains. The bivalves weigh two-thirds of the material in location 1. As for the rest of the material, the most important concentration of shells is found in the lower level, even though a number of shells were found in layer 2. The gastropods are more fre- quent in layer 2, an observation consistent with other later sites in New Caledonia (Sand 1995a). The number of shells and proportion of bivalves is greater in location 2 than in location 1, but the overall pic- ture remains the same. In location 3, gastropods are rela- tively frequent down to layer 7 of square B 1, indicating a post-Lapita occupation of this spot. St Maurice-Vatcha and Southern Lapita Prehistory The excavations carried out in 1995-1996 at St Mau- rice-Vatcha were intended to refine the position of the site within the wider Lapita cultural complex of Melanesia. How does the site fit into the proposal of a "Southern Lapita Province" (Kirch 1997)? The first occupants saw the dune at the end of Vao as having water and cultivable land, but still within easy reach of the sea (Sand 1995a). Earlier work on the site had iden- tified two stratigraphic levels containing Lapita pottery, separated by a level of archaeologically sterile sand. Frimi- gacci (1974, 1975) envisaged two distinct periods of oc- cupation, one in the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. and the other at the very beginning of the 1st millennium B.c. The excavations of 1995-1996 have shown that the I _ S 0/ 0 5 cm Figure 13. Fragments of adzes discovered on the St Maurice-Vatcha site.</page><page sequence="14">320 Beginning of Southern Melanesian Prehistory/Sand stratigraphic formations are different in the two areas of the dune, and that there was only a single Lapita horizon. The further away from the shore line, the sparser becomes the hard, horizontal "level IV" formation that earlier re- searchers used as a stratigraphic and chronological marker throughout the entire dune. The concretion of "level IV" is a natural geologic phenomenon that, in spots, interdigi- tated with an accumulating Lapita horizon. The supposed "levels II" and "IV" represent the same period of occupation, mainly between 950 and 800 B.C. The lower position of "level IV" at Vatcha can be explained simply by a difference in the height of the sand dune, low- er nearer the sea. This area of Vatcha would have been cov- ered after an early occupation by a layer of sand (layer 9 of BI); this could have happened very quickly as, for exam- ple, during a cyclone. Consequently there is nothing to in- dicate two horizontally-separated periods of early Lapita occupation, but only one. Analyses carried out on the dec- orative motifs of material from "level IV" at Vatcha (e.g., Green 1978), will now have to include the material from "level II" at St Maurice. The presence of post-holes, pits, and ovens shows that features are preserved and they should provide information on spatial occupation and the form of habitations. Such would, of course, require an excavation over a large area. Dates from the top of the Lapita layer and of the upper layers in the various locations have placed the end of Lapi- ta pottery at about 800 cal B.C. Intermittent occupations ensued during the following millennium, leaving little ar- chaeological material but showing that this area of the dune was being used in a different way. These results agree with the chronology of the Lapita cultural complex recog- nized in New Caledonia, which limits the manufacture of Lapita pottery to a few generations (Sand 1997). These new data are of major importance in the defini- tion of the proposed "Southern Lapita Province." Our dates show that occupation began towards 950 cal B.C., only a few decades after the sites on the west coast of Grande Terre (Sand 1996c, 1988a; Frimigacci 1999) and of the Loyalty Islands (Sand 1995a, 1995b, 1998b; Sand et al. 1998). The absence of data from the east coast of Grande Terre limits our synthesis, but it does appear that there has been a general progression from the north and east towards the south of the Grande Terre around the very end of the 2nd millennium B.C. and the very beginning of the 1st millennium B.C. (Sand 1996c: 117-118). These dates are well within the range for the region, with the presence of Lapita potters in the Santa Cruz islands to- wards 1200-1100 B.C. (Green 1991) and a Lapita pres- ence in Fiji one to two centuries later (Spriggs 1990a; An- derson and Clark 1999). The end of the Lapita occupation of the site about 800 B.C. also fits well into the regional framework and contradicts the accepted Caledonian Lapi- ta chronology (Frimigacci and Maitre 1981; Kirch and Hunt 1988a; Spriggs 1990a; Galipaud 1996; Frimigacci 1999), which involved a long period of almost 1500 years, between 1200 B.C. and A.C. 200. All of the recent data on the Lapita sites of the New Caledonian archipelago limit the chronology to a few hundred years, beginning right at the end of the 2nd millennium B.C. (Sand 1996c, 1997). Obsidian flakes from Talasea in New Britain likely indi- cate the foundation of the site by groups who left the cen- ter of Melanesia not long before and brought with them objects from their homeland more than 3000 km to the north. The small size of the flakes does not suggest to me a "network" of exchanges over great distances (Terrell 1989), but simply as one of transient traces of the transport of a small quantity of material during voyages of coloniza- tion. In fact, one can ask if this site at the southern point of the New Caledonian archipelago, at the extreme end of the geographical Melanesian arc, may have been a waystation for voyages even further south in search of other islands, following the direction that the Austronesians had taken 3000 km to the north when they left the Bismarck archi- pelago. Typological and decorative data from the Lapita pottery on the St Maurice-Vatcha site are another indication of the early foundation of the site. Typologically the pottery is as varied as that of other initial Lapita settlements on the Grande Terre (Sand 1999a): carinated pots, composite rims, pedestal-footed bowls, plates with a flat base, and lids. The most complex decorative patterns of the region's Lapita pottery can be found here, with not only anthropo- morphic designs (FIG. 14), but also all the known Lapita stylistic repertoire that can be derived from human faces. The unusually large number of stylized faces found in New Caledonia has been noted by Anson (1983) and Spriggs (1990b); it is one of the major characteristics in the defin- ition of "Southern Lapita" paralleled by the presence of faces on carinated pots, which does not occur in Far West- ern Lapita (Kirch 1997: 139-140; Sand 2000). Initial comparisons among the early sites of the archipelago show a remarkable homogeneity in Lapita decoration, which can be divided into about ten main forms (Sand 1996c, 1999b, 2000). It is clearly distinguishable from the Santa Cruz Is- lands to the north and from the Fijian archipelago to the east. Clear differences are also to be found in the tools and in adornment, further supporting the recognition of a "Southern Lapita Province?' Lastly, in the controversial debate on the origins of the incised pottery developed in Melanesia after the disappear- ance of the Lapita tradition (Garanger 1971; Spriggs</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 26, 1999 321 0050cm 0 Figure 14. Diagrammatic reconstruction of a double anthropomorphic face on a dentate-stamped Lapita sherd found at St Maurice (M. Lenor- mand collection 1948). 1997), the St Maurice-Vatcha site provides data for conti- nuity. In fact, as already reported by Frimigacci (1975), potsherds with incised triangles and chevrons which clear- ly foreshadow the Puen tradition (FIG. Is5), are present in the upper part of our sequence, and associated with Lapi- ta pottery. This indicates cultural continuity between the Lapita tradition of the south of New Caledonia and the in- cised tradition that followed it. Thus this typological trans- formation is not the result of a major external influence, but rather an expression of local groups (Sand 1999b). This datum complements the fact that paddle-impressed pottery (Podtandan) was made throughout the first mil- lennium b.c., and demonstrates continuity from the begin- ning of the Austronesian occupation connected with the Lapita cultural complex. The upper layers are, above all, characterized by scanty archaeological material. The abundance of ceramic sherds from the handled Plum tradition of the 1st millennium A.C. and of the incised Nera tradition of the 2nd millenni- um A.C. (Sand 1995a) on other seashore sites on the Isle of Pines and in particular on the neighboring site of Ka- pume (KVO001), excavated by Golson in 1959-1960 (1962: 16-18), seems to indicate that St Maurice-Vatcha was inhabited only sporadically after the first phase of hu- man occupation about 2950 years ago. This absence of more recent material had already been noted by Golson's team, which reported that an informant from the Vao tribe had told them that the beach of St Maurice "was already a chief's reserve in the time of his ancestors" (1962: 17). Conclusion The new excavations carried out at site KVO003 at St Maurice-Vatcha on the Isle of Pines have provided answers to most of the questions that were raised at the beginning of the program. The study has clarified the position of the stratigraphic assemblages by showing that "levels II" at St 0 2 cm Figure 15. Incised sherds from the Puen tradition discovered in the upper part of the Lapita level. Maurice and "level IV" at Vatcha, known from previous ex- cavations, are contemporaneous. The chronology of the site is based on the new dates, and shows that the Lapita occupation was limited to a few generations at the very be- ginning of the 1st millennium B.c. The quantitative and qualitative importance of the ceramic material discovered confirms that St Maurice-Vatcha is one of the richest Lapi- ta sites found so far in southern Melanesia. The presence of numerous remains of objects for adornment, of quite spe- cial stone tools, of well preserved bone and shell assem- blages and, lastly, of the remains of in situ structures, makes large-scale excavations most promising.
