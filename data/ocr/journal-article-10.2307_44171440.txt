<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RISHUKYO MANDARA SAID TO HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED BY SHUEI Harriet HUNTER Selon la secte Shingon, l 'ensemble des dix-huit peintures du Rishukyõ mandara conservé au Daigoji aurait été rapporté de Chine par le moine pèlerin de la secte Shingon, Shūei (809- 884). Son iconographie serait fondée sur le commentaire d'Amoghavajra (Rishushaku). Or, l'iconographie de l'ensemble du Rishukyõ mandara du Daigoji n 'est pas conforme aux préceptes du Rishushaku. De plus amples recherches révèlent que le Rishukyõ mandara supposé avoir été rapporté par Shūei se fonde sur un modèle dont la source écrite n 'était pas le Rishushaku d'Amoghavajra. L'ensemble des mandatas montre, en revanche l'i ifluence de traditions visuelles. En premier lieu, le Rishue (Nayamandala) du Genzu kongõkai mandara (Vajradhātu mandala) semble s'être substitué au modèle proclamé. Deuxièmement, l'iconographie de la série du Daigoji montre aussi de nombreuses correspondances avec celle du Genzu taizõkai mandara (Garbhakošadhātu mandala). Le contenu de l 'exposé du Rishushaku et ses indications sur le mandala n 'expliquent en aucune façon la prépondérance de l'iconographie du Genzu taizõkai mandara qui caractérise l'iconographie de la série du Rishukyõ mandara conservé au Daigoji. Introduction The historical record seems to indicate that the early Heian Shingon monk Shūei (809-884) brought back two types of the Rishukyõ set of eighteen mandates from his journey to China (862-865).1 The first type is represented by the set that is now in the possession of the Ishiyamadera An inscription dates this work to the fifth year of the Chinese reign title Xiantong (864).2 The second type, which differs from the set in the Ishiyamadera, is represented by a copy dated to the second year of the Japanese reign title Antei (1228) in the I wish to thank Ian Astley for his helpful comments and suggestions. 1 For a description of Shūei's travel route in China, see his biographies in Honchõkõsõden 7 in Dainihon bukkyõ zens ho, vol. 102, 131; Shingonden ÄH &amp;, 3 in Dainihon bukkyõ zensho , vol. 106, 160; and Õmura Seigai Mikkyõ hattatsu shi Tõkyõ, 1918, 868-869.

The ninth-century Tendai monk Annen (841-915) is the first to record that Shūei brought back a Rishukyõ set of eighteen maņdalas. In the very same notation, however, in his Shoajari shingon mikkyõ burui sõroku ft H Soffili, Annen also records that the Tendai monk Ennin Bit (794-864) had brought back a Rishukyõ set of eighteen maņdalas.4 Moreover, the mandala sets are not listed in Shūei's inventories, the Shinshosha s hõr ai hõmonto mokuroku S 11 and the Zenrinji Shúei-sõjõ mokuroku i li.5 On the other hand, there is circumstantial evidence, apart from Annen 's notation, that links Shūei to at least the set in the possession of the lshiyamadera. This is the inscriptions on a scroll titled the Soshitsuji giki keiin and the lshiyamadera set of the Rishukyõ Mandara. The inscriptions on both works date their production to 864. The inscription on the lshiyamadera set states that during the middle ten days of the second spring month of the fifth year of Xiantong in the Yuyuan $3 PS of the Xiangguosi in Bianliang a certain monk7 copied the illustrations of Xuanqing the master of Dabeiyuan Although the date is not recorded in his biographies, during his visit to Bianliang Shūei obtained initiation into the Vajradhātu Mandala ( kongõkai kanjõ) from the very same esoteric master Xuanqing.8 The inscription on the Soshitsuji giki keiin states that during the middle ten days of the first summer month of the fifth year of Xiantong Zhaozong íSíS copied the scroll in Chang'an's Eastern Market [section]. The locations tally with Shūei's travel route.9 Shūei records the Soshitsujigikikeiin zu in his Hõmontõ mokuroku™ but he does not list the lshiyamadera set of the Rishukyõ Mandara. 3 The Daigoji version, which is titled Rishukyõ jūhachie mandara is published in T. Zuzõhen , 5:775-798. Ono Genmyõ /Mfj&amp;ös Bussho kaisetsu daijiten , Tokyo, 1968-1978, vol. 11, 187 gives the date of the copy. 4 Published in Taisho shinshu daizokyo (hereafter, T .), LV.2 1 76: 1 1 3 1 b. 5 Both inventories are published in T. LV.2174A, B. Japanese scholars regard the Shinshosha shõrai hõmontõ mokuroku as Shūei's own work. The second catalogue is the work of his disciples because of the appearance of Shūei's name in the title.

LV.2174A:lllb5.</page><page sequence="3">The Rishukyo Mandara Said to Have Been Introduced by Shuei 373 It is interesting to note that Ennin, too, did not record the fact that he had acquired a Rishukyõ set of mandates in his inventories of the religious paraphernalia that he collected in China.11 It is also strange that, although later Shingon iconographie compilers of the Heian and Kamakura periods took due notice of Annen's entries to the effect that Ennin, as well as Shūei, had brought back with him a set of the eighteen maņdalas, nevertheless, the official Shingon line has always been that only Shūei introduced a set. A second important problem is the Shingon school's claim that a relation exists between Amoghavajra's (705-774) commentary on his translation of the Rishukyõ , the Rishushaku ïi®fl,12 and the iconography of the Daigoji set of the Rishukyõ Mandara. The Shingon school states that the Rishukyõ set in the Daigoji is based on Amoghavajra's Rishushaku. However, the iconography of the Daigoji set does not, in fact, comply with the Rishushaku 's prescriptions. In contrast to the iconography of the Daigoji set, the iconography of the Ishiyamadera set corresponds, although not without problems, to Amoghavajra's instructions in the Rishushaku. In the later Japanese Shingon school the iconographie authority of the Daigoji Rishukyõ set of maņdalas that was said to have been introduced by Shūei rested, then, upon its canonized Amoghavajra transmission. Furthermore, it is significant that the Ishiyamadera set of the Rishukyõ Mandara , a concretely dated Tang Dynasty production, is never mentioned in the iconographie compilations of the late Heian and Kamakura scholar-monks.13 Later scholar-monks, such as the twelfth- century monk Kõzen (1120-1203) and the eighteenth-century master Shinkai Äift (? - 1770), corrected the inconsistencies they found in the Daigoji set in order to match the iconography with Amoghavajra's commentary.14 In summary, even modern scholars like Toganoo Shõun and Hatta Yukio do not discuss the Ishiyamadera set, and Ono Genmyö and Fukuda Ryõsei state that the maņdalas of the Ishiyamadera set do not correspond with prescriptions given in the Rishushaku ,15 The Shingon school's propagation of Shūei's introduction of the two 11 Ennin's inventories are published in T.

The objective of this paper is, then, to examine the relationship between Amoghavajra's commentary on the Rishukyõ , the Rishushaku , and the Tang pictorial tradition as represented by the two types of the Rishukyõ sets of maņdalas in the possession of the Daigoji (Type A) and the Ishiyamadera (Type B). Collation of Text and Mandala Types A and B In the Rishukyõ Mahāvairocana expounds the teaching of the Purity of the Guiding Principles of Wisdom He elucidates the teaching in a series of stages lx, and a seed syllable Wf- (bija) closes each section, thus expressing the essence of each stage. Although the seed syllables summarize each stage of Vairocana's teachings, their number and placement are not consistent in the Rishukyõ and its commentary, the Rishushaku . The Rishukyõ has sixteen seed syllables; fifteen close a specific stage of the teachings and a final seed syllable closes the teachings of the text. Nevertheless, Amoghavajra clearly divides the Rishushaku into seventeen sections. The maņdalas, however, although they are a graphic representation of the teachings, are not explained in Amoghavajra's translation of the Rishukyõ. In his commentary, on the other hand, Amoghavajra describes a mandala for each stage of the Rishukyõ 's teaching and also delineates a mandala for the Opening Assembly. Thus the Rishushaku contains prescriptions for eighteen maņdalas in all. The number of maņdalas contained in the Daigoji Type A set is inconsistent rekishi , 730; Fukuda Ryõsei "Rishukyõ mandara ni tsuite - toku ni Gohimitsu mandara o chūshin ni," Rishukyõ no kenkyü. Sono seiritsu to tenkai , Tòkyo, 1987, 452-430. However, in another article in this study titled "Ishiyamadera zõ Tõhon Rishukyõ mandara no kentõ," 431-439, Fukuda compares the iconography of mandala no. 3 with the text of the Rishushaku and states that there is a correlation. He does not examine the entire set of Maņdalas. 16 Research on the Rishukyõ Mandara to date has not dealt with these two issues. Despite the acknowledgement of discrepancies between the Rishushaku and the Daigoji (Type A) maņdalas in Mochizuki Shinko's Bukkyõ daijiten , 5:4964a, Sawa Ryûken's ftfûfêË Mikkyõ jiten , 703-704, and the Mikkyõ daijiten , 5:2263-2264, these works do not elaborate on the problems. Toganoo does note the discrepancies between the Rishushaku and the Daigoji set of the maņdalas in his Rishukyõ no kenkyü , but this issue is not his focus. Hatta Yukio states in his Himitsu kyõten , 13 that the Rishukyõ Mandara was from a different tradition than the Vajrašekhara Sütra and was forcibly made to conform to the Vajradhãtu Mandala. Inconsistencies and discrepancies arose, but Hatta does not explain further. 17 T.

Four manéalas {Five Great Ākāšagarbhas Buddhalocanā Mandala WKftPÈS, Mahābuddhosņīsa Mandala and Rãgavidyãrãja are added to the eighteen in the Daigoji Type A set, forming a collection of twenty-two maņdalas.18 Although there are eighteen maņdalas in the Type B Ishiyamadera set, the illustration of the Mandala of the Implements of the Five Divisions is for some reason omitted. The Ishiyamadera set contains, however, a mandala, the Vajrapāņi Mandala that Amoghavajra does not describe in the Rishushaku. Thus, obvious discrepancies exist between the various sets of maņdalas, and between the maņdalas and the text (the Rishushaku) they are supposed to illustrate. These discrepancies might be construed as indications of the existence of a larger iconographie program proper that might have involved other scriptural sources than the Rishushaku. This, however, is a matter for future research. Here I will confine myself to the investigation of the iconographie features unique to the Rishushaku and the Daigoji and Ishiyamadera sets. * * * There are major contradictions between the Rishushaku 's prescriptions and the iconography of the eighteen maņdalas in the Daigoji set. Moreover, in many cases the variations appear to be deliberate. For instance, even when Amoghavajra specifies the details of a figure in the Rishushaku , the iconography of the Daigoji figure does not match the instructions. Although discrepancies are documented between the Rishushaku and the iconography of the Ishiyamadera set, the Rishushaku and other writings by Amoghavajra serve as the iconographie sources. In fact, the variations in all but one of the maņdalas in the Ishiyamadera set can be linked to Amoghavajra's writings. A major problem for the composer of the Daigoji set of maņdalas was the meagerness of iconographie information given in the Rishushaku. Amoghavajra gives only the names and positions of the figures for most of the maņdalas that he describes in the Rishushaku. Because the Ishiyamadera set records the names of the figures, information of this sort was sufficient for this type of mandala. The Daigoji set depicts, however, the figures in their anthropomorphic forms. Amoghavajra states in Rishushaku ch. 5, 6 and 13, for example, that Avalokitešvara, Ākāšagarbha 18 The four maņdalas are illustrated in T. Zuzõhen , 5:794-797, Nos. 19-22. Another Type A set in the private collection of Mr. Sorimachi also has the expanded programme that characterizes the Daigoji set. On the other hand, the Type A set in the possession of the Entsūji IHìi^F on Kõyasan has only sixteen maņdalas. This set does not include in its program the Mandala of the implements of the Five Divisions £p|ilt or the important Five Mysteries Mandala which is, according to Amoghavajra's Rishushaku , the culmination of the Rishukyo' s teachings. This set of maņdalas is published in T. Zuzõhen , 5.</page><page sequence="6">376 Harriet Hunter and Mahešvara are drawn according to their fundamental ritual form ^#1^. In other chapters he refers to an "extended version" or an "extended Sūtra" RIM ( Rishushaku ch. 14, 15, 16) and to a mandala that was painted on the wall of the Jianfusi in the Chinese capital of Chang'an WS: {Rishushaku ch. 17, 18) for details such as attributes, hand gestures ( mudrā ) and colors. Because the Rishushaku does not contain the necessary iconographie details of the hand gestures, attributes and colors, it must have been difficult, not to say impossible, to produce an iconographically correct representation of the figures purely on the basis of this text. An analysis of all the Rishushaku 's chapters and the eighteen maņdalas is not possible here. Instead, I will present examples that elucidate the points I have stated above. Amoghavajra provides specifications for the maņdalas in Rishushaku chs. 3, 4, 8 and 10. His instructions for the Vairocana Mandala in Rishushaku ch. 3 are as follows: In the center is Vairocana Buddha. Behind him is a sun disc, his head is crowned [and he has] necklaces, and his body is clothed in a light silk garment. He makes the Wisdom Fist Mudrā, and he sits on the lion seat. His body is like the moon hall. In front of Vairocana Buddha is Vajrasattva. Behind him is a moon disc and he wears the Five-Buddha crown. In his right hand he holds a Vajra pounder and in his left hand he holds a bell. He sits in the half lotus pose. At Vairocana Buddha's right side is Ākāšagarbha. Behind him is a moon disc and in his right hand he hblds the Vajra jewels and his left hand [forms] the Granting-the-Vow [Mudrā]. He sits in the half lotus pose. Behind Vairocana Buddha is Avalokitešvara. His left hand holds the lotus and his right hand forms the attitude of Opening-and-Spreading-of-the- Flower. He also sits in the half lotus pose. At Vairocana Buddha's left side in a moon disc is Vajrakarma. His two hands form the attitude of the Turn- Dance [Mudrā] and he places [the Mudrā] at the top of his crown. In the four inner corners install the four Inner Offering [Bodhisattvas]. Each is like his fundamental form. In the outer four corners place the Outer Four Offering [Bodhisattvas]. Each one holds his fundamental utensil of offering. In the four gates place the Hook, Rope, Chain and Bell Bodhisattvas. Each resides in his fundamental majestic pose.19 Amoghavajra's instructions are explicit, and yet the iconography of the Daigoji Mandala (fig. 1) does not concur. Vairocana forms the Wisdom Fist Mudrā,20 but he sits on a lotus, rather than on a lion, throne. The Rishushaku passage details the hand gestures and attributes, but those of the Bodhisattvas in the Daigoji Mandala 19 T. 1003:61 0c24- 61 la6. 20 The Rishukyo also gives this Mudra; T. 243:784c5-6.</page><page sequence="7">The Rishukyo Mandara Said to Have Been Introduced by Shuei 377 differ in every case. Vajrasattva holds the Vajra in his left hand, and his right forms the Pride Fist Mudrā; Ākāšagarbha holds the flaming jewels on a long-stemmed lotus in his left hand and a flaming sword in his right; Avalokitešvara holds a long- stemmed lotus in his left hand, and his right hand does perform a Mudrā, but it is not that of the prescribed Mudrā-of-Opening-the-Lotus; and Vajrakarma's left hand forms the Pride Fist Mudrā and he holds a long-stemmed lotus topped with a double Vajra in his right hand. The Inner and Outer Offering Bodhisattvas appear in their symbolic (samaya) forms and not in their fundamental, anthropomorphic forms, holding their "utensils of offerings." Thus the iconography of the Daigoji figures is not what Amoghavajra prescribes in the Rishushaku , although the concept embodied by each figure in the text and mandala remains unchanged; for instance, the Turn-Dance Mudrā or a double Vajra identify the figure of Vajrakarma Bodhisattva in the different sub-maņdalas of the Vajradhãtu Mandala .21 A title on the right side and the dated inscription22 on the left side of the third mandala in the Ishiyamadera set (fig. 2) indicate the iconographie significance of this mandala and emphasize the importance of this chapter's teachings. The title states: "This is the explanation in the third chapter of the Sūtra" In the mandate's center Vairocana is designated by the epithet "the Mudrā of the essence of the Universal Buddha of the Vajra 'dhãtu' " Vairocana is called "the Buddha in the Body of Enjoyment ( sambhogakãya ) who shines universally" in the commentarial explanation of Rishushaku ch. 3. 24 The notations of the mudrā and attribute on either side of the names of the Bodhisattvas in the Ishiyamadera Mandala also agree with Amoghavajra's mandala prescriptions. For instance, Vajrasattva's name has pounder on the right side and bell on the left. Ākāšagarbha's attribute and mudrā are correct, but reversed, and 21 In the Shingon version, called the Genzu Kongõkai Mandara Vajrakarma holds a double Vajra in his right hand in the Shiin'e P3ÉP# (Ca tur m udrà mandala, Four Mudrās Assembly ); in the Kuyõe (Pūjāmaņdala, Offering Assembly) he holds a long-stemmed lotus topped with a double Vajra; in the Jôjin'e (Mahāmaņdala, Perfected Body Assembly) and in the Misaie (Sūksmamandala, Subtle Assembly) he raises the Turn-Dance Mudrā to his crown. 22 The inscription has been discussed above. 23 The order of the Ishiyamadera Maņdalas has not been published correctly in the T. Zuzõhen. The Five Mysteries Mandala is represented first but should be placed last in the series. This mandala is presented as the final one of the series. See the discussion and the correction of the order in the articles by Fukuda Ryösei, "Ishiyamadera zõ Tõhonrishukyõ mandara no kentõ," in Rishukyõ no kenkyü , 431-439, and by Yoritomi Motohiro, "Shūei shõrai no mikkyõ zuzõ," 20. 24 T. 1003:610b4. The Body ( kãya ) of Enjoyment ( sambhoga ) is the result of the practices of Perfection that lead to enlightenment, and it is this body which the Buddhas assume in order to preach in their Pure Lands.

Amoghavajra's directions for the Trailokyavijaya Mandala are: Make the Mandala of Trailokyavijaya. In the center install Trailokyavijaya. In front of Trailokyavijaya install the Wrathful [Vajraļsatta Bodhisattva. Behind [him] install the Wrathful [Vajraļsādhu Bodhisattva.

There is, for example, in the southern gate next to the sword a drawing of two hands forming the Mudrā of Trailokyavijaya.

The Rishukyõ 's passage is given on T. 243:784c8-18. 30 The Epithets of Purity are the theme of the second mandala that Amoghavajra describes in the Rishushaku. The Rishukyõ expounds Seventeen Epithets of Purity in its first chapter. These epithets symbolize the seventeen aspects of the practitioner's innate enlightened condition. In the Rishushaku ch. 2 Amoghavajra assigns to each epithet a name and position within a seventeen-figure mandala configuration. For a discussion of the Epithets of Purity, see Part Two of Ian Astley-Kristensen's "The Rishukyõ" Buddhica Britannica , Series Continua III, Tring, 1991, 81-133. 31 There is a rotation in the order of the Outer Offering Bodhisattvas in the Ishiyamadera mandala. Because a consistent rotation occurs in the order of these figures in many of the Ishiyamadera maņdalas, for example, the re-ordered maņdalas No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16 and 17, this is due to a copyist's error.</page><page sequence="10">380 Harriet Hunter of a seated Trailokyavijaya contradicts the Amoghavajra iconographie lineage of this figure.

And finally, the mandala orients to the north with its three-pronged trident, instead of towards the east with its bow and arrow. Although the Ishiyamadera mandala orients to the south with its sword, because of a consistent rotation noted in all the maņdalas of the Ishiyamadera set and the southward orientation of the majority of the maņdalas, this is a copyist's error, and not the intentional re-orientation that is seen in the Daigoji Mandala. Amoghavajra describes the Manjušrī Mandala as follows: [If] the yoga practitioner will perfect the Wisdom of Perfection, [then] he must construct the mandala. The mandala is laid out in the form of eight maņdalas.33 In the center draw the form of the youth34 Manjušrī. In the four directions install the Four Buddhas. Secure in the arms of each of the Four Buddhas the Wisdom Sword of Emptiness. In the four [inner] corners place the four emblems35 of Wisdom {prajnāpāramitā ). In the outer four corners install the four Offering [Bodhisattvas]. In the four gates install the four emblems; in the eastern gate draw the sword, in the southern gate draw the halberd, in the western gate the bowl and in the northern gate the Sūtra box.36 In the center of the Ishiyamadera's Manjušrī Mandala (fig. 5) we find "the youth [who holds] the sword [of the] Vajra [dhātu Mandala ]" ^WJíüa. In Rishushaku 32 The works examined were: T. XVIII. 873; T. XIX. 1001, T. XX.1067,1 124, T. XXI. 1209, 1210. 33 The Rishukyõ in seven volumes (T. VIII.244:794all) and the Tibetan version both prescribe an eight-spoked wheel format. For a description of the the Tibetan mandala, see Toganoo, Rishukyõ no kenkyü , 252-253. 34 The Rishushaku { T . 1003:613c3) has the phrase dõjigyõ MťM. Nakamura Hajime's Bukkyõgo daijiten , 2:1013a, defines the phrase as the figure of a young boy or girl whose hair is knotted on top of the head, and the entries in the Mikkyõ daijiten , 4:1655a, and Mochizuki Shinko's Bukkyõ daijiten , 4:3871a, also stress youthfulness. 35 The Taishõ text has the character ÉP, which is, according to the Mikkyõ daijiten , 1:103a, and to the Bukkyõgo daijiten , 1:68b, an abbreviation for řpfg or ig 01. See footnote 27 above. A note in the text gives the variant reading a suit of armour (yoroi ). Toganoo {Rishukyõ no kenkyü , 254) cites the explanation of Gõhõ (1306-1362) who states that the character should perhaps be the character tS, a small box ( kobako ). Manjušrī, the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, is associated with the teachings of the Prajnāpāramitā Sūtra , and he holds the Prajnāparamitā Sūtra as his emblem. 36 T. 1003 :613c 1-7. A note in the Taishõ gives the variant reading of w. for The Mikkyõ daijiten , 5:2063a-b states that $£ ýí is synonymous with $£!i and that both signify the Sūtra box that both Prajnāpāramitā Bodhisattva and Manjušrī Bodhisattva hold as emblems.</page><page sequence="11">The Rishukyo Mandara Said to Have Been Introduced by Shuei 381 ch. 8 Amoghavajra equates the four aspects of the Rishukyo's teaching of this stage with the Samādhi of the various manifestations of Vajratīksņa, the Bodhisattva of the Sword. These Bodhi satt vas appear in the four maņdalas that are expounded in the four chapters of the Sarvatathãgatatattvasamgraha. The manifestations and names of the maņdalas are as follows: Vajradhātu Mandala : Vajratīksņa; Trailokyavijaya Mandala : Krodhavajratīksņa; Sakalajagadvinaya Mandala : Padmatīksņa; Sarvārthasiddhi Mandala : Ratnatīksņa.37 Vajratīksņa is a manifestation of Mañjusri, and he holds a sword in his right hand.38 The Four Buddhas, who represent the Bodhisattvas of the Sword of the Four Buddha Families, are in the four cardinal directions of the Ishiyamadera Mandala. In the four inner corners are the Offerings of the Sūtra boxes Depicted in the gates are the four emblems that Amoghavajra prescribes, the sword, halberd, bowl and Sūtra box, as well as depictions of hands forming Mudrās. Despite minor discrepancies, the iconography of the Ishiyamadera Mandala is based on both the Rishushaku's commentarial explanation and mandala directions.39 In contrast, the Daigoji's Manjušrī Mandala (fig. 6) differs in every respect from the Rishushaku'^ prescriptions. Firstly, a youthful Manjušrī is not depicted. Secondly, four youths with topknots replace the Four Buddhas. The youths, who belong to Manjušrī's retinue in the Genzu Taizõkai Mandarais Monjuin (Hall of Manjusrï) are Jālinīprabha in the east, Ratnakūta in the south, Candraprabha in the west and Vimalaprabha in the north. And finally, the emblems of Prajnāpāramitā appear as sets of armour, rather than as Sūtra boxes. The iconography of the Daigoji's Mañjusri is that of the crowned figure from the Chúdaihachiyõin ŤpAf Pž (Hall of the Eight-Petaled Central Dais) of the Genzu Taizõkai Mandara. Because both the Rishukyõ and the Rishushaku provide particular information with regard to the iconography of Mañjusri, the substitution evinces both a different interpretation and a different iconographical source. The Rishukyõ states that the Buddha of this chapter, Sarvadharmāprapanca, expounds the teachings of the Wheel of Revolving Syllables and, to further elucidate the teaching, manifests himself as the young prince Mañjusri Biffi li Ä who brandishes his sword [of Wisdom].40 Amoghavajra explains in the Rishushaku that this Buddha is none other 37 T. 1003:613b21-cl. 38 Vajratīksņa manifests himself as Mañjusri in Amoghavajra's works T. VIII. 865 and 871, and Vajratīksņa's sword attribute is given in Amoghavajra's ritual manuals T. XVIII. 873:305bl3 and T. XX.1067:134a28-bl. 39 For example, the names of the four Outer Offering Bodhisattvas are Joyful Sport, Garland, Lyre, and Turn-Dance. The names Lyre and Turn-Dance are found in the descriptions of the Outer Offerings in Amoghavajra's translation of the Vajrasattva Ritual Manuals T. XX.1119, 1120, 1122, 1123, 1124. 40 T. 243:785a24-b2. Doshin HÄ and also doj i líŤ are the Chinese translations of kumāra ; see Bukkyögo daijiten , 2: 101 2d {do jí) and 1013a (dõ s hin), Mikkyõ daijiten, 4:1662c</page><page sequence="12">382 Harriet Hunter than Mañjusri Bodhisattva and that the Wheel of Revolving Syllables is the Samādhi of the Wheel of Five Syllables The Wheel of Five Syllables designates Manjušrī's Mantra, which is composed of the five seed syllables a ra pa ca na. Moreover, because Mañjusri is described as having the form of a youth Sí® in the Rishushaku' s Mandala prescriptions, Amoghavajra stipulates the iconographie type of the youthful Mañjusri, whose hair is done up in five topknots.42 Further, both the Rishukyõ and the Rishushaku specify Manjušrī's emblem as the sword of Wisdom.43 The Daigoji's crowned Mañjusri from the Genzu Taizõkai Mandarais Central Hall does not hold the sword of Wisdom. The final example of Amoghavajra's precise iconographie stipulations occurs in Rishushaku ch. 10. Gaganagañja, who is the focus of this chapter's mandala, must hold in his right hand the action pounder and with his left hand form the Vajra Fist.44 The features of the figure that Amoghavajra prescribes are not represented in the Daigoji's Gaganagañja Mandala.*5 The Daigoji figure resembles the figure of Vajrakarma from the Genzu Kongõkai Mandarais central Jöjin'e tíc## (i dõshin ) and 5:1989a ( hõõji ) and Bukkyõ daijiten, 4:387 la-c (dõji). Kumãra is defined in Monier- Williams, 292a as child, boy, youth, as well as prince. Mañjusri is often referred to as the Prince of the Dharma. 41 T. 1003:61 3b2 1-23. 42 There are two types of the Five-Syllable Mañjusri in the Chinese and Japanese Buddhist art traditions: a youth with five topknots and a crowned Mañjusri who sits astride a lion, as depicted, for example, in the tenth-century woodblock prints from Dunhuang and in the collection of the Seiryõji in Kyoto. The cartouche on the Dunhuang print identifies the crowned and mounted figure as Mañjusri of Wutaishan SS Lil (Mount Five Peaks) and records the five-syllable Mantra. In both woodblock prints Mañjusri holds a rui ýnS, the Chinese staff of authority, rather than the sword of Wisdom. For a discussion of the Wutaishan cult of Mañjusri, see Raoul Birnbaum, Studies on the Mysteries of Mañjusri: A Group of East Asian Mandatas and their Traditional Symbolism , Society for the Study of Chinese Religions, Monograph No. 2,1983, 9-25. Amoghavajra greatly promoted the Wutaishan cult of Mañjusri; see Raoul Birnbaum, 25-38. The number of Mañjusri texts that Amoghavajra translated discloses that the cult of Mañjusri was important to him, and most of Amoghavajra's translated texts deal with the Five-Syllable Mañjuári; see T. XX.1171, 1172, 1174, 1175, 1176, 117A. Moreover, a youthful Mañjusri appears in many of his translations. For example in the Sütra of the Eight Great Bodhisattvas Mandala (T. XX.1167:675c8-10), Mañjusri is described as having the form of a youth with five topknots of hair ; in T. XX. 1 171 705a22 Amoghavajra instructs the practitioner to draw the form of a youthful Mañjusri with five topknots; there is a youth with five topknots in T. 1174; in T. 1172 Amoghavajra associates the five topknots of the youth with the five Tathāgatas. 43 Mention of the sword attribute occurs in the Rishukyõ , T. 243:785a29, and in Rishushaku ch. 1, T. 1003:608a6-9 (see translation above) and ch. 8, T. 1003 :613c 12-21. Like Vajratīksņa, a youthful Mañjusri also holds a sword in his right hand in the Mañjusri ritual manuals T. 1171 and T. 1 174 that Amoghavajra translated. 44 T. 1003:614c2-4. 45 The Mandala is illustrated in T. Zuzõhen , 5:785, No. 10.</page><page sequence="13">The Rishukyo Mandara Said to Have Been Introduced by Shuei 383 ( Mahāmaņdala , Assembly of the Perfected Body). Forming the Gesture of Salutation &amp; M ( añjali ), Gaganagañja raises the mudrā to his crown. Another difference between text and mandala is the western orientation of the Daigoji's Gaganagañja Mandala. Amoghavajra always states the eastward orientation of the maņdalas in the Rishushaku. Despite this stipulation, the Daigoji's Ākāšagarbha Mandala (No. 6) orients to the west, the Trailoky avij aya Mandala (No. 4) orients to the north, and the Vajrapāņi Mandala (No. 12) orients to the south. In short, there is never a one-to-one correspondence between Amoghavajra's mandala prescriptions in the Rishushaku and the related Daigoji Mandala. There are, however, one-to-one correspondences between the Rishushaku' s mandala prescriptions and the iconography of the Ishiyamadera set; examples are Maņdalas No. 2 and 3. More numerous, however, are the matches between the iconography of the maņdalas and the commentarial explanations given in the relevant Rishushaku chapter. This occurs in Maņdalas No. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11 and 16. The text of the Rishushaku and not the mandala prescriptions can explain, for instance, the additional set of angry gate guardians in the Sarvamārapr amar din Mandala (No. 11). Other writings by Amoghavajra account for obvious iconographical discrepancies. For example, the iconography of the Five Mysteries Mandala (No. 18) corresponds to a ritual manual, Ritual Manual for the Perfection of the Practice of Vajrasattva of Great Bliss one of a group of six ritual manuals that Amoghavajra translated for the Vajrasattva Rite.46 Amoghavajra's Sūtra of the Mandala of the Eight Great Bodhisattvas fill is the source for the group of eight Bodhisattvas in Maņdalas No. 9, 10, and 12.47 In many of the maņdalas the names of the Inner and Outer Offering Bodhisattvas are taken from the Epithets of Purity that Amoghavajra explains in Rishushaku ch. 2, or from the Vajrasattva Ritual Manuals. The lack of iconographie information in the Rishushaku and Amoghavajra's reference to an "extended version" accounts for the iconographie problems noted in the Ishiyamadera Maņdalas No. 13, 14 and 15. For instance, Amoghavajra does not provide the names of either the "eight types of deities" in Rishushaku ch. 13, nor of the Mother Goddesses in Rishushaku ch. 14, and there are eight empty discs in Maņdalas No. 13 and 14. The Vajrapāņi Mandala is the only mandala of the Ishiyamadera set whose iconography cannot be linked to Amoghavajra's Rishushaku , nor to a specific ritual manual. However, in Rishukyõ ch. 16 the Buddha addresses Vajrapāņi, and Vajrapāņi is the focus of this Mandala. Whereas Amoghavajra's writings explain the discrepancies found in the iconography of the Ishiyamadera set, visual traditions can best explain the iconography of the figures of the Daigoji set. The iconography of the Daigoji set 46 T. XX.1119:509a-513b; the installation of the figures in the mandala is described from 5 1 0b6-5 1 0c28. 47 T. XX.1167:675a-676c.</page><page sequence="14">384 Harriet Hunter corresponds on the whole to the iconography of the Genzu Kongõkai and Taizõkai Mandaras. For example, there is the substitution of the iconography of the Genzu Kongõkai Mandara 's Rishue ÏS®# {Nay am andai a, Guiding Principle Assembly) for that of the Mandala of the Seventeen Epithets of Purity described in Rishushaku ch. 2. The iconography of the figures of the sixteen bodhisattvas depicted in Maņdalas No. 4, 5, 6, and 7 is based on these figures in the various assemblies of the Genzu Kongõkai Mandara. The figure of Vajrasattva is the exception, and a mixing of visual traditions characterizes his iconography. The Vajrasattva figure in Mandala No. 1 belongs to the type of Vajrasattva that is depicted in another version of the Vajradhātu Mandala called the Ritasõgyara gobushinkan °JI#fêïïPSïLol$'k IH {Contemplating in One 's Mind [the Honored Ones ] of the Five Families of the Rtasangraha ).48 The figure of Vajrasattva in Maņdalas No. 3, 4, 9, 10 and 12 is a variation of the figure of Trailokyavijaya who is represented in a version of the Garbhakošadhātu Mandala called the Taizõ kyüzuyö In SSII BB#.49 Amoghavajra does not stipulate this type of iconography for Vajrasattva in the Rishushaku. There is, moreover, a predominance of the iconography of the Genzu Taizõkai Mandara. This is seen, for example, in the figure of Vairocana, who forms the Meditation Mudrā teéP in the Opening Assembly Mandala (No. 1). This mudrā, which is not prescribed in the Rishushaku, identifies Vairocana in all the versions of the Garbhakošadhatu Mandala of the Japanese esoteric schools.50 Other examples that point to the Genzu Taizõkai Mandara as an iconographie source are the seated figure of Trailokyavijaya (No. 4), all the figures of the Manjušrī Mandala (No. 8), the figure of Mahācakra (No. 9), as well as such figures as Mahākāla (No. 14), the eight guardian figures (No. 13) and Brahmā (Nos. 11 and 16). Conclusion The iconographie comparison between the Rishushaku and the Rishukyõ Mandara sets Type A and B reveals two significant points. First, the Shingon claim that the iconography of the Daigoji set (Type A) of the Rishukyõ Mandara is based on Amoghavajra's Rishushaku cannot be substantiated. Research demonstrates that major discrepancies between the Rishushaku' s prescriptions and the iconography of the Daigoji set occur in all the maņdalas. On the other hand, research shows that 48 According to an inscription on the scroll, the Tendai pilgrim Enchin IHï£ (814-891) received this work from his Chinese master Faquan in 855 on the occasion of his initiation into the Maņdalas of the Two Worlds Mq&amp;üßfcfü. Yoritomi, "Chishõdaishi shõrai no bukkyõ zuzõ," in Chishõdaishi kenkyü , 1989, 489-516. 49 Enchin is said to have introduced the Taizo kyüzuyö. Yoritomi, ibid., 499. 50 See Ishida Hisatoyo Mandara no kenkyü , Tokyo, 1975, for illustrations of the Taizõ kyüzuyö and the Taizõ zuzõ Id also said to have been introduced by Enchin.</page><page sequence="15">The Rishukyo Mandara Said to Have Been Introduced by Shūei 385 there is a relationship between the iconography of the Ishiyamadera set (Type B) and the commentarial explanations and mandala prescriptions in Amoghavajra's Rishushaku. Second, Amoghavajra does not provide enough information in the Rishushaku in order to draw the anthropomorphic forms of the figures. The composer of the Daigoji set had to consult other sources. The inscription on the Ishiyamadera set states that the maņdalas were copied from Xuanqing's illustrations. Although Ono Genmyõ suggests that Xuanqing may have translated a text directly from Sanskrit and also provided the drawings,51 an iconographical analysis discloses that Amoghavajra's writings were the iconographie source. However, another master, perhaps Xuanqing himself, was responsible for the iconographical pastiche that characterizes this set of maņdalas. Shūei seems, moreover, the most likely candidate to have returned with the Ishiyamadera set of maņdalas, despite the fact that the set is not recorded in his inventory. The dramatic iconographie changes noted in the Daigoji set of maņdalas point to a source other than Amoghavajra's Rishushaku. The content of the Rishushaku' s exposition and mandala prescriptions does not explain the preponderance of the iconography of the Genzu Taizõkai Mandara that characterizes the Daigoji set. On the contrary, the teachings of the Vajrašekhara Sūtra color the content and terminology of the Rishushaku' s explanations and mandala prescriptions.52 Kūkai (774-835), the founder of the Shingon school, returned from China with copies of the Genzu Mandara which he received from his Chinese master Huiguo HS: (746-805). Shūei, as well as the Tendai pilgrims Ennin and Enchin ¡B&amp; (814-891), received the transmission of the Garbhakošadhātu Mandala from the ninth-century Chinese master Faquan They returned with copies of Faquan 's ritual manuals for the rite of the Garbhakošadhātu Mandala and copies of the Garbhakošadhātu and Vajradhātu Maņdalas that Faquan possessed. An examination of the transmissions of Huiguo and Faquan and the iconographie materials brought back by the Japanese pilgrim-monks Ennin, Shūei and Enchin, as well as their writings on the Rishukyõ and Garbhakošadhātu and Vajradhātu Maņdalas , is the next step to be undertaken in the hope that the source of the iconographie and iconological changes evident in the Daigoji (Type A) Mandala can be identified. 51 Bukkyõ no bijutsu oyobi rekishi , 730. 52 Amoghavajra's numerous references in the Rishushaku and in his commentary on the Seventeen Epithets of Purity, the Banro boluomiduo liqu jing dale bukong sanmei zhenshi jingang saduo deng shiqi sheng da mantuluo yishu (T. XIX. 1004), to the teachings in the various assemblies of the Vajrašekhara Sūtra provide evidence of the prevalence of this system of teachings over that of the Mahāvairocana Sūtra.</page><page sequence="16">Fig. 1: Assembly of the Guiding Principle of Mahavairocana.
