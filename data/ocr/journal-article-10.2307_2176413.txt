In the third and fourth antinomies, Kant admits the possibility of recon ciliation, because reason and morals are in conflict. But it is either impos- sible here, or is possible in the case of the other two. The same principle rules all the antinomies. *The theses all depend on the method of pure reason, on the fact that "Ireason cannot without self-contradiction assume as complete, a synthesis which it has declared not capable of completion." The antitheses depend upon the craving to perceptualize the object of which we think. All the theses conclude in affirming the finite, while the antitheses negate it. There is really but one antinomy, recurring every- where because the intellect is both imagination and reason, which may be stated thus: "'An unconditioned quantum corresponding to an absolute totality is conceivable equally as finite and non-finite," according to our point of view. The duality is accidental and there is no real conflict in the reason itself. But Kant emphasized the duality of noumenon and phe- nomenon in order to save freedom. In choosing this distinction as his means, he was correct; but he did not see that it could save freedom only by rehabilitating pure reason, and that the form he gave it was compromis- ing to his aim. With the noumenon are associated all the ideas of tele- ology and free moral action; with the phenomenon, all the ideas of order on which science is based. If Kant thought that the ideas of an absolute beginning and an unconditioned are illusory, then is his affirmation of liberty merely a transcendental appearance. But even if we consider his proofs for liberty apart from the rest of his doctrine, his distinction of noumenon and phenomenon in his own sense will prove an embarrassment. Space and time are for Kant essentially subjective; the real is outside of space and time. A great objection to this view is that thought cannot con- tain a priori forms which are the absolute negation of its nature. Mind is a rigorous unity; how can it contain the multiplicity of extent and duration ?</page><page sequence="2">SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 83 More than this, for Kant there is no objective ground in the noumenon for time and space. If there were, time and space would necessarily be con- cepts known a' fiosteriori, derived from some more general form. The noumenon is then not of this world, and utterly cut off from the phenom. enon. But to solve the problem of liberty, phenomenon and noumenon must be distinct enough to give rise to two different points of view, yet close enough to be reconciled by the explanation we seek. In a tentative outline of such a reconciliation, we might assume that the notions of space and time, or, more simply, those of extent and duration, are analyzable into their elements. Duration would then be a composite of change, or successive multiplicity, which is objective, and the unity of reason. To have duration is to be in contact with mutability without being carried on its current; but this is what the mind does, which is present in entirety to each one of its acts and states. If duration be considered on the side of change, the noumenon is exterior to it; if on the side of unity, the nou- menon is within it as the unchanging element. The identity of conscious- ness is a noumenon always wholly present to the events of life, not in isolation from phenomena. We make unity and change equally parts of duration; but Kant opposed unity not only to change, but to duration as a whole, and was therefore logically forced to make the separation between noumenon and phenomenon complete. We have shown the possible reconciliation, though it was by recognizing that there is an objective factor, change, in duration; but this is the exact negation of the Transcendental Aesthetic, and therefore of the whole Crizique. Kant does not reconcile his two worlds, he merely places them in juxtaposition; his man is in extreme dualism, the empirical man subject to the law of necessity, the rational subject to that of reason. Human liberty is with him practically synonymous with necessity. The truth is that the phenomenon is not merely the negative of the noumenon, it is also its expression. The dis- tinction between them should be made rather by subordination than by absolute separation. Thus we should gain the right to a simultaneous affirmation of the two apparently contradictory notions, at the same time showing that always the phenomenal antithesis is explained by the nou- menal thesis. The infinite and continuous are in themselves inexplicable; the finite and discontinuous are not only intelligible but also explain their opposites, which as negations gain all their determination from them. The first are phenomenal, the second real. Like them, liberty is truth, neces- sity is appearance, and we may hope to solve the problem stated by follow- ing this clue in our succeeding study. EDMUND H. HOLLANDS. Folgerungen aus Kants Auffassung der Zeit in der Kri/ik der reinen Ver- nunft. 0. LEO. V. f. w. Ph., XXVII, 2, i89-207. We must distinguish in Kant two conceptions of time; first, the tem- poral determination of all possible presentations in consciousness;- and, secondly, time as the form of functioning of that activity which brings</page><page sequence="3">84 THE PHIL OSOPZHCAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIII. into being the presentations and so perception itself. It is in the former sense that " time is only the form of the inner sense." But, in the deduc- tion of the categories, transcendental imagination itself, though attributed to an ego unconditioned by time as the form of inner sense, is yet charac- terized as an activity; so that temporal lapse cannot be excluded from it. In the activity of understanding, sense and thinking are not to be sepa- rated; and Kant in the Analytic maintains this separation only for exposi- tory reasons. Reason, too, is an activity, in which, indeed, sense does not participate, but which is unambiguously characterized as a temporal lapse; so that time is presupposed independently of the inner sense. Kant's statement, that pure reason is not subject to the form of time, is reconcilable with the necessity of temporal lapse in the activity of the reason, if we understand by the temporal lapse, not time as the form of inner sense, not duration and succession, but transcendental time, as, in the trans- cendental ego, it lies at the basis of the inner sense as the condition of its possibility. The Critique teaches the empirical reality of time, but denies its transcendental reality. But to time as the form of all spontaneous activity we cannot deny transcendental reality also. The empirical reality of time is possible only on the basis of transcendental time as the condi- tion of all reality. Sensibility, understanding, and reason are phenomena, to which as the real corresponds the energy of sense-activity and thought. Kant calls this the Gemnilt. The transcendental condition of all being and activity, free from all temporal determination (duration or succession), energy acting in ceaseless flow without beginning or end, -this, too, in- volves time as transcendental reality. Time is thus real not as existing in itself, but as that logical determination under which the transcendental activity functions in our consciousness. If now the transcendental reality of time is not to remain exclusively logical, it must be given in conscious being and activity independent of thinking and inner sense; we must be conscious of it as of a continuous ribbon that unites all the items of con- scious life. Temporal continuity is given us afriori, the certainty of flow- ing time independent of the particular content of sensation, - time that closes all the gaps of conscious being (as the empty time of sleep). Time has an independent, homogeneous continuity, not due to inner sense. Our thinking infinitely transcends the temporal limits of empirical time. The time to which we ascribe transcendental reality is the condition of all per- ception, and therefore cannot be given or known through perception. THEODORE DE LAGUNA. The Order of the Hegelian Categories in the Hegelian Argument. M. W. CALKINS. Mind, 47, pp. 317-340. Hegel's immediate followers regarded the order of the categories as in- evitable. Modern commentators usually hold that the order depends wholly on extraneous grounds. The truth probably lies between these two extremes. Much repetition passes for progress; and identical categories,</page><page sequence="4">No. i.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 85 under different names, appear not only in close succession but at essen- tially different stages of the dialectic. Yet result and method are alike of permanent value; and the essential argument must be retraced by all who are to reach the standpoint of Absolute Idealism. This paper proposes a rearrangement of the Logic, which shall disentangle the several lines of argument. The following outline is offered: Introduction. Metaphysics is possible, for Ultimate Reality is neither undetermined (Bk. I, Identity and Difference) nor unknowable (Bk. II, Essence, Appearance, etc.). Ulti- mate reality is Absolute One, being neither a single reality among others, for such reality is same and other (Bk. I, Determined Being ; Bk. II, Iden- tity and Difference), and like and unlike (Bk. II, Likeness and Unlikeness; Bk. III, Notion and Judgment), and dependent on others (Bk. II, Causality), - nor a composite of ultimate parts (Bk. I, Finitude, Infinity, and Being- for-Self; Bk. II, Action and Reaction; Bk. III, Mechanism). Ultimate reality is Absolute Self, and not mere life (Bk. III, Life) or finite con- sciousness (Bk. III, Cognition). The introductory argument is directed against Eleaticism of all times, on the one hand, and against Kant in par- ticular, on the other. The argument for the unity of reality, occupying much the greater part of the Logic, has two parts: First, that Ultimate Reality is no single isolated reality ; and second, that it is not a sum of iso- lated realities. On the first point, the argument from Isameness " or "Ilikeness " is given far greater prominence than that based on "inter- dependence," doubtless because the latter is due to Kant and was common property in Hegel's time. On the second point, Hegel shows that a bare, unrelated plurality is impossible; but he never seriously considers the theory of the Absolute as a system of related individuals. However, he unequivocally rejects it, and the omission can readily be supplied on his own principles. The argument that ultimate reality is a self is also not so rigorously treated as that it is Absolute One; this because the general thesis of idealism was sufficiently accepted. As to the new ordering of the cate- gories, determinate being is the real synthesis of being and naught, not be- coming, which is rather a universal category, the common method of dialec- tical procedure. The section on quantity is omitted, because the whole of it is elsewhere duplicated, and its omission dispenses with the worse than useless section on measure. In general, the changes consist merely in the juxtaposition of groups of equivalent categories; and the justification for each change can be found in Hegel's own admission. THEODORE DE LAGUNA. Mechanismus und Vitalismus in der modernen Biologie. E. VON HART- MANN. Ar. f. sys. Ph., IX, 2, pp. 139-178; 3, PP. 331-377. This article is a critical resume of the leading mechanistic and vitalistic biological views from Muller onward. The earliervitalists, von Hum- boldt, Bichat, and particularly Muller, hold to a life principle the advocacy of which is now impossible, -in M. 's definition " an unconsciously-working,</page><page sequence="5">86 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW, [VOL. XIII. yet purposive activity " of an "imponderable matter," in its turn appar- ently a manifestation of a pantheistic world-soul. The "imponderable matter" aside, M. is closely akin to the neo-vitalists. To this life-force von Liebig would add the working of natural laws; Du Bois-Reymond, on the other hand, finds life's origin solely in such laws. Neither in or- ganic nor inorganic nature act forces other than simple attractive and repellent ' central forces' ; were there a life-principle, at best it could be only a complex of mechanical energies. Lotze, though repudiating vital- ism, has tendencies thitherward, clearly visible through a supplementation, in the case of vital phenomena, to the "I forces of the first and second order," of a divine interference. Fechner, Virchow, and Rindfleisch, however, as also Wundt and K. von Baer, are pronounced mechanists. For Fechner all physical, chemical, and organic laws, - it is true the latter are in essentia discriminated from the former, -are derivations from one law, universal and supreme; in so far, then, as a bodily organ, say the eye, may be likened to a mechanical contrivance, e. g., the camera ob- scura, the organ acts mechanically. For Virchow, who, distancing his master, seeks the distinguishing feature between organic and inorganic, life is traceable to a proper, transferable form of motion possessed by atom-combinations of a peculiar structure; while life' s appearance is vaguely placed in an " entrance of unusual conditions at a specified time in the earth's evolution." For Rindfleisch life retreats still farther to an unknown principle in intimate union with the protoplasm. The solutions of Wundt and von Baer are differently conceived. Life is a "goal- striving," -in the eyes of W., conscious, but only accidentally through over-shooting of its mark successful; in those of B., unconscious. Such standpoints may seem mechanistic. To materialistic scientists, intoxicated by Darwinism, they were not sufficiently iconoclastic; to vitalists they were pusillanimously compromising. Bunge and Hamann, on the one side, declare that the death-sentence of mechanism has been pronounced; activity is life's insoluble riddle, and each scientific advance merely widens the chasm between quick and dead. Conversely, Kassowitz dis- dains such mysteries; after himself exploding the various warmth-theories, Ludwig's osmosis view, the ferment, the electrical, and the equilibrium hypotheses, he presents his own explication, life as an alternate down- tearing and up-building of protoplasmic cells. Hertwig's position is neu- tral. Life is a product of both an incomprehensible vital force, and of the interplay of mechanical energies. With Haacke, Weismann, and BUtschli occurs a somewhat important innovation. In the last resort, viz., so far as a metaphysics goes, the universe is teleological. But so far as the organism is concerned, purely mechanical, physical, and chemical laws account for it. All three of these men cling, more or less absolutely, to natural selection as a final answer of life's enigma; W., perhaps, in his I hypothesis of a mosaic of predispositions in the plasm " working selec- tively, begs the question. Eimer's and Ziegler's objections to vitalism are</page><page sequence="6">No. i.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 87 more characteristic. Things must 'happen naturally' (materially) and explanations must not be 'transcendental' (transphysical). Darwinism, nevertheless, receives keen criticism at the hands of Wolff, and particularly of Driesch. Mechanical theories can never explain purposive adaptation; although in general the causal, as well as the teleological, reference has significance, the latter is dominant. In the organism the vital principle uses physico-chemical energies, especially in reproduction and formative- ness. A mere machine could never renew itself, nor could it determine the specific arrangement of its parts. Reinke, however, aims to dispute this. The body, a chemical fabric, runs by mechanical contrivances. More explicitly, there inhere in it two kinds of forces, energetic and non- energetic (but not vitalistic), which in union may be expressed as "IAr- bei/sdominan/e." At first mere "Summiationsfihiinomene," these appear later as immaterial, unconscious, psychic activities, governing not only parts of organisms, organisms themselves, and species, but ruling all as a semi-mystical " Universaldominante," assimilating all the lower "I Domi- nante." F. Reinke, although on somewhat different premises, substan- tially agrees with his brother. Reinke thus seems an implicit vitalist; so are von Helmholtz and Hertz. Purpose is so wonderful as to transcend the ken of human exposition (yet Helmholtz is a stanch Darwinist) and, even, though in the organism "I conservation of energy " is valid, its workings are inexplicable. But K. Schneider is one of the most recent and ablest, though mistaken, leaders of vitalism. Mechanism is an obsolescent error, lingering only through mental inertia; it utterly fails to explain purposive adaptation, variations in plants removed to unfriendly climates, etc. On the other hand, there is no autonomous vital force, no Reinkean "Ar- beitsdominante," no distinct life-stuff. The vital principle is a physical energy bound to physical atoms and differentiated from other physical forces only as these are from each other; perhaps it is Ostwald's "I nerve- energy." How it arises can be seen, not expounded; the most to be said is that it is a transformation of other energies through the medium of molecular rearrangement in the plasm. Beside Schneider, many less- known authors, "children who dare not use right names" might be cited,- the chief being Albrecht, Preyer, and Jager. All in all, the vitalist, though as yet his cause be unproved, may look hopefully forward. A. J. TIETJE. Brief Critique of 'Psychological Parallelism.' G. T. LADD. Mind, 47, PP. 374-380. The ' stream of consciousness' is no mere temporal sequence. Certain feelings of activity or passivity are inseparable from every state of con- sciousness. To these, chiefly or wholly, is due the appearance-or, as the writer believes, experienced fact - of dynamical connection in experi- ence. The experienced phenomena suffer a diremption, which is both a condition and a product of the growth of the intellect,-the diremption</page><page sequence="7">88 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIII. into phenomena assigned to things as their subject and those assigned to the self. This distinction is rather confirmed than confused by the fact that certain psychoses are for certain purposes assigned to the body, and for other purposes assigned to the self. The phenomena of which the ego is subject and those of the physical organism are experienced in such tem- poral connections and with such coloring from feeling and conation that they are inevitably conceived as standing to each other in actual dynam- ical relations. The consciousness of man is essentially 'ontological.' It is reality that he requires as the account of his experience, two real be- ings, his body and his mind, dynamically related in the one experience. Thus mind and body exist in actual, reciprocal, causal relations. For it is in this connection that the very conception of causality arises. From the empirical point of view, the hypothesis of parallelism is either unintelligible, inadequate, or false. The 'parallelism' is not spatial; nor can it be merely temporal. The two ' parallel' time-series differ in important ways. The life of the mind is anything but a continuous ' stream' ; and there are essential factors and activities of psychic life and development, in respect to which psychic and physical phenomena are decidedly not parallel in any legitimate sense. When the hypothesis of parallelism becomes metaphys- ical, it either distorts or contradicts the proper meaning of the categories employed. Psychophysical science, properly understood, does not essen- tially alter the popular conceptions of body and mind. What the science discovers is not 'parallelism,' but a complex network of relations. The problem of the relation of mind and body, like other ultimate scientific problems, appeals to philosophy for a tenable solution. Philosophy per- ceives with increasing clearness that the bond must be found in the being of the cosmos itself. THEODORE DE LAGUNA. Lafinaliti en biologic. E. GOBLOT. Rev. Ph., XXVIII, 10, PP. 366-381. The term finality, which is essential in biology, is not even legitimate elsewhere. The postulate of a final goal in cosmic evolution,- especially if this evolution be conceived of in anthropomorphic and anthropocentric terms,- is untenable. According to Renan's teleology, the first cause of the universe is divine consciousness, striving, through innumerable failures, to realize itself materially. Human consciousness, the cosmic end, is a good in itself, for whose production the infinite resources of the universe are drawn upon as means. But such a teleology is utterly foreign to science. Science demands determinism, rejecting alike occasionalism and preestablished harmony, unless by the creator involved in the latter be meant a mere mathematical or logical abstraction; such a conception, though extra- scientific, is not anti-scientific. Finality and freedom, which are really in- compatible, Sully-Prudhomme makes inseparable. Finality and necessity he regards as alternatives, and so eliminates the former from the positive sciences, maintaining that it is impossible both in mechanical and in psy-</page><page sequence="8">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 89 chological determinism. But instead of being thus banished from nature, finality is really conditioned by the very necessity of natural laws. A final cause, even that which explains the operations-of intelligence, is it- self blind. Its essence, as Darwin has shown, is the causality of the good, not that of idea or intention. The theory of natural selection has intro- duced into science, the field of determinism, a positive and intelligible teleology, having its own method and logic. A theological or metaphys- ical finality becomes a superfluity when it is seen that the strugglefor existence produces as excellent results as could the most beneficent Provi- dence. Richet affirms that, in the microcosmic world of biology, finality is placed beyond a doubt by the continual progress, not only towards life but towards the best possible life. ANNIE D. MONTGOMERY. Relzgion as an Idea. W. R. BENEDICT. Int. J. E., XIV, I, pp. 66-8o. The exact connotation of the word ' Religion' is desired. Definitions emphasizing its sociological and biological, as well as its expansive and dynamogenetic, functions are quoted. These fail to discriminate between what religion is, (I) as existing, and (2) as representing the highest human mental conception. They also reject the idea of a personal God, probably as a reaction against the gross popular anthropomorphism and because of a conviction that enlightened reason cannot accept it. A concrete definition is submitted: " Religion is the binding of a human personality to a su- preme personality," - meaning by ' personality' self-conscious intelligence. Is the human mind capable of a higher idea? Spencer's positing of God as the Unknowable is unsatisfactory, while to say that the finite cannot conceive the infinite because the latter is beyond it, is false. The finite is but a means of knowing the infinite. Since individual self-conscious in- telligence is an experienced fact, is not unlimited self-consciousness also possible ? Neither experience nor logical necessity denies the possibility. A supreme self-conscious intelligence is our highest concept of God, a power of supreme worth which knows that it makes for righteousness. Spinoza's idea of God fits exactly. Scientific evolution also emphasizes self-consciousness as a reality exhibited by the universe. As regards religion, two facts are important: (I) Feeling is individual and fun- damental for character; (2) feeling should be trained. Since fact is the basis of feeling, religion, to meet emotional needs, must have intellectual content. James's opposing view is unsound. Religious belief must be rationally grounded in experience and the universe interpreted in the light of such facts as consciousness, conscience, reverence, etc., which alone explain it. Man's truest feelings spring from his loftiest religious concep- tions, and since reverence, which is the highest of these, can be felt only for a person, it follows that a personal God is necessary to give them meaning. FRANK P. BUSSELL.</page><page sequence="9">90 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW, [VOL. XIII. The Present Attitude of Reflective Thought Towards Religion, II. HENRY JONES. The Hibbert Journal, II, I, pp. 20-43. The contradiction between practical faith in morality and religion and distrust of their theoretic bases, shown in a previous article to be character- istic of our times, demands a new method of defense. It has often been held that religious and moral phenomena belong to a separate province of experience over which reason has no control. Rational necessity is said to be merely subjective, and to hold for objects only as thought, and not for their other possible modes of existence in experience. In place of this method of mutual exclusion, that of mutual inclusion is proposed. The intellectual and the moral life alike consist in the realization of ideals. The process of knowing is not the organization of the wholly unorganized, but is a progress from incomplete toward complete organization. Its pos- sibility rests on the assumption of a complete unity in its object, as well as the objective validity of its data. The conceptions of the infinite and the absolute, like that of unity, cannot be merely regulative criteria, but are implicit in actual experience, since a conception cannot suggest what it does not contain. Knowledge and religion are thus based on the same presuppositions and must share the same destiny. This method of defense prevents the easy attacks of scepticism, but involves the difficulty of ex- plaining the relation between philosophy and religion. This relation must be conceived as organic, i. e., as that of mutual inclusion. Every object of experience is to be regarded as belonging to both realms. The human spirit is not ' will' at one time and ' pure reason' at another, but the one includes the other. A further consequence of this view is that each act of the soul is in relation to the whole of reality. The particular end sought is a partial expression of the universal ideal. Each practical or theoretic judgment is supported by the whole of experience and can be judged false only with reference to an absolute experience. The truth of this hypothesis of an absolute is implied in every act of experience, and thus becomes an absolute postulate. Hence, if reason and religion rest upon the same pre- supposition, whose validity is continuously demonstrated in experience, the fundamental truth of religion cannot be denied without stultifying the in- telligence, and so cannot be denied at all. GRACE MEAD ANDRUS. PSYCHOLOGY. Psychologie d'un etcrivain sur 'art. VERNON LEE. Rev. Ph., XXVIII, 9, pp. 225-254. This article represents an attempt on the part of the author to throw some light upon aesthetic phenomena in general by a psychological analysis of his own temperament. A brief sketch of his early artistic and emotional life, - his tastes, ambitions, and pleasures, - is followed by a thoroughgoing account of his mature likes and dislikes in painting, music, sculpture, archi- tecture, and literature, with whose ancient and modern masterpieces his</page><page sequence="10">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 91 profession of art critic has made him familiar. The role played by the psychological 'type' in one's aesthetic life is suggestively outlined. For M. Lee, who is decidedly ' motor,' music and natural scenery are preferred above all other beautiful things. The symphony or stream moves, de- velops, gives rise to sensations of tension, resistance, etc., whereas the greatest visual beauty cannot, by itself, arouse keen enjoyment until trans- lated into terms of action. Preferences based upon type remain throughout life. Following Nietzsche's classification of all men as admirers either of Apollo or Dionysus, L. refers himself to the first group: his tastes are classical, not romantic or dramatic. Sensuous art he finds enervating; that which appeals most strongly impresses one with a sense of power, an intensity of organization. Some beauty, though recognized, displeases because it moves the spirit chaotically; beauty which pleases need not be greater, but its effect must be upon the spirit as a whole. Ugliness and beauty are permanent terms in the esthetic life, not momentary sources of pleasure and pain, but the enduring conditions of satisfaction and dis- content. To enjoy works of art only subjectively, by reading oneself into them, is a sign of immaturity; maturity regards them objectively, as things speaking for themselves. Attraction and repulsion in art are based almost entirely upon pleasant and unpleasant associations of ideas. This accounts for the fact that technically perfect works of art may seem trivial or disagreeable, while far less perfect productions are capable of causing intense emotion. In a word, the criterion of art is a practical one; beauty is not a thing in itself, but depends upon the peculiar interests and innate tendencies, the personal equation, of the individual impressed. ANNIE D. MONTGOMERY. Verstehen und Begrezfen, I. Eine 5sychologische Untersuchung. HER- MANN SWOBODA. V. f. w. Ph., XXVII, 2, pp. 13i-188. Everyone has made observations such as gave rise to this discussion. Some things are 'understood,' others are not. Some books, paintings, etc., appeal to us; others leave us cold. One piece of music wafts us away, the other does not find its way into our hearts. It is the purpose of S. to investigate the relation of spirit to spirit; to indicate the conditions and the means of communication between mind and mind; in short, to define more nearly than is popularly done the meaning of the terms used in the title, believing that a more thorough appreciation of the difficult conditions for complete understanding will make uncharitable amputations of bad motives less frequent. What are the objects of expression ? What are the means by which expression is secured? In what relation does another individual stand to expression ? How does expression become im- pression ? These are some of the questions which S. proposes to answer. But before discussing the objects and means of expression, there should be mentioned a general condition which must be fulfilled, if two minds are to understand each other; there must be in both the same ' psychical situ- ation,' i. e., all the elements which gave rise to an expression must exist</page><page sequence="11">92 7TE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIII. already in the mind of the person who is to understand the expression. That only can be understood adequately by an individual for the expres- sion of which conditions are ripe in his own mind ; which he might have ex- pressed himself. It is evident from this that the objective is more easily understood than the subjective, which presupposes a certain Stimmung not always secured in another at will. " Wer den Dichter will verstehen, muss in Dichters Lande gehen." Goethe relates that he never understood the Odyssey until he read it walking on the sea shore. And it is easily seen why there is more agreement on questions of natural science than on other ques- tions. The erroneous is readily eliminated or corrected by reference to the stability and uniformity which exists among natural phenomena. It is ex- tremely difficult, on the other hand, to secure unanimity of opinion as to the meaning of terms and the significance of phenomena in literature, history, and philosophy, where so much depends upon the ' point of view ' of the per- son interpreting. From this general condition of understanding, the author passes to two particular conditions, designation and expression, the signifi- cance and limitations of which as means of communication must be ex- plained. The former communicates mostly ideas, the latter feelings. There is, however, a large part of the content of consciousness which is non-communicable either by speech designation or by motor and art expression. In the realm of ideas only such designations have been formed as stood for commonly received notions, the individual, the infre- quent, remaining nameless. A mutuus consensus is necessary in order to attach a designation to an idea. To communicate such an infrequent idea the person must have recourse to description. Nor can all feelings be ex- pressed. The more violent find utterance in motor expression, but the finer feelings do not find such a ready outlet. Description, wordy circum- locution, will not do. We demand direct expression. An important dif- ference between designation and expression must here be mentioned. Ex- pression has primarily a significance for ourselves; designation is prima- rily a means of communication. It is only secondarily that designation satisfies an individual need and that expression has social significance or market value. S. passes next to describe more nearly the main objects of designation, thoughts. Thinking means envisaging. True thinking is thinking in images; and abstract thinking, thinking in concepts, is only true thinking in so far as it stands for, abbreviates, symbolizes images. Our thought moves constantly between the two extremes of pure sight and pure speech; it is sometimes more of the one, sometimes more of the other. A word may designate things, qualities, events, and relations; it may have a complete, particularized, detailed reaction, like the words tree, chest, etc., or a summary, representative one, like the words 'insur- ance company, ' ' transcendental philosophy,' etc. Obscure thought can be expressed only by obscure designations. Ordinary language is too clear, too definite. Original thought is always ' intuitive' ; just as, in the case of new words, images are always called into the field of vision. EMIL C. WILM.</page><page sequence="12">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 93 The Psychic Life of Fishes. E. C. SANFORD. The International Quar- terly, VII, 2, PP. 3i6-333. Fishes possess most of the senses which belong to the human mind. The visual and olfactory senses are well developed, being the chief factors in the detection of prey. The tactile senses are exceptionally acute, as is proved by the ease with which fishes detect disturbances in the water. This acuteness probably accounts for most cases of supposed audition. The extent to which fishes are able to sense temperature, pain, and muscu- lar changes is as yet doubtful, and it has been supposed that they have certain senses which men do not possess. It has been conclusively shown that fishes have some capability for education. The apparently intelligent instincts of fishes, e. g., the spawning habits of the salmon, are to be ex- plained as very simple reactions to immediate external conditions, and do not presuppose any high degree of mental development. It may be con- jectured that the fish mind possesses a very simple form of perception, that it associates these percepts according to recency, frequency, and vividness, that it has the power of involuntary memory, and perhaps even some glim- merings of consciousness. GEORGE H. SABINE. The Distribution of Attention. J. P. HYLAN. Psych. Rev., X, 4, pp. 373-403; 5, PP. 498-533. These articles describe an experimental investigation of the possibility of the distribution of attention. Previous experiments to determine this point are criticised as inconclusive in that their conditions did not really make distribution necessary. It was found that, in counting simultaneous series of sensations, the rate of counting decreased as the number of series increased. This decrease was much greater when the sensations to be counted were from disparate senses. These results, together with the in- trospection of the subjects, were interpreted as pointing to the conclusion that the attention was not really distributed, but fluctuated rapidly from one stimulus to another. In order to test this conclusion, an experiment was devised by which two series, differing only in the concentration and at- tempted distribution of attention, could be compared. Again the attempted distribution caused an increase in the reaction time, a result to be inter- preted in favor of fluctuation rather than distribution. These results led to an investigation of Wundt' s tachistoscopic experiments, which constitute the strongest evidence for distribution. The question is: Was the atten- tion really divided in Wundt's experiments? Elaborate tachistoscopic ex- periments showed that conscious perception did not take place during the application of the stimulus, but came to consciousness in the form of a men- tal after-image. It was found that the reaction time again increased in proportion to the number of objects counted. This indicated that the per- ception was characterized rather by separate acts of attention than by its</page><page sequence="13">94 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIII. distribution. It was further discovered that the number of objects per- ceived in one exposure depended upon the duration of the mental after- image, which, in turn, depended upon the distinctness and duration of the visual impression. In other words, the number of objects perceived de- pended rather on physiological conditions than upon a specialized form of mental activity. Practice tended to unite in close perceptive unity impres- sions which at first could only be united with difficulty. Hence we may conclude that things which we perceive as single objects are composed psy- chologically of a group of elements which were primarily separate objects of attention. Elements habitually found together become so closely asso- ciated that we are not conscious of the steps which bring them together. Distribution of attention, therefore, takes place only when the elements are so closely united that the succession has disappeared. But when this occurs, the object is no longer perceived as a plurality; it has become a conscious unity. Simultaneous distribution is, therefore, a psychological impossibility. The phenomena usually ascribed to distribution are explic- able by the duration of the mental after-image. GEORGE H. SABINE. ETHICS AND AESTHETICS. Les ieements et ' evo/ution de la morali/k. M. MAUXION. Rev. Ph., XXVIII, 7, PP. I-29; 8, pp. i5o-i8o. (I) The fundamental problem of ethics is to determine the origin and genesis of the fact of morality. It is necessary carefully to distinguish morality from its concomitant facts, particularly from the social organiza- tion. To determine the direction of moral progress, recourse must be had to all available material in the shape of narratives of explorers and the history and literature of different peoples. The speculative demand for unity has led many thinkers to consider the good as exclusively the beauti- ful, the true, individual or social interest, or solidarity. In reality, the moral ideal is extremely complex, and on analysis breaks up into three dis- tinct elements, an aesthetic, a logical or rational, and a sympathetic or altruistic. These three elements of the moral ideal are closely united and capable of acting upon each other. Each may predominate to the exclu- sion of the others, according to races or individuals. In Buddhist India, in Greece, and in Rome, there is a predominance of the altruistic, aesthetic, and rational elements respectively. (II) The two lines along which moral progress has proceeded, those of intellect and sense, did not advance in a rigorously uniform and parallel way, and consequently the evolution of morality has been marked by arrests, regressions, and deviations, deter- mined by the predominance of one or the other of the two lines of improve- ment. These irregularities are especially noticeable in the evolution of the aesthetic element. For psychological reasons, largeness appears earlier than order and proportion as an aesthetic factor. Savages and children</page><page sequence="14">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 95 are attracted by intensive colors and sounds and by manifestations of physical force. As early as the Homeric period, the aesthetic and moral ideal of beauty as identical with greatness of stature is modified by the added requirement of harmony and proportion. The ideal continued to grow by the incorporation of psychological elements, courage, prudence, cunning, strength of mind, patience, and moderation. The external ele- ments retained their value, and therefore great importance still attached to another element of the external order, namely, power, which originates from a union of strength, courage, and prudence. The apotheosis of power in the caste system was in some respects favorable to the development of morality, for, through the sacerdotal caste, the xesthetico-moral ideal was gradually stripped of its external attributes, and there arose the new virtues of self-denial, humility, continence, and knowledge. This was in one re- spect a real advance; in another respect it was a deviation, accentuating by glorification the purely contemplative life, and by practice the most rigorous and excessive asceticism. The apotheosis of power did not appear among the Greeks because of their emphasis on measure and proportion, which ended in the conception of moral beauty as harmony. But from Socrates and Plato on, the moral ideal became more internal; there was a deviation towards the contemplative life which ended in the ecstasy of the Alexandrian School. Religion, the influence of which on morality has been greatly exaggerated, is the expression of the moral state of a people at a given time. In virtue of their traditional character, religions often are an obstacle to moral progress, and, on the other hand, are often a useful barrier against rash innovations. Through the teachings of the church there arose a glorification of the good will, a deviation from the aesthetico-moral ideal more or less dangerous than aceticism or mysticism. (III) Like the evolution of the aesthetic element, to which it is subordinated, the evolution of the rational element was a gradual and extremely slow process. The idea of justice grew out of the admiration accorded to an in- dividual in proportion to his prowess. Once established in its rudimentary form, it would be first applied in expeditions against dangerous animals or tribal enemies to govern the distribution of booty, each person receiving in proportion to his strength and courage. Thus the idea of justice from the first implies proportionality, and this proportionality was controlled by the aesthetic elements already noticed, each new element as it appeared being taken account of in the division of spoil. With the growing realization of the equality of persons, the principle of proportionality was transformed into one of equality of rights. (IV) Unlike the rational element, the evolution of which has followed step by step that of the aesthetic element, the altru- istic element has had its own development, not, however, without in- fluencing and being influenced by the oesthetico-moral ideal. The most common and important cause of altruism is the attachment of men and animals to familiar objects and places, and to the beings among whom they are accustomed to live. The banding together of primitive men would</page><page sequence="15">96 THE PFHLOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIII. give rise to certain bonds of reciprocal attachment. An increasing solidar- ity would appear when the tribes ceased to be nomadic, showing itself in a strong attachment to companions in arms, to familiar objects, and to the natal soil. And with the origin of the family would begin the growth of the altruistic sentiments and their corresponding virtues. M. S. MACDONALD. La viracith. G. BELOT. Rev. de Mete, XI, 4, pp. 430-454. Ethical theorists define their object as the search for the true good or the true law. But a good or a law are things determining volition and action; a truth is simply a matter of intellectual affirmation. How can a good be true? This paradox at the basis of ethics is emphasized by the conclusion of modern psychology that the dynamic functions of mental life cannot be reduced to judgments. Abstractly and historically, we have a solution in the identification of morality and truth. But this definition is arbitrary and does not correspond with morality as an empirically given fact in human life. Morality should be defined, by universal experience, as an affective and social, not an intellectual function. It may be asked: How are the ideals of such a morality sanctioned for the will of the individual ? Here we consider only one side of this problem, viz.: What gives its value to veracity? This virtue seems to lie midway between our two opposing con- ceptions of morality; it is, on the one side, intellectual; on the other and external side, social. There are two forms of veracity as a social virtue, one entirely practical, regarding actions rather than thoughts; and another social in its nature, but intellectual in its matter, -the scruple to make ourselves instruments of error. We believe that this intellectual form of veracity is latest to appear in conscience, and that this late appearance shows that morality is not an extension of veracity, as intellectualism holds, but veracity a prolongation in the intellect of a morality having its founda- tion elsewhere. In a complete study of veracity, we would begin with the primitive forms of active deception in animals and men, often automatic, due to vanity or the instinct of self-preservation, etc.; then would follow the ' conventional lies' of social life. Obviously the immorality here, if any, is slight; the origin of deceit is necessary and natural, and its develop- ment step by step with the other relations of life makes sincerity difficult. Only with the cessation of the struggle for life is sincerity perfectly possible. Beyond these primitive forms of deceit, we have ' contractual' veracity to ' keep one's word,' ' be what one seems to be'; this is the central form under which veracity is recognized as a virtue, and it is obviously a form of active probity rather than of intellectual truthfulness. How then does intellectual veracity develop and acquire a moral value ? It is relatively late, for early intellectual activity is relatively restricted and individual, and such veracity is more than a simple prolongation of reason and knowledge. It implies a conception of truth and knowledge as social goods to which have a claim, and that this appears late is shown by the distinction of cor-</page><page sequence="16">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 97 rect reasoning and the social duty of veracity for the rationalists of the seventeenth century, by the late development of the historic conscience, and by the purely social end of intolerance in its first manifestations. Three principal causes brought about the appearance of intellectual veracity as a virtue: (a) the increasing importance of science in the amelioration of human life; (b) the diffusion of instruction; (c) the division of scientific labor, which for a long time was both an individual task and purely specu- lative. Technical knowledge, when it finally appears, is a social interest of the first rank. It required division of labor, and thus the veracity of the collaborators became essential. With it comes the recognized need of uni- versal instruction, as the value of, a man to society depends on his intel- lectual ability. The idea of the duty of all to extend truth appears side by side with that of the right of all men to enjoy truth. Truth thus becomes a social good, and in consequence its requisite, intellectual veracity, be- comes a virtue. The question whether veracity is nothing more than a virtue is of course absurd, if one defines morality a piriori as an absolute, and therefore refuses to recognize a principle as moral unless it is at the same time a limit. But this is arbitrary, and it is not absurd to say that there is, in a certain sense, something superior to morality, and to ask how morality is related to this superior principle. This principle, which makes us averse to deception even when salutary or ethically justified, is the search for 'harmony with one's self,' for affirmation instead of negation. But by its generality this principle is logical and rational, not moral; its obligation is formal, while that of morality is real. Yet in veracity we have a special case in which the real matter of obligation and its abstract form almost coincide. Logically and psychologically, then, veracity is a priv- ileged duty. Its reasons extend beyond morality, and are both more general and more special than those of other duties. Ideally imposed by metaphysical necessity, it is like the other real virtues empirically founded on the data of human society. The mistake of the intellectualist theory is that it does not see the specific character of morality, and arbitrarily makes it absolute, thus losing all its real content. EDMUND H. HOLLANDS. The Right of Free Thought in Matters of Religion. FRANK GRANGER. Int. J. E., XIV, i, pp. i6-26. The world of practice should share in those benefits which philosophic thought may furnish. Social institutions exist that they may minister to human needs, but in their effort to meet man's practical wants they may overlook his higher interests. The highest of these is the free movement of thought in religion and the question is: How far is conformity to be exacted in matters of religion ? In particular, what attitude ought to be taken toward the imposition of religious tests upon teachers in England and elsewhere ? The objection to such tests arises from the fact that the results of the scientific method which are authoritative in secular investiga- tions conflict with traditional Biblical interpretation. If religion is to be</page><page sequence="17">98 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIII. kept in the schools and hypocrisy avoided by teachers, it must make terms with the scientific method. The legitimate claims of each must be recognized. Science must free men from fears of their own creation. What cannot be rationally explained in the Old or New Testaments should not be taught. Science is the only consistent revelation. All accounts of miracles and even the resurrection of the Christ are of psychological interest, but for the uses of faith, mere rubbish. The spiritual originality of Jesus and the influence of his life and teaching are all that can be accepted as valid. As regards the teacher's relation to the various religious bodies, that is part of the wider question as to whether one who holds to none of the creeds should be allowed to teach. Since the leaders in scientific thought are not orthodox, it is reasonable that atheists should be admitted to the rank and file of the teaching profession. Since the majority of English- men are not adherents of any religious sect, and since it appears impossible to frame a belief satisfactory to all, and, further, since the enforcement of religious tests is repugnant to the commonly accepted principles of toler- ance, all such tests should be abolished and all the penalties attending the expression of free thought removed. FRANK P. BUSSELL. Art and Morality. JAMES LAING. Int. J. E.' XIV, I, pp. 55-66. The art impulse, when it has issued in creation, is an exponent of the moral movement of its time. Primitive forms of spiritual expression lack definiteness. The Egyptians, Babylonians, and other ancient peoples tried to give sensuous form to their ethical and religious ideas, and the remains of their work testify to their striving and failure. Undeveloped moral in- stincts and contradictory moral practices are concomitants of purposeless art. The Egyptian sphinx alone shows artistic and ethical possibilities, for it expresses, as no other ancient art work, the eternal dualism of matter and spirit. Yet even here, barbarian art could not adequately express the conflict; its medium was imperfect. The Greek art impulse found its me- dium of expression in the human form. Unconscious of limitation, thought clothes itself in matter which becomes responsive to its highest possibility. The ethical ideals, freedom, harmony, beauty, corresponded for once to the artistic; and so long as art strove to interpret moral truth, it flourished. the decline of Greek art dates from its abandonment of this purpose and the substitution of 'art for art's sake.' Henceforward it lacked moral significance and degenerated into mere aestheticism. There was a parallel tendency in the state, and it too disintegrated. Not only this; the highest Greek art was selective. Sensuous beauty appealed to it. The form of the courtesan might be ideal; but the immorality for which she stood, when translated into a goddess by the hand of Praxitiles, was destructive to manhood and civic welfare. Mere aesthetic faith killed Greek art. The Stoic ideal spoke last in ancient art. It felt life's pathos, but its pessimism was fatal. Then Christianity came. Its universal moral ideal and pure enthusiasm for beauty flamed out in form and color. Be-</page><page sequence="18">No. i.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 99 yond expression even in painting, it yet glorified, exalted, and transfigured its art. The Madonna, which represents the divinity of motherhood, is the grandest ethical conception of the Middle Ages. In its representation of Jesus, it recognizes the supreme worth of man and idealizes service through sorrow. Yet it too perished as soon as it ceased to portray moral, which is to say religious, truth. Its life went out with its ideal. Within the past century, Goethe and Wordsworth are the creative artists most ade- quately representing moral progress. Their work transcends the sensuous- ness of the Greek and the mysticism of the Middle Ages, and, with perfect unity of spirit, grasps and realizes the deeper conception of the eternal and essential unity of the human and the divine. FRANK P. BUSSELL. Emerson and German Personality. KUNO FRANCKE. The International Quarterly, VIII, I, PP. 93-107. Essentially American as he was, Emerson had little appreciation of German life and manners, yet in spirit he was in close sympathy with German thought and feeling. The German, restricted in his external life by intense supervision, is perhaps for this very reason forced into a greater individuality of intellectual and moral life than is the American or Englishman. This German characteristic is preeminently Emerson's. In him as in the German, this spiritual individuality expresses itself in a contempt for appearances and a deep seriousness of purpose. From the same root springs also their common delight in small things, which made Emerson love to "Isit at the feet of the familiar, the low," and gave him the German conviction of the dignity of scholastic seclusion and simplicity. The natural counterpart of this is a strongly developed sense of the unity of all things, and a consciousness of the infinite spiritual whole of which they are parts. This, too, is characteristic alike of Emerson and the idealistic German poets and thinkers. The last and most important evidence of temperamental affinity, also springing from the same source, is courage of personal conviction and disdain of intellectual compromise. A more immediate connection lies in Emerson's relation to the great German idealists. From them he drew his inspiration, but in applying their thought to the needs of a young and growing nation instead of the disorganized society to which they spoke, he gave it a new vitality. The condition of the German state caused a certain over-refinement and aristocratic spirit, whereas the American Emerson was intensely democratic. While Fichte preached the entire self-surrender of the individual, Emerson, in a more wholesome atmosphere, taught the saner doctrine that the indi- vidual's highest service lies in his own complete development. Germany to-day demands the payment of Emerson's debt to her. The great indus- trial development of the nineteenth century has stunted her spiritual growth, and its scientific specialization has dwarfed her scholarly life. As a reaction against all this, a new spiritual life is stirring, which, in its demands for the ideals of Emerson, will establish a new intellectual bond between Germany and America.
