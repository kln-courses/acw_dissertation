A similar approach was taken by David and Lourandos (1998)  in an overview of rock art and archaeology in Cape York Peninsula, northern Queensland. This  chapter proposes to examine the rock art of the Wulk Lagoon area, northwestern Arnhem Land,  by using approaches discussed by Taçon and Brockwell (1995) and David and Lourandos (1998)  to analyse rock art, with a methodology that includes reference to environment, ecology and  climate change along with local archaeological sequences from excavated rockshelters.  The late Holocene archaeological record of Arnhem Land is abundant, owing to high levels  of Aboriginal occupation around the extensive wetlands and on the Arnhem Land plateau.  Investigations of stone artefact assemblages in Australia have utilised approaches such as  manufacturing technologies and proliferation events apparently linked to El Niño/Southern  Oscillation (ENSO) and subsequent responses to risk in a context of environmental change  (see Attenbrow et al. 2009; Clarkson 2002, 2007; Hiscock 2002, 2008, 2011; Hiscock and  Attenbrow 1998, 2005; Lamb and Clarkson 2005; Veth et al. 2011). Residential mobility has  also been assessed through characteristics such as the diversity and abundance of cultural materials  in archaeological assemblages (see Andrefsky 2005, 2009; Kintigh 1984, 1989; Thomas 1973,  1989). In our case, here we try to understand Aboriginal occupation and behaviour in the Wulk  Lagoon area, on the East Alligator River, over the past 1500 years via the distribution of its rock  art (Figure 2.1).  Previous archaeological investigations in the region have usually paid minor attention to the  rock art (see Allen and Barton 1989; Hiscock 1999, 2008, 2011; Schrire 1982). Hiscock (2008)  has repeatedly pointed out that the art encodes valuable information, but identifies current  shortcomings for true archaeological interpretation. Nevertheless, valuable advances in rock  art research elsewhere have drawn on climate and environmental change (see McDonald 2015;  McDonald and Veth 2013), pigment studies (see Huntley 2012; Huntley et al. 2014; Wesley  et al. 2014) and ‘direct’ dating (see McDonald et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2009; Watchman 2000;  Watchman and Jones 2002; Watchman et al. 1997, 2010). Each provides valuable information,  allowing rock art to be better integrated into discussions of Aboriginal pasts. </page> <page sequence="4"> 22    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 2.1 Location of Wulk Lagoon study area, western Arnhem Land, Northern Territory.

People and fish    23  At Wulk Lagoon, faunal themes are well evident, especially fish. Fish and other animals not  only represent food resources, but also reference points for more esoteric aspects of life, as we  know from ethnography both here and elsewhere. In the East Alligator River region, fish signal  estuarine and freshwater ecologies and the widespread geomorphological changes that took place  during the mid to late Holocene. Wulk Lagoon’s rock art also contains many examples of the  anthropomorphic ‘Energetic Figure’ (Taçon 1989a, 1989b), ‘Complete Figure’, and ‘X-ray’ styles  (see Chippindale and Taçon 1993, 1998) (for descriptions of the various art styles mentioned in  this chapter, see Wesley 2015). The emergence of these rock art styles, or manners of depiction,  their variation and their distributions across the landscape are important for understanding late  Holocene occupation of the region. We thus ask of Wulk Lagoon’s rock art:  • Was it evenly produced across the landscape during the late Holocene? • To what degree have climate and environment influenced human occupation and mobility,  and how can the art aid us in this quest? • Through time, did the positioning of rock art change across the landscape? • What were the major subjects expressed in the art, and did these vary across space or change  through time? • Within rockshelters, was the rock art produced during occupation, or were the two largely  mutually exclusive? Significant changes in the environment and ecology of the East Alligator River have previously  been noted for the period following sea level stabilisation c. 6000 years ago (e.g. Chappell 1988;  Chappell and Grindrod 1985; Clark and Guppy 1988; Grindrod 1988; Hope et al. 1985;  Russell-Smith 1985a, 1985b; Wasson 1992; Woodroffe 1988; Woodroffe et al. 1985a, 1985b,  1986, 1987, 1988). Archaeological research nearby has shown the subsequent dramatic impacts  of marine and estuarine change on human occupation and mobility, on the plains and on the  plateau generally (Allen and Barton 1989; Bourke et al. 2007; Brockwell 1989, 1996; Hiscock  1999; Hiscock et al. 1992; Jones 1985; Kamminga and Allen 1973; Meehan et al. 1985; Schrire  1982). The last 6000 years saw new economic strategies develop, presumably to deal with these  environmental changes, but also in response to social conditions. Excavations at rockshelter sites  such as Birriwilk, Ngarradj Warde Djobkeng, Malakunanja II (Madjedbebe), Nawamoyn, Pari- Pari and Jimeri (Jimede) clearly show the changes that occurred in diet, occupation and stone  tool technologies (see Figure 1.1 for site locations) (Allen and Barton 1989; Hiscock 1999, 2011;  Kamminga and Allen 1973; Schrire 1982; Shine et al. 2013). However, these excavations tell us  much less about changes in rock art for that same period of time.  Wulk Lagoon’s rock art appears to be consistent with Chaloupka’s (1977, 1984, 1985,  1993) sequence of major rock art styles that followed post-glacial sea-level rise. But there  are also limitations  to attributing, reducing even, stylistic change to environmental change  (see  Chippindale  and Taçon 1998; Lewis 1988). The late Holocene rock art is diverse and  abundant, even within broad stylistic phases (Chaloupka 1977, 1984, 1985, 1993; Chippindale  and Taçon 1998; Lewis 1988; Taçon 1989a, 1989b), and preservation has played its part.  Nevertheless, it presents a rich opportunity to examine depictive or symbolic aspects of culture  and cultural diversity, and in relation to occupation.  The study area: Wulk Lagoon To investigate degrees of abundance and diversity in depictive behaviour – how people marked  the land – a 3.5 km2 sandstone outcrop next to Wulk Lagoon was surveyed on the western side  of the East Alligator River’s coastal plain (Figure 2.1). Wulk Lagoon is in the traditional estate of  the Manilakarr clan of the Erre language group. It and nearby palaeo-channels form important  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="6"> 24    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia water features parallel to the northwestern edge of the sandstone plateau. It is in Mamadewerre  Sandstone (part of the Kombolgie Sub-Group), a cross-bedded quartzose sandstone with medium  to very coarse grain, and siliceous sandstone. Outcropping rock is generally found as sandstone  tors, platforms and escarpment features (Duggan 1994; Needham 1984; Senior and Smart 1976;  Sweet et al. 1999). The sandstone outcrop at Wulk Lagoon is bounded by extensive coastal plains  of the East Alligator River, rich in alluvial sediments with large lagoons, palaeo-channels and  Melaleuca sp., Eleocharis dulcis and Oryza rufipogon-dominated swamps and sedge-lands.  The Wulk Lagoon area first came to prominence for its rock art during the 1948 American- Australian Scientific Expedition to Arnhem Land through a number of publications by Charles  Mountford (1956, 1964, 1965, 1975). The outlying sandstone hills next to Wulk Lagoon  were called ‘Inagurdurwil’ by Mountford (1956). This is a name that is not recognised by  Manilakarr Traditional Owners today; Gunn (1992) suggested that it may have been provided  by an Aboriginal informant from Gunbalanya rather than by an Erre speaker. Mountford was  particularly attracted to the detailed hunting scenes in the art, discussing them in detail along  with the greater significance of the rock art seen during the expedition. These scenes and motifs  at the Inagurdurwil galleries include images of running figures and men hunting (see Bühler et al.  1965:209). Mountford (1964, 1965, 1975) discussed techniques, materials and pigments used  to make rock art in the region, using Inagurdurwil as a primary example. He refers to the rock  art of western Arnhem Land as by far the most colourful he had encountered in Australia, again  with specific reference Inagurdurwil (Mountford 1964:12). Fred McCarthy (1965) was also part of that same 1948 expedition; he provided an overview  of the archaeology. Some of the material he wrote about includes rock paintings from western  Arnhem Land, X-ray and ‘spirit’ paintings, and painted caves at Red Lily (Wulk) Lagoon and  elsewhere on the Manilakarr estate. McCarthy (1965) discusses ‘Mormo’ and ‘Mimi’ spirits, and  reports X-ray paintings from Inagurdurwil, along with descriptions of the purposes of magic,  increase rites and the education of boys, each a significant feature of cultural knowledge for  Manilakarr Traditional Owners. Further research at Wulk Lagoon was later undertaken by Jan  Jelinek. Jelinek (1986) incorporated Inagadurwil in his general schema of western Arnhem Land  rock art, studying rock art sites Inagurdurwil I to VI in particular. His stylistic identifications,  chronological assessments and interpretations of the archaeological significance of these sites  are highly problematic, as they were made without reference to previous research while making  highly improbable stylistic chronologies. Later, in 1990, Gunn (1992) undertook a detailed  survey of surrounding parts of the Manilakarr estate, recording rock art imagery from numerous  sites, including several at Wulk Lagoon. He documented sacred and cultural knowledge relating  to Dreaming images and Spirit-Beings, such as Birriwilk (‘old lady’), Rainbow Serpent (Ngalyod),  barramundi, malevolent spirits (Namarodo and Marlwah), ‘old hairy spirit’ (Djidjnguk) and  ‘scarecrow figure’ (Djiworrn Djiworrn).  Western Arnhem Land during the late Holocene Previous archaeological discussions by Allen and Barton (1989), Brockwell (1989, 1996),  Hiscock (1999), Hiscock et al. (1992), Jones (1985), Meehan et al. (1985), Schrire (1982) and  others all refer to important Holocene environmental transformations for the region. Initial post- glacial sea-level rise would have affected Aboriginal economic and, probably, social order, given  the vast exposed landscapes that came to be inundated by rising seas. Since then, the past c. 6000  years saw two major environmental phases along the Alligator Rivers: a major ‘Big Swamp’ phase  (c. 6000 to 4000 BP) followed by ‘Sinuous’ and ‘Cuspate’ phases (4000 BP to present), which,  in due course, came to see a ‘Freshwater’ period of wetland development (1500 BP to present)  (Allen and Barton 1989; Jones 1985; Kamminga and Allen 1973; Schrire 1982). Throughout  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="7"> 2.  People and fish    25  this time, Aboriginal people continued to occupy the region, as indicated by archaeological  deposits in rockshelter sites at and near Wulk Lagoon, including the Birriwilk site a short distance  south  (Shine et al. 2013). Shine et al. (2013:72) dated the initial use of the Birriwilk shelter  c. 4865–5065 cal BP, with occupation continuing into the European-contact period.  Archaeological research in late Holocene wetlands of the nearby plains found ecological diversity  to be as important as biomass for Aboriginal settlement (Brockwell 1989; Brockwell et al. 2001;  Guse 1992; Hiscock et al. 1992; Meehan et al. 1985). Resource biodiversity is usually highest  along ecotonal margins between environmental zones. Archaeological studies have demonstrated  that ecotones between coastal plains and sandstone plateaux, such as at Wulk Lagoon, provided  attractive environments for occupation (Allen and Barton 1989; Hiscock 1999; Jones 1985;  Schrire 1982). Such ecotones helped structure resource distributions, and therefore affected  the mobility of resident and visiting groups. Areas of higher ecological diversity and resource  abundance were targeted, forming sustained subsistence-settlement strategies that made their  mark on the archaeological record (Allen and Barton 1989; Brockwell 1989, 1996; Hiscock  1999; Hiscock et al. 1992; Jones 1985; Meehan et al. 1985; Schrire 1982). Archaeological sites  located at such ecotones, and in areas of high biodiversity and resource abundance, have thus  been found to have substantial archaeological records, including rock art. But whereas these past  studies have focused on faunal remains and stone artefacts, here we examine the art on the rocks. Environmental change during the late Holocene A number of geomorphological studies have investigated landscape history in the greater Alligator  Rivers region (see above), but there are currently no palaeo-environmental reconstructions  specific to the East Alligator River at Wulk Lagoon. The closest research occurred c. 13 km west,  at Magela Creek, which focused on the ecological history of this backwater swamp and palaeo- tributary of the East Alligator River (East et al. 1987a, 1987b). Pollen evidence and radiocarbon  dates from mangrove muds and shell middens in the Magela floodplain suggest a longer Big  Swamp phase for the western East Alligator River region than for the South Alligator River,  with Rhizophora forest dominating the pollen record from c. 8000 to 3000 BP (Clark and  Guppy 1988:680–681). The Sinuous phase, which Clark and Guppy (1988:680–681) define as  a transitional period from mangrove forest to freshwater wetland, has a later and slightly shorter  record in the Magela floodplain than in the main South Alligator River region, lasting c. 1700  years from 3000 to 1300 BP. The increase in sedimentation rates during this period, together  with a subsequent phase of levee formation, may also be related to an increase in precipitation  and seasonality (Denniston et al. 2013; Lees and Clements 1987). This transitional period, which  experienced maximum environmental instability, produced the greatest vegetation diversity and  variability of the Holocene (Clark and Guppy 1988:680–681). This has major implications for  understanding changing patterns of Aboriginal occupation. Climate change during the late Holocene Faulkner (2009, 2011) notes that across northern Australia, Holocene climate change occurred in  tandem with sea-level rise, and stabilisation strongly influenced coastal ecology. Denniston et al.  (2013) show that past activity of the Indonesian-Australian Summer Monsoon (IASM), Inter- Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may have driven  precipitation variability since at least the mid-Holocene. In particular, the IASM strengthened  during the early Holocene, with enhanced peak rainfall between 8000 and 4000 years ago, with a  possible phase of increasing aridity from 6300 to 4500 years ago. This was followed by a decrease  in IASM strength around 4000 years ago, leading to lower rainfall. Denniston et al. (2013) found  peak aridity between 2000 and 1000 years ago, followed by a strengthening IASM developing  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="8"> 26    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia into the pattern we experience today. There is also evidence from Magela Creek and the Daly  River indicating a significant dry phase lasting c. 160 years from 690 to 530 BP (Wasson et al.  2010:172).  Increasing and decreasing precipitation have major impacts not only on vegetation and faunal  communities, but also on rates of sediment accumulation across the landscape, and on the  evolution of rivers and coastal systems. In contrast to fluctuating climates, studies of plant  species in plateau ravines have revealed that long-lived floristic communities survived all the  major climate changes since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a result of the presence of  permanent water sources and other factors (Russell-Smith et al. 1997). On this basis, it is likely  that fluctuating precipitation driven by ENSO-IASM interactions saw continuity in floristic and  faunal communities in dissected sandstone environments, despite a higher overall aridity. Lower  precipitation rates can have significant impacts on riverine evolution, with reduced water flows  unable to flush out sediments from the sandstone plateau, leading to the siltation of major river  systems, thereby choking mangrove communities and establishing massive floodplains, such as at  Wulk Lagoon (Chappell 1993, 1988; Woodroffe et al. 1993). These late Holocene fluctuations  in IASM precipitation would have aided the proliferation of freshwater swamps and wetlands,  significantly influencing shifts in woodland communities.  Recent rock art research in Arnhem Land Archaeological research has shown the great length of Aboriginal occupation across the ‘Top End’  of the Northern Territory (e.g. Allen and Barton 1989; Bird et al. 2002; Brockwell et al. 2009,  2011; Clarkson et al. 2017; David et al. 2012; Delannoy et al. 2013; Geneste et al. 2010, 2012;  Gunn and Whear 2007a, 2007b; Gunn et al. 2010a, 2010b, 2011; Hiscock 1999; Hiscock et al.  1992; Jones 1985; Meehan et al. 1985; Roberts et al. 1990; Schrire 1982; Shine et al. 2013). At  Nawarla Gabarnmang, a small piece of quartzite with charcoal lines was retrieved from buried  sediments dated to 27,000–28,000 cal BP, one of the oldest dated painted images in Australia  (David et al. 2012). Around that time, Aboriginal people were actively modifying the shape of  the shelter by knocking down rock pillars to expand the space within (see Chapter 10). Gunn et  al. (2012) further document that, during the late Holocene, rock art at this site included a range  of conventions, including what they termed ‘Northern’, ‘Bula’ and ‘Jawoyn’ styles, indicating  multiple signalling behaviour at a single site. The Nawarla Gabarnmang research demonstrates  how one site or site complex can reshape our understanding of rock art and Aboriginal occupation  of the Arnhem Land region. At the other end of the time scale, to the north of both Nawarla Gabarnmang and Wulk Lagoon,  in the coastal sandstone of the Wellington Range, major archaeological and rock art results have  also changed our way of thinking: in this case, as it relates to the period of culture contact  between Macassans, Europeans and Aboriginal peoples (Clark and May 2013; May et al. 2010,  2011; Taçon et al. 2010; Theden-Ringl et al. 2011; Wesley 2013; Wesley et al. 2012). Analysis of  painted ships and firearms caused us to rethink the involvement of Aboriginal people in maritime  and terrestrial industries in northern Australia (Wesley 2013; Wesley et al. 2012). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="9"> 2.  People and fish    27  Methods Rock art styles as chronologies As noted above, there has been a significant amount of research on Arnhem Land’s rock art since  the 1960s, leading to the identification of a number of major styles and chronologies (e.g. Brandl  1970, 1980; Chaloupka 1984, 1985, 1993; Chippindale and Taçon 1998; Edwards 1979; Jelinek  1986; Lewis 1988; Taçon 1989a, 1989b). These regional style chronologies have not made much  use of absolute chronometric dates, except in the case of beeswax figures (e.g. Taçon et al. 2004).  Although Rosenfeld and Smith (1997:407) note that using ‘style’ can be problematic for the  definition of chronologies, they also emphasise its value when rigorously applied. Here we rely largely on Chippindale and Taçon’s (1993, 1998) revised style chronology for  western Arnhem Land. In a study such as ours at Wulk Lagoon, we need to be clear as to how  style, and age, are given to the art, for we are working without absolute dates. Chaloupka (1993),  Chippindale and Taçon (1998), Lewis (1988) and Taçon’s (1988) identifications of late Holocene  art styles, for example, have significantly affected how most, and perhaps all, researchers think  of the sequence of stylistic conventions for this broad period of time (see the chronological table  in Chippindale and Taçon 1998:107). As Chippindale and Taçon (1998) note, the Arnhem  Land sequence has been developed mostly by seriating superimposed classes of painted motifs  (cf. Lyman and O’Brien 2006). This includes both the presence and absence of fauna known,  or thought, to have been associated with particular environmental conditions (Chaloupka  1993) and weaponry (Lewis 1988). These were perhaps the most viable approaches available  to researchers since critical analysis of Arnhem Land rock art began in the early 1970s. Formal  analyses of Rainbow Serpents, ‘Yam’ figures, and X-ray motifs have added to this schema, with  links to climate and environmental change (Chaloupka 1993; Chippindale and Taçon 1998;  Taçon 1994; Taçon and Brockwell 1995; Taçon et al. 1996).  Although each chronological model has its problems and limitations (see Bednarik 2012, 2014a,  2014b), the Arnhem Land style chronologies proposed by the above authors largely converge  towards a broadly acceptable temporal schema (Figure 2.2), with all researchers also recognising  that absolute dates are required to better understand the ‘real’ age of each style.  Survey strategy Wulk Lagoon provides an important lens for the archaeology of art at the interface of the Stone  Country and the extensive coastal plains. This is a varied landscape, where questions of taphonomy  are important for understanding the frequency of art and of art styles and conventions. To deal  with such questions, a small sample area was intensively surveyed at Wulk Lagoon as a way  of assessing how the larger rock art galleries that preferentially feature in the archaeology, and  focal research areas in the escarpment base, compare to the whole. Also to be considered is the  three-dimensional nature of the rock escarpment. Rock art occupies a complex space in this  landscape, where elevated areas erode and valleys tend to accumulate rocks and finer sediments  (see Chapter 1), so we divide the study area into three major zones: the escarpment base, the  steeply eroded sides and the rocky hilltops. This enables us to provide samples from different  geomorphological, and erosional/depositional, zones. Of particular interest is whether the late  Holocene saw all these zones used for rock art production and occupation. By stratifying the  survey area in this way, we could also test for preservation and occupation bias in the resulting  patterns.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="10"> 28    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 2.2 Composite rock art phases.

People and fish    29  Assessing mobility A number of analytical techniques have been developed to model mobility and intensities of site  use (e.g. Andrefsky 2005; Baxter 2001; Kaufmann 1998; Kintigh 1984, 1989; Thomas 1973,  1989). Many make use of measures of resource diversity and/or richness in the environment,  or as evident in the archaeological record. Two properties are usually considered: the number of  distinct classes present; and their degree of evenness or uniformity (Kintigh 1989:26). Thomas  (1989:86) proposes that the overall relationship between the number of archaeological classes  and the number of individual items is influenced by ecological, technological, informational  (i.e. ‘traditional ecological knowledge’) and scheduling factors. He describes three types of sites,  distinguished (and measurable) by their archaeological richness: single-use/activity-specific  sites, short-term occupation sites and long-term occupation sites. Frequently occupied sites are  identified by technologically and typologically diverse stone tool assemblages that might have  been used for many purposes, and over long periods of time. Less frequently occupied sites were  usually used for more ephemeral, more specific, even single tasks; they have less diverse stone tool  assemblages than the more frequently occupied sites. Infrequently occupied sites were even more  task-specific, and here stone tool assemblages are the least diverse and least abundant (Thomas  1989:86). Does this kind of diversity and richness modelling also apply to rock art, and to the rock art  sites of Wulk Lagoon? To explore this, we apply Thomas’s (1989) principles of frequency and  abundance of stone artefacts to the art. The production of rock art involves the use of materials,  and it takes time and energy, much like the production and use of stone tools does. We would  thus expect the greatest diversity and frequency of rock art styles, motifs and elements to occur  also at the most frequented places (Thomas 1989:86). The archaeological classes we use are the  rock art styles, anthropomorphic motif types and elements and zoomorphic motif types. Places  where rock art was frequently produced are predicted to be rich and diverse in their art styles,  motifs and elements; less frequented sites to have intermediate levels of diversity and abundance;  and rarely visited places, low diversity and low abundance. Applying these principles of diversity  and abundance to rock art may provide a new way of investigating patterns of visitation and  engagement, including aspects of occupational intensity not previously considered in Australian  rock art research.  Taphonomy All archaeological assemblages in Arnhem Land possess taphonomic limitations. Owing to high  rainfall levels associated with the IASM, and the predominantly sandy soils, faunal remains and  other organic materials are usually poorly preserved (see Jones 1985; Schrire 1982). Highly  seasonal climates see annual cycles of drying and wetting, burrowing animals and high levels of  soil mobility and/or soil acidity – all poor conditions for the preservation of organics (see Bourke  2000; Brockwell 2009; Gregory 1998; Guse 2006; Mowat 1994, 1995). Therefore, the potential  for long-term preservation of both on-wall art and buried pigments requires systematic assessment.  At Wulk Lagoon, a number of pigment types have been found, some in reasonable quantities,  during excavations: ferrous oxides and haematite (reds, orange), kaolinite (white), whelwellite  (white), kaolinitic claystone (white, red, yellow, orange) (Chaloupka 1993; Taçon 1989a, 1989b;  Wesley et al. 2014). Claystone, whelwellite and kaolinite pigments are thought not to preserve  well, in part because they are soluble in water. This has often led researchers to assume that  paintings (and motif types) made with such pigments date to the mid to late Holocene, but  not earlier, for surely they would have disintegrated since then. Climatic regimes with annual  wet tropical monsoons will have quickened the dissolution of these soluble pigments, and the  strengthening of the IASM through the mid to late Holocene with increased seasonal rainfall  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="12"> 30    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia would have impacted on the art. The presence of white pigment in Arnhem Land rock art may  not mean a late antiquity, but in more exposed conditions it more likely does, and thus helps in  assigning a time frame.  Results In 2011, a total of 77 rock art sites were recorded within the 3.5 km2 Wulk Lagoon study area,  providing a mean density of 33.4 sites per km2 (Figure 2.3). In this region, we estimate there  are 13,000 rock art motifs painted on approximately 460 sandstone panels. Eight rock art sites  face the coastal plain, with the remainder 70 sites on the sandstone outlier itself. The majority  of sites were found on the escarpment base, hillside, hilltop or on independent tor outcrops  (Table 2.1). Of the 77 rock art sites, 44 are ‘rock art panels’ (rock art on one to three panels  with no other archaeological features) and 33 are ‘rockshelters’; this differentiation was made  to assess the location of the art relative to the size and nature of its site context. Documented  archaeological features include grinding hollows and surfaces, buried cultural deposits, stone  arrangements, hearths, stone artefacts, stone quarries, faunal remains, human burials, ‘contact’  materials and wooden artefacts. Figure 2.4 shows their distribution at Wulk Lagoon. Table 2.2  indicates that, on average, only two archaeological features are present per site. An archaeological  excavation was undertaken at Minjnymirnjdawabu 5 (MN05); in conjunction with the survey, it  added valuable information regarding the timing of occupation and geomorphological processes  at Wulk Lagoon.

There are, on average, 4.5 rock art styles  per site (median = 3; maximum = 19). Zoomorphs and anthropomorphs are evenly represented  (in 84.4 per cent vs 83.1 per cent of sites, respectively, averaging 4.5 vs 5.1 per site). Eighteen  sites have 100 or more images, the largest being RLB032 with c. 3000 (Figure 2.5). The median  of 15 motifs per site is more indicative of the trend, as a high standard deviation of 485.3  shows considerable variation in numbers, which range from one to c. 3000. The average number  of panels per site is skewed by a few sites with high numbers.  Figure 2.5 Distribution of rock art sites, showing number of artworks in each site.  Source: Daryl Wesley. A broad range of rock art styles is found at  Wulk Lagoon (Figure 2.6). Large Fauna, Large  Human, Simple Figures and Complete Figure  Complex paintings predominate, followed  by X-ray, Early X-ray and Early Decorative  Infill. Energetic Figure and X-ray motifs are  most common in the major site complexes.  Energetic Figures are especially common at the  base of the rock outcrops, whereas X-ray and  Complex Decorative figures are most common  at the two major art complexes on top of the  plateau. These three rock art styles clearly  superimpose most others, indicating that they  are amongst the most recent. Many rock art  panels have multiple layers of superimposition.

People and fish    33  Zoomorphs Zoomorphs include dingo, marsupial, echidna, flying fox, macropod, reptile, goanna, frill-neck  lizard, crocodile (freshwater and saltwater), snake, python, long-necked turtle, short-necked  turtle, fish, thylacine and bird. Fish motifs are the most abundant; they are discussed at greater  length below. Macropods, reptiles, birds, goannas and snakes are each present in more than 20  per cent of sites (Figure 2.7).  Paintings of fish occur in 55 sites. Taçon (1988:5) noted that 43 different native fish species are  known from the Alligator Rivers region, with a dozen being consistently depicted in the rock art.  He further found that most X-ray depictions are of barramundi, saratoga, fork-tail catfish, eel- tail catfish and mullet. Other depicted species include the freshwater longtom, archer fish, black  bream, boney bream and terapon perches or grunters (Tacon 1988:5).  Here we analyse 385 fish motifs from the art at Wulk Lagoon. Species include barramundi  (Lates calcarifer), saratoga (Scleropages jardini), fork-tailed catfish (a.k.a. ‘boofhead’ catfish)  (Hexanematichthys leptaspis), eel-tailed catfish (Neosilurus hyrtlii), mullet (Liza alata), freshwater  longtom (Strongylura kreffti), archer fish (Toxotes chatareus), toothless catfish (Anodontiglanis  dahli) and black catfish (a.k.a. narrow-fronted tandan) (Neosilurus ater) (Figure 2.8). Additional  to these, many fish depictions could not be identified to species.  Figure 2.7 Proportion of sites with each type Figure 2.8 Number of paintings by fish taxa. of zoomorph (n = 77 sites). Source: Jerome Mialanes. Source: Jerome Mialanes. Figure 2.9 indicates the manner in which the fish were painted. The study found 54.5 per cent of  the fish paintings were in a Late Phase–style. Estuarine species are more frequent than freshwater- only species. Fork-tail catfish, and catfish in general, are the most common. Their habitats can  vary from brackish estuaries to only freshwater: for example, Hexanematichthys leptaspis inhabits  both estuarine and freshwater habitats, whereas Neosilurus hyrtlii and Neosilurus ater only live in  freshwater, be it still or flowing in streams, billabongs or pools.  The painted fish at Wulk Lagoon are associated with types of waterways that evolved locally only  after post-glacial sea-level rise c. 8500–8000 BP (Woodroffe et al. 1985a, 1985b, 1986, 1988).  Between 8000 and 3000 BP, the Wulk Lagoon sandstone headland became surrounded by  wetlands, swamps and paleo-channels of the former East Alligator River (Hope et al. 1985:239).  Large backwater swamps and billabongs are thought to have increased in number in the Alligator  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="16"> 34    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Rivers region after 3000 BP (Clark and Guppy 1988:680–681; Hope et al. 1985:240).

Figure 2.9 Painting manner for fish, by topographic zone. Source: Jerome Mialanes. Anthropomorphs At Wulk Lagoon, anthropomorphs include a range of shapes and associated items of material  culture (see Figure 2.10). Human or human-like figures occur in over 80 per cent of art sites.  The majority are males with spears. Many have headdresses and spearthrowers, and a range of  spear types is depicted. There is greater diversity in types of weapons than there is in armlets,  neckbands, aprons, fans and bags. There are also high numbers of scenes where human figures  are engaged in what appear to be ceremony (10.3 per cent), fighting (11.6 per cent) and hunting  (23.3 per cent); most of these are in what are thought to be late Holocene styles. Some scenes are  in the Northern Running Figure style.  The Minjnymirnjdawabu sites:  MN01, MN05 and MN12 A detailed study was undertaken of 65 rock  art panels at three of the Minjnymirnjdawabu  sites  (MN01, MN05 and MN12). Here  the art is again mainly in late Holocene  styles. Pigment colours are diverse, many  consisting of hues of red, white, orange or  yellow (Figure 2.11). Many paintings are in  two or more colours, and much pigment was  used. Anthropomorphs and fish motifs are  again common. Fish were painted in three  distinctive patterns: solid infill, outline and  X-ray (Figure 2.12).

This is a rockshelter with a large overhang, 8 m long,  5 m wide, with an average height of 2.75 m from floor to ceiling. The ceiling and walls have  a number of panels with multiple layers of art, including an impressive array of X-ray paintings  of local freshwater fish. The site also contains the famous ‘blue’ contact painting of a sailing ship.  Grinding hollows and surfaces are abundant, attesting to much occupation.  Three 1 × 1 m test pits were excavated: one against the wall (Test Pit B), one just outside the  dripline (Test Pit A) and one outside the overhang to test the depth of sediment drop-off  (Test Pit C). Test Pit A quickly bottomed out on a slab of sandstone. Test Pits B and C were  deeper, providing information on occupation beginning shortly after 1000 cal BP (Table 2.3).

The deposits contain post-contact objects such as glass flakes and fragments, ceramic sherds,  buttons, bullets, metal fragments and glass beads. Stone artefacts are mostly quartz flakes and  quartzite. There are many red, yellow, orange and white ‘ochre’ fragments. A number of these  are haematite crayons with striations clearly evident. Five beeswax fragments and a nodule of  Reckitt’s Blue were recovered from Test Pit B. Faunal remains include barramundi (Lates calcarifer)  and catfish (Arius leptaspis) otoliths, freshwater turtle bone fragments, varanid (monitor lizard)  teeth and freshwater bivalve shells (Mytilus sp.); highly fragmented, non-diagnostic burnt bone  is abundant. There is evidence of bioturbation of sediments by macropods, introduced feral  animals and human hearth-building.  Figure 2.15 Site MN05. Source: Photograph by Daryl Wesley. Excavation and ground penetrating radar (GPR) surveys indicate significant build-up of sands  at the base of the Wulk Lagoon sandstone escarpment. Nott (2003) provides estimates of up to  6 m of accumulated sands from the plateau onto the coastal plains, dating back from Pleistocene  times. In Test Pit C outside the MN05 shelter, 1 m of sand has accumulated in 1000 years.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="19"> 2.  People and fish    37  Excavations at MN05 and nearby Birriwilk (Shine et al. 2013; see Figure 1.1) show that cultural  deposits have limited depth confined to the last 5000 years at the edge of the Wulk Lagoon  sandstone outlier. Here any evidence of early Holocene or Pleistocene occupation would be  buried under several metres of aggraded sand and flood deposits. Discussion Figure 2.16 shows two things for Wulk Lagoon’s rock art by temporal phase: 1) the proportion  of total number of rock art styles; and 2) the proportion of total number of motifs (of any style)  (see Figure 2.2 for details of each phase). There are few sites with Early Phase styles (those that  are thought to be older than c. 8000 BP), and few motifs within those sites that do have them.  Many (58 per cent) of the sites have Middle Phase styles (c. 8000 to 3000 BP), but these contain  a moderate proportion of motifs (only 25 per cent of the overall rock art assemblage). There are  a moderate number (33 per cent) of sites with Late Phase (c. 3000 BP to present) styles, but  these contain the majority of motifs (accounting for 70 per cent of the total assemblage). Most  of the art in the 18 sites with more than 100 images (which together account for 90 per cent of  Wulk Lagoon’s rock art) are in late Holocene styles. At Wulk Lagoon, therefore, during the late  Holocene, rock art becomes very abundant in a moderate number of focal sites; it is less evenly  distributed across the landscape than previously. Paintings of fish are fairly evenly distributed between the Middle and Late Phases: 45.5 per cent  are in styles of the Middle Phase, 54.5 per cent in those of the Late Phase. This is consistent with  a heightened importance of fish following risen sea levels, coastal infill and the development of  swamps and waterways on the floodplains after c. 6000 BP. At sites MN01, MN05 and MN12,  most paintings are of fish (55.5 per cent) and anthropomorphs (31.5 per cent), and of these  most are in Late Phase (i.e. late Holocene) styles; 71 per cent of rock art scenes at Wulk Lagoon  (i.e. ceremony, fighting and hunting) are also in Late Phase styles (all others are of the Middle  Phase). Here, there is clearly a proliferation of rock art in the Middle and Late Phases when fish,  anthropomorphs and scene depictions predominate.

Source: Jerome Mialanes. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="20"> 38    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Macropods occur in 36.3 per cent of Wulk Lagoon sites, often in Large Naturalistic or Large  Fauna styles. An R2 value of 0.4846 indicates no preferential co-occurrence of zoomorphs with  anthropomorphs. This suggests that in many cases sites were selected to paint zoomorphs or  anthropomorphs, but not both.  Much of Wulk Lagoon’s rock art is found at the top of the sandstone outlier, with fewer sites  along the base of the escarpment (Figure 2.17). Figures 2.18 and 2.19 show the number of rock  art sites and art styles that occur, by geographic zone for each phase (see caption to Figure 2.19  for further description on calculation of number of art styles represented). During the Early and  Middle Phases, the art is most abundant on the hillsides; however, during the Late Phase, it is  fairly evenly distributed across all three zones.

(e.g. if there are two Late Phase sites on a hillside, one site with five paintings of one style and the other with three paintings  of another style, then that site will have two different art styles represented for that phase; to work out how many art styles  are represented in the hillside environment, all such Late Phase site values are summed). Source: Jerome Mialanes. These results suggest that during the late Holocene, pretty much all topographic zones of the  Wulk Lagoon sandstone outlier were inscribed with rock art. Taçon and Chippindale (1994),  Taçon and Brockwell (1995) and Hiscock (1999) have argued that the late Holocene saw rich  resource supplies on the floodplains, resulting in population growth and increasing regionalism of  clan estates: social organisation and land tenure systems shifted as clan estates with geographically  based totemic associations changed. This is consistent with the shifting distributions and peak  densities of rock art seen during the late Holocene at Wulk Lagoon. Here small clan estates  with focalised occupation used sites intensively into the ethnographic period, as evident by the  diverse and abundant rock art of the late Holocene. We suggest that this is evidence for lower  levels of residential mobility and greater rock art production than previously. This happened  at a time of increasing precipitation and strengthening of the IASM c. 1000 years ago, when  the East Alligator floodplain developed deep lagoons, shallow lakes and productive Eleocharis  and Melaleuca swamps. Across much of Arnhem Land, X-ray art and the Complete Figure  Complex flourished at this time, and there was a notable increase in the movement of exotic  raw materials for the production of stone artefacts (e.g. Shine et al. 2013). The rock art and  buried archaeological deposits of that time both seem to signal the onset of the kinds of cultural  practices encountered at the time of European contact.  In support of this interpretation, Wulk Lagoon boasts a wide variety of rock paintings we  might consider as scenes (n = 35) (Taçon 1994). May and Domingo Sanz (2010:41) discuss the  significance of rock art scenes as modes of encoding socio-cultural practices. At Wulk Lagoon,  late Holocene scenes have long been a focus of research (e.g. Chaloupka 1993; Jelinek 1986;  Mountford 1956; Moyle 1981), especially those depicting the playing of didjeridus, prominent  in at least eight scenes. The didjeridu is considered by Moyle (1981) to be a late Holocene  musical development in Arnhem Land, because of the rock art styles it is associated with.  Although scenes are also found during earlier phases, their proliferation and increased variability  during the late Holocene may be a reflection of the increasing density of local populations in  the Alligator Rivers region (May and Domingo Sanz 2010). In contrast to the early battle scenes  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="22"> 40    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia reported by Taçon and Chippindale (1994), at Wulk Lagoon those of the late Holocene generally  involve fewer personages. Scenes depicting groups of &gt;10 males engaged in either actual or ritual  combat, or hunting, express individual engagements in social events (see Figure 2.20).  Figure 2.20 Example of complex late Holocene art scene, Wulk Lagoon site RLL004. Source: Photograph by Paul Brugman. That people and fish predominate in the rock art of the late Holocene might be linked to  a number of factors. The emergence of freshwater wetlands c. 1500 years ago provisioned people  with an enormous diversity and abundance of resources, driving population numbers and  densities (see Hiscock 1999; Jones 1985). An intensifying IASM after c. 1000 years ago saw  greater precipitation and major flooding events that would have significantly impacted on the  development of freshwater systems in the Wulk Lagoon area (Denniston et al. 2013; Sandercock  and Wywroll 2005; Wasson et al. 2010). Whether regional population densities were a result of  actual population growth or a reorganisation of existing groups from the broader region, mid  to late Holocene rock art production signal increasing occupation intensities in the vicinity of  Wulk Lagoon. With a greater population exploiting newly developed wetland resources came  greater levels of rock art production, increased rates of deposition of food refuse within sites and  increased stone artefact production (see also Allen and Barton 1989; Jones 1985; Schrire 1982;  Shine et al. 2013). In Arnhem Land, the proliferation of rock art during the late Holocene has been noted in  a  number of previous studies (e.g. Chaloupka 1993; Taçon 1989a, 1989b). However, its  significance is often ignored or sidelined in narratives of the past (Hiscock 1999). Alongside  the development of new stone tool technologies, perhaps to manage risks or exploit emerging  environments, the proliferation of late Holocene rock art at Wulk Lagoon is an integral expression  of the reorganisation of human populations in the Alligator Rivers region.
