<plain_text><page sequence="1">XVII.-SHELLEY'S DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY VERSUS CHRISTIANITY Among the great Einglish poets of the Romantic period Shelley was the poet of religious as well as of social and political revolt. His mind was preoccupied, especially in the formative years of his life, with the subject of religion, and it is significant that the piece of writing which first attracted any considerable attentioll to him was the essay The Necessity of Atheism, published in 1811 when he was eighteen anld a student of Oxford. The essay not only is revolutionary in spirit, but also reveals a mind preco- ciously occupied with religious problems. With condensed expression and close-knit argument the essay attempts briefly to prove nothing less than the non- existence of Deity. The proof was easy: there are only three souirces of evidence-the senses, reason, and testi- mony-and these do not suffice to establish belief. The major premise in the essay is really the statement that " the senses are the sources of all knowledge to the mind." If we grant this, the argument is logical enough. Shelley, of course, had no doubt of its validity. Yet the truly religious mind questions it persistently and rightly. It is easier to believe in the existence of Deity than in Shelley's major premise. In a letter to Elizabeth Hitchener, written in June, 1811, several months after the publication of The Neces- sity of Atheism, Shelley reveals what was probably the direct source of the major premise in his essay: Locke proves that there are no innate ideas, that in consequence, there can be no innate speculative or practical principles, thus over- turning all appeals of feeling in favor of Deity, since thaAt feeling must be referalble to some origin. There must have fbeen a time when 444</page><page sequence="2">DOCTRINE OFi' NECESSITY VERS US CHRISTIANITY 445 it did not exist; in consequence, *a time when it began to exist. Since all ideas are derived from the senses, this feeling must have originated from some sensual excitation, consequently the possessor of it may be aware of the time, of the circumstances, attending its commencement. Locke proves this Iby induction too clearly to admit of rationial cbjection.1 It is also to be noted that twice in the essay Shelley asserts that "belief is not an act of volition " and that therefore " no degree of criminality is attachable to dis- belief." And in a letter to his father dated February 8, 1811, first puiblished by F. Ingpen in his Shelley in England (1917), he attacked Christianity on the same grounds. Of the coming of Christ as being called good tidings he says: " It is hard to believe how those tidings could be good which are to condemn more than half of the world to the Devil, for, as St. Athanasius says, 'ITe who does not believe should go into eternal fire '-as if belief were voluntary, or an action, not a passion (as it is) of the mind." Accordingly, to him who perceives that belief is puirely involuntary and who considers there is insufficient testimony to prove the being of Deity, atheism is a neces- sity. In the many letters Shelley wrote to Miss Hitchener between June, 1811, and June, 1812, inclusive, there is revealed a growing dislike of Christianity which was to bturst forth in full intensity and power a little later in Queen Mab. This development of his hatred of Chris- tianity is accompanied, curiously enough, by a growth in his views toward, rather than away from, the tenets of the Christian faith. He is now willing, for instance, to admit the existence of Deity, provided you believe in his kind of Deity: 1 In another letter to Miss Hitchener, dated June 25, 1811, and in still another to her, dated Aug. 18, 1811, he repeats these references to Locke's arguments against innate ideas.</page><page sequence="3">446 S. F. GINGERICH I have lately had some conversation with Southey which has elicited my true opinions of God. He says I ought not to call myself an atheist, since in reality I believe that the universe is God. I tell him I believe that God is another signification for the Universe. I then explain:-I think reason and analogy seem to countenance the opinion that life is infinite; that, as the soul which now animates this frame was once the vivifying principle of the infinitely lowest link in the chain of existence, so it is ultimately destined to attain the highest; that everything is animation (&amp;.s explained in my last letter); and in consequence, being infinite, we can never arrive at its termination. How, on this hylpothesis, are we to arrive at a First Cause? iSouthey admits and believes this. Can he be a Christian? Can God be three? 'Southey agrees in my idea of Deity,-the mass of infinite intelligence; I, you, and he, are constituent parts of this immeasuralble whole.' Likewise he asserts his belief in a certain kind of immor- tality: As I conceive (and as is certainly capalble of demonstration) that nothing can be annihilated, but that everything appertaining to nature, consisting of constituent parts infinitely divisible, is in a continual change, then do I suppose-and I think I have a right to draw this inference-that neither will soul perish; that in a future existence it will lose all consciousness of having formerly lived elsewhere,-will begin life anew, possibly under a shape of which we have no idea.' This view of immortality as impersonal is remarkably similar to that set forth just ten years later in the forty- second and forty-third stanzas of Adona?is. But it is the poem Queen Mab and the notes appended thereto, printed in 1813, that comprise Shelley's first stistained effort to express the whole of his mind. The poem is notorious as containing an outspoken and unblush- ing attack upon Christianity. According to the degree of seriousness with which we consider the matter we may either smile or become righteously indignant at his invee- 2 Letter to Miss Hitchener, Jan. 2, 1812. 5better to Miss Hitchener, June 20, 1811.</page><page sequence="4">DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY VERSUS CHRISTIANITY 447 tives against that religion which he describes as peopling "earth with demons, hell with men, and heaven with slaves." More important and interesting, however, than the attack itself are the philosophical grounds upon which it is made. At the age of nineteen or twenty Shelley would have scorned the idea of not being able to give a completely rational accouint of the faith that was in him. " The doctrine of Necessity," he says, " tends to introduce a great change into the established notions of morality, and utterly to destroy religion": Spirit of Nature! all-sufficing Power, Necessity! thou mother of the world! Unlike the God of human error, thou Requirest no prayers or praises. In the more philosophical passages the poet emphasizes the conviction that man and all things, from every atom, ' sentient both in unity and part," from " the, meanest worm that crawls in dust," to the " interminable wilder- ness of worlds, at whose immensity even soaring fancy staggers," that all pain and pleasure, all good and evil, "join to do the will of strong Necessity." There is no question but that at the time of writing the author considered the moral and religious deductions to he made from the poem far more important than its imaginative beauty. ience the " notes." In a letter to ATr. Hookam, the publisher, in January, 1813, he says: " The notes to ' Q. M.' will be long and philosophical. I shall take the opportunity, which I judge to be a safe one, of propagating my principles, which I decline to do syllo- gistically in a poem." In the notes he says: He who asserts the doctrine of Necessity means that, contem- plating the events which compose the moral and material universe, he beholds only an immense and uninterrupted chain of causes and</page><page sequence="5">4-48 S. F. GINGERICH effects, no one of which could occupy any other place than it does occupy, or act in any other place than it does act. ... Every human being is irresistibly impelled to act precisely as he does act: in the eternity which preceded his birth a chain of causes was gener- ated, which, operating under the name of motives, make it impossible that any thought of his mind, or any action of his life, should be otherwise than it is. It is well known that Shelley derived many of his doc- trines directly from William Godwin's Politiccal Justice. Yet we cannot help being slightly shocked, as in this particular instance, to note how the poet echoes the very words of his master. In Political Justice we read: He who affirms that all actions are necessary, means, that, if we form a just and complete view of all the circumstances in which a living or intelligent being is placed, we shall find that he could not in any moment of his existence have acted otherwise than he has acted. ... This view of things presents us with an idea of the universe as connected and cemented in all its parts, nothing in the boundless progress of things being capalble of happening, otherwise than it has actually ha,ppened. In the life of every human being there is a chain of causes, generated in that eternity which preceded his birth, and going on in regular procession through the whole period of his existence, in consequence of which it was impossible for him to act in any instance otherwise than he has acted. A sort of corollary to this doctrine is Shelley's theory that there is no creative mind in the universe. The nega- tion in the poem, " there is no God," Shelley says in the notes, "must be understood solely to affect a creative Deity. The hypothesis of a pervading Spirit coeternal 4It is clear that Godwin attached very great importance to these views, a poiint which Shelley could not have overlooked. In the introductory statements in the chapters on Free Will and Necessity, Godwin remarks: " It will be found upon maturer reflection that this doctrine of moral necessity includes in it consequences of the highest moment, and leads to a bold and comprehensive view of man and society, which cannot possibly be entertained by him who has embraced the opposite opinion." le also asserts that all his reason- ing is based on thiis doctrine as a postulate.</page><page sequence="6">DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY VERSUS CHRISTIANITY 449 with the universe remains unshaken." This Spirit, which has existed from all eternity and from which flows all life, has no power to make things. That it created the world is a pure superstition, Shelley holds, and the creature of this suiperstition is the God of the popular religion.5 Anid at this point in the notes there is incorporated the nain body of the essay, The Necessity of Atheism, with slight modifications in expression and occasionally in idea. One significant change occurs in the use of a single word. In the original essay Shelley had said in conclusion that " the mind cannot believe in the existence of a God." In the notes he changed this to-" the mind cannot believe in the existence of a creative God." Shelley had now grown to recognize the limitations of his original negation and believed in a living and animating Spirit pervading the frame of things. That is, he was not an atheist, as Southey had told him. Looking back, then, from Queen Mab to The Necessity of Atheism lone can see that from the beginning the vital thought with Shelley was not Atheism but Necessity. It is necessary that every thought of the mind and every act of life be just what they are, that the mind believe only that which it thinks true, that rewards and punishments based on belief are tyranny, that no personal responsibility really exists, that, in short, Necessity governs all life. Shelley's account of how this superstition arose is given in The Revolt of Islarm (1818): Some moon-struck sophist stood Watching the shade from his own soul upthrown Fill Heaven and darken Earth, and in such mood The Form he.saw and worshipped was 'his own, His likeness in the world's vast mirror shown; And 'twere an innocent dream, but that a faith Nursed by fear's dew of poison grows thereon. --Canto VIII,Stanza vi.</page><page sequence="7">450 S. F. GINGERICH In the imaginative passages of Queen Mab this law of Necessity is transformed into a vast and all-pervading Spirit, Soul of the Universe, which in its onward flow of being, from the lowest to the highest links in the chain of existence, is preparing the world for some sudden desir- able consummation. Though not perfectly fused with the argumentative elements of the poem, these passages have a poetical atmosphere not to be found in Godwin at all. In the more polemical parts of the poem and in the notes the poet, as we have seen,-on the basis of Necessity, violently attacked Christianity, and also kings and priests and institutions, which he conceived to have been produced by Christianity. The God of the Christian religion com- mands us to believe certain definite things and threatens our disbelief with everlasting punishment. Christianity assumes " that it is in our power to believe or not to be- lieve; whereas the mind can only believe that which it thinks true." Belief being involuntary,, the Christian religion attaches the highest possible degree of merit and demerit to that which is worthy of neither. Thus the obedience that Christianity demands, Shelley says, is " only the pitifuil and cowardly egotism of him who thinks he can do something better than reason." A philosopher of our own day, the late William James, with his "will to believe," would have been incomprehensible to the philosopher Shelley a hundred years ago. Godwin said that " man is really a passive and not an active being," and devoted one long chapter in Political Justice to prove that the mind is merely a mechanism and that even in volition it is altogether passive. Shelley accepted withouit qualification the doctrine of his master. It seems in dealing with the principle of Necessity in Queen Mab) Shelle,y was not fully aware that he was handling a two-edged sword. For why should kings</page><page sequence="8">DOCTRINUE OF NECESSITY VERSUS CHRISTIANITY 451 and priests and Christians be held responsible for their terrible deeds when, according to the theory of Necessity, they were irresistibly impelled to act precisely as they did act ? This, indeed, is the fundamental contradiction in the poem. If Shelley was utterly ineffectual in matters of practical reform, it was because he appealed to a prin- ciple of belief that has not the remotest connection with the springs of human action. Shelley's acceptance of the doctrine of Necessity was a temperamental need and not due wholly to chance acquaintance with Godwin's works at a favorable moment in his youth. To conceive of power in terms of personality was instinctively difficult for him; hence the abstractness and utter impersonality of the law of Necessity appealed to him. Then, too, he always longed intensely for a changeless state in a changing world, an immutable and eternal order of things. The conception, therefore, of a pervading spirit coeternal with the universe, never having been created, never to be destroyed, necessary in all its outer activities, with which " is no variableness, neither shadow of turning," seemed the very fulfillment of such intense longings. " The One remains, the many change and pass," he said in a famous figure in Adonais written in the mature years of his life. This doctrine also reduces the explanation of the universe to a single principle. To Shelley, who never was able to measure the complex forces that make up human life, the simplicity of this view commended itself. The doctrine of Necessity influenced in their youth the minds of two other great speculative and meditative English poets of the period, Wordsworth and Coleridge. Hazlitt quotes Wordsworth as saying to a young student of the Temple: " Throw away your books of chemistry and read Godwin on Necessity." Yet this was but a passing</page><page sequence="9">452 S. F. GIINGERICII phase of Wordsworth's youthful experience, for he soon shook off the influence and stood, as he says, in the presence of Nature, "a sensitive being, a creative soul." With Coleridge the theory played a much more impor- tant part. " I am a complete necessitarian," he wrote to Southey in 1794, and in another letter of about the same tinme he declared that he was an advocate of the automatism of man, believing that thought is only motion and that the mind is merely an automatic instrument through which the cosmic order finds an avenue of expression. Everv- where in Coleridge's early poetry mian is " predoomed," to llse Coleridge's word, to be precisely what he is in what- ever state you conceive him. Even the hero of The Ancient Mariner has no will of his own, but is a passive agent to powers outside himself, and is destined in a necessitarian spirit to pass from land to land alnd tell his strange story to such as are predoomed to hear it. Unlike Shelley, Coleridge did not deenm this doctrine opposed to the spirit of Christianity. Philosophical necessity was simply another word for religious predesti- nlation, which again, in Coleridge's mind, was an aspect of unity, all things, in a predestined way, working together for good in the universe. In later years Coleridge recanted this doctrine and asserted his belief in Free-will; but only, it seems, after he had woven such strong threads of evil habits about his life that most of his career then seemed a sort of fatal necessity. Unlike Wordsworth and Coleridge, Shelley did not experience any change of heart as regards Necessity. And here I take issue with various interpreters of Shelley. They say he was materialistic and necessitarian in Queen Mab, of course, but as soon as he had outgrown his boyish- ness he embraced a philosophy that supersedes and contra- dicts his juvenile beliefs. Truie, he swiftly outgrew his</page><page sequence="10">DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY VERSUS CHRISTIANITY 453 early materialism. Indeed, he was not altogether material- istic even when he wrote Queen Mab, as the following passage alone proves: Throughout this varied and eternal world Soul is the only element: the block That for uncounted ages has remained The moveless pillar of a mountain's weight Is active, living spirit. But on Necessity he never changed his attitude funda- mentally. This principle stood to the last in the back- ground of his mind, exercising a shaping and controlling influence over his thought. Naturally, in so poetic and siibtilizing a mind as Sh elley's, so unpoetic a principle as Necessity underwent many refining modifications. Never again did he render it so crudely and obtrusively as in Queen Mab, but wrought it suibtly and suggestively into the whole of his composition. Always ignoring some of the grim implications of the law of Necessity, the poet aetherialized it into a vast and indefinite spirit of ideas and being. The passage juist quoted from Queen Mab is noteworthy as indicating how early Shelley was inclined to ascribe a greater reality to the immaterial than to the material world; wherein, it has often been pointed out, he is like Plato. But, governed by the law of Necessity, the animat- ing Spirit of this supersensuous world is devoid of will and personality and as such is unethical, wherein Shelley is essentially unlike Plato. Shelley's world is unquestion- ably full of Platonic forms, but it is also unquestionably impregnated with Godwinian teachings. What seems true is that Shelley attempted to graft Platonic forms on the Godwinian doctrine of Necessity. Godwin was his real master.6 In an article, Platonism in Shelley, in Essays and Studies (vol. IV, 1913), L. Winstanley presents some striking similarities between</page><page sequence="11">454 S. F. GINGERICH In the prose treatise, A Refutation of Deism, written in 1814, Shelley's first important production after Queen Mab, there is scarcely any modification of the poiiit of view of the poem. In the essay Shelley repeats verbatim large portions of the notes to Queen 3Iab, which in turn had been quoted from The Necessity of Atheism. These per- sistent repetitions indicate how deeply ingrained such thoughts were in Shelley's mind. The essay is developed in the form of an argument between Eusebes, a Christian, and Theosophus, a Deist. The latter attacks Christianity as vehemently as Shelley in Queen Mab, and on precisely the same grounds. Espe- cially does he assert that belief, which is a passion, cannot be set up as a criterion of merit and demerit, as is done by Christianity. Eusebes replies, not with a defense of Christianity, but with a vigorous indictment of Deism, in order to force the Deist to accept either Christianity or the alternative, " a cold and dreary atheism." The Deist bases the argument for his belief in God on passages from Plato and from Shelley. However, many of the Shelley passages, some of which are quoted in the present essay, are in substance less like Plato than Godwin. It is also obvious that Shelley was especially enamoured by the more fantastic parts of Plato, as, for instance, the idea of pre-existence, a preceding Golden Age, alternate periods of order and disorder, etc. Miss Winstanley's oft-repeated statement, in its vaxjaus forms, "Shelley has emAbodied all these conceptions in his poetry," seems a little absurd. For Plato, " first among the preparatory preceptors of Christianity," lays special stress on intellectual discipline, travail, and growth necessary to attain the Beautiful and the Good, which is foreign to Shelley. Much of the mist hovering about Shelley's youthful ideas of the Good is dispelled, for example, by a single sentence from Plato's Republic: " Whether I am right or not God only knows; but, whether true or false, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all, and is seen only with an effort."</page><page sequence="12">DOCTRtINE OF NECESSITY VERSUS CIiISTIANITY 455 the principle of design in Nature. For the sake of the argument the Christian takes the point of view of a pro- fessed atheist, anld proceeds to destroy the theory of design. Design presupposes a designer, who may exercise either aln arbitrary or a creative will on the Universe, which the atheistical view cannot allow. These negations leave only a law of Necessity to govern all things. At the crux of the argument Eusebes says: From the fitness of the Universe to its end you infer the necessity of an intelligent Creator. But if the fitness of the Universe, to produce certain effects, be thus conspicuous and evident, how much more exquisite fitnes.s to his end must exist in the Author of this Universe? If we find great difficulty from its admirable arrange- ment, in conceiving that the Universe has existed from all eternity, and to resolve this difficulty suppose a Creator, how much more clearly must we perceive the necessity of this very Creator's creation whose perfections comprehend an arrangement far more accurate and just. The belief of an infinity of creative and created Gods, each more eminently Tequiring an intelligent author of his being than the foregoing, is the direct consequence of the premise which you have stated. The assumption that the Universe is a design, leads to a conclusion that there are infinity of creative and created Gods, which is absurd. After reducing the idea of design to an absuLrdity, Eusebes concludes that since the Deist considers that the chief characteristic of Deity is intelligence, which has been proved to be a mode of animal being, his God is nothing more than " a vast and wise animal." The essay closes with a remarkable promise on the part of the Deist: I am willing to promise that if, after mature delliberation, the argument which you have advanced in favor of Atheism should appeaT incontrovertible, I will endeavor to adopt so much of the Christian scheme as is consistent with imy persuasion of the good- ness, unity and majesty of God. This is remarkable as standing at the close of the last of Shelley's strictly controversial essays. He has, so to speak, 9</page><page sequence="13">456 s. F. GINGERICH come to the end of his argument; Deism has been weighed and found wanting. The arguments of Atheism seem incontrovertible, but the religion of Atheism is too arid, cold, and dreary for acceptance. Some kind of compro- mise must be made between its irrefutable reasonings and the Christian scheme. This compromise is attempted in the fragmentary Essay on Christianity, conjecturally written in 1815. This essay is noteworthy as being much more sympa- thetic toward Christianity than anything of Shelley's that precedes it. Here he attempts to show that Jesus' concep- tion of God was very similar to his own: " It is important to observe that the author of the Christian system had a conception widely differing from the gross imaginations of the vulgar relatively to the ruling Power of the universe. He everywhere represents this Power as something myste- riously and illimitably pervading the frame of things." And again: "He [Christ] considered the venerable word [God] to express the overruling Spirit of the collective energy of the moral and material world." Shelley grudg- ingly admits that Jesus attributed to this Power the faculty of Will, which is not to Shelley's liking. Yet he charitably conjectures that in so speaking of this Power Jesus " intentionally availed himself of a metaphor easily under- stood." The implication is that Jesus must have viewed God in a strictly necessitarian spirit. On the other hand, there is expressed in this essay a tendency toward dualism. Even in the passages in Queen Malb that deal with reform, where the poet needs must picture a world of struggle between good and evil, there is a tendency to slip away from that necessitarian view of the universe in which everything is connected and cemented in all its parts and nothing capable of happening otlherwise than it has happened. Likewise in this essay</page><page sequence="14">DOCTRINE O1' NECESSITY VERSUS CHRISTIANITY 457 he conceives that, "according to Jesus Christ and accord- ing to the indisputable facts in the case, some evil spirit has dominion in this iinperfect world. But there will come a time when the human mind shall be visited exclu- sively by the in-fluences of the Benignant Power." Jesus, Shelley conceives, was one who was constantly visited by this Power, and who by purity and goodness, by love and compassion, and by teaching and persuading, opposed the tyrants of this world and thereby forfeited his life. Ho-w- ever, this tendency to dualisn Shelley subordinates to the conception of that necessitarian power which is "the uniform and unchanging motive of the salutary operations of the material world." Though in Queen Mab Shelley considered Jesus the author of much eyil in the world, he yet there pays tribute to the purity of his life. But now he attests the truth and beauty of his teachings, not only as regards God but also as regards human life, and attempts to harmonize those teachings with his own views. "That those," he says, "who are pure in heart shall see God, and that virtue is its own reward [a Shelleyan doctrine] may be considered equivalent assertions." And the precepts: " Be ye perfect," and " refrain from revenge and retribution," are harmonized with Shelley's views of man's ultimate perfectibility. " We discover," Shelley also asserts, " that he [Christ] is the enemy of oppression and falsehood; that he is the advocate of equial justice; that he is neither disposed to sanctioni bloodshed nor deceit, under whatso- ever pretences tiheir practices may be vindicated. We discover that he was a inan of meek and majestic demeanor, calm in danger; of natural and simple thought and habits; beloved to adoration by his adhercnts; iunmoved, solemn and severe."</page><page sequence="15">458 S. F. GINGERICII But in this essay, as well as elsewhere, historic Chris- tianity fares ill at the hands of Shelley, for he considers it to have perverted the teachings of Jesus to superstition and tyranny. Rightly understood, these teachings, Shelley thinks, are a high!expression of the eternal laws of Nature and Necessity: The universal Being can only be described and defined by negatives which deny his subjection to the laws of all inferior existences. Where indefiniteness enids, idolatry and anthropomorphism begin. . . .The doctrine of what some fanatics have termed ",a peculiar providence "-that is, of some power beyond and superior to that which ordinarily guides the operations of the Universe, interfering to punish the vicious and reward the virtuous-is explicitly denied by Jesus Christ, -a rather astonishing necessitarian interpretation of the moral teachings of Christ. The poem Alastor, written also in 1815, strikes a similar note. This poem deals with destiny, but with no special providences. A passage from the Essay on Chris- tianity may serve as a key: "Human life, with all its unreal ills and transitory hopes, is as a dream, which departs before the dawn, leaving no trace of its evanescent hues. All that it contains of pure or of divine visits the passive mind in some serenest mood." The two dominant characteristics of the hero are that he is a lone dreamer and that he has the strictly receptive or passive mind, exercisling no choice as to his destiny. lIe is one who has been deeply impressed by the beauty and magnificence of the external world, has drunk " deep of the fountain of knowledge and is still insatiate," and has seen "the thrilling birth of time." Says Shelley in the preface: "So long as it is possible for his desires to point towards objects thus infinite and uniuneasiured, he is joyous, and tranquil, anid self-possessed." B1ut fate by means of a dreain presents to his mind the vision of perfect love in the form of a</page><page sequence="16">DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY VERSUS CHRISTIANITY 459 bealutiful maiden. This vision, though unbidden, is the deciding factor in his life. Having spurned the choicest though imperfect gift which human love offers, he is now and henceforth destined, either with or against his will, to seek for a prototype of his conception of perfection, the infinite in the finite, the eternal in the concrete. In pursuit of this unattainable ideal he roams over the face of the earth. His wanderings through strange lands remind one of the Ancient Mariner's journeyings over strange seas. Both are phantom characters, although the Mariner is much more intensely realized. Both are im- pelled by powers over which they have no control. But the hero of Shelley's poem, having no belief in special providence or in rewards and punishments, is utterly devoid of moral characteristics. Driven by the force of his own dreams of unattainable perfection, he wanders from place to place. " Blasted by his disappointment, he descends to an untimely grave " (preface). In the lofty introductory passages of the poem Shelley addresses the " Mother of this unfathomable world," which is no other than the " Spirit of Nature! all-sufficing Power, Necessity," of Queen Mab. But here that spirit of Nature, or Soul of the Universe, is more subtly and pervasively rendered. In the favorite figure of the lyre, wholly passive, the poet submits himself to the inspirations and workings of that inscrutable and necessitarian power: iSerenely now And moveless, as a long forgotten lyre Suspended in the solitary dome Of some mysterious and deserted fane, I wait thy breath, Great Pa.ent. This principle of Necessity, or Soul of the Universe, is rendered in terms of Beauty in the Hymn to Intellectual Beauty, written in 1816. Though Shelley's conception of</page><page sequence="17">460 s. v. GINGERICH Beauty in its purely intellectual aspect is certainly influ- enced by Plato's Beauty as Idea, yet Shelley conceives of Beauty as a Spirit that can hardly be distinguished from the Spirit of Nature of Queen Mab and Alastor and that works inscrutably on his passive mind: Thus let thy power, which like the truth Of nature on my passive youth Descended, to my onward life supply Its calm-to one who worships thee. The Spirit of Beauty is so supernal and ineffable that no man can see it and live; only its shadow visits this world and also each human heart and countenance, consecrating all it shines upon. And when in a memorable moment in the poet's life the shadow of that Spirit fell upon him he shrieked and clasped his hands in ecstasy, denounced again the poisonous names Christianity had taught him in his youth, and dedicated himself to that Vast Form of Awful Loveliness, which will in time, he thinks, free this world from its dark slavery. Some critics have found similarities between this poem and Wordsworth's Intimations of Immortality. But Wordsworth really worshipped at a different shrine. He raised his song of thanks and praise for those first-born affections in us, for the fact that the child is father of the man, for "the primal sympathy, which having been, must ever be,"-in brief, for the human heart by which we live, its tenderness, its joys and fears. He emphasized the individual worth of the soul on the basis of certain central and indestructible qualities which reside in it, and which are the real roots of man's spiritual freedom. In Shelley's Hymn, on the other hand, personality has but a phan- tasmal existence.7 'Compare the following from A Refutation of Deisrn: " Mind cannot create, it can only perceive. Mind is the recipient of impres-</page><page sequence="18">DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY VERSUS CHRISTIANITY 461 Likewise in the poem Mont Blanc, also written in 1816, Shelley muses on his " own separate phantasy," his pass- ive mind, as he calls lit, through which flows " the ever- lasting universe of things," and with what different results from those obtained by Wordsworth ! In Mont Blanc we are told that all things that move and breathe with toil and sound live and die, and pass away, and that the adverting mind is talught that Power dwells apart in its tranquillity Remote, serene, and inaccessible, governing, however, in its secret strength by a law of Necessity, thought, and life, and being. Thus Necessity is here rendered in terms of Power. It has already been noted that in Queen Mab and in the Essay on Christianity there was a modification of this view toward dualism. Since both the poem and the essay deal with reform and reformers, it is natural that such a ten- dency should appear. Likewise in The Revolt of Islam, written in 1817, which is even -more than Queen Mab a reform poem, though not so crude a one, the dualistic view is quite naturally emphasized: Know then that from the depth of ages old Two Powers o'er mortal things dominion hold, Ruling the world with a divided lot,- Immortal, all-pervading, manifold, Twin Genii, equal Gods-when life and thought Sprang forth, then burst the womb of inessential Nought. -Canto I, Stanza xxv. These powers are the Spirit of Evil and the Spirit of sions made on the organs of sense, and without the action of external objects we should not only be deprived of the existence of mind, but totally incapa)ble of the knowledge of anything. It is evident there- fore that mind deserves to be considered as the effect, rather than the cause of motion."</page><page sequence="19">4642 S. F. GINGERICH Good. The former is represented by the priests and the tyrants in the poem; the latter by the characters Laon and Cythna. But these two characters are merely passive, obe- dient only to the Spirit of Good. They love and suffer and forgive and endure, and seal their lives in martyrdom for the cause of good. The struggle is really not so much a struggle between Laon and the tyrants as between the Spirits of Good and of Evil, of which their human repre- sentatives are the mere instruments. Yet this dualism is only apparent, not real; for there is a power behind Good and Evil that is far greater than they. As Cythna says in a notable passage: One comes behind Who aye the future to the past will bind- Necessity, whose sightless 'strength forever Evil with evil, good with good, must wind In bands of union which no power may sever: They must bring, forth their kind, and be divided never! -Canto IX, Stanza xxvii. If there is any single conception that may be spoken of as truly fundamental or central in Shelley's religion, it is here expressed. The fine phrase " sightless strength " is especially to be noted. In the preface Shelley says that the poem is a succession of pictures illustrating "the awakening of an immense nation from their slavery and degradation to a true sense of moral dignity and freedom; the bloodless dethronement of their oppressors, and the unveiling of the religious frauds by which they have been deluded into submission." However, the attack on religious frauds is by no means as intense as in Queen Mab, and it is the last one on any extensive scale in Shelley's writings. He had still five years to live and his greatest works to produce, but he had already arrived at a settled conviction as to the moral greatness of the Founder of Christianity, even though he</page><page sequence="20">DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY VERSUS CHRISTIANITY 463 occasionally and to the last had his fling at Christian fol- lowers. In The Triumph of Life written just at the close of his career he speaks of Gregory and John, anid men divine, Who rose like shadows between man and God; Till that eclipse, still hanging over heaven, Was worshipped by the world o'er which they strode, For the true sun it quenched.8 He had also arrived at the conviction that it was futile to oppose Christianity by means of the doctrine of Neces- sity, and did not urge it further. Nevertheless, the idea of Necessity continued to domi- nate all of Shelley's later meditative poetry. The same dualism with the same overarching Necessity noted in The Revolt of Islam controls the action and the thought in Prometheus Unbound, begun in 1818 and completed in 1819. Interpreted from one angle, Prometheus personi- fies the Mind of Man, or Reason, and represents the Spirit of Good. From another angle he represents Revolutionary Liberty, which is also the Spirit of Good. Jupiter, the anthropomorphic God, created by Prometheus through er- ror, personifies authority and institutions, and represents the Evil Spirit. Though Prometheus and Jupiter are the chief antagonists and the reader is led to expect a conflict between them, no such conflict is presented in the poem. Nor is Jupiter directly dethroned by Prometheus;. the latter only loves and suffers and endures, and thereby puri- fies his own nature. He is the supreme example of the passive mind, awaiting calmly his hour, not for action but for his release. Demigorgon, who is Eternity, and Fate, Time, Occasion, Chance, and Change, vast, vague, and S)See also Prometheus Unbound, Act I, lines 546-563, and a note to the last Chorus in Hellas, in the passage beginning with,-" The sublime human character of Jesus Christ- " etc.</page><page sequence="21">464 S. F. GINGERICH imageless expressions for Necessity, bring about Jupiter's downfall and the redemption of Prometheus, which com- pletes the action of the poem.9 But it may be urged that in the poem the principle of Love at least is an active agency, independent of the law of Necessity, which rescues life from that fatalism toward which all of Shelley's writings tend.10 In one line in a famous passage the independence of Love is asserted: For what would it avail to bid thee gaze On the revolving world? What to bid speak Fate, Time, Occasion, Chance, and Change? To these All things are subject but eternal Love. However, in the notes to Queen Mab where love is repre- sented as most lawless, indisciplinable, " compatible nei- ther with obedience, jealousy, nor fear," it is declared in the same breath to be an involuntary affection, " inevitably consequent on the perception of loveliness," the lover being a slave to its mandates. And though in the preface to The Revolt of Islam Shelley states that "love is celebrated 8Prometheus Unbound is primarily lyrical, and as a lyric falls into two dilstinct parts, with two emotional centers. The division occurs between Scenes i and ii of Act III. The first part represents the Mind of Man (Prometheus) as bound and enslaved; the second as absolutely free. There are no intermediary emotional stages. In the second part the poet achieves an, extraordinarily intense and sustained lyricism. 10 That Shelley was aware of this tendency is shown in a note from the essay On the Punishment of Death, where he makes an unsuc- cessful attempt to distinguish between Necessity and Fatalism: " The isavage and the illiterate are but faintly aware of the dis- tinction between the future and the past; they make actions belong- ing to periods so distinct, the subjects of similar feelings; they live only in the present, or in the past, as it is present. It is in this that the philosopher excels one of the many; it is this which dis- tinguishes the doctrine of philosophical necessity from fatalism." But this makes no real or fundiamental distinction. It simply makes Necesisty a dignified Fatalism.</page><page sequence="22">DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY VERSUS CHRISTIANITY 465 everywhere as the sole law that should govern the moral world," it seems that in the poem itself he makes it a servant of Equality: Eldest of things, divine Equality! Wisdom and love are but the slaves of thee! And Equality is but another name for that inscrutable, illimitable and destiny-shaping Power, the mother of all things: O Spirit vast and deep as Night and Heaven! Mother and soul of all to which is given The light of life, the loveliness of being . . . . . . Now millions start To feel thy lightnings through them burning; Nature, or God, or Love, or Pleasure, Or Sympathy, the sad tears turning To mutual smiles, a drainless treasure, Descends amidst us. -Canto V, Stanza LI. Thus Love is a word almost interchangeable with Wis- dom, or Nature, or God, and though it has a human side, it is chiefly a cosmic force as impersonal and impalpable as Time, or Nature, or any other of Shelley's abstractions, which exist and work in a necessitarian spirit almost exclusively " beyond and above consciousness." Likewise Asia, who represents Love in Prometheus Un- bound, is the instrument of a similar impersonal and cosimic power that, in its destined moment, illumines Earth and heaven And the deep ocean and the sunless caves And all that dwell within them. Naturally Asia, as a character, is as actionless as either Prometheus or Jupiter. She passively awaits the hour of her reunion with Prometheus. The philosophy of Prometheus Unbound is thus essen- tially the same as that of The Revolt of Islam, except that</page><page sequence="23">466 S. F. GINGERICH the application of the principle of reform is much more general and correspondingly more indefinite. The indefi- nite and somewhat vague characters are the instruments respectively of Good and of Evil, while Necessity's " sight- less strength" is the determining factor in the conflict between them. The shaping hand of Necessity is clearly discernible in the last portion of Adonais, written in 1821. Here Neces- sity is transformed into a Light, a Beautv, a Benediction, a sustaining Love; it is Nature; it is the One that remains; it is Eternity; it is the "one Spirit's plastic stress " that Sweeps through the dull dense world, compelling there All new successions to the forms they wear. This compelling and self-executing Power, however imper- sonal and however vaguely described, makes our present finite life seem, by contrast, a mere dream, a phantasma- goria. To die and to be immortal is to be made one with this inscrutable, impalpable, and impersonal Force. In Hellas, written in 1821, Necessity, described in the poem as " the world's eyeless charioteer, Destiny," is ren- dered chiefly in terms of Mind, or Thought, which is typi- fied by the ideal Greece, or Hellas. Says Ahasuerus, the Jew, to Mahmud, the Sultan: Talk no more Of thee and me, the future and the past; But look on that which cannot change-the One, The unborn and the undying. ... This Whole Of suns, and world, and men, and beasts, and flowers, With all the silent or tempestuous workings Bv which they have been, are, or cease to be, Is but a vision. The individual is nothing, the One is all. Men are mere visions, " idle shadows of thought's eternal flight." Not the concrete thoughts of individuals, but Thought in the abstract is the reality. It has nought to do " with time,</page><page sequence="24">DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY VERSUS CHRISTIANITY 467 or place, or circumstance," but like an eyeless Destiny it controls all finite things. Even Mahmud recognizes that nothing can happen until its destined hour. When Hlassan speaks to him of the time Ahasuerus is to appear to Mahmud, the latter declares that the Jew will come When the omnipotent hour to which are yoked He, I, and all things shall compel-enough. And the spirit of this is caught up and given universal application in the great Chorus that immediately follows, beginning with- Worlds on worlds are rolling ever From creation to decay- The fragment The Triulmph of Life, the last of Shel- ley's compositiions, is iinteresting as showing that to the very end he tended more and more toward pure abstrac- tions. The poem is based upon a dream that visited the poet's passive mind-" a vision on my brain was rolled." In his dream he perceived a chariot in which sat a Shape, while around the chariot and following it were many liuman shapes. This pageantry represents Life. The charioteer was a Janus-visaged Shadow, and " all the four faces of that charioteer had their eyes banded." This Shadow, then, is " the eyeless charioteer, Destiny," the sightless Necessity of the other poems. The purport of the poem is to render Necessity in terms of Life,-an appropriate fragmentary conclusion to the brief life and the works of Shelley. It should also be remembered that throughout his career Shelley believed in the perfectibility of man, based on the more fundamelntal belief in the esselntial unreality of evil. Godwiin had said that "under the system of Necessity the idea of guilt, crime, desert, and accountableness have</page><page sequence="25">468 S. F. GINGERICII no place." Likewise in The Revolt of Islarm Shelley speaks of the mere "temporary triumph of oppression" and " the transitory nature of ignorance and error." And Mirs. Shelley, writing of her husband's philosophy, says: "The prominent feature of Shelley's theory of the destiny of the human species was that evil is not inherent in the system of creation, but an accident that might be expelled." Thus it requires but a small amount of self-exertion to get rid of an accident or a mere error and to attain to perfectibility. There is no purifying, developing, and enriching of the personality in the process. In fact, it can hardly be spoken of as a process, but rather as a mere instantaneous change. So that when in The Revolt of Islam Cythna asserts to the sailors that they might " arise and will " to change the world, she means that somehow there has been a slight aberration on the part of mankind from the law of Necessity and Nature and that the error might be instantaneously corrected. " The vulgar," said Godwin, "will universally be foutnd to be advocates of free-will. ... This having been the conception of the masses of mankind in all ages, and the idea 'of contingency and accident having perpetually ob- truded themselves, the established language of morality has been universally tinctured with this error." Shelley took pains not to be classed among the vulgar by his master. Yet the fact is that his language, as well as the language of Godwin himself, and indeed the language of any human being, so far as he is human, is tinctured with this so-called error. "It is a received iopinion in metaphysics," says Bagehot, " that the idea of personality is identical with the idea of will." And for any one who bas much to say to his fellow-men, it is manifestly impossible to prevent the idea of will from coloring his language. A number of</page><page sequence="26">DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY VERSUS CHRISTIANITY 469 examples can be found in Shelley's writings.1" No doubt as the poet approached maturity he began to recognize the actual feelings of actual persons around him and to per- ceive that their actions seemed in nowise to have been determined by a chain of causes generated in the eternity of time before their birth. For all that, however, the poet was remarkably true to the spirit of his master's teaching on the law of Necessity. In the fragmentary essay On Life, assigned by Rossetti to 1815, but conjecturally assigned by Dowden to 1819, Shelley says: " The words I, You, They, are not signs of any actual difference isubsisting between the assemblage of thoughts thus indicated, but are merely marks employed to note the different modifications of the one mind." These words, he also says, " are grammatical devices invented simply for arrangement, and totally devoid of the intense 11 Three of the most striking examples are as follows: From Julian and Maddalo (1818): We are asisured Much may be conquered, much may be endured Of what degrades and crushes us. We know That we have power over ourselves to do And suffer-what, we know not till we try, But something nobler than to live and die. From A Philosophical Review of Reform (1818): " We derive tranquillity and courage and grandeur of soul from contemplating an object which is because we will it, and may be, because we hope and desire it, and must be if succeeding generations of the enlight- ened sincerely and earnestly desire it." From Prometheus Unbound (1818). Prometheus to Jupiter: O'er all things but thyself I gave thee power, And my own will. These passages seem numerous around the year 1818. It may be that at this time Shelley wals groping his way toward a real sense of will and personality. But the philosophy of his youth was too strong for him to succeed.</page><page sequence="27">470 S. F. GINGERICH and exclusive sense usually attached to them." Totally devoid of individuality and will! Thus from the doctrine of Necessity as held by Shelley there arise two significant negations-the negation of will or personality and the negation of evil. The holding of these views interfered seriously with the poet'is construct- ive thinking. The tenuity complained of by many readers of Shelley's poetry, " the incurable want, in general, of a sound subject matter," as Matthew Arnold phrased it, is not due primarily to the fact that Shelley considered the supersensuous world more real than the sensuous world, as so many Shelley advocates declare, but rather to the fact of his denial of the reality of evil and of will and personality. His attitude toward evil tends to turn some of his seri- ous work into mockery. A poet who goes forth to do battle with evil must at least consider the foe a reality, a force to be grappled with, an adversary worthy his best steel. But in Shelley's duLalistic poems we are ioften reminded that the Good is opposed by a mere phantom, and that wve have been invited to witness a combat with shadows. The other negation is more vital; it robs Shelley's poetry greatly of the power of personality and of moral profund- ity; it precludes any seriotus volitional appeal. I could lie down like a tired child, And weep away the life of care- Oh lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud! I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed! is the prevailinlg tone of his finest lyrics. It is not merely that the poet feels no sense of deep personal unworthiness or of profound sinfulness within him, but chiefly that his own separate phanitasy seems to have such a slight hold on things. The wild lyricism and the extraordinary poig-</page><page sequence="28">DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY VERSUS CHRISTIANITY 471 nancy of his verse have their source in the poet's sense of his own helpless, fleeting, shadow-like being, and in his sense that the will of man is impotent and has nowhere to turn for strength, for assurance, and for a satisfying and an abiding peace. From these negations the poet had only two ways of escape. The first was to a dream world of clouds and sunsets, to The loftiest star of unaseended heaven, Pinnacled dim in the intense inane, or to a sinless Eden, Around mountains and islands inviolatbly Prankt on the sapphire sea,- Hence that " thin idealism " so characteristic of Shelley's poetry. But if we recognize the limitations put upon him by his own negations, we may assert that he made the utmost of his ideal world, investing it with an inscrutable Power, imageless and unspeakable, yet necessary and self- executing and compelling in all its aspects, a Power that forever dwells apart, toward which the poet's being for- ever pants and aspires. In this view man is conceived but as a waterspout in the eternal storms of Being. The other way of escape was toward the simple, passive, non-resistant life, so like certain aspects of Christianity. " I agree," says Shelley, " with the Quakers so far as they disclaim violence, and trust their course wholly and solely to its own truth." So he sang of those passive qualities which have an abiding interest and an unfailing esthetic charm-love which is truth, gentleness which is brave, endurance which wins by silent resistance, fortitude which does not anger at provocation, forgiveness which takes no account of revenge, yearnings for the infinite which cannot 10</page><page sequence="29">472 S. F. GINGERICH be satisfied, and most of all, sorrow and melancholy which ltuxuriate in their own helplessness. " I shall say what I think," says Browning. "Had Shelley lived he wotuld finally have ranged himself with the Christians." But what Shelley might have beoome is not so important as what he actually was. Whether he, or any other man, was a Christian depends almost wholly on our definition of Christianity. Perhaps no one would be so bold as to declare what the teachings of Jesus were in their entirety. At least it is not a fit subject upon which to dogmatize. On the other hand, an original poet asserts with assurante only what he sees and feels to be true in his own inner experience. Such experience being inevitably circumscribed in a finite creature, it seems that a poet can at best express only a limited nunmber of great convictions, which may or may not be fundamentally simi- lar to the essential teachings iof Jesus. It is in this sense only that Browning hinmself may be considered a Chris- tian; for there are important aspects of Christianity which he barely touched, because they were not vital to his exper- ience. Now Shelley undoubtedly expressed some convic- tions that are fundamentally similar to the teachings of Jesus, but because they are not so numerouis nor so broad- based nor so heartily sympathetic with Christianity as those of Browning, men have usually accorded to Browning the name of Christian, but have persistently withheld it from Shelley. This is undoubtedly a fair distinction, when it is understood as indicating a difference in degree and not in kind. Thiis distinction is further strengthened when it is remembered that Shelley constantly refused to distin- guish the good from the evil in historic Christianity and as a consequence failed to credit the good in it. Nevertheless, in his later years Shelley not only more than once spoke and wrote of the sublime personality of</page><page sequence="30">DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY VERSUS CHRISTIANITY 473 Jesus, but in IIellas (1821) he wrote some lines concern- ing God which might even have been acceptable to ortho- dox Christians of Shelley's day: In the great morning of the world The spirit of God with might unfurled The flag of Freedom over Chaos. And in a passage (quoted approvingly by Browning) in The Boat of the Serchio (1821) Shelley seems to have identified his own vievw of Necessity with strict religious predestination: All rose to do the task He set to each, Who shaped us to his ends and not our own.
