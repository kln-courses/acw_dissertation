ABSTRACT: A series of rigid wall tests have been conducted at three impact velocities to quantify the dynamic response of the Side Impact Dummy (SID) developed by US DOT. This paper reports the chest, pelvis and head responses of the dummy at various filter frequencies and describes the development and verification of the three-dimensional mathematical model of the Side Impact Dummy utilizing the rigid wall test results. The mathematical model uses the mass distribution and the linkage system of the current Part 572, Hybrid II dummy which forms the basic platform of the SID. The unique chest of the dummy is modeled by two systems of linkages simulating the rib cage and the jacket. Also included in the model is the internal hardware of the chest, e.g. a damper, rib stopper and a clavicle simulator at the upper spine. The material and linkage models are based on static and dynamic tests of the dummy components. Model verifica- tion were carried out at component levels by comparing model and dummy certification test results. The final validation of the whole dummy model was conducted by simulating rigid wall and APR padding tests and compar- ing with test results. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to describe the development and experimental validation of a mathematical model of the DOT-SID dummy. The methodology utilized in developing the model is suited to modeling the EURO- SID-I and the BIOSID dummies when sufficient modeling information becomes available. INTRODUCTION: The Department of Transportation (DOT) is proposing new regulations to help improve vehicle performance in side impacts. Effective mathematical models of the side impact dummy and car structure are needed as analytical tools to help the vehicle designer understand the complex mechanisms of side impacts. Under the proposed regulations the DOT Side Impact Dummy (DOT-SID) is proposed as the standard or alter- nate test device. This dummy has been developed over a number of years and is basically a Part-572 (Hybrid II) anthropomorphic dummy with extensive modification of the ribcage. FIR- filtered rib and spine acceleration measurements during the tests are used to compute the Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI) [1], an acceleration-based criterion that relates to side impact severity. Two other side impact dummies exist which may also be used in developing improved vehicles - the EUROSID-I and BIOSID [2,3]. The EUROSID-I was developed in Eu- rope to measure individual rib acceleration and deflection. It also has an abdomen which measures penetration force, and a modified pelvis. An even more biofidelic dummy, the BIOSID, is currently being developed by GM in close cooperation with an SAE Side Impact Dummy Task Force. This dummy is described in reference [3]. MODEL REQUIREMENTS: The requirements we imposed on a mathematical model to simulate the DOT-SID dummy were the following: 1. Predict upper and lower rib accelerations as well as rib deflections relative to the spine. 2. Predict thoracic spine accelerations at T-l and T-12 levels on the spine. 3. Predict pelvic accelerations. 4. Predict loads on the pelvis through the acetabulum and the ilium. 5. Predict overall head/neck and whole body kinematics. Some of the above requirements can be fulfilled by one- or two-dimensional models. For whole body and head kinematics, however, three-dimensional models are re- quired. Additionally, for the one- and two-dimensional 1845</page><page sequence="2">dummy models, the three-dimensional dummy mass has to be reduced in order to attain proper mass distribution. In general, this is handled by assuming effective masses and effective spring constants. However, our experience with one- and two- dimensional models for lateral impacts show that the effective masses utilized in those models vary with different impacts, e.g. in padded versus rigid surface impacts, and in flat surfaces vs surfaces with pelvic lead or lag. To predict rib accelerations an effective rib mass must be incorporated in the model. This mass is connected to the spine mass by springs and/or dampers. A three-dimen- sional model of the SID using this concept was reported in reference [4]. Again, in the above modeling, an effec- tive rib mass was used. A study of the DOT-SID ribcage construction shows that the ribcage rotates around the SI axis of the thoracic spine. This rotation is resisted by a non-linear damper connecting the ribcage to the spine. Under these conditions it is difficult to predict the effec- tive rib mass for all possible impact situations. To overcome some of the shortcomings of the previously referenced one-dimensional and three-dimensional models, it was decided to model the SID dummy in three dimen- sions and model the ribcage in sufficient detail to de- scribe the actual hardware used in the dummy. With this modeling approach, the actual mass distribution of the dummy components could be used. The following sections describe the modeling details. The model was developed using the MADYM03D version 4.2 software [5]. DESCRIPTION OF THE DUMMY MODEL: To describe the dynamic behavior of the DOT-SID under various impact conditions, a mathematical model consist- ing of three separate systems was generated. System 1: The first system characterizes the main body of the dum- my and consists of three branches. The principal branch consists of 5 rigid segments representing the pelvis, lum- bar spine, upper torso, neck and head. Flexion-and- torsion joints couple the segments. The origin of the principal branch is located at the Hip Pivot Point, the effective joint center between the pelvis and the femur. Two sub-branches define the right and left sides of the lower body, consisting each of a femur, tibia and foot. Since the rotation axis of the components are well de- fined, Cardan Joints are used to connect the different components within the sub-systems. To sense contacts, ellipsoids are assigned to the various segments with dimensions analogous to the actual compo- nents. These ellipsoids define the general profile of the dummy, including the head, neck, shoulder, lumbar spine, torso, ilium, acetabulum, etc. The stiffness of these con- tact ellipsoids were obtained from static tests of dummy segments. System 2: The ribcage is modeled by a system of nine links approxi- mating the geometry and mass distribution of the dummy ribcage. These links are connected to one another by flexion and torsion joints, and are connected to the tho- racic spine by stiff springs and dampers (point-restraint option in MADYMO). The ribs are also connected to the thoracic spine by a non-linear damper to simulate the hydraulic damper hardware used in the dummy. To pre- vent excessive rotation of the ribcage relative to the tho- racic spine, a rubber stopper is designed into the dummy. This stopper is represented by a plane in the model. This approach is an extension of that used by Wismans [6] in two-dimensional modeling of the SID thorax. System 3: The dummy jacket is also modeled as a linkage consisting of five equal masses coupled by a series of flexion and torsion joints. Ellipsoids are attached to the individual segments with material stiffness obtained from static crush tests. The jacket is attached to the ribcage by non-linear springs and dampers. Figure 1 portrays the general profile of the mathematical model of the DOT-SID. Figure 1. DOT-SID model : Exploded view. DUMMY PROPERTIES: The mass, moment of inertia and joint torque characteris- tics used in the model are from reference [7] for all dummy components except the ribcage and thoracic spine, which were developed in-house. The dummy ribcage, jacket and thoracic spine were weighed. The 13 kg rib- cage mass was distributed equally on the nine links of the ribcage. Figure 2 show the layout of the actual ribcage versus the model segments. 1846</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. Actual ribcage layout versus model segments. The joints stiffness used to couple the various rib seg- ments are extracted from the MADYMO "EUROSID" data set developed by TNO [5] and tabulated in table 1, even though the SID and EUROSID ribcages are consid- erably different. Sensitivity analysis over the range of joint torque has been performed and little change in the model rib response was observed. Therefore, using the EUROSID data is justifiable. Table 1: Rib and Jacket Joint Stiffness Angular Displacement Torque (rad) (N-m) 0.0 0.0 1.0 54.5 The Point Restraints option in MADYMO was used to couple the modeled ribcage to the thoracic spine. The spring and damper stiffness for this coupling are very high, allowing only rotation motion about the spine, but no relative displacement. The 5 kg jacket mass was distributed equally on the five links representing the jacket. The joint torque used in the jacket linkage is similar to that of the ribcage. Only rotation about the vertical axis is allowed; there is high resistance to flexing. A sensitivity analysis on the jacket joint torque was conducted in a manner similar to the analysis of the ribcage. Reasonable variations had no significant impact on jacket kinematics. The jacket is connected to the ribcage using the Point Restraint option in MADYMO. The contact stiffness of the jacket and ribcage was determined experimentally from a quasi-static crusher test. Its force-deflection plot is shown in figure 3. 1800.0-1 ; ; 1200.0- / Z I 8 «0-Ū J 100.0- j i ] / 0.0 ļ ļ i 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.01 0.05 0.08 0 07 Daflaction (m) Figure 3.

The test utilizes a 4.73 kg pendulum mass impacting the damper at 3.0, 4.3 and 6.0 m/s (7, 10 and 13 mph, respectively). The damper force-time history was measured and the damper coefficients were extracted for the three test severities. These properties are tabu- lated in table 2. The data show the damper to be a "velocity square" type.

The FIR (Finite Im- pulse Response) filtered acceleration-time trace at both the lower spine and upper rib were monitored in the simulations. Figure 7 illustrates the correlation of the thorax performance test data with the model responses, showing that the chest model is adequate for predicting pendulum impacts. Figure 6.

Series of Rigid wall sled tests with certified DOT-SID dummies were con- ducted at 4.5, 6.7 and 8.9 m/s (10, 15 and 20 mph, respec- tively). A minimum of four tests were conducted at each speed to determine the variability of the dummy re- sponses. High speed movies were used to monitor the dummy kinematics. Accelerations were measured at the Head C.G., T-l, T-12, pelvis, lower and upper ribs on the impact side for each run. The sled fixture was then modeled with series of rigid planes, portraying the rigid wall and seat bottom. The "calibrated" DOT-SID model was "seated" on the "seat bottom" and simulations of the rigid wall tests were con- ducted at the same three severity levels. The model of the rigid wall sled test setup is shown in figure 8. The FIR-filtered acceleration traces of the simulations and the response corridors from the tests at each severity level are shown in figures 9, 10 and 11. 1848</page><page sequence="5">Figure 8.

In the model, the entire unloading force-deflection characteristics were not simulated for all contact func- tions. A simple straight line hysteresis model was used. As a result, in some model response curves are not in the measured dummy response corridors. This effect was most pronounced in the 4.5 m/s tests (see figures 9b and 9c). The model exercises show that the FIR-filtered accelera- tion responses of the pelvis were very sensitive to hystere- sis slopes. When the data are not FIR-filtered, the sensi- tivity is reduced (figures 12 and 13). 80.0 -i ; ; ; A L«g*nd i I LOW HYSTERESIS « / i' HIGH HYSTERESIS • i M čo I ! ' § 40.0- f j Vi !

Sled Test Series with APR Padding: Daniel et al. [10] have reported SID dummy tests with APR padding blocks covering pelvic and chest impact zones at 6.3 and 8.9 m/s (14 and 20mph, respectively). Their tests were simulated using the validated dummy model. The force deflection properties used for the APR padding was reported in ISCYTC22/SC12/WG5-N249 and is shown in figure 14. The model responses and tests comparison are shown in figures 15 and 16. It can be seen from the figures that the model correlates very well with the tests till unloading occurs. At 14 mph, hysteresis of the pad plays an important role in the unloading phase and the dynamic hysteresis of the pad is unknown. However, at 20mph since the model and test responses correlate very well for the entire impact duration, it appears that the hysteresis is not very important at this speed. i FOUCE APPLIED IT FLAT PLATE //I : «á j- I i FOUCE COTEM APPLIED *6 IT TOTAL FLAT SURFACE PLATE J] y' / //1| Il //I I COTEM *6 TOTAL SURFACE //1| j- y' / Il 400 144 1/1 // • ^ // o 300 - - ł Ī 100 -ļļ o 10 20 30 40SOM7080 COMPtESSION • m Figure 14.

CONCLUSIONS: The results of the rigid wall sled tests and various model responses have been presented. Figure 17 summarizes the responses for the rigid wall sled test and modeling outputs at the three impact severities. As seen from these plots the modeling simulations matched the test data very well, including the TTI values. The model also shows that FIR-filtered responses are sensitive to change in the contact stiffness unloading slope. Since the DOT-SID model was developed with laboratory component calibration pendulum and full dummy rigid wall sled tests, the dummy model properties such as segment masses and contact ellipsoid stiffness need not change with different impact conditions. 1853</page><page sequence="10">The developed methodology can be transferred to other side impact dummies such as the BIOSID and EUROSID I and can help the vehicle designer to better understand- ing the mechanism of side impact. 175. 0-j ; - 150.0 ^ so 0 .
