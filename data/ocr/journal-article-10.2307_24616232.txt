<plain_text><page sequence="1">Peter the Venerable, Against the Inveterate Obduracy of the Jews. Translated by Irven M. Resnick. Washington, DC: The Ca tholic University of America Press, 2013, 302 pp. For more than two decades, Irven Resnick has been an industrious translator of medieval Latin texts, from the letters of Peter Damian to theological treatises of Odo of Tournai to Peter Alfonsi's polemic against the Jews. In the book under review, Resnick has done a great service to medievalists by rendering into English for the first time Peter the Ven erable's Against the Inveterate Obstinancy of the Jews (Adversus Iudeorum inveteratam duritiem). Composed in several stages be tween 1143 and 1147 on the eve of the failed Second Crusade, the abbot of Cluny's polemic against the Jews differs in important respects from the centuries-old adversus Iudaeos tra dition. In the first four of the five books that comprise this treatise, Peter does not stray far from patristic and early medieval precedents by arguing on the basis of scriptural author ity that (a) Jesus Christ was the messiah</page><page sequence="2">Mediaevistik 27 ■ 2014 389 foretold by the Hebrew prophets and the Son of God; (b) Jesus Christ is God himself; (c) Jesus Christ is the eternal king of Heaven and not a king in the earthly sense like David or Solomon; and (d) the Messiah, that is, Jesus Christ, has already come for the salvation of the world. It is the last book of Peter's treatise that marks a radical departure from received tradition. Book Five argues that the Jews have been led astray from the Hebrew Scriptures by the ridiculous and blasphemous stories of the Torah, examples of which Peter cites at length in his text. The abbot of Cluny was the first Latin Christian author to make refer ence to the Talmud in a polemic work against the Jews. How he acquired knowledge of it remains unknown. He may have learned the stories from a Jewish convert to Christianity or he may have had in hand an early Latin translation, now lost. Whatever the case, Pe ter makes the Talmud the core of his argu ment in Book Five. The abbot of Cluny was particularly appalled by stories that depicted God in anthropomorphic terms interacting with Hebrew scholars in Heaven, a view he shared with some Jewish intellectuals of this period. According to Peter, the Talmud was nothing less than a monstrous beast that lulled its readers into a bestial stupidity and voided all reason. Resnick prefaces his translation with a generous introduction that discusses Pe ter the Venerable's other polemical works: Against the Petrobrusians (Tractatus contra Petrobrusianos haereticos) and Against the Saracens (Contra sectam siue haeresim Sara cenorum). He also considers the tradition of anti-Jewish polemics from which Peter de rived inspiration and from which he ultimate ly diverged. Lastly, he examines some of pos sible reasons for the abbot's vitreolic attack against the Jews. Money seems to be a key issue on Peter's mind. Although there is no evidence to suggest that Cluny was in debt to Jewish lenders in the 1140s, Peter was clearly outraged that Christians were burdened by Jewish usury and sometimes even stole holy objects from churches to pawn with Jewish lenders for cash. In his famous Letter 130, the abbot of Cluny went so far as to suggest that the king of France fund the Second Crusade by taking money directly from the Jews. This is a sound and reliable translation that will be very useful in courses on the history of Jewish and Christian relations in the Middle Ages. The introduction is instructional, but I was surprised not to find Gilbert Dahan's Les intellectuels chrétiens et les Juifs au Moy en Age (1990) in the bibliography. Absent as well are George Duby's ground-breaking ar ticles on the finances of the great Burgundian abbey in the early twelfth century. Although Duby's studies were written in the 1950s, all subsequent discussions on the topic of Cluny and money derive from his insights. With re spect to the translation, my only objection is to the title, which in my opinion cleaves too closely to the Latin and gives the work a ve neer of pretention. But this personal quibble does not detract from Resnick's achievement. His translation makes a provocative and in novative work of anti-Jewish polemic written by an important twelfth-century abbot avail able to a much wider reading public, includ ing our students, and for that we owe him our gratitude.
