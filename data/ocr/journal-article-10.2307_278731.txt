These excavations were financed through grants from the National Science Foundation. Wayne F. Shields excavated the Bear River No. 3 site in northern Utah. Two previous excavations by C. Melvin Aikens (1964 and 1966) in this immediate area revealed considerable information about the northern Fremont, or Fremont variant. The objective at Bear River No. 3 was to excavate extensively a site comparable to Bear River No. 1 and No. 2 to determine if the occupation patterns and economic means were as specialized and limited as implied by the excavations of Bear River No. 1 and No. 2. At Bear River No. 3 quantities of bird and bison bones were recovered in addition to deer, elk, and rodent remains. Fish, mollusk, egg shell, charred corn and Scirpus paleidosus (alkali bulrush) seeds also were recov- ered. Much pottery, stone, and bone represented the tool 409</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY inventory. Post holes and storage-refuse pits numbered in excess of 500. A total of six pit houses and one surface structure were revealed. Four of the pit houses were shallow in depth, 6 to 8 in., and each had a tunneled passageway. One of these shallow structures contained a clay-rimmed firepit with an unusual series of small holes punched into the top of the rim at intervals of 3 or 4 in. The remaining fire areas were centrally placed, unlined, rimless basins. Two of the subterranean structures were small (8 to 9 ft. in diameter and 12 to 18 in. deep) and lacked the tunneled passageways and firepits. Bear River No. 1 and No. 2 sites suggested seasonal occupations by a people with hunting economy, or pos- sibly hunting horticulturalists from elsewhere camping for a short period to exploit seasonal game riches. The evidence of corn (kernels, cobs, and glumes), along with the permanence implied by pit house structures found at Bear River No. 3, alters the above interpretation of the northern Fremont based on Bear River No. 1 and No. 2 excavations. The results of the laboratory analyses of pollen, radiocarbon samples, corn, and artifacts will determine more clearly the cultural relationships of the northern Fremont and the peoples of adjacent areas. Excavations were conducted at Pharo Village by John P. Marwitt during the period June 13 to August 23, 1967. The site, located about 12 mi. northwest of Salina, Utah, is in most respects a typical village of the Sevier-Fremont culture. Three pit dwellings and six coiled adobe surface stor- age structures were located. All are closely spaced and related to a single, continuous but apparently rather lengthy occupation. Coiled adobe storage structures exhibit marked variation in design and size, ranging from a large three-unit structure to a small single-unit type. The three pit dwellings are basically similar, differing primarily in size. All three have tunnel crawlway en- trances, and one has plastered pit sides. Other site features include two outdoor "use areas" with firepits, several large borrow pits, numerous trash pits, two complete human skeletons from midden areas, and an incomplete skeleton of Canis sp. The artifact material is rich, quite varied, and typically Sevier-Fre- mont, except for an unusually large amount of trade pottery. Abandonment of the village appears to have been caused by periodic flooding, which began sometime after the inception of occupation and continued into the pres- ent century at irregular intervals. C. Melvin Aikens excavated Hogup Cave, located near the western shore of the Great Salt Lake. Excavation was from June 19 through August 23 by a crew of six to eight men. Approximately 500 sq. ft. of area was excavated to bedrock, 10 to 14 ft. below surface. Sixteen discrete cul- tural layers were recognized. Excavation proceeded by the peeling of natural strata, with horizontal control main- tained by means of a grid system of 5-ft. squares. The deposits were dry, and preservation was excellent throughout, except in the bottommost stratum, where ground water seeping along the bedrock floor of the cave had caused decomposition of most perishable materials. Since no analysis has yet been done, only a few tentative statements may be made about the cultural contents of the cave. (1) The deposits contain Shoshoni, Promontory, and Fremont materials in firm context, thus tightening our control of the relative time relationships between these groups. (2) Beneath the strata containing these materials are 7 to 10 ft. of deposit which will pro- vide data on the Desert Archaic continuum. The projec- tile points from these strata fit well into the Danger Cave series, and the correspondence of types between Hogup and Danger suggests that Hogup may be fully as old as Danger (approximately 8000 B.C.). (3) A large series of radiocarbon samples were collected, of which 10 (two samples from each of five successive strata from bottom to top) have already been submitted for dating. (4) The deposits throughout are rich in botanical and faunistic remains, and human feces. Large samples of all these materials were collected. Their analysis should contribute substantially to understanding of ecological conditions and dietary habits affecting the occupants of the cave. (5) An apparently ancient spring near the site has yielded, in a preliminary coring, a column of peat deposit ca. 11 ft. deep. It is hoped that ecological information derived from the bog record from pollen and macrofossils can be correlated with cultural events in the cave. COLORADO. Archaeological field work undertaken dur- ing the 1967 season by the University of Colorado at the Mesa Verde Research Center brought the completion of the extensive testing on the reservoir in Morfield Canyon and the excavation of a Pueblo I Great Kiva with several adjacent pit houses and slab houses in the same locality. The reservoir and its intake ditch were cut by a series of trenches. Deposits exposed by the trenches were examined and profiled, soil and pottery samples were collected, and potsherds were collected. Harold Malde (U.S. Geological Survey) studied the canyon floor and drainage system and evaluated the reservoir deposits, aiding the interpretation of the development of the water catchment system. Potsherds from the reservoir indicate it to be of Pueblo II age. Most of the floor of the Pueblo I Great Kiva was exposed by two parallel 12-ft.wide trenches and addi- tional smaller trenches. Three of the four post holes, the firebox, and sipapu were exposed. The slab-lined bench and unlined kiva walls were uncovered. Several rooms in the Pueblo I village and some superimposed pit houses near the kiva also were excavated. The archaeological inventory of Bureau of Land Man- agement lands west of the Mesa Verde recorded 415 sites during the 1967 season; this brings the total of surveyed sites in that area to 968. Stabilization of Lowry Ruin has been completed, and Lowry Ruin was dedi- cated as a national historic landmark on October 17, 1967. Current research by Otero College includes continued survey and test excavation in sites adjacent to the Arkan- sas River and its southern tributaries in southeastern Colorado. The range of material in this area extends from Early Man up to and including historic Indian remains. Information is available on the seminomadic occupations 410 [ VOL. 33, No. 3, 1968</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH that occupied the more favorable environmental zones of this high plains terrain. A study is now underway to determine what environmental and social factors may have been operating to bring about the various changes or existing differences in settlement patterns observed in the distribution and occupation of living quarters. Some evidence is suggestive of clan or extended family occupa- tion zones within village sites. A separate but related research project is that of a petroglyph survey, principally south of the Arkansas River. Some petroglyph concentrations are now recognized as being related to the above-mentioned prehistoric gatherer- hunter-incipient horticultural occupation. Other concen- trations seem to have no direct contact with living occu- pations and may be the result of particular functions of several occupations, with the earlier drawings stimulating later uses, drawings, and functions. The petroglyphs include anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, geometric, and curvilinear designs. Some evidence indicates these can be broken down into categories of function, meaning, associations, and technique of production, and these cate- gories can be placed into horizon styles. Two distinct periods seem to be represented: that of the A.D. 1200- 1400, and that of the historic period, perhaps beginning in this area about A.D. 1500-1700. Some evidence of Navajo or Apache can be noted in the later petroglyphs. Eventually it may be possible to identify historic tribal motifs on the basis of design style, weathering conditions, and technique of production. Efforts also are being made to locate Pleistocene animal remains in an attempt to identify Early Man uses of this area. Horse, giant camel, and mammoth appear to have been common (available) megafauna. Evidence of man is present in the unassociated collections of early spear points. No definite age materials have been recovered. Recent bone collections from sand and gravel deposits are now under study. Intrusive burials of a later period are noted in the upper sand deposits. Adjacent grinding materials and associated campsite suggest an Archaic occupation. Students at Otero also are involved in laboratory analyses and preparation of excavated materials from sites along the Arkansas River and the adjacent Purgatory and Apishapa river drainages. These materials were recovered during the 1967 Otero College Summer Field School. A report is also being prepared on an excavated site near the New Mexico border. This site is a hunting-and- gathering village which is believed to contain information dealing with a southern Plains-Upper Republican influ- ence into the central Plains and Pueblo periphery. Laboratory analyses and manuscript preparation are underway on sites excavated along the Upper Purgatory River, under a contract with the National Park Service Salvage Archaeology Program and Trinidad College. Attempts have been made to identify various species of rodents and their importance in the subsistence patterns of prehistoric man. Analyses of a small sample of grind- ing stones from that area opened new questions on their use and function. The State Historical Society in cooperation with Otero College continued excavations at the site of Fort Vasquez for the second summer season. Over six weeks were spent at the site, and about 50 per cent of the remaining site evidence has been uncovered. Two separate reports have been prepared, one on each season, and these are now on file at the State Historical Society Museum in Denver. Three or more periods of occupation are indi- cated in the stratigraphy of the site. Use of the fort by farmers in the area is documented by archaeological recovery and by the available literature. The fort became a refuge for settlers in the area when Indian attack threatened in the late 1850's, 1860's, and 1870's. Exten- sive manure layers suggest that a large corral was used on the west side of the stockade in the past fur trading period. Nearly all of the wall foundations are present and definable; so are the fireplaces and major gateway into the stockade. Part of the east wall has been destroyed as a result of highway construction in past years. However, key parts remain, and interpretation and accurate recon- struction of the fort proper are believed possible. Beads, pipe fragments, gun flints, and metal artifacts remain the most instructive materials of the fur trading period. Evidence of change and separate occupations may also be discernible on the basis of ceramics now under study at the Research Laboratory. A second report has been completed in a project under joint sponsorship between Otero College, The State Historical Society of Colorado, and the Colorado Power Company. This project was the search for and excavations at the site of Fort St. Vrain located about 6 mi. north of Fort Vasquez on the South Platte River. The precise location of the fort is believed to have been found, and its location coincides with the site marked by the Daugh- ters of the American Revolution in 1911. Little remains of the fort due to extensive grading over the site in recent years. A report on the excavations is en file with the State Historical Society of Colorado in Denver. The final analyses and report on the excavations at Fort Massachusetts have recently been completed and a manuscript prepared for publication in the forthcoming issue of the Colorado Magazine. Three seasons of excava. tions occurred at this site (located in the San Luis Valley of southern Colorado) which allowed partial recovery of some of the major features of the site. ARIZONA. Northern Arizona. The Prescott College Archaeological Survey initiated reconnaissance on Black Mesa in the Navajo and Hopi Indian reservations in July, 1967, under contract to the Peabody Coal Company of St. Louis. Several hundred acres of proposed strip mining and construction site areas, 12 mi. of truck road, and 100 mi. of slurry line right-of-way were surveyed by helicopter in two and one-half days. Five small Pueblo III Kayenta Anasazi sites, one Pueblo I site, and four historic Navajo sites were selected for excavation. The work will be directed by George J. Gumerman (Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Prescott College) in the summer of 1968. The ongoing survey of the Prescott region has con- tinued with efforts concentrated in Peeples Valley approxi- 411</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY mately 20 mi. south of Prescott. There, four probable Hohokam sites, including at least two ball courts, have been recorded. "Prescott Branch" sites have been sur- veyed in the Walnut Creek drainage and near Del Rio north of Prescott. In December, 1966, the Museum of Northern Arizona completed a survey of the route of the Arizona Public Service Company's 500 kilo-volt transmission line which crosses northern Arizona between a point a few miles south of Willow Beach on the Colorado River and Ship- rock, New Mexico. The survey recorded 91 sites repre- senting the Chaco and Kayenta branches of the Anasazi, the Cerbat and Cohonina branches of the Patayan, and a group of Archaic sites which have not as yet been asso- ciated with any of the primary southwestern traditions. Completion of the survey was followed with the excava- tion of nine sites. All of the sites excavated are west of the Little Colorado River and are affiliated with either the Cohonina or Archaic occupation of the Little Colo- rado River Valley and the Coconino Plateau to the west. A single site, Harbison Cave (NA9528), gave evidence of a multicomponent occupation which ranges from late Amargosa II to the Recent without a perceptible period of abandonment. The excavations and survey were car- ried out under the supervision of Calvin H. Jennings. A survey was made of House Rock Valley, the south- western quarter of the Paria Plateau, and the Paria Canyon in cooperation with the Bureau of Land Man- agement. The survey located a total of 117 sites, most of which are of Virgin branch affinity and date from the Pueblo II-III period. The Museum's participation in the Arizona Highway Salvage Program continued in 1967 with the excavation of eight sites within the right-of-way of Interstate 40 east of Flagstaff. The sites included Sinagua sites and a recent Navajo hogan. The excavations were supervised by Wil- liam Barrera and Albert Ward. Two Medicine Valley phase sites were excavated under the highway salvage program in a proposed material pit in Medicine Valley northeast of Flagstaff. The work was supervised by C. H. Jennings. Working in cooperation with the Bureau of Indian Affairs Roads Branch, 14 sites were excavated on Navajo Route 22, a new highway which will connect Page with Navajo Route 1 in the Klethla Valley west of Kayenta. Eight of the sites were investigated under the supervision of C. H. Jennings, while the remainder were the respon- sibility of Keith Anderson, temporarily employed by the Museum as salvage archaeologist. The sites are all of Kayenta Anasazi affinity and two will add greatly to the knowledge of the late Pueblo II and early Pueblo III periods of occupation on the Shonto Plateau. During the summer Roger E. Kelly completed a survey of several proposed seismograph stations in the Payson area. Forty-nine sites were recorded, the bulk of which yielded Tonto Brown. In October the Ninth Ceramic Seminar was held at the Museum. The topic this year was Salada Red Ware. A report on the conference is being prepared and will be available, on request, to interested parties. Excavations begun last academic year by Northern Arizona University anthropology students at Elden Pueblo (NA142), continued for the second season. No new units were begun, but cleaning operations in a large room, called a kiva by J. Walter Fewkes, the original excavator, exposed a now-tumbled cement-capped bench and other features. More charcoal specimens for possible tree-ring dating were recovered from one excavation unit. A second Padre phase pit house at Walnut Canyon National Monument was recently finished. This pit house was partially excavated by Monument Archaeologist Norman Ritchie prior to his transfer to Ocmulgee National Monument, and it will be utilized for a trail-side exhibit. An additional burial was excavated nearby. Laboratory analysis of materials from Elden Pueblo and other recent Northern Arizona University projects continues. Both excavation programs were directed by Roger E. Kelly. In October, 1967, a "workshop" entitled "Prehistoric Man in Northern Arizona" was sponsored for local citizens by the Northern Arizona University Department of Anthro- pology using Title 1, Higher Education Act of 1965 funds granted to the University. A series of evening talks with field trips were held. The Southwestern Archaeological Expedition of the Field Museum of Natural History has completed its 12th year of work in the Upper Little Colorado River region. Attention is currently being focused on Hay Hollow Valley some 10 mi. to the northeast of Snowflake. The research has been supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant GS 984), the Undergraduate Research Participation Program of the National Science Foundation (Grant GY 2944), and the Field Museum of Natural History. The work during the past season was concerned with four projects. First, analysis continued on material exca- vated from the Hay Hollow site. The Hay Hollow village is a late Desert culture-early Mogollon site dating to 300 B.C.-A.D. 300. Pollen analyses are being made in order to control knowledge of both climate and environmental shifts during the period of the occupation of the site. Statistical techniques are being used in analyzing the distributions and covariation of features on the site. A complete attribute list has been developed for pits; this will allow the isolation of types of pits in order to study their association with other features and artifacts. Attri- bute lists also have been developed for manos, metates, "ground objects," and projectile points. These data are being used both in studying processes of tool manufacture and in isolating activity areas on the site. The second project involved the excavation of a hilltop activity area occupied during A.D. 700-900. The area is named the Hatch site after the original homesteader of the region. No habitation structures were found on top of the knoll. It is believed that the structures are along the base of the hill and encircle the knoll. Thus, the elevated portion of the site may be an early equivalent of the plaza. Multivariate analyses will be used in defin- ing activity areas and in studying social processes on the site. 412 [ VOL. 33, No. 3, 1968</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH The third project involved the intensive survey of 8 sq. mi. at the northern end of Hay Hollow Valley. About 250 sites were recorded. The surveys were to provide an idea of the number and range of sites in the area. This knowledge will be important in allowing firmer inferences about the prehistory of the valley and in testing hypotheses of a general anthropological nature. The data from this survey are currently being used to test the hypothesis that as economic autonomy increases, social autonomy increases. Finally, the results of present and past surveys are being used to sharpen the tools for making survey analysis more comprehensive. Archaeologists have generally failed to take advantage of much of the work done by human geographers who have developed sophisticated statistical and nonstatistical techniques for analyzing settlement patterns. An attempt is being made at an evaluation of these techniques and toward development of new techniques which will greatly increase the range and reliability of inferences which can be made with survey data. In addition to the research described above, the third archaeological season for undergraduate students was held at Vernon. The program is given under the auspices of the Undergraduate Research Participation program of the National Science Foundation. Twelve students, four women and eight men, attended the session for a term of 10 weeks. The students are given training in the philosophy and logic of science. Emphasis was placed on the futility of unstructured collection of data. It was pointed out that data gathered without antecedent hypotheses about the connections among the facts under study is self-defeating. On the positive side, hypotheses determine what data should be collected for testing the hypotheses. Student research projects were based upon the idea of testing hypotheses. The results were startling. For example, one student demonstrated that variation in the color and temper of plainware sherds is, like the variation in design elements on black-on-white wares, socially meaningful and usable in the study of social organization. Other stu- dents developed attribute lists for manos and metates and discovered that there are changes in the morphology of these artifacts which seem to accompany the shift from hunting-and-gathering to agriculture. Another student studied the covariation of primary flaking, secondary flak- ing, and heat treating. He was able to isolate significant patterns of covariation in the process of tool manufacture. Southern Arizona. In 1966, excavations of mammoth bones found by Vance Haynes and Peter Mehringer of the Geochronology Department (formerly, Geochronology Laboratories) revealed skeletal elements of at least two mammoth and scattered remains of extinct horse, camel, and bison. The presence of man was indicated by five flint flakes and the possible artificial stacking of bones. The encouraging results of the 1966 work prompted more extensive excavations in 1967 and, as before, the National Geographic Society provided sufficient funds to support a joint expedition of the Arizona State Museum and the Geochronology Department. In eight weeks four mammoth localities were excavated by University of Arizona graduate students with Tom Hemmings as foreman of a crew of 12 anthropology and geology majors. At Murray Springs another mammoth skeleton was uncovered along with several flint tools and parts of three Clovis projectile points. Several tools appear to have been broken during the process of being manufactured by flint knapping, and hundreds of flakes from this work were recovered in situ by careful excava- tion techniques. Emil W. Haury, former director of the Arizona State Museum and investigator of the famous Lehner and Naco mammoth kill sites, believes that numerous elephant foot-size depressions between an ancient stream channel and the low hill where the carcass lay are mammoth tracks. The height of the expedition was reached with the discovery of a most unusual bone tool. The 10-in.-long, eyebolt-like tool is probably made from the wall of a mammoth long bone and is unlike anything that has ever been found with extinct animals in the New World. The closest analogy is the bone shaft wrenches known from the upper Paleolithic of Europe. These are about the same dimension as the Murray Springs tool and also have a 1-in.-diameter hole through the wide part of the tool. Geological investigations clearly show three of the mammoth finds to be the same age as those at the Lehner Clovis site 12 mi. to the south. This has been substan- tiated at the University of Arizona by radiocarbon dating that shows the Murray Springs site to be approximately 11,200 years old, which is the same as the average of six radiocarbon dates from the Lehner mammoth kill site. The Hurley mammoth site is important because geo- logical examination indicates the bones to be in an older unit (30,000 years) than the Clovis site, and very little is known about pre-Clovis occupation of the New World. As elsewhere in this area, no artifacts were found at this older level. In addition to the important archaeological knowledge gained, there were other important aspects of the inves- tigations. The geological work has revealed evidence of the former presence of at least three periods when large lakes occupied the San Pedro Valley within the past 40,000 years. Peter Mehringer's preliminary investigations of fossil pollen at the Murray Springs site suggest cooler climates during the early lake phases. Paleobotanist, Vorsila Bohrer, has identified wood burned to charcoal, presumably by the ancient hunters, as ash (Fraximus sp.). Study of the abundant fossil snails in successive strata promises to shed light on changes of the local environ- ment at different times during the Pleistocene epoch, and from the geological data there will be a partial record of stream action covering more than 40,000 years of prehistory in the San Pedro Valley. An additional success of the project was the experi- mentation conducted on bone and soil preservatives with the hope of finding a suitable formula for permanently preserving these materials for study and display under most weather conditions. Properly thinned epoxy resin has proved very successful, and it is hoped, barring any 413</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY vandalism, that some of the bones can be preserved in situ for future generations to study and enjoy for another 11,000 years. With permission of the landowners, scientific investi- gations by the University of Arizona will continue in the Murray Springs area for at least another year. During the summer of 1967, the University of Arizona completed the fifth season in a long-range program of archaeological investigations in the western half of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation in east-central Arizona. The Archaeological Field School is a joint venture of the Arizona State Museum and the Department of Anthro- pology at the University of Arizona. Excavations have been concentrated at the Grasshopper Ruin, a 14th- century pueblo about 10 mi. west of Cibecue. The primary objective of the field school is to provide for University students practical experience in the field techniques of archaeology, laboratory analysis, and inter- pretation. This objective is reached by the active par- ticipation in an ongoing research program by students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. The field school was in session from June 9 to August 4 with an enrollment of 20 students (15 graduate students and five undergraduates), with 11 of these from the University of Arizona and 9 from other universities. The field school was held on lands leased from the White Mountain Apache tribe, and the archaeological research was carried out under an agreement with the White Mountain Apache Tribal Council. The Univer- sity of Arizona is grateful to the White Mountain Apache for their interest in and encouragement of this program of scientific investigations. During the season, many members of the tribe visited the excavations in progress. During 1967, the field school received support from the National Science Foundation, Advanced Science Semi- nar Program. Students received full support, including tuition and fees, board, housing, and local travel. The field school activities were supervised by Ray- mond H. Thompson, Institutional Director, and Wil- liam A. Longacre, Field Director. The Assistant Director was James E. Ayres (Assistant Archaeologist on the Ari- zona State Museum Staff, and field school alumnus). The dig foreman was P. Bion Griffin (a graduate student at the University of Arizona and field school alumnus); Lilita Bergs (a graduate student in the Department of Anthropology, Syracuse University, and field school alumnus) served as Laboratory Supervisor; and Sharon Urban (a graduate student at the University of Arizona) served as Archaeological Assistant. In addition, a num- ber of visiting lecturers provided a wide breadth of knowledge and experience in archaeology as well as ancillary disciplines such as paleontology, dendrochro- nology, cultural anthropology, and physical anthropology. The fifth season of archaeological research at the Grasshopper Ruin produced interesting and varied results. More than 12,000 potsherds were sorted, and over 500 artifacts were added to the cataloged collections of the Arizona State Museum. Excavations were concentrated in the southeastern portion of the western unit of the site and in both the north and south areas of the eastern unit of rooms. The 1967 season saw the beginning of a several-year project of exploration geared to assist the development of a realistic and scientifically valid sampling design for this 800-room pueblo ruin. These investigations were con- centrated in the eastern unit of the ruin, a block of rooms 140 m. long with about 120 structures. The first step in these operations was to clear the unit of brush and trees. When this was completed, excavation of a minimum of two diagonally opposite corners in each room was undertaken. This permitted an accurate plan of the entire unit to be drawn showing sequences of construction as well as variations in the sizes and shapes of rooms. These data were used to construct a typology of rooms and to define major architectural divisions of the unit. The work in the eastern unit was greatly aided through the use of power equipment. A backhoe was employed during one week to investigate the exterior areas of the entire unit. Exploratory trenches were excavated at 10-m. intervals perpendicular to the exterior walls of the pueblo. This work uncovered unsuspected burial areas and small work areas or plazas as well as providing an accurate picture of the size and shape of the entire unit. The number of rooms of the various types, defined on the basis of size and shape, was determined for each of the divisions of the unit. This allowed stratifying the eastern unit which, in turn, enabled selection of a statis- tically valid stratified sample for excavation. Seven rooms of various types, located in two of the major architectural divisions of the unit, were excavated to floor during 1967. Subfloor investigation of these rooms is planned for the 1968 season. Excavations continued in the western unit of the site, the area in which research was concentrated during the 1965 and 1966 seasons. Two new rooms were begun and completely excavated adjacent to the Great Kiva finished during the 1966 season. In addition, two rooms cleared to floor during 1966 were completed. These subfloor investigations, along with the work in the two new rooms, added a great deal of information to the understanding of the "ceremonial nucleus" of the western unit. The Plaza-Great Kiva complex and the large subplaza features were discovered underneath the floors of the four rooms that were completed in the western unit. During the season, 58 burials were excavated, bringing the total sample to 255 burials from the site. The pur- poseful burials of a coyote and a macaw also were found. Experiments with sherd sorting, which were begun last summer, continued. The potsherds were sorted in terms of the standard Southwestern type-variety system which focuses upon stylistic variation in pottery. In addition, using a typology of containers which was devel- oped in 1966, the students also recorded variation in vessel size and shape, thus crosscutting the stylistic categories. The students were exposed to a wide variety of meth- ods and theory during the 8-week season. They par- ticipated in an average of five lectures and seminars a 414 [ VOL. 33, No. 3, 1968</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH week presented by the professional staff and a number of guest lecturers. The topics ranged from historic archae- ology to the use of computers in processing archaeological data. Don E. Crabtree (Idaho State University Museum), an expert flintknapper, spent several days with the stu- dents during June demonstrating techniques for making stone tools. He also worked with the students in the analysis of lithic tools and waste debris. The field school stresses the graduate student's par- ticipation and involvement in the long-term program of research. Also, equal stress is placed upon all areas of paleoanthropological investigations: research design, sampling, data collection, analysis of data, interpretation, and report preparation. During the course of this inten- sive 8-week session, the students assume more and more professional responsibility in all these areas of scientific research. One excavation project on the highway salvage pro- gram was undertaken by the Arizona State Museum during the last half of 1967. An early Mogollon camp- site was excavated near Heber. Only hearths were uncov- ered at this seasonally occupied site where the ceramics were predominantly Alma and Forestdale Plain. Cameron Greenleaf (Arizona State Museum) is pres- ently compiling a volume on archaeology of the Santa Cruz Valley. His material is being gathered from a large number of sites dug in connection with construction of Interstate 19 from Tucson to Nogales. Beginning in February, 1967, and finishing in June, when the spring semester ended at the University of Arizona, Bernard L. Fontana (Arizona State Museum) led a group of volunteer students on Saturday excava- tions at Mission San Xavier del Bac. This 18th-century mission site is located about 9 mi. from Tucson. Archaeological work at this location, combined with historical research recently done by Father Kieran Mc- Carty, O.F.M., the mission's resident historian, succeeded in locating and identifying the remains of a Jesuit church constructed in 1762 and its later 18th-century Franciscan embellishments. The workers also uncovered a portion of what may be an underlying 1732-built church, the second of four missions at San Xavier del Bac now known to exist. Additional work is planned here. Jorge Olvera (National Institute of Anthropology and History, Mexico City) spent the spring at the Arizona State Mu- seum where he worked on the analysis of the archaeo- logical collections resulting from the 1965 and 1966 excavations in Magdalena de Kino, Sonora, where a successful search was made for the skeletal remains of the Jesuit pioneer, Father Eusebio Kino. Olvera was assisted by various University of Arizona personnel. Preliminary analyses of pollen samples collected from Hohokam-influenced pit house sites in the Walnut Creek district of central Arizona near Payson has begun and will be continued in future seasons. The Palynological Laboratory at Arizona State University also plans exten- sive research on sites in the Gila and Salt River district. This laboratory is maintained as a part of the Department of Anthropology and offers graduate students specialized training in archaeological pollen analysis as a part of programs leading to advanced degrees in Anthropology. The Department of Anthropology, Arizona State Uni- versity, sponsored a 10-week Archaeological Field Camp during the past summer, under the direction of Don- ald H. Morris. The locality was on Walnut Creek, a tributary of Cherry Creek, located 10 mi. southeast of Young. Over 40 students attended the sessions. Pre- liminary surveys of the valley were made, and excava- tions were conducted at two villages. Thirteen houses, eight of them pit houses, were excavated, in addition to trenching in a circular nondomestic structure which measured 15 m. in diameter. Several styles of pit house and surface structure architecture are present. Intrusive painted pottery is present both from the north (Kana-a, Sosi, Kiatuthlanna, and Red Mesa Black-on-white) and from the south (Santa Cruz and Sacaton Red-on-buff). An earlier horizon recognized on the survey has not yet been investigated. The latter is characterized by Lino Gray, White Mound Black-on-white, and Gila Butte Red-on-buff. The latest sites in the valley are built of masonry walls and exhibit Gila Polychrome, Cibecue Polychrome, and Four Mile Polychrome. As part of a continuing project near the abandoned mining community of Perkinsville, Arizona State Uni- versity sponsored a second Archaeological Field School under the direction of Paul Fish and Godfrey Whiffen. Five rooms of a Basketmaker III to Pueblo II pit-house village and two rooms of a small Pueblo III surface structure were excavated. Large quantities of Hohokam material from the Snaketown through the Sacaton phases were recovered at the pit-house village. Although the hope for tree-ring specimens to date the Hohokam ce- ramics failed to materialize, a great many associations with dated northern wares were found. NEW MEXICO. James Schoenwetter is investigating pollen records from New Mexico in conjunction with the archaeological studies of Cynthia Irwin-Williams (Eastern New Mexico University). The pollen sequence of the period between 1400 B.C. and A.D. 300 offers promise of recognition of a number of ecologically distinct hori- zons. These may be used to archaeological advantage in the temporal separation of the rather similar tool assem- blages of this cultural horizon. Reconstruction of the climatic and environmental conditions of the period await results of research planned for 1968 by both Schoenwetter and P. J. Mehringer. This will be one of the first archaeological studies to employ the distinctive talents and interests of two pollen analysts. Responding to the report of an amateur (Kenneth Hansen, of Santa Fe), Joseph Allen, Marjorie Lambert, and Sallie Wagner (Museum of New Mexico) conducted test excavations of a 4-m.-deep deposit of sediment at the bottom of a 45-m.-deep volcanic pipe located about 20 mi. west of Santa Fe. When he first visited the site, Hansen found a number of complete and partial arrows, the skull and cervical vertebrae of an adult human, and a variety of mammal, bird, and reptilian remains. Dessi- cation had preserved the tissue on many of the faunal specimens. The subsequent excavations yielded addi- tional specimens in all of the above categories, though 415</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY faunal remains predominated. Modern detritus, metal, glass, and textiles showed the site to have been visited by others in recent times. Worked stone implements, a few bone tools and a single Rio Grande Glaze potsherd show that the site was known prehistorically, and it may have been used occasionally as a shrine. Under a contract with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Museum of New Mexico excavated all or parts of eight sites along a proposed highway on the Navajo Reservation between Newcomb and Toadlena. Six of the sites were small, apparently seasonally occupied sites, consisting of one or two hearths. Three of these were associated with La Plata phase ceramics; two were short- term Navajo occupations; and one was of either the Archaic or Navajo period. A portion of a larger La Plata phase site produced a circular pit house, 9.4 m. in diameter and 2 m. deep, with a central, slab-lined hearth, slab partition, and encircling bench. An antechamber or ventilator on the east side, had there been one, appar- ently was obliterated by a later, smaller pit house, rec- tangular in shape, and measuring 4 m. by 4 m. Interior features included a central hearth, deflector, slab par- tition, ventilator, and a bin. One portion of a two-component site consisted of a refuse area, several slab-lined bins, and the ventilator of a pit house which lay outside the highway right-of-way. Associated pottery was an assemblage of Pueblo I deco- rated (carbon paint) and culinary types indigenous to the Chuska Valley. A Pueblo II component represented by two surface rooms and associated refuse appeared to show a continuity from the earlier component. The excavations were under the direction of Richard C. Chapman. Under another contract with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a survey and flagging project was carried out on the Ute Indian Reservation in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado. Field work was done by Curtis Schaafsma, Polly Schaafsma, and Michael Mar- shall. Over 500 sites on the mesa tops east and south of Mesa Verde National Park were flagged prior to the chaining of pinyon and juniper trees in the area. Because of the urgency of the survey, only 304 sites were recorded in detail; these showed the complete range of Mesa Verde phases. A series of puebloan petroglyph panels on a volcanic promontory just west of the town of Los I.unas, south of Albuquerque, were recorded by Polly and Curtis Schaafs- ma. The petroglyphs were destined for destruction when the volcanic rock was quarried for use as surfacing mate- rial along a portion of Interstate 25. Mrs. Schaafsma was able to discern two petroglpyh components: Class A, with solidly pecked figures of mountain sheep, deer, and unidentifiable quadrupeds, birds, fish, geometric designs, and abstract line motifs of as yet undetermined age, but sharing a basic tradition with earlier Anasazi rock art; and Class B, with masks and ceremonially clad figures predominating and awanyus (horned serpents), spread- winged birds, shield motifs, checkerboard designs, and other abstract figures. Most of these Class B petroglyphs are familiar figures in the ceremonial world of the mod- ern pueblos, and as such would probably date during Pueblo IV and V. Coincidentally, the Class A petro- glyphs occurred most commonly on bedrock cliff faces, whereas the Class B rock art usually occurred on talus boulders. Although hampered by the heaviest snows in local memory, a highway salvage project along Apache Creek, near Reserve was conducted by Joseph Allen and Thomas Caperton. Already dug or scheduled to be excavated are a series of small Reserve and Tularosa phase pueblos and three or four structures of a probable Pine Lawn phase pit-house site. Bertha Dutton (Museum of Navaho Ceremonial Art) reports that mapping and testing activities on ruins in the Galisteo area have been made under the direction of Curt Shaafsma. He also studied the lithic materials from Las Madres and Pueblo Largo. The Paleo-Indian Institute and the Department of Anthropology have become separate divisions within East- ern New Mexico University. G. A. Agogino retains his post as Director of the Institute and also assumes the chairmanship of the Department of Anthropology in association with Cynthia Irwin-Williams, Carlton Crane, and Mary Edmunston. Under the new program, the Paleo-Indian Institute will become the research section of anthropology on the Eastern New Mexico University campus and will also control the Blackwater Draw, Paleo-Indian Institute, and general anthropology museums. The Blackwater Draw Museum is a state museum being currently developed to show Early Man in New Mexico, while the other museums are on the campus of Eastern New Mexico University. In the summer of 1967, research was conducted by Cynthia Irwin-Williams on the Anasazi Origins project, northwest of Albuquerque, under National Science Foun- dation sponsorship. The project is expected to establish a clear Archaic picture for the Southwest. She also spent this fall in the Puebla, Mexico, area, continuing her National Science Foundation-supported research on Early Man cultures in this region. The Paleo-Indian Institute, continuing its policy to work with established and qualified amateur archaeo- logical societies when they request help or show promis- ing projects, is currently engaged with the Albuquerque chapter of the state amateur society in research con- nected with Cynthia Irwin-Williams' Anasazi projects. Working with professional help, they are instructed in projects that they can best handle with professional assistance. The arrangement thus far has been most satisfactory. A. Lynn Coffin, one of the original discoverers of the Lindenmeier Folsom campsite in northern Colorado, is currently cooperating with George Agogino regarding the location of several new "hot spots" found in a previously unworked section of the Lindenmeier site. This new location will be recorded but not excavated, unless the location seems in danger from either natural erosional causes or through human vandalism. A recent transfer in ownership of this land has made it difficult for any pro- [ VOL. 33, No. 3, 1968 416</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH fessional organization to undertake large-scale research at this famous site in the near future. Outside of the Albuquerque region, Sandia points are few in number throughout the Southwest, but a study recently undertaken by students at Eastern New Mexico University indicates the presence of roughly a dozen such points in the High Plains areas of West Texas and Eastern New Mexico. The age, scope, and significance of the Sandia Complex are all controversial, but prospects are such that the complex and its cultural-chronological problems may eventually be cleared up and better understood. During the summer of 1967 George Agogino worked at three archaeological sites. A small cave, called Billy the Kid Cave, was closed down after two season's research failed to produce any Paleo-Indian material within the cavern. The site did reveal evidence of puebloid and nomadic Plains Indians, as well as a late Archaic horizon. Although five Folsom-Midland points were found just outside the mouth of the cavern, no additional Paleo- Indian material was found inside, nor did extensive test trenching reveal any additional early material in the area where the Folsom-Midland points were found. Work continued during the summer of 1967 at Black- water Draw, located 7 mi. from the Eastern New Mexico University campus, under the project direction of Alberto Isequilla (Yale University and the University of Paris). It is expected that this same leadership arrangement will continue in the summer of 1968. During the field season of 1967, a pit 35 ft. sq., dropping 20 ft. before reaching the first Paleo level, was excavated southwest of the old lake shore. This was the first time, to our knowledge, that work has been conducted at Blackwater in an area beyond the region 6f the old lake shoreline. Results show a reasonable cultural concentration at all Paleo-Indian levels. For the second year, a joint project led by Robert Weber (New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technol- ogy) and George Agogino (Paleo-Indian Institute) has worked at Mockingbird Gap, one of the largest Clovis sites ever found. The site, located close to the location of the first atomic explosion, has produced almost 100 whole or fragmentary Clovis points and associated Llano-complex artifacts, along with tools of the Cody complex and Archaic lithic items. During the past two years, trenching has indicated that at least part of this extensive site, which apparently is a campsite rather than a kill site, is still intact. Work is continuing on the development of two museums, the Miles Museum on the campus of Eastern New Mexico University and the Blackwater Draw Museum, located midway between the towns of Clovis and Portales, where Blackwater Draw crosses Highway 70. Work in both museums is going slowly, since both institutional and state funds permit only a slow rate of development. The anthropology complex on campus currently con- sists of four offices and two storage rooms in the Com- munication Building; in addition, there are more than 200 lighted display cases making up the Paleo-Indian Institute Museum and the general anthropology museum. Also, anthropology controls approximately one-half of a large, three-story dairy barn (for storage), two small former residences, and four rooms and a storage area in the old Physical Education complex. This area is for storage, research, and laboratory use. Classrooms are now largely assigned to anthropology in the modern Liberal Arts Building. TEXAS. T. N. Campbell (University of Texas at Austin) has completed the second phase of a two-phase survey of the Big Bend National Park for the National Park Service. This survey has resulted in the location of approximately 400 sites, mostly of Archaic and Neo-American occupa- tions within the park boundaries. The Texas Archeological Salvage Project continued its work in the Amistad International Reservoir on the Texas-Mexican border near Del Rio, Texas, from June until December of 1967. Intensive excavations were car- ried out at Arenosa Shelter (41 VV99) by David S. Dibble. This is a well-stratified terrace midden deposit at least 47 ft. in total thickness and primarily of Archaic occupation. Additional data pertinent to the culture sequence of the Amistad region were obtained by con- tinued excavations at the Devil's Mouth site (41 VV 188), under the direction of William M. Sorrow. A nearby stratified midden of late occupation also was tested by Sorrow. Seven dry rockshelters in the reservoir were tested for content and condition of perishable materials by Michael B. Collins, and two more were more exten- sively excavated by Collins and Robert K. Alexander. Several of these sites yielded excellent samples of food waste and artifacts, and a number of coprolites of prob- able human origin. Beginning in November, 1967, the El Paso Archaeo- logical Society, directed by Vernon Brook and Leslie Davis, began trenching a reservoir (?) apparently affiliated with the occupation of the Hot Well site (A.D. 1200- 1400). The evident shape of the reservoir is ellipsoidal, and it measures 70 ft. by 40 ft. Trenching of the short axis has failed to uncover any evidence of plaster on the faces of the banks, or any walls. Pottery sherds have been recovered from depths down to 64 in. below the present surface, and they indicate that the resident pottery types were typical of those affiliated with the El Paso phase of the Mogollon. El Paso Polychrome constitutes over 90 per cent of the total recovered sherds, with Chupadero Black-on-white and Ramos Polychrome also present. Soil and pollen samples are being taken at 6-in. levels in addition to each stratigraphic level. Cur- rently, 10 stratigraphic levels have been identified through 70 in. of removal. Present observable profiles indicate the reservoir may have filled with sedimentation before final abandonment and subsequent filling by shifting sand. NORTHERN MEXICO. The Casas Grandes research team (The Amerind Foundation, Inc.) continued its studies of the Medio, Tardio, and Espafioles periods of the Casas Grandes culture under a grant from the National Science Foundation. Use will be made of a computer to help 417</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY analyze part of the data; consequently, the information relating to pottery vessels, the attributes of bone, stone and ceramic artifacts, and their architectural proveniences is now being recorded in numeric form. It is hoped that these data will make possible the delineation of a model of artifact associations which will distinguish family clusters of architectural units from those of a guild organization. Charles C. Di Peso has plotted site distributions in northern Chihuahua, Sonora, southern Arizona, and New Mexico using survey data and a combination of topo- graphic and aerial photographic maps. A pattern of specific types of sites and of densities in relation to topography was noted. He has also been reviewing the documentation on the early historic period (in particular, accounts of Ibarra, de Vaca, and de Niza) and has been comparing these with the most recent and more accurate maps. This has suggested an identification of the late Casas Grandes people as the historic Jova. John B. Rinaldo and Gloria J. Fenner have been assisted in their studies of the pottery and artifacts by Beloit students Sonja Jerkic, Jane Myers, John Graham, Michael Loftus, Susan Glowski, and Lucretia Schryver. The sections on the pottery, ceramic artifacts, and the bone artifacts have been completed, as well as a con- siderable portion of that on the stone artifacts. The review and synthesis of the architectural information are progressing. ALEXANDER J. LINDSAY, JR. WESTERN MESOAMERICA MEXICO. James Schoenwetter is continuing palyno- logical studies on samples from Oaxaca, Mexico, in con- junction with the archaeological investigations of K. V. Flannery. He reports the occurrence of pollen identified as either teosinte or wild maize, together with seeds of beans and squash from the lower levels in Guila Naquitz Cave. The association is dated some 2,000 years prior to the macrofossils of wild maize recovered at Tehuacan. The importance of the find is placed in perspective by the work of Smith and Flannery on the plant macro- fossils and bones from these levels. Though cultigens were known, the vast majority of the diet was provided by collected foods. The paleoclimatic sequence in Oaxaca is far from adequately known through these pollen studies, but some matters are clear: since about 600 B.c. such envi- ronmental fluctuations as are known to have occurred were not of sufficient severity to affect the agricultural base of the cultural sequence.. About 900 to 800 B.c., a period of aridity is evidenced. Very large, villages had already been established at this date, however, and there is reason to believe that forms of irrigation were already known. The wettest conditions evidenced in the pollen sequence occurred at about 3200 B.c. These data shed some doubt on the accepted belief of a uniformly arid Altithermal period in highland Mexico. ALEXANDER J. LINDSAY, JR. EASTERN MESOAMERICA GUATEMALA. The following information has been supplied by William A. Haviland and William R. Coe. The third season of investigation of the Tikal sustaining area, which was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation, ended in July, 1967. Director of this project was William A. Haviland, with Dennis E. Puleston serving as field director; under their direction was a field staff of 14. Prior to 1967, four radial strips which run north, south, east, and west from the Great Plaza of Tikal were mapped. Each strip is 500 m. wide and 12 km. long. In 1967, two similar strips were mapped; one of these runs 3 km. west from the north end of the north radial strip. From the west end of this short strip, the second runs 6.5 km. north to Uaxactin, to terminate at the center point of the old Ricketson Uaxactun housemound survey. In all, 1,720 structures, 342 chultuns, and 5 embanked reservoirs have been mapped on these strips. These maps show that there is a marked drop off in the density of ruin mounds as one goes out from Tikal, despite repeated assertions to the contrary. To the east and west, this drop off correlates with the presence of extensive bajo areas. To the north and south, however, the decreased mound density occurs 4.5 km. and 7 km., respectively, from the Great Plaza, despite the fact that there continues to be terrain well suited for habitation. Associated with this occupation decline are artificially constructed earthworks, which appear to have been for defensive purposes. These may, therefore, be considered to set the maximum north and south limits of Tikal so far as settlement density is concerned. From this infor- mation, then, it is clear that Tikal (in Late Classic times) extended over an area much larger than the 16 sq. km. covered by the site map. Hence, previously published popu- lation estimates of 10,000 to 11,000 people for Late Classic Tikal will have to be revised upward considerably. Some 43 structure-groups on the south radial strip, and 47 on the north radial strip, were test-pitted. In addition, 14 structures on the south strip were more extensively excavated, along with two chultuns and the embank- ments of the Laguna Verde reservoir. This work has indicated that not all of the ruins mapped in the survey strips were occupied in Late Classic times. This is in 'marked contrast to the situation in central Tikal, where virtually all visible small structure ruins show Late Classic occupation. Furthermore, there appear to have been significant differences in small structure architecture between central Tikal and the surrounding area. In addition to the above work on the radial strips, a survey of ramon or breadnut trees was carried out on the south strip. In order to test the proposition that such trees are concentrated in the vicinity of ancient ruins, all ramon trees within 50 m. on either side of the center of the strip, over its entire length, were mapped and counted. The results do demonstrate a clear association between numbers of trees and density-of mounds. The data strongly suggest that this distribution is attributable to the activities of the Maya, who either spared ramon trees where others were cut down, or else actually planted [ VOL. 33, No. 3, 1968 418</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH the trees. The ramon tree produces a tremendous amount of food of high nutritional value for relatively little output of human energy, and it may well have been an important source of food for the ancient Maya. Very few ruin mounds were encountered on the south portion of the Uaxactin strip, despite the fact that it crosses about a kilometer of gently rolling terrain and the high El Palmar ridge. There is a mound concentra- tion between 6.5 and 4.8 km. south of Uaxactuin, and a number of structures on raised platforms occur within a 2 km. radius of Uaxactuin. In the 7,000 sq. m. of the old Ricketson survey area which are covered by the present Uaxactuin strip, over 20 previously unrecorded ruin mounds were noted in addition to those of the Ricketson survey. Aside from this work on the various survey strips, small nucleated sites in other locations received con- siderable attention. Prior to 1967, a number of such sites in or near the Tikal National Park were located and mapped. In 1967, excavations were carried out at Uolantin, Navajuelal, Himbal, and a site on the eastern periphery of Tikal. At Uolantuin, Stela 1 and the asso- ciated temple were excavated by Puleston. Test pits were also excavated in 10 smaller mound groups. Uolantiun proved to be an incredibly rich site and is noteworthy for the following: 1) A sequence of at least nine superimposed cere- monial structures, which show a change from a pattern which employed squat but massive lateral extensions to create architectural impressiveness to a pattern similar to that seen in the "Great Temples" of Tikal. 2) Evidence for very early ceremonial structures and cached offerings, which lie below construction fill in which are found ceramics of the Eb, and possibly early Tzec, ceramic complexes. 3) Evidence for the possibility that the Maya made use of, and perhaps favored, hilltop shrines before the development of more conveniently located major centers. Although Uolantun appears to have been an important center in Preclassic times, its influence seems to have waned as that of Tikal increased. 4) The collection of about 600 censer fragments, the majority of which appear to date from the late Late Classic period. The evidence suggests that Uolantuin reemerged as an important ceremonial center at this time. At Navajuelal, a small nucleated site 9.5 km. south of the Great Plaza of Tikal, six structures were excavated by Ernestene Green. Construction at this locus began in Early Classic times, and it included a substantial range- type structure and a major temple. The smaller structures include some which may have served as houses. The temple is of particular interest in that the masonry is very similar to that used in temples at Tikal between Early and Late Classic times, whereas the plan of the building is atypical. Rather, it is similar to the plan of the temple building of Uaxactun E Group. Construction activity at Navajuelal tapered off during Late Classic times, and the site was ultimately aban- doned, though people evidently returned, after abandon- ment, for ceremonial activity. Crude stone walls were built in the main temple which sealed off the back room and much of the front room. There was no formal tomb associated with the Navajuelal temple, but a burial, which contained pottery of the Eznab complex, was intruded through the stairway. In the course of later visitations to the temple, a few vessels of the Caban complex were deposited. At Jimbal, which is located just north of the Tikal National Park, Stelae 1 and 2 were excavated by Haviland, and architectural observations were made by H. Stanley Loten. These 10th-Cycle stelae, along with several plain monuments, stand in the main plaza, which is larger than the Great Plaza of Central Tikal. They both show some stylistic relationship to the contemporary Tikal Stela 11, but in addition they contain some glyphs which are sug- gestive of Mexican influence. Apparently neither monu- ment was set in place with a cached offering. Stela 1 was associated with a late architectural development of the large temple which sits on the east side of the main plaza. The masonry and some of the decorative moldings of this temple, however, are similar to those of Tikal temples of Early Classic to early Late Classic times. Other architectural details appear to be unique. On the north side of the Plaza is a T-shaped ball court having its south endfield open and that on the north delimited. North of this is the ruin of an apparently round structure. Extensive excavation would be required to reveal archi- tectural details of these and other structures at Jimbal. In a group of mounds a little over 4 km. east of the Great Plaza of Tikal a new carved monument was dis- covered. It is probably a stela and was designated as Stela 34. As found, it lay on its back about half-way down the back of a mound, almost 3 m. high, from which it had apparently fallen. The stone is very small, 1.05 m. high, 80 cm. wide, and 31 cm. thick. The carving is badly weathered, but the form of a seated figure can still be recognized. In the crook of the left arm is a mask, or trophy head, as on Early Classic Tikal Stelae 18 and 31. No glyphs are evident, but slightly more than half of the back is as yet unexamined. Limited excavations by Puleston revealed that the above-described mound is the ruin of a flat-topped py- ramidal platform, with no trace of a masonry building. Access to the top was probably provided by a single stairway. A reconstructable Early Classic cache vessel apparently came from a structure cache, but no evidence for a stela cache was found. It is worth noting that although this group of mounds and the stela fall within the radius of Late Classic Tikal, it may well have been separate from the Tikal ceremonial center in Early Classic times. This would seem to put the Stela 34 group in the same general category as Uolantun. Archaeological work within central Tikal in 1966 and 1967 represented an attempt to terminate satisfactorily a decade of detailed excavation and recording. With a view to its consolidation, an extraordinary quantity of major architecture was uncovered in 1966 in the Central Acropolis, particularly in the intricately composed east 419</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY court (Structures 5D-46, etc.). The final Late Classic stage of the Acropolis covered some 4 acres and con- sisted of 42 buildings, mainly of the "palace" type. Excavations here by Peter D. Harrison and assistants yielded an unprecedented quantity of precise data on structural composition and growth which forms a massive segment of what has been learned over the years of the elite architecture of Central Tikal, a record spanning over 1,200 years. In 1966 further important collections of material were gained from occupation debris referable to the early Postclassic (Eznab) domestic occupation of the Central Acropolis. To complete a summary of the central Tikal work (last given in American Antiquity, Vol. 31, No. 3) we should also mention dedicatory tomb Burials 195 and 196 from Structures 5D-73 and 32, respectively. Dis- covered in late 1965, Burial 195 belongs to Ik (Tepeu I) times, while 196 is of the Imix (Tepeu 2) phase and in many ways is similar to Burial 116 of Temple I. These two interments produced a striking array of wealth. Burial 195 was notable for the quantity of stuccoed wooden material it contained, including carved panels, a small throne, a ball-game yoke, and four identical figures of the axe-in-forehead rain god. Burial 196 included finely- painted polychrome pottery and, among other resplen- dent material, a jade jaguar 61/2 in. long. Much of this material has been illustrated in a recently released guide to Tikal (Tikal: A Handbook of the Ancient Maya Ruins, by William Coe, The University Museum, Philadelphia). Excavation in the North Acropolis, carried on since 1958, was reluctantly terminated in 1966. Structure 5D- 32, the source of Burial 195, is of the early Late Classic, a period which formerly was something of a gap in our knowledge of the chronology. As was true of many other North Acropolis temples, the rooms here had been thoroughly looted of cached deposits, probably during the early Postclassic period. Room refuse contained a num- ber of fragmented pottery effigy and plain censers of excellent quality. Structure 5D-33 was dissected to a point where the impressively masked Structures 5D-33- 2nd and -3rd are now partially visible beneath the basal mass of the Late Classic temple (lst) that covered them. The greater part of major stratigraphic problems that had plagued excavators over the years were inci- dentally solved in the course of this work. The amazingly complex architectural stratigraphy of the North Acropolis (outlined in articles in Science and Expedition) has been generously searched over these years, although valuable data, particularly of Preclassic times, remain unrecovered off the main lines of excavation. As much as two seasons of heavy trenching and tunneling would be required to test what remains, but such work is now impossible given the reasonable decision to cease excavation to the benefit of architectural consolidation and publication. Refined artifactual and ceramic studies and recording will be continued during the summer of 1968. An ardu- ous program, directed by H. Stanley Loten, of getting on paper all visible architecture beyond that exposed in excavation must be completed in 1968 and 1969. The project's architectural records now cover close to 500 structural entities. The three-year contract between the Government of Guatemala and the University Museum signed in 1966 extended the program of architectural consolidation and limited reconstruction at Tikal until the end of 1969. This contract increased the annual grants by the Govern- ment of Guatemala to the Tikal Project well beyond sums apportioned under a prior 1964 contract. The resulting program, now directed by Alfred Kidder II, with George F. Guillemin as its field director, has enormously accelerated repair of buildings in the Central and North Acropolis. The Tikal Project is now deeply involved in the prob- lem of getting into print the field data that have accumu- lated unrelentingly since 1956. About 30 Tikal Reports, many multivolumed, and with a total of some 35 authors, are now scheduled for completion as close to 1970 as possible. This publication program, coordinated by Wil- liam Coe, is based at the University Museum, Philadel- phia, although in many cases its contributors are widely scattered. The problems of funding, integration, and execution, while not unusual as such, have been greatly amplified by the absolutely staggering quantity of data demanding description, interpretation, and synthesis. GARETH W. LOWE CENTRAL AMERICA Field work during the months between July and December, 1967, was minimal. Therefore, most com- ments here refer to newly-published results from older excavations. EL SALVADOR. During this period, Stanley H. Boggs excavated in Valle San Juan, Departmento de Usulutan, where he recorded some subterranean ovens. He also investigated Almolonga, near Chalchuapa, and recovered what may be a unique seated clay figure on an altar in the middle of a big temple. Further excavations, hope- fully, will clarify this. Boggs recently reported three early urns from the Loma de Tacazin, near San Salvador, buried beneath several layers of humus and volcanic material at a depth of about 2 m. The olla-shaped jars contained human bones sprinkled with red ocher. One of the jars decorated with an appliqued fillet with thumb impressions faintly resembles some large globular vessels from Gualacho, in eastern El Salvador. The latter are believed to be Formative age, while Boggs thinks his jars are Preclassic. Haberland recently published a short notice about a hitherto unknown nonceramic complex. It is called Morazan and is found in the northeastern part of the republic. In spite of the fact that no ceramic material has been found, he does not think that the Morazan complex belongs to the preceramic time. Rather, he believes it represents a late hunting population in a region scarcely suitable for native agriculture. HONDURAS. Claude F. Baudez (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris) recently published a pre- 420 [ VOL. 33, No. 3, 1968</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH liminary report on his excavations in the Cholulteca and at Lo de Vaca, near Comayagua. At Lo de Vaca he found three different phases, numbered I to III. Baudez thinks that Lo de Vaca I is contemporary wtih Yarumela 2, as established by Canby; Lo de Vaca II with Yarumela 3 and Ulua Bichrome, and Lo de Vaca III with Yarumela 4 and Ulua Yojoa Polychrome. The Cholulteca sequence con- sists of five phases. The earliest, Chismuyo, is con- temporary with Ulua Bichrome and is thought to have ended about A.D. 550. It is followed by San Lorenzo (not to be confused with a phase of the same name in use in Chiriqui) and Fonseca, covering the time up to A.D. 1000 and, therefore, coeval with Ulua Yojoa Polychrome. The Early Postclassic period is represented by the Amapala phase in the Cholulteca sequence. The Malalaca is a Late Postclassic phase ending about Conquest time. Ha- berland notes certain similarities between this material and the material he has gotten from eastern El Salvador. There might be some types among the Lo de Vaca I mate- rial which have connections with the Gualacho pottery. Chiri Polychrome, belonging to the San Lorenzo and Fonseca phases, is definitely present among the types forming the Lower Lempa phase. The Malalaca sherds seem to be very much like those from the La Pitaya phase. On the other hand, nothing comparable to the Chismuyo phase has yet been seen or reported from El Salvador. It is to be hoped that Baudez will continue his investigations in this region to at least bring some more light into this long-neglected part of the country. NICARAGUA. The only news to be reported from here is the construction and opening in Juigalpa of the Museo de Chontales, by the Clan Intelectual de Chontales. A photograph received recently shows a moder building, in front of which a number of the famous stone statues of the Chontales style (mostly from the Sierra de Amer- risque) have been erected. COSTA RICA. Claude F. Baudez published his extensive final report on his excavations in the Tempisque Valley, Guanacaste, made during the dry season of 1959-60. The detailed description of the stratigraphic sequences and ceramic types will certainly make it a classic for further research in Central America. Without going into details, it seems important to mention the various radiocarbon dates and the resulting chronological position of the different periods. Baudez places the earliest period, Zoned Bichrome (represented by his Catalina phase), between 300 B.C. and A.D. 300. The dating rests on two radiocarbon dates from the Ortega site, 259 B.C. + 99 and 296 B.C. ? 95/98 (GsY 100) and one from the contemporary Chombo phase of Michael D. Coe's site Chahuite Escon- dida, A.D. 90 ? 200 (Y-810). The Line-decorated period (his Ciruelas phase) occupies the time between A.D. 300 and A.D. 500. No radiocarbon dates were available for this period. The Early Polychrome period (his San Bosco phase) is dated between A.D. 500 and A.D. 800 by virtue of a single radiocarbon date of A.D. 565 - 90 (Y-811) from Coe's Matapalo phase of the same site. Another date of Coe's sequence, relating to the Tamarindo phase, reads A.D. 970 ? 70 (Y-815). It places the Middle Poly- chrome period from A.D. 800 to A.D. 1200. There are three radiocarbon dates for the Late Polychrome period (A.D. 1200-1600): one from Coe's La Cruz A phase, reading A.D. 1120 ? 70 (Y-816); the ether two from Baudez' Bebedero phase, both obviously from the same sample from La Bocana (A.D. 1484 + 85 and A.D. 1408 + 85 [GsY-98]). With this, Baudez was for the first time able to establish a reasonably correct absolute-dated sequence in Costa Rica. Minor changes may be necessary when more dates are available, but at least some Central American periods can now be more meaningfully com- pared with those of other areas. PANAMA. The fourth Boletin del Museo Chiricano again offers valuable information on several sites in the Province of Chiriqui. Of special importance is one by Eugenio Flinn and Roberto de la Guardia on the site of Querevalos, Distrito de Alanje, which is another site of the still-unnamed phase with burial urns. It shows, however, several pottery fragments of typical Aguas Buenas style. How this puzzle can be solved is still unknown. Other reports in the same bulletin are con- cerned with burial sites of the "Classic" period of Chiriqui. Further details have been received about the excava- tions conducted by Thelma H. Bull (Archaeological Society of Panama; see Current Research, American Antiquity, Vol. 33, No. 1) at the Paso Espave site, near Guarare, Province of Los Santos. Twelve urn burials have been found (not nine as mentioned before) con- taining up to four skeletons in a single urn. Several of those globular vessels with straight necks have multiple handles (up to eight) placed horizontally, while others have two vertical handles. They are either unpainted, red-brown, or, in one case, have horizontal red and purple bands on a whitish background. The covers are generally plates or deep bowls, some of them with poly- chrome decorations. Besides the skeletons (probably representing secondary burials, as indicated by the size of the urns) up to three small pottery vessels and up to three celts were deposited inside the urns. Sometimes more ceramics had been placed outside the urn. A small heavily weathered human figure found inside the poly- chrome urn is especially interesting. It is carved in the round out of shell, is about 3 in. high, and two holes suggest that it may have been worn on a necklace. Of the two or three extended primary burials, one was accompanied by no less than 26 ceramics of different shapes, a metate, and a celt. Only one vessel and a metate were found with the second burial. The third burial consisted of 28 pottery vessels and a chisel, but no human bones. As two urns were in the immediate vicinity of this pottery pile, it is also probable that they were associated. Other features of Mound I found by Mrs. Bull in- cluded a clay floor extending over the whole excavated area (thus sealing burial shafts) and a stairway made out of eight stone slabs. The relation of the last-mentioned feature to the floor is unknown. Occupational debris, i.e., sherd material, was rare. This, like other traits, is 421</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY contrary to Haberland's experience when testing the same site. He concentrated, however, on the areas between the mounds, which may explain the differences. Not men- tioned by Mrs. Bull in her report are layers of shell found by Haberland. Mrs. Bull mentioned, also, that bone material has been submitted for dating purposes and that further excavations in the same site are planned. This would be of much interest, as it may throw some more light on the obviously complicated archaeological picture of the Azuero Peninsula. WOLFGANG HABERLAND HIGHLAND SOUTH AMERICA PERU. James B. Richardson III (University of Pitts- burgh) undertook further reconnaissance and excavation in 1966 and 1967 near Talara in northwest Peru. During the course of this work, he focused his attention on elaborating his descriptions of the preceramic Siches, Estero, and Honda phases and in working out their absolute and relative chronologies (American Antiquity 1966: 775). A radiocarbon measurement on a charcoal sample from a single component Siches site (PV8-13) associated with the mangrove-dwelling Andadara tuber- culosa yielded an age of 6050 B.C. + 140 (GX-1002). Three charcoal samples from the type-site of the Honda phase (PV7-16) dated at 2870 B.C. - 95 (GX-0993), 3235 B.c. + 105 (GX-0994), and 3200 B.C. + 105 (GX- 0995). A multicomponent site (PV7-19) containing artifacts of all three preceramic complexes yielded radio- carbon dates of 2855 B.C. + 130 (GX-0996), 4040 B.c. ? 120 (GX-0998), and 6030 B.C. - 130 (GX-0997). On the basis of these measurements, Richardson suggests that the Siches phase dates about 6000 B.C. and the Honda phase about 3000 B.c. Similarities between the Estero phase and dated preceramic complexes elsewhere in the Central Andes suggest that it probably dates about 5000 B.C. and is intermediate between the Honda and Siches phases. Richardson also obtained a date of 1440 B.C. + 125 (GX-1003) for a ceramic-stage site (PV8-7) contain- ing Paita C or D pottery. Donald A. Proulx (University of Massachusetts) made an archaeological survey of the Nepefia Valley during the summer of 1967. He recorded 110 sites, of which 57 were cemeteries, 35 habitation sites, 14 ceremonial cen- ters, and 4 fortresses. Most of these date to the Middle horizon or the Late Intermediate period. No Late horizon sites were definitely identified; however, pottery in private collections made in Nepefa indicates that there was an occupation dating to this period in the valley, although it may not have been a particularly large one. Proulx also reports that no Moche habitation sites were found in the valley in spite of the large ceremonial complex at Pafiamarca with its Moche III murals; the presence of several Recuay sites, which are approximately contem- porary with the Moche occupations in the coastal valleys to the north, suggests to him that Nepefia may have been a frontier area of the Moche state. One Early horizon site was discovered in addition to Cerro Blanco and Punkuri, which were already known from earlier explora- tion in the valley. No preceramic sites and only one possible Initial period site were located; however, Proulx expects that these will be found once the coastal area of the valley is surveyed intensively. Hernan Amat (Patronato Nacional de Argueologia Peruana) and Luis G. Lumbreras (Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos) are continuing their investigation at Chavin de Huantar. They have excavated several galleries in the structure since 1966 and have found offerings of pottery vessels in them. Typological differ- ences among the vessels in the galleries suggest that they were used during a considerable part of the Early horizon. Charcoal from Excavation P1-RCA in the Galeria de las Ofrendas gave a radiocarbon date of 750 B.C. + 85 (GX-1128). Members of the Eighth Peabody Museum, Harvard University, Archaeological Expedition to Peru directed by Thomas C. Patterson undertook extensive excavations in the Anc6n shell mounds (PV45-2). Between June and September, 1967, they made 33 excavations ranging in depth from one to more than 8 m. A preliminary analysis of the excavated materials, made concurrently with the excavations, suggests that they yielded a complete sequence from the appearance of pottery at Ancon to near the end of the Early horizon. Five pottery styles were distinguished on the basis of ware characteristics, vessel shapes, and decorative features; each style can be further subdivided into one or more chronologically distinct phases. The earliest pottery at Anc6n belongs to the Florida style and is always found in strata immediately overlying extensive preceramic deposits. The basic ware of the Florida style is a brown ware with polisher depressions on exterior surfaces; it was fired in an uncontrolled atmosphere at low temperatures. A slightly lustrous polished ware is associated with the brown ware in some strata. Florida style pottery occurs in two sections of the site. In one, the surface of the preceramic deposit is fairly even, and clear separation of the ceramic and pre- ceramic layers is achieved fairly easily. Three phases can be distinguished from the stratigraphic evidence in this sector. The earliest phase occurs in Excavation 6, Stratum 3, and is composed mainly of relatively thin brown ware neckless ollas with unthickened rims. The second phase was found in seven excavations in this sector and is characterized by ollas with thickened and unthickened rims, bowls and polished enclosed vessels with broad incised lines or fugitive black-painted geometric designs on their exterior surfaces. The Florida pottery of the third phase is slightly thicker than that of the preceding phase and contains a number of new olla and bowl rim shapes. The polished ware and painted and incised decoration of the preceding unit persist into this phase. In the other section where Florida pottery occurs, the surface of the preceramic deposit is very uneven, and it is difficult to obtain clear separation between the prece- ramic and ceramic strata. Here, the Florida pottery con- sists of a relatively thick brown ware from which undeco- rated ollas and open bowls were made. The chronological relationships of this unit with those of the other section 422 [ VOL. 33, No. 3, 1968</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT RESEARCH of the site are not certain at the present time because of the spatial separation of the two areas. This phase can be seriated either before or after the Florida phases isolated in the other area. This problem will be resolved once the collections are studied in detail. Charcoal from Excavation 6, Stratum 3, yielded a radiocarbon date of 1285 B.C. + 120 (GX-1129) for one unit of the Florida style. The second Florida phase recognized in Stratum 2 of the same excavation was dated at 1200 B.C. + 110 and 1220 B.c. + 95 (GX-1135). These measurements do not agree particularly well with a radiocarbon date obtained from charcoal associated with similar pottery at the Huaca La Florida in the Rimac Valley; this measurement is 1695 B.c. + 85 (GX-0456). Colinas is the second style at Anc6n and is character- ized by zones of punctation outlined with incised lines. Presently, three phases are distinguished in the Colinas style. The decoration of the earliest phase is characterized by small punctations that are irregular in both size and shape; associated with this decoration are fragments with zones of small incised circles, open bowls, and neckless ollas with unthickened comma-shaped rims. In the second phase, the punctations are round and regular in both diameter and depth; the punctations are evenly spaced in the design panel and are somewhat larger than those of the preceding phase. Olla rims are usually un- thickened in this unit. The third phase of the Colinas style has the largest punctations, but they are irregular in form and depth like those of the earliest unit. This decorative pattern is found on open vessel shapes that are associated with neckless ollas having thickened comma- shaped rims. Occasionally, vessels with red-painted zones outlined with incised lines are found associated with this phase. Colinas pottery is found over a large area of the site, and the sequence outlined above is based on strati- graphic differences that were observed in several excava- tions. There was clear separation of the Colinas strata from each other and from the underlying deposits con- taining Florida pottery. Only one phase is presently distinguished in the Malec6n style which is found in a larger area near the upper edge of the site. It occurs in strata immediately overlying deposits containing Colinas pottery and below layers with Chavin-influenced pottery. Several open and closed vessel shapes of the Malec6n style have red- painted zones or designs on their exterior surfaces. These are usually outlined with incised lines. Malec6n pottery is distinguished from the Balta style by several new vessel categories, including bowls with pouring lips and neckless ollas with unthickened rims. Several lines of evidence suggest that the Malec6n style is at least partly con- temporary with the first impulse of Chavin influence along the Peruvian coast and that some of the new vessel forms and designs reflect this influence. Excavations made by students at the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos between 1959 and 1961 in the Malecon refuse deposits at Ancon led to the discovery of a few unique objects that were decorated with Chavin designs. The vast majority of the decorated sherds from these excavations, however, had typical Malec6n designs, and it was not clear what the precise associations of the few Chavin-decorated pieces were. The Peabody Museum Expedition found a small pendant, with a Chavin design, on a flexed male burial that was associated with Malec6n pottery and the remains of a small monkey. Another line of evidence is that a few Malec6n vessel shapes from one excavation are very similar to those that were found on the Paracas Peninsula in a site which contains Ocucaje 1 pottery. Data collected by Lumbreras and Amat at Chavin de Huantar and by Gary S. Vescelius in the Macara Basin in the upper part of the Callej6n de Huaylas suggest that red-zoned pottery may immediately precede vessels with Chavin designs. If this, in fact, is the situation, then the similarities of the Malec6n style with the red-zoned styles of the north highlands and the Ocucaje 1 style of the south coast suggest that it dates to the end of the Initial period and to Epoch 1 of the Early horizon. The Balta style which contains the first pottery with obvious Chavin-influenced designs at Anc6n is particu- larly abundant in stratified deposits located in the north- ern and eastern parts of the site. Balta pottery occurs in more than one stratigraphic unit in several excavations, and it seems likely that a detailed examination of the ceramics will lead to the definition of at least three or four phases of the style. The open bowls and bottles of this phase are made of a slightly lustrous fine ware that varies in color from dark brown to gray. The designs found on the exterior surfaces of bowls and bottles and on the inside of some bowls incorporate elements that occur in Chavin sculpture or that reflect local inter- pretations of what Chavin sculpture looked like. The designs are made with deep broad incisions and occa- sionally incorporate appliqu6 elements. Post-fired resin pigments - usually red and white - fill the incised out- lines of the design and occasionally the design panel itself. The mouth treatment on one of the designs found on a Balta vessel resembles that of the Chavin C style, which suggests that it may date to Epoch 3 or 4 of the Early horizon; this particular vessel does not occur in the earliest stratigraphic unit containing Balta pottery. The most recent of the Early horizon styles in the Anc6n shell mounds is Abtao. It was found in at least 10 excavations that were located in all parts of the site. The deposits containing Abtao potter) are thick and stratified and stylistic differences between the contents of the different stratigraphic units suggest that 8 to 10 phases will be defined, once the materials are studied in detail. The pottery of the Abtao style is generally redder in color than that of the Balta style. Chavin-influenced designs outlined with narrow incised lines continue in some of the stratigraphic units but not in others. These designs are usually found on the outside surfaces of bowls and jars and on the interiors of plates. Also included in the Abtao style are vessels with crosshatched bands on their outside surfaces and bottles with a variety of neck and lip forms. Apparently the Ancon shell mounds were abandoned toward the end of the Early horizon. On the Pampa de Anc6n near the air base, Junius B. Bird (American 423</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Museum of Natural History) found a small deposit of pottery which shares features with both the Abtao and Base Aerea styles and is probably intermediate between them. One of the members of the Peabody Museum Expe- dition, Eugene McDougle, began an intensive study of the Late horizon occupations in the Chill6n and Lurin valleys. He has already isolated the local Late horizon styles at the Pampa Santa Rosa site in the Chill6n Valley, as well as another stylistic unit which probably dates to the end of the Late Intermediate period. McDougle plans to undertake further excavations in the Lurin Valley in order to see what kinds of regional differences existed between the two valleys and at different elevations in the Lurin. These investigations will allow him to make some specific comments about the impact of the Inca conquest on the indigenous peoples of the coast and lower slopes of the Andes in central Peru. Lucille G. Lewis, another member of the Peabody Museum Expedition, undertook more extensive excava- tions at the early lithic site on Cerro Chivateros (PV46- 27). These yielded a larger sample of the Red Zone artifacts and chipping debris, as well as new information about the patterns in which the artifacts had been strewn on the surface of the workshop. CHILE. The Columbia University Archaeological Expe- dition to Chile, under the direction of Edward P. Lanning, carried out extensive archaeological reconnais- sance and excavations near Calama and Chuquicamata between September, 1967, and January, 1968. They suc- ceeded in elaborating the late glacial Talabre sequence and in locating sites with stemmed projectile points resembling those of Tulan and Tambillo, but typical of neither complex, which should date to post glacial times. These are followed in time by sites with foliate projectile points, like those of the Chiu Chiu complex, and by sites with small triangular points resembling the final preceramic and early ceramic points of southern Peru and northwestern Argentina. They also succeeded in locating several ceramic stage sites and can distinguish two styles. The earlier one is characterized by thick- rimmed bowls and incised decoration but does not resemble closely the pottery from San Pedro. Lasana, the later style, is associated with Inca and Colonial period pottery at a number of sites in the area. Julio Montane is currently excavating an early man site at Tagua Tagua south of Santiago, where there is a firm association of stone tools with the remains of mas- todon and horse. This is the third site in South America where firm associations between human remains and those of extinct mammals have been found. The others are Fell's and Palli Aike Caves. THOMAS C. PATTERSON LOWLAND SOUTH AMERICA BRAZIL. The "National Program of Archeological Research," a coordinated and systematic program co- sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution and the Brazil- ian Conselho Nacional de Pesquisas, began its third year of field work July 1, 1967. Ten Brazilian archaeologists representing an equivalent number of universities and museums had located, mapped, and sampled 568 sites by the end of the second year's survey. A volume contain- ing articles on the preliminary results obtained in nine areas during the first year has been published as Publi- cag6es Avulsas No. 6 by the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Belem. Another summarizing the second year is in preparation and will include the following regions: Rio Grande do Sul. Eurico Th. Miller (Museu Arqueo- logico de Rio Grande do Sul) recorded 83 sites along the left margin of the Rio Uruguay in the northwestern part of the state. These were classified into six archaeological phases, only one of which was represented in the north- eastern part of the state which was surveyed during the previous year. Of the new phases, two are preceramic. The earliest (Caaguagu phase) is related to the Alto- paranaense complex of Argentina, while the later one (Amandau phase) is characterized by stemmed and unstemmed projectile points and bola stones, as well as scrapers, choppers, perforators, etc. The earliest ceramic complex (Taquaragu phase) includes punctate, drag- and-jab, fingernail, and appliqu6 decoration, and it is closely related to the Taquara phase of the northeastern part of the state. The Irapua and Comandai phases belong to the Guarani tradition, in which corrugated and painted decoration predominate. The basin of the Rio Ijui, in the west-central part of the state, was surveyed by Jose Proenza Brochado (Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul), who recorded 38 sites representing one nonceramic and two ceramic phases. Of the latter, one (Ijui phase) is Guanani affiliated, and the other repre- sents the post-European mission period (Miss6es phase). Santa Catarina. During the 1966-67 season, Walter F. Piazza (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina) sur- veyed the right bank of the Rio Uruguay and its tribu- taries in the southwestern part of the state. Forty sites, representing two ceramic phases, were recorded. The earlier (Xaxim phase) is characterized by incised, punc- tate, fingernail, pinched, and painted decoration, while the later one includes the full range of typical Guarani ceramic traits. Parana. Igor Chmyz (Universidade Federal do Par- ana) investigated the Rio Ivai and its tributaries in the western part of the state. He located 39 sites, which have been assigned to five archaeological phases. The Ivai phase is preceramic, while the Vieira, Condor, Tamboara, and Calore phases are Guarani-related, the latter two showing evidence of European contact. Jose Wilson Rauth (Faculdade Estadual de Filosofia, Ciencias e Letras do Paranagua) conducted intensive excavations in the Sambaqui do Rio Sao Joao. Similarities in stratigraphy, refuse composition, and artifact typology affiliate this shell midden with the Sambaquis of Saquarema, Gomes, Macedo, and P6rto Mauricio in the same general region; these have been dated between 3,300 and 4,500 years ago. 424 [ VOL. 33, No. 3, 1968</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT RESEARCH Rio de Janeiro. Survey of a zone extending from the right bank of the lower Rio Paraiba by Ondemar Ferreira Dias Jr. (Divisao de Patrim6nio Hist6rico e Artistico do Estado da Guanabara) produced only 10 sites in spite of intensive search. These were classified into two ceramic phases: one (Itaocara phase) of Guarani affiliation, and the other (Mucuri phase) characterized by incised decoration. Bahia. Valentin Calderon (Universidade Federal da Bahia) investigated the Rio Corrente, a tributary of the Rio Sao Francisco and two areas in the Chapada Diaman- tina. Twenty-one pictograph locations and 34 ceramic sites were recorded, the latter representing two Guarani- related phases. The Itapicuru phase pottery includes both painted and plastic decoration, while that of the Coribe phase has plastic treatment only. A rockshelter near the left bank of the Rio Sao Francisco, in the State of Per- nambuco, was also excavated. The refuse deposit, a little more than a meter in depth, produced in the lower levels a large number of unifacial artifacts of distinctive types. BETTY J. MEGGERS 425</page></plain_text>
