<plain_text><page sequence="1">Simone Martini: ? Guido Riccio of Fogliano ?. The Townhall of Siena. "&lt;$otbic" forms of ancient oriental art Sienese painting of the XIII and XIV centuries, one of the highest expressions of the Gothic period, has often been compared with the prod? uctions of the Far East in the attempt to prove the existence of a substantial contribution, al? most of a real influence of Chinese art, a theory wholly unjustified from the historical point of view. No real contacts occurred between the Tuscan towns and the Far East, even if we have the surprise of finding in a fresco by Ambrogio Lorenzetti a perfect Mongol figure, complete in every detail. The figure merely suggests that the artist had the occasion of meeting one of the Mongolian embassies sent to the Papacy, and we may remember that one of these, sent to Cle? ment V by Oljaitu, was led by a Sienese, Tom maso llduci. On the other hand, if we consider the inner? most value of Sienese art, we find that it differs substantially from that of the Far East. In the Sienese com posit ions ? I speak of those of a sacred character ? the figures always retain a f?ll and profound humanity, even though elevated suddenly to the height of the heavens. The suf? fering and glorious motherhood of the Madonna is the clearest expression of this persistance of human values, even above metaphysical barriers. The figures of the Saints complete this vision. If we jeave aside these sacred compositions it will be sufficient to consider the ?Guido Riccio da Fogliano? fresco by Simone Martini to realize the predominance of man in the world. The ?condottiero?, wrapped up in his luxurious cloak adorned with black and gold lozenges, stands out before a deep blue sky against which the massive building of the castles associated with his glory are outlined. There are no other figures; only the points of the lances and pikes and the Sienese ensigns give the impression of the invisi? ble host. The anonymous mass of the men who 83</page><page sequence="2">were the makers of an ephemeral victory, fades out to remain concentrated in him. The chief is everything: the rest is but an armed will, a docile and ferocious instrument of a glory on which a great artist has conferred universal value. Nor do the symbolisms of ?the good and the bad Co vernemnt? appear different, for here too man dominates with his virtues and his faults. Nothing then in Sienese art suggests anything similar to that deep feeling for nature which makes the Chinese artist express with a few strokes the sadness of an autumn day or the anxiety which a spring morning brings with it. Later on, while following a long road, the Chinese artist succeeds in actually depicting the invisible, the wind, by means of the light effects of dust raised from the soil and of mist slowly dispersing. It is not, therefore, an anthropomorphic person? ification, as in other Oriental and Western arts, from the Kush?na coins to Romanesque sculpture, from Candhara basreliefs to the Qumtura paint? ings or the miniatures of Liberale da Verona, but a powerful living element, which fills all space with itself, and conditions its life. There is no substantial analogy between the two conceptions and the two worlds, nor can historical research find any direct contact. Wei ? stele ?, from the former Gualino collection.

Then the long diaphanous hands of the Sienese Madonnas, the gentle and austere expression of the almond-shaped eyes, the golden backgrounds which confer a fairy-like aspect and a luminous glory to the sacred scenes, because not unknown to Asiatic art, assume a different value, transcend? ing the search for hypothetical and in this case non-existent historical contacts, proving instead how the human spirit expresses everywhere and in similar manner its own supreme aspirations. The whole Chinese sculpture of the Wei period, like many speciments of Indian Gupta art, is evi? dence of the search for an ideal similar to that of Gothic art, through that lengthening of the human figure which is intended to express the inner spiritual life. It is a value similar to that which is indicated by the lengthening of the hands as these are also endowed with a hieratic 84</page><page sequence="3">character, and rendered diaphanous and almost ethereal in the Gupta bronzes and in European plastic art, in the Ajanta paintings and in Byzan tine Madonnas. The coincidence of forms, in these cases, indicates a full correspondence of a particular religious value, which is almost a yearn ing common to all humanity, of a primordial cha racter: the upward surge. It is in fact this same surge which inspires the.whole Gothic tendency in architecture, in the plastic arts and in paint ing. The thought of Asia, under the action of Buddhist humanism, renews this mystic urge, with which are associated other forms of thought, tending unconsciously to attenuate the differen ces from the religious thought of the West. In fact at the time of the greatest Mahayana splendour the conception of the absoluteness and rigidity of the Karmic law tends to break down. It is believed that the invocation of a name, the intensity of a prayer may bring about the miracle of destroying the effect of action. It is a hope rather than a conviction, which man cannot make up his mind to renounce: knowing his own weak ness, he shrinks from regarding moral law as hard and inflexible as a law of nature. Then, while the karmic law weakens and gives place to a compassionate soteriology, on the concept of the four horizontal Orients (the basic Manda lic scheme of all Asiatic mysticism), a vertical line rises. It is the symptom of a yearning toward the heights, which surges upwards from the depths of the soul and places in the heavens the seat of gr 00PIr 49t V 7de Pip 46, dp IN # Op,w . , S. . ov r "a, If, lv 3 WAI .1b so .

Perhaps Buddhism felt the effects of Zervanite ontology; perhaps Islamic monotheism also con? tributed to the assertion of ontologism as we are led to suspect by the legend, found in the Tibetan canon which puts the origin of the Kalacakra sys? tem in connexion with the Kla-Klos proceding from Me-Kha (Mecca). Without wishing to extend an analysis which, however detailed, would ever remain incomplete in this essay, it seems clear that Buddhist thought in its evolution passes through and gives life to particular phases not unknown to Christian thought, which yet remains as a whole deeply dif? ferent'. These phases are the simplest and most powerful aspect of religious feeling which, trans? lated into artistic language, produce formal ana? logies sometimes truly extraordinary. But these formal analogies are not always so detached from the historic base of the surround? ings which produce them. It is not in the least surprising if among the donors and other perso? nages represented in the frescoes of the caravan centres of Kashgaria we perceive outlines hav? ing a rythm similar to that of the procession of virgins in S. Apollinare Nuovo at Ravenna, or in other Byzantine figures; or if we find in Cen? tral Asia and in the Byzantine world sometimes the same undulation of bodies, almost like a dance movement, which is so particularly cons? picuous in the Ravenna processions. The ana? logy is here very subtle, but profound, and the connexion which Byzantium had with Central Asia and the powers connected with it, do not seem foreign to it; of this connexion we found evidence in fact in the coins of Valens found at Yotkan, in the missions of Zemarkhos, of Euthi kios, of Herodian, of Paul of Cilicia. Even in these cases, however, we find a correspondence of spiritual attitudes between the Buddhist East and the Christian world. We find in fact Byzan? tine and Gothic forms in the evolution of the art schools of North-Western India, in the sculptures of Afghanistan, in the Irano-Buddhist tendencies of Central Asia. Indeed we find the greatest analogies with European Gothic art in the Hadda stuccoes, analogies so striking as to seem almost incredible. Were it not for some secondary de? tails revealing different origins, we might often actually deceive ourselves as to the source of these stuccoes, which seem to have been con? ceived in the workshop of some Mediaeval artist in France or Germany. 86</page><page sequence="5">M^^^^^ ^1^^ ^^^^^ We cannot, however, in spite of the abundance of similarities, trace out any evolutionary con? nexion indicating a similar artistic development in Asia and in Europe and consequently a corres? ponding succession of spiritual phases. Formal coincidences appear here and there, only to va? nish at once, so that, side by side with almost pothic works, others have very clearly been in? fluenced by the classical world, others resemble Christian plastic art of the first centuries, others again exhibit completely different structural har? monies and conceptions. Formal coincidences oscillate from time to time, according fo the pre? dominance of this or that influence and there? fore according to the qualities of the technical methods employed, always, of course, subordi? nate to the spiritual values which find expres? sion through those methods. The Graeco-Roman substratum existing in North-Western India brings the artistic tendencies predominating in 87</page><page sequence="6">Stucco head (demons) with gothic character? istics. From J. J. Bar thoux ? Les Fouilles de Hadda ?. that area close to those of Western Europe, even if the classical elements are less rooted in India than in Europe. On the other hand even the Ira? nian contribution is common to the two worlds, although in different proportions, and this ex? plains the correspondence existing between the Iranian-Buddhist tendencies and certain aspects of Byzantine art. Finally some motifs of the Art of the Steppes form an Euro-Asiatic Koine of no small importance for the history of art, even if its origins are to be sought elsewhere than in the sedentary civilizations. With different intensity and a different mo? vement, {he same elements are found both in the art of Mediaeval Europe and im that which follows the expansion of Buddhist humanism. Indeed, for several centuries, one of the most important areas for this phenomenon, viz. Candh?ra, will develop, from the artistic point of view, in cor? relation with the classical Occident, because the art of Candh?ra follows the evolutionary curve of the classical world down to the Tetrarchy, while we may notice striking analogies, especially in the field of composition, between certain Can 88</page><page sequence="7">dharic basreliefs and others of the age of Cons tantine. To these analogies of influences and contribu? tions which operate by diverse ways also on the Western arts and which are instead the very es? sence of the Indo-Craeco-Iranian art from Can dh?ra to all Serindia, we may add a certain cor? respondence of historic situations since the mystic forms of Buddhist art flourish,after long periods of wars and invasions; in the same way as By? zantine hieraticism and Gothic surge arise from the ruin caused by the Barbarian invasions and agitated periods of strife and change. But here ends any possibility of finding identities of sur? rounding in the artistic currents of the West and those of a wide sector of Asia, that is to say the whole area of Indo-lranian interference, extend? ing along the caravan routes to the borders of China. As we perceive, nothing definite can ex? plain why the anonymous engraver of Hadda was able to create something similar to the ?Sourire de Reims? and why the eyes of the fine Bodhi sattva of Ajanta assume an expression not unk? nown to the Madonnas of Duccio. We know now that perhaps there were, between Central Asian oases of Turfan, of Qumtura or Qyzil and the Byzantine Empire, more or less indirect contacts; but it is always in the depths of the souls of the artists that we must seek the ultimate reason which created the astonishing resemblances be? tween the donors of Serindia and the processions of Virgins of Ravenna. We have the same spiri? tual attitude, the same religious yearning which enables the unknown Afghan artist to transform the classical elements in his possession to the point of anticipating by a thousand years the Gothic art of the West. For all this long series of analogies finds its origin in religious feeling, the same feeling which induces the Bizantine artist definitely to reject Hellenistic naturalism in order to seek an impres? sionism unknown to the Graeco-Roman world, and which brings the Gothic architect to seek the solution of difficult static problems, so that the cathedral, which the people under his guidance builds, should reveal the aspiration of aH to rise towards the heavens. It is this identity of aspirations which make possible the miracle of the creation of similar forms in far distant times and places. Even if we have only hints, although evident ones, even if there was an approximate sameness of technical methods, it still remains marvellous that above the barriers raised by space and man, and beyond time, human aspirations towards eternity should have found expression in similar ways in the field of art: that field which answers most deeply to the intimate essence of our thoughts.
