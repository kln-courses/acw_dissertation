<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS book to classify according to the usual rubrics, since it includes history, biblical criticism, legend, travel, adventure. The author made the journey from the Nile through the Sinai Peninsula to Transjordan, following the trail of the Exodus, "in the steps of Moses." He has obviously also read assiduously in preparation for this Odyssey. Into the story he has woven the account of his own pilgrimage and has drawn upon Philo, Josephus, and the Talmud, and upon his own superb imagination as well as upon his memory of much Jewish lore learned from his father, to produce a narrative fascinatingly interesting and eminently worth reading. In pursuing his investigation of the journey of Moses he determines at the outset not to attempt a "variorum journey" - "not, for instance, to go to any Mount Sinai on the further side of Akaba... seeing the traditional mountain has as much truth and poetry as we hoped for." Though the reader knows that the author is well acquainted with the find- ings of archaeology and modern biblical scholarship, he often finds these sources discounted as too sterile for the creation of a living tale; and it is re-creation, not mere research and discovery, that Golding undertakes and achieves. The Jewish Publication Society has done well to make available to American readers this author's own condensation of two earlier volumes on Moses, the Lawgiver and the Conqueror. JOHN W. FLIGHT. The Anti-Anthropomorphisms of the Greek Pentateuch, by Charles T. Fritsch. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1943, pp. VII+82, $2.00. Generally speaking, anthropomorphism is characteristic of a primitive age, while anti-anthropomorphism is peculiar to a late and sophisticated age. Hence the tendency to the latter is not confined to the Alexandrian version of the Pentateuch, but extends to all translations of the Bible, notably the Aramaic. One is inclined therefore to ascribe this tendency to anti-anthropo- morphism not alone to the influence of Greek philosophy or Philonic theos- ophy, as our author seems to think, but also, with Frankel and Freudenthal, to inner-Jewish influences. Anyone familiar with the post-biblical literature of the Tannaim and Amoraim is aware that not only Alexandrian, but also Palestinian and Babylonian Jewries were opposed to anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms in the Bible and endeavored to tone them down by various ways and means. The author, it is true, differentiates between the anti- 203</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE anthropomorphic tendency which began in the Old Testament and was further developed in Judaism, and that which is found in the Septuagint and Philo: the transcendent God of rabbinic theology, he claims, is at the same time a personal God, but the Absolute of Philo is a pure abstraction. How- ever, this differentiation, whether true or not, is only a matter of degree and does not affect the point at issue. The monograph before us is a detailed study of anti-anthropomorphisms in the Greek Pentateuch, a subject first dealt with by Z. Frankel in his Vor- studien zur Septuaginta and elsewhere. Our author sets out "to gather these instances from the Greek Pentateuch, to classify them in an orderly manner, and then to make comments on this material and draw definite conclusions." He is quite right that both anthropomorphisms and anti-anthropomorphisms are found in the Greek Pentateuch, as well as in the Hebrew Bible itself. Interesting is his statement that Genesis and Leviticus are singularly free from anti-anthropomorphisms in the Greek, whereas Exodus has the most examples of any book in the Pentateuch. This might point to different trans- lators of the individual books of the Pentateuch. Similarly interesting is the observation that the poetical passages contain more examples of this anti- anthropomorphic tendency than the prose sections, or that there are even some cases where the Septuagint is more anthropomorphic than the Hebrew. Evidently the translators were not consistent, nor were they guided by a definite principle. As to the numerous cases of anti-anthropomorphism listed in the book, not all of them can be accepted as such without demur. Thus it is hardly fair to assume with Siegfried that the rendering of ninn by riv vtr/'Xqv in Gen 22 2 implies the omission of the divine name r:, undoubtedly ,monn was con- sidered like n,ion (so written in the Samaritan Hebrew Pentateuch) and hence derived from the stem nn. The same holds true of r,'D in Ex 17 16 which the Septuagint construed as one word n'ID (covered) and derived from the stem ,n. By no means do these cases prove an attempt to omit the divine name. Again, aaXrX1roavvr for mi;y in Deut 23 14 (15) is hardly an anti-anthropo- morphism, since it is the common rendering throughout the Septuagint and also in the minor Greek versions for that Hebrew word. I even doubt the possibility of listing Deut 34 6 as an anti-anthropomorphism, for the Hebrew inN inp'1 is a common impersonal construction which may be understood either in the singular or plural (as in the Septuagint) and was misconstrued by some ancient versions and medieval commentators (such as Rashi 'nl33n ;n'pn; contrast however Ibn Ezra iwy ns nmp). Moreover, considering the fondness 204</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS of biblical Hebrew for active constructions, it is questionable whether a Greek passive verb for a Hebrew active verb of which God is the subject should be ascribed altogether to a tendency towards anti-anthropomorphism. After all in a non-literal translation it is entirely fair to render an active by a passive and vice versa. For the same reason, not too much should be made of the omission of the possessive pronoun "his" with reference to God (p 10, n. 6): indeed, the author himself admits that there are numerous passages in the Septuagint where the possessive suffix, referring to the deity, has been retained. It should be kept in mind that the Septuagint is by no means a strictly literal translation, such as Aquila's for instance. I have no doubt that a good many of the supposed anti-anthropomorphisms are due to an attempt to render the Hebrew into intelligible Greek. The author's judgment may be challenged also on other points. Thus I doubt that the phrase taXvv ifpaXtovwv represents two different transla- tions of the same Hebrew word np'rt (p. 15): it simply is a free rendering or rather interpretation (similarly Targum Yerushalmi ad loc. mrrnml yl-nn). Again, Geiger's thesis (Urschrift, p. 274) that in Lev 24 or was introduced as a surrogate for m;l by later hands cannot be set aside as easily as is done by our author (pp. 43 f.), since the fact remains that in biblical Hebrew ow does not occur elsewhere in this sense. Attention should be called also to some typographical errors, such as 'lyoD for iyDn on p. 31 above, ODnI'I for on,Si on p. 33 below, lpip for plD ibid., 1'n'r for l'srn on p. 34 below, ~ for [ =mrl] on p. 44 below, and so on. In spite of these strictures, however, the book is a praiseworthy attempt to exhaust the problem of anthropomorphism and anti-anthropomorphism in the Greek Pentateuch, and for that reason Septuagint scholars everywhere will be beholden to the author. The book is augmented by two appendices, the first showing that B or Vatican text of the Septuagint is more anti-anthropomorphic than the A or Alexandrian text, the second showing the relation in this respect of the minor Greek versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion to the Masoretic text and the Septuagint.
