To some observers, however, the popularity of kokusaika is a mixed blessing. Osaka University Professor Yamazaki Masakazu, for example, charges that his fellow intellectuals have "cloaked the idea of internationalization in a subtle aroma of romance. ... To them it has meant the importation of goods, ideas and tastes that, by virtue of their superficiality, held the promise of improvement without the threat of disturbing change."' To Yamazaki, this superficiality masks a deep ambiguity that undermines the movement as a whole.2 While it is true that the word kokusaika has been overused, Yamazaki's criticism overlooks one important field, namely, education, in which some Japanese, at least, have taken up the cause in earnest. Yamazaki also fails to see that the real significance of the internationalization movement lies in its very ambiguity. It is that condition that has created a discursive space in which intellectuals, politicians, education officials, school admin- istrators, teachers, and even students contest the meaning and goals of kokusaika. This article, which is based in part on personal observations and in- terviews conducted in Japan in 1989 and 1992, examines that contest by documenting their respective opinions and activities concerning the in- ternationalization of Japanese education. It finds that the movement has become enmeshed in an ideological and political struggle over the aims, content, and control of education. The outcome of that struggle will, in turn, determine whether the educational system adopts or avoids the kind of fundamental changes that are necessary in order for internationalization to proceed. An earlier version of this article was presented at the Midwest-Japan Seminar, March 9, 1991, at DePauw University. I gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Japan Council at the University of Pittsburgh, College of the Holy Cross, and the Northeast Asia Council of the Association for Asian Studies to conduct field research for this article in Japan in 1989 and 1992. I also wish to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on earlier drafts. 1 Yamazaki Masakazu, "Survival Tactics for a Non-Western Power," Japan Echo 13 (Autumn 1986): 56. 2 All Japanese names list the family name first.

Its broader implications are truly "international" in scale. First, it is representative of similar movements now taking place in other countries, including the United States. Faced with the inexorable globalization of economic life, politics, and culture during the 1980s, growing numbers of American educators, business leaders, and politicians, like their Japanese counterparts, have embraced internationalization as a national imperative. An examination of the contours of kokusaika in Japan may, therefore, be instructive for other societies facing the same challenge. Second, the current debate over kokusaika is likely to influence how the next generation of Japanese learn to view themselves and the rest of us, as well as how they perceive Japan's "proper role" in the global community of the twenty-first century. To the extent that these perceptions will serve as a basis for determining Japanese foreign policy (not to mention Japanese domestic policy toward foreigners and foreign entities inside Japan's own borders), kokusaika itself merits greater "international un- derstanding" among Japanese and non-Japanese alike. The examples discussed below suggest that the struggle to reform Japanese education, including the debate over internationalization, is taking place at various levels-national as well as local-and involves numerous actors- individual as well as institutional-within the Japanese educational system. Both the motives and the methods of these actors vary. Some, including the National Council on Educational Reform (Rinji Kyiiku Shingikai [hereafter, NCER]), which was established by the government in 1984 to study such issues as "coping with internationalization" (kokusaika e no tail),s along with critics of the NCER, debate each other from their own deeply entrenched ideological positions. Others, including some local ed- ucation officials, university administrators, and principals of standard academic high schools, are less concerned about ideology than about how to interpret and respond to the latest bureaucratic directives without undermining the status quo. Among those to whom they administer, like high school teachers and students caught in the grind of preparing for college entrance examinations, many are either ambivalent about the goals of the internationalization movement or skeptical about its prospects for success in the educational arena. In the short term, the greatest potential for genuine reform under the banner of kokusaika resides with their coun- terparts outside of the mainstream institutions, such as the faculty and 3 Seven other issues were examined by the NCER: (1) "basic requirements for an education relevant to the twenty-first century," (2) "organization and systematization of lifelong learning and correction of the adverse effects of undue emphasis on the educational background of individuals," (3) "enhancement of higher education and individualization of higher education institutions," (4) "enrichment and diversification of elementary and secondary education," (5) "improving the quality of teachers," (6) "coping with the information age," (7) "review of educational administration and finance." 124 May 1993</page><page sequence="3">EDUCATIONAL REFORM IN JAPAN students who are active in a small but growing number of experimental "international" high schools and programs. They, too, face a number of challenges, however, and the success of these pilot programs is by no means assured. Internationalization as Ideology As the phrase "coping with internationalization" suggests, the rec- ommendations of the NCER for internationalizing Japanese education were made in response to a process that was understood to be already well underway, at least in certain quarters of society. Through education this process could, it was hoped, not only be universalized but also brought under greater control and directed toward specific goals. Hence, the movement to internationalize Japanese education involves forming and disseminating an ideology that, if successful, will result in the identification of a commonly accepted set of values, goals, social practices, and social relations. But, as Michael Apple points out, the process of ideological production and reproduction that takes place through education does not go uncontested. The school is not merely an agent through which the ruling classes unilaterally impose a dominant ideology and thus maintain the state's hegemony over the governed. Rather, the school, like the state itself, is a site where different classes and interest groups regularly engage in ideological struggles over meaning, values, and principles. Dominant ideologies are thus products of compromise. "By integrating varied ideo- logical elements from differing and often contending groups around its [the state's] own unifying principles, consensus can be gained and the sense that practices based on these hegemonic principles actually help these contending groups can be maintained."4 Surveying the Japanese scene in the early 1980s, shortly before Prime Minister Nakasone established the NCER, Befu Harumi observed, "The process Japanese call internationalization (kokusaika) is in fact not one but numerous and varied. ... Since it is a popular term rather than a technical one, it never was properly 'introduced' with anything like a definition." Consequently, it and related terms like kokusaisei (internationality), kokusaikan (international sense), kokusaijin (internationalist), and kokusai kiryi! (inter- national exchange) have been used in a wide variety of contexts.5 Through his analysis of their usage in these contexts, Befu makes several observations that are pertinent to the movement to internationalize Japanese education. One is that kokusaika has come to stand for many of the processes formerly 4 Michael W. Apple, Education and Power (Boston: Ark Paperbacks, 1982, 1985), p. 30; see also pp. 12-29. 5 Befu Harumi, "The Internationalization of Japan and Bunkaron," in The Challenge of Japan's Internationalization: Organization and Culture, ed.

Comparative Education Review 125</page><page sequence="4">LINCICOME subsumed under the labels "Westernization" (sei-ka), "modernization" (kindaika), and "liberalization" (jiyiika). This suggests that, notwithstanding its reformist rhetoric, the internationalization movement may constitute less of a challenge to existing social attitudes, government policies, and practices than a reinforcement of them. A second is that while "noneconomic internationalization processes have their independent existence ... it is difficult to deny the relative primacy of economic internationalization." Third, he concludes that "while internationalization proceeds on all fronts, each process reinforcing and interacting with others, the very processes of internationalization which are supposedly making Japanese more cosmopolitan have the unexpected effect of making Japanese more nationalistic."''6 Ross Mouer and Sugimoto Yoshio concur that kokusaika may connote "the smooth promotion of Japan's national interests"; in particular, "the achievement of Japan's economic goals overseas without rocking the boat in international waters." Opposed to this, however, is a second, concurrent usage implying more idealistic goals, such as the quest for world peace and the resolution of global problems like hunger, disease, and environ- mental pollution: The ordinary citizen may not consciously distinguish clearly between these two usages of "internationalization" which imply very different goals. Yet the word seems to be manipulated as an ideological symbol by at least two groups in Japanese society. One is a committed elite with a solid grasp of the realpolitik and the realities of Western imperialism in Asia earlier this century. Its members generally accept the nation-state system and subscribe to the first set of goals mentioned above. The second group consists of those who are wary not so much of nationalism as of the present political arrangements and the present conservative regime in Japan .... To be sure, there is also a sizeable stratum of persons interested only in "getting along" and in promoting their own self-interest. They are fairly apathetic; indeed, they are even alienated by the constant efforts of the others to use the concept of "internationalism" as an ideological tool. ... If there is a key to how Japan will internationalize in the future, it may very well lie in our understanding of this stratum.' That the ideological struggle identified by Mouer and Sugimoto has spilled over into the movement to internationalize Japanese education trumpeted by Nakasone and his NCER is suggested by comparing the NCER's own statements on the issue with those by Morita Toshio and Horio Teruhisa, two of its most ardent critics. Echoing throughout the NCER's reports, published between 1985 and 1987, is the urgent warning 6 Ibid., p. 241. 7 Ross E.

To meet this challenge, education must prepare future generations of "cosmopolitan Japanese" (sekai no naka no Nihonjin) who can help Japan assume a role in the new world order commensurate with its standing at the forefront of the most advanced nations and make positive contributions not only in the economic arena, but in education, science, and culture as well.s The image of the "cosmopolitan Japanese" depicted in these reports offers an anthropomorphic portrait of the NCER's internationalist ideology. Not surprisingly, it encompasses the ability to communicate in one or more foreign languages, a thorough knowledge of foreign countries and cultures, a capacity to appreciate cultural differences, and an "international consciousness" (kokusaiteki ninshiki). These qualities alone are not enough, however. In order to meet the challenges and achieve the goals outlined above, two other sets of qualities, skills, and values are required. On the one hand, future generations should be encouraged to develop their individual character (kosei), creativity (sozosei), independence (jiyui), self- discipline ( jiritsu), and personal responsibility (jiko sekinin). To accomplish this, of course, the existing system ofJapanese education must be thoroughly reformed, which helps to explain the relationship between the issue of internationalizing education and the NCER's concurrent proposals to free the system from the grip of bureaucratic centralization, standardization, and credentialism.' On the other hand, in keeping with Nakasone's charge that they "contribute to the international community with a Japanese con- sciousness,"'0 tomorrow's cosmopolitan Japanese must also be imbued with a thorough knowledge of, and a deep respect for, Japanese tradition, culture, and society: In order for our country to continue living amid peace, international co- operation, and interdependent relations, it is necessary for the Japanese people to be sincerely trusted by the international community. To that end, firstly, the ability to assert the individual character (kosei) of Japanese society and culture within a broad international perspective, coupled with an ability to understand deeply the prominent individual character of many different cultures, is essential. Secondly, along with a love of country that comes with being Japanese (Nihonjin to shite, kuni wo aisuru kokoro wo motsu to tomo ni), it is necessary to stand on the principle of aiming to build human character not by judging things on the basis 8 Ky7iku kaikaku ni kansuru toshin (Report on educational reform) (Tokyo: Okurash- Insatsukyoku, 1988), pp. 64, 129. 9 Ibid., pp. 11-16, 129-38. "10 Quoted in Japanese Education Today (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Education, 1987), p. 64. Comparative Education Review 127</page><page sequence="6">LINCICOME of narrow national interests, but within a broad international, global, and humanistic (jinruiteki) perspective.1" The NCER attempts to defuse the potential contradiction between the qualities of individual character, creativity, and independence on the one hand, and the virtues of patriotism and respect for Japanese tradition and culture on the other, by expanding the meaning of individual character to refer not just to a person (kojin) but to a household (katei), a school, a region, an enterprise (kigy-i), a nation (kokka), a culture, and an era, all of which bear a relationship to one another.'2 Hence, notwithstanding its criticism of the uniform, conformist, and insular nature of Japanese culture, society, and education, the NCER's seemingly radical call to cultivate the individual character of tomorrow's cosmopolitan Japanese leaves no room for the development of an individual consciousness apart from a Japanese consciousness. The most virulent criticism of the NCER and its proposals, including its position on internationalization, has not come from cultural purists on the political right, as one might expect, but from intellectuals identifying themselves with the political left. In his 1988 book, Rinky-ishin to Nihonjin, Nihon bunkaron (The National Council on Educational Reform and Theories of the Japanese and Japanese Culture), Morita Toshio, former director of the Citizens Institute for Educational Research (Kokumin Ky-iiku Kenkyuijo) affiliated with the leftist Japan Teachers Union, insists that the NCER's proposals are really intended to rekindle Japanese militarism and im- perialism. He argues that, while professing support for American im- perialistic, hegemonic "Pax Americana" impulses as a member of the so- called G5 group of nations, the Japanese ruling class endures Japan bashing in order to pursue its own hidden ambition for "Pax Japonica" hegemony over the Asian and Pacific regions, involving sharp confrontations and contradictions with workers in Japan, Asian and Pacific countries, and throughout the world."' To counter this conspiracy, Morita vows to take a scientific approach to the realities of world history confronting Japan, and sternly criticize and overcome [the NCER's] proposals for educational reform based on theories of "Japanese culture" that serve the cause of militarism and imperialism, especially its Great Power style calls for "international communicative competence" and "development of human character within a global, humanistic perspective." In line with my stated understanding of the problem, my book attempts to reveal the reactionary character and true nature of the "Japanese culture, in- dividuality" theory, the theory of "developing self-consciousness as a Japanese " Kyikyu kaikaku ni kansuru toshin, pp. 64-65. 12 Ibid., p. 12.

On the contrary, they are calculated to expand the country's economic and political power in an international community that has become increasingly hostile to Japan. He concurs with Befu that the impetus for educational internationalization was a preexisting movement toward economic internationalization that commenced in the early 1980s and became a matter of official government policy with the publication of the Maekawa Report. Together with education, Japan's economic in- ternationalization is designed to assuage foreign resentment and preempt foreign retaliation. In this scheme, the educational reforms put forward by the NCER to imbue a new generation with the attributes of cosmo- politanism, while instilling them with a culturally conservative and highly nationalistic consciousness, are intended to serve two purposes: one directed toward diminishing the external threat posed by continued foreign hostility; the other toward preventing the internal threat posed by domestic class conflict. Thus trained and indoctrinated, this new generation would be called not only to regain the trust and confidence of the international community by demonstrating Japan's openness and sensitivity toward foreign peoples and cultures but also to actively propagate Japanese social values and even religious (Shinto) beliefs abroad, so as to command foreign respect for Japanese culture and traditions. At the same time, for the sake of the nation, they would be expected to endure quietly the hardships of increased taxes, lower wages, and higher unemployment that are likely to ensue in the wake of the accelerating pace of offshore manufacturing, employment of foreign labor, and other policies designed to internationalize the domestic economy.'5 Morita's analysis and criticism of the NCER's alleged hidden agenda for educational reform are seconded by another leftist intellectual, Tokyo University professor Horio Teruhisa. According to Horio: The members of this Council have sought to dramatically alter the meaning of "Japan's modernization," to shift the focus of attention from a program designed to help Japan "catch up with the West" to one which will make it possible for the nation to finally overcome and surpass the West. Shifting the focus of attention in this manner certainly serves to place even greater emphasis upon the cultivation of those elites who will be responsible for leading the Japanese into the forefront of the post-industrialized world, because it is only these elites, the argument goes, who will be able to manage society's needs for new and ever greater amounts of information. ... Thus it must be remembered that the various debates on school 14 Ibid., p. 13. 15 Ibid., pp. 18-107. Comparative Education Review 129</page><page sequence="8">LINCICOME reform which seek to "liberalize" or "diversify" education are in reality little more than attempts to streamline the cultivation of elites as the cornerstone of our nation's educational system.16 In the same vein, Horio dismisses the NCER's proposals to interna- tionalize education. He charges that "internationalization here means nothing other than Japan's ambition to rise to a position of singular importance and power in the twenty-first century." It amounts to "a new, but no less dangerous, form of Japanese imperialism than that which led to Japan's militaristic adventurism in the 1930s and 1940s."'17 This ideological struggle over the meaning, goals, and content of internationalization conforms to a disturbingly familiar pattern characteristic of postwar discourse on Japanese education, one that frequently pits representatives of the Japanese government-notably, the Ministry of Education and certain members of the ruling Liberal Democratic party- against leftist supporters of the Japan Teachers Union. Disturbing because, as Horio himself observes, "the extreme polarization" between their re- spective approaches to educational reform means that "the wish to reach a compromise is little more than a vain hope."18 This seemingly unbridgeable chasm was prominently reflected in personal interviews with Suzuki Isao, director of the government-supported National Institute for Educational Research (Kokuritsu Ky-iku Kenkyuijo) and Igasaki Akio, his counterpart at the aforementioned Citizens Institute for Educational Research. According to Suzuki, a primary goal of internationalizing education must be to recover Japanese identity and subjectivity (shutaisei) by freeing it from excessive foreign influence. Like the NCER, he used the phrase "cosmopolitan Japanese" (sekai no naka no Nihonjin) to describe a world in which Japan asserts its right to cultural coexistence, in place of its earlier drive to catch up with the West through imitation. He also cited the vast differences between Japanese and foreign cultures as the main obstacle to the internationalization of education. Ironically, however, his prescription for negotiating this hurdle calls for still further imitation. Specifically, these cosmopolitan Japanese must practice the direct approach in their own cross-cultural communications that is favored by foreigners,19 presumably in order to better represent and defend Japanese culture abroad. Igasaki professed support for the vigorous economic, cultural and scientific exchange that Japan has engaged in over the past decade.

He described it as economically inspired, Japan-centered (Nihon chuishinshugi), and more nationalistic (kokusuika) than internationalistic in its orientation. According to Igasaki, the main goal of internationalizing Japanese education should be to avoid a repetition of the human tragedy Japan inflicted on the world, and especially Asia, during World War II. Therefore, inter- nationalization must proceed by promoting peace, opposing the prolif- eration of nuclear weapons, supporting environmental issues, and con- tributing to the advancement of education in developing countries. Igasaki criticized the government and the Ministry of Education for paying only lip service to these concerns in their own pronouncements on interna- tionalization. At the same time, they push for more nationalistic (kokusuika) reforms, couched in new regulations requiring teachers and students to show greater respect to the Japanese emperor and the state by displaying the flag and singing the national anthem, Kimi ga yo, at commencement and graduation ceremonies.20 The one question that elicited at least partial agreement between Suzuki and Igasaki concerned the best way to promote the internation- alization of Japanese education. Consistent with the call to liberalize the school system, both men stated that the movement must be carried out at the grass-roots level, rather than bureaucratically orchestrated from the top down. Significantly, however, for Suzuki this meant working within the school system by enhancing the role of the school teacher, while for Igasaki it meant turning to nongovernmental organizations, in order to circumvent government interference and manipulation. Politics, Policy, and Practice While the outcome of this heated ideological struggle over the meaning of internationalization, Japanese culture, and Japanese consciousness is certain to have an impact on educational policy and practice, that impact is likely to be tempered both by practical considerations and by the struggle for control of the educational apparatus. On the one hand, notwithstanding Nakasone's extraordinary attempt to shield the NCER from the influence of entrenched interest groups,21 including the Ministry of Education and "20 Interview with Igasaki Akio, director, Citizens Institute for Educational Research, May 31, 1989. "21 In 1984, Nakasone carried out a highly publicized-and in retrospect, largely symbolic- maneuver that was nearly unprecedented in the postwar history of Japanese education. Determined to pursue his own agenda for educational reform in the face of anticipated resistance from inside and outside the government, Nakasone, for the first time since the Allied Occupation, secured parliamentary approval to establish the NCER under his direct control. Even this precaution was not enough to shield this initiative from periodic interference by the Japan Teachers Union, the Ministry of Education, and even certain politicians in Nakasone's own Liberal Democratic party, Comparative Education Review 131</page><page sequence="10">LINCICOME the Japan Teachers Union, it is the ministry that has inherited the re- sponsibility for implementing the NCER's proposals. Consequently, the fundamental contradiction between the ministry's mandate to reform the existing system and its vested interest in preserving its power over that system has manifested itself in nearly every arena and at every level. On the other hand, the movement to internationalize Japanese education is multifarious and has become entangled with a number of related social and educational issues. The NCER clearly recognized this dual dilemma when it warned that a mountain of deeply entrenched educational problems must be dealt with if Japanese society is to internationalize, yet the effort to cope with internationalization through education cannot progress without concurrent changes in Japanese society.22 What follows is a brief look at both the politics of educational reform and the major collateral issues affecting the campaign to internationalize Japanese education, together with a sampling of opinions from education officials, school administrators, teachers, and students. Among the proposals put forward by the NCER to encourage inter- nationalization through education was one to establish more study programs and support facilities for foreign students wishing to study in Japan at the postsecondary level. At the time, Nakasone himself announced an ambitious goal of increasing the number of foreign students in Japan from less than twenty thousand to one hundred thousand by the year 2000. The NCER's specific recommendations ranged from establishing short-term study courses and summer programs to forming local gov- ernment and volunteer agencies that would help foreign students get settled, arrange home stays, and provide information. While few of the university professors, administrators, local public officials, and represen- tatives of volunteer organizations I interviewed objected to these rec- ommendations, many were critical of the dearth of financial assistance from the central government required to make them a reality. Represen- tatives of private universities, in particular, complained that government subsidies were wholly inadequate to meet the comparatively high cost of educating foreign students and that the lion's share of the government's limited financial support for such items as new dormitories, advisory personnel, Japanese language instructors, and administrative overhead however. From the outset, disagreements arose over the composition of the NCER (which eventually included representatives from business and industry, organized labor, and all levels of the educational system); the issues it would investigate; and its recommendations for reform.

According to Walter Edwards, by promoting mutual exchange between Japan and other countries in advanced fields like education and research, the NCER effectively precludes less under- developed nations from participating. "The effect of the Council's report, despite its avowed intent, is to exclude those nations from consideration, thereby robbing its own proposal for a diverse international community of real meaning.

Igarashi contends that the government is using the internationalization movement to try to improve the reputation of national universities located in outlying regions of the country, by providing them funds to construct new international centers and establish related programs. Asonuma, in contrast, complains that Tokyo University receives a disproportionate share of all government funding for higher education. In any case, their main point is that private universities such as Ritsumeikan, which hosts more than 225 foreign-mainly Asian-students each year, and Rikky6 are not receiving a fair share of government financial support to internationalize their programs and campuses. 24 Interview with Nishizawa Yoshiyuki, director, Educational and Cultural Exchange Office, Science and International Affairs Bureau, Ministry of Education, May 26, 1989. 25 In 1990, the number of foreigners enrolled in Japanese colleges, universities, graduate schools, and vocational schools reached a record 41,347, representing an increase of 32.3 percent over the previous year. Much of this increase occurred in vocational programs in such fields as computer science, engineering, and applied technology: the number of foreign students in these programs grew by nearly 75 percent, from 7,197 in 1989 to 12,574 in 1990. Although more than 100 countries were represented, the vast majority (37,936) of foreign students in Japan during 1990 continued to come from Asia, including 43.7 percent from China, 19.5 percent from South Korea, and 15.7 percent from Taiwan. By contrast, only 2.9 percent came from the United States.

In many cases, the avowed purpose of broadening their students' perspectives on the world has had to compete with more crassly economic motives. Private institutions have seized on these programs as an attractive selling point to lure potential Japanese student applicants, whose projected demographic decline in the years ahead has intensified the competition among these schools for entrance exam fees and tuition revenue.2" Although Japanese universities are eager to retain as much autonomy over their overseas campuses as possible, the Ministry of Education has already formed a special investigative committee to review their operations and prepare overall administrative guidelines, ostensibly in order to avoid potential problems with local people and authorities.29 The NCER was silent about the politically volatile movement to establish branch campuses of American universities in Japan, which began to gather steam just as the NCER was disbanding. Curiously, the impetus for this movement came, not from professional educators, but from talks between Japanese and American politicians, who apparently took the view that American education was a marketable commodity which in some small, symbolic way might help redress the persistent trade imbalance. Their plan was to solicit interest among prospective American schools and local governments in Japan that would act as sponsors or partners in this enterprise. The response on both sides was overwhelming: 29 U.S. in- stitutions had established programs there by the beginning of 1991 (many within the preceding 18 months), seven more had plans in the works, and more than 130 others had conducted feasibility studies.30 Once again, however, the motives have been as much economic as educational, while the repercussions have been intensely political. For example, in Fukushima Prefecture more than four thousand residents of the city of Koriyama filed suit to suspend municipal funding for a branch campus of Texas 28 Interviews with Igarashi Akio and Asonuma Kazunari (see n. 23 above).

The same article states that about 30 Japanese schools have opened in Europe and the United States, and another 127 schools, totaling 10 percent of Japan's educational institutions, have expressed an interest in branching out overseas. so Marjorie Peace Lenn, vice president, Council on Postsecondary Accreditation, "Poorly Run American College Programs in Japan Threaten the Reputation of U.S. Higher Education," Chronicle of Higher Education 37, no. 24 (February 27, 1991): B1-B2.

Although the suit was rejected by the Fukushima District Court, at least one other is pending in an Osaka court.3 In other cases, these projects have rekindled latent tensions between local and national government officials in Japan concerning the issue of legal jurisdiction over these new entities.32 Even more ominous, however, was a series of allegations and reports by Japanese politicians, university officials, and the media that surfaced in 1990 challenging the quality of the educational programs being offered by these American branch campuses and affiliated schools. This is not to imply that the allegations have no basis in fact, as even American observers have recently admitted.33 But they have caused some American repre- sentatives of these schools to speculate whether they are part of a politically motivated campaign to discredit these programs and so provide an excuse for the Ministry of Education to exercise greater control over them.34 The NCER also addressed two closely related issues that predate the current internationalization movement by more than a decade: education for primary and secondary school students temporarily residing overseas (kaigai shijo ky-iiku), and for children returning to Japan following extended residence abroad (kikoku shijo ky-iiku).

"s The aforementioned meeting sponsored by the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation (n. 32 above) was devoted to this issue. In his keynote address, attorney Charles Fishman, who served as counsel for Temple University when it established the first American branch campus in Japan in 1982, cited three common problems that tend to threaten the quality of these American-sponsored programs. The first is startup funding, often provided by profit-minded Japanese investors, which typically puts pressure on the American institution to lower its admission standards in order to attract a sufficient number of tuition-paying students. The second is disagreement between the investors and the American university officials over who should exercise academic control over the program. The third is the difficulty that geographically isolated, rural branch campuses have had in recruiting Japanese students and faculty. He predicted that some of these programs will fall victim to financial scandal, others to their unattractive locations. See also Lenn. As another recent article indicates, this problem is not limited to ventures in Japan. See "As the Race to Internationalize U.S. Colleges Heats Up, Concern Rises over Programs' Quality and Standards," Chronicle of Higher Education (June 21, 1989). 34 In a private conversation during the aforementioned meeting (n. 32 above), the American president of one such institution operating in Tokyo stated that the ministry had recently begun to float the idea of subjecting American branch campuses to some sort of licensing procedure, in order to test official American reaction. He explained there are three different groups within the Japanese government who have an interest in this area, only one of which-composed of younger, more progressive bureaucrats-supports the American branch campus movement, and it is politically the weakest of the three. The others are made up of older, more conservative bureaucrats who are highly nationalistic, and elected politicians who are being pressured-and paid-by some of the less prestigious private colleges and universities to undercut the American programs, which compete directly with them for Japanese students. At the same meeting, Feldman (see n. 32 above) stated that another reason the ministry finds the American branch campus movement disconcerting is that it is introducing a decentralized model of educational administration that is at odds with the centralized Japanese system that it oversees. Comparative Education Review 135</page><page sequence="14">LINCICOME internationalization of Japanese education and society, the NCER argued that "Japanese returnees who have accumulated overseas experience should be regarded as a valuable asset (kichi na zaisan) to the future Japan." Needless to say, this statement implicitly criticized the alleged widespread social and educational discrimination directed against these children in Japan that has been discussed elsewhere.35 However, the NCER's stand on this problem and the accompanying proposals to combat it were not new. Rather, they were inspired by a report published in 1974 by the Central Council on Education (Chiuo Ky5iku Shingikai). Ironically, it was in 1975 that the Ministry of Education adopted the position that the primary goal of education for overseas and returning Japanese school- children should not be to cultivate an international consciousness but, rather, to assuage "the anxiety Japanese living abroad feel toward the education offered by their host countries that takes place in an environment completely different from Japan's, and their accompanying anxiety that the system for receiving these children upon their return [to Japan] is inadequate.""6 What this came to mean in practice, if not in principle, was an educational program designed to reinforce a Japanese consciousness among children overseas and to help returnees cope with the stigma of their foreign experience by removing all vestiges of abnormality and difference. As Befu explains: "To cope with this problem returnees must be 'de-internationalized.' They quickly learn to readjust and readapt to the Japanese scene. Conformity to Japanese norms is the major guiding principle in this coping process. For those who are responsible for facilitating this process, such as teachers, the task is frequently described as 'peeling off foreignness' (gaikoku hagashi), 'redyeing' (somenaoshi), or 'scrubbing off foreign experience with a brush. ,'37 To counter this tendency, Nakasone's NCER advocated (1) overseas education that would enable Japanese children to experience as much as possible the region where they live, while also paying close attention to their development as Japanese, to the circumstances prevailing in the region, and to the conditions awaiting them back in Japan and (2) prep- arations to reintegrate returning students into Japanese schools, including "5 In Japanese, see Kokusaikajidai no ky'iku: kikoku shijo ky'iku no kadai to tenbo- (Education in the age of internationalization: Themes and observations concerning the education of Japanese children returning from abroad) (Tokyo: Tokyo Gakugei Daigaku Kaigai Shijo Kyuiku Senti, 1986).

The NCER added that reforms should be instituted to make it possible for non-Japanese-speaking foreign children to enter Japanese schools.38 The ideological contradictions imbedded in the NCER's philosophy of internationalization, and the political contradictions inherent in the ministry's mandate to implement the NCER's recommendations, are no- where more apparent than here. Turning first to the reform of education for Japanese children abroad, that task is compounded by the diversity of institutions involved. Of the 41,155 school-age children living abroad in 1987, for example, only 39.9 percent (16,430) attended one of the some 82 full-time schools for Japanese (Nihonjin gakki) then in operation worldwide. These schools, for primary and middle school students, adhere to the same curriculum guidelines that the ministry prescribes for their domestic counterparts, although many of them also provide instruction in English or the local language, as well as in local geography and history. The Japanese government not only provides partial financial support to these schools but also staffs them with licensed teachers from Japan. Another 40.3 percent (16,582) of the children that year attended some 120 part-time schools for supplementary instruction (hoshjugykKo), which typically meet for 3 or 4 hours on Saturday or Sunday, where they receive instruction in Japanese and mathematics using the Japanese language as the medium of instruction. Since the Japanese government provides them no financial assistance and few licensed teachers, instruction is often con- ducted by members of the local Japanese community, such as housewives andJapanese university students studying abroad. Obviously, the Ministry of Education wields correspondingly less influence over these pupils, who attend local foreign schools or international schools the rest of the time. Moreover, another 19.8 percent (8,143) of the total did not attend either a full-time or a weekend school for Japanese that year.39 Faced with these practical limits to its influence among Japanese schoolchildren abroad, the ministry has attempted to enlist the help of parents by emphasizing the role of home education (katei ky-iiku) both for establishing their identity as Japanese and for shaping their view of the world beyond Japan. One primer on the subject, published by the 8 Kydiku kaikaku ni kansuru toshin (n. 8 above), pp. 130-31. 39 Kaigai chizaiin no shijo kydiku shiryo (Data on the education of children of overseas residents) (Tokyo: KyOikusha, 1987), pp. 9-10, 15. There has been relatively little change in the percentages of Japanese pupils attending (or not attending) each type of school, although the total number of attendees in each category has, of course, witnessed a steady increase, as more Japanese executives and professionals go abroad for extended periods. In 1975, for example, out of a total of 16,316 school-age pupils, 38.9 percent (6,229) were enrolled in 41 full-time schools for Japanese nationals, 33.5 percent (5,476) received supplementary instruction in 48 weekend schools, and 28.3 percent (4,611) attended neither type.

Beginning with the preface, and periodically throughout the text, parents are reminded of the "surroundings completely different from those in Japan" (kokunai to wa mattaku kotonaru kankyika de) in which their children must live and learn while abroad, and the heightened importance of home education in their development as Japanese, especially since the usual aids to the socialization process found in Japan-schools, hobbies, sports, games, extracurricular lessons (naraigoto), chores (otetsudai), teachers, friends, relatives, neighbors, and so forth- will not be available. At the same time, parents should be alert to the influence that the personal attitudes they display in daily life will exert on their children's "proper understanding of the host country and its people," and on their development as "international Japanese" (kokusaiteki Nihonjin).40 In order for its program of home education to achieve these aims, the ministry has assumed the task of educating the parents of Japanese children abroad about their roles. The same primer cautions the father not to neglect time with his family or to leave everything at home up to his wife. He is urged to see himself as the "captain" of the "ship" on which his family navigates the "wind and waves of foreign culture and society" and the source of the family's stability and courage (yliki) to deal with the uncertainties of life overseas. Furthermore, as the one experiencing the greatest interaction with the host society, the father is presumed to possess the most accurate information about, and clearest perspective on, the country and its culture. Therefore, he should act as a knowledge broker by selectively disseminating this information to his family and by persuading them to understand his way of thinking about things. The mother's job is to look after her family's health and to take a cheerful, wholesome approach to everything. The text cautions thatJapanese mothers living abroad are prone to react negatively to the host country and culture, which can adversely affect their children's perceptions, not to mention how the local people look upon them and their families.41 Judging from its primer on home education, and from its direct and indirect involvement in providing full-time and supplementary schooling- approximating the domestic curriculum-for the children of Japanese residents abroad, it is apparent that the ministry shares the NCER's view that internationalization must not be left to either the individual child or the child's family to undergo by themselves through their own accumulated experiences abroad. Instead, it is a process that must be mediated by the educational establishment in Japan, in accordance with the goals which 4o Kaigai seikatsu to katei ky iku, preface, pp. 11-12. 41 Ibid., pp. 17-20. 138 May 1993</page><page sequence="17">EDUCATIONAL REFORM IN JAPAN the establishment-not the individual child or the family-defines for it. Granted, those goals now include giving greater encouragement to overseas residents to interact with the local people, and to seek a better understanding of their culture and customs, than was true before the movement to internationalize education got underway. But when paired with the goal of preserving the child's Japanese identity within an environment uniformly described as "completely different" from Japan, the effect may be, as Befu observed earlier, to fan the embers of Japanese national consciousness rather than to ignite the flame of internationalism. This, in turn, has repercussions for the reform of education within Japan for children returning from abroad. In one sense, the Japanese school system appears to be showing a certain adaptability to the NCER's view that Japanese returnees constitute "a valuable asset to the future Japan." Educational programs designed for these children are no longer concerned solely with "deinternationalizing" them for reentry into the Japanese mainstream but have also begun to encourage them to preserve their foreign language skills and maintain their interest in other cultures and in international affairs. And yet, precisely because they are special programs, often housed in specially designated schools, they are still prone to function as incubators, albeit with contrasting results. Some of them tend to perpetuate the institutionalized segregation ofJapanese returnees from the educational mainstream. Others are more likely to make good on Horio's earlier warning, by grooming Japanese returnees for membership in a privileged class of "elites who will be responsible for leading the Japanese into the forefront of the post-industrialized world." This type of program is examined in Roger Goodman's recent study of Japanese returnee schoolchildren. Challenging the longstanding assumption that returnees are victims of social, educational, and occupational discrimination, Goodman explains how special provisions to facilitate the entry of returnees into Japanese universities, coupled with minimum hiring quotas for returnees set by some corporations, have made these children the envy of other students (and their parents).42 My own field observations suggest that the extent to which a particular school or program for returnee schoolchildren actually conforms to either one of these types is influenced by a number of variables. Those variables include the kind and degree of encouragement, cooperation, and support it receives from education officials, teachers union members, and parents; 42 Moreover, says R. Goodman, the singular success of this campaign on behalf of so small a minority of affected persons has no parallel in recent Japanese history: a fact he demonstrates by contrasting the rising fortunes of the returnee schoolchildren with the continuing plight of other well-known victims of discrimination in Japan, notably, the Korean, Ainu, burakumin, and Okinawan populations.

Comparative Education Review 139</page><page sequence="18">LINCICOME the size and depth of its prospective applicant pool; and its ability to compete for the best candidates within that pool. The existence of such variables suggests, in turn, that these programs for returnee schoolchildren can be redirected to serve as something other than incubators for the creation of a marginalized minority or, alternatively, of a privileged elite. A couple of examples drawn from my fieldwork will illustrate both the problems and the prospects facing these programs. Tokyo Metropolitan International High School (Tokyo Toritsu Kokusai Kotogakk6) is the site of one such program. Located near the Komaba campus of Tokyo University, it opened its doors in April 1989, a month before my first visit there. In many respects, this experimental school is a product of the movement to internationalize Japanese education set in motion by Nakasone's NCER. Its promotional literature even incorporates some of the phraseology found in the NCER's reports. One brochure, for example, lists five principles guiding the school's educational program: "(1) to understand that all nations and races of people in the world are interdependent and to develop a sense of mutual solidarity (rentaikan); (2) to understand, in addition to one's own national culture, history, and traditions, the culture, history, and traditions of other countries and races, and to assume an attitude of respect toward them; (3) to enrich foreign language education; (4) to foster the ability to communicate (komiyunikeshon noryoku); (5) to establish the individual and respect individual character (ko no kakuritsu to kosei no soncho-)." In the same vein, this brochure goes on to identify three educational goals: "(1) to expand individual character by nurturing a rich human nature (ningensei), thinking independently, and enriching creativity; (2) to understand Japanese culture and tradition along with different nations, races, and cultures and cultivate an attitude of respect toward them; (3) to discipline the mind and body and nurture persons who possess the will to conduct themselves positively in international society."'43 Furthermore, in line with the NCER's proposals, this school not only admitted 31 Japanese returnees in its first year (13 percent of the total school enrollment of 237 sophomores) but also accepted 15 foreign students (6.3 percent) resident in Tokyo.44 By 1992, these figures had climbed to 160 (21.6 percent of the total enrollment of 739 sophomores, juniors, "4 Tokyo Toritsu Kokusai K5'tgakk' no stito (Start of the Tokyo Municipal International High School) (Tokyo: Tokyo Toritsu Kokusa: Kotogakko, 1989), p. 6. Three years later, in another publication, these three educational goals were introduced by a new sentence defining the basic aim of the school as follows: "To nurture talented persons (jinzai) who possess a well-balanced international outlook, and who are trusted and respected by people around the world." See Gakk Yloran (Outline of the school) (Tokyo: Tokyo Toritsu Kokusai Kotogakk5, 1992), p. 6 (emphasis added). "4 Seventeen of the returnees were graduates of full-time Japanese schools overseas, while the other 14 attended local or international schools abroad. Returnees and foreign students alike must meet certain residence requirements in order to apply for admission. In addition, the school observes a strict ratio of nationalities in its selection of foreign students, presumably to ensure that no single 140 May 1993</page><page sequence="19">EDUCATIONAL REFORM IN JAPAN and seniors) and 43 (5.8 percent), respectively.45 Similar innovations mark the school curriculum. Along with the standard subjects considered nec- essary to prepare for admission to Japanese university programs in the humanities or natural sciences (Japanese language, mathematics, science, contemporary society, Japanese history, world history, comprehensive English), the school attempts to prepare its students for entry into inter- national society through required courses in comparative culture, inter- national relations, foreign affairs, information science, English compre- hension (eigo rikai), and English expression (eigo hyo-gen). In addition, there is an interesting mix of electives recommended for students who aspire to study at a foreign university or pursue a career in an international field: conversational English, Japanese culture, Japanese classics, more world history, and dramatic arts. In every respect, then, this program appears to be a clear response to the NCER's call to train a new generation of "cosmopolitan Japanese." Compared to pilot school programs in other parts of Japan espousing similar aims, Tokyo Metropolitan International High School clearly benefits from its location in one of the world's largest and most cosmopolitan centers. First, in such an environment the multifarious aims of kokusaika take on greater immediacy and urgency in the minds of those whose continued support is vital to the school's success, such as local elected officials, school officials, teachers, and parents. Second, the school's prospective applicant pool is enormous. This is due not only to the city's large and diverse student population, including a disproportionate number of Japanese returnee schoolchildren and for- eigners, but also to the fact that interested students from any school district in Metropolitan Tokyo may apply for admission.46 Third, this fact also helps to explain why the school enjoys a competitive advantage over most of its public-sector rivals in Tokyo in attracting top- ranking middle school graduates. In most Japanese cities, student scores on a single, standardized entrance exam are used to determine which particular institution in an informal, self-perpetuating hierarchy of public foreign country is over- or underrepresented. Enrollment increased during each of the first 3 years by adding a new sophomore class each year. See Tokyo Toritsu Kokusai K&amp;t5gakkS, Kokusai News, no. 2 (November 1988). "45 Gakk' Ymran (Outline of the school), pp. 26-28. Foreign students in 1992 represented some 15 different nations. The largest number hailed from South Korea (nine), the People's Republic of China (PRC; eight), Taiwan (six), and the United States (four). Others came from Brazil, Cambodia, North Korea, Ecuador, Hungary, Iran, Malaysia, Spain, the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, the Philippines, and Sweden. The publication does not state whether, and to what extent, the large contingents from Korea and the PRC include members of Japan's Korean and Chinese minorities, suggesting that the school does not differentiate between foreign and permanent residents, even though the latter, in all likelihood, were born and raised in Japan. 6 In 1992, the school even extended its reach beyond the boundaries of metropolitan Tokyo to enroll 23 students from the neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saitama. See Gakk5 Y~ran, p. 26. Comparative Education Review 141</page><page sequence="20">LINCICOME high schools a student may attend. In Tokyo, however, assigning a student to a particular public high school is largely a function of the school district in which he or she lives. The impetus behind this policy was probably an egalitarian impulse to dismantle Tokyo's own informal hierarchy of schools, while making a high school education-which is not compulsory in Japan- accessible to more students. Among parents, students, and even teachers, however, there is a widely shared view that the policy has actually undermined the quality of education offered in most of Tokyo's more than 230 public high schools. As a result of these circumstances, Tokyo Metropolitan International High School has managed to avoid the fate of most newly established public high schools in Japan, which are typically relegated to the bottom of the institutional hierarchy in their locality and assigned middle school graduates who earned the lowest test scores. Not only does its designation as a special "reception school" (ukeireko) for Japanese returnees from abroad give it a competitive advantage among that particular pool of applicants; according to Ogino Haruo, principal of the school at the time of my second visit in the summer of 1992, it also competes favorably for mainstream Japanese students who are attracted by its unusual curriculum in international studies and its superior facilities. (Only five public high schools in metropolitan Tokyo currently offer an international studies component.)47 While all of this may be good news for Tokyo Metropolitan International High School in its quest for legitimacy, it reinvokes the question of elitism posed by Horio and Goodman. According to Ogino, the school does not offer any undue advantages to Japanese returnee schoolchildren in its capacity as a "reception school." On the contrary, it is the mainstream Japanese students who gain the most from the opportunities the school affords them for classroom interaction with the returnees. Not only do they gain new insights about the world beyond Japan through the firsthand accounts of the returnees, Ogino believes that the returnees also exhibit other valuable traits that his mainstream students would do well to emulate. Not surprisingly, they are traits that conform closely to the NCER's portrait of the new generation "cosmopolitan Japanese," for example, individuality, creativity, and communicative competence.48 Yet, even if the school manages to avoid elitism within its own diverse student body, this does not insure that it will avoid nurturing a student body of elites. The real test is yet to come, namely, whether the school's pilot program in internationalization can be successfully transplanted to other public high schools. On this point, Ogino himself expressed skepticism since the success his school has enjoyed so far has been due largely to its "47 Interview with Ogino Haruo, principal, Tokyo Metropolitan International High School, July 8, 1992. 48 Ibid. 142 May 1993</page><page sequence="21">EDUCATIONAL REFORM IN JAPAN exceptional pool of human talent and experience (among students as well as teachers), together with its fine facilities and other material resources, which are in short supply elsewhere.49 Nor is there sufficient proof that Tokyo Metropolitan International High School has put the threat of marginalization firmly behind it. The special "international" designation affixed to the school, its students, and its course of study may yet serve to inhibit the reintegration of the Japanese returnees into the social and educational mainstream, just as it may inhibit the integration of an international dimension into the standard curriculum taught at other schools in Japan. While it is too soon to tell, there are a few signs to suggest that this kind of experiment in the internationalization of Japanese education has been marginalized both by the educational establishment and by the Japanese public, espcially among the consumers of secondary schooling, who see secondary education as an investment in-and an important determinant of-their children's future career prospects. First, it is significant that this ambitious program is housed in a completely new school, rather than integrated into one of Tokyo's existing academic high schools for college-bound students. Quite simply, inter- national studies still bears little or no relevance to the all-important task of preparing students for university entrance exams, and those schools with good reputations as college preparatory institutions are not inclined to risk that status for the sake of a new, untried, and, ultimately, nonessential program.50 This may help to explain why over 72 percent of the school's first applicants, and over 63 percent of its first entering class in 1989 were female since families still give preference to male offspring when allocating resources for education. Three years later, that trend was even more pronounced, with the 1992 entering class composed of 179 females (76.8 percent) versus 54 males (23.2 percent).51 To learn whether the movement to internationalize Japanese education is truly national in scope or limited to cosmopolitan centers like Tokyo, and to test the hypothesis that international education is still marginalized 49 Ibid. "50 In this context, Wray notes the probable effect that a pair of recent curriculum reform proposals would have on the effort to internationalize high school education: "Although a national curriculum committee succeeded in making world history a required secondary subject in 1992 to achieve greater internationalism, their concomitant proposals to abolish gendai shakai [contemporary society] as a required high school social studies course neutralized this reform. Since the latter course is tested in university entrance examinations and allows teachers more flexibility in content and methodology, its retention is important for producing international Japanese" (Wray, p. 468). 51 Gakki' YJran, pp. 2-3. As evidence of this tendency, Wray points out that females not only attend 4-year colleges in vastly smaller numbers than males, but they also tend to avoid disciplines traditionally dominated by males, such as sciences, law, and engineering. See Wray, p. 454. There may be other reasons for this tendency, as well, including the widely held belief that females are better at learning English and other foreign languages than males and that women in Japan will find better career opportunities in an international field or as employees of foreign companies. Whether true or not, these perceptions serve to reinforce prevailing gender stereotypes vis-a-vis international studies. Comparative Education Review 143</page><page sequence="22">LINCICOME under the current system, I also visited several schools in Kagoshima Prefecture during the summer of 1989, where I had previously worked for 2 years (1976-78) as an employee of the Prefectural Board of Education. Kagoshima has its own version of the Tokyo Metropolitan International High School program that is offered at Kagoshima East High School (Kagoshima Higashi Kotogakk6), a prefectural institution. East High School is not a new school, yet its selection as the site for the prefecture's experiment in international education may have been prompted by similar consid- erations. Historically, the school has borne the stigma of being primarily an agricultural and vocational school, rather than a competitive college preparatory school. As the principal candidly admitted, East High School was chosen for the prefecture's international studies program because the better, academic high schools rejected it as irrelevant to their mission.52 One result is that international studies has not been integrated into the general curriculum at East High School. Rather, from the outset it has been conceptualized and institutionalized as a quasi-vocational "international studies course" (kokusai kyiiyika). Even the promotional literature the school uses to attract prospective students into the program plays on this theme, in one case, by listing a variety of career opportunities open to its graduates. And like Tokyo Metropolitan International High School, the program at East High School is largely populated by female students. Of the 365 students who enrolled in the program during its first 4 years of operation (1986-87 to 1989-90), more than 75 percent (276) were female. Most students, male and female, enter hoping that it will lead to postsecondary study in either a 4-year or, more commonly (for women), a 2-year institution. Only a minority plan to seek employment immediately after graduation. In reality, however, less than half (47.3 percent) of the college aspirants in the first graduating class actually passed the entrance examinations for a 2- or 4-year college. None of them were national universities or other highly ranked institutions; the overwhelming majority were private, mu- nicipal, or prefectural institutions in Kagoshima and other parts of Kyushu.53 There is a tragic irony in all this, since the students I interviewed in the international studies program at East High School-which claims to be one of the first such programs established in Japan-did exhibit the "individual character," the capacity for critical thought and reflection, and the international consciousness (although not necessarily the Japanese international consciousness) that the NCER extolled in its reports. Thanks to an ambitious schedule of activities that includes English language study with native speakers, Chinese language study, frequent classroom pre- sentations by foreign visitors, and trips abroad (to the United States and "52 Interview with Matsumura Toshiyuki, principal, East High School, June 7, 1989. 5' Kokusai kyy-yka no shiry5 (Data on the international course of study) (East High School, 1989, unpublished booklet). 144 May 1993</page><page sequence="23">EDUCATIONAL REFORM IN JAPAN the People's Republic of China), these students impressed me as the most broadminded, thoughtful, knowledgeable, and socially concerned that I encountered during my field research. And yet, under the existing ed- ucational system, few, if any, of the graduates of this program can realistically aspire to influential positions in government, academia, journalism, or other professions where they can meaningfully employ their knowledge and talents. What, then, of the students who, under the current school system, have been favored with the prospect of a successful career in one of these fields? To find out, I visited Tsurumaru High School, Kagoshima Pre- fecture's most prestigious, public college-preparatory school. With a national reputation for placing its graduates in some of Japan's top-ranking national and private universities, both the teachers and students at Tsurumaru approach the business of entrance-exam preparation with characteristic determination. During interviews with a number of them, their most common refrain was that while they personally believe it is necessary to internationalize Japanese society and education, under the present system, in a school like Tsurumaru, it is impossible to do much about it.54 Clearly, these ambitious representatives of Japan's future elite are bright, articulate, and thoughtful. However, based on their own assessments of the rigorous Tsurumaru curriculum, the observer is forced to wonder whether they are being adequately prepared to "cope with internationalization." Thus, in the final analysis, the single biggest obstacle to the interna- tionalization of Japanese education may be the highly competitive entrance exams. They influence not only the content of the courses of study for primary, middle, and high schools that are officially sanctioned by the Ministry of Education. In addition, they influence the attitudes of students, teachers, and parents toward what is learned and for what ends. In March 1989, some 18 months after the NCER disbanded, the ministry finally took a step in this direction when it published revised courses of study for precollege education. Since they did not begin to take effect until April 1990, it is too soon to gauge their full impact. However, a cursory examination of the K-t-gakk-5 gakushu shido- y-ory-o (Guidelines for the high school course of study), for example, found no less than six different high school subjects containing references to an international dimension. They ranged from obvious candidates like geography, history (both Japanese history and world history), contemporary society, and political economy (seiji, keizai), to less likely ones such as ethics and even Japanese language. 54 Interviews with five teachers and eight students, Tsurumaru High School, June 10, 1989. In spite of these shortcomings, none of the interviewees advocated drastic changes in the current educational system; indeed, one teacher warned that it would lead to confusion. Consequently, as one student explained, the task of internationalizing Japanese society will probably have to be carried out by the universities. Comparative Education Review 145</page><page sequence="24">LINCICOME The opening section of this text, "General Policy for the Organization of the Curriculum," is a model of ideological compromise that reads as though it were deliberately crafted to silence the charges of conservatism and nationalism that critics like Morita and Horio had leveled against the NCER's proposals for reform. Still, the NCER's imprint is unmistakable. In broad terms, it states that, in addition to providing instruction in basic subjects, school education must foster the desire (or will) to learn and the capacity to "cope independently with social change," as well as "enliven the individual character" of each pupil. Special mention is made of the role of moral education in guiding pupils toward an awareness of themselves as members of the state (kokka) and society. In accordance with the spirit of the Fundamental Education Law, teachers are instructed to cultivate a moral foundation to enliven a spirit of respect for man and reverence for life, contribute to the creation of a culture rich in individual character, develop a democratic society and state, and "foster Japanese who can independently contribute to a peaceful international society."55 Conspic- uously absent from this statement of general policy, however, are the NCER's inflammatory references to the uniqueness of Japanese culture, or its appeal to instill in tomorrow's cosmopolitan Japanese a thorough knowledge of, and respect for, Japanese tradition. Yet, it is these very themes that constitute the basic paradigm for the text's treatment of internationalization in subsequent chapters, each of which is devoted to explicating specific subjects in the curriculum. Framed in language that could only have been inspired by the NCER's reports, this paradigm of kokusaika posits the cultivation of a Japanese consciousness, rooted in respect for Japanese culture and tradition, as a prerequisite for pupils' development as internationalists. Consistent with this pattern is the advice to Japanese language teachers to select teaching materials that will "deepen [pupils'] interest in, and understanding of, our nation's culture and traditions, and will foster an attitude of respect toward them," along with materials that will "deepen international understanding from a broad perspective, awaken them to their identity as Japanese, and heighten their spirit of international cooperation.""56 In like manner, Japanese history teachers are informed that their goals should be "to secure [pupils'] overall understanding of the evolution of our nation's history from a global perspective and, by deepening their awareness of the special characteristics of our nation's culture and traditions, to increase their ability to think in historical terms and cultivate both their identity as Japanese people (kokumin) and their temperament as Japanese living in international society."57 Ge- 5 MombushU, KUtogakkU gakushu shido yory (Guidelines for the high school course of study) (Tokyo: OkurashU Insatsukyoku, 1989), p. 1. 6 Ibid., p. 13. 57 Ibid., p. 31. 146 May 1993</page><page sequence="25">EDUCATIONAL REFORM IN JAPAN ography teachers are reminded to cover "the world andJapan" by "getting [pupils] to understand Japan's entirely special characteristics and to consider Japan's position and role in international society."58 Ethics teachers are advised to treat the issue of "internationalization and Japanese self-aware- ness" (kokusaika to Nihonjin to shite no jikaku) in the following manner: Get [pupils] to understand the special characteristics of Japanese thought and culture, and deepen their consideration about how to behave and to live as independent Japanese in international society. (a) Japan's Climate (fido) and Japanese People's Way of Thinking Have [pupils] consider the connection between Japan's climate and the Japanese people's view of man, nature, and religion. (b) Receptivity to Imported Ideas and Japanese Tradition Have [pupils] consider the Japanese tradition of embracing Buddhism, Confucianism, Western ideas and culture and the evolution of original thought. (c) Cosmopolitan Japanese Have [pupils] understand the establishment of human welfare and in- ternational peace and think about how to live and behave asJapanese in inter- national society.59 As might be expected, these new guidelines, like the reports of the NCER that inspired them, have already attracted a good deal of criticism from left-leaning intellectuals, journalists, and educators. That fact, however, underscores a point that will weigh heavily in determining the ultimate success or failure of the current campaign to internationalize Japanese education, namely, the extent to which the discourse on kokusaika remains inclusive rather than exclusive. The biggest blow to the progress of this movement is likely to occur if, and when, any one party to that discourse manages to control the discursive process itself and forecloses the possibility of further interpretation by dictating the parameters of kokusaika. That is precisely how these critics view the ministry's publication of the new curriculum guidelines and its supervision over the writing and publication of new textbooks based on those guidelines. Fortunately, whatever the real motives behind these maneuvers by the ministry, their effect, in practice, has been to stimulate rather than stifle debate over the issue. Witness, for example, the debut of newly approved civics textbooks that were prepared under the new guidelines for introduction into Japanese middle schools in 1993. Front-page articles in all of the major newspapers headlined the fact that, at ministry insistence, the new textbooks "contain positive descriptions of the right to national defense as well as the purpose and duties of the Self-Defense Forces," alluding once again to the issue of the constitutionality of the Self-Defense Forces. At the same time, the media, which has long criticized existing 58 Ibid., p. 40. 59 Ibid., p. 47. Comparative Education Review 147</page><page sequence="26">LINCICOME textbooks for their sketchy accounts of Japanese atrocities committed in Asia during World War II, was forced to acknowledge that the newly approved texts "contain more detailed descriptions of Japan's forced an- nexation of the Korean Peninsula and forced labor that the Japanese military imposed on Koreans and Chinese." At least one newspaper also noted that seven publishers, "heeding the views of the ministry after the screening of their draft history textbooks," expanded their descriptions of the modern history of Japan's Asian neighbors.60 Moreover, if the activities of the faculty and administration at the Tokyo Metropolitan International High School are any indication, neither the ministry's new curriculum guidelines nor its new crop of textbooks are likely to be adopted either passively or exclusively. Citing the dearth of appropriate instructional materials and methods as the single biggest problem facing the school, the principal described how administrators and faculty there have taken it on themselves to fill this void."6 The Burden of History For proponents as well as critics of the government-orchestrated movement to reform Japanese education, history has been an important ally. Needless to say, however, their interpretations of the historical record, and the lessons they derive from it, differ considerably. The NCER described its mission as nothing less than completing the third great educational reform in modern Japanese history that was begun by the Central Council on Education in 1974. According to this account, the first reform was launched in 1872 on the heels of the Meiji Restoration, with the promulgation of the nation's first universal, compulsory education law. The resulting educational system, which survived until the end of World War II, was designed to serve two basic goals, summed up in a slogan popularized during the early Meiji period: "Enrich the country, strengthen the army" (fukoku ky'hei). This demanded a concerted program of Westernization, modernization, and industrialization to catch up with the West. In view of the widespread domestic poverty and the ominous threat of foreign encroachment on Japanese sovereignty that existed at the time, it was not hard to rally support for these goals from all segments of society. The NCER found evidence of both continuity and discontinuity between the prewar and postwar goals of Japanese education: continuity with the goal to "enrich " "Textbooks Totally Revised to Reflect Changing World," Daily Yomiuri (July 1, 1992). 61 Interview with Ogino Haruo (note 47 above). Accounts of their efforts and the problems they encountered may be found in the following school publications: Kokusai gakka no ky'zai kaihatsu (Instructional materials development for the international studies course), no. 2 (March 1991) and no. 3 (March 1992); and Tokyo Toritsu K't'gakk' kenkyUi kiy' (Tokyo Metropolitan International High School research bulletin) (March 1991). 148 May 1993</page><page sequence="27">EDUCATIONAL REFORM IN JAPAN the country," which resurfaced during the postwar "era of high economic growth" (do keizai seichijidai); discontinuity with regard to the militaristic and ultranationalistic goal to "strengthen the army," which was unequivocally renounced following the disastrous Second World War.62 The second major reform of education, according to the NCER, com- menced during the Allied Occupation, which strove to remove all vestiges of the militaristic and ultranationalistic education that had led the nation to war and to replace it with education that would build a nation of peace and culture (heiwa kokka ya bunka kokka) dedicated to the realization of democracy, freedom, equality, and the perfection of human character (jinkaku no kansei). During this period, education was opened up to the masses and expanded in response to the demands for high economic growth. Eventually, it helped Japan achieve its longstanding goals of catching up with the modernized West and enriching the nation, as well as the people. But by the early 1970s, the costs of its success were also apparent: not only in the form of problems like industrial pollution, but also in a loss of respect for humanity and nature brought about by rampant materialism, and aggravated by an educational system that emphasized the dissemination of knowledge to the neglect of spiritual development and uniformity to the neglect of individual character. It was these problems, coupled with the expectation that Japan would play a leading role in an increasingly interdependent international community, that the Central Council on Education sought to address by instituting the nation's third great educational reform. Although the Central Council's effort was un- successful, it has served as both an inspiration and a guide for the work of the NCER.63 This interpretation of the historical context and significance of the current educational reform movement has achieved orthodox status, at least among the education officials I interviewed.64 As already noted, however, critics like Morita and Horio view the NCER's work as an attempt to revive the goals of prewar education. Morita, in particular, devotes considerable space in his book to clarifying this link. At several points, for example, he juxtaposes passages from prewar government reports alluding to the militaristic and nationalistic goals of education with those from the NCER's reports, from speeches by Nakasone and his advisors, and from other sources to demonstrate their conceptual similarities. In addition, he explores a perceived conceptual link between the prewar "Kyoto School" (Kyoto gakuha) of philosophers, famous for their roundtable discussions on "overcoming modernity" (kindai no chikoku), and a "New Kyoto School" of postwar conservative academics and business leaders. 62 Ky5iku kaikaku ni kansuru toshin (n. 8 above), pp. 45-46. 63 Ibid., pp. 7-16, 46-48. 64 Interviews with Suzuki Isao and Nishizawa Yoshiyuki (nn. 19 and 24 above). Comparative Education Review 149</page><page sequence="28">LINCICOME The latter, according to Morita, formed the core of Nakasone's so-called brain trust, as well as his NCER. Morita contends that, like its predecessor, the New Kyoto School is determined to preserve and glorify the putatively unique, unchanging spiritual and social values that constitute the essence of Japanese identity. In this way, as Nakasone observed in his opening speech to the NCER, the people can contribute to international society, "with a Japanese consciousness," that is to say, without losing their sense of Japanese identity and loyalty to the nation.65 These conflicting interpretations of the modern history of Japan's internationalization and the historical significance of the current move- ment to internationalize Japanese education are, of course, little more than extensions of the ideological struggle examined earlier. The danger is that the real lesson of that history may be lost amid this struggle, in which history itself has become ideologized. For what the historical record demonstrates is that this very debate over the current reform movement, including the internationalization of education, is not new to modern Japan.66 Perhaps the clearest precedent is to be found in the debate over "international education" (kokusai ky-iku) that took place within the context of Japan's so-called new education (shin ky-iku) or "liberal education" (jiyl ky-Iiku) movement (ca. 1918-30). Leaders of this prewar movement, like their counterparts today, concluded that the bureaucratic, centralized, and standardized nature of the school system had outlived its original purpose. In the words of the educational historian Ishizuki Minoru, World War I demonstrated that economic and military power-fukoku kyihei-were no longer adequate to maintain Japan's position in the emerging "age of the battle over peace and competitive coexistence" (heiwa no tatakai, kyosoteki ky-oson nojidai). The liberal reformers thus set out to institute educational and social reforms compatible with a new but, as yet, undefined role for Japan in the post-World War I era of liberalism and internationalism.67 However, the resulting relationship between liberal education and international education during that period was subject to a range of possible interpretations equally broad and complex as the one characterizing the current reform movement. The crux of the problem remains how to accommodate national goals to international ones, and how to accommodate "6 Morita, Rinky6shin to Nihonjin, Nihon bunkaron (n. 13 above), pp. 54-68.

The events of the 1930s and 1940s attest to the ultimate failure of that first attempt to either liberalize or internationalize Japanese education and society. Therein lies the real significance of modern Japanese history for the present reform movement. Conclusion Two major factors have hampered efforts on both the national and local levels in Japan to institute concrete educational reforms intended to further the process of internationalization. One factor is the highly politicized nature of the debate over the meaning and purpose of inter- nationalization. But as vexing as this debate has been, if one accepts the premise that open discussion and debate are vital prerequisites to effective reform, then there is still reason to believe that the current movement to internationalize Japanese education is far from over. Indeed, the rapid pace of globalization and accompanying demands by other nations that Japan assume a leadership role commensurate with its position in the international economy, coupled with the growing number of Japanese citizens whose own views of Japan and the world have broadened as a result of extended residence abroad, suggests that the pressures for such reform will have to be addressed. The second factor, while clearly related to the first, is more insidious. It has to do with the nature of the educational system itself. That is, the very possibility of continuing and expanding public debate over the means and the ends of internationalization is threatened by a system that dis- courages an open, "democratic" approach to educational reform. While neither Nakasone nor his NCER sought to open up that debate to include their critics, both were correct in concluding that in order for fundamental curricular reforms like internationalization to succeed, the system itself must be "liberalized" to free it from excessive bureaucratic centralization and standardization, not to mention officially sanctioned credentialism. Hence, the ongoing struggle to determine the direction, goals, and policies of internationalization in the field of Japanese education is inextricably linked to a larger struggle for control of the educational system itself. And as with other educational reform movements in Japan, past and present, the fate of the former will be determined largely by the outcome of the latter.
