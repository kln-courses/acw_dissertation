ABSTRACT A vehicle may be loaded in varying configurations that affect its mass properties during normal use. These properties include total mass, center-of-gravity (Cg) location, and moments of inertia. The ranges of these parameters, which are determined by the varied load configurations, define the vehicle's mass property envelopes. These envelopes are useful for evaluating the effect of any load configuration relative to vehicle performance/design specifications. Mass property envelopes provide a clear visual representation of a range of key parameters that significantly affect motor vehicle control. Examples are provided in this paper that illustrate the usefulness of the vehicle mass property envelopes. INTRODUCTION Vehicle Cg location, mass, and mass moments of inertia are vehicle mass properties. Changes in a vehicle's mass properties, while by no means the only factor, produce first order effects of handling, controllability, and roll stability.111 Vehicle mass properties are affected by vehicle load. When considering a range of loads, one can determine a range of vehicle properties that describes an envelope of motor vehicle mass properties. This approach provides a means of exploring vehicle properties beyond the usual method of assessing vehicles based on capacity and single point vehicle parametrics. Mass property envelopes are developed consistent with vehicle "design load weight"121 and maximum loading recommendations of the vehicle manufacturer as described in the vehicle Owner's Manual. The vehicle loads associated with these assumptions are useful, but overall provide an incomplete description of a vehicle's expected usage. "Design load weight," for example, calls for 68 kilogram occupants, but occupant restraint systems are designed to accommodate a range of occupants weighing significantly less and significantly more. Consideration of mass or inertial property envelopes when testing or designing motor vehicles or motor vehicle equipment, provides insight into how a specific vehicle can be expected to behave over its range of loading. This may be of particular concern for vehicles that have a large load carrying capacity or special purposes, such as sports utility vehicles, vans, and trucks. Additionally, the outcome from such an analysis can be used in conjunction with a computer model to study vehicle stability. METHOD The various mass property envelopes require the acquisition of the vehicle parameters listed in Table 1 . Any number of methods could be used to determine these parameters. The basic vehicle dimensions can be 1918</page><page sequence="2">Table 1: Required Vehicle Parameters for Mass Property Mass Vehicle Parameter 1. Track width and wheelbase 2. Empty mass 3.

Cg location, yaw and roll mass moment of inertia of loads to be considered in analysis including occupants, cargo, etc. I measured directly or obtained from a variety of sources. These sources include Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Specifications, Automotive News Market Data Issues, and numerous other vehicle specification documents.121 Since the published curb weight may be difficult to replicate in any particular vehicle, the "empty" configuration weight is measured. The "empty" configuration weight shall be defined as curb weight with the vehicle's optional equipment. SAE Recommended Practice "Motor Vehicle Dimension - J1100" defines curb weight as a vehicle with standard equipment only and full of operating fluids. Accurate scale systems with the capability of measuring mass at each wheel position simultaneously are available. With proper care, it is possible to accurately measure Cg. A body of literature exists describing the various techniques.'3,41 The accuracy that one may obtain for Cg location may be dependent upon measurement uncertainty and vehicle population variances. Accommodation of these uncertainties may be appropriate when designing mass properties envelopes. Generally, measurement of Cg position within 2% accuracy is possible.'51 Knowing the Cg location with the vehicle empty and its suspension locked near its maximum compressed deflection allows the calculation of the Cg location movement as a result of suspension deflection during vehicle loading. This can be accomplished by locking the suspension near the maximum compressed suspension deflection and measuring Cg location with the vehicle in its empty configuration. The Cg location of the total vehicle, when empty, moves proportionally to the suspension deflections. An inaccurate Cg location will be calculated if the effect of loading is not accounted for during suspension movement . Mass moment of inertia is difficult to measure; however, this information exists in the literature for a number of vehicles.'6"81 Included in these references is Cg information. Front and rear suspension rates are measured by applying loads to each corner of the vehicle at increasing increments and measuring sprung mass (relative to unsprung mass) deflection versus wheel load. This procedure can be performed at all four wheels simultaneously. Load mass properties and location can be determined by measurement, analysis, or 1919</page><page sequence="3">referenced sources. Descriptions of properties for occupants are available in references.19"111 Rectangular solids with homogeneous density approximate loads in a vehicle's cargo volume. Measuring the occupant H-point(s) and cargo positions directly in the vehicle is the simplest method to define load position.

The loaded Cg location and mass properties, along with roll and yaw mass moment of inertias, are then calculated for the loading configuration of interest. One can plot these properties that form the envelopes when the vehicle mass properties for all the load configurations of interest are determined. These envelopes can be in formats such as vertical Cg location versus longitudinal Cg location, yaw moment of inertia versus roll moment of inertia, and front axle weights versus rear axle weights, among other envelopes. APPLICATION The development of a method for determining a vehicle mass properties envelope was precipitated by requirements to test a small sport utility vehicle in limit maneuvers with appropriate safety equipment and instrumentation (roll bar, outriggers, and 16-channel data acquisition). One requirement for the testing was maintaining the vehicle Cg location and mass properties as similar to driver-only condition as possible. Analysis of other tests of vehicles conducting limit maneuvers suggested that on-board vehicle instrumentation and safety equipment produced vehicle inertial properties well in excess of those expected in a vehicle's maximum conceivable load, much less a driver-only condition. In any test, the equipment necessary to conduct the test should have minimal effects on the test results. The usefulness of test results in motor vehicle handling and stability testing for evaluating non-test vehicles may be suspect if necessary on-board equipment causes properties to be outside the mass properties envelopes intended by the vehicle design or expected use. Mass properties envelopes of a small sport utility vehicle were calculated using "design load weight" (design load weight is defined by SAE J1 100) and loading recommendations consistent with the vehicle manufacturer. The mass properties envelopes also were calculated for the small sport utility vehicle in three test configurations. The different test configurations are described as light, medium, and heavy, which broadly represent a range of outrigger designs.1121 The envelopes associated with these parameters are shown in Figures 1 and 2 with the load configurations listed in Table 2. In a second example, the effects of an after- market roof-top carrier on a vehicle's mass, Cg, 1920</page><page sequence="4">and inertial properties are evaluated. Mass properties envelopes were developed similar to that of the small sport utility vehicle in the above example using the vehicle "design load weight" and loading recommendations of the vehicle manufacturer. The vehicle Owner's Manual recommends a roof-top luggage rack with a weight limit of 44 kg. However, the after-market car-top carrier provides an empty weight of 44 kg and a rated load capacity of 91 kg, Load Configuration Effects on Sport Utility Vehicle Cg Location 760 740 I, 720 LB/ T2 •4CZ N. ļ ® 700 ' / 8 ' '/ ™ 680 T3 ^^Emptyb - - Test Empty 660 I I 1000 1050 1100 1150 1200 1250 1300 1350 1400 Cg Longitudinal from Rear Axle (mm) Figure 2: Cg Envelope for a Small Sport Utility Vehicle Table 2: Small Sport Utility Vehicle Load Configuration Load Configuration Description Config.

Besides producing load configurations outside the calculated mass properties envelope, the roof- top carrier produces changes in the front and rear axle weights that, under expected usage of the vehicle, will exceed the specified weight capacities of the vehicle, as shown in Figure 5. The practice of drawing straight lines between points for a given envelope represents an approximation of the true mass properties envelope. One could better define the shape of the envelope by calculating the intermediate points depending upon the specific interest. Vehicle loads and associated vehicle mass properties were selected to represent obvious points defining an envelope. These points represent vehicle loads of 68 kg occupants and cargo consistent with manufacturer's recommendations and not in excess of vehicle weight ratings. These loads, while consistent with "design load weight," are obviously inconsistent with the wide range of possible occupant sizes and cargo positions. The example of the roof-top carrier provides a context for a final discussion of mass property envelopes and expected usage. Prior examples of mass property envelopes were developed consistent with a vehicle's design load weight and loading recommendations of the vehicle's manufacturer. A vehicle's expected mass property envelopes can be developed, given load configurations consistent with the vehicle's expected use, including after-market equipment. For example, a vehicle's design load weight assumes a 68 kg occupant in each seating position; however, it is expected that occupants weighing in excess of 68 kg may sit in one or more seating positions. Similarly, a seat designated for two occupant positions may be wide enough for three or two occupants with cargo. SUMMARY Examples have been provided in this paper that illustrate the presentation and utility of vehicle mass property envelopes. These envelopes are useful for evaluating the effect of any load configurations relative to vehicle performance/design specifications as well as for minimizing effects of vehicle modifications for testing. The mass property envelopes can provide automotive designers and after-market designers a method for evaluating the effects of various load configurations on the fundamental properties of the vehicle for appropriate vehicle design, usage, instruction and warning.

This technique involves looking at the range of a vehicle's mass and inertial properties rather than a single value approach. Therefore, this type of analysis could be especially useful in the selection of input values for computational simulations. Also, the set up and evaluation of vehicular testing may be enhanced with the utilization of this approach. One consideration when using this type of analysis is that the accuracy of the data and potential errors must be carefully evaluated and considered. This is especially true when using published data and comparing it to a specific vehicle, the two vehicles while similar may not be identical. #951065 Discussion by Wesley Grimes Collision Engineering Associates, Inc. Motor Vehicle Mass Properties Envelope This is an interesting paper that brings out an alternative way of analyzing vehicle parameters. Vehicle loading, both cargo and passengers, definitely affects the dynamic behavior of motor vehicles. This paper presents a way of visualizing how the actual loading compares to the loading indicated by vehicle specifications, such as how a roof-mounted cargo carrier affects the roll moment of inertia. The mass properties envelope may also provide insight into how certain types of vehicle handling tests are performed. Using the mass property envelopes should ensure that the test vehicles are "representative" of actual vehicles on the roadway, or whether the test vehicle mass properties are within the vehicle designed envelope. The term "expected usage" is used in the paper, but is not specifically defined. This is certainly not the focus of the paper, but it does have implications in how designers of products may view users of products. The mass property envelopes may help in defining the "expected usage" more thoroughly in future work. It is also interesting to note tha tin the aviation industry, even pilots of small aircraft are expected to know and understand the performance envelopes of their vehicles. Maybe the mass property envelopes should be produced for automobile drivers. However, the "typical driver" would probably require some additional education or training to fully comprehend the significance of the data. 1925</page></plain_text>
