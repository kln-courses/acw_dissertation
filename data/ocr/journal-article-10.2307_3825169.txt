<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ann Mozley EVOLUTION AND THE CLIMATE OF OPINION IN AUSTRALIA, 1840-76* "IN ANY COMMUNITY, at any particular time, certain habits of thought pre- vail," one philosopher has written in defining the phrase "climate of opinion." "There is a network of established opinion the truth of which everybody takes for granted."1 In the first half of the nineteenth century the climate of scientific opinion in England found its direction and its core in the natural theology of the works of Archdeacon William Paley. Paley's Natural Theology, first pub- lished in 1802, went through thirty-one editions by 1879, while his earlier The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy (1785) and A View of the Evidences of Christianity (1794) were standard texts at Oxford and Cam- bridge for examination for the B.A. degree. There were few graduates of the ancient universities who did not find their faith in a universe of design and purpose epitomised in Paley's lucid creed: "There cannot be design without a designer; contrivance without a contriver; order without choice; arrange- ment, without anything capable of arranging; subserviency and relation to a purpose, without that which could intend a purpose; means suitable to an end, without the end ever having been contemplated, or the means accom- modated to it. Arrangement, disposition of parts, subserviency of means to an end, relation of instruments to a use, imply the presence of intelligence and mind."2 "I could almost formerly have said it by heart," Charles Darwin ad- mitted of the Evidences in 1859.3 Paley was not, of course, the originator of this particular view of a beneficent and divinely ordered Nature. Ever since the time of Bacon, scien- tists and natural philosophers had been unfolding a purposeful plan in the organisation of the natural world. Newton, architect of the scientific revolu- tion, implicitly acknowledged a planned universe, while the celebrated naturalist, John Ray, breathing the air of the same revolution in 1691, en- shrined the concept in a work, The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of Creation, which was to colour the study of natural history for a hundred and fifty years. Nevertheless, for the nineteenth century, it was William Paley's clear vision, and his clearer prose, that gave the concept of a planned universe its particular insistence and currency. Coupled with this acceptance of such a universe, Genesis and Moses' account of the Flood gave men pivotal explanations of the physical world. * I acknowledge with thanks the permission of the Trustees of the Mitchell Library, Sydney, to quote from manuscript material in their keeping.

JUNE 1967</page><page sequence="2">Ann Mozley Man himself, under Bishop James Ussher's guidance, could look back to his origins six thousand years before and accept his creation after the creation of plants and animals as a separate, premeditated act of God. It was a short- lived, preordained, divinely governed world. 'Vulcanists" and "Neptunists" might debate the relative importance of fire and water in shaping the surface of the earth, but more potent and pervasive was the theory that violent super- natural intervention had effected the more extreme changes in the physical world. To this "Catastrophist" philosophy the researches carried out by Georges Cuvier in the fossil strata of the Paris basin in 1811 lent authoritative force and grafted a theory of wholesale extinction and successive creation of species to the story of inorganic change.4 Catastrophism captured men's minds5 and, for some time after Darwin's theory was launched, it continued to provide an accommodating framework for those unable to embrace the theory of natural selection and evolutionary growth. Yet the winds of intellectual change blew strongly from another quarter as the century moved on. Geology was emerging as a factual and inductive science. James Hutton and John Playfair in the last years of the eighteenth century had asserted a doctrine of gradual geological change.6 Some thirty years later Charles Lyell, in his Principles of Geology (1830-33), postulated an extended theory of "Uniformitarianism" - the slow transforma- tion of the earth's crust by the familiar forces of nature constantly at work - and, from an array of factual evidence, disposed of Noah's Deluge as a primary and universal geological cause. In the second volume of his work Lyell applied Uniformitarian principles to organic life and argued for the extinction, appearance, and distribution of species over changing and infinite ages of time. Lyell's work undermined Catastrophism, while his ideas of the distribution of species worked powerfully on Darwin's mind. In revealing the enormous age of the earth, Lyell made room for the theory of the transmuta- tion of species and the acceptance of the antiquity of man. Naturalists, however, continued to formulate hypotheses on the origin and development of species founded on intelligence and design; and church- men made careful reconciliations between Mosaic cosmogony and the advanc- ing claims of science. Yet evolution was in the air. Lamarck's thesis of pro- gressive evolution, first enunciated in 1801, claimed some scientific adherents as the century wore on, while Robert Chambers' amateurish but eloquent Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation acted strongly on the popular mind.7 Such, in outline, was the ferment, the ebb and flow of scientific and theological theory that formed the climate of opinion in England until the 4 Georges Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart, Essai sur la geographie mineralogique des environs de Paris avec une carte ggognostique, et des coupes de terrain (Paris, 1811); and Cuvier, Discours sur les revolutions de la surface du globe (Paris, 1812). 5 Cf.

The book reached eleven editions by 186o. VICTORIAN STUDIES 412</page><page sequence="3">EVOLUTION IN AUSTRALIA publication of Darwin's Origin of Species transformed man's concept of the organic world.8 The change was slow and painful, worked out against tradi- tional and metaphysical attitudes and ideological beliefs. Scientists varied greatly in the methods they adopted to come to terms with the Darwinian view. Churchmen made their own accommodations, or resolutely declined to make them, in a period of great intellectual flux and change. Twelve thousand miles away, in the southern hemisphere, was a colony founded for convict settlement which nonetheless owed its origin to Britain's quest for scientific knowledge. With its curious marsupials and its unique flora, Australia would contribute its own impressive testimony to the concept of natural selection and evolutionary growth. Darwin visited it on the "Beagle" in 1836; Thomas Huxley spent his earliest scientific years in its harbours and waters as naturalist to the "Rattlesnake" from 1847-50; Joseph Hooker collected richly from Tasmanian flora as botanist to Captain James Ross's maritime and magnetic survey in 1842; and all acknowledged a par- ticular debt to Australian science.9 It seems of interest, therefore, to examine the reaction in Australia to the major intellectual influence of nineteenth-century science, viewing it as a microcosm of the greater scientific world. Did Australian scientists, isolated by a passage of many months from the centres of intellectual thought, take part in the first quarter century after the publication of the Origin of Species in the evolutionary debate? Did colonial churchmen figure in this vital conflict between religion and science? What, broadly, was the climate of Australian opinion before the publication of the Origin, and what impact did the Dar- winian theory make? I Historians have painted a picture of the intellectual poverty of nine- teenth-century colonial life;10 of a community of squatters, merchants, and convicts cut off from, and careless of, the currents of contemporary thought. There is certainly evidence to support this view. In the 1830's, the outspoken Presbyterian leader, Rev. Dr. John Dunmore Lang, characterised a deep- rooted colonial indifference to science: "The only animals whose natural history it is deemed of consequence to investigate in New South Wales," he wrote astringently, "are the sheep and the bull... ; and of all the branches of study which the world of nature may be supposed to present to the scien- tific inquirer in the Australian colonies, the only one that has hitherto 8 Recent scholarship provides some excellent landmarks in this field of intellectual history, including, notably, John C. Greene, The Death of Adam: Evolution and its Impact on Western Thought (Ames, Iowa, 1959); Loren Eiseley, Darwin's Century (New York, 1958); Bentley Glass, ed., The Forerunners of Darwin (Baltimore, 1959); Gillispie's, bibliographical essay, pp. 229-256; and among periodical literature, Walter F.

JUNE 1967 413</page><page sequence="4">Ann Mozley engrossed the pursuit of all classes is, how to make the most of it."1 Not only the community, but the government too shared this apathetic attitude to colonial science. The departure of Sir Thomas Brisbane at the expiry of his governorship of New South Wales in 1826 brought a brilliant venture in astronomy to an effective end; Australia's first scientific museum, founded in Sydney in 1827, struggled on without a curator for several years; and this embryonic institution, a declining observatory at Parramatta, and the Botanic Gardens at Sydney and the Swan River in Western Australia, represented in the 'thirties the colonial governments' entire commitment to the work of science. Local opinion, indeed, was distinctly unfavourable to expenditure on science. "Zoology, Mineralogy, Astronomy and Botany, and other sciences are all very good things," the Sydney Monitor said on 20 July 1833, "but we have no great opinion of an infantile people being taxed to promote them. An infant Colony cannot afford to become scientific for the benefit of mankind." The economy rode on the sheep's back, and men's minds were generally felted up with wool and the price of tallow and stock. In this environment it was not surprising that philosophical and scientific societies failed to take root, and that scientific journals devoted to Australian subjects were correspondingly slow to appear. There was in the colonies, however, a small coterie of scientists and scholars who subscribed to the English scientific and literary journals, who catalogued and exchanged their limited works of reference, and who, sensible of their intellectual isolation in a remote land, kept up their communications with scientists in the colonies and abroad. For some, their own researches added to the accumulation of evidence on new genera and species and brought them directly into the currents of scientific thought. Questions of fixity of species, Catastrophism, of man's place in nature, and of the systematisation and classification of scientific facts were discussed among them and in their letters, as they were by scientists overseas. In New South Wales alone there were two scientists - the zoologist, William Sharp Macleay, and the geologist, Rev. W. B. Clarke - whose work in England placed them in the mainstream of scientific ideas and whose emigration to the colony in 1839 gave a singular impetus to colonial science. Macleay had taken a prominent part in the debate on species. Graduating from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1814, he had studied under Cuvier in Paris and had come into contact with the naturalists, Lamarck, Pierre Latrielle, and Jules Savigny, at a time when they were dramatically enlarging the frontiers of their science. Macleay published his conclusions on the classi- fication of species in a treatise entitled Horae Entomologicae in 1821. In this he espoused the Quinary or Circular system, founded on affinity and analogy. Briefly, the system derived from the assumption that the animal kingdom was based, at all levels, on five groups arranged in a circle, each with analogous relations to neighbouring circles of five similarly arranged subgroups. "One plan extends throughout the universe," Macleay declared, "and this plan is founded on the principle of series of affinities returning into themselves, and forming as it were circles." It was a system that, in its author's view, brought him close to the true Natural System which Macleay regarded as "the 11 An Historical and Statistical Account of New South Wales (London, 1834), p. 183.

But at a time when men were fumbling for signposts in the systematisation of the organic world, Macleay's work was regarded as a stimulating contribution to scientific thought and created its own persistent following.'l Darwin himself wrestled with it in his early "Notebooks on Trans- mutation" before discarding it;14 and as late as 1851, Huxley, reading the Horae on his return from Sydney, could still assert, "I am every day becoming more and more certain that you were on the right track thirty years ago in your view of the order and symmetry to be traced to the true natural system."15 Clarke was trained at Cambridge by the great field geologist, Adam Sedgwick, and spent his formative years in English scientific circles in the decades of the 'twenties and 'thirties, when geology was shaking off the trappings of a strict theology and taking its place as an inductive and observa- tional science. Clarke arrived in Sydney with Lyells Principles of Geology in his baggage and was himself to lay the firm foundations of geological science in New South Wales. Like his more eminent colleagues, Sedgwick and William Buckland at Oxford, he had embraced the tenets of the Deluge and Catastrophism, but was to concede them both as time went on to the more plausible evidence of Lyell. Like many good geologists of the period, Clarke was concerned with the reconciliation of Genesis with the growing body of scientific fact. Yet, unlike some of his clerical colleagues, he did not insist that the interpretation be too exact. Convinced that man could not fathom with his scanty intellect the unfathomable depths of "the All-Providing and the All-Wise," Clarke sought to confine his science as strictly as possible to the realm of observed fact. Geology, he told an audience before sailing for Australia, was not con- cerned with the original omnipotent feat of creation; "it merely portends to investigate the agents which omnipotence has employed since the beginning in modifying the structure originally formed in the creative world."l' The Mosaic cosmogony, however, represented for nineteenth-century scientists a recurring touchstone for the examination of their scientific ideas, and in 1842 Macleay and Clarke were in lively correspondence on this subject from their homes in New South Wales. From Eli7abeth Bay, Macleay wrote, I believe that terrestrial vegetation ... followed upon the earth's appearance out of the primeval deep, but ... I do not believe that vegetation preceded the appear- ance of the sun and of every kind of aquatic animal ... Nevertheless, I do not think 12 Quoted in J. J.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 416</page><page sequence="7">EVOLUTION IN AUSTRALIA I am placed in the sad predicament of conceiving the statements of Moses incon- sistent with the truth.... Nor do I conceive that there is any improbability in some great astronomical change having taken place long prior to the existence of Man. In short, my interpretation of the Bible is that the Sun existed before the fourth day, but the Creator at that epoch made it to regulate the day and year as they at present exist.... As to the time of creation of the acquatic animals, I believe Infusoria to have been almost contemporaneous with the precipitation of water; that is, with the formation of the earliest primitive strata.17 Yet despite these accommodations, Macleay found it difficult to fit his zoo- logical learning to the Mosaic account, and in the same letter he confessed to Clarke that he had renounced the Bible as a "scientific book." "Although I do not conceive Moses wrote anything inconsistent with the truth," he qualified, "I have as much confidence in his opinion on the binomial theorem as I have in his dictum on geology." Throughout these early years of their self-imposed exile, Clarke and Macleay frequently joined issue on current scientific themes. In 1847 the discovery of the bones of a Diprotodon in Queensland raised the question of the fate of these giant marsupials, on whom the comparative anatomist, Richard Owen, was slowly assembling his theories and facts. Macleay argued that these marsupials became gradually extinct over long periods of time. The tenets of Catastrophism, however, lingered with Clarke, who took up the question in the columns of the press. "Without denying the deduction of Mr. Macleay respecting the gradual dying out of races," he countered in a letter of 6 December, "I still think that some of the remains of our extinct animals have been the subject of a violent catastrophe and are not merely the evidence of extinction by quiet death."18 Despite occasional dogmatism, Clarke stood above the rest of the clergy in his detached and scholarly attitude to science. It was, nonetheless, the clergy as the educated members of the colony (for a high proportion held Oxford and Cambridge degrees) who gave an early encouragement to the pursuit of science. In 1828, Rev. C. P. N. Wilton, Chaplain of Convicts at Newcastle, founded the Australian Quarterly Journal, a magazine of theology, literature, and science, and urged the particular investigation of the natural sciences and geology as studies entirely compatible with the Scriptures. Thir- teen years later the Church of England Clerical Book Society, which Clarke founded in Sydney, was the repository of the largest collection of British scientific journals and works of scientific reference in Australia. This rising and positive interest in science found favour with the Bishop of Australia. Early in his episcopate Bishop W. G. Broughton had made clear that the Church "bears no hostility to the pursuit of science." On the contrary, it was anxious "to receive the homage of its professors and to embrace them as her sons."19 Nevertheless, in conferring his presidency on the Clerical Book Society in 1841, he made plain the measure of this embrace. 17 W.

This found direct expression in New South Wales in the Sydney Guardian, A Journal of Religious, Literary and Scientific Information, sponsored in 1847-48 by a group of moderate Protest- ant clergymen. Its purpose was the glorification of God and an understand- ing of His works through the study of Nature. Summarising the journal's philosophy in an early issue, one anonymous contributor wrote that "All the works of Nature may simply be regarded as so many different methods, in which the all-wise Creator intends to convey some idea of his magnetic attributes; and we cannot doubt but that the most minute, as well as the most stupendous of the works of God, were designed, and are calculated, to glorify Him who made them all."21 The marine mollusc buccinum furnished another contributor to the same issue with evidence of an intelligent and contriving mind. "Could any surer proof of design in the creation of these animals be expected," he demanded, "than the discovery of a flexible file placed within their mouth, to enable them to get at their food through the hard thick shells? ... Each separate and independent proof of design is in itself separate and independent proof that animals ... are created by a Being of power and wisdom" (pp. 138-139). The non-conformist clergy in Australia shared this teleological concept of the universe. In Tasmania, the leading Presbyterian cleric, Dr. John Lille, published his testimony to a wise and beneficent Creator in a number of lectures whose titles bore witness to his philosophical creed;22 yet for Lille the serious practice of science was not only tied to a philosophical framework. It was Lille who promoted the scholarly Tasmanian Journal of Natural Science, Australia's first scientific journal, and stressed its purpose to contribute to a systematic knowledge of science and, shunning theory, to provide a repository of well ascertained fact. During its four years of publication, 1842-46, the Tasmanian Journal enjoyed the wide support of the clergy. In New South Wales Lang was another nonconformist preacher who combined fundamentalist theology with a lively and practical interest in science. Lang was committed to the Mosaic account of Creation and the Deluge, and delivered a series of lectures on the subject in Sydney in 1843. Yet he had early accepted the interpretation liberal churchmen overseas were placing on Genesis - that each created day coincided with a long period of geological time- and, as he travelled around the country on his pastoral 20 Report . . . of Church of England Book Society 1841; together with the Opening Address (Sydney, 1841), p. 17. 21 Sydney Guardian, 16 Oct. 1848, p. 92. 22 The Advantages of Science (Hobart, 1839); Subserviency of the Works of Nature to Religion (Hobart, 1842); Opportunities of Intellectual Improvement (Hobart, 1842); "The Perception of the Beautiful," Lectures Delivered at the Mechanics' Institute (Hobart, 1849), pp. 3-8. VICTORIAN STUDIES 418</page><page sequence="9">EVOLUTION IN AUSTRALIA affairs, he found the evidence of an antique continent no obstacle to this reconciliation.23 Secure in this conviction, Lang was the first to press upon the legislature of New South Wales the need for a geological survey of the colony in the interests of scientific and economic development. While faith in the Mosaic cosmogony prevailed widely in educated circles in Australia, the rise of the democratic Mechanics' Institutes provided forums for the expression of more critical ideas. A lecturer at the Launcestan Mechanics' Institute in 1843 warned pointedly against moves "to shift and shuffle the solid strata of the earth to suit the dogmas of any class of men,"24 while, as the decade of the 'fifties drew to a close, there were indications from more conservative sources that the careful attempts to reconcile science with revealed religion were not universally approved. The Empire newspaper, in a review of a work by Rev. George Wight entitled Geology and Genesis (London, 1857), turned a critical eye on all who sought to make this reconciliation on the existing knowledge of science. The question of agreement or disagreement between Genesis and geology, the writer concluded, "should remain an open one until the professors of geology can agree amongst themselves. They have scarcely settled the alpha- bet of their science."25 At least one prominent scientific cleric, the Govern- ment Astronomer of New South Wales, Rev. William Scott, shared the view that Genesis had been put too often upon the rack. "It is high time," he warned the Philosophical Society of the colony in December 1858, "that the world at large and the scientific world in particular should acknowledge the truth; that believers in revelation should know that their Scriptures contain and are intended to contain, a revelation of religion alone; and that the book of nature is the only book which God has given to man in which to read the laws of material creation. The most strenuous advocates of the full inspiration of the Christian scriptures cannot lose anything by allowing that the writers of those books were ignorant of the truths which astronomy and geology have since brought to light."26 Rather, they gained by such admission, for they thereby escaped the difficult and dangerous dilemma in which they were placed by finding their faith opposed to their reason. III This, then, was the climate of opinion in Australia into which Dar- win's profoundly disturbing book, the Origin of Species, was launched. It was a background that differed mainly in depth and diversity from the intellectual atmosphere of England; and in quantity, of course - in the num- ber of scientific participants engaged in the field. Even so, a substantial 23 John Dunmore Lang: Chiefly Autobiographical 1799 to 1878, ed.

Geology and mineralogy had profited from the discovery of gold. Victoria had established a Geological Survey in 1852, while Clarke and a geological surveyor sent from England had been signed on to carry out government geological reconnaissance in New South Wales. The new uni- versities of Melbourne and Sydney established in the 'fifties by the grant of self-government in Victoria and New South Wales, reflected this burgeoning concern for the humanities and for science. Yet, essentially, intellectual life remained derivative, dependent for stimulus on activities in the country colonials still called "Home." In science this had a marked effect and Aus- tralian investigators, confronted by rich new evidence in every field, were significantly less ready to indulge in the speculative analysis that occupied their more eminent colleagues overseas. In this, the Tasmanian botanist, R. C. Gunn, F.R.S., forwarding specimens for Hooker's Flora Tasmanicae (1859) which would give Darwin such compelling support, was typical - he was content, as he confided, to collect and systematise, and to leave the discovery and development of theory to those who followed.27 The clergy gathered their botanical and zoological specimens, and their rocks, and sang the praises of Providential Design. The Vestiges of Creation was read by many, and dismissed as well-written but absurd. At the same time, there were indi- cations that some scholars were searching for a proper detachment and bal- ance between the increasingly conflicting claims of theology and science. In the colonies, as in England, the Origin of Species was not the concern of the popular press and references to it were slow to make their appearance. The Sydney Morning Herald contended itself with a brief report of the reaction of scientific circles in England. "This vexed question with which the scientific world is still so much agitated," the columnist noted under the heading "Origin of Species" on 26 June 186o, "is discussed in the fullest manner in the new number of the Edinburgh Review. ... A summary is given of Mr. Darwin's hypothesis, and his chief experiments are noticed; and, after considering the opinion of Buffon, Cuvier, Lamarck, Owen, Wallace, Agassiz, and other eminent naturalists, the writer, in conclusion, expresses his decided adhesion to the views of Cuvier, Owen and Agassiz, in opposition to those maintained by Buffon, Lamarck, the 'Vestiges,' Baden Powell and Darwin." The book, however, was quickly in circulation among the scientifically- minded members of the community. "Your 'book of the season,' as the reviewers have it," the Sydney artist Conrad Martens wrote playfully to Darwin, his former shipmate on the "Beagle," "I must own I have not read, although Mr. Clarke offered to lend it to me. I am afraid of your eloquence and I dont want to think that I have an origin in common with toads and tadpoles."28 Clarke himself, however, avidly devoured the Origin and wasted 27 H. N.

The geological chapters especially engrossed him and he offered some corrections from his own researches on the formations of the southern hemisphere, as well as news of his findings of glacial evidence in the Australian Alps. Darwin replied enthusiastically on 25 October 1862: I thank you cordially for your very kind expressions towards me and for your letter which has deeply interested me. I had not heard your account of Glacial action in Australia: had I heard of it, I should have alluded to the case in different terms.... Your name has of course been familiar to me for years. When I come to the subject again, I will refer to your account, for the subject interests me extremely.... There are great difficulties in believing in a mundane cooler period; but it would throw a flood of light on Geographical Distribution. I have only just sketched the subject in the Origin and have a long M.S. discussion drawn out, but Heaven knows whether I shall ever live to publish half my M.S .... No subject interests me more than the Glacial period. .. . I am very glad to hear of your new discoveries of secondary fossils in New South Wales. I have for some time thought that the geology of dis- tant countries would help in the progress of science more than anything else; and in this you have been an earnest worker. Most cordially do I wish you all success.29 Eager to underpin his theories with meticulous and far-ranging fact, Darwin invited Clarke's help in his botanical experiments. Dr. Ferdinand von Mueller, Victoria's Government Botanist whom he had earlier consulted, had been, Darwin regretfully reported to Clarke in the same letter "too busy to help me." "I know that your axe is very busy," he now pressed Clarke engagingly, "but then I fancy that you have indomitable energy." Clarke's letters to Dar- win, unfortunately, have not survived, and there is no evidence to indicate that he carried out these enthusiastic requests; but his unbiassed interest in the Origin is clearly attested in Darwin's friendly letter from Down. Clarke's scholarly reception of the Origin of Species was not, however, reflected among his scientific colleagues.30 To an almost exclusive degree they declined to meet the challenging theory on any but philosophical grounds. Like the great majority of British scientists, they shrank from transmutation and Natural Selection, less as workable hypotheses for the origin and classi- fication of species but rather because of the onslaught such adaptive processes delivered against their religious beliefs. Macleay, whose early participation in the debate on species qualified him to make a scientific evaluation, saw the issue primarily in theological terms. Writing to Robert Lowe in London in May 1860, he summed up his reaction directly: "This question is no less What am I? What is man? a created being under the direct government of the Creator, or only an acci- dental sprout of some primordial type that was the common progenitor of both animals and vegetables." The naturalist, Macleay pondered, found him- self on the horns of a dilemma. For, from the facts he observed, he must 29 Darwin to Clarke, 25 Oct. 1862, Clarke papers, Uncatalogued MSS 139/3. 30 Darwin in his letter to Clarke of 25 Oct. 1862, alluded to the interest of one more Australian scientist at this time, James Drummond, Government Botanist in Western Australia, who "writes to me from Swan River that he has seen Bees open the indusium and extract pollen."

Macleay was disposed to believe that Darwin, whom he judged a "first rate naturalist," had cushioned many facts that tended to operate against his theory and had ignored the relevance of others. But, fundamentally, the zoologist's quarrel was less with the thesis and illustration of Natural Selection, which he related closely to the evolutionary creed of the Vestiges of Creation and Lamarck, than with Darwin's conception of a Creator, who, having made the world and its inhabitants, fell asleep and left it to manage itself. "I am myself so far a Pantheist," he confided to Lowe, "that I see God in everything; but then I believe in his special Providence, and that he is the constant and active sole Creator and all-wise Administrator of the Universe."31 Three years later, when Huxley's able exposition of Darwin's theory was influencing thoughtful minds, Macleay saw no reason to revise his view. "I am utterly opposed to Darwin's, or rather Lamarck's theory," he wrote to Clarke; and no one, he judged, had done greater harm to Genesis than Dar- win, Huxley, and Lyell.32 In Victoria, the doyen of the scientific fraternity, Mueller, whose "busy- ness" Darwin had noticed, reacted to the theory of transmutation with equal sharpness. Mueller, a loyal member of the Lutheran Church until his death in 1896, clung tenaciously to his belief in the fixity of species, and refused to contemplate Darwin's thesis of Natural Selection or to help in any way with experiments that might sustain it. His unyielding attitude at a time when he was working in collaboration with George Bentham on Flora Australiensis (1863-78) created considerable difficulty and friction and was a serious obstacle to their research. For Bentham, like the more illustrious Hooker, was in the van of British botanists in accepting the impressive weight of Darwin's factual evidence. "Whatever may be one's opinion of the speculative part of his work," he advised Mueller in July 1862, "it is very certain that the numerous facts he [Darwin] has observed must cause naturalists to reconsider their previous opinions."33 Bentham in 1862 was already considering that his own former views on the fixity of species must be modified or some exceptions admitted, and in October of that year he urged on Mueller the need to be particularly cautious in uniting as species "forms which have that degree of apparent permanency which will justify the majority of botanists in main- taining them distinct."34 Mueller, however, felt impelled to clarify his own position on the question of species and in 1864 issued a booklet in which, he told a friend, he had "opposed the transmutation theory so dangerous to our Christian faith." "We may all be suddenly away from the world," he wrote soberly, "and I thought it well to deposit however briefly my views on this serious 31 Quoted in A.

In Victoria, the President of the Royal Society and the colony's gov- ernor, Sir Henry Barkly, struck a sternly critical note and urged the scientific fraternity of the colony to refute by every scholarly means a theory "so pernicious to the very existence of Christianity."36 Yet Barkly was no un- scientific figure lending vice-regal patronage to science. He was a serious student of geology and natural history whose governorship had given impetus to the colony's scientific life. He would not, however, surrender to evolution in any form. Indeed, he looked to scientific investigation in Australia, he said, to confirm the completeness of the geological record and provide the missing fossil link that would, in Darwin's own submission, render the theory of Natural Selection untenable. In striking contrast, Clarke, in his Vice-Presidential inaugural address to the newly formed Royal Society of New South Wales, argued for a long and liberal view of such interpretations of nature as Darwin was advancing. 'We ought not to be accused of nervousness as to the fate of the Scriptures," this scientific churchman postulated, "if we would wait for further evidence or for a wider range of experiment." Aware of the importance of hypothetical conjectures in the development of scientific ideas, Clarke could see no objec- tion to the statement of arguments in the Origin of Species, or the observa- tions on which these arguments were based. A flood of light, he said, was streaming in from every scientific quarter and there was room for limitless investigation of the physical world. Nevertheless, the larger issues of how the universe was made and projected were not, he considered, the proper province for the labours of the new Society. These lay rather in the field of the observational sciences where "only partial success is permitted" but where the continent of Australia offered so much to excite the curiosity and intelli- gence of man. We must strive to discern clearly, understand fully, and report faithfully; to love truth in things physical as in things moral; to abjure hasty theories and unsupported conjectures; where we are in doubt, not to be positive; to give our brother observer the same measure of credit we take for ourselves; not striving for mastery, but leaving time for the formation of the judgment which will inevitably be given, whether for 35 Mueller to Euphemia Henderson, 5 Nov. 1864, quoted in A.

Hanson was more than an enlightened layman bringing a penetrating legal mind to bear on evolutionary thought. He had made a critical study of the literature, had read the Vestiges of Creation and the writings of Lamarck, and was well-versed in the works of Richard Owen. In religion, as in politics and law, he was a thoughtful and assertive inde- pendent. In four closely argued papers38 Hanson reviewed contemporary scientific and theological thinking, but directed his main attack against the successive creationists for whom organic life, miraculously, took its place in an arbitrarily changing world. The anthropomorphic view of a Supreme Being who, dissatisfied with the materials He had created and clearly unable to manage them to His satisfaction, breaks up the old system from time to time and furnishes the world anew, was, Hanson asserted, not an interpreta- tion that either reason or revelation sanctioned, and seemed to him to "intro- duce low and unworthy views" of God's character and work. Alternatively, the theories put forward by Benoit de Maillet and Lamarck were as little in accord with observed phenomena, and as little capable of proof, as the theory of immediate creation they had been invented to supersede. Darwin, on the other hand, offered a theory on the operation of nature strictly in accordance with what one knows from experience and can infer from analogy. Though self-confessedly incomplete, its general supposition was sound and it offered a vera causa. Above all, the law of Natural Selection disposed of the necessity of an intelligence guided by purpose and continually in action to bias the laws of change. Instead, the intelligence that established the law had rendered it self-regulating and self-executing. For Hanson, this interpretation, far from undermining a conception of divine wisdom and design, strengthened and confirmed it. "The highest evidence of the wisdom, and the most adequate idea of the character of God," he affirmed, "appear to me to be derived from the contemplation of all things, whether inorganic, vital, mental or spiritual, working together, obscurely perhaps but unerringly, towards the accomplishment of results which he has preordained, in obedience to laws which he has established."39 Hanson's argu- ment for an effective and determining first cause was not one, however, that found ready acceptance in Adelaide in 1864; and indeed, his attack on the literal Scripturalists exposed him to the distrust of the colony's evangelists to 87 Transactions of the Royal Society of New South Wales, I (1867), 27. 88 Four Papers read before the Adelaide Philosophical Society by Richard Davies Hanson (Adelaide, 1864), bound with the Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Adelaide, I (1877-78).

VICTORIAN STUDIES 424</page><page sequence="15">EVOLUTION IN AUSTRALIA the end of his days. Yet in the Australian debate on the Origin of Species, his contribution stands out as a remarkably perceptive and modem comment on evolutionary thought. While other men pulled down their mental blinds on the heretical thesis from across the seas, Hanson looked forward with confidence to a time when Darwin's work would be recognised as having begun a new era, and when it would be conceded that "if he [Darwin] has not himself effectually solved the problem, yet ... he has opened up the true way to its ultimate solution" (p. 34). In the Australian universities such scholarly anticipation met with no scientific assent. At the University of Melbourne the Professor of History and Political Economy, Edward Hearn, propounded his theory of the industrial evolution of society in a remarkable work, Plutology, published in 1864;40 but this stimulating Darwinian application evoked no echo from the Uni- versity's departments of science. There the foundation professors were staunch and articulate anti-evolutionists. George Britton Halford, who had come to Melbourne in 1862 to take up the University's first Anatomy, Physi- ology, and Pathology Chair, was Richard Owen's nominee for the post, and, soon after his arrival in the colony, he went to the intellectual defence of his patron in the debate on man and monkey. Owen's grounds for combatting Darwin's theory of evolution and descent were, primarily, that the anatomical structure of man's brain was distinct from that of other animals. Huxley, in his Evidence on Man's Place in Nature, published in 1863, refuted Owen. Halford, after dissecting two monkeys in Melbourne that same year, offered his contribution in a treatise that bore the arresting title Not Like Man, Bimanous and Biped, nor Yet Quadrumanous, but Cheiropodous (Melbourne, 1863), and claimed that Huxley had fallen into "grievous error." "Surely the intricacies of the monkey's foot," he argued "were planned, as was also the comparative simplicity of man's. They could never run the one into the other, or, to use a fashionable scientific term, be 'developed' the one from the other" (p. 16). The book was an expression of Halford's teleological view of the physical world against which all his scientific work was set. Thirty years later, in his pioneering book on the effects of snake venom, he asked again, "Who designed the snake that it should kill? My answer is - Some Omnipotent Power with infinite will. ... To those who study Nature, God is present everywhere, and I recognize him here."41 Frederick McCoy, Melbourne's Professor of Natural Science, turned to the Darwinian controversy in two public lectures on the Order and Plan of Creation which he gave in Melbourne in 1869 and 1870. McCoy held no degree, but he was a paleontologist with several works of systematic reference to his credit when he came to Australia in 1854 to fill the country's first Natural History Chair. A forceful and dogmatic figure who would yield to no one in 40 For the rise and manifestation of Social Darwinism in Australia, which lies outside the scope of this survey, see C. D.

In addition, he was a devout Anglican who conceived it as his duty to bring before the wider public the relations between the study of nature as an examination of demon- strable truth and the revealed truths of religion. Like America's foremost anti-Darwinian, Louis Agassiz, McCoy was an absolute creationist who based his authority on the positive proof offered by paleontology of the sudden appearance and disappearance of species. "So abrupt were the changes in species the paleontological record revealed," he contended, "that it was impossible not to conclude that species were called into being at certain periods and, in the case of the Australian mammals, in certain places." Evolution and Natural Selection found no place in his scheme of Nature. Instead, he saw the living world as "part of one great, complete, universal, perfect plan whose separate parts were brought into existence at His own different times, following laws some part of which we may dimly perceive."42 McCoy's rejection of evolution from his own work on the lower and higher animals and his explicit identification of the Mosaic story of Creation with known geological, chemical, and physical facts, carried his audience and gave authoritative force to anti-Darwinism in Melbourne. A decade later, however, it was in Melbourne, of all the colonial capitals, that evolutionary doctrine was to take its firmest root.43 At Sydney University the theory of evolutionary growth found few advocates until the century drew to a close. The Professor of Chemistry and Experimental Physics, Dr. John Smith, in a discussion on Lyells The Geo- logical Evidences of the Antiquity of Man (1863) at the Philosophical Society of New South Wales in 1863, conceded the point that there may have been a race of pre-Adamite men, but these, he believed, had been "entirely de- stroyed" to give place to the race of which we now had record.44 Clarke joined in the debate. He did not object, he said, to the addition of a few thousand years to the commonly received cosmogony, but he was disturbed by the implications it offered for the origins of man. Like some liberal English churchmen, Clarke could accept the evolutionary thesis where it kept man distinct, but he could not subscribe to a doctrine that held man descended from a race not endowed with the same faculties as our own. Yet even these mild modifications of scriptural evidence found no favour with other leading scientists in New South Wales. The Government Inspector of Coalfields, William Keene, was a strict Catastrophist, deeply opposed to any theory of gradual change; he proclaimed his distrust of Uniformitarianism and the whole theory of human antiquity in a letter to the press. Better evidence, Keene tartly suggested, would have to be produced before geologists could set aside prevailing beliefs in the Jewish cosmogony.45 42 The Order and Plan of Creation: A Lecture delivered before the Early Closing Associ- ation (Melbourne, n.d.), pp. 23, 31. 43 F.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 426</page><page sequence="17">EVOLUTION IN AUSTRALIA In Sydney in the 186o's, at least, Lyell's view of man's infinitely re- mote antecedents was judged unacceptable in theory and unscientific in fact. Only Macleay, in the privacy of his correspondence, made plain his con- currence with Huxley's classification of man zoologically with the apes. "I agree with Huxley," he wrote Clarke in June 1863, "and indeed ever since I have entered into the science of Comparative Anatomy have had no doubt that materially Man is a member of the Animal Kingdom closely allied to the Anthropoid Apes."46 In New South Wales the Anglican Church set the tone in its rejection of evolutionary opinion and radical intellectual thought. The Bishop of Sydney, Frederic Barker, had visited England in 1863 and had returned alerted and distressed. Barker, a strict and unsparing Evangelical, had found the Church in England fretted with uncertainty and dissent. Three years earlier the publication of the challenging Essays and Reviews had brought about a serious unheaval in public and church opinion. Following swiftly, the attack on traditional Church doctrine which Dr. John Colenso, the Bishop of Natal, launched in 1862, was a more violent stab inflicted at dangerously close range. Colenso, a prelate with a mathematical flair, had convinced him- self that the Old Testament writings contained much in their statements on people, time, and distance that was mythical and legendary, and he pub- lished his disturbing findings in The Pentateuch and the Book of Joshua Critically Examined (1862-79). It was hardly surprising, therefore, that Bishop Barker spoke darkly of "the miasma . . . floating in the moral atmosphere" and warned his Aus- tralian brethren of the moral epidemic of infidelity.47 If he feared an intellec- tual landslide to Colenso in his own bishopric, however, the words of the Sydney Morning Herald - that keen observer of Anglican interests- were designed, in some measure, to set his mind at rest. "We are not so enslaved by lawn sleeves," observed its editorial on 5 February 1863, "to think that a Bishop's infidelity must necessarily turn all the prophets and apostles out of doors." The Herald, for its part, would stand fast by Moses in preference to Colenso: "The Mosaic record remains one of the noblest books ever compassed by mortal agency. It is a book which contains the only rational account of the origin and present circumstances of humanity." In the more robust intellectual atmosphere of Melbourne, where evo- lutionary works were readily on sale, the Anglican clergy, at least, sensed the incipient dangers of an advancing and persuasive science, and sought the direction of their spiritual leader, Bishop Charles Perry. Perry responded to the appeal and in September 1869, when the appearance of Huxley's pamphlet Protoplasm, The Physical Basis of Life roused particular doubts in faithful minds, he delivered a two-hour public lecture on "Science and the Bible" at the Prince's Theatre, Melbourne. Intellectually, the lecture was a rare event, and the size of the crowd that gathered to hear the Bishop testi- fied to the considerable interest this contentious subject evoked.

For his demanding venture into the arena of Science versus Scripture, Bishop Perry had prepared himself with care; he had digested the Vestiges of Creation, the Origin of Species, Huxley's offending Protoplasm, and Lyell's Antiquity of Man, and had emerged unshaken from this encounter with evo- lutionary literature, with his faith in the Bible whole. Although it was clear that he had found the Origin a curiously absorbing book, he staunchly af- firmed of Darwin's illustrations of Natural Selection that "No one of them alone, nor the whole of them together, in the slightest degree corroborates his theory."49 Perry's serious concern remained with the creeping scepticism these evolutionary works engendered against Biblical truth. While Science had re- vealed some errors in the textual renderings of the Bible, he conceded, the Mosaic record had suffered nothing from its findings, and he took his audience through a quasi-scientific exposition of the six days of Creation, reviewed against the known periods of geological time. To this then widely-accepted theological argument, the Bishop added a resolute directive on the recent origin of man. Neither Science nor the discovery of ancient civilisations, he protested, could disturb the Christian's viewpoint that mankind had existed for no more than six thousand years, or challenge his acceptance of Adam's fatherhood of humanity and the second parenthood of Noah. Perry's dissertation was not the vituperative rejection of Science and all its concepts that had marred Bishop Samuel Wilberforce's outburst at Oxford nine years before. It was a traditional refutation by a theologian of the advancing claims of Science. But there was no Huxley present in Melbourne to refute the argument in 1869, and its warm reception by that educated audience reflected wide support for the Bishop's attack on evolutionary ideas. Even so, among the Melbourne clergy there were pockets of inde- pendent thought. Dr. John Bromby, headmaster of the Church of England Grammar School, announced his liberal version of man's antiquity in a public lecture later that year. Bromby pleaded for a new attitude to the Scriptures, which he believed should no longer be regarded as an encyclopedia of knowledge but as "ancient records . . . of unknown authorship replete with religious truth." "The traces of man's primeval existence," he proclaimed, "extend . .over the whole face of the earth, and backwards . . . to a period so remote that the 6,000 years advocated by Archbishop Ussher ... sink into insignificance."50 Within the Roman Catholic community there was no such dissent, and priests and Catholic laymen in the colonies contributed little to the gathering evolutionary debate.51 In Melbourne in 1871, Father J. O'Malley, S.J., went 48 A full report of the Bishop's speech is given in the Argus, 21 Sept. 1869, pp. 5-7. 49 Science and the Bible: A Lecture delivered by request, Monday, 20 September 1869 (Melbourne, 1869), p. 9. 60 Pre-historic Man: A Lecture delivered to the Early Closing Association (Melbourne, 1869); quoted in Smith, p. 306. 51 Their position in this respect differed little from that of their British counterparts.

Julian Tenison Woods, brought to bear in a paper on Australian tertiary geology in 1876. An empirical scientist whose pastoral duties had enabled him to engage in paleontological studies in South Australia, Tasmania, Queensland, and New South Wales, Woods offered his testimony from a solid body of observed facts. "During more than twenty years of researches in Australian tertiary geology," he declared, "I have carefully sought for any reasonable evidence in favour of evolution or clues to its mode of operation, but have found none - none whatever. I must add that Australian geology, whether reluctantly or not, must admit that she can urge nothing in favour of that theory being true - the true explanation of Nature as we find it."53 One of the few champions of Darwin in the Australian community of the 187o's was the German zoologist, Curator of the Australian Museum, Gerard Krefft. Krefft became a correspondent of Darwin and sent him copies of his papers, which, cogently critical of Owen's work on the fossil mammals of Australia, contributed directly to the ultimate dissemination in Australian scientific circles of Darwinian ideas. "I have long respected your able and indefatigable labours in the cause of Natural Science," Darwin wrote Krefft in 1872. "Your conclusion also agrees with that of Prof. Flower and others. It is lamentable that Prof. Owen shd. shew so little consideration for the judg- ment of other naturalists, and shd. adhere in so bigoted a manner to what- ever he has said. This is a great evil, as it makes one doubtful on other points about which he was written."54 In Sydney, the surveyor R. D. Fitzgerald, whose work on orchids de- rived much from Darwin's own, also carried on a correspondence with his scientific mentor.55 He despatched the parts of his works as they appeared and dedicated his completed Australian Orchids to Darwin on its final pub- lication in 1882. These men were exceptions. Seventeen years after Darwin's revolu- tionary thesis had appeared in the Origin, receiving as the years went by the underpinning and extension of collaborators, scientists, clergy, and the general public in Australia remained almost entirely unconverted to the evolutionary theme. The president of the new Linnean Society of New South Wales, Sir William Macleay, undoubtedly spoke for the great majority of Australian scientists in his inaugural address in 1876 when he declared against all evolu- tionary theories since Lamarck with the Scottish verdict of "Not proven": We know certain things. We know from the evidence of the rocks that species both of plants and animals have existed on the earth, which are now extinct. We know 52 Noah's Ark Vindicated and Explained: A Reply to Dr. Colenso's Difficulties (Mel- bourne, 1871). 53 "The History of Australian Tertiary Geology," Transactions of the Royal Society of Tasmania, 11 July 1876, p. 78. 54 Darwin to Gerard Krefft, 17 July 1872, Charles Darwin letters, Add 1/4 Mitchell Library, Sydney. 55 Four letters, Darwin to R.

And we know that no apparent variation can be traced in any existing species since the period assigned for man's first appearance on the globe. And it must be admitted that the testimony of the rocks, so far from giving ground for a theory of continuous modification of form, seems rather to afford proof that there may have been many successions of distinct creations at long intervening periods. Our knowledge of creation or of the order of creation, extends no further than this, notwithstanding the anxious efforts of the most accomplished men of the present and past generations. It seems really as if we had, at this point, reached the utmost range of the hiuman intellect.56 In England, by contrast, the climate of scientific opinion had matured significantly in the corresponding years. In his detailed analysis of Darwin and the General Reader (1958), Dr. Alvar Elegard has described the five posi- tions in the debate on species to which British scientists adhered. These were, briefly: i. Absolute Creation; 2. Progressive Creation (where species de- veloped mysteriously from the simplest organic form); 3. Derivation (which recognised the principle of descent in progressive evolution but allowed that this mechanism was only one of the secondary processes which the Creator employed); 4. Directed Selection (which admitted the efficacy of Natural Selection for a considerable number of specific differentiations, but relied on a teleological explanation as an indispensable part of the explanation of the organic world); and 5. Natural Selection (the scientific, non-teleological, non-supernatural explanation of the evolution of the whole organic world). Until 1863, attests Ellegard, the majority of British scientists clung to the two lowest groups. Ten years later, however, a significant leap forward had been made. By 1873, he notes, most scientists in England had embraced the compromise between science and theology which positions three and four allowed, while a tiny minority accepted Natural Selection for both the animal and the human world (p. 32). In Australia, some thousands of miles from the centres of discussion, where most influential scientists rejected evolutionary thought, this movement was inevitably delayed. Although Darwin himself was made an honorary member of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1879, and both Huxley and Hooker were awarded the Society's first scientific honour, the Clarke Medal, in 1881 and 1885, it would be another quarter century or more, and one in which the issues scientific and theological were more intensively re- viewed, before the contributions of Darwin and his successors would seri- ously affect Australian thinking and bring it into the mainstream of scientific thought.
