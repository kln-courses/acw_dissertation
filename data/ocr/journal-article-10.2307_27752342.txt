STUART HORSMAN In 1933 the USSR's highest mountain, Peak Stalin ((7,495 m), subsequently renamed Peak Communism and ultimately Ismail Somoni) was climbed as part of a large expedition, the Tajikistan-Pamirs-expedition (TPE).1 Several accounts of the expedition were published by Michael Romm (also known as Mikhail D. Romm). This article will focus on the 1936 English language edition of The Ascent of Mount Stalin (Ascent hereafter). Ascent provides a firsthand account of the planning and progress of the expedition, the climbing of Mount Stalin, and the physical and human landscape in which it took place. The expedition was a major scientific and mountaineering event, which involved leading Soviet scientific and political figures. Mount Stalin was the highest point in the USSR and the highest outside of the Himalayas to have been climbed at the time. This achievement was made and described by Romm in an overtly but changing ideological environment, during an increasingly dangerous political period within the USSR and in Europe more broadly, in which Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy also used exploration and mountaineering for national and ideological goals (Kenny 1991, p. 284). Mountaineering and exploration, and their literary representations have to be seen in their political context (Ellis 2002, p. 7). Analysing such literature can illustrate the ideological norms and context of the times in which they were constructed (Ellis 2002, pp. 7, 48). Romm's Ascent was no exception. Ascent, in many ways a standard exploration narrative, was constructed in a highly ideological and politicised environment. Whilst Ascent did not become a seminal text, it was an original and singular one. It was an officially sanctioned, first-hand account; a novel case study to examine 1930s official Soviet discourses on and the symbolism of landscape, both physical and human, and of the USSR's cultural, political and physical periphery. I would like to thank Dr Nick Megoran, Dr Denis Shaw, Professor Stephen Cunha, Dr Eva Maurer and the anonymous reviewers for their useful input and advice during the research and writing of this essay.

'The direct translation from the Russian 'pik' tends to use the word 'Peak' and would be better recognised in the climbing literature as such but throughout the book by Romm he uses the term 'Mount'. Following Romm's usage therefore, 'Mount' is used in the rest of this article.

The 1933 Tajikistan-Pamirs-expedition The TPE was one of a series of large scale, multi-disciplinary scientific expeditions in the Pamir mountains between 1928 and 1935. Similar expeditions with implicit ideological objectives, 'to build socialism', were carried out across the USSR (Hirsch 2003, p. 704). The Pamirs expeditions were significant events; 'a national matter to be financed by the state' (Rickmer Rickmers 1929, p. 219). Their collective abstracts and bibliography, published in 1936, comprised 249 pages alone (Middleton &amp; Thomas 2008, p. 437). The TPE's goal was to build on the 1932 Tajikistan-Complex-Expedition's (TKE) research on developing and modernising the Tajik Socialist Soviet Republic (TajSSR) and to exploit the republic's natural resources for Soviet industry's use. It differed from the TKE by focusing solely on the Pamir region and abandoning the TKE's agricultural and irrigation work (Romm 1936, p. 7). The TPE's 40 units surveyed the Pamirs for natural resources, mapped its landscape and recorded its weather, and one unit, the 29th, climbed Mount Stalin.2 The expedition had political resonance not just because of objectives in the Tajik SSR but also because of its participants. Among its cartographers, geologists, geographers, meteorologists and mountaineers were leading Soviet political and scientific figures. These included Nikolai Pertovich Gorbunov who had been Lenin's personal secretary and scientific advisor; Nikolai Vasil'evich Krylenko, the first Soviet Commander in Chief and, at the time of the TPE, Minister of Justice for the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic and a Chief Prosecutor in the Shakhty case of 1928, a major political show trial which heralded the onset of the Great Purge; and Evgenii Abalakov, one of two famous mountaineering brothers. Gorbunov and Krylenko were in fact both influential veterans of the 1917 Revolution and experienced explorers (Horsman 2002). The hook Ascent was the official record of the 1933 expedition. The 270-page text, accompanied by 30 black and white photographs and a single map of the Pamir range, was published in English in 1936. At least three Russian language versions were published: in 1934, 1936 and 1937. The 1934 edition was only 57 pages long, the 1936 edition was similar to the English version of the same year (268 pages) and the 1937 edition was only 200 pages long but with a preface by Gorbunov. Significantly, in the 1937 edition all the personal, subjective and potentially politically more dangerous material had been removed or reduced to the most banal and positive Soviet stereotypes/ This shift in the content of the Russian editions demonstrates the political environment in which Romm was operating. The choice of Gorbunov for the preface ^For more on the actual climbing of Mount Stalin see Horsman (2002). 3Author,s personal communication with E. Maurer (email), 11 December 2008.</page><page sequence="3">MICHAEL ROMM'S ASCENT OF MOUNT STALIN 1153 of the 1937 edition also showed how quickly the political landscape could shift. By 1938, he and the TPE's other leading light, Krylenko, were victims of the system that had so recently treated them as heroes (Horsman 2002, p. 204). Romm was internally exiled at the end of the 1930s (Mininberg 1998). He survived however. Gorbunov died in prison and Krylenko was executed. Romm, as a Moscow-based journalist, was aware of the wider domestic political context in which he was writing. He underplayed the broader political milieu throughout Ascenfs text however. This was probably a wise decision, though his subtle, considered and at times critical support for the Soviet system, seems with hindsight to have been political risky rather than balanced. In a rare moment of explicitly political commentary, Romm referred to the role of Krylenko (a leading member of the 1928, 1932 and 1933 expeditions) as prosecutor in the Shakhty trials stating that 'he [Krylenko] led the judicial struggle of the Soviet Government against counter-revolution' (Romm 1936, p. 115). Structurally Ascent followed the standard linear, chronological, directional pattern of exploration literature (Ellis 2002, p. 71). Thus it began in Moscow, with the goals, plans and key participants of the expedition being introduced. It then chronicled the TPE's travel to its base camp in Osh and subsequently the 29th unit's movement as it travelled towards Mount Stalin. Romm was a member of the 29th unit, which was personally led by Gorbunov. The book then described the actual ascent of Mount Stalin before concluding with the unit's return to Osh. Although the TPE was a major undertaking and the climbing of Mount Stalin a major mountaineering achievement, Ascent does not appear to have entered the canon of either the Soviet 'transition' or mountaineering literature. It does not appear to have had any impact, either immediate or residual, among either readerships. Ascenfs limited success may have been because there was actually little drama in the ascent and only a small proportion of the book was specifically devoted to climbing. The limited reference to the actual climb is not in itself unusual in such literature however (Ellis 2002, p. 71). Ascent's style may have been a factor in its limited impact. As a highly critical British reviewer argued (K.M. 1937, p. 18), Romm had little knowledge of mountaineering himself and wrote in a journalistic style, although the latter was an odd criticism given that Romm was a self-acknowledged journalist. The author, Michael Romm, was not very forthcoming about himself in Ascent. He was a football player, having played for the Russian national team before World War I.4 By 1933 he was a newspaper journalist, probably a sports reporter for Izvestia (Keys 2003, p. 429; Romm 1936, pp. 143, 173). He claimed to have been a boxer of some note and probably saw military service during the Revolution or the Civil War (Romm 1936, pp. 25, 159). As to his book commission, he simply stated he was to write a book on the expedition and send telegrams to 'the chief newspaper' (Romm 1936, p. 143). This seems a rather self-deferential reference to his reporting on such a significant Soviet scientific expedition. It does not help to uncover the Soviet authorities' real interest or motives behind the production of a report on it. As noted earlier, 1936 saw numerous scientific publications on the expedition (Middleton &amp; Thomas 2008, p. 437). It is conjecture but the Russian and English language edition of 4 Author's personal communication with E. Maurer (email), 11 December 2008.</page><page sequence="4">1154 STUART HORSMAN Ascent published in the same year may have been a general introduction to lay readers advertising this Soviet feat. The choice of British publisher, Lawrence and Wishart, suggests Ascent had some political value at the time of its publication. Lawrence and Wishart was an avowedly left-wing publishing house formed in 1936, partly from the British Communist Party's press. Ascent was part of their cannon of socialist and communist works.5 That said, however, it is now impossible to ascertain the publisher's and translator's interests or views of the book and its political significance. There is no record of the book in the archives of either Lawrence and Wishart or the translator, Alec Brown.6 Some of the former's records were destroyed during World War II. However it is probably fair to assume that Lawrence and Wishart thought the book significant given it was one of, if not the, first one they published. In addition, in his generally scathing review, K.M. accepted that 'the ascent of the highest mountain in Russian territory ... certainly merit[ed] a translation into English' (1937, p. 18). 1930s Soviet views on landscape Political regimes have frequently sought to represent, co-opt and manipulate landscapes to promote their own ideological and political objectives. These regime goals include legitimising their political and cultural hegemony and control of the physical and social space they inhabit (Azaryahu 1996, p. 311; Bassin 2000a, p. 250; Gill 2005, pp. 480-81). Whilst less overtly ideological regimes conceal or deny the extra-aesthetical symbolism of landscape, revolutionary and totalitarian regimes seek explicitly to emphasise it (Bassin 2000b, p. 314). They seek to present a single 'correct' interpretation of landscape, and prevent any alternative perspective. It is an instrument of their wider social and political transformative agenda (Azaryahu 1996, p. 320; Bassin 2000b, p. 314; Gill 2005, p. 480; Hirsch 2003, p. 691; Lefebvre 1991, p. 54). As Bassin (2000b, p. 315) has shown, however, providing a radical, singular and comprehensive, ideologically correct value to the exclusion of all other interpretations for a landscape can prove difficult even for totalitarian regimes. In addition, even in the most overtly ideological context, landscape is often portrayed as apolitical or even anti-political. Landscape is imbued with 'the impression of escaping from the realm of the social' (Bassin 2000a, p. 250).7 Thus a singular coherent symbolism is difficult to achieve. Even in the most ideological attempts at landscape representation there was often an inconsistency with a highly political and instrumental interpretation grating against an apolitical, romanticised one. As a 'propaganda state' the USSR sought a total shift in mass consciousness (Hirsch 2003, p. 687). As part of this process the USSR sought to interpret landscape in a novel and overtly ideological manner. Work by Bassin (2000a, 2000b) and Hirsch (2003) are key texts in understanding the evolution of Soviet thinking on its physical and cultural landscapes. Bassin focuses on the debates on landscape in early Soviet art ^Lawrence and Wishart website available at: http://www.lwbooks.co.uk/about.html, accessed 15 August 2008. 6Personal communications with the author, 30 September 2000 and 14 September 2001. 7For further discussion, see Ellis (2002, p. 63).</page><page sequence="5">MICHAEL ROMM'S ASCENT OF MOUNT STALIN 1155 and art criticism, whilst Hirsch analyses the virtual travel through the USSR's territory, past and present, created by exhibitions housed in the Ethnographic Department of the Russian Museum in Leningrad. The work of both authors highlights the intricacies and inconsistencies in the ideological framing of landscape and place. As noted by Bassin (2000b, p. 313), landscape, or the representation of it to be more precise, was seen as a means of conveying important Soviet messages and values. The depiction of landscape was ideological and used to portray 'a highly articulated message about the meaning, direction and destiny of society itself (Bassin 2000b, p. 318). However, Soviet landscape interpretation was not static; it shifted over time. Nor was landscape's ideological and symbolic value straightforward. Between 1917 and the late 1920s official Soviet attitudes towards landscape were essentially orthodox Marxist, although also influenced by traditional Russian attitudes on the subject. During this period, the natural world was perceived as a hostile entity to be tamed, transformed and perfected by Soviet society. A modern, technologically advanced and implicitly Marxist society could and should manipulate and use nature for the society's own requirements (Bassin 2000b, pp. 315, 322). Contemporary artistic representations of landscape were influenced by this progressive, human-centric approach. Representations of landscapes without 'any human-social presence at all' were to be avoided as they undermined any transformative message (Bassin 2000b, p. 315). By the mid-1930s, the period between the TPE and publication of Ascent, Soviet attitudes towards landscape were changing however. This was part of the broader 'Great Retreat', a shift from radical to conservative social and cultural policies (Keys 2003). In terms of landscape symbolism, there was a marked shift from the 'utilitarian and hard-headed sensibilities of the 1920s' (Bassin 2000b, p. 316). The transformation of nature and its material benefit to Soviet society were still important but not exclusive goals. The nature-human relationship could now be portrayed as one of 'organic harmony and ... eternal, unchanging rhythms' (Bassin 2000b, p. 316). Landscapes could now hold inherent qualities, autonomous from any social value. Nature could now be intrinsically beautiful. These 'autonomous' values attributed to landscape were in fact a return to far more universal, traditional ones, heavily influenced by nineteenth-century Russian nationalist and romantic ideas. The novelty was that they were being articulated as part of Stalinist cultural ideology (Bassin 2000b, p. 316). Landscape no longer had solely to symbolise the Soviet transformative agenda. However, the revival in the 'essential nature' did not result in a complete rejection of the ideological interpretation of landscape. It made the ideological narrative more complex and less stark. This shift took place against a backdrop of increased Communist Party control over the 'machinery of representation' (Hirsh 2003, p. 696). Portrayals of the USSR and its people were to be more closely managed. Thus whilst landscape representation may have appeared less rigid and less ideological in character, this 'naturalism' was directed from the centre with considerable authority. The TPE and Ascent took place during this period, a cusp in the transformation in Soviet ideological thinking towards landscape and exploration and their representa tion as instruments of Soviet hegemony. Thus study of the expedition and Romm's book allows an insight into these objectives in this period of intellectual flux and</page><page sequence="6">1156 STUART HORSMAN political uncertainty. The study will focus on three key themes in Ascent?transition (tradition and modernity); integration (centre-periphery relations); and the represen tation of landscape per se. It will seek to place Ascent into the wider Soviet and non Soviet literature on these debates, and examine to what extent the relevant academic literature can explain Romm's narrative. Ascent offers a novel, alternative case study on these subjects. Most research has to date focused on high literature and artistic interpretations of landscape in the USSR or very specific issues such as toponyms (Azaryahu 1996; Bassin 2000a, 2000b; Bown 1991; Ely 2002; Horsman 2006). However Ascent is part of a different canon? exploration and mountaineering literature. It was a far less overtly aesthetic, intellectual or ideological text. However as Ely (2002, p. 21) states in his relevant research on landscape and national identity in Tsarist Russia, 'the commonplace, even hackneyed ... [and] mundane', as well as the high art representations of landscape are valuable source material, worthy of study. The themes Transition (tradition and modernity) Romm's work can be assessed in relation to the 'classic Stalinist transformation narrative' of its period (Maurer 2009, p. 487; Hirsch 2003, pp. 683, 691.) Travel and ethnographic literature, which Ascent can be regarded as part of, shifted from an 'exoticising' to a 'modernising' discourse, after Stalin's 1929 declaration that the USSR was defeating 'backwardness' and moving rapidly towards socialism (Hirsch 2003, pp. 683, 696). It is therefore unsurprising to see a strong transformative theme in Ascent. Romm established a dynamic between a traditional, conservative reactionary past with an improved present and an even better future. This offered a 'highly articulated message about the meaning, direction and destiny' of Soviet society in keeping with intellectual currents of the time (Bassin 2000b, pp. 317-18).8 The expedition was the crucible in which this transformation was taking place. Shared hardship and experiences, political debate, modern technology and commu nications were the instruments of this transformation. Road construction, for example, removed the ancient caravan route with 'the wide ribbon of a high road, ... the rhythmic throb of high compression motors' bringing 'new forms of civilisation' (Romm 1936, pp. 33, 36-37). Romm used an alleged dispute and the resultant debate between the European climbers and their Kyrgyz porters over the death of one of the latter from altitude sickness, as a catalyst for this intellectual transformation conversion (1936, pp. 131, 141-46). Romm claims he was instrumental in the process of removing the porters' initial wariness and scepticism towards the expedition and the Soviet project as a whole (1936, pp. 141-46). He discussed the Soviet process of relocating the region from its past based in legend, mystery and tradition to a present and future founded on fact, rationalism and modernity. To paraphrase Romm, the Pamir's 'veil of legends [had only just been 8See also Hirsch (2003).</page><page sequence="7">MICHAEL ROMM'S ASCENT OF MOUNT STALIN 1157 removed] and this tremendous mountains uplands complex ... [was] put on the map of planned socialist construction' (1936, pp. 4, 33). The Tajik Socialist Soviet Republic, only established in 1929, was the poorest and least developed of the Soviet republics (Breu et al 2005, p. 139). It was being transformed by Soviet scientific endeavour including extensive exploration and research (Romm 1936, p. 5). This was the TPE's role; to establish 'a picture of the new technological and industrial possibilities and prospects of the country' (Romm 1936, p. 207). The past was portrayed in a strongly negative light and pre-Soviet social and political structures were criticised. Thus the traditional local Muslim human landscape was described as 'rigid ... [and] stagnant', hampered by 'medieval feudal relation ships ... patriarchal customs', 'slavery and exploitation' (Romm 1936, p. 3), inefficient agriculture, drug and women trafficking, syphilis, universal illiteracy and Islam (Romm 1936, pp. 35-36). Such criticisms of traditional structures were common in most Soviet literature of the time (Hirsch 2003, p. 694). These views were, for example, also echoed by the Soviet Tajik politician and leading historian, B. G. Gafurov (Sokol 1953, p. 174). Romm also criticised the previous Tsarist rule, albeit more mildly. He argued it had failed to modernise the region, address illiteracy, end oppressive and backward social and religious customs and deprived the local communities of their political rights (Romm 1936, pp. 14-15; Hirsch 2003, p. 694). Romm reported with satisfaction that the past was in abeyance however. The present, in two senses?a historical one (the Soviet period) and an immediate one (the actual expedition)?was liberating the Central Asian peoples from their Muslim and Tsarist pasts (Romm 1936, p. 14). Rationalism and science were replacing religion and superstition (Romm 1936, pp. 27-28). However Romm presciently noted the persistence of the pre-Soviet clan networks, something that was still evident at the end of the Soviet era (Khazanov 1994, p. 146). As Romm stated, the 'ancient struggle around the pastures was still going on, only masked by soviet forms' (Romm 1936, pp. 35-36). Other Soviet commentators and practitioners were also engaged in attempts to remove superstition and traditional power relations. Leningrad's Ethnographic Department, for example, was equally aware of the survival of traditional society but unlike Romm, was criticised for failing effectively to counter them in its ethnological exhibitions (Hirsch 2003, pp. 691, 706). Through the TPE's physical and intellectual work a brighter Soviet future was being created for the Tajik SSR (Romm 1936, p. 145). Romm's narrative strongly matched the contemporary views of the new society that was being constructed (Bassin 2000b, pp. 317-18). His imagined future for the Central Asian porters is one such example. Romm portrayed one of the porters as at a 'crossroads' between two alternative futures. One was the continuation of traditional life with its associations to Islam and patronage networks resulting in life as an emigre or Basmachi; the other was a 'long and difficult path, to study, to the KUTV or the Communist University of the Workers of the East, and to Moscow' (Romm 1936, p. 145). Soviet educational advances and opportunities for the Central Asians were a common feature of his narrative (Romm 1936, pp. 15, 145). Romm suggested that the better future was rapidly approaching the region. The transformation of the Pamirs was emphasised in passages on the speed of construction of the Osh-Khorog road and the transformation of a Soviet military outpost from a</page><page sequence="8">1158 STUART HORSMAN foodless, deserted ruin to a base able to host a celebration of Felix Dzerzhinki's life in the space of one year (Romm 1936, pp. 63-65). Similar narratives of enlightenment from 'poverty, ignorance ... backwardness [and] ... Islam' were 'a stock Soviet story' in official literature on Central Asia (Kamp 2001, pp. 3-4; Hirsch 2003, pp. 689-90). Similarly, Central Asia's future was to be found in the urban development of Stalinabad and Tashkent. Stalinabad was emerging from the 'chaos' of the traditional settlement of Dushanbe, with metalled roads, petrol cars and aeroplanes replacing the ox-wagon and the 'biblical silhouettes of camels on mountain tracks' (Romm 1936, pp. 3-4). In Tashkent a planned and orderly settlement had been created, in which modern services, amenities and educational opportunities were available (Romm 1936, p. 15). The transition from past through the present to the future was rapid, from feudalism to socialism within a generation (Romm 1936, p. 16). Modernity was not, however, an entirely positive development. Romm seemed to have held a romantic view of the periphery and its hardships. His narrative towards his return to Soviet normality and civilisation was not entirely positive. He made numerous references to political violence. Romm also makes reference to the lack of supplies available to a medical station he and the unit call on during their return. On a more personal level he claimed that when given the first chance in three months to sleep in a clean bed under a roof, he opted to sleep outdoors under the stars (Romm 1936, p. 264). Whether this is true or not it is illuminating. Modern society, for the returning wanderer, was not Utopian. It was not functioning properly. His ambivalence towards civilised society was, as Ellis points out, a common attribute in mountaineering literature: 'The mountain [was] a place apart, a refuge ... from the complexities at home' (Ellis 2002, p. 63). Romm was not accused of presenting a lively and interesting past and 'pale and uninspiring present' however, something that Leningrad's Russian Museum was charged with over its exhibitions of Soviet nationalities' past and present socio-economic modes (Hirsch 2003, p. 702). Integration (centre-periphery) As with all the other Soviet republics, the Tajik SSR was undergoing 'nation-building from above' during the 1920s and 1930s (Carlisle 1994, p. 73; Akiner &amp; Barnes 2001, p. 19). The TPE was part of this process, integrating this peripheral region into the Soviet mainstream. The expedition and its climbers were 'cultural ambassadors to the periphery' (Maurer 2009, p. 486; Hirsch 2003, p. 705). They were an elite vanguard of the Soviet mountaineering, scientific and in some instances, political communities. In the Pamirs, they carried out activist and unofficial diplomatic roles, promoting the benefits of their political system, offering aid and assistance and seeking to develop relationships with their Kyrgyz and Tajik hosts. Romm understandably, therefore, devoted considerable attention to issues concerning the periphery and its integration into the broader Soviet system. The periphery was 'vanishing' as it became integrated into the Soviet mainstream, physically and intellectually (Romm 1936, p. 33). The expedition acted as a form of inspiration, conversion and education, promoting the concept of a Homo Sovieticus, as did other scientific expeditions across the USSR (Hirsch 2003, p. 705). The Kyrgyz and Tajik porters' 'narrow world, limited by their native village ... [was now] linked up by</page><page sequence="9">MICHAEL ROMM'S ASCENT OF MOUNT STALIN 1159 some kind of threads with distant Moscow' (Romm 1936, p. 144). 'Their antiquated nationalistic feelings and aloofness from other people [were being abandoned and they] ... began to feel themselves part of one great country' (Romm 1936, p. 34). Class-consciousness and common Soviet identity was replacing parochial, sub national and religious identities (Romm 1936, pp. 34, 143-44). Modern forms of communication, transportation and education were key tools in this integration process. For Romm (1936, p. 36), the road and Revolution were intertwined. Without the former the latter's authority in the region would have been weaker. Significantly, in terms of discourse on the periphery and its integration into the mainstream, the final act of the book was the arrival of a motor car to take Romm and other members of the unit out of the Pamirs (Romm 1936, pp. 267-68). Modern civilisation had arrived. A similar modernising and integration message had been used by Schneiderov, who talked of the 1928 expedition's short-wave broadcasts 'which maintained connection ... [from] the distant Pamir ... to Moscow' (1930, p. 270). Cultural and physical differences and distance were central aspects of this integration narrative. Romm's perspectives on the periphery were not uniquely Soviet, however. Rather they corresponded with common traits that authors such as Daniels &amp; Cosgrove (1993), H?yrynen (2004) and Ellis (2002) have highlighted. These writers have demonstrated how peripheries have been represented in literature as representing 'otherness' from the 'civilised core', and 'distance and movement' from the safe, familiar metropole to the uncertain, dangerous, difficult periphery (H?yrynen 2004, pp. 5, 24; Ellis 2002, p. 71). Romm's narrative closely corresponds with Ellis' assessment of MacKinder's near contemporaneous The First Ascent of Mount Kenya. Ellis (2002, p. 71) describes MacKinder's narrative as 'a move from the familiar, comprehensible, controllable environment [of the metropole] ... to one of difficulty, conflict, danger and often cultural incoherence [at the periphery]'. Ascent closely mirrored this progression with, in the opening passage of text, Romm meeting Gorbunov in a sedate office in Moscow, setting the tone for the rest of the book. Soviet norms were evident in Romm's work, although not overplayed. Individual members of the TPE such as Gorbunov, Krylenko and Abalakov were experienced climbers and had visited the Pamirs before. In fact it is difficult to argue that Romm saw the Pamirs as a periphery in the sense of alien or hostile as MacKinder, Schneiderov or even the Ethnographic Department of the Russian Museum in Leningrad did (Ellis 2002; Schneiderov 1930; Hirsch 2003). Unlike Schneiderov, a Soviet filmmaker who accompanied the 1928 expedition, Romm did not suggest that the Pamir mountains were alien or unwelcoming. He actually made the Pamirs more immediate and accessible to his readers by using a more familiar periphery in Russian culture, Siberia, as a metaphor. When he discussed leaving Osh, he said he was 'going into distant exile' (Romm 1936, pp. 31-32). It is fairer to say that Romm saw the region's landscape and society as a cultural and geopolitical border, exotic but comprehensible and ultimately familiar in character. The mountain range was a geo-political boundary, 'our most advanced outpost in Central Asia' (Romm 1936, p. 50). From 'over the frontier came religious fanatics' and support for the Basmachi rebels (Romm 1936, pp. 37, 51). On this point his opinions differed little from local Soviet or post-Soviet views (Horsman 2005, pp. 205-09; MacFarlane &amp; Torjesen 2005, p. 14). He portrayed Central Asian characters</page><page sequence="10">1160 STUART HORSMAN in a paternal and possibly moderately patronising manner. Romm regularly mentioned their suspicious and superstitious nature. The local porters were, for example, 'afraid of the fearsome spirits of the mountains' who 'had thrown one of [the Europeans] down the side of the mountain' (Romm 1936, p. 141). However such traits Romm suggested were easily defeated with Soviet rationalism. As such the porters are shown as innocents, quickly won over to the TPE's mission and Soviet values by Romm's eloquence (Romm 1936, p. 144). However any Orientalism or cultural stereotypes evident in Ascent were mild and not extreme or uniquely Soviet. He was far more sympathetic towards the local communities than Schneiderov was for example. The latter described the lifestyle of the Kyrgyzs as 'semi-savage' though hospitable and easy-going (Schneiderov 1930, pp. 268-69). In doing so he fitted perfectly Rickmer Rickmers' (1929, p. 215) excellent anti-Orientalist critique: 'the popular mind places every explorer into a country peopled by savages'. Soviet attitudes had not dramatically improved two decades later when a Soviet commentator referred to the Sherpas as heroic but 'nameless coolies' of the 1953 'imperialist' ascent of Everest (Maurer 2009, p. 487). Romm (1936, pp. 146, 165) in fact emerges in a favourable light, talking of the Kyrgyz and Tajik porters as 'conscious and equal participants] in our difficult and dangerous task'. Even the far more culturally sensitive and articulate Rickmer Rickmers (1929, pp. 219, 222) talked about 'Europeans' and 'servants' and called the Tajiks 'an unenterprising race'. References to distance and movement were common in Ascent. They were both narrative tools, a means of propelling the book, and also constant subjects of interest for Romm who used these two spatial devices to underpin Ascent. However as Ellis (2002, p. 71) and H?yrynen (2004, p. 24) have shown, distances travelled and time taken, as well as modes of transport, are also important symbols in discourses on peripheries. Modes of transport, rail, road, horse, camel, foot and even a proposed aircraft flight, were discussed at length by Romm. In an alleged exchange between Romm and two of the porters, both otherness and distance, characteristics of the periphery discourse, were combined. The porters asked Romm why he wrote so much about what appeared to them normal and mundane. Romm replied that what he was witnessing was alien, novel and different as his kibitka (tent or home), Moscow, was 'four days by train' from Tashkent and even more from the Pamir camp they were then in (1936, p. 91). In the final section, distance and dislocation are again conjured up by the arrival of month old letters and newspapers that had travelled 'thousands of miles from Moscow, Leningrad, Siberia and Paris' to base camp. Reading out-of-date news papers, Romm emphasised the significant socio-political events of Soviet life from which he had been long separated. These included the opening of the White Sea-Baltic Canal, a football match and, perhaps most significantly, 'the party purge proceeding in ... Moscow' (Romm 1936, pp. 229-30). As with other themes in the final third of the book, Romm appeared to be attempting to reintegrate himself, the expedition and the narrative into the wider Soviet reality. In his attempt to do so, he did not always refer favourably to the social and politicised world he was re-entering. Conflict and danger were evident in Ascenfs periphery. They emerged from both natural and human sources. Basmachi, kulaks and other counter-revolutionaries were the principle sources of human danger but there were a variety of natural risks</page><page sequence="11">MICHAEL ROMM'S ASCENT OF MOUNT STALIN 1161 including avalanches, malaria and frostbite. They were also an impediment to the Soviet transformative agenda, although Romm did not labour this point (Hirsch 2003, p. 706). As Romm noted, the Pamirs were one of the last areas of the USSR to emerge from civil war (1936, pp. 3-21). At one point the natural and security dangers were combined with a tale of a group of Basmachi suffering from serious frostbite (Romm 1936, pp. 257-58). However Romm, as always, did not fully adhere to a singular and correct ideological interpretation. His 'periphery as danger' narrative was fair and balanced. Significantly the social landscape of Central Asia's villages and roads was no more secure than the natural mountain environment. The presence of the Basmachi, evident throughout the book, became almost an omnipresent feature in the final chapters of the book when he returned to the settled valleys (Romm 1936, pp. 247, 253, 256-60). He did not romanticise or glorify the periphery's danger for political or literary effect. Nor did he suggest that the physical and ideological ends, reaching Mount Stalin's summit, entirely justified the costs, the deaths of two individuals. The plaque erected to record the ascent was accompanied by one dedicated to the climber and porter who died during the expedition. He stated that '[mjourning [and] inevitable sacrifices' tempered 'the magnificent victory of our Soviet climbers' (Romm 1936, p. 221). The impression given to the reader is that of an anti-climax and an achievement marred by the loss of life. After the death of the climber, Romm referred to a fellow climber as 'quite broken' and claimed that Gorbunov, the TPE's leader, was worried that the news could undermine the morale of the entire unit. Romm's response on hearing of the death implied a life had been unnecessarily cut short (1936, p. 102). This apolitical, risk-averse narrative was markedly in contrast with contemporary Nazi and fascist discourses on mountaineering and its inherent dangers which would glorify the death of a mountaineer (Ellis 2002, p. 49). The most heroic language Romm could muster was Gorbunov declaring that the peak must be reached 'at all costs ... [as it is] a task set by the Government' (1936, p. 150). The lack of glorification of danger may be partly because of recent Russian and Soviet history. Some of the TPE, possibly including Romm, had fought in the Revolution and Civil War, some against the Basmachi. However, probably more importantly, unlike the rightwing totalitarian ideologies communism did not have an ideological fascination with conflict and death. This helps explain why the TPE, and mountains and mountaineering more generally, had limited symbolic value to the Soviet cultural agenda. Representations of landscape Romm's representations of the Pamiri landscape reflected the shift in Soviet attitudes towards landscape during the 1920 and 1930s. As Bassin's research suggests, it contained the complex, even contradictory, view of landscape prevalent at the time. The TPE's raison d'etre was to give the Pamirs a social value, placing humans and their needs at the centre of its landscape. Consequently these themes are prevalent in the book, particularly in its early chapters. Until the region had been mapped and surveyed it had no social value. It could not be possessed and utilised by the USSR. So there were regularly, for example, references to 'the mysterious western edge of the</page><page sequence="12">1162 STUART HORSMAN Pamirs mountain plateau [which] till recently appeared on the map as a blank area', or 'the last secrets of the blank areas of the Pamirs', which the TPE was finally addressing (Romm 1936, pp. 2, 9). This strongly corresponded with Il'in's claim in 1931, as reported by Hirsch, that the first Five Year Plan (1928-1933) would turn 'empty spaces' into 'green pastures and cultivated lands' (Hirsch 2003, p. 384). To some extent Romm also portrayed some of the uninhabited landscape in a negative light. Thus the moraine landscape was 'chaotic, senseless ... confusion', 'oppressive ... and mono tonous' (Romm 1936, pp. 106, 108). This valueless landscape contrasted with the more familiar, accommodating and human landscape of the Osh Valley with is vines and cultivated fields, favourably described by the author (Romm 1936, p. 206). Ascenfs photographs are perhaps the strongest evidence of the Soviet landscape aesthetics of the late 1920s, which emphasised human-centric landscapes, where nature was being transformed for the benefit of society. The images of motor vehicles on the Pamir highway and the newly constructed metrological observatory looking across snow-capped mountains were exemplary representations of 'industrial landscapes' (Romm 1936, pp. 33, 225). Such images of development and human domination of landscape testify to 'Soviet society's efforts to transform the environment' (Bassin 2000b, pp. 323-24). However in some of these photographs, the commitment to this agenda seemed cursory. It was only the accompanying text that provided the correct Soviet transformative interpretation in some cases. A similar piecemeal approach to making 'traditional' images ideologically correct took place at the Ethnological Department of Leningrad's Russian Museum. The curators simply relabelled old exhibits with 'scripts about the revolution's accomplishments' (Hirsch 2003, p. 693). However Romm's view of the mountain landscape was more sensitive than that of the filmmaker Schneiderov. The two shared the cliched language of mysterious and blank spaces but Schneiderov was far more dismissive and less enamoured of the landscape. He called the Pamirs 'wild', 'severe and inhospitable' and its fauna was of little merit. He claimed the term '[f]oothill of death' best described this region (Schneiderov 1930, pp. 266-69). Romm and Schneiderov's different attitudes may reflect the shift in official discourse towards landscape appreciation between the late 1920s and the mid-1930s. However it may have also been as much a result of differences in their own personal preferences. Romm appeared to be a far more empathetic writer than Schneiderov. In addition, rather than presenting a single politicised interpretation of landscape, Romm appeared to modulate his analysis dependent upon the type of landscape he was viewing. Thus in the journey across the Central Asian Steppe and foothills to Osh, and the return from high altitude to the Tajik and Kyrgyz settlements he presented an ideological, socialised narrative. Away from society and human habitation, Romm's narrative became far less politicised, more escapist and more positive towards nature. In fact his criticisms of the moraine landscape were the exception. And such landscapes are difficult and demoralising for any mountaineer. Romm's comments on the moraines were thus understandable and do not necessarily reflect his general view on uninhabited landscape. In fact most of his references to the non-human environment were positive, bordering on the romantic. Romm's approach was, whether intentionally or otherwise, within in the norms of mid-1930s Soviet thinking.</page><page sequence="13">MICHAEL ROMM'S ASCENT OF MOUNT STALIN 1163 He valued the landscape for both its intrinsic as well as its instrumental value. His writing echoes the revival of traditional, romantic nineteenth-century attitudes towards landscape that Bassin (2000b, p. 316) notes was taking place in the 1930s. The mountain was not a place to be eschewed because of its peripheral, asocial character. Instead it was a place of unfettered beauty, vitality and value. It brought 'health and strength. Anyone who has spent time in the mountains will return there again and again, unless he is a hopeless town dweller or an international-express gentleman' (Romm 1936, p. 130). At the key moment of human triumph over nature, Abalakov's solo climbing of Mount Stalin, Romm placed the climber uncritically in a landscape devoid of human agency?'a grandiose design of glaciers and ranges ... the grandest mountain complex in the world' (Romm 1936, p. 214). Elsewhere Romm referred to 'the poetry of the mountains' (1936, p. 131). Thus he was able to freely describe the Pamirs as 'incomparable' and 'beautiful' (Romm 1936, pp. 46, 232). He also gave nature an intrinsic worth above and beyond its value to society when he stated that the 1928 climbers 'were defeated by the charm of those spaces where the foot of man had never trodden' (Romm 1936, p. 115). Such terms were devoid of any transformative or Marxist ideological symbolism. They were views a Soviet author may have struggled to use five years previously as evident in Schneiderov's more critical landscape appreciation. As Bassin has noted, the new romanticised norm was evident in the view of Chegodaev, a contemporary Soviet art critic, who described nature as having 'elemental power' and 'cosmic scope' (Bassin 2000b, p. 316). This language was mirrored by Romm's description of'landscape [that has] an evocative power that is universal and remarkable' (1936, p. 250). Romm's text may therefore be regarded as an early, possibly unwitting marker of this new, and more conservative and romantic appreciation of landscape. Escapism was a strong element in Romm's landscape narrative. As Bassin notes, even in the most ideological environment there was a strong element of landscape narrative that emphasised 'the impression of escaping from the realm of the social into something more natural and therefore more genuine and appreciable' (Bassin 2000a, p. 250). Gautier, one of the climbers, Romm claimed, 'loved the expansive and carefree ways of ... climbing expeditions, so different from the routine existence of towns' and another loved 'being alone with the vast [mountain] world' (1936, pp. 26, 187-88). These romantic and individualistic views were out of place in contemporary Soviet landscape thinking. They were also, and remain, a universal theme, even a cliche, in most mountaineering literature. Similar views were expressed by a British climber in MacKinder's Kenya expedition who talked about 'being as free as Nature' (Ellis 2002, p. 63). The multiple and at times confused attitude towards landscape was also evident in the book's accompanying photographs. As noted above, human-centred, transforma tive and industrial landscape images were prominent among them. However other photographs corresponded with the appreciation of landscape for its own sake, as in that titled The Vast Massif of Mount Stalin ... Glittering With ... Frozen Snow (Romm 1936, p. 144). Others were more voyeuristic and Orientalist in character, for example Tadjikian Girls at Horog (Romm 1936, pp. 48, 72). In neither of these cases did they advance a progressive ideological agenda or criticism of the images they portrayed.</page><page sequence="14">1164 STUART HORSMAN Conclusion Whilst Ascent was not a seminal text, it was not a commonplace, mundane journalistic piece as the hyper-critical Geographical Journal reviewer suggested. As Ely (2002, p. 21) notes, even if it were mundane and commonplace this should not preclude Ascent from being a valuable research opportunity. It remains a unique text worthy of serious study. Importantly, it was an officially sanctioned firsthand report on a major expedition involving senior Soviet scientific and political figures during which time the third highest ascent in the world was achieved. Most importantly it, and the other editions, were written in a highly ideological and politicised environment. Consequently it provides useful information about official discourses on the ideological utilisation of landscape by the USSR in the 1930s. It also provides a comparative case study to Bassin and Bown's analysis on landscape artists and critics. The book did not come to symbolise the Soviet transition agenda because it proved difficult to utilise the image of the mountain for ideological goals and because the expedition's leading figures were to become enemies of the state, making the whole endeavour politically suspect. Similarly, public interest in exotic, border regions was not to be encouraged, for these areas symbolised danger, foreign contamination and subversion, as evident in accusations levelled against Soviet and post-Soviet 'traitors' (Horsman 2005, pp. 205-09). This was certainly the case by 1937 when the political context was shifting, as reflected in the shorter, more factual Russian language edition of Ascent9 Intriguingly, although considerable resources were invested in the preparation of the TPE and the resultant scientific outputs, there was little attempt to utilise the expedition or Romm's account for ideological purposes. Analysis of Ascent supports and mirrors Hirsch's (2003) conclusions on 1930s virtual tourism. For Hirsch, virtual tourism 'was supposed to teach the population how to think about the past, the present and the future and to help the actual peoples of the USSR imagine themselves into the emerging developmentalist narrative of Soviet-sponsored evolution and achievement' (2003, p. 696). Soviet landscape representations, including Ascent, were supposed to promote the same agenda. However, neither the mountain nor Ascent provides an entirely satisfactory symbol or vehicle for communicating Soviet values or norms to a broader audience. The ideological problems of a non-anthropomorphic landscape, the transition within official Soviet landscape appreciation, and the political sensitivities around the expedition, especially its leading personnel, all conspired to prevent this. Romm's attitudes toward the landscape he experienced in 1933 initially appear to be apolitical, unideological and confused. However, as others (Bassin 2000b; Hirsch 2003; Maurer 2009) demonstrate, the shifting and confused traits evident in Ascent can be explained by reference to the broader and difficult shift in cultural thinking in 1930s USSR. Romm was neither apolitical nor unique. Rather he was facing the same inherent contradictions as his peers, some possibly far more schooled in the nuances of Soviet ideology, landscape appreciation and art criticism (Bassin 2000b, p. 313). Study of Romm's Ascent supports the contention that at the very heart of 1930s Soviet attitudes towards landscape there was tension between anthropocentric transforma 9Author's personal communication with E. Maurer (email), 11 December 2008.</page><page sequence="15">MICHAEL ROMM'S ASCENT OF MOUNT STALIN 1165 tion and appreciation of nature for its own autonomous and inherent qualities (Bassin 2000b, p. 326). Whilst representations of landscape were politicised, 'the ambiguous and even contradictory nature of the messages' could not be removed. Political priorities could not entirely displace pastoral sensibilities (Bassin 2000b, pp. 313, 326). Romm should not be censured for an inability to address this ideological problematic. He was not alone in battling with this contradiction (Hirsch 2003, p. 686). Nor was his honesty about the problems of implementing the Soviet transformation agenda unique. Other authors faced and failed the same challenge (Hirsch 2003, p. 706). Romm's narrative illustrates the problems experienced by servants of a totalitarian and overtly ideological regime in its attempt to enforce and adhere to a single and 'correct' interpretation of landscape (Bassin 2000b, p. 314).
