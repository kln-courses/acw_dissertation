Contextual meanings in policy discourse: A case study of language use concerning resource policy in the New Zealand high country SIMON SWAFFIELD P. O. Box 84, Lincoln University, Canterbury, New Zealand, E-mail: swaffies@lincoln.ac.nz Abstract. Variation in the meaning and use of the term 'landscape' by different decision makers and decision influencers in the New Zealand high country is analysed in relation to the way they describe a resource policy issue. The case study is based upon documentary sources and oral accounts of the role that trees might play in high country land use. Links between language use and interest are identified and explored, and some consequential implications discussed. Introduction Contextuality was central to Lasswell's initial conception of the policy sciences (1970), and the subsequent development of interpretive approaches to policy analysis has reinforced this focus (eg. Dryzek, 1982, 1987, 1990; Healy, 1986; Torgerson, 1985; Yanow, 1987, 1993, 1995). As a result, social and political scientists now widely accept that the meanings of words and concepts in public policy vary according to the setting in which they are used. This increasing attention to the meanings of particular terms used in policy discourse (Chock, 1995) reflects a wider 'linguistic turn' in the social sciences. Meaning is 'not something that can be taken for granted' (Yanow, 1995: 111), and even the most commonplace terms become problematic. Language expresses the different 'thought styles' (Douglas, 1986) developed in different disciplines and institu- tions, and competing groups use different language to describe and analyse the 'same' issue, while the same word may be used to mean different things according to the particular intentions and interests of the users (Stone, 1988). Language is also political (Laitin, 1988), and power to name and define relations through language translates into the power to define policy issues and formulate re- sponses (Edelman, 1971). The case for a 'contextual' approach to understanding language use in policy formation is thus well established. Ascher therefore argued that the main issue has become 'to show how it ought to be done' (1987: 3). To this might be added, 'and explain the significance of the findings'. The purpose of this article is to report on a case study that investigated the contested and contextual use of language in oral accounts of a resource policy issue. Multiple analyses were used to provide insight into the way in which differences in meaning expressed by policy actors are related to the way they conceptualised an issue, and how this in turn relates to their role and interest in the broader policy environment. The particular focus is on the uses of the</page><page sequence="2">200 term 'landscape' by decision makers and decision influencers involved in policy formation concerning the role and management of trees and plantations in the New Zealand South Island high country. The choice of 'landscape' as a focus reflects its increasingly contentious use in resource policy formation in New Zealand and elsewhere (Swaffield, 1993). The essence of the argument is that different meanings of 'landscape' have been adopted by different interest groups to support competing interpretations of the issue of trees in the high country. These patterns of usage are influenced both by longstanding professional advocacy for particular meanings of 'land- scape', and by contests between different interest groups during a period of radical reform of government ideology and institutions. Plurality in meaning of particular terms is seen by some participants as problematic. However, this article argues that contests over meaning are inevitably embedded within policy discourse. The challenge for policy analysis is to develop methods of interpre- tation which reveal the significance of difference. The article is set out as follows. First, the policy context is described. Second, the historical evolution of 'landscape' meaning and usage in New Zealand is summarised. Third, the analytical approach is explained, and the results of the analysis of 'landscape' meaning and usage presented. Fourth, differences in meaning are interpreted as expressions of different advocacy positions. Finally, a number of implications are discussed. Trees in the New Zealand high country The policy context for the study is the potential role and future management of trees and plantations in the eastern South Island high country, which is the term used to describe the mountainlands and high elevation forests and grasslands of New Zealand. High country has been variously defined, but applies generally to land over 300 m in elevation. The South Island high country covers approx- imately six million ha, the majority of which falls to the east of the main divide of the Southern Alps, and comprises ranges, broad valleys and high altitude basins, all lying in the rain shadow of the alps. Once extensively forested, the eastern high country has gradually become characterised by scrub and open grassland under the combined pressures of climate change and natural fires (Molloy, 1963/64). The transformation to grassland was accelerated first by the hunting practices of early Polynesian settlers, and latterly by European pastoralists (O'Connor, 1986). Now, after some 150 years of extensive pastor- alism, the management of the high country is at crisis point. Land degradation, accentuated by localised invasion of rabbits and the creeping hawkweed (Hi- eracium sp.), combined with uncertain agricultural commodity prices, and in many cases cumulative farm debt, means that the sustainability of traditional high country land occupancy and land use practice is in serious doubt (Hughes, 1991). A number of factors contribute to make the issue particularly complex.</page><page sequence="3">201 Fig. 1. South Island high country. Despite its historical transformation to grassland, much of the high country retains a biological potential for reversion to forest. Imported exotic trees such as Pinus contorta have demonstrated their potential to spread from existing plantations as self sown wildings (Ledgard, 1988). Furthermore, commercial afforestation using exotic species has been identified as a possible land use option giving economic returns in many areas (Belton, 1991). However, the tussock grasslands have become a symbol of both individual and national iden- tity (Dominy, 1993; Ansley, 1994). Threats of wilding spread and the prospect of afforestation have therefore led to vigorous opposition to proposed land use diversification, particularly from largely urban based recreation and conserva- tion lobbies (Harding, 1990). The choice between trees and pasture has thus become a major resource policy issue (O'Connor, 1983). The incipient conflict of interest over trees in the high country was brought into sharper focus in the 1980s by radical changes in New Zealand government policy and organisation (Boston, 1990). Central government has taken an active role in high country management since European settlement in the 19th century, both as the dominant land holder and manager, and more recently through extensive fiscal intervention in agricultural land use by means of price subsidy, research and direct investment. Since the election of the reforming Labour government in 1984, however, organisational restructuring, the removal of sub- sidies, and an ideological shift towards a greater emphasis upon market mech- anisms has placed greater responsibility upon territorial authorities and local land managers, requiring more explicit delineation of individual and collective interests. The motivations and processes of change have been complex, but in</page><page sequence="4">202 essence involved radical redefinition of the role of the state, and a dramatic restructuring of existing government agencies (Boston, 1990). The two largest agencies involved in high country policy (Department of Lands and Survey and the New Zealand Forest Service) were disestablished and replaced by a larger number of more functionally specific organisations. Reserves, national parks and forest parks became the responsibility of a new Department of Conserva- tion. Commercial forestry was corporatised. Government-owned agricultural land was also corporatised, although high country leasehold land remained the responsibility of a much reduced 'Lands' department. Although many former agencies were disbanded, a new policy ministry, the Ministry for the Environ- ment, was created, with responsibility for system reform. Several other related changes took place over the decade after 1984. Local government reform reduced the number of territorial authorities and intro- duced a full two-tier system (regional and local). Land use planning was also reformed, with a significant shift in emphasis to a model of resource management based upon private ownership of resources, within a public policy framework that establishes minimum performance standards in terms of environmental effects of activities (Buhrs and Bartlett, 1993). The dominant reform theme has been to develop more functionally discrete and commercially oriented structures, with increasing reliance upon market mechanisms for the allocation of services and for management of resources. Government intervention is reduced and fiscal subsidy of different sectors re- moved. One result of the change in approach has been that a formerly dominant advocacy coalition (Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith, 1993) comprising runholders, government administrators, scientific conservation advocates and land use pro- fessionals, all supporting government subsidised multiple objective land use in the high country, has been fragmented and overturned. While a new era of accountability and transparency (Deane, 1986) has forced a separation of former interests, new coalitions have also emerged. The farming lobby has now largely adjusted to the concept of full market exposure, a change that has been assisted by the progressive privatisation of formerly public assets. Thus the then Minister of Conservation, Dennis Marshall, was quoted in 1994 as advocating 'a decent divvy-up of the [pastoral lands] resource' (cited in Ansley, 1994). Radical changes of personnel within the central government public sector have introduced a new generation of policy analysts and advisers with a strong ideological commitment to privatisation and more market oriented structures and policy. As one commented: 'Land owner commitment to con- servation grows in accordance with their property rights'. At the same time, however, urban based recreation and conservation groups have become more influential (Buhrs and Bartlett, 1993), and have significantly replaced the polit- ical advocacy formerly carried out by conservation scientists. Their role is now either institutionalised (in the Department of Conservation) or commercialised (in Crown Research Institutes). A coalition of interests between central government (both politicians and administrators) and runholders (land managers) remains, but it is now refo-</page><page sequence="5">203 cussed on policies of non-intervention and privatisation of assets. Other former members are now excluded. At the local level, former administrators and scien- tist/advocates within government agencies have either lost their roles or had them redefined more narrowly. At the time of the case study interviews in 1988/89 (see below) a number of these formerly influential actors were involved in advocacy to re-establish their positions. Public interest groups, on the other hand, had become better organised and more assertive within the more open and politicised policy environment. The policy context for the study was thus a complex field of conflicting interests and shifting advocacy coalitions. Multiple meanings of 'landscape' The term at the focus of the study, 'landscape', has been described as important, slippery, ambiguous and just plain difficult (Meinig, 1979; Relph, 1981; Jackson, 1984). The word regularly features in discussions of environmental issues, yet carries a range of meanings. Hartshorne (1939) concluded that early academic usage of 'landscape' was characterised by confusion and ambiguity due to the uncritical mixing of meanings derived from German (landschaft) that emphas- ised areal concepts such as territory, and English (landscape) that emphasised pictorial concepts such as scenery. More recently, both Relph (1981) and Cos- grove (1985) have explored ideological dimensions of 'landscape', and shown links between its meaning and the social interests involved in its use. New Zealand usage of 'landscape' draws upon both 'pictorial' and 'areal' meanings (Swaffield and O'Connor, 1986). The term was introduced into New Zealand with European settlement, and initial usage in relation to high country issues was dominated by traditional English meanings. Thus 'landscape' was used by early travellers to describe panoramic views and scenery. It was also used in reference to possibilities for improvement of land (Shepherd, 1969). Towards the end of the nineteenth century new uses emerged, as botanical scientists started describing the appearance of vegetation communities in terms of 'landscape' (Cockayne, 1899). Scientific usage was extended during the first half of the twentieth century as 'landscape' was used to describe landform (Speight, 1915; Cotton, 1922), soil systems (Taylor and Pohlen, 1962), and geo- graphical regions (Cumberland, 1940). At the same time, the concept of land- scape gardening was increasingly used in urban settings (Challenger, 1974), and became the focus of a significant contest for professional legitimacy between different groups involved in park development and urban planning (Swaffield, 1993). During the 1960s, debate over the impact of public works projects stimulated more widespread usage of 'landscape' in support of policies for scenic preserva- tion. Salmond (1960) linked the emerging profession of landscape architecture with his attack on the impact of development, particularly roads and power lines, arguing for the use of landscape architecture for 'blending of roadworks into the landscape so that the road and the landscape are part of the same scene' (1960: 21).</page><page sequence="6">204 This led to two further developments. During the 1970s and early 80s the profession of landscape architecture (which was newly established in New Zea- land) conflated the idea of 'landscape' with that of environment in an attempt to define and legitimise a professional role in planning (Swaffield, 1993). At the same time, conservation scientists and advocates increasingly used the idea of 'natural landscape' in conservation policy formation. By the period immedi- ately before the 1984 reform, 'landscape' had come to feature significantly in policy discourse concerning high country. The 1977 Reserve Act, for example, included in its goals 'the preservation of representative samples of all classes of natural ecosystem and landscape which in aggregate originally gave New Zea- land its recognisable character'. The 1981 Draft New Zealand Conservation Strategy (Hughes, 1981) adopted a similar usage: 'Natural vegetation... is an integral part of the physical landscape environment' (1981: 14). Both the landscape architecture profession and conservation advocates, many of whom were also employed as scientists within government research agencies, used 'landscape' as part of their advocacy for a policy of active government intervention into land use. Their stated goal was to conserve and enhance the 'naturalness' of the New Zealand environment and its associated visual qualities. This usage was largely accepted and adopted by government administrators. The 1979 Government Policy Statement 'Deciding the use of high mountain resources' included commitment to: - 'the preservation of natural landscapes of outstanding scenic quality and the creation and preservation of cultural landscapes of high quality'; However, one important feature of such usage in high country policy formation was the relatively small numbers of people involved. Published usage of 'land- scape' was largely limited to a few influential advocates, and was notably absent from the discourse of foresters and agricultural scientists. There was no mention, for example, of 'landscape' issues within the 1977 indigenous forest policy (NZ Forest Service, 1977). Usage of 'landscape' as a policy term in relation to high country in the period before 1984 was thus promoted by two groups (professio- nal landscape architects and conservation advocates), accepted and adopted by the government administrators responsible for high country policy, but largely ignored by other interest groups. Contemporary frames of reference and meanings of 'landscape' Although documentary sources provide an extensive record of historical lan- guage use, they constitute an 'opportunistic' sample; we can only read what has been written down and published or filed. In order to provide a more com- prehensive coverage of contemporary usage, the strategy used in this study was to analyse spoken language obtained from interviews with a range of key informants. This approach meant that examples of language use could be</page><page sequence="7">205 obtained from all the main interest groups in the policy context under inves- tigation. However, pilot studies revealed that explicit reference to 'landscape' as a focus of interest in interviews immediately prestructured the meanings assigned to it by policy actors. Therefore, a'blind' approach was adopted, based on depth interviews ostensibly seeking actors' views upon the substantive policy issue of the role and management of trees and plantations in the high country. No initial reference to any specific research interest in the term 'landscape' or its relation- ship to policy was made. However, at a late stage in the interview reference to 'landscape' was included, in order to test the extent to which usage by an actor was sensitive to expressed interest. The interview transcripts were analysed in three phases. First the overall structure of each individual account of the role of trees and plantations in the high country was analysed. Next, the analysis focused upon the specific role and meanings of the term 'landscape' within these accounts. This made it possible to relate usage of 'landscape' to the microscale context in which it was used. In the third and final phase the analysis was extended to relate the patterns of usage revealed in the interviews to broader social and political trends and factors. The concept of frame of reference The concept used to analyse and classify the accounts given by the different actors involved was that of a 'frame of reference'. The metaphor of a frame has been used in several theoretical traditions. In cognitive psychology, the idea of 'framing' (Bardwell, 1991) has been widely used to describe the mental processes by which individuals simplify their perceptual and social environ- ment in order to make it conceptually manageable (Kelly, 1963; Eiser, 1986). In contrast, 'framing' concepts used in discourse analysis (Potter and Wetherell, 1987) focus upon people's oral and written explanations, and refer to the structure of a person's account of a particular situation or phenomenon. Situa- tional policy analysis uses the idea of.'frame of reference' to refer to the shared institutional context and assumptions that people bring to a policy issue (Walther, 1987; Dunster, 1987). It suggests that people from similar institu- tional backgrounds, or with similar roles, will tend to conceptualise resource policy issues in similar ways, and that the meaning of specific terms may derive, in part, from the shared values of a wider group of people, for example a professional institution (Douglas, 1986). Frames can thus be conceptualised at several levels - from the individual to broader social groupings (Goffman, 1974). In this study 'frame of reference' was defined as an analytical model representing the attitudes (beliefs, feelings, opinions) (Eiser, 1986) expressed by a policy actor when discussing a particular issue. It thus describes an individual point of view upon a policy issue1 (Swaffield, 1998). As the interviews and analyses proceeded it quickly become clear that although each individual's view was unique, there were marked similarities</page><page sequence="8">206 between many of the individual frames of reference. A number of recurring patterns were identified within the individual accounts; these were termed 'com- mon' frames of reference. A common frame of reference was defined as a distinctive way of thinking common to a number of individuals. This provided a way to analyse the link between individual language use (specifically the term 'landscape'), and broader groupings of attitudes and interests, described by Sabatier as advocacy coalitions. Advocacy coalitions are made up of individu- als 'who share a particular belief system - ie. a set of basic values, causal assumptions, or problem perceptions...' (1988: 139). Thus, a common frame of reference that expresses a distinctive pattern of shared attitudes provides some evidence of the character of a broader advocacy coalition. Together, the concepts of 'individual' and 'common' frames of reference provided a robust heuristic tool for investigation of contextuality in policy related discourse. Interview and analysis techniques The detailed analysis was based upon fifty-eight depth interviews undertaken during 1988 and 1989. Interviewees were selected to represent a range of interests involved in high country policy.2 Most were European, male, and aged 25-50. It was thus a sample of an elite group of decision makers and decision influ- encers. Their roles in policy formation are summarised in Table 1. Interviews were undertaken in either homes or work places. They typically lasted for one to two hours, were taped, and were confidential. Analysis followed three steps. First, the main ideas, concepts and relation- ships used by policy actors to express their views on the role and management of trees and plantations were transcribed, and a summary diagram of each person's views (Jones, 1985; Antaki, 1988) was developed. This diagram repre- sented the 'personal' frame of reference of the actor. All the personal frames of reference were then classified into sets that showed common patterns of ideas and concepts. These were designated 'common' frames of reference. Finally, the transcripts were reanalysed and coded to identify characteristics of the actors and their positions on certain key questions. This information was used to identify and summarise the distinctive features of each common frame.3 'Landscape' meaning and use was analysed in two ways. Four complementary content analyses of the interview transcripts were done, dealing in turn with the plain language meaning assigned to the term 'landscape', its metaphorical struc- ture, other associative meanings and its functional role in conversation. Finally, a broader interpretation of 'landscape' usage was undertaken, examining its political role in defining the issue of trees and plantations in the high country. In addition to the interview transcripts, this contextual interpretation also drew upon documentary sources within the public realm, such as scientific and professional articles, policy and advocacy statements, planning submissions and records of public planning hearings.</page><page sequence="9">207 Table 1. Roles of respondents. Land managers 7 Public administrators/policy planners 16 Consultants 9 Scientists 8 Politicians (local and central) 6 Advocates (for tangata whenua and for 12 conservation and recreation interests) Total 58 Framing the policy issue Analysis of the interview transcripts identified seven different ways of thinking (common frames of reference) about the overall policy issue (Swaffield, 1994). These are summarised in Table 2. Each of these common frames of reference expressed a different perspective upon the underlying issue of the role and management of trees and plantations in the New Zealand high country. They revealed distinctive patterns of preference about future outcomes, and about the role of government in achieving these outcomes. 'Multiple use management' describes the way that a significant number of respondents, typically planners, scientists or advocates for Maori (the indigenous culture), interpreted the policy issue as being a need for more active govern- ment involvement in land management, to ensure integrated and sustainable development of high country resources. Trees were seen as a natural part of the high country. Recent organisational restructuring was criticised for the way it had polarised interests and inhibited co-operation. These policy actors sup- ported increased use of both exotic and native species for economic production and ecosystem rehabilitation. 'Conservative management' expressed manage- ment concerns similar to those of 'multiple use management', but favoured a more cautious approach to the use of exotic trees and were less convinced of the benefits of extensive government involvement. The respondents comprised a diverse group of scientists and consultants, including a number of individuals with strong personal views about the high country. 'Conservation by control' describes the views of those actors who advocated strong central government intervention in order to protect the tussock grass- lands against perceived threats from both the planned and unintentional spread of exotic trees. They were largely representatives of urban based lobby groups. 'Individual improvement' on the other hand, describes those who saw modest tree planting as an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of current pastoral management. Respondents were largely rural land managers or their advisers, strongly opposed to outside 'interference' in their decision making. The remaining three frames of reference identified were all expressions of a desire for consensus. 'Consensus by administration' describes the concerns of a small group of former government administrators who defined the issue as a</page><page sequence="10">208 Table 2. Common frames of reference.

They favoured more government intervention in order to achieve a consensus outcome. 'Balance of local interests' describes the position of several local land managers and others who held representative responsibilities, such as local councillors). They saw a role for local government as a mediator in achieving modest, incremental change that responded to local interests. Finally, system design'describes the views expressed by several national politicians and central government policy advisers. They had less interest in the detail of the issue, seeing it largely as an example of a need for a reformed system of decision making based upon greater use of property rights. Multiple meanings of 'landscape' A separate analysis of the use of the term 'landscape' in the interview transcripts revealed several different but frequently used meanings of 'landscape' and a</page><page sequence="11">209 Table 3. Contemporary meanings of 'landscape'. Landscape as land Landform Territory Setting Environment System Perceptual landscape Inscape: mental picture Picture View Scenery Visual environment Interactive landscape Improved land Code Symbol Social idea number of minor usages. The most typical usages were 'landscape' as the appear- ance of land, as physical setting, as surface landform, as the overall environ- ment and as planned or improved land4 (Table 3). Analysis of the way 'landscape' was used as a metaphor provided further valuable insight into the underlying meanings intended by each user. Language is intrinsically metaphorical (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980), and many situations are defined and understood by reference to other, familiar situations. In total, twenty-nine different metaphors of 'landscape' were identified. The most com- mon usages were to express 'landscape' as a picture or as a panorama, as a surface, a pattern or an area.5 Thirdly, the technique of 'loose belief analysis' (Manning, 1988) was used to identify any distinctive associations - that is, patterns of use that linked 'land- scape' with a particular set of abstract ideals. The procedure was first, to list predicate words or phrases associated with 'landscape' usage, and then to analyse them for their denotative meaning; ie. to what objects they refer. This 'second level' of meanings is then analysed for underlying themes. Thus, for example, one frequent concept that was associated with 'landscape' was the idea of 'naturalness'. This 'deconstruction' of an interview clearly depends upon knowl- edge about its institutional and social context, and is, like the frame of reference, an analyst's interpretation. Nonetheless, the associations that emerged are both coherent and plausible. Five concepts were associated with 'landscape': natural- ness, picturesque improvement, identity and attachment to land, professional activity, and integrated management.6 The fourth analysis identified the function that 'landscape' played in each actor's speech: Was it used actively, or only passively following prompting from the interviewer? Did the usage shift in any systematic way during the discussion? Was the term 'owned' by the user, or assigned to others? Forty (67%) of those interviewed made active usage of 'landscape' but in only five cases (9%) was this a major feature of their overall discourse. There was some evidence of shifts</page><page sequence="12">210 Table 4. Patterns of 'landscape' usage and common frames of reference.

A few actors distinguished between their own usage of 'landscape' to make a point and the way it was used by others, indicating their awareness of the way that language can be 'owned' by particular groups or interests. Meaning and frames of reference The next step was to analyse links between these different dimensions of 'land- scape' usage and the common frames of reference of the actors interviewed. This revealed that 'landscape' meaning was clearly related to the attitudinal context in which it was used (Table 4). 'Multiple use management' respondents consistently emphasised a combination of visual, biophysical and areal meanings of 'landscape such as setting, environment, land form. The term was used actively in association with ideas of naturalness and integration to articulate the view that trees had an important role in high country land use and revege- tation. 'Conservative management'and 'conservation by control' respondents ex- pressed similarly complex plural meanings, and made active use of 'landscape',</page><page sequence="13">211 but linked it more with the naturalness and identity of the high country. The 'threat' to the existing landscape of the high country from tree planting and in particular from wilding spread, was emphasised. In contrast, users whose frames of reference on the underlying issue were described as 'individual improvement, 'consensus by administration'and 'balance of local interest'concentrated upon singular, visual meanings of 'landscape' and associated it with ideas of the picturesque. They used 'landscape' to refer to what to them was a relatively minor issue of how trees and plantations might affect the aesthetic appearance of the high country. They were typically 'passive' landscape users, not referring to 'landscape' in the discussion until they were prompted by the interviewer. The actors described as 'system designers' used areal meanings (such as territory) and associated 'landscape' with the issue of land improvement, but were variable in their level and range of usage. These findings provide evidence for a significant degree of plurality in the meaning and use of landscape within contemporary oral accounts. Furthermore, the linkage between usage and frame of reference with regard to trees in the high country indicates that usage is related significantly to the policy orientation of the user. Contextuality of meaning In the final stage of the analysis, the patterns of 'landscape' usage were inter- preted in terms of the policies they were being used to promote, and the interests they represented. Three distinctive contextual patterns of meaning and usage were identified. Each was associated with distinctly different competing interests or coalitions of interest in regard to tree management. Subjective landscape and non-intervention The first linkage of 'landscape' and a particular policy position was between the idea of landscape as a subjective viewpoint and a policy of non-intervention in high country management. The rural based interests in the high country, the land managers, local government and local interest groups, who make up the individual improvement and balance of local interest frames of reference, together with the central and regional government politicians and advisers in the system design frame constituted a broad coalition in support of non-intervention by government. They tended to favour modest tree planting, but the key issue for all the non-intervention interests was to resist or reject attempts by urban based interests to influence the land use outcomes. These actors emphasised pictorial meanings of landscape, and a distinctive feature of their usage was reference to its 'subjectivity'. In effect, they placed 'landscape' on the subjective side of what Lakoff and Johnson (1980) describe as the objective/subjective cultural myth. On the one side, they would argue, we</page><page sequence="14">212 have 'real' facts (science, economics, ownership, productivity) and on the other side we have emotional feelings and beliefs ('landscape'). For the rural users in particular, 'landscape' was an emotional term used by urban interests to sup- port what was, to the rural user, unwarranted involvement in high country decision making concerning trees. The 'subjectivity' and its visual (as opposed to physical) focus were used to downplay the significance of both the issue and its proponents. When asked about 'landscape' they commented: Landscape is a subjective thing. I suppose it's attached to the eye of the beholder - their individual assess- ment and acceptance, and just differs with every person - because it's not based on anything factual. Because it's based on emotion... they can get pretty hot-headed. Because they're not facts, you can argue in any direction... it's just based on emotion and visual concepts. There was also an explicit and critical focus by several actors on the way that a particular term like 'landscape' is associated with particular interest groups or professions: Landscape issues are something we've created through an educational process - creating landscapers, or designers, or whatever. You're talking right on a nerve end about how we allow values in our society to be represented in the process... it's real middle class capture stuff... a few articulate people with enough money to capture the process and put views over strongly. Thus 'landscape' was a pejorative term used to characterise the views of 'others' outside the landowner/central government coalition, who were contesting their non-interventionist views on high country land management. Subjective landscape and intervention In contrast to the non-interventionist usage, a number of actors who advocated government intervention to control the potential impact of trees used the emo- tional or subjective dimension of landscape to support their cause: When I use the word landscape rather than scenery, what I'm trying to do is use a word which embraces something which isn't just sentimentalism, but is a powerful, legitimate, spiritual feeling about land....</page><page sequence="15">Table 5.

Usage in two of the common frames, consensus by administration and system design revealed a subtle variation on the 'subjective' associations of 'land- scape'. Like the actors with rural based frames of individual improvement and balance of local interests, these actors acknowledged that 'landscape' prefer- ences, particularly visual preferences, were associated with different interest groups: In some people's minds it's all to do with the landscaping bit... the sub- missions to the draft application indicate different aspects of concern. But this was then used to support a claim for their own role in building consensus and ensuring a balanced decision (consensus by administration): I like to hear all sides of the story, in the presence of everyone... to get to the roots of the matter. or in promoting system reform to resolve such conflicts (system designers): What we need to do is design an evaluation system that allows us to weigh it up. Hence the 'subjectivity' of landscape was used in a positive way, to support the roles and values of those speaking. Intervention in the 'natural' landscape The three remaining frames of reference (multiple use management, conserva- tive management, conservation by control) were all predominantly urban based, typically in Christchurch, the regional capital, or Wellington, the national capital, and supported a governmental role in the management of trees in the high country. They all introduced an 'objective' concept of 'landscape' into the conversation without prompting, but there were significant differences in em- phasis of usage, including an interesting contrast in the way the idea of 'natural' landscape was used. The actors who expressed the multiple use management frame all advocated tree planting, and typically used a physical concept of 'landscape' to support that goal: Within these landscapes, particularly if you're talking of the Waimak, there are large chunks of country that are capable of being very productive.</page><page sequence="17">215 One of the dominant associations of 'landscape' they made was with the idea of integrated management: (The landscape issue) should include the whole breadth of the ecology - all the interrelated changes consequent on the plantations - ensuring the whole environment is integrated.... They also frequently linked 'landscape' with naturalness: New Zealand has very distinctive natural landscape types. and used the idea of naturalness to support tree planting: We need a balancing up act, getting timber back on those naturally forested slopes. Two other predominantly urban based frames of reference, conservative manage- ment and conservation by control, also used 'landscape' actively and associated it with 'naturalness', but in this case used a different interpretation of 'natural landscape' to advocate quite different outcomes. For these actors, who were typically conservation or recreation advocates, biological scientists, or landscape consultants, the 'natural' condition of the high country was open tussock grass- lands: The high country is essentially a treeless landscape, or initially a treeless landscape. They opposed extensive tree planting, and cited 'naturalness' as the reason: There doesn't seem to be any scope for reconciliation between natural New Zealand landscape and introduced plantings of any kind. My basic objection is that I don't find exotic timber plantations attractively visually, because they're unnatural. It's unnatural, that's the issue. Thus two opposing sets of interests used a similar meaning of landscape (as physical setting or natural character) in contrasting ways, depending upon their overall frame of reference on the issue, and in particular, depending upon their preferred outcomes. This contrast in the interpretation of 'natural' landscape exemplifies many of the characteristics of policy myth (de Neufville and Barton, 1987; Swaffield, 1995). In seeking to simplify the situation some aspects were highlighted and others discounted. The 'multiple use management' usage down- played the fact that contemporary afforestation typically results in single species</page><page sequence="18">216 exotic coniferous forest, whereas the former 'natural' forests were indigenous beech. The 'conservation by control' usage downplayed the fact that the existing tussock grasslands are in part a culturally induced landscape, and therefore not entirely 'natural' in an ecological sense. This selective bias supported different interpretations of the appropriate policy response. Discussion The analysis of different meanings of landscape, and identification of several contrasting strategies for the use of these different meanings in advocacy re- garding the management of trees in the New Zealand high country, raises several questions. Specifically, how does this strategic use of language impact upon policy outcomes? To what extent, and for whom, does plurality constitute a policy problem? And what does an interpretive analysis of language use con- tribute to a more general understanding of policy formation? The impact of competing meanings upon policy outcomes can be best illus- trated by reference to subsequent developments in landscape policy. Two aspects are of particular relevance: first, the territorial planning authority experience in developing a new district plan, and second, wider national developments. In the early 1990's, the planning authority began a process of plan preparation for the whole district, as required by the new resource management legislation. The Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA91) was the culmination of the reform of environmental management during the late 1980s. It replaced a diverse range of statutes with an interpreted framework of resource manage- ment, with the primary purpose of 'sustainable management' of natural and physical resources. The new legislation was radical in a number of respects (Buhrs and Bartlett, 1993), but also carried forward distinct elements and sentiment from earlier statutes (Swaffield, 1997), including an ambiguous treat- ment of the concept of landscape. The RMA91 requires planning authorities to prepare plans for their districts which manage adverse effects of land use activities, and the act specifically sets out a process of public consultation, including public hearings and opportunity for cross submission. The Selwyn District draft plan attracted such a volume of submissions and cross submis- sions that the council took the unusual step in 1997 of totally withdrawing the plan and recommencing the process of plan preparation. One of the significant areas of contention in the draft plan was the nature and rationale of provisions designed to manage amenity and 'landscape' effects in rural areas (including the high country). 'Landscape' was variously interpreted in the debate, with com- peting 'naturalised' meanings being used to advocate for or against different levels of council involvement in land management. Other councils elsewhere in New Zealand were encountering similar prob- lems. In the Mackenzie District, further south in the high country, management of forestry was a particularly contentious issue, and 'landscape' figured centrally and plurally in the debate. Issues of 'landscape' interpretation reached national</page><page sequence="19">217 prominence in late 1997, when the draft plan of the Far North District Council was the focus of an expose in a current affairs programme on national television. Again, at issue was conflict over the legitimacy and form of proposed restrictions on rural land management based upon 'landscape' concerns, with contrasting interpretations of 'landscape' being advocated by urban based consultants and rural land managers. The strategic and contested use of language identified in the case study interviews in 1989 thus prefigured significant conflicts in rural policy formation over the subsequent decade. To what extent, however, does the problem as such lie with the strategic use of language, or is this an expression of other more fundamental issues? Plurality of meaning, of the sort illustrated here, is frequently portrayed as a problem, getting in the way of rational decision making. Has 'landscape' plural- ity therefore created the issue of management of trees in the New Zealand high country? There is little evidence to support such a contention. As O'Connor (1983) noted, the tension between trees and pasture is a fundamental dimension of high country land use and management. The fact that 'landscape' was used extensively by a few actors, but seldom or not at all by others, and that the different advocacy positions were easily identified independently of 'landscape' usage, indicates that 'landscape' plurality is an expression of, but not a source of, the underlying issue. Has plurality of meaning complicated the issue? A feature of the conflicts in rural policy formation (and, indeed, of the Far North District Council's very public expose) has been claims of a lack of effective public participation or consultation in the early stages of policy formation. Conflict has typically emerged in response to draft plans prepared by Councils, typically by urban based consultants using 'expert' methods of evaluation. The language of the 'official' plan is thus imposed on local communities, who in turn use language strategically (and, on the face of it, effectively) to resist constraints on their freedom of action. Ironically, it is precisely the widespread opportunity for public comment provided by the RMA91 which enables such resistance. The problem appears to be in the apparent reluctance of planning authorities to acknowledge and incorporate diverse perspectives in the initial stages of plan formation. A critical review of district plans affecting the New Zealand high country indicates that very few councils incorporate expressions of community values in the structure of their plan drafts, relying instead for their 'consulta- tion' upon subsequent reactions to initial statements prepared by experts. Seen in this context, the strategic use of language by different interest groups represents one of their most potent weapons against the planning bureaucracy. If the plurality in meaning of 'landscape' represents a problem, it is a problem primarily for the planning authority, and secondly for the consultants they employ. It is perhaps no surprise, therefore, that the greatest pressure for prescribed meanings of terms such as 'landscape' comes from planning and landscape professionals, who seek greater certainty in their activities, and from policy analysts in government, who seek more instrumental planning processes.</page><page sequence="20">218 Yet even here, meanings are contested, as each group seeks to maximise their particular interests, with landscape architects advocating inclusive 'objective' meanings (Henderson and de Lambert, 1992) in order to support a broad professional brief, while planning bureaucrats seek narrower, 'subjective' mean- ings to 'contain' issues more effectively. What contribution can this case study make to the broader understanding of policy formation? The investigation of 'landscape' usage started with the premise that is now well established within policy science, that meaning is contextual. However, most interpretations to date have been at a relatively broad scale of analysis and deal with the formal language of public policy, or institutional actions interpreted as text. In contrast, this study has focused upon the micro- scale, exploring detailed variation in everyday language use by and between individuals. It has shown how language is used strategically by individuals as part of their policy advocacy, and has linked such usage to broader patterns of interest. In particular, linking of micro and macroscale raises the question of the extent to which individual meaning and usage defines or is defined by broader interests. The historical documentary analysis showed how particular meanings of 'landscape' were developed by different disciplines or professions to fulfil particular functions; for example, professional self definition (Swaffield, 1993). What appears to be happening in this case study is that particular mean- ings become incorporated into broader discourse, and the range of 'naturalised' meanings developed in this way over time becomes a linguistic resource avail- able for contemporary policy advocates to draw upon. However, naturalised meanings, once re-incorporated into a particular discourse, then subtly shape the way arguments are presented. The use of 'natural landscape' to both sup- port and oppose tree planting is a good example of how a taken-for-granted meaning or association becomes used in two different ways by different interest groups. Thus while conventional, 'naturalised' denotative meanings of commonly used terms persist through time (for example, landscape as land), their conno- tative meaning shifts according to the particular context. Particular interests are expressed both in the selection of 'conventional' meaning, and in the deploy- ment of that meaning to achieve particular ends. In order to understand any particular example of usage of a term such as landscape, it is necessary to locate it both within a broader discourse, and within a particular policy context. Conclusion The linguistic turn in social and policy sciences has drawn attention to the particularity and contextuality of meanings of commonly used terms within public policy formation. This study has traced in detail the different meanings of the term 'landscape' within a specific policy context in New Zealand. It has shown how different meanings of 'landscape' were associated with, and used by, competing policy interests, each seeking different outcomes in regard to the</page><page sequence="21">219 issue of the management of trees and plantations in the South Island high country. Analysis of interviews with policy actors demonstrated the way in which these actors used previously established meanings strategically to argue particular positions, and also prefigured the use of such language in public contests associated with the plan making process under the Resource Manage- ment Act 1991. However, it cannot be argued that these multiple meanings of 'landscape' created the policy issue. As O'Connor noted in 1983, the tension between pastoralists and foresters is fundamental to high country land use. Rather, the significance of the use of the term 'landscape' has been in the way the meanings brought into the debate from previous discourses have subtly shaped the way arguments are presented. The 'problem' of multiple meanings lies therefore more with the planning bureaucracy, who must manage its effects, than with the diverse interest groups who selectively use different meanings. The study has also suggested some links between the way particular meanings are expressed within broader landscape discourse, and their specific expression in a policy issue. In essence, the broader historical discourse provides a set of linguistic resources which particular policy actors can draw upon and adapt for their particular ends. The significance of this is that any attempt to interpret the meanings of policy related terms must analyse both the macrosacle discursive context and the microscale context of use. Treating policy as 'text' (Yanow 1995) brings with it the need to consider intertextuality (Barnes and Duncan 1992), that is, the way particular 'texts' incorporate within them meanings from other earlier texts. A linguistic approach to policy interpretation therefore requires, of necessity, an historical perspective (Chock 1995). One response to Aschers' question of 'how might interpretive analysis be done?' is that contextuality must be considered both historically and at a range of scales of discourse.

Notes 1. One important issue in discourse analysis is the nature of the assumptions made about the authenticity of people's accounts - that is, do people openly and accurately express attitudes (Gilbert and Mulkay, 1981), or do they attempt to disguise underlying beliefs (Potter and Wetherell, 1987)? In this study, as my primary focus of research was contextuality in language use, I made the initial assumption that the spoken acounts of respondents accurately expressed their attitudes and beliefs (Harre, 1976). 2. My starting point was an analysis of participants at a policy seminar on forestry in the high country, held in Christchurch under the auspices of the regional planning authority (Gregory,</page><page sequence="22">220 1988). I identified several distinct interest groups. Pilot interviews with key informants selected from these groups led me to a widening net of informants (a'snowball' technique) (Constantini and Hanf, 1972), until the final sample included land managers advisers, lobby groups and politicians at local, regional and national levels. Some respondents were directly involved in day to day implementation of policy, whilst others were involved in system reform and administration. I did not include representatives of the wider population, nor did I attempt any statistically representative sampling. As Potter and Wetherell (1987) noted, when dealing with microscale patterns of language use, 'because a large number of liguistic patterns are likely to emerge from only a few people, small samples... are generally quite adequate for investigating an interesting and practically important range of phenomena. For discourse analysis the success of a study is not in the least dependent on sample size' (1987: 161). Selection of respondents was based largely on the roles held by people at the time of the field research. 3. This development of common patterns of response based upon analysis of the overall patterns of each individual's response is similar in many respects to the factor analysis of Q methodology (Brown, 1980), although in this case the approach was entirely qualitative in approach. 4. Meanings of landscape 'Landscape' as the appearance of land was clearly the most common usage - referred to by fifty-two of the fifty-eight respondents. Some were quite explicit when questioned on 'landscape' usage: Landscape? I'm referring probably to what is seen... to the way it looks. Landscape is how it hits the eye. More typically, the meaning of 'landscape' as appearance was implicit: Forestry can be very significant in terms of landscape effect, and as you'll recall from the seminar, my concern is far more with the aesthetic effect where the milling and harvesting took place. 'Landscape' was widely used to refer the type of physical setting, the character of an area: East of that is a dry landscape of tall tussock, west of it is a beech forest landscape.... It was also extensively used to refer to the surface of the land - often as a metonym for landform: Landforms, landscape are important across the nation. (We) can have a landscape issue if we think as a society that we want to have a museum of landscape forms. A significant number used 'landscape' to refer to environment: My understanding of landscape is that you... look in very broad terms about landscape issues, not your aesthetics, are looking at the environmental whole, which includes land- form, geographical features, natural ecosystems that are on the land. Finally 'landscape' was commonly equated with planned improvement, often in the form of 'landscaping' (and occasionally 'landscaper'). Fifteen respondents suggested variations on the following: Landscape is a way of rehealing the world, because all the bush has been removed. Around half the respondents used different meanings of 'landscape' at different times during the discussion (for example, using 'landscape' to refer to both the appearance of land, and its systematic biophysical properties). 5. Metaphors of landscape 'Picture' and 'panorama' were commonly used: Probably when you're talking about landscape you're talking about a panoramic view. Areal metaphors were also widely used, for example 'landscape' as a surface:</page><page sequence="23">221 Trees don't offend me on a landscape.... It was also described as a pattern or patchwork: In a sense the landscape there is a simple one... the pattern of tussock, bare country like shingle, snow and ice country.... Other distinctive usages included a number of anthropomorphic references (for example, land- scaping as a way of 'healing the wound' on the body of the land). 6. Associative meaning Around half the respondents associated 'landscape' with 'naturalness': ...large chunks of the high country have all sorts of other values - both in terms if ecosystems, biota and just a natural.... our landscape, that's important. For many respondents the 'naturalness' of 'landscape' was highlighted by its location away from the city: We lived in the country, then moved into town - quiet streets and mature trees, lovely spot - but I couldn't see the the landscape there.... The second most common association was with the idea of picturesque improvement. Ten respondents placed emphasis upon 'landscape' as a symbol of improvement. All of these were 'passive' users who needed prompting to talk about 'landscape': [Self: What is the landscape issue?] It's got to be changed - it improves it. Five of these, plus seven others (twelve in total) interpreted improvement in terms of the aesthetics of the picturesque, with an emphasis upon pictorial qualities, the 'blending in' of buildings and geometric forms, and using exotic trees as visual highlights: [Self: What is the landscape issue?] Yes, yes, yes, I think we ought to have a lot more regard to the aesthetics of forests.... If you go to Austria you see they have planted their production forests on the sides of hills - to conform to the contour of the land so that flat land on the bottom - cattle and sheep and the contours are beautifully contoures so the shape of the forest is natural looking and on top there is a plateau. I think we should get away from the squares and also there are good reasons for even the production forests, on the outskirts, for planting attractive exotic trees that go brown, yellow, red, in the autumn, whatever. Over a third linked 'landscape' to personal and national identity, familiarity and emotional attachment to the land: There is a mystical aspect to the landscape, and that's where you belong. You belong to the landscape if you relate to it. This is part of growing up in New Zealand. The landscapes I feel strongly about are the landscapes I know. A similar number linked landscape to professional activity: Right from childhood I have been conscious of an interest in order, a sense of order... as a child, ordering my own room, having how it was. A natural progression to landscape architecture, trying to help fit in developments, helping them work well. Finally, a number of respondents consistently linked 'landscape' with ideas of integrated manage- ment: The effect that planting is going to have on the present landscape - whether it integrates or not with the present cover of the land.</page><page sequence="24">222 References Antaki, C.
