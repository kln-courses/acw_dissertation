Le Dieu Cosmique, pp. xvii + 6io. (Etudes Bibliques.) Paris: Gabalda et Cie, 1949. Price not stated (c. Ji IIs. 6d.). Few major works of scholarship have been published under a title better calculated to conceal their contents and repel prospective readers. It would seem that, having edited the Hermetica with A. D. Nock, Father Festugiere set out to write a historical introduction to them. But this modest undertaking has grown under his hand until it turned into something very different and much more important, the fullest study yet made of the origin and development of certain main currents of religious thought in the Hellenistic Age and under the Roman Empire. The first volume, published in I944 and now available in a second edition with appendix of additions and corrections, began with a brilliant sketch of the mind and heart of paganism in the second century A.D. which serves as an introduction to the entire work. The rest of this volume was devoted mainly to a series of studies on astrology, alchemy, magic, and the doctrine of ' occult sympathies', with special (but by no means exclusive) reference to treatises on these topics published under the patronage of ' Hermes '. In vol. II, Le Dieu Cosmique, the connection with the Hermetists is even looser; we are warned on the first page that there was no such thing as a ' Hermetic philosophy '-the men who wrote in Hermes' name were quite incapable of thinking for themselves, did not constitute a school, and are important only as illustrating various religious tendencies of their time. They are disposed of in three short chapters, after which we come to the real subject of the book-the development of 'cosmic religion' or 'optimistic monism' in ancient philosophical writers from Plato to Philo. Two further volumes are promised: iII, Les Doctrines de l'Ame, which will deal with the parallel current of ' pessimistic dualism' that runs through Greco-Roman literature; and iv, Le Dieu Inconnu et la Gnose. I hope that no student of Greek and Roman thought will be deterred from reading Le Dieu Cosmique either by its ostensible connection with Hermes or by its somewhat inordinate length.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS AND NOTICES OF PUBLICATIONS I47 It could, I think, have been shorter: in the later chapters, at any rate, the number of texts which are either translated in extenso or analysed in detail (or both) could have been cut down without too much loss, and some repetitions could have been avoided by a freer use of cross-references. But if this book is less sharply focused upon essentials than Festugiere's delightful earlier study, Epicure et ses dieux, the patient reader will be rewarded by gaining a new insight into the process by which one of the dominant ideas of antiquity secured and held its mastery over the imaginations of men. Festugiere does not (to my regret) deal with what may be called the ' prehistory' of the idea: he does not discuss the steps by which the Greeks came to think of the universe as a Ko6uos, or the kind of divinity which was attributed before the fourth century B.C. to the heavenly bodies. The earliest texts which he examines are the teleological arguments of the Memorabilia, which he is inclined to trace back with Theiler to Diogenes of Apollonia, though he wisely refuses to exclude the possibility (indeed likelihood ?) that such arguments were used by the historical Socrates (p. 8i). But cosmic teleology is not cosmic religion, for it ignores the problem of evil. For F. the true founder of the religion of the cosmos-and also, paradoxically, of its opposite, pessimistic dualism- is Plato, not the Plato whom our undergraduates read, but the historically far more important Plato of the Timaeus and the Laws. He shows how the two opposing attitudes are rooted in two rival interpretations of the Platonic XCApa, both of which have their justification in Plato's text, and this leads to a full discussion of Plato's views on the place of evil in the cosmos (pp. IIO-I32). Then comes a particularly interesting chapter on the reasons for the success of the religion of the cosmos. These were partly philosophical (the prompt abandonment, even in the Academy, of the doctrine of Forms, which left the opaToi eEoi as the highest object of contemplation), but chiefly social (loss of faith in the anthropomorphic gods, and the craving for a religion which should be at once 'scientific' and universal). F. makes little, here or elsewhere, of supposed oriental influences, but a good deal (after Tarn) of ' the ideas of Alexander', whom he considers, on very indirect evidence, to have been a worshipper of ' le dieu cosmique' (pp. I87-I95). The transition to the Hellenistic outlook is then studied in two significant documents, the Epinomis, ' l'evangile d'une religion nouvelle,' which may be the work of Plato himself (F. here recants his earlier judgment, Contemplation chez Platon, p. I76), and the fragments of Aristotle's -rrEpi yAouoypcs, whose influence was perhaps even greater than that of the Timaeus. The next section of the book deals with the Stoa. Noteworthy here are:-the firm rejection of the notion that Stoicism was a kind of oriental mysticism (p. 266, n. i), or a fatalistic refuge from despair (pp. 332-5) ; the reasons suggested for the appeal of Stoic ethics (pp. 286-309); and the detailed study of Cleanthes' hymn (pp. 3Io-332), an example of the French ' explication de textes ' at its best. This is followed by a valuable chapter on the origins of eclecticism; it is traced in part to the widespread use of teaching manuals (Edaaycwyai), which created a sort of' philosophic KOIV1 , in part to the reliance on doxographies, which destroyed the individuality of the classical systems, and were exploited by the New Academy to induce disbelief in all systems. (One might say, in fact, that what ended creative thinking was the study of the history of thought-a disquieting conclusion.) The remainder of the volume is concerned with three individual witnesses to the development of cosmic religion in the eclectic age: Cicero, chiefly in de natura deorum ii and the Somnium Scipionis; the pseudo-Aristotelian de mundo, which in F.'s view was probably read by Philo and should therefore probably be dated about the beginning of the Christian era (p. 479); and finally Philo himself. Save, perhaps, for the part played by Cicero in developing the doctrine of Natural Law, none of these writers can be called creative (F. says of Philo that one can read the whole of him without encountering a single original thought). But in each of them we find the expression of certain new sentiments or themes which have grown out of the religion of the cosmos : in Cicero the ascent of the liberated soul through the skies (Somn. Scip.), and the ' vitalist ' conviction of God's presence in even the humblest forms of being (nat. deor. iI: but was this really new ?); in de mundo, the opposing sentiment of God's remoteness, ' riding high and pure in a pure region' very far from the impure world of men; in Philo, the stress on an inward relation of the soul to God, an attitude which can be called ' mystical ' although Philo is not a mystic in the stricter sense. Several of these developments have been attributed to the influence of Poseidonius; but while F. acknowledges his debt to scholars like Reinhardt, he has read his R. M. Jones and is rightly chary of individual ascriptions (cf. p. xvi). This piece of history raises some interesting questions, which will perhaps be more fully answered in later instalments of F.'s great work. The ' religion of the cosmos' is a unique example of a religious attitude completely divorced from cult which was propagated through books and oral teaching (one might almost say ' sermons ') for half a millennium and more, and became in the end a' religion of every sensible man', part of the intellectual baggage of the educated and semi-educated classes up and down the Roman Empire. It very easily degenerated, as F. shows, into a collection</page><page sequence="3">148 REVIEWS AND NOTICES OF PUBLICATIONS of banal rhetorical -roTroTI; but its vitality must have been nourished by some degree of real emotional experience-primarily, I suppose, the experience derived from contemplating sunlit and starlit Mediterranean skies. Like the contemplation of the high Alps, which can both exalt and oppress, this experience can evoke widely different reactions according to the temperament and circumstances of the beholder: he may, like Cleanthes, feel his solidarity with a vaster Whole, a divine order whose will sustains his own and whose inscrutable purposes he exists to serve; but he may also, like the author of de mundo, be troubled by the contrast between the ageless harmony of the heavens and the world of things that perish which is ' filled with an extreme disorder'. The former experience will incline him to a pure ' optimistic monism'; the latter may generate consoling phantasies like the Somnium Scipionis, or, at a deeper level, may drive him to postulate a God beyond the heavens whom the soul can reach not by a spatial but by an inward journey. Plato in his later thought had tried to do justice to both types of experience ; Stoic orthodoxy builds chiefly on the former; but in the tormented Ciceronian age the sense of man's weakness and insecurity begins to find renewed expression both within the religion of the cosmos and outside it. The extent and importance of this change does not fully emerge within the limits of the present volume, and for a discussion of the underlying reasons we must presumably await vol. III. Le Dieu Cosmique throughout exhibits that enviable and seemingly effortless mastery of almost all the relevant material which we have come to expect from its author. But as in any book of such length on such a subject, statements can be found in it with which it is possible to quarrel. Here are a few. P. 33: F. applies to Plotinus what Brehier said, truly enough, of later Greek philosophy in general, that on utilise les doctrines, on ne construit plus'. Yet surely no one can study the Enneads closely without perceiving in them and behind them an immense effort of construction, the attempt to reorganize the whole philosophical tradition in the light of a single controlling idea, which sharply differentiates them from works like the Hermetica. P. 53, God as oCJX E-i, a&amp;A' a' ou o E1s (Herm. 5, 2). The source of this may be Neopythagorean rather than (as F. says) Gnostic: for the idea that the Supreme Principle is beyond number appears already in Eudorus, apud Simplic. in Phys. I8I, 27 ff. P. ioo: ' les dieux mythologiques ont fait leur temps: Platon fonde une religion nouvelle.' So indeed it might appear from Lawzs x; but both here and later (p. I59) F. ignores the rather embarrassing fact that Plato still wishes his citizens to offer cult to Olympian and chthonic gods and to 8aipovE' and heroes (Laws 7I7 AB), and that his apXiEpECi will be the joint minister of Helios and Apollo (945 E ff.). P. I09, n. 5 : in the important sentence of the Tirnaeus which begins at 36 E 5, the philosophical results of construing TCOV VOIT-rwCV aEi TE OVTCAwV with TOU apicTOu are no doubt a little awkward, especially if like F. one decides that the Demiurge is ' a mythical double of the World Soul' (p. I04). But F. has not convinced me that Plato can really have meant us to take these words with yvuxi or acTil. Wilamowitz made them depend not on auTr, as F. says, but on apiaT-r, with TrCV (yE&gt; yEvvr?OEvrcov in limiting apposition, which is less incredible stylistically but still very odd. P. I47: ought we still to speak of ' the Orphic theogony in the Birds' ? (Cf. contra, Thomas, 'ETr?KE1Va 43 f.). P. I75: ' La notion meme de la science a change. Pour l'homme hellenistique, 1'etude est desinteressee: connaitre est une fin en soi... Pour le moderne en revanche, selon les vues ordinaires, le principal interet de la science est dans les resultats pratiques.' I should have said that while the true scientist is as disinterested to-day as he always was, the ordinary man has never valued science save for its practical benefits, and in the Hellenistic Age, when the practical benefits were much fewer than to-day, he naturally valued it much less-one cause of its eventual stagnation was the lack of adequate patronage. Neither the notion of science nor the nature of men has changed, at least in this respect. Pp. 270, 6o6: Pohlenz's Grundfragen der stoischen Philosophie (Abh. Gott. Ges. I940) seems to have escaped F.'s notice, or was inaccessible to him. Had he seen it, he might have hesitated to say (p. 306) with Dirlmeier that the OiKEIcocw; doctrine was borrowed by Zeno from Theophrastus. The attested extracts from Theophrastus in Porphyry deal not with the psychological process of oiKEiCoai5 but with the biological fact of OIKEIO'Th (de abst. 2.22, 3.25: Theophrastus stops at 3.26 EXEi TTNV avapopav ?). P. 306 did Alexander consciously intend to merge Europe with Asia by racial intermixture (Diod. I8.4.4), or is Diodorus reading back into Alexander's acts purposes which may never have occurred to him (cf. Tarn, Alexander II, 429 ff.) ? P. 423: F. assumes, after Jaeger, that de partibus animalium belongs to Aristotle's last period. But see, contra, the arguments of H. D. P. Lee, CQ 42 (I948), 6i, which seem to me strong. P. 585: ' dans le de mundo il n'y a point trace de dualisme.' This seems an overstatement, and hardly consistent with what F. himself says on p. 5I4. Finally, the numerous misprints (some of which are corrected in an appendix to the new edition of vol. I) are irritating but seldom important. Much more serious is the absence of an index, especially as F., like Wilamowitz, is liable to discuss anything anywhere. But this will presumably be remedied in the next volume-to which one reader at least looks forward with impatience. E. R. DODDS.</page></plain_text>
