<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter 1 Ancient Liberties In A Dissertation upon Parties (1733), the politician and political phi- losopher Henry St John, Viscount Bolingbroke, argues that ‘If liberty is  a delicious and wholesome fruit, the British constitution is the tree that  bears this fruit’: our constitution is a system of government suited to the genius of our nation,  and even to our situation. The experience of many hundred years hath  shown, that by preserving this constitution inviolate, or by drawing it back to  the principles on which it was originally founded, whenever it shall be made  to swerve from them, we may secure to ourselves, and to our latest posterity,  the possession of that liberty which we have long enjoyed. What would we  more? What other liberty than this do we seek?1 Bolingbroke’s remarks indicate the centrality of liberty in eighteenth- century English political discourse, its connection with both the ‘nation’  and the people.2 In this discourse, liberty is historically inflected, having  its basis in the ancient constitution. For Bolingbroke, at least, (there  were other varieties of ancient constitutionalism) liberty originated with  the Saxons and had been maintained (albeit with struggle) ever since.3  Typically in relation to this trope, the tone of the narrative expresses at  once bullish certainty and underlying anxiety. In the struggle for liberty,  one key moment, Bolingbroke suggests, was the Glorious Revolution:  the ‘progression from a free to a slavish constitution of government’ (a  government in which royal prerogative was too dominant) was ‘stopped  at the revolution’.4 But the need to continue the struggle remains. Bolingbroke’s use of the ancient constitution and his praise for the  Glorious Revolution is strategic. He had supported the 1715 Jacobite  Rebellion against King George I, only receiving a pardon in 1723. Ten  years later the statesman was prepared to evoke a consistent tradition  of liberty and to imply his support for the Hanoverian dynasty which  had prevented James Francis Edward Stuart’s return. But as he praises  </page> <page sequence="2">  24    Reinventing Liberty the ‘drawing back’ of the Glorious Revolution, he undermines the  king’s first minister, Sir Robert Walpole. The minister’s use of political  placemanship and closeness to the monarchy is, Bolingbroke suggests,  threatening liberty once again. The former Stuart supporter also uses  the discourse of ancient constitutionalism to register alarm over the  growth of ‘banking, credit and capital facilities’ and their influence on  politics.5 Bolingbroke’s use of the narrative of ancient constitutionalism  demonstrates its malleability. It provided a convenient way of attacking  the supposed corruption of political opponents. However, it also had an  inherently uneasy relation with the political implications of economic  change. In The Historical Novel (1937) Lukács’s agenda impels him to favour  a narrative of abrupt social and generic change as most progressive.  Nonetheless, for eighteenth-century political commentators continuity  rather than breakage was frequently positioned as presenting the best  chance of preserving freedom. As J. G. A. Pocock notes, ‘throughout  the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, every major piece of either  historical or legal thinking involved, if it did not consist in, the adop- tion of an attitude towards the “ancient constitution”’.6 While ancient  constitutionalism emphasised continuity, it could also be used to argue  for reform. In the seventeenth century the jurist and politician Sir  Edward Coke, for example, stressed the continuity of the constitution  from Anglo-Saxon to Norman times through to the present. When he  asserted that that Common Law was superior to the Royal Prerogative,  he antagonised the Stuart monarch, King James I, implying a restriction  on James’s divine right to absolute authority. Later, Bolingbroke uses  a similar tactic against Robert Walpole under George II: in order to  restrict Walpole’s freedom of manoeuvre, Bolingbroke implies that the  first minister and implicitly the king are moving along the path toward  absolutism. In the 1760s opponents of George III’s administration again  adopted the strategy. Wishing to confirm parliamentary rather than  monarchical power, they too argued that a return to ancient consti- tutionalism was necessary to restrain the king’s (supposed) absolutist  tendencies. However, in the 1780s and 90s the idea of the Norman Yoke  (the notion that the Normans had deviated from the ancient constitu- tion) was used to argue for wider reform. Too much power had been  given to the nobility and monarchy; King Alfred had understood that  the law functioned for all the people equally. In reply Edmund Burke  reversed Sir Edward Coke’s narrative of continuity in order to defend  the monarchy – he argued that the monarch, as well as the people, has  certain privileges. Yet in all versions of the narrative, what was empha- sised was not breakage but return to origin, a ‘preserving’ or ‘drawing  </page> <page sequence="3"> Ancient Liberties    25 back’: even those who desired political reform frequently justified it by  labelling it a reversion to past practices.7 Ancient constitutionalism – or the interrogation of it – shaped the  historical novel before Scott. In particular, for the historical novelists  of the 1760s and 70s – Thomas Leland, Horace Walpole, and Clara  Reeve – and their followers, the notion of inherited liberties was as  important as any narrative of progress.8 Here Lukács’s description  of Horace Walpole’s Castle of Otranto (1764) as the ‘most famous  “historical novel” of the eighteenth century’ becomes relevant.9 While  Scott had praised Horace Walpole as an important influence, Lukács’s  use of inverted commas suggest a certain ambivalence. Walpole’s use of  the past is not, as Lukács suggests, ‘mere costumery’. Rather, Walpole  was connected to and yet ambivalent about ancient constitutionalism  because of its use against his father. When the importance of this narra- tive of ‘ancient liberty’ is understood, it becomes evident that Walpole  and his contemporaries are, like Lukács’s Scott, also exploring the distri- bution of power within the state.10 With the end of the Jacobite threat,  the historiographic dispute that had run so fiercely in the ten years  after Bolingbroke’s Remarks on the History of England (1730) and his  Dissertation eventually spilled into the more flexible realm of fiction. As the first part of this chapter explores, for Horace Walpole and  the historical novelists of the 1760s, the transition from Stuart to  Hanoverian rule eventually made possible by the Glorious Revolution  was the event that shaped historical fiction. But the movement of ancient  constitutionalism from history writing to the historical novel also indi- cates the increasingly problematic nature of the discourse. In the absence  of the divine right of kings, the metaphysical underpinnings of the  constitution – of justice and of correct inheritance itself – seemed weak.  In the late 1780s and early 1790s it was also evident that the narrative  of the Norman Yoke, as well as that of ancient constitutionalism more  generally, could be used to argue for a more radical political reform, as  The Son of Ethelwolf (1789) suggests. However, it was Edmund Burke’s  response in Reflections to such radical formulations of the trope that led  (even amongst moderate thinkers) to sustained criticism of the notion of  ‘ancient liberties’. Queries were generated concerning both the present- day relevance of such supposed freedoms and the monarchical virtues  on which they were based. In the anonymous Edwy, Son of Ethelred,  for example, the moment of the perfect Anglo-Saxon constitution  recedes into the political past: even in Anglo-Saxon England liberty is  in decline. When Ann Radcliffe responds in Gaston de Blondeville to  Burke’s vision of constitutional continuity, what she emphasises is a  continuity of discord. These works expose the static nature of ancient  </page> <page sequence="4">  26    Reinventing Liberty constitutionalism – an awkward fixity given the perceived mobility of  consumer society. Ruling with Liberty? Leland, Walpole and Reeve In what came to be known as the Whig version of history the Glorious  Revolution was necessary to ensure political progress. However, in the  first half of the eighteenth century both the Old Whigs and the Jacobites  remained unconvinced. Disinclined to equate the events of 1688  with national advancement in any straightforward way, instead, like  Bolingbroke, they argued for a version of history in which the ancient  constitution had enshrined certain liberties – liberties that Sir Robert  Walpole, the king’s first minister, was undermining. By the 1760s, this  rhetoric could be employed by discontented Whig aristocrats against the  ministers, Bute and Grenville, and George III.11 Supposed fear of abso- lutism and struggle for parliamentary power led to the use of ‘gothic’  political rhetoric once familiar to the Old Whigs. In such narratives, it  was the absolutism supposedly connected with George III that was the  newer political paradigm, threatening rupture with the past. Drawing  upon this Old Whig approach, the novels of Leland, Reeve, and (more  equivocally) Walpole show an awareness of absolutism as a threat  that might generate abrupt political change and for this reason avoid a  model of history as permanent breakage. Rupture is evoked only to be  contained. While discussions of Horace Walpole’s Castle of Otranto and Clara  Reeve’s Old English Baron have frequently emphasised the gothic rather  than the historical, examining these two works in relation to Thomas  Leland’s Longsword (often a point of cursory comparison) allows a new  understanding of how and why such novels might be related to the genre  of historical fiction.12 In Longsword (a historical romance supposed to  make ‘straightforward’ use of history) inherited liberties provide a way  of avoiding the rupture threatened by the political corruption of absolut- ism.13 Nonetheless, Leland struggles to imagine the survival of constitu- tional liberty without the guarantee afforded by the divine right of kings.  It is this struggle (rather than similarity of plot, as usually assumed)  that connects Longsword and Otranto. Reading Walpole’s novel along- side Leland’s, it becomes evident that Otranto’s tonal inconsistencies  arise not only, as Toni Wein and others have suggested, as a result of  Walpole’s dislike of Grenville’s political manoeuvring, but because of  his vexed attitude to absolutism and the Old Whigs.14 The resulting  combination of Old Whig and Jacobite allusions found in Otranto is  </page> <page sequence="5"> Ancient Liberties    27 what distresses Clara Reeve. Her Old Whig sympathies and suspicion of  Otranto are well known.15 Less evident, however, is the way in which  Reeve adapts the political motifs available in both Longsword and The  Castle of Otranto in order to argue that the Old Whigs’ model of the  distribution of power could survive the burgeoning capitalist economy.  Originating not from the context of the French Revolution but from  ongoing constitutional struggle, these Whig anxieties become enduring  concerns of the British historical novel. Once the paradigmatic status of the French Revolution on the form  of the historical novel is interrogated, Thomas Leland appears a more  significant figure in the genre’s development.16 Irish historian and  classical scholar, the Reverend Leland came to the notice of the Whig  politician James Caulfeild, Earl of Charlemont, on the publication of  a Latin translation The Orations of Demosthenes (1756). Caulfeild,  described in A Catalogue of the Royal and Noble of Authors as a true  patriot ‘unwarped by party spirit, and untainted by venal views’ and ‘a  nobleman of taste and literature’, was perhaps impressed by the work’s  timeliness.17 In 1752 David Hume argued for Britain’s role in keeping  the ‘balance of power’ within Europe, by suggesting the classical prece- dent of Demosthenes’ orations to the Megalopolitans.18 Two years later,  coinciding with publication of Leland’s translation, the issue of such  balance was extended outside Europe with the start of the French and  Indian War (1754–63), which drastically reduced French possessions in  North America. Leland seems to have watched the British attitude to the  conflict with alarm. In his Preface he comments on the Athenians’ initial  lack of political will when confronted by Philip: Although the Athenians were possessed with delicacy and sensibility, and  entertained magnificent ideas of virtue and its duties, yet they wanted applica- tion, constancy, and perseverance. The good qualities which had long been  the boast of that people, were now disappearing, while their faults increased.  Hence it was, that they easily suffered themselves to be lulled into a false  security.19 Here Leland uses eighteenth-century British interest in the Athenians’  sea-faring empire in order to promote determined self-defence: any  reluctance to pursue the French, Leland argues by analogy, stems from  the decline of civic virtue. Discontented Whigs who used the language of classical civic human- ism to criticise contemporary politics also often appropriated Britain’s  own past in support of the cause. Hence, like the Orations, Leland’s  Longsword, Earl of Salisbury; An Historical Romance is appropriate  to its political moment, a moment in which the need to preserve the  </page> <page sequence="6">  28    Reinventing Liberty balance of powers outside the state led to doubts over the distribution  of power within Britain. When George III came to the throne in 1760  his inaugural speech to the Privy Council, written by the Earl of Bute,  emphasised the need to bring an end to the conflict: ‘as I mount the  throne in the midst of a bloody war, I shall endeavour to prosecute it  in the manner most likely to bring an honourable and lasting peace’ –  before, that is, William Pitt altered the wording.20 When France then  entered into negotiations with Spain, Pitt argued that Britain should  declare war against the Spanish monarch, King Charles III. His uncom- promising approach led to Cabinet opposition and he was forced to step  down in October 1761; subsequently, the First Lord of the Treasury  the Duke of Newcastle resigned on 26 May 1762 and was replaced  by the king’s favourite, John Stuart, third Earl of Bute. Given Bute’s  Stuart connection, this raised alarm over George III’s attitude to the role  of the monarchy. As Pocock remarks: ‘It has many times been shown  that the king was acting within the normal conventions of politics and  had no thought of acting otherwise, but the fact remains that he was  denounced, and that language was available to denounce him, for acting  outside Whig rules.’21 The resultant concerns with favouritism, monarchical absolutism, and  the French threat to empire are reflected in Longsword. Insisting on a  parallel between virtue and certain forms of political behaviour, Leland’s  novel uses the reign of Henry III, when territories had just been won in  Gascony, to warn George III about the dangers of favouritism and  absolutism. In the first volume of this politically didactic romance, set  largely in France, William Longsword, Earl of Salisbury, is shipwrecked  and kidnapped, his presumed death threatening his English inheritance.  Here the behaviour of the dishonest French nobleman Count Mal-leon  represents the danger of corrupted values should Britain fail to keep  the balance of power in Europe. Crossing back over the Channel to  England, the second volume refines the lesson, revealing a threat to  inheritance and civic peace from the king’s favourite, Hubert de Burgh,  and his follower Raymond. Leland’s plot thus exploits the belief that  ‘French contamination had been an evil since the Norman Conquest  and could be thrown off now only by Britons becoming more moral  and more united.’22 Britain, the novel argues, can only keep the balance  abroad if the distribution of power at home is correct. The need for  domestic political probity is further reinforced by an inset story referring  to the Barons’ Revolt in the reign of King John. Admittedly, Leland’s  warning remains politically cautious. In both main and subplot, the  possibility of political rupture is present but ultimately avoided: William  Longsword battles corruption and regains his inheritance; King John  </page> <page sequence="7"> Ancient Liberties    29 (extra-textually) signs Magna Carta. Nonetheless, by directing the  ‘clear’ stream of history, he has heavily underlined the importance of  politically moral behaviour – a vital weapon, he suggests, in the struggle  to maintain civic peace and imperial strength. The drift of Leland’s ethico-political message in Longsword recalls  the Old Whig suspicion of political corruption. For Leland, problems  with the balance of power abroad and its distribution at home relate  to excessive personal ambition of the kind associated with Sir Robert  Walpole’s government. Hence, in this narrative, while a desirable  balance between aristocratic autonomy and monarchical authority  is guaranteed by drawing upon ancient liberties and well-established  codes, problems with such authority are caused by an (implicitly)  modern and individualistic attitude to wealth, position and power.  Worse still, discontent spreads from ambitious aristocrats to the  lower ranks. Early in the novel, for instance, Leland sets up a contrast  between the honourable Les Roches and the corrupt Count Mal-leon  as well as between the ‘brave and generous sons of honourable war’  and their ‘sullen’, financially motivated counterparts.23 No longer  protected by the objectivity of convention, these ambitious members  of the lower ranks, like their leader, Mal-leon, feel dissatisfaction with  their class position. Here the concern about the replacement of a more  feudal economy with an apparently more mobile capitalist one meets  the preoccupation with the proper way to distribute power within the  state and Europe. Leland offers his clearest alternative to such individual political ambi- tion in his inset tale. Here honour is linked with having a confident non- servile sense of social place – and such independence it seems can only  come from ancient liberties. This is demonstrated by the story of the  peasant Edmund, whose fiancée is attacked by a courtier. Edmund kills  the nobleman and is taken before King John where he ‘acknowledge[s]  the crime, and with decent boldness declare[s] himself resigned to the  punishment’.24 Edmund is ‘modest but not abject’ – in other words, he  has a sense of his lower social place but he does not, to use Shaftesbury’s  words, ‘idolize the next in power above [him]’ (as Shaftesbury suggests  the French do).25 Instead, as that almost oxymoronic phrase ‘decent  boldness’ suggests, Edmund corresponds to an Old Whiggish fantasy  of the behaviour of the lower ranks: named after the Christian king  of East Anglia, St Edmund (c. 841–70), Leland’s peasant is able to act  without servility because he is a representative of a society supposed to  possess ancient liberties. His difficulties arise only because he does not  find himself in such a society but under Norman rule at the very moment  when the barons are rebelling against King John. </page> <page sequence="8">  30    Reinventing Liberty In fact, despite Edmund’s good political antecedents and William’s  final success, counter-examples to honour and ‘decent boldness’ pro- liferate in Longsword. Leland finds that it is insufficient to argue that  antiquity legitimates and ultimately protects good political practice.  Instead, it seems he wants to argue that what he construes as politically  virtuous behaviour will succeed simply because it is virtuous. To do  so, he first hints (as he does in his Preface) that language is a transpar- ent medium through which virtue and vice can plainly be perceived,  making right action easy. In A Dissertation on the Principles of Human  Eloquence (1764) he proposes that passion generated by ‘intercourse  with mankind’ ‘naturally and unavoidably produce[s] an elevation  or vehemence of speech’; this eloquence is a guarantee of sincerity.26  However, the rhetorical evidence of passion can be ‘counterfeit’, and  not only the ‘ignorant and turbulent’ crowd but ‘a person of the great- est refinement’ can be deceived.27 Exposing such deceit is the challenge  faced by William and Les Roches when they try to confront Mal-leon  for attempted murder. When one of the corrupted soldiers is called  forward to ‘reveal’ Les Roches’s supposedly rebellious schemes, ‘falling  upon his knees and lifting up his eyes towards heaven, he called on  every saint to bear witness to his innocence’.28 The soldiers believe this  perjury and the only recourse for William is to attempt to contradict the  count by meeting him in single combat. Tellingly, though, this option,  which in medieval society offers civil justice a divine underpinning, is in  Longsword successfully avoided by political evildoers, whether French  or Norman-English. Leland might like to assert the transparency of lan- guage and the interpretability of evidence with Enlightenment optimism  but his own practice and knowledge of the world dictate otherwise. Given the difficulty of distinguishing truth from falsehood in any  immediate way (even in a society that accepts the efficacy of trial by  combat), Leland insists on the importance of justice. Yet this too may  be undermined. When William believes he has been usurped, he decides  to go to court to appeal to the king. Here, the court of England is  momentarily presented as a place where disinheritance and oppression  are reversed. This royal fairness, William suggests, is as much due to  the other nobles at court as it is a result of the ‘justice of young Harry’.  Nonetheless, this status quo is still threatened by the presence of the  favourite, Hubert, as the knight Randolph suggests: ‘“Alas,” said he,  “little can thy honest heart conceive of that craft and wily insinua- tion with which this courtier hath wound himself to the heart of his  easy Prince . . . the remotest corner of the realm feels his pernicious  influence”.’29 In Leland both justice and the distribution of power are  guaranteed by the conduct of the monarch – and yet his behaviour is  </page> <page sequence="9"> Ancient Liberties    31 no longer legitimised by the divine right of kings and is likely to be  undermined by internecine strife. Thus, although, as Toni Wein notes,  Longsword compliments the youthful George III, this work also admon- ishes him.30 Avoiding unconstitutional favouritism, George III must,  Leland suggests, behave so that he is ‘dreaded by the enemies of justice  and his kingdom’; the alternative is political chaos.31 Leland concedes that there is a potential weakness at the heart  of British government. The mixed constitution of eighteenth-century  Britain is not underpinned by the rhetorically superb defence of the  divine right of kings. This anxiety provides the point of connection  between Longsword and The Castle of Otranto. Admittedly, in forty- eight volumes of correspondence Walpole fails to mention the earlier  historical romance and the two novels are markedly different in terms  of their tone and treatment of morality. Reflecting this difficulty, com- parisons between The Castle of Otranto and Longsword, while com- monplace, are often based merely on superficial similarities of plot.32  Nonetheless, Walpole and Leland share an interest in the distribution  of power: both works examine the threat of absolutism and hint at the  possibility of a return to something similar under George III. Walpole,  however, has a more ambivalent attitude to the notion of ancient con- stitutional liberty. Although he disliked absolutism, he acknowledges  the political ambiguity of the ‘gothic’ myth – a myth that had been used  against his own father. Walpole’s work represents a humorous exag- geration of the contemporary political concerns expressed by Leland: for  Walpole, a return to the absolutism formerly associated with the Stuarts  seems at once terrifying and unlikely.33 The Castle of Otranto’s origins in the political events of 1763 and  1764 are familiar.34 As Mowl recounts, on 25 April 1763 Wilkes’s anti- establishment journal the North Briton, formerly used to attack Bute,  alleged that ‘the King had been tricked by his ministers into telling lies’;  George Grenville ‘in an action more Stuart than Hanoverian’, issued a  general warrant. When the warrant’s legality was debated in parliament,  Walpole and his cousin Henry Seymour Conway disagreed with the gov- ernment.35 Like Leland, then, Walpole was aware of the suggestion that  George III was trying to alter the political structure, allegedly encouraged  by the Stuart Bute towards a return to absolutism. But whereas Leland  is coy about the ideological weight of his fictionalised history, Walpole’s  novel is playfully explicit regarding the political implications of his nar- rative. It is a critical commonplace that the ambiguous subtitle to the  second edition, ‘A Gothic Story’, refers both to antiquarian interests and  to the gothic tradition of political commentary which enjoyed consider- able popularity during the late seventeenth and most of the eighteenth  </page> <page sequence="10">  32    Reinventing Liberty century.36 This ‘gothic’ rhetoric (employed by Leland) had also been  exploited by the Jacobites in order to gain credit with disaffected  Whigs.37 In a cunning piece of rhetorical reversal, the Jacobites suggested  that the divinely sanctioned rule of the Stuarts had been supplanted with  an arbitrary monarchy likely to threaten ancient English constitutional  liberties. This rhetorical ploy was familiar to Walpole. Many of his fellow  antiquarians were Jacobites, a matter of amusement for Walpole when  writing to Richard Bentley in September 1753. ‘My love of abbeys’, he  remarked, ‘shall not make me hate the Reformation till that makes me  grow a Jacobite like the rest of my antiquarian predecessors.’38 Despite his sceptical awareness of the links between gothic and  Jacobite rhetoric, in Otranto Walpole follows Leland in retaining traces  of the opposition between ancient virtue and modern vice. Although  Manfred is not a tyrant, he shares the characteristics of Leland’s politi- cal villains – like Mal-leon, he avoids trial by combat through dishonest  means; like Raymond, he sees sexuality and brute force as a route to  power. Manfred parallels the supposed absolutist tendency in British  politics, while, on the other hand, Theodore, displays ‘vigour . . . decently  exerted’.39 With his roots in the ancient political order, Theodore’s self- worth recalls Leland’s Edmund. Nonetheless, Walpole’s awareness of  Jacobite rhetoric gives this Old Whiggish opposition between ambitious,  dishonourable tyranny and ‘decent boldness’ a new dimension. In this  ‘gothic’ context Walpole’s tale of a usurping family who hold power  for three generations before the fourth generation (Conrad) is killed  appears suspiciously close to the drama of Jacobitism: as the Stuarts  had wished, the usurper’s dynasty is finally threatened by the return  of the rightful heir. Theodore’s nobility is immediately perceptible in a  way that is reminiscent of the manner in which Charles Edward Stuart’s  exploits, after the Jacobite Uprising of ’45, were mythologised.40 Like  Theodore, Charles Edward was portrayed as personally courageous but,  equally, he was supposedly caught up in the ‘divinely ordained cycle  of events’ which was to lead to Stuart restoration and which ‘required  no human intervention’.41 Similarly, Walpole’s protagonist, although  brave, is unusually passive for a romance hero. His return to power  is ensured by ghostly intrusion. The giant suit of armour, a symbol of  rightful rule, contrasts with the humanity and potential vulnerability  of Theodore as the divinely ordained body of the Stuart heir contrasts  with his human form. Theodore’s emergence (apparently though not  actually) from peasant stock, corresponds to Stuart rhetoric. According  to Benjamin Bird, Theodore is a ‘proto-democratic figure’,42 reflecting  popularist Jacobite propaganda which argued the Stuarts, rather than  the Hanoverians, were the true representatives of the people. </page> <page sequence="11"> Ancient Liberties    33 This combination of political rhetorics (the Old Whiggish empha- sis on virtue alongside the motifs of Stuart propaganda) means that  Walpole has the resources to further Leland’s analysis of constitutional  power. Having found the motif of ancient constitutionalism an insuf- ficient justification, Leland had been forced to various inadequate  fallback positions. In contrast, Walpole deftly exacerbates the sources  of weakness identified by Leland. In his work both the transparency of  virtue and the operation of justice appears uncertain. Consequently, he  hints (as Leland never does) of the attractiveness of divine sanction for  the ruler, while simultaneously satirising any such Jacobite solution.  Walpole sets up the contrast between virtue and vice as strongly as  Leland, leading Samson to suggest Walpole saw ‘religion as a power- ful counterforce’ to tyranny.43 However, this is optimistic: to an even  greater extent than his predecessor, Walpole suggests the difficulty  of distinguishing between good and evil. Despite Theodore’s ‘grace  and humility’, Manfred needs very little cause to accuse him: ‘Villain!  Monster! Sorcerer! ’tis thou hast slain my son!’, he exclaims, and he is  swiftly followed by the mob who ‘caught the words from the mouth  of their lord’.44 As William and Les Roches had discovered, the mass  of listeners are unreflecting and emotional, making truth hard to distin- guish from falsehood. Walpole underlines the point: even the efforts of  Father Jerome seem likely only to perpetuate injustice, while Theodore,  unlike his predecessors William and Edmund, is cheerful about telling  necessary lies. If Leland wants to assert that virtue will triumph on its  own merits, Walpole’s treatment of Theodore suggests doubt concern- ing its efficacy. And if the direct power of virtue seems uncertain to Walpole, the  fallback mechanism of the law appears equally fallible. In Longsword  it initially seems as if William only has to appear at court to establish  his rights. In contrast, Theodore possesses some of the most emphatic  proofs of parentage provided in eighteenth-century fiction: he has a  birthmark, writings around his wrist, and evidence of his grandmother’s  marriage. Nonetheless, when Manfred accepts the truth he does not do  so because of empirical confirmation but because ‘the horrors of these  days, the vision we have but now seen, all corroborate thy evidence  beyond a thousand parchments’.45 Supernatural (even sanctified) aid is  necessary to ensure the operation of law. Yet this guarantee is ultimately  unconvincing, as Alfonso’s final appearance suggests: The moment Theodore appeared, the walls of the castle behind Manfred were  thrown down with a mighty force, and the form of Alfonso, dilated to an  immense magnitude, appeared in the centre of the ruins. Behold in Theodore,  the true heir of Alfonso! said the vision.46 </page> <page sequence="12">  34    Reinventing Liberty Here Walpole retains the tendency seen in Leland to insist that even dis- ruption supports continuity: Alfonso breaks the walls of the castle but,  because of his interference, the true heir will be able to inherit. Hence  the continuance of an old political order (an order connected with the  fair-mindedness of Theodore) is safeguarded. But this position is compli- cated because such continuity is ensured by divine agency. The parallel is  to the Jacobite suggestion, made to co-opt the Old Whigs, that the Stuart  dynasty was linked to the supposed liberties of the political past. Given  this combination of political rhetorics, the literal rupture of the castle  walls appears threatening. On the one hand, it suggests the dangers of  a return to absolutism. On the other, even more worryingly, it hints  at the pointlessness of recovering (or seeming to recover) the past for  political purposes. Leland had struggled to use history as warning and  compliment, arguing simultaneously for its ideological neutrality and  its ethical power: history is deep and clear. In contrast, Walpole is very  aware of the use and dissection of history (whether text or antiquarian  object) in the service of political rhetoric. History is searched for motifs  and devices to serve a political turn, dismembered for an ideological  purpose, becoming as fragmentary as Alfonso’s armour.47 Yet the final  episode of Otranto suggests that, when these tropes are forcefully reas- sembled, the result is more threatening to existing political structures  than might have been anticipated. These political ambiguities generate the work’s tonal uncertainty.  For Leland, the operation of law is finally guaranteed by proper king- ship; in Otranto the only guarantee of right rule is a supernaturalism  that Walpole finds ridiculous. The supernatural tale is, according to  the ‘translator’ William Marshal, perhaps only designed to ‘confirm  the populace in their ancient terrors and superstitions’.48 As a coercive  device, the idea that the ruler is backed by divine authority, once so  politically persuasive, is now an outdated failure, connected with a  defunct Catholicism and represented bathetically by the interference not  of God himself but of the ‘dilated’ Alfonso. As when the servant Diego  sees the ‘foot and part of [a] leg’ of a ‘giant’ (or ‘Satan’ or a ‘ghost’),  absolutism is terrifying to the participants who cannot free themselves  from the chains of superstition, but ludicrous to those who are more  detached.49 Yet Walpole’s work makes a darker point, implying that  neither the appeal to the past nor the supposed transparency of political  virtue seem likely to ensure correct rule, while the resurrection of the  idea of a divinely guaranteed political order is farcical. The post-1688  mixed constitution lacks even the appearance of a firm ethical basis. Otranto, then, shares its broad political themes with Leland’s  Longsword, but whereas Leland argues against the political and  </page> <page sequence="13"> Ancient Liberties    35  domestic consequences of tyranny, Walpole at once displays and  undercuts them. It was this political and generic flamboyance that Clara  Reeve disliked. Hence in The Old English Baron she borrows from the  narrative of political virtue present in Longsword to correct the threat  to the rhetoric of constitutional stability found in Walpole’s Otranto.  However, this is by no means a dismissal of Walpole’s inventiveness in  relation to political tropes. In Reeve’s work the transparency of truth  and equity of the law espoused with limited success by Leland are  reinforced with a version of Walpole’s divine intervention, purged of  Jacobite associations. Reeve employs Walpole’s technique because, as  she sees it, the rise of moveable capital and increase in luxury radicalise  the threat of usurpation: it is no longer a matter primarily for aristo- crats but may occur at any social level. This increased danger to the  mixed constitution leads Reeve’s narrative of political virtue to be more  emphatic than Leland’s. The ambiguities introduced into the historical  romance by Leland and exaggerated by Walpole are minimised; what  narrative tension there is comes (as in Reeve’s later novels) from repeti- tion. In The Old English Baron, the possibility of rupture is persistently  raised and persistently dismissed because anxiety over aristocratic titles  and property has become a broader fear regarding brand legitimacy in a  mobile, commercial society. In his Lives Scott includes a letter in which Reeve emphasises the  influence of her father, an ‘Old Whig’ who ‘used to make [her] read  the Parliamentary debates’, which, she says, ‘fixed [her] principles once  and for ever’.50 Rather than supporting a brand of Whig thought allied  to court or commercial interests, Reeve’s father objected to Sir Robert  Walpole’s closeness to court, which was perceived to weaken an English  liberty originating with the Goths, Anglo-Saxons, or Normans51 – a  political stance also reflected, Reeve suggests, in his reading.52 Reeve’s  own critical work, The Progress of Romance (1785), continues this  literary project, notably emphasising that political corruption under  the Hanoverians is a result of the spread of luxury. Published eight  years before the Progress, Reeve’s most well-known and successful  work, The Old English Baron (significantly first published a year earlier  entitled The Champion of Virtue) combines the Old Whiggish thought  reminiscent of sections of Longsword with a concern over the transfer  of wealth. That The Old English Baron is, like Leland’s novel, concerned with  the relationship between the distribution of power and ethical probity is  immediately evident. Both novels are set in a period when momentarily  successful English claims to France are under threat – in Reeve’s case,  during the minority (1422–37) of Henry VI. The later reign of Henry VI  </page> <page sequence="14">  36    Reinventing Liberty was, as Gary Kelly notes, ‘used by eighteenth-century opponents of the  government, especially during the War of American Independence, as an  analogy for misguided leadership, political factionalism and civil strife,  and resulting loss of empire’.53 Notably, though, in concentrating on  the early years of his reign (rather than the particularly troubled period  after 1553) Reeve points to a time of precarious relative success before  territories are lost. In this early period, England, having claimed a right  to impressive territories in France, found these gains in dispute – Henry  VI had been crowned King of France in 1431, a claim Charles VII (son  of the previous French monarch) challenged. In relation to the loss of  colonial territory, the situation thus loosely parallels the position during  the Seven Years War, when the French challenged British holdings in  America. It also recalls Leland’s concern that this perennial enemy be  dealt with firmly, a possibility that Leland felt depended upon political  morality at home. Like Leland, Reeve sets up a strong moral opposition but her sug- gestion is that usurpation is not merely an aristocratic pastime. Hence,  while the crimes of Reeve’s central usurper Sir Walter generate the  plot, the determination of the middle and lower ranks to improve their  position without the currency of merit occupies most of the narrative.  Edmund’s chief enemy, the cadet Wenlock, an aristocratic hanger-on,  has the excessive ambition of Count Mal-leon, but his crimes are worse.  To preserve his comfortable position, Wenlock lays a plot that, if suc- cessful, would have involved his country in losses in their war against  France. Lower down the social scale, Twyford fills the role of discon- tented peasant, adopting Edmund in anticipation of undeserved gain.  Here Reeve’s anxiety exceeds that of Leland, who, in a brief narrative  moment, gestures towards the dangers of political vice in the lower  ranks – his dishonourable soldiers are encouraged by the bad example  of Mal-leon: ‘be assured of the favour of our Count’, one says to the  other.54 Twyford, however, has independent ambitions unsanctioned by  any aristocrat. Like Leland, Reeve constructs an emphatic alternative social para- digm in which such individualistic ambition is defunct. Protesting at  his willingness to stay with the humble Wyatts, the champion of virtue,  Sir Philip, remarks: ‘I am sorry . . . you should think me so dainty; I am  a Christian soldier; and him I acknowledge for my Prince and Master,  accepted the invitations of the poor, and washed the feet of his disci- ples.’55 In its codified austerity, such behaviour at once looks back to  Old Whiggish values and anticipates the service-orientated image of the  aristocracy emergent during the Napoleonic Wars. Reeve’s selection  of the name ‘Edmund’ for her hero heightens the emphasis on sturdy  </page> <page sequence="15"> Ancient Liberties    37  independence – for Leland, the narrative of the Saxon Edmund had  been an aside: his hero was William Longsword – a bastard Norman.  Thus, in an act of implied resistance to the French, Reeve argues for  the need to return to a gothic origin supposedly connected with liberty.  Predictably, then, like his namesake in Longsword, Edmund speaks  ‘with equal modesty and intrepidity’; he is ‘humble but not servile to  his patron’.56 The point is reinforced in relation to the lower-ranking  Wyatts. In parallel with Leland’s Edmund, Wyatt’s son, John, shows  a mixture of modesty and intrepidity. His father volunteers him for  Sir Philip’s service but doubtfully remarks ‘I fear he is not brought up  well enough’, in response to which John ‘could not forbear speaking’, a  linguistic  boldness seen by Reeve as a marker of honesty.57 Significantly, too, this enhanced narrative of Old Whig political virtue  has an even stronger emphasis on financial probity than in Leland’s  work. Sir Philip’s Christian charity stands in opposition not only to  Sir Walter’s greed but to the supposed spread of luxury under the  Hanoverians, while the peasant Wyatt asserts his freedom from the con- tamination of consumerism by putting moral qualifications before eco- nomic ones: ‘I am an honest man, though a poor one’, he says.58 Indeed,  it is Reeve’s attitude to the peasantry that proves the link between her  fear of luxury and her emphatic promotion of political virtue. In adopt- ing Edmund, Twyford embarks on a risky capitalist speculation which  may improve his financial and social status considerably. Tellingly,  however, Reeve does not allow Twyford’s gamble to succeed. As in  her later novel Destination (1799) (where the protagonist suffers from  repeated attempts to steal his business name), Reeve is concerned to  prevent the social mobility that might arise from trading on another’s  identity. Reeve provides an alternative route to personal success. When John is  given the opportunity for advancement, his father finds it unnecessary  to ‘make . . . terms’ for him with Sir Philip. 59A negative view on this is  offered by Abby Coykendall, who argues that Reeve has ‘transform[ed]  the mutually binding, albeit flagrantly unequal, contractual labour of  the Enlightenment era into the unpaid fealty and abject bondage of the  middle ages’.60 However, it is worth moderating this slightly. The con- trast, between speculative, money-orientated service and feudal loyalty  is not infrequent in eighteenth-century literature (witness the contrast  between Spalatro and Paulo in Radcliffe’s The Italian [1797] or between  the scene painter and the carpenter Christopher Jackson in Austen’s  Mansfield Park [1814]) but Reeve uses her Old Whig background to  argue that the feudal servant is not only more loyal but, paradoxically,  more independent. Although historians including Hume had argued that  </page> <page sequence="16">  38    Reinventing Liberty the growth of trade from the sixteenth century on had created greater  self-determination, for Reeve, capitalism and the consumer economy  are equated with a social mobility that generates disloyalty; in contrast,  a fixed social order is linked with ancient liberty. In contradistinction  to Coykendall’s suggestion, in this fantasy the Wyatts are emphatically  not made ‘abject’, by their willingness to trust Sir Philip – Wyatt, Reeve  states, is the ‘master of [his] house’.61 However, even in the ‘amiable’ genre of ‘Romance’, Reeve struggles to  recruit support for her stable society, repeatedly turning to the dubious  constitutional supports employed by Leland.62 As her predecessors  had done, Reeve repeatedly finds both the transparency of truth and  the efficacy of the law lacking. Edmund, she states, is ‘frank and unre- served’ but these markers of Old Whig political probity are  insufficient  – Wenlock too has the ‘appearance of candour’.63 True, Edmund’s  achievements in France mean that ‘Not a tongue presumed to move  itself against him; even malice and envy were silenced.’64 Nonetheless,  only a few pages later, the lies of the ‘cabal’, like water ‘wear[ing] away  a stone’, contaminate Edmund’s patron, the Baron.65 Faced with such  forceful epistemological erosion, Reeve, like Leland, attempts to shore  up the truth by the process of law. Brought before the Baron to justify  remarks made about the family, Edmund ‘demand[s] [his] trial’; yet  again, however, this position is weakened as he immediately admits that  his enemies’ ‘artifices’ make the outcome uncertain.66 Neither truth nor the law is ultimately effective in ensuring the  correct descent of property. This, however, is unacceptable to Reeve.  Hence, while Longsword suggests that law depends on the probity of  the king, Reeve attempts to underpin her legal system even more firmly,  suggesting it is divinely guaranteed. Initially, Edmund’s mother had  asserted she would never ‘cease complaining to God, and the King’,  a dual appeal Edmund repeats when tried by the Baron: ‘if . . . your  Lordship should be induced to think me guilty, I would . . . appeal to  another tribunal [Heaven]’.67 As for Edmund’s mother (and the Stuarts),  however, direct heavenly intervention is not immediately forthcoming.  Hence Reeve shifts the scene: Edmund’s trial by ordeal in the abandoned  wing of the house includes, in another departure from standard legal  testimony, the divinely guaranteed statements of his ghostly parents,  statements subsequently leading to the discovery of tokens of empirical  proof. The same types of evidence that reinforced Theodore’s claims are  present, but brought within Reeve’s definition of probability. Shoring  up Leland’s narrative of political virtue, these are indeed, as Walpole  puts it, ‘tame ghost[s]’, meant to provide divine guarantee of correct  succession without either Walpole’s element of farce or the shadow of  </page> <page sequence="17"> Ancient Liberties    39 Jacobitism.68 A similar manoeuvre can be traced when Sir Philip avoids  legal confusion by challenging Sir Walter to trial by combat. Sir Philip  becomes, in Reeve’s formulation, God’s ‘instrument to do justice on  the guilty’ – Walpole had had recourse to the threat of Alfonso’s leg;  more conventionally, Sir Philip’s ‘arm’ becomes a ‘minister of justice’.69  The British political system and the correct transfer of property has  been underpinned by a strange combination of Old Whig morality and  the faint echo of the divine right of kings, here present as God’s direct  involvement in ensuring political virtue. For Leland, Walpole and Reeve the terror of usurpation (arguably the  key anxiety in late eighteenth-century gothic) indicates an underlying  doubt about ancient constitutionalism. Legal structures do not seem suf- ficient to guarantee ancient liberties; the transfer of the constitution – and  of property – from generation to generation is vulnerable. For Walpole  (jokingly) and for Reeve (with deadly seriousness), the maintenance of  property and power relies on the dead past being believed to manifest,  divinely aided, in the present. The divine right of kings that was drawn  upon by the Stuarts must now be transformed, its energies diffused to  guarantee not only the monarchy but the constitution. Imagination  invokes supernatural power to support the status quo. However, as  these works testify, this political imaginary was under increasing pres- sure: how could a monarch keep the appearance of sublime virtue in the  midst of commercial modernity? Saxon Experiments and Radcliffe’s Gaston de Blondeville In its paranoid insistence on ancient constitutionalism, Clara Reeve’s  Old English Baron inadvertently testifies to a shift in relation to the Old  Whig notion of ‘ancient liberties’. In Reeve’s work, the appeal to past  political behaviour remains, but she is also preoccupied by the possibil- ity of increased social mobility in a commercial society, particularly as  it affects the lower orders. Reeve stresses that, like their superiors, those  of the lower ranks should also have a kind of liberty but one which  involves no essential change in their condition. In other words, Reeve’s  desire to police the narrative of ancient liberties testifies to the increasing  radical use of the paradigm in the late eighteenth century. According to  the ‘Norman Yoke’ theory of the Society for Constitutional Information  set up by Major John Cartwright and John Jebb, the invasion of William  the Conqueror had obliterated the structures and political freedoms  found in Saxon modes of government. Thomas Paine (a member of the  Society) put the argument in its strongest terms, suggesting that if the  </page> <page sequence="18">  40    Reinventing Liberty ‘succession’ from William ‘runs in the line of the conquest, the nation  runs in the line of being conquered, and it ought to rescue itself from this  reproach’.70 Significantly, this particular narrative of a return to politi- cal origin did not only involve a readjustment between the monarch  and ruling class, but between the government and the people. This new  emphasis on the economic well-being and political protection of the  people is present in the historical novel of the period, as Anne Fuller’s  1789 novel, Son of Ethelwolf demonstrates. It is to the radical potential  of this variety of ancient constitutionalism that Burke responds in his  Reflections on the Revolution in France. Yet Burke’s account further  problematises the trope – and the resultant difficulties are evident both  in the 1791 novel, Edwy, Son of Ethelred the Second: An Historic Tale  and Radcliffe’s Gaston. Anne Fuller seems to have enjoyed a degree of success despite her early  death in 1790. What is generally accepted as her first novel, Alan Fitz- Osborne (1787) was translated into French, while her second novel, Son  of Ethelwolf, was given a favourable write-up in the Monthly Review.71  In 1796 it was still in the mind of the theatre critic for the Monthly  Mirror, who berating the drama ‘The Magic Banner’, advises the writer  to read Fuller’s novel: ‘a very interesting and not undramatic attempt to  expand the history of Alfred’.72 The author’s fame even spread as far as  the Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, which praises the work but seems to  find it only too historical: more could have been done with Alfred’s char- acter, the writer suggests.73 That Fuller’s interest in history was coloured  by ancient constitutionalism is further suggested by the fact that Alan  Fitz-Osborne (1787) is sometimes compared to The Old English Baron  (ostensibly because both works contain a ghost). Yet Son of Ethelwolf,  while still drawing on ancient constitutionalism, is decidedly more  radical in tone than Reeve’s Old Whiggish narrative. Rather than focus- ing on liberty within a fixed social structure, Fuller’s work emphasises  how Alfred’s lawgiving propensities benefit the ordinary people. Fuller begins the work with a dedication to the Prince of Wales, as she  suggests, by permission. This dedication makes reference to the Regency  Crisis of 1788–9, when, during the king’s illness, there was a fierce  debate over the powers and necessity of a regent. Celebrating George  III’s recovery, ‘Heaven’, Anne Fuller says, has restored to the prince a  ‘father, to England a sovereign, worthy of the tears that were recently  shed for him, and of the happiness that his recovery now inspires.’74 Her  use of the passive construction to describe such conventional grief was  perhaps wise. Both the Prince of Wales and his ally, Charles James Fox,  a proponent of parliamentary reform, had seemed self-interested in the  rush to institute a regency during the king’s illness. These were reformers  </page> <page sequence="19"> Ancient Liberties    41 willing to assert (along with Burke during this crisis) the importance of  hereditary succession in a way reminiscent of the seventeenth century.  Read in this context, Fuller’s laudatory dedication to the prince seems  (like that given by Leland to George III) to be ambiguous. The Prince  of Wales, one suspects, might have something to learn from the habits  of that great lawgiver, Alfred. Anne Fuller’s novel opens in a peasant’s hut, where the servant,  Edbald, comes in late from the storm and is reproved by Winefreda, the  herdsman’s wife, ‘for his awkwardness in domestic offices’. The scene  is set, it is gradually revealed, in the aftermath of the Danish attack  on Chippenham in 878 and the incompetent servant is Alfred himself.  In this opening episode, Alfred’s forbearance and his praise for the  ‘tranquillity’ of the ‘humble’ (and, crucially, unambitious) existence of  the people strike a fairly conventional note, but the peasant Dunwolf’s  bravery, military service for his country and subsequent neglect are  rather less usual.75 In his own travails, Alfred is beginning to learn  how the separation between the king and the people prevents justice, a  theme which becomes more explicit in the second volume. There, Alfred  is again given hospitality by peasants but when he compliments them  on their ‘cheerful’ looks, they make it plain that it is only a ‘semblance  of mirth’: in actual fact the Danish oppressors have carried off their  grain.76 To them, even the return of Alfred, the ‘good and just’ would,  they tell him: be . . . productive of no material alteration. We should change our masters,  but we should not be freed from oppression . . . subject to the deprivation of  a hard earned property at the will of an imperious superior.77 A regime change has little effect on those lower down the social scale  who still suffer from excessive taxation. When Alfred (whose identity  is unknown to them) asks why they could not ‘carry to [the king] their  complaints’, they reply that ‘our cries cannot penetrate to the throne, for  it is surrounded by persons whose interest it is not to suffer them to be  heard’.78 Unjust taxation is accompanied (as the American colonists had  found) with a lack of political representation. This is a situation Alfred  vows to correct and such correction implicitly involves rejecting ‘flat- tery’ (something the Prince of Wales is warned about by the ‘freeborn  people of England’ in the dedication).79 However, in this novel it proves too difficult (it is unclear whether  on literary, historical or political grounds) to show Alfred ending the  oppression of taxation. Rather, Fuller contents herself with remarking  on the connection between law and commerce: supported by peace- ful legality, commerce ‘pour[s] the products of far distant realms into  </page> <page sequence="20">  42    Reinventing Liberty [Alfred’s] dominion’.80 The reader is left to assume that, with Alfred  restored, the peasantry presumably enjoy their share of prosperity along  with the rest. Meanwhile, since depicting tax reform is so awkward,  Alfred’s clearest act of justice takes place in the sexual arena (thus fore- shadowing the thematic link between political and sexual health in the  novel of ideas in the 1790s). The peasant Adelfrida has been taken by  the nobleman Siward who has promised to marry her – a promise which  he fails to fulfil. Alfred intervenes and sends Siward back to the girl’s  grandfather, who angrily claims he will turn to Alfred for justice. From  the elder’s perspective, Siward may be a noble and Adelfrida’s family  peasants but they still have the right to appeal to the law. On hearing  this, Alfred is not, as Siward expects, ‘offended’: ‘Offended,’ returned Alfred, ‘offended at what makes my pleasure, my pride,  my happiness! The words of Adelfrid are my best eulogium. Did Guthrum  [the Danish ruler] fill my place, the old man had not trusted to the power  of the laws; – he has more confidence in Alfred: – he knows that he respects  them.’81 Instead of feeling pride solely in his superior status, Alfred acknowledges  the law as an external force, one that applies to all people no matter  what their rank. In this emphasis Fuller reflects (albeit in seemingly  loyalist terms) the changing use of the narrative of ancient liberties in  the late 1780s. Whereas in Longsword, Otranto and The Old English  Baron ancient constitutionalism had been used in relation primarily to  the rights of the upper ranks (even the peasants Theodore and Edmund  turn out to be aristocrats), Fuller’s narrative is more radical. Here it  is the people rather than a class of political intermediaries that should be  the primary beneficiaries of the narrative of ancient liberties. Yet equally  clearly, as in the earlier fictions of ‘ancient liberty’, the law that should  maintain freedom is still vexingly dependent on the monarch’s character. In the Reflections Burke responds to this growing emphasis within  the discourse of ancient constitutionalism on the liberties of the people  rather than the aristocracy, arguing that the ‘legal hereditary succes- sion of the crown’ is considered by the English people ‘as among their  rights, not as among their wrongs’.82 For Burke, the constitution forms  a kind of ‘artificial infinite’, a sublime construction which includes the  monarchy.83 Significantly, even when he is forced to discuss political  rupture, he stresses the importance of camouflage. Considering the  Glorious Revolution (1688), Burke notes that Lord Somers, who drew  the Declaration of Right, used ‘address’ to keep ‘this temporary solution  of continuity’ ‘from the eye’. According to Burke, this moment of break- age only exists to ensure stability – the Declaration ‘settled for ever’ the  </page> <page sequence="21"> Ancient Liberties    43 future of the monarchy.84 Contra the theory of the Norman Yoke, Burke  argues that there is a direct line from Anglo-Saxon legal structures to the  present day. There is no need for a return to purer origins: the current  arrangement is the one that benefits the people. However, the use of ancient constitutionalism in the Reflections is  necessarily rather different from those found either in the seventeenth  century or in parliamentary circles in the 1760s. Burke cites the opinion  of Sir Edward Coke on the ‘oldest reformation’ of the monarchy –  according to Coke, Burke suggests: the antient charter, the Magna Charta [sic] of King John, was connected with  another positive charter from Henry I and that both the one and the other  were nothing more than a re-affirmance of the still more antient standing law  of the kingdom.85 In this standard narrative of ancient constitutionalism both the 1100  Charter of Liberties (also known as the Coronation Oath of Henry I)  and Magna Carta (1215), which placed restrictions on the power of the  monarchy, are seen to date from the earlier structures of Anglo-Saxon  law. When Coke made this argument, in the seventeenth century, as  Ivo Kamps notes, ‘the practical consequences . . . were that historically  James I’s royal prerogatives did not originate from the king himself  and were therefore circumscribed by law’; at that period, ‘historians  like Spelman took a line more favourable to James when he argued  that parliament post-dated the Norman Conquest’.86 In the 1760s the  debate had centred on the same (alleged) fear of royal absolutism and  the erosion of parliamentary power. After the Regency crisis and at the first moment of the French  Revolution, however, the case had altered, as had the political valence  of the narrative of the Norman Yoke. Although Burke had been a  keen supporter of limitations on monarchical power, in 1790 he was  concerned to argue against later, more radical uses of ‘ancient liberty’.  Hence Burke employs ancient constitutionalism to restrict the rights of  the people. The ‘old fanatics of single arbitrary power’, Burke argues,  ‘dogmatised as if hereditary royalty was the only lawful government in  the world, just as our new fanatics of popular arbitrary power, main- tain that a popular election is the sole lawful source of authority’.87  Burke suggests that, as well as restricting monarchical power above, the  narrative of ancient liberties also prevents its spread below. In Burke’s  narrative royalty is not the enemy: the royal behaviours that made  Magna Carta necessary are temporarily overlooked and the period  ‘after the conquest’ is seen not in terms of breakage but as a time in  which key liberties were enshrined. The more radical narrative of the  </page> <page sequence="22">  44    Reinventing Liberty Norman Yoke that the Society for Constitutional Information used is  overwritten. Burke reinforces this argument with one of the shifts in perspective  that his opponents found so annoying. Speaking at large about those  who followed Coke, he writes: In the matter of fact for the greater part, these authors appear to be in the  right; perhaps not always: but if the lawyers mistake in some particulars,  it proves my position still the more strongly; because it demonstrates the  powerful prepossession towards antiquity, with which the minds of all our  lawyers and legislators, and of all the people whom they wish to influence,  have always been filled.88 The argument, first based on legal authority and the ‘fact’ of historical  precedent, is now a matter of opinion, intention and emotion. Moreover,  for Burke, the radical suggestions of the Society for Constitutional  Information not only deviate from properly understood versions of  ancient constitutionalism but also fail the commercial test of modernity.  The political books circulated by the Society ‘might’ otherwise ‘lie on  the hands of the booksellers’.89 In this account, the present-day monarch  and the market are discretely allied, rendering the spread of political  knowledge an act of unwanted charity. Although the narrative of ancient constitutionalism (in various forms)  proved persistent, there were, as Burke’s careful manoeuvres suggest,  significant and growing difficulties with the notion of ‘ancient liberties’.  The first was the fit of such ideas with commercial modernity. When  Burke implies that it is the Society rather than the monarch which is out  of tune with the market, for instance, he does so indirectly: the monarch  of a commercial society is an inglorious figure in chivalric terms. In fact,  ancient constitutionalism performed little imaginative work when it  came to positing the relationship between the monarchical and constitu- tional sublime and the market. For instance, whilst in Waverley Scott is  able to imagine a benign Hanoverian monarch reigning over commercial  Britain, in Ivanhoe (published in 1819 and most directly pertinent to the  narrative of ancient liberties) the monarch Richard I has to be absent for  most of the text in order to remain free from the vicious entrepreneurial- ism of the Norman barons. By 1823 in Quentin Durward matters are  still worse. The monarch who presides over the transition to the modern  French state is himself a figure of commercial corruption: Louis XI  ‘resembled the merchant or shopkeeper of the period’ and the uncom- plimentary nature of this is evident since he can also be mistaken for a  ‘decoy duck’ working for a ‘murderer’.90 Although the market may itself  be seen as infinite, in its day-to-day manifestations it is less than morally  </page> <page sequence="23"> Ancient Liberties    45 glamorous. The monarch of a commercial state is a far less sublime  figure than that evoked by Burke’s artificial infinite. In addition, the appeal to custom was equally intellectually fragile.  Back in 1767, in an Essay on the English Constitution, Edward King  had queried the tendency to defend the constitution on the grounds of  antiquity alone: ‘One would suppose,’ he remarks, that the constitution  could be: defended on no other principles, than those of its having been established  in nearly the same form wherein it now exists, for ages immemorial. A fact  which some have with great labour and difficulty endeavoured to render  probable; but of which there is much reason to suspect the truth.91 The constitution, King argues, is not static. On the contrary, he suggests,  the ‘ancient constitution . . . was such as we may reasonably suppose  to have been most fit and expedient for the Nation at those times’.92 In  this account, the ancient constitution becomes something that evolves  according to society’s stage of economic development. King moderates  the narrative of ancient liberty so much that it becomes stadial history.  After the publication of Reflections, unease with the legitimatising force  of custom increased: radicals like Wollstonecraft saw no reason to join  Burke in ‘reverenc[ing] the rust of antiquity’.93 The situation was further  complicated because (particularly given what Pocock notes is the fictive  status of ancient constitutionalism) the original moment at which the  ancient constitution was in operation was hard to trace. These difficulties with the sustaining force of custom and heritage,  particularly in relation to luxury, are evident in the 1791 novel, Edwy,  Son of Ethelred the Second: An Historic Tale. The work maintains the  fiction of a return to political origins, suggesting that ‘the AUGUST  family who now possess the English Crown are Saxons’.94 This, then,  is a kind of reversion, presumably to ancient liberty, yet the novel’s  attitude to the Saxons themselves is not entirely positive, modifying the  compliment. Although the final chapters of the book evoke the theory of  the Norman Yoke by suggesting the tyranny of William the Conqueror,  most of the narrative is concerned with the failure of Saxon rule and  Saxon morality. Here, Anglo-Saxon decline follows the iniquity of  Edgar in killing Athelwold and marrying Elfrida. The corrupt nature  of Elfrida’s son, Ethelred (commonly known as the ‘Unready’), suppos- edly leads to the murder of his elder half-brother Edward the Martyr,  to several generations of Danish rule and to the defeat of Edmund II  (‘Edmund Ironside’, King of Wessex). Although Edmund challenges  the Danish ruler to single combat to decide the fate of England (in a  way rather reminiscent of the single combat proposed by William in  </page> <page sequence="24">  46    Reinventing Liberty Longsword and carried out in The Old English Baron), the attempt  fails and Edmund is eventually assassinated. Matters are no better under  Edward the Confessor: it is his indecision about his successor that leads  to William of Normandy’s invasion. While the book concentrates on this narrative of decline and dispos- session, it also shows some passing concern with the resultant economic  state of the country. It is clear to the author that Anglo-Saxon poverty  (following the oppressions of the Danes) is as unsatisfactory as (sup- posed) Danish luxury. Yet a prosperity which avoids luxurious corrup- tion is hard to achieve. Whilst the rule of law would, the book implies,  aid commercial and moral probity, the Anglo-Saxon kings are unable to  guarantee the order that would allow trade. Meanwhile, under Danish  rule taxation impoverishes the original inhabitants of the country;  and matters deteriorate further after the Norman Conquest, an event  which leads to the depopulation of the once prosperous communities  of the New Forest. As such, this novel transforms Reeve’s worry about  the relation between inherited wealth and power and the ambitions of  the lower ranks: here the fear is that the failure of rule will generate,  not working-class immorality, but widespread economic disruption.  Meanwhile, Edwy, the central character, spends much of the narrative  bemoaning his loss of his inherited position (a doubly dubious habit  by eighteenth-century mores since he has been born out of wedlock).  A rather unsympathetic narrator who listens to the stories of others  while mostly remaining sheltered from events, he still finds time to  condemn increasing Anglo-Saxon lethargy. His constant lament is for  the ‘Unhappy race of Ethelred!’95 Edwy is, as the author admits, a  ‘perfect blank’ to history (although ‘all historians agree’ he existed) and  also a largely inactive onlooker in the novel – far more so even than  Scott’s Waverley.96 Even in the midst of a struggle for liberty, action  proves hard to take. If, in contrast to Burke’s sublime of succession, Edwy suggests that  the ancient constitution was threatened before the Normans, for Ann  Radcliffe the idea of liberty after the Conquest appears equally fraught.  Apparently responding to Burke, Ann Radcliffe’s last and largely  neglected novel Gaston de Blondeville (published in 1826 but said to  have been finished around 1803) suggests that the tale of (English) con- stitution is not one of continuity but of constant disruption. Radcliffe is  of course most famous for her gothic novels of the 1790s and the rever- berations of the Old Whiggish narrative of ancient liberties in such writ- ings are considerable, albeit not always recognised. In fact, as Radcliffe’s  own writing makes clear, in part late eighteenth-century gothic can be  seen as a comment on feudal (that is, post-Norman) i niquities (although  </page> <page sequence="25"> Ancient Liberties    47 any direct relationship to the notion of the Norman Yoke is weak- ened by the foreign settings often used in such works). Typical here is  The Italian (1797) where if hereditary power is to survive, it must be  updated.97 In particular, Radcliffe suggests, in order to avoid the perils  of tyranny, the structures of authority supported by primogeniture need  to become less autocratic and superstitious. Representative of the new  generation of rulers, Vivaldi, the hero, is not perfect but he is better than  the other (implicit) representatives of state and church in the novel – that  is, his proud, unfeeling aristocratic father and his vicious, unnatural, and  Catholic mother. Radcliffe, then, espouses a limited form of progress  without wishing to break with inherited forms of property and power.  Yet the feeling evident in Radcliffe’s work that the past is certainly no  more a place of liberty than the present puts her in a good position to  reply to Burke. In noting Gaston de Blondeville’s similarity to William Godwin’s  Things as They Are; Or, the Adventures of Caleb Williams (1794),  Claudia Johnson implies the work’s relevance to the post-French  Revolution debate.98 Like Godwin’s Caleb, the protagonist of Radcliffe’s  novel, Hugh Woodreeve, is in possession of information which his social  superior, Gaston, does not want revealed. This is a narrative of misused  authority: when Woodreeve accuses Gaston of being involved in the  murder of his kinsman, Reginald de Folville, a plot is carried out by  Gaston and the corrupt Prior to prevent him receiving justice. Worse  still, King Henry III is unwittingly complicit in this planned miscarriage  of justice. However, the novel’s concern with the balance of power and  the intervention of a supernatural agency (the murdered de Folville  himself) also mean it can be placed in relation to Walpole, Reeve, Leland  and ancient constitutionalism.99 Radcliffe’s work deepens the doubts  present in those earlier novels: the Crown is corrupt and the tensions  between the aristocracy, clergy and people uncontrollable. In short, the  descendants of the Conqueror are as iniquitous as radical eighteenth- century theorists of the Norman Yoke might desire. However, the con- sistent corruption of the monarchy is such that any narrative of ancient  liberties begins to seem unlikely. Whereas Burke had created a kind of  sublime of tradition to support the monarchy and constitution, here the  use of history, ceremony and custom to control the past seems vulner- able. Most disturbingly, this novel is so filled with observers and their  comments that it seems impossible to achieve an accurate interpretation,  not only of history, but of any narrative, image or event. In Gaston de Blondeville scepticism about the ‘sacred’ institution,  monarchy, is immediately evident. In the frame narrative two contem- porary travellers, Simpson and Willoughton, discuss Queen Elizabeth’s  </page> <page sequence="26">  48    Reinventing Liberty reign, reflecting on the duty and ability of past monarchs to protect  ‘the wayfaring part of his Majesty’s liege subjects’. The protection  provided by past monarchs seems dubious given that the ‘thick and  gloomy woods’ through which loyal subjects had to travel were also  the ‘home of the doubtful fugitive’.100 The moral conduct of those  who wear the crown is also open to critique. When the more poetic  antiquarian Willoughton asserts that Elizabeth’s ‘wisdom partook too  much of craft’ and her ‘cruelty to poor Mary is a bloody hand in her  escutcheon’, Simpson suggests his companion is ‘too ardent . . . much  may be said on her conduct on that head’: morality and statecraft are  two different things.101 Mary’s execution, the imprisonment of Edward  II at Kenilworth (he is subsequently murdered) and even the death of  Charles I (too traumatic to allude to directly but present through the  allusions to Cromwell) all haunt the opening pages of this text, much as  Elizabeth’s ghost is said to occupy the ruins of Kenilworth. In the works  of Leland, Walpole and Reeve concern about the usurpation of power  is frequently displaced onto the aristocracy. Radcliffe is more forceful.  Here the unbroken monarchical succession which Burke boasts of seems  nothing more than a constant ‘[dis]solution of continuity’.102 By setting her narrative in the reign of Henry III Radcliffe underlines  this state of disruption. Coming to the throne in his minority, Henry  III had confirmed Magna Carta of King John but, like his father, he  attempted to renege, claiming he had been coerced. In suggesting  that Henry ‘never’ practised ‘such cruel means of extortion as did his  father, King John’, the fictional writer of Radcliffe’s manuscript, is  actually highlighting this unpleasant consistency.103 Further, Radcliffe,  via Willoughton, recalls the civil strife this prompted, remembering  ‘Montfort, on whom [Henry III] had bestowed Kenilworth, and who  added ingratitude to treason, by holding the fortress against his ben- efactor and liege lord’.104 As John had faced the Barons’ Revolt, Henry  had triggered the Second Barons’ War in which Simon de Montfort had  played a leading part, attempting radically to reform parliamentary  representation in the kingdom. Perusing an ancient manuscript, the travellers are initially confronted  with the past as a series of the images, static yet still redolent of instabil- ity and unease. Like all of the novel’s chapters, ‘The First Day’ begins  not with a drawing but with a description of a drawing: the fictional  past is already doubly mediated.105 Evidence is constantly distorted.  Although the image’s epigraph describes the ‘King and Queen, with their  train, passing under the towers of Kenilworth’, the picture also captures  an instant in the life of the ordinary people, an instant signalled by the  past progressive – when the soldiers lean forward to view the king, ‘the  </page> <page sequence="27"> Ancient Liberties    49 cap of one . . . was falling on the multitude below’. For the ‘man pressing  through the crowd, with eager gesticulation and a wild countenance’,  this is an instant as much of disquietude as amusement.106 What the  picture underlines is the distinction between what Wollstonecraft calls  the ‘cumbersome brocade of ceremony’ with its sense of unbending per- manence, and the exigencies, discord and class tensions of the political  moment.107 Radcliffe’s narrator uses an equally politically suggestive  metaphor, comparing the spectacle of the court’s arrival to the sublime  ruin of the aqueduct at Rome, ‘grander in its sweep than it might have  shown when’ complete, all the greater because it requires imagination to  reconstruct.108 Yet, the narrative emphasises, imagination will fail: the  governing structures of this country are emphatically not the ordered  whole, receding in grand perspective, which Burke’s sublime of tradition  suggests. Disharmony continues in the body of the chapter. The French queen’s  ‘Mynstrells of Music’ drown out the ‘bells of a village’ and the noise of  the ‘proud trumpeters’ triumphs over the ‘merry bugles’ of the forest- ers.109 Competition is also present on the social level. The castellan is  displeased by the monks’ attempts to present themselves to the king,  whilst the monks become glad to ‘follow in [the king’s] train’ because,  on his appearance, ‘the crowd was forced back’.110 In this ceremonial  welcome, then, the effete court and the religion and feelings of the  people; the country and the military power of the king; the civic and  religious authorities; and the king and the people, are all in aggressive  and damaging rivalry. Further, the hostility to the French favourite and  French queen represents more than traditional international enmity  or knee-jerk Francophobia. According to the narrator, ‘The walls and  turrets, thronged with faces, seemed to be alive and to shout, as with  one voice, “Queen Eleanor! long live Queen Eleanor!” – but some  few were heard to shout, “Away with the foreigners! – away with all  foreigners!”.’111 Recalling Marie Antoinette’s initial popularity with the  Parisians and their subsequent hostility to l’Autrichienne (as her oppo- nents called her), this uncanny anthropomorphism (the very walls cry  out) strikes a particularly grim note. The fear of ‘French contamination’  that Leland had played upon becomes a way of suggesting that this is a  discontented and potentially revolutionary society. Moreover, the imagery hints that responsibility for this discontent  lies with monarchical authority and its failure to control the competing  interests of the three estates: church, people and nobility. In reference  to Henry’s (documented) decision to have a mural of the Anglo-Saxon  saint and monarch, Edward the Confessor, painted on the wall of his  bedchamber, Radcliffe has Henry decorate the chapel at Kenilworth  </page> <page sequence="28">  50    Reinventing Liberty ‘with the story of . . . the Confessor, giving the ring off his finger to a  poor stranger’.112 Yet there is no continuity with Anglo-Saxon charity  (or presumably with Anglo-Saxon legal structures) here. Moreover, the  adoption of King Edward as role model is dubious: for the author of  Edwy his behaviour led to the Norman Conquest. In any case, Henry is  hypocritical. Although Henry in life is said to have copied the plainness  of Edward’s dress, Radcliffe’s monarch is less ascetic. The narrator- monk, Grymbald, remarks that with the ‘dignity of [Henry’s] carriage  there was mixed good humour’: this lack of emotional austerity is  gradually connected to a lack of self-control.113 By the time the monk  narrates ‘The Seventh Day’ he is willing to be more direct. Driven by  ‘sorrow and remorse’ at Gaston’s death, the king ‘with the intention, as  he persuaded himself, of preventing further evil, was about to execute  an act of injustice and stern cruelty’.114 The reversal of meaning here –  in which justice becomes injustice – reflects the Enlightenment concern  with accurate representation found in Longsword. But it also recalls the  frequent post-French Revolution struggles over signification.115 Here it  is ‘passion’ that causes such reversal and opens the king to the plots of  ‘designing men’.116 Despite Henry’s fondness for decorating his walls  with ‘the noble achievements of his ancestors and others’ (Richard  the Lionheart, ‘Merlin, King of Britain’, ‘the sailing of William from  Normandy’ – but also the siege of Troy), he lacks what Adam Smith  calls ‘the great, the awful and respectable, the virtues of self-denial’ –  and this prevents his effective rule.117 The self-indulgence of king and court has, Radcliffe indicates, perni- cious social and economic effects. Even as Radcliffe depicts the court  hunting and feasting in the forest, she undercuts the vision of pastoral  social order. Encountering ‘three hundred foresters, who feigned to  be outlaws of the forest, presenting Robin Hood’ and company, the  ‘noble company’ itself ‘feared not’ and were ‘nothing daunted’.118  The very denials suggest the repressed fears of the nobility: sordid  and threatening reality is turned into romance. Still, though, the court  disregards the state of the country. The hunting expedition recalls the  post-French Revolution unease over the French and British game laws.  In Edwy William I’s creation of the New Forest as a hunting ground  is seen as an act of tyranny which destroys the communities that were  settled there and the motif is repeated in Charlotte Smith’s Desmond  and Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790).119  Representing sport and pleasure for one class of society at the expense of  another, reflecting the depopulation of the countryside during the agri- cultural revolution, the woodland causes crime. Radcliffe also alludes  to the post-French Revolution fascination with woodland as alternate  </page> <page sequence="29"> Ancient Liberties    51 social space – not only in Caleb Williams but also in the anonymous  Arville Castle and Montford Castle, the forest allows outlaws to enter  into their own social contract. Radcliffe is undoubtedly aware of this  tradition but for her the alternative social order represented by Robin  Hood and his men is no more than a space of fiction. Instead of nurtur- ing an ideal community, the ‘dark thickets’ are the ‘home of outlaws’,  damaging the health of England.120 And while in Arville Castle the  reader finally discovers that it is the dispossessed aristocracy who are  running a failed and corrupt alternative space, Radcliffe is more direct.  Gaston de Blondeville, the corrupt favourite, and the Prior are responsi- ble for the murderous woodland robbery which generates the plot. Under corrupt rule it is not only the displaced peasant that suffers.  With a Norman first name and a surname that combines Anglo-Saxon  etymology with a reference to The Old English Baron, Hugh Woodreeve  is a merchant. The Old English Baron’s fixation with the effect of trade  on social mobility and personal identity is reinvented by Radcliffe – the  trader is witness and victim of crime. Even on the first day the crowd  misinterprets Woodreeve’s quest for justice, believing he ‘has assailed  the life of our good King’. Their ‘roaring’ with ‘women brawling’ the  loudest (recalling the fishwives’ march on Versailles) temporarily drowns  out vital information: the king is alive; there is no crime.121 Commerce is  believed to threaten monarchy but, Radcliffe suggests, the reverse is true.  When Woodreeve manages to speak directly to the king, the king ini- tially asserts that ‘justice should be done upon the guilty’ but his attitude  changes when he discovers that the accused is his favourite Gaston.122 If  Woodreeve goes ‘farther’, the king threatens, he ‘must be taught what it is  to dishonour a gentleman and a knight’.123 This naïve equation of moral  worth and title leads to Woodreeve’s unsympathetic cross-examination  by the king, in which an often comic feature of Radcliffe’s earlier fiction,  the interrupted digression, becomes reinterpreted. Stories told by obscure  narrators are easily written over by those in power. While the king dismisses the possibility of an extrajudicial solution (a  ‘sentence by other modes’) and rules out ‘trial by ordeal’, both options  suggest Woodreeve’s vulnerability.124 Equally, Radcliffe stresses that the  powerful can manipulate evidence. The Prior insists that it is: extraordinary, that, if the calamitous adventure, related by the merchant, had  occurred so near Kenilworth, and so few years back, it should not be gener- ally known . . . the name of Reginald de Folville [Wooodreeve’s murdered  relation] not being found in the cemetery-book of the Priory.125 Yet this gap in the historical records has been constructed by the Prior  himself (who has erased the inscription on Reginald de Folville’s tomb).  </page> <page sequence="30">  52    Reinventing Liberty Even trial by jury is flawed by threats of jury-tampering or the possibility  of a retrial. Accused by the people, interrogated by the king, judged by  the monks of St Mary’s Priory, experiencing two formal trials and con- demned out of hand by the king after the death of Gaston de Blondeville,  Woodreeve is one of the most persistently questioned petitioners for  justice in literature. Woodreeve’s case is also punctuated by an unusual number of super- natural appearances. In The Old English Baron Reeve had rejected  the divine right of kings, instead suggesting that the state is supported  by a more general providential order. Her use of the supernatural  emphasises the point. Radcliffe undermines this position. The appear- ances of the murdered Reginald de Folville suggest that the demand  for justice will recur, even after the threat has apparently been laid to  rest.126 However, such reappearances are subject to misinterpretation  and even distortion. Hence when the drops of blood on Gaston’s robe  spread (in line with the medieval belief that the blood of the victim  flows to accuse the murderer), the prisoner is accused of ‘sorcery’ – and  is condemned to death for a magical plot against the Prior’s life.127  Evidence, even of a supernatural variety, is co-opted by power. Further,  while in The Old English Baron Sir Philip is able to participate in trial  by combat, becoming the ‘minister of justice’, in Radcliffe’s narrative  the ghost of Reginald de Folville has to defend his own cause. Even the  spectre’s victory makes no difference to Henry, who continues with  Woodreeve’s execution. Only when the apparition directly threatens  the king, saying ‘if he [Woodreeve] perish for my sake he shall not fall  alone. Be warned’, will the king listen.128 Despite Woodreeve’s ultimate  vindication, Gaston portrays a sense of justice in crisis that is greater  than its predecessors. This is a corrupt social order that not only lacks  supernatural underpinning but also refuses any idea of providential  intervention. After suggesting the extent of judicial corruption, Gaston exaggerates  the repetitive aspects of the fictions of ancient liberties, adding a sinister  sense of paranoia. What initially seems inert or dull becomes, by the end  of the narrative, curiously troubling. The book’s static quality comes  not only from the description of the images which head each chapter  but from the pedantry of its clerical narrator and the court ceremony  it contains. However, all this is ominously undercut by the apparent  impossibility of historical and cultural representation. The king and  queen try to control their artistic environment but fail. On the third  day the ornate ceremonies of marriage and feast are interrupted by a  mysterious, untraceable ‘figure’.129 Interruption and misinterpretation  are followed by unauthorised spectral representation on a grand scale.  </page> <page sequence="31"> Ancient Liberties    53 At the banquet, the Crusades are re-enacted to stirring martial music,  unexpectedly followed by images of de Folville’s murder. The food  is doctored: the ‘suttletie’ showing ‘archers in the forest’ designed to  complement Gaston’s new wife, Lady Barbara, includes an odd detail:  ‘At a distance, within the shadow of the trees, stood an aged man alone,  wringing his hands’ but ‘what this might mean none knew.’130 Music  without minstrels; a cast of thousands with no actors; and wedding  fare with moving perspectival pictures all indicate that representation is  uncannily out of control. The number of commentators only increases this sense. In this novel  the feeling of mass observation – of the very turrets and walls becoming  animated – reflects the growing post-French Revolution awareness of  the people as a political force. Rumour and counter-rumour flourish,  making accuracy impossible. The actions of the king and queen, innocu- ous or doubtful, are all subject to criticism (‘many there thought the  King too hasty in this’).131 Gaston de Blondeville suggests that consti- tutional struggle seems both inevitable and perpetual. Power attempts  to project continuity by presenting static images of past traditions,  but, amongst the mass of observers, each individual tries to shape his  own interpretation of events. As a result, the political threat is barely  contained. Although Gaston can be read in relation to Caleb Williams,  it also seems (despite its supposed date of composition) like a darker  rewriting of Ivanhoe. Trade and the political classes are in fundamental  conflict; luxury is pitted against criminalised poverty and the crowd has  a threatening capacity for action. The sense of a disrupted and paranoid  society lingers. The revival of Old Whig rhetoric in the 1760s meant that Leland,  Walpole and Reeve felt the constitutional past as a historical force acting  upon the present: the gothic has both historical and political meaning.  Even in the 1780s and 90s ancient constitutionalism continued to be  a focus for political debate: while Burke posited a smooth continuity  from past to present (or at least suggested that such a fiction should be  maintained), more radical writers drew upon the notion of the Norman  Yoke to position their demands for reform as a return to political  origins. Consequently, as Edwy, Son of Ethelred and Radcliffe’s Gaston  de Blondeville show, ancient constitutionalism came under pressure.  Such novels focus on continuity or, at the very least, a return to political  origins, rather than rupture, but they find such continuity an increas- ingly implausible motif in relation to the political present. One of the key problems for the novelists considered here is social  mobility – a mobility that ancient constitutionalism promises, but does  not manage, to limit. Thus it is that, despite his desire to protect ancient  </page> <page sequence="32">  54    Reinventing Liberty political virtue by distinguishing it sharply from ambitious vice, Leland  finds virtue hard to guarantee. Political parasitism undermines the  system from the top and the lower ranks follow the corrupt aristocracy  in choosing money over honour. Leland suggests that the probity of the  monarch is crucial; however, when a paean of praise to George III slides  into a warning, the chances of this seem slim. Walpole’s novel suggests  that the correct line of succession can be hard to maintain. Combining  allusions to Old Whig and Jacobite thought, he not only mockingly  hints that divine intervention (of the kind favoured by the Jacobites)  would be necessary to underpin the rule of law, but he also indicates  the perils of manipulating a distended and dismembered past for current  political gain. If the novel suggests that the threat of absolutism may  be read as either ludicrous or terrifying, Otranto’s actual spectre – the  lack of underpinning for the post-1688 mixed constitution – is far more  genuinely dismaying. For Reeve, who contemplated the added pressures of consumerism  and the movement of capital upon the social structure, Walpole’s cri- tique of the British political system was unacceptable. Yet her attempt  to control the spread of consumerism by appealing to a divinely under- pinned gothic past makes her an anathema to Scott and condemns her to  the generic troubles of her predecessors: Reeve’s concern regarding the  threat of social usurpation means that the moment of rupture is perpetu- ally revisited. Reservations about the usefulness of ancient constitution- alism as a way of describing political modernity only grow in the late  1780s and 1790s. Son of Ethelwolf highlights problems with taxation  and representation; Edwy and Gaston point to restrictions on trade and  to the displaced rural population. In the face of these difficulties, a rever- sion to a standard of ancient liberty becomes increasingly implausible.  Prince George appears an unlikely King Alfred; the author of Edwy  finds the moment of ancient constitutionalism hard to locate; and in  Radcliffe’s Gaston de Blondeville the repetition that characterised The  Old English Baron becomes a more baroque commentary on the use of  history, ceremony and custom to underpin a political and social order.  Tradition alone is not enough to legitimise rule, particularly given the  (perceived) increase in mobility generated by the consumer economy. As  Thomas Macaulay suggested in relation to the 1832 Reform Act: ‘The  great cause of revolutions is this, that while nations move onwards,  constitutions stand still.’132 Moving away from the static paradigm  of ancient constitutionalism, increasingly historical novelists turned  to stadial history to explore economic and political transition – and  rupture. </page> <page sequence="33"> Ancient Liberties    55 Notes  1.
