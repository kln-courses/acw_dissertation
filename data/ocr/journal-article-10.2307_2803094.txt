<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LOOK OF MAGIC GILBERT LEWIS University of Cambridge Frazer's view of magic grew from reading. The first question I shall raise here is about what effects the media of representation (print, pictures, etc.) have on our understanding of magic. Have we been deceived about its look? Descriptions must inevitably be selective. To explain supposed magical behaviour, we often impute motives or intentions to people. Why impute a motive and not ask about it? An idea or action might seem magical if we thought it was meant literally but not if we took someone to mean it figuratively. Some points of conflict between the literalist and symbolist views of magic seem to turn on the intentions of the actors. But answers on literal or symbolic meaning are likely to be mixed. People change their opinions as they grow older. Belief and scepticism change with experience and with taking different roles in perform- ances. A Gnau treatment of illness shows this flux in understanding, almost a developmental pattern in belief. In Thegolden bough by SirJames Frazer you soon come to recognise the approach of those passages of illustration and example which begin: 'Among the abor- igines of Australia . . .' or 'When a Dayak . . .' and so on. Over these you may choose to skim. But what if you stop-stop atjust one example and think about it. This is Frazer: 'Again a Blackfoot Indian who has set a trap for eagles, and is watching it, would not eat rosebuds on any account. For he argues that if he did so, and an eagle alighted near the trap, the rosebuds in his own stomach would make the bird itch, with the result that instead of swallowing the bait, the eagle would merely sit and scratch himself' (Frazer I957: 28). Eat rosebuds? Who is this Indian who would eat rosebuds while he hunts? Imagine the scene. The eagle soaring above. The Blackfoot Indian below. And the rosebuds? There is a multitude of examples to choose from, just as surrealist. But are they possible? Or are they like images from dreams? I see the Indian and the Rosebuds best as an unpainted masterpiece by the Douanier Rousseau. There are problems of image and observation, of make-believe and real life. How much in our understanding of other people is contributed by our imagination? Frazer's knowledge of pre-literate society was a literary one. He imagined the look and feel of life in those societies. Words are good for ideas and impressions, but they have limitations when it comes to recording sights, sounds, touch and smell. They do not substitute for direct experience. Verbal art and visual art differ in their strong points. The painter can elaborate details without sacrificing the general effect. The picture may still retain its unity and simplicity in spite of the mass of details. You see it as a whole. But when a passion for details is Man (N.S.) 21, 414-37</page><page sequence="2">GILBERT LEWIS 4I5 displayed in literature the effect is quite different. After a long academic tradition of learning from the printed page, the ways in which we can represent the lives of others are changing, and these also change our understanding and attitudes to them. We have not only more information, but it is of a different kind, more direct. 1 I have broadly three themes that I wish to consider here in relation to the analysis of magic. The first is this one of representation and how it may bestow a look of magic to exotic things. Our understanding of other societies reflects the media by which we learned of them. No medium represents reality as we perceive it with all our senses. The description must be partial. In mental pictures of exotic things made from patchy evidence, we fill in gaps. The end result is hybrid, hybrid of the exotic and the familiar, the familiar we used to fill in the gaps. Hybrids are odder than the natural species from which they came. Or if we leave the gaps, it will still look strange. How such a patchy thing could survive and live remains mysterious. Our ability to record and represent life in other societies improves, and we see less that looks exotically fantastic, less that looks like magic. The filling in of gaps will be part of my second theme: imputation. For often in our interpretations, we observe what people do but find that, to explain it, we want to suggest the thinking that must lie behind it. We impute their thinking to them. Of course it is possible we make mistakes about it and attribute motives or assumptions to them which they do not have. By misreading the context and their intentions, we may mistakenly attribute a magical logic to them. Anthro- pologists have the advantage over historians in being able to ask people to explain their actions and discuss them with them. Why neglect it? It is surprising how some anthropological analysis of thinking by people in other societies imputes modes of thinking, aims or explanations to them, sometimes confi- dently, sometimes without even seeming to ask them what they think. The imputations may be wrong. The question of whose explanation should have priority will appear most sharply in connexion with a third theme: the question of literal or symbolic meaning. Anthropologists have disagreed about whether some magical acts or religious statements are meant literally or symbolically. How can an idea have a symbolic meaning which those who maintain it do not recognise or see in it? We might happily accept that a certain belief was magical if we thought the people meant it literally, but we should not call it magical if we thought they meant it metaphorically or figuratively. The distinction between some symbolist and literalist interpretations might turn critically on the intentions and interpret- ations of the actors. I think we shall find that these are often mixed. The answers about literal or symbolic meaning will not be single, and exclusively either the one or the other. People change their opinions as they grow older; experience and maturity may bring developments or scepticism in matters of belief. Verbal and visual representation The golden bough begins with the word-picture of the grim priest in the sacred grove by the lake. Frazer imagines him-priest and murderer-glimpsed by a</page><page sequence="3">4I6 GILBERT LEWIS belated traveller on a wild autumn night-a sombre picture set to melancholy music-with the lapping of the cold water on the shore. It is a famous purple passage. Overblown, but I should think it lured many people to read on. Frazer held them by that device: it was his glittering eye.2 Though the style may be cloying now, Frazer won over some great writers, among them T. S. Eliot; stylistic judgements by anthropologists can scarcely wound his shade. Frazer's confident tone, however, when he writes about the savage and his thoughts is more disturbing to our taste. Frazer is too sure in his judgements: the customs are clear to him, the natives all do this or that, their intentions are transparent. We doubt whether things are, or were, so clear. To'visualise people we have not seen, we must ourselves provide that part of their appearance which has not been explicitly described. Marco Polo (I958: 230) reported that the Andaman Islanders had dog-heads. In the illustra- tions of a book of marvels from the fifteenth century (reproduced in Wittkower I977: 84), we see the Andaman Islanders as gentle dog-headed peasants convers- ing in their socks, a tranquil scene at some odds with the account given later by A. Radcliffe-Brown (I922). Several other people, figments too, hybrids of the familiar and the imagination, lived on in late Medieval and Renaissance ideas.3 In the eighteenth century (and Captain Cook's voyages are the great examples) curiosity about newly discovered lands and people began to create a demand for accurate reports and the life-like representation of people as well as of things. Herder in the I780's voiced it irresistibly in The outlines of a philosophy of the history of man: 0 for a magic wand, which, at once transforming into faithful pictures all the vague verbal descriptions that have hitherto been given, might present us with a gallery of figures of his fellow creatures. But we are far from the accomplishment of such an anthropological wish. For centuries, the Earth has been traversed with sword and the cross, by toymen and brandy merchants: no one thought of the peaceful pencil, and it has scarcely entered the minds of the numerous herd of travellers, that words do not paint forms, particularly that which is of all the most delicate, the most various, and ever-changing. For a long time men sought after the wonderful and dealt in fiction; then they occasionally idealised, even when they gave figures; without considering that no faithful zoologist idealises, when he delineates foreign animals. And is human nature alone unworthy of that accurate attention, with which plants and animals are drawn?' (Herder I803, i: 289-9i cited in Smith I960: ioi). The wish cannot, alas, be immediately and simply translated into deed. Representation is an art with its own problems to be solved. Pictorial conven- tions determine the ways to create illusions of reality (Gombrich I960); the conventions may need to be modified for new and unfamiliar subjects. The hand and eye of the artist have their own forms of ethnocentric bias, as Bernard Smith showed in a beautiful study of The European vision and the South Pacific, 1 768-1 850 (I960). The unfamiliar mistakenfor magic There is a lesson for us in this when we consider theories about how other people think. The less we know of people, the easier it is for us to believe them strange. The imagination has free rein. Frazer accepts the bizarre report of the Indian, the</page><page sequence="4">GILBERT LEWIS 4I7 rosebuds, and the eagle, and then fills in a background for it of possible reasons, worked out in his own thinking. No one could contradict the earliest traveller returned from distant parts. The position is like that noted in an ancient Chinese treatise on painting: 'Everyone is acquainted with dogs and horses since they are seen daily. To reproduce their likeness is very difficult. On the other hand, since demons and spiritual beings have no definite form and since no one has ever seen them, they are easy to execute' (quoted in Gombrich I960: 228 from words attributed to Han Fei d. 233 B.C.). Indeed I think that what we judge most severely is the truth of pictures of ourselves: with others we are not so critical. Film and sound recording now make it possible for us at home to see events almost as an anthropologist might see them far away.4 We can represent, or present, the appearances of people and what they do more accurately and in greater detail than before. The evidence and its immediacy serves to dissolve some of the strangeness of exotic places. It familiarises us with the people. The recordings make possible a quite different form of armchair anthropology from that available to Frazer-the pictures and the sounds are moving and direct. Does such familiarity dissolve the look of magic?5 An action might have seemed strange before just because the look was fleeting. Berenson (I952: I9I) said one should not look too long or too often at the mysterious paintings of Dosso Dossi, or their spell would fade. Repetition takes mystery away. If we are liable to mistake novelty and strangeness for magic, then what is the observer's share in giving things the look of magic? To the spectator something may look magical when he has no idea how it can be done.6 Consider it from another's point of view. To someone in New Guinea ignorant of them, airplanes, radios and polaroid cameras seemed to work by magic. I had a tape recorder from which voices could speak in the villagers' own language. It did not matter to them that they were listening to what they hadjust said. At first hearing it was amazing. I learned their language slowly. Later I found out what a few of them first hoped for from the machine. Here is an example: a mother came, rather diffidently, with friends to tell me about her daughter's death, to record the story as her son had the day before. But on the tape recording she is asking her dead daughter to speak to her, to tell her whether it was really sorcery she died from, or because the branch fell on her neck. Was it the branch or sorcery? Let it say. Tell me, tell me now, you speak, she says. Dameku-she is the mother-does not know what is possible or impossible for the tape recorder. The recording catches her hesitant questioning-she switches from talking to me (telling the story), to addressing the machine, then to asking her daughter to speak. She wishes it could answer but she is uncertain. Her voice is quite matter-of-fact. She is not awestruck by it. The problem for her is the event and the object, to know which are magical events, or magical objects, and which are ordinary. For us, the interest is not the event or object so much as her thinking. What was it about the machine that led her to wonder whether her daughter could speak to her through it? What was it that made her change her mind and put it back among ordinary things? She had had hardly any contact with radios before she heard it. The machine produced Gnau speech. She was familiar with a divination in which the spirits of the dead would answer by beating out their answers on the garamut (slit-gong). Perhaps they could also</page><page sequence="5">4I8 GILBERT LEWIS speak out of the machine. A wish, a doubt-she hoped it might be possible. It was not, I think, something she strongly believed. She abandoned her question- ing soon when I said the machine could not answer. It is certainly easy to make mistakes about the nature of some action or about how something works. The Gnau with whom I did fieldwork were themselves rather suspicious of anything they did not understand that strangers did in case it might be sorcery (Lewis I980: 55)). They were suspicious chiefly of other New Guinean strangers; curiously, white people were, or seemed to be, almost exempt from suspicion of sorcery, despite their mystifying machines and some of their demands. The village people's distrust of white demands was a fear rather of direct compulsion. Yet I wonder how the unfortunate Fore people of the East Highlands of New Guinea, who suffered such high rates of death from kuru (a fatal disease of the central nervous system), interpreted the requests of the white medical research team who wanted the bodies of all their kuru dead. The bodies were returned after post mortems had been done and the brains removed for further study. The research led to the discovery of the cause of the disease, and its mode of transmission through mortuary cannibalism. Mean- while the Fore steadfastly continued to think that sorcery caused kuru. But what did they make of those white demands for their corpses. White cannibals? What white research was this? But I do not know what they really thought.7 For Dameku, the mother (on the recording), and for the Fore faced with the white medical research team, the problem was recognising the kind of action or event, to tell what was magical from what was not. Was Duwatei the daughter's death caused by the falling branch, or was sorcery behind it? Were the white medical team doing sorcery or research? Were the voices from the tape recorder magical or not? What could the tape recorder do, and what was possible for it, what was not? When we turn the tables round again, back to the anthropologist, the problem for him or her is not of distinguishing magical actions or effects from the ordinary workings of the laws of nature, but of being able to distinguish magical thinking or magical beliefs from other kinds of thought. The facts on the surface, the appearances do not necessarily speak for themselves about the actors' thoughts. We need to know their intentions and beliefs. 'We had the experience but we missed the meaning and approach to the meaning restores the experience in a different form' (Eliot I959: 39). How would these lines of T. S. Eliot apply to the Fore? If the Fore had known nothing of the purpose of post mortems, they might have misconstrued the motives of the research team -desire for human flesh? But approach to that medical meaning (explanation of the purpose by the team) could recast the experience, misconstrued before, and restore it in a different form-as part of an attempt to find the cause of the disease and how to stop it. Whether the anthropologist will identify some people's actions and beliefs as magical may depend critically on how they are presented (or misrepresented) to him. Are they isolated or put in context?</page><page sequence="6">GILBERT LEWIS 4I9 Actions and intentions What someone has actually done may be quite clear, although his motives and intentions remain obscure. If that is so, then should we base our opinion of what was done on the action alone, or must we also take account of the intention behind it? Shouldjudgement be of the crime (the action done), or of the criminal (what he meant to do)? To an anthropologist this presents itself often in the form of uncertainty about the frame of reference in which to place an action and its possible significance. For example, the fourteenth chapter of Leviticus gives directions for the cleansing of the leper. The motives for this are religious, obedience to the Priestly rules of purification; there is no medical or healing intention behind them. To interpret the instructions in a medical or hygienic perspective is a mistake about the context within which they should be understood. The facts, though clear, require interpretation in the right frame of reference. The performers say 'This is not a treatment for illness but a sacrifice to God for sin' (of which leprosy was the sign). If you choose to consider the action nonetheless as a kind of medical treatment, you have to explain why they persist with this inappropriate response. You may say they are ignorant or irrational, but some of that irrationality depends on your decision about how to categorise their action and the motives you have attributed to them. Their ideas would justify it otherwise. An observer can make a mistaken interpretation through ignorance of the purpose or the context to which the action belongs. And almost any action can be made to look ridiculous by putting it in the wrong context. As with love at first sight, there is a risk in trusting first impressions, though the first glance can strongly influence the frame we put round a subject. A perceptual set, meaning by that the expectations, theories and assumptions we bring to our observations, will alert us to some elements in a situation, blinker us to others, and must affect, if not distort, how we perceive it. Observations essential to one theory may be irrelevant to another. It is a matter of attention and neglect. We do not look at a Florentine painting of the Annunciation to the Virgin with the eyes of the painter or his contemporaries. We cannot tell from her gesture which of the Five Laudable Conditions of the Blessed Virgin the painting seeks to portray. The contemporaries of the painter could have told that: our taste, our religious knowledge, our connoisseurship are different (Baxandall I974: 45-56). The same painting-but we see it differently. As with the painting, so with actions seen by different spectators. The point was made with brilliance and beauty by Kurosawa in the film Rashomon. We might remember it when we look with outsider's eyes at the activities of other people. The visual salience or insignificance of something done has to be measured against our knowledge and expectations. Imputations Frazer in the manner of his day was confident of his ability to understand the Aboriginal's mind and to explain the Dayak's way of thought. His methods</page><page sequence="7">420 GILBERT LEWIS were like those of the historian working from written sources who has some of the facts, but to make sense of them must impute certain aims or assumptions to the actors. He works from the evidence he has. He cannot ask the actors to explain themselves, what they did or wished to do, and why. Faute de mieux, he does it for them. He reconstructs how they appraised their situation, assuming them to be rational beings like himself. Perhaps there were gaps in their information, or constraints on them, a particular false belief. Thus from a particular situational perspective, possibly perverse or misinformed, the actions could be seen as explicable and rational. The analytic position taken by Frazer, as by the historian, is to assume on principle that people act rationally within their own lights-that is, they act rationally even though at times imperfectly so (Watkins I970). Their motives and impulses are intelligible even though they may make errors. The alternative is to assume that others are different, or radically different-and this would be in some measure to deny them the same degree of humanity as ourselves.8 When Frazer discerned a logic underlying the primitive thinker's actions, he assumed him to be rational. But the way he did so is perhaps paradoxical. Frazer's method of explanation is to account for specific actions or beliefs in terms of some suggested characteristic type or pattern of behaviour or thought. In the case of magic, he identifies the principles of thought on which it depends. He infers a set of principles for the association of ideas which must underlie its practice. Of course sometimes he quotes statements by the actors to support his analysis. But these are not essential to his method. Indeed he says it is for the observer to analyse the principles behind the actions. It is to be borne in mind that the primitive magician knows magic only in its practical side; he never analyses the mental processes on which his practice is based, never reflects on the abstract principles involved in his actions. With him, as with the vast majority of men, the logic is implicit, not explicit: he reasons just as he digests his food in complete ignorance of the intellectual and physiological processes which are essential to the one operation and to the other. In short, to him, magic is always an art, and never a science; the very idea of science is lacking in his undeveloped mind. It is for the philosophic student to trace the train of thought which underlies the magician's practice (Frazer I957: IS). The reasoning of the magician is both assumed and denied by Frazer. But to be fair, we must admit that we all often explain behaviour by identifying it as behaviour of a particular kind. The type or pattern is characterised, more or less narrowly, by the analyst or observer, or by some general theory about, say, kinds of mental state. Examples of this explanatory form used in anthropology might include Weber's types of rational action, Levy-Bruhl's pre-logical mentality, the idea of the rational economic man, the peasant view of the limited good, and those many different ethics and ideologies that have so often been formulated not by the actors themselves, but by the anthropologist himself, who then attributes one to them.9 In theory, we may be able to see, now that it is pointed out, that the particular action or behaviour in front of us fits the pattern, or belongs to some general type. This proves explanatory because it tells us what is going on, and perhaps enables us to predict what the people involved will do next, or what</page><page sequence="8">GILBERT LEWIS 42I decisions they are likely to take (Taylor I970:' 32-73). But what I find curious here with Frazer, as well as in the attribution of symbolic meanings to actors who have not stated or recognised them, is the degree to which a type of thinking, or some reason or meaning or aim is attributed to the actor, imputed to him though the actor has not expressed it directly, nor even, it often seems, been asked for his opinion. He is not asked to formulate an ideology for himself. It is almost as if the subjects could not speak or they were dead. Thejustification for the historian, or for Frazer, doing the best he can with the evidence he has, is not easy to accept from an anthropologist now. 10 We can try to assess the skill of questions and what trust to put in answers or in observations. To identify magic To identify magic we must pay attention to the ideas behind action. 'It is,' said Frazer, 'for the philosophic student to trace the train of thought which underlies the magician's practice.' Happily this has been done by Skorupski (I976) in his fine dissection of anthropological theories of magic. He analyses the chief patterns of action and thought that recur in magical practice and shows that the practices described as magic by different writers are heterogeneous. We cannot fit them all into a single theory about their logic. In the end the only common characteristic of the many things we have called magic is our own disbelief. Their practices require assumptions that go against the ones we use to interpret the world (Skorupski I976: I59). Frazer himself roundly declared what he considered the obvious thing about magic: 'It is therefore a truism, almost a tautology, to say that all magic is necessarily false and barren; for if it were ever to become true and fruitful, it would no longer be magic but science' (Frazer I957: 65). If we follow Frazer, we appoint ourselves to be judges of what is magic and what is not. Yet is error on its own enough? Clearly not. There are many examples of, say, medical practices that were orthodox enough in their time, and were carried out in the mistaken belief they were effective, or were based on theories now thought false; but they do not turn into magic retrospectively simply because we can see errors now. We also need to find certain characteristic beliefs: for Frazer these would have been his laws of similarity and contagion; for others they have also included belief in the power of symbols over the things they symbolise, the magical uses of words and names, belief in the efficacy of symbolic enactments, the confusion of conventional relations with natural reactions so that things in the natural world are believed to be able to respond to their 'real' names; words and spells can command them as if they were agents who could hear and understand. An act may look like magic from outside, but you cannot tell the thought behind an action purely by the look alone. There may be some sort of official version of belief, a public version, established by some generally accepted authority. Or else a certain logic of ideas may seem to be implicit in the rules. But obedience to rules does not tell us anything for sure about personal attitudes or convictions or beliefs-only that someone knows the rules. Prayers, for</page><page sequence="9">422 GILBERT LEWIS instance, may imply an idea of the existence of spirits capable of being influenced by words; but of course someone may say a grace, or repeat a prayer, without belief. Would actions, then, done routinely, with little thought, count as magic? If someone tried a treatment not because he believed the theory of it but because he had heard it worked, would he then be using magic? Keith Thomas (I973: 226) quotes an English seventeenth century example: 'When his wife fell sick, he sent to one Mother Chambers because she was known to have done good to many other sick persons, and not because he wanted to consult a sorceress as such'. Would action done in that pragmatic spirit be evidence of belief in magic, or just empiricism? People often learn a technique without bothering at all about the principles or any other theory behind it. We waver when asked to answer these questions. Why? In short, because we cannot decide which criteria to use. Is it a question of the act or the actor? The facts about an action or the reasons for it? Whose explanation is at issue-the actor's or the observer's? Is it a statement of literal belief? Is it meant symboli- cally or as a metaphor? Is the action effective or ineffective? Is the assertion true or false? We cannot hope to answer unambiguously when we shift about among these different criteria. If we take the action itself, then we need to know what its aim was and what were its effects. Who specified the aim? Was the aim achieved, and was the cause of the effect the one supposed? We try to assess whether what they say about an effect is true or false according to our ideas about the laws of nature, not theirs.11 Intended metaphor, intended symbol Frazer implied that the observer could detect the principles of sympathetic magic in the act itself. But in matters of belief we cannot speak for the actor. The problem is to discover what the actor thinks. Sincerity is a graded quality, not an absolute. We may attribute an idea or meaning to someone else and find that he rejects it. The distinction between someone's own ideas and those which others have attributed to him must be kept clear. The Gnau people sometimes used metaphors in speech; sometimes they used objects as symbols, intending them to be recognised as such. There could be no doubt about their conscious use and recognition of these modes of speech and action in some contexts; but in others, I found it hard to tell whether something was meant literally or not (Lewis '975: 2I6). We meet the same sort of doubt about how to take other people's meanings at home. The fact that we may sometimes find ourselves in doubt does not lead us to conclude that there is no difference between metaphoric and literal meaning, and no point in distin- guishing between them. Anthropologists have disagreed over whether to interpret some forms of magic and ritual in terms of literal belief or symbolic meaning. Certain issues12 here will turn on what the actors think or intend to mean, but there are not always clear-cut answers to questions about literal belief or intended symbolic meaning. People acquire knowledge over time and by experience. Many</page><page sequence="10">GILBERT LEWIS 423 societies impose controls so that there is a pattern of access to knowledge and development of it: the controls often distinguish men from women, young from old. The experience and beliefs of those who have prepared and staged perform- ances or ritual will differ from those of others who have not. We have only to recall our childhood fantasies-perhaps a belief in Father Christmas or monsters in the dark-our adolescent enthusiasms or, indeed, any of our complex convictions, to see that the disposition to believe is rarely constant; it develops and changes in the individual with experience, and belief varies among individuals. Belief is not all-or-none. We do not hold all our ideas with the same degree of conviction. That is an obvious but important point to keep in mind when we consider the arguments about literal belief or symbolic meaning. I shall explore some of these issues further with an example. The example comes from a treatment that I witnessed a few times in the field. The thinking behind the treatment may look obvious, but in real life and in detail it does not seem so. The sight and sound of the people in action is very different from a selective, even though long, verbal description of the events. With words, even with photographs and film as well, we still miss some modalities of the live experience. The rapidity of action at some critical points makes it impossible for everyone present to see what happens, denies them time to see and ponder all facets of the action and their possible meanings. Different people are stimulated by various insights and feelings. The treatmentfor Panu'et It is simplest to begin with an outline of what should happen when it is done; the scheme or plan for the rite is given in the appendix to this article. I vacillate between calling it ritual or treatment. The aim is to treat someone diagnosed as suffering an illness caused by the spirit Panu'et. A woman is ill. She was struck when she took some sago flour in a bamboo tube from a pool where she had been storing it. The situation that prompts the performance, the patient, her illness and diagnosis, make the general aim of the action clear. The situation sets a frame round the actions, and gives us the perspective within which to view them. Even though it is obvious from the setting, the aim of the rite is also made explicit by public declarations repeated a number of times during the perform- ance. The first statements are addressed to lineage ancestors of the men conducting the performance and to ancestors of the sick woman's husband. They call out loudly the purpose of what they are doing and their wish that she may get better. Their words and actions imply the assumption that there are ancestral spirits invisible, present, and able to understand what is called out upwards to them; who may respond to appeals and be persuaded. Why do they call out what they are doing instead of just taking it for granted as understood? The declarations draw attention to the spirits addressed and alert us to the peculiar nature of the action. We would not expect them to call out what they were doing as they cut firewood or washed their hands. The assertive clarity of the statement may also set up a creative possibility of matching what they say they are doing against what they really do, a possibility for discrepancy between</page><page sequence="11">424 GILBERT LEWIS verbal and visual cues, for dissonance as well as harmony, for mystery as well as simple clarity. The aim is clear. Does it make the action easily intelligible? Public attention centres on the climax of the treatment: a confrontation between the sick woman and the spirit afflicting her-or rather, an image of the spirit afflicting her. This confrontation is quite short; it lasts about twelve minutes. The climax is public but some of the earlier stages are more secret and hidden. The preparations will have taken up at least half the day before they reach the climax. Inevitably that gives them some mystery and value, and creates distinctions between those who know, those who can know, and those who cannot. The representation The set actions and words imply certain ideas about spirits and the nature of illness. The performance is public and they say what they are doing and what they hope will happen. They talk about it as they prepare for it and perform it. They use a semi-specialised vocabulary to identify the actions: ordinary verbs may have in this context unusual but specific references. I shall first take the sequence of actions as a representation, a symbolic enactment. The men go to the place where the woman was struck to find the spirit and bring it back with them. The spirit is invisible but present at the place. They collect materials there for an image of it and make it an offering from the meal they eat, asking it to come back with them. Women must not be present at the bush garden when they actually put the image together. The spirit accompanies them back to the village as they return with the image, but it is not yet localised in the image. First they must paint its face, prepare its headdress and decorate it with shells, feathers and ornaments, then by spells and spitting, they make the spirit go into the image. They blow and whisper the spells carefully into its ears, at the root of its headdress and its base. The spirit is now in the image and the woman is called to confront it and declare herself so that the spirit will hear her and will recognise her. She asks it to stop afflicting her. She explains that she had been at a place where she was entitled to work, at her husband's sago place and appeals to the spirit to leave her. She is chewing the betel quid with special herbs belonging to the spirit as she confronts it so it shall know her. As the men chant the relevant verses of the spirit-song of Panu'et, they touch and brush the stinging base of the image against her skin, where her pain is, but also on all her body and at the end they bring the image up over her head and finally down to knock it in the ground between her legs. She confronts the spirit and it touches her all over: a full recognition and contact. The jolt when they bash the image into the ground dislodges the spirit which is in the image. The spirit is set loose again, invisible. They say they 'strike' or 'kill' the spirit-the verb la'ab is the same. That is what it looks like when they bash the image into the ground and lay it down, bring a knife (or a wallaby bone or cassowary bone dagger) and cut the image open at its lungs, take out its heart and vegetable insides and lay them on a lyimungai banana leaf.</page><page sequence="12">GILBERT LEWIS 425 The men give her the special soup-stew belonging to Panu'et after they have put spells into it. They call out to the spirit to leave her and they justify her actions to it as they ask it to go, but not to go too far off because the spirit brings them benefits. They tell it to go to the land of their own relatives. When they tear the lyimungai banana leaf held over her head, the bits of the insides of the image cascade down over her and fall to the ground. The actions looked like a killing of the image, and the bits they took fell down away from her. The men take some of the bits to catch up anything of the spirit left in her. They gather it up from her limbs and body and throw it away in the direction they want it to go, calling out loudly for it to leave her. They may hit her sharply with nettles to startle it out of her. They tell her to stamp her feet or shake her head. They may tug her arm or fingers trying to make thejoints crack as a sign that the illness has left her. She is washed to remove all dirt and influence: with hot water, very hot if she can stand it, to drive out the last traces, then cool, to make her clean. A magical treatment Various things about this treatment lead one to think of it as an attempt at magic. It looks as if they are trying to make what they want to happen happen by enacting it. They attribute the woman's illness to attack by the spirit. They make an image of the spirit to materialise it. They use spells to command the spirit to go down into the image. They speak as if the spirit in the image were a person capable of understanding. They call on it, seek to persuade it to recognise the patient: they appeal to it, giving it reasons for leaving her, for tolerating her. They treat the object as an agent, and then they kill it, cut it open to make it 'cold', take out its heart and insides and cast them over the woman and these fall away from her. They gather something up, the illness in her, and throw it away. Is the expression just the expression of a wish or hope? Is illness a thing to be caught up and thrown away like that? Is it something that can be jolted out or shaken off? Or do they think their actions are going to cause by magical mimesis the desired effect? Can an object they have made understand them and be influenced by their appeals? If you answer 'Yes, that is what they think', you make them believers in magic. If you answer 'No, they mean these things to be understood as symbols or expressions of their hopes and feelings', then it is not so clear that they are doing magic. Most of the actions look quite easy to understand: the imagery is not arcane. The spirit is given a body and treated like a person. The spirit is present in the garden where they go to fetch it. They try to please it with food and fine decoration. They give it eyes and ears to see and hear with so that it can recognise the woman it has afflicted and hear her appeal. What they say implies that if the spirit had recognised who she was and her right to the sago she took, it would not have harmed her. People would be angry with a stranger who trespassed on their land: they would want to hurt her if she stole from them. The spirit is like a person; similar thoughts and feelings are ascribed to it. The concept of the illness is less clear, but it looks as if they treat it as a thing in some respects, something</page><page sequence="13">426 GILBERT LEWIS inside her, to be gathered up, knocked out; something belonging to the spirit, going with it, thrown after it. Habit and belief Human behaviour provides the models to guide many of these actions. They extend the logic of appeal and command beyond people to spirits and things. But do the participants in fact think through the reasoning implied by their actions when they act? They perform the treatment of Panu'et quite often. They are absorbed by the practical details of doing it more than by questions about the assumptions entailed by their actions. A man doing magic or a doctor is possibly quite like a cook or a carpenter in this respect: he does not necessarily think out again each time he acts what could be the logic of what he is doing, the assumptions behind it. He has a skill, knows the routine, gets on with it and does it. Habit and routine make it familiar. If you want the pain to go, take an aspirin. If you want the light on, switch it on. Habit is unthinking. How the aspirin works, why the light comes on, may turn out to be a mystery to you if you really stop to think. Familiarity may take away the look of magic. Certainly spitting, blowing and breathing spells was so common to see among the Gnau that I hardly thought of questioning why they chose to transfer personal qualities and mystical power like that. They had always done it like that. Why should any of them question the method? When we say that we take something for granted, or do it by habit, we usually mean that we do it without much attention or effort of thought. If that counts as belief, it refers to something more like passive acceptance rather than an active belief. The lyimungai banana leaf with the hibiscus flowers stuck in it is a complex Gnau example of how things may lose meaning when they grow too familiar and become just the accepted way to do something in a given context. The lyimungai banana leaf caught my eye at almost every public ritual: it was spat with betel juice blotches at some point and torn down the middle while an invocation was called out and tobacco smoke blown across it over some ashes from a hearth fire. The striking appearance of the leaf and the scarlet flowers provoked me to sterile efforts of ingenuity at reading special symbolic signifi- cance into it. Most people said that it was done to make the rite a success, to bring good: they referred to its benefits according to the context in which it occurred. The reason why they should do it in just that way did not occur to most people I asked. I know how wide of the mark my own guesses were. Someone referred me to a myth with a full description of the first performance in which the type and first example of this action was set out: the creation of live men from bird feathers and brushed herbs at Delubaten. In fact I had been told it long before but never noticed the connexion. Few people thought of mention- ing it when I asked them about the leaf tearing. After the leaf is torn she will get well, they said, thinking of the context, she will stand up, feel light. The leaf tearing epitomises to me how Gnau people may differ individually in the explanations they offer for what they do (Lewis I980: I70-I). The leaf tearing seems to provide a parallel in behaviour and symbolic action for what happens</page><page sequence="14">GILBERT LEWIS 427 when a living metaphor becomes a dead metaphor: the original meaning and association may be almost forgotten. The metaphor has been so often used that speaker and hearer have ceased to be aware that the word is not in its literal sense: then the metaphorical sense is dead. But as Fowler writes (I944: 349), the line of distinction between the live and the dead metaphor is a shifting one. The attitudes of the participants What are the thoughts of the people doing the performance-their awareness and sincerity, degree of conviction? Belief in the dispositional sense refers to the attitudes people take to what they affirm or assert rather than to the content of what they say, their propositions. The set actions may imply certain ideas about the spirit and the illness. But you cannot stop a performance to ask people what they are thinking as they do it, and their thoughts stay largely undisclosed. The climax of the Panu'et treatment is too crowded and busy for careful assessments of the behaviour of many individuals. The earlier phases of preparation, by contrast, are more leisurely, and the conversation and casual comments more revealing about their attitudes and feelings. Much of the conversation, for example, when they were painting the face was about the materials, how to get the paint they were mixing to come up right, how to do the lines, whether to put in dots, and teasing and boasting. One of the younger men says cheerfully, while he is painting the face, 'We've made a mess of it and it's not going to come out right . . . It (i.e. the spirit Panu'et in the image) will knock people all over the place'. He means that when they try to carry the image, it will be troublesome because it will be displeased by the ugly painting. An older man speaks up: 'And what's going on here? They said they would do it, and what then? That cordyline stalk? What's that for? And you lot, laughing away, playing about. You're going to mess it up.' Another says, 'You've brought an awful lot (of lime to make the paint). You should have brought just a little. Perhaps it'll be all right'. Another: 'Why did you think of bringing so much?' First man: 'Because Father told us to.' A senior man shouts out at a toddler who has come much too close to where they are working, 'Hey! Who's this? Off you go! Go and find your mother! Off!' There is risk for the child, they say, from the spirit if the child comes too close to where they are working. And so it goes on. They take special care when it comes to painting the ears and eyes and make comments about doing it well so it will be able to hear. They worry about the time and the sun going down because, they say, ifit gets too late when they try to send the spirit off, it may go offa little way, hesitate, come back again to strike some woman or child standing watching. They criticise each other's work and laugh a lot, encourage each other, joke and shout. One man says 'Put the pig tusks standing upwards (as nose ornaments for the image). You've got them wrong!' Another calls out: 'Don't you know anything yet? Is this the first time you've come? I know how to do your version. Doesn't he even know the way his own kinsman did it?' And another man says 'Just stick them in. Hurry up. It doesn't matter.' A woman calls out in the background for them</page><page sequence="15">428 GILBERT LEWIS not to lean the image against her coconut palm. She is frightened that the spirit will somehow harm her later through the coconuts. One man says: 'That's a tall palm so what could Panu'et do there?' Another: 'So what! It's just Panu'et. What's bad about that?' Another: 'The spirit is the Eagle Spirit (another name for Panu'et) hovering above the coconut, the palm will have lots of coconuts.' Another: 'But what if Panu'et goes down into them and eats them up (so they are empty shells or rotten)' Some of the men laugh at the woman's fears. They have differences of opinion about the order of doing things and the way to fasten on the decorations. When someone says they have painted it so that it's very ugly, another answers, laughing, 'No, I haven't. It's just the white man's way of doing it!' A man calls out that someone has spat betel blotches on the image in the wrong place. Another answers him, saying, 'These are our things, it doesn't matter if he spits there. Anyway when it is over we are just going to throw it away down the rubbish slope.' When they do indeed blow the spells into the image to make the spirit Panu'et 'go down' into it (the verb used, wewaga, literally means 'it goes down into it'-the sense is the spirit enters the image, and the same verb would be used for a spirit which possesses someone), the man, a senior man who was holding one end of the image, called out: 'The spirit has gone down into it there! You think it's nothing! The spirit has gone down into it! What? You just hold it! (Feel how heavy it is).' At times when they commented on how the image felt heavy after the spells, it crossed my mind that they protested too much. Sometimes, in another context (divination) they called out to spectators to come and hold the bamboo pole to feel for themselves how the spirit moved it. As if they wanted to convince the sceptic. Was the man who called out that it felt heavy when the spirit entered it, saying that for the benefit of others? I have quoted these bits of conversation to give an impression of the mixture, the levity, the worry about doing it in time, real anxiety about the dangers, and the jokes and teasing, the off-handedness and the keen attention. They come from a tape recording. Different people show different attitudes and levels of concern, as you would expect. It would not be much good trying to make out a case from this for saying they all believe the same, or that they mean all they say literally. There are no doubt many differences in the experience of the various people present. The sharpest stems from the rule that men are responsible for putting on the performance and they do not allow women to help make the image of the spirit. They have therefore considerable control over the distribution of knowl- edge of the spirit. As women are forbidden to be present when the insides of the spirit are put together, their knowledge cannot match the men's. The men collect and see all that goes into it. The image is made of plant materials skilfully constructed according to the pattern of the human body-with a bark cortex for skin laid over a rib-cage of bamboo, entrails of leaves, cordylines for lungs, dark red begonia leaves for the liver, a long stem for the backbone, a tuber for a heart, a special brown glutinous resin tree-sap for faeces in the bowels-it is an image carefully put together even though from the outside it may look like a simple large long pinkish bundle.</page><page sequence="16">GILBERT LEWIS 429 The sense ofpresence. The image anthropomorphises the spirit in an obvious way. It is easiest for us to think of what the spirit is in a form resembling that of a person. But are we being too simple-minded on their behalf? Do they necess- arily think of it simply like that? There is a small version of the healing rite that one or two men alone can perform. They do not imitate the human form for Panu'et. They go to the garden and collect the same plants, but fewer of them, and bring them back loose in a palm spathe container. The plant 'things of Panu'et' in the small version are merely crushed and screwed up all together in the container. They still speak of this shapeless tangle of plants as Panu'et, sometimes using a plural form-Panungep. One or two very hot stones are pushed in among the leaves and some water poured over them so that billows of scented steam from the now crepitating container envelope the patient crouched over it. This also is a way of making Panu'et present to the patient, in the steam and scent billowing up around her, instead of touching her with an image. Perhaps I have laid too much weight on the image because it is visually striking. I want to describe a scene 'but words do not paint forms'. A written description (or a photograph) will miss out some modalities of the live experi- ence. Scent and sound help in creating the sense of the spirit's presence, but because they are harder to convey I have neglected them until now. Scent, wind and sound are common, very suitable, images for a spirit's presence-they cannot be touched or seen though we sense them-invisible presence. The Gnau say that spirits are in the landscape and among them: a spirit can be, like a scent, a sound or wind, more or less localised or concentrated at a place, for example, Panu'et in the image or at the pool or a sago grove. Panu'et is also in the wind, moving here then there, called Wind Spirit, malet De'aipe, as well as Eagle Spirit. They associate, of course, presence and smell-the odour of human sweat, the way dogs track by scent. It may not be so striking to an onlooker but scent and taste are also signs or aspects of the spirit contained in the herb preparations, both cooked and raw, as well as in the image, the scent coming from its insides, the fragrance of many leaves crushed. The woman feels the sting of nettles, she tastes the ginger in the soup-stew, which also contains mud from the pool at the garden and the flowers of Panu'et. She eats the soup-stew and the herbs, their scent is with her so the spirit will recognise her. The ginger is hot to drive the illness out. These are more private aspects of the experience of spirit presence. They are essential elements in the treatment although they are not perhaps public in the same way as the image is. The plants and herb ingredients belong to the spirit: they must come from the right place. The same association of place and presence occurs in taking mud from the pool where she was struck. The men collect the herbs and young men learn by helping to collect them. The more times they have done it, the better they know what to do. The flowers of Panu'et are esoteric knowledge. While the senior men may leave it to younger men to collect most of the plant materials for making the image, only someone experienced can be trusted to collect the right flowers of Panu'et. They are epiphytes. They have no name. Senior men know them by sight. It is hard to find them. They are essential for the treatment. Sound also makes the spirit manifest. The Gnau identify major spirits with their great songs. The song of Panu'et is many hours long and is performed</page><page sequence="17">430 GILBERT LEWIS when they sing for the building of a new men's ceremonial house. The song contains the basis of the spells of Panu'et. In Gnau the word for 'song' and the word for 'spirit' is the same, a single word-belyi'it; and likewise the word for 'myth' and another word for 'spirit'-malet (Lewis I975: I59). The presence of the spirit and its song are bound up: the spirit is in the song. In the sick woman's confrontation with the spirit, the men chant verses of the song. The spirit is made present to sight, sound, scent, touch, taste. The mixture of media and modalities in which the spirit comes to be known gives a more complex meaning to the presence of the spirit than just the simple anthropomorphic image. Words and song too make the spirit known. The spirit is the song: 'You are the music while the music lasts' wrote Eliot (I964: 44), and he continued: 'These are only hints and guesses, hints followed by guesses' Learning by experience. Some people no doubt see the image as the spirit incarnate. Small children may run terrified when it comes too close. There was the woman who did not want the image leant against her coconut. But the men laughed and joked about that as they fiddled with the decorations they were putting on the image. An older man complained of feeling aches and feeling tired by the emotional intensity of effort he put into blowing his spells into the image. But another said 'Come on, hurry up, it doesn't matter' when someone spat spells in the wrong place. The men handle the image casually most of the time. The significance of the image and its attributes is not established as a body of doctrine. In Gnau society there is no special category of priest to authorise one meaning or dogma as the correct one, the only true interpretation, orthodoxy. Myths and the rules for performance provide a sort of text whose exegesis is left open on many points. Access to some events and to some knowledge is restricted by age and sex. The experience of different categories of people is based on different access; the images of the spirit and the understanding they have must reflect what they have been exposed to. Knowledge and insight come progressively. This is a notable feature of Sepik New Guinea where many societies have elaborate staged initiations, imposing a regular pattern of progress towards knowledge. The initiations also impose a conditioning of attitudes to spirits through the creation of dramatic, sometimes magnificent, sometimes terrifying, ordeals with pain and shock to accompany the gradual unmasking of deceptions about the nature and manifestations of the spirits-deceptions at one level, learning and greater knowledge at another (Forge I968; Tuzin I980; Barth I975; Gell I975; see also Williams I940 for a magnificent account, though not of a Sepik society). The development of belief and scepticism Do these systems, involving deception and tricks, stimulate a scepticism about appearances? In such systems belief must be meant to change as a man grows older. Someone may encounter the spirit first in a ritual meant to terrify him, but later his conceptions change, and he will learn the tricks of how to stage the</page><page sequence="18">GILBERT LEWIS 43I rites for others. Maturity and experience bring different attitudes, a changed quality and content to the knowledge. The nature attributed to spirits and to magic may alter when someone learns how to perform the rites for others. For men at least, there is a path or developmental cycle of belief. For women, as far as I know, this is less striking. The story of Quesalid recounted by Boas (I960: I20-6) is a moving story of shifting convictions. Quesalid, the Kwakiutl shaman, is well-known from Levi-Strauss's version (I963) of the story which he related in his essay on the complex relations between scepticism and belief on the part of a sorceror towards his own magic. Boas knew Quesalid for over thirty years and recorded from him between i897 and I925 four accounts of the same events. Quesalid was in fact George Hunt, Boas's Kwakiutl friend and close collaborator. Boas taught him how to write and Hunt taught Boas what he knew of his own society and art. Boas discusses the shifts in Quesalid's attitude to what had taken place at his initiation to be a shaman in i874 or i870. His belief in the theory and practice of shamanism responds to conflicting pressures: his identification with other shamans, his membership of a secret society, his personal experience of (what sound like epileptic) fits, the prestige and influence of older shamans, then the missionaries, desire to show the white people that he is critical and rational about these things in which he knows the whites do not believe. Boas was sensitively aware that the different versions reflected complex attitudes and motives as Quesalid recalled the past events: they reflected his pride in Indian culture, his wish to impress Boas, to instruct him, his perception of Boas and his interests. They are excellent documents of belief from inside. Again, as to Quesalid's scepticism, I would note the brilliant development of illusion and trickery in Kwakiutl ceremony and art. The Winter ceremonial contained, in wonderful profusion of spectacle, great ingenuity devoted to stage tricks, illusions of decapitation, trap doors for monster-spirits to appear and disappear from, masks with double hidden faces. I suspect that a society which values and competes in such arts of deception must encourage the sceptical spirit which is such a fascinating element in Quesalid's story. A disposition to believe then is not something to be felt either all or none-total commitment or nothing at all. Doubt, fear or desire may affect whether someone wants to believe what he is told or not. Emotion can blind critical judgement; and can stimulate it. Clashes of reason and emotion play a part in the complex attitudes people take to magic and religion. What you know to be the case and what you wish could be the case may interact: people sometimes hope against hope. Thus it may be hard to answer unambiguously whether a statement is meant literally or not. The attitudes behind some action or assertion may be ambivalent. They create a dissonance between the voice of reason saying this is metaphor or this is symbolic, and the voice of feeling which says this could be real, perhaps it could really work. To the extent that anthropological theories seem to present the alternatives as mutually exclusive -either that the people take what they say and do symbolically, or that they mean it literally; but they cannot do both-the theories pose a dilemma which misrepresents the problem. People are not so absolute or consistent. We like to have a clear conclusion and want to hear a verdict. But I do not</page><page sequence="19">432 GILBERT LEWIS think the difference of opinion between the literalist and the symbolist can be answered by saying that one is right, the other wrong. I have suggested that the beliefs of actors in the society may differ with standpoint, occasion, the person asked and so on. The view that there is a single correct answer for that culture or society would depend on agreement about who has the authority to say. The source might be dogmatic: the clergy or textual authority, an elite or official body, an accepted charter in the form of a myth. The observer who does not find one acknowledged source may speculate about the meaning or the original intentions of those who first devised the actions. But the conclusion of his speculations might be his alone. Fieldwork brings us the opportunity to observe people and to ask them questions. For discussions of meaning, aims and reasons, we rely on the actor. We may speculate,faute de mieux, on the evidence we have, as Frazer did, but our license to do so is limited. NOTES This article was originally given as the Frazer Lecture on 24 April I985 in the University of Glasgow. I should like to express my warm thanks to the University for the invitation and their hospitality. At Glasgow I played a recording and showed a short film of the Gnau healing ritual to illustrate some points about representation directly. I have rewritten part of the text here to try and replace that sound and light. 1 I owe this observation to Huizinga's comparison of verbal and plastic expression in the Middle Ages. Let me quote him on the painterJan Van Eyck: 'The sight of this multitude of details fatigues us no more than the sight of reality itself. We only notice them if our attention has been directed to them, and we soon lose sight of them so that they serve only to heighten effects of colouring and perspective. When the same boundless passion for details is displayed in literature, the effect is quite different . . . Most of the authors of the fifteenth century . . . do not know the value of omission, they fill the canvas of their composition with all the details that present themselves, but without giving, as does painting, an accurate image of their particular features-they confine themselves to enumerating them. It is a strictly quantitative method, whereas that of painting is qualitative' (Huizinga I965: 267-8). Huizinga also imagined how different the picture of the civilization of the fifteenth century would have been in the mind of a 'man of culture' in 1840 compared with that of someone now (he was thinking of 1940). His picture would have been rather grim. In 1840 it would have come from reading the histories, chronicles and documents, from Victor Hugo's Notre Dame de Paris, from pages of dark print and rare steel engravings. 'Now,' writes Huizinga (I965: 232-3), 'our perception of former times, our historical organ so to say, is more and more becoming visual . . . The change of our ideas about the Middle Ages is due less to a weakening of the romantic sense than to the substitution of artistic for intellectual appreciation.' We now can show photographs and see the monuments and the objects, the paintings, the illuminated manuscripts, the colour and beauty, the works of religious fervour; and the way we think of that past changes. The media used in representation are new. Conventions of illustration change and so do the illusions of reality that we accept. 2 What other anthropology book has made a film appearance? I mean the book itself, huge on the screen, its purpose to hint at a meaning, as the Golden Bough briefly appears in Apocalypse now. It warns, it hints at a parallel-Kurtz's doom transposed to an appalling modern Heart of darkness, with the slayer in the shadows waiting for his moment. I wish Coppola had shown the Golden Bough as I think of it, deep green covers, mysterious, a dark row of volumes on a shelf in a house remembered from childhood. 3 Pictures have not always had the documentary weight they have now. The medieval reader expected illustrations to show examples of the ideal type, stock exemplars which would provide a visual clarification of the text in terms familiar to him: he did not look for the momentary accidental</page><page sequence="20">GILBERT LEWIS 43 3 lights, the surface appearances of nature, to illustrate the text (Wittkower 1977: 86). But the photographs ofJulia Pastrana (p. v) and the Hairy Family of Mandalay (p. IO9) in Hutchinson et al. Living races of mankind (undated) show that interest in these types of marvels did not wholly die out in the Renaissance. 4 But I should underline 'almost'. Birds would not peck at cherries on the screen. Illusions of reality on film also depend on conventions. And they change. Are you watching real life passing in front of you, invisible voyeur? Or is it a play contrived for the camera? If real life, then why don't the subjects look at the camera? Documentary fashions change and now: Behold! The people see the camera. They speak to it direct. They look at you. How easily we slip into the illusions of the film. We accept films as true and life-like, and forget the havoc they play with time, the flashback, the passage of a month in a minute; we ignore the havoc with sight, details that balloon in size, the switch by magic from one place to another in an eyeblink, the privileged glimpse into private spaces and private moments (MacDougall I982). We come to accept them and scarcely notice the unrealities of the world that we have entered. But despite all that, still photographs, moving films and sound recordings are life-like. 5 Does familiarity desensitise us? The sight of violence or suffering repeatedly on a domestic television screen diminishes the shock of them. In our responses we may begin to mix up fictional violence and filmed images of violence in real life. The thought that images can be contrived to look real may sow a seed of doubt. Magic does not work on the screen, Hitchcock said to Truffaut (Wood I982: 137), because the audience will think the illusion is in the camera rather than in the imagined reality. Visually speaking there would be no difference between someone who is really hypnotised and someone who is pretending. Film deals in appearances rather than in facts. We become harder to shock visually. We become harder to surprise. Familiarisation works two ways-the process through which we may become callous or blase makes us used to the strangeness of strangers. It may allow us to see that others are more like us than we thought before. We find that we can sympathise or identify with them more directly, especially when they seem to speak to us. Perhaps we grow more tolerant. 6 In 1912, a doctor called Wenckebach was visited by a Dutch merchant who wished to rid himself of palpitations. The irregular heart beats were due to auricular fibrillation. When Dr Wenckebach expressed his doubt that he could make them go, the merchant asked why there were heart specialists if they could not accomplish what he himself could already do. Wenckebach was incredulous. The merchant promised to return next day with a regular pulse; and so he did. The story (apocryphal?) is that Wenckebach locked the door, pocketed the key, said he should not leave until he revealed how he had changed his pulse. With quinine, it turned out. The merchant had discovered it by trying out if what was good against malaria would work for his heart too. Such was the path that led to quinidine (an isomer of quinine) a drug still used to control some arrhythmias of the heart (Laurence I966: 421, Wenckebach 1923). The way it produced its effects on the heart was not known until recently. Empirical results which current theories cannot explain may have much in common with magical effects. The attitudes of the magician, the self-conscious empiricist, and the unthinking but effective practical man depend on the different views they take of their own actions and effectiveness, and on how far they push their questions. 7 Scattered in the correspondence on the discovery and original investigations on kuru: Smadel- Gajdusek correspondence, 1955-1958 (ed. Gajdusek 1976: 67, 88, 94, III, 359, etc.) are many ref- erences to the difficulties of obtaining permission for autopsies on the dead kuru patients. A letter in late May 1957 from Gajdusek conveys the flavour: 'Naturally, everyone would like to get their hands on kuru brains; we were lucky to get two and may get further ones, but our ex-cannibals (and not 'ex') do not like the idea of opening the head, although other dismemberment does not seem to perturb them . . . death, however, away from their remote villages does . . . A native-material house is rapidly nearing completion, with a 24 X 24 foot room and table lining all four walls for our specimens . . . Thus, we and our visitors will be able to eat on a table without post mortem specimens at the one end, and be able to do lumbar punctures at night on the other than autopsy tea-lab-typewriting-bench-emergency surgery table, that must be cleared for meals three times a day' (Gajdusek 1976: 94, 95). Shirley Lindenbaum (1979: 124) writes that 'By 1970 exposure to medical research had led them (the Fore) to the hope that if properly used, the ophthalmoscope could reveal the sorcerer's rotting interior'. 8 What insight do we really have into the thoughts and feelings of animals? We cannot</page><page sequence="21">434 GILBERT LEWIS convincingly imagine the mental world of a badger, dark, beetle-sounding, odoriferous. People's impulses and behaviour should be more intelligible to us than those of animals. 9 People do not as a rule draw up an ideology for themselves. Why should anyone, apart from observers with special professional interests, or such odd individuals as prophets or reformers, try to spell out a concise synoptic view or a synthesis and summary of a people's or an individual's outlook on the world? A world-view, an ideology or a 'mentalite' is more likely to have been formulated for a descriptive or analytic purpose by someone else, not the person supposed to have that view himself. It is a matter of approach whether to search for twenty themes or two principles to catch the Spirit of an Age or a People. In any epitome selection is the problem. Should the picture deal with great sweeps of time, with things like silences and inertia, the gestures, the attitudes to life and death, and the unthinking behaviours that might go into the identification of a 'mentalite'? This grand and subtle characterisation of a period and ordinary attitudes and people's state of mind is very different (it is rather passive and inarticulate) from the active, pushing, clear, self-conscious, middle-class intellectualised notion of an ideology (Higonnet I983). 'o It is possible to find out other people's ideas by talking to them and observing what they do. No doubt every fieldworker can think of moments when he or she felt a sense of clear insight into someone's different way of thinking. Take Maurice Freedman reflecting on the look of a landscape to his eyes, and as geomantic prospect in the eyes of his Chinese friend (Freedman I968: 7-8). I recall listening to a man describe his first visit to the coast, how he would sit on the beach just watch- ing the Pacific breakers rolling in, wondering to himself what spirit moved the waves, could make them so fierce, what angered it; or listening to another man, Kantyi, as he told me what his daughter, who was dead, was asking, I could hear her-'she is speaking in these whistles'-a bird in some tree on the edge of the garden in the forest, she was asking about my wife and son whom she had known before, and he answered, also in whistles, a whistled gentle conversation with a wild bird, the spirit of his daughter, in a distant garden, late afternoon. We can gain insight into other people's states of mind by intuition, the sudden transparency granted in a chance gesture or remark, and also by the systematic work of questioning and observation. " In a famous paper on the efficacy of symbols, Levi-Strauss (I963) plunges into these problems when he discusses a healing chant intended to aid delivery in difficult childbirth. First he interprets a symbolism in it appropriate for childbirth. The interpretation shows why the song could seem a way of treatment. Then he goes on with questions of cause and effect to explain how a song might have a physiological effect to help in difficult labour. He takes it for granted that it works and suggests how. But this is an assertion that cannot be taken for granted, or settled by persuasive argument. It is a question of fact and the criteria of efficacy to be used in a judgment. Is the symbolic meaning of the chant recognised equally by the shaman, and by the patient in the end, and by the anthropologist? Could the specific meaning which the anthropologist discerns have an effect if the patient were unaware of that meaning? If the shaman were aware of that meaning, it mightjustify his action even though the patient did not learn the esoteric meaning. But then if the patient were unaware, how could the song have its effect? By some general non-specific soothing influence independent of the symbolic meaning? Levi-Strauss argues that the effect of the song is to make the distressed sick woman relive the initial situation with pain, to reveal to her the causes of her distress, and bring to a conscious level conflicts and resistances which have remained unconscious and this does something to make her uterine contractions stronger, or dilate the passage for birth. The specific symbolic meaning has, he argues, organ-specific effects on the birth passage. Such symbolic imagery can only work on the emotions, he implies, through eventual conscious understanding. After all this speculation, what should we think if the sick woman denied that she thought the chant meant that? Or if she denied that the chant brought her relief? Or if we found the chant was not followed by her safe delivery? The issues involve several criteria: the actor's or the observer's standpoints; literal meaning or symbolic meaning (who consciously identified it?); action or belief, effect on her body (delivery of the baby after obstructed labour, the cause of the obstruction, cephalo-pelvic dispro- portion, transverse lie, breech position, etc.) or effect on the mother's mind (relief from pain, confidence after anxiety, explanation of the cause of her delay). 12 Other interpretations may be called symbolist ones when they are really conclusions about the social effects of certain beliefs or actions, or their social value. The explanation may be called a symbolist interpretation because the observer has deduced behind the surface explanation offered by</page><page sequence="22">GILBERT LEWIS 43 5 the actors a deeper social purpose or some adaptsve function. These so-called symbolist interpret- atsons seem to me to be functionalist ones, scarcely disguised. REFERENCES Barth, F. 1975. Ritual and Knowledge among the Baktaman of New Guinea.

Men go to a garden to make a figure of the spirit Panu'et. They have to collect plant materials for three things: (i) to make the image of the spirit; (ii) to make a cooked herb soup-like stew; (iii) to prepare shredded raw herbs to be chewed in a betel quid. They go to the bush or garden where they think the spirit struck her. They wrap the plant materials into an image of the spirit five or six feet long and there, at the garden, prepare the herbs and cook and eat a meal. They put some food from the meal for the spirit as an offering on a platform. 2. They return to the village, carrying the image. They paint a face with eyes and ears on a flat palm-leaf base. A lyimungai banana leaf is got ready with two hibiscus flowers stuck in it. They put the painted face in position on the image and decorate it with shells, headdress, pigtusks, and tie nettles to sting around the base of the image. 3. The men organising it call for the sick woman to come. They blow and whisper spells into the ears of the image and its headdress. They spit betel red blotches onto the nettles at its base and onto the lyimungai banana leaf. They are ready. The woman must come. 4. They give her the betel quid to chew as she confronts the spirit afflicting her. Someone calls out to prompt her on what she must say. She must spit out, calling out to declare herself to it, say who she is, that she was working sago in her own grove, (i.e. her husband's land, grove and garden), where else could she go, she has only that little tract ofland, so may the spirit leave her alone. Others call what to say. The spirit must recognise her. It shall not resent her as a stranger trespassing on the land. 5. The men gather round. One holds the image so that its base with the nettle leaves is towards her, about to brush her with the stinging base. Another holds the lyimungai leaf over her and the cooked soup in a bowl. The chorus of men gathered round her break into chanted verses of the spirit-song-verses for a woman and for sago. They chant as she is touched and brushed by the image, a man behind her flicks her back with a long stalk of nettle leaves. 6. The image is lifted, waved around her and over her head, passed between her legs, then the base is bashed sharply into the ground to give it a great jolt. The chanting stops. 7. They lay the image on the ground, call for a knife. They cut the image open at the red cordyline leaves standing up from its front in the centre. The leaves are meant to be its lungs. They call this 'cutting open its pouch', or they say they are 'letting the cold in'. They take out its vegetable tuber heart, shredded leaves, some of its insides, which they put on the banana leaf with the hibiscus flowers. 8. They get the soup-stew. They go to the woman, take a morsel of the soup-stew, blow spells with trills into it, and put it into her mouth. Some of them do this by passing the morsel to her with their backs to her, bent-armed over their shoulder. 9. The image torn open lies on the ground. The men call out to the spirit to go off, to</page><page sequence="24">GILBERT LEWIS 437 leave her now, she has only this land. Look on her, they call out, leave her, go to our clan brothers, to their bush. They tear the banana leaf with hibiscus flowers held over her so that the shredded insides of the Panu'et image cascade down over her. IO. Some of the men, mostly older senior men, take nettles and some of the scattered insides, breathe spells into them, and they pat or touch or hit her skin where the pain is, and elsewhere too, down her arms. They seem to gather something with the nettle leaves, brushing it up and then catching it up into the leaves which they wave around her head, throw away with a stiff-armed gawky gesture, calling out to the spirit to go off away from her. Some when they do this, will first tug sharply on her arm, or her knuckles, trying to make them crack. After that, the men who have done all this go off to sit down, to chat and relax. i i. Some women come with hot water to bathe her, first with hot water, then cold. Then the woman goes to lie down by a fire or to her house. The remains of the image, left lying on the ground are thrown away, sometime later, down the slope with the rubbish.</page></plain_text>
