Cormorant fishing is no longer profitable commercially. That at Gifu in Japan is operated as a tourist attraction under the subsidy of the Imperial household. The articles "Birds on Stamps" by W. F. Stanley of the State University College, New York and "Birds on Coins" by V. Clain-Stefanelli of the U. S. National Museum deserve special commendation. They will undoubtedly make bird-watchers out of stamp and coin collectors and vice versa. All in all Birds in Our Lives is a very fine book, well illustrated and one of the best book-buys of the decade.-Elizabeth S. Austin. 47. The Whooping Crane / the bird that defies extinction. Faith McNulty. 1966. E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., New York. 189 pages, illustrated. $4.95. The only fault I can find with this book is its blatantly anthropomorphic subtitle, probably foisted on it by its sales-minded publishers. A far more suitable one, "The thread remains very thin," was given it by the New Yorker magazine, which published much of the book's contents in slightly different form. This fits the circumstances much more accurately. As the book clearly and unmistakably points out, the Whooping Crane has not "defied" extinction, but is barely man- aging to survive, thanks largely to the efforts of the National Audubon Society, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and a handful of dedicated individuals, chief among them my friend, the late Robert Porter Allen, whom the author calls most fittingly the crane's "most ardent and learned champion." While Mrs. McNulty does not claim to be an ornithologist, and so far as I know this is the only article on birds she has published, the book shows her to be a highly capable researcher, an excellent reporter, and a fine writer. She does not seem to have missed a single potential source of information, published or un- published, and she reports a number of significant behind-the-scenes developments she could have learned only by interviewing those close to the events. Most revealing is her delineation of the activities of George Douglass, recently deceased director of the New Orleans zoo, whose maneuverings continually hampered efforts to propagate the species in captivity. The book adds up to a fine contribution to ornithological literature, a clear and lucid exposition of the current status of the Whooping Crane and the species' recent history. The author's simple, straightforward prose maintains the drama and excitement of the case from start to finish, and thank goodness the end is not yet. The birds still have a chance, and efforts such as Mrs. McNulty's in arousing public opinion with such writing are certain to help. I wish every senator and congressman could be made to read it!-O. L. Austin, Jr. 48. Flight Mechanisms and the Orientation of Birds. (Mekhanizmy poleta i orientatsii ptits). S. E. Kleinenberg, editor. 1966. Published for the A. N. Severtsov Institute of Animal Morphology by "Nauka" Publishing House, Moscow. 224 pp. Price 1 ruble, 10 kopecks (about $2.00 U. S.). This book con- sists of an introduction by the editor and eight substantial and well-documented review articles by various authors each with an English summary. In "Some considerations on bionic investigations in ornithology", by N. V. Kokshaiskii the science of "bionics" is defined as a scientific trend attempting to elucidate and apply principles of structure and function evolved by biological systems to the solution of problems in human technology. The use of aims, methods, and prospects of bionically-oriented studies in ornithology is exempli- fied in the problem of flapping-flight. The author suggests that the significance of this problem (other than ornithological) is not so much in creation of flapping- wing aircraft as in the basic physical concepts of "thrust" and "drag." The author states that birds (and all other animals that fly or swim) have long since developed some "thrust generating mechanism" the essential features of which are still unknown. Several possible factors are discussed. In "Mechanization and automation of the birds' wing" by V. E. Yacobi, structural devices presumably effecting increase of lift (wing-tip slots, features of wing surface and of particular feathers) are discussed. Wing automation is mani- fested in adjustments to aerodynamic conditions as afforded by structure of certain feathers, location of their ligaments. and structure of boundary between calamus and rhachis.</page><page sequence="2">1701 Recent Literature April "Surface structure of the avian wing and its possible relation to life" by T. L. Borodulina and K. N. Blagosklonov describes the wing-surface microrelief for a few species of various life modes (aquatic, aerial, and terrestrial), finding that such features vary not only in different species but in the same bird. It is suggested that air-flow over the wing coincides with direction of the furrows, the latter accelerating air flow on the upper surface while retarding it on the lower surface. With a cruide artificial model it was found that the plates with the gull-type of surface micro-relief have more lifting power than smooth ones. "Morpho-ecological adaptations for swift flight in birds" by V. E. Yacobi finds that some factors evidently of importance for accelerated flight are: wing beat frequency, wing structure and profile, wing load, and muscle weight. Certain aspects of swooping flight are discussed and a method for determining flight velocity from motion picture film is described. The features of adaptation for swift flight in representative species of anatids, shore birds, and passerines are described. "On the Reynolds numbers in bird flight" by N. V. Kokshaiskii is rather beyond those not trained in mathematical aerodynamics of which the reviewer is one. The Reynolds number (Re) values for "the mean chord of the wing with regard for its flapping movement" were obtained by means of 16mm films shot in the field, finding that the "Re" varies from 2.104 for wrens, to 5.105 for cranes, values much lower than those for airplanes. It is suggested that the critical range for bird wings, if it exists at all, falls to lower Re values than that for aircraft wings. "On the morphology of filoplumes" by T. L. Borodulina is sufficient in details and timeliness to justify the whole book. It is emphasized that avian plumage is an important and complex formation of a multiplicity of feather types which are in a constant state of action and which serve a variety of functions. Filoplumes are found to be more closely associated with the more mechanically active (e. g. flight) feathers and the innervation around their bases is closer and finer (as shown by excellent histological sections and figures) than for other feathers, strongly suggesting a sensory receptor function for them. Filoplumes are more numerous on the ventral side of the primaries and the dorsal side of the secondaries especially in more aerial birds. No definite muscle fiber connections to the filoplumes could be found. Encapsulated nerve endings (sensory bodies) and densely pigmented cells are also much more numerous around the filoplume follicles. The author agrees with Pfeffer (Zool. Jahrb., Abt. 2, 72, H. 1, 1952) that filoplumes are specialized plumage receptors but believes that their function goes beyond that of signalizing order or disorder in the plumage. The article is illustrated by 13 figures and 6 tables. "On orientation of birds when migrating" by V. E. Yakobi reviews early and modern hypotheses on bird migration, stating that experimental investiga- tions as well as radar studies show that birds can maintain a constant direction of flight, the clues used apparently being azimuths of sun or stars. Flock migration is advantageous in orientation. The author describes his own, developmental hypothesis of orientation as follows: orientation by ecological clues during post- breeding movements is the primary basis; this is replaced by orientation on geo- physical factors (magnetic or gravitational fields, celestial bodies) as local orienta- tion is replaced by that serving for distances. The bibliography of 74 titles is mostly English and American. "Morphology and behavior (as exemplified by herons' feeding activities)" by N. V. Kokshaiskii, with a bibliography of 98 titles, is also very comprehensive of non-Russian literature. The principal structural adaptations of herons for food-taking (neck and bill adaptations, position of eyes and visual fields) are dis- cussed. From examination of morphological features only, it appears that herons would take only readily visible, however agile, prey, but field observations and a survey of the literature show that their food selection is more general. This is achieved through diverse behavioral reactions (habits) that are supplemented and reinforced by various morphological adaptations, with advantageous social re- distribution of functions among and between individual birds and even species. Certain habits provide for perception or flushing of prey (with special foot and wing movements, employed by intra- and interspecific "beating associations" of the heron species involved), and attraction of prey, and various methods for locating prey assemblages have evolved. The role individual habits play in the species' ecology, their probable modes of origin and the their effects on the evolu-</page><page sequence="3">Vol. XXXVIII Recent Literature [171 1967 [7 tion of structural features are discussed. All in all this book should be very satis- fying to mechanically and mathematically inclined ornithologists.-Leon Kelso. 49. The Feathers and Plumage of Birds. A. A. Voitkevich. 1966. October Houise Inc. (134 East 22nd. St., New York, N. Y.; also published by Sidgwick and Jackson, 1 Tavistock Chambers, Bloomsbury Way, London WC1) 335pp. $7.80. This book is presented as a translation of Voitkevich's Pero Ptitsy (1962), reviewed in Bird-Banding, 37: 219, 1966. Although handsomely published in hard cover and contributing substantially to a comparatively neglected field, the book warrants certain reservations. A cursory review finds that of the 104 figures in the original book, 30 have been omitted; of 16 paragraphs in the intro- duction, 5 are absent in the translation; a paragraph of 115 words on p. 11 is missing. Such renderings as "helm" feathers for tail feathers or rectrices and "barrel" for calamus, betray non-biological translators or editors or both. While this does not detract very substantially from the value of the work as a whole, one can but wonder how meek science should be to management by those who are non-scientific in training and tendencies. What editing of translations can mean may be noted in the dedication, opposite p. xvi where straight translation wotuld read: . . . "to the memory of ... Evgenii Svetozarov, killed near Voronezh in the war against the fascist barbar- ians," This section is amended to read: "killed near Voronezh in the war against the Germans."-Leon Kelso. NOTES AND NEWS Prices for mist nets sold by NEBBA have been maintained at the October, 1962 level, despite another increase in parcel post rates in January. This increase bears more heavily on NEBBA than on the average shipper because of the light weight of the nets. Increases of about ten cents in each postal rate bracket amount to as much as a 25% increase. An active netter in North Carolina comments: "My observations indicate that the chief cause of deterioration of the nets is light, not heat or moisture. Some nets in full shade in the woods have been in fair condition after being out continuously for a year. In the open in the summer the limit is under three months." This suggests that nets which are not in use daily will last longer if taken down between periods of use rather than furled, particularly in the open in summer. The balance between the extra labor of taking them down completely and the longer life of course depends on the individual situation. And in some situations, involving rough net lanes or numbers of animals, the life of the net is determined by damage more than by gradual deterioration. Incidentally, nets stored indoors may last longer if completely covered from the light, even though the ultra-violet portion of sunlight, outdoors, is a much more significant factor. Details on NEBBA nets may be obtained from Mr. E. A. Bergstrom, 37 Old Brook Road, West Hartford, Conn. 06117. All orders for delivery in the U. S. should include the zip code, as this is now the basis for determining parcel post zone.

The Long Point Bird Observatory will be conducting a continuous program of observations and banding of migrant and resident birds from April 1 to October 31, 1967 at Long Point on the Ontario shore of Lake Erie. The Observatory is situated at the eastern end of the Point, about 18 miles from the nearest road. Last year about 15,000 birds of 150 species were banded at the Observatory. Most of the birds are trapped in the Observatory's five Heligoland Traps. Accommoda- tion is available at the Observatory for a limited number of experienced observers or banders who are willing to assist in the work of the Observatory for periods of one week or longer. Accommodation includes bunks and cooking facilities, but visitors must bring their own sleeping bags, air mattresses and food. A fee is charged for accommodation and transportation on Long Point. Further details may be obtained from Mrs. J. Woodford, 76 Glentworth Road, Willowdale, Ontario, Canada.</page></plain_text>
