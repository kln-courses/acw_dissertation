Locke's appeal to simple ideas stems from a mistrust of thinking: simple ideas are objective because they are free of thought Hegel objects to simple ideas on logical and phe- nomenological grounds. Hegel's phenomenology of sense-certainty (sensation) shows that the immediate is mediated: thought is the inescapable medium of consciousness. Hegel's phenomenology of perception finds that we perceive things and their properties; simple ideas are bad abstractions from the properties of things. Hegel's phenomenology frees us from the skepticism induced by the empiricist dogma that the mind-independent can be factored out from the mind-dependent. Few empiricism. consider But Hegel Hegel's when Phenomenology the topic is empiricism of Spirit responds or the dogmas to Locke's of empiricism. But Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit responds to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in ways generally over- looked.1 Both Hegel and Locke agree that philosophy embarks from an account of experience.2 Both begin with experience that seeks to know its object, as opposed to the worldly practices that Heidegger depicts as primordial. Both turn to sensing as the original experience from which knowledge arises.3 The empiricist slogan "back to experience" means "back to sensations." For both, empiricism corrects the dogmatism that posits ideas prior to experience. In rejecting innate ideas, Locke asserts that all knowledge comes from experience and that complex experiences aggregate the simplest sensations. Hegel's systems of logic, nature, and spirit presuppose the Phenomenology* s exposition of experience. Be- fore concepts are examined in logic, they are uncovered in experience. Logic is Nachdenken , thinking on worldly thinking. Hegel upholds the empirical ideal: to grasp the world as it exists, not as it ought to be. He 347</page><page sequence="2">348 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY credits Locke for rejecting the definitional approach of his predecessors (Hegel 1974, 296). Ideas without roots in experience are mere "oughts," not the proper concern of philosophy. Philosophy should not ponder how the world ought to be; its task is to comprehend what exists, what Hegel calls "actuality." For Hegel and Locke, the task of philosophy is akin to science: understanding this world. In Hegel's view, the focus on experience marks a major advance in the history of philosophy. By insisting that "we ought to see for ourselves," empiricism contributes to the centrality of individual freedom that shapes the modern world: In Empiricism there lies this great principle, that what is true must be in actuality and must be there for our perception. This principle is opposed to the "ought" through which reflection inflates itself, and looks down upon what is actual and present in the name of a Beyond. . . . [W]e must recognize also the important principle of freedom that lies in Empiricism; namely, that what ought to count in our human knowing, we ought to see for ourselves , and to know ourselves as pres- ent in it. (Hegel 1991, #38, 77)4 Hegel's debt to empiricism runs deep. But how experience is understood is decisive. The mistrust of thinking embedded in the mainstream of modern empiricism thwarts its endeavor to know the world. Empiricism repeatedly sails forth in confidence only to reverse into skepticism. How does a project directed at knowing the world conclude that the world is unknowable? Hegel locates the failure in the concepts with which mainstream empiricism frames experience.5 As Hegel urges in the concluding paragraphs of the "Introduction" to the Phenomenology , experience is the experience of consciousness. The true is not something given; it is the outcome of the dialectical move- ment of consciousness, which tests what it first takes to be the object in itself against the object as it is in itself for consciousness: "Upon this distinction . . . the examination rests" (Hegel 1977, 54). Experience, then, is "this dialectical movement which consciousness exercises on itself and which affects both its knowledge and its object" (ibid., 55). The true is "the being-for-consciousness of this in-itself," that is, the in-itself that results from consciousness's own dialectical movement. In this way, Hegel recognizes the moment of the for-consciousness as integral to the objects of knowledge and to truth. With this phenomenology of knowing, Hegel blocks the skeptical move that factors out the in-itself and the truth from the for-us. This article presents Hegel's critique of Locke and considers the implications for reviving the promise of empiricism to grasp the world. First, I contrast Locke and Hegel on the topic of simple ideas. Hegel objects to simple ideas on logical and phenomenological grounds. Cat-</page><page sequence="3">HEGEL'S CRITIQUE OF LOCKE'S SIMPLE IDEAS 349 egories from Hegel's Science of Logic are used to identify the defective or pseudo logic inherent in Locke's simple ideas. I then turn to the first two chapters of the Phenomenology, where Hegel depicts the outcome of sensing, followed by the perception of things. Second, I show how Hegel's and Locke's accounts of sensing give rise to sharply opposed analyses of experience. Locke factors out what belongs solely to the mind from what is independent of it.6 Hegel's first phenomenological move is to dismiss this kind of analysis as misguided. Locke defends simple ideas; Hegel rejects them as bogus. The topics subsequent to sensing are the same: both move from sensing to things and to essences. Where Locke repeatedly splits off what is relative to mind (for-us) from what is inher- ent in the object (the in-itself), Hegel repeatedly shows how experience always has an object that is already determined in specific ways that reveal its inherent limitations. What is central for Hegel are the de- terminations that constitute - not filter - experience. Hegel's enduring legacy is analysis that focuses on the concepts in play and their, not our, limitations for grasping the experience at hand. From Hegel arises a kind of analysis that tracks the concepts or inherent determinateness of experience without apology.7 Third, I consider the implications of these differences for the practice of philosophy. Hegel and Locke present contrasting approaches to under- standing the world. The significance of Hegel's kind of analysis has been largely overlooked. Subsequent thinkers may reject Locke's simple ideas yet accept the task of factoring what is native to mind from what is purely objective or in itself. This split between what is mind-dependent and what is mind-independent constitutes a world picture that doggedly engenders the dogmas of empiricism by which it flips over into skepticism.8 From the imagined separability of mind from world issues the presumption that all thinking is factoring. As one dogma is unmasked (innate ideas, myth of given, analytic/synthetic distinction, verificationism, or conceptual scheme), another slides into place and the picture remains. According to the scheme of factoring, concepts are added to the nonconceptual; what gives form can be separated from the formless. For Hegel, concepts do not contrast with what is formless or outside the conceptual, for nothing is absolutely outside it. While determinations are more or less true, the notion that things in themselves lack any conceptual determinations signifies a defective mindset, since its first, and hopeless, task would be to say what it is to be pure content or "outside" thought. With the uprooting of the third dogma of empiricism - the bifurca- tion between conceptual schemes and an uninterpreted world - Donald Davidson (2001) says that empiricism comes to a close. His judgment presumes that empiricism requires the dogmas. But this farewell is hasty. Hegel's phenomenology offers experience-based analysis without</page><page sequence="4">350 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY the dogmas. Its first accomplishment is to discredit the supposition in- herent in the world picture that posits mind as separable from the world (see Schüler 2008). Hegel shows that it is never the task of philosophy to factor out the purely subjective from the purely objective; because mind is inseparable from world, such efforts are quixotic. That is the only conclusion that squares with the evidence of experience. Asking whether a determination is purely subjective or purely objective is always the wrong question. Hegel claims that "nothing at all hangs upon the distinction between subjectivity and objectivity. . . . [I]nstead, everything hangs upon the content, and that is both subjective and objective" (1991, addition 3 to #42, 86). Mind does not add concepts to the aconceptual content of sensation.9 Conceptual determinations are always already there. Instead of the worry about what comes from mind or from world, Hegel focuses attention on the determinations of experience and their limits. The origin of concepts is never the issue.10 In this way, the promise of empiricism - to understand the world - is renewed. Uprooting dogmas closes the book on skepticism, not empiricism. Locke on Sensing Locke's Essay begins with brash objections to the notion that the mind comes furnished with innate ideas or principles of any kind. His con- clusion is sweeping: experience is the sole source of the mind's content. Apart from experience, the mind is a blank sheet. Experience arises from two sources: sensations of external objects and the internal im- pressions of reflection. These discrete sensations and impressions are called simple ideas. Mind has the power to manipulate simple ideas and build up knowledge, but mind lacks the power to create simple ideas. Simple ideas are simply given. 11 All knowledge, from philosophy to sci- ence, arises from them. Like Descartes, Locke rests the strength of his reasoning on the strength of its foundations. But Locke does not acknowledge doing anything to arrive at simple ideas. He assumes that pure passivity is required to secure the foundations of knowledge. To uncover his founda- tions, Descartes first defends the method that begins with radical doubt. The plainness of Lockean introspection presumably requires no defense. Locke begins directly, as if simple ideas are lined up immediately before the mind. Simple ideas are strange entities. As given immediately, they are deemed unimpeachable, inalterable, and well articulated. In Book Four of the Essay, Locke identifies sensation as one of the four kinds of cer- tainty. A simple idea is thrust on us and cannot be elicited or modified at will. Like the atoms of ancient materialism, simple ideas are irreduc-</page><page sequence="5">HEGEL'S CRITIQUE OF LOCKE'S SIMPLE IDEAS 351 ible: they lack parts and do not change; they can only be aggregated in various ways: Understanding . . . has the power to repeat, compare, and unite them even to an almost infinite variety, and so can make at pleasure new complex ideas. But it is not in the power of the most exalted wit, or enlarged understanding ... to invent or frame one new simple idea in the mind . . . nor can any force of the understanding, destroy those that are there. (Locke 1982, 119) The strangeness of simple ideas reveals how Locke conceives of analy- sis: certainty must be established from the start. And certainty means immediate contact with what is outside of mind's activity. Hegel calls per- ception of things deceptive. As Locke conceives a foundation, if philosophy were to begin with what is deceptive, truth would be permanently out of reach. We cannot get to truth unless certainty is posited from the start. Sensing is involuntary and transparent. There are no indeterminate fringes in sensation; a sensation begins and ends with the abruptness of the number one. In simple ideas, the subject's activity is reduced to zero, pure receptivity. The passivity of the mind guarantees their objec- tivity. Simple ideas are infallible registers of the objects outside mind: Our simple ideas can none of them be false, in respect of things exist- ing without us. For the truth of these appearances, or perceptions in our minds, consisting, as has been said, only in their being answer- able to the powers in external objects, to produce by our senses such appearances in us. . . . Blue or yellow, bitter or sweet, can never be false ideas, these perceptions in the mind, are just such as they are there, answering the powers appointed by God to produce them; and so are truly, what they are, and are intended to be. (Locke 1982, 390)12 These atoms do not change; one sensation can be replaced by a subse- quent one: experience is a card game played with the deck of simple ideas. But a sensation does not become. Experience is a game of now you sense it, now you don't. In a peculiar way, change vanishes from experience. Mistrust of Thinking Hegel identifies empiricism as belonging to the second attitude toward objectivity, following the first attitude of traditional metaphysics.13 In Hegel's account, the odd notion of simple ideas arises from empiricism's suspicion of thinking. Empiricism blames thinking for the blunders of traditional metaphysics. Thinking gets a bad reputation for being the source of dogmatism. Disregard for experience, in the empiricist's view, gives thinking license to posit whatever it deems rational. The integrity of empiricism comes from the purity of sensations given without input from thinking. Immediate, passive reception gives sensations their authority</page><page sequence="6">352 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY as indubitable. As thus posited, simple ideas bear the burden of access to reality and securing content for philosophy. Simple ideas plug mind into the world; sensing signifies pure objectivity. Simplicity inherently closes off any possibility of the mind's meddling: as simple, sensations lack any ingress for subjectivity. For Locke, the simplicity of sensations guarantees their objectivity. The endeavor to secure the pure immediacy of the contact spells trouble, in Hegel's view. The appeal to the simple idea is born out of the demand to separate cleanly the given from what is added by mind - the modus operandi of factoring philosophy. When sensations are revealed as sheer content - the bare particulars - the suspicion of thinking shows itself in the view of concepts as extraneous, value-added to the formless given. Mind is painted into a corner as a meddler. The determination to separate mind and world is seen as a guarantor of objectivity, but this sets the scene for a skeptical outcome. For if the purely given is required for objectivity and the purely given is later deemed a myth, then objectivity lies out of reach. Thinking is required for knowledge, but, like the Midas touch, thinking contaminates whatever it touches. Locke seeks to avoid this impasse by abstracting the universal from simple ideas. In the Lectures, Hegel charges that Locke's account of abstraction is tautological (1974, 307) and that where thinking is concerned, "the matter itself, the essence, is not touched upon at all" (ibid.) The impossibility of abstracting universais from bare particulars matches the hopeless task, as Donald Davidson (2001, 192) suggests, of organizing a closet full of indeterminate stuff. Locke fails to come to grips with the phenomenon of thinking. Meager Concepts and Pseudo-Concepts Because of his perceived need to secure a bulwark against thinking, Locke does not acknowledge the thinking presupposed by his account of sensing. Clearly, we experience things in the world. If we look a little closer, Locke suggests, we would notice simple ideas alongside the things. In Locke's initial inventory of the contents of the understanding, simple ideas like whiteness line up alongside elephant or man. Locke's list suggests that simple ideas are given in the same way that things are perceived: Every man being conscious to himself, that he thinks, and that which his mind is employed about while thinking, being the ideas, that are there, tis past doubt, that men have in their minds several ideas, such as . . . whiteness, hardness . . . thinking, motion, man, elephant, army, drunkenness. (Locke 1982, 104) Any account of experience includes the things around us. No digging is required to arrive at things. But digging and smelting are required to</page><page sequence="7">HEGEL'S CRITIQUE OF LOCKE'S SIMPLE IDEAS 353 arrive at simple ideas. We do not find Red or Hot lying on the stove. We see something red or feel the hot stove. Color belongs to things. Heat be- longs to hot things. Locke later defines substances or things as collections of simple ideas. Presumably, simple ideas come first as separable from things. Locke can move from simple ideas to things without hesitation because things are preconceived as collections of simple ideas. The plan to secure experience on a foundation of simple ideas fails utterly, in Hegel's judgment. If we reconstruct the implicit analysis concealed behind claims of self-evidence, simple ideas turn out to be pseudo-concepts. A pseudo-concept differs from a meager concept. "Thing and properties" are the objects of perception, according to Hegel; they are meager concepts that say little. These basic determinations are adequate guides to perception, but, as meager concepts, they are super- seded by more determinate concepts as the drive to understand takes us into the forces that constitute things. A pseudo-concept claims to point out objects of experience but turns out to point to nothing actual. A meager concept has little content; a pseudo-concept lacks an object. The concept of blue raises no questions; the simple idea Blue is spuri- ous to the core. Its emptiness can be mistaken for intuitive certainty. Lacking all determination, a pseudo-concept cannot develop into more adequate concepts. It is a sterile utterance. When it mistrusts thinking, empiricism is ill-equipped to recognize pseudo-concepts; what it deems self-evident is removed from the scru- tiny that could spot an imposter. What makes a simple idea initially plausible is its ancestry: it resembles the recognizable concepts of parts and properties. Parts and properties both characterize the things of experience. Having parts and having properties are simple, legitimate determinations. Things can be broken down into parts; properties per- tain to things as a whole. The parts of a rose are roots, stem, leaves, and blossom. Parts can be broken down further, for example, a leaf crushed into meal. Properties constitute things as a whole: the rose's color, scent, shape, and growing pattern differ from the lilac's. One breed of dog's instinctive behavior differs from another's. Parts can be separated: the eraser is broken off from the pencil, the blossom snipped from the rose. We cannot break off properties into smaller properties. Parts are sepa- rable; properties are not. A corrupted thing may lose a property - salt may lose its savor - but not because a property is separated off, like Peter Pan's shadow. We can focus on one property, such as color, to the exclusion of the thing's shape. But properties belong to the whole and cannot be pulled off like petals from the rose. How the thing is conceived is decisive for the prospects of empiricism. Locke begins with sensations, claims to discover simple ideas there, and</page><page sequence="8">354 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY then defines a thing as a collection of simple ideas. If things are clusters of sensations, then presumably we can get to things by collecting the dispersed sensations. Hegel rejects simple ideas as a false start. This is the lesson of "Sense Certainty" in the Phenomenology. What we learn from the failure of simple ideas is that things are there at the onset of experience. In the Phenomenology1 s account of perception, the thing is perceived as a collection of properties, not sensations. We can break things into separable parts, we can focus selectively on inseparable properties, but we cannot get to a thing by bundling detached sensations. What is bundled are properties that already refer to the thing from the start. We can focus on a single property of a thing. But this act of attention does not separate the property from the thing. The red of an apple does not become the simple idea of red. While simple ideas are imposters, the term "red" clearly is no impostor. What Locke calls simple ideas are general terms that abstract from particular experience. General terms are fundamental to reflection and are presupposed by perception: we only perceive this particular flower as a rose due to a general understanding of rose. In Hegel's account, perception always has an object - even if its identity is unknown. To perceive a thing as this kind of thing presupposes general terms. In phenomenological terms, the simple idea attempts the impossible: to isolate the particular from the universal as if we could sense "this red" apart from the general ideas of red or color. We have no trouble understanding general terms apart from expe- rience. But Locke and Hegel insist that philosophy must begin with experience and not with ideas that abstract from it. Does the particular red of the rose at any point become "red," a free-standing simple idea? Can we move from perceiving a particular dog to sensing the simple idea of "four-legged"? The concept of property is yoked to the concept of thing in what Hegel calls an essential relation. Properties inherently belong, for example, the redness o/"this rose. Properties do not exist as separable entities; properties are properties of. In attempting to de- tach the specific property from the thing, the red of this rose becomes a bare particular - this redness without the rose. We do not experience particularity apart from the universal. This means, in Hegel's terms, particularity is mediated or essentially related to the universal. We perceive red as a color or the redness of the rose; we perceive no simple ideas. The simple idea is a changeling that borrows from properties and parts. Intermingling the separability of parts with the qualitative sim- plicity of properties yields the pseudo-concept of a bare particular. The bare particular is the changeling - a conceptual surd. Like an atom, unmediated and irreducible, it signifies that analysis has reached an</page><page sequence="9">HEGEL'S CRITIQUE OF LOCKE'S SIMPLE IDEAS 355 absolute limit. It is treated like a part that can stand alone. And like a property, the simple idea characterizes the bare particular as a whole. A core lesson for Hegel is that any so-called concept without media- tion lacks power and content; it cannot pick out features of the world.14 Simple ideas are concept pretenders. Calling them self-evident covers up not their poverty but their utter lack of meaning. As soon as the simple idea is examined, its claim to self-evidence fizzles. We cannot move from a simple idea to arrive at a thing; we simply replace the bogus simple idea Red with an actual property, the red of the rose. There is nothing for a pseudo-concept like simple idea to be the concept of. Thing and property are meager concepts. Meager notions say little but perform their task. A meager concept like a thing and its properties has content that can develop. Worse than the innate ideas they replace, simple ideas are fixations or dogmas. Sensation is the empiricist dogma of theoretical reason, and pleasure is the corresponding empiricist dogma of practical reason. Together, sensation and pleasure are the putative bare particulars that anchor a defective view of reason familiar from modern thought and indebted to the Hellenistic philosophies of Stoicism, Skepticism, and Epicurean- ism. In reality, sensations and pleasures are not separable from the things that give rise to them. Sensations and pleasures are mediated, for example, the red o/" the rose or the pleasure of eating together. We can focus on an aspect of experience, such as pleasure, but this aspect cannot be broken off from its object. What Anscombe and Heidegger will later recognize as the as-structure of ordinary perception, Hegel calls mediation.15 The bare particular of simple ideas lacks mediation or the as-structure. Just as the things to which they belong come in kinds, so too do perceptions and pleasures. The Essence Logic Hegel's Science of Logic follows the Phenomenology and lays out the pure determinations of reality on three levels: being, essence, and con- cept. The second part of the Science of Logic is the essence logic. Here are determinations of experience, the categories that we would expect to be employed in empiricism. The categories of essence are determined by reflection since only reflection can get at the essence of being that appears in experience. Because essence posits the inessential, reflec- tion designates its object in determinations that come in pairs, such as identity/difference, ground/grounded, content/form, essential/inessential, whole/parts, cause/effect, inner/outer, thing/property, active/passive, and attracting/repelling forces. The character of reflection itself changes as it advances through the categories. Hegel distinguishes external reflection</page><page sequence="10">356 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY from determining reflection. External reflection sets its categories side by side and separates the essential from the inessential. The way the categories go together remains implicit. In determining reflection, one category explicitly refers to the other and posits the connection, as at- tracting force points to repelling force. Since one category presupposes the other, the distinction of essential and inessential gives way to an essence that requires both determinations. What was seen by external reflection as inessential is recognized as equally essential. Reflection begins simply as external: the categories of property and thing are side by side. External reflection constitutes the object of perception as a thing with properties, though we do not understand how this composite comes about or holds together. Thing and property, the categories of external reflection, fall short of the categories of cause and effect, which determine things from within. To understand the forces that make things what they are is the work of determining reflection. How does the essence logic relate to the categories that precede and follow it? The logic of essence presupposes the more fundamental logic of being. The concepts of being do not arise in reflective pairs but rather designate general features of reality: becoming, quality, quantity, and measure. These pervasive features are presupposed by the essence logic. Accessible only through the logic of reflection, essence presupposes something reflected on. The categories of the essence logic designate experience in terms of its object: the essence that appears. The concept, or subjective logic, the third division of Hegel's logic, is subsequent to essence. Here the thought determinations always involved in knowing are explicitly expounded: concepts, judgments, syllogisms, and ideas. On each level, categories move to a more complex, determinate, and self- reflective state. The final section, the absolute idea, is the explication of the thinking required for philosophy to recognize and delineate the determinations of being, essence, and concept - self-reflective thinking taken to the highest degree. Empiricism employs the categories of the essence logic, more specifi- cally, the distinctions of external reflection. Empiricism, like traditional metaphysics, is tempted to step back from experience to a foundation more fundamental than the recognizable world. The imposter simple idea mimics the encompassing logic of quality, which is a determina- tion of being. All that is has its way of being, its qualitative state. A quality is mediated from within; qualities have degrees of intensity, for example, more or less of the qualitative state. As a basic determination of being, quality does not directly refer to its other, as do the categories of reflection. Quality is a fundamental feature of all being. It is more encompassing and less determinate than properties. Properties belong to things. Quality pertains to things, parts, properties, perception, and</page><page sequence="11">HEGEL'S CRITIQUE OF LOCKE'S SIMPLE IDEAS 357 the whole of reality. When the qualitative feature of red is in focus, it ranges from scarlet to rust and beyond. Simple ideas lack mediation, including that of intensity; they are simple precisely because they lack all mediation. The simple idea erases both the intensive dimension of color and its status as a property of something. The simple idea red no longer belongs to the rose. It is not more or less red. As legitimate distinctions, property and quality both provide mediation. The general idea of red, like all general ideas, results from the work of understanding experience. The simple idea of red is a pseudo-notion because there is no experience of red without a determinate level of intensity: red is never simple. It is a mistake to identify a pseudo-concept with the legitimate concept. An experience stripped of qualitative degree is a bare particular, that is, a pseudo-concept. The bogus particular is the end station of a mindset mistrustful of thinking. Hegel's Critique of Sense-Certainty as Pseudo-Concept The opening chapter of the Phenomenology, "Sense-Certainty," is Hegel's response to Locke's assertion of simple ideas; Hegel's second chapter, "Perception: Things and Deceptiveness," is his response to Locke's notion that things are collections of simple ideas.16 What is sensed immediately promises to be absolutely certain but fails completely. Sense-certainty designates its object as the purely singular sensation: "this," "here," and "now." "Sense-Certainty appears to be the truest knowledge; for it has not as yet omitted anything from the object, but has the object before it in its perfect entirety" (Hegel 1977, 58). Sensing grasps what is immediately present, seizes what is here and now. But what happens when this object is put into words? What is directly sensed is "this" before me. This "this" cannot be doubted, since sensing directly reveals objectivity. But one "now" vanishes into the next; one certainty is replaced by others. Unless sense-certainty can say what it means, the vanishing cannot be stopped. The perplexity arises when this presently sensed item is put into words. What sense certainty upholds cannot be put into words. The particular aspect, whether "this," "here," or "now," cannot be expressed without relating it to others. Sense-certainty meant to signify this present sensation in its singularity and absolute certainty. But lan- guage involves connections or mediations; what sense-certainty meant is unique and singular. What it meant cannot be spoken. Naming this present sensation "red" associates it with other red things; naming the present "night" contrasts it with day. An assertion that cannot be put into words cannot be thought; it cannot be tested. What exactly is sense-certainty certain about? It is</page><page sequence="12">358 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY impossible to say. The certainty is not simply speechless; gestures can- not succeed in capturing the given. One can no more point to a purely particular aspect than one can name it. Sensations are evanescent, belying the persistence of Locke's simple ideas. From the failure to make sense of immediate knowing, consciousness learns the perplexing truth that what is immediate or given is already mediated. What seemed so obvious - that mediation requires the purely immediate - stops making sense when the object of experience is put into words. The purely immediate is nowhere to be grasped. The criterion of pure immediacy cannot be employed. The Poverty of Perception In Hegel's Phenomenology, failure is instructive. When pure immediacy fails to live up to its own name, both the object of "sense-certainty" and our knowledge of it change. The object of consciousness no longer is the fleeting moment but rather a thing with properties that lasts through time. Perception - the form of experience subsequent to sense- certainty - grasps its object as this one thing that is "also" defined by many properties. The one thing is mediated or related to its properties; perception takes as its object a thing that endures through time, not a vanishing particular. Perception is the topic of Chapter 2 of Hegel's Phenomenology}1 Like Locke, Hegel describes the perception that seeks to know, not the relaxed awareness of routine activity. Locke designates things as collections of simple ideas. Hegel finds things to be the objects of perception by reject- ing simple ideas as a false start. As perception, consciousness identifies truth with the things that it perceives and no longer with the chimera of sensed particulars. Consciousness finds these things before it and forgets that their steady presence was "logically necessitated" because of the failure of immediate knowledge ("sense-certainty"). The thing differs from the sensed moment because it lasts through time and is available for public viewing. Perception achieves permanence because, unlike sense-certainty, it contains difference or negation within it: though the thing and its properties constitute the object of perception, the thing and its properties differ. The properties give the thing content and set it in relationship with other things as well as with the perceiving subject. "A world of things" epitomizes the detachment, independence, and stability that empiricism respects. So it is surprising that something seemingly so settled as a thing should harbor a "whirling circle of abstractions" and give rise to unending deceit. Hegel's focus is on the underlying concepts that set limits to experi- ence. A thing defined by properties is the object of perception. Thing and</page><page sequence="13">HEGEL'S CRITIQUE OF LOCKE'S SIMPLE IDEAS 359 properties are determined by external reflection, where the essential excludes the inessential, which tags along. To explicate things, perception abides by this logic: externality is how essence appears in perception. The determinations of perception are kept separate to make sense. In the Phenomenology, perception cycles through three ways to establish perception as truth. First, consciousness protects the integrity of things by blaming all inconsistencies on the perceiving subject. Externality exists between the thing and the perceiver. The thing, salt, for example, is what remains self-identical; consequently, all multiple traits must originate within faulty perceptions. If oneness is said to inhere in the thing, salt, then the many properties - white, tart, cubical - are relative to the perceiver. But without properties, the thing's oneness is empty (Locke's something-I- know-not-what), and it does not differ from other things. To be a specific thing, the properties must somehow inhere in oneness. Perception's second strategy restores plurality to the thing as a set of independent properties and leaves consciousness to provide for the unity within the manifold. Consciousness concludes that the diverse and inde- pendent properties are held together by perception. They exist as many or also but are perceived as one. The perceiver bundles properties - white, tart, cubical - into a thing, salt. From the experience of perception, consciousness learns that the thing has two faces, each of which is equally necessary, although incompat- ible with the other. The thing is a one that excludes all other things, but the properties that give this one specific meaning also serve to set it in relation to other things and undermine its individuality. At the stage of perception, consciousness is capable of regarding unity only as void of content and content as void of unity. In its third formulation, perception admits that both determinations are inherent in the thing but conceives of them as inhabiting different zones. Opposite determinations can inhabit the thing if we wall them off from each other. So, consciousness divides its object into essential and inessential zones and distributes the contradiction between the thing-in-itself and the thing-for-others: Accordingly, the Thing is for itself and also for an other, a being that is doubly differentiated but also a One; but the oneness contradicts this diversity. Hence consciousness would again have to assume respon- sibility for placing (the diversity) in the One and for keeping it away from the Thing. It would have to say that insofar as it is for itself, the Thing is not for an other. . . . The contradiction which is present in the objective essence as a whole is distributed between two objects. In and for itself the Thing is self-identical, but this unity with itself is disturbed by other Things. Thus the unity of the thing is preserved</page><page sequence="14">360 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY and at the same time the otherness is preserved outside of the Thing as well as outside of consciousness. (Hegel 1977, 74) The effort to derive knowledge from perception runs into the limits of external reflection. Contradiction arrives when it is no longer plausible to speak of aspects of the thing that are inessential yet necessary. The thing's content has to exist as much for-itself as for-others, and the thing's unity likewise must determine both facets of its existence. Distinctions that are limited to one side of the thing are empty, thus equally capable of being taken as essential or inessential. External reflection is destined to flip-flopping. The solid common sense that identifies truth with the perception of things shows itself in the end to be riddled with contradiction, accord- ing to Hegel. All the determinations of perception - oneness, diversity, thing, property - emerge as meager abstractions in that experience. The properties that were supposed to give content to the thing turn into "miniature" things that must be separated from one another to preserve externality. Perception cannot escape from the confines of its abstrac- tions by moving in for close-ups (distinguishing the properties) or by moving out for an external view (distinguishing the thing-in-itself from the thing-for-others). On either scale, the same pattern repeats itself. Perception ends up as sophistry because its notion of truth only goes so far as to exclude. The limits of external reflection are the limits of perception. Without adequate grounds to distinguish the essential from the nonessential, perception easily shifts its position as the situation requires: This "sound common sense" which takes itself to be a solid, realistic consciousness is, in the perceptual process, only the play of these abstractions; generally, it is always at its poorest where it fancies itself to be the richest. Bandied about by these vacuous "essences," thrown into the arms first of one and then of the other, and striving by its sophistry to hold fast and affirm alternatively first one of the "essences" and then the directly opposite one, it sets itself against the truth and holds the opinion that philosophy is concerned only with mental entities. (Hegel 1977, 77-78) Consciousness is led by the determinations of perception into the sophistry that contradicts itself from moment to moment. The self- identical, publicly observable truths that it hoped to perceive have long since vanished. If it stays attached to its abstractions, consciousness is forced into deceit as it "tries to make them true by at one time making itself responsible for their untruth, while at another time it calls their deceptiveness a semblance of the unreliability of Things" (ibid., 79). The clarity of the thing dissolves as consciousness arrives at the conclusion</page><page sequence="15">HEGEL'S CRITIQUE OF LOCKE'S SIMPLE IDEAS 361 that truth is not perceived in this world. To get to truth, perception must push on to understand the forces that determine the relations within and between things. Factoring Philosophy and the Dogmas Hegel and Locke share the determination to return philosophy to expe- rience as its origin. Hegel's phenomenology breaks away from Locke's analysis in their accounts of sensing. For Locke, sensations (inner and outer) are the first, and fixed, objects of consciousness, out of which all knowledge arises. Sensations are prior to thought: thoughts build from individual sensations. For Hegel, positing sensations as prior to thought - or bare particulars prior to universality - fails the phenom- enological test. Every experience has an object, and each object has its determinations. There is no object that is not determined to be what it is. Explicating these determinations is the task of thinking. To aspire to get outside thought is self-defeating. It amounts to wanting experience without an object. But experience always has an object that is consti- tuted in some way. If thinking asks "What is it to be a simple idea?" it finds no answer. What is purely particular lacks determination or form. What lacks form lacks the content that enables us to say what it is. A pseudo-concept has no power of expression. Locke's simple ideas of Red or Round are revealed by Hegel as the bare particulars - This/Here/ Now - that vanish into nothing. We only experience "this thing as red or round." Simple ideas are falsified by this phenomenological fact. What Heidegger calls the as-structure of perception corresponds to Hegel's mediation. Even primitive awareness is mediated. The as-structure is fundamental to meaning - no experience is cordoned off from it. Philoso- phy has to set aside single sensations - and bundles of sensations - to get to experience of any kind. Getting outside thinking assumes that pure form can be separated from pure content. The drive to separate form from content, the factor- ing instinct, propels philosophy into the dogmas. The view that sensing is prior to any input from thought is an idea lodged deep in modern thought. It is not set aside easily. Getting outside thought seems to guar- antee that philosophy will not slip back into dogmatism. Getting outside thought defines mainstream empiricism: what is essential is external to mind (the in-itself); what is relative to mind (for-us) is inessential. The alternative view - that sensing occurs within the determinations of thought, as do all objects of experience - seems to abandon truth and objectivity: only if sensations lie outside thought do they signify what is purely objective. The dogmas of empiricism identified by Quine and Davidson arise when philosophy splits what is purely subjective from</page><page sequence="16">362 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY the purely objective. Situating sensing as external to thought guarantees that the dogmas of empiricism are lining up. This Midas curse ensures that thought makes relative whatever it touches. In Hegel's account, original experience has an object. The objects of perception are things - not sensations. It is revealing that this shocks skeptical ears. Understanding does not collect simple ideas into things: perception is inseparable from things, and things are inseparable from their properties. To perceive is to perceive something as something. Hegel shows that philosophy cannot get to things unless it begins with them. There are no simple ideas; simple idea is a pseudo-concept. Simple idea is a bad abstraction from property, a shadow of property. Only by beginning with things can philosophy develop the subsequent categories of knowledge, thus achieving empiricism's original goal. Subsequent categories cannot develop out of simple sensations; they simply replace them. A thing is defined by its properties, not by simple ideas: properties are not simple ideas. Development requires mediation from the start; what is deemed purely particular lacks mediation. The differences between Locke and Hegel extend farther. For Locke, sensa- tions cannot be doubted; for Hegel, individual sensations are mythical. Perception has meaning but is far from certain; perceptions of things are deceptive when considered as a way of knowing; they point to the need for understanding that goes beyond "how things appear." By rejecting sensations as a false start and turning to perception of things, Hegel practices empiricism without the dogmas. Things are in the world. So is consciousness. Getting to the world is never an issue for experience. Getting to the truth is the issue. Whether a description is subjective is beside the point; we want to know if it is true. Certainty awaits the outcome of reflection that works through experience to ar- rive at knowledge. Knowledge is the most developed and sounded out form of experience: the more subjective, the more objective. The process of working toward knowledge cannot begin until individual sensations, bare particulars, are dismissed.18 Hegel shares empiricism's rejection of dogmatism but not its diagnosis. Every experience has an object, and every object is determined in some way. External reflection is one stage of knowing the world. The external reflection embodied in perception differs from factoring philosophy. Ex- ternal reflection is the minimal determination of perceptual experience. Getting outside thought motivates factoring. Factoring separates what is for-us from what is in-itself. It assumes that what is for-us is subjective or relative; what is in-itself is objective or true. Locke holds fast to this logic; subsequent categories replicate a splitting that cannot be brought together. The concepts of mainstream empiricism replace one another;</page><page sequence="17">HEGEL'S CRITIQUE OF LOCKE'S SIMPLE IDEAS 363 they do not develop out of earlier concepts. Proper philosophy, in Hegel's view, develops subsequent categories from more basic determinations. Pseudo-concepts cannot be developed; they can only be seen through and abandoned. For Locke, the thing is a collection of atomistic sensations. Each simple idea is external to the next. The thing is later defined as a substance constituted by qualities either primary - how the thing is in- itself- or secondary - how the thing is for-us.19 As the further categories appear, the pattern repeats: the essence of the substance is either nominal (for-us) or real (in-itself) but ultimately unknowable. Stuck in a defec- tive picture of the world due to its defective concepts, empiricism cannot advance to what is in and for-itself, that is, true. Wariness of thinking sends philosophy back to the dogmas and to the conclusion that the world is unknowable. The mistrust of thinking does not permit mainstream empiricism to recognize the defect of sensations as the building blocks of experience because there must be "thought-free sensations" if knowledge is to be possible. Mainstream empiricism adheres to the dogma that being "distortion-free" requires being "thought-free." For Hegel, philosophy's task is to sound out the limits inherent in forms of experience and reflection due to the shortcomings of the concepts involved. Attention to concepts is suppressed when thinking is dubbed the obstacle to getting at the world.20 We do not think about simple ideas because supposedly they are prior to thinking. Being a distinction gets linked to the mind's activity, which mistrust of thinking sees as per se falsifying. What is sensed presumably lies outside the mind's activity, and what it means cannot change. The purely in-itself goes untouched by the purely for-us. As further topics arise, philosophy faces one impasse after another. If simple ideas are atomistic, reflection scrambles to account for the oneness of things, the causal connections between things, the endur- ing existence of things, and the essence of things. These basic features of the world are not given in simple ideas, so they must be added by mind. The familiar crises of empiricism are embedded in the picture of the world that underlies factoring. Factoring separates what exists only together. Things exist. A property exists as belonging to a thing. We see the red of the rose or hear the cry of a bird. Factoring is not checked by these truths of existence; the property is separated from the thing as if it could stand alone. Getting to recognizable experience from these presuppositions means that skeptical conclusions are unavoidable. Quine calls things "posits" or "convenient intermediaries" constructed from sensations thrust on mind and employed like tools in practical ways (1953, 44).21 Things are useful constructs, but they are not given in perception. What is given are the individual cues or blind thrusts of sensations. A wedge is driven between experience, where things are self-evident, and the analysis, which deems things to be useful, fictions.22</page><page sequence="18">364 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Factoring blocks access to the world. The promise to restore philosophy to experience stalls before recognizable experience begins to be grasped. Hegelian Conclusion The lessons drawn from the failure of simple ideas are several: (1) The notion of purely immediate contact between mind and its object fails. Single sensations are not perceived. Analysis cannot whittle experience down to bare particulars. (2) The factoring that generates simple ideas presupposes the separa- bility of mind and its objects, so that "thought-free" or unmediated first contact can occur in sensation. The failure of first contact demonstrates the inseparability of consciousness and its objects. Mind is in the world, not alongside it or separable from it. The activities of mind - perceiving, understanding, imagining, remembering - do not have to find a way into the world. They are ways of being in the world.23 Questions that presuppose unmediated contact have no standing in experience-based philosophy. To ask what arises solely from mind or solely from outside mind is to pose pseudo-questions, the presuppositions of which have been refuted. (3) Factoring presupposes unmediated contact. It situates mind out- side its object in order to determine the origin of what, in actuality, exists only together. Trying to get outside mind dispatches a fleet of impossible questions, such as "How do we get to words?" "How do we get to concepts?" "How do we get to universais or necessity?" These questions presuppose the unmediated contact of mind and world. Experience-based philosophy realizes that it is impossible to separate what exists together. What the questions presuppose is false. (4) Factoring splits the purely subjective from the purely objective, what follows from the mind's activity from what precedes the mind's activity. Useful distinctions harden into dogmatic oppositions when drafted into factoring. Distinctions between internal/external, passive/ active, original/subsequent, constrained/spontaneous, correspondence/ coherence, dependent/independent, relative/absolute, immediate/medi- ate, discovered/constructed, and in-itself/for-us are configured along the false split between the purely objective and purely subjective. Instead of opening up experience, these splits condemn us to the same skepti- cal outcome. When distinctions are freed from faulty phenomenology, the question of origin does not arise. Concepts are not added by mind; concepts grasp forms that are always already there in experience.24 (5) Experience-based philosophy takes a different shape than factor- ing. The drive to get free of mind and thinking is replaced by attention</page><page sequence="19">HEGEL'S CRITIQUE OF LOCKE'S SIMPLE IDEAS 365 to the concepts or distinctions of experience. Concepts are not prior to experience or subsequent to sensation. Concepts are the form of objec- tivity, and they develop as initial experience gives way to progressively more determinate experience. (6) Experience-based philosophy replaces foundations as the origin of analysis with experience as the origin and with comprehension of initial experience as the outcome of analysis. The high point of certainty is not the foundation. Hegel's system is circular: certainty emerges from analysis and the outcome reveals the grounds of initial experience. What emerges from analysis is what initial experience presupposes: Hegelian science posits the presupposition. (7) For factoring philosophy, the more objective is less subjective. A more informed empiricism finds that things understood are more objec- tive than things perceived. Good analysis penetrates reality. In short, the more subjective is the more objective, as strange as it sounds to modern ears. Initial experience is most sketchy. The outcome of analysis is most concrete. Mainstream empiricism is marred by dogmas that spring from well- founded worries about bias or anthropomorphism that are misconceived as worries about subjectivity per se. Worry about subjectivity itself drives the factoring philosophy, where the discourse of subjective versus objec- tive has usurped the discourse of truth. In factoring philosophy, doubt is pervasive and intractable. In phenomenology, by contrast, doubt is specific and tied to particular kinds of experience: Hegel calls the phe- nomenological route "the highway of despair." The worry is not whether truth is found or constructed. The worry is whether one's claims are true or not. Doubts arise when one experience reaches its limit and posits the need for a more determinate experience. Philosophy does not have to search for the origin of necessity: all experience takes a particular form and what determines experience is its characteristic necessity. The question is whether the necessity achieved in experience satisfies the human desire to know the truth of what is. Creighton University NOTES 1. Empiricism takes many forms. This paper will focus on Hegel's response to Locke and, by implication, Hume. I leave Berkeley to the side. Berkeley's critique of abstract ideas anticipates Hegel's phenomenological criticism of empiricism in part but is hindered by the view that thought finds truth.</page><page sequence="20">366 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY 2. Hegel takes Locke as the systematic expression of Francis Bacon's empiricism: "If Bacon made sensuous Being to be the truth, Locke . . . showed that we obtained the universal, the true, from experience" (Hegel 1974, 295). 3. Sensing is often equated with perceiving. Hegel (1977) distinguishes them in chapters 1 and 2. This paper follows Hegel's usage, where the objects of sensing are simple ideas and the objects of perception are things. 4. Hegel derives this account of empiricism from his reading of Locke. See Hegel 1974, 296. 5. "This is the philosophy of Locke, in which there is no trace of specula- tion. The great end of Philosophy, which is to know the truth, is in it sought to be attained in an empiric way. . . . [W]hether these thoughts . . . have truth in and for themselves, is not present at all" (Hegel 1974, 310). For Hegel, the object of philosophy is the concepts that unfold in experience. Locke posits sensation outside thought, and all concepts are subsequent to sensing. 6. One way that Hegel expresses this critical observation is as follows: "According to Locke therefore thought itself is not the essence of the soul, but one of its powers and manifestations" (1974, 305). In factoring out thought from sensation, Locke factors the purely passive, receptivity, from the work of the mind (understanding). By contrast, Hegel writes, "But sensuous perception and recollection are thought, and thought is truth" (ibid.). 7. "The Whence, the only important point to Locke, does not exhaust the whole question. The interest of the content in and for itself wholly disappears when that position is taken up" (ibid., 312). 8. Donald Davidson arrives at this conclusion seemingly without any help from Hegel. See Davidson 2001, 183-98. 9. Yet that is precisely Locke's picture. Hegel writes, "[T]he universal as such, the idea of species, is, according to Locke, merely a product of our mind, which is not itself objective" (1974, 308). 10. "It is a mistake to assume that, first of all, there are objects which form the content of our representations, and then our subjective activity comes in afterwards to form concepts of them" (Hegel 1991, Addition 2 to #163, 241). This is the mistake that results in Locke's notion of nominal essences. 11. Hegel 1974, 305, quotes Locke on this point. 12. In this quote Locke appeals to God, as Descartes does, to secure epistemic foundations. 13. Hegel presents the three paradigmatic attitudes toward objectivity in the "Preliminary Conception" of the Encyclopedia Logic (1991). 14. This was already the lesson of Chapter 1 of the Phenomenology . See Schüler 2008. 15. Anscombe writes, "Such views are based on the unconscious assump- tion - which we have seen in Locke - that one can identify a thing without identifying it as a such-and-such - or that if one cannot do this, this is because</page><page sequence="21">HEGEL'S CRITIQUE OF LOCKE'S SIMPLE IDEAS 367 we are incapable of conceiving substance except as having some qualities. The thing, then, that is taken to be postulated becomes a thoroughly mysterious entity which in itself has no characteristics: a 'somewhat we know not whať which is postulated as underlying the characteristics that it is said to 'have' and which alone enable us to conceive it" (1961, 10-11]. See also Heidegger 2010, section #32, "Understanding and Interpretation," 144-49. Hegel makes the same point as Anscombe: "To say that species are nothing in themselves, that the universal is not the essential reality of nature, that its implicit ex- istence is not the object of thought, is tantamount to saying that we do not know real existence" (1974, 309). 16. This section draws from Schüler 2008. 17. This account of perception draws from Schüler 1983. 18. Hegel calls Locke's notion of getting at the truth "by abstraction from experience and sensuous perception . . . utterly false" (1974, 295). 19. The requirement to separate the implicit (in-itself) from the relative (for- us) leads Locke into contradiction. Primary qualities are both sensed (for-us) and independent of consciousness. Hegel observes, "In Locke, a difference here appears between the implicit and being 'for-another,' in which he declares the moment of 'for-another' to be unreal - and yet he sees all truth in the relation of 'for-another' only" (ibid., 308). 20. By not recognizing that simple ideas involve concepts, Locke misses the basic task of philosophy. "The question whether these determinations of the infinite, of substance, etc. are in and for themselves true, is quite lost sight of" (ibid., 311). 2 1 . That way of thinking participates in the dogma of the conceptual scheme, as Quine's student Donald Davidson pointed out in "On the Very Idea of a Con- ceptual Scheme" (2001). 22. For an extreme case of this split, see Moore 1959. 23. Being-in-the-world is the first existential or structure of Dasein . On knowing as a way of being in the world, see Heidegger 2010, 59-62. 24. "It is just as one-sided to represent analysis as though there were nothing in the subject matter that was not imported into it, as it is one-sided to suppose that the resulting determinations are merely extracted from it" (Hegel 1969, 788).
