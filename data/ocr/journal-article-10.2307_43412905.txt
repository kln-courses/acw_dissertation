<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTINCTIVE BEHAVIOUR AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE SCARABiEID^E By E. S. RUSSELL, O.B.E., D.Sc., F.L.S. In order to make clear the main characteristics of instinctive be- haviour I propose to take as a typical example the behaviour of the dung beetles of the genus Scarabœus. Their behaviour has been very fully and carefully observed, first by Fabre over a period of nearly forty years, and later by R. Heymons and H. von Lengerken (1929), who have added to, corrected, but in the main confirmed Fabre's results. The scarab is diurnal in its activity, a creature of warmth and the south, at its liveliest in the hot sun and not occurring in colder climates. In the evening it goes to ground, not to emerge again till the morning warms up. It is primarily the scent of dung that rouses it to activity. Fabre describes vividly how the deposit of mule or sheep dung attracts to it all the scarabs in the vicinity, both those that are wandering around, and those that are buried in the sand near by. Only the scent of dung, perceived through the lamellated antennae and, when near, through the maxillary palps, arouses the attention of the scarabs and provokes a search for this their exclusive food. They seek it with widely spread antennae and when close go straight towards it. The smell of dung is, in fact, the one sensory perception that has food meaning or food " valence " for the dung-beetles in general. Our common Geotrupes behaves just like Scarabœus, scenting the breeze for a whiff of dung. To leeward of the dung it may smell it even 4 metres away ; to windward it must be within about 50 cm. to perceive the smell (Warnke, 1931). It has been shown by Warnke that ammonia, skatol and indol, in that order, exercise a similar attraction to dung, of which they are, of course, constituents. In the South of France and in Italy, where the observations of Fabre and the two German investigators were made, the scarabs utilise for food the dung of various, chiefly herbivorous, mammals- sheep, cow, horse, mule and others ; even human excrement is 12</page><page sequence="2">CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTINCTIVE BEHAVIOUR 13 used. According to Heymons and von Lengerken sheep dung is the favourite, especially when fresh and moist. It is characteristic of the scarabs that they do not, or very rarely, eat the dung on the spot, though they may suck moisture from it. Their instinctive drive is to make it up into balls which they hastily roll away and bury. By so doing they act as efficient scavengers ; the sanitary value of their operations in the crowded lands of the East has been especially emphasised by Hingston (1923). The process of shaping the ball is a very interesting one. The ball does not owe its spherical shape to the fact that it is trundled for some considerable distance over the ground ; it is moulded into a sphere on the spot, before it is moved. Two methods are employed according as the material is sheep dung or cow dung. With the first, a pellet of dung is seized and held throughout the whole oper- ation, the beetle pulls towards it another pellet, splits off a piece and moulds it to the first, working the whole mass into a sphere. This process is repeated several times, so that the final product is a large ball containing in its centre the original pellet, surrounded by concentric layers of dung derived from other pellets and moulded over the first. The ball is not rotated during these manipulations ; it is rounded and smoothed off below by pushing the head in from all sides. If the ball is made from a cow pat, the scarab proceeds in a different way. Delving in with its head and scratching out with its fore legs, it moulds near the edge of the pat a hemisphere of dung, surrounded by a circular rim. It then cuts in under and all round the half-formed sphere, using its wedge-Kke head, so com- pleting the sphere, and finally cutting it free from the pat. The ball is completely shaped before it is rolled away. In addition to the wedge-shaped head, Nature has provided the tools for the job of rounding off the ball in the specialised shape and structure of the middle and hind pairs of legs. The latter, particularly, are very long and curved. In both, but especially in the hind pair, the femur has a sharp edge on its posterior margin, hollowed out in a flat curve. This acts as a scraper, while the legs move over and around the surface of the growing ball. Each pair of legs may be likened to a pair of callipers with bent arms, and when they are extended they cover a hemispherical space of a definite size. It is this natural span that normally determines the size of the ball, for when the growth of the ball has stretched its legs to their full extent the beetle reaches the normal terminus or end-state of its labours and ceases its modelling work. Each different species has its own characteristic mean size of ball, corresponding to the span</page><page sequence="3">14 SCIENCE PROGRESS of its legs. But circumstances or, better expressed, the " situation," may bring it about that the scarab rests content with a smaller ball than normal or even one that is irregularly shaped. This is liable to happen if there are many competitors working near by, or if the dung is hard and dry. Sometimes they will roll away a single pellet of sheep's dung, or a lump composed of a number of pellets, without moulding them into a ball. In their collecting they always give the impression of haste, as if to get their supply safely away as soon as possible from their neighbours. The domin- ating impulse is to move a supply of dung away from the heap and bury it some distance off. Normally and typically the dung is first moulded into a ball, which can be readily rolled away, but on occasion they may move away and bury even a shapeless piece of dried dung. An instance is described by Heymons and von Lenger- ken (pp. 536-7). A soarab, coming across a small piece of dry dung that could not be shaped into a ball, tried hard to remove it, propelling it a little way, using not only its hind legs in the usual manner but also pushing it with its head and finally burying it at no great distance. There is, it will be seen, a fair amount of vari- ation of the rolling and burying routine, in response to varying circumstance. The biological purposes served by the hasty transport and burying of the ball appear to be its rescue from the competing dung beetles of several kinds which swarm to the feast, and the protection of the ball from drying up in the hot sun. In rolling the food ball away for future consumption the scarab, which may be either a male or a female, normally progresses back- wards, propelling the ball along the ground by strokes delivered by its mid and hind legs. It usually buries the ball fairly near by, but may go as far as 8-15 metres before interring itģ In its course it often comes up against obstacles and shows great persistence in trying to overcome them, working at the task for hours. If the ball gets stuck in vegetátion the scarab may get under it and heave ; if the ball is up against an impassable obstacle or falls into a hole from which it cannot be retrieved, the beetle may bury it where it lies. Scarabs in a terrarium try for hours to push the ball through the glass wall - an obstacle of which they have no experience in natural conditions. In general, according to Heymons and von Lengerken, Scarabseus, while persistent in its efforts, shows little understanding of the obstacle-situations which it encounters, and its success in circumventing them is largely a matter of chance. Both Fabre and Hingston (1928), however, have shown that Scara - bseus and the allied genus Oymnopleurus can sometimes cope effect-</page><page sequence="4">CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTINCTIVE BEHAVIOUR 15 ively with unusual difficulties, as when the experimenter pins down their ball to the ground or suspends it just above their head. It is clear that the dung beetles show that important characteristic of behaviour which Lloyd Morgan called " persistency with varied effort," and to which Stout (1913) often refers in his masterly account of instinct from the psychological point of view. Of Oymnopleurus , which is also a roller of balls, Hingston (1923) in India has made the interesting observation that they maintain unswervingly a constant direction in moving their ball away from the source of dung ; each beetle, or .more usually pair • of beetles, persists in the direction in which it has set out, and if diverted from its course by the observer reverts unerringly to it. The result appears to be a maximal radial dispersion of the balls. While trundling its ball away, the scarab is frequently attacked by one of its own kind, which tries to take possession of the ball. Fights arise only in this way, and they take place only between beetles of the same sex, never between a male and a female. When approached by another scarab, the owner of the ball, holding on to it, smells the oncomer with its antennae, especially at the dorsal integument in front of the mesothorax, and if it is of the same sex fights and, if possible, repels it. Sex is recognised by smell. If a female rolling a ball is approached by a male she recognises him as such and leaves the ball for him to roll, following close behind it. A female finding a male trundling a ball follows him at a distance of 2-3 cm. ; he may stop and smell at her. Sometimes she sits on the ball, or she may walk forward holding on to it, appearing thus to help him. But according to Heymons and von Lengerken there is little or no mutual aid between the pair. It is the ball that the female is interested in, for if it is taken from him she ceases to follow ; if the male is removed, the female takes possession of, and trundles, the ball. The dung sphere is the only bond between them, while they are engaged in food-getting activities. Scarabœus does not know " its own " ball and will readily accept any other's, even if it be of a different size from its own. The ball is recognised solely by its smell. The beetle will accept balls made of other material, provided they smell of dung. For example, Heymons and von Lengerken found that while the scarab would pay no attention to suitably sized balls composed of dried fragments of Posidonia (a marine plant allied to Zostera or eel-grass), if these balls were smeared with fresh dung the beetle would roll them away and bury them. The scarab might stop on the way and smell the ball all over until it came across the dung smear, when it would resume its task. Leaden bullets sewn up in cloth and smeared</page><page sequence="5">16 SCIENCE PROGRESS with dung were also accepted and rolled away, with difficulty ; sometimes they were buried, A chestnut which had been in contact with dung was treated in the same way, and so were little pieces of wood similarly contaminated. The beetles naturally had great difficulty iń rolling the bits of wood, and sometimes used the alter- native method of shoving them along with their head - as did the beetle that tackled a piece of dried dung (p. 14 above). While the burying of the ball can be carried out independently by a single male or female, it is usual for a pair to be concerned, when the male does the digging, while the female sits on the ball or rests near by. If the female is removed, the male pays no attention but goes on burying. If the male is taken away, the female takes charge of the ball and buries it either on the spot or some distance away. If the ball is removed, male and female go off separately to look for more dung. The bond between male and female is there- fore very slight, and it is not individual, any male serving as tem- porary partner for any female. There are two methods of burying the ball ; either a hole is dug alongside and the ball rolled into it, or the soil is excavated directly below it so that it sinks into the burrow. The completed burrow is a curved tube which may extend a considerable distance below ground. The dung ball is thus kept fresh and moist, and, according to Heymons and von Lengerken, free from fungal growths. After the ball is buried, it is eaten up by its owner or owners. Such in brief is the story of the food-getting and food-storing activities of Scarabœus. But dung balls are also made and buried for another biological purpose, the provision of food for the larva. These balls look exactly the same as the food balls, but they are prepared, rolled away and buried by the female alone. (They do not contain an egg, as is sometimes stated by earlier writers, including Stout.) They are made of sheep dung exclusively, if this is available. The burrows constructed for their reception differ from the food burrow in that the female hollows out at the bottom a large smooth- walled chamber, in which she reshapes the ball into a pear-shaped structure destined to receive her egg and to provide nutriment for the developing larva. As already indicated, the " pear " is normally composed of sheep dung, but this is not absolutely essential, for it has been noted by Heymons and von Lengerken (p. 585) that a female 8 . laticollis, having at her disposal only cow dung, constructed the larval pear of this material and the larva developed successfully. The construction of the pear has been described by Fabre (V). Sometimes the female dispenses with the shaping of a ball and buries</page><page sequence="6">CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTINCTIVE BEHAVIOUR 17 on the spot a mass of soft sheep's dung, constructing a brood chamber and shaping the pear directly from the shapeless heap. Normally, however, the pear is modelled in the brood chamber from the ball, retaining on its surface the sand and earth which the ball has picked up while being rolled over the ground. Occasionally the female breaks up the ball into fragments and refashions the pear from these, when the pear has a smooth surface. The pear at first is spherical, then the female hollows out on top a shallow crater sur- rounded by a turned-over rim. The rim is later extended and closed in to form H the narrow end of the pear, enclosing a small chamber in which the egg has already been laid. The wall of the egg-chamber is carefully smoothed ; the large egg hangs from the top, which has been closed by a rather loosely constructed stopper, probably allowing some access of air. The kneaded outer surface of the pear .is hard, forming a sort of shell, which protects the inner mass of dung from drying up. The completed pear, which always Stands vertically and does not lie on its side, as Fabre supposed, bears a curious resemblance, functionally, to the egg of a bird, as Fabre was not slow to point out. " The pear of Scarabaeus," he wrote, " can be compared with a hen's egg. Its shell is the hardened outer layer which prevents too rapid desiccation ; its nutritive store, its yellow or yolk, is the noble ball protected by its rind ; its air- chamber the terminal cell, the nest in which lies the egg bathed all round by air " (V, p. 40). The female never eats any part of the pear, and when she has finished making it she leaves the burrow and collects material for another pear. The female is persistent in her task of making the burrow and provisioning it. Four times Fabre destroyed the burrow destined for the pear, and four times she re-made it, re-burying the ball of dung or the half-formed pear. But when she has completed her work and laid her egg, the pear loses all meaning or valence for her ; if it is exhumed and laid beside her she pays no attention to it but departs. The immediate goal or terminus of her work has been reached and she passes on to the next task. As Fabre aptly puts it, speaking of instinct in general, " the work to be done is everything, the work done no longer exists " (V, p. 102). Scarabseus lays only a few (about 6) eggs, which in S. sacer measure on the average 8-2 x 4-7 mm. They are provisioned with yolk through physiological means, and, as we have seen, a further supply of food is provided by the instinctive activity of the mother, which the emerging larva finds at its door. The larva when it is hatched begins to feed on this rich store, and works its way steadily downwards until it has devoured all the dung within the hardened c</page><page sequence="7">18 SCIENCE PROGRESS rind, replacing it gradually with its own abundant excrement. It has the curious and useful habit of plastering up cracks or holes in the surface of the pear, whether these are caused by small dung beetles (Onthophagus or Aphodius) which have remained hidden in the dung, or gaps produced artificially by the experimenter. First it reconnoitres the hole with its head, then turns round and applies with its trowel-like hind end its own excrement to the edges and gradually cements up the hole. It can mend quite large holes, such for instance as are made by cutting off the pointed end of the pear. This repair work serves the useful purpose of presenting the contents of the pear from drying up, a danger which is always present during the summer months when larval and nymphal development is pro- ceeding and to which the developing scarab often succumbs. For emergence the nymph has to await the autumn rains of the South, which soften the ground and the hardened walls of the pear and permit the fully formed beetle to struggle up to the surface. The beetle may be ready to emerge in August, but usually has to await the rains that come at the end of September. When their free life begins they soon start to make and roll their food-balls, doing this perfectly from the first go off. So the cycle of behaviour comes full circle again. This brief account of the behaviour cycle in Scarabœus enables us to form some idea of the essential characteristics of instinctive behaviour, both psychological and biological. We may note first the extreme simplicity and specialisation of the psychological activ- ities involved. The adult scarab seeking food has the specialised " disposition " to pay attention to one specific scent only, that of dung, and to carry out a specific series of actions, comprising the moulding of a ball of dung, its transport and inhumation in a burrow. This perception-action disposition is inborn, and owes nothing to previous experience or learning ; it appears at a definite stage of the life-cycle, ready to function. The scent of dung to which the scarab is predisposed to attend is normally adequate as indicative of the proper material from which to mould its balls, though in excep- tional circumstances it may lead the scarab astray, as when it rolls and buries objects that are merely smeared with dung. The course of action which the smell of dung excites is fairly stereotyped, but it is capable of modification according to the sensed or perceived situation. Thus the process of ball-making may be omitted or abridged, if the dung is too hard or competitors are too numerous. But the general formula or action is adhered to - removal of a portion of dung, usually in the shape of a ball, and its burial some way off. It is important to note that this course of</page><page sequence="8">CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTINCTIVE BEHAVIOUR 19 action is actively pursued till its successive goals are reached ; the scarab persists in its work till the ball is made ; it struggles to roll the ball over or round obstacles ; its action is persistent with varied effort. This is an important characteristic of all behaviour, and it implies psychological factors. It is often said that instinctive behaviour is blind, that the in- stinctive animal has no foreknowledge at all of the goal to which its actions are directed. There is a great deal of truth in this assertion. We have no reason to think that the scarab has a prior notion of what it is about in making and rolling its food-ball, still less a definite plan of action thought out beforehand. Nor can we sup- pose that in selecting special material for its larval pear, moulding it into a ball, constructing a special brood chamber and therein forming the pear so nicely adapted for the welfare of the larva, the female has in mind the biological purpose of her acts, which is the provision of suitable conditions for the development of her offspring - of which she can have no knowledge. It is sufficient to suppose that she has an inborn and specific impulse or drive to carry out certain acts in a certain order, without knowledge of the ultimate end or purpose of these actions. But it would be a mistake to think that her actions are completely blind, automatic and mechanical. There must be some forward-looking element in her behaviour, pointing towards the immediate goal, terminus or end-state of the action actually in progress ; there must also be some consciousness, however dim, that her action has, or has not, reached its immediate goal ; otherwise it would be impossible to explain why her action shows persistency till the goal is reached and then ceases. But the dung beetle's behaviour is certainly not purposive in the human sense. The late Prof. G. F. Stout, in his analysis of instinct from the psychological point of view (1913), treats instinct as a form of perceptual process, thus marking it off as being on a lower level than the ideational and overtly purposive activity char- acteristic of man, and of man alone. This is a fundamental and generally accepted point, of crucial importance for the proper inter- pretation of animal behaviour. " The vast interval," he writes, " which separates human achievements, so far as they depend on human intelligence, from animal achievements, as far as they depend on animal intelligence, is connected with the distinction between perceptual and ideational process. Animal activities are, in the main, either purely perceptual, or, in so far as they involve ideas, these ideas only serve to prompt and guide an action in its actual execution. On the other hand, man constructs ť in his hqad,' by means of trains of ideas, schemes of action before he begins to carry</page><page sequence="9">20 SCIENCE PROGRESS them out. He can cross a bridge ideally before he comes to it actually " (pp. 387-8). The contrast between animal and human behaviour is essentially that between impulsive or hormic behaviour guided by immediate perception and behaviour guided by ideas which are goals of action. Animals are in the main creatures of impulse. Furthermore, behaviour on the perceptual level is always " purely and immediately practical in its operation . . . The theoretical question Why ? has no existence for the merely perceptual con- sciousness " (p. 447). The instinctive animal " knows how " to act in a given normal situation, it does not know why it should so act. Its "knowledge" is practical - and effective - it is not theoretical. As Spaier (1930) aptly puts it, instinctive behaviour is a matter of " savoir-faire " not of " connaissance." Animal behaviour therefore should not be interpreted in terms of conscious purpose, of planned and foresightful action, such as human beings carry out ; to do so is to fall into a. gross anthropomorphic error. But much of our own behaviour, as for instance in playing tennis or dodging the traffic, takes place on the perceptual plane of direct " knowing-doing," and thus gives us an insight into the nature of perceptual process, of which instinctive behaviour is a form. Animals live a life of immediacy and impulse to which the non- intellectual part of our own experience as acting subjects gives us a valuable clue. It is worth while noting that behaviour on the perceptual level, which is normally directive towards a biologically useful end-state, without explicit foreknowledge of it as end, is the rule in Nature, and consciously purposive action the exception, for all animals exhibit this form of behaviour, and only man rises to the ideational or conceptual level, and that not consistently or continuously. Furthermore, directiveness towards biological ends is characteristic of organic activities in general (Russell, 1945) and is basic to be- haviour at both levels. Regarded from a biological point of view, the behaviour of the scarabs is clearly directive towards goals related to the biological ends of self-maintenance, reproduction and development. Guided by a specific scent, the scarab seeks out for nourishment the food which is suitable to it, protecting it from desiccation by rolling it away and burying it ; it recognises its mate by smell and performs the necessary act of copulation ; it amasses food for the nourishment of its descendants, stores it in a burrow in a shape convenient for the hatching larva, continuing thus by behavioural means the cellular activities which have produced and provisioned the egg ;</page><page sequence="10">CHARACTERISTICS OF INSTINCTIVE BEHAVIOUR 21 the growing larva eats the food provided for it, conserving it by- repairing breaches in the wall of its domicile by the use of its own exerement. All these things the scarab does without knowledge of the biological purpose of its acts ; its behaviour is directive, like the morphogenetic and physiological activities of its cells, but none of these activities is purposive in the psychological sense. Its be- haviour is integrated with, and forms an essential link in, the cycle of activities which constitute its life. We have noted that the behaviour of Scarabœus is highly special- ised both on the perceptive and the executive side. Biologically regarded, this behavioural specialisation is just one part or aspect of the integral specialisation in form and function of the scarab as a living whole. Scarabœus is essentially a diurnal Lamellicorn beetle which utilises dung in a particular way, adjusted to the climatic conditions in which it lives. Its bodily structure is related closely to its manner of behaviour. I have mentioned its wedge- shaped head, and the combined callipers and scrapers formed by its middle and hind legs, which facilitate the moulding of the ball ; to which it may be added that the fore legs are efficient excavating tools. Internal organisation also is related to the dung-eating habit. Dung is not a very nutritious substance, having passed already through one alimentary canal ; great quantities of it are therefore required for a meal. Fabre found that Scarabœus would eat steadily for at least 12 hours, consuming in that time about its own volume of dung, and producing a faecal cord nearly 3 metres in length (V, pp. 24-5). In correlation with the great amount that has to be ingested and dealt with, the dung-beetles in general have an exceptionally long intestine. According to Henneguy (1904, p. 68), the length of the digestive tube in coprophagous Lamellicorns is on the average 10-19 times that of the body, as against 3-7 times in phytophagous members of the group. The coprophagous Lamellicorns are a very extensive and widely distributed family, comprising no less than 17 sub-families (Kolbe, 1905), several of which are very rich in species. A few of them Uve on and store carrion, and one or two feed on and store leaves and shoots, but the great majority depend entirely on dung for food for themselves and their offspring. They show a considerable diversity in the way in which they utilise dung for these two pur- poses, being specialised in their behaviour in several different direc- tions. Some small forms, such as the Troginse and the Aphodiinse, simply feed on the dung as they find it, and lay their eggs in it, making only this general provision for their offspring. Onthophagus also feeds directly on the dung, without storing it for future con-</page><page sequence="11">22 SCIENCE PROGRESS sumption, but it makes quite an elaborate burrow directly under the dung, provided with lateral and terminal brood chambers. Its behaviour has been studied by Burmeister (1930), who shows how male and female collaborate in the excavation and provisioning of the burrow ; the female does the work of excavation, while the male clears away the " spoil " through a special tunnel leading to the open ; he then digs out dung from the middle of the heap and brings it to the female, who drags it down the burrow and packs it into the brood chambers which she has prepared. Many of the Geotrupinse, such as Geotrupes and Minotaur us, show similar reproductive behaviour, but also make food burrows beneath the dung. Copris , which, like the Geotrupinse, is crepus- cular in habit, stores a shapeless mass of dung for food in a cavity dug directly under the source of supply ; the brood chamber she makes is larger and well finished ; with the help of the male she provisions it with soft sheep dung, which she works first into a large ovoid mass then divides up into three or four pieces, fashioning each into an ovoid somewhat resembling the pear of Scarabseus and like it supplied with an egg-chamber and an egg. Unlike the female Scarabœus , she stays by her ovoids until the young beetles emerge, í a matter of four months, keeping the ovoids clear of mould and her- self repairing any cracks that appear. The female Copris is a good fashioner of dung, but neither she nor the male makes and rolls away balls of dung as does Scarabœus. They are probably incapable of fashioning and trundling a ball, for they lack the long curved callipers formed by the mid and hind legs of Scarabseus. The only ball-rollers among the dung-beetles are the Scarabaeinse, Gymno- pleurinse, Sisyphinse and the Canthoninse. They are all diurnal in their activity and they all possess the long curved legs necessary for ball-making and ball-rolling. REFERENCES Burmeister, F., Zts. Morph . Oekol. Tiere , 1930, 16, 559-647.
