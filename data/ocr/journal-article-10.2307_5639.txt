This book aims to reassess behavioural studies of chimpanzee social systems and, through comparison with human hunter-gatherer societies, to demon- strate the basically egalitarian nature of both. To achieve her aim Margaret Power attempts a synthesis of biological and social anthropology, drawing upon published accounts of human foraging societies and chimpanzees. What emerges, however, is just another example of how rarely a multidisciplinary approach is able to deliver the interesting and useful reappraisal we expect, or hope, to see. It does, however, offer insight into why this is so often the case. The author writes with great clarity, and readers with little or no familiarity with social anthropology will have no difficulty in following the train of her argument. As one reads, however, it becomes in- creasingly -obvious to any one with more than a passing knowledge of primate behaviour and/or biological field studies that there are gaps in Power's own experience and understanding, which lead her into fundamental errors of interpretation of the published literature. In order to argue that 'undisturbed' humans and chimpanzees have similar social systems, which - as a consequence of 'charismatic' as opposed to 'dominance-seeking' leaders, shared responsibility for infant care and sexual equality - are best de- scribed as egalitarian, the author has been obliged to explain considerable differences between this view and most published accounts of chimpanzee society. She does so by asserting that the major studies, by Goodall and Nishida and their co-workers, are fundamentally flawed, and that the behaviour of the animals is wholly unnatural as a result of the various forms of provisioning used in both. Despite the fact that the disruptive effects of the feeding regimes employed at Gombe have been well docu- mented and discussed with great frankness by the researchers, this is presented as an important new insight, overlooked until now. Whilst no-one could be comfortable with a claim that provisioning has had no effect on the behaviour recorded at Gombe and Mahale, Power makes some truly astonishing assertions, stating that dominance hierarchies, territorial monitoring and defence, male philopatry, intra-specific competition, hunting, infanticide, cannibalism, prolonged infancy, and developmental problems (among others) are a direct consequence of frustration brought about by supplementary feeding. There is no convincing explanation of how or why such high levels of frustration are caused by provisioning, nor why, if natural foods are as abundant as is claimed, animals did not avoid these negative situations by feeding elsewhere. Anyone who has watched chimpanzees will attest to the generally harmonious nature of their lives, but detailed studies reveal far more agonistic inter- actions than the casual observer notices. This book misses the point that agonistic interactions and aggression are not synonymous with violence; nor are they necessarily negative aspects of animals - or people - but become so only when the factors which act to moderate aggression fail to operate. However, consequent to her view that provisioning totally disrupted 'normal' chimpanzee behaviour at Gombe and Mahale, she dismisses almost all the evidence provided by these long-term studies of known individuals, and turns instead to early and opportunistic observations of chimpanzees, which she believes support her claims of egalitarianism in chimpanzee society. In doing so she displays her lack of experience of field observations: occasional and 'ad-lib' observations of unhabituated (and often unknown) animals can never provide reliable evidence for (or against) the complex relationships which make up primate social systems. Only through systematic studies of recognizable individuals, in known contexts, can the subtle patterns of domi- nance, cooperation and preference which charac- terize primate societies be demonstrated. This is precisely why the Gombe and Mahale studies took the direction which they did.</page><page sequence="2">801 Book Reviews Power is also selective in her use of 'natural' studies: no reference is made to later long-term studies (such as that of Christian Boesch, in the Tai Forest) which have avoided provisioning and yet do not make claims for egalitarianism, charismatic leadership and an absence of territorialism in chim- panzees, nor indeed, to the extremely aggressive attacks of resident (unprovisioned) chimpanzees on young animals released during rehabilitation programmes. In addition to her somewhat biased choice of 'natural' studies, Power lays unwarranted emphasis on the highly anthropomorphic style typical of early reports. Thus, descriptions of animals as 'carefree' or 'respectful of their elders' are taken as evidence for the decline of provisioned societies into violence and depravity, despite the fact that the absence of such phrases in later studies is more likely to reflect a change of approach on the part of the observers than changes in behaviour amongst the chimpanzees. Under the guise of 'close-reading' she also re-inter- prets observations to suit her own purposes; for example, when she presents Goodall's description of a (dominant) male finally mating with a receptive female 'through dogged persistence' as evidence of sexual coercion. In dismissing all territorial, dominant and ag- gressive behaviours as consequences of 'frustration' following provisioning, Power fails to provide any explanation of why such patterns of behaviour should arise if they are as wholly negative as she believes. Her comments on selection suggest she believes it to operate at the group, rather than individual level. No justification for this is provided, and it is not clear to me that she has understood the fundamental importance of this distinction, either to her argument or to biology in general. There are many other instances in which the author displays her incomplete grasp of the basics of biology and primatology (such as how biologists measure fitness); one of the most glaring is perhaps where she attempts to dismiss the case for male- male bonding in chimpanzees by pointing out that females are prevented from devoting time to social activities by the demands of motherhood: completely ignoring the fact that in most simian primates females form the social core of groups and maintain close ties with each other, motherhood notwithstanding. Thus, for anyone at all familiar with the primate literature this book will be less than convincing, and, if they were seeking for a deeper understanding of how non-human and human primate societies compare, a disappointment. Its main readership will almost certainly be social scientists, and I think it is most unfortunate that these readers are given no opportunity to judge for themselves, through the provision of the original data Power claims lends support to her arguments. The undoubted clarity of her writing and her continual re-iteration of her main point - however weakly supported by the facts - may well convince readers not themselves familiar with the original literature that she is right, both in her assessment of chimpanzee behaviour and in her dismissal of studies worth considerably more than her book acknowledges.
