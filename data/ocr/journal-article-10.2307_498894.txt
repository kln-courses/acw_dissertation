<plain_text><page sequence="1">120 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY EXCAVATIONS AT OLYNTHUS. PART I. THE NEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT, by George E. Mylonas. Pp. xvii-108; 2 color pls., 94 figs. The Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore, 1929. $7.50. The author of this book assisted Professor David M. Robinson in the excavation of this site in 1928. The chapters (with their pages) are: I. The Site (1-6); II. Architectural Remains (7-18); III. The Pottery (19-50); IV. Figurines (51-62); V. Celts (63-75); VI. The Smaller Finds (76-82); VII. Affinities with Other Sites (83-97). A Selected Bibliography and an Index follow. The Neolithic deposit was divided by two "burned levels" into three sub- periods. After the destruction of the third Neolithic settlement, the site remained unoccupied till historical times. Though no break is evidenced in the continuity of the Neolithic culture, few will admit that "the similarity of the finds proves that the same tribes occupied the site all the time." The houses were quadrangular with walls of sun-dried brick bedded on small stones, and roofed with reeds and branches, to judge by the scanty remains. Of especial interest is the Potter's Kiln, the earliest discovered on the mainland. The Neolithic pottery-represented by few complete vessels and numerous sherds-is hand-made and is classified under Monochrome, Incised, and Painted Wares. The Finer Monochrome Ware is subdivided into Burnished, Red-slipped, Black Polished (the finest pottery at Olynthus), and Unpolished. In the lowest stratum only Monochrome ware was found, and it averaged 93 per cent in strata II and III. A small vase is said to be the earliest zo6morphic vase yet discovered on the mainland. Of course, there are several points provocative of discussion. One may question the assumption that Painted preceded Incised ware, and the use of "freakish" and "weird" to designate handles. Binns and Fraser have shown that the black surface was not due to the application of carboniferous pigment (A.J.A., 1929, pp. 1-9). A pardonable enthusiasm has led the author to use superlatives and rather extravagant praise in describing some vases and sherds. The eight Neolithic figurines (of marble, stone, and clay) are assumed to repre- sent the earth-mother on the basis of the one anthropomorphic one (of clay), which may be female. The discussion of Neolithic celts from Olynthus and elsewhere is important. In the final chapter, the author discusses the civilization of the Neolithic Olyn- thians and their cultural and racial relations with Thessaly, Macedonia, Thrace, the Danube Valley, the Black Earth region, and Asia Minor. The results of the study are interesting, even if they.will not all meet with general acceptance. The first settlement antedates Troy I; floruit ca. 3000-2900 B.c. This Neolithic civili- zation had affinities particularly with Southeast Thessaly and the Black Earth region. The author is sure that the Neolithic Olynthians were not Indo-European because their religious ideas centered around a mother-goddess, as proved by the figurines, and because of the painted pottery. (A possible but precarious conclu- sion, since only one figurine was anthropomorphic and of indeterminate sex, and painted pottery was absent in stratum I and averaged only 3 per cent in the later periods ) The Early Helladic name Olynthus was transferred from near-by Agios Mamas to this site by Hellenic settlers. The criticisms are relatively few and chiefly concern theory and interpretation. The author sometimes uses a previously advanced hypothesis as a fact by which to prove a point, and the word "prove " is occasionally used where "may indicate" seems preferable. The title of Childe's work should appear on page 26. Reference to Blegen is omitted in connection with Nemean pottery (pp. 32, 88). Read "graphite" for "graffite" (pp. 49, 50, 105). The long note on Dikeli Tash (p. 44)</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 121 might better be placed on page 21, where this site is first mentioned. A map showing ErCsd and other sites would have greatly enhanced the work. The value of this work lies in its detailed description of the "finds." After all, an early and detailed presentation of the evidence from an excavation is the important thing, and this Dr. Mylonas has given us in this contribution to the study of Balkan Prehistory. J.
