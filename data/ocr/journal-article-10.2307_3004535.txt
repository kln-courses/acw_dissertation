Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1926. ix + 28o pp. Until recently, the student of social theory has been compelled to rely upon comparatively inaccessible sources for a knowledge of the mediaeval period, The more comprehensive works on the history of philosophy, and the first volume of Dunning's standard work on Political Theory have been of some assistance, as have also the best general treatises on mediaeval history, but illuminating inter- pretations of mediaeval social thought as a special object of inquiry have been lack- ing.

What this book tends to reveal, more clearly, perhaps, than any previous ac- count, is the general point of view and method of the social theorists of the Middle Ages. The earliest stage in the development of social thought of which we have knowledge may be said to be characterized by the attempt to render the world of experience intelligible through the agency of myth. The savage and the barbarian seek to make them- selves at home in their world by ascribing its less obvious phenomena to the will and activity of anthropomorphic deities. The so-called classical period found its guid- ance in the metaphysics of Plato, who, with his disciples, sought to discover the inner essences or qualities of things, by the apprehension of which one might attain a consistent attitude in the face of the complexities and riddles of the empirical world. On the other hand, the scholars, moralists, and statesmen of the Middle Ages attempted to discover and to formulate a comprehensive but unified body of moral law which should be con- sistent with the theological preconcep- tions of the times. It is the history of this attempt which Father Jarrell has described. Confronted with the diffi- culties and conflicts of the actual social world, the mediaeval student asked, What is the rule or moral principle which should determnine our conduct in this matter? It remained for a later generation of students to develop an indirect method of dealing with practical social and moral problems by investigating the natural forces and processes which determine what may be expected and what can be done in a certain type of contingency. The social thought of the Middle Ages, therefore, is not social science; it is historically ante- cedent to the development of the scientific method in application to social problems. To acquire an appreciative insight into these earlier groping movements which led ultimately to the development of modern social science is, however, prob- ably one of the best ways of arriving at an adequate understanding of the problems and demands of the scientific point of view. It should also be said that Father Jarrell's little book is valuable simply as history. Furthermore, so able an inter- pretation of the moral ideals and code of a period with reference to the economnic conditions is itself a contribution to social science. The place of moral rules and ideals in collective behavior and social control constitutes one of the important topics for scientific investigation. The book is arranged topically rather then chronologically; the nine chapters deal with such subjects as "Law," "Education," "Slavery," and "Prop- erty." The chapter on "Christendom," in which the author traces the genesis and decay of a unified religious and moral organization of Western Europe, is par- ticularly suggestive. It is possible that some of the allusions may be obscure for the reader who has not some previous ac- quaintance with mediaeval writings and authors. FLOYD N. HousEz.
