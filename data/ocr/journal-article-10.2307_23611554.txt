Travellers returning from distant lands brought with them new wonders of nature, such as the tulip, its exotic form fascinating artists and collectors alike. In 17th-cen tury Dutch art, depictions of flowers and plants, both as art objects and in the service of sci entific treatise, were extremely popular, these images also reflected nationalistic preoccupations with material wealth, scientific understanding and colonial power. As a reflection of the scientific exploration that continued into the Age of the Enlightenment, the National Botanic Gardens of Ireland (NGBI) in Glasnevin, north of Dublin city centre, was founded in 1795 by, what was to become, the Royal Dublin Society. Today, it enjoys a world-wide reputation and among its significant holdings is an important collection of botanical art and illustration. : V -w ' As noted by Patricia Butler, no continuous or extended tra •* dition of Irish artists engaging with botanical subject matter emerges when compared to other schools such as the Dutch.1 However, there are a number of notable exceptions including Mrs Delany (1700-1788) and Samuel Dixon (fl. 1745-1769) who produced popular flower pieces to decorate 18th-century homes.2 Lydia Shackelton (1828-1914) and Alice Jacob (1862 -1921) are among a notable group of women artists who pro duced botanical art. Tipperary-born Edith Blake (1845-1926), was an artist and book illustrator whose travels allowed her to study and publish on the flora and fauna of locations such as Bahamas, Jamaica, Hong Kong and Ceylon.3 Other artists who looked to nature included the wood-engraver Robert Gibbings, who punctuated his published accounts of travel ling through Ireland and Britain with finely crafted illustra tions of native vegetation,4 and Elizabeth Corbet Yeats (1868-1940) who in the 1890s illustrated a series of painting size:13x12cm paper size: 32x28cm WINTER 2013 I IRISH ARTS REVIEW 93 Natural Selection Angela Griffith 1JIM ALLEN WISTERIA SINENSIS etching &amp; aquatint on somerset paper.

Conventionally in art, the plant 'receives' its admiring audi ence, however Barry's Venus Eye Trap is not passive, its returning gaze is vivid in response (Fig 2). A number of the artists were inspired by the spaces and environments that make up the National Botanic Gardens. David Lilburn's drypoint, A Visit to the Botanic Gardens, resembles a hand-drawn 'treasure map'. It is a montage of images, marks and textures, each representing the sites, ter rains and atmospheres recollected from his visit. For some artists such as Dubliner Louise Leonard, the gardens are a well-known and well-loved resource. Leonard delights in the space's ever-changing vistas brought about by the seasons, and with graphic dexterity and layered colouring, her work cap tures the multifarious effects of light through a wooded walk way. The symbolic or expressive aspects of the garden space are depicted in a number of works. Carmel Benson uses a range of sensitively crafted fluid marks and colour applica tions in her rendering of Killmacurragh's ancient yew lined walkway (Fig 6). As a single figure is engulfed by its surround ings, the image evokes themes of transience and man's fragile, yet interdependent, relationship with the forces of nature. Many artists continue to be drawn to the traditional processes of the woodcut, a method which lends itself well to explorations of pattern, through shape and colour. The formal qualities of the Japanese woodcut tradition are expanded upon in Gerry Cox's colour print Full Moon and bamboo. As in eastern practice, the viewpoint is manipu lated as the observer is guided skyward to a golden-hued Harvest moon, interrupted by gentle swaying forms of bam boo (Fig 5). Among other prints that suggest an Asian influ ence are Jean Bardon's depiction of richly coloured, statuesque lupins, and Ruth O'Donnell's A Nightingale in the Rose garden which, through bold pattern and colour, possesses an exuberant lyricism. The decorative stylisations of Middle Eastern botanical art informed Anne Anderson's hand-printed lino-cut of Fritillaria Imperialis, a plant native to Himalayan regions. The flattened plant shapes are juxta posed with a linear description of the Palm House's Egyptian-inspired decorative detailing. Echoing the practice of the botanical illustrator, a selec tion of the artists chose to isolate and engage directly with the details of individual plants, exploiting their visual qual ities of colour, form, pattern and texture. These aspects and the anthropomorphic traits of an orchid flower occupy the printmaker Stephen Lawlor (Fig 9). His four-plate etching with aquatint combines scientific-like scrutiny with the cre ative impulse. Drawing from the rich legacy of the tulip in the literary and visual arts, James McCreary isolates the col lapsing form of a fading tulip as it clings hopelessly to a i PAUL FITTERS 5 GERARD COX FULL MOON 6 CARMEL BENSON PHILODENDRON etching on AND BAMBOO woodblock ANCIENT YEW GROVE Fabriano paper.

Viewed from below, the plant's distinctive bold shapes, rich colours and textures are set against the soaring curves of the Palm House's cast-iron frames. Using photo graphic and embossing processes, Elke Thonnes' subtle, yet deceptively complex work, capture's a specific decorative feature on the Palm House which is overlaid onto a relief outline of Mutlow's map of the gardens dating from 1818, in acknowledgment of the site's historical and cultural her itage. In contrast to descriptions of the architectural struc ture of the Palm House, Johnny Bulger's image of dropping greenery conjures its humid tropical atmosphere, one that led him to recall his own experiences of the jungle during his travels in South East Asia. Belfast-based printmaker James Allen, who admitted to being overwhelmed on his first visit to the gardens, was eventually drawn to the distinctive interweaving of the plant Wisteria Senensis (Fig 1). The etched idiosyncratic outlines and contours are graphically described, as each strand of growth, physically and visually, depends on the other for support. Cecilia Stephen's selective study of the native tree Lavatera arborea weaves finely drawn lines with the natural fibres of the paper, which the artist made from material sourced from the plant itself.
