<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Jewish Quarterly Review, Vol. 102, No. 3 (Summer 2012) 405-430 The Concept of Infinity ( Eyn-dof ) and the Rise of Theosophical Kabbalah SANDRA VALABREGUE-PERRY This essay discusses the rise of theosophical Kabbalah in light of the development of the notion of infinity. Arguing that the origin of the theosophic notion of infinity goes back to Sefer yetoirah, I will analyze its applications in early sources and in Sefer yetoirah's medieval philosophical commentaries up to its theosophical commentaries in Kabbalah. In these theosophical texts we encounter a concept of God as infinite dimension, where emanation is primarily understood as an infinite essence in expan- sion. This essay sets out to demonstrate how this theosophical infinite God has emerged from the multidirectional expansion of the o efirot in Sefer yetoirah. The very movement from the j efirot to God himself and from the cosmological to the theosophical was made possible by two major shifts. The first depends on the understanding of the J efirot as divine, thus as infinite; and the second, in the shift from the multidirectional expansion to a unidirectional and vertical one. This argument leads, therefore, to a new understanding of Eyn-oof and its role in theosophic Kabbalah. It will reflect, as well, upon the relation between Kabbalah and philosophy. After some short methodological remarks, I will examine the concept of Eyn-jof in early Jewish sources and notably in Sefer yetoirah. Then, in order to understand the novelty of theosophical Kabbalah, I will analyze the philosophical interpretations of Eyn-oof in the philosophical commen- taries of Sefer yetoirah. I turn finally to the importance of the theosophical notion of Eyn-oof as formulated by the first generation of kabbalists in Provence and Gerona. In his seminal discussion of Eyn-oof, Gershom Scholem traces theo- sophic innovation as a transition from one grammatical form to another - This essay develops issues I first address in my book Concealed and Revealed: 'Ein Sof ' in Theosophic Kabbalah (Hebrew; Los Angeles, 2010).

This shift is para- digmatic and not strictly historical or linear and is, as Scholem notes, difficult to pinpoint historically.3 Thus, the "linguistic" shift is not deter- minative, and it cannot be used to pinpoint the emergence of theosophic Kabbalah. We need to reconsider our understanding of the theosophical structure, at least at the beginning of theosophic Kabbalah.4 Moreover, 1.

Moshe Idei has shown that viewing Eyn-óof as a concept that belongs to negative theology understates other uses of the concept, such as anthropomorphic descriptions of Eyn-jof Elliot Wolfson, in a major article, has shown clear expressions of positive (kataphatic) theology diminish the hegemony of negative theology.6 In light of these studies, a more comprehensive model of Eyn-jof as the ontological kernel of theosophic Kabbalah is still needed. This model should give a sense of the positive theology so intrinsic to theosophic Kabbalah. Therefore, I wish to propose an alternative comprehension of Eyn-jof ' The ambivalence noted by Scholem and others between the uses of Eyn-jof as an adverb and as a proper noun reflects not merely a transitional phase in the development of theosophic Kabbalah but is a characteristic feature of the notion of Eyn-jof itself. In fact, the ambivalent expressions ad Eyn-jof (until infinity) and le-Eyn-¿of (to infinity) are extremely common both in the earliest period of theosophic Kabbalah and in major thirteenth-century kabbalistic texts, including zoharic literature. Thus, I propose to view the adverbial forms as a major and fundamental form of theosophic Kabbalah rather than as an archaic form, and only a stage toward a more comprehen- sive and structured concept of God. Such a reading will change our under- standing of the theosophic ontology and its dynamic. &lt;* * Let us turn first to the historical development of Eyn-jof in Jewish sources in the time frame that preceded theosophic Kabbalah. In fact, contrary to his predecessors, Scholem did not view Eyn-jof solely as concept imported from philosophy.7 Indeed, infinity is a notion present in the Bible in 5.

The hypotheses of Gnostic influence had been reconsidered lately by Moshe Idei, pointing out to an interesting Coptic Gnostic text, which may represent an earlier Jewish tradition: Idei, "On the Doctrine of the Divinity in the Early Kabbalah,"</page><page sequence="4">408 JQR 102.3 (2012) phrases such as eyn heker (unsearchable) and eyn mi* par (beyond mea- sure), which are used to describe God's greatness.8 Later, we encounter similar expressions in rabbinical literature, such as let sof (without end) or let minyan (without count).9 As such, the notion of infinity and related concepts already bear two inseparable marks: an optimal magnitude and an inevitable inaccessibility. The notion of infinity appears in the early mystical literature as well.10 In a passage from the Slavic version of Enoch, we read: "For you see the measure of my body11 . . . but I have seen the measure of the body of the Lord, with no measure, similar to nothing and without boundary. "12 This 137, 144-45. On the resemblance of aperentos and Eyn-sof, see Charlotte Baynes, A Coptic Gnostic Tre a tu e Contained in the Codex Bruciamu: A Translation from the Coptic (Cambridge, 1933), 3, 10, 40. This stance was later expanded by Shalom Rosenberg who pointed to further examples culled from rabbinical literature and medieval Jewish philosophy.

R. Jopse (Madison, N.J., 1997), 71. The examples found in rabbinical literature are in the same lines as the uses made of infinity in the Bible. 8. See, for example, "Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, and his greatness is unsearchable" (Ps 145.3); "Great is our Lord, and abundant in power, his understanding is beyond measure" (Ps 147.5); "As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, so the heart of kings is unsearchable (Prov 25.3); "Who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number" (Job 9.10). 9.

This of course rests on the assumption that the old Slavonic version translates the Hebrew Shi'ur Komah. Itamar Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Aierkavah Mysticinn (Leiden, 1980), 213. This being said, there is no evidence of an influence of the Hekhalot literature on 2 Enoch, and Gruenwald's suggestion and Kahana's translation have been criti- cized by Martin Cohen (see next note). Beside the philological difficulties and the difficult question of influences, what interests us here is the correlation between consideration of God's height {komah) with consideration of his infinity. 12.

Indeed, such a concep- tion will be explored later on in the medieval commentaries, mainly in the philosophical ones. In Sefer yets irah we find another concept of infinity, connected this time with the notion of the sefirot.15 While the notion of infinity can be found elsewhere, as we have seen, the notion of the s efirot is unique to Sefer yetsirah. Still, while the origin of the term sefirot in Sefer yetsirah has long been emphasized, the deep dependence of Eyn-sof on this classical text has been comparatively neglected. Sefer yetsirah is not merely another text to deploy Eyn-sof adverbially but is also the text to which the two key concepts of the theosophic Kabbalah, s efirot and Eyn-sof, can be traced for the first time. The particular connection between Eyn-sof and the s efirot , which is unique to Sefer yetsirah , will function as a textual trigger for the theosophic meaning that will accrue in the Middle Ages to both Eyn-sof and the s efirot . To begin with, since Eyn-sof in Sefer yetsirah is a characteristic attributed to the ¿efirot, and considering the equivocal status of the s efirot in Sefer 13.

The status of the sefirot in Sefer yets irah is not quite clear. Actually, we don't know if they are part of the divine or only the principles active in the process of creation, although it is more likely that as principles and primordial numbers they are seen as differentiating from the divine.

"Their measure is ten for they have no limit" appears in mishnahs 4, 6, and 7 (see above quoted mishnahs 6 and 7) of the critical edition (Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Aterkavah Mystic um, 141-42; Hayman, Sefer Ye jira, 69-71, 74-5). In the short edition of mishnah 4 and 8 the same sentence does not occur, whereas it occurs only in 5. It is important to quote also another expression of the same locution: "rpO Drf? ]"X jíT^n" (their finality has no end) in mishnah 6 of the short version (Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism 143, mishnah 8; Hayman, Sefer Yes ira, 77-79). 19. The other versions add here: "and their beginning is in their end," Hay- man, Sefer Yesira, 77-79. In this image lies an alternative notion of infinity, a cyclic one, which is going to be developed as numerical infinite mainly in the philosophical commentaries. 20.

I'm quoting from the short version, since this version was more common among the kabbalists; for a critical edition, see Itamar Gruenwald, "A Preliminaiy Critical Edition of Sefer Yezira," Israel Oriental Studies 1 (1971): 143 (mishnah 7).</page><page sequence="7">INFINITY, THEOSOPHICAL KABBALAH- VALABREGUE-PERRY 41 1 We encounter here two main definitions: the J efirot of nothingness and the ten J efirot without end ( eyn lahem ¿of). Considering the enigmatic lan- guage of the text, these definitions are obviously not meant to be contra- dictory but rather have to be understood, from the point of view of Sefer yetjirah, as two similar descriptions of the j efirot . Nevertheless, this "noth- ingness" is different from the concept of infinite expansion, and these two concepts should be viewed as two primary vectors in the cosmological system of Sefer yetjirah. Indeed, one can see in the j efirot an infinite power of expansion, while the other underlines the power of annihilation, restraint, slowing down, and coming to a halt (which is another significa- tion of belimah , from the root b-l-ni).22 From this perspective, there is an inherent tension between God and the jefirot, in which the notion of Eyn- jof plays an important role. This tension is between God as center of the cosmos and his expansions into the different directions, called jefirot.23 In that regard, Eyn-jqf is a notion that depicts the power of the infinite expansion of the jefirot.24 Therefore, on the one hand, we have the jefirot as extensions and as such infinite, and on the other, God at the center of 22. The dynamic that expresses the relation between God and the jefirot is, as Yehuda Liebes describes, the cornerstone of the process of creation in Sefer yet- sirah. On the dynamic of expansion and annihilation, see Liebes, The Ars Poetica of the Sefer Yetzirah , 35-46, 167-89, 190-203; on the different significations of b-l-m: ibid. 55, 164.

It is noteworthy that the notion of infinite expansions is also at the center of a Judeo-Christian text, called Pseudo-Clementine, written at the beginning of the second century, which could have influenced or would have been influenced by Sefer yet J irah. This astonishing similarity between Pseudo-Clementine and Sefer yetsirah has been outlined by Shlomo Pines, in his essay "Points of Similarity between the Exposition of the Doctrine of the Sephirot in the Sepher Yetzirah and a Text of the Pseudo-Clementine Homilies: The Implications of this Resem- blance," Studies in the Hit tory of Jew'ish Thought 5 (Jerusalem, 1997): 63- 142.

Respectively, it is also interesting to note later application of the infinite expansions conception, as found in Hasdai Cresças, where the influence of Kabbalah is seen in its concep- tion of Infinity: Carlos Fraenkel, "God's Existence and Attributes," in Cambridge History of Jewish Philosophy , ed.

In these com- mentaries, the paradigmatic opposition between the One standing at the center and the infinite extremities of the Sefer yetsirah finds its expression in an interesting numerical conception: the infinity of the sefirot is under- stood as the infinite numeric power. In this numerical concept, One is not a number but rather the immutable principle that is embodied in every number and which makes it possible to move from one number to another. The numerical extension departs from one, moving up to nine or ten. From there on, it returns to one and becomes ten (or eleven), which is the smallest unit of unity in diversity. From there, it continues to twenty and to a hundred and so on. In such a scheme, ten is seen as the arithmetic basis for the infinite capacity of repeated counting. Since there are no numbers bigger than ten without returning to one, it is there- fore the smallest unit of unity in the multiplicity; it is the principle of unity acting in the multiplicity. The first expansion is therefore from one to nine (or ten), and then returning to one to form the unity of the next numerical expansion and repeating this ad infinitum.26 25. We can see here an antagonism between the One and the multiple repre- sented by the infinite power of the s efirot . 26. This notion, based on the repetition of a fragment of ten or nine, can be found in most of the philosophical commentaries on Sefer yetsirah (with the excep- tion of Shabbetai Donnolo).

The position of Sefer yetjirah in contrasting the One with the multiple is even more acute in Saadya Gaon's commentary. The concept that sees infinity alongside the category of plurality is emphasized in his commentary, with the notion of infinite said to be human rather than divine: ... As for his establishing a correspondence (muwäzät) between these Ten and Ten Things that have no end (nihäya), he intended [to show] thereby that, whereas from the human [point of view] there is no end to what may be put together from the numbers by themselves, they are finite (tatanãhã) from the Creator's [point of view]. Thus, we do not know the end (nihäya) of the First and Last of Time, whereas He knows; we [cannot] reach the end of the six directions, Height and Lowness, East and West, North and South, whereas He knows this. Nor can we define with regard to everything the ultimate in Benefi- cence and Badness, whereas He does define them. Accordingly, these ten things have no end [from the point of view] of the created beings, but have an end [from the point of view] of their Creator.27 The One, as in the Neoplatonic tradition, is said to be unchangeable, absolute simplicity. Thus, the reason why Eyn-¿of is not a notion that would easily represent God's essence is understandable. Indeed, the rela- tion between the One and the infinite has been problematic throughout the history of Western philosophy.28 To attribute to the One the charac- teristics of the Infinite makes sense since it only increases its perfection,29 27.

Another example oř the One as the main notion to which infinity has been subordinate can be found in the introduction of the commentary of Yehuda Bar- celoni on Sefer yet jira h: "Blessed be God, God of Israel, One and unified in all his ways . . .

We find an echo of this conflict in Saadya's concept of infinity. Therefore, his model of infinity evades the problem created by the possibility of infinite expansion. To that extent, the infinite expansion is interpreted as a cyclic infinite, which is contradictory to the idea of infinite expansion. The ten ¿efirot that have no end are understood accord- ing to the second concept of the j eflrot : ten j efirot belimab ,30 and subordi- nated to their numeric restraint (that is, their finitude).31 In a way, the concept of infinite replication of the same segment offers an answer to the problematic definition of Eyn-jof in Sefer yetzirah. The infinite is no longer a wild expansion with all the dangers that this presents but rather infinite possibilities of combination. The fact that the numerical concept of infinity is a concept of an infinite number of possibilities of combination shows that it is based on a concept of limitation rather than of limitless- ness. We find ourselves far from the other concept of infinite expansions as found in the Sefer yetjirah and later adopted by theosophical commen- taries. Therefore, we need to see that the prevalent model in Saadya's concept is a finite one, as is his model of God's perfection.32 Interestingly enough, the other alternative regarding the infinity of the ¿ efirot in the Sefer yeLiirab as expressing an infinite expansion reverberates in Barcel- onas commentary, where it is presented as an "another explanation":33 he, and blessed be his name for eternity," Commentary of Sefer Yetzirah by Yehuda Barceloni, 1. 30. The conflict between the two concepts of the «&gt; efirot (limited and unlimited) echoes in a passage of Dunash ibn Tamim's commentaiy, in which he clearly opposes Saadya's interpretation of belimab as restriction: "How right is Sefer Yetzirah when he comments that the ten sefirot of Nothingness {belimab) . . . but he who interprets 'belimab' as restraint is wrong. Abraham our father blessed be his memory was right when he said that nothing is understandable but only to the unique master, God, faithful king who governs his world from his sainted palace, for eternity," Vajda, Le commentaire ¿ tir le livre de la Création , 222. For the different sense given by Saadya Gaon, see next note. 31. Another proof of the prevalence of the One-limited on the Plurality-unlim- ited in Saadya Gaon's philosophy is his translation of two different notions from Sefer yetzirah: pûll? (deep) and fp (end), using the same Judeo- Arabic word (rrxn]). See the remarks of Joseph Kapar: Sefer Yetzirah with Commentary of Saadya Gaon , 51, n. 65; Pines, "Points of Similarity," 116; Tony Levy, Figures de l'infini: Le¿ mathématiques au miroir dej cultures (Paris, 1987), 173-77, 183. 32. To this extent it is quite ironic that the so-called paraphrase of Saadya's "Book of Beliefs and Opinions," which was so influential in the Middle Ages, promulgated a notion of infinite expansion. I think that this stance contradicts Saadya's commentaiy on Sefer ye foirah and thus should be regarded as a late addi- tion. See, on this question, Scholem, Origins, 2 66. 33. If this other concept, as it is usually the case, is not shared by the author, we might see here a proof of his allegiance to Saadya's concept.</page><page sequence="11">INFINITY, THEOSOPHICAL KABBALAH -VALABREGUE- PERRY 415 Ten c fefirot belimah their measure is ten and they are endless, etc. Some commentaries say that God had created ten single things paralleling these ten t tefirot, and these ten single things, their measure is ten without end. The explanation for "their measure" is measurement; meaning the measurement of those ten things is endless and these are the depth of beginning and the depth of end; and the meaning of "Depth" is that no one can delve into and understand what it is.34 The concept of infinite expansion will take a clear theosophic turn in R. Shabbatai Donnolo's commentary. In an important article, Elliot Wolfson has shown that Donnolo's concept of the j efirot is to be understood as theosophic, since he sees the j efirot as part of the divine.35 It must be noticed that the divine status of the ¿efirot derives from their infinite status, and thus we read in his commentary: This is the import of what is written, "They have no end." This instructs us that there is no sage in the world who can know, compre- hend and penetrate the knowledge of God, to discover the end and to reach the limit of these ten profound [impenetrable] «. fefirot. If a sage pursues them and seeks in his mind all the days of the world to compre- hend them, it will not amount to anything. For a person cannot delve with his mind to pursue in order to know these ten things which are infinitely and endlessly deep.56 Donnolo explains the concept of infinite expansion of the o efirot by reen- forcing their definition as infinite depths. Nevertheless, a shift occurs in the understanding of the depths, and from a spatial dimension it now becomes an epistemologica! dimension. The infinity here is understood 34. The Commentary of Sef er Yetzirah by Yehuda Barceloni, 148. The clear mention of two sets o£ ¿efirot is understood as one set being apparently finite, and referring to another set which is infinite, i.e., beyond understanding. On the two sets ot &lt;/ efirot in early Kabbalah, see Moshe Idei, "The Sefirot above the Sefirot" (Hebrew), Tarbiz 51 (1982): 239-80. 35. Here Wolfson has shown that the commentary of Donnolo has to be counted as one of the earliest if not the earliest testimony of the theosophic con- cept of the J efirot which will, some two hundred years later, stand at the core of the theosophic Kabbalah. He wrote: "It can be shown, moreover, that for Don- nolo this demut , or the upper aspect of the glory, is the boundless and limitless light that contains, embraces, or encompasses the ten sefirot," "The Theosophy of Shabbetai Donnolo," 294. 36. Shabbetai Donnolo, Sefer Hakhmoni, ed. D. Castelli (Hebrew; Jerusalem, 1994), 35-36.

It is important to note that this crucial aspect of the notion of infinity was also found in the commentary quoted by Yehuda Barceloni: "the meaning of 'Depth' is that no one can delve into and understand what it is." Both explanations connect the jefirot without end and the ten depths ( atnakim ) in Sefer yetjirah. The almost invisible line that separates the two meanings of infinity (epistemological and onto- logical) is inherent to the ambivalent character of the notion of infinity. This is not the case with Saadya Gaon, who drew a clear line between the limits of human knowledge (the epistemological infinite) and the truly perfect though finite God. Whereas for Saadya the infinity of the jefirot is only the sign of an epistemological limit, in Donnolo's commentary and in the quote by Barceloni, the limits of human knowledge are the sign of the infinite status of the jefirot. Moreover, for Donnolo, the essential unknowability of the jefirot is a sign of their divine nature. Two generations later, another hint at a theosophical concept of the jefirot can be seen in the work of Shlomo ibn Gabirol (d. ca. 1058). 37 It has been suggested that he may be echoing a concept bearing a far more substantial approach to the jefirot , one that was criticized by Saadya a centuiy earlier.38 Gabirol indeed alludes that by means of the jefirot it is possible to contemplate God: [God] has craved the trustee's advice; a band of ten jefirot he planned to reveal. He wrote facing them ten in Eyn-jof ; and five in five in accor- 37. Different scholars have pointed out the importance of ibn Gabirol a possi- ble source for the Neoplatonic influences on Kabbalah: Gershom Scholem, "Fol- lowing the Trace of ibn Gabirol" (Hebrew), Studies in Kabbalah 1 (1998): 39-64; Shlomo Pines, "'Ve-karah el ha-ayn ve-nikva': Research on Shlomo ibn Gabirol's Keter Malkhout" (Hebrew), Tarbiz 50 (1981): 339-47; Yehuda Liebes, "Rabbi Solomon ibn Gabirol's Use of the Sefer Yetzirah and a Commentary on 'I Love Thee" (Hebrew), Jerusalem Studies in Jewbh Thought 6 (19 87): 73-123; Liebes, "The Platonic Source for the Philosophical Riddle and for the Way It Is Used in ibn Gabirol's Poem 'I Love You'," http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~liebes/zohar/research.h- tml; Idei, "On the Doctrine of the Divinity in the Early Kabbalah," 141-4; Idei, "On Binaiy 'Beginnings' in Kabbalah Scholarship," 322, n. 22; Jacques Shlanger "Sur le rôle du tout dans la création selon ibn Gabirol," Revue des Etudes Juives 126 (1964): 125-35.

(He who) understands their secret will be frightened and scared; from them he will study that the creator is one.39 In fact, we might have here one of the earliest occurrence of Eyn-jof not as an adjective but as a noun, one that precedes theosophic Kabbalah. This understanding of Gabirol's concept of the jefirot is still open to schol- arly debate.40 From our point of inquiry, what matters is that whatever Gabirol's position was, it is sufficient that such a reading was available to kabbalists. Furthermore, if indeed ibn Gabirol's concept of the j efirot is to be understood as theosophical, it will be due to a genuine understanding oí Jefirot as infinite.41 It should be stressed that the numerical infinite gives an alternative to the possibility of an infinite divine concept, but once the infinite expan- sion of the jefirot has been reconfirmed, the identification between jefirot and Eyn-jof has reinforced the divine status of the jefirot. This points to a shift from a description of Eyn-jof as an infinite space in Sefer yetjirah to an infinite divine space. This shift - clearly stressed in Donnolo's com- mentary and in the commentary quoted by Barceloni and perhaps also by ibn Gabirol- would become the focus of the study of the theosophic Kabbalah at the end of the twelfth century.42 39.

Jospe, "Early Philosophical Commentaries on the Sefer Yezirah," Revue dej Etudej Juivej 149 (1990): 390-92. 40. Yehuda Liebes does not accept the reading of Pines and Idei of Gabirol's concept of the jefirot and argues in favor of a concept closer to that oř Saadya Gaon. For that argument {jefirot as primordial numbers), see Fotu Vitae, 2, 21; on this passage, see Liebes, "Rabbi Solomon ibn Gabirol's Use of the Sefer Yet- zirah," 78- 79. For other consideration on the notion oř infinity in Fonj Vitae, see chap 1. 5. I tend to agree with Idei and Pines that be-Eyn-jof (^10 ]SIQ) is more likely to express a substantive aspect of Eyn-jof. However, what I have intended to outline in this research is that the distinction first made by Scholem between adverb and noun is not so accurate anymore: it fails to explain the beginnings oř theosophic Kabbalah, not only because a substantial concept of Eyn-jof can be found in earlier sources and also in the adverbial form but because the distinction between adverb and nominative forms is not representative of the formation oř theosophic Kabbalah. Moreover, it fails to reflect the principal shift that occurred to the notion of expansional infinity oř the jefirot. 41. Thus, it seems to me far more important that where Eyn-jof and the jefirot are possibly connected, a reading oř the jefirot as divine on one hand and oř an ontological infinite on the other is made possible. 42. I have put aside in this essay the important Haside Ashkenaz mystical trend, in which important theosophic concepts can be found, and have decided to focus on the sefirotic Kabbalah, which held a different sefirotic tradition. On</page><page sequence="14">418 JQR 102.3 (2012) # at « Whereas the shift from an infinite space to an infinite divine space was only alluded to in the sources analyzed above, the interconnection between the epistemological and ontological infinite will lie at the basis of the new theosophic system. I turn now to the earliest theosophical commentaries and will present examples of the development of two insep- arable notions: Eyn-sof and the J efirot , which serve as the basis of a new theosophical language. The book of the Bahir, usually viewed as a prototext of theosophic Kabbalah, written in the late twelfth centuiy in Southern France by an anonymous author, expresses an important aspect that will become cen- tral and paradigmatic to the theosophical way of thinking. Reflecting on the Sefer yetsirah, we find there a reference to the infinite expansion of spatial dimensions.43 In another passage we read: The Aleph looks like the brain, when you mention the Aleph, you open your mouth. The same is true of thought, when you extend your thoughts to the Infinite and the Boundless. From Aleph emanate all letters.44 Indeed, the same expression of extension of thought until Eyn-JofAS can be found in the commentary of Sefer yetsirah written by R.

It is important to point out that the term is "forever and ever" (li? "li? Ii?) and not "without end" (^10 pt).

At the very beginning of his commentary, we read as follows: In thirty-two: The letter bet is an allusion to Hokhnuih (wisdom) and Hiukhel (the intelligence) and it alludes to all that the apprehension of the thought apprehends unto Eyn oof, and all the more what is included within itself . . . Every word that begins with a bet indicates both itself and what is within. So too, bet in thirty-two, in which he engraved, meaning: that which thought does not apprehend.46 First, it is interesting to note the unique interconnection of epistemologi- ca! inquiry and cosmological expansion in the way both texts address the notion of infinity. Eyn-oof appears first here to set the limits of the inquiry of thought but could as well be understood as the infinite dimension of the thought. Understanding exactly the status of the "thought" is rather difficult considering the enigmatic style of R. Isaac the Blind. The ambi- guity between two different ways to understand thought, as being either human or divine, is part of the process of psychologization of the divine, which is so characteristic of the theosophic structure. At this very point, one can sense the fusion between the epistemological approach and the cosmological one inspired by the words of Sefer yetoirah and Sefer ha-bahir. It is important to take note of two major transformations: the first a move from cosmological expansion toward psychological expansion, whereas the second is a shift from human limitation to the divine realm. As in the previous sources, in Isaac's commentaiy, Eyn-oof can be understood in its adverbial form; nevertheless, since the idiom doesn't apply only to the oefirot, it can be understood as a proper noun as well, and therefore both significations are available: "to infinity" and "to the infinite." However, before we can even point out a kabbalistic invention that is named Eyn-oof, we should consider a preliminary step, namely, the shift from divine cosmological dimensions to the theosophic dimension. The fact that the latter has been characterized by its infinity is reflected Journey of Initiation in the Babylonian Layer of Sefer ha-Bahir," Stuàia Hebraica 7 (2007): 17-33. 46. Marc B.

Isaac interprets the numerical concept of infinity in terms of expansion: The things have dimensions and measure, but the thought has no mea- sure, so they proceed ten by ten. Therefore, from the subtle come the inscribed, for ten come from ten, subtle ones from the innerness of the subtle ones.47 Limitation is here not only characteristic of human realm but extends to some c iefirot as well. The tension between limited things and unlimited thought has been resolved by means of a suggested infinite possibility of upward ascension: ten by ten. The twist given to the numerical concep- tion is emblematic of theosophic structure. While comparing the numeri- cal infinite found in the philosophical commentaries, two fundamental changes should be noticed. First, ten is the unity here and not One. Sec- ondly, this very numerical principle (ten by ten) comes to describe the infinite numerical power, a vertical ascension expanding infinitely toward the Infinite. Without entering the complex question as to the nature of the ¿efirot and the havayot (essences), it is my purpose to stress the different expres- sion given to the relationship between the finite and the infinite. Two different concepts of the jefirot are intertwined. According to one, their dimensions are finite, while according to the other, they are infinite, since their roots never end and they are beyond all apprehension.48 "Ten by ten"49 refers to gradation of different levels, and the very idea of gradation implies continuation, even though we are talking about opposites: finite and infinite.

"For those dimensions which have been mentioned are all in 'Ein Sof. In our language there are only the headings of the dimensions," Sendor, "The Emergence of Provençal Kabbalah," 2:46. 49.

Idei, "The Sefirot above the Sefirot" (more specifically about Isaac the Blind, 240- 41). 50. The chain of degrees that is suggested here in the adoption of the vertical elevation is strongly Neoplatonic. The multiplicity of essences in Eyn-¿of contra- dicts the philosophical principle of simplicity and of unity. On the Neoplatonic influences on R. Isaac the Blind, see Sendor, "The Emergence of Provençal Kabbalah," 2:37, n. 95; 1:117-29. On the similarity between the infinite essences (^10 jrò "pXÜ min) of R.

It is impossible for the worshiper to reach Eyn-jqf directly, unless his prayers are mediated.52 While dimensions in their finite expression are ways to comprehend, the infinite chain of their interconnection is there to outline another kind of connection to Eyn-jof, by way of suckling rather than that of knowledge.53 The special status of the dimensions is honed by R. Isaac while making a distinction between dimensions and limits: Their limit ( takhlitan ) is not like their dimension (miàatan). A dimen- sion is something received by separate things, for the prophets saw dimensions according to their apprehension, and by virtue of receiving their power, they expanded their consciousness more than other human beings, for they gained by this a breadth of soul to extend to particulars within 'Ein Sof. But their limit is the limit of their investiga- tion. For every dimension has a limit and eveiy finite thing has an end, 51. "Their measure is ten. Everything is a dimension and what is above it is its filling, for dimension is a power which is emanated from the dimension ot the measurer, the essentiality of dimension and the emanation of essence in Eyn-sol," Sendor, "The Emergence of Provençal Kabbalah," 43-45. It is of some interest to mention that the distinction between the measurer (TTIO) and its measure (HTO) recalls some commentaries on the Shïur komah distinguishing between the two words (""HITE) and HOIp) and seeing in "ilTQn lp" the action of God. See on this question Yehuda Liebes, "Chapters in the Dictionary of the Book of the Zohar" (Hebrew; Ph.D. dissertation, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1976), 146. 52. "All the awesome dimensions are given to comprehend, for every dimen- sion is from a dimension that is above it, and they are given to Israel to compre- hend, from the dimension that appears in the heart, to comprehend unto Eyn- sof. For, there is no way to pray other than by the finite things a person receives and elevates in thought unto Eyn-sof," Sendor, "The Emergence ot Provençal Kabbalah," 74-75. 53. "The pathways are sources oř the byways: lor pathway is the 'source ot a byway' (Ezek 21.26). The pathway is a generality and a principle, for the byways disperse and separate and spread out from there. The pathways of the wonders are like veins within the stock of a tree, and hochmah is the root. They are inner and subtle essences, which no creature can contemplate except that which suckles from it, a mode of contemplation by way of suckling, not by way ot knowing," Sendor, "The Emergence of Provençal Kabbalah," 10-13. On the two ways ol contemplation, see Idei, "The Sefirot above the Sefirot," 241. On suckling as the only way to connect to the Ayn, see Daniel Matt, "Ayn: The Concept ol Nothing- ness in Jewish Mysticism," in The Problem of Pure Conjcioiunesj, Myjticumi and Philosophy, ed. R. Forman (New York, 1990), 135-36, nn. 74, 75.</page><page sequence="18">422 JQR 102.3 (2012) like that which is written "for all finite things I have seen an end" but "Your commandment" even though its beginning has a limit, continu- ally expands "exceedingly" (Ps. 119:96) unto 'Ein Sof. While every- thing that perishes has a limit, "your commandment" cannot be apprehended by man to the utmost degree of apprehension, for a man grasps nothing but the headings of the dimensions.54 Despite the fact that in Sefer yets irah both terms "limit" and "dimension" express the infinity of the s efirot , R. Isaac stresses the difference - distinguishing ordinary knowledge and the knowledge of the prophets. The prophet can connect to Eyn-sof through the dimensions that have been revealed to him: the way of prophecy is the way of widening the path, toward infinity. These dimensions may be limited at their start but are unlimited in their expansion toward their origin ( Eyn-sof ). Interest- ingly enough, there is an overlap between the wideness of the prophetic path and the ascension on high.55 In other words, the connection between finite and infinite is made possible by means of upward ascension, toward Eyn-sof. Not only does the path bring one closer to Eyn-sof but it also widens the consciousness of the prophet/worshiper. This new theosophic space, created by the shift of the infinite expan- sions of Sefer yetsirah toward an expansion to Eyn-sof, finds its expression indeed in a new kabbalistic terminology that binds together the notion of Eyn-sof with that of emanation. The very beginning of the theosophic concept of infinity is first of all the conversion of infinite cosmological dimensions into a system of emanations, and thus into an infinite expan- sion. This is well illustrated with the idiom "infinite effluence" (nieshekh Eyn-sof) that is found in the writings of R. Isaac the Blind and his nephew R. Asher ben David,56 and from here on becomes a common denomina- 54. Sendor, "The Emergence of Provencal Kabbalah," 61-62. 55. This notion of a broad path fits another description given by R. Isaac of the path (3T1]) as being the head of the road ("J~n): Sendor, "The Emergence of Provençal Kabbalah," 11-22, and n. 29. As Sendor notes, the difference on this matter between R. Isaac's commentary and Nachmanides' commentary is note- worthy and had been noticed by R. Isaac of Acre as well. Gershom Scholem, "Isaac of Achre's Commentary on Sefer Yetzirah" (Hebrew), Kiryat Sefer 31 (1956): 383. Nachmanides understood the head of the road, ^20, in an opposite way, to be narrower and hidden from perception (Scholem, Studies in Kabbalah, 1, 88). 56. Here are some major uses of this expression by R. Asher ben David: "the effluence expanded from Eyn-sof," Daniel Abrams, R.

Asher ben David is an important link in the transmission of Provençal Kabbalah to Spain and played a key role in the changes undergone by the esoteric tradition as it moved from esoteric to exoteric lore. In the writings of R. Asher ben David, the ambiguity in the use of the term Eyn-sof 's still a common feature, as in the case of R. Isaac the Blind. The ambiguity that lies in the preposition "ad" (to/until) is reflected here in Eyn-sof 's relation to emanation.58 Therefore, it is important to stress that Eyn-sof, especially together with the description of infinite effluence, means the origin of the emanation but also the infinite essence of that expanse.59 Thus, emanation expresses an ontological continuity from the the spirit in them coming from Eyn-sof," ibid., 65; "the effluence of the benedic- tion coming from Eyn-sof," ibid., 105; "the will that expands from Eyn-sof con- tinually without interruption since it is the line in the middle," ibid., 64; and on the continuity of the infinite efflux that never stops, ibid., 111. In these examples and some others the notion of efflux is related to the middle way or the middle line: " Vav is a sign of the thirteen attributes Vav here and Vav there and Aleph in the middle, this is the line in the middle and the house of the word to come, and it supports everything, since the efflux that expands in it (is) from Eyn-sof and that is why He and His name are one," ibid., 104. 57. This term (rD"OQ »rDüQH ,"po) can be translated differently: 'thread,' 'exten- sion,' 'attraction,' or 'continuum.' It appears even previously to this in Shlomo ibn Gabirol's poem "A Crown lor a King" (8, 1. 83): "He drew the effluence of Being from Naught, as a ray of light breaks forth from the eye" (üTT "|OQ ""[TO1? yyn p X2¿TTI nxn -poro ]"Xn p), in Scholem, Origins, 313, n. 232; Liebes, "Rabbi Solomon ibn Gabirol's Use of the Sefer Yetzirah and a Commentary on 'I Love Thee'," 87-89. 58. In some descriptions, the effluence although emanating from Eyn-sof, stands for a name for Keter, the first sefirah: "Aleph is the first Sefirah ( keter ) that established everything as One (inx) in his primordial will and since it is the source of the benediction and the effluence that expands ("]OQ]n *pOn) from it, as the spring that irrigate all the garden," Abrams, R. Asher ben David, 104; "and this sefirah, that is called God's living spirit, corresponds to the effluence that expands ("|OQ3n "pon) in it from the source Aleph, [this] teaches us about the unity that is comprised in the One and that is unified in it, about all the forces that are in it in all the paths and in all the inscriptions that are in it, and through that same effluence that comes from Aleph without cessation. This sefirah is called One and is the beginning of the existence and the One that brings [into existence] is called the principle of all principles the cause of all causes. For that, it is said 'Bless and blessed is his name' since all that comes after him is called (after) the name (that is) above him and this until the end of the sefirot and that is enough for any scholar to understand," ibid., 106. 59. The nature of the sefirot - i.e., their infinite origin and/or essence - is directly connected to another question: whether the sefirot are the essence or ves- sels (of God). This question has been discussed by scholars. For Gershom Scho-</page><page sequence="20">424 JQR 102.3 (2012) source (from now on called Eyn-sof) to the world. This characteristic defines the very heart of the theosophic ontology, which differs in many ways from the Neoplatonic philosophy and from classical theology. The concept of God as an infinite essence, together with the concept of differ- ent stages of emanation, and the concept of the s efirot as inner to the Godhead, demands an integrative model: a model that would match the peculiar theosophic dynamic that deals with unity and multiplicity together.60 This challenge can be sensed in the words of the introduction by R. Asher ben David, while explaining the purpose of his book: I, Asher ben David ben Abraham ben David . . . wish to seek after the thirteen dimensions (midot) to understand and comprehend and know about the hearsay that is heard that they are called dimensions and whether they are limited and separated or whether they are united and unified in the cause of the causes and if so in what manner are they being called dimensions and how are they related to his grand name to be named so. Thus it makes sense that since they are called his dimen- sions, then they are dimensions without dimensions,61 without end nor limit ( = aim, be-Eyn-sof ve-tekhilah ) and without separation, Sublime and Elevate. And they are called dimensions not regarding themselves but rather regarding what reaches us in the dimension that we need through them as I have explained.62 lem and Efraim Gottlieb, Isaac the Blind held a concept of ¿efirot as essence while his students held a concept of vessels: Scholem, Kabbalah, 101-2; Scholem, Kabba- lah in Provence, 83-84; Efraim Gottlieb, Researches in Kabbalutic Literature (Hebrew; Tel Aviv, 1976), 115-30. Recent scholarship tends to find in R. Isaac the Blind and R. Asher a concept of the s efirot both as essence and as vessels: Idei, Kabbalah, 137- 41; Sendor, "The Emergence of Provencal Kabbalah," 1:303-7. Abrams, R. Asher ben David, 25-27. 60. According to Dauber, R. Asher ben David's conception is similar to the philosophical conception of simple divine unity, thus distinguishing him from R. Azriel on that question. 61. For a similar formulation: "They are not separated or limited dimensions from the side of their beginning; since they are dimensions without dimensions, without end and beginning. They are not called dimensions from their side but rather from our side," Abrams, R. Asher ben David, 66. On the infinite sefirot from the aspect of their beginning, see also Abrams, R. Ather ben David, 107. For an even more straightforward position: "How is it possible to give them limited dimensions while they are connected to the principle of principles to the cause of the causes. Really, every limited has an extremity and an end and every form has a body and every limited and everything that is connected will be separated," Abrams, R. Asher ben David, 109. 62. Abrams, R. Asher ben David, 118.</page><page sequence="21">INFINITY, THEOSOPHICAL KABBALAH -VALABREGUE-PERRY 425 R. Asher ben David addresses the kabbalistic lore as an advocate trying to answer probing theological questions.63 The question that he is trying to answer inquires into the concept of the plurality of God's dimensions, bearing in mind the challenge that it poses to the concept of God's unity. He describes therefore a twofold reality. When representing God's actions, the dimensions (micbt) of God are named after him; but in regard to their actions, they are named after the action itself.64 Although the vocabulary and the way of thinking seem to follow philosophical rhetoric, the fact that these dimensions reflect God's essence does not permit them to be understood as simple attributes following the philosophical termi- nology. The infinite axis that structures the theosophic realm bridges the gap between the upper world and the lower one and is thus dually orientated: up and down. The s efirot , the havayot, are said to be infinite in regard to their source and finite toward their application and action in the world. The theological answer given will serve as a major model in theosophic Kabbalah and can be viewed as a process of unification. Different images will be given to this special feature of the sefirotic system. The s efirot are like a bunch of grapes, which are all connected together, or like the differ- ent parts of the tree65 or like the branches of the menorah, all of which are connected at the base.66 To be unified is synonymous with infinity, and to be separated is synonymous with being finite. it is not possible to have in him a measured and limited dimension since he is one and he is unified in all of them and he acts in all of them as in one, or he acts in one of them and encompass in it all of them . . . because every dimension and dimension is encompassed in the other 63.

Abraham bar Hiyya and Early Kabbalah," Journal of Jewish Studies 60 (2009): 185-201: Dauber, "Competitive Approaches to Maimonides in Early Kabbalah/' in The Cultures of Maimonidean- Lmi, ed. J. T.

"His force, as it has been seen by the patriarchs, conforming to their actions and the extension in them (actions) of the spirit that comes from Eyn-sol, have been named by His names and they are the dimensions and plantations of God Bless be He. His influence is Glory in them and He acts through them as He wishes. For that reason, we unified Him in the verse: Listen Israel is One," Abrams, R. Asher ben David, 65. 65. The image of the tree is a common one used to express the unity of differ- ent entities; see, lor example, Abrams, R. Asher ben David, 52; Scholem, Kabbalah ui Provence, 9; Elliot R.

Asher ben David, 102.</page><page sequence="22">426 JQR 102.3 (2012) and he acts in all of them, as we wrote. And there is no separation between them and no division among them in their actions - every- thing is as I have explained.67 From here on, both - finite and infinite - represent the two extremities: the upper and the lower one, but they also express two different states: connected or separated to Eyn-jof. Since Eyn-jof is in eveiy dimension, they cannot be limited. The mere fact that the ¿ efirot belong to Eyn-jof is expressed in the idea of infinite expansion that is in fact a model of unifi- cation. There is one force that expands in each one, connects and unifies them all. With this in mind, it is important to sense that the theosophic model of unification is very different from the model of coincidental oppo/i- torum,68 in which unification signifies the total annihilation of all differ- ences.69 Indeed, the theosophic model demonstrated here shows a more tempered notion of unification that assembles different instances together: the totality that is represented here could be compared to a puzzle in which all the parts fit together. From this perspective, it is better under- stood why the ontological incompatibility of the finite and the infinite does not seem to be irreducible. Eyn-Jof's the key to this new theosophical concept of unity. In fact, another major shift needs to be pointed out. In most of the theosophic systems, Eyn-jof is not a characteristic attendant to the One, as is usually the case in philosophical systems, but rather the very concept on which the theosophical notion of unity and of unification rest. This enables the consideration of a dynamic unification that permits plurality in the divine world. 67. Abrams, R. Ajher ben David, 119. 68. On this concept in R. Azriel of Gerona's thought: Scholem, Origins, 312, 439- 40; on the coincidentia oppoÂtorum as mystical concept in Judaism, see Elliot R. Wolfson, Abraham Abulafia, Kabbalùt and Prophet: Herme ne litica, Theojophy and Theurgy (Los Angeles, 2000), 10; Wolfson, Venturing Beyond: Law and Morality in Kabbalijtic Mysticism (New York, 2006), 204-6, 264-65; Wolfson, Luminal Dark- ne&lt;hi (Oxford, 2007), xvi-xvii; Wolfson, Language, Eros, Being: Kabbalbtic Herme- neutičtí and Poetic Imagination (New York, 2005), 96-105. On the importance of this concept in the research of Gershom Scholem, Heniy Corbin, and other schol- ars of the twentieth centuiy, see Wasserstrom, Religion after Religion, 67- 82. 69. Different meanings can be attributed to coincidentia oppojitorum, one of which is the paradoxical convergence of the opposites that does not necessarily point to their annihilation. However, the model of unification that I have encoun- tered in my research portrays unification as a whole that is the sum of its parts. Here I point to unity or unification where each entity conserves its characteris- tics; in our case the finite stays finite and the infinite stays infinite but nevertheless they stay in relation.</page><page sequence="23">INFINITY, THEOSOPHICAL KABBALAH -VALABREGUE- PERRY 427 Let us continue with some major developments offered by R. Azriel of Gerona, who discusses different aspects of the relationship between finite and infinite. The writings of R. Azriel play an important role in the con- ceptualization of the theosophic structure and are of special interest to the theosophic concept of Eyn-oof. Here too we find a system in which the boundary between the limited and unlimited is blurred, when in fact the vertical realm elevates by connecting finite things one to another and to Eyn-oof:70 In this miihnah, it is recalled that everything is from Eyn-oof, although the things have measures and dimensions and they are ten, the dimen- sion that they have does not have an end ( eyn la ¿of), since the impres- sioned is from the sensed and the sensed is from the intelligible, from the elevated hidden, and the hidden has no end ( eyn lo ¿of), thus, in the same manner the impressioned, the sensed, and the intelligible have no end, and this is why those dimensioned were made - to contemplate through them in Eyn-oof .71 While R. Asher ben David describes God's dimensions as "dimensions without dimensions, without end and beginning (be eyn-oof ve-tekhilah) and without separation,"72 R. Azriel will take a similar path and discuss the 70. Another proof of the imperative necessity of connection between infinite and finite can be found in a different text of Azriel ("The Ways of Faith and the Ways of Heresy"), where he deems as heretics whoever think that because God is without limits he cannot be grasped by those who are limited: Gershom Scho- lem, "New Fragments from Azriel of Gerona Writings" (Hebrew), in Memory Book to Goiilak and Shmuel Klein (Jerusalem, 1942). For a detailed analysis oí the role of Eyn jof in Azriel's conception of faith, see Mordehy Fechter, "Principles of Faith and Heresy in the Thought of R. Azriel," Kabbalah 4 (1999): 315-14. 71. The Writings of Raben a Moshe hen Naehtnan, ed. B. Chavel (Hebrew; Jerusa- lem, 1963- 1970), 2:454- 55. On the elevation of the kamnah to Eyn-sof and on the theurgic action of drawing down the infinite effluence, see another early text, "Chapters on the Kavanah by the Ancient Kabbalists," supposedly written by Azriel or by someone of his entourage: Scholem, Origuw , 417- 19. For other expressions of the "effluence" originating from Eyn-sof, see Martel Gavrin, The Commentary on Prayer by Azriel of Gerona (Hebrew; M.A. thesis, Hebrew Univer- sity of Jerusalem, 1984), 29, 31, 32 ; R. Azriel of Gerona, The Commentary on the Agadot , ed. I. Tishby (Hebrew; Jerusalem, 1945), 25, 101; Moshe Idei, "The His- tory of the Concept "Zimzoum" in Kabbalah and in the Research" (Hebrew), Jerusalem Studies in Jew uh Thought 10 (1992): 102. 72. For a similar approach to the sefirot, see also R. Ezra of Gerona s letter to Abraham, where he discusses limiting and counting as human disposition whereas the sefirot are nonetheless infinite: Scholem, "New Document for the</page><page sequence="24">428 JQR 102.3 (2012) ambivalent nature of the ¿ efirot . R. Azriel's analysis goes as follows: First, Eyn-jof is said to be absolute perfection. From here on, if one says that God is without limit and therefore cannot take part in anything that is limited, this would actually imply that God could not have created the world. But saying that the limit emanates from him would also demon- strate his weakness, which too is impossible.73 R. Azriel is eager to per- suade that the true faith, which bridges the gap and resolves the problem, is in Eyn-¿of and the J efirot combined. Any attempt to understand them apart would be heresy. Thus, the status of ¿efirot as a medium and media- tor is the core of this concept.74 Finally, R. Azriel's position is best encap- sulated in a special formulation that encompasses the complex nature of the theosophic dynamism: " Eyn-jof is perfection without imperfection, and that his power in the limitation is unlimited and that the limitation emanating from him which delimits all existent beings is the ¿ efirot , having the power to act in perfection and imperfection."75 His power is infinite and his power to act within the limit is unlimited. The ¿ efirot stand in between the infinite and the limited world and belong to both realms. Eyn-jof crosses the limit and acts within the limit without any limit. The insistence on the close connection between Eyn-jof and the J efirot shows that the efirot are not to be understood as mere attributes of God, as in the model of classical philosophical theology. The description of emana- tion as extension of Eyn-oof points to a concept of Eyn-jof as essence. Rather than an abstract notion, it allows a concept of an extendable power. In Azriel's thought, the emanation is the limit emanating from Eyn-jqf; it is the infinite essence that expands in the limited. In this exam- ple, as in many others, the concept of j efirot as the essence of God forms the basis of the theosophic system and is the particular signature of its ontological concept. o # # Throughout this essay I have shown how the theosophic notion of Eyn- jof has emerged out of commentaries of the Sefer yeUurah within an under- standing of the infinite expansion of the j efirot as constitutive of the divine inner space. In a way, early Jewish mystical texts, despite their obvious differences, shared a common interest in the dimensions of God and his History of the Beginning of Kabbalah," in Bialik Book , ed. J. Wahrman (Hebrew; Tel Aviv, 1934), 160. 73. Early Kabbalah, ed. J. Dan and R. Kiener (New York, 1986), 90-92. 74.

Early Kabbalah, 92.</page><page sequence="25">INFINITY, THEOSOPHICAL KABBALAH -VALA BREGUE- PERRY 429 measurement: incommensurability of the Sh'lur komah or the infinite dimensions of the jefirot in Sefer yetjirah. Nevertheless, infinity as repre- senting God in his essence has been the prerogative of Kabbalah. Whereas philosophical commentaries- with the exception of Donnolo - tended to neutralize the problematic notion of infinite expansion of the jefirot, by way of a mathematical notion of infinite repetition oř the same segment. In sharp contrast, the theosophical commentaries confirm and finalize the notion of infinite expansion: Eyn-jof, but now it became the origin of divine emanation and the emanation itself. Thus, while philoso- phers such as Saadya Gaon viewed infinity as a sign of imperfection, the kabbalists view it as a sign of God's absolute omnipotence. Saadya's philosophical position reflects the general position toward infinity in Neo- platonic and Aristotelian trends while Eyn-jqf as a term representing God is an innovation of theosophic Kabbalah. Eyn -jof belongs not to the philo- sophical tradition of a single, unified, and entirely distinct Oneness but rather to a cosmological-theogonic tradition rooted in Sefer yefoirah. Therefore, even where we tend to find Neoplatonic influence on the theosophical system, especially where the notion of emanation is involved, we need to bear in mind that the theosophical notion of Eyn-jof originated within this system in rupture with philosophical precedents. Nevertheless, though this assertion diminishes the influence of (Jewish) Neoplatonic philosophy, it is not entirely dismissive. However, it does emphasize the cosmological roots of Eyn-jof and the unique theosophical concept of a metaspace: the divine realm. Rather than a theological com- promise - a twofold concept of an apophatic Eyn-jof on the one hand and a kataphatic system of ¿efirot on the other - the theosophical structure is a theological innovation. God as Infinite represents a distinct alternative to the philosophical concept of the One, of a simple and separated ontol- ogy; Eyn-jof offers a concept of unity that permits a dynamic, integrative multiplicity. The mark of the spatio-cosmological origin of Eyn-jof is seen in the concept of Eyn-jof as a direction and teloj. The widespread expressions ad Eyn-jof and le-Eyn-jof provide an alternative to the established under- standing of God as a disconnected transcendental principle. When Eyn-jof is characterized as a direction, it becomes a focus of kamnah (intention), a theosophic and theurgic address. The concept of Eyn-oof thus simultane- ously connotes the infinite expansion itself and the source of this expan- sion. This twofold signification is manifested in the histoiy of the development of the concept of Eyn-jof, as theosophic Kabbalah trans- forms the infinite expansion of the jefirot found in Sefer yetöirah into an infinite axis. The ambivalence latent in these phrases is characteristic of</page><page sequence="26">430 JQR 102.3 (2012) the theosophical structure in which Eyn-jof appears, both as the end of an infinite axis and as the infinite axis itself. Interestingly enough, it is not by accident that in both Sefer ha-bahir and Isaac the Blind's commentaiy on Sefer yefoirah, pointed to an elevation that is divine, yet deeply con- nected to human investigation; for the theosophic dimension derives also irom an epistemological inquiiy. This theosophical-epistemological dimension, the verticality of Eyn-jof, is altogether divine and human, a ladder for God's thought and man's. This infinite axis invites continuity with, rather than detachment from, the source. It is axiomatic that Eyn-jof, by its veiy nature, cannot be tied to a specific location or direction; it is for this reason that Eyn-jof has been represented as unattainable. This theosophic system is consistent with its theurgic application: the infinite axis between worshiper and Eyn-jof, as the focus of prayer, creates a vertical model of ascent, through which the connection with Eyn-jof is made possible. From that lofty height, Eyn-jof operates beyond any field of vision. But as a governing principle at the edge of the infinite axis, it is in constant interaction with every point in the system. We are thus faced with a notion of Eyn-¿qf in which the infi- nite expansion can immediately be contracted and accessed. Eyn-jof is thus more a spatio-cosmological than theological concept; it belongs to theosophic-theurgical rather than metaphysical discourse. There is a significant difference between Eyn-jof as the end of an expan- sive axis and Eyn-jof as an inaccessible metaprinciple. We may indeed speak of a transcendental concept of infinity within the theosophical framework. As an orientation rather than as an unattainable transcen- dence, Eyn-dof opens up a bridge rather than a chasm. From this point on, the mystic's ability to cross this distance and connect with infinity depends only on his specific theosophical, theurgical, or exegetical tech- nique.</page></plain_text>
