<plain_text><page sequence="1">critical change, where all that is fixed, dogmatic, and categorical is challenged, how could there be? On issues of the day, we can find Romantic spirits on opposing sides: progressive and conserva- tive, democratic and monarchist, religious and agnostic, hoping and despairing, satanic and angelic. (P. 810) In short, while many of her specific remarks on aspects of Romanticism are useful and perceptive, they tend to be lost in the inevitable confusion of her heroic attempt to synthesize the entire modern period under its rubric. This is not the only problem with Gardner's discussion of the modern era. For one thing, her general organiza- tional scheme is arbitrary. Rather than structuring her material around the many convenient watershed dates, she simply devotes separate chapters to the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries. These, in turn, are merely divided into two general parts, "early" and "late." Thus, for her discussion of late-eighteenth-century painting and sculpture we find lumped together, in order of appearance: Clodion, Houdon, Gainsborough, Vigee-Lebrun, Reyn- olds, West, Greuze, Kauffmann, David, Flaxman, Fuseli, Blake, and Piranesi. Canova (1757-1822), for some reason, ends up in the nineteenth century with Greenough, Rude, and Barye. Goya (1746-1828), "because [he is] a transi- tional figure" (p. 815), is also grouped in the nineteenth century, far removed both from other early Romantics and from the Enlightenment. Despite her own observation that with the Enlightenment "the era we call 'modern' begins" (p. 770), her arrange- ment requires that it be discussed in the chapter that ends the section on the Renaissance and Baroque, not in the chapter that opens Part V: The Modern World. Moreover, her introductory remarks on this revolution in thought must therefore precede her commentar- ies on Watteau, Boucher, and Frago- nard, which is misleading at best. More seriously, Gardner's account of recent art and architecture contains a number of surprisingly outmoded and inaccurate assertions. A sampling in- cludes: "Corot and his friends in Barbi- zon were little concerned with the course of events in Paris"; Manet's Bar at the Folies Bergere "is simply an optical event" (p. 843); Monet's series on Rouen Cathedral demonstrates a "scientific precision" (p. 856); Munch was "a moralizing critic of modern man" (p. 875); Matisse remained "faithful to the Fauve principles" (p. 892); Analytic Cubism is an art of "multiple viewpoints" (p. 901); Du- champ's Mona Lisa was "an indirect and witty attack on those he felt had betrayed the Humanistic ideals of the Renaissance" (p. 909); in an Interna- tional Style building "the activities that are to take place in it must dictate its form" (p. 931); in Franz Kline's black- and-white paintings "the quasi-magical shapes ... can be interpreted as the observer pleases" (p. 941); Oldenburg, in his Soft Toilet, "makes fun of our modern dependence on our prized household appliances" (p. 953); and Schnabel, in his broken-plate paintings, "reclaims the great tradition of Medi- eval mosaic" (p. 958). Hartt's and Gardner's books, like those by Janson and Gombrich, are woe- fully inadequate to the task of introduc- ing students to the history of art. That these four texts have been allowed for so long to represent our discipline to the academic community at large should, I think, be a matter of embarrassment to us all. I shall take up the question of the successes and failures of recent rewrit- ings of the canon in a future issue of Art Journal. Notes 1 Gardner produced three editions of the book, the last of which was published in 1948, shortly before her death. Sumner Crosby and several of his colleagues at Yale prepared the fourth edition in 1959. The four editions that have appeared since 1970 have been the work of Horst de la Croix and Richard G. Tansey. The first edition of H. W. Janson's History of Art appeared in 1962; of E. W. Gombrich's Story of Art, in 1950. My review of Janson's and Gombrich's surveys was published in the Spring 1989 Art Journal. 2 Leo Steinberg, "The Philosophical Brothel," Art News, September and October 1972, pp. 20-29, and 38-47. 3 This sentence, from the Introduction, first appeared in the fifth edition (1970) and was written by de la Croix and Tansey. For the sake of convenience, I shall refer to Gardner as the author of the edition under review. Bradford R.

To viewers perplexed by a Cubist paint- ing one can point out elements of form and structure and make comparisons to earlier works, until, if the viewers are sensitive, it begins to make sense; con- fronted with Warhol's Brillo box, on the other hand, one must use a quite dif- ferent kind of explanation, verbal rather than visual. This distinction is crucial to the philosophical debates considered here. Some writers dismiss works like Warhol's as ephemeral, whereas others, like physicists puzzled by aberrant sub- atomic particles, scrutinize them as potential keys to the nature of art. Arthur Danto takes this approach in The Transfiguration of the Common- place (1981), which has provided a focus for recent theory. Danto proposes imaginary works of art, identical to one another, to preexistent works, or to everyday objects, yet each interpretable within a specific artistic context. They lead him to conclude that artworks are "logically dependent on theory" and that aesthetics is irrelevant to their defi- nition.' His legacy (although he himself rejects the linkage) has come to include the "institutional" theory of art, which holds that artistic status depends not on any physical qualities of the artwork itself but on contextual judgments made by relevant agents of the art world.2 Lucian Krukowski picks up the Hege- lian thread in Danto's argument in Art and Concept. As Danto does with his perplexing examples, Krukowski argues for the instability of art, by proposing a modern history of the concept and its "linkages" to other key terms. He applies Hegel's concept of progress to art's rejection of sensuousness; in his view, the anti-art gestures of Dada appear not arbitrary but as logical embodiments of tensions inherent in Western culture. Krukowski traces He- gelianism in the European avant-garde by contrasting Mondrian's social ide- alism and Kandinsky's individualized spirituality, then complements this ac- count by tracing the concept of "form" from its origins in Kant to its role in modern American art. 194 Art Journal</page><page sequence="2">Krukowski, unlike Danto, refuses to lend interpretation priority. In subtle discussions of challenging questions, such as how ethical obligations can preempt aesthetic appreciation, or how artworks "end"-if works can outlast their physical embodiments (as Old St. Peter's survives in the concept of the basilica), can physical embodiments outlast their "works"?-Krukowski re- spects both "theoretic" and "concrete" aspects of art. He warns of our tendency to use too freely works abstracted from their objects by memory or facsimile and scrutinizes the existence claims of such "theoretic entities." Krukowski offers a version of the institutional theory that situates judg- ments of artistic status in a broad social context; hence the importance of ethics and appreciation. Although he accepts, like Danto, works that cannot be appre- ciated (as he argues of twelve-tone mu- sic), he is sensitive to appreciation (or its impossibility) as a central issue and devotes enlightening discussions to au- dience response. His account of the acceptance of new works by "conceptual linkage" seeks likewise to center this process in "our reasons for wanting cer- tain things to be art" (p. 32), rather than in an impersonal system. Krukowski argues that a candidate for art-status appeals to a "tradition class" of relevant antecedent works, which the candidate, if accepted, would extend. Acceptance involves both redefinition or even radical revision of established concepts and a projection of future works it might engender (Krukowski makes clear that this anthropomorphism is merely a con- venient shorthand). Krukowski's theory can encompass works as overtly anti- institutional as Duchamp's Fountain, which has, indeed, been incorporat- ed into the tradition of modernism by links to such antecedents as Cubist collage and to such successors as Rauschenberg. But Krukowski's struggle to strike a balance between theoretical rigor and artistic freedom is not always successful. If Danto proposes (and quickly with- draws) the notion that art is some "alienated form" of philosophy,3 this Hegelian synthesis lurks in the back- ground of both his and Krukowski's accounts. Drawn to art that aspires to Hegelian rigor, Krukowski focuses on the self-consciously theoretical leaders of the avant-garde. While these may best reveal the unstable, "theoretic" character of art, one wishes Krukowski had added to his intelligent discussions of works by Mondrian, Reinhardt, and others one, for example, on Matisse- whose "Rules have no existence outside of individuals,"4 anticipates Krukow- ski's account of Kant on nature and genius. Krukowski's approach risks associating difficulty with importance and neglecting works that are easier to appreciate. On the other hand, Krukowski's intui- tive appeals to "linkage" sometimes require a flexible construal of "concept" (which seems to replace Danto's "im- plicit theories")-a term that evokes Hegelian logic but often functions more broadly, in analyses comparable to the pragmatic aesthetic interpretations of B. R. Tilghman. Art's development, as exemplified in Krukowski's concluding analysis of a Mondrian, can seem closer to Levi-Strauss's bricolage than to Hegel's progress. Krukowski's model resembles the "art system" analyzed by David Car- rier, discussed below, in that both offer open-ended frameworks within which art develops without any necessary his- toric plan. But while Carrier's system, driven by the marketplace, seems to impose its logic on the artwriter, Kru- kowski's preserves a critical role for reason through that force of Hegelian logic still operative in the "concept." Krukowski concludes in broadly human- istic terms: "What concepts could I find or fashion that would discriminate, out of everything presently 'eligible,' those things we wish to make intelligible as art?" (p. 113). But is art "intelligible" only in terms of concepts? Our culture favors the ver- bal and conceptual, yet a Cubist paint- ing also necessitates a visual interpreta- tion. B. R. Tilghman argues this point in But Is It Art?, an occasionally polemical work that takes on not only Danto but, in the sense that it roots itself in Witt- genstein, the larger Hegelian tradition. Tilghman asks what a "theory of art" would accomplish or look like- answering, with support from Wittgen- stein's later writings, that we really don't know, and that, until we do, appeals to theory on the part of art only muddy the waters. Whereas Krukowski finds Hegel fundamental to modern art, Tilghman insists we return to aesthetics; not unexpectedly, he rejects a great deal of the art that Danto and Krukowski think interesting. Tilghman deplores-"a disaster" (p. 120)-the rejection of aesthetics by much modern art, and by Danto. Tilgh- man does not deny that an "artworld background" is essential for interpreta- tion, but for him this sort of knowledge in no way amounts to a theory of art, and it is visual as much as verbal. He agrees with Krukowski that new works must appeal to the past and future, but conceives of such contextual links less grandiosely: What must be insisted upon ... is the centrality of practice, of paint- ing, writing, composing ... on the one hand and the appreciative practices of looking, reading and listening on the other for under- standing talk about art and the disputes and doubts that can arise about the artistic status of things. (P. 66) Tilghman appeals not to some primitive notion of the work itself, but to a body of significant aesthetic experience; he cites Roger Fry's defense of Cezanne, which compared him to the Italian primitives, as an example of how new works can be made accessible to existing modes of appreciation. He doubts that the same can be done for Warhol or Kosuth. Tilghman is witty and telling in his attacks on the philosophical claims often made by artists and critics, but his argu- ment must ultimately rest on shared experience: "[Kosuth's] stance [that the only value of Cubism is the "idea of Cubism"] is not something to be shown to be wrong but something to be deplored. It is simply too bad that there are people who cannot enjoy and appre- ciate a work of art in the way that so many of us do" (p. 87). Although he doesn't attempt to define the aesthetic, Tilghman draws on Wittgenstein's dis- cussion of "aspects" and "secondary senses" to elaborate on the sort of per- ception involved in aesthetic apprecia- tion. Wittgenstein compares "seeing aspects" to recognizing resemblances among family members, and Tilghman associates it with Morelli's and Beren- son's notions of a special sort of vision required for judging art. It bears simi- larity to "secondary senses," nonliteral applications of language like Rimbaud's associations of colors with vowels, and Tilghman argues that such usage can resolve classic disputes about the objec- tivity of aesthetic experience. Along with the basis of aesthetics in "seeing aspects," however, must be accepted the fact that "some people are aware of and sensitive to these things while perhaps the greater number are not" (p. 143). Tilghman can defend his controversial judgments only by appealing to such sensitivity, in hopes that education, especially in the actual making of art, will expand the consensus on which they are based. One imagines Tilghman would en- dorse Matisse and Picasso, whose inno- vations are rooted in traditional studio practice; Matisse's drawings in series, each different but essentially true to its subject, exemplify Wittgenstein's notion of "likeness" (in contrast to Danto's arrays of facsimiles). Unfortunately, Summer 1989 195</page><page sequence="3">Tilghman's condemnations sometimes overstate their case: there is, after all, an aesthetics to mathematics, and this sort of conceptual elegance is relevant to works like Kosuth's (and to other art of the past), whereas Warhol's Brillo box, aside from its appeals to a slick commer- cial aesthetic, could be an American equivalent of Rimbaud's "simple hallu- cination." Moreover, Tilghman's at- tacks on works of the 1960s and 1970s seem dated, especially since current artistic practice is less overtly anti- aesthetic and presents a more difficult target. Yet postmodern concern for older art has not involved the basic reassessment of aesthetics Tilghman demands. His concerns are relevant today, when even the most extreme forms have developed their own institutionalized niches in an artworld that seems more and more a conceptual system closed to the past. This impression emerges from David Carrier's absorbing and provocative Artwriting, for even though Carrier sees rich possibilities in an "art system" that includes "the corpus of artworks, past and present" (p. 106), his analysis can only conclude that the recent vogue of historical styles is just another passing trend. A student of Danto's and a practicing critic, Carrier draws his own implica- tions from Danto's theories for current criticism: "the real distinction is not between suasive and plain accounts, but between more or less successful exer- cises in rhetoric" (p. 129). Carrier sur- veys a provocatively interesting array of writers on art. From Berenson through Gombrich to Greenberg, he traces the development of art-historical narratives; Adrian Stokes and Michael Fried, on the other hand, treat artworks as self- sufficient entities, while the political and semiotic criticism of Rosalind Krauss and Joseph Masheck announce the heterodoxy of our own day. There is a dialectic to this progress, but it con- cludes with Diderot's Hegelian parody, Rameau's Nephew, and the subversion of all authority. Carrier's "model of art as fashion" (p. 137) extends the institu- tional theory by proposing the current apparatus of dealers and museums, which establishes commodity values for contemporary works, as equivalent to the consensus established by the disci- pline of art history with regard to works of the past. Carrier thus provides a framework for art criticism, or "artwrit- ing," as this professionalized practice should now be called. Carrier sets Danto's theories in the realm of practice, as Marx did Hegel's, but without a clear historical implica- tion; for Carrier, we lack a narrative persuasive enough to lend us direction. His own work is artistic, brilliant, and densely textured. With its juxtapositions of conflicting accounts and a history that turns on itself in the end, Artwriting achieves the self-reflective complexity of Cubism: its "Overture," which grounds Carrier's work in Danto's thesis, mirrors the concluding analysis of its own rheto- ric. Since there is no "plain account," its image of the artworld can only emerge from these glancing surfaces, situating Carrier professionally in their midst and representing an artwriter's view of art. One can admire Carrier's writing and still long to rescue him from his own relativism-not that he should offer some unassailable basis for judgments on art, but that he should be able to make a better case against current art fashion; he implies that he disapproves of it (p. 127) but makes it the basis of his system because it offers the only objec- tive framework available for discussion. "System," however, seems too strong a word for the informal, if arbitrary, structures of the artworld (Carrier seems inspired by Barthes's "fashion system," which invites similar objec- tions5). Krukowski, whose argument tends in the same direction, accommo- dates relativism more easily, since for him "we" decide what works to make intelligible. Artist-teachers like Kru- kowski, dismissed by Carrier as hob- byists (p. 110), often exert an influence far greater than their positions in the marketplace would warrant. Education through exposure to works of art, as Tilghman points out, offers our best hope that "agents" of the artworld will make intelligent decisions. The real issue, though, seems to be why this state of affairs should be so elevated philosophically-why should relativism be systematized? Part of the reason seems to lie in Carrier's need for a theory, in his fascination with the conceptual weave of his argument. Dan- to's rejection of aesthetics, meanwhile, leaves Carrier with no strong alternative in perceptual interpretation. Taste and expertise, emphasized by Tilghman, and which Carrier links to Berenson and Greenberg, are "no longer convincing" (p. 113). If aesthetics is disenfranchised, we presumably must learn to appreciate whatever the "art system" presents to us in museums; aesthetics is reduced to fashion, or to some need on the public's part that has little to do with the serious business of art. Tilghman's approach may be of no use in discriminating among ready- mades, but he might reply that Kru- kowski's "conceptual linkage" of a Mondrian to its Cubist antecedents, like Masheck's of Sean Scully to Byzantine icons, are just recent versions of Fry's defense of Cezanne, encumbered by the- oretical armor that only hampers their appeals to our complex experience of art. Tilghman proposes a reasoned alter- native to such conceptual approaches, based on a stronger acknowledgment of art's roots in past practice. His prag- matic aesthetics makes it easier to accept the uncertainty of art criticism and to make sense of the tremendous expansion of our notions of art during the past century, which has seen the incorporation of primitive and folk tra- ditions quite foreign to our own concepts (and of which readymades could be seen as a consequence). If Tilghman's treat- ment of contemporary works is one- sided, this debate begs to be brought to bear on practical criticism, on the arbi- tration of what "we" choose to view as art.
