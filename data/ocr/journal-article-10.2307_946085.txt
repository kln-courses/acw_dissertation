<plain_text><page sequence="1">TEMPO unsung heroes of their musical revolution (although Boulez tells of student performances of Wyschnegradsky's quarter-tone works for two, three, and four pianos in the 1940's and, just before he died in 1979, a commission from the European Broadcasting Union for a string trio-sadly unfinished-brought his name before a world-wide public for the first and only time). While the Almeida concerts (apart from one work by Stravinsky) concentrated on the work of those who chose to remain in the Soviet Union after 1917, all these composers share a kind of spiritual independence which sets them apart from others of their generation; knowing that their music was unlikely ever to be publicly performed, with no critics to comment or to mock, and largely out of touch with fashionable trends, they are refreshingly free from any sense of stylistic doubt. And it is this particular freedom which is the most valuable part of the inheritance bequeathed to their compatriots of the generation born around the I930's and after, nearly all of whom-with the notable exception ofArvo Paart, a recent emigre from Tallin-have succeeded in making a niche for themselves in Soviet musical life (even though prophets of avant-garde music are accorded little honour in that society) and, increasingly, abroad. Of these, Alfred Schnittke (b. 1934) and Edison Denisov (b. 1929) are probably the best known through performances in this country-especially the catholic Schnittke, whose ability to make all styles his own gives his music a quality of almost childlike delight that is peculiarly Russian. Denisov, on the other hand, has forged his own highly individual idiom from elements of a language that might loosely be described as western avant-garde. Of the lesser known living composers featured at the Almeida, Valentin Silvestrov and Sofia Gubaidulina were both born in the I930's, while Elena Firsova, the youngest of the three, is 34 this year. Like Schnittke, Silvestrov is something of an unabashed polystylist although, on the evidence of his Drama for piano trio and two smaller pieces, rather less disciplined in his attitude to form. Like Denisov, Elena Firsova would appear to have chosen to seek her own individuality within a direct line of descent from Webern. Sofia Gubaidulina, till now scarcely heard outside the Soviet Union, has an extraordinarily vivid and wide-ranging musical imagination, matched by an apparently effortless technique: her large-scale violin concerto (not included in the festival) is most impressive. A Hungarian friend, part of a delegation to the Soviet Composers' Union a few years ago, tells of a day spent listening to excerpts from dullish tapes of music by Soviet composers-in the midst of which there was one work which, exceptionally, they wanted to hear from beginning to end. The composer was the then unknown Gubaidulina. 'The Snow Queen'* Peter Cudmore THE SNOW QUEEN is the third one-act opera by David Ward which the BBC has produced; the first that it has commissioned; and in many ways the best. Ten years stand between the composition of each work, and naturally each reveals the growing maturity which years bring. It is difficult to pin down the 'Ward style'. It was once described to me as being in the Maxwell Davies/Birtwistle mould-which it is not, though the composer did *The first performance of David Ward's The Snow Queen, commissioned by BBC Radio 3, was broadcast on 6 August. 40</page><page sequence="2">FIRST PERFORMANCES study with Alexander Goehr; the Irish Times described it (a propos A Full Moon in March) as 'stochastic', which might raise a few eyebrows among followers ofXenakis. Ward himself admires the late romantic opera composers-Wagner, Puccini, etc; and among the living, Boulez and Messiaen, though his style does not reflect the passionate aridity of the former or the nails-and-sledgehammer construction of the latter. It is easy, on the other hand, to identify the concerns which govern Ward's selection of subject matter for his operas. The Snow Queen is adapted from the familiar Hans Christian Anderson story, while The Death of Ferdia, A Full Moon in March, and the full-scale comic opera which he is currently working on,Jack's Engagement (adapted by librettist Kevin Ireland from 'The Cunning Thief, a tale collected byJosephJacobs in Celtic Fairy Tales, 1892) are all taken from Celtic myths. More significantly, each presents a confrontation between naivety and sophistication, frequently with the latter in female guise. The eponymous antiheroine of The Snow Queen actually has much in common with the central character in the Yeats play A Full Moon in March, which Ward set between 1962 and 1968. In both, the confrontation between nalvety and sophistication takes place against a background of winter confronting summer. Anyone who is familiar with the work of Yeats will know of his fondness for the moon, to whose study he devoted a whole book (A Vision, 1928). Its significance in A Full Moon in March is difficult to establish. Perhaps the spring equinox is meant to imply that light confronts dark on equal terms, with light in the ascendant. The play splits into two well-defined sections, which the composer wisely takes into account in his structure, though the obscure symbolism is not treated in depth. Ward's response to the text is not folksy-whimsy as perhaps someone like Bantock's might have been: in fact it is curiously and indefinably English. The musical style might be described as instinctive, with a preference for wood and brass wind instruments which belies the composer's passion for the late romantics (though the concluding passage is firmly in A minor). The Death of Ferdia, which was the first of Ward's operas to be mounted by the BBC (in 1976), is distinctly experimental in character. Ward has the interesting theory that the function of words in an opera is to suggest the emotional colour of a situation and guide the composer's hand. InFerdia, this idea is taken to the ultimate extreme, the whole story being recited in bardic fashion to the accompaniment of repeated harp chords by an actor before the action begins. Thereafter, the characters express themselves through gesture, with the argument carried in the score, and the singers vocalizing on nonsense syllables. The story, extracted from The Tain, concerns the hero Ferdia, who is enticed against his betterjudgement by Queen Medhbh to engage the champion of Ulster in combat (that champion being of course Cuchulainn), and is killed after three days' combat through the intervention of the Badhbh (a supernatural crow) who gives Cuchulainn a spear with which he cannot miss. Although The Death of Ferdia should work splendidly on the stage (given that the singers who portray the combatants do not sound as though they are arguing politely over the last sandwich at the vicar's tea party, as they do in the BBC's recording), it is far from ideal as a radio opera. By contrast, The Snow Queen, which the BBC commissioned specifically as a radio opera, works particularly well. If you were wondering why a fairy tale was being broadcast at 9.40 in the evening-well, the librettist, New Zealand poet Kevin Ireland, has turned it into something of an adult fairy tale. That is not to say that it is either vulgar or obscene-just that the story is told in terms which adults rather than children will understand. The work was conceived and written withjust half an eye on 4I</page><page sequence="3">TEMPO the possibility of entering the finished product for the Prix Italia (the BBC has in fact done so), and so the story chosen is one which will be familiar across Europe. The Snow Queen holds Kay, Greta's sweetheart, under an enchantment. To free him, Greta has to break the enchantment and destroy the power of the Queen, and needless to say is unable to do so unopposed-she encounters the Queen's servant, the Raven; the Prince; and a robber girl, all of whom are sent to block her path (which they fail to do) before she finally defeats them all and is reunited with Kay. The most obvious thing which makes this a radio opera is the way in which a dry resonance is used to colour the Snow Queen, a warm resonance to colour Greta, and a variety of intermediate resonances to depict the influence each has over the rest of the cast. Behind this is a more subtle manipulation of the timbres and ambient distance of the instruments which becomes more apparent as the climax approaches. Ward and producer Stephen Plaistow wanted to avoid the obvious devices of radio drama (chiefly the constant use of sound effects), and the only use these are put to is shortly after the defeat of the Snow Queen, when the music is completely replaced by what one might describe as a musique concrete passage which portrays ice melting into torrents of water-the coming of spring. Musically, The Snow Queen involves a species of sonata form in which, naturally, the conflict that develops is that between the Queen and Greta. The structure is more clearly defined than in the previous operas, and the style more concentrated and mature. At last clear evidence of the composer's love of Verdi and Puccini appears in such gestures as the limpid flourish which introduces Greta. The sound remains a wind-based timbre, so perhaps it is surprising to learn that the BBC has also broadcast a Cello Concerto by Ward, as a result of which Ross Pople (the soloist on that occasion) will shortly be performing a new set of Variations for Cello and Orchestra with the London Festival Orchestra. In The Snow Queen, one of the BBC's more distinguished opera-for-radio commissions, the composer is fortunate to have had at his disposal the London Sinfonietta under Howard Williams, and a distinguished cast-Stephen Varcoe's forelock-tugging (or whatever extremity anthropomorphic birds tug) Raven; Stephen Roberts's oleaginous Prince; Martyn Hill's malleable and confused Kay; Elizabeth Bainbridge's nonplussed Robber Girl; and Teresa Cahill's lyrical and charming Greta-in which DellaJones was outstanding in the title role as the stern and vengeful Snow Queen. 42</page></plain_text>
