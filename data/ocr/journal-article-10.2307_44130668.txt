Exactly as it claims, this is a complete how-to book for what the free-lance photographer probabjy wants to know after he's finished shooting and printing. Ahlers, in this ninth revised edition, includes everything from career options for the potential free lancer and suggestions on appropriate training to domes- tic and foreign markets and how to analyze them, pricing, basic submission procedures, model releases, copyright information, photographic periodicals and reference sources, market listings, and more. Sound practical advice. Bean, Jacob. 17th Century Italian Drawings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1979. Distributed by Harry N. Abrams, Inc., New York. 300 pp. 405 illustrations. $28.50. This volume is an "illustrated inventory" of the Met's 17th-century holdings, from the experi- ments of the Carracci to the late Baroque, the il- lustrations beautifully reproducing the era. High- lights include Annibale Carracci' s Landscape with Jacob Sleeping , Guercino 's Adoration of the Magi, and Salvator Rosa's St. Paul, Hermit , with plenty of other subjects - Old and New Testament, mytho- logical, nudes, portrait heads - by plenty of other artists - including G. B. Castiglione, Pietro da Cortona, and Carlo Maratti - to round out this alphabetically arranged collection. Brief notes, providing bibliographical information and prov- enance, accompany each plate. The purpose, writes curator Jacob Bean, was "to illustrate a rel- atively little-known but important part of our col- lection." The result is that and more - a virtual Baedeker to the Baroque. Blunt, Anthony. The Drawings of Poussin. New Haven, Yale University Press, 1979. 209 pp. 203 illus- trations. $40. "Poussin 's achievement as a draughtsman has been so overshadowed by his work as a painter that although his drawings were already sought after by many collectors in his own time remarkably little has been written about them." Here, Sir Anthony Blunt (coauthor with the late Walter Friedlaender of the two-volume catalogue raisonée of Poussin 's drawings) rights that wrong, taking up "The History of the Draw- ings," "Chronology, Technique and Stylistic Development," "Purpose," "Drawings After the Antique and After Other Masters," and "Pous- sin's Studio," all in a graceful, intelligent prose style. Christian and Greek mythological subjects abound; by far the greatest number of the draw- ings was made as studies for paintings, and, hap- pily, this volume juxtaposes drawings with fin- ished works. Poussin 's drawings are more casual and lively than his Neo-Classic paintings; they are, Blunt notes, "not for public exhibition, they are for holding in the hand and enjoying in the privacy of the study. ..." With this book, you can almost do just that. Brown, Milton W.; Hunter, Sam; Jacobus, John; Rosenblum, Naomi; and Sokol, David M. American Art. New York, Harry N. Abrams, Inc. 1979. 616 pp. 752 illustrations, including 104 in color. $40. Five authors chart the history of American art from its beginnings to the present. Milton Brown of City University begins his section on American art through Eakins with a study of early colonial architecture, picking up portrait painting, land- scape, genre, and sculpture along the way. Texts on the decorative arts by David M. Sokol of the University of Illinois are incorporated here and throughout the volume. Sam Hunter of Princeton then takes up American painting and sculpture in the 20th century. Naomi Rosenblum of Brooklyn College contributes four chapters on photography from Samuel F. B. Morse to Jerry Uelsmann; 20th-century architecture is discussed by John Jacobus of Dartmouth. The volume closes with an up-to-the-minute chapter, "The Dematerialized Object," by Hunter, touching on your favorite Conceptualists from Hans Haacke to Lucas Samaras. This is one of those big, juicy Abrams art-history books that begs to be studied, with pencil underlinings. Whether it will become a classroom classic like H. W. Janson remains to be seen, but all involved have made every effort in that direction. Capa, Cornell, editor. Photography: Venice '79. New York, Rizzoli International, 1979. 404 pp. 362 il- lustrations, 51 in color. $30. This volume has been published in conjunction with the three-month event Fotografia: Venezia '79 held in Italy this summer. It is all-inclusive in scope, with 25 illus- trated essays and photographs running from one of Lewis Carroll's little nude girls to Lucas Sam- aras' Autopolaroids. Essays include Naomi Ros- enblum on Lewis Hine, R. F. Martinez on Eugène Atget, Beth Urdang on Alfred Stieglitz, and Peter C. Bunnell on Diane Arbus, to name a few. Theme essays include "Fleeting Gestures: Treasures of Dance Photography," "Eye of the Beholder: The World in Color," and "Explora- tion of a Medium: The Polaroid Collection." A potpourri that is not chaotic but - due to strong texts and good organization - illuminating. Cohen, Morton N. Lewis Carroll, Photographer of Children: Four Nude Studies. Philadelphia, Rosenbach Foundation/ New York, Clarkson N. Potter, Inc., 1979. Distributed by Crown Publishers, New York. 32 pp. $10. In the Victorian era, there were two ways of viewing children: the Evangelical, that they were creatures of original sin, easily prey to the devil, and the Romantic, that children were, liter- ally, the gift of God, virgin and uncorrupted. "Dodgson held this second attitude," writes Mor- ton Cohen. The four hand-colored photographs of nude little girls by Charles Dodgson, alias Lewis Carroll, certainly are indicative of a Romanticiza- tion of their subjects, who are seen on sea-swept rocks or in idyllic countrysides. Cohen's text thor- oughly elaborates the history of the photographs - hundreds were taken, but Dodgson discreetly had the negatives destroyed, leaving only these four from family collections. The author, though a Carroll scholar, despairs of exploring the psycho- sexual implications, citing Dodgson 's "whimsy" in the matter, and his deep love of God. Christo. Christo: Wrapped Walkways, Loose Park, Kansas City, Missouri, 1977-78. New York, Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1979. 90pp. 150 illustrations, including 70 in color. $20. A beautiful idea - wrapping all the walkways in Loose Park, Kansas City, in saffron- colored nylon - is given handsome treatment. The project was "supremely romantic in feeling," and this document follows suit. An essay by Ellen Goheen of the Nelson Gallery, Atkins Museum, discusses earlier projects, events surrounding the installation, and the installation itself. Pictures, documents, and plans tell the story better than words, showing the formal garden paths and jog- ging trails swathed in the "luminous and pleasur- able" fabric, pedestrians continuing to use the paths even after they had been wrapped. "The most public and yet most intimate project he has done to date," writes Goheen, and both these as- pects of the Wrapped Walkways are material for a fine photographic study. Some of the 70 color pho- tographs - by Wolfgang Volz - are artworks in themselves. There's even a swatch of fabric in- cluded. Dunlop, Ian. Degas. New York, Harper &amp; Row, 1979. 240 pp. 205 illustrations, including 45 in color. $37. 50. The subject has been overdone, but this is a better-than-average effort, due to good-quality reproductions and the fact-filled, literate text. Il- lustrations have been well researched - when Dunlop discusses The Bellelli Family in relation to a minor work by Augustus Egg, that minor work is reproduced, at a good size, along with the major one. Filled, too, with sketches and studies from Degas' notebooks, just as the text is filled with good samplings from contemporary documents. The author, incidentally, is head of the contem- porary art department at Sotheby Parke Bernet, New York. Edgerton, Harold E., and Killian, Jr., James R. Moments of Vision: The Stroboscopie Revolution in Photography. Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press, 1979. 177 pp. 144 illustrations, including 13 in color. $20. Edgerton, dubbed "Papa Flash" by Jacques Cousteau and the crew onboard Calypso , on which Edgerton made ten voyages to do underwater pho- tography, developed "the first modern strobo- scope" in the 1930s and then put it to extensive use investigating motion photographically. A bio- graphical essay by Killian on Edgerton 's achieve- ments as inventor and photographer, including a short history of high-speed photography (Talbot patented a flash method in 1851), adds needed weight to the volume's primary role of picture book and tribute. Problems arise when Killian calls Edgerton's photos art and then tries to justify it, but perspective returns as soon as Killian gets back to Edgerton the explorer, the scientist, the man behind stroboscopic photography. If you're interested in such roots and want to see what are by now familiar pictures, this might be for you. Estrin, Mary Lloyd. To the Manor Born. Boston. Little, Brown (a New York Graphic Society Book), 1979. 115 pp. 70 photographs. $22.50. Los Angeles-based photographer Estrin returned to her hometown of Lake Forest, Illinois, for these studies of the rich in their natural habitats - in perfect living rooms, paneled libraries, ornate bathrooms, at the sta- bles, in indoor tennis courts, on the grounds. "Not even the privileges of wealth can stay the hand of fate," writes sociologist Robert Coles in his introduction, and it's true - Estrin's subjects are all discernibly human. But a subtle pride - of place? position? - beams through all the faces, young and old; these photographs are as revealing of the monied, in their way, as Walker Evans' were of the poor. There's a Gatsbyesque pleasure in studying the rich, for they do, indeed, seem dif- ferent - it's their aura, or the aura Estrin has brought to them. For sociocultural voyeurs, here are the real beautiful people, not all beautiful, not all even handsome, but all set apart. Feigenbaum, Gail, and Martin, John Rupert. Van Dyck as Religious Artist. Princeton, Art Museum, Princeton University, 1979. Distributed by Princeton University Press. 177 pp., 99 illustrations. $28.50 cloth ; $13. 50 paper. Although van Dyck is thought of principally as a portraitist, the artist was also at- tracted to religious subjects, as this catalogue to an exhibition last spring at the Princeton Art Muse- um makes abundantly clear. Fifty studies, prepar- atory drawings, and oils on such themes as Carry- ing of the Cross , the Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine , and St. Sebastian Bound for Martyrdom leave little doubt that van Dyck 's imagination ran to sacred 170</page><page sequence="2">Alex Katz, Gerrit , pencil (15x25 in.), 1975. Georgia Museum of Art, University of Georgia, Athens. history. What is unique about these works is their lack of pietism - indeed, their humanism. For van Dyck, museum director Fred S. Licht points out in his foreword, 4 'the difference between the human race and the race of angels and saints is only a matter of degree." A beautiful job, from the general essay by John Rupert Martin and Gail Feigenbaum, through the high-quality reproduc- tions to the incisive catalogue notices. Too little color is the only complaint. Flora, Paul. Penthouse. New York , Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1979. 59 pp. 53 illustrations. $6.95. Flora, politicali cartoonist for the Hamburg weekly Die Zeit for 14 years, is represented with a collection of densely cross-hatched pen and ink drawings of city buildings topped by bizarre ' 'penthouses" - a treehouse, a country cottage, a Hotel des Alpes, a haunted house, a graveyard, an ark. It's impossi- ble not to make comparisons with Saul Steinberg, but Flora is less metaphysical, more single- minded in his savage, surreal wit. There are, in fact, shades of Charles Addams here. An oddity, but a perusable one. Gilmour, Pat. Understanding Prints: A Contemporary Guide. London, Waddington Galleries Ltd., 1979. 80 pp. 58 illustrations. £2.95. Gilmour provides a clearly written basic text on the techniques, his- tory, and market of the graphic media. It's a thor- ough guide, too: included are sections on relief and intaglio, lithography, screenprinting, and all their offshoots, recent developments in materials and techniques, the print market and what affects prices, a glossary (of both technical terms and notes on selected artists, movements, institutions, organizations), and an introduction to the history and purpose of prints. Contemporary artists' works - most from the 1970s - are the primary ex- amples chosen, and are illustrated in both full- image and enlarged-detail formats. Gilmour is decidedly pro good art for the masses, but aside from such wanderings this is a readable - if whirlwind - tour for the novice, attractively designed. Harding, James. The Pre-Raphaelites. New York, Rizzoli International, 1979. 96 pp. 112 illustrations, 18 in color. $7.95. Basically a picture book, al- though two essays and 20 biographies attempt to briefly explore the Pre-Raphaelite phenomenon. The best that can be said for the thin text is that it covers artists not always associated with the move- ment; as picture books go, this one is less than ex- ceptional. The illustrations are dreadful, even if many are reproduced double- or full-page. Hendricks, Gordon. The Life and Work of Winslow Homer. New York, Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1979. 346 pp. 440 illustrations, including 68 in color. $45. What can you say against a book that opens with color reproductions of paintings by its subject's mother, and determines, for the first time, that Winslow was named after his parents' Congregai ionalist pastor? This looks like the definitive Homer book, crowding out Lloyd Goodrich's by dint of its sheer painstaking accuracy and elegance and wit of style - the famous Gulf Stream , we are told, "was not snapped up. " The volume covers the man and his art in detail, from a childhood drawing through his years as "America's most celebrated painter," who appealed to educated and popular taste alike. Correspondence and criticism of the day are included in abundance; many of the ac- companying illustrations are photographs of docu- mentary importance, and the color reproductions are excellent. As a Christmas gift, this should keep them busy until Easter. Henn, Harry G. Copyright Primer. New York, Prac- tising Law Institute, 1979. 785 pp. $40. Every- thing - copyrights distinguished from patents and trademarks, copyrights and the Constitution, "exclusive" and "limited" times, nonprotectable matter, duration - you ever wanted to know on the subject, and a lot more. Given the length and price of this volume, you might want to ask a lawyer friend. Then again, he might have to refer to Copyright Primer. Lane, Richard. Images from the Floating World: The Japanese Print. New York, G. P. Putnam 's Sons, 1 978. 364 pp. Over 900 illustrations, including over 30 in col- or. $60. "Ukiyo-e was a hybrid school of painting and print design that took its basic themes from the day-to-day world," writes author Lane, "but adapted many classical methods to the treatment of its new subjects." Ukiyo-e was also, Lane tells us, for the two-and-a-half centuries during its ex- istence during the Edo period (1600-1868), an ex- tremely popular art - "That such popularization did not result in vulgarization is one of the won- ders of the art world." There are wonders to be had in this book, too, uppermost among them a fact-filled, very intelligent text tracing ukiyo-e from its early beginnings as the art of depicting courtesans and kabuki to its relation to the rise of woodblock printing as a mass art form, to land- scape and genre, through the medium's decline after Perry's opening of Japan to the West. An "Illustrated Dictionary of Ukiyo-e" follows with masses of information, including names of masters (with selected print series illustrated), technical terms, and translations of all sorts of Japanese words relating to the field. This is an altogether thorough and rewarding guide to the subject, filled to overflow with well-captioned, high- quality reproductions. Recommended. Livingston, Jane. M. Alvarez Bravo. Boston, David R. Godine/ Washington, Corcoran Gallery of Art, 1978. 45 pp. 82 plates. $25. Jane Livingston eschews biography - it is "treated at length in the chronol- ogy" - to "examine the work itself, placing it within the Mexican ethos and within the context of the history of photography. ' ' This she does by discussing influences - the political art of Orozco and Rivera, as well as Strand, Weston, and C artier-Bresson - "coexisting levels of meaning," color, the recent palladium prints, and Bravo 's "poetic use of visual as well as verbal imagery," creating "elusive iconologies" of images. Alex Castro then treats "Alvarez Bravo &amp; Mexico" in a short essay, and 82 well-reproduced plates attest both to Bravo 's indebtedness to his native land for material and his photographic genius. Sections from an interview from Thomas Cooper and Paul Hill's Dialogue with Photography are included in the biographical notes, and the chronology - docu- mentation is by Francis Fralin - is indeed exten- sive. Not the final word on Bravo, but a strong statement nevertheless. Lucie-Smith, Edward. Super Realism. Oxford, Phaidon, 1979. Distributed by E. P. Dutton, New York. 80 pp. 67 illustrations, 28 in color. $14.95. A real contribution to a subject on which there are few books. Lucie-Smith describes Super Realism as both "a logical extension of what American mod- ernism has achieved in the years after 1945, and a deliberate rejection of it," an important point that is pursued throughout. Aside from the critical clarity on his subject, the author excels at tracing art-historical roots: Super Realism is sillied to 19th-century trompe-l'oeil, American Preci- sionism of the '20s, Edward Hopper, and even Andrew Wyeth. European forebears include van Eyck's Arnolfini Wedding , Caravaggio, Vermeer, Canaletto (interestingly, Richard Estes poses this comparison himself), and Millet. Individual art- ists - Chuck Close, Ralph Goings, Audrey Flack, Robert Cottingham, and many others - are dis- cussed, and the cults of the car and motorcycle and kitsch taken into account. Resemblances to film, Surrealism, and, of course, the photograph are explored, the book ending with a discussion of Super Realist sculpture. A thoughtful, provoca- tive analysis of the subject, and reproductions, though not of the best quality, are well researched, well placed in the text, and seminal. Martin, Marianne W. Futurist Art and Theory, 1909-1915. New York, Hacker Art Books, 1978. 229 pp. 234 illustrations. $40. This is a reprint, with a new introduction by the author, of the important 1968 work on the little-explored territory of Futur- ist art, today perceived as not a Fascist outgrowth but a "significant link in the modern tradition. ..." Martin begins her treatise not with the 171</page><page sequence="3">founding of Futurism in 1909 by poet F. T. Marinetti, but with "Painting and Sculpture in Italy During the Later Nineteenth Century," bent on proving that Futurism was not a "belated and final paroxysm" of the Romantic movement. Subsequent chapters deal with the Futurist aesthetic theory, and its sources, and individual artists like Boccioni, Carrà, Russolo, Severini, and Balla. Martin writes in a clean, no-nonsense style; one of her more important contributions is to chart similarities and differences between Futurism and Cubism. A valuable volume that should be welcomed back to the shelves. Millais, Geoffroy, Sir John Everett Millais. New York , Rizzoli International, 1979. 96 pp. 100 illustra- tions, 21 in color. 19. 95. An abundantly illustrated appraisal of the life and work of the "eminent Vic- torian" by his great-grandson, covering his years as one of the cofounders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to his enormous popularity as a painter of portraits and genre scenes, the latter half of his career including a baronetcy and presi- dency of the Royal Academy. An interesting, anecdotal "Memories of Millais" conversation between his grandson Sir William James and Millais expert Mary- Luytens opens the book - very BBC, from whence it hails. Then comes a slightly fawning text and 100 illustrations, 16 in color. Fun despite - or maybe because of - Millais' disrepute among us moderns. New Orleans Museum of Art. Diverse Images: Pho- tographs from the New Orleans Museum of Art. Garden City, New York, Amphoto, 1979. 127 pp. 96 photo- graphs. $19.95 cloth; $ 9.95 paper. "Diverse" is the key word here, with photographs by Berenice Ab- bott, Imogen Cunningham, Alfred Stieglitz, Ed- ward Weston, and practically every other photo- graphic great you can name. Along with the quan- tity of images comes an introduction by photog- raphy curator Tina Freeman. "Photography, be- ing a new medium," she writes, "is not set in its ways. Ponderous critical works are yet to be writ- ten." Apparently not wishing to be ponderous, she goes on to state simply that "the photograph has become a window into the psyche." There are 96 "windows into the psyche" in all, well repro- duced in good duotone lithography, but adding up to a confusing babble of visions. A list of photo- graphs illustrated and an accounting of photos in the permanent collection closes the book. O'Keeffe, Georgia. Georgia O'Keeffe: A Portrait by Alfred Stieglitz. New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1979. Distributed by Viking Press, New York. 121 pp. 51 photographs. $35. The two giants of American modernism met in the spring of 1916 at the 291 Gallery, after O'Keeffe heard that Stieglitz was showing her drawings without her consent. Over a period of 30 years they became fast friends (and, in 1924, husband and wife), Stieglitz launching this "portrait" of O'Keeffe, which to him meant a multitude of portraits. We see the painter in every conceivable mood - grave, smiling, serene, pen- sive, half-naked, in bowler hat, beside a tree. A front-of-the-book reminiscence is by the lady her- self, who is too modest to mention that hers is one of the truly great faces, with beauty and character enough to make Garbo look like a Goldwyn girl. Patton, Tom. The Isolation and Intrusion Series. San Mateo, California, Lunar Press, 1979. 21 pp. 19 photo- graphs. $6; $6.50 by mail. Each of Patton 's photo- graphs is definitely expressive of an "isolation and intrusion" theme - an expanse of ocean with a tiny swimmer's head bobbing in the midground, calm hills and sea cut diagonally by a girder and telephone wires, the arm of a cactus jutting across the upper foreground of a scrubby mesa, the tops of two horse's heads showing before a cloud- flecked sky. The aesthetic of these photos is remi- niscent of Zen, writes Dana Asbury in a brief, but acute, introduction: "for some, these photographs are calming, for others, disturbing in their mute presence." Whatever the viewer's emotional response, each picture has a quietistic beauty well served by layout and reproduction quality. Quinn, Edward, editor, and Tassi, Roberto. Graham Sutherland: Complete Graphic Work. New York, Rizzoli International, 1979. 208 pp. 218 illustrations, 122 in color. $50. Sutherland's graphic work is quirky, to say the least. It ranges from fairly aca- demic portrait heads of Helena Rubinstein and Somerset Maugham to anthropomorphic evoca- tions of rocks and cathedrals to meticulously gro- tesque studies of insects. The introduction to this volume treats Sutherland as the master one isn't sure he is, tracing his evolution from his first pic- turesque etchings of the '20s through the Matisse- and Picasso-inspired lithos of the '40s through the "Welsh" period - concentrating on rocks and trees - of the '70s. Everything you could want to know about the graphic work - but who asked? Rathbone, Belinda, editor. One of a Kind: Recent Polaroid Color Photography. Boston, David R. Godine, 1979. 77 pp. 72 color photographs. $25 until December 31; $30 thereafter. The idea for this book - "to re- produce the best work of the best photographers who have been working with Polaroid color film" - is more engaging than the results. An in- troduction, or apologia, by Eugenia Parry Janis called "A Still Life Instinct: The Color Photog- rapher as Epicurean" presents intellectual creden- tials for the Polaroid revolution. Then follows work by 32 photographers, some, like Marie Cosindas and Lucas Samaras, associated with Polaroid, others, like Arnold Newman and Ansel Adams, not. All of them - even more restrained subjects by David Hockney or Willard Van Dyke - suffer from the flashbulb intensity peculiar to Polaroid film. Parry brushes off the sensation- alism of it all as being characteristically Ameri- can - "a sense of material richness." But her des- cription of Polaroid color as being in "exquisite taste" is simply wrong. Even the single Ansel Adams shot of Point Lobos, California, comes across as being disintictly tasteless. Perhaps the most interesting and successful works in the book are those of Peter Von Zur Muehlen, where mun- dane objects - a black-paint-splattered column, for instance - are photographed with simplicity and a sense of formal grace. Dan Rodan, who uses the vulgarity of the medium to his advantage, suc- ceeds, too, in his shots of a black Narcissus gazing at his reflection in a glass of water or in Hypnos , a blond beauty against red velvet in black party mask. But too many of the other photographers come across as just plain vulgar, no matter their fame. Sandler, Irving. Alex Katz. New York, Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1979. 222 pp. 220 illustrations, 72 in color. $55. Katz' approach to representation, ac- cording to Irving Sandler, tries "to synthesize two of the major, and seemingly irreconcilable, ten- dencies in modern art: truth to the perception of the real, three-dimensional world (the truth of a Courbet, for example), and truth to the medi- um - in painting, to the picture as a real, two- dimensional object (the truth of a Gauguin)." In a text studded with many such cogent observations, Sandler traces Katz' genesis from a student at Cooper Union to a gestural painter hanging out at the Cedar Tavern in the '50s to today's portraitist of good-looking family and friends, poets and crit- ics, all caught larger-than-life in their search for their visual, and perhaps their existential, iden- tities. But the atmosphere is never insular; Sand- ler's enlightening text and Katz' generosity of vi- sion see to that. An extremely well-done effort, essay, layout, and reproductions combining to make one of the most balanced appreciations of a contemporary artist in a long time. Schiff, Gert. Images of Horror and Fantasy. New York, Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1979. 159 pp. 138 illustra- tions, including 52 in color. $19.95. "In full posses- sion of material wealth," writes Schiff, "men and women today are still subject to fear." Based on a 1977 exhibition at the Bronx Museum of Arts, Schiff has drawn on artworks from over the cen- turies to create a text that explores the horrible and fantastic in every conceivable mode, includ- ing "Religion/Superstitution," "Sex/Sadism," "Death," and "Dream." As might be expected, Goya, Ensor, and Munch abound, but there is no shortage of artists not generally associated with the horrific - de Kooning, Larry Rivers, and Jasper Johns appear, too, Schiff thoroughly ex- ploring the historical, aesthetic, and psychological ramifications of each work. One of the more inter- esting recent ideas for an art book, well realized in Schiffs impassioned prose. Seymour, Gabriel North. Marcel Proust's Combray. Salisbury, Connecticut, Lime Rock Press, 1979. 160 pp. 71 photographs. $32.50. Photographer Gabriel Sey- mour traveled to the little French town of Illiers- Combray to photograph the house of Proust's Aunt Elizabeth, where much of Remembrance of Things Past is set. The photographs have been paired with the French text and C. K. Scott Mon- crieffs English translation of the Combray sec- tions of Remembrance ; when Marcel talks about his beloved magic lantern, we see that lantern on a night table; when he talks about the endless flight of stairs leading to his bedroom, we see the stairs. A nice idea, perhaps, but Proust's prose is, as always, so riveting that it's rather hard to look at the pictures. And when one does, there's disap- pointment: the photographs are static, often blurry renderings, and too literal for the delicate sensationalism of Proust's writing. Spalding, Frances. Whistler. Oxford, Phaidon, 1979. Distributed by E. P. Dutton, New York. 80 pp. 71 illustrations, 28 in color. $14.95. The text - a chipper and readable biographical and critical ac- count of Whistler's dedicatedly Bohemian youth, his idols Courbet and Velasquez, his intense love of music (thus all those "Arrangements" and "Nocturnes"), his ruinous court case against John Ruskin - is accompanied by good reproduc- tions of drawings and paintings, a generous 28 of them in color. For the layman, not the scholar. Stern, Stewart. Fred Picker. Garden City. New York, Amphoto, 1979. 166pp. 79 illustrations. $12.50. This volume accompanied an exhibition at the Praka- pas Gallery, New York, in June 1979. Picker ab- stracts universalist statements out of landscapes and portraits: a Megalithic Tomb in Ireland, snows in Vermont, country stores in Maine, Christian icons on Easter Island, actress Patricia Neal in London. These are solid, workmanlike photo- graphs that display an eye for what James Agee describes as "the cruel radiance of what is." Un- fortunately, this book has no text but the quote from Agee and a too rhapsodic statement by Stewart Stern. Another complaint: there is a monotonous sameness to the photographs. Perhaps some editing was needed. Stevenson, George A. Graphic Arts Encyclopedia. 172</page><page sequence="4">New York, McGraw-Hill, 1979. 483 pp. 294 illustra- tions. $24. 95. An extremely thorough technical en- cyclopedia covering all aspects of reproduction of words and pictures, from AA's (author's altera- tions) to zinc halftones. Included are an extensive bibliography, a product index, and a manufac- turer's index, along with copious charts, tables, diagrams, and photographs illustrating points made in the text. This is a second, updated edi- tion, and there are new entries on electronic ad- vances in the graphics field. Definitive of its kind. Wilfer, Joseph. Marko Spalatiti: Graphic Work 1968-78. Madison, Wisconsin, Madison Art Center, 1979. Ill pp. 200 illustrations, including 83 color plates. $20. A collection of the screenprints of a rel- atively unknown 3 3 -year-old painter who was honored with a show of same at the Madison Art Center in January of 1977. Early work looks like Rauschenberg; more mature productions seem to have been heavily influenced by Vasarely. Spala- tin's images are similarly 3-D geometric, yet they are used in less Op, more fantastic ways, to create compositions that resemble, says center director Joseph Wilfer in his introduction, ' 'architectonic forms as viewed from the window of an intergalac- tic spaceship or . . . abstract still lifes." Spalatin does indeed have a way with geometric forms and outer-space colors, but the devotion of an entire book to his graphics seems slightly inexplicable at this point in his career.</page></plain_text>
