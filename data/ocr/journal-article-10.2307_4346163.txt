<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRE-SOCRATIC STUDIES, 1953-1966* The pre-Socratics have come into their own in the years here surveyed; by far the most noticeable characteristic of the literature is its ever-increasing volume. To be sure, there are neglected areas, but surely the period as a whole has been studied as never before.' In my earlier survey I wrote: "A preliminary bibliographical survey yielded a list of about 190 items which seemed to demand treatment; from these a selection has been made" (p. 161). This time, at a similar stage of the work the number of cards in my file was somewhat over 1200-a stunning difference, even considering that the period cover- ed was about twice as long! Is too much being published in this field? Unquestionably, one often thinks, "Was this arti- cle necessary?" or "Why was this article spun out to book length?"- or one may even fall to musing over the "publish or perish" controversy. Not more often though, I should hazard, than in other fields; and there are some contrary considerations: (a) The nature of the subject and of the evidence both demand conjecture and dis- cussion. Very few of these studies can be judged with mathematical certainty, and even where there are demonstrable errors of detail or im- possible flights of fancy, there may be a whole- some incitement to further study. (b) Secondly, there are still many unsolved problems, right down to the character and value of the ancient doxography, and a continuing need to evaluate early Greek thinkers for themselves and not merely as preliminary to something else. (c) What is more, it is becoming more and more feasible (and popular) for modern philosophers to enter directly into discussion with these vigor- ous predecessors. In addition to this vast burgeoning of original material, surely an outstanding phenomenon of the whole post-war era is the availability, through new printing techniques and the "paper- back revolution," of a tremendous number of reprints. Not even a sample of these will be listed here, but it must be emphasized that the scholar and teacher are in a very different situa- tion from that of a few years ago. He may own reprints not only of standard works of reference (Burnet's EGP, Zeller's Outlines and Ph.d.Gr., Kern's OF, Cherniss' Presoc.), but also many more specialized studies. A considerable number of new classical and philosophical journals have appeared, hospitable to articles in this field, notably Phronesis: A journal for ancient philosophy (from 1955, now in its eleventh volume); and organizations like the Society for Ancient Greek Philosophy (found- ed 1953) have provided opportunity for the cir- culation and discussion of views on pre-Socratic problems. The aim of such a survey as this must be, I suppose, to save some specialists some time, and to present the non-specialist with a survey which will not be seriously misleading. Any ap- proximation to bibliographical completeness is * I wish to acknowledge help: from many friends, notably those who sent me offprints; from various librarians; from the Graduate Council Research Fund of DePauw University; and from several con- scientious student assistants, most notably Mrs. Anne M. Elmore. 1. My earlier survey (CW 47 [1953-54] 161-170, 177-182), published in 1954, covered the years 1945- 52, with a good many entries from 1953 and a few from 1954. This one completes the coverage of 1953, and was finished in the summer of 1966. The bib- liography is of course based primarily on L'annde philologique; the last volume of this which was available was Vol. 35, for the year 1964. Coverage of 1965 and 1966 is naturally less complete. I retain the spelling "pre-Socratic," which seems to conform to usual English practice for such compounds, though "Presocratic" (a translation of Vorsokratiker?) is used by some influential writers and good stylists. Professor Minar's article is No. 43 in the C W Survey Series. For a complete list of the earlier surveys, in Vols. 46-59, see CW 59 (1965-66) 73; to which now add Prof. R. J. Rowland, Jr.'s "A Sur- vey of Selected Ciceronian Bibliography, 1953-1965," CW 60 (1966-67) 51-65, 101-115. Prof. H. W. Mil- ler's "Euripidean Drama, 1955-1965," continuing his earlier survey [of the literature of 1940-1954] in CW 49 (1955-56), will appear in the January issue.

I relentlessly set aside many "notes," or even longer papers, devoted to narrower points of text-criticism or interpretation; these will be found and must be evaluated by the specialist, who will be making his own bibliography any- way. Also omitted are many of the articles which appeared as preliminaries or by-products of books. On the other hand, where it might save someone time, I have occasionally included pieces whose quality seemed low. (One is seldom in doubt whether to search out an item entitled "A note on Heraclitus fr. 77," but what of one call- ed "Heraclitus of Ephesus"?) The following are (with some exceptions) also omitted: populariza- tions; general histories of philosophy or of Greek philosophy, unless they have something original or especially interesting on the pre-Socratics; reviews (with regret: many are very substantial; see especially Gn); medicine; technology; most science and mathematics; and contributions in languages with which I am not familiar. A general trend is obvious toward an increase in scholarly publication from Eastern European countries. (N.B. no. 4 below; some of this mate- rial is available in German, English, or French.) There is also more publication in Spanish, and some in Japanese. Sometimes I have appended to the notice of a book or article such a remark as "five other articles on this subject." This is not to be understood as offering a guaranteed count, nor primarily as a compliment to the writer, but as a hint that whoever is interested can find more in APh. If some of my summar ies seem to be based closely on those of APh, this is because they often began as such. Being neither didymous nor chal- centerous, I make no claim to have read every word of the books and articles here listed. Each has, however, been subjected to some degree of autopsy, except where the asterisk (*) indicates that somne- thing is included which, though unseen, seems likelv to be important. I hold to the abbreviations of APh; the excep- tions are from not aspirating English initials cor- responding to Greek aspirates (e.g., AJP not AJPh, HSCP not HSPh; but I keep the familiar RhM, Ph, etc.) Note also Phro)i for Phronesis, and for the philosophers themselves Anaxg-Anaxagoi:as, Anaxn=Anaximenes, AnaxdzcAnaximander, Her (aclitus), Xens-Xenophanes. The rest are easy. DK is no. 8, KR no. 10. I. GENERALIA Bibliography 1.

The Italian series (9) is very useful as a supplement to DK, giving not only full introductions and commentaries, but trans- lation of the testimonianze as well as of the frammenti proper. The arrangement conveniently follows that of DK, though new material is often added. There are excellent bibliographies. The type is rather small and the price rather high.

Allen (11) uses the KR translation for pre-Socratic fragments (pp. 1-56). Many more texts and translations will be found below with the in- dividual philosophers. Wheelwright (15) will be very useful to teachers, especially teachers of the critical but Greekless. Problenms, Sources 19.

Grundprobleme (19) is an interesting and stimulating discussion arranged by topics rather than chronologically. Axelos (20) approaches his problem from various angles, and points to several ways in which moderns find it profitable to "enter into dialogue" with the pre-Socratics. Kerferd (21), in an inaugural lecture, offers some general remarks on the pleasures, values, and hazards of studying Greek thought. Popper's presidential address (22) was a vigorous state- ment, in his customary forthright and emphatic manner, of the historical value and the continu- ing importance of the pre-Socratics, with em- phasis on their rationalism and the origin of the critical tradition. (His earlier essay l 23 1 has much interesting material.) Kirk, whose in- terpretations in KR had seemed to Popper to banalize or trivialize Her. and others, sprang to the defence (24), emphasizing that a certain amount of sense-perception, observation, perhaps even induction, must precede the intuition or conjecture with which P. contends that scienti- fic activity begins. In his 1961 article (25) he maintained that with very few exceptions the Greek thinkers were constantly striving to avoid or surmount the improbable and to base their theories on direct experience and common sense. Popper had presumably not seen this when he wrote his rejoinder to Kirk in the appendix to his reprint of C&amp;R (no. 22). Guthrie (27) de- fended Aristotle against what seemed to him the hypercritical attack by Cherniss and then by McDiarmid (HSCP 1953) on his credibility as a historian, and of course carried on this point of view in his history (29 below). There is much more to read than is suggested here, embedded in various books and articles, about the problems, methods, and sources for pre-Socratic study. Histories, Collected Essays 29. Guthrie, W.

(*) Treatment of the pre-Socratic period in Gu- thrie's monumental history (29) will be com- pleted with his account of the Sophists in volume 3. This work will stand as a landmark in scholar- ship; it can scarcely be definitive, but treats in considerable detail most of the many particular problems, while keeping in perspective the tra- dition as a whole. It is the first secondary source to consult on the topics covered in this survey. Though brief (119 pp.) and easy to read, no. 30 is not a popularization. It is based on long study and thorough knowledge (several of B.'s articles are omitted here), and offers various provoca- tive interpretations. (For example, was there one Xenophanes or two?) Thomson (31) ranges wide, in a discursive (but well-written, as usual) attempt to interpret early Greek philosophy, in the light of one kind of Marxist analysis, as expressing "the outlook of a class engaged in the exchange of commodities" (p. 338), through "the new economic and social relations brought into being by the circulation of money" (ibid.). Though most critics reject the main thesis, he is learned and often illuminating. Both Brumbaugh's book (32) and Fr. Owens' (33), though they range beyond our period (the former only through Aristotle) are included as enthusiastic and interesting accounts, based on study of the original sources and wide familiar- ity with the recent literature. Both devote more space to the pre-Socratics than is usual in a textbook. To judge by the advance publicity and by his Anaxagoras (1949), Cleve's new book (34) should be vigorous and controversial. I list Fraenkel's collection (35), though all the studies included antedate our period, because of revis- ions and extensions, and because it is so fre- quently cited in the literature. The second edition has four additional pieces, including the import- ant "Xenophanesstudien" (1925). The posthu-m- ous Frank collection (36) has not only some previously unpublished essays, including "The religious origin of Greek philosophy" (70-85), but a moving account by Edelstein of "Erich Frank's work" (pp. 407-465). The Greeks (37) has some good things on various pre-Socratics in the chapters by G. S. Kirk (science), A. H. Armstrong (philosophy), and G. Huxley (mathe- matics). The late Prof. Salomo Luria brought together (39) essays on several pre-Socratic topics, thought of as making an introduction to a study of Democritus. Cosmology, Cosmogony 41.

L., "Three Presocratic cosmologies," CQ 56 (1963) 154-176. Kranz (41) has followed previous shorter articles on the subject with a comprehensive presentation. Schwabl's truly encyclopedic survey (42) devotes columns 1433-1538 to the pre- Socratics; the article is followed by an "Anhang: Iranische Kosmogonien," by J. Duchesne-Guille- min. Kerschensteiner (43) follows the develop- ment of the term kosmos from "order, arrange- ment, ordering" to "world, universe," judging the mode of development from the primary sub- stance to be an important clue. The climax of the development is in Plato's Timaeus. She is so thorough and careful in the treatment of source-material (see her sub-title) that this al- most becomes a general treatise on pre-Socratic philosophy. Under this title with slight varia- tions, Boussoulas (44) published a series of articles (in the latter fifties, in RMM, BAGB, and other journals), in which he discussed sep- arately various pre-Socratic systems (Pyth's, Her., Parm. twice, Emp., atomists, Anaxg.) from the point of departure of the "mixture" which is seen as in some way centrally important in each. Much seems arbitrary, some fanciful, little</page><page sequence="5">DECEMBER 1966 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 147 enlightening. Classen's survey (45) gives the background for Plato's Demiurge. Lammli (47) begins with Ovid's Metamorphoses in studying the history of the chaos-to-cosmos theme. In Anaxg., "everything was together" at first, and this mixture was differentiated into a cosmos; later, the "mixed" becomes the "conflicting" or "unordered," and the process is one of the creation of order out of disorder. On scanty evidence, the responsibility for this change is given to Archelaus. The use of Lloyd's opposites (48) in patho- logical theories goes back to Alcmaeon, in cos- mology to Anaxd. Relations of these terms to other couples of opposites, like life and death, are often founded on observations not at all empiri- cal. (Here is the "polarity" thought-pattern to be met in no. 103.) Mugler finds (50) that even in purportedly monistic systems there is a dual- istic theory of matter (e.g., atoms and void): and even when the motive cause is assertedly single (nous) there is a "dynamic dualism" in cosmic process. Solmsen (51) shows the con- tinuity in such questions as "natural place" and eternal movement, from the pre-Socratic through Plato to Aristotle. This is the theme of no. 52. No. 53 is one of a number of recent studies in which Professor Solmsen takes up particular concepts or problems and traces them through Greek thought, and in which the pre-Socratics form a first section. Investigating the ways in which Nature "operates," he finds sexual re- production replaced by "sociomorphic thought- patterns," Parm. reverts to the genetic mode, and it is in Emp. that we first find nature (in the person of Love) "working" as a craftsman. In a careful study of the Theogony and the Milesian doxography, Stokes (54) discerns a parallel between Anaxd.-Anaxn. and Hesiod, and sees a likely dependence on him or his source. Thales is harder to fit in. West's "three" (55) are Alcman (papyrus fragments), Pherecydes, and most interestingly Thales. He conjectures that as Anaxd. derived the world from a dine in the apeiron, so Thales had derived it from a dinei in the primal, all-encompassing water. This gives him, West thinks, a cosmogony worthy of his reputation as a wise man. There is of course very much more on cosmology in works on the individual philosophers. Science 56.

Lucretius (London: Routledge, 1965), pp. 1-17. In this area important work has been done, and progress made, though some important dif- ferences of interpretation remain unresolved. Here, too, there is much to be found in the sections on the individual philosophers. Claggett (56) has produced a good, clear sur- vey primarily for the beginner in history of science; there is not much on our period. The work of Sambursky (57), who is himself a physicist, is one of the finest books on the subject, largely topical rather than chronological in arrangement. His familiarity with philological techniques and evidence is superior to that of Schrodinger (58). Schottlaender (59) emphasizes the rationality of the early thinkers; even Py- thagorean silence is related to the necessity of concentrated attention to the (mathematical) instruction. Professor von Fritz, whose many contributions to the field could not all be enum- erated, shows here (60) that Greek originality lies in the search for simple fundamental princi- ples, compared with the confusion of Oriental science, which after all consists mainly in the massing of detail. In (61) he argues that there is a close connexion in general outlook, purpose, method, and terminology between social and humanistic study (history) and natural-scienti- fic study. Here Solmsen (62) studies, in the first of four sections, the ideas of several pre-Socratics on the transmission of messages to and from the central, directing organ. The interesting essay of Verdenius (63), tak- ing Greek science as a whole but with much pre-Socratic material, discusses fundamental dif- ferences in ancient and modern experimentation and quantification. Longrigg (64) distinguishes</page><page sequence="6">148 THE CLASSICAL WORLD DECEMBER 1966 beneficial and pernicious influences of philosophy on medicine, but his most important section is on the beneficial influence of medicine on phil- osophy. Lloyd (65) thinks that in physical sci- ence experimentation existed first in the fifth or fourth century, in biological from the times of Hippocrates. Capelle's study (66) of the re- ports of Theophrastus on Menestor (DK 32; a younger contemporary of Emp.) shows him the inventor of physiological botany. In a lucid chap- ter Lowenstein (67) shows how the thought of the pre-Socratics (especially Democritus) can in various ways be brought face-to-face with modern science. Mathematics 68. Becker, 0.

No. 68 is a collection of (mostly recent) studies. Becker's "Studienheft" (69) has a his- torical survey and a discussion of carefully- selected examples. He does not always separate strictly material from different periods, but the result is an excellent introduction to the sub- ject. Neugebauer's works (no. 70 and others) are fundamental for the relation of Greek to Oriental science. Van der Waerden's book (71) is a survey of the field, making use of the results of Neugebauer. He has also published, within our period, a number of special articles on topics in ancient science, notably on the Pythagoreans; see especially no. 207. Boker (72) has a whole series of mathe- matical and scientific articles in RE, e.g. '.'Win- kel- und Kreisteilung," "Winde," "neusis," and "Wetterzeichen" (the last two in Supp. 9). Von Fritz (73) shows that the method of working from axioms and postulates developed only grad- ually, and the stages are hard to distinguish; but Aristotle was the first to establish that all science works from postulates, and to try to classify them. In a series of substantial articles (at least 8), the Hungarian scholar Szabo (75) has maintained that not only Greek logic and dialectic, but the bases of scientific mathematics have emerged from the work of Parmenides and the Eleatics.

Burkert's conclusion (77) is that in spite of tradition, it was Plato rather than Pythagoras who really invented the term "philosophy," at least as denoting what we (and Plato) mean by it. In tracing the development of sophos and sophia, Gladigow (78) emphasizes the import- ance of poetical tradition and divine inspiration; when criticism of that leads to renunciation of the claim to be sophos, philosophy in the true sense is born. The various senses of "theory" (79) grow from that of "watching the god, and keeping his will," via the concept of an official sent to consult oracles and care for religious matters (and thus in his travels becoming so- phos). Verdenius (80) writes not of philology as a scholarly discipline, but, taking the word etymologically, of the "love of the logos." He emphasizes that logos is an activity (Tatigkeit). Klowski (82), in a thorough and closely- reasoned analysis, makes a good case that the concept of "substance" can hardly antedate Par- menides. Following Diels and others, Burkert (83) institutes a new inquiry into the history of the term stoicheion, most common in the sense "element," and decides that it came to mean this not via "letter" (of the alphabet) but as a term in the mathematics of the late fifth century (possibly Hippocrates of Chios) which meant a basic principle (axiom, postulate). He rejects Koller's thesis (84) that it was ori- ginally a musical term introduced by the Pyth- agoreans. Lumpe's study of the same topic (85) is listed here as one example, and a memento to look for more, of the many articles in the Reallexikon fur Antike und Christentum which bear upon pre-Socratic studies. Maraux's RE- article deals with pre-Socratics in columns 1171- 1184 (86). Holwerda (96) decides that of the two senses corresponding to the verbal ideas "to be" and "to grow," physis most often exempli- fies the former, and that "be" is the etymological sense of the root phy-. Boas (97) studies the fate of rational think- ing in each of several broad areas. Boeder's lucubration (98) on theories of knowledge is pretentious, repetitive and obscure, like his other writings. DeLacy (99) actually finds little con- nexion between the "not rather" theme and scepticism. It carries no such suggestion for Democritus, and the others who come into ques- tion (Protagoras and Gorgias) may not actually have used the term. Topitsch (100) makes a cul- tural-anthropological approach to the "thought- forms" or "models" of myth and philosophy (e.g., the "sociomorphic" and the "technomor- phic"). Verdenius (101) uses the concepts of physis (the world as living organism: parti- cipation) and kosmos (the world as ordered whole: contemplation) to illuminate some mod- ern problems, notably in Existentialism. The "polar" combination "right and left" is not only prominent in Greek religious and ethical ideas, says Lloyd (102), but also may be detect- ed in some of their explanations of complicated natural phenomena. The "like-to-like" thought- pattern is analyzed very thoroughly and acutely by Muller (104). Buccellato (106) begins with the Cratylus and goes into its background: oracles, Herodotus, etc.; but there is little on the philosophers. Using the example of the sphere and the spherical Rudberg (107) shows that in this period the concept is in transition from literal to abstract. The concrete-abstract di- chotomy also concerns Snell (108), who uses Greek terms in this realm to illustrate the re- lation of scientific to ordinary language. Thes- leff (109) finds the "scientific style" to be basically a derivative of two main sources, what he calls the "early treatise style" and the "prose of technical description and instruction."

(Princeton: PUP, 1955). More is stirring on this front than suggested by the small sample here offered, and one feels confident that the relations of Greeks with their neighbors on several sides will have an import- ant role in the interpretation of archaic thought in the next generation. The "Greek miracle" idea, suggesting that philosophy suddenly sprang full-panoplied from the brow of Thales, certainly seems dead; but scholars are not near a consen- sus as to who owes how much of what to whom.

Martin Heidegger is a conspicuous example of a modern philosopher who has taken inspiration and ideas from the pre-Socratics. Of course he is far from being the only one; he is included here, along with some he has influenced, partly at least because he proceeds not from the usual generalities but from the explication of specific words and sentences. The only trouble is that the analysis is often highly idiosyncratic, from a philological point of view. A commentator remarks that to Heidegger the "weight" of a word is scarcely less important than its mean- ing. The text is "viewed creatively, to find what- ever meaning it may have for the contemporary thinker," and often becomes the basis for medita- tions that range very far from any possible sense of the original. This is surely a harmless game, though possible users of this survey per- haps deserve a warning that, in Fr. Seidel's words, "Heidegger's incursions into the history of philosophy are not, nor are they intended, to be, historical in the commonly accepted sense of that word. However, it also seems to me clear that they are fully and completely historical and authentically 'linguistic' in the sense in which history and language are understood and inter- preted by Heidegger" (no. 118, p. 152).

The Milesians are important because of their position and difficult because of the source-prob- lem; the latter may encourage either extreme caution or extreme boldness. In the work on this period there is naturally a good deal of methodological discussion. Maddalena's new text with translation (137; cf. no. 9) is excellent. In interpretation of the Milesians, he generally follows his analysis in his 1940 book, which rejects the usual interpre- tation of them as monistic materialists and stresses their principles of antithesis and op- position. Thales is for some almost too dim and ill- attested to count at all. Holscher (144) and Kahn (145), as their titles indicate, think of Anaximander as the dominant figure of the period. Dicks (142) gives a carefully-balanced account of what we can know of Th. His con- clusions are pessimistic. On the other hand, Clas- sen (139) concludes, after a thorough canvass of the tradition, that he was led primarily by practical considerations and goals not only to political and ethical insights and other achieve- ments, but also to an attempt to comprehend the multifarious phenomena of nature by refer- ence to a unitary totality which he probably thought of as emerging from a single "principle" (Urgrund). Wasserstein (158) suggests a rela- tion of Thales to Babylonian mathematics; Rosen (154) writes on the philosophical significance of a discussion of the origin of philosophy. Several important works on Anaximander have appeared. Kahn's full study (145) perhaps stands out, both in its detail and in its scope. He regards Anaxd. as the founder of the "Ionian tradition" and emphasizes his rationalism while at the same time able to see his relation to mythical backgrounds. Holscher (144) carefully examines the doxographical testimony, and also lays stress on the background of Anaxd.'s ideas, where he sees not only Hesiod but Phoenician and Babylonian traditions. Not these, but Iranian precedents reveal themselves to Burkert (138), particularly for the curious order of the circles of stars, moon, and sun (proceeding outward from the earth), and for the apeiron. His sug- gestion is that Eastern mythology provided a sort of borrowed scaffolding for Greek natural philosophy, which could then be discarded as the building was completed. When Pirenne looks (151), he sees Egyptians all through Milesian philosophy. Classen (139) seeks to distinguish Anaxi- 2. The reader is reminded that in each section of Part II the important collections, histories, and special works listed in Part I are to be taken as re-ferred to, most importantly pethaps Guthrie's History (29).</page><page sequence="10">152 THE CLASSICAL WORLD DECEMBER 1966 mander's language and manner of expression from that of the poets, emphasizing his achieve- ment as a scientist. A similar emphasis is found in the article of Matson (150), a review-article on Cornford's Principium sapientiae. He concedes to Cornford that the pre-Socratics were not ex- perimental scientists, but protests that to make them successors of the "poet-seer-sages" (or shamans) does not account for the advances they made. The transition from myth to phil- osophy "consists precisely and wholly in a grad- ual awakening of the Greeks to the conscious- ness that there is just one world, and the ex- tension of the concept of 'literal truth' to that world" (p. 452). In a rather general, lecture style de Corte (141) deals with the same topic. (Not listed in this survey are his other essays of this type, mostly in the same journal.) Seligman (156) is interested in the nature of metaphysics, and sees the apeiron as the first of the "key ideas" which are characteristic of metaphysical systems. After examining the doxo- graphical tradition, Gottschalk (143) concludes that Anaxd. used the word apeiron "in its obvi- ous sense of 'spatially infinite' " (p. 51). Solm- sen (157) carefully assesses the language of certain passages, especially in Ar. Ph. 3, look- ing for and finding indications of language Anaxd. may have used. Schwabl's rigorous analysis of some Anaxi- mandrian sources (155) has primarily a method- ological significance. Kirk's article (147) deals with several important issues more fully than KR. Loenen's answer to his 1954 question (148), rightly accepted by Kahn and others, is "no." Wisniewski's article (160) is included as a rep- resentative of about 10 (on various philosoph- ers), notable for boldness of conclusion but not philological rigor. This one concludes that since punishment for injustice is common to Anaxd. (fr. 1) and the Pythagoreans (Emp. fr. 115), the doctrine of metempsychosis was probably taught by Anaxd.! Not many special treatments of Anaxn. have been published. Kerferd (146) dates him between 528-525 and 498/7 B.C. Longrigg (149) interprets fr. 2 to mean that the soul is air and envelops the whole world. Pythagoras and Pythagoreanism Perhaps the main outstanding issue on Pyth'ism is precisely, what is pre-Socratic and what is not? Guthrie, in HGP (no. 29), solves the problem by putting almost all Pyth'ism into one chapter, and in this we may follow him.

Maddalena (161) provides a good, clear trans- lation of the material in DK, with many useful notes and essays on the background of the school, its doctrines, and its relation to Orphics and Platonists. Along with text and another Italian translation, Maria Timpanaro Car- dini (162; cf. 9) has printed a very full commen- tary. Von Albrecht's new edition of Iam. VP is not an improvement over Deubner's, and his translation must be used with caution (164). Along with the relation of early and late source- material go problems of the relation to the Aca- demics and others. And the very nature of the school can be interpreted in widely different ways by competent scholars. Was it primarily scientific or religious or moral or political, or some combina- tion of these, or all together? Several comprehen- sive and important studies of Pythagoreanism have appeared in recent years; but although it would be wrong to suggest that there lhas been no progress, still fundamental differences of approach and of conclusion remain. No attempt can be made here to mediate or synthesize; one clear fact is that fur- ther study and discussion is necessary before any kind of consensus can be approached. Von Fritz's RE-article (179) deals not only with the life and doctrines of Pyth., but the politics, organization and doctrines of the school down through the fourth century. This is a remarkable piece of work, learned but unclutter- ed and readable, the fruit of long study, whose way was prepared by a number of special arti- cles and monographs. On the question whether Pythagoreanism was primarily scientific or re- ligious, he finds that "the radical rejection of one half of the tradition in favor of the other quite definitely does not lead to the goal. Pyth- agoreanism must have contained both elements from the beginning, an element of mysticism and an element of scientific study, as well as an element of conservatism along with an element of progressivism" (col. 225). This line of thought leads to interpretation of Pythagorean history in terms of a "split" (Spaltung) in the society in the fifth century. While there were certainly divisions in the group, some will perhaps be dubious about the extent and the details of the use of this idea and the consequences in the interpretation of Pyth. doctrine. (No. 177 is of course relevant here). Different conclusions are reached by Walter Burkert in his brilliant Weisheit und Wissen- schaft (171). In fact von Fritz probably had him in mind in using the term "radical rejection" (above), for his erudite, tightly skeptical argu- ment would deprive the Pyths. of the credit usually given them for great scientific achieve-</page><page sequence="12">154 THE CLASSICAL WORLD DECEMBER 1966 ments in astronomy, music, and mathematics, and shows us a Pythagoras in the "shamanistic" tradition, sage rather than scientist. (B. is vigor- ously castigated by Maddalena for uncritical use of the evidence [193].) B. L. van der Waerden, who has written much on ancient science, gives a full account of that of the Pythagoreans, giving credit to the early school for considerable accomplishments. This exposition, based on ear- lier work of his own and others (notably Becker and Reidemeister), is worked out largely in Auseinandersetzung with Burkert. Professor DeVogel's new book (206) is a vigorously-argued attempt to get closer to Pyth., who seems to her mainly a truly "aristocratic" (not politically oligarchic) moral reformer, preacher, educator. Neither mathematics nor shamanism figures prominently in her study. The "neglected evidence" of her subtitle is main- ly material derived from fourth-century histor- ians, notably the "four speeches" in lam. VP 37-57, which she supposes to contain material going back to the founder himself, though per- haps first written down by a member of the school in the fifth century, and later somewhat contaminated. Bindel's work (167) is a popu- larization, characterized by uncritical use of the sources. Studies of the history, spread, and organization of the society naturally also bear on the problem of source-evaluation. Morrison (197) makes a careful attempt to find credible reports on Pythagoras him- self. Studying Plato's reaction to the school (196), he discerns a growing Pyth. influence resultirng from successive visits to Magna Graecia. Philip (201) throws into doubt the long-accepted assumptions and method of Rohde and Bertermann, and main- tains that the Lives of Porphyry and Iamblichus, as well as Diogenes Laertius, can only be used for biographical information when they cite definitely- established old sources. In two studies of Aristotle, he maintains that A. "had access to and used ample, contemporary, and commonly accessible sources," including Philolaus and Archytas (200), and that he wrote two monographs on the Pythagoreans, one on the legendary elements of the tradition and one dealing critically with doctrine; they were later edited into one (199). Thesleff's monograph (205), taking departure from a dialect-study, would date in the Hellenistic period many of the pseudo-Pytha- gorean documents placed later by Zeller and others. He has now published (163) a new text of the materials discussed. In a nearly contemporary article, Burkert (170) finds that though the Pyth. tradition was probably not continuous, various of the pseudepigrapha were written in the Hellenistic period, and fits these facts with the reception of Greek civilization at Rome. Though Ferrero (176) was mainly concerned with a period later than that under review, his work is relevant to the problem of source-analysis. (Carcopino [173] also is writing on the Roman period; this book follows that on the Porte Majeure.) Miscellanea: Ltvdque and Vidal-Naquet (189) write an interesting, highly speculative, wide-rang- ing book. (They decide Cleisthenes was not a Pythagorean.) In a posthumous publication (191) are made available some fragments of I. Lvy's work in continuation of his studies of the 1920's on the relation of the Pyths. to certain Near Eastern sects. Interpreting the citation of the Pythagoreans' peras-apeiron dichotomy in the Philebus, Ilting (181) finds that it goes back to the early school. Marcovich (194) has four sections on the bean- taboo, the metempsychosis-doctrine, etc. He thinks of the Pyths. as both theoretical scientists and adepts of magical and ritual practices. Mc- Gibbon's (195) is the latest of several recent discussions attempting to clarify the difficulties in Pindar's metempsychosis-passages. Detienne (175) holds that the worship of daimones and their identification with souls was an important and original element of early Pyth'ism. No. 174 is a suggestive study of the allegorical inter- pretation of Homer. In addition to these books, Detienne has published in recent years at least nine articles on Pyth. allegory and demonology. Joly (182) is included here because the Pyths. figure most conspicuously in his pre-Socratic pages. A student of Delatte, he accepts more of the tradition than some. Capparelli (172), whose Sapienza di Pitagora was characterized in my earlier survey, is active in the "Pyth- agorean Renaissance." This book, one of several contributions, was written on the occasion of the Second Congress of Pythagorean Organizations (London). He sees a need for the rejection of materialism, lies, hostility, and the adoption of Pythagorean morality. Rougier's little book (203) is semi-popular. There is much on Pyth. mathematics and metaphysics in works listed in Part I, particul- arly in the "Mathematics" section (nos. 68ff.). Junge (183) thinks the Pyths. did not keep the discovery of irrational numbers secret, nor build up bodies from points. Kucharski (186) studies various notions (of Pyths. and others) about the wonderful qualities of 7, which the Pyths. identified with kairos, the time of realization or accomplishment. Against others, he also holds (185) that they did very likely think of the One and the Indefinite Dyad as the supreme principles. In an interesting article about the tunnel on Samos, Goodfield and Toulmin (180) cast serious doubt on the use of Pythagorean geometry in its construction. There are not many special studies of Phil- olaus. G. E. R. Lloyd (192) thinks he is the object of attack in On ancient medicine.

Orphism may in time to come play a more significant role in the story of the development of Greek thought, along with the Seven Sages, Pherecydes, and others who inhabit the murky territory between myth and philosophy. At pre- sent there seems to be no general agreement about these figures. Bohme (210) would place 0. as a very early (Mycenaean) and important figure (used by Homer and Hesiod), though he is still Kitharode rather than philosopher.

Untersteiner's (216) is in the BSS series (9), and has a full commentary and very long introduction. With his usual independ- ence and vigor, U. presents a number of uncon- ventional views, e.g. that MXG was written by a third-century Megarian. Much interesting read- ing, but to be used only with caution. The principal problems which have exercised scholars in our period are those of the chronol- ogy of Xens's. life, of the nature of his relation, if any, to Eleaticism, and of the character of his activity and philosophy (if any). Thesleff's (227) late dating (ca. 540-440) has not found much favor. Woodbury (228) does an admirable job of disentangling the tradition, so as not only to confirm the customary approximate dating, but to explain how some of the confusions arose. In his long recent article (226) Steinmetz goes over the chronological evidence very thoroughly, ending with a confirmation, in essence, of the traditional dates (580-77 to "after 478"; cf. Guthrie's ."approximately 570-470"). Then, after reviewing ancient interpretations of Xens., he concludes in a third section that there probably was never a poem On nature, and finally that the unity in Xens. is in his personality and his reforming, de-mythologizing, satirical and pole- mical efforts. Along with a useful review and discussion of recent studies by others, Corbato (219, 218) sets forth his own views. He sees a development in the Colophonian's thought, and would attribute his naturalistic physical phil- osophy to an early period (in Colophon?), when he was under Ionian influence, but his theologi- cal speculations, and the Silloi, to later days, in Magna Graecia, when he was perhaps under Pythagorean and Orphic influences. Herter (221) and Defradas (220) discuss the banquet-poems. The former is concerned with their literary affiliations; the latter argues that various details suggest a religious meeting rather than a banquet (an "Eleatic thiasus"), and would put him squarely in the religious rather than the rationalist tradition. Aside from general studies, where the trend</page><page sequence="14">156 THE CLASSICAL WORLD DECEMBER 1966 seems to be to divorce Xens. from the Eleatic tradition, and to emphasize both his moralistic, re- forming zeal and his rationalism, there are many studies of smaller points, of which a few are here listed. On the question of what kind of fossils he found at which Paros, one may now consult Casella (217) and Marcovich (223). Heraclitus 231. Eraclito, Testirnoniianze e frammenti, ed. &amp; tr. R.

Everybody has something to say about Her- aclitus, and perhaps it is his celebrated obscurity that makes so many think it would be a good thing to start with a new translation. My biblio- graphy shows 9 editions and 14 translations into 9 modern languages, all from our limited period and not counting reprints. And of course most are accompanied by ample commentary. Of full-length treatments, Zeller-Mondolfo (258) is indispensable even for those who have the German original, because of Mondolfo's many added notes. Here he discusses with great learn- ing and sound judgment all the important prob- lems, including very full bibliography. Thirteen articles published separately are omitted here as subsumed in these notes, though some are fuller. The book perhaps ought to have a general index or an index of passages; but it does have an index of names and a perspicuous table of contents. Mondolfo's edition and translation in the Biblioteca di Studi Superiori series (231; cf. 9) has been announced. Marcovich, in his supple- ment to the RE article of Wellmann (247) covers most important topics, with a long section on textual problems. There are many interest- ing points, but the whole is choked up with an unnecessary profusion of documentation. M. has also at least 7 short articles on individual Her- aclitean passages, and has announced a larger study in two volumes. Cl6mence Ramnoux, in addition to her well-titled up-to-date book (251) has several articles on Her. and others. Quiring's (232) is a geologist's reinterpretation, with some interesting comments. Wheelwright (233) offers a comprehensive treatment in reasonable com- pass, directed mainly it seems to the undergradu- ate; not much is new. The philosopher appears to Axelos (236) through Marxist and existen- tialist glasses. G. S. Kirk has pursued his Heraclitean studies (in the Cosmic fragments and KR) writh a series of articles including no. 244. It enters three areas: innovations in vocabulary, in syntax, and in para- dox and comparison. Many of the entries here rep- resent reactions to Kirk's views. Objections center</page><page sequence="15">DECEMBER 1966 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 157 about his emphasis on rest or tension, rather than motion and flux, and his abandonment of the river- fragments, elemental fire, and ecpyrdsi. Rivier (253) would rescue Her. from the subjectivism which he sees in Kirk's interpretation, but Kirk (245) denies that it is there. To say that water is drinkable to fish and not to man is not subjectivism, though the presence of the "assessor" is part of the objective fact. A vigorous discussion on both me- thodological and substantive issues has been car- ried on between Kirk and K. R. Popper. It includes nos. 22, 23, 24, and 25 as well as 249. Along with his review of the Coomologcal fragments, Vlastos published an article (256), taking issue with Kirk's excessive emphasis on stability, as against change, as centrally important to Her's. doctrine. Rabino- witz and Matson's reaction (250) is largely descrip- tive. Kerschensteiner (243) devotes a careful phil- ological analysis to Theophrastus' report. She sees limitations in him but stresses that these "do not diminish his importance." In Chroust's article (237), Her. is portrayed as "primarily an inspired hierophant." Kahn's "new look" (242) begins with consideration of the literary form of Heraclitus' writing and in analyzing the logos, the fire, the nomos, and the gods as Her. sees them, makes good use of insights into the philosopher's use of verbal ambiguity, para- dox, and imagery. At the center of his thought lies a "unity between the life of man and the order of nature." Conley (238) attempts to group the principal fragments according to their main concepts, with some rather obscure interpreta- tion on the "associative" method. Deichgriiber's careful and leisurely analysis (239), regarding content as well as form, reveals that though the rhythm is "followed rather than sought," not merely clausulae but whole sentences are rhythmical in form. The piece by Yorck von Wartenburg (257), apparently published as an act of piety by his friends, is a meditation, not a study. Winterhalder's book, too (234), is one of those that "take off from" rather than "lead up to" the subject. Monismo indiano (254) follows several articles in which Ada Somigliana tries to show that Her. was influenced by the Vedic writ- ings. Here is listed one (241) of a half-dozen or more articles, mainly on individual passages, which K. D. Georgoulis has published in the Athenian journal Platon (in modern Greek). No. 259 is listed as a sample of the work of A. N.

The Eleatics continue to be great favorites, and discussion continues on such problems as the subject of "is," Eleatic logic and ontology, the number and nature of the "ways," the meaning of the "Doxa" and its relation to the "AMltheia," and of course the resolution of Zeno's paradoxes. There are also some newer trends, including an increasing tendency (resisted by some) to em- phasize the background, the importance of Parm's. proem, the shamanistic, religious, and poetic side. Untersteiner's edition of Parm. (262; see 9), which supersedes his earlier one (1925), is one of his major efforts, and is useful whether one is inclined to accept his often "far-out" inter- pretations or not. Various articles are here re- garded as subsumed in the preface of CCX pages. The book of Taran (261) is very thoroughly documented, independent, sometimes implausible. He makes Parm. a simon-pure metaphysician, refusing to see not only any influence of politics or social context (passed over in one sentence on p. 5), but also the shamanistic, Orphic, and Pythagorean influences discerned by most recent interpreters. To Brocker (264), Parm's. phil- osophy is a contest against communis opinio; there are in fact two bouts, comprising the first and second parts of the poem. Loenen's closely-knit study (278) is largely devoted to Parm. He proposes to restore ti (for te) at fr. 2.3, translating "something exists," and warning that esti (exists) must be taken sensu stricto; further, noein, "non-sensorial think- ing/knowing," is the only necessary existent, to which therefore ti must refer. Falus, on the other hand (268) finds that eon is the (tauto- logical) subject of "is"; "is or is not" is the basic question of Parmenides, and it is only by circular reasoning that he "proves" "is not" to be impossible. His basic theses are only suit- able for a metaphysical logic. To Szabo (294) the philosophy of Parm. is only to be understood in relation to the inherent contradiction in the concept of movement. It is not a reaction against Her., and has nothing to do with religion. (On Szab6's work see also no. 75.) Joja, too (275; one of a number of studies of ancient logic), finds that "tautological identity dominates the whole architecture of Eleaticism"; and Stannard (293) warns against interpreting Parm's. "logical method" in too modern terms: "The principal criterion followed . . . was essentially a negative one: avoidance of any open violation of the rules of Greek syntax." Taking a somewhat different approach from the ordinary, Woodbury (296) begins with the discus- sion of a textual problem in fragment 8.38, and following the theme that Parm. is concerned with what things are called, finds that "Being . . . is more than a word: it is the name of the real world" (p. 156). Phillips (283) makes use of the religious, mystical "tone" of Parm's. writing. "Thinking and being are the same" (fr. 3); but this does not mean that Being is purely mental; it is both essentially mental and essentially extended, and is also spherical. Mrs. Sprague (292) would put 7.1 after 6.2, drop 7.2, aind place 7.3 after 6.9. H6lscher's detailed analysis (273) draws implica- tions from grammatical points in 4.1, 8.34, and 16.2. There are several new analyses which either make much use of, or are devoted mainly to, the proem. For example, Deichgraber (266) main- tains that it is not allegory, mystery, or revela- tion, but a literary and thematic introduction related closely in thematic and conceptual re- spects to both the main parts of the poem. The equation of "the goddess" with Dike will pre- sumably be fully argued later. In their similarly- titled papers, Dolin (267) points out parallels with Hesiod, and Schwabl (287) by analysis of both form and content tries to show a depen- dency of the later poet, and a continuity of tradition. Mansfeld's elaborate and interesting study (280) depicts the proem as recounting a journey beyond the edge of the world, with a revelation by Dike. This made it necessary that Parmenides be a poet; and in procedure and philosophy he stands in contrast both to the Ionian tradition and to Xens. Francotte (269), starting with the "eloquent mares" of the proem</page><page sequence="17">DECEMBER 1966 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 159 and following a "shamanistic" course, leads around to the conclusion that the goddess is revealing to Parm. a "paradise of language," and that both myth and thought are always present in Greek philosophy. According to Reich (285) the thought of Parm. cannot be understood with- out considering him an opponent of the Pytha- goreans; but this view is not as popular now as it once was. As the "corporeal, spherical plenum" inter- pretation of the first part is now not so widely held, so there is considerable tendency to think of the second part as having some real philoso- phical validity and importance. So Schwabl (290) says that the first part shows the way, and the second the cosmology on that true way, set out in opposition to both Ionians and Pythagoreans. But Owen, in his important article (282), holds (among other things) that Parm. was not a cos- mologist, and that he was an innovator who cannot be understood on the basis of earlier tradition. Tugwell (295) criticizes points in Owen's argument. For Chalmers (265) the second part is an analysis of the real world, but seen from the point of view of time instead of eternity. Long (279) would agree that being and not-being are principles of the second part as well as the first, and that the whole is a unity; but he thinks the second is in fact a di- gression with a dialectical or didactic aim, giving an example of fallacious human thought. The introduction to Beaufret's edition and translation (260) is essentially a "meditation," in the Heideggerian vein. It begins with the risky assumption that Parm's. anonymous goddess is AWtheia. Kuspit (277) writes about how modern philosophers, and especially Husserl, make use of the pre-Socratics. From Pomilio (284) we have an existentialist fantasy on Parm's. Being. A vigorous exchange of views was touched off by Severino's call for a return to Parm. (291; six articles in the same journal, in 1964 and 1965). Zeno and Melissus.

It would be impossible here even to summarize a significant number of the analyses of his argu- ments; but the results of a few studies, mainly historical, may be mentioned. Untersteiner's edition (297; cf. 9) of course follows the line of his Parmenide. Zeno is a defender of Parm., but not as usually understood, for the latter had no doctrine of the One, only one of the Whole, and both his worlds (being and seeming) are parts of this; Zeno does not deny either plurality or change. Booth (299), reacting against Cornford and Raven, denies that Zeno's arguments were directed against opponents of Parm.; and speci- fically not the Pythagoreans (300). Booth (301) emphasizes our dependence on Aristotle in the reconstruction of his doctrines, though Malverne (305) finds that Ar. fails in his critique of Z.; his empiricism cannot directly refute their apriorism. Amid the discussions of predecessors and successors, Kullmann (303) insists on the importance of defining exactly the relation of Z. to his teacher. Vlastos has been publishing the results of a careful reassessment of Zeno. They were set forth in tentative and temporary form in Kaufmann's textbook (309); but no. 308 and no. 310 have now superseded parts of that chapter. A Melissus has been announced in the BSS series (311; cf. 9), and may by now have been published. Empedocles 313. Emp6docle d'Agrigente, ed. &amp; tr. J. Zafiro- pulo (Paris: Tallone, 1953) . 314.

Zafiropulo edits and translates the text, and in- terprets Emp. in the framework of his general "animistic" theory of pre-Socratic philosophy (313). Nelod's is a brief, popularizing account (323). Not so Bollack's (315), the latest arrival on the scene, a comprehensive study which I refrain from attempting to characterize on the basis of the (very interesting) first of three volumes. (Bollack has published about half a dozen articles on Emp.) Reiche (324) deals learnedly with embryology, inborn breath, vari- ous concepts of mixture including a "Sphairo- morphic" four-element mixture which is Emp's. vital principle, and other topics. Kahn (320) discusses the relationship between the religious- mvstical and the scientific-rational elements in Emp., and inevitably also between the two poems, concluding that there is no basic inconsistency between them. The key to the puzzles of Emp's. svstem Munding finds (322) in frag. 35, which reveals the relation between his cosmogony and the Love-Hate contrast. Several recent articles have re-examined the tradition of Emp's. cosmology and cosmogony. My own (321) questions traditional interpreta- tions of the homogenized ("fused") and divine Sphere as the triumph of Love, and also tries to see the position of the different stages in the development of organisms. Holscher (318) would eliminate the cyclic cosmological process entirely and see the cycle of change as an interchange of the elements in the life-process of people, animals, and plants. Most recently, Solmsen (325) also criticizes the conventional views of the "cycle," and especially the idea of a "dual cosmogony." He thinks of Strife as the cause of the cosmos, Love as exerting her power in the "mixing and fashioning of living beings." In Maria Timpanaro Cardini's study (327) of the growth of animals and species, there is an em- phasis on the criticism of Aristotle, which seems to demonstrate the importance and influence of Emp's. doctrine. She has also analyzed (326) the problems connected with the clepsydra demonstration and the phenomenon of respira- tion. Like Booth (316), she thinks that the re- ference is to respiration in the usual sense, and that rhin6n means "nostrils," not "skin." Furley (317) brings out that the clepsydra is introduced as a convincing analogy and not as the report of a true scientific experiment. There are also differences still unreconciled in the interpreta- tion of the detail of the illustration. Jouanna (319) holds that there was a reciprocal relation between Emp. and the Hippocratic physicians. The Later lonians (Anaxagoras and Diogenes of A pollonia) 328.

One of the most fascinating and persistent problems is the interpretation of Anaxagoras' physical system. How could he say that "(1) In everything there is a portion of everything; (2) Every piece of matter is infinitely divisible; (3) The predominant ingredients in a substance are responsible for its most distinctive features"? (Strang's formulation, no. 344, p. 101.) What is the relation of powers, seeds, portions, opposites, and things, and what is to be included in each category? What part do "homoeomers" play, if any? An amazing number of different recon- structions of the system have been offered (see the survey in no. 332, pp. 379ff.), and there is no lack of them in our period. (Guthrie's [29] must be noted!) It would be impossible to char- acterize or summarize - let alone evaluate - all these accounts here, but some of the most interesting are listed. Some emphasize the desirability of holding as close as possible to the philosopher's actual words (e.g., Raven, no. 338, Stokes, no. 343), even at the cost of acknowledging that he might have missed something or made a mistake. Others are more willing to speak of what he "must have meant" though it is not specifically attested. Here would fall, for example, the elabo- rate construction of Mugler (337) and the C[ommon] gold-E[lemental] gold dichotomy of Strang (344). And now Gershenson and Green- berg (332), to whom Anaxg. is the founder of scientific physics and of the scientific method generally, apply a truly radical solution to the source-problem by labelling the fragments as spurious. Mathewson also examines source-prob- lems (336), assigning more significance to Aris- totle's testimony and less to Lucretius' than Cornford did. Bargrave-Weaver (328) finds that Anaxg's. cosmogony is not a succession of steps; the various separations and re-combinations take place simul- taneouslv, in past, present, and future. In the see- ond part of his long article (343) Stokes argues against this, and tries to put the cosmogonical theory into a historical context. In von Fritz's important article (331), Anaxg's. nous is interpreted as participant in two lines of development, one which regards recognition or realization as leading to knowledge of deeply hidden reality, and one in which mind is an agent in the progressive elimina- tion of myth, anthropomorphism, and teleology. In the opinion of Bloch (329), Anaxg's. prime importance is as a metaphysician stemming from the Eleatic tradition, but in his theory of infinitesi- mals he is an important predecessor of atomism. Kucharski (333) points out the importance that his medical contemporaries must have had in the development of his thought, for example in his notions about the identity of composition of living and inorganic beings, about proportion in mixtures, nutrition of like by like, and seeds. His idea of the brain as the central organ of perception comes from the Ionian tradition, and specifically from Alemaeon, as Lanza was not the first to see (334). In a longer article the same scholar, like Guthrie and others, decides that the "homoeomers" belonged not to Anaxg. but to the doxographic tradition (335). Not much has been published on Archelaus, Diogenes, or the other later Ionians; but a cross- reference should be made to Maddalena's lonici (137). Hiuffmeier questions Theiler's attribution of a teleological view to Diogenes (346); and Miller (347) finds the rationalistic theology of the De morbo sacro dependent on Diogenes of Apollonia.

Considering their importance, the atomists have been relatively neglected, though there are signs in recent years of a renewed interest, among other places in eastern Europe. Of book- length studies, that of Alfieri (348) has been influential. Despite its title, it is not a study of the historical growth of atomism but of philosophical problems. He sees it as a reply to Eleaticism. He has also published a number of articles on the subject. Mau (359) explores the relation between the infinitesimal theory and the Pythagorean and Eleatic philosophies. The whole matter of the indivisibility of atoms, geo- metrical and physical, is taken up by Guthrie in a special appendix to his second volume (no. 29, pp. 503-507). It has now been discussed by Vlastos (363), whose article is included here in spite of its title because it makes an important contribution to the study of Democritus. Other technical points about the atoms are considered by Kriz (351) Mugler (360), McDiarmid (356), and Sambursky (361). To discussion of an emen- dation in Diogenes Laertius, Jula Kerschensteiner appends interesting comments on the analogy of cosmic and organic, and the growth of the scientific attitude (350). The old question of Democritus' ethics and their connexion with his physics is discussed by Krokiewicz (352; I have only seen the summary) and by Luria (354). The latter is definitely against the wholesale rejection of Dem's. ethical fragments; each must be considered on its merits. On the transmission of the collection, he is du- bious about Stewart's (362) suggestion that the Cynics were involved. On its origin, he points out some analogies with the Egyptian Ahikar- collection. Von Fritz (349) writes of the re- markable consistency with which Dem. carried his materialistic theory through his theory of vision. McGibbon finds (357) that religion was important to him; he believed in the divinity of Mind and also in polytheism. Citing Miss Lutz's article (355) for its collection of material, Luria speculates (353) on the tradition about the weep- ing and the laughing philosopher. Heraclitus' social pessimism was uncongenial to progressive and democratic types, and the reverse was true of Dem's. socially optimistic view. The Sophists.

Zucker, F., "Der Stil des Gorgias nach seiner inneren Form," SDAW 1956, no. 1). There has been a fair amount of work on the Sophists, though some still feel that they do not receive their due. Kirk and Raven de- cided to leave them out; it will be interesting to read Guthrie's third volume. Aside from Capizzi's competent but very discursive edition of Protagoras (365), Untersteiner's four fasci- coli (366) comprise the only important publica- tion of Sophistic texts in recent years. It is full of learning and very thorough in bibliography and comment, but shares the eccentricity of his other editions; and perhaps his approach leads to more distortion in this case than with the Eleatics. Even more "to be used with caution" is The Sophists, still, in Miss Freeman's transla- tion, the only book-length treatment in English (393). A forceful criticism of Untersteiner's treatment of the man-measure fragment is made by Holland (379). Prof. von Fritz has contributed to RE a concise but comprehensive and sympathetic treatment of Protagoras (377); and Zeppi (397) also deals with all the important Protagorean problems. Sciacca (390) believes that fr. 1, on the gods, is to be taken as basis for interpretation of the others, rather than the reverse. The prac- tical purpose of the man-measure fragment is emphasized by Versenyi (394). Methodological caution is exercised by Kerferd (384), who de- cides that the interpretation of the myth in Plato's Protagoras does not justify conclusions about the Sophist's own views, and by Fehling (375), who argues, in the first of his "two stu- dies," that Prot's. pronouncements on language (A 1, 27, 28, 29, 25) are all spun out of A 25. On Gorgias, there is discussion as to whether he is a philosopher at all, or even a Sophist. He was not, but a rhetor, says Harrison (378). Segal's thoughtful analysis (391) of Gorgias' rhetorical practice and theory, with considera- tion of the extent of its relation to his interest in metaphysical and physical problems, empha- sizes his rational approach. Coulter (372) and Zucker (398) discuss stylistic matters; and Calogero (369), like Coulter, makes a connexion with Socrates. The arguments and purport of the book On nature, or On that which is not are discussed by Kerferd (382) and others, and the widely different conclusions show that this topic is not exhausted. E.g., Sicking (392) concludes that the book is a sort of challenge to the philosophers, a piece of "anti-philosophy," while Brocker (368) maintains that it is a piece of polemic against the Eleatics, and di Benedetto (367) thinks that though Gorgias was not ac- tually defending the Eleatics, his main target was Protagoras. Prodicus has also been studied for RE by von Fritz (376). In his ethical attitude he finds a "solid bourgeois morality of industriousness and moderation." And perhaps this is not far different from the "utilitarian eudaemonism" which Zeppi finds in him (395), and which was to be the basis of the morality of Socrates and Democritus. How many Antiphons were there? Dodds (374) argued from Xenophon that the Sophist could not be the same as the orator or the author of the book on dream-interpretation. Morrison had already pro- nounced differently on this topic, and a renewed in- vestigation (388) led him to decide against the dis- tinction of orator from Sophist. (A later article analyzes the fragments to establish the content of the book Truth [389].) Luria then brought forward additional arguments for the distinction (387). Ker- ferd (383) had sought to solve one of the persistent difficulties by maintaining that the views ex- pressed in the well-known papyrus fragments were not Antiphon's own but those of others, so that the apparent contradiction with the book On harmony is removed. Cole's study (370) well characterizes the work of the Anonymus lamblichi, and establishes his affiliations with Democritus and Protagoras, as well as discussing how some of the same ideas made their way to Cicero's De officiis. We may conclude with the lone study of a lonely man, Jacoby's little book on Diagoras "the atheist" (381), though Jacoby, while he seems to feel (rightly) that Diagoras ought to have been included in DK, refuses to dogmatize about how he ought to be classified.
