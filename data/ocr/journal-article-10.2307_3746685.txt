<plain_text><page sequence="1">GREAT THINKERS (VI) DESCARTES PROFESSOR A. BOYCE GIBSON THERE is a belief among the aborigines of Central Australia that the attributes of the divine ancestor are parcelled out among the component members of the tribe: and there are long periods in the history of ideas in which "divine philosophy" is similarly dismem- bered. The reason is that all great philosophical systems rest on a balanced tension of contemporary cultural elements, and as these change, and especially if they change rapidly or decisively, the unity of thought under which they have been gathered begins to disintegrate. There follows a period of piecemeal experiment, in which the material of philosophy is too rich and too disorganized to be appropriated in a single conspectus: a period in which there will be no great philosophers, and perhaps little conscious philoso- phizing, not because philosophic genius is lacking, but because there is no scope for it till the various special tendencies of the age have achieved a certain internal development and a definite sense of direction. Such a period was the Renaissance. Not only did it encourage fruitful comparisons by confronting the authority of the Church with the still older authority of classical civilization, but it estab- lished a new outlook in science and religion, and out of the resultant intellectual chaos came a new cultural motif, the passion for per- sonal independence. While these changes were taking place, the official philosophy stood still: and indeed, vested interests apart, there was little else it could do. In philosophy a culture becomes self-conscious: and first of all it must be clearer about its own nature than it can possibly be in its early stages. But the time came, early in the seventeenth century, when a provisional estimate of the forces at work became possible: and fortunately (for the hour does not always bring forth the man) a "great thinker" was there to attempt it. That thinker was Descartes. The mental equipment required by the philosopher in an era of reconstruction is not at all points the same as that which is needed at the culminating synthetic stage of development. Then what is especially indispensable is a wide intellectual sympathy which extends to every sphere of knowledge the range of a centralizing logic. For this task Descartes might have been ill adapted. He 428</page><page sequence="2">DESCARTES was too impatient, too contemptuous, too much a man of high lights and straight lines, too little inclined to bend in accord with the significant sinuosities of experience. But in the initial stages a certain radicalism of thought and temper is the supreme virtue. The old outlines have to be cleared out of the way before the new factors can assume philosophic expression. What is important is that the philosopher shall be acquainted from the inside with the important tendencies of the new culture, reproducing its conflicts microcosmically, and not without agony, in his own soul. He does not need a sense of history (which Descartes completely lacked) but he does need a sense of contemporaneity. To such a demand Des- cartes was entirely equal. As a mathematician, he was the discoverer of co-ordinate geometry. As a physicist he propounded the theory of vortices, which, if soon displaced, seriously occupied the attention of his contemporaries. He was independently and disinterestedly concerned for religion, and in the Oratorian circle had learnt to dissociate it, in the modern fashion, from all cosmologies. Finally, he shared with the men of the Renaissance a spirit of personal initiative and sceptical freedom on which, as all other certainties gave way under the dissolving influence of methodical doubt, he was to stake the whole success of his great intellectual adventure. The danger to which a philosophical personalism is always exposed is that of turning philosophy into psychology. Descartes escaped it, for the self which is his primary metaphysical certainty is a thinking self, and subject therefore to the authority of reason. It is in the name of reason that he dismisses tradition: it is his special task to disinter its eternal principles from the venerable debris of accumu- lated learning. But, with the fine precision of his nation, he knew that reason could be revealed only in actual reasoning: and so his personalism and his rationalism go together. They are part of a single protest against the laborious compilation of precedents which condemned philosophy to proceed by increasing subtlety of self- criticism alone, to the exclusion of new non-philosophical material now clamouring to be heard. It may be that his personal approach to philosophy made him press too hard the antithesis between authority and reason: but it fairly excluded any appeal beyond reason save such as reason itself could justify. Moreover, where there was as yet no rational solution of a problem in sight, as in the case of morals, Descartes was almost excessively emphatic in recom- mending a provisional conformity with established usage. The first rule of method laid down by Descartes for the regula- tion of the understanding is "never to accept anything as true which I did not evidently know to be true." There are two sides to this injunction: a moral and an epistemological. There are out- 429</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY standing temptations to emotional bias which all sound thinking must resist, and sooner or later they are all reducible to precipitate judgment. This, according to Descartes, is chargeable to the will, which in its "potential infinity" outruns intellectual certainty. A practical illustration of the error induced by the incongruity is the acceptance of sensory evidence at its face value. Another is con- tinued reliance on early instruction which, in the nature of things, could not have been rationally sifted. A third is illustrated in the actual life of Descartes, who withdrew from the distractions of Parisian society in order to keep the field clear for meditation. The intellect must maintain its directness of vision, or it will misapprehend its object; and the will to defend it is part of morality. The fundamental bearing of the rule, however, is epistemological, as the end of such morality is to hold fast to knowledge conceived in a peculiar way. The primary object of all the rules of method is to give an account of the reasoning process which shall be true to the actual procedure of science, and thus to eliminate the initial obscurities which Descartes holds to have been incorporated into the Aristotelean philosophy of nature. Now in science as Descartes understood it, that is, in physics, the investigator selects from what is given in perception what he desires to isolate for closer study. Descartes took the momentous and questionable step of qualifying this abstraction as real, thereby committing himself, and philosophers for some time to come, to a materialistic interpretation of nature, and leaving the phenomena of perception uneasily suspended between two worlds. At least one reason why Descartes condemns reliance on the senses is that it has given rise to the pseudo-science of powers and essences, while true science must pass beyond it. His religious prepossessions, however, pointed in the same direction, for the Oratory was in the straight line of succession through St. Augustine from Plato: and Descartes also claimed that an analysis of per- ception itself (of a piece of wax, for example) will show that there is a hard core which is irreducible, namely extension in space, together with much else that is both changing and fortuitous, and so a mere deceptive appearance. The original clarity of ideas, from which all reconstruction must begin, is thus effected by a series of disjunctive judgments in which what is clear is rendered distinct from what is obscure: whence the phrase, "clear and distinct ideas." This is the bearing of the second rule of method, which enjoins a thoroughgoing analysis of presentations into their constituent elements. It is Descartes's belief that perfect clarity is in fact attainable; that the confusions of his predecessors have been due to defective analysis alone; and that the "natural light" assures us that clear and distinct ideas are 430</page><page sequence="4">DESCARTES true. Provided we eliminate confusion, the rational intuition which is the soul of reason will go straight to its goal. Original intuition is immediate: it does not depend on the previous recognition of general principles, such as the law of contradiction. On the contrary, all such laws are revealed in the first place in the concrete context of rational intuition. Nor does the truth of intuitions depend on a system of judgments to be later unfolded. It is in principle both ungrounded and incorrigible. But it is not on that account unconditioned. Indeed, the fact that it needs no ground and suffers no correction is due to a certain structure of the universe. The epistemological solution pushes us back to metaphysics. The isolation of essential factors through analysis is not, how- ever, the whole of scientific procedure. The positive aspect of it is the construction of hypothetical syntheses followed by exhaustive verification. To these activities Descartes refers in his third and fourth rules of method. But he is by no means clear in his detailed account of them. He describes the constructive aspect of science as "deduction," as if it were analytically deducible from the first principles isolated by the original disjunction. Either the term is misleading, or Descartes is guilty of a contradiction; for that which is clearly and distinctly perceived is already a "simple nature" and therefore insusceptible of further analysis. On his own showing, there must be a synthetic element in scientific knowledge: a putting together of elements detached from various contexts, in a new and significant order. But in actual scientific procedure what is syn- thesized is the evidence of the senses: concepts, as Kant was to point out, are not objects of intuition, but principles of interpretation. Descartes, having eliminated the senses, has nothing left to syn- thesize, except the general principles which should be doing the synthesizing. This is why, in the long run, he slurs his third rule of method, and falls back, inconsistently enough, on an analytic theory of knowledge and the doctrine of innate ideas. As time went on, it became increasingly clear that the under- standing of nature depends on the range of observations and the relevance of the questions put to nature by the investigator. Descartes was probably misled by an over-simple conception of the application of mathematical formulae to nature. His geometrical view of physics implied the annihilation of the material of physics, besides forcing him to appeal to a deus ex machina to explain motion. Whatever the cause of the confusion, the consequence is serious enough. Descartes is unable to explain what part is to be played in science by verification. Theoretically, his physics requires no experiment, and its use is purely expository. If knowledge is of the relation of concepts which are assumed in advance to cover particular cases, and knowledge advances solely through the manipulation of 43I</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHY the concepts themselves, there can be no relevant verification at all. Thus Descartes's theory of science does justice neither to con- temporary practice, nor to his own practice, nor to his programme as set forth in the rules of method. It is a striking illustration of the power of established modes of logical thought over the most teme- rarious innovator.' But by insisting on clarity prior to construction, and by pitting intuition against precedent, he cleared the way for a more adequate estimate of the significance of science at a later date. But apart from difficulties of detail, Descartes's whole epistemo- logical position depends on the assumption that what is clearly and distinctly perceived is true. Now this is possible only if there is some proportion between our minds at their best and the objective order of the world. That such an order should exist is not self- evident: and Descartes personifies the possible discrepancy in the shape of the wicked genius. Now the strength of the wicked genius lies in his strategic occupation of the passage from subject to object, which he blocks at all points. He can be circumvented only if there is no need to attempt the passage, that is to say, if there is a form of existence which is from the beginning both subject and object, which both thinks and exists. Such a form of existence can be dis- covered, at the end of a persistent process of methodical doubt, in the thinking, or, more accurately, the doubting self; for, in order to doubt, I must exist: and of this I am aware in an unmediated act of intuitive introspection, independently of any further truth whatever. In one sense the cogito, i.e. the identity of thought and existence in the thinker, is a clear and distinct conception just like any other: and Descartes sometimes holds that its metaphysical certainty forthwith justifies all the rest. But it could not provide the neces- sary justification if it were not in some sense unique, for nothing can be justified by a mere duplicate of itself. Perhaps it may be said that "the difference is one of metaphysical status, not of internal structure."z The truth of other clear and distinct ideas depends on the truth of the cogito, not merely because the cogito is a clear and distinct idea, but because it is metaphysical. But even so the dependence is not direct. A metaphysical self cannot give metaphysical status to its objects: however much I may think a statement to be true, it does not follow that it is true. Only in a completely rational universe would the conclusion hold. The wicked genius, who has recoiled from the centre, has now to be driven from the outworks. Descartes has to widen the scope of metaphysical reality till it includes all existence: and he has to ' For the development of this point, see C. R. Morris, Idealistic Logic, ch. iv. z See my Philosophy of Descartes, p. I6I, note. 432</page><page sequence="6">DESCARTES start with only the thinking self. His next step is to follow its expanding implications till they include the existence of God. The originality of Descartes's proofs of the existence of God lies less in their argumentation, which is full of scholastic reminis- cence, than in their starting-point, which lends a new meaning to old terms and old methods of reasoning. They all start, directly or indirectly, from the self of the cogito, with its baffling sense of defect, and its no less baffling sense of perfection. This is true even of the revived ontological proof: the essence from which, in the special case of God, it is claimed to be permissible to pass to existence cannot, in the context, be conceived abstractly, but only as an idea or concept in the human mind. The other proofs, which proceed respectively from the idea of a possible perfection and from the fact of the self which possesses it, to inquire into their origin, leave no room for ambiguity. The general contention is that perfection cannot issue from imperfection, and that the imperfect cannot have created itself, because if it had it would have created itself perfect. With the theory of evolution fresh in our minds we may find it hard to assent to such propositions as statements about history. But regarded as statements about the conditions of the existence of the imperfect as such they have a permanent claim on our atten- tion. The existence of the imperfect may be traceable to the less perfect: but its consciousness of itself as imperfect implies a reference to an independent standard of value, or, as Descartes would have said, of perfection. There is no reason to doubt that Descartes was satisfied with his proofs of God's existence, or that he was entirely sincere in his frequent professions of piety. The recent researches of French scholars, and particularly of M. Gilson, have revealed his religious preoccupations so convincingly that it is no longer possible to suppose that the religious bias of his metaphysics is merely a cover for his theory of science, or unscrupulously adapted to its needs. Moreover, the emphasis, even the exclusive emphasis, on the approach to God through personal experience was thoroughly in accord with the religious tendencies of the age, not only among Protestants, who openly acknowledged it, but also in the Catholic Church itself: and in stating it philosophically Descartes was ful- filling his function of bringing under a rational synthesis the cultural developments of recent history. But there is also no doubt that the exclusively personal approach saved Descartes from embarrassment on the side of science. It enabled him "to banish final causes from the universe," or, more strictly, from nature. As long as nature is thought of as adapted in detail to formal qualitative principles, natural law will, in its own province, be at the best based on abstrac- tion, and at the worst subject to arbitrary interference. But as 2E 433</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY Descartes appeals not to the incompleteness of nature, but to the incompleteness of the person, he is able to assert at the same time both that nature as a whole is dependent externally on God, and that it is a closed quantitative system wholly regulated by natural law. Dependence as a whole does not threaten the integrity of science, but only the amour propre of scientists. As a matter of fact, Descartes usually envisages God in relation to nature simply as creator, though he occasionally hints that the mechanical system of nature, internally free from teleology, none the less fits as a whole, though distantly and indirectly, into a teleological structure. The proofs of the existence of God raise at once the most contro- versial of all the issues connected with the interpretation of Descartes: the Cartesian circle, and the nature of the divine guarantee. In the first place, the metaphysical validity of the causal axiom is assumed to prove the existence of God, without whose concourse no axiom has more than an abstract validity. There is here a vicious circle, which can be escaped only by reinterpreting one or both of the arguments. If causality could be softened into implication, or if the intuition of the self were held to include from the first a wider intuition of God, the supremacy of God over the primary axioms could be indicated without the prior assumption of those axioms, and there would be no contradiction. Or if the truth of axioms did not require the guarantee of God, but were self-evident in its own right, and the guarantee were invoked merely to certify that what I now remember to have been true is in fact identical with what I once perceived to be true, then the primary axioms could legiti- mately be used to prove the existence of God, and again there would be no contradiction. In reply to the charge of circularity, Descartes usually takes the second way of escape; and most of the critics think it is a fair one. Actually it ignores several capital passages, and it leads to the conclusion, which Descartes could never have accepted, that the elements of a rational universe are independent of the concourse of God. In another mood, more disinterested, because there is no question of escaping from a dilemma, he actually asserts that God might have created the "eternal verities" other- wise than He did: and whatever the difficulties of this theory, it is at least inconsistent with the view that the verities are self-subsistent. The first way of escape also has its difficulties, as it tends to reduce the whole of metaphysics to a single simultaneous intuition of the self and God. But, though it is hard to state it in a shape free from formal objection, it does, I am convinced, embody the under- lying spirit of Descartes's philosophy. The apprehension of the self in the cogito is not the apprehension of a distinct entity. The aspira- tions which form its link with God, and in view of which it is conscious of its defect simultaneously with its existence, "actually 434</page><page sequence="8">DESCARTES constitute it, and without them it would simply not be there at all." If this is so, "the discovery of God is effected, not by argument, but by sustained attention to the (original) intuition, which reveals under scrutiny more than we first observed in it."I It can hardly be too much emphasized that Descartes was a strongly religious man, and much of the difficulty of his "natural theology" arises from his attempt to convey the immediacies of the religious life in the form of logical arguments. What appears as a process from point to point really represents a deepening appreciation of the inseparability of the self from God. However this may be, the theory of the divine guarantee enables Descartes to solve the most pressing antinomy of the times, as reflected in his own divided interests: that which arose from the conflicting claims of religion and science. Descartes has succeeded in maintaining the supremacy of God and at the same time handing over to the physicist a charter of complete independence in his own delegated sphere. The theory does not mean that God makes true what once was not true: it means that what is true, and was always true, is in fact true because there is, and always was, a God. It is wholly true, but only because of a truth more fundamental on which the whole principle of truth depends. Thus the scientist can exercise his privilege and drive the philosopher out of science, but only because he has a philosophical credential to do so. The philo- sopher, on the other hand, standing by the ultimate religious verities, admits and insists upon the independence of science, but maintains that he alone is in a position to bestow it. In a rational universe such as our universe has now been proved to be, it follows that that which can be conceived apart from other things is essentially distinct from them. Now the self can be con- ceived without any reference to the extended world: therefore it is essentially distinct from the extended world. On the other hand, the extended world can be clearly conceived in isolation from the human spirit: therefore it is essentially distinct from the human spirit. This rigorous dualism is essential to a proper adjustment of the respective claims of science and religion. If Descartes is to justify the new mechanistic physics against the mediaeval philosophy of nature he must refuse to allow spiritual causation in nature. If he is to justify religion against the growing naturalism of his times, he must show that spirit is not subject to natural law, because it lives in a world, not of necessity, but of standards and aspirations. The dualism is, of course, subject to the overarching unity of God; but the two factors are in no sense dependent upon each other. I This point is treated more fully in The Philosophy of Descartes, p, 321, from which these passages are quoted. 435</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY It is to be observed that the distinction is one of essence and not of fact, and does not involve the absurd conclusion that soul and body do not co-exist in the human being. The most it can mean is that their association is fortuitous, and is not implied in the nature of either. But even this moderate conclusion is hard to sustain in face of the facts of emotion and sense-perception. These are pheno- mena involving a mutual impact of mind and body: and if they are classed as aspects of spirit (which is how Descartes does class them), then it is part of the essence of spirit to contain elements depending on the co-operation of the body: and this is contrary to the hypothesis of essential separation. Descartes is so much impressed by these considerations that he sometimes seems to treat the human being as a new sort of quasi-substance, body-mind, or mind-body: and on this basis he founds his account of sense-perception. This is a tribute to his sense of fact (always a matter to be reckoned with in Descartes) rather than to his consistency. On the other hand, in his account of the "animal-machine," and in certain isolated concessions to Occasionalism, consistency prevails. In any case, in view of the importance of his dualism to his philosophy as a whole, it indicates a deep-seated defect that he is unable to maintain it without either compromise or blindness. Descartes is sometimes alluded to as the father of Idealism: and we may conclude this cursory review by inquiring in what sense (if any) he deserves the title. There are two senses in which its use is plausible; and they are both associated with the method of doubt. In the first place, Descartes holds the representative theory of perception: and it is on the gap between the idea which represents and the reality which is represented that the first attack of metho- dical doubt is concentrated. As the existence of the idea qua idea is undeniable, while it is at least possible to think away the object, then, as long as metaphysical certainty is lacking, we can know nothing but ideas. But Descartes's whole philosophy is one long struggle for metaphysical certainty, and the real question therefore is whether, when it has been achieved, his Idealism is overthrown together with the doubts which give rise to it. Descartes's usual reply is that to attain certainty we must leave the senses behind us, and that perception can never be anything but indirect. He comes to be assured that there is a real material world, "the exis- tence of which was never doubted by any sensible person," but what we have in perception is merely a selected appearance adapted to our practical needs. Thus, though Descartes is not an idealist in the sense of believing that the real world is ideal, he is an idealist in his theory of perception: and his view was to have important consequences in the hands of successors who held that the senses are the only gateway to knowledge. 436</page><page sequence="10">DESCARTES In the second place, in allowing himself to doubt the truth of clear and distinct ideas, Descartes drives another wedge between idea and reality: and as long as the discrepancy remains, no know- ledge, even the most scientific, can be more than ideal. As before, the question is what happens when idea and reality are reconciled. The answer is that some knowledge, including the abstract know- ledge of logic and mathematics, is ontologically certificated, but does not thereby become knowledge of the real: that other know- ledge, namely knowledge of nature as conceived by the physicist, is of extension which really exists, but is mediated through the former kind of knowledge which is ideal: and that the supreme knowledge, knowledge of the.self and of God, is knowledge of the real without any qualification whatever. How far this constitutes Idealism may be left to the private judgment of individuals, and will depend on the sense they assign to their terms. But as any Idealist tendencies it contains are ultimately subject to a theistic realism, it is perhaps best to say that the true bent of Descartes's philosophy is not Idealist, though it embodies Idealist trends whose historical significance is greater than their importance in their original context. If we ask, in the phrase made familiar by Croce, what is living and what is dead in the philosophy of Descartes, we shall find that there is much to discard, including structurally central positions essential to a synthesis of contemporary culture. His dualism died early, and the distinction of soul and body, which he affirmed so stoutly against the quasi-behaviourism of Aristotle, is now, even in most reasonable forms, somewhat outmoded. His views on per- ception, though not wholly abandoned, are regarded in the most advanced quarters as an obstacle to progress. His theory of the logic of science, though it has recently had a St. Martin's Summer revival, has never really recovered from the criticism of Kant. For these and other alleged philosophical crimes, he has been branded by Professor Hoernle as "the father of all evil in modern philosophy."I But it will perhaps repay us better to dwell on what is living, and it may then appear that the aberrations are the complement of the triumphs. In any case, it is well to remember that doctrines of great philosophers which seem to be dead are often only sleeping until other philosophers see good to revive them. The permanent contributions of Descartes to philosophy, that is to say, those which have been, and still are, continuously fruitful, may be concentrated under three headings. (I) Descartes was the first philosopher of any age to put the conception of personality at the centre of his system. Greek philo- sophy was so exclusively outward-looking that it did not pause to IStudies in Contemporary Metaphysics, p. 241. 437</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY contemplate the process of contemplation; and it thus omitted from its explanation of things that which most of all needed explain- ing, namely, the fact that there is explaining. The philosophy of the Middle Ages, while enhancing the importance of the human soul, and thus making possible the personalist philosophies of a later epoch, was in spirit traditional and anonymous, and continued to view souls in the Greek manner, from the outside. The spiritual self of the cogito is not simply an object, whether of contemplation or of moral duty, but a subject, only to be understood through the immediate experience of a subject. Henceforward, thanks to the new and inward conception of the person, he will always be a source of action as well as merely active. He will be distinguished from nature by the gift of freedom, or the capacity to choose and originate; and it is this one unescapable fact which has for ever made material- ism impossible. It is sometimes suggested that the new conception threw the shadow of humanity over all objects of knowledge, rendering the clear apprehension of nature difficult till our own time. This would be a tragically ironical result for a philosophy which set out to destroy the anthropomorphism of mediaeval science, but in so far as Descartes's conclusions have contributed to it, it is through other people's misunderstandings. As a matter of fact, the Cartesian con- ception of the person combines with the Cartesian conception of nature to abolish a conception of both person and nature in which each was misunderstood owing to the influence of the other: and the salient contrast, which was then first revealed, brought out for the first time the undramatic, unspiritual, and unhuman quality of nature as such. Again, Descartes's discovery of the self is not simply the discovery of a principle of apprehension: and in this sense it is far removed from that intellectualist abstraction, the "transcendental unity of apperception." This is due to the admirable, and thoroughly French, concreteness of Descartes's approach to the issue. The self as he depicts it not merely knows, but comes to know through the positive exercise of freedom: it refuses to be satisfied with anything less than the indubitable. The self revealed in the moment of doubt is a moral and a thinking self at the same time: the occasion of its resistance is a threat to intellectual integrity, but the resistance itself is moral in its quality. (2) It may seem strange to reckon Descartes's philosophical theology among his permanent contributions, and still stranger to award them a high contemporary significance. It is supposed to have been demolished by Kant in the Transcendental Dialectic (though, as a matter of fact, Kant's keenest shafts were meant for others, and leave him unscathed), and to be worthy of discreet oblivion. But Descartes really anticipates the modern theological 438</page><page sequence="12">DESCARTES emphasis which came in with Kant's positive contribution to the subject in the Critique of Practical Reason. What Kant should have put an end to for all time was the purely intellectual concep- tion of God. He may have been wrong in holding that the intellect has nothing to do with the apprehension of God, but he was surely right in affirming that a God whose attributes may be apprehended by philosophy alone has nothing in common with the God of religion. Now from Descartes's own position, though he certainly did not fully understand it, the same conclusion necessarily follows. God, for him, is not so much an object as the complement of the subject, and hence responsive not merely to apprehension, but to the sub- ject as a whole. Challenged for a definition of what he meant by God, Descartes replied, "the greatest perfection which it is possible to conceive." Such a perfection can only be reflected in the whole life of man. It is true that Descartes essays proofs in the traditional manner, and to that extent Kant's criticism may apply to him. On the other hand, he avoids the still narrower error of Kant, who looked for evidence of God in the moral life alone. The conception of perfection covers every form of valuation: and the evidence of defect and aspiration establishes in each case the objectivity of the value. It is on this point, the objectivity of value, that Descartes's conceptions are of modern interest. His argument "that the more cannot come from the less" may be ontologically false, but it is axiologically true. Moreover, the main consideration which he urges, that the self cannot be the source of the standards by reference to which alone it exists, is still the main contention of those who deny that value is merely a projection of the subject. Even the concentration of value in a supreme ontological entity, which is not fashionable in modern discussion, may eventually provide inspiration to those who, starting from other hypotheses, are per- plexed by the participation of values in each other, and by the participation of the person in all. Indeed, if ever I were tempted to formulate a philosophy of religion based on recent inquiries into value, it is from Descartes that I should begin. (3) Descartes, partly through his dualism, and partly by his subjection of scientific method to metaphysical verification, has bequeathed to his successors a clear sense, which they can ill afford to lose, of the difference, both of province and of method, between philosophy and science. Taken as a whole, Descartes's dualism is a stone of stumbling, but it does at least have the effect of precluding the unreasoning application of the categories of natural science to human behaviour. Descartes may be wrong in holding that exten- sion cannot belong to the essence of a spiritual being. He is certainly right in holding that the essence of a spiritual being is not merely extension. Moreover, he has made it clear, by presenting the human 439</page><page sequence="13">PHILOSOPHY spirit as undergoing the temptations of the wicked genius, that one of its distinguishing qualities is a critical freedom. His conclusions on this head are confirmed by his doctrine of the divine guarantee, which implies that science receives a certificate of certainty from philosophy. It is a heartening precedent for such unrepentant believers in metaphysics as still exist, and are dismayed by the copious contemporary burning of sufficiently stale incense to "the idol of scientific method." After all, the great ages of philosophy are those in which she makes great claims for herself: and Descartes, himself a scientist of no mean distinction, who had helped, both by his theoretical revolution and by his practical discoveries, to deliver science from Aristotelean bondage, could admit and press them without prejudice and without embarrassment. His estimate is therefore of peculiar significance. No account of Descartes can be complete without some reference to his position on the watershed between two epochs. His was a curious, eager, restless, essentially practical nature, with a contra- dictory passion for solitude and contemplation. Owing to his inner complexity, he was able to enter intimately into the diverse sym- pathies of his day. At times, absorbed in the prospect of the mastery of nature through science, he speaks with the breathless confidence of the coming age of progress. At others, he goes out of his way to stress the unimportance of environment, and preaches Seneca's doctrine of contentment in oneself almost in Seneca's words. As in his life, so in his intellectual emphasis, he alternated between two unreconciled tendencies, and never effected a satisfactory synthesis. He was mediaeval or intensely modern, Stoic or utili- tarian, naively pious or radically sceptical, gazing raptly into eternity or peering greedily into the future, according to mood and circum- stance. There is something of this shifting antinomical tendency in his philosophy: for example, the contrast between his trenchant dualism of mind and body, and his interactionist theory of per- ception. It is the result of a passion for clear outline combined with a scrupulous honesty in the facing of facts. A less vivid and less impatient mind might have halted before presenting its conclusions in their original sharpness. A less inquiring or a less balanced mind might have overlooked the difficulties which beset them. A less rigorous or a less honourable mind might have covered the retreat more skilfully, and confused the issue by a false pretence of con- sistency. Descartes was not of those thinkers who can cut a philo- sophy all of a piece. Perhaps this is part of his fascination and suggestiveness. If I may quote the saying of a beloved senior and former colleague, Descartes would not have been called "the father of modern philosophy," if he had not left so many problems behind him for his children. 440</page></plain_text>
