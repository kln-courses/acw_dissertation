Hopkins EXTRAVAGANT   BEHOLDING:  LOVE ,   I DEAL  BODIES ,  AND   PARTICULARITY i. introduction: dilemmas of desire In the recent documentary film by Amy Kofman and Kirby Dick on Jacques Derrida, there is a strange and rather humorous exchange with Derrida on the subject of  “love” (l’amour), after the philosopher and the filmmaker/interviewer clear up a confusion about the exact topic at hand, at first mistakenly taken as “death” (la mort).1 The pun in French here, due to mispronunciation, like the Derridean “différance,” is telling. It’s a Any comparative study such as this assumes a long list of  colleagues who have helped to clarify arguments and refine comparisons across several traditions and languages. I am in- debted, over a period of  many years, to Moshe Idel, Charles Hallisey, John Strong, Nathaniel Deutsch, Michael Sells, Barbara Holdrege, Vasudha Narayanan, Yudit Kornberg Greenberg, Indira Peterson, and Scott Kugle for their support, suggestions, and encouragement along the way. I am also grateful to Elizabeth Pérez and Stephanie Frank, editorial assistants for History of Religions, to the anonymous readers for the journal, and particularly to Daniel Boyarin, the outside reader, for his close and generous reading of  the manuscript. 1 See Derrida, directed by Kirby Dick and Amy Kofman, 84 minutes, English, French (United States: Jane Doe Films, 2002). The pun is of  course obvious and predictable, and it is everywhere present in European literature. It makes one of  its most memorable and funny appearances in a German book, in Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain, where the novel’s hero speaks passionately (in French, of  course) about “the body, love, and death” as simply “one and the same” (le corps, l’amour, la mort, ces trois ne font qu’un) to his erstwhile, indifferent beloved Clavdia Chauchat (“hotcat”) in a parody of  Goethe’s Faustian Walpurgis Nacht. See Thomas Mann, The Magic Mountain, trans. John E. Woods (New York: Everyman’s Library, 1995), 406–7. The punning is of  course lost in the Woods translation, which renders the French of  the original German text into English.

At first saying that he is incapable of  “generalities about love,” that he has an “empty head” about it, Derrida poses a series of  suggestive insights, some of  which will guide our study of  this vexed but crucial topic in religion and literature through the particularly vivid poetic motif  of  loving bodily description. love: the who and the what Derrida inquires about “love” since Plato: Is this love the love of someone or the love of  something (quelqu’un, quelque chose)? Does one love someone for the absolute singularity of  what they are, or does one love the qualities (the beauty, youth, intelligence, excellence) of  that person, the “way that person is”? Does one love someone or does one love some- thing about someone? At the heart of  love, Derrida remarks, there is a difference between “the who and the what” (le qui et le quoi), a difference that “separates the heart.” Love dies, he says, when the beloved falls short of  the “idea” or “ideals” held by the lover: the other person, after all, is not like “this or that.” That is, he summarizes, “the history of  love, the heart of  love, is divided between the who and the what.” To love is to be true to someone, irreducibly, concretely—but love will ultimately die in that singular individual’s inability to “be” the “what.” Love, ultimately, is about potentially unrealizable ideals, beautiful ideas, Truth and Beauty beyond individual objects of  love. One might also think, in another con- text, of  the savage prose poem of  Baudelaire in The Spleen of Paris, “Laquelle est la vraie?” where, after the death of  “a certain” Benedicta “who filled the atmosphere with the ideal,” a miraculous girl who was “too beautiful to live long,” the narrator is tormented by “a little person who bore a singular resemblance” to the miraculous but dead beloved, and who, as she tramples the still-loose and damp earth of  the grave site “with an hysterical and bizarre violence,” cackles with laughter and says: “It’s me, the true Benedicta! It’s me, a famous lousy bitch! And to punish your foolishness and your blindness you shall love me as I am!” In despair, the narrator, one leg sinking into the damp ground, like a wolf  caught in a trap, ends up literally with one foot in the “grave of  the ideal.”2 Love, eros, l’amour here, is corrosive and deeply ambivalent; far from simple union or loving presence, it speaks to us of  unattainability (of  the ideal) and dissatisfaction, a constant stretching forth; its goals are neither simple nor univocal. Love here is division, fissure, fracture, duality, vulner- ability, and a horizontal asymmetry. To be in love is to become a victim 2 Le spleen de Paris 38 in Baudelaire: Oeuvres complètes, vol. 1, texte établi, présenté, et annoté par Claude Pichois (Paris: Bibliothèque de la Pléiade, 1975), 342. </page> <page sequence="3">                                                                             History of Religions 3 of  ideals, in Baudelaire’s image, in the end, to be stuck in the mud, to have one foot in the grave of  one’s own ideal. love’s rising stairs and flickering lightning Derrida’s remarks and Baudelaire’s prose poem allude to tensions in the theory and practice of  love that indeed have deep roots in early Greek lit- eratures, in Plato’s dialogues, particularly the Symposium and Phaedrus, and in the discourses of  the later Stoa. Eros is “sweetbitter” (klukupikron), as Sappho would say; and to Pausanius in Plato’s Symposium eros is a poikilos nomos, a law that is “dappled,” “spangled,” “devious,” “abstruse,” “subtle,” of  scintillating, destabilizing ambivalence.3 Greek sources speak about both division and idealized unity, of  love’s ambivalent and necessary powers. Socrates’ famous speech in the Symposium summarizing the doctrine of  eros attributed to the Mantinean wise woman Diotima would seem to successfully domesticate the native unruliness of  eros. There Socrates- Diotima charts an ordered, stepwise, goal-focused “ascent of  eros,” from earthly to heavenly forms of  love, from love of  the individual person, the individual body, the “who” of  Derrida—a love vulnerable to pain and attachment, to need and desire—to love of  his/her qualities, love of  beau- tiful objects or ideas (logous kalous [210A]), the “what,” and finally, beyond, to a great sea of  beauty and truth, a transcendental state that strips away all that is merely human in love (210A–211C). There is no longer a particular boy, a particular lovely body, but one is grounded in loveliness itself, “the Beautiful itself, absolute, pure, unmixed, not polluted by human flesh or colors or any other great nonsense of  mortality.”4 One is safe from Baudelaire’s “little” earthly Benedicta, the messy, and the foul. This is the “orthodox” love (we note as we read the repeated use of orthos in the text), a love that always leads, in an orderly manner, the lover upward “for the sake of  Beauty, starting out from beautiful things” (the particular body of  a particular beloved) and “using them like rising stairs” (hosper epanabasmois chromenon [211C]). But as Martha Nuss- baum has shown quite powerfully in her studies of  the Symposium and Phaedrus, this is hardly Plato’s final word on eros. After the Diotima speech, Alcibiades, Socrates’ young errant lover, bursts into the drinking 3 See Anne Carson, Eros the Bittersweet (Normal, IL: Dalkey Archive Press, 2003), 3, 23–24. 4 “ei to genoito auto to kalon idein eilikrives, katharon, amikton, alla me anapleon sarkon te anthropinon kai chromaton kai alles polles phlurias . . .

Plato reveals eros at the end of  the Symposium in all its dividedness. On the one hand, we have the view of  love as potentially ennobling, as a process of  ascent that transcends its roots in the love of  an individual person, an individual body in its sexual particularity, to any beautiful body, to beautiful ideas, and to beauty and virtue itself. The “who” is tran- scended, and the “what” of  love internalized and made perfect in a self- possessed state of  virtue. On the other hand, Plato makes very powerful and concrete the argument about particularity, of  love that ruins, renders vulnerable, and courts insanity, love that makes one a slave, love that is irreducibly about another person, the other who is impossible to encom- pass, transcend, turn into a universal idea, love and its disorder, its excess, its instability, its failure. As Socrates says of  his fatal lover: “I shudder at his madness and passion for love” (213D). Nussbaum argues that this dilemma, this tension at the heart of  eros, is resolved by Plato in the Phaedrus—particularly in Socrates’ “recantation” speech and defense of  mania, love’s crazy vulnerability to the particular and to madness—in the “good life.”6 Socrates has just listened to Phaedrus read to him a learned discourse on love by a certain “Lysias,” whom Phaedrus deeply admires, where the author recommends that the young man avoid accepting the service of  one who loves him and seek out the one “who does not love.” After criticizing Lysias for his disingenuous- ness and arbitrariness, his lack of  clear structure, and for his mere rhe- torical treatment of  this important theme, Socrates responds, his head covered, with a speech that faults love for its powerful jealousies and its lovers whose loves ultimately do more harm than good to their beloved boys, in mind, body, possessions, family, and friends. But after crossing the river, Socrates feels he has made offence; a daimonion, a “familiar 5 “The Speech of  Alcibiades,” in her The Fragility of Goodness: Luck and Ethics in Greek Tragedy and Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986), 198. 6 See Martha Nussbaum, “ ‘This Story Isn’t True’: Madness, Reason, and Recantation in the Phaedrus,” in her The Fragility of  Goodness, 200–233. One Line Long </page> <page sequence="5"> History of Religions 5 divine sign,” comes to him like a voice on the air, and he recants his pre- vious condemnation of  eros and proceeds to formulate quite another kind of  approach, one that neither condemns eros nor subsumes it, as in his “Diotima” speech in the Symposium, into some “higher” experience beyond the passions. This speech will defend eros and its mania un- diluted as being at the very heart of  the life of  virtue. What is implied in this shift is that eros in its “ascent” ceases altogether to be eros as it gives up the particular (other person). The ladder of  love is hardly a satisfac- tory answer to the real dilemmas of  desire. Real eros—the particularity of  its needs, its passions and interests and limits and vulnerability—critical to human flourishing (eudaimonia), demands that we descend the stairs, encounter again the world of  concrete risk, of  luck, to truly love, and ulti- mately to truly embark on the adventure of  eudaimonia. In Nussbaum’s summary: Unlike the life of  the ascending person in the Symposium, this best human life is unstable, always prey to conflict. The lovers have continually to struggle against inappropriate inclinations, to expend psychic effort in order to hit on what is appropriate. Unlike the ascending person, again, they risk, in the exclusivity of their attachment to a mutable object, the deep grief  of  departure, alteration, or inevitably—death. This life, unlike Diotima’s, seems to admit full-fledged conflict of  values as well, since the lovers’ devotion to one another is so particular that it might in some circumstances pull against their political commitments or their pursuit of  knowledge. . . . But Plato seems to believe that a life that lacks their passionate devotion—whether or not it had this at some former time—is lacking in beauty and value next to theirs.7 The Phaedrus ends with Socrates and the young Phaedrus (whose name means “sparkling”) discovering the “mutual love of  individuals based on character and aspiration,”8 quite subtly and gradually, in a wild dangerous place outside the city gates, near the river and near the place where, accord- ing to a legend, a young girl was carried off  by Boreas, the love-mad wind 7 Ibid., 221. Even the Stoics, as Nussbaum has argued elsewhere, famously attempt to some- how preserve eros at the heart of  friendship (philia), as virtue’s bloom, beauty’s appearance that, purified, inspires reverence and gratitude and not merely divisive, possessive desire. But as Cicero remarked in his critique of  what he perceived as inconsistencies in the Stoic theory of  love: eros is never truly present without “anxiety, longing, care sighing” (Tusculan Disputations, 4:70). When the Stoics refer to the “attempt to form a friendship on account of  the appearing beauty of  young men in their prime” (epibole philopoiias dia kallos em- phainomenon neon kai horaion), that is all well and good, but do not, says Cicero, “call it eros.” See Martha C. Nussbaum, “Eros and Ethical Norms: Philosophers Respond to a Cul- tural Dilemma,” in The Sleep of  Reason: Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece and Rome, ed. Martha C.

Socrates’ “recantation” speech, alluding in several images to Sappho’s fragments, extols the power of  a mad love that sends shudders, “strange sweating,” fever, and a tingling warmth inspired by the “stream of  beauty” that enters “in through the eyes” of  the lover at the sight of  a “godlike” face of  a beloved beautiful boy (251A–B). The speech is memorable for its vivid image-rich evocation of  sexual joy and the pains of  separation, love’s intense mad emotions, an exterior and interior jouissance and extravagant beholding that re- sponds to the physical beauty of  a beloved (and so godlike) body. And immediately after his lyrical evocation of  the positive, life-giving power of  eros that flows from the eyes, in a material “stream of  particles” (images of  desire here—himeros—are of  flow, of  a liquid light that inundates the senses),9 Socrates sounds the register of  eros’s inevitable (and seemingly immediate) decline; we have, sudden loss (exaiphnes in the Symposium), separation (choris), and the pain that “simply drives it [the soul] wild.” There are the temporary consolations of  memory, though it is pain that dominates the soul when it is separated from the immediate physical presence of  the beloved. So one is moved back and forth, from ecstatic joy, this “sweetest of  all pleasures” (edonen d’ au tauten glukutaten [251E5]) to the stings of  pain. In Socrates’ words, “From the outlandish mix of  these two feelings—pain and joy—comes anguish and helpless raving: in its madness the lover’s soul cannot sleep at night or stay put by day; it rushes, yearning, wherever it expects to see the person who has that beauty. When it does see him, it opens the sluice-gates of  desire and sets free the parts that were blocked up before” (251D–E).10 Socrates of  the Phaedrus seems to understand well the emotions of  his old wayward lover Alcibiades, his claims of  particularity in love. And just as Alcibiades does in the Sympo- sium, Socrates here claims to be speaking the “truth” about love in the form of  a “likeness.” He uses images. At the very end of  the dialogue, Socrates prays to Pan. In Nussbaum’s words, the philosopher, rejecting “the simplicity of  his former ideal” (in the Symposium speech), prays to “the mad erotic god, son of  Hermes god of luck, and to the other gods of  this wild place, asking for a beautiful inside and an outside that will be loved by that inside” (279B–C).11 9 Nehamas and Woodruff  note that the word here used for “desire,” himeros, is fancifully derived from mere (“particles”), ienai (“go”), and rhein (“flow”): thus the parenthetical em- phasis on the word. They also draw attention to a “different but equally fanciful Platonic derivation of  the same word” in Cratylus 420A, where it is linked with images of  “flow” (hrous) and eros from esron, “flowing in.” Earlier, in 418 C–D, himeros is derived from himeirousi, “to long for” light (in the darkness). Here Socrates works out from the words for day, himera or emera. See Plato, Phaedrus, trans.

A source of  loving bliss, of  tran- scendental energies, eros also writes suffering and separation into our bodies. What goes up in love, what ascends, must, finally, inevitably, in spite of  our philosophies, come down. One must descend the stairs. Ul- timately, one might say that love, and certainly the beloved, love’s ulti- mate object, is something, in its essential final unattainability, “yet to be,” or perhaps something always “about to be,” l’à-venir, a “process” phrase that Derrida will use instead of  the secure, already decided confident “future” (le futur).12 We have yet to arrive at the beloved. We languish in instability, uncertainty, division, openness, even “des- tinerrance,” another Derridean coinage.13 Love is foiled in its destination: eros the nonarriving, the everreaching. Like Sappho’s apple: As a sweet apple turns red on a high branch, high on the highest branch and the applepickers forgot— well, no they didn’t forget—were not able to reach.14 extravagant beholding: religious transformations of a lyric  love motif I argue here that various tensions in the life of  eros outlined above are vividly present in a particular literary motif  common to devotional liter- atures of  four different religious traditions—Jewish, Christian, Islamic, and Hindu—and present in four different languages: Hebrew, the Greek of  the Septuagint Bible, Arabic, and Sanskrit.15 This motif  in Jewish and 12 For a central discussion of  venir and à venir, see Derrida’s essay, “Psyché: Inventions de l’autre,” trans.

See also, for my early thinking on the Song of Songs and South Indian poetry, Steven Hopkins, “In Love with the Body of  God: Eros and the Praise of  Icons in South Indian Devotion,” Journal of Vaisnava Studies 2, no. 1 (Winter 1993): 17–54. </page> <page sequence="8"> 8 Extravagant Beholding Islamic literatures is called by the Arabic term wasf  (pl. awsaf ), which lit- erally means “description,” a poetic passage that describes in sequence, and by means of  a series of  exaggerated, sometimes artificial images, the parts of  a body (divine or human). In the medieval South Indian ‡rivaisnava Hindu tradition, such a sequential description, most commonly reserved for deities, is called an anubhava, a “relish” or “enjoyment experience” of the body of  the god Vishnu, from toe to head or head to toe, in his material form of  a temple image. In ‡rivaisnava anubhavas, like the wasfs of  the early pre-Islamic Arabic odes and their later Sufi Islamic religious trans- formations, or the flamboyant wasfs of  the Hebrew Song of Songs, the body of  the beloved dissembles itself  into dozens of  similes and metaphors, an excess that dazzles and expands in the lover’s gaze to extraordinary, multiple forms, into cosmic and earthly landscapes, across historical and mythical time, taking on animal and cultic forms. Meanwhile, the lover’s body remains, in varied degrees, simultaneously concrete and individual- ized, the beloved who stands before the lover, literally or in the elastic presence of  memory, as his or her own. Through the anubhava and the wasf, respectively, we are able to glimpse a form of  love language, what I am calling an extravagant beholding, that holds in tension together ideal visionary forms with the concrete, material reality of  the individual object of  love: we touch, all at once, particularity, presence, and transcendence, even the experience of  absence and erotic deferral, in the charged hori- zontal space of  the poem. I argue here that many of  the unresolved, even willed, ambiguities of  eros that we have alluded to through Derrida’s reluctant commentary on love and Nussbaum’s readings of  Plato’s dialogues find an elegant though sometimes fragile balance in the wasf  and anubhava. In effect, this rather obscure motif  of  love poetry and its transformations in Jewish, Christian, Islamic, and Hindu religious literatures rival the attempt— equally rhetorical and lyrical, with its own store of  extravagant images— of  Plato’s Socrates in the Phaedrus to provide a place in language for the blissful and tortuous excesses of  eros, its ideal virtues and ideal beauty but also its passionate beholding of  another person, its longing to possess a particular body, the awesome almost material infusion of  beauty through the eyes in the concrete act of  seeing and being seen: First he shudders and a fear comes over him. . . . Then he gazes at him with the reverence due to a god, and if  he weren’t afraid people would think him com- pletely mad, he’d even sacrifice to his boy as if  he were the image of  a god. Once he has looked at him, his chill gives way to sweating and a high fever, because the stream of  beauty that pours into him through his eyes warms him up and waters the growth of  his wings. Meanwhile, the heat warms him and melts the places where the wings once grew, places that were long closed off  with hard One Line Short </page> <page sequence="9"> History of Religions 9 scabs to keep the sprouts from coming back; but as nourishment flows in, the feather shafts swell and rush to grow from their roots beneath every part of  the soul (long ago, you see, the entire soul had wings). Now the whole soul seethes and throbs in this condition. Like a child whose teeth are just starting to grow in, and its gums are all aching and itching—that is exactly how the soul feels when it begins to grow wings. It swells up and aches and tingles as it grows them. But when it looks upon the beauty of  the boy and takes in the stream of particles flowing into it from his beauty (that is why it is called “desire”), when it is watered and warmed by this, then all its pain subsides and is replaced by joy. (251A–C)16 The issues that haunt Derrida and the Greeks draw their shadows across the wasf  and anubhava in very different cultural and religious contexts. As we will see, it is through the wasf  and the anubhava that love language, swelling and aching and itching, “grows wings.” Its metaphors and similes throw verbal bridges across empty space that serve both to connect and to separate lover from beloved; to touch and to preserve difference, at one and the same time: to defer finality and to prolong a certain insatiable desire. Through close readings of  particular poetic texts in Hebrew, Arabic, and Sanskrit, we will also see how the particular and the universal, Derrida’s “who” and “what” of  love, love’s crushing experience of  separation, absence, defeat, and fissure, its one foot in the grave of  the ideal and its visions of  blissful presence, are expressed in exquisite literary forms that crosscut secular and religious forms of  love. I will treat the motif  in each tradition in turn, beginning with the Hebrew and Greek Song of Songs, noting in brief  Jewish and Christian commen- tarial traditions, followed by the Arabic, qasidah in its Islamic and pre- Islamic forms, Greek Jewish texts, and the anubhava in the ‡rivaisnava tradition in South India, with special focus on the poetry of  the medieval saint-poet Ve“kate¶a. In the conclusion I will return to themes introduced at the beginning of  the article, with the addition of  Augustine and Dante on “ladders of  love,” linking these insights on love, ideal bodies, and par- ticularity with the study of  the wasf  and anubhava. ii. love’s body in the song of songs and the arabic odes The wasf  literary motif  is only one of  many striking characteristics of  The Song of Songs, a text that remains unique and singularly obscure among all other texts of  the Hebrew canon.

The Song of Songs is one of  the most important root texts for Jewish and Christian spirituality. The Shir ha-Shirim, this strange, rich, evocative, late biblical text—its cosmopolitan vocabulary points to post-Exilic, most likely the Hellenistic period in Palestine, around third century BCE—has long drawn to itself  controversy and detailed commentary by Jewish and Christian scholastics, theologians, and mystics.17 It is a sequence of  love poems, at its core a dialogue between a lover, the dark-skinned female Shulammite, and her male Beloved.18 The poem cycle’s origins are obscure and its particular provenance unknown. Reflecting a variety of  languages and traditions—Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, even South Indian (there are several Tamil loanwords in the Song)—the Hebrew text is filled with un- familiar terms, words of  doubtful origin, striking lacunae, and many thorny locutions.19 It does not trace any linear movement in the lover’s union and separation but ends rather abruptly with the Shulammite charging her Beloved to “run away, my love, and be like a gazelle . . . on the 17 For a detailed treatment of  the origins and provenance of  the Song, see the introduc- tion to Ariel Bloch and Chana Bloch, The Song of  Songs: A New Translation (Berkeley: Uni- versity of  California Press, 1998). 18 As Bloch and Bloch note, ha-shulammit is of  uncertain meaning. Medieval Jewish exegetes like Ibn Ezra understood the word as an epithet, “the Jerusalemite [fem.],” derived from shalem, a “poetic term for Jerusalem, and one of  the city’s ancient names.” See ibid., 197–98. 19 I will not attempt here to enter into a discussion of  The Song of Songs and ancient Tamil secular love poetry. Several years ago Chaim Rabin wrote what since has become an often- cited article on the sources of  the Song in the classical Tamil literature of  ancient South India (“The Song of  Songs and Tamil Poetry,” Studies in Religion/Sciences Religieuses 3, no. 3 [1973–74]: 205–19). Basing his thesis on certain striking Tamil loanwords in Hebrew, he pos- tulates that “the Song of  Songs was written in the heyday of  Judean trade with South Arabia and beyond (and this may include the lifetime of  King Solomon) by someone who had himself  traveled to South Arabia and to South India and that had there become acquainted with Tamil poetry” (216). This is a suggestive thesis that relies, particularly in the case of ancient Tamil love poetry, on dating that is highly questionable. The probable dates of  the earliest Tamil texts themselves (ca. 100 BCE–250 CE) are too late to fit Rabin’s theory of South Indian influence, a theory based almost entirely on the exaggerated claims of  Tamil tradition that the poems go back millennia in time, though they more closely match the dates suggested in recent scholarly work on the Song (Hellenistic Palestine around the third century BCE). Compare the study by Abraham Mariaselvam, The Song of Songs and Ancient Tamil Love Poems: Poetry and Symbolism (Roma: Editrice Pontifico Istituto Biblico, 1988), which takes up the comparison in much greater detail than Rabin. Though Mariaselvam brings to his comparative study an encyclopedic knowledge of  the Tamil originals, as well as knowledge of  Hebrew, there is still no evidence put forth as to genetic influence. His findings in Appendix I (279–86), where he recounts in some detail the discussions on the possible de- pendence of  the Song on Ca“kam Tamil poetry, are inconclusive, other than ruling out an a priori negative answer. Obviously, far more work needs to be done on this fascinating topic.

It sits on the page, just as it is, quietly compelling, issuing its disarming challenge to the religious imagination. According to one rabbinic tradition, it is precisely the pshat, the literal meaning of  this love poem that is most esoteric (sod ).21 Its language, in Hebrew, Greek, or Latin, pushes the limits of  phys- icality in its depiction of  human love. “Love” in the Hebrew Song does not embrace only the generalized semantic registers of  aahab,¤  a word that holds a variety of  meanings in the Bible, from “lust” in the story of Amnon and Tamar (2 Sam. 13:4, 15), to the love of  parent, one’s brother, or sister; to love of  spouse; or to love of  “all humankind.” The Song in Hebrew, in the very first line, “Let him kiss me with the kisses of  his mouth, for your loving is sweeter than wine,” praises not aahab,¤  general- ized, universal love, but the plural form dodim (dodeyka¤ , “your dodim”), literally “loving,” “lovemaking,” kisses, caresses, intercourse.22 The text celebrates, in idealized literary pastoral form, the intimate, individual, vulnerable, unstable, physical lovemaking and passionate desire of  two bodies, and this sense of  vivid physicality drives all the commentaries that attempt to show how these love poems speak about love of  God. The text also plays with this rich term, punning with dudaaim, the mandrake, a large-leaved, purple-flowered aphrodisiac with juicy golden fruit. Love of  God and Knesset Israel or the individual Jew is, inescapably, the love of two bodies.23 It is the same in Greek and Latin. Dodim in the Greek Azma (in the Septuagint) is translated, in a most wonderful misprision that reads dadayk for dodayk, mastoi—in the Latin text of  the Canticle it is ubera or mammae—“breasts,” an image that combines in a physical image both fertility and sensual immediacy.24 Gregory of  Nyssa used this imagery of breasts to great sensual effect in his Canticle commentary, associating it 20 For commentary on this last cryptic phrase, see Bloch and Bloch, The Song of Songs, 220–21. 21 See Shmuel Yerushalmi, The Book of  Shir HaShirim: Me’am Lo’ez, trans.

See below. 24 The Septuaginta reads hoti agathoi mastoi sou huper oinon, and the Vulgata reads quia meliora sunt ubera tua vino.

In Gregory’s commentaries on the Song, eros, and not the more generalized agape, best describes love of  God as “infinite in- satiability,” sharp yearning, at once painful and blissful, which leads one on the path to an “eternal progress” (epektasis) in God. At one point in his Canticle commentary, Gregory notes: “For heightened agape is called eros” (epitetamene gar agape eros legetai ).26 Latin commentators like Bernard of  Clairvaux use the word amor, shared by troubadour traditions of  southern France, and sometimes diligende, but rarely caritas, to describe the religious love that lies beneath or behind the lovers’ voices in the Song.27 The Vulgata text itself  uses various terms interchangeably, mostly forms of  caritas and dilectio, though Canticle 2:5, “for I languish with love,” is the vivid quia amore langueo, the single use of  the word amor in the Latin Song.28 Eros and amor, religious eros and amor, stake a claim through the Song as the most appropriate words to describe love of  God.29 25 See Martin Laird, “Fountain of  Presence, Breasts of  Wine: The Flow of  Knowledge in the In Canticum canticorum,” in his Gregory of  Nyssa and the Grasp of Faith (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 131–53. 26 From Oratio 13 (5, 10), 1048C, in Gregorii Nysseni Opera, ed.

The lovers in the Hebrew Song of Songs describe the body of  their beloved from foot to head or head to foot in hyperbole that at times seems to border on the comic and grotesque. The innovative metaphors and similes of  the lovers leap across chasms of  association in what Robert Alter has called a poetics of  “flaunted figuration.”31 Yet in spite of  its strangeness, their language is charged with feeling and presence; it expresses an alluring, 30 Translation adapted from the Jewish Publication Society edition from the Hebrew, Oxford Jewish Study Bible (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004); the Revised English Bible, with Apocrypha (Oxford/Cambridge: Oxford University Press/Cambridge University Press, 1989); and Bloch and Bloch, The Song of Songs. See the detailed philological notes in Bloch and Bloch, 175–77: the translations are all somewhat inaccurate, based as they are upon a combination of  sources, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and the root in each language contains many layers of  meaning. 31 See his chapter on the Song: Robert Alter, “The Garden of  Metaphor,” in his The Art of Biblical Poetry (New York: Basic, 1986), 196. Alter distinguishes in this chapter between stock, intensive, and innovative imagery (the latter strikingly apparent in Job and in the Song). See also page 193: “It should be observed, to begin with, that in the Song of  Songs the process of  figuration is frequently ‘foregrounded’—which is to say, as the poet takes ex- pressive advantage of  representing something through an image that brings out a salient quality it shares with the referent, he calls our attention to his exploitation of  similitude, to the artifice of  metaphorical representation.” </page> <page sequence="14"> 14 Extravagant Beholding even disarming, erotic energy. In chapters 4:1–7 and 6:4–7 of  this text of love songs that Rabbi Akiba in the second century is said to have praised as the “Holy of  Holies,”32 the female beloved’s eyes are doves behind “a thicket of  hair” (sammah: locks, tresses, mass of  hair);33 her hair a flock of  goats streaming down Mount Gilead; her teeth a flock of  newly shorn ewes, “freshly come up from the dipping; all of  them have twins and none has lost a lamb”; her parted lips (or forehead, depending on the translation) behind her veil is like a pomegranate split open; her neck or nose a tower, “David’s tower, which is built with encircling courses, a thousand bucklers hang upon it, and all are warrior’s shields”; her two breasts are like two fawns, “twin fawns of  a gazelle grazing among the lilies.” Here the body of  the beloved becomes, within the scope of  the lover’s gaze, numbingly plural—it disseminates into landscapes, into gardens, orchards, and wilderness at once natural and cultural/pastoral; into shrines, sacred mountains, towers, walls, vineyards, and warrior’s halls—while remaining a singular, individual, discrete other, a beloved (the dark-skinned Shulammite) who finally, and mysteriously, disappears. The poem sequence ends midstream, almost breathless, with a call, a longing, for return: Run away my love and be like the gazelle or the young stag on the mountains of  spices The radical presence evoked in the charged language of  loving descrip- tion is combined in the Song with a sense of  suspension, of  a love (for the time being) lost and (perhaps) just about to be regained. Presence is linked to deferral, what is (always) yet to be. 32 This well-known palinode is from Mishnah Yadaim III:5: “Said Rabbi Akiba: Heaven forbid that any man in Israel ever disputed that the Song of  Songs renders the hands unclean, for the whole world is not worth the day on which the Song of  Songs was given to Israel, for all the Writings are holy, and the Song of  Songs is the Holy of  Holies.” Quoted in Francis Landy, Paradoxes of Paradise: Identity and Difference in the Song of Songs (Sheffield: Almond, 1983), 13. And this identification of  the Song with the sanctuary of  the Temple need not be merely metaphorical, if  we keep in mind the very ancient Jewish tradition, recorded in the Talmud and reiterated by the Kabbalists, of  the Holy of  Holies as a bedroom where the cherubim lay in sexual embrace like a husband and wife. The divine presence (the Shekhinah) was said to dwell between the two cherubim in the Temple as it does now between the pious husband and wife. It is thus no wonder that a love poem would be seen by the tradition as central to its divine mystery.

I quote from Marcia Falk’s fine contemporary translation of  the Song: Dance for us, princess, dance as we watch and chant! What will you see as I move in the dance of love? Your graceful, sandaled feet, your thighs—two spinning jewels, your hips—a bowl of  nectar brimming full Your belly—golden wheat adorned with daffodils, your breasts—two fawns, the twins of  a gazelle Your neck—an ivory tower, your eyes—two silent pools, your face—a tower that overlooks the hills Your head—majestic mountain crowned with purple hair, captivating kings within its locks (7:2–6)34 But these descriptions do not concentrate only on the female body, the male lover’s erotic enjoyment. In 5:10–16 the girl describes her lover from head to foot.

(5:10–16)35 The exact origin of  this descriptive motif  is unclear. It has only been since the last century, when similarities between the Song and pre-sixth- century Arabic poetry were first noticed, that critics and biblical scholars have referred to this genre of  poetic description by the Arabic word wasf. There are analogous, though not as well-developed, limb-by-limb de- scriptions in the earlier secular love poetry of  Egypt. The Egyptian songs, though they come down to us from a time remote from the current scholarly dates of  the Song’s composition (ca. 4–2 BCE), share with the Hebrew cycle of  poems the provenance of  Palestine and perhaps, as Michael V. Fox has argued, the same local literary tradition.36 Even though genetic links are impossible to prove, Fox contends that the Egyptian songs are one, if  not the main, source for the imagery and poetics of  the Hebrew Song.37 Whatever the cogency of  this theory (it is one of  many 35 This passage occurs in poem 19 of  Falk’s edition: Falk, The Song of Songs.

Lovely when she strides on the ground. she has captured my heart in her embrace.39 jewish sources outside the song As for the motif  of  the wasf  in Jewish tradition, it is often said the only examples in all of  ancient Hebrew literature of  this convention are in the Song of Songs. But there is at least, as Shaye J. D. Cohen has argued, one exception to this rule.40 The genre reappeared in Jewish literature as early as the Genesis Apocryphon, one of  the manuscripts of  the Dead Sea Scrolls generic context lacking in extent Hebrew literature. . . . In my opinion the similarities justify a hypothesis of  at least indirect dependence, that is to say, the supposition that the Song is a late offshoot of  an ancient and continuous literary tradition, one whose roots we find, in part at least, in the Egyptian love poetry. I do not assume that the author of  the Song necessarily knew Egyptian or borrowed directly from Egyptian originals (though that is by no means im- possible). It is more likely that Egyptian love poetry was sung in Palestine, where it became incorporated into the local literature and developed there in new ways” (ibid., xxii, xxiv). 38 Along with the theories of  Egyptian and South Indian origins, as well as the theories that the Song is made up of  a collection of  ancient Near Eastern wedding songs or fragments of  the liturgy of  a fertility cult, one of  the more suggestive recent accounts is by Marvin H. Pope in his edition of  the Song for the Anchor Bible—The Song of Songs: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary, Anchor Bible, vol. 7C (New York: Doubleday, 1977). Pope’s theory is that the Song is connected in some way to mortuary cults or funeral feasts of the ancient Near East that, according to some scholars, were ritually organized feasts of  love. 39 From the P. Chester Beatty I papyrus, group A, no. 31, translated in Fox, The Song of Songs and the Ancient Egyptian Love Songs, 52. 40 See Shaye J. D.

The author of  the Apocryphon adds to the Genesis 12:10–20 account of  Abram and Sarai among the Egyptians: his praise of  Sarai includes a sequential head- to-foot description of  her beauty.41 But in this case his model, as Cohen argues, is not the Song, but one of  the epigrams of  his contemporary Philodemus, a Syrian of  Gadara who around 70 BCE went to Italy to embark on a literary career and who was one of  the first to incorporate this literary device into the love poetry of  the West. The Jewish writer, who, like Philodemus, flourished in a Hellenized environment, followed the pattern of  the Syrian poet in blending descriptions of  bodily beauty with a particularly Hellenistic emphasis on feminine wisdom, intelligence, and skill (an aspect absent from the Song).42 As Cohen suggests, “Each independently Hellenized the Near Eastern descriptive song.”43 a presentational poetics With the genealogy of  the genre and its many variations in mind, how might we interpret awsaf  in the Song? What does this form of  love lan- guage in the Song tell us about our theme of  particular and ideal bodies? The literal meanings of  awsaf  simply provoke smiles—we are forced to muse on the radically different notions of  beauty held by an ancient people. We certainly cannot impose a self-conscious surrealist poetic of aesthetic shock on this ancient material. Perhaps we might take a more academic approach, viewing the awsaf  not as descriptive love songs but as parodies or, more soberly, as learned allusions to sculptural or archi- tectural forms. There may indeed be a cultic element in such sequential descriptions, particularly of  the male body, where we read allusions to 41 The text describing Sarai “more or less from the head to the feet” (ibid., 46) is put into the mouth of  the courtier Hirquanos, whose description is decidedly more chaste in imagery and diction than the one of  the author of  the Song: “How splen[did] and beautiful the form of her face, and how . . . and how soft the hair of  her head; how lovely are her eyes and how pleasant is her nose and all the radiance of  her face . . . ; how lovely is her breast and how beautiful is all her whiteness! Her arms, how beautiful! And her hands, how perfect! And (how) [attrac]tive all the appearance of  her hands! How lovely [are] her palms, and how long and dainty all the fingers of  her hands. Her feet, how beautiful! How perfect her legs! There are no virgins or brides who enter a bridal chamber more beautiful than she. Indeed, her beauty surpasses that of  all women: her beauty is high above all of  them. Yet with all this beauty there is much wisdom in her; and whatever she has.” Translated in Cohen, “The Beauty of  Flora,” 45–46. 42 Philodemus’s witty epigram is, like the praise of  Hirquanos in the Apocryphon, more apostrophic than lyrical, as it is built upon a series of  vocatives to the beloved’s feet, legs, thighs, buttocks, sex (kteis), hips, shoulders, breasts, neck, etc. This lack of  metaphoric texture also sets it apart from the densely figurative style of  the Song. 43 Cohen, “The Beauty of  Flora,” 48. Among the possible influences on Philodemus other than the ancient Near Eastern song, one of  the more fruitful seems to be the genre of  ekphrasis (‘description’), defined, as Cohen observes, by the ancient rhetoricians as an “elaborate and embellished description of  a person or an object, usually of  a work of  art” (ibid., 43). </page> <page sequence="19"> History of Religions 19 ivory and marble.44 As Richard N. Soulen has observed, such a realist approach to this poetic of  description, whether it be to point to its grotes- queries as an example of  carnival or even to analyze it in terms of  ancient Egyptian iconography, rather misses the point.45 The latter is a perfect ex- ample of  what Alter calls “misplaced concreteness.”46 It is obvious from any detailed reading of  these passages that neither a cultic nor a purely artistic context would entirely explain the exuberant, exaggerated similes and metaphors of  the awsaf. The purpose of  the wasf  in the Song, Soulen suggests, is “presenta- tional rather than representational.” “Its purpose,” Soulen observes, “is not to provide a parallel to visual appearance” or “primarily to describe feminine or masculine qualities metaphorically.”47 Rather, the images want to evoke feeling; they “seek to create emotion, not critical or dispassionate comprehension; their goal is a total response, not simply a cognitive one.”48 The lovers’ metaphorical hyperbole is, in Soulen’s words, “the language of  joy” that seeks to “overwhelm and delight the hearer.”49 We are in- vited, even greatly coerced, to share a lover’s awe, joy, and erotic delight in the physical beauty of  the beloved and, beyond, in his or her qualities and virtues that create a rich imagistic world of  their own, sometimes dissolving the original focus of  gazing. As a physical response to the flood of  beauty that enters the eyes, the lovers of  the Song delight in recreating each other’s bodies through verbal art. The visual exaggerations of  the wasf  are related to other rhetorical extravagances of  the text, which include tactile images of  entering, eating, tasting, and feasting on the beloved and the olfactory eroticism of  flowers, 44 See Bloch and Bloch, The Song of Songs, 185. 45 See Richard Soulen’s article “The Wasfs of  the Song of  Songs and Hermeneutic,” Journal of Biblical Literature 86, pt. 2 (June 1967): 183–90. Soulen refers, on 185–87, to M. H. Segal’s theory of  literary parody, Morris Jastrow Jr.’s notion of  difference in aesthetic taste, and Gillis Gerleman’s obsession with Egyptian art and ornamental figures in the awsaf. See also Fox’s exegesis of  the awsaf  in The Song of Songs and the Ancient Egyptian Love Songs, 140–65, which basically follows Gerleman and Pope—though with some important misgivings—in its emphasis on the tropes’ origin in works of  art, artifacts, icons, and sculp- ture. For a sense of  his ambivalence on this, however, see the following remark: “Some of the imagery in this section [5:10–16] is drawn from the arts: the head of  gold, the arms like cylinders of  gold, thighs like marble pillars on gold sockets, the belly like an ivory bar. Only the gold head is taken from sculpture, so we cannot suppose that the boy is being described as if  he were a statue (contrary to Gerleman)” (Fox, The Song of Songs and the Ancient Egyptian Love Songs, 147). 46 Alter, The Art of Biblical Poetry, 196. 47 Soulen, “The Wasfs of  the Song of  Songs,” 187. 48 Ibid., 188.

And the Song not only engages the senses one at a time but also often mingles them in a vivid synesthesia, as in one of  its first images, where the beloved’s name is said to be a “spreading perfume.” Through such synesthesia and extravagance of  rhetoric the awsaf  of The Song of Songs create a charged field of  metaphoric energies between the particular other lover, her concrete presence for the lover who gazes at her (and recreates her, over and again, by that gazing), and a dissembling semantic overflow that blurs boundaries, that defers final possession of the other person but also draws out a certain erotic relish. Built into the structure of  these elaborate descriptions is an affirmation both of  physical possession, intimate delectation, and (immanent) loss, an endless oscil- lation between seeming arrival and separation, the beloved’s discrete presence and at the same time her boundlessness, her infinity of  forms. We have here, in literary form, to return to Sappho’s phrase, eros bliss- fully, even insatiably, “nonarriving,” the soul growing wings watered by streams of  beauty that enter through the eyes in Socrates’ Phaedrus speech, verbal horripilation, affirming what Gregory of  Nyssa called in his Song commentaries “eternal progress” (epektasis). Such “nonarrival,” however, never overly darkens the overarching sunny aspect of  this cycle of  love poems. The main register of  the Song is joy and joyous anticipation, in spite of  eros’s willed deferral. Though the Song itself  seems to end with separation, a call and an absence, its rhetoric, deeply informed by the images of  the wasf, is about an inevitable and re- liable presence that overwhelms and delights and that multiplies delight. Deferral here is jouissance. The “who” and the “what” of  love are held in elegant tension here, a tension that excites, withholds, releases, with- draws, but ultimately pleases. Here is language that raises the hairs at the back of  the neck, that transforms ache and tingle into metaphor, simile, a network of  symbols “thrown across” two bodies in love.50 This is not, however, always the case with the wasf  and its rhetorical roles in a poem. With this in mind, we turn now to the very different context of  the Arabic odes. the waSf in arabic qaSIdah: memory of what is lost—extravagant  description and absence As we have already noted, wasf, used by critics to refer to a motif  in The Song of Songs, is an Arabic term that literally means “description,” a poetic passage that describes in sequence, and by means of  a series of  exagger- 50 For a discussion of  the nature of  the symbol as something that both unites and separates, putting into tension together sameness and difference in a way that matches similar tensions in the life of  eros, see Carson, Eros the Bittersweet, 70–76, 109–10. </page> <page sequence="21"> History of Religions 21 ated, sometimes artificial images, the parts of  the human body.51 The term wasf  refers most specifically to a poetic form used by poets in the early pre-Islamic Arabic odes (pre-622 CE). Michael Sells has studied the poetry and poetics of  the Arabic odes and their later religious transformations in the Sufi poetry of  Ibn oArabi and has come to a conclusion about the uses of  the wasf  that differs from what we see in the Song. The balance, however precarious, between the “who” and the “what” does not seem to be present at all. In the Arabic and later the Islamic mystical context, the awsaf  and their semantic ex- travagances serve to evoke not only an elusive erotic/divine presence but also, and perhaps most important, absence.52 The rich dissembling similes, imagery, and metaphors serve to evoke increasing distance and a contin- uous metamorphosis, finally, memory of  what is lost: the beloved as a concrete individual presence evaporates in the dissembling semantic over- flows of  the wasf. I quote a section of  Sells’s translation from a poem of Ghaylan Ibn oUqba, also called Dhu al-Rumma, one of  the finest poets of  the late classical period, where the narrator is in search of  the elusive Beloved, Mayya: Her buttocks like a dune over which a rain shower falls matting the sand as it sprinkles down Her hair-fall over the lower curve of  her back soft as the moringa’s gossamer flowers, curled with pins and combed, With long cheek hollows where tears flow, and a lengthened curve at the breast sash where it crosses and falls. You see her ear pendant along the exposed ridge of  her neck, swaying out, dangling over the abyss. 51 See the section on awsaf  in Falk, The Song of Songs, 217–35. 52 Michael Sells draws attention to the “dissembling similes” and “semantic overflow” of the wasf  in the classic pre-Islamic Arabic odes and in later Sufi poetry. Such “semantic over- flow” is part and parcel of  head-to-foot descriptions of  the alluring female beloved, the ghul, in this pre–seventh-century literature. See his “Guises of  the Ghul.” See also, for translations of  such poetry, Michael Sells, Desert Tracings: Six Classic Arabian Odes by oAlqama, Shanfara, Labid, oAntara, Al-A osha, and Dhu al-Rumna (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan Uni- versity Press, 1989), esp. the poem “To the Encampments of  Mayya,” 67–76. </page> <page sequence="22"> 22 Extravagant Beholding With a red thornberry tooth-twig, Fragrant as musk and Indian ambergris brought in in the morning, she reveals Petals of  a camomile cooled by the night to which the dew has arisen at evening from Rama oasis.53 Sells comments on this section: In passages like that cited above, the beloved is evoked so powerfully that the reader or hearer is convinced that she has been described. But in fact the similes, so vivid in their imagery, tell us very little about the factual appearance of  the beloved. They seem to be depicting the beloved, but in fact what they actually show (camomile blossoms, moringa trees, lush vegetation, flowing water, and in other examples, wild animals giving birth or nursing in tranquility) is the sym- bolic analogue of  the beloved: a lost garden. What occurs here is less a descrip- tion of  Mayya than it is a metamorphosis.54 The poet’s name, the epithet Dhu al-Rumma, literally means “he-with- a-cord-of-a-rope,” and, as Sells in another context remarks, this nickname is an inversion of  one of  the beloved’s epithets, dhatu alwanin, “she- with-many-guises.” We have here “the poet-hero attempting to bind the many-guised and constantly changing into a stable and secure world.”55 And it is this immense, boundless, ever-shape-shifting beloved that finds her way into the religious lyrics of  one of  the greatest Sufi mystical poets of  medieval Islam, Ibn al-oArabi (1165–1240). ibn al-oarabI’s religious transformations of the arabic qaSIdah Such a literary evocation of  absence and “memory of  an irretrievable past” through sequential description is translated by the Sufi poet Ibn oArabi into a very complex theological discourse about love and the beloved. This discourse affirms the experience of  concrete presence (now past) and the individual identity of  the beloved, even as it turns apophatic, drama- tizing the ultimate inability of  religious language to finally and fully seize its referent, the beloved as the divine in the form of  the Eternal Feminine.

Long evenings spent with these two great sheikhs were filled with the most marvelous conversations and the most remarkable people, but the most compelling of  persons Ibn oArabi met at that learned home was Nizam, “a figure of  pure light.”59 Concrete ref- erences to this “historical” Nizam are spread throughout the lyric love odes (nasib-ghazals), Ibn oArabi’s transformation of  the traditional qasidah of the Tarjuman. In one passage, mention of  this “princess from the land of  Persia” oc- curs after a litany of  longing lovers, including Mayya and Ghaylan of  the classical Arabic qasidah. . . . and stop a while with me at the ruins, so we may try to weep, no, so that I can weep at what has become of  me.

The second recension takes out the references to the “human” Nizam and includes an autocommentary that emphasizes the esoteric, transcendental/theological meanings of  the poems. The third recension is identical to the second, though it contains extra passages that depict the circumstances surround- ing the writing of  the commentary.64 In his later prologues and allegorical/ theological/mystical autocommentaries on these love lyrics, Ibn oArabi disabuses the reader of  any idea that there is some kind of  physical love in these erotic poems or that their original object was ever merely the physical, particular “Nizam.” Indeed, he comments, their subject is “Nizam” (i.e., Beauty, Artful Arrangement, Perfected Harmony, Fluency, from the Arabic root n/z /m), the Eternal Feminine, the very “Eye of  the Sun and of  Beauty” (oayn al-Shams waal-Bahaa), and not a merely human girl. These poems, he says in his commentary, “allude enigmatically to the various kinds of  mystical knowledge which are under the veil of  an-Nizam, the maiden daughter of  our Shaykh.”65 This “slender girl” is the “single, subtle, and essential knowledge of  God,”66 as a “daughter of  Persia,” she is, allegorically, a “form of  foreign wisdom connected with Moses, Jesus, Abraham, and other foreigners of  the same class.”67 He was responding, in these commentaries, to criticisms of  fellow sheikhs, particularly, as Henry Corbin remarks, “those of  a certain learned moralist of  Aleppo,” 63 Adapted from Tarjuman XLII:4–5, in ibid., 127.

I quote sections from the original prologue of  the Tarjuman, translated in Corbin’s seminal study of  Ibn oArabi, L’imagination creatrice: Now this shaikh had a daughter, a lissome young girl who captivated the gaze of  all who saw her, whose mere presence was the ornament of  our gatherings and startled all those who contemplated it to the point of  stupefaction. Her name was Nizam [Harmonica] and her surname “Eye of  the Sun and of  Beauty” [oayn al-Shams waal-Bahaa]. . . . The magic of  her glance, the grace of  her conversa- tion were such an enchantment that when, on occasion, she was prolix, her words flowed from the source; when she spoke concisely, she was a marvel of  elo- quence; when she expounded an argument, she was clear and transparent. . . . If  not for the paltry souls who are ever ready for scandal and predisposed to malice, I should comment here on the beauties of  her body as well as her soul, which was a garden of  generosity. . . . At the time I frequented her, I observed with care the noble endowments that graced her person and those additional charms conferred by the society of  her aunt and father. And I took her as model for the inspiration of  the poems con- tained in the present book, which are love poems, composed in suave, elegant phrases, although I was unable to express so much as part of  the emotion which my soul experienced and which the company of  this young girl awakened in my heart, or of  the generous love I felt, of  the memory which her unwavering friendship left in my memory, or of  the grace of  her mind or the modesty of  her bearing, since she is the object of  my Quest and my hope, the Virgin Most Pure [al-Adhraa al-batul ]. Nevertheless, I succeeded in putting into verse some of the thoughts connected with my yearning, as precious gifts and objects which I here offer. I let my enamored soul speak clearly, I tried to express the profound attachment I felt, the profound concern that tormented me in those days now past, the regret that still moves me at the memory of  that noble society and that young girl.69 68 See Corbin, Creative Imagination, 138, also 321–22.

Whatever the house whose elegy I sing, it is of  her house that I am thinking. But that is not all. In the verses I have composed for the present book, I never cease to allude to the divine inspirations (waridat ilahiya), the spiritual visitations (tanazzulat ruhaniya), the correspondences [of  our world] with the world of  the angelic Intelligences; in this I conformed to my usual manner of  thinking in symbols; this because the things of  the invisible world attract me more than those of  actual life, and because this young girl knew perfectly what I was alluding to [that is, the esoteric sense of  my verses].71 The awsaf  in Ibn oArabi’s nasib-ghazals, to use the still-crucial in- sights of  Corbin, transfigure the earthly figure of  the woman by setting her against a light that brings out her “superhuman virtualities” and so anticipates something that is “still absent” in its totality, the full divine presence which is “not yet,” though it shimmers in metaphors and similes inspired by the memory of  the particular Beloved body.72 The wasf  here, as an act of  loving beholding, is a “transmutation of  the sensible,”73 the “descent of  the divine and an assumption of  the sensible,”74 what Ibn oArabi, in another context refers to, in Corbin’s translation, as a “conde- scendence” (munazala).75 We descend the stairs as Socrates did in his “recantation” speech on love, ideals, and particularity in the Phaedrus. This is hardly negative theology in a pure sense (if  such a thing ever exists), but rather it joins a certain via negativa, a vivid sense of  an endless yearning and infinite search for the Beloved akin to Gregory of 70 See the last chapter of  the Fusus on Muhammad and Ibn oArabi’s discussion of  women, perfume, and prayer.

I meet him, but am not cured: it’s just desire, whether I am absent or present. When we meet, something in me stirs that I could hardly imagine: the cure’s a second disease of  passion because I behold a form whose beauty, as often as we meet, grows in splendor and majesty: there is no escape from passion that grows, on a predestined scale, with every growth in loveliness.77 Guises of  loveliness beguile. One is so close, then far, then, in much of our literature, one discovers that the shape-shifting beloved has, all the time, dwelt in the heart, deep within, or in the gut, the innards, though it still sends out its bewildering array of  images, odors, and sensations: I am mad with love for Salma who dwells at Ajyad. 76 See Ibn oArabi’s Futuhat [Meccan revelations] II:327: “It is certain that the beloved object is something that does not yet exist and that the love of  an already existing object is in no wise possible. The only possibility is the attachment of  the lover for a real being in whom there comes to be manifested the realization of  the beloved object that does not yet exist.” Compare II:334: “Many sophisms occur in connection with love. The first of  all is one we have already mentioned: lovers imagine that the beloved object is a real thing, whereas it is a still unreal thing. The aspiration of  love is to see this thing realized in a real person, and when love sees it realized, it then aspires to the perpetuation of  this state, whose realization in the real person it has previously awaited. Thus the real beloved never ceases to be unreal [i.e., always transcendent], although most lovers are unaware of  this, unless they have been initiated into the true science of  love and its objects.” Quoted in Corbin, Creative Imagina- tion, 334–35. 77 Adapted from Tarjuman LV, in Nicholson, The Tarjuman al-ashwaq, 141–42. </page> <page sequence="31"> History of Religions 31 No, I am wrong. She lives in the black clot of  blood in the membrane of  my liver. Beauty is bewildered by her: odors of  musk and saffron drift away on the air.78 love language of excess: the who and the what in the body Thus we have in Ibn oArabi’s limb-by-limb descriptions a distinctive coupling of  the particular and the general, with an emphasis on absence and lack. The wasf  here bewilders, confuses, confounds particularity; it loses at times the singular other in guises and disguises. Love here is, indeed, divided, and it “divides the heart,” to return to the phrase used by Derrida. But it is not only this. In a way certainly different from The Song of Songs, and less apparent, the wasf  in Ibn oArabi also holds in its semantic registers the sense of  the singular beloved, even if  in a purely proleptic sense of  something that is yet to (fully) be. “She,” as feminine, like the Prophet Muhammad, is the very cipher of  particularity, and that fact haunts these image-rich poems of  longing. As we have seen, in spite of  the ex- cessive semantic overflow or surplus of  extravagant metaphoric energies used to describe the beautiful body of  the beloved, the concrete particular person never entirely evaporates or is wholly concealed, at least in the context of  the Tarjuman as a whole. Though the ancient Arabic qasidah may emphasize absence and the memory of  what is lost, its elaborate awsaf  a systematic dissembling and not a literary act of  presencing, we have also seen that the qasidah in the hands of  a religious poet like Ibn oArabi combines visionary idealization—divine otherness and the “not yet”—with a sense of  a “real” object of  desire, the “assumption of  the sensible”—the lovely scholar-girl in a household of  scholars in Mecca who was also Wisdom, Harmony, and, finally, perhaps most strangely, Divine Love in the gut. We move now to an analogous motif  in a religious poet and a religious tradition of  medieval South India. This motif  in the Sanskrit poetry of South Indian saint-poet Ve“kate¶a combines in a unique way many of  the 78 Adapted from Tarjuman LXI:7–9, in ibid., 148. </page> <page sequence="32"> 32 Extravagant Beholding semantic and syntactic registers, the willed ambiguities, of  the wasf  in its praises of  a protean, “many-guised,” boundless, though also (yet some- times only potentially) powerfully present divine beloved. But there are also important differences. These Hindu verses house the most theologi- cally self-conscious and elaborated form of  extravagant description we have yet looked at, and so, in their systematic joining of  the “who” and the “what,” the least ambiguous and most confident vision of  the unity of particular and ideal forms of  love. iii. anubhava: enjoying the body of god in south asian  literature There are interesting analogues to the wasf  in one of  the most widespread, though little-studied, descriptive devices in South Asian literatures, the sequential description of  a god or goddess, a hero or heroine, from foot to head or head to foot (padadike¶ah, apadacudanubhavam, or nakha-¶ikha, literally “toenail-to-topknot” for the Hindu god Krishna). As with the awsaf, the actual origin of  such limb-by-limb descriptions is far from clear. One obvious textual and perhaps cultic source—alluded to by some poets—may well be the Vedic Purusa sukta (Rg Veda X:90), though some of  the earliest literary examples come from Pali descriptions of  the body of  the Buddha in the Lakkhanasuttana of  the Digha Nikaya (ca. third century BCE), inspired in part by ancient conventional accounts of  the thirty-two auspicious marks of  the “great” person (mahapurusa). By the third century CE, in the Buddhist stotras or “hymns” of  Matrceta, we have fully developed examples of  the adaptation of  this form of sequential description to the body of  the Buddha.79 By the seventh cen- tury, the Chinese pilgrim I-tsing attests to the fact that two of  Matrceta’s stotras, the Catuh¶ataka stotra and the ‡atapañca¶atika stotra, were widely chanted throughout “India.”80 In the Pali Therigatha (lyrics with commentaries and attached bio- graphical narratives collected in fifth-century Kañcipuram), such descrip- tions are used ironically to satirize a love poet’s erotic descriptions of  a human female beloved. The verses of  Bhikkhuni Ambapali, a self-portrait of  the nun-heroine from head to foot, are a parody of  the erotic love tra- dition. They juxtapose conventional images of  the young girl’s hair “glossy 79 For a discussion of  Matrceta’s stotras, see Anthony Kennedy Warder’s Indian Kavya Literature, vol. 2, Origins and Formation of the Classical Kavya (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1974), 228–30, 230. And this Buddhist notion of  the “great man” (mahapurusa) obviously has its roots both in the royal notion of  the cakravartin and in the ancient Vedic tradition of the “cosmic person” from whose sacrificed body the cosmos and the social order was created. See Rg Veda X:90 (esp. verses 12–14) for a sequential description of  the mahapurusa. 80 This reference is taken from Nancy Nayar’s study of  the poetry of  the early Acayras: Poetry as Theology, 39. </page> <page sequence="33"> History of Religions 33 and black as the down of  a bee,” “a casket of  perfumes,” her teeth “like the opening buds of  the plantain,” her throat of  “mother-of-pearl,” and her arms “shining like twin pillars” with the old woman’s body, “wrinkled and wasted” with years. The language of  love is turned on its head and used in the service of  a meditation on impermanence.81 Here extravagant sequential description is used precisely against particularity, in a way different from the dissembling motifs of  the Arabic qasidah, and in the service of  a transpersonal, general ideal of  self  and body.82 The irony is even more savage in the verses attributed to Bhikkhuni Subha of  the Mango Grove, where the young male lover’s hyperbolic praise of  the beautiful nun’s eyes—compared to “gazelles,” “enshrined” in her face as in the “calyx of  the lotus”—is answered by the nun tearing out her eye in contempt and handing it to the young man.83 “Here then,” she says in disgust, “take your eye!” (handa te cakkhum harassu).84 Other early examples of  this form directed not to human lovers, nuns, or holy men but to actual temple icons include Bana’s Candi ‡ataka (ca. seventh century CE), which contains a detailed foot-to-head descrip- tion of  the loveliness of  the goddess Candi’s body, with a distinctive focus on the toenails, and a work Winternitz claims as contemporary with Bana, Muka’s Pañca ‡asti, a praise in five hundred verses of  the charming form of  the goddess Kamaksi of  Kañcipuram. Also by the seventh century there are analogous Buddhist and Jain Sanskrit stotras that describe in elaborate detail the bodies of  Buddhas or of  the Jinas.85 In later centuries, limb-by-limb descriptions become widespread in pan-Indian cosmopolitan Sanskrit literature (kavya), as well as in various 81 For Ambapali’s verses see Therigatha 252–70 (in Oldenberg and Pischel’s Pali Text Society edition, The Thera- and Theri-gatha [London, 1883], 147–50).

The important thirteenth-century Sinhala maha- kavya, the Kavsilumina, contains, for instance, an elaborate foot-to-head description of  the beauty of  Queen Prabhavati, the wife of  the Buddha in his birth as King Kusa.86 The Pujavaliya, another thirteenth-century Sinhala kavya, contains long passages describing, limb by limb, the beautiful bodies of  women, along with an emotionally charged descrip- tion of  the beautiful body of  the Buddha as seen by his lovesick wife Ya¶odhara upon his return to his father’s palace.87 Such Buddhist Sinhala texts, the exquisite products of  a second wave of  vernacularzation in Sri Lanka after the twelfth century, are imbued with a rich atmosphere of  re- ligious emotion that is deeply indebted to the aesthetic models of  Sanskrit erotics. Such descriptions also play an important role in Agamic and tantric ritual texts such as the Pañcaratra, where they form the basis of  visual- izations of  a deity from foot to head. They also form part of  iconometric texts for ¶ilpins (icon makers) shared by Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains from a very early period. According to South Asian art historian Gustav Roth, the iconometric lists drafted by craftsmen in texts such as the sixth- century Citralaksana begin from the top point of  the head and proceed down to the foot, while early Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain religious texts, miming the attitude of  the worshipper, move from foot to head.88 Sanskrit kavya poets from the earliest periods marshal a considerable store of  rhetorical figures (alamkaras), such as metaphor (rupaka or dipaka), simile (upama), “fancy” (utpreksa), and alliteration (anuprasa), 86 The mahakavya is based on a Jataka tale (no. 531), as its original title of  Kusadavata indicates.

For centuries Indian critics have focused their considerable critical and analytical faculties on the detailed analysis of  such figurative language in poetry, prose, and the drama and its classification into types. In such poetry—according to one of  the early theorists of  Indian poetics, Bhamaha (ca. fourth–fifth or seventh centuries CE—his dates are uncertain)—hyperbole or “exaggeration” (ati¶ayokti ) is quite acceptable, even inevitable, given a suitable poetic “pretext” (nimitta); it would not, strictly speaking, be seen as “flaunted” at all but, rather, appropriate to the aesthetic enjoyment of  the erotic. Moreover, again according to Bhamaha, elaborate figuration (vakrokti ) is one of  the defining characteristics of  ornamentation in poetry.89 loving description and the devotional eye From the eighth through the fourteenth centuries in South India, the trope of  exaggerated sequential description is used in distinctive ways first by Tamil saint-poets (Aãvars), and later by ‡rivaisnava Acaryas composing in Sanskrit and Tamil, to describe the male bodies of  temple images (vigraha, murti, meçi): the various standing, seated, and reclining images of  the god Vishnu in a growing network of  shrines that dot the landscape of  Tamil Nadu. I have already noted that ‡rivaisnava commentators call such foot-to-head or head-to-foot descriptions anubhavas: “experiences” or “enjoyments” of  the body of  the god. Sanskrit and Tamil anubhavas in ‡rivaisnava literature are visionary pictures of  the deity meant as a tool for systematic tantric-style visualizations (dhyanani ) but, as devotional visions, also as inspirers of  emotion, an atmosphere of  “divine passion,” a direct experience of  amorous feeling through a refined erotic language inherited from Sanskrit kavya. Like the awsaf  of  the Song, the ‡rivaisnava anubhava is a language of overflowing joy and one of  the most potent vehicles of  love language in the literature. In the rush of  images, the concrete object of  contemplation, the temple icon, expands before one’s eyes. Like the awsaf  of  Ibn oArabi and the early Arabic odes, the poets’ similes, metaphors, and double en- tendres serve at times to dissolve the original object of  gazing—a jeweled belt, a toe, a thigh, earrings, crown or navel; this, along with mythic and cultic associations from Puranic or Pañcaratra liturgical texts, natural imagery of  earth, atmosphere, and the planets, creates a complex com- posite image of  a vigorously protean god, where the starting point of 89 For a detailed account of  the history of  Indian poetics, see A.

They represent perhaps the most elegant bal- ancing act between the “who” and the “what” of  love that we have yet encountered. Unlike in the Arabic odes, there is no imagery of  absence or the apophatic here. The saint-poet’s experience—to use a phrase of Richard Davis, his “devotional eye”—is shaped by sanctum icons, by their individual liturgical service and ritual honor (puja), always physically, materially present in the shrine.91 Even when Vishnu is seen to change form, to move about like a living being, or to be played with like a doll (as in the charming narrative of  the Muslim princess who fell in love with the plundered temple image of  Ra“ganatha), the poets often simply oscillate in imaginative vision between the immobile standing or reclining stone mulabera and the bronze festival images (utsava murtis) that stand before them in the “literal” space of  the temple sanctum or as booty in the palace storerooms of  a Delhi Sultan.92 Vishnu in this southern Tamil and Sanskrit poetry is the god who once stood/dwelt “here” and still is “standing/dwelling” (the verb nil—to dwell, abide, stand—as past participle and in the gerundive is used with elastic energy in the Tamil verses). This beloved god “abides” in the temple and its environs but most vividly “stands/abides” there right in front of  the adoring poet, even while he has, simultaneously, become all things. The “what” of  this beloved is impossibly immense, beyond metaphor, though the “who” remains present in spite of  the full theanthropocosmic form. To the late poet and scholar A. K. Ramanujan the paradigmatic verse that describes this experience, drawing together in dynamic tension the uni- versal and particular object of  desire, appears in the work of  Nammaãvar, one of  the earliest and most treasured of  Tamil saint-poets. Nammaãvar’s stanza reads almost like a grammatical paradigm, as Ramanujan notes, “a breathless recital of  Tamil pronouns.” In his concise translation: 90 For The Song of Songs, see Soulen, “The Wasfs of  the Song of Songs,” 188. See also Sells, “The Guises of  the Ghul.” Sells, as we have seen, argues that the language of  the Arabic odes expresses a “language of  unsaying,” that it has an apophatic or negative sense (i.e., the Beloved disappears in the dissembling of  semantic overflow). 91 See Richard Davis, Lives of Indian Images (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997), 1. 92 For versions of  the story of  the icon of  Vishnu as Ra“ganatha and the Muslim princess, see Davis, Lives of Indian Images, 132–35.

That god who performed so many exploits in so many remote ages, who took on so many different forms, who is, simultaneously, so many very different things, the “many- guised”: he is also, perhaps above all, out of  individual love, here, in the shrine, before the loving gaze of  the saint-poet. This telescoping pattern is vividly expressed in one of  Ve“kate¶a’s Sanskrit poems that describe the icon-body of  Vishnu at ‡rira“gam in sensuous, erotically charged detail, from foot to head. Ve“kate¶a’s San- skrit poem was modeled on an early Tamil poem by Tiruppanaãvar, which also described this same form of  Vishnu from foot to head but without some of  the extraordinary splendor of  the Sanskrit saint-poet’s images. Verses from that poem read like this: O Lord of  Ra“ga! I see the exquisite curves of  your calves, the lustre of  anklets 93 See A. K. Ramanujan, Hymns for the Drowning: Poems for Visnu by Nammaãvar (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1981), 122–23. </page> <page sequence="38"> 38 Extravagant Beholding bathes them in color; swift runners between armies in time of  war, long ladles to catch the liquid light of  your beauty— their loveliness doubled by the shade of  your knees: seeing them, my soul stops running the paths of  rebirth.

And after this dizzying itinerary of  imagistic description that integrates specific attributes and iconographic details of  the cult images with mythic exploits that go backward in time and an anthropomorphism that evokes the presence of  a living, animated person, a penultimate verse places the reader back into the central temporal and special context of  the praise poem, the temple sanctum itself  and the temple icons of  a particular god of  a particular place that are the immediate focus of  the poet’s gaze, and ultimately into the very body—into the gut, as Ibn oArabi would say of his beloved—of  the poet himself: The noble beauty of  his arms; his body scarred by a warrior’s bowstrings and women’s bangles— his chest belongs to Laksmi, goddess of  luck. And the thick club studded with iron: his weapons show his fearlessness. He is here, asleep on the coiled serpent, where, just in front of  himself, his very own self, his image, shines. Here, in the middle of  ‡rira“gam town, a king with his three queens— here, in the middle of  my heart! These verses are from the Bhagavaddhyanasopanam (The ladder of meditation on the body of  Bhagavan) and describe what for the twentieth- century Sanskrit commentator Ve“katagopaladasa is an experience (anubhava) of  an “astonishing otherworldly beauty” (alaukikadbhuta- saundaryam) and of  “sweet deep inner delight”; it represents a “contin- uous burning desire” (nirantaraotkatakama), a “ladder of  love that has as </page> <page sequence="41"> History of Religions 41 its sole object the Lord” (etadapi bhagavavisayakamasya sopanameva).95 This same commentator cites as the source for such sensual relish of  the divine body a passage from one of  the finest works of  Sanskrit kavya, the limb-by-limb description of  young Parvati in Kalidasa’s Kumarasambhava (1:32–49). The slow journey up the body of  god is compared by Ve“ka- te¶a’s commentator to the erotic relish of  the young girl and future consort of  ‡iva: At her waist like an altar, curving and slender, there were three gentle folds of  the skin, as if  a woman in her youth could freshly grow steps for the God of  Love to climb.96 Ve“kate¶a, the religious poet, like Kalidasa before him, uses in a cre- ative way motifs from secular erotic literature to express emotions proper to love of  a deity. Here bhakti, religious love, is continuous with kama, so-called “secular” erotic love—the Sanskrit cousin of  eros—and concrete human emotions and literary conventions of  erotic love are harnessed for religious purposes, with the anubhava as one of  their most effective lit- erary vehicles. There are anubhavas in every major poem by Ve“kate¶a that praise a specific particularized icon of  Vishnu, and in each case these stepwise descriptions form the core of  the long hymn of  praise: a head-to-foot or foot-to-head delectation for the eyes, an extravagant beholding of  the beautiful body of  the god.97 the who and the what in “cosmotheandric” unity I will conclude this section with selected verses from one of  Ve“kate¶a’s Sanskrit anubhavas to Vishnu, this time in his form as Devanayaka Swami at Tiruvahindrapuram. This particular form of  Vishnu calls forth some of the poet’s most passionate and seemingly personal poetry, in all three of his working languages, Sanskrit, Tamil, and Maharastri Prakrit. The verses express vividly and memorably the language of  excess that is the mark of the wasf  in its most general sense. 95 Verses are from Bhagavaddhyanasopanam 3–6, 9–11.

See also discussion in Hopkins, Singing the Body of God, 161–63. 97 Though traditionally foot-to-head description is reserved for divinities, and head-to- foot for the human beloved, Ve“kate¶a and the other poets in this tradition use both directions for Vishnu. Though the exact reasons for this are not clear, some scholars and ‡rivaisnava commentators claim that in the head-to-foot descriptions the saint-poet assumes intimacy, a spontaneous familiarity with the divine beloved, as if  he were human. </page> <page sequence="42"> 42 Extravagant Beholding Ve“kate¶a uses a variety of  dissembling similes and metaphors, from the natural world, the world of  mythic narratives, and that of  human bodies. To use the coinage of  philosopher and comparative theologian Raimon Panikkar, these anubhavas are “cosmotheandric,” bringing together the worlds of  nature, the divine, and the human in elegant balance.98 More self-consciously and systematically theological than either the verses in The Song of Songs or in the nasib-ghazals of  Ibn oArabi, here the divine is directly invoked as the many-guised beloved, present in human, natural, and cosmic forms. And also, unlike the inherited tradition of  the Arabic qasidahs, there is no imagery of  absence here that the poet uses to evoke incommensurability or dissembling metamorphosis. It is here all about manifold, multiple, and simultaneous forms of  presence, natural, divine, and human. In the following poetic description we have natural images in the cold darkness of  the night, in stars, a cool moon, the sea, rivers, and the night sky’s “asylum”; flora and fauna in the bees, peacocks, the lotus, bimba fruit; the world of  sacred narrative and myth in the birth of  the god ‡iva from Vishnu’s sweat, the exploits of  the Love God Kama, Vishnu/Deva- nayaka’s form of  the pastoral child-cowherder Krishna, the creation of the world from the god Brahma, who emerges from the lotus that grows from Vishnu’s navel, the god’s swallowing of  the entire universe at its periodic dissolution, and his freeing of  the cursed wife of  a sage, Ahalya, from a stone. Finally, we have the human world, in the fierce and sensual anthropomorphism of  the imagery common in the southern Tamil and San- skrit literatures: the god whose body’s perfect beauty draws the envy of the jewels that adorn it; his lovemaking with his wife, Laksmi/Padmavati; his scuffed soiled knees as the child Krishna; his sea-creature (Makara) earrings; his curly black hair; the images of  a mother’s womb, the young cowgirls of  Braj; the three folds of  the god’s belly; and the passionate emotions of  the poet’s “devotional eye.” Roughly, from head to toe, in this religious and visionary art, the god is dissembled but not confused, not evoked in metaphors of  absence; the “whole” here is unequivocally present in every “part.” Seeing your lovely body whose splendor is made even more perfect by each perfect limb, enjoyed by your beloved wives with unblinking, astonished 98 See Raimon Panikkar, The Cosmotheadric Experience: Emerging Religious Conscious- ness (New York: Orbis, 1993), esp. “Colligite Fragmenta: For an Integration of  Reality,” 1–77.

(42)99 iv. conclusion: love, ideal bodies, and particularity In a characteristically thoughtful essay on Augustine and Dante on the “ascent of  love,” Martha Nussbaum argues that both Christian writers end up rejecting the Platonic Ascent of  Love, a doctrine ostensibly based upon Socrates’ account of  eros and the ascent up the ladder of  truth in the Symposium. Platonist accounts of  love’s ascent claim, as we have already noted, that as one grows in love one moves up the scale of  being, from earthly to heavenly forms of  love, from love of  the individual person—a 99 From the Devanayakapañca¶at [Fifty verses in praise of  Devanayaka], translated in full in my anthology of  Ve“kate¶a’s Sanskrit, Tamil, and Prakrit poetry: Steven Hopkins, An Ornament for Jewels: Love Poems for the Lord of Gods by Vedantade¶ika (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007). Stanza numbers in original are noted in brackets at the end of  each translated verse. </page> <page sequence="48"> 48 Extravagant Beholding love vulnerable to pain and attachment, to need and desire—to love of his/her qualities, love of  beautiful objects or ideas, and finally, beyond, to a great sea of  beauty and truth, a transcendental state that strips away all that is merely human in love.100 Nussbaum points to Augustine’s moments of  profound ambivalence on this point in the Confessions and ends up claiming that Augustine “advances a picture of  ascent (or ascent combined with descent) that gives a more substantial and more positive role to certain ingredients of  ordinary human love.”101 This valuation of the individual and of  ordinary human love has more to do with Augustine’s critique of  the perfectibility of  the body, his awareness of  the brokenness (the “horizontality,” as it were) of  sin and of  moral weakness, along with a vivid sense of  the power of  memory to draw one back down to the past, than with a pervasive idea about the religious power of  human love. With Dante, however, it is a different matter. Dante’s journey in the Commedia would seem at first glance to be a kind of  model of  love’s ascent. We begin, back in the Vita Nuova, with Dante’s love for Beatrice when both of  them were nine years old, when he first caught sight of  her in her red dress. In the process of  reading the Commedia, particularly when we see Beatrice again in Purgatorio and Paradiso, and feel with Dante the deep emotion of  this reunion after “ten years’ thirst” and the signs of the “old flame” (cognoso i segni de l’antica fiamma; Purg. XXX:48), we witness the steady and sometimes precipitous transformations of  Dante’s beloved girl from Florence: she is Theology, Trinity (the numbers three and nine), Love, teacher, matronly admonisher, even a kind of  figure of Christ, but for all those extraordinary transformations, and all the incon- ceivable rarefied intensities of  her growing physical and spiritual beauty as they ascend, right up to the upper reaches of  Paradise, she remains that same Beatrice, his irreducible “other.” One can even argue that the body of  Beatrice, almost in a physical way, beginning in the Vita Nuova, is the vehicle of  the entire vision, ultimately forming the very framework of  the 100 See Nussbaum’s brilliant essay on the Symposium, “The Speech of  Alcibiades: A Reading of  the Symposium,” 165–99, where she argues that Plato himself, in his construction of  the text, questions the ultimate authority of  Socrates’ speech and its neat arrangement of  the stages of  eros, by including Alcibiades as an all-too-vulnerable foil, desperately and ultimately tragically in love with the very particular and irreducible Socrates, at the end of the dialogue. To interpret Alcibiades only as a kind of  failure or a cautionary tale about the perils of  false eros is to ignore important ironies of  the text and the central dilemma of  love placed before the reader by its author, Plato, at the close of  this “night of  heavy drinking.” 101 See Martha Nussbaum, “Augustine and Dante on the Ascent of  Love,” in The Augus- tinian Tradition, ed. Gareth B. Matthews (Berkeley: University of  California Press, 1999), 63. We have seen this same ambivalence about concrete love of  individuals in Ibn oArabi and his critics. One Line Short </page> <page sequence="49"> History of Religions 49 literary edifice of  the Commedia.102 Even in the transcendental vision of the Rose at the very end of  the journey, the heavenly Rose where all the saints gather into a unity that seems to swallow all particularity, her gaze meets Dante, in flawless clarity, undimmed by great metaphysical and spiritual distance: I, without answering, then looked on high and saw that round her now a crown took shape as she reflected the eternal rays. No mortal eye, not even one that plunged into deep seas, would be so distant from that region where the highest thunder forms, as—there—my sight was far from Beatrice; but distance was no hindrance, for her semblance reached me—undimmed by anything between.103 As Nussbaum remarks: “Her particularity transcends all barriers. In that full particularity he loves her.”104 The awsaf  in The Song of Songs, in Ibn oArabi’s nasib-ghazals of Nizam’s “absent presence,” and Ve“kate¶a’s anubhavas of  the body of Vishnu, though they express different registers of  the particular and the ideal, and different foci on the spectrum of  the divine and the human, do this same thing for the beloved. Sometimes, like the lovely body of  Parvati, daughter of  Himalaya and goddess consort of  Lord ‡iva, they are called “ladders of  love”; we are meant to climb, with the poet, up the body of god or of  the human beloved, from the foot to the head, and grow in the intensity of  our love or our awareness of  the “splendor . . . made even more perfect by each perfect limb.” The great eleventh-century rabbi from Champagne, Schelomo Izhaqui, known as Rashi, in his commentary on the very first verse of  the Song speaks about various levels of  the “kiss”: there is “kissing of  the shoulder, which calls for great exertion, there is kissing of  the hand, where God helps; but then there is kissing of  the mouth, when our prayers are sufficient to yield the desired results through divine intervention.”105 But as we have seen, overall, in the wasf  and in 102 See the fascinating study by Robert Pogue Harrison The Body of Beatrice (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988). It can be argued quite decisively, I believe, that the Paradiso in particular can be seen as an ascent of  the body of  Beatrice, that her body is the vehicle for Dante’s vertical flight up and into the heavenly spheres. 103 Paradiso XXXI:70–77, from the translation of  Alan Mandelbaum ([New York: Bantam, 1986], 283). 104 Nussbaum, “Augustine and Dante,” 81. 105 See Yerushalmi, The Book of Shir HaShirim, 17. See also Matter, The Voice of My Beloved, 137. </page> <page sequence="50"> 50 Extravagant Beholding the anubhava there is really no ladder at all, no one particular direction that is privileged: we oscillate between the poles of  the universal, tran- scendental attributes, love’s beautiful ideas, and, ultimately, the irreducible individuality of  the singular beloved, whether this is made present in the very texture of  the text, as in the Song and in Ve“kate¶a, or is anticipated, as in Ibn oArabi’s nasib-qasidahs. Up or down, ascent or descent, it’s all the same, in that full particularity; we love each limb, its distinctive beauty, as if  it were the whole.106 Here the “who” and the “what” of  eros is in creative tension together, at one point dividing and at another healing the heart, but never absorbed into some “higher” abstract ascendant unity either. At times this literary device emphasizes presence, in a surplus of  praise, as in The Song of Songs and especially in the theological praise poems of  the South Indian saint- poet Ve“kate¶a; at other times, as in the Arabic Odes, there is confusion, the absence (for the time being) of  the particular other in a profusion of imagistic dissemination, an emphasis on eternal progress and the beloved as something, to use the phrase of  both Corbin (glossing Ibn oArabi) and Derrida, “yet to be.” But in all cases a central tension is maintained, a kind of  willed ambiguity that preserves the particular and the ideal—or even more precisely, the particular in the ideal—and it is in this sense precisely that the wasf  and anubhava contribute to the study of  the litera- ture of  love cross-culturally. In these literary motifs of  extravagant description, the irreducible “who” of  love remains, particular among its ideal forms. What remains as well is the standing possibility of  conflict, duality, movement, and instability, along with a sense that what these two lovers have yet before them is not an end to the discourse, not a planned ordered telos of  love but a “con- tinued pursuit” of  better questions. Eros is not a ladder here; it does not trace a vertical motion but rather creates a kind of  charged horizontal space, an energetic arena of  continual risky encounter, a permanent, some- times blissful, sometimes anxious “destinerrance,” where lover and beloved waver in an endless liquid play of  sensations, their bodies mingling with the landscape around them, then separating into distinct persons, at once transpersonal and utterly individual, each to the other, mutually. Love here, at once human and divine, draws together in one gaze the universal in the particular. Swarthmore College 106 Though it is of  course beyond the scope of  this article, one can argue that this emphasis on beauty and particularity is one of  the most compelling ethical dimensions of  eros. For an argument about the role of  “beauty” (and the particular) in ethics and justice theory, with an implied connection to the eros of  beholding the other person, see Elaine Scarry, On Beauty and Being Just (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1999). </page> </plain_text>
