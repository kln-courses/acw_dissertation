<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ambiguous Heritage and Perpetual Promise of Liberal Theology1 Wesley J. Wildman2 / Boston University I. Introduction i 1 he journey of liberal theology in the last couple of centuries is akin to the person who enters a mirror maze with high hopes of finding a JL graceful and quick way through. Beginning with a clear plan about how to navigate the maze, he winds up confused, disoriented, surrounded by useless self-images. He unwittingly passes through the same places over and over again, never gaining a relevant perspective for guiding decisions about where to go next. For some of these lost souls, the overseer of the maze comes to the rescue, perhaps after sensing rising panic, and for the sake of public safety escorts the exhausted liberal theologian out of the maze and into the sunshine, whereafter the shattered explorer swears never again to wander the pointless and confusing halls of liberal theology. Of course, most liberal theologians perpetually wander the maze, fascinated by the images they en counter, not particularly interested in the sunshine outside, and quite content with their experience. At least that's one way of seeing things. There is enough truth in this image that I hope even liberal theologians can, with me, smile wryly and acknowl edge the point?liberal theology has been and remains a fascinating process of world-exploration that rather often yields unwitting repetition, intellectual disorientation, and unseemly self-satisfaction. But there are other ways of caricaturing the journey of liberal theology. One of those alternatives encodes insight roughly equal to that of the mirror-maze caricature. Here it is. The journey of liberal theology in the last couple of centuries is akin to the courageous reformer who correctly diagnoses a profound problem in the sur rounding social context and sets out to transform her community. The envisaged 1.

They assert their authority in an attempt to suppress her prophetic unmasking of conventional dissembling and social control. Enough people get her message, however, that the reactionaries maintain their steely grip only on some of their followers. Others essentially reaffiliate?in intellectual beliefs and spiritual affections, and sometimes in social affiliation as well. Thus the fruits of our revolutionary's efforts are the establishment of a putative counterculture, partly within but mostly outside the mainstream social world that she set out to change. For some reason, the countercultural social organization perpetually shrinks, regardless of the energy she invests in maintenance and growth, which she finds enormously frustrating. Meanwhile the gloating majority culture seems to get new affiliations more or less by default and with relatively little effort. Yet her supposedly countercultural social alternative to the apparently self-sustaining majority social world never completely disappears, mainly because her group receives a steady stream of defectors from the majority group, each one disil lusioned with the same dissembling and social control that drove her to launch the prophetic revolution in the first place. Meanwhile, all of her prophetic energy is now taken up with institutional maintenance, and every night she goes to bed wondering why she is spending her precious days the way she is. So there we have it?two images pointing, in the delightful way only carica tures can, to the ambiguous heritage and perpetual promise of liberal theology. In only slightly more judicious terms, liberal theology tends to be correct in what it criticizes, good in its moral affirmation of radical inclusiveness and equality, and true in its intellectual interpretation of symbolism and its correla tive deconstruction of mythologized beliefs and authoritarian social structures. I say "tends to be correct, good, and true" advisedly. At the level of details, liberal theology often succumbs to an incoherent m?lange of concepts. Despite its notable record of moral courage, it often lacks the moral clarity required to carry through the revolution it perpetually invites. And these problems arise because the social survival of liberal theology depends on the exercise of social control and the deployment of colorful conceptual confusions that the very thoroughgoing critique it recommends would in fact undermine. The point of this paper is to explain these colorful assertions in a way that makes some degree of intellectual, historical, social, psychological, and evo lutionary sense. I begin with a discussion of what liberal theology gets right, more or less. I then move onto what liberal theology gets wrong, more or less. Finally, I discuss what liberal theology can and cannot achieve, more or less. The "more or less" phrase in each of the three section titles is meant to indicate that I will be working at a high level of generalization, driving at salient insights</page><page sequence="3">Volume 32, No. 1, January 2011 45 that persist even when historical details tend to go in a variety of directions simultaneously. The generalizations I offer will have significant problems, but they also convey insights sufficiently useful to warrant this level of analysis. By the phrase "liberal theology" I mean to refer to the multiple streams of thought described in Gary Dorrien's The Making of American Liberal Theology;1* the European threads running from Enlightenment figures such as Kant and Schleiermacher to the Liberal Protestants Ritschl, Herrmann, and Harnack, and beyond, and to the Catholic Modernists Tyrrell, Loisy, and beyond;4 the theological aspects of the Liberal, Progressive, and Reform move ments within Judaism, which Michal Meyer documents in his Response to Modernity;5 and the theological elements within the more recent development of Islamic modernism.6 Most of these strands of intellectual tradition on both sides of the Atlantic attempt to engage cultural wisdom and to accommodate traditional beliefs to it in such a way as to remain faithful to a particular faith tradition?with engagement and fidelity understood differently in different settings; date back to the European Enlightenment, with some having earlier links to the Protestant Reformation; share in various ways the Enlightenment wariness toward externally imposed authority and superstition; share the Enlightenment hope for a peaceful future based on science, tech nology, medicine, the overcoming of tribalism, the rejection of ingroup outgroup exclusion, the collapse of hierarchies, the refusal of fanatical aggression, and the affirmation of a moderate form of religious belief and practice that sustains people in meaningful lives while enhancing creative cultural expression. 3.

The proper contrasts are between liberalism and conservatism, or between liberalism and fundamentalism. Contrary to more recent narrow usage, the word "evangelical" is shared prop erty within the Christian heritage. As the nineteenth-century Protestant battles between modernists and conservatives indicate, most on both sides thought of themselves as evangelicals and the relevant questions were the meanings of en gagement with contemporary cultural wisdom and fidelity to extant traditions of belief and practice. This led to disagreements among evangelicals regarding the nature of reality, authority, history, morality, and church. The later sequestering of the word "evangelical" by conservative evangelicals, and its meek surrender by liberal evangelicals, misleads with regard to the longer history.7 II. What Liberal Theology Gets Right, More or Less I earlier telegraphed three things that liberal theology tends to get right, and I discuss each of these in what follows. Obviously, these are value judgments, not merely historical or descriptive statements. I am writing here as theologian and philosopher, after all, not as historian or cultural anthropologist. Little that is theologically or philosophically interesting can be said about this subject that does not attempt evaluation. I will not make cases for all of these evalua tions, however. I offer them, as much as anything, as a declaration of my own determinate location as a liberal evangelical theologian and as a prelude to the analysis of the ambiguity of liberalism. First, liberal theology tends to be correct in what it criticizes. When David Hume argued that we never have a good reason to believe that miracles occur, he was correct. When Hermann Reimarus quietly complained about the theologically biased quality of historical work into the historical Je sus, he was correct. When Immanuel Kant said that theologians could infer the existence of God neither from patterns in nature nor from the realm of ideas, he was correct. When Friedrich Schleiermacher pointed out that theologians routinely fail to notice how the qualities of their religious experiences directly impact what they are prepared to accept as theologically true, he was correct. When David Strauss noticed the pervasiveness of legendary and mythical ele ments in the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, he was correct. When Adolf von Harnack rejected the centrality of a sacrificial atonement for making sense 7. See the discussion of this point in Wesley J. Wildman and Stephen Chapin Garner, Lost in the Middle? Claiming an Inclusive Faith for Christians Who Are Both Liberal and Evangelical (Herndon, VA: Alban Institute, 2009).</page><page sequence="5">Volume 32, No. 1, January 2011 47 of the significance of Jesus Christ as a manifestation of divine love, he was correct. When Alfred Loisy refuted the deductive theory of Catholic doctrinal development, he was correct. When Ernst Troeltsch attacked the absoluteness of Christianity and the special pleading used to justify it, he was correct. WTien Paul Tillich diagnosed anthropomorphic God concepts as a form of idolatry, he was correct. When Eugene Borowitz disparaged the rigid understanding of covenant that eliminated the possibility of authentic individual religious expression as a Jew, he was correct. WTien Rosemary Ruether drew attention to the fundamentally sexist conceptual and social structures of the Christian tradition, she was correct. Liberal theology has tended to be on the correct side of most of the major points of conflict with conservative theology. In regard to conflicting metaphysi cal visions of reality, liberalism has been correct to be suspicious of supernatu ralism and of the credulity that goes along with conservative affirmations of supernaturalism. In regard to conflicting visions of authority, liberalism has been correct to be suspicious of overly definitive and absolutist conceptions of authority and of the psychological coercion and dangerous forms of social control that go along with conservative affirmations of such conceptions. In regard to conflicting visions of history, liberals have been correct to be suspi cious of dismissal of the historical process of cultural growth and development as irrelevant to salvation and of the neglect of social justice that goes along with conservative affirmations of this dismissal. In regard to conflicting vi sions of morality, liberals have been correct to be suspicious of the fondness for hierarchies, ingroups, and purity judgments in religious ethics and of the discriminatory social practices that go along with conservative affirmations of such principles. In regard to conflicting visions of religious community, liberals have been correct to be suspicious when an emphasis on purity of doctrine sup plants unity in love as the key to communal identity and wary of the ecumenical disasters that go along with conservative affirmations of doctrinal purity. It is because liberalism tends to be on the correct side of these debates that thoughtful people keep flowing leftwards from out of majority religious cultures, seeking a religious home where they can be themselves and express their honest opinions, without fear of reprisals from conservative defenders of religious iden tity with an overdeveloped sense of loyalty to purity of doctrine and practice. Second, liberal theology tends to be good in its moral affirmation of radical inclusiveness and equality WTiile frequently muddled or undecided on metaphysical questions, liberal theologians have tended to be impressively consistent on moral matters. The reason for this appears to be rooted in the intellectual coherence and practical feasibility of the liberal alternative to what can be thought of as the evolu</page><page sequence="6">48 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy tionarily derived moral framework that has guided human and indeed prob ably prehuman hominid groups over long evolutionary time scales. Jonathan Haidt has offered the clearest statement of this evolutionarily derived moral framework and the best diagnosis of how it helps to make sense of the average ethical differences between conservatives and liberals.8 Haidt argues, based on compelling experiments, that we have genetically rooted moral intuitions, and that ethical reasoning serves those reflexive moral feelings by furnishing for them a rational framework and narrative coherence. Very few human beings display the ability to use moral reasoning to change their fundamental moral intuitions. But many people can develop conditioned responses that help regulate the effects of deep-seated intuitive moral reactions. We are not slaves to our moral impulses, therefore, but can organize social forms of life in which we regulate them and thereby transform personal and corporate behavior. Nevertheless, those moral intuitions are extremely powerful. Haidt identifies five cross-culturally universal domains of moral intuition that naturally stimulate appreciation for moral virtues. Most are shared at some level with higher primates. Their evolutionary origins are difficult to support with clear-cut evidence, given the sorts of data available from the far past, but their cross-cultural and even cross-species applicability does seem quite clear: The harm domain is associated with feelings of compassion, virtues such as kindness, and vices such as cruelty and neglect. The fairness domain is associated with feelings of gratitude and anger, virtues such as trustworthiness, and vices such as cheating. The in-group domain is associated with feelings of pride and belonging, virtues such as loyalty and patriotism, and vices such as betrayal. The authority domain is associated with feelings of respect and fear, virtues such as obedience and deference, and vices such as rebellion and disrespect. The purity domain is associated with feelings of satisfaction and disgust, virtues such as cleanliness and chastity, and vices such as tasteless and unnatural behavior. Haidt's research suggests that self-identifying liberals have been socialized to regulate morally loaded feelings that spring from the in-group, authority, and purity domains. Liberals learn to associate feelings of disgust with cruel 8.

Graham, Jonathan Haidt, and B. Nosek, "Liberals and Conservatives Use Different Sets of Moral Foundations," Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 96 (2009): 1029^16.</page><page sequence="7">Volume 32, No. 1, January 2011 49 treatment of people who seem different, and so they endeavor to be tolerant. Similarly, liberals link in-group feelings with racism and xenophobia and au thoritarian feelings with sexism and abuse, so they stay on their guard against these feelings. Liberals still have feelings from these three domains but try to prevent those moral feelings from determining their moral judgments. Instead, they emphasize the domains of harm and fairness. In emphasizing the virtues of doing no harm and being fair to others, liberals intuitively support a simpler and less textured moral system. Haidt calls it a "thin" morality. By contrast, self-identified conservatives treat all five domains with roughly equal importance, making for a "thick" morality. This means, for example, that conservatives tend to trust that their feelings of disgust indicate the morally wrong whereas liberals would be suspicious of the moral value of such feelings. Similarly, loyalty to one's group and deference to figures of authority are virtues prized in conservative moral frameworks because these virtues help to sustain the valuable institutional social arrangements that help us to flourish. The work of moral psychologists such as Haidt, Marc Hauser, Joshua Greene, and others helps to make sense of the way liberals creatively construct a socially borne alternative to the evolutionary default moral framework of human life. The conservative approach has proved its usefulness over time but the liberal approach is far superior in cosmopolitan settings where it is necessary for people to deal routinely with strangers who don't comprehend their in-group hierarchies and purity practices. Moreover, the principles of equality and distributive justice are much better served by the liberal "thin" morality than by the conservative treasuring of distinctions derived from in-group-out-group awareness, hierar chical deference, and purity rules. Evidently, the evolutionary stabilization of human morality supports more than one system of moral principles, but the conservative system requires less maintenance energy than the liberal system in most social settings. Only in relatively rare cosmopolitan socioeconomic contexts is it worth the social trouble to devote the significant cultural resources necessary to teach people to regulate their moral instincts and thereby to support the thin morality that liberals prize. But the high-energy, thin alternative to the low-energy, thick evolutionary default setting for human moral life is intellectually coherent, practically potent, and highly relevant to the cultural conditions of modernity and postmodernity. That's why liberals have tended to be on the right side of debates over inclusiveness and equality. Third, liberal theology tends to be true in its intellectual interpretation of sym bolism and its correlative de construction of mythologized beliefs and authoritar ian social structures.</page><page sequence="8">50 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy The most important intellectual contribution of liberal theology has been its articulation of a sophisticated hermeneutical alternative to the plain read ing of religious texts, beliefs, and imaginative worlds. There is good evidence that most religious people in all traditions and at all times treat their beliefs with poetic license to various degrees. Few people think God is actually "up" in the sky, wherever that might actually be on a near-spherical planet. Despite this, a surprisingly large number of people actually believe that Elijah really ascended on a fiery chariot to God and that Jesus really ascended upwards to God, as if God really were "up" somehow. Liberal theologians hold that poetic license must be applied to religious texts and beliefs more often than most religious people suspected over the centuries, especially when the goal is to make accurate historical and metaphysical sense of the world. Liberal theologians also offered a persuasive rationale for this viewpoint, namely, that secular scientific and historical understanding can make a posi tive contribution to purifying religious belief and practice of their errors and excesses. Implicit here, and only occasionally made completely explicit, is the belief that cultural developments manifest divine truth just as divine revelation does, and that religion is a partially problematic phenomenon that requires purification, even as it remains an indispensable means of human engagement with ultimate reality. Unfortunately, most liberal theologians have been better at naming and theorizing the problem than at articulating the constructive alternative that liberal theology represents. The problem has been variously named mythology, credulity, superstition, idolatry, anthropocentrism, or anthropomorphism, with the correlative theological goal being demythologization, hermeneutical sophistication, iconoclasm, theocentrism, or something similar. The names are fine as far as they go. What is really needed, however, is a theory of reli gious symbols that can explain how religious symbols succeed in effectively and truly and authentically engaging people with ultimacy even when the person wielding them does so without being aware of their myth-laden or idolatrous character. Here as always, few liberal theologians go all the way and theorize the underlying hermeneutical dynamics.9 Most are reluctant to make explicit the outrageous but unavoidable implication of their viewpoint?that our knowledge is actually progressing and that, despite our perpetual moral confusion and bad behavior, we know better than the ancients did what in a sacred text is likely to be true regarding history and nature. While the timidity is disappointing, the view itself is deeply true. 9. A notable exception to this lamentable trend is Robert Cummings Neville, The Truth of Broken Symbols (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1996).</page><page sequence="9">Volume 32, No. 1, January 2011 51 III. What Liberal Theology Gets Wrong, More or Less Earlier, I hinted at three things that liberal theology tends to get wrong, and I discuss each of these next. Once again, note that these are evaluations, par ticularly the first two. I trust they draw some measure of support from the explanations and arguments presented on their behalf. First, liberal theology often succumbs to an incoherent m?lange of concepts. I offer here an example of liberal theological incoherence. In so doing I am necessarily selective. The selection made may suggest that science dictates what theology can and must do, but this is a misleading side-effect of the chosen example. Religion and humanistic insights of all kinds can and do rightly contest the attitudes and practices and sometimes even the theories of the human sciences and the natural sciences. In longer presentations, the refusal of reductionisms of both the scientific and theological varieties can be made perfectly clear.10 There is an infamous dispute within each of Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam over the theological implications of evolution. While this dispute rises on the back of the liberal-conservative disputes I described earlier, it has its own special quality. Liberal theologians take the line, as usual, that secular scientific and historical knowledge is valuable and consonant with our understanding of God. Thus, they seek to harmonize traditional beliefs with scientific knowledge and will confidently declare that "God creates through evolution." That is fine as an initial hypothesis, but it is shocking how few liberal theologians think through the implications of this superficially amiable declaration. Consider Charles Darwin, who began his scholarly career as a convinced believer that God intentionally conceived, designed, and created the world in roughly the form Darwin encountered it. As a young man he read and accepted the still-famous design arguments of his countryman William Paley.11 After all, he couldn't explain the wondrous structure of the eye any other way; he had to assume a personal, benevolent, attentive, and active designer God. As his studies widened and deepened, however, Darwin's theological views slowly shifted. Though he never discovered the DNA mechanism by which traits 10.

Wildman, Science and Religious Anthropology; A Spiritually Evocative, Naturalistic Interpretation of Human Life (Farnham, UK: Ashgate, 2009); Religious Philosophy as Multidisciplinary Comparative Inquiry: Envisioning a Future for the Philosophy of Religion (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 2010); Religious and Spiritual Experiences (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2011). 11.

Faulder, 1802).</page><page sequence="10">52 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy were transmitted across generations, he was confident that trait preservation and transmission occur, and that random variations of traits make organisms more and less fit to survive the rigors of any given environment. He believed that this process of trait inheritance, random variation, and natural selection in competitive environments is powerful enough to explain the origin of spe cies, which is the name he gave to his most famous book. And he assembled a formidable array of evidence to support his theory?evidence that is extraor dinarily difficult to explain apart from the evolutionary hypothesis. Unsurprisingly, Darwin's view of God changed as the secrets of the natural world opened before his uncanny gaze. God was no longer necessary to explain the particulars of the world and its teeming life forms. Rather, God's domain was the creation of the potentialities of the world-as-a-whole, a world that answered to the description that the theory of evolution provided. Unsurpris ingly, to Darwin God gradually seemed less personal, benevolent, attentive, and active. Surely such a loving, personal deity would have created in another way, a way that involved less trial and error, fewer false starts, less mindless chance, fewer tragic species extinctions, less dependence on random symbiotic collaborations, fewer pointless cruelties, and less reliance on pr?dation to sort out the fit from the unfit. Darwin arguably never lost his faith in God. Rath er, believing that God created through the evolutionary process, his growing knowledge of that process dramatically transformed his view of God. And this left him ill-at-ease with the anthropomorphic personal theism of his day and with friends and colleagues who believed in a personal, benevolent, attentive, and active divine being. Theists who casually assert that God creates through evolution?as if there is no theological problem with this?should pause and consider Darwin's faith journey. Darwin was theologically more perceptive than many of the liberal theologians who have endorsed his scientific views. He knew that saying God creates through evolution puts enormous stress on belief in a personal, benevo lent, attentive, and active deity. Evolution casts a pall over the moral clarity that most people want to see in the God they worship and serve. Darwin felt the difficulty acutely. Tragically, many liberal theologians since Darwin have only casually struggled with the problem, after which they easily blend evolu tionary theory and belief in a personal, benevolent, attentive, and active God as if there is no problem. Many conservative theologians feel the problem more sharply and some take a stand against evolution precisely to avoid implications for God's nature that they cannot countenance. A God who really did create through evolution would be morally unrecognizable to them, a kind of heartless gambler over the lives and wellbeing of Earth's creatures, and not at all like the loving and</page><page sequence="11">Volume 32, No. 1, January 2011 53 wise Parent they trust and serve. This would contradict their morally clear and homey worldview, which is borne up by a God of pure compassion and perfect goodness. Because they take on authority the proposition that God is personal, benevolent, attentive, and active, they know with confidence that Darwin must have been wrong, both in his science and in his theology. Now, in my view, conservative-evangelical theologians who reject evolution in favor of creationism, or who embrace the neocreationism of Intelligent Design theory, make a serious error in judgment. Yet they may understand what is theologically at stake in evolution far better than most of their liberal theologian counterparts who casually resolve the issue by declaring that God creates through evolution, without pausing to think through what that must mean. Where the conservative theologians display acute sensitivity to the co herence of theological concepts, too many liberal theologians are careless with the prized value of conceptual coherence. Second, liberal theology often lacks the moral clarity required to carry through the revolution it perpetually invites. While often displaying impressive moral courage, a distressingly large num ber of liberal theologians seem unprepared to follow through on the moral obligations they incur because of their working theological commitments. But the same is true in a different way with conservative theologians. To make this clear, what would "following through" look like in the case of the evolution and creation example just discussed? For a conservative evangelical theologian, following through would mean dreaming up a theologically coherent alternative narrative of creation that could ultimately prove scientifically credible. An example of a theologically coherent creation narrative is C. S. Lewis's creation story, which is presented in a lesser known volume of his Narnia Chronicles called The Magicians Nephew. The children in that story are present when the great Lion Asian creates Narnia and its creatures. The method of creation is beautifully intimate and personal: Asian sings in a majestic voice, with spectacularly complex undertones and rip pling overtones, and the world awakens around him. Each creature struggles up and out of the Narnian soil, awakening to a new world, personally called into being by the fatherly Lion God himself. Lewis grasped the point that Darwin also felt so forcefully: the God Lewis believed in could not create in a way much different than Asian did. Good literature is able to test the coherence of the "God creates through evolution" idea. So long as God is conceived as a personal, benevolent, attentive, and active being, like Asian, the literary acid test shows that God cannot and would not create through evolution. They just don't fit. But Lewis's alternative narrative does fit. Conservative evangelical Christians who resist evolutionary theory for theo</page><page sequence="12">54 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy logical reasons are shrewdly targeting a problem for their God-infused world view, perhaps the sharpest problem that worldview has ever faced. They are not tiptoeing around, pretending that the God they trust every day somehow creates through evolution. They construct a theologically plausible alternative narrative?most recently Intelligent Design theory?and then try to show that it has the scientific chops to take on evolutionary theory. Of course, it does not have any scientific credibility whatsoever, and that's where the conservative re sponse to evolution falls on its face, and conservatives fail to follow through. On the side of liberal theologians, the embarrassing pratfall happens much earlier. Their theological narrative is incoherent from the outset because they train themselves not even to feel the contradiction embedded in the idea that a personal, benevolent, attentive, and active deity creates through evolution. Intellectual coherence requires that this God, or evolution, must go. Now, for the most part, liberal theologians are in no doubt about the exceptional robustness of the theory of evolution, even if tragically few of them really know anything about it. After all, it is as stable a scientific theory as the atomic theory of matter. For liberal theologians, therefore, the choice of God or evolu tion should lead to a conclusion opposite to that of conservative theologians. God the creator simply cannot be a personal, benevolent, attentive, and active deity. Liberal theologians can preserve those affirmations symbolically and poetically, but they do not refer to a divine being with intentions and aware ness, with feelings and intelligence, with plans and powers to act, and with a moral character that humans can recognize as good. Rather, these symbolic assertions refer to the ground of being itself, to the creative and fecund power source in the depths of nature, to the value structures and potentialities that reality manifests. They refer to the God beyond God, which is to say the truly ultimate reality that hovers behind and beneath and beyond the symbolic Gods we create and deploy to satisfy our personal needs, to make sense of our world, and to legitimate the exercise of social control. Now, this is theologically coherent! It is just as coherent as the conservative creation narratives. And it has the excellent virtue that it takes evolutionary biology with proper seriousness, which neither conservative theologians nor liberal theologians manage to do very often. With this option available, there fore, why don't more liberal theologians move in that direction? Why don't they finish their thought, follow through, see the implications of their ideas and commit to them? The reason amounts to an indictment of liberal theology. To follow through would take more than just acute sensitivity to the coherence of theological concepts. It would take peculiar moral clarity as well, because so few people are spiritually attuned to the abysmal ground of being rumbling in fecund creativity, morally impenetrable, imponderably beautiful, and defying</page><page sequence="13">Volume 32, No. 1, January 2011 55 rational grasp. Liberal theologians are, in general, quite nice people, and they don't like offending anyone or hurting feelings. And that is what following through would do. It would hurt. Moral clarity is difficult to come by in this world at the best of times, so we do well to be slow to judge, lest we are caught in the hypocrisy of our own standards. Nevertheless, I venture to say that liberal theology has tended to lack the moral clarity needed to fulfill the revolution of majority-culture religious frameworks promised in its basic ideas. Third, liberal theology is socially self-defeating and survives symbiotically in rela tionship with authoritarian and myth-laden forms of religious belief and practice We are now at the point where we can draw our first diagnostic conclusions about the peculiar status of liberal theology as a modern movement of thought. Its fondness for conceptual unclarities serves an important double function. On the one hand, the insensitivity to conceptual imprecision masks the lack of moral clarity I just described, which allows most liberal theologians to live with themselves happily within the maze of mirrors in which their failure to follow through leaves them. On the other hand, it avoids hurting the very people who are supposed to be supported and nurtured by liberal theology?ordinary reli gious people seeking a meaningful religious framework that embraces cultural wisdom from many sources and that helps them grow in faith while encourag ing individual creativity. WTien liberal theologians overcome the insensitivity to conceptual imprecision and truly follow through, they become quite radical, de claring the death of God and uncovering the social construction of religion. The majority of liberal theologians conclude that the radicals go too far, sacrificing the traditional mediating liberal theologian's virtue of graceful balance between theology and culture?sacrificing it in the name of fidelity to the alien criterion of conceptual consistency. But this critique of radicalism is a mere diversionary tactic in the mirror world of the liberal theologian; it does not address the issue most profoundly at stake in the confrontation of traditional religious and modern secular perspectives on ultimate reality but merely finesses it. The criteria employed in this finesse are the same criteria that allow insen sitivity to conceptual incoherence to mask liberal theology's moral unclarity. They are criteria that prioritize the survival and flourishing of liberal religious communities, regardless of the intellectual cost. So the liberal theologian con tinues to affirm the comforting comprehensible personal God that we fondly construct in affluent democratic capitalist cultural contexts, the God of endless love who cosuffers with us, the God who wouldn't hurt a flea and especially not me, because this is what the community requires. And the price paid? anthropomorphic conceptual incoherence and inconsistency with the implica tions of other forms of knowledge such as evolutionary biology?is judged acceptable because nothing less will sustain the community.</page><page sequence="14">56 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy Liberal theologians tend to make these judgments about social feasibility reflexively without much evidence of what is really possible in religious com munities, but I think they are fundamentally correct. Thus, nobody should be surprised that most liberal religious denominations shrink; people sense that something is rotten at the conceptual core of liberal religion even when they prefer it to the alternatives. Most liberal pastors, priests, and rabbis still do not know how to preach a clear religious message of good news not because they lack intelligence but because it is genuinely unclear what such a message would be. Most liberal religious communities are dominated by people whose appreciation for emotional and spiritual connectedness is pronounced enough to overcome their discomfort with the conceptual problems at the core of lib eral theology. Rationalists who get their kicks from ideas rather than human connections either belong to conservative religious communities, where at least the ideas are clear even if they are fantastic, or else they stay away from religion altogether. Younger children can't understand the subtleties of the message because it depends on sophisticated hermeneutics requiring years of schooling. When they get older they get almost no help in deconstructing and reinterpreting the symbols they absorbed as children because few if any of the adults around them know what to make of their religious beliefs either. Liberal religious groups lose most of their children in early adolescence when it dawns on the kids that what they hear at church doesn't even make as much sense as their oversimpli fied middle-school social studies textbooks. Most liberal religious communities have almost zero conversions of people in the sensitive teenage years. Teenagers learn a treasured lifestyle, and sometimes return to it when they have children of their own, but few develop a conceptually coherent faith?at least until the persistence of committed habits of participation over a lifetime yield the fruits of wisdom in old age. The new members that keep most liberal religious communities afloat are disenchanted conservatives who love the freedom of liberal communities so much that they are willing to tolerate the conceptual muddles they are confronted with in every sermon and prayer. And the people who become liberal theologians are more often conservatives who went through some sort of disenchantment than people raised within a liberal setting from a young age. Most liberal church people don't even feel comfortable with the idea of their children becoming pastors or priests, because they don't have as much respect for that profession as they used to. Groups survive best whose identity can be narrated by children. Psycho logical studies of what children can appreciate and remember show that the minimally counterintuitive grand narratives of conservative religions have a decided advantage over the subtleties and intellectual sophistication of liberal</page><page sequence="15">Volume 32, No. 1, January 2011 57 theological narratives.12 Thus, liberal theology is socially self-defeating. It is too difficult for kids to understand, and most adults don't really understand it either. But people can sense that something is incoherent in the story with remarkable accuracy, even when they can't say precisely what it is. Myth-laden beliefs and practices are better for sustaining religious communities even though those beliefs are less true than what results when those beliefs are processed through the sophisticated hermeneutics of liberal theology. It follows that liberal theology depends on majority culture conservative religious groups for its survival. The robust social strategies of conservative religion are more nearly self-sustaining, and liberal groups can live reasonably well by receiving their alienated castoffs with open arms. An interesting question is whether this relationship is parasitic or symbi otic. I think we have here a symbiosis, where the dependence of liberal on conservative religious communities is more obvious. The reverse dependence is subtle but important. Without liberal religion, conservative religion would lack the natural enemy it needs to consolidate social identity, and conserva tive extremism relative to the wider culture would make an entire religion culturally suspect. It is indeed a symbiosis. So liberal religious communities will continue to shrink but they will not vanish. Everyone needs a place to take cover when the bright sunshine of authoritarian and myth-laden forms of religious belief and practice become overbearing, and liberal religion of fers a welcome place of respite, even with its defective narratives and its questionable moral clarity. IV. What Liberal Theology Can and Cannot Achieve, More or Less The picture of liberal theology that emerges from this analysis, if correct, is intriguing. I am describing a profoundly ironic, almost paradoxical, reality in which the quest for justice and truth at the heart of the liberal theological project endangers the social resources needed to sustain the quest. Yet I am also identifying a symbiotic mechanism whereby the social vehicles of liberal theology survive fluidly by means of receiving the disillusioned defectors from the majority religious world and energizing them despite their disenchantment. Finally, I am hinting at a form of high-energy, high-education, high-culture sociopolitical organization in which liberal theology is at home in a way that 12. These results are presented and discussed in Scott Atran, In Gods We Trust: The Evo lutionary Landscape of Religion (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002); P. Boyer and C. Ramble, "Cognitive Templates for Religious Concepts: Cross-Cultural Evidence for Recall of Counter-Intuitive Representations," Cognitive Science 25 (2001): 535-64.</page><page sequence="16">58 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy more authoritarian and mythological forms of religious belief and practice never can be. I discuss these three propositions here. First, there is a profoundly ironic, almost paradoxical, reality in which the quest for justice and truth at the heart of the liberal theological project endangers the social resources needed to sustain the quest. Groups need hierarchies and the relationships of deference they foster in order to run efficiently. Groups need out-groups in order to foster in-group solidarity. Groups need purity rules in order to get people to conform to group norms and to appear acceptable to one another. Groups need recruitment mechanisms that allow outsiders toj?in and to be grateful to be a part. Groups need clear identity narratives that a child can appreciate in order to survive down the generations. Groups need cosmologized versions of those narratives to bolster the authority of imperfect leaders when their stupidity provokes damaging criticism. These are the low-energy defaults within the evolutionary landscape of human group life. And yet groups founded on liberal theological principles effectively undermine every single one of these principles. Liberal theology's quest for justice and truth therefore endangers the social resources needed to sustain the communities that liberal theology serves. For liberal theology to fulfill its promise, it must inevitably plunge into a kind of radicalism that makes all of this uncomfortably clear. For liberal theol ogy to avoid that outcome inevitably requires arresting thought on its natural trajectory, leading first to conceptual incoherence and then to traditions of discourse in which such fuzziness is tolerated and even replicated to the point of desensitization. To return to our two caricatures, liberal theology's mirror maze existence is directly correlated with its noble determination to supplant authoritarian and superstitious forms of religion. Second, there is a symbiotic mechanism whereby the social vehicles of liberal theology survive fluidly through receiving disillusioned defectors from the major ity social world and energizing them despite their disenchantment, while simul taneously saving religion from becoming culturally despised by elites who reject conservative religious social practices. These social realities mean that, at least for the foreseeable future, and at least in most cultural contexts, liberal theology must remain in a symbiotic re lationship with conservative theology, just as liberal and conservative religious communities are symbiotically related. In one direction, conservative groups are more nearly aligned with low-energy default patterns for evolutionarily stabilized human belief and behavior, so they define the majority religious culture in most circumstances. But without the legitimation that liberal intellectual culture supplies, conservative religion often appears ridiculous or dangerously credulous to the wider culture, especially to</page><page sequence="17">Volume 32, No. 1, January 2011 59 its culturally powerful elite voices. And without the religious haven of liberal religious communities to mitigate the resentment of disaffected conservatives, the authoritarianism and superstition so rampant in conservative religious groups would produce not just defectors, but dangerous enemies with every reason to attack conservative religious identity in the wider culture. In the other direction, liberal religious groups depend on conservative re ligious groups for their sheer institutional buoyancy, for the steady stream of frustrated immigrants fleeing the hostile shores of conservatism, and for conservatism's ability to win the new converts that make an entire religion socially viable and culturally relevant. Liberal theology also depends on semi mythic statements of conservative doctrine that function both as easy targets for liberal theological deconstruction and as decoys to deflect attention from the intellectual inadequacies of liberal theological constructions. There is no possibility of totally escaping this symbiotic relationship at the present time. The fundamental reason for this is that the religious truth is misaligned with evolutionary interests. To discover the truth about religious matters, therefore, is usually to interfere with the mechanisms that allow reli gious groups?and indeed any group?to flourish. Third, there is a form of high-energy, high-education, high-culture sociopolitical organization in which liberal theology is at home in a way that more authoritarian and mythological forms of religious belief and practice can never be. The fact that conservative theology and religion runs more nearly with the evolutionary grain than liberal theology and religion means that conservativism requires less energy than liberalism for its sustenance. Liberal theology and liberal religious groups require far more energy in every aspect of social life, save for the defense of institutional authority. When the message is hard to understand, it has to be explained. When the reading of sacred texts requires sophisticated hermeneutics, training has to be provided. WTien institutional budgets have to be fought for and competent religious leaders are scarce, mini mally trained volunteers are indispensable, with associated costs in identity maintenance. When instinctive tribal moralism has to be perpetually intercepted and challenged, there will be conflict and division. All of this takes energy. This in turns defines the conditions for picturing a more nearly self-sustaining form of liberal theology and liberal religious community. A symbiotic partner for liberal theology and liberal religion is inevitable because the terminus of liberal theology being misaligned with evolutionary interests makes liberal theology inescapably socially self-defeating. But it is conceivable that liberal theology and religion could find its symbiotic partner in a sociopolitical struc ture rather than in conservative theology and religion. In that case, it would be necessary for the symbiotic partner to be a high-energy enterprise, a high</page><page sequence="18">60 American Journal of Theology and Philosophy culture achievement, appealing to high-education people. This envisaged wider sociopolitical culture would so prize education, rich cultural expression, and the thin morality of liberal compassion and justice that many of the requirements for the flourishing of liberal theology and religion would already be met. In that new symbiosis, liberal religion would supply a venue for the exploration and celebration of the moral and spiritual and aesthetic depth structures of human existence, under the rubric of whatever symbolic forms prove ready to hand at the time. This possibility has been partially realized in a few places, here and there, such as the cosmopolitan coastal regions of the US, but only ever partially. The symbiotic relationship with conservative theology and religion is still at center stage and unlikely to be displaced for some time. Moreover, as soon as disaster strikes, eliminating the preconditions for the flourishing of high-energy cultural creations, this possibility vanishes instantly, and human social life reverts to its low-energy defaults, with hierarchical, superstitious, authoritarian, purity conscious in-groups defining themselves by contrast with alien out-groups. There are no in-principle limits to how far human beings can go in attempting to fashion cultural products that fly in the face of the low-energy default pat terns stabilized through evolutionary pressures, but the practical challenges are daunting indeed. V. Conclusion I would like to reinforce one point in concluding. The inevitability that liberal ism should be in symbiotic partnerships either with conservativism or secular ism derives not from any failure of liberal institutional imagination but from the very nature of the truth to which liberal theology draws our attention, in its sadly half-hearted way. To see the face of God is to become instantly aware that the social construction of reality is genuine, and that its purpose in signifi cant part is to hide from that terrifying divine visage. Liberal theology allows just enough of the threatening dark side of the divine to show forth that it has good tools for deconstructing everyone else's authoritarian deflections and anthropomorphic theological defects. But nobody escapes divine judgment, not even the annoyingly enlightened liberal theologian. In other words, the dark truth that liberal theology has a flimsy grasp on is, like ?iva, as destructive as it is creative. It unmasks everything, and so is poorly fitted to sustaining any civilizational project, all of which require dissembling, deflection, distraction, and the defusing of desperation. The ultimate destina tion of liberal theology?the dark place to which it points but dare not actually go?is a type of mystical awareness in which the cognitively all-surpassing,</page><page sequence="19">Volume 32, No. 1, January 2011 61 morally impenetrable, and aesthetically overwhelming qualities of ultimacy are spurs to worship. But when we draw close to this dark place, in the midst of the blazing sunshine of the social construction of reality, we find a shady spot under the leafy boughs of an institutionally impossible tree, floating above an impossibly profound abyss. In that strange place, people gather who see ulti macy most clearly for what it is. They can build nothing and sustain nothing, at least not under the tree. But they can be with one another, speechless and joking, watching and listening. Here there is no liberalism or conservatism, no institutions and no cultural expressions, for it is the place of rest from all such exertions. But it is also a peculiarly demanding resting place because of its impossibly natural rules. There is no dissembling there, no deflection or distraction, and desperation is never defused; rather everything is allowed to be what it will be, in the presence of the few who gather there. This shady refuge can never be institutionalized. It needs no defense because people can always find it in the cracks of ordinary and extraordinary institu tional achievements. It is the underside habitation of spiritual beings in every religious and cultural tradition that has ever existed. It is a fecund place, spill ing over with the wisdom of not taking ourselves so seriously. It unobtrusively nurtures the bright topsides of constructive institutional ventures. The tradi tions of ideas and poetry that describe this place are another way to find it, and those traditions would perish were it not for the dominant top-side religions that bear forward everything with them, including the deep underside tradi tions that are almost indistinguishable from one another across religions and cultures. To speak of this shady place is to utter the last word before plunging into the abyss of infinite darkness into which all human ventures plunge, into which all human beings plunge, in due course. This is the perpetual promise of liberal theology?its hinting at the shady underside of the brightly lit top-side traditions of religion and culture. It hints, yes, and then the institutional commitments of liberal theology prevent it from completing the thought, from following through. But liberal theology hints truly, and sometimes even beautifully. And when all is said and done, in a world like ours, it is better to be lost and happy in a mirror maze than to be clearly oriented in the bright light of a world of delusions.</page></plain_text>
