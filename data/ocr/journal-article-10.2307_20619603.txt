<plain_text><page sequence="1">Contested Terrain: Gustave Courbet's Hunting Scenes Shao-Chien Tseng During his lifelong quest to develop a Realist aesthetic, Gustave Courbet elaborated on the Romantic legacy that emphasized artistic subjectivity and natural vision. With the goal of interpreting the manners and ideas of his time, he produced an oeuvre that reflected his critical understanding of and articulated historical problems in how humans per ceived and treated animals. This is especially evident in his hunting scenes, chiefly painted between 1856 and 1869, which display a profound conflict between the desire to pursue and master wildlife and mourning for the prey's unnatural death. Courbet's multilayered series of hunting paintings, which defy the unity of coherent narrative, may be read as the artist's inscription in the charged historical mo ment of the revival of royal venery, middle-class enthusiasm for the hunt, and the rising animal protection movement of nineteenth-century France. His representations of the hunt elicited divergent reactions from his contemporaries, which signal the crisis and attempted reinvention of the tradition of this pictorial genre. In the face of an increasingly urbanized, industrial, and capitalistic society, Courbet sustained his ar tistic practice by drawing on the resilience and nurturing of nature, which provided him with vital sources of artistic in spiration, spiritual healing, rural bourgeois identity, physical exercise, dreams, and memory.1 Courbet saw in nature a rich and complex ensemble, encompassing the environment and its various organisms, humanity, and the instincts. His em brace of nature as a guiding principle of life is manifest in a letter to his writer friend Champfleury in 1863: "I take my convictions from nature, and for me the totality of men and things is nature."2 Courbet's conception of nature epitomizes a fundamental desire for the fullness of existence; it is not opposed to culture or history as otherness but is rather interwoven with art and philosophy. Courbet's hunting scenes call attention to human-animal relations mediated by cultural values and embody his endeavors to resolve the contested identities of both modern artist and hunter. While Courbet's landscape, hunting, and animal paintings were often admired for their innovative techniques and vir tuoso facture and effects, the artist's erstwhile defenders Theophile Thore and Francis Wey,3 as well as modern schol ars Linda Nochlin, T. J. Clark, and Anne Wagner considered them to be devoid of sociopolitical significance, little more than conciliatory gestures to the market.4 The consensus has, however, changed in recent decades, and Courbet's land scapes are now investigated in social, geologic, and phenom enological terms and linked to the impact of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's work of educational philosophy, Emile.5 Although Courbet's hunting imagery has garnered scant scholarly at tention, the empathy and respect for the hunted animals portrayed have been duly noted. Klaus Herding read these qualities as a metaphor for political persecution, and James Rubin construed them as a call for ethical responsibility toward nature.6 In a more extensive article, Kerstin Thomas argued that Courbet's hunting scenes are expressive of his persona as a provincial savage and his adoption of the French venery tradition.7 Such observations are largely based on the artist's biography, rather than Courbet's hunting images, whose historical, psychological, and aesthetic complexities merit further study, for a number of questions remain to be explored. There is the apparent discrepancy between words and visual representations: What accounts for the gap be tween the innovative paintings and the conventional venery terminology of their titles? Is there a dynamic interplay or even a productive dissonance to be found between Courbet's letters, notes, and paintings? What manner of debate over hunting and animal issues informed Courbet's reconceptual ization of the traditional genre? What role did hunting play in defining notions of masculinity, and how did Courbet's work negotiate with the norm? What kind of spectatorship was addressed or encouraged by the paintings, which failed to win the government support and aristocratic patronage that works in the hunting genre had enjoyed in the past? An examination of these hitherto neglected questions can tease out the psychological resonances and social struggles embed ded in Courbet's hunting scenes and writings and elucidate how they contributed to mid-nineteenth-century French nat ural history and animal rights discourses. Courbet concentrated on two aspects of the hunt?the capture and suffering of the quarry and the hunter's peaceful and reflective moment afterward. This thematic treatment departed radically from the two dominant approaches to the subject of the period. One is the continuation of the deco rative and propagandist functions that the hunting genre fulfilled for patrons and spectators in the eighteenth century. Francois Desportes (1661-1743) and Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686-1755) depicted the favored animals and hunting ex ploits of French monarchs Louis XIV and Louis XV respec tively in paintings that decorated royal palaces and chateaux, including Versailles and Marly (Fig. I).8 Their compositions carefully exploit the effects of colorful patterns and lively movement on the plane surface of the canvas and, with the glorification of an elitist blood sport, tacitly acknowledge royal prerogatives. The critical fortunes of Desportes and Oudry enjoyed a revival in the middle of the nineteenth century; Charles Blanc, in his influential Histoire despeintres de toutes les ecoles: Ecole frangaise, expressed nostalgia for the bygone monarchy and its magnificent venery culture and celebrated the two artists' accurate portrayals of animal anat omy, physiognomy, and habits, as well as the delightful, splen did, and vivacious effects of decoration they created.9 The pictorial combination of naturalism and artifice was much emulated by Louis-Godefroyjadin (1805-1882) and Philippe Rousseau (1816-1887), who won support from important financiers and the court of Napoleon III during the Second</page><page sequence="2">CONTESTED TERRAIN: GUSTAVE COURBET'S HUNTING SCENES 219 Oudry, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H Stag the ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H llVs X (211 X ^^^^^^^^^M^^H^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^HII^^^^^^H des ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^I^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^BS^^^^^^^I^l^^^B the ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^SS^^^^RflHI^^^^H 2 Louis-Godefroy Jadin, The Quarry, 1841, oil on canvas, 57 X 893/4 in.

The paintings of Eugene Delacroix, Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, and Eugene Fromentin demon strate a strong fascination with the sublime ferocity of exotic wildlife?such as tigers and lions?and the savage masculinity of Arabic hunters (Fig. 3). In contrast to these two modes of representation, Courbet's hunting scenes refuse to revel in the victory, plenitude, and possession that the royal commis sions persistently conveyed, nor do they conjure a fantastic spectacle of wilderness and exoticism. Rather, they constitute a Realist vision of the anguish and death of the quarry, an alternative strategy to revitalize history painting, and a prob ing inquiry into the artist-hunter's inner journey. Courbet's paintings engage with the notion of hunting as a native heritage and masculine sport and, at the same time, through ethical and aesthetic reflection, achieve a dialectic between familiarity and strangeness, between belonging and alien ation in an uncanny geography. Rural Hunting Throughout his career, Courbet trumpeted his identification with the rural customs of the Franche-Comte, bordering Switzerland, and his knowledge of its specific geologic won ders: rocky cliffs, deep valleys, dark grottoes, and subterra nean streams. The dense forests and abundant game of the Jura Mountains, suggests John Berger, encouraged the devel opment of the perceptual habits of a hunter.11 At the time, with hunting rights no longer reserved for the nobility, hunt ing and poaching became common activities among the lo cals seeking food, profit, and recreation. Here, hunting mat tered profoundly in physical, psychic, and material aspects of life. As a landowner's son and aspiring artist, Courbet never represented himself as an active member of the agrarian economy, but he adopted the roles of dandy, bohemian, duelist, lover, and hunter in the context of his native soil. Courbet's letters supply many reasons for his hunting pas sion, which provided him with opportunities to study zoology, an excuse for violent exercise, a temporary release from the</page><page sequence="3">220 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 2 pressures of work, and a sense of accomplishment.12 Some times he succumbed to compulsive poaching but found no lasting gratification in it.13 Thus, paradoxically, hunting was both liberating and disturbing?both a cure and the cause of a sense of estrangement from nature. He wished to become a hunter, a vocation he deemed no less important than that of artist. Indeed, the impulse to hunt may have sometimes over ridden his artistic activities, as his faithful supporter and hunting companion Jules Castagnary testified: "A hunter as much as a painter, he interrupted a nature study more than once to grab his gun and shoot something down in pass ing."14 Courbet bragged about his ingenuity and skill in the conquest of his prey and collected weaponry and antlers as trophies. Hunting took him back to his childhood haunts in the wild, strengthened his bond with male companions and family members, and expanded his social circle when he joined a German aristocratic hunting club in 1858 and a French imperial venery at Rambouillet in 1861.15 For Courbet, hunting, like the creation of art, straddled the line between autotelic and recuperative play and compet itive sport that set specialized rules and aimed at victory and distinction. While hunting embodied the nuances and hierarchies of rural life and social relationships, the promising profitability of the hunting genre also served as an impetus for Courbet's painting. In a letter to Champfleury in 1860, Courbet claimed hunting pictures offer a "neutral ground where everybody agrees" and asserted that he "will benefit from the current vogue for landscapes and animals."16 Hunting imagery took on various forms in the mid-nineteenth century; highly visible in the Salon exhibitions of painting and prints, in the deco rative objects, children's toys, and culinary utensils of upper and middle-class households, it also showed up in illustrated books and periodicals like L Illustration and he Magasin Pitto resque. Contemporary caricatures by J.-J. Grandville, Honore Daumier, and Cham addressed the popularity of the bour geois field sport and often lampooned Parisian hunters' frus trated and maladroit excursions into the countryside and their conflicts with peasants. In an age of increasing urban ization, when animals receded into domestication as pets and zoo spectacles, Courbet, as a privileged messenger be tween the wilderness and the city, capitalized on the tran sience and scarcity value of nature by rendering the subject of hunting that the urban audience had only limited opportu nities to experience directly. In marketing his landscape and hunting images, he set aside the scandalous subjects he nor mally chose and inevitably commodified his work, generating demand among dealers and collectors, fulfilling commissions to paint hunters' portraits and animal scenes.17 To gain visibility, he further arranged to have The Stag at Bay (Cerf ? Teau) of 1861 shown in London and Baden, both of which were frequented by large hunting parties, and to have its engraved reproductions distributed in England.18 His major hunting scenes, though, did not appeal to hunters, his target audience and, as derisively predicted by critics, failed to become mural decorations in the dining rooms of aristocratic castles and mansions.19 Instead, these works were either kept in his studio or acquired by dealers and collectors, who subsequently donated or sold them to museums. In telling contrast to Courbet's confident correspondence, his hunting scenes sublimate the hunting instinct and subdue vainglory, as if words alone were inadequate to express his deep-seated emotions. Do his unutterable sentiments express what Champfleury called "a disinterested love of nature," as shown in his admirable representation of animals and the natural environment?20 It is questionable that Courbet's re lation with nature was a disinterested one, characterized by pure aesthetic appreciation or scientific observation, and whether that is incompatible with his ethical, instrumental, and appetitive interests in nature and the cruelty, violence, and even sadomasochism implied in some of his hunting scenes. Yet if what Courbet feels for nature is love, it is impor tant to inquire as to the mode of connection between the human and the animal, and what this love has to do with desire, power, identity, and death. A dialectic of life and death runs through the uncanny process Courbet employed to picture animals in hunting scenes and game pieces. He took pride in his "mathematically precise" rendering of the animals' anatomy, habit, and move ment, consciously eschewing the dramatization and senti mentality found in the works of Horace Vernet and Sir Edwin Landseer.21 To achieve naturalism, Courbet resorted to mak ing sketches after carcasses from the hunt, the butcher's store, and taxidermy, which he equated with art.22 However, this process called for a compelling intimacy between the artist and the animals' bodies, involving gutting, skinning, dismemberment, rearticulation, and manipulation to realize certain poses and expressions. To commemorate the cap tured game, taxidermy and painting together erased the marks left by the killing, restoring the animal's beauty and vivacity. The creative practice enabled the artist to retrace his memories and reconstruct his encounters with the animals to which he attached significance. This renders Courbet's hunt ing scenes an extension of the death ceremony in a more poignant sense than the previous paintings that dealt with human death, including Burial at Omans and Dressing for the Dead Girl. While the hunting imagery was designed to be publicly exhibited and sold in modern capitalist culture, it retained a ritual implication that became particularly mani fest in the process of vividly reenacting the quarry's struggle, appearance, and spirit. Beyond the Spirit of the Chase Courbet's first life-size hunting scene, The Quarry: Deer Hunt in the Forests of the Grand Jura (La curee: Chasse au chevreuil dans les forets du Grand Jura, Fig. 4), exhibited at the Salon of 1857, won admiration for its technical and formal qualities of com position but caused confusion and invited criticism for its enigmatic and subdued treatment of the subject. Courbet placed less emphasis on giving matter-of-fact testimony re garding the climactic moment of the hunt than on evoking daydreams and thoughts in the wake of cruel violence in the depths of the pine forest. He visualized a pristine nature, unspoiled by tourism and industrialization, accessible only to native hunters. The title gives the landscape an emphatically local, cartographic specificity, and the French term la curee points to the long venery tradition dating back to the Middle Ages. It refers to the ceremonial feeding of the slain animal's entrails to the hounds, an act regarded by the French as the peak of a hunt.

The</page><page sequence="5">222 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 2 hunter, identified as Courbet himself,23 stands with arms folded, smoking a pipe, engrossed in musing and reverie, emotionally detached from the success of his pursuit. His gun hangs beside him, but the carving knife cannot be seen. The hornsman, who ought to blow a fanfare to announce the desired conclusion and increase the excitement, seems in stead to sound a dirge for the repose of the dead. The hounds, having received no signal to proceed with their anticipated devouring of the entrails, appear strangely hesi tant and restrained. As a whole, death is marked but not celebrated. Through resistance to enacting the gory ritual, the expected fury and disorder are mastered and controlled. The Quarry received mixed reviews at the Salon. On the one hand, it counterbalanced the adverse reception of another Courbet submission at the same Salon, Demoiselles on the Bank of the Seine, and established Courbet's reputation as a master in landscape and animal paintings. Commentators ap plauded The Quarry for its superb painterly quality, firm draw ing, and fresh tonality, and even those critics formerly hostile to him welcomed the artist's venture into this new and "cor rect" domain. Louis Enault considered the work the best that the artist had ever created.24 Jean Rousseau affirmed it to be as rich as works by Narcisse de la Pena Diaz and as simple as those by Constant Troyon, hence incorporating Courbet into the more acceptable and decorous Barbizon school.25 The Romantic poet Theophile Gautier commended the veracity, force, and breadth in the marvelous execution of the deer.26 On the other hand, the mysterious darkness and the figures' inertness perplexed the critics. Castagnary complained that the charcoal black tone in the middle ground was inexplica ble.27 Armand Bartlet, a Besancon-based critic, voiced his puzzlement about the two figures' lack of concern with the curee that should have engaged their full attention: His figures disturb me. One is arched against a pine tree, smoking his pipe with his back turned to the scene that should interest him. He sleeps gently in an indifference that I hardly understand at the moment of a curee chaude. The other, his cheeks puffed out in an effort to play an impossible fanfare, sleeps like his master, to whom he also turns his back.28 When the painting entered an American collection in 1866, a critic in Boston similarly disparaged the two men's oblivi ousness to the scene: The man leaning against the tree does not look as if he had the least idea why he should be there, and the dog boy with the great brass horn suggests rather the tuning up process in an orchestra than anything associated with the spirit of the chase.29 "The spirit of the chase" is precisely the essential quality that Courbet valued in a truly laudable hunter. That spirit embraced an experience or quality touching on physical vigor and mental intensity, and it is evidently downplayed in this pictorial representation. Courbet found the spirit of the hunt in the chase rather than the kill, as he wrote in a note prepared for the publication of an illustrated history of hunt ing in the Jura: "The abundance of game is not necessary for those hunters who have the spirit of the hunt. A hare will be sufficient to provide the setting and arouse the excitement of the pursuit."30 The spirit of the hunt is a hallmark of the true hunter, espoused by influential hunting literature. For exam ple, Elzear Blaze, a renowned captain under Napoleon I and an author of many best-selling hunting manuals, wrote the physiognomic essay "The Hunter" for the popular compen dium The Frenchmen Painted by Themselves, in which he ob served the diffusion and destabilization of proper hunting techniques and etiquette in the current vogue of bourgeois hunting. Blaze classified French hunters into three types: the true hunter, who displayed apt behavior, attire, and an en during hunting spirit; the fashionable hunter, who indulged himself in costume and appearance to please women; and the grocer-hunter, who killed a large quantity of game animals for profit. Courbet's remark suggests his thoughts were akin to Blaze's definition of the "true hunter," who hunts to deploy his body and talent and to enjoy the thrill of pursuit and combat, rather than merely acquiring the final victory and trophy.31 Since the phrase "spirit of the chase" connotes the excite ment, tenacity, and concentration of a worthy hunter, a successful pictorial translation of the spirit requires the ele ments of movement, energy, and drama. This is evident in a special review in the Journal des Chasseurs?the most popular field sports magazine of nineteenth-century France?of hunting pictures by some twenty artists who exhibited at the same Salon. The hunter-commentator Eugene Forest repeat edly used the following turns of phrases to describe hunting scenes with excellent qualities: "savage [savage]" "rage and energy [rage et entrain]" "full of movement [pleine de mouve ment]," "power of color [puissance de couleur]," "picturesque costume [costume pittoresque]." Courbet's entry, The Quarry, failed to appeal to Forest's taste, as he considered the figure of the hunter too dark and the atmosphere too gloomy.32 Forest's judgment and rhetoric denoted the prevailing norms in criticism governing hunting imagery and reflected the expectations of the journal's readership when it came to renderings of their favorite sport. Lacking the hunting spirit, Courbet's painting thus generated new meanings for a dif ferent audience that exceeded the boundary of a mainstream hunting magazine. It allowed for an integration of aesthetic contemplation and an experience of psychic repose. Perhaps this is why The Quarry, instead of being commissioned or purchased by any hunter, was later acquired by the art dealers Van Isachers and Jules Luquet and then sold to the Allston Club, founded by William Morris Hunt in Boston in 1866.33 Courbet's reinterpretation of the curee episode is antithet ical to the typical depictions of the subject, exemplified in Jadin's paintings, designed for the dining rooms of the due d'Orleans's residence at the Tuileries Palace and the apart ments of Napoleon III at the Louvre (Fig. 2). These imperial hunting scenes emphasize the sumptuous ritual attended by energetic huntsmen, the royal entourage, and a pack of voracious hounds. In contrast to such spectacular climaxes of royal hunts, Courbet's painting activates a prolonged mo ment of subjective reflection. The hunter's reluctance to perform the curee, his pipe smoking and reverie evoke a state of mind that differs radically from the enthusiasm of true veneurs. Consistently, Courbet's early subject is the contem plative hunter in repose following the action of the hunt.

Contesting Imperial Venery The studied discrepancy between Courbet's painting and its title reflects the artist's experimentation with the divergence between visual image and linguistic sign by exploiting its suggestive force. On several occasions, Courbet appropriated the traditional terminology of imperial venery for the tides of his paintings: curee, hallali (kill), chasse ? courre (chase hunting or running chase: using dogs and horses to chase animals to exhaustion). This tiding tactic speaks to his knowledge of the royal hunt and the public's familiarity with the terminology. With figures acting outside the conventional script, however, the paintings frustrate the viewer's expectation and operate to divest the sport of its aristocratic aura and disrupt the prescribed rules and sequence. Established elaborate proce dures make clear that for the nobility, hunting served as a combination of practice warfare and leisure activity. That Courbet reworked traditional terminology and motifs in his representations of rural hunting may be read as an attempt to claim hunting rights for the provinces. Throughout eigh teenth-century Europe, hunting rights were closely guarded by the gentry and contested by the peasantry, and poaching (braconnage) constituted a prevalent form of social protest. After the French Revolution, the hunting privileges of the noble elite were abolished along with other aspects of feu dalism, and poaching was redefined as a property crime. The state designed a permit system in the 1830s to combat the problem and, in May 1844, with the preservation of game in view, prohibited commoners and aristocracy from hunting when the ground was covered with snow.35 Nonetheless, in rural areas like the Jura Mountains, poaching, regarded as a legitimate activity, was carried out on a vast scale in spite of state surveillance and penalties, because hunting fulfilled important dietary, economic, and social functions for local populations.36 Courbet himself showed scant regard for the law, frequently poaching or taking poaching as the subject of his paintings, and his emphatic insistence on independence from the government remained a central part of his artistic and political stance. Courbet's critical distance from imperial hunting practice may be discerned in his earlier manifesto painting The Studio of the Painter: A Real Allegory Summing Up Seven Years of My Artistic Life (Fig. 5). According to Klaus Herding, Courbet advocates a natural vision in the center of the composition as a promise of social reconciliation and regeneration and, on the occasion of the Exposition Universelle, enacts an exhor tation to Napoleon III, who is present in the guise of a hunter, alluding to his passion for the hunt and his political nickname "poacher."37 The prominent emperor-hunter, with his rifle and elegant hounds, was thereby relegated to what Courbet referred to as "the world of trivial life, the people, misery, poverty, wealth, the exploited and the exploiters, and the people who live off of death,"38 as opposed to the realm of those cultural producers and art supporters who live on life, found on the right side of the canvas. To enhance their social supremacy and retain the lineage of the ancien regime, the court of Napoleon III was keen on the revival of the imperial venery in forest reserves, the keeping of records of kills, the advancement of arms, and the collection of tro phies.39 As if to counteract the presence of the emperor hunter, Courbet portrays himself in an Assyrian beard that bespeaks the noted hunting prowess of the kings of Nineveh and Nimrud. By painting a native landscape, Courbet stressed his affective bond with his hometown and proffered the pristine natural environment as a site of liberty and renewal. His hunting pictures of the next decade ask how modern men might be reintegrated into nature, though they are far from an idyllic arcadia devoid of internal tensions or contra dictions.</page><page sequence="7">224 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 2 6 Courbet, The Hunting Picnic, 1858, oil on canvas, 81V2 X 128 in. (207 X 325 cm). Wallraf-Richartz-Museum-Fondation Corboud, Cologne (artwork in the public domain; photograph ? the Rheinisches Bildarchiv Cologne) The Melancholy Hunter The Quarry reveals no happy harmony between humanity and the animate natural world; the hunter's dissociation with the climax and the delicate rendering of the deer's carcass point instead to sentiments of regret and guilt over the mastering of nature. Rousseau's philosophy on the redemptive force of nature inspired generations of Romantic artists and exerted an ongoing impact on intellectual concerns about midcen tury, particularly in the Franche-Comte. Scholars have dem onstrated that Rousseau's identification of the natural with the good informed Courbet's The Studio of the Painter and landscape paintings, and it was ardently followed by his friends Thore and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.40 It can be fur ther argued that Rousseau's view on animals reverberates in Courbet's hunting scenes. As a result of his natural feelings and education, Rousseau's Emile enjoys a peaceful spirit and never seeks pleasure in domination and in the suffering of animals.41 Rousseau's critique of hunting and advocacy of sympathy for the plight of animals remained a potent influ ence on the movements promoting animal protection and vegetarianism in the nineteenth century.42 Alphonse de Lamartine, one of Courbet's favorite Romantic writers,43 em braced Rousseau's compassionate attitude toward animals and devoted himself to defending animal welfare and writing humanitarian and zoophilic literature. In 1855, he published a widely circulated piece of prose entitled "La mort d'un chevreuil" (The Death of a Deer), in which he provided a detailed account of why he, as a hunter's son, resolved to abandon hunting. He further gave a dramatic reading of this text at the annual meeting of the Societe Protectrice des Animaux (Animal Protection Society) in 1855 and received a medal of honor from the society. Moved by the dying deer's tearful and soulful eyes, Lamartine expressed his remorse and questioned the morality of hunting.44 Courbet's The Quarry similarly underscores the deer's sorrowful eyes, which look out at the viewer. There appears to be an affinity be tween the painting and Lamartine's prose, although it is not certain that Courbet was acquainted with the latter. He had read Lamartine's work zealously in his college years and often met the republican writer in the hangouts of literary bohe mians, such as the Brasserie des Martyrs, during the Second Empire. In 1863, he thought of painting the impoverished Lamartine with beggar's wallet and lyre in his enigmatic Source of Hippocrene, which he foretold would be an "epic painting, a serious though comical satire."45 Despite Courbet's admiration for Lamartine, he never for sook hunting; as he continued his commitment to the sub ject, however, he confronted its aftereffects. The mood of melancholy and mystery and the beautiful body and eyes of a dead deer reappear in Courbet's sizable painting The Hunting Picnic, of 1858 (Fig. 6). The motif of the "repas de chasse" refers to the meal before or after the hunt, or between two rounds of chase, and it normally depicts a hedonistic fete galante, as shown in the royal hunting parties by such Rococo</page><page sequence="8">CONTESTED TERRAIN: GUSTAVE COURBET'S HUNTING SCENES 225 artists as Jean Francois de Troy (1679-1752), Nicolas Lancret (1690-1743), and Carle Van Loo (1705-1765) (Fig. 7). Pop ular painters of the Second Empire, like Jadin and Philippe Rousseau, emulated this mode of celebrating a cordial ambi ence and amorous liaisons in their representations of hunt ing picnics. In Courbet's version, a collective alienation and melancholy replace the high spirits and sensual delight an ticipated by the title. The pile of mixed game?deer, hare, partridge?at the lower right occupies a significant propor tion of the composition and presses forward to the viewer. It conveys the meditative meaning of nature morte and vanitas instead of serving as the object of gourmet consumption. The game animals are united in death, their flaccid bodies distin guishable from the firm bodies of the two dogs nearby, yet their proximity and the rich textures and sheens on their fur and pelt suggest an eerie threshold between sleep and death. Dogs frequently function as a liaison between the quarry and the hunter, putting into relief the different uses and catego ries of animals. The dining utensils are ready, but nobody is in the mood to enjoy the picnic, or even conversation. The two women in similarly styled sporting outfits, together with their male companions, are absorbed in the horn music and their own musings. Adding to the vague unease is the impres sion that the figures do not quite belong in their space, as if they withhold themselves from their environment as well as from one another. The pictorial arrangement evokes a ten sion between the flat surface of the canvas and the construc tion of this particular landscape, with its sunlit chalk cliffs, a clear stream, and a bright blue sky. It is not the geographic location or weather conditions so much as the psychic terri tory the figures inhabit that dominates the mood. The paint ing stands apart from long-held associations of the hunting picnic with gastronomic enjoyment and erotic adventure, featuring instead the enigmatic psychology of the individuals and the effect of musical transposition. A sense of prolonged waiting and the hunter's state of pensive absorption recur in Hunter on Horseback, Recovering the Trail, of 1864 (Fig. 8). This is another self-portrait depicting a hunter who hesitates to bring the violent sport to a conclu sion.46 The succinct composition with minimal descriptive details invites multiple readings that do not add up to any clear, definite narrative. The wintry mountain is charged with an uncanny effect of silence and solitude, intensified by the textures and tones of white and gray. The snow signals that the hunt is out of season, and the hunter is thus poaching. The title implies a horse-riding hunter who had become lost in the wild, returning to his path with the help of his horse, but the painting provides few clues to his destination, his prey, or the progress of his chase. One may wonder why instead of eagerly going forward to capture the animal he has wounded, the hunter, looking melancholy, slows down and contemplates the bloodstains and hoofprints in the snow. Courbet chose to focus on an unusual moment of inhibited movement and forge a metaphoric space outside the conven tional hunting sequence. He transformed the stereotypical rustic, boorish hunter into a mourner who seeks to make peace with the wounded animal. The hunter, through affec tive imagination, shares the suffering and fear of the quarry, which leaves its bodily traces on the snow and haunts the landscape. By an exceptional economy of means, in the ab sence of the game, hounds, weapon, and action, the painting maps the psychology of hunting at the temporal arrest of the anticipation of death and deferred satisfaction. The intro spective self-image utterly diverges from Courbet's bombastic letters, which dwell on his elation and triumph in the chase and the anatomical and ballistic analysis of the kill.47 Instead of straightforwardly documenting a hunt, art fulfills the work of mourning as an imaginary reparation and reconciliation. The elegiac quality of the painting corresponds to a curi ous passage in Courbet's notes for the aborted project of an illustrated history of rural hunting, wherein he mused, "The hunter is a man of independent character, who has a free mind or at least the sentiment of freedom. He is a wounded soul, with a heart that nurses his languor in the vagueness and melancholy of the forest."48 Leaving aside the common biological and cultural defenses of hunting, these words re veal a subjectivity very different from that of most hunters, of whom Elzear Blaze, in his article "The Hunter," identified three main types. Courbet argued that hunting is an activity liberated from social constraints and symbolic domination. The hunter merges with Courbet's self-image of an indepen dent artist who lives the life of an inner exile and savors freedom, idleness, and daydreams in the natural wilderness. He resembles a Romantic noble half savage, a poet with a gun, roaming the forest and brimming with bittersweet long ings. But the hunter's inclination toward languor and idle ness is something that venery authorities, such as the influ ential medieval Count Gaston Phebus (1331-1391), had long denounced.49 In fact, from Plato to Xenophon and Robert Burton (1577-1640), hunting has been recommended to enhance men's pleasure and health and to combat idleness and cure melancholy.50 The noted naturalist comte de Buf fon (1707-1788) also claimed hunting as the only amuse ment capable of providing complete diversion from work and vivacious pleasure without causing languor or satiation.51 7 Carle Van Loo, A Halt during the Hunt, 1737, oil on canvas, 865/s X 983/s in.

Watson Webb and Electra Havemeyer Webb (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by Yale University Art Gallery/ Art Resource, NY) Courbet's conception of the hunter deviates from main stream opinions on the invigorating and recreational benefits of the hunt, gravitating toward a torpid and melancholy state. In his writings, Courbet displays ambivalence about the rationale for hunting. On the one hand, he celebrated hunt ing as a national heritage and a natural way for men to make use of their talent, instinct, and energy.52 On the other hand, by depicting the hunter as a wounded soul, Courbet pre sented him as a traumatized victim rather than an agent of violence and aggression. His lack of vitality and interest ap proaches the state of renunciation and self-denigration in flicted by melancholia. Sigmund Freud described melancho lia as "an open wound," an internalization of and identifica tion with the loss of a loved object, a pathological mourn ing.53 The sense of self for the hunter, as for Freud's melan cholic, can be characterized by a convoluted and ongoing negotiation with pain and loss. The downcast hunter, more over, who perceives the animate and inanimate aspects of the natural world is conflated with the long-standing trope of the melancholy artist who claims genius, creativity, and a pro found insight into the essence of things and the universe. In nineteenth-century France, hunting was considered a rite of passage to manhood, important for character building, physical training, and a gendeman's education.54 Rather than portraying the embodiment of invulnerable manhood?a masculinity courageously asserting itself in the face of grave challenge and danger?The Quarry and Hunter on Horseback dispel the masculine mystique of virile robustness, leaving behind the external image of the hunter in order to recover the interior self. Manhood was for Courbet a fraught and fragile aspiration rather than an accomplished fact.55 Already in early works like The Man with a Leather Belt, The Cellist, and The Wounded Man, his self-portraits express a sensitive and introspective persona. Courbet appeared in diverse roles in his paintings, affirming both his uniqueness and the mobility of the self. These multifarious self-portraits represent contin gent and competing conceptions of masculinity and trace the intersection of subjectivity and social reality in a retrospective</page><page sequence="10">9 Courbet, After the Hunt, ca. 1859, oil on canvas, 93 X 7SV4 in.

He called them an "autobiography" subject to his changing attitudes.56 Inaugurated by Rousseau's Confessions as a project of self-revelation and self-justification, modern autobiography often involves omission and interpretation, situated somewhere between real events and embellishments of memory and imagination. Through painting in the con fessional mode, art exonerates and redeems the artist; it unburdens him of his wrongs and promises him liberation. Courbet's hunting imagery can be seen as inheriting the traditional function of confession that offers emancipatory and transformative agency. Similarly, the prehistoric cave paintings in Lascaux, as Georges Bataille interpreted them, were conduits of the hunter-painter's confession and his attempt to communicate with the wounded animals. In ad dressing the animal, the human predator asks forgiveness from the slain animal in order to relieve his remorse when next he hunts.57 One of the most striking innovations of Courbet's hunting series is its adoption of a variety of forms of expression to convey the protean quality of his engagement with the natu ral world. In his extended essay on hunters' reactions to the deaths of animals, Courbet described the asymmetrical power relations between hunters and their quarries, which arouse complex feelings of fear, sadism, and empathy. In After the Hunt (Fig. 9), a composition of a forest interior similar to The Quarry, a fashionable hunter with vibrant blond hair smilingly raises a dead fox as a plaything with which to tease the hounds and reinforce their aggressive instincts, yet the whip in his right hand may be used to restrain them. This mischie vous act, not without a macabre sense of humor, simulta neously assuages any disquiet about mortality induced by the haunted, claustrophobic woods. With his delight and his association with the royal hunt, as suggested by his tight and colorful costume, the youth constitutes an exception in Cour bet's hunting series. The proximity of living and dead ani mals?boar, deer, hare, partridge, fox?evokes a liminal state between sentience and insentience.

Musee des Beaux Arts, Lons-le-Saunier, no. 188, gift of Jean-Paul Mazaroz, 1886 (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Jean-Loup Mathieu, studio Eureka) docile, sagging body, demonstrates the conflict between spe cies and offers a defense of hunting on the basis of instinct. Placed within touching distance, the abundant items of game put on display, painted with forceful effects of modeling and foreshortening, vie with one another for the viewer's atten tion. Their tangible immediacy makes it hard to discriminate among the different animal bodies and presents an unset tling viewing experience.58 Trope of the Noble Stag Courbet initiated a series of paintings centering on the stag's suffering, struggle, and death with The German Huntsman (Fig. 10), whose title alludes to his hunting experience in Frankfurt in 1858. It was one of fourteen paintings exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Besancon in 1860 and sold to Jean-Paul Mazaroz. An industrial sculptor, furniture maker, and art collector in the Franche-Comte, Mazaroz shared with the artist a political radicalism tinged with Fourierism, Charles Fourier's Utopian socialism that proposed the liber ation of human passions and a community of joyous labor.59 The composition gives a strong sense of the close-up and obtrusive presence of the hunter and stag near a stream in the forest. It illuminates the facts that hunting is a deliberate, direct, and violent killing of wild animals and that the hunter is an armed yet liminal figure who stands on the very bound ary between the human domain and the wilderness. The viewer is compelled to take account of the dramatic confron tation in which the hunter feels awestruck by the quarry's glistening eyes, formidable defenses, and noble agony. The stag's majestic body is turned upside down in an abject state that makes its gasping face and antlers?souvenirs of victory and emblems of maleness?even more prominent. It is a moment of intersubjective recognition wherein the animal can function for the hunter as both alter ego and inevitable other. Courbet accentuates the suffering of the animal and endows it with quasi-human heroism and martyrdom. Courbet's recurrent choice of the stag as hero resonates with historical and allegorical meanings, elevating the hunt ing genre to the status of a grand history painting. He depicts the stag's sexuality and combats during the rutting season in the epic canvas Battle of the Stags (also known as The Spring Rut), which he thought should have had the same impact as Burial at Omans.60 He portrays the stag's inconsolable woe at the end of a six-hour chasse ? courre in The Stag at Bay. Both of these paintings received unprecedented, unanimous admira tion at the Salon of 1861 for their masterful rendering of the magnificent animals and somber landscape. The symbolic elevation of deer to noble status, which derived in part from the heightened restriction of deer-hunting privileges to the aristocracy, exerted a powerful influence on Western atti tudes toward hunting. In Phebus's Le livre de chasse (The Book of the Hunt), stag hunting is upheld as the noblest form of hunt, for in it, the art of hunting finds its best expression.61 The comte de Buffon praised the stag hunt as a model of physical exercise and courage building, supportive of military training.62 Many hunting manuals have endowed the stag with strength, cunning, and valor, making it a worthy antag onist and ideal quarry. Before the French Revolution, the hunting of stags and other large game was a guarded feudal prerogative. Courbet's initiation into the formalized pursuit of the stag took place when he was invited to participate in aristocratic hunts in Frankfurt and Rambouillet. His paint ings, however, undermined the courtly and military over tones of the stag hunt and stressed the landscape of the Jura as the setting for the tragic fall of the prey. Courbet addressed the social and psychic realities of con temporary rural hunting practice in the context of the long held literary and artistic conventions of the stag. For many devoted hunters, stag hunting connotes something larger and more mysterious than merely the pursuit of food and pleasure. The stag's antlers, which are annually shed and regrown, give rise to the creature's symbolic association with rebirth, rejuvenation, and male sexual potency in general.63 The iconography of the stag, moreover, can be traced back to</page><page sequence="12">CONTESTED TERRAIN: GUSTAVE COURBET'S HUNTING SCENES 229 Christian art, which tells the stories of Saints Eustace and Hubert, who were converted while hunting on meeting a stag with a crucifix hovering between its antlers. In medieval and Renaissance allegory, the stag was symbolic of prudence, swiftness, longevity, renewal, and love.64 English and German Romantic poets used the uncanny-looking white deer as a metaphor to summon otherworldliness, transcendence, and romance.65 For Courbet, the stag is probably overlaid with some of these positive qualities transmitted through centuries of cultural history. He sought to rework traditional allegories into modern history paintings, grounded in his concrete experience, situated knowledge, and current social attitudes toward animals and hunting. Natural History and the Animal Protection Movement Courbet's revision of the hunting genre was tied to the discourse of republican-inflected and evolutionary natural history and the conflict between ideologies supportive of either hunting or animal protection. As Courbet's landscape paintings are informed by the naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's transformisme, which stressed the dynamic and continual change of nature,66 his view of animals may imply his concurrence with Lamarck's progressive zoology, which was popular at the time, especially in republican circles. Radical in his exclusion of religion and metaphysics, Lamarck argued that human be ings were merely one species among the many that nature had produced and that instinct and intelligence were shared by both humans and animals. In his Philosophie zoologique (Zoological Philosophy) of 1809 Lamarck contended that environment affected the shape and biological makeup of animals and that each species acquired new habits and a more complicated organic structure in response to changing circumstances.67 Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, written in 1859, was translated into French by Clemence Royer in 1862, and the impact of Darwinism was largely accommo dated within the native French Lamarckian tradition. Darwin thought that the process of natural selection, without divine planning, could have brought about the evolution of all organisms from a few ancestral forms toward corporeal and mental perfection.68 In The Descent of Man and The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals, Darwin conceded that forms of subjectivity and emotional intelligence were present in both humans and animals. Nonetheless, he continued to shoot animals for sport, revealing a competitive and hier archical conception of nature. Unfortunately, the Darwin ian vision later served to justify European imperialism and the mythic stereotype of the "Great White Hunter" in the colonies.69 In the mid-nineteenth century, writing natural history was a means of writing metaphorically about society, its problems and its hopes. Significant texts by socialist Utopian and hunt ing enthusiast Alphonse Toussenel (1803-1885) and the re publican historian Jules Michelet (1798-1874) probably con tributed to shaping Courbet's vision of animals in relation to the human condition. Toussenel, who frequented a literary and artistic group at Bougival whose members included Courbet, Camille Corot, and Henri Murger, authored the book L esprit des betes: Venerie francaise et Zoologie passionnelle (The Spirit of Animals: French Venery and Passionate Zool ogy), which was widely read and appreciated by the carica turist J.-J. Grandville and writers like Gautier and Charles Baudelaire. He described the habitat, diet, and behavior of a given species and assessed its value in the eyes of a committed hunter. Then he applied the Fourierist idea of universal analogy, which regarded animals and humans alike as mani festations of the divine message, and interpreted the animals as symbols of human vice and virtue: for example, the stag embodied loyalty, the pig avarice. Thus, he classified animals in terms of moral qualities and objected to received forms of taxonomy.70 His treatise on hunting and its problems, Tristia: Histoire des miseres et des fleaux de la chasse de France (Sadness: History of Miseries and Plagues of Hunting in France), insists that hunting was a man's natural right and heroic act but criticizes contemporary hunting as a debased middle-class pastime, a commercial and industrial activity, too full of carnage and without mercy. A true hunter, he contends, understands and respects his quarry.71 An admirer of Toussenel, Michelet went further, combining the field of natural history with animal welfare concerns, republican pol itics, and evolutionary science. In Lepeuple (The People), the best-known piece of French Romantic zoophilia, he held that animals were victims of oppression who merited justice, not simply pity.72 The goal of history and nature alike is the realization of universal peace and harmony among classes and species. He wrote in Uoiseau (The Bird), "All the living species, each in its humble right, came knocking at the door and claiming admittance to the bosom of democracy."73 Michelet supported the Societe Protectrice des Animaux and urged the public to restore a primordial pact with animals and to abandon the destruction of innocent creatures for pleasure. By the mid-nineteenth century, public opinion was grow ing intolerant of animal abuse, and animal protection was on its way to becoming accepted as prevailing thought. The Societe Protectrice des Animaux, founded under the leader ship of Dr. Etienne Pariser in 1845, worked on the civilizing goal of reforming popular attitudes toward animals and suc cessfully promoted the enactment of the Grammont law in 1850, which outlawed acts of cruelty toward domestic animals in public.74 In 1855, its Bulletin de Societe Protectrice des Animaux published antihunting prose by Lamartine. In 1867, the so ciety's bulletin contained an essay on the Salon paintings entided "Les animaux aux Salons de peinture," which de plored the lack of any treatment by the visual arts of the theme of animal welfare, when that cause had inspired many literary works. Nonetheless, as Elisabeth Hardouin-Fugier in dicated, visual representations of animal suffering were con sidered a cultural taboo and a drawback in the art market at the time.75 From 1864 on, the number of architects (Charles Jules Sedille, Paul Sedille, Laforge, Francois Thierry-La grange), painters (Leon Cogniet, Mme Noggerath, Mme de Requin), photographers (Nadar), and sculptors (F. Louat) who joined the society steadily increased. However, a com mitment to animal protection was not synonymous with op position to hunting, for the humane society's members in cluded Rosa Bonheur, animal painter and avid huntress, and Jules Gerard, the noted "killer of lions [tueur de lions]."76 Probably because of the social prestige of hunters, polemics against hunting were generally inhibited in comparison with those against the abuse of animals.</page><page sequence="13">230 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 2 11 Courbet, The Death of the Stag, Episode of Chase Hunting in a Snozvy Terrain, 1867, oil on canvas, 11 ft. 7SA in. X 16 ft. 6% in. (3.55 X 5.05 m). Musee des Beaux-Arts et d'Archeologie, Besancon (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Charles Choffet, ? Musee des Beaux-Arts et d'Archeologie, Besancon) Ethical Dilemma in Experiential Realism The paradox of the hunter's appreciation and destruction of animals and his identification with and objectification of the quarry is suggested in the sublime painting The Death of the Stag, Episode of Chase Hunting in a Snowy Terrain (Hallali du cerf, episode de chasse ? courre sur un terrain de neige, Fig. 11). It is Courbet's final major painting devoted to the hunt and the last canvas of such an imposing size in his oeuvre. Courbet had conceived the project in 1865 and believed it exerted "great artistic importance" and had a profound impact on his reputation.77 During these years he was plagued by vehement criticism of his paintings, such as Portrait of Pierre-Joseph Prou dhon in 1853 and Woman with a Parrot, and he relied on the success of his landscape and animal images to compensate for the decline in his critical and economic fortunes. A photo graph of Courbet at work on the composition shows the stag as a strange mirror image of the hunter-artist. The suffering stag, with its magnificent antlers in profile against the snowy sky, becomes the ideal opponent of the hunter and the manifestation of the human subconscious. The term hallali is an abbreviation of allez ? lui, which refers to the moment of the kill after the prey has been run down, long an exclusive right of the nobility. In his final rendition of 1867 Courbet's protagonists are the haut bourgeois?repre sented by his friends and collectors?in his native region, their social position legitimating their exercise of the classical hunt. The Ornans distiller Jules Cuisenier posed as the hunter wielding a whip to restrain the hounds, rather than blowing the horn to encourage them. His long and forceful whip is frozen in the air, and the suspense produces a strong visceral effect on the viewer. His action shows the habitual flogging involved in the training and running of dogs. The landowner and politician Felix Gaudy posed as the hunter on horseback, who watches the scene with composure and com prehension, clothed in plush animal skin as a token of his hunting feats and social status. His posture is reminiscent of the hunter in the rear of Peter Paul Rubens's Fox and Wolf Hunt and the Turkish soldier in Delacroix's Scenes from the Massacres at Chios, both of whom connote authority and severity.78 Although this debt to the renowned works of the past demonstrates that Courbet inscribed himself within an art historical continuum, the solemn atmosphere and disciplined structure of the painting decisively distance it from the vibrant coloring and chaotic melee of its Baroque and Romantic precedents. Courbet depicted both men as consummate hunters, possessing the virtues of endurance</page><page sequence="14">CONTESTED TERRAIN: GUSTAVE COURBET'S HUNTING SCENES 231 and courage and convinced that humanity holds dominion over the animals. The Romantic conception of the melan choly hunter who longs to commune with nature gives way to a superior type of hunter, an insistent defender of the elaborate hunting ritual, the strict hierarchy and bound aries of the animal kingdom. In the tactile drama of capture, Courbet paid homage to the hunted animal, whose anguish evokes sacrifice and mar tyrdom. This emphasis on the creature's noble death coun teracts the hunters' supremacy and glory and engages the viewer's moral understanding. The stag is incapable of fur ther resistance against the onslaught of the hungry hounds, but it still holds its head erect, struggling heroically at the end, even as it senses its imminent doom. The bodies of the dogs and the stag express their sensations and emotions more eloquently than the corporeal signs of the hunters. The hounds, individualized in their posture, movement, and phys iognomy, are all bony and undernourished. The composition is saturated with various pitches of voices?the chilling bellow of the prey and the excited baying of the hounds?that in tertwine with the visual, physical, and mental activity of each animal. The pristine hues of the snowy terrain dominate the pictorial field, its radiant whites executed with a flourish of the dense materiality of the paint. The setting delineates an arena for the combat between men and animals, turning the kill into a performance of aggression and torture. It is in tended to stir the viewer's sympathy for the suffering animal, fear in the face of the annihilation of life, and indignation against the chase hunting practice. The Death of the Stag proved to be the most criticized of Courbet's hunting series. Critics at the Salon of 1869 had difficulty finding words to justify the cruelty of the hunt, or even to endorse the reality of the pictorial evocation. As an avant-garde history painting, The Death of the Stag raises an ethical dilemma within the context of an aesthetic experi ence. Castagnary, an ardent hunter himself, was the only commentator who managed to praise so much as the beauty of its colors and drawing, along with its exceptional grandeur, force, and verity.79 Paul Casimir-Perier, however, denounced the distasteful, warlike turmoil in the hunting scene. He ironically described it as "the Battle of Eylau in the kennel," capable only of attracting the proud hunters and dog trainers and destined for the collections at the chateaux. He doubted the art public would be interested in a painting so deficient in poetry and thoughtfulness.80 Still other critics chided the infidelity to nature, which, they deemed, ruined the artist's reputation as a principal Realist. Charles Blanc, who had championed the revival of Desportes's and Oudry's splendid hunting pictures, claimed that nothing could be less realist than this rebarbative painting, but he gave no reason for the perceived absence of realism.81 Albert Wolff found fault with the unconvincing anatomy of the mounted hunter, who seemed to resemble a circus acrobat with extraordinary equi librium.82 Gautier, who had dealt with the subject of animal protection in his Caprices et zigzags^ and had affirmed the merits of The Quarry in 1857, denigrated The Death of the Stag as a fantasy, lacking the realism of perspective and snow effects as well as the furious movement and violent style of Rubens's epic hunts. He went on to identify the fundamental problem as an overly large canvas for the light subject of rural hunting.84 In summary, these seemingly contradictory opin ions highlight the painting's three main shortcomings: the inappropriate conflation of the grand format and the rural scene; the inadequate optical realism of the figures, perspec tive, and landscape; and the excessive experiential realism of the brute physicality of the hunt. The negative reception testifies to the infeasibility of Cour bet's initial hope that the hunting subject might become a "neutral ground where everybody agrees." In fact, after being shown at Courbet's solo exhibition in 1867 and the Salon of 1869, The Death of the Stag remained in the artist's studio until the end of his career and was not acquired by the Besancon museum until the auction of 1881. Far from an anodyne celebration of the venery tradition, its unflinching stress on animal suffering disconcerted the nonhunting audience and challenged the urban bourgeois standard of humane behav ior. Nevertheless, it is a thoughtfully crafted composition that demonstrates Courbet's experimentation with compositional structure and tonal nuances, and in it, his intense emotional investment in the subject takes on cathartic meaning. In conclusion, the hunting genre long served to glorify royal privileges and human dominance and to afford the sensual pleasures of violent spectacle. Courbet, refusing to bow to received precepts of its representation, revised the genre into a vehicle for profound self-inquiry, involving issues of gender, class, and artistic identity. Combining naturalistic, psychological, and ethical implications, his hunting pictures forged a new kind of history painting as an interchange between artistic subjectivity, lived experience, and social atti tudes toward animals. Courbet worked in a milieu in which the popularity of bourgeois sport hunting was rising and imperial venery was reviving, while the animal protection movement coalesced and the attacks on hunting and animal abuse intensified. As a nature-loving hunter and devoted republican, his heightened attention to the exterior and interior life of animals accrued associations with the evolu tionary ideas of Lamarck and Darwin, the zoophilic senti ments of Lamartine, Toussenel, and Michelet, as well as the established trope of the noble stag. In nature he found not only solace and relief but also a sphere of activity in which he, too, engaged in the cruelty and injustice of the hunt. In his art, he transformed the warlike hunt into an ambivalent tale of loss and a symptom of human depravity. His paintings and writings oscillate between complex masculine attitudes to ward nature?domination, benevolence, guilt?and longing for an intimacy with the primordial animal world. The result is a compelling art that explores how modern men both maintain an adventurous outdoor life and seek to commune on peaceful terms with animals under conditions of mutual liberty. Ultimately, the ambition, passion, and heroism of the hunt are transferred to the art of painting in its power to critique conventions, provide consolation for loss, and imag ine a better, harmonious relation between the civilized and the natural worlds.

Once under the stress of painting and organizing his solo exhibition, Courbet wished to escape from work and became "a fanatic poacher," as he confessed in a letter to Louis Francais (Ornans, February 1855), in Letters of Gustave Courbet, 135. 14. Jules Castagnary, Gustave Courbet (1882), ed. Bertrand Tillier (Paris: Sequences, 2000), 48: "Chasseur autant que peintre, il interrompit plus d'une fois l'etude commence pour saisir le fusil et abattre quelque piece au passage." 15.

Armand Bartlet, quoted in Les amis de Gustave Courbet Bulletin 30 (1962): 15: "Ses personages me genent. L'un, arcboute contre un sapin, et fumant sa pipe en tournant le dos ? la scene qui doit l'interesser, s'endort doucement dans un indifference que je ne com prends guere ? l'heure d'une curee chaude; l'autre, la joue enflee par des pretensions ? une fanfare impossible, s'endort, comme son maitre, auquel il tourne le dos ? son tour." The theme of sleep long engaged Courbet; see Aaron Sheon, "Courbet, French Realism, and the Discov ery of the Unconscious," Arts Magazine 55 (February 1981): 114-28. 29. "The French Etching Club," Round Table 32 (March 31, 1866): 199, quoted in Douglas E. Edelson, "Courbet's Reception in America before 1900," in Faunce and Nochlin, Courbet Reconsidered, 68. 30. Courbet, "Notes sur la chasse," in Courbet, raconti par lui-meme, vol. 1, 38-39: "L'abondance du gibier n'est pas tres necessaire pour des chas seurs qui ont l'esprit de la chasse. Un lievre etant donne, la mise en scene peut etre complete." In 1861, Courbet was commissioned by the publisher Furne to produce a series of articles and drawings on the "realist history of the old-time and present-day hunters of the Jura." See his letter to Max Buchon, Omans, January 1861, in Letters of Gustave Courbet, 188-89. Although the project was not actually carried out, the commission itself signaled Courbet's well-recognized impor tance as a visual and textual narrator of the hunting history of his na tive region. 31. Elzear Blaze, "Le chasseur," in Les Frangais peints par eux-meme (Paris: Curmer, 1840), vol. 1, 217-24: "The good and true hunter likes the combat more than the victory and the booty. If he hunts, it is to em ploy the activity of his legs, the resources of his genius, the dexterity of his arms, and the precision of his glance [Le bon et vrai chasseur aime le combat plus que pour la victoire et le butin. S'il chasse, c'est pour deploy er l'activite de ses jambes, les ressources de son genie, Vadresse de ses bras, lajust esse de son coup d'oeil\." Among Blaze's highly informative hunting books were the treatise on various hunting techniques and preys, Le chasseur au chien d'arret: Contenant les habitudes, les ruses du gibier, Tart de le chercher et de le tirer, le choix des armes, V education des chiens, leurs maladies, etc. (Paris, 1836); and the recounting of hunting history, Le chasseur conteur ou les chroniques de la chasse contenant des histoires, des contes, des anecdotes et par-ci par-la, quelques hableries sur la chasse depuis Charlemagne jusqu'? nos jours (1840), which were reprinted throughout the Second Empire. 32.

I reconstructed here the feelings of Gustave Courbet, going by those I experienced myself when I com pleted my classical studies in the small secondary school of my native village: we had no greater pleasure than reading Lamartine, Victor Hugo, and Alfred de Musset in secret, in the study, or while strolling [Du sortir du college, Courbet itait romantique comme I'etait d'ailleurs son ami Max Buchon, et tous les jeunes gens a 'lors. . . . Je reconstruis ici les sentiments de Gustave Courbet, d'apres ceux quej'ai iprouve moi-meme quand j'achevais mes humaniVes dans le petit college de ma ville natale: nous n 'avions pas de plus grand plaisir que de lire Lamartine, Victor Hugo, Alfred de Musset, en cachette, ? I etude ou ? la promenade]." 44. Alphonse de Lamartine, "La mort d'un chevreuil," Bulletin de Soci&amp;te Protectrice des Animaux 1 (1855): 236: "When the smoke of my gun dis persed, pale and trembling, I confronted my crime. The poor charm ing animal was not dead. He looked at me, his head resting on the grass, his eyes swimming with tears. I will never forget that look to which surprise and pain, the unexpectedness of death, appeared to give the profundity of human sentiment, as intelligible as words; for the soul speaks through the eyes, especially as it dies"; quoted in Kath leen Kete, The Beast in the Boudoir: Petkeeping in Nineteenth-Century Paris (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994), 24. 45. Courbet had begun painting Source of Hippocrene but it remained unfin ished and was destroyed. See Courbet's letter to Castagnary, Ornans, January 16-18, 1864, in Letters of Gustave Courbet, 235-36.

Courbet, "Notes sur la chasse," 39: "Le chasseur est un homme d'un caractere independant qui a 1'esprit libre ou du moins le sentiment de la liberte.

The painting was once shown at an exhibition in Saintes in 1863, orga nized by Etienne Baudry, Courbet's collector and host, and its first owner was alternately described as Baudry or Phoedora Gaudin, repub lican lawyer and politician, before it entered the H. O. Havemeyer col lection in New York in the late 1880s. Robert Fernier, La vie et Voeuvre de Gustave Courbet: Catalogue raisonne, 2 vols. (Lausanne: Bibliotheque des Arts, 1977), vol. 1, no. 342, lists Gaudin as the painting's first owner. Sarah Faunce, Courbet Reconsidered, 137, believes that the paint ing belonged to Etienne Baudry because it was shown in the exhibition organized by Baudry in 1863. 59.

Courbet to Buchon, Omans, January 1865, and two letters to Gustave Chaudey, Ornans, February-March 1867, in Letters of Gustave Courbet, 254, 305-6. 78. On Courbet's borrowing of Delacroix's Turkish rider, scholars have voiced different opinions. Linda Nochlin considered it unnecessary to read a social meaning into the borrowing and even the painting itself; see her "Gustave Courbet's 'Meeting': A Portrait of the Artist as a Wan dering Jew," Art Bulletin 49 (1967): 213. Herding, To Venture Indepen dence, 88, interpreted the borrowing as Courbet's appeal for indepen dence and a protest against Bonapartism. I think that both statements need more substantial support, that in this painting Courbet revealed both his debt to the artistic tradition and his attempt to innovate within it, as his hunter differs greatly from the image of the Turkish soldier in stylistic and semantic aspects. For discussions of the hunting scenes by Rubens and Delacroix, see Susan Koslow, "Law and Order in Rubens's Wolf and Fox Hunt," Art Bulletin 78 (December 1996): 680 706; and Eve Twose Kliman, "Delacroix's Lions and Tigers: A Link be tween Man and Nature," Art Bulletin 64 (September 1982): 446-66. 79.
