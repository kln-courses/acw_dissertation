<plain_text><page sequence="1">Zayde Antrim. Routes and Realms: The Power of Place in the Early Islamic World. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012.212 pages; acknowledgments; note on translations, transliterations, and dates; glossary; notes; bibliography; index. Cloth US$65.00 ISBN 978-0-1999-1387-9. This book is a compilation of previously published articles and talks, as Antrim's entry on the faculty page of Trinity College, Hartford, CT reveals. It consists of an introduction and three chapters (homeland, cities, regions). The book purports to establish that there was a "discourse of place" in a broad range of texts and a more limited range of maps that were produced, mostly in Arabic, during the first centuries of the Abbasid dynasty. In its three chapters the author extracts anthologies, historical chronicles, and geographical works, to which she has added the occasional travel account, astronomical work, and religious treatise (2). These brief extracts are joined in the form of quotes and summaries to an easy-flowing combination of reformulated opinions and interpretations of previous researchers. The author's own contributions seem to consist in the usage of a relatively limited vocabulary of current academic jargon like crafting, performing, constructing, imagining, invoking, evoking, body, discourse, strategy, nurture, and the like; the erasure of differences between genres, skills, beliefs, and values that, according to more traditional approaches to historical analysis, characterize poetry, historical writing, mathematical texts, and the styles and models of descriptive versus mathematical geography; the avoidance of analysis of the various sources, which she mined for the alleged discourse of place; and the thorough abstention from contextualization of authors, copyists, and other actors, their works, and the traces they left behind. While other reviewers may emphasize strengths they find in the book, I find too many problems stand in my way of doing so. Antrim does not explain why she chose the period from the ninth to the eleventh centuries for her 62</page><page sequence="2">MESA i ROMES I481&amp;2 i 2014 claims that there was a "discourse of place" and that "place had power" (l). All she offers is the statement that "the discourse of place is a conceptual framework," which she uses "to bring together a wide variety of formal texts committed to the representation of territory in and of itself, rather than as a setting or backdrop of something else" (l). She declares that such a discourse existed by attributing "land," as used in the chosen texts as a stimulation of "geographical imagination," with the capacity to act "as a powerful vehicle for articulating desire, claiming authority, and establishing belonging" (l). Such a declaration is, however, not a proof that there was indeed such a thing as a discourse of place nor an analysis of why that was the case and how this discourse functioned on the three claimed levels of homeland, city, and region or world, for achieving the proclaimed goals (desire, authority, identity). For example, Antrim suggests that the supposed discourse of place is merely "a representation of territory," or the manner in which "Muslims imagined the territory where they lived and traveled"(6). That a geographical text deals with places in spaces does not signify that this was a discourse beyond and above being merely the appropriate choice of words for representing geographical knowledge. That there was a special type of poetry that evoked nostalgia for things (animals, foods, plants, rivers, humans, etc.) that were left behind due to a nomadic lifestyle, other kinds of real or imagined travel, or marriage (which rarely used the plural word awtan) does not prove, without further substantiation, that there was a "discourse of homeland." The author states herself that the word also had extraterritorial connotations (11-29, in particular 14). Moreover, the author admits that the term awtan mostly appears in titles and headers of chapters but rarely in the text proper, where a variety of other terms are used (15-16). The highly anthropomorphic and zoomorphic language of this discourse of place as "homeland" and its many references to themes of childhood and adolescence, as nicely brought out by the author, necessitates arguments, preferably from anthropology, for their use as evidence that it was indeed place as territoriality that was at stake in these poems. This is, however, not delivered by Antrim (17-19). The first chapter on awtan does not even convince me that the term signified homeland, a concept that sounds conspicuously modern. Antrim's explanations of why she excluded certain types of texts, for instance biographies, are problematic. This decision reflects a lack of familiarity with the multitude of manners in which biographies were composed as complex, multi-leveled narratives. Furthermore, chapter 3 shows that the author did not understand very well the technicalities of the texts she worked with. One major problem consists in her usage of older types of scholarly literature whose authors did not share her postmodernist leanings. Another difficulty 63</page><page sequence="3">MESA I R 0 M E S I 48 1&amp;2 I 2014 is that there was never something like "human geography" recognized as a member of the family of scholarly disciplines described in classifications of the "sciences," often called aqsam al-culum, nor did it flourish (only or particularly) from the ninth to the eleventh centuries (88). All three chapters contain many mistakes, exaggerations, or empty rhetorical constructions that cannot be analyzed here. Sonja Brentjes Max Planck Institute</page></plain_text>
