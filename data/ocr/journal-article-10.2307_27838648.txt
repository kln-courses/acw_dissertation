<plain_text><page sequence="1">Deterrents and Reinforcement by D. H. Lawrence and L. Festtnger; 180 pages; $4.75; Stanford University Press, 1962. This is an unusual book. The authors attempt to extend (if that is the appro priate word) Festinger's theory of dis sonance to include the behavior of the laboratory rat in situations involving partial reinforcement, delay of reinforce ment, and effortfulness of response. The obvious perils of anthropomorphism are unabashedly, even cheerfully, met head on. Statements like "... during the two days on which the animals were not run in the apparatus, an attempt was made to communicate to them that food was no longer available in the end box" startle the reader, until he learns, in the next sentence, that nothing more radical than latent extinction is being described. No book, this, for the fastid ious epistemologist, or fussy first-year graduate student. But it is a work which, by its very disregard for academic shibboleth, stimulates the reader to thought; and this, of course, is a high accomplishment indeed. The first chapter is devoted to a brief overview of what is termed an "impasse" for learning theory; namely, the ob served enhancement of resistance to extinction following acquisition under the three conditions referred to in the foregoing. The explanatory attempts of Humphreys, Sheffield, Estes, Logan, and Amsel are examined, and found to be lacking. The second chapter pre sents the theory of dissonance, argues its generality, and suggests means whereby the adequacy of this theory can be tested. The next five chapters describe some sixteen experiments bearing upon this issue, and the last chapter provides an appraisal of the theory's sufficiency, Stable to 0.01% ..

The writers are candid enough to confess to various . . difficulties and ambiguities that exist in the theory and data we have presented." On the positive side, they also believe that they have presented several new findings. The subjects used in the research reported notwithstanding, the origin of the theory as well as the account of research bearing upon it are such as to lead this reviewer to believe that Lawrence and Festinger's formulation will be accorded a more sympathetic reception by social psychologists than by animal learning theorists.?J.
