<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daniel Sylvester Tuttle. Reminiscences of a Missionary Bishop. New York: Thomas Whittaker, 1906. Reprinted, May, 1977. The Helena Letter Shop, Helena, Montana, 59601. We owe much to the Diocese of Montana for reprinting a book and mak- ing it available in an inexpensive edition for the many who may have heard of Bishop Tuttle, but did not know him. He died in 1923. As he noted in his foreward he began the book in 1889, in his third year in Missouri and his 22nd as a bishop. He completed it in 1904. Elected a bishop before he was thirty he was to live to serve an episcopate of fifty-six years, the last twenty of which saw him also as the Presiding Bishop. "Reminiscences" has it all - from his early schooling through his ordination and marriage, his 19 years in Montana, Utah and Idaho, to his move to Missouri in 1886. There are cowboys and Indians, gold miners, stage coaches and steamboats, poor people and rich, Christians, non-believers and Mormons. There is a whole chapter on what he calls the anthropomorphic theology of the Latter Day Saints. Firm in his opposition to this sect, he recognized its strength and advocated it be met with reason, argument, education, enlightenment, influence and persuasive truth. While the "Reminiscences" ends with Tuttle's second call to Missouri in</page><page sequence="2">284 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE 1886 (he had been previously elected in 1868 but wished not to leave the missionary field then) the Bishop records the death of his beloved Harriet in 1899 while he was confirming in Boise, Idaho, then without a bishop. Like most Memoirs "Reminiscences" is a pot pouri of items. Several pages are devoted to parish administration with advice that would be helpful to many younger (and older) parish clergy today. The interesting story of his election to the episcopate first appeared in this book: how the two bishops who informed him of his election told him the field was Nevada, whereas the House of Bishops had elected him for work in Montana and Utah. Not even the bishops were clear as to geography of the West! Bishop Tuttle was ever the missionary, as this custodian of his Personal Register can affirm. The reader follows him from New York to Salt Lake City to Virginia City, to Helena, to Boise, back to Salt Lake and eventually to Missouri. The story of his founding of schools and hospitals, institutions still in existence, is told, as is also related something of the source of funds for such development. He seems to have had good rapport with people of substance and good will. This reviewer has written a chapter on the Missouri Episcopate of Bishop Tuttle (1886-1923). Would that someone would fill another gap - his long tenure as Presiding Bishop (1903-1923). That should complete the Tuttle Story and would be as fascinating as the one of his nineteen years as a Missionary Bishop. Charles F. Rehkopf Diocese of Missouri</page></plain_text>
