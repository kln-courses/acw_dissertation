<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hope Jensen Schau, Albert M. Mu?iz Jr., &amp; Eric J. Arnould How Brand Community Practices Create Value Using social practice theory, this article reveals the process of collective value creation within brand communities. Moving beyond a single case study, the authors examine previously published research in conjunction with data collected in nine brand communities comprising a variety of product categories, and they identify a common set of value-creating practices. Practices have an "anatomy" consisting of (1) general procedural understandings and rules (explicit, discursive knowledge); (2) skills, abilities, and culturally appropriate consumption projects (tacit, embedded knowledge or how-to); and (3) emotional commitments expressed through actions and representations. The authors find that there are 12 common practices across brand communities, organized by four thematic aggregates, through which consumers realize value beyond that which the firm creates or anticipates. They also find that practices have a physiology, interact with one another, function like apprenticeships, endow participants with cultural capital, produce a repertoire for insider sharing, generate consumption opportunities, evince brand community vitality, and create value. Theoretical and managerial implications are offered with specific suggestions for building and nurturing brand community and enhancing collaborative value creation between and among consumers and firms. Keywords: brand community, branding, collective consumption, engagement strategies, marketing strategy, practice theory Modern marketing logic, as derived from economics, advanced a view of the firm and the customer as separate and discrete; the customer is exogenous to the firm and is the passive recipient of the firm's active value creation efforts, and value is created in the factory (Deshpand? 1983). However, a different perspective is emerging. Research across disparate streams of manage ment literature?from new product development, to services-dominant logic, to consumer culture theory?leads to the view that customers can cocreate value, cocreate competitive strategy, collaborate in the firm's innovation process (Etgar 2008; Franke and Piller 2004; Pr?gl and Schreier 2006; Von Hippel 2005), and even become endoge nous to the firm (Jaworski and Kohli 2006; Kalaignanam and Varadarajan 2006; Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004; Vargo and Lusch 2004). Despite the proliferation of such work, a consumer-centric delineation of the mechanism in which value is collectively created has not been identified, nor has a clear typology of cocreated value been developed. This article aims to address these issues. Consumer culture theory researchers have investigated a host of coproductive activities in consumer collectives orga nized around market-mediated cultural products (Mu?iz and Schau 2007) that elude many aspects of marketers' immediate control and make no direct contribution to mar keting efficiency or effectiveness as conventionally defined (Kalaignanam and Varadarajan 2006). These collectives include those that are (1) primarily experience based, as in brandfests, raves, or Linux "installfests" (Bagozzi and Dho lakia 2006; Cova and Cova 2002; McAlexander, Schouten, and Koenig 2002); (2) lifestyle based (Goulding and Saren 2009); (3) opposition ideology based (Thompson, Rind fleisch, and Arsel 2006); (4) brand based (Martin, Schouten, and McAlexander 2006; Mu?iz and O'Guinn 2001; Mu?iz and Schau 2005); or (5) Web community based (Szmigin and Reppel 2004). This work demonstrates that all such col lectives exhibit community-like qualities, as understood in sociology, and address identity-, meaning-, and status related concerns for participants. Moreover, this work sug gests that such collectives provide value to their members through emergent participatory actions of multiple kinds and that consumer collectives are the site of much value creation. A revolution in both marketing thought and practice is at hand. Recognizing the implications of the aforemen tioned developments, Lusch and Vargo (2006) argue that cocreation will ultimately induce firms to collaborate with customers to cocreate the entire marketing program. This is consistent with reasoning regarding open-source innova tion (Etgar 2008; Von Hippel 2005) and with emerging cor porate practices that tap into brand communities, such as LEGO, which explicitly sought and harnessed consumer innovation to refine the successful LEGO robotic kit Mindstorms (Koerner 2006), and skinnyCorp's Threadless, which manufacturers consumer-designed and critiqued Hope Jensen Schau is Associate Professor of Marketing, Eller College of Management, University of Arizona (e-mail: hschau@eller.arizona.edu).

However, cocreative actions have not been clearly identified and categorized in a uni form or generalizable way, nor has the nature of their value creation been revealed. In essence, we know that value is cocreated, but we do not know how, which makes replicat ing successful cocreation strategies within a product cate gory and even within the firm difficult and transferring suc cessful practices from one product domain to another nearly impossible. Using a meta-analytic approach, we aim to systemati cally categorize value creation practices within brand com munities, identify the role of each type of practice in the value creation process, and suggest templates for bundling practices to enhance collaborative value creation. We demonstrate the following: (1) Companies should foster a broad array of practices, moving beyond mere customiza tion; (2) managers can encourage a broad array of practices through seeding; (3) a focus on practices provides guidance for new product development by facilitating the identifica tion of high-fidelity, as well as low-fidelity, needs (Von Hip pel 2005); and (4) companies can encourage the interaction of practices to foster greater customer engagement with the brand. Background and Purpose Our research purpose is to reveal common processes of value creation among networked firm-facing actors in brand-centered communities, a meaningful and manageable subset of all commercially mediated collectives. We then situate these processes in the extant research. Case studies show that firm-facing actors can create value in use. How ever, the field has yet to systematize the knowledge of these value-creating activities. To be sure, progress has been made toward accounting for value creation. Holt (1995) illustrates the ways individual consumers derive subjective value through patterned interaction with a sporting event. Although this research is useful, Holt limits himself to dis cussions of individual value-creating activities, primarily through production of individual distinction in cultural capital endowments (Bourdieu 1984). Outside of providing the context for this behavior, the collective is understudied. Similar observations can be made about Belk's (1995) analysis of collectors. Others have begun to rectify such shortcomings. McAlexander, Schouten, and Koenig (2002) show that par ticipation in brandfests led to significant increases in feel ings of integration into the Jeep brand community and posi tive feelings about the brand and product category. These findings were robust across nonowners and newcomers as well as owners. Thus, we may infer that in addition to firm benefits, participants derive social and hedonic value from the experience. Franke and Piller (2004) show that partici pation in online product design leads to increases in will ingness to pay and willingness to pay more (an indirect indicator of brand equity). Thus, we may infer that partici pants derive some sort of value in use from participation. Although such studies represent important advances, they have their limitations. In neither of these studies (i.e., Franke and Piller 2004; McAlexander, Schouten, and Koenig 2002) are the activities by which consumers create value dissected, dimensionalized, or generalized. Although such activities are evident, they are treated idiosyncratically. No attempt has been made to link the value-creating activi ties with the activities in other brand community studies. This is a problem with the larger literature on brand con suming collectives, which has focused on the idiosyncratic and oversold novelty at the expense of uniformity, general izability, and connections to prior work. Indeed, not only have no meaningful connections been developed, but there has also been no attempt to develop the common nomencla ture for recurring activities and processes that we offer herein. Other authors have invited research centered on the value-creating activities of market-facing collectives, recog nizing the need for consistent nomenclature. Woodruff and Flint (2006, p. 194) call for "much greater focus on experi ential customer value phenomena" to resolve the differ ences in typologies of value in use. Similarly, O'Hern and Rindfleisch (2007, p. 37) argue that "the role of brand com munities as a catalyst for co-creation is an intriguing topic for future research." Clearly, our endeavor has a mandate. Following Vargo and Lusch (2004), we argue that value resides in the actions, interactions, and projects that acquired resources make possible or support. Taking inspi ration from Holt's (1995) initial foray in applying a socio logical theory of practice to individual consumer behaviors, we argue for an explicit methodological application of prac tice theory (Duguid 2005; Lave and Wenger 1991; Reck witz 2002; Schatzki 1996; Warde 2005) to disentangle the forms of collective value creation in brand communities. Practices are linked and implicit ways of understanding, saying, and doing things. They comprise a temporally unfolding and spatially dispersed nexus of behaviors that include practical activities, performances, and representa tions or talk. Practices link behaviors, performances, and representations through (1) procedures?explicit rules, principles, precepts, and instructions, called "discursive knowledge"; (2) understandings?knowledge of what to say and do, skills and projects, or know-how (i.e., tacit cultural templates for understanding and action); and (3) engage ments?ends and purposes that are emotionally charged insofar as people are committed to them (Duguid 2005; Warde 2005). Schatzki (1996) underscores how practices create and perpetuate both collective identity and individu ality. To engage in practices, people must develop shared understandings and demonstrate competencies that rein force social order while allowing them to distinguish them selves through adroit performances. Following Schatzki (1996), Warde (2005, p. 137) asserts that consuming is "a moment in almost every practice." Thus, consumption follows from practices, rather than vice versa, because practices dictate what is essential for the competent and meaningful engagement of social actors in a particular consumption setting (Schatzki 1996). A focus on practices emphasizes the routine, collective, and conven tional nature of consumption while accommodating the internally differentiated (across participants and groups; see our subsequent discussion of staking) and dynamic nature How Brand Community Practices Create Value / 31</page><page sequence="3">of consumption (see Cheng et al. 2007). As Warde further observes (p. 145), "practices are the principle steering device of consumption because they are the primary source of desire, knowledge and judgment;... recruitment to a practice becomes a principal explanatory issue." Thus, a practice focus dovetails with the gap identified in previous research on value creation in brand communities. To identify and categorize cocreative practices from a consumer-centric perspective and in a generalizable way, we draw on a corpus of data across nine brand communi ties. We access participants in brand communities in collab orative cocreation activities specifically, as well as their emic notions of value related to branded offerings and com munal activities. Using a meta-analytic review, we situate these practices in the extant literature, connecting the prac tices we revealed with those previously, if only implicitly, encountered in prior research. We then demonstrate how these practices interact, or are bundled, to create value. This enables us to develop new theory in the domain of con sumption practice. From a managerial perspective, our find ings illuminate opportunities to grow, not simply exploit, "customer competence" (Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2000). In short, our findings reveal how to build better brand partners. Method To address the research issues identified, we examine con sumer cocreation in an empirical context. Our sampling frame consists of an array of nine brand communities across traditional product category classifications: 3Com Audrey (Internet device), Apple Newton (personal digital assistant), BMW Mini (car), Garmin (global positioning system [GPS] device), Jones Soda (carbonated beverage), Lomo and Holga (cameras), Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (here inafter, TPATH) (musical group), StriVectin (cosmeceuti cal), and Xena: Warrior Princess (episodic action television program). Collectively, these data sites represent a broad spectrum of marketplace offerings. Packaged goods, elec tronics (including cutting-edge and well-established tech nology), and entertainment are represented. The data also represent greater gender diversity than is found in most prior work on brand communities. The Audrey and Newton communities are primarily male; Garmin, Jones, TPATH, Lomo/Holga, and Mini are fairly balanced; and Xena and StriVectin are primarily female. Table 1 describes each brand community and the nature of research engagement with each. It was our hope that this diverse collection of communities would increase the chances of our data res onating with that presented in the extant research, thus facilitating the identification of common elements. Our data include in-depth interviews with community members, participant and naturalistic observation of com munity activities, and netnographic research within forums centered on brands. We observed forums for all the brands included and downloaded thousands of messages posted by brand users. Our analytic approach combines the strengths of primary data collection with those of meta-analysis and overcomes the weakness of individual case study approaches to brand collectives. In many cases, we assessed the full breadth of community activities both online and in the corporeal world. In some cases, specifically with StriVectin and Xena, we pursued the community across forums when several sites were implicated in community activities. Finally, our approach is appropriate because we endeavored to move the unit of analysis away from the indi vidual consumer and individual brand community to the practices common across individuals and communities. Our analysis also benefits from the insights of a multidiscipli nary (anthropology, social psychology, sociology, and mar keting) and bigendered team. These differences allow trian gulation across researchers in terms of convergence and divergence in interpretation following guidance in previous research. In addition, we performed a meta-analytic review. We identified 52 articles published in Journal of Marketing, Journal of Consumer Research, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, Journal of Interactive Marketing, Con sumption, Markets and Culture, and Advances in Consumer Research that explicitly claim to examine collective con sumer behavior and/or "practices." None of these studies expressly examined collective value creation, and none used the construct of collaborative behavior uniformly or system atically. Nonetheless, using four coders to achieve inter coder agreement on interpretation, we identified 37 articles (71%) that contained sufficient material to code collective practices. In 13 (35%) of these articles, we found some evi dence of practices consistent with our current data set. Thus, this analysis of published research demonstrates that the 12 practices we identify here are robust (Farley, Lehmann, and Sawyer 1995) because we found traces of them within data analyzed for diverse theoretical purposes. Findings Our first goal was to compile an exhaustive list of practices common to the brand communities studied and to situate those practices in the context of prior research. Our intent in this endeavor was multifaceted. First, we wanted to synthe size and extend prior accounts of brand community. Sec ond, we wanted to reconcile common practices that have appeared under disparate titles. Third, we wanted to dissect and dimensionalize these practices. Fourth, we wanted to systematically document how a constellation of practices coalesce to create value-added brand community experi ences. Doing these things would enable us to place brand communities in both new theoretical and managerial lights. We induced 12 value-creating practices across the nine brand communities we studied. We assert that these com mon practices represent value-creating dynamics present in most, if not all, brand communities. To support this asser tion, as mentioned previously, we analyzed the extant litera ture on collective consumer behavior to find instances of behavior that correspond to these 12 practices. Appendix A details the practices common in the brand communities we studied, as well as those abstracted from prior research. It lists the name of the practice, the definition, a list of the prior research in which each practice was evident, and examples of the practice in our data. We further organize these practices into four thematic categories: (1) social net 32 / Journal of Marketing, September 2009</page><page sequence="4">TABLE 1 Research Engagement Brand Community Research Engagement Description 3Com 20 months of 3Com is an Internet-only device released in October 2000, based on the Palm operating system. It is Audrey naturalistic designed to be a simple and elegant way to access the Internet, check e-mail and sync with Palm observation personal digital assistants (PDAs). The Audrey had a rushed release, tried to carve out a new product 8 in-depth category, and failed to connect with consumers. After a little more than seven months on the market, interviews 3Com discontinued the Audrey in June of 2001 and offered full rebates to purchasers. 3Com no longer with key provides any support for the Audrey. Numerous sites sell new and hacked Audreys, and there are members several user forums in which users can find assistance in repairing and extending the functionality of their Audreys. Apple 7 years of The Apple Newton (PDA) was introduced in 1993. The Newton had a rushed release, tried to carve out Newton naturalistic a new product category, and failed to connect with consumers. Newton was far from bug free. Widely observation reported problems, coupled with a high price, discouraged most potential adopters. Despite these 2.5 years of barriers, a strong and fiercely loyal brand community formed around the Newton (Mu?iz and Schau participant 2005; Wagner 1998). The Newton lost its lead in the emerging PDA category to the Palm Pilot in 1996 observation and was officially discontinued by Apple in February of 1998.

Garmin 4 years of Garmin produces a variety of GPS devices, including the Nuvi, Quest, and Streetpilot lines. These naturalistic devices enable users to pinpoint their exact location in real time and plot directions to any geographic observation destination. They have a worldwide community consisting of users and company employees. The 1 year of community manifests online and offline. The community is truly global in nature with multiple languages participant used on the message boards. The offline community is more travel based, insofar as people interested observation in certain destinations or dwelling in certain destinations meet to exchange use experiences and travel 4 in-depth experiences, member interviews Jones Soda 4.5 years of Jones Soda is a carbonated beverage firm that solicits customer cocreation from a community of naturalistic devoted fans. The firm gives its 12- to 24-year-old target consumers input into product innovations observation (flavors), packaging (labels, cap quotes), promotions (stickers, Web content, price points), and 8 in-depth advertising. Through the Jones Soda Web site, consumers are asked to rate suggested new flavors and member are invited to submit photos and copy that would fit in advertisements and on the packaging. A mobile interviews Jones promotional vehicle arrives at events such as the X Games, malls, and school campuses to give away promotional material and have consumers try and rate Jones soda products. The promotional vehicle stocks flavors of interest (new and experimental) and actively solicits consumer feedback. As of 2005, Jones Soda used nearly 4400 consumer-generated photos in its marketing (BusinessWeek 2005). Lomo and 5 years of Lomo and Holga are cheaply made Russian and Chinese cameras, respectively, with inexpensive Holga naturalistic lenses and few adjustable options. Users simply point and shoot. The international origins, observation inexpensiveness, and simplicity of these cameras have made both cameras the subject of active community followings, mostly centered on one joint community (www.lomography.com). Lomography has come to stand for a lo-fi, no-rules, and no-pretense school of photography that stresses creativity and spontaneity. Members create modifications and additions for the cameras, enabling them to do things the manufacturer never intended. Over time, the Lomo and Holga brand communities have merged to create one dual-brand community based around these toy cameras. Mini Cooper 2 years of The BMW Mini was introduced in North America in 2002. It is a retro brand that is distinguishable from naturalistic nostalgic brands (Morris Mini) by the element of technological updating (BMW). It is "a brand new, old observation fashioned offering" (Brown, Kozinets, and Sherry 2003, p. 20). The brand was introduced and sustained with a marketing communications campaign that created an iconoclastic, high-style, high-cultural-capital image for the brand that builds off the retro, populist narrative associated with the old British Morris Mini. Through numerous local chapters and its elaborate Web site, the North American community promotes chat, discussion of all aspects of the various Mini models, frequent group road trips and rallies, customization of interiors and exteriors, and racing, and it facilitates both lateral recycling of parts and supplies and limited aftermarket sales by qualified vendors. TPATH 23 years of TPATH is a Grammy Award winning rock act with a career spanning more than three decades. The naturalistic group successfully leveraged the music video art form, earning an MTV Music Video Award and a place observation on various compilations of the most influential music videos. Their Greatest Hits album was certified 10x 12 years of platinum in 2003, and their debut release continues to sell globally; new fans emerge across generations participant and around the world. In 2006, ABC contracted with TPATH to use their song "Runnir? Down a Dream" observation to promote the NBA Finals (www.ESPN.com). As indication of their enduring popularity, TPATH 67 in-depth performed at the Super Bowl XLII halftime show. The group's fans are active in attending concerts, interviews hosting tailgates and concert parties, tuning into the radio show, posting on the online forums, and participating in fan chats. How Brand Community Practices Create Value / 33</page><page sequence="5">TABLE 1 Continued StriVectin Xena: Warrior Princess 3 years of naturalistic observation 6 in-depth member interviews 12 years of naturalistic observation 2.5 years of participant observation 28 in-depth interviews StriVectin is a "cosmeceutical" (a high-end cosmetic with pharmaceutical properties) that treats skin imperfections (stretch marks, wrinkles, and scars). The tagline for StriVectin's advertising campaign for the last three years is "Better than Botox," focusing on its age-defying results. The ad text claims that StriVectin has clinically proven attributes that effectively repair skin and vastly improve skin's appearance. There is a lively community centered on StriVectin, composed mostly, but not exclusively, of women. The members meet online on message boards sponsored by the producer, as well as on online forums dedicated to beauty and "youth endurance" or sites devoted to waging war against the signs of aging. The members are evangelical in their support of the product and tout the effectiveness of the product through the telling of highly personal testimonials. The Xena character began as a guest role on the Hercules television program in 1995. Xena: Warrior Princess became a successful spin-off melodrama that ceased production June 2001. It is now in syndication on various networks. The show has lucrative syndication agreements; has on- and offline cottage industries revolving around the fan culture of costuming, fan fiction, and conventioneering; fits squarely within existing organizations (Society for Creative Anachronism) devoted to medieval reenactments and fairs; and in many respects appeals to other fantasy fan communities, such as those revolving around Star Trek (Jenkins 1992), Star Wars (Brown, Kozinets, and Sherry 2003), and X-Files (Kozinets 1997). working, (2) impression management, (3) community engagement, and (4) brand use. Next, we describe these categories and the practices housed within each. First, social networking practices are those that focus on creating, enhancing, and sustaining ties among brand com munity members. These include (1) welcoming, (2) empathizing, and (3) governing. This trio of practices high lights the homogeneity of the brand community, or the sim ilarities across brand community members and their norma tive behavioral expectations of themselves and one another. These practices operate primarily in the intangible domain of the emotions and reinforce the social or moral bonds within the community. Examples of social networking prac tices can be gleaned from prior research. Mu?iz and O'Guinn (2001, p. 419) describe behaviors consistent with empathizing in the following excerpt from their field notes: The club president proudly shows a letter he received from a sixteen-year-old Italian boy who is a big fan of Saab, despite the fact that he doesn't drive yet. He got the club's address from their web page. The letter says that he is a fan of pre-changed 900, especially liking the '83 and '84 3-door models. He is seeking pictures of these cars that the club members might own. This letter is big news at the meeting and is shown to everyone over the course of the evening. The variety and scope of social networking practices that we witness across our nine communities challenge Mu?iz and O'Guinn's (2001) assertion that brand commu nities are communities of limited liability. What we observe suggests that social networking practices evolve and move past brand boundaries. Examples include TPATH fans post ing open invitations to community members to life-cycle celebrations, Garmin users relating road challenges and solutions to other members, StriVectin users complaining and sympathizing about aging, Lomo and Holga users encouraging one another to continue their effects trials, and Jones Soda users supporting one another in their pursuit of independent music. We assert that this metamorphosis beyond limited liability is a function of the amount of time members can spend with one another in enduring brand communities. Daily or multiweekly contact, sustained over several years, enables these friendships to expand beyond brand boundaries. Indeed, there is evidence of longtime community members remaining in the community after dis possessing themselves of the focal brand (e.g., when a life stage responsibility requires a Mini driver to sell the Mini and purchase a more family-friendly vehicle). Second, impression management practices are those that have an external, outward focus on creating favorable impressions of the brand, brand enthusiasts, and brand com munity in the social universe beyond the brand community. These include (1) evangelizing and (2) justifying. In evan gelizing, members act as altruistic emissaries and ambas sadors of good will. Various impression management prac tices are evident in the extant brand community literature. Kozinets's (2001) study of the Star Trek community and Mu?iz and Schau's (2005) study of the Apple Newton brand community provide relevant and closely related examples. Members of both brand communities engaged in impression management practices, evangelizing and justifying their devotion to manage stigmas associated with overt sci-fi fan dom and reliance on an obsolete and abandoned technology, respectively. Third, community engagement practices are those that reinforce members' escalating engagement with the brand community. These include (1) staking, (2) milestoning, (3) badging, and (4) documenting. This set of practices empha sizes and safeguards brand community heterogeneity, or the distinctions among brand community members and subsets of members. These practices are competitive and provide members with social capital. Here, brand use is secondary to communal engagement. For example, in staking, commu nity members delineate their specific domain of participa tion: "The Lomo community is vast, but I operate mostly within the groups interested in architectural lomography and within that group I spend most time with the Scandina vian group and some time with the German lomographers" (Hans interview, 11/18/08). Hans carefully stakes his domain of engagement. This echoes Martin, Schouten, and McAlexander's (2006) study, in which female Harley com munity members distinguished the contours of their engage ment from that of the male community members. Mile stones are standout brand experiences, such as the first 34 / Journal of Marketing, September 2009</page><page sequence="6">TPATH concert, the first Garmin caching find, or a posted Lomograph. Badging occurs when a semiotic signifier of a milestone is created?for example, when a fan buys a con cert T-shirt or when a Mini owner makes a designated "run" and adds a circular image commemorating that to his or her signature file. Documenting occurs when brand community members construct a narrative of their brand experience, staking their social space, participating in milestones, badg ing the milestones for posterity, and finally evolving a cohe sive personal brand narrative (see Appendix A). Fourth, brand use practices are specifically related to improved or enhanced use of the focal brand. These include (1) grooming, (2) customizing, and (3) commoditizing. Examples of grooming include Mini consumers who share homemade tools and advice (Q-Tips in air vents) to better clean their cars and demonstrate their collective pride, StriVectin users who encourage wiping the tip of the tube with a clean tissue and storing it in the refrigerator, proce dures for handling and storing original TPATH record albums, care and maintenance of Xena costumes, and home-crafted "snugglies" (soft cases) for the Garmin, Lomos, and Holgas. Examples of customizing include when a TPATH fan creates a custom tour poster from his or her first concert, when a StriVectin user carefully mixes StriVectin with foundation makeup, when a Newton user modifies a Newton so that it can perform functions other than those anticipated by the manufacturer, and when a Lomo fan customizes a camera lens to achieve more artful distortion. Examples of commoditizing are when Newton, Xena, and TPATH communities monitor and restrict the price of community-created resources to encourage diffu sion of technologies and items deemed to be community building; when Jones Soda drinkers rant about corporate distribution or Pepsi and Coke products but advocate offer ing Jones in Target, Walgreens, and Starbucks; when Garmin users stretch the useful life of firm-offered maps with local patches given as freeware but anxiously antici pate firm-updated map packages; and when Lomo and Holga users chastise digital camera offerings as pricey but encourage the resale of these "toy" cameras on eBay for upward of $100. The Operation of Practices Each practice exhibits a common anatomy, which can be described as (1) understandings (knowledge and tacit cul tural templates), (2) procedures (explicit performance rules), and (3) engagements (emotional projects and pur poses). Each practice similarly demonstrates a physiology in which these anatomical parts function together. Practices vary in their anatomy, but in their physiology, they vary across communities. We identified the anatomy of practices previously. In what follows, we detail the physiology of practices, or the way the three anatomical components of the practices?procedures, understandings, and emotional engagements?cohesively function. We employ the physi ology metaphor to emphasize the dynamism, internal diver sity, and interaction between practices. Bagozzi and Dholakia (2002, p. 4) propose that "a per son achieves a social identity [in a community] through self awareness of one's membership in a group and the emo tional and evaluative significance of this membership." The approach to brand community membership that we develop here is different. We assert that an emergent sense of mem bership and identity arises from the trajectory, or the devel opment of practices that foster the exchange of collectively defined and valorized resources. This is consistent with prior work on communities of practice (Wenger 1987). Resources may compose cognitive elements of practices (e.g., knowledge of procedures and rules), status elements (e.g., self-esteem), and emotional elements of practices (e.g., commitment, pride), but they may also include ele ments such as services, money, and accessory goods. Physiology of practices. Practices work together and drive one another, as Figure 1 suggests. Empirically, the thematic categories we revealed (i.e., social networking, impression management, community engagement, and brand use) work closely together as a process of collective value creation, analogous to gears working together. For example, the impression management practice of evangeliz ing may yield to the social networking practice of welcom ing as new members join the fold. The social networking practice of governing provides explicit directions for the community engagement practice of staking as status differ ences among members are marked, and the social network ing practice of milestoning may inspire the brand use prac tice of commoditizing as members create badges (social networking) for members' achievements. Appendix B provides details of the physiology of prac tices from several of our commercial collectivities. Prac tices work together both to enhance the value people realize when engaged in brand communities and to promote the collective health and welfare of the social bodies centered on brands. Practices can be combined in complex ways. The effects of interaction are at minimum additive and poten tially exponential. Interactions can be either intrathematic (practices acting together within a functional theme) or interthematic (practices working together across functional themes). In what follows, we provide one example of a practice physiology. Milestoning is the recounting of salient episodes in brand and community relationships. A vivid example comes from the Mini "birthing" stories that are organized by participants in "production week." Good job Birdman! I'm like you. I watched cameras, checked tracking.... You'll treasure having these for your "scrap book" or should I say Minibird's "baby book"? Jake [the car] was not on a WW ship so there were a lot less options for catching glimpses of the journey. This doesn't apply to east coast folks, but the cameras at the Panama Canal are amazing. Was able to see the Auto Ban ner cross with my Mini. Hang in there. Minibird is almost home! (5th Gear, Phoenix, Ariz.) In this conversation, the experienced poster (5th Gear) empathizes, encouraging his fellow enthusiast to keep track of GPS tracking information and port camera feeds and comments positively about the Panama Canal camera feeds that West Coast enthusiasts employ to track cargo ships, such as the Auto Banner mentioned in the post. Tellingly, the poster encourages Birdman to produce a customized "baby book" for the car, which will help Birdman milestone his brand relationship and promote the social practice of How Brand Community Practices Create Value / 35</page><page sequence="7">FIGURE 1 The Process of Collective Value Creation in Brand Communities Impression Management Evangelizing Justifying Brand Use Customizing Grooming Commoditizing J following the Mini through production and delivery.

By stringing together a host of unre lated Web functionalities (customizing) and through e-mail and telephone exchanges with BMW marketing staff, par ticipants can track the physical movement of the vehicle. In this way, not only is how-to, discursive knowledge shared among community members, but it is made normatively expected as well. It becomes something individual members do, value, and expect, and it ultimately becomes a collective good that strengthens the brand community. Here, tacit know-how is being identified. Participants exchange rumors (e.g., when the ship will leave port), infor mation (e.g., confirmation that a production number has been assigned and that a vehicle has left the factory), and empathie communications about the wait (e.g., socially constructed as an anxious time) for a first viewing and dri ving of the new arrival. Naming and other anthropomor phizing (customization) performances are encouraged dur ing this time. Finally, owners engage an additional possession ritual: final predelivery customizing at the Mini dealer. When following these threads over the weeks from order to delivery, it is easy to track the evolving emotional engagement as participants develop a special dialect to speak about the impending arrival and encourage one another to create commemorative "baby books" to docu ment the new arrival. This illustrates the explicit proce dures, tacit know-how, representational gestures, and tailor ing to circumstances that together constitute a practice physiology. We find analogous examples of tacit knowledge being used across the other eight brand communities: TPATH gestures associated with song lyrics, geocaching hints shared among Garmin users through patterned utter ances (rhymes), StriVectin community members' use of fin gertip patting in applications, Jones Soda campaign proto cols associated with voting, Lomographers developing online posting styles, and so on. Intrathematic interactions are the most common when the practices within a set focused on a thematic function work together toward their thematic goal (e.g., social net working, brand use). For example, community engagement is fostered when milestoning (seminal brand events) is com bined with badging (symbolic representation of the mile stone) and is part of the overall documenting of the use journey. Our data reveal that in the case of a brand enthusi ast's first TPATH concert, a milestone is created (first con cert). That milestone is celebrated, and a badge is created or purchased (tour T-shirt). The accumulation of experiential milestones and their related badges helps the brand user document his or her use journey in a narrative format. Each badged milestone becomes a chapter in the story. Similarly, brand use is magnified when a user grooms the brand, cus tomizes the brand to his or her unique needs, and commodi tizes the grooming or customization technique for collective use. Garmin users have grooming practices to keep the device's face clean and safe (ranging from carefully pre scribed cleaning regimes to the creation of fabric "snug glies"). When the grooming routine and customization are commoditized, brand use can be enhanced within the entire 36 / Journal of Marketing, September 2009</page><page sequence="8">collective. Because the practices are normatively expected, users feel compelled to adopt them. Commoditization makes doing so easier. Interthematic interactions, or practices that work together across themes, abound. Interthematic interactions are evidenced when evangelizing (impression management practice) yields to welcoming (social networking practice) or when positive word of mouth inspires outsiders to join the brand community. Another example is when badging behavior inspires the creation of a brand community badge that can be commoditized, or sold to members and non members alike, as in the purchasing of Jones Soda bottles with customized labels. Here, the badge is commoditized and inspires more brand community engagement or brand use, thus creating more value. Practices operate like apprenticeships. Practices can be viewed as apprenticeships (Lave and Wenger 1991); their effects evolve over time as consumer engagement deepens and practices are integrated. Recall the milestoning prac tices surrounding Mini birthing stories discussed previ ously. Members learned when a vehicle left the factory and when an auto-carrying ship left port. They learned how to use the resources available to track the car's progress from factory to delivery. Finally, they learned what activities they were expected to engage in during this time and how they were supposed to feel. As 0sterlund and Carlile (2005, p. 97) aptly note, members "do not merely learn about prac tices, they become practitioners." Welcoming is the first practice to which members are exposed. Consequently, it is easily adopted, and recent members can enact this practice with newer members. With the addition of more and increasingly complex practices, members' standing and legitimacy increase. New members may adopt the practice of milestoning to demonstrate mem bership in the brand community and participation in spe cific rites of passage. In this way, members are recruited to new practices (Warde 2005). Additional practices are acquired as members determine the fit between their skills and the community's repertoire of practices. In this way, members transition from apprentices to journeymen. The first step in an apprenticeship within the TPATH community often involves the first recording a fan buys and the first concert the fan attends. Threads on the TPATH forums are dedicated to the first song that made a person a fan, the first album the person bought, the first concert the person attended, and the first time the person realized he or she was a fan. These seminal experiences are evidenced in threads dedicated to TPATH experience firsts, and the dis course surrounding these milestones inspires greater engagement; tales of concert attendance begets more con cert attendance and subsequent storytelling. In the Xena community, fans note their first participa tion in a Xena event?for example, the first time they bought Xena gear (e.g., costumes, props, paraphernalia) or the first time they created and shared Xena-inspired art. As Zoey reveals, The first time I went to the Xena section of the SCA [Society for Creative Anachronism] festival was phenom enal. I had cobbled together a costume that I was initially quite proud of, but then I saw what the others had:... authentic medieval gear including weapons and outfits that looked like they came right off the set. I had to have that too to belong.... Beautiful, strong women in Xena clothes. It's addictive, (interview, 07/05/99) Here, Zoey describes her awe at the first Xena event she attended and her desire to purchase more authentic Xena wear and attend more events. Similarly, Mandy describes how her Xena engagement escalated in tandem with others who started at the conventions when she did: The first convention I went to was a fan-run subtext oriented but main-friendly [run by fans who support the lesbian reading of the show but welcome those who adhere to an action-adventure reading]. I actually went with a boyfriend. We wore clothes we had in our closet:... a mishmash of western leather clothes made to look medieval. Don't ask me how. But the thing is, most other people were dressed like that ... [with] stuff they had already. Not vintage or even authentic replicas.... The elaborate costumes came over time. One person ups the bar and we all really dig it and compliment them, and then we all start upping the ante.... Now, you can't really show up in something you just had in your closet. No one would take you seriously, (interview, 02/10/2001) Mandy describes how this practice began as a casual nod to medieval attire and became a quest for authenticity and even vintage costumes through competitive, escalating engagement in brand practices. She shows that practices develop; hedonic engagement evolves and deepens over time, and value expands. Mandy's description of the evolu tion of the practice echoes Warde's (2005, p. 139) assertion that "[practices have a trajectory or path of development, a history." Similarly, badging offers a vivid illustration of the emergent sense of membership and identity that arises from practices. Contrasted with Bagozzi and Dholakia's (2006) perspective on identification with brand communities (in which identification is conceptualized as an antecedent individual difference variable), badging is clearly an emer gent property of membership. The greater the length of membership and level of engagement, the more detailed and intricate the efforts at badging became. For example, in the Mini community, the number and complexity of badges are related to the length or intensity of affiliation and the extent of value experienced. Of particular note is that badging behaviors codify the expression of brand identity, suggest ing the proper behaviors to be a true member (see also Mu?iz and O'Guinn [2001] on legitimacy) and the proper idiom for expressing that membership. The aforementioned tendencies illuminate the factors influencing the customer's willingness to engage in creating value for the brand and firm (Kalaignanam and Varadarajan (2006). Consumers become habituated to learning more from the community while mastering an increasingly com plicated set of skills. This has important implications for the development of customer competence (Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2000) because it demonstrates that customer competencies are not static. Through apprenticeship, they evolve and expand. In addition, observing members docu menting a customization or cleaning/grooming practice How Brand Community Practices Create Value / 37</page><page sequence="9">demonstrates that this evolution is organic and endemic to the community with a distinct trajectory. This is not to say that the marketer cannot affect the development of prac tices. Rather, it illustrates that when left to their own devices, communities will foster and develop skills of potential value to the marketer. Prahalad and Ramaswamy (2000) suggest that one of the challenges to co-opting cus tomer competence stems from the diversity of customers' sophistication and knowledge. The apprenticeship aspect of practices suggests that vibrant communities can be relied on to mitigate this problematic diversity. The Effects of Practices Practices endow participants with cultural capital. A competitive spirit underlies much brand community behav ior (Mu?iz and O'Guinn 2001). Practices, especially com munity engagement practices, present opportunities for individual differentiation through adroit performance (Bourdieu 1984; Holt 1995). Members compete on brand devotion, knowledge, and history to display their various competencies. Mini drivers compete for the best racing times, narrowest gap between custom tires and wheel well, or shiniest finish. I'd like to thank K*, and M*, and R*, and C*, and C*, and H* for teaching me so much in the last 18 months.... Thanks to your help (and a bit of work and many $$$ spent by me), I won Best Foreign Car today in Blimey's first car show!!! I'll post pics and a writeup later on my blog, but couldn't wait to share the news and THANK YOU folks for helping make it happen. I got lots of kudos from other car owners on detailing, paint polish, style, theme, etc, and I didn't know squat about any of that until I started hanging out with you folks. (V-P Tarheels Mini) Similarly, TPATH fans compete on the basis of knowledge and number of concerts attended, Audrey and Newton users compete to demonstrate novel and wide-ranging use of the device, and Xena fan-fiction authors compete for awards on the Athenaeum Web site and strive to have the most intri cate and accurate costumes. Competition enables members to distinguish themselves from one another and to create a social hierarchy that members reference strategically. Con sider this posting from the Lomo community: "Lomo wiz ard! You're good man, but check mine and Avery's out! ! We got some sweet effects in the urban set we did. Surely, you'll admit we're in the game! ! ! !" Photography becomes a competitive, noncontact sport. It is through practices that brand fans become brand devotees. In addition to developing explicit and tacit perfor mative skills, they also develop local cultural capital resources that differentiate them in terms of status within the community (Holt 1995). Consumers who achieve status within the brand community are reluctant to give it up. I'm into the whole scene, but the truth is I stay in the scene because I'm really known for my authentic cos tumes and my swordsmanship. I mean people know me because of it and they seek me out to see what I've made lately or what moves I developed.... It's theatrical and I guess I have "fans." ... Sure I sell some of what I make but it doesn't really make money or cover costs. I have a very expensive Xena habit and what I make on the cos turnes doesn't scratch the surface. (Sondra interview, 07/18/02) Sondra's status within the Xena community is a source of pride; she stays engaged because she garners the admiration of others in the brand community, and this increases the value she experiences from the brand. These tendencies reveal the "micropolitics of consump tion" (Holt 1998, p. 22), or the ways cultural capital pur suits are enacted in everyday brand community life. Mem bers of brand communities accrue cultural capital through the accumulation of an increasingly diverse set of increas ingly intricate practices. They work to maintain it. These tendencies also suggest an overall positive trajectory of cul tural capital (Holt 1995) in brand communities, with mem bers valuing and safeguarding what they have accumulated. Practices produce a repertoire for insider sharing. Prac tices provide participants with an almost inexhaustible source of shared insider jargon and modes of representa tion, which enhance consumers' brand experience. Consider possibilities arising from the practice of customizing. The following post responds to a request for information about uneven ride in a "lowered" Mini: [Progressive rate springs are more sensitive to load than linear rate springs?load being your weight. Also, never use the fenders as a measuring benchmark; front fenders are used to "take up" build tolerances. The rear fenders are typically much more accurate as these are part of the uni-body.... In the rear, measure from any of the three bolts that are used to adjust toe on the rear trailing arm. Up front, use the inner ball joint?front part of the control arm. And, while measuring, you can use the outer ball joint up front and the lower rear damper bolt to measure across the car?an X pattern?to determine squareness. (6th Gear, No ID) The practical activity of measuring and adjusting springs is embedded within a complex set of customizing practices designed to augment the car's coolness factor by decreasing the distance between the tires and the wheel well, thereby accenting the wheels. Other related threads are devoted to discussions and pictures of this distance and of wheel/tire sizes and configurations. The "show me your wheels" thread contains more than 4500 posts of photos of wheels. One post in this thread brags "Almost No Clearance" in the caption to one photo, evoking admiration from multiple posters (e.g., "msfit ... that is just ridiculously hot! now i really want the kdw2's" [2nd Gear, Queens, NY]; "yea, drop it to 40's and never 'rub' again; PM SENT!!" [6th Gear; EastSide]). Often, this linguistic play takes the form of exchanges of photos accompanied by short lists of prod uct attributes (e.g., "Gram Light 57S 17x7.5 with Dunlop SP Sport Maxx 215/45... 40 mm offset, rubs with M7 springs" [4th Gear, same as yesterday]). In the StriVectin community, insider information trading often involves combining StriVectin with other products. People are impatient for results. They don't realize that StriVectin isn't that effective as a standalone application. I need to tell them all the time, "You need to reinforce its effects by using skin-friendly products in general. It's not a miracle." You need a whole routine that supports it.... StriVectin only works if you modify your whole beauty 38 / Journal of Marketing, September 2009</page><page sequence="10">regime. I'm constantly reminding people in the forums, especially those who claim it isn't working. (Clara inter view, 06/21/2006) Clara admits that whatever results she identifies are from an entire consumption set, not just one product. She says that she shares the most effective uses of StriVectin with other community members and recommends complementary pur chases that will enhance consumers' realized value. As these examples illustrate, jargon does the boundary work typical of dialects and provides a creative repertoire for insider sharing. This linguistic repertoire of representational forms and the trading it facilitates foster, recreate, and strengthen the community. They also create consumption opportunities. Practices generate consumption opportunities. Through practices, members generate, reify, and perpetuate con sumption behaviors and patterns. Consider the practice of documenting. Documenting captures and formalizes a con sumption practice. However, in doing so, it provides a tem plate on which other members can build. One person per forming (and documenting) a modification invites others to perform the same and other modifications. In this way, doc umenting serves a constructive community function by establishing scaffolding on which others can build and develop further practices. Similarly, engagement in the milestones, memories of milestones, and the retelling of milestone memories inspires more consumption. Within the TPATH community, it is a common practice to commemo rate first concerts with anniversary concerts, as when fans who first saw TPATH in 1985 make a point of attending TPATH concert dates in 2005 to mark the 20th anniversary of their first TPATH concert. Notably, these anniversaries are consumption anniversaries, not significant band dates or dates that even have other social importance to the fan. Likewise, in the Jones Soda community, consumers discuss their experiences with the Jones promotional vehicle and their decision to follow it to another location. These kinds of conversations perpetuate and extend consumption behaviors. Grooming practices lead to new consumption, dictating what is appropriate in caring for the brand. Additional (and community-sanctioned) supplies must be purchased and used in the approved manner. In the TPATH community, TPATH image- and logo-adorned clothes are valued, and the community discusses care and laundering of these items to extend the clothes' life while retaining the precious meanings associated with tours: It's a tricky thing;... you want to wear the T-shirts [with band images and tour info] because you were there. You sort of relive it or at least vividly recall the concert when you pull the shirt out of your closet, but you know that every wear brings the shirt one more step closer to destruction.... I wash mine in Woolite. It drives my wife crazy. If she doesn't pull it aside and put it in the gentle cycle, I get pretty pissed off.... We have a system now; we wash them [concert T-shirts] with her lace d?licates, but not with any hooks and clasps?we can't risk holes! (Kyle interview, 05/18/2000) Kyle's determination to wear his memorabilia means that he must be careful when wearing and washing the garments because both contribute to their destruction. His devotion brings about consumption of a specialty detergent, Woolite, and he risks domestic conflict in insisting that his wife employ special washing procedures. Documenting often functions as a manual of discursive how-to-consume infor mation. This becomes important to community reproduc tion when the behavior is complex. By simplifying or encouraging complex behavior and actions, practices allow members to become more deeply engaged with the brand and community and, thus, to institutionalize consumption behaviors. Here, Warde's (2005) assertion regarding the pri macy of practices is most evident. Indeed, consumption fol lows from practices rather than vice versa. Practices contin ually create and perpetuate new opportunities for consumption. Practices evince brand community vitality. It has long been understood that numbers of posts, replies, and hits provide evidence of participant interest in online sites. Our analysis would also suggest that the existence, number, and diversity of practices that can be assessed on brand-related Web sites offer additional methods for assessing brand community vitality. For example, North American Motor ing, Newton, and the Shipper Seasons Xena Web sites evince full-fledged practices in terms of the tripartite defini tion we outlined at the outset of the article. Procedures, understandings, and hedonic engagement, not to mention specialized vocabularies, are all evident. In contrast, at the various Jones Soda sites, there is considerable evangelizing on the guestbook and badging and customizing through the creation of personalized labels, cap, and banner quotes. However, little evidence of the development of special sym bols or language, or of performances specific to the Jones community, can be found. Instead, such elements are bor rowed from broader subcultures and various musical gen res. Furthermore, in contrast to the hundreds of threads consisting of scores of posts and responses on the Mini, Newton, and Xena sites, at Jones Soda sites, there are few threads (see Appendix B). Posts and replies across the vari ous forums rarely exceed a handful, nor do site moderators actively intervene, a source of some frustration among posters. Thus, the music forum is marred by the presence of apparently unpoliced spam, and there is little evidence of emergent community leaders at the Jones sites, in contrast to North American Motoring (e.g., do-it-yourself mechan ics) or Xena (e.g., prominent fan-fiction authors). On the basis of these observations, we assert that more practices evince brand community vitality. We postulate that stronger brand communities present a more diverse constellation of practices than weaker brand communities. Furthermore, the practices of stronger brand communities are more complex and require more insider knowledge than the practices of weaker, less cohesive brand communities. Finally, hosting of online and real-world interaction spaces seems to be an antecedent to vitality. These assertions await testing in further research. Practices create value. By now it should be clear that consumers create value through their participation in brand How Brand Community Practices Create Value / 39</page><page sequence="11">communities and, specifically, in the enactment of prac tices. Through 12 practices, consumers affect the entire marketing mix. Each practice serves to enable brand use and encourage deeper community engagement. Practices must be known to be repeated and must be repeated to become part of the value creation repertoire. By providing opportunities to demonstrate competencies, practices allow members to accrue cultural capital through adroit perfor mance, which creates value for the consumer. Specifically, evangelizing creates value by enlarging the brand commu nity and its human resource base while enhancing the brand perception outside the brand community. Empathizing cre ates value by providing affective resources within a sympa thetic social network. This support system acts as a signifi cant switching cost for consumers who come to depend on it. Grooming creates value by preserving the brand's perfor mance and appearance. Customizing creates value by offer ing unique but reproducible solutions to user challenges. Milestoning and badging create value by providing a motif with which to build brand meanings associated with the use journey. Practices structurally add value by making actions reproducible and repeatable, thus allowing more consumers to derive greater value from the brand. Consider an example from the Audrey brand community. Because the brand is no longer supported by the marketer, the repeatability of actions takes on an added urgency. Members must provide sufficient detail: This page explains how I got a Korn shell running on my Audrey. It was a pain in the neck, but now the work is done and it ought to be easier from this point on. This is an overview of what I did: 1. Get an Audrey flash ROM image on disk from someone who knew someone who apparently serviced Audreys, and had a Compact Rash card that was used to restore Audreys to their original state. Without this image, I would have probably gotten nowhere. 2. Using the QNX RTP, dump the contents of the Audrey file system to disk. 3. Add pterm, ftp, and a clever web page to my local copy of the Audrey file col lection. 4. Regenerate the embedded file system. 5. Put the file system back on the Audrey image, and flash it back to the Audrey. 6. Let the Audrey auto-update itself back to the 1.02.08.01 final version. 7. Run the shell and explore! This description presumes considerable how-to, know-how, and literacy, but it is also a detailed accounting that others should be able to replicate. Without such description, few (if any) consumers would be able to realize any value from the Audrey brand. We argue that value underlies all practices and that engagement in practices is an act of value creation. This insight is intrinsic to explanations of value in traditional society (Mauss [1925] 1990). Simmel ([1907] 1990) sug gested (echoed in Miller 1987, 2005) that it is exchange or interactivity, which is at the origin of both rarity and utility on which modern economic value rests (Ramirez 1999, p. 51). In other words, "the actual values which firms endeavor to manage are thus neither purely subjective ... nor objective,... be they exchange or utility values. They are interactively established" (Dean, Ottensmeyer, and Ramirez 1997, p. 431). We also argue that the consumer who engages in practices is both an op?rant and an operand resource (Vargo and Lusch 2004). On the basis of the fun damental insight that services are the coproduction of value through situationally contingent actions between customer and supplier, we argue that it is of greater value to focus on the array and density of common activities that are produc tive of value. Discussion Using extended ethnographic methods, we unearth 12 prac tices common to an array of brand communities, thus pro viding a catalog that generalizes beyond particular activities documented in case-based studies. We then situate these practices in the extant brand community literature and deconstruct them to better reveal their mechanics. Practices have a common "anatomy" and varied "physiology" evinc ing discursive knowledge, or explicit procedures for doing; know-how and tacit elements, or taken-for-granted knowl edge of worthy projects; and affective commitments to brand-centered practices, as well as intra- and interthematic linkages. We find that practices evidence remarkable con sistency in a range of product category classifications. Prac tices foster consumption opportunities and create value for both consumers and marketers. Our study offers insights into collaborative consumption and value creation in brand communities, organizes the current knowledge of collective brand-based actions, and suggests what is needed to support collaboration. Theoretical Contributions Prior literature has not systematically analyzed collective value creation or used consistent terminology ("practices" and "collective action") or methods for uncovering insights (e.g., prolonged research engagement, participant observa tion, netnography, interviews). Still, across disparate and noncomparable studies, we find considerable evidence that the practices we catalog here occur in the data sets of other published articles in marketing and consumer research. Likewise, previous studies on the production of value in brand communities have tended to focus on the idiosyn crasies of individual communities (Kozinets 2001; Leigh, Peters, and Shelton 2006; Schouten and McAlexander 1995). Our examination of collective value creation in brand communities is distinguished from the current accu mulated knowledge of brand-based collectives in three important ways: (1) We move beyond the prior literature's examination of a brand community single case study or even comparative brand community studies to achieve a taxonomy of common collective actions that are present across communities centered on a wide range of products and services; (2) using practice theory, we catalog the col lective actions in our data and prior published studies, which have three integrative anatomical parts (understand ings, procedures, and engagements); and (3) we offer ways collaborative value creation can be fostered and nurtured in the marketplace through practices in brand communities. Our research suggests aspects of practice that each research 40 / Journal of Marketing, September 2009</page><page sequence="12">stream has ignored but might fruitfully incorporate in the future. Our study resolves some limitations in prior research. For example, Bagozzi and Dholakia (2006) find that only a tiny fraction of the variance in brand identification is accounted for by social identity value. We suggest that this is because social identity value is only a fraction of the val ues realized in brand communities. Similarly, Algesheimer, Dholakia, and Herrmann (2005) show that consumers' rela tionship with the brand is often a function of a host of indi vidualistic factors. The practice perspective in our work indicates that such uninspiring findings may derive from a focus on individual differences and subjective utilities. In contrast, our findings show how knowledge is transferred from insiders to initiates?that is, how "people come to an understanding of what is required by the practice and their role within it" (Warde 2005, p. 148). Our research suggests that through apprenticeship in specific practices and learn ing of intra- and interthematic relationships, newcomers are created as members through their progressive appropriation of practices (Duguid 2005; Reckwitz 2002). More specifi cally, our research goes beyond the study of knowledge exchange (Anand, Gardner, and Morris 2007; 0sterlund and Carlile 2005) to the creation of value through customer engagement. This is an aspect not explored in the extant lit erature on practices and is only hinted at in user innovation research (Franke and Piller 2004). Thus, our research pro vides a significant and beneficial contribution from both a managerial and an academic perspective. Our research supports three emerging perspectives in marketing: (1) Value is manifest in the collective enactment of practices, which favor investments in networks rather than firm-consumer dyads; (2) ceding control to customers enhances consumer engagement and builds brand equity (Cova, Pace, and Park 2007); and (3) firms derive added brand value by creatively using willing customer (op?rant) resources (Vargo and Lusch 2004). Our research shows that healthy brand communities have a presence in all practice areas shown in Figure 1 and a depth within practices that fosters prolonged engagement. The most successful brand communities continuously evolve and encourage collabora tive brand engagement, and practices that stagnate are modified or replaced by those that are vibrant and dynamic. Managerial Implications Our research demonstrates that if firms give consumers the opportunity to construct brand communities and the free dom to modify their products, they will. Therefore, we argue that companies should provide customers with the opportunities and materials with which to welcome, badge, document, milestone, evangelize, and so forth. We argue that if more practices lead to a stronger brand community, marketers should strive to encourage greater diversity in practices because these multiple opportunities serve to cul tivate these markets. Our findings illuminate opportunities to grow, not simply exploit, "customer competence" (Praha lad and Ramaswamy 2000) and, thereby, to build more cocreative (Vargo and Lusch 2005) brand partners. This research reaffirms the importance of encouraging practices among brand communities. More significantly, it suggests how. Companies that want to encourage cocreation should foster a broad array of practices, not merely customization, as is the current focus (Etgar 2008; Franke and Piller 2004; Priigl and Schreier 2006; Von Hippie 2005). The Twilight Saga, a set of books by Stephenie Meyer, illustrates the art of collaborative value creation by inspiring the development of collective practices. Unlike the Harry Potter series, which also strongly resonates with young adults, Meyer and her publisher have at every stage of their promotional cam paign encouraged collaborative product use. Though per haps unaware of the full potential we find in our study, they encourage the practices we have identified. An official Web site equipped with forums invites welcoming, evangelizing, and justifying among readers. By setting up subcommuni ties such as Twilight Mothers, the brand encourages staking and social differentiation among the fan base. Through threads in which fans are asked to share a broad range of thoughts on politics, spirituality, and philosophy, the official Web site encourages empathizing. Through creation of a set of escalating patterns of engagement in the brand and the site, the corporate host creates and inspires milestoning, badging, and documenting. Through fan-fiction contests, the brand supports customizing. Through tips on how to store signed or first-run copies, the publisher inspires grooming. The only practice the Twilight brand does not openly advocate is commoditizing. The brand community has gone off-site to pursue commoditizing, with Twilight inspired jewelry and artifacts for sale on eBay and paid distribution of Twilight newsletters that promote fan-run events that often charge a fee. Our findings suggest that there are specific recipes for managers to follow to foster brand community. One simple managerial tactic is seeding practices. For example, a firm might find that it has a brand-centered community that has evolved brand use practices but few, if any, social network ing practices. To ensure the health of the brand community, our research suggests that the firm should foster or sponsor social networking practices to build and sustain the commu nity and to inspire further cocreation. Given that practices are emergent and become self-perpetuating in organic brand communities, such as Newton, Xena, and others, marketers should be able to encourage their development. Agents of the marketer could initiate basic practices in a brand centered forum, documenting any modifications they make, or as in the Mini community, aftermarket providers could be encouraged to offer up various brand-centered customiz ing (racing modifications), grooming (detailing techniques), and documenting practices (e.g., transportation tracking utilities). Such approaches should be predicated on condi tions of transparency rather than furtive lurking and "astro turf" creation. In other words, the marketer's agents need to disclose their affiliation to reduce the likelihood that con sumer market distancing/commoditizing practices would exclude the marketer or keep the marketer at arm's length. In a more complex move, marketers could foster com munity engagement by encouraging the interacting prac tices to promote engagement. We demonstrate that when combined with badging as part of documenting brand use, milestoning leads to increased community engagement. How Brand Community Practices Create Value / 41</page><page sequence="13">Marketers could encourage this tripartite constellation of practices by giving away branded journals in which con sumers can record their experience. To facilitate brand use practices such as customizing, firms could create a Web site that allows consumers to tweak the brand logos to suit their own color schemes or to include owner name or initials, perhaps going so far as to sell customized brand logos and automobile hood badges. This research provides guidance for new product devel opment. New product development requires two types of information: information on customer desires and informa tion on how to best satisfy them (Thomke and Von Hippel 2002; Von Hippel 2005). A focus on practices reveals both. The development of a practice frequently follows the identi fication of a thwarted desire or high-fidelity need (Von Hip pel 2005): a way to combine StriVectin with makeup, a way to identify all Starbucks stores in an area (Garmin), a chan nel to express one's independent musical vision (Jones Independent Music), or a way to give the Mini the show room shine off-the-shelf options do not provide. The emer gence of the practice reveals the desire. The evolution of the practice reveals information on how to satisfy that need. Firms might wisely condone the most successful consumer created aftermarket practices, perhaps going so far as to release official branded versions of the formulas devised through community beta testing. Firms might also want to cobrand with the community in these efforts. A focus on practices, particularly with a long-term orientation, provides marketers with a better vantage on high-fidelity needs than the typical focus on low-fidelity needs (O'Hern and Rindfleisch 2007). Community par ticipants' needs develop from the relatively low-fidelity needs of the newbie to the high-fidelity needs evident among "6th Gear" Mini members, experienced Xena con tent creators, or Audrey, Newton, and Garmin software developers. Companies such as Harley-Davidson that have experienced some stagnation in brand value might use such insights to identify unexploited high-fidelity needs to build out underserved markets (see, e.g., Martin, Schouten, and McAlexander 2006). Finally, companies such as L'Oreal that have developed a conversational model of relating to customers segmented on their degree of creative involve ment could structure and develop high-fidelity "content" for these conversations through the practices framework (Dias 2008). Further Research Although we identified 12 practices common to nine brand communities and found evidence of these practices lurking in prior literature, we hope to inspire researchers to return to the data sets we assessed or collect new data to unpack the operation of a broader set of practices as they appear in a wider array of brand communities. Such research might lead to a greater understanding of the necessary and suffi cient conditions for brand community vitality and deepen the theoretical understanding of how value is created. When can firms successfully encourage value-creating practices to achieve strategic goals? Which practices or constellations of practices are most likely to yield significant value and under what conditions? Why do some vital communities success fully emphasize social networking and community engage ment (Moisio and Beruchashvili, in press), and others brand use (Mathwick, Wiertz, and De Ruyter 2008)? How do some communities successfully attract and engage partici pants, while others do not? Refining understandings of value-creating practices in existing brand communities should prove useful in creating novel strategies that further leverage the collaborative tendencies of marketplace actors. 42 / Journal of Marketing, September 2009</page><page sequence="14">o a E CO x UJ o ! o (0 o O) o ts ? ?-S O) = &gt;&gt; &lt;0 "c0 ? co a) co &amp;S! &gt; ?o ?

The community must actively recruit and retain users because 3Com has abandoned Audrey. Welcoming potential and new users to the fold is an important practice. The procedures for welcoming are laid out in the Audrey community: lead the newbies to the FAQs (frequently asked questions). This is where a newbie "ought to start." The Apple Newton is a product in a state of marketplace abandonment for nine years, and it is in real danger of attrition or of parts breaking and the whole not working. It is facing extinction. This threat inspires empathizing practices. For users, stories of battery miracles are empathizing practices because they mitigate the threat of extinction. Users recite the rites to be used when the battery has "died," providing solutions and emotional support for those who experience battery failure. Spreading the word takes the form of consumer-generated content. Procedures include development of tertiary texts (Fiske 1987)?stories that fill in narrative gaps. For example, 48 episodes of "shipper seasons" deal with the Xena-Ares relationship, 36 episodes of "xwm" seasons fill out the lesbian subtext; fiction "challenges" invite writers to imagine alternative endings or points of view; genres such as "?ber" take essential character elements and transplant them to other times and places. Postshow "seasons" production details are explained online. Feedback is solicited. Consistency with show plotlines and relational entanglements tend to be worked out on chat page discussions of favorite episodes and assessments of the true meaning of events and relationships. Procedures include proving the ability to perform in more mainstream, photographic genres. Users of Lomo and Holga justify their devotion to the toy camera by demonstrating that they can/do use more technologically sophisticated cameras but find merit in the quirkiness of the Lomo and Holga effects. Lomo and Holga users often post galleries of their lomography and their more traditionally oriented photography interlinked. Knowledge of what to say and do; skills and projects, sometimes called "know how" (i.e., tacit cultural templates for understanding and action). Audrey users understand that to inspire continued user developments, the community must attract new users. Converting the newbies to committed use involves welcoming them and making them feel that they are valued in the community. The understanding is that there is some intervention that cannot be fully explained. There is a spirituality embedded in the technology, such that if the correct rites are performed the battery may indeed come back to life. It is understood that the procedures are not fail-safe or that the user must supply efficacy or faith for a successful outcome to be achieved. It is also understood that this can only be accessed by fellow users' support; battery miracles depend on the collective to support one another in performing the rites. Fan-authored "episodes" and other tales must be open-ended and, in general, employ soap opera conventions?for example, hooks and bubble episodes (anachronous and asynchronous tales; dream sequences); feminized narrative forms are emphasized; realism is stressed in the relationships, not in the where or when of events (thus, Hercules, Jesus, and Romans coexist). Understandings include consistency with show plotlines and relational entanglements. Characters conform to Jungian principles. For example, Xena/Ares = anima/animus or union of duality; bad Xena/good Xena and Livia/Eve = shadow/self-duality. Understandings include the presentation of traditional skills to justify the use of their time and effort on a toy camera that was originally intended for novices to capture images. The idiosyncratic image effects are deemed to be more artistic and credible and time and effort outlays more justifiable because the photographer is trained and competent in the traditional methods. Ends and purposes, which are emotionally charged, in the sense that people are attached or committed to them. Engagement in welcoming practices is a community building exercise, correlated to product development as a larger user mass excites innovation. Welcoming is a positively valenced emotional engagement. The engagement rests on the need for the battery as an underlying necessity for product use: "No juice, no use." It also depends on the ability of users to support one another in the rite and the mustering of faith or efficacy. Newton users believe they own and use the best technology available and that it takes a village to keep the Newtons operating. Engagement includes authoring stories that enact value commitments and personalities of the key figures? a proactive version of the passive identity work identified in research on soap operas (Van Evra 1990). Commitments to costuming, conventions, and celebrating the post Xena careers of key stars are also part of the Xenaverse. The emotional engagement rests on the freedom to abandon objective realism. The ability of the photographer to seek the surreal imagery and the fantastical elements of the images. It is spiritual in nature because the effect is idiosyncratic and unpredictable and the outcome is otherworldly. How Brand Community Practices Create Value / 47</page><page sequence="19">APPENDIX B Continued Practice Procedures Understandings Emotional Engagements Milestoning: Fans of TPATH are encouraged to TPATH explicitly mark their concert events anniversaries, and there is a protocol for concert storytelling. The concert stories are real-life events, and the concert must be explicitly interwoven into the fan's larger-life narrative. Unlike documenting, which focuses on the use journey, milestoning focuses on an episode of use and how it is situated into the consumer's life. Badging: Badges provide symbols of Mini experiences associated with the brand or the collectivity. North American Motoring community badges (illustrated in Appendix A) are consistent in shape and style. Knowledge of how to make them is shared online. Badges refer to car colors, to model, to geographic club, or to real-world performances, such as driving a particular rally route in the Rocky Mountains or South Carolina. Documenting: Documenting shares the individual Xena story of the journey of brand collectivity engagement. Documenting focuses on the trajectory of the brand experience and brand relationship. Procedures include recounting a confessional tale about engagement. Family ties play a role in socializing participants in their initial viewing: mom and daughter, older sister and younger sister, perhaps a romantic partner. Grooming: Discourse surrounds how to care for StriVectin the product itself while it is in the consumer's care. These are not mandated or suggested by the manufacturer. For example, consumers are advised to extract the cream from the tube with a clean implement other than a finger tip, most often suggested as a makeup sponge. After the bottle is opened, consumers advise one another to be sure to clean the tube tip before recapping to avoid cream debris/residue on the tube. Consumers even suggest the tool to be a Q-Tip straight from the box to avoid germs. The understanding here is that TPATH is not just a band with catchy music but a band that provides the soundtrack of fans' lives. Various TPATH events anchor the life narratives of fans, and fans who engage in this milestoning practice have an understanding of how to convey their concert stories. They have a jargon, a phrasing, and a manner of interweaving lyrics into life events. Badges are displayed horizontally. Group badges are supplemented by personal emblems. These typically include a humorous or ironic cartoon of car and owner's handle. Northamericanmotoring.com also generates individual badges that vary from "neutral" to "sixth gear" and are understood to represent depth of engagement with the community. Tacit elements pertain to the content of the confessional tales: tales of rejection of Xena and eventual acceptance and tales of errancy and return to Xena. Engagement with Xena is associated with maturity. Engagement also entails appreciation of the complexity of the Xena character and of Xena and Gabrielle's multilayered relationship or Xena and Ares profoundly ambivalent relationship. The emotional ambiguity of the story is not appealing to all. The knowledge the consumers share pertains to the affect of dirt (Mary Douglas's notion of "matter out of place") and germs on the active ingredient in the cream. It situates the product into the cleansing and skin care category (highlighting medicinal and curative associations) rather than to a beauty cream. The skin surface should be clean and dry before application, and the product itself should be extracted by clean, some even suggest sterile, implements. The emotional engagement involves bringing TPATH into the fan's life in an intimate and compelling way. The music is clearly distinguished from background music as a central component in the life stories of fans. Rally badges reflect achievements. "Justacooper" badges reflect a "little engine that could" ethos. Regional club badges speak to more general consciousness of kind and moral commitment. For women, Xena is often named as a role model. For men and women alike, the notion of falling in love with a beautiful "kick-butf woman provides a platform for emotional engagement. The procedures and understandings position the use of the product into a scientific understanding and perhaps enhance the consumer's perception of effectiveness. The emotional engagement rests in the consumer's faith in science as a solution, in which a restorative cream "fountain of youth" is scientifically going to improve the skin's appearance (Tissiers-Desbords and Arnould 2005). Commoditizing: Detailed instructions are posted on the Garmin importance of protecting the Garmin in transit or between uses. Toward that end, there is a practice of consumer produced "snugglies," or protective pouches/sheaths, for the Garmin. The snugglies should be made of soft, smooth material that cannot scratch the Garmin's display face. Microfiber fabrics, such as those made to clean eye glasses, are most preferred. Instructions for how to sew these fabrics are explicitly laid out. These snugglies are deemed by the community to be far superior to any Garmin accessories on the market. The understanding here is that the Garmin's face is anthropomorphized and described within the community as fragile. This is not a manufacturer assertion. Unlike eye glasses, which consumers liken the Garmin display to be, the Garmin's screen is touch driven, or made for tactile manipulation. As such, it is not objectively fragile or easily scratched. Within the community, Garmin's screen is vulnerable and must be protected with aftermarket, user generated snugglies. The emotional engagement stems from the sense that Garmin assists the users in locating themselves and their destinations and protecting them from becoming lost and from danger and embarrassment, and in turn the users protect the screen when it is not in use or is in transit. The emotional relationship is made reciprocal through the anthropomorphism and creation of gentle protective sheaths. 48 / Journal of Marketing, September 2009</page><page sequence="20">APPENDIX B Continued Practice Procedures Understandings Emotional Engagements Consumers who successfully produce snugglies are encouraged to sell these online within the community. Notably, these user-created sheaths are even suggested for use with the Garmin accessory units or carrying cases. Customizing: There are explicit rules for entering the Jones label contest, including instructions for Soda what images are acceptable (e.g., no pornography or other illegal behavior depicted, size and resolution parameters). All photograph submissions must include a model release and a photographer release to be entered in the contest. Each submission has a six-month active voting period before it is archived. Images may be reposted. Votes are tallied and adjusted for computer and IP address, meaning that people cannot vote multiple times for a submission. In contrast, photographs for customized labels do not require the legal releases but must conform to the size and resolution parameters. The contest participants understand that they publicly post their submission on the official Jones Soda site and must garner the support of the community to win placement on a Jones Soda label. They campaign for their images on the site through agreed-on cultural templates (e.g., inserting a Vote Jones button that directs voters to a submission in an e mail distributed to friends; posting a message on the Jones forums, including the Vote Jones button; setting up a personal Web site/blog that contains the Vote Jones button). Though not formally stated, the Vote Jones button is tacitly understood to accompany all vote solicitations. This button indicates the official status of the label submission and ensures proper content for potential viewers (e.g., no pornography). There is no mechanism in place to prohibit promoting your submission without the Vote Jones button. In contrast, the customizable label submissions do not get vetted through a community vote, nor must they be posted in any publicly accessible domain. Contest participants vie for a community distinction of having a "label run," in which their label is featured on a publicly distributed Jones Soda bottle for a specified duration. This "prize," though it contains no cash award or even a product, is a highly desired community distinction. Those with labels chosen for public distribution become part of the coveted "rare Jones Soda bottles" that consumers find off the street, collect, and trade. Emotional engagement is palpable in the contest and on the forums in which consumers query others as to whether their label has been spotted, discuss label winners, and trade spotted bottles. In contrast, the customizable labels are charged with a different emotional engagement, in which consumers create the labels, knowing that they will have 12 bottles with their labels. They anxiously await delivery and plan the gifting/use of their bottles. Some purchase runs for special occasions, adding the personalized labels to weddings, graduations, birthdays, and so forth.
