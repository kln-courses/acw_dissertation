<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME HISTORICAL STEPS TOWARDS PARALLELISM' THE function of psycho-physical parallelism within psychology is somewhat indeterminate. Now and then it is declared ac- ceptable as a working hypothesis. It permits a systematic correla- tion of subjective experience with observable conditions. The utility ascribed to the hypothesis depends in part upon the type of psy- chology to which reference is made. Its employment may be advocated in order that the psychologist may escape from the meta- physical problem of the relation between mind and body. To other psychologists the hypothesis is merely an historical monument. referring to the day when psychology had not secured its freedom from metaphysics. Whatever attitude toward parallelism a psychologist may take, he is tacitly recognizing that the hypothesis is not the creation of psychological inquiry. The doctrine was not formulated to organize results attained by specific psychological investigations. On the contrary, it expresses the general metaphysical position under the auspices of which modern psychological inquiry attained its alleged independence. Parallelism affords a striking instance of the con- trolling power of metaphysical ideas and their consequences for scientific enterprises. Parallelism emerged from an intricate context within which occurred an interplay of epistemological, metaphysical, and theological influences. The hypothesis did not arise from psy- chological inquiry, and it was not formulated for the sake of psychology. On the contrary, it came into being because of an effort to provide a metaphysics for physical science, and its func- tion was metaphysical and even theological. Psychology, as that 1 The term parallelism is used in the sense assigned by MacDougall. He first states that the term is used to denote all doctrines that deny psycho- physical interaction and then gives a stricter account of its meaning. It implies that "physical and psychical processes are equally real; but there is no causal relation between psychical and physical processes; the two series of events, the psychical processes of any mind and the physical processes of the brain with which they are associated, merely accompany one another in time: their relation is one of simple concomitance only. . . . Within each series the law of causation holds good, the successive steps being related to the pre- ceding and succeeding steps as effects and causes; but no causal links stretch across from one series to the other."

It is a by-product of metaphysical, theological, and methodo- logical interests in the science of physical nature. It must be recognized that parallelism is a specifically modern doctrine. It is neither mediaeval nor ancient, just as the physics with which it must be associated is neither mediaeval nor ancient. The doctrine usually taken as the opponent of parallelism, that is, interactionism, is likewise essentially modern. Neither psycho- physical parallelism, nor the hypothesis of the interaction of soul and body, could come into being until the Cartesian doctrine con- cerning body and soul had been formulated. Beneath these hypotheses lie the fundamental ideas of modern physical science. Animism has, of course, a long history. Descartes, reckoning with a new program for a universal science of nature, revised in radical fashion the animistic tradition. The setting within which psy- chological inquiry must be established was defined by these condi- tions. Reflection sought to make adjustments between the revised tradition, the new scientific conceptions, and ethico-theological interests. These adjustments determined what a positive study of mind, of consciousness, or of subjective experience must be. It is not too much to assert that psychology had to be whatever the new physics and the related metaphysics permitted it to be. Until recent times at least it preserved in its terminology and methods the in- fluence of these adjustments. Psycho-physical parallelism appeared when the denial of interaction between soul and body emerged in the development of the Cartesian tradition. This denial may be viewed both as a consequence of metaphysics and as a demand for metaphysics. In either event, psycho-physical parallelism appeared as a device for satisfying the demands of metaphysics and theo- logy in the context of a new physics. Psycho-physical parallelism, then, assumed a double role: it purported to be a solution of the body-mind problem; and it served to define the province and the problem of psychology. Here and there, of course, psychological investigations reflected positions opposed to the Cartesian. But even in such cases the general context was maintained. In all quarters the situation was fundamentally the same. The problem was that of adjusting the</page><page sequence="3">546 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIV. new view of nature with the animistic tradition and its associated interests. The parallelistic hypothesis was not attained in a single step. We may discern, within the Cartesian tradition, a series of approx- imations to the hypothesis. It is the purpose of this essay to indicate some of the steps that prepared the way for the statement of the hypothesis.2 In this way, perhaps, light may be thrown upon the historical function of the hypothesis in the development of psy- chology. The psychologist who adopts psycho-physical parallelism as a device for escaping metaphysics presents an interesting para- dox. By a curious inversion, he seeks to avoid metaphysics by adopting a metaphysics. The metaphysical problem the psychologist wishes to avoid is that usually described as the body-mind problem. More specifically, it is the perplexities of interactionism from which he seeks relief. The psychologist's effort points to an important historical fact, to the fact that parallelism is itself a reaction against interactionism. When the animistic tradition was revised by Descartes, all ques- tions concerning the relation of mind and body were of necessity re-formulated. The reformulation, however, made the interaction of body and soul less rather than more intelligible. Psycho-physical parallelism emerged precisely in the measure in which this came to be recognized. The movement towards parallelism, then, is a consequence of the new ideas of which Cartesianism is the outstanding expression. In Descartes' work traditional terminology received new meanings. More than one of his followers, and some of his opponents, recog- nized this. Some of the Cartesians, indeed, felt the need of em- phasizing this. The Cartesian definitions of spirit and matter, of soul and body, of what it means to be 'objective' or 'subjective', were regarded as new definitions. It is misleading to assume equivalences between Cartesian and mediaeval uses of the same or 2 This paper is based primarily upon a study of the Cartesian tradition as represented in the work of certain followers and opponents.

Descartes' philosophy is of course in the Augustinian tradition. We must emphasize, however, that his followers, even when recognizing this continuity, were keenly aware that it must not be over-emphasized. To think with Descartes, they knew, meant to think in new ways, in terms of new ideas, and in an unfamiliar terminological context. Louis de la Forge, for ex- ample, makes this abundantly clear.3 Hitherto, he maintains, the ideas of Descartes concerning spirit, mind, matter, the soul, may have been anticipated-particularly in the tradition coming from Plato through Augustine-but anticipation was not attainment. De la Forge admits that St. Augustine, for example, did not make the mistake of confusing spirit with the animal spirit or of identifying processes in the brain with processes in the mind. He urges, however, with equal emphasis, that Augustine did not arrive at the Cartesian truths concerning the soul and mind. De la Forge's reason for this judgment is of the first importance for understand- ing the place and influence of the Cartesian philosophy in its con- temporary setting. The novelty of the latter philosophy, as de la Forge makes clear, lay precisely in this, that Descartes for the first time in history had achieved an adequate, a true, definition of matter. The ideas concerning the soul prevailing in any period in the past had reflected the conception of matter then commanding acceptance. Not even St. Augustine, spiritual forebear of Descartes that he was, had a sound notion of the soul for just the reason that he had not known what matter truly is. All the more would it be the case that outside the Augustinian tradition this failure occurred. The attitude of most Cartesian followers may safely be described in some such way as this: You cannot attribute to a philosophy in the past a Cartesian conception of mind !or spirit or soul unless you can equally attribute a Cartesian definition of matter to the same philosophy. The definition of matter is, however, the crucial point of the new philosophy, defining the context within which its terms must be comprehended. Therefore, since no one before Des- cartes knew what matter is, no one knew what mind, or soul, or spirit, or thought are. Thus reflection in Cartesian circles was aware of this dissimi- 8The paper on de la Forge may be consulted for a more extended discus- sion of this point.</page><page sequence="5">548 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIV. larity of contexts within which terms received definition.4 For the convinced Cartesian mediaeval conceptions of matter and form and of their union in a substance, that is, a thing, were doubly confused. The mediaevalist might say: a physical thing is corporeal, constituted by the compresence of form (or forms) and matter. The form then, as the component of a thing, is physical, but not material. Indeed, for such a thinker as St. Bonaventura, matter is not necessarily corporeal or 'physical'. It is corporeal and a com- ponent of a physical thing if it be informed by the form of cor- poreality or a 'corporeal' form; united with a different form, matter may be incorporeal-a soul or an angel. For a Cartesian, however, all of this would indicate that before Descartes no one had a clear idea as to the nature of matter and consequently could not define a soul. We have adequate ideas of both matter and spirit- and then we have Cartesian ideas-or we have adequate ideas of neither. In the new context mind and matter are each substances, possess- ing essential attributes. So diverse are these attributes that mind and matter-substance are mutually exclusive and antithetical in properties. In these circumstances, if a thing be said to possess form, then by form we must mean the configurations to be ex- ploited in a mathematical physics. On the other hand, if by form we are to signify something non-corporeal and non-physical, then a form must be either a spiritual substance or an idea within and de- pendent upon that substance. The point, for the Cartesian as against the opposition, is not that body and soul, matter and spirit, are different, but rather that this difference is one of substance and the two substances, antithetical in property, divide finite existence between them. Contemporaries of every school were prepared to admit a difference between thought, mind, or the soul, and body or matter. In some quarters it was granted that the essence of mind 4The animal-soul controversy makes this abundantly clear. Many Car- tesians insist that, if a soul is a spiritual substance the essence of which is thought, we must mean this whenever we use the term. Hence the dilemma arises with respect to an alleged animal soul: if the animal soul is a soul, then there can be no essential difference between the soul of the animal and the soul of man; if, on the other hand, the alleged animal soul differs sig- nificantly from the human, the expression is meaningless, and there is no animal soul whatever. Either animals are combinations of soul and body- and so are identical in principle with man-or else they have no soul in any sensible employment of the term. In the latter case, it is reasonable to view them as machines. Regis makes this point emphatically.</page><page sequence="6">No. 6.] STEPS TOWARDS PARALLELISM 549 might be thought, and yet thinking might be a function of matter.5 The Aristoteleans might assert the incorporeality of the rational soul, while urging that the vegetative and sensitive souls were func- tions of corporeality. For the Cartesian this was inadequate, con- fused, and even verbal. Again, wherever the Cartesian influence penetrated, there came recognition of the confusions due to the long tradition defining spirit as subtle matter. This notion, associated with that of the animal spirits, eased body-mind difficulties for some contemporaries. For a Cartesian, however, attenuation can- not define incorporeality. If potency and act are to receive Car- tesian meanings, then the terms will mean one thing with respect to matter-substance, and another with respect to spirit. Between matter and spirit there can be no tertium quid. Existence is never both matter and spirit, but always either one or the other. This in itself expresses the radical difference of context between Scholasticism and the Cartesian point of view. The new context, as Cartesians realized, gave man a place within creation that is startling and unique. Nothing can be both matter and spirit. Nevertheless, man is both. He is therefore a unity of composition and not a unity of nature. Man alone represents this compresence of substances. Since the animals are machines, they do not possess souls. Or, what amounts to the same thing, since animals have no souls, they are machines. Only in man are thought and nature conjoined. From this fact there follow important con- sequences. A problem which involves questions concerning thought or incorporeal being can be solved only by a study of man. The human being thus becomes the central fact for epistemology, meta- physics and theology. Or, stating the point more accurately, the soul and its conjunction with an animal body is this central fact. For this reason the Cartesian frequently defines metaphysics as the study of spiritual beings. Metaphysics in some sense is confined to the human soul, the angels and God. In this the Cartesians were consistent enough. Metaphysics does not grow out of, or form a superstructure, for physics. Theology and metaphysics furnish a 6 For an illustration, see Objections II. ' Bayle warns the learned world not to be misled by the word 'spirit'. The 'spirits' of the 'chymists', and the animal spirits in the nerves, or subtle mat- ter, denote matter in the same sense in which water or minerals are said to be material. Bayle must have felt that the caution was needed.</page><page sequence="7">550 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIV. basis for physics. In a sense, physics deals with whatever is ex- cluded from metaphysics, once the field of physics and the validity of the enterprise have received metaphysical confirmation. Thus the human body, the plants and animals, are merely portions of the subject-matter of physics. Their significance for metaphysics is indirect. Their metaphysical interest is absorbed into the general interest of physics for metaphysics and theology . This, however, is not the whole story. The study of man, in the end, must provide the means for an account of the relation of nature and spirit, for in man alone do these two come together. The adjustment of physical science to the claims of morality, religion and theology depends upon the study of man. Physics by itself is incapable of throwing light upon the problem. It may discover that nature is mechanism-but can never discover that mechanism is evidence of the existence of God. Metaphysics, surveying the soul and its junction with matter, must evaluate physics for theological uses. Metaphysics, then, centering upon the investigation of the soul, becomes the enterprise of adjusting the claims of science and the demands of morality and religion. The consequences are not yet exhausted. The Cartesian context imposes the problem of discovering a new content for the old terms. Nature, now defined in terms of the new conception of matter, cannot directly contribute to the discovery of spirit. In a hopelessly negative sense, physics may assure us that 'mind', 'soul' and 'spirit', possess meanings antithetical to the meaning of matter. Thus we know that spirit is unextended; we know that, if cor- poreality means extension, then spirit is incorporeal. A positive content for the terms, however, can be found only by a scrutiny of immediate experience. The test of what belongs to spiritual sub- 'The controversy concerning the animal soul is peculiarly illuminating with respect to contemporary attitudes. Concerning such questions as to how animals could get along without souls, or the purposive functioning of animal bodies, science could be content with mechanism. There was an aggravating problem, with respect to man-i.e., what the possession of a sould could contribute to the career of man's body-and the defenders of animal souls were not slow to charge that, if brutes could dispense with souls, then man too does not need an additional substance. The argument was powerful, for it would be impious to set limits to God's competence as a designer of machines. But such arguments were really devices of contro- versy. For the true Cartesian what animals and the human body are is the question of science. Animals are not thinkers or knowers. If nature as a machine with its own laws can be understood as the product of a designing God, then the life of organized bodies presents no difficulty in principle.</page><page sequence="8">No. 6.] STEPS TOWARDS PARALLELISM 551 stance must be found in immediate experience. Spirit or mind is the thing that thinks, and this thing that thinks exhibits its nature not in thinking alone but also in sensing, feeling and willing. The study of spirit is not the investigation of form and logical structure, but the apprehension of the contents of consciousness. This is cer- tainly not what Descartes had in mind in the First Meditation- but it is what he reached in the Sixth. And with this the point of departure for a Cartesian was fixed. Thus we perceive how Descartes, writing a metaphysics that should insure a universal science of nature, produced the psycho- physical problem. The problem of man, of this exceptional unity of composition, is that of discovering how consciousness and things, how immediate experience and an alien world of objects, how personality and mechanism, can be related. The question must be resolved upon the dualistic foundation and not despite it. More- over, the question is real: for the conviction is somehow rooted in the facts. Indeed, only if man be a unity is it possible to understand how consciousness could discover the outer world and the soul become convinced that it has a body. Given these conditions, what is the central point upon which a science and a metaphysics of man must be pivoted? It is this: the substantial components of man's nature retain that characteristic of independence which is the very mark of substance. A unity of composition-which means an external unity-must take the form of a precise inter-adjustment of components without prejudice to the essential and mutual exclusiveness of spiritual and material substances. Experience forces upon us the conviction that mind influences body and body influences mind. At least these words describe even to common sense an almost inevitable belief. Since Descartes has discovered at last what mind is and what body, it is now possible to discover also the facts represented, with or without distortion, in the belief. Beneath this belief lies a unity of compo- sition, and the belief must reflect an interrelation between com- ponent substances. A Cartesian, Louis de la Forge or any other, must view the situation in this light. The exact point, however, has not yet been precisely stated. We must add that each soul or mind is the soul or mind of somebody; it is a consciousness or self, or the substantial basis of a conscious-</page><page sequence="9">552 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIV. ness or self. Moreover, each soul seems to be in possesion, not of a body, but of the, of its, body. A soul's relation to the world of things is exclusively by way of a particular body. In perceiving, in thinking, feeling and willing and in every spiritual activity, Peter's mind is engaged with contents that somehow reflect the career, the organization and the environment of Peter's body, and not of body in general or of some other soul's body, let us say, Paul's. Bergson has described the fact in defining the body as a privileged image. There may be events in Peter's body that are not reflected in Peter's soul; and possibly there are occurrences within Peter's spiritual substance owning no relation to Peter's body. But these exceptions, if they exist, do not affect the conclusion that the unity of composition must be at least a partial and systematic relation between one sort of events and another. The unity implies a con- formity, or, to use a favored expression of the Cartesians, a proportionality between the components of the composition. It is a functional cooperation or correlation. Metaphysical principles lead us to account for the commonsense belief by pointing to the necessity for such a definition of the unity of composition. In re- turn, from the popular belief so grounded we must pass back to a metaphysical and theological completion of the explanation. We may regard the pineal-gland theory as a deus ex machinc. It was derided by Descartes' Peripatetic opponents-on their principles such an hypothesis was neither necessary nor intelligible. But Car- tesians could not deride it: the god from the machine is the evi- dence of God. Even for Locke, for whom matter may conceivably be the seat of thought, the adjustment of immediate experience to what he regarded as the disclosures of science defined a similar problem of correlation. His 'constant correspondence' represents what hap- pens when the notion of substance is omitted from the context of thought. Between the conditions, we know not what, existing in the minute parts of the primary qualities of things themselves, and the secondary qualities within us (whatever this expression may finally mean), there obtains a constant correspondence. This doctrine in- terprets in its way the irresistible conviction of common sense. Cartesian metaphysics explicitly complicates the question. If we are to have a science of man, we must take account of three things:</page><page sequence="10">No. 6.] STEPS TOWARDS PARALLELISM 553 (i) the interactions of (other material) things and the human body, which is a subdivision of physics; (2) the happenings within the human body, and this again is a portion of a universal science of nature; (3) the events arising within spiritual substance and deriving their specific character from this source. Even with this, however, our science of man is far from complete. For the mind seems to have a body; and the human body at least seems to have a mind. It is not then sufficient to study the bodily events and the spiritual events each in their own terms. The unity of man is thus resolved into a system of specific inter-influences (by way of the pineal gland, perhaps) or of specific correlations. If there are inter- actions, and these occur by way of the gland, then extended ex- planation involves the argument from the machine to God. If there are no interactions, but only correlations, then again complete ex- planation is teleological in a somewhat more circuitous manner. Experience suggests the problem; metaphysics is responsible for the form it takes. And metaphysics-or, by extension, theology- must solve it. From the standpoint of this metaphysics, be it noted, there can be no empirical solution of the problem. Experience, from this standpoint, is just what needs explanation. The Carte- sians became fully aware of the precise locus of the difficulty. From the accepted fact that man is a unity of composition whose terms are two antithetical substances, nothing whatever can be inferred concerning either spiritual or physical events or their interrela- tion. Moreover, the event in spiritual substance-the conscious state or immediate experience-tells us nothing whatever concern- ing things or events in the other substance. And finally, our (physical) knowledge of bodily occurrences tells us neither that there must be some correlative event in the soul-substance, nor what that event must be. The Cartesians saw this clearly. The problem, they recognized, is defined by specific correlation. The animal spirits, following one channel, coincide with the immediate experience of a toothache; following another nerve-pathway, the specific correlate in conscious experience is a blue color-sensation. Throughout the range of neurological and conscious events, the correlation of the one type of event with the other is specific and theoretically constant. But this cannot be made intelligible from the nature of the animal spirits alone, nor from the character of con-</page><page sequence="11">554 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIV. scious experience alone. The animal spirits certainly cannot be responsible for this specificity of correlation, for within the animals the operations of the spirits have no correlated event whatever. Ordinary human experience, however, suggests almost irresistibly the principle of exact proportionality or of constant specific corre- lation. Granting that there are two components in the nature of man; granting that these components are as the Cartesians defined them; then experience convinces us that the correlation between the two sets of events is not sporadic and unpredictable, but systematic and theoretically predictable. Were this not the case, a Cartesian would have no problem of the external world. The clear and distinct idea of spiritual substance affords no information concern- ing matter; the idea of matter does not involve the idea of spirit. Were we limited to a conscious state, the Cartesians implied, and to this alone, we should never suspect that the animal spirits course through the nerve-tubes. Were we somehow limited to a contemplation of physiological events, we should never suspect that sensations and feelings happen within finite existence. That a man, being hungry, should seek food is a fact that contains no mysteries for common sense. In a deeply serious sense, however, for a Car- tesian the fact that a man, needing food, should not merely seek food, but should feel hunger, not envy or anger, is deeply mysteri- ous. It is so mysterious that theology alone can provide a clue. A Cartesian, beating his dog, must admire the skillful contrivance of God in that there should be so curious a similarity of action between the beaten dog and the beaten man, while there exists so profound a difference in the natures of the two creatures. How can a body need a soul, since with lowlier bodies souls are dispensable? And how can a soul need a body since a soul is a finite substance and by fact is defined as independent of everything save God? The anti- Cartesians exploited this to the utmost, and a Cartesian's charge of verbalism directed against a scholastic's forms was neatly coun- tered by Peripatetic derision of a wholly superfluous soul.8 From these perplexities there was a sole avenue of escape for the Cartesian. The proportionality of body and soul must be ascribed to the competence of God as creator. Moreover, this proportionality must itself be defined as an aim involved in divine 8 Cf. the paper on the Animal Soul, referred to in note 2.</page><page sequence="12">No. 6.] STEPS TOWARDS PARALLELISM 555 purpose. And finally, the unity of composition, having been resolved into and virtually supplanted by the idea of proportionality, must be further transformed into a law of correlation. This having been accomplished, the notion of substance may be permitted to vanish from the context of science. Leaving Descartes himself, let us turn to the efforts of his followers. Controversy revealed quickly the artificiality of the pineal-gland theory.9 It was perplexing for a Cartesian to know how to remain a Cartesian and escape artificiality. Let us summa- rize fully the factors defining his problem: (i) A correlation, harmony, fitness or proportionality of body and soul is suggested by experience and demanded by piety. (2) This correlation or proportionality is not necessarily com- plete. Obviously it must obtain with respect to sense-experience, its derivatives in memory and imagination, and also with respect to certain voluntary activities expressive of sense-experience. (3) We have adequate ideas of spiritual and material sub- stance. No relationship of body and soul can be deduced from these ideas alone. The master's interactionism expressed rather than made intelligible commonsense convictions. Moreover, in- teractionism did not imply in any case causal continuity between body and soul. In these conditions the solution of the problem must lie, not within creation, but within the Creator. (4) The soul is a substance: a substance is something more than its states, the momentary activities and manifestations which are born of substance and express its nature, but do not exhaust it. Thinking processes of all sorts express the inner traits and native structure of the soul's substantial reality. But there may be portions of the total mental life which spring from the in- 'The pineal-gland theory did not involve for Descartes an intrusion of mind into nature or of nature into mind because of his principle that the quantity of motion in the universe is a constant. The soul's influence upon the body being limited to a deflection in the direction of the motions of the animal spirits, the quantity of motion remains unaffected. An irregularity in the physical system may be implied: but appearances are saved, for Descartes, by two considerations. In the first place, interaction did not imply that an existential fact changed its essential substantial nature. And again, the interaction of body and soul, even if implying irregularity from the standpoint of the physical system, was in itself a regularity in a more inclu- sive system, embracing human souls and nature within the whole of finite existence.</page><page sequence="13">556 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIV. trinsic energies of the soul-substance and for which there are no correlatives or specific proportionalities within the sphere of the body. Soul and body are in harmony: but there may be within the soul powers and the fruits of powers which lie outside of the system of correlations. Similarly there may reside within the mechanism of the body functions not directly expressed in systematic correlations. These elements, residing outside the proportioning of body and soul in a more limited sense, really fall within this harmony in a deeper meaning. (5) The crux of the body-soul problem is the fact of the con- stancy and specificity of the correlation or harmony of events in the soul and events in the body. The world of matter is a realm of causal law; if an event re-occur, then its consequences will re- occur. The system of correlations is equally a realm of law. If an event, say a sensation of red color, occur within the soul, then there occurs, and always occurs when just this sensation is experienced, a certain specific event in nature. The correlation of event in the soul and event in extra-corporeal nature is not reg- ular; but if we bear in mind that the soul is in harmony, not with nature directly, but with the human body, a portion of nature, and only through this with nature as a whole, then we must assert that the correlation of spiritual and physiological events is constant, specific and systematic. To be quite exact, we must define the relationship as obtaining between the mental occurrence and the behavior of the pineal-gland. But in any case, this is what commonsense belief turns out to be when given sound metaphysical grounds.'0 Man, in essence, lies beyond nature; but, notwithstanding, man's relation to nature can be made intelligible. All that is, is Providential-but this is to say that creation is rationally planned. From this summary we may pass directly to the Cartesians' efforts to meet its difficulties. Out of these efforts psycho-physical parallelism emerged. But the doctrine did not come at once, and we can indicate only a portion of the story. The situation above described contained two factors warring against one another. Two substances define two types of existence, 0 These points are illustrated in detail in the papers referred to above, note 2.</page><page sequence="14">No. 6.] STEPS TOWARDS PARALLELISM 557 which we may call for the sake of brevity psychical or spiritual states and physical or material states. In so far as emphasis falls upon the diversity of substantial natures, then the irreducibility and merely external relatedness of the two kinds of existence occupies the f oreground. When interest is empirical, relatedness is of primary importance. The science of man emphasizes the affiliation of events rather than the diversity of them. Moreover, morality demands that the efficacity of the soul be maintained. Knowledge implies that mind can and does deal with things. Most important of all, it is impious to minimize the intimacy of the relation of body and soul; otherwise the Creator would be pictured as a bungler. But even while we emphasize this consideration arising f rom theology, opponent considerations arise. Immortality is imperilled in the measure in which intimate linkage between the soul and the body is emphasized. Descartes had prudently confined himself to the position that, in showing the soul to be of an imperishable sub- stance, he had done all that metaphysics could well do for religious belief. But when it becomes necessary to harmonize a vast struc- ture of science with theology, more explicit and complete adjust- ments are necessary. As nature is resolved into mechanism, per- haps the soul will be resolved into a swarm of mental atoms or its substantial reality be supplanted by a set of psychological laws. The disparateness of Cartesian substances has its obvious advan- tages for supernaturalistic interests. At the same time, we cannot make experience intelligible, and furnish theology with a content to replace revelation, unless a systematic relation obtains between the two substances. Abstractly speaking, the Cartesian substances would be expected to generate, each from within itself and by means of their respective intrinsic resources, phenomena for which all proportionment would be irrelevant. Moreover, if spiritual and material phenomena be not kept rigorously separated, natural sciences would be jeopardized by the undermining of their meta- physical foundations. This situation could be worked out into many details. But enough has been said to indicate the central difficulty: how can the irreducible diversity of substantial natures be retained, with its advantages, while providing the relatedness through which alone man could be included within the sweep of science and the program of social control?</page><page sequence="15">558 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIV. In the main, the efforts of thinkers within the sphere of Cartesian influence were marked by three tendencies. First, the regression of the concept of substance from the foreground of thought and in the end the resolution of the dualism of substances into opponent or- ders of finite events. Secondly, the correlation of psychical and physical existence is defined in terms of occasional causation. Finally, occasional causation is absorbed into theology. There were many considerations-more than can be recounted within the limits of this paper-that led to the restrictions placed upon the meaning of substance, and to the virtual disuse of the concept. Substance implied intrinsic powers or energies. It possessed functions of origination, or active agency. The pictur- esquely labeled souls of tradition-the vegetative, sensitive and rational-were adjusted to the requirements of the Cartesian dualism. If these various souls were represented in the body at all, they must be interpreted as specialized activities of the bodily mechanism. In so far the term 'soul' becomes inappropriate. Car- tesians perceived clearly and stated emphatically that the term 'soul' can mean but one thing, and that is spiritual substance. For Regis, for example, if animals have souls they are unities of com- position and like man; if spiritual substance were lacking, animals are not unities of composition, and there is no sense in which they could be said to possess souls. On the other hand, if the func- tions indicated by such labels, 'vegetative', 'sensitive' and 'rational' souls, deserve the name, then these functions are intrinsic powers or faculties of the spiritual substance. Now the rational soul had proved particularly bothersome, for it possessed capacities or pro- duced effects not directly due to sense-experience and possibly not even dependent upon it. At least for the anti-empiricist this is the case. Within the context of the dualism, the innate idea expresses the revision of this difficulty. Innate ideas are expressions of the inner potencies of the spiritual substance. The range of these origi- nal powers, however, is not easily determined. For example, all abstract ideas may be regarded as innate, in the sense that they reflect primarily the character of spiritual substance itself. Experi- ence, from this point of view, may provide occasions for stim- ulating the soul to an apprehension of its implicit content, but does not account for the coming of these ideas. On the other hand, an</page><page sequence="16">No. 6.] STEPS TOWARDS PARALLELISM 559 idea, whatever its source, is a spiritual state; for even sense, mem- ory and imagination are functions of the soul-substance. Abstract ideas, even innate ideas, possess in this sense no superiority over the most rudimentary idea from sense. And sense, too, is as much an aboriginal function of soul-substance as is the power of forming abstract ideas. The idea from sense in its own way expresses the native energies of the mind as much as does the abstract idea. The Cartesian substantial soul thus engulfs all experience. It is not easy, however, to define the functions of the soul. An intrinsic power for producing innate ideas is no more explanatory of the facts than an aboriginal faculty of sensation. The soul must possess, as substance, all the powers necessary for producing every- thing that idea, experience, mind, consciousness and spirit can signify. With an emphasis such as this, a conflict emerges. The soul, and not the correlation of psychical and physical states, furnishes the clues to experience. On the other hand, the emphasis may fall elsewhere. Inquiry may turn, not upon the intrinsic ener- gies of the spiritual substances as its pivot, but upon the correlation of mind and nature. Then the system of correlation between the psychical and physical orders tends to deflate the notion of sub- stance. If nature is to be understood as a series of events, the mind tends to become just another series .The Cartesians' perplexities are obvious. If the soul, through its native powers, can produce somue ideas without even the need of occasioning excitement through sense-and there were Cartesians who thought this-then its dependence upon association with a body for other states is prejudicial to its substantial status. If the soul be not a substance, it is not a soul at all-at least in a sense that would facilitate the adjustment of theology and philosophy. And if it be a substance, nothing more natural can be assumed than a capacity for producing ideas independently of the system of correlation between the spiritual and the corporeal. Against this wars the recognition that exceptions to the system of correlations or occasional causation threatened the intelligibility of the system itself. In short, the idea of universal occasional causation led to neglect of the notion of substance; and in the place of the intrinsic powers belonging to spiritual and extended substance reflection emphasizes the idea of God's providence. Agency belongs to the Creator.</page><page sequence="17">560 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOTL. XLIV. This situation may be illustrated in some detail. For the early Cartesian, physical science and common sense unite in pointing to a specific correlation between psychical states and bodily events, at least with respect to sense-experience and its derivatives. On the other hand, innate and abstract ideas in their universality seem to express an essential independence of sense-experience. We may represent the Cartesians' point of view somewhat as follows. Ex- perience may be necessary as occasion for the soul's exercise of its higher faculties and the apprehension of a content it possesses because it is rational and spiritual. But the occasioning function of experience is general, not specific, with respect to such ideas. Ideas from sense, on the contrary, are specifically occasioned. If in my body the animal spirits have never run a certain course, then in my soul there has never been a sensation of blue. But, so long as my body is affected by things, and my soul enjoys sensations and per ceptions-it matters little what the things may be and what the sensations are-my soul may respond by discovering within itself the idea of God or the idea of matter. In a general way sense- experience is the occasion for the inner activity which makes explicit the idea of God. But within wide limits one man's sense- experience is as good as another's for this result. The idea of God-or a process of abstract thinking-either has no specific correlate in the course of the animal spirits, or it has no physiolo- gical correlate at all. In either case this activity of soul falls without the system of specific correlation holding in the field of sense, memory and imagination. The man born color-blind can never perceive color, but he may think of God and comprehend that the essence of matter is extension. The spiritual substance thus ex- plains, not merely that ideas, including universals, are spiritual entities, but also that there are universal ideas. On the other hand, this substantial nature enables us to understand why a toothache is a spiritual entity or event, but in no direct sense why toothaches ever occur. This is a new way of denying that everything in the intellect is first in sense. In such ways the effort to relate concretely the physical and the psychical through the system of occasional causation restricts the r6le of substance, and the latter idea in turn limits the extension of the occasionalistic theory. In a quite similar way this competition</page><page sequence="18">No. 6.] STEPS TOWARDS PARALLELISM 56i appears with respect to volitional processes. Are all volitions oc- casioned by or in specific correlation with movements of the animal spirits? There were Cartesians who thought that certain volitions, related to abstract and universal ideas, sprang from the intrinsic powers of the soul-substance, independently of specific bodily occasion. Most volitions are related to sense-experience; with re- spect to these, the system of occasional causation holds. But other volitions, such as those due to the resolution of the will in a moral crisis, seem to transcend the impulsions of appetite as the universal idea seems to transcend the materials of sense. The productive agency of the soul-substance is thus retained. Louis de la Forge illustrates both points. He implies that there are no bodily processes corresponding to certain (innate and abstract) ideas and that there are volitions having no occasions in bodily processes. These ideas and volitions express the innermost being of the soul-substance. This, then, is what remains of the extraordinarily exceptional posi- tion that man, as the sole possessor of a soul, enjoyed in the Car- tesian universe of creation. This position, indeed, is the clue to most of the hesitancies and reservations marking the development of Occasionalism and ex- plains the postponement of an unambiguous psycho-physical paral- lelism. If the problems bequeathed by the Cartesian dualism are to be solved by the concept of occasional causation, the momentum of its logic will carry reflection beyond doctrines such as that of Louis de la Forge. To preserve the unique position of man implied, so it appeared to the Cartesian, a limitation of occasional causation to human experience, and even to a portion of human experience. The first limitation seems anthropomorphic, and the second arbitrary. If in man alone spiritual states are occasioned by bodily processes, this is understandable only upon the condition that man alone possesses soul-substance. That is to say, the maintenance of the substance concept is necessary in order to preserve man's unique position as alone among creatures enjoying psychical being. With this, however, the very meaning of occasioning cause becomes ambiguous. Does the movement of the pineal gland elicit from the soul-substance an activity expressive of the nature of that substance and not in any exact relationship to the movement? Upon a repetition of this movement are we justified in believing</page><page sequence="19">562 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIV. that some activity of the soul-substance will occur, but not neces- sarily a repetition of the psychical process previously elicited by this movement? If this be the actual relationship signified by oc- casional causation, then the unity of composition is not a unity at all, and the relation of soul and body is haphazard. What has be- come of the harmony and proportionality of the components of man which, we have been assured, is expressive of the handiwork of God? The difficulty is sharply defined in the case of volitions. If the soul by its powers resolve an issue and decree a course of action, are we to believe that a certain bodily movement in the pineal gland and no other is occasioned? Or are we to believe only that some movement will occur without certainty as to its ap- propriateness to this very resolution of the will? In the former case the relation of occasional causation seems indistinguishable from interaction. If an activity of the will, because of its specific char- acter, is responsible for the bodily motion being just what it is, then this seems equivalent to the statement that the soul causes the bodily motion. The more the nature of the soul as substance is emphasized, the more we must emphasize its inner springs and spontaneities: and then causal interactionism seems to be de- manded. On the other hand, if we take the second supposition, i.e., that there is no fixed relation between the particular volition and bodily motion, then occasional causation ceases to be causation in any intelligible sense whatever. No orderly connection of soul and body remains, and we cannot speak of the divine laws for the union of soul and body. The predicament was real. With many Cartesians interactionism was regarded as unintelligible. On the other hand, what could be meant by asserting the laws decreed by God for the union of body and soul unless the correlation of movement and conscious state be specific? If divine law govern the union of soul and body, then assuredly movement A is accompanied by psychical state A' and no other; and the recurrence of A must mean the recurrence of A' and not B' or C'. If occasional causation, as the relationship of the bodily and mental, be freed from traces of meaning deriving from the notion of interacting substances, then clearly the unity of man receives a new definition. Man is not a unity of composition, the com- ponents being substances of antithetical properties. The unity of</page><page sequence="20">No. 6.] STEPS TOWARDS PARALLELISM 563 man is not defined by the notion of substance at all, but by some- thing described as the Creator's laws of the union of soul and body. That is to say, we must give a merely conventional meaning to 'soul' and 'body'. The real fact is the systematic correlation of a psychical state with a movement. To assert that by divine law a certain thought arises 'in the soul' upon the occasion of a certain movement 'in the body' deprives substance of spontaneity and agency. In effect, to be 'in the soul' is nothing more than saying that psychical states or conscious processes, or, more exactly, psy- chical events, do occur. In so far as these considerations are pressed, the anthropological dualism dissolves. If the fundamental fact be that, by divine ar- rangement, movement and psychical event are in constant corre- spondence, there is no reason for confining this to man. The analogies between animal and human bodily activities suggest that a similar law obtains throughout; in the animal world too the double series is found, and psychical event accompanies bodily movement. Man is no longer unique amid created things. There is more to be said concerning this situation. There was a danger lurking in the substance notion itself. If we stress the hidden potencies that substance may possess, the Lockean sup- position, that matter may be capable of thought, will appear to be both rationally tenable and economical. But in this direction lies materialism, and such a solution was repugnant to the interests of theology. Moreover, the critique of substance, associated with the empirical movement, was destroying the idea of substance, especial- ly in its definition as an unknown substratum. In the circumstances, it was natural to resolve man's composite nature into the systematic correspondence of two series of events. We have seen indications of the close relation between develop- ments in Cartesianism and theological requirements. With the reso- lution of the dualism of substances into the correlation of two series of events, the situation persisted. In the earlier stages of the movement, difficulties had been surmounted by appeal to the creative competence of God. But arguments based upon divine competence have a slippery way of adjusting themselves to the most diverse positions. Controversy after, Descartes abundantly illustrated this fact. After physical science had defined nature as a</page><page sequence="21">564 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIV. realm of law and things as machines, theology made of these achievements a capital argument for the existence of God. In the same manner, after a universal system of occasional causation had been defined, it was employed for the same purpose. When occa- sional causation, as a system, has become a foundation for theology, the situation changes with respect to the limitations of occasional causation. There is no longer any reason for admitting exceptions to the specific correspondence between psychical and bodily pro- cesses. Physical science had obviated the need of miracles in order to provide evidence for God. In the same way, if the system of occasional causation be grounded upon theology, exceptions to the system would express impiety rather than piety. It is not exception, appeal to obscure potencies of the soul, volitions that have no bodily correlates, which express the craftsmanship and providence of God. Piety forces us to acknowledge that God could have pro- portioned the psychical and physical so perfectly that there should be bodily occasions and correlates for every mental event. Mecha- nism is not in conflict with the notion of final causation; on the contrary, mechanism is the vehicle by means of which divine design is realized. The universality of the correlation of bodily and mental events is then the evidence of a providential perfec- tion of harmony between the spiritual life and mechanism. The unity of creation is found in the universal network of law; the unity of man is found in the special laws governing the relation of psychical state and bodily occurrence. There is, to be sure, a residual difficulty in this, that only some bodily movements are accompanied by spiritual events. This conclusion cannot be avoided after mind, spirit and soul come to mean consciousness, and a substantial substratum is removed from beneath consciousness. This difficulty is all the more perplexing because the spiritual has lost efficacy. Nevertheless, the thought must prevail that in this limitation the wise economy of the Creator is expressed. The vegetative soul, in short, is reduced to bodily mechanism without psychical accompaniment and for reasons of economy. The in- stabilities of this position need not detain us. To preserve the essential disparity of the psychical and the physical, the concep- tion of occasional causation is employed. But the conception itself needs explanation. The irreducibility of the two series does not</page><page sequence="22">No. 6.] STEPS TOWARDS PARALLELISM 565 in itself provide an explanation of their systematic correlation. Neither in the sensation of blue, let us say, nor in the neural pro- cesses that form the occasion for the sensation, do we find ground for the fact that this sensation and this process are specifically in fixed correlation. In Cartesian circles the question is generalized. No connection whatever is intelligible in terms of the events said to be connected. We say (to use an illustration favored by Car- tesians) that the movement of the billiard ball A causes the ball B to move exactly as it does move. This, however, is mere verbal statement. What is given to observation is A's ceasing-to-move and B's beginning-to-move. This is all that causal connection can mean in terms of A and B and their motions. Thus the mystery con- cerning the concurrence of a certain sensation and a certain bodily motion is no greater than the mystery of this other 'correlation'- that physical event A is followed by physical event B, and not by X or Y or Z. In this manner the perplexity is generalized; all causes are occasions; the hidden potencies of material and spiritual substances are banished and replaced by the problem of God's relation to finite existence, of reality to its twofold appearance. These are, in part at least, the conditions within which psycho- physical parallelism was formulated. This essay began with a state- ment to the effect that both interaction and parallelism were peculiarly modern doctrines. It would be more accurate to say, after reflecting upon the preceding sketch, that these doctrines are characteristic products of the inter-play of ideas in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Psychology, as it has been generally un- derstood, emerged as a by-product of the historical situation par- tially outlined above. Assuredly neither the hypothesis of inter- action nor that of parallelism was generated within the context of psychological inquiry or because of the peculiar needs of such in- quiry. Metaphysics arose to justify a growing physical science, to defend the validity of its implicit claims, and to provide a system- atic foundation. As an incident in this program, it appeared that what was left out of physics might be the province of psychology. Interaction and parallelism express the difficulty of determining just what physics does omit-and how what it leaves out is related to what it includes. Descartes, we know, was bewildered by his</page><page sequence="23">566 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW discovery of what the human soul is. Doubtless he was puzzled by the conditions under which a scientific study of it must be under- taken. The Cartesian bewilderment, one suspects, has been strik- ingly persistent throughout the history of modern psychology. When psycho-physical parallelism is defined as merely a working hypothesis for psychology, and all responsibility for the solution of the problem of mind and body is disavowed, resignation seems to replace the Cartesian bewilderment.
