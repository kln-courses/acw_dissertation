<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAR STORY: ALEKSANDAR ZOGRAF'S REGARDS FROM SERBIA AND TOMAZ LAVRIC'S BOSNIAN FABLES Stijn Vervaet, Ghent University Introduction: The Representation of War in Post-Yugoslav Comics The graphic novel is increasingly treated as an extremely valuable medium for understanding problems crucial to the representation of history and trauma.1 In a recent issue of PMLA introducing graphic narrative to a reader ship of literary scholars, Hillary Chute drew attention to "the aesthetics and narrative impact of comics that address history" (452). Arguing that graphic narrative (covering both fiction and non-fiction) constantly urges us to "reex amine the categories of fiction, narrative, and historicity" (452), Chute has put forward some crucial questions concerning the possibilities of comics with regard to the problem of representing history: "How [do] comics expand modes of historical and personal expression while existing in the field of the popular[?]"; "How do contemporary comics approach devastating public his tories?"; and "What is the texture of narrative forms that are relevant to ethi cal representations of history?" (453, 462). Undoubtedly, these questions are all the more relevant for studying the cul tural production of societies that struggle with the memories of a violent past, as is the case with most of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia (the only exceptions, perhaps, are Slovenia and Montenegro), which have gone through years of war as well as social and political turmoil. What is more, some of the best of recent graphic journalism and documentaiy comics deal The author is a research fellow of the Flemish Research Council (FWO-Vlaanderen).

Whereas West European and American comics about the Yugoslav wars (mainly about the war in Bosnia), such as Joe Kubert's Fax from Sarajevo, Hermann's Sara jevo Tango, Andersson and Sjunneson's Bosnian Flat Dog, and particularly Joe Sacco's graphic novels on Bosnia, have attracted critical and scholarly attention around the globe, hardly any scholarly attention has been devoted to the representation of war in the work of contemporary Bosnian, Croatian, Ser bian, and Slovenian comics artists.2 Nevertheless, several authors from the for mer Yugoslavia have produced very valuable work over the last fifteen years. This article will investigate the work of two comics artists from the region, one from Slovenia and one from Serbia. Specifically, this article will focus on the representation of war and social and political turmoil in Aleksandar Zograf's Regards from Serbia and in Tomaz Lavric's Bosanske basne [Bosnian Fables]. Zograf's and Lavric's work is interesting for two reasons. First, they both chose the short story format to document the wars that tore apart Yugo slavia. Conveying content primarily through images, Zograf's and Lavric's graphic narratives "visually archive the abstraction of historical knowl edge" (Chiu 100). Thus, they help preserve, (trans)form, and circulate nar ratives, images, and memories of the violent dissolution of Yugoslavia. Sec ond, both comics artists focus on individual stories, fictional as well as non-fictional, while simultaneously linking them to what is happening on the broader level of society. This essay will look at the ways in which Zograf and Lavric use the medium of comics to visually map the Bosnian war, specifically the crisis in Serbia and the NATO bombing of the country. I will examine, compare, and contrast the different graphic and narrative strategies they use to represent the horrible ways that war affects the lives of individual people. I will argue that Zograf's and Lavric's understanding of comics as a particular way of seeing encourages the reader to imagine individual war experiences. More specifi cally, I will demonstrate how both authors, each using a different visual lan guage and each in his own way blurring/dissolving the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction, demand or invoke an ethical response in the reader re garding the suffering of others. In doing so, their work not only challenges and explores the possibilities of the historical and aesthetic representation of war—of war in general and of the Yugoslav wars in particular—but also ex emplifies how contemporary post-Yugoslav comics complement conven tional historical and journalistic narratives about the war in Yugoslavia. 2. One of the reasons for this neglect is probably the rather modest production of comics in the respective Yugoslav successor states today. Regrettably, the once dynamic and varied comics scene that had existed in Yugoslavia up until the disintegration of the country still seems far from recovering from the harsh crisis that struck it during the 1990s (Zupan).</page><page sequence="3">A Different Kind of War Story 163 Aleksandar Zograf's Regards from Serbia: 'Autographies' and the Distorted Reality Behind War Zograf's recently published Regards from Serbia: A Cartoonist's Diary of a Crisis in Serbia (2007) is a collection of short comic strips, e-mails, and a comic diary. Some of them are new, while others were published earlier. The first part of his book deals with the wars that tore Yugoslavia apart and the effects of economic sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. These comics were originally drawn in (largely unedited) English and were previously published in the United States in 1994 and in the United Kingdom in 1998. At least to a certain extent, they present an attempt to explain the complex ity of the Yugoslav wars to foreign readers.3 The second part of the book consists of e-mails and a comic diary produced during the 1999 NATO bombing of the country and the last days of the regime of Milosevic. In this respect, Zograf to a certain extent followed a more general trend: apart from movies, diaries seem to have been one of the most popular genres to deal with the 1999 bombings of Serbia (Dakovic; Norris 229-30).4 During the bombing, Zograf regularly sent e-mails to his friends and fellow cartoonists abroad, who, as he wrote in the foreword to the printed edition of this col lection of letters, "are like a global tribe, and (unlike the governments who rule the countries where they live) these loveable, nerdy little book worms don't have many problems with communicating with one another." His diary-like collection of letters was first published in 1999 as "a collection of private observations, an intimate vision of everyday reality during wartime" rather than a historical or political analysis (2). Later, at the end of the bomb ing and during the last months of Milosevic's regime, inspired by Chris Ware, he started drawing comics, which were published for the first time in the 2007 edition of Regards from Serbia. Zograf's comic book offers an in triguing combination of comics, autobiography, and recent history as expe rienced by ordinary people, evoking the different discourses (about war and political crisis) that circulated in Serbian society during the 1990s. In what follows, I will explore how Zograf exploits the possibilities of what Gillian Whitlock has called "autographies" to render visible the reality behind the war and social turmoil of the 1990s. 3. Some of Zograf's work, especially the comic on the NATO bombing, has also been pub lished in Italian, French, Spanish, and Greek. 4. Diaries were written in different languages, for different readerships. One of Serbia's well known writers, Ljubomir Simovic, kept his private diary in Serbian during the bombing, hav ing it published only afterwards. Others, such as Jasmina Tesanovic, published fragments in En glish on the Internet, or in foreign newspapers, as was the case for Jelica Novakovic, who, as a professor of Dutch, published daily columns in a Dutch and a Belgian newspaper. The diaries of both Tesanovic and Novakovic were afterwards released in book form.</page><page sequence="4">164 Slavic and East European Journal Framing the Reality Behind War: Zograf's "Autographies" In Life under Sanctions (originally written in English, first published in 1994, and reprinted in 2007 as part of Regards from Serbia), Zograf drew his personal "psychological diary of war" (Spurgeon). Focusing on everyday life behind the front lines rather than describing fighting (because the author him self was evading the draft, this choice of perspective comes as no surprise), Zograf wanted to tell a story about what he has called "the crisis in Yugo slavia," that is, the part of Yugoslavia on which international sanctions were imposed. Unlike Sacco, whose Safe Area Gorazde was written after extensive reading and about a month of field research in Gorazde, Zograf's work lacks a systematic, research-oriented approach. Based on the experiences and ob servations of the author, Zograf's comics are more personal, even introspec tive at times. Consisting of a series of discrete episodes told in an anecdotal manner, Zograf's work refrains from offering a sustained historical narrative. Instead, the fragmentary quality of his work seems to suggest that the tangi bleness of the traumatic reality he portrays resists being integrated into a sin gle, overarching historical narrative. The author himself frequently appears as a character in the story and thus functions as narrator-protagonist, relating his own life experiences or com menting on events he had heard about from others.5 Hence, Zograf's work can be read as a kind of graphic memoir or "autographies," to use Whitlock's expression. By introducing the term "autographies," Whitlock wanted "to draw attention to the specific conjunctions of visual and verbal text in this genre of autobiography" (966). This term indeed very closely describes the specific graphic autobiographical documents that Zograf has produced, un derscoring the great potential of comics to represent and portray societies that are going through war or periods of social and political turmoil. The comic alter ego of the artist has a hope: "maybe things would seem clearer if I put them onto paper and transform them in [...] little drawings..." (Zograf 2007, 37). However, he doesn't address whether he means to clarify the events for the reader or for himself in a classic therapeutic sense, or maybe both. In a similar vein, suggesting that not only drawing but also, perhaps, reading comics can make things clear, Scott McCloud has averred that "cartooning isn't just a way of drawing, it is a way of seeing" (31). Zograf, furthermore, seems to suggest that reading comics—and autographies in particular—re quires a kind of performative involvement from the reader, an interaction be tween narrator and reader that, because of the medium's visual dimension, is more explicit or direct in comics than in written memoirs or in other autobi 5. In this respect, Zograf actually follows the most recent trends in graphic narrative and the burgeoning field of non-fiction comics in particular. See, for example, the foregrounding of (auto)biography in the work of Spiegelman and Satrapi, a tendency which, according to Bart Beaty, is also typical of contemporary French comics.</page><page sequence="5">A Different Kind of War Story 165 ographical literature: "I draw comics so that you can see things through my eyes. [...] Try to imagine what it would be like if you were born as Aleksan dar Zograf. I could be you and you could be me!" (1994, 20; 2007, 35) (Fig. 1). Elsewhere, he says: "I will show myself as a hero [protagonist] of this very comic strip...I have some messages to jab[b]er in your face..." (Zograf 2007, 38). We could say that Zograf presents himself as our guide through the Yu goslavian "time of troubles." Explicitly underscoring his role as an eyewit ness, he seems to invite the reader not to read history merely as a collective narrative about unknown individuals in an unknown country far away, but to connect or even replace history with individual, deeply human stories. The potential of comics to produce an abundance of meaning (Frahm), emerging from the combination of textual and visual representation even within a single panel, has frequently been used by Zograf to illustrate some of the absurdities of the Yugoslav wars in a very condensed and comprehen sive manner. In just a few panels, he evokes the different discourses that cir culated among the population about the start of the war in Croatia. We see, for example, older people recalling the weather conditions that had character ized the beginning of the Second World War—a parallel which implicitly refers to explanations that regarded the conflict of the 1990s as a mere con tinuation (or repetition) of the Second World War and, hence, seeks its origins in the alleged ancient interethnic hatred between Croats and Serbs. In the background, we see the author's comic alter ego, who is visibly upset by such comparisons and interpretations that betray a cyclical vision of history. Thus, the presence of the narrator in the panel, his facial expressions and body lan guage, help the reader interpret historical information. In the next panel, the narrator puts forward his own vision: the reasons for killing have been in vented by politicians and national leaders. Both nationalist sides, presented as mirror images of each other (further emphasized by the words of one of them written backwards), are seen as equally guilty. The Serbian, Bosniak, and Croatian nationals in Bosnia are represented as three heads on one body, fiercely beating up each other (Zograf 1994, 4; 2007, 17-19, 21, 39) (Fig. 2). Politically or historically speaking, this indeed looks like a simplification,6 but in terms of discourse analysis (that is, as far as the similarities in the na tionalist rhetoric of the warring parties are concerned), Zograf definitely has a point. His alter ego is particularly horrified by the way the masses bought into populist rhetoric, the cult of the leader,7 the nationalist fascination with collective victimization, and, as we shall see later, the role the media play in 6. For an excellent critique of views that regard the Yugoslav wars of succession as 'ethnic wars' and the implications of such framing for our understanding of the conflict, see Gagnon 2004. 7. The role of nationalist leaders and their tremendous impact on the population is visualized in a drawing of a gigantic, god-like figure, embracing a crowd of dwarfs (Zograf 2007, 38-39).</page><page sequence="6">Slavic and East European Journal PRAty COMfCS SO THAI YOU 1 CAN 5££ "WINGS, THROUGH E^fES..

Zograf is at his best, however, when he de picts the position of the individual citizen confronted with the increasing paranoia and irrationality of a society under sanctions. The Distorted Reality of War: Zograf's "Fantastic Realism" In an interview, Zograf once said he never liked war comics or movies, adding that he "would be bored to death if [he] had to do a 'real war' story comic" (Delibasich). Not surprisingly, the "reality" that Zograf's narrator vi sually presents differs from, for example, the highly realistic drawings of the war scenes or harsh pictures of everyday life in Bosnian enclaves in Joe Sacco's Safe Area Gorazde. Of course, the two artists have a different point of departure; while Sacco writes about the life in besieged cities such as Sara jevo and Gorazde, Zograf represents the flip side of war, zooming in on the prevalent atmosphere in a society under sanctions and trying to grasp its social tensions. Nevertheless, there is more at stake than just a difference in interest or focus. As Susan Sontag has argued with reference to war photog raphy, artists have for a long time trusted the shock-effect of realistic photog raphy, believing that "if the horror could be made vivid enough, most people would finally take in the outrageousness, the insanity of war" (12). However, Zograf's lack of interest in a realistic representation of the atrocities of war does not preclude him from providing the reader with keen observations about the sad transformations of a country caught in war and how war affects</page><page sequence="8">168 Slavic and East European Journal broad layers of society as well as the lives of individuals—on the contrary, his non-realistic images only underscore his message. Unlike Artie in Art Spiegelman's Maus, the traumatic experience Zograf's avatar must work through is related not to the past but to the nightmarish present, yet the ques tion remains how to render visible this experience, that is, how to communi cate it by means of a medium that both draws on and transcends the limits of linguistic communication. As Pascal Lefévre has pointed out, "in comics, there cannot be any strict separation between form and content; [...] form is more than an empty and coded container for content." Zograf's comics support this claim in a very in teresting way: a comment by the narrator points in the same direction. Dis cussing with a friend the sense and nonsense of his comics about the war and sanctions, the author's comic alter ego argues that his work "is not strictly 'documentary'" and describes his own style as "some kind of fantastic real ism, in a good Russian tradition" (Zograf 2007, 54). Moreover, Zograf em phasizes that "the whole situation could be properly described by pointing at some peripheral details," adding that "in our life, we are always watching just fragments" (2007, 54). The "distorted reality" and "state of collective trance" of which the narra tor speaks are then rendered visible by the images and the unusual shapes of the panels (Zograf 2007, 53,47). For example, the deep generational gap that divided Serbia politically is underscored by the drawing of a person with a bi furcated head, consisting of a young half and an old half, while the accompa nying panel shows a two-headed person, emphasizing the schizophrenic at mosphere the country was going through (Zograf 2007, 46) (Fig. 3). In this context, it is also worth mentioning that Zograf's war-related comics are all in black and white, which is a complete contrast with the bright colors of his more recent work.8 Admittedly, the deformed, at times surrealistic, aesthetics of Zograf are also connected with the artist's significant interest in dreams. Some of these aesthetic aspects are also typical of his other work and not only of his war-related work. His work often focuses on the mental processes of the narrator, who tries to establish a link between the outer world of war and economic sanctions and the inner world of his dreams.9 Thus, the dream world and hypnagogic visions of the artist are juxtaposed with the real world, where everything is even more unreal than in the dreams of the narrator (Zo graf 2007, 22-23, 27). An interesting example of this can be found in the scene in which the author 8. See, for example, his books Tusta i tma [Multitudes and Myriads] and Polovni svet [Sec ond-Hand World], 9. During the war, Zograf tragically lost his capacity for lucid dreaming and felt unable to follow his hands in his dreams. This is a very powerful image: war means the end of dreaming and, eventually, of any creativity.</page><page sequence="9">A Different Kind of War Story 169 AT TOE VEltf SAME ™E,SeR&amp;IA WAS SAVA«P gy A DBEPtY WHWNfi GENERATION WAR THE RDfRs win «FíE ?U0W»S Wf^t J{f§ VOUtk .AFSV1* ÍVÍlttTHfXG TURNÍi» !HT0 A &amp;1ZZA« MlXTURÍr OF toys AND HATf.THE SITUATION (VAS QUITE SCHISOPHRENIC. •..

The sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia had a strong im pact on the economy of the country but did not harm the establishment in Ser bia. On the contrary, the regime became stronger while the opposition became discouraged, as Zograf writes (2007, 21). In the lives of ordinary people, how ever, the sanctions were a real disaster because they saw themselves con fronted with extreme inflation and shortages of common necessities. Curi ously, sanctions were also applied to matters of culture, generating some ridiculous measures, such as Disney's withdrawal of the license for their prod ucts in Yugoslavia. This makes Zograf's narrator reflect on the popularity of Disney's cartoon figures, which had been a daily companion of the Serbian newspaper reader since the 1930s. The sense and nonsense of the sanctions im posed by the international community in the field of culture are rendered visi ble in a very amusing way, which clarifies the degree of absurdity of such sanctions as well as the deeply paternalistic stance of the West towards Serbia: in one panel, Mickey Mouse is called back by his "father," Walt Disney, and some panels later, an enraged person, clearly representing "the West," takes a Disney figure back with force while shouting to the Serbian man who was playing with it: "You can't play with our toys!" (Zograf 1994, 17-18). The next panel shows the absurdity of the issues discussed by nationalist parties in the Serbian parliament, whose members are depicted as strange, animal-like creatures who could have escaped from a Disney movie. The absurd reason ing of politicians, both at the international and the local level, cannot be de scribed with words alone because reality is even more fantastic and unbeliev able than dreams—which brings us back to the world of animated movies (Zograf 2007, 32; 1994, 17-18) (Fig. 4). Thus, the deformed pictures of Zograf's comics constantly raise questions about the ways in which the absurd reality of war and sanctions can be represented.

"Do you suffer?": The Interventionist Politics of the West, Media, and the War Finally, Zograf questions not only the reality of war in which people live but also how war is represented by the sides involved. His Regards from Serbia does not hesitate to tackle crucial ethical questions concerning reporting about war. The issues he critically addresses are the role of the media, both local and international; the aggressiveness of local nationalist discourse about "[foreign] enemies" and "[domestic] traitors"; and, finally, the euphemistic rhetoric of the West about contemporary warfare. Zograf's autographies enable him to con struct a counter-narrative, which is skeptical about the dominant local and in ternational discourses regarding the crisis in Serbia during the 1990s. First, Zograf's Regards from Serbia does not hesitate to blame the local, regime dominated media for maintaining, spreading, and inflating the wars in Croatia and Bosnia. The unscrupulous character of the media is fittingly illustrated in a panel that visualizes how "common people got caught up in a game created by politicians and the media," showing a huge mouth literally swallowing up people (Zograf 1994, 4) (Fig. 5). On several occasions, however, Zograf also reveals how local media stimulated the population to be apathetic consumers, no longer capable of or interested in changing the situation in which they lived</page><page sequence="11">A Different Kind of War Story common people got causmt up in a gmi c.rhat£d by politicians,ifls wa-ahi&gt;ti«r own f£ars m prejudices. i Fig. 5. 'Common people caught up by the media.' From Life under Sanctions by Aleksandar Zograf. © A. Zograf; used with permission. (2007,47, 79, and others). The international reporters who figure in his comics ask the local population stupid questions such as "Do you suffer?" (Zograf 1994, 5), thus clearly personifying Sontag's "professional, specialized tourists known as [war] journalists" (16). Second, by stressing the uneasy and undesir able position of the individual person rather than collective or national inter ests, Zograf's autographies offer a counter-narrative to the aggressive rhetoric of the different sides involved in the conflict. In one of the panels, for exam ple, Zograf depicts himself as trapped between the dominant nationalist narra tives of both Serbian and Albanian nationalists, while the NATO forces are bombing the area (2007, 90). Third, Zograf's comics trenchantly question the euphemistic rhetoric of the members of the NATO alliance and the way they reported the military actions against Serbia and the advantages of techniques used in modern warfare. Euphemisms frequently used by NATO forces in cluded "collateral damage" and "intelligent bombs." If we agree with the defi nition of Marianne Hirsch that euphemism is "the linguistic equivalent of ob structed, censored vision, [attempting] the self-blinding of the general population" (1214), then a possible answer to euphemism would be to render visible what the obstructing, censoring rhetoric of the warring parties is trying to hide. As Zograf shows, this is exactly what comics are able to do.10 Trying to reveal the true meaning of the euphemisms of NATO, Zograf exploits the possibilities of what Hirsch has called "the visual-verbal biocularity" of comics, which "ask[s] us to read back and forth between images and words [revealing] the visuality and thus materiality of words and the discursivity and narrativity of images" (1213). According to Hirsch, this biocularity makes "[w]ords, images and word-images work together to enact the impossibility of seeing and the impossibility of not looking" (1213). Zograf depicts the "intel 10. As Thierry Smolderen (2009) has pointed out, comics have their roots as much in the se quential art developed in the early nineteenth century by Rodolphe Toepffer as in the satire and parody of the eighteenth-century painter and engraver William Hogarth and in the tradition of humorous illustrations that emerged in the hundred years after him.</page><page sequence="12">172 Slavic and East European Journal SH?TR€RE'i McfTHlNQTo WORgV ABOUT!

The euphemism "collateral damage," which refers to victims among civilians, is countered by one single panel, de picting all eight hundred children who died during the NATO bombing of Ser bia as collateral damage (Zograf 2007, 175) (Fig. 7). This panel once more shows Zograf's ability not only to condense complicated, key issues into one panel but also to unmask euphemistic rhetoric about warfare. Interestingly, the panel brings to mind the early roots of comics, namely the tradition of single</page><page sequence="13">A Different Kind of War Story IT's still hot POSS/BLl TO covtvr ALL THE VICTIMS OF THE NATO S&amp;OAiB/ArtT CAMPAIGW-ACComW To THE latest INFORMATION from THE YUGOSLAV IWVEummm UN/CEF, ABOUT Zooo CIVILIANS Mte klLLEfi SO FAR.ABOUT \ '800 THEM Iml CHILPRWHE&amp; THEY are : 800 kips 'N A SWUi DraMAG* Fig. 7.

Arousing our curiosity, the chaotic image of a crowd encourages us to delve into the panel, to let our gaze travel through the crowd in the picture, to find pleasure in the act of looking for a hitherto unseen activity or a hidden person (Smolderen 2009, ll).11 Zograf's panel, however, inverts this regime of infor mation: by displaying an uncountable crowd of smiling children's faces, he makes it impossible not to see these all too easily forgotten victims of the war.12 Putting Together the Pieces of the Bosnian War: Tomaz Lavric's Bosanske basne Originally published in Slovenia in 1997, Tomaz Lavric's Bosanske basne has been translated into both French (1999) and Italian (2000) and was re 11. According to Smolderen, the effect of this graphic commotion and swarming in eigh teenth-century engravings, such as those by William Hogarth, will impose itself as one of the great constants in the future aesthetics of comics. Finding its roots in the prints of Hogarth, this tradition was revived in the nineteenth century by Richard Outcault's series of single-panel color cartoons called Yellow Kid. A more recent example would be the popular Where's Waldo series by Martin Handford, which challenges readers to find a person called Waldo hidden in the group. 12. I am grateful to Steven Surdiacourt for drawing my attention to this point.</page><page sequence="14">174 Slavic and East European Journal cently reprinted in Croatia (2006).13 The French edition, published by Edi tions Glénat, took him to the renowned comics festival of Angouléme and earned him a Grand Prix at the international comics festival in the Swiss town Sierre (1999) as well as a Silver Lion award from the Brussels-based Belgian Comic Strip Centre (1999). The album is drawn entirely in black and white. Contrary to what the title might suggest, Bos ans ke basne is not a comic book inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, fairies, the supernatural, or anything else that might suggest a fable.14 Instead, it is a collection of short comic stories that all relate a different aspect of the Bosnian war. The respective animals after which each of the "fables" is named appear merely as a leitmotif that leads the reader towards the moral of the story. The pro tagonists are human beings caught in the whirlpool of a cruel, dehumanizing war and confronted with hunger, atrocities, and nationalist madness. Rather than depicting spectacular fighting scenes at the front or staging the adven tures of superheroes fighting the enemy, Lavric chooses to portray life sto ries that do not fit traditional war comics. His stories reinforce the insights of Ivana Macek, an anthropologist who has done extensive research about everyday life in Sarajevo during the siege of the city. Specifically, Macek has emphasized that the real life experience of the Bosnian war differed ex tremely from conventional ideas about war as "soldiers fighting on the front lines while civilians work to sustain the war effort" (191). Representing par adigmatic cases of the war in Bosnia, Lavric's 'fables' function as a synec doche fulfilling the didactic promise that the title seems to contain. Put to gether, these individual stories compose a dark mosaic of different voices laying a claim to the production of truth about the Bosnian war. Not unlike Zograf's Regards from Serbia, these deeply human narratives offer access to a non-structured, open social memory of the time. As such, they challenge conventional historical accounts of the war in Bosnia, which, as Macek has argued convincingly, are unable to capture what war looked like for ordinary citizens because historians "organize the reality of war as experienced by in 13. The album was originally written in Serbo-Croatian; therefore, Fibra's 2006 edition was not a translation but actually a reprint of the Slovene edition. The only difference was that the story Mazga [The Mule], which Lavric had drawn especially for the French edition, was also included in the Croatian edition. As for the language of the album, Lavric has tried to convey different Serbo-Croat dialects: the Split idiom of the waiter in Riba [The Fish], the ikavian of Croatian soldiers in Herzegovina in the story Guja [The Viper], the ijekavian of Bosnians (in general), and the ekavian of certain Serbian militias in stories such as Muha [The Fly] or Pas [The Dog]. Thus, Lavric has actually used language to indicate the different ethnic or national identity of his characters. Some of the dialogues (with U.N. soldiers or with foreign journalists) are rendered in English and French. The multilingual aspect of the album is lost in the French translation because all characters speak French, except for the U.N. soldiers: they speak French in the original album but English in the French edition. 14. The only exception is the story Svinja [The Pig], in which the characters, seen through the eyes of a drug addict, are depicted with the heads of animals.</page><page sequence="15">A Different Kind of War Story 175 dividuals into a narrative with fixed and symbolically pregnant dates and events" (198). Zooming in on the Reality of the Bosnian War, or Why Perspective Matters In Bosanske basne, the narrative thread connecting the individual stories in time and space is a routine flight by two American pilots, who, having taken off from an aircraft carrier somewhere in the Adriatic (the first town on their route seems to be Split), survey Bosnian territory. When their mis sion is finished, they report that "no hostile activity has been noticed"; however, the illusion of the peaceful hills they see from above stands in se vere contrast to what is really happening on the ground. The reader is con stantly reminded of this contrast by Lavric's frequently alternating between "a worm's eye view," for example, when the characters of the strip look up and see the American aircraft flying over their heads, and "a bird's-eye view," when the reader looks down on the protagonists. As Will Eisner has demonstrated, the latter vantage point creates "a sense of detachment" that visually underscores the pilots' indifference (90). The point of view of the pilots, however, seems implicitly to allude to the uninterested gaze of the West, which preferred observing the Yugoslav wars from a safe distance. By alternating points of view, Lavric constantly reminds the reader not only of the huge difference between looking at war and being physically involved in it but also of the problem of representing war: a biased perspective may pre vent us from seeing anything at all, let alone exposing at least a part of the truth about war. Already in the second stoiy of the book, Guja [The Viper], Lavric—not un like Zograf—unmasks TV journalists' cynical way of looking at war and re porting on it. The story revolves around a TV crew that, in search for "a real background," has gone to the front to make a video clip for a pop star who reminds us of the turbo-folk singers that were so popular in the former Yugo slavia during the 1990s. For this purpose, they even bring their own dancers, dressed up as soldiers. When one of the dancers gets bitten by a viper, his agony is immediately filmed in close-up by the crew. The only purpose of the crew's director seems to be looking for sensational shots and spectacular, hor rifying images that will sell, regardless of whether they are related to war or not. Thus, because it can sell as "a real war story," the fate of the unlucky dancer turns out to be more interesting for the TV crew than the video spot or the stories of "the real, dyed-in-the-wool warriors [pravi, okorjeli ratnici]," whose battalion is quite ironically named after a venomous snake: Poskoci [horned vipers]. The irony is all the more obvious when the "real" soldiers in terviewed by the TV crew prove to be an absolute caricature of the heroic, pa triotic Croatian soldiers they ought to represent to the domestic TV-watching public. At best, they recycle political slogans about "the defense of every inch</page><page sequence="16">176 Slavic and East European Journal of our holy land" (Lavric 2006,12), their primitive language underscoring the stupidity of their faces.15 Aptly making use of different perspectives and points of view and of the possibilities of the breakdown and mise en scene in comics, Lavric invites the reader not only to plunge into the story's diegesis but also to imagine what it means to experience war. A closer look at the central pages of the story Muha [The Fly], in which a Slovene journalist is being threatened by the military escort of a high official of one of the warring parties, will elu cidate how this works (Fig. 8). Witnessing the harassment of the journalist, a French United Nations soldier ("blue helmet") tries to intervene on behalf of the journalist, but because the (possibly Serbian) soldier is not disturbed in the least by the presence of the United Nations,16 the situation becomes tense. The page on which the conflict reaches its climax opens with an over head view of the three: the soldier points his gun at the head of the journal ist, accusing him of espionage, while the United Nations soldier from high above in his tank tries to calm down the aggressive soldier. The oblong panel occupying the whole strip resembles a cinematic shot, invoking an im pression of frozen time. The next panel, which occupies a central place on the page, zeroes in on the sweating, anxious face of the journalist, seen from the vantage point of the soldier. The focus then shifts in the third panel to the point of view of the United Nations soldier, showing only a side view of the hand of the soldier holding the pistol with which he threatens the jour nalist. The last strip of the page is divided into three panels, allowing the reader to take the vantage point of the journalist. The first panel does not contain a text balloon but shows only a front view of the revolver, thus forc ing the reader to look right into the barrel of the gun just as the journalist does, with a dead doe shot earlier by the United Nations soldiers in the back ground. The next two panels zoom in on the dead doe and the flies on its eye, echoing in a morbid way the anxious thoughts of the journalist. Located in the lower right-hand corner, this panel occupies a pivotal position because it coincides in the reading process with the turning of the page (Groensteen 2007, 29, 35, 147-48). The denouement of the story follows on the next page. When the soldier is called by his superior, he eventually drops his gun and returns to his position in the escort; the Slovene journalist dryly answers the swearing U.N. soldier, "That's life in Yugoslavia... Don't you have some fuel?" The reaction of the United Nations soldier ("Merde! Ces fous des Balkanais!" (Lavric 2006, 24)) could be interpreted as yet another utterance of the superior gaze of the West on the Balkans, which has often reduced the origins of the Yugoslav wars to the allegedly innate qualities of "crazy 15. The Serbian 'chetniks' and Bosniak soldiers are depicted in a similarly caricatural way. 16. The right of the United Nations soldiers to fire was limited to cases of self-defense, some thing that is not made explicit in the story.</page><page sequence="17">A Different Kind of War Story Fig. 8.

However, he uses the possibilities of comics for more than merely creating the effect of suspense. By depicting the horror as it is envisaged by the protagonist, he involves the reader emotionally and invites him to identify with the position of the journalist. What is more, the story reminds us of the dedication on the first verso page of the book, which shows a photograph of a young man in front of a tank and the accompanying comment, "In memoriam Ivo Standeker, comics connoisseur and journalist, a friend [of mine] killed in Sarajevo while fulfilling his task as a [war] correspondent." Although the photo of Standeker is not explicitly included in the fictional world of the story Muha, it nonetheless painfully reminds the reader of the historical facts underlying it. Comics Realism: The Intersection of Individual and Collective Stories, or How War Transforms Society As we have seen, Zograf's Regards from Serbia approaches the 1990s in Serbia from an entirely different angle than conventional journalistic dis course and traditional historical accounts do; its approach also differs signifi cantly from Sacco's and from traditional war comics. Staging a real-life au thor telling of his entirely subjective experience (including even his dreams), combining the real and the absurd, using at times a non-realistic or even ab surd visual language, Zograf constantly pushes the borders between fiction and non-fiction. Defining the genre of Lavric's Bosanske basne, however, is also not easy and poses difficulties for other reasons. Opting for a more tra ditional visual and narrative language than Zograf's, Lavric uses another strategy to dissolve the borders between documentary non-fiction and realist fiction. Extending Chute's argument about the relevance of graphic narrative 17. Interestingly, both Yugoslav and West European reviewers seem to agree that Lavric's Slovene background helped him to draw such an impressive album on the Bosnian war, but they clearly disagree as to how his Slovene vantage point has affected the documentary aspect of the album. A Serbian reviewer, for example, has commented that Lavric drew his comic album on the Bosnian war as an outsider. As a Slovene, he allegedly took a neutral position and depicted "a universal war story in which it is entirely unimportant what the three sides are called." How ever, as the reviewer stresses, the Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian reader cannot but be struck by its horror, because "the protagonists speak our languages and we unavoidably get shivers running down our spines" (Charm, emphasis in the original). A French reviewer, in contrast, claimed that Lavric's Fables were "not didactic enough" for a readership which, unlike the Slovene au thor, is not familiar with the peculiarities of the Yugoslav wars (Montagnana). Lavric himself, however, obviously never had the intention of explaining the Bosnian war to a foreign reader ship (Standeker).</page><page sequence="19">A Different Kind of War Story 179 for literary scholars, Daniel Worden has convincingly argued that if we con sider comics as a literary form rather than as a medium, then war comics would "fall in the tradition of literary realism. Comics about war attempt to both document individual experience but also go to great lengths to attach those individual experiences to larger social, institutional, and historical frames" (5). This is exactly what Lavric's Bosanske basne do; by connecting an individual person to broader developments on a societal level, they invite the reader to decipher the individual's life story (and transformation) as a paradigmatic example of what war does to society, in other words, to read them "as evidence of larger social structures" (Worden 9). A compelling ex ample of this case is the story Mazga [The Mule], which stages how reli gious radicalization and militarization ironically produce homogeneous eth nic identities while destroying social heterogeneity and previously non-ethnically marked generational bonds. It relates the story of two young, long-haired Bosniak hard rock music lovers who, forced to serve at the front, discover that the Serbs they are supposed to shoot at in the trench on the other side of a mined railway are actually fellow Metallica fans. They start talking about music, joking, exchanging weed and brandy, and making fun of their more religious compatriot, Zaim, who refuses to have some brandy. Gradually, they develop a generational bond which surpasses and contradicts the rigid ethnic classifications that are needed to keep the war going. Pre cisely because it transcends ethnic boundaries, this bond is doomed from the start, as becomes clear from the story. Eager to attack the Serbs when they don't expect it, religious fanatics in the Bosnian army compel the young rockers to entertain their Serbian peers. After this betrayal of the mutual trust the young men have developed, the revenge of the Serbs soon follows. One of the Bosniak protagonists is killed and the other eventually turns into one of those religious fanatics he had despised so much at the beginning of the war. Naive as this story may appear at first, the visual narration and the lan guage of comics succeed in conveying a surplus of meaning and captivating the reader in the end. For example, one of the central pages poignantly de picts the changing social importance and role of religion in Bosnian society (Fig. 9). The page juxtaposes divergent views on religion in a society under pressure by war through its portrayal of praying radical Muslim warriors alongside the long-haired rock music lovers, and the call for prayer from the minaret along with the ironic comments of the rockers. A panel depicting a minaret stretches vertically over three-fourths of the length of the page; the graffiti on the mosque in the lower corner of the panel echo the opinion on religion of the youngsters, who would "rather put a veil on than cut their hair" (Lavric 2006, 58). Corresponding with this page, the last panel of the story zooms in on the shaved head of the rocker who survived but is now a member of a radical Muslim militia. Leaving no doubt that war destroys sec ular identities as well as the traditional, Bosnian version of Islam, the story</page><page sequence="20">Slavic and East European Journal Fig. 9. From Bosanske basne by Tomaz Lavric. © Editions Glénat, Fables de Bosnie— 1999 / Bosanske basne—2006; used with permission.</page><page sequence="21">A Different Kind of War Story 181 at the same time points out how the "purification" and fixation of ethnic and religious identity become inscribed on and symbolized by the body of the soldier, the battalion becoming a symbol of how the homogeneous ethnic community should look. In addition, the story reveals that the ethnicization of society is a consequence of the violence of war rather than its cause. Regarding the Pain of Others—How to Avoid an Aesthetics of Death? In an interview, Lavric remarked, "I wish to be an objective observer, with out being insensitive. I wish to create an atmosphere of terror as authentically as possible, but without explicit scenes of killing which could turn the comics into a cheap aesthetics of death."18 Looking for a fragile balance between showing and not showing, and wanting to avoid merely producing images of suffering ready to be consumed, Lavric indeed leaves some of the most dread ful scenes to the reader's imagination. To this purpose, he aptly makes use of the possibilities of narrative drawing and of the elliptical character of comics, which, according to Groensteen, is inherent in the medium (112-15, 132). A good example of this can be found in the story Macka [Cat], which drama tizes the life of kids and the games they play in a city—probably Sarajevo— constantly exposed to sniper fire. Looking for traces of the tiger he had seen the night before, Nermin, a little boy, forgets about the danger and arrives at a crossroads that is often targeted by snipers. (A few pages earlier, the reader has even had the opportunity to look at the same crossroads through the sniper lens of a chetnik, as the Serbian soldiers that surrounded the city were called by the citizens of Sarajevo.) This moment, rendered in the last three panels of a right-hand page, and thus situated on a "privileged site" (Groen steen 147-48), is accompanied by a single text balloon on the first panel: "Nermin, the sniper!" Hearing his friends calling him, the boy suddenly real izes where he is, and the panels move from a close-up of his face to a bird's eye view of the kid who helplessly looks up at the place where he supposes the sniper to be. Emotionally involving the reader, Lavric's Bosnian Fables demonstrate that looking at war (and, hence, at the suffering of others) im plies choosing sides, distinguishing between victims and perpetrators. Indeed, when looking down on the child from the position of the sniper, the reader cannot but fear for the life of the boy and ask himself how someone can shoot a child (Fig. 10). After we turn the page, our gaze follows Nermin's mother running to the crossroads, only to be returned to the narrative thread about the released tiger, which, seen from above, provokes the American pilots to call Bosnia "a jungle" (clearly in a derogatory way). It is only after this delay of 18. "¿elim biti objektiven opazovalec, a ne brezcuten.

These panels cannot be perceived simultaneously with the close-up of Nermin, but because they clearly correspond, the reader connects them automatically with each other (Fig. 11). Other examples of "narrative drawing" used to suggest the horror of war rather than to depict it explicitly can be found in the story Pas [The Dog], in which the protagonist is not a victim but a perpetrator—a guard in a concen r 7c_ Fig. 11.

(What triggers this flashback is the fact that his stepfather had given him a pit bull puppy, a dog that still accompanies him at the time of the narration.) One panel is especially effective in rendering the morbid plans of the Serbian nationalists. An oblong panel situated in the lower corner of the right-hand page and stretched over the whole length of the strip depicts a roasted lamb being cut into pieces by the waiter; this panel immedi ately attracts the attention of the reader. The conversation going on at the table behind the waiter's back, rendered by two text balloons, helps the reader to read the represented scene as a morbid prefiguration of what will happen dur ing the war. The strip is divided into two parts by a vertical bar of the grill on which the lamb lies. The first half, which focuses on the waiter's hands and knife, is accompanied by a text balloon: "Each true patriot is welcome in our ranks!" The second half of the panel then zooms in on the skull of the dead an imal, the balloon in the upper right corner of the panel telling us, "The whole people is with us! We'll take things into our own hands, by God!" (Fig. 12). It is only after the whole story has been read that this panel acquires its full meaning, morbidly foreshadowing what will happen in the concentration camp and suggesting the horror that can happen when nationalists "take things into their own hands." By portraying the story of a concentration camp guard rather than depicting the suffering of the victims in a direct way, Lavric—this might sound rather paradoxical—accomplishes two things. First, the fact that Lavric eschews the use of explicit images of suffering or mutilated bodies does not mean that he turns away from the horror of war. Instead, Lavric seems to be fully aware that "the appetite for pictures showing bodies in pain is as keen, almost, as the desire for ones that show bodies naked" (Sontag 36). For exam ple, the reader does not (and neither does Draza) see the butcher torturing peo ple; only later does the reader discover (through Draza's eyes) that the piece of meat that the butcher gave to his dog was a human finger (Fig. 13). Second, by focusing on the nausea of the protagonist and his inability to protest against what is going on in the camp, Lavric has depicted a guard who does not fit into the stereotypical picture of the perpetrator. Draza is portrayed as a person who is unable to break free from the vicious circle in which he is caught—the only way for him to deal with the horror of the camp is by trying not to see or hear how his previous neighbors are suffering from thirst, starvation, and torture. 19. As the author said in an interview, "I have compassion for the victims, but at the same time I also try to understand the bestial mind of the perpetrators [Soöustvujem z zrtvami, a hkrati se trudim razumeti tudi animalicni um krvnikov]" (Modic).</page><page sequence="24">Slavic and East European Journal Fig. 12.

Conclusion Examining the possibilities of comics for articulating the traumatic aspects of history, this article has looked at the ways in which contemporary post Yugoslav comics have attempted to engage with the violent dissolution of Yugoslavia. Staging the experience of individuals within the frame of collec tive history, Zograf's and Lavric's work definitely "explores the conflicted boundaries of what can be said and what can be shown at the intersection of collective histories and life stories" (Chute 459). Although both authors obvi ously share the same concern about the fate of the individual in a society torn apart by war, they appeal to the reader in different ways. Zograf's autograph ies invite the reader to look at war from the position of a first-person narrator,</page><page sequence="25">A Different Kind of War Story 185 whereas Lavric's comics, by their use of different perspectives, poignantly il lustrate the difference between looking at war (from the vantage point of an American or United Nations soldier, of a sensationalist TV crew, of a West European tourist) and being caught by war (as victim, engaged journalist, or witness). At the same time, both authors refuse to draw conventional war comics (with fighting scenes, lots of blood, brave heroes, a clear-cut distinc tion between bad guys and good guys) and instead constantly remind the reader how war affects the lives of ordinary citizens. Opting to represent the war experiences of individuals, both authors counter the teleological bias typ ical of many journalistic or historical narratives. Both authors cope with the problems of the aesthetic representation of war and human suffering. On the one hand, Zograf not only tries to render visible the distorted, often absurd re ality of a society under sanctions through his specific drawing style, but also uses the biocularity of comics to tackle some ethical questions related to con temporary reporting on war and the representation of human losses. Lavric, on the other hand, uses the possibilities of narrative drawing to have the reader confront the horror of war, carefully balancing between showing and not-showing in order to avoid turning images of human suffering into mere commodities. Through the medium of comics, Zograf and Lavric have not only given their own artistic vision of the armed conflicts in the former Yugo slavia and their aftermath but also presented testimony to the everyday life and suffering of ordinary people in a time of historic turmoil and war.

Fokusirajuci se na razlicite graficke i narativne strategije primenjene u knjizi Regards from Serbia srpskog strip autora Aleksandra Zografa i Bosanskim basnama slovenackog strip crtaca Tomaza Lavrica, autor clanka istrazuje mogucnosti koje strip kao medijum nudi za suocavanje sa problemima istorijske i umetaicke reprezentacije rata i Ijudske pataje. U radu se obrazlaze teza da Zografovo i Lavricevo razumevanje stripa kao posebnog nacina gledanja poziva citaoca da pred stavi sebi iskustvo pojedinca uhvacenog u vrtlogu rata. Naime, Zograf i Lavric, svaki na svoj nacin, brisu granice izmedu fikcije i dokumentarne proze i koriste razlicite mogucnosti vizuelnog jezika stripa, time podsticuci kod citaoca eticki odgovor na prizore zivota obicnih ljudi zahvacenih ratom. Dok Zografovo koriscenje grafickog dvojnika kao naratora odgovara novijem auto(bio)grafskom trendu u svetskoj strip produkciji, Lavric pribegava tradicionalnijim narativnim modelima. Sluzeci se zanrom basne, on nastoji da prevazide subjektivnu, autobiografsku tacku gledista i tako otkrije paradigmaticne pojave rata. Zografov cesto nerealistican, ponekad cak i apsurdan vizuelni jezik ukazuje na teskoce predstavljanja apsurdnosti rata i zivota u drustvu pod sankcijama i u isto vreme ironicno potkopava i preokrece dominanti nacin njihove medijske reprezentacije. Lavric, s druge strane, koristi realistican graficki stil i sluzi se klasicnim metodama 'narativnog crtanja' (narrative drawing) i razlicitim perspek tivama da bi citaocu predocio sve strahote rata. Usredsredujuéi se na pojedinacne sud bine, njihovi radovi cuvaju, oblikuju i preñóse alternativne price, slike i secanja vezana za krvavi raspad Jugoslavije, a samim tim i problematizuju dominantne predstave o raspadu drzave, ratu i ljudskom stradanju. Zografovi i Lavricevi radovi se stoga mogu tumaciti kao svojevrsna dopuna i alternativa dominantnom istoriografskom i nov inarskom narativnom oblikovanju ratnih dogadanja, i kao kriticki korektiv nacionalis tickim ¡п1ефге1асуата raspada bivse Jugoslavije.</page></plain_text>
