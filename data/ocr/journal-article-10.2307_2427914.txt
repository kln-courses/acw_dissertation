<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NEW PHYTOLOGIST VOL. XXVII, No. 2 MAY 30, I928 THE TREE HABIT IN ANGIOSPERMS: ITS ORIGIN AND MEANING1 BY AGNES ARBER. FROM the earliest times at which the desire to pigeon-hole the facts of the world led man to attempt some kind of classification of the plants which he saw around him, the distinction between the tree and the herb has seemed to him an important one. Theophrastus (born c. 370 B.C.), the earliest scientific botanist of whose opinions we have a record, divided plants into the tree, the shrub, the undershrub and the herb(27). His classification thus recognises a fundamental difference between the arboreal and herbaceous habits, though his shrubs and undershrubs to a certain extent form a transition between the two. Actually to define a tree is a very difficult matter, as one may see by looking at the attempted definitions in the text-books; what we need is to get beyond these definitions, and to arrive at some answer to the question-what is the true inwardness of the tree habit? We must bear in mind that the difference between a tree and a herb is not merely a question of size. A plant such as one of the huge Gunneras, with its vast leaves, soft rhizome, and lack of secondary thickening, is indeed a giant among herbs, but it is obviously not a tree. One might at first glance be disposed to wonder why more herbs do not develop into plants approximating to trees in size. I think the answer is that, both in physical and biological matters, scale is in itself significant. D'Arcy Thompson's great book, On Growth and Form(29), has at last opened the eyes of botanists on this point, which before he wrote was apt to be ignored. We have to remember that with increase of linear dimensions, volume increases more rapidly than sectional area, so that increase of size does not confer a proportionate increase of strength; and hence a 1 The present paper forms part of the work carried out with the aid of a grant from the Dixon Fund of the University of London. PHYT. XXVII. 2.</page><page sequence="2">70 AGNES ARBER magnified copy of a herb would not necessarily make an efficient tree. I think we may go so far as to assume that the most essential feature of a tree is not so much its size as the woodiness or fibrousness that means strength, and in our mental picture of a tree, this feature should take precedence of height, and the production of a single trunk, which are the points usually emphasised in definitions. In the present paper I shall adopt for simplicity the generally received assumption that the Angiosperms are monophyletic, though the question whether they are mono- or polyphyletic is, in reality, still an open one. Now the Angiosperms (reckoning by species) in- clude approximately equal numbers of trees and herbs(26), and if they are all descended from one primaeval stock, we are faced with the problem of whether this remote ancestor was arboreal or her- baceous. In the present century many botanists have offered a-nswers to this question, but so far as I know only two, Worsdell(34) and Velenovsky(30), have made a definite pronouncement in favour of the view that the ancestral Angiosperm was a herb. On the other side we have a large body of opinion-the earliest and most explicit statement being that of Hallier(17), who in I905 definitely derived all Angiosperms from the arboreal Magnoliaceae. Very few recent writers would, I think, accept this statement as it stands, but a number have endorsed the general idea that the primaeval Angio- sperms were trees; we may mention Eames (14), Compton (11), Wernham (31), Sinnott (25, 26), Bailey (26), Jeffrey (22), Ischikawa (21) and Seward (24). A brief statement of this view in one of Sinnott's papers (25) may perhaps be taken as representative. He writes that a "considerable body of evidence derived from the study of the history, structure and distribution of the Angiosperms,. . .indi- cates that the most ancient members of the group were woody, and that herbaceous vegetation has made its appearance in com- paratively recent geological time." Most of the arguments which have been adduced in favour of the arboreal ancestry of the flowering plants will be found in a valuable paper by Sinnott and Bailey in The Annals of Botany for I9I4(26). It is impossible to deal with every question these writers raise, but I will try to consider some of the more important points. The fossil evidence is naturally the first line to which we turn in studying such a problem, and we find that Sinnott and Bailey take the view that the evidence from Palaeo- botany, so far as it goes, indicates that the woody Angiosperms pre- ceded the herbaceous; but they make it clear that they regard this evidence as anything but conclusive. Sinnott (25), however, in a later</page><page sequence="3">The Tree Habit in Angiosperms 7I paper goes so far as to say that "There is evidence that the her- baceous type, save perhaps as a negligible portion of the flora, did not arise till the early Tertiary." It seems to me that there is a serious fallacy here. Sinnott assumes that we know what the earliest Angiosperms were like-but this is, in fact, a point on which we are entirely ignorant. Although the group is first found in the late Jurassic or early Cretaceous, there is no reason to suppose that it took its origin at that time. Everything seems, on the contrary, to indicate that the flowering plants originated long ages before their first appearance in the fossil record as we now have it; so that, by the time the late Jurassic was reached, the class was already an old one. There is indeed nothing primitive or synthetic about the earliest known fossil Angiosperms; the group, when its existence is first re- vealed to us in the rocks, is full-fledged and has long left all traces of its babyhood behind. This point has been strongly emphasised by Velenovsk' (30), who thinks that the Angiosperms must have had unknown herbaceous representatives even in the Palaeozoic. In this lack of records of their earliest phases, there is a parallelism between the flowering plants and the higher animals. The origin of Mammals, for instance, seems to recede further and further into antiquity the more the palaeontology of Vertebrates is studied. Smith Woodward (33) supposes that the Mammals, which in the Eocene replaced the Reptiles of the Cretaceous, "had actually originated long ages before, and had remained practically dormant in some region which we have not yet discovered, waiting to burst forth in due time." Now if we are to regard the Angiosperms as already a mature group when they first come to our knowledge in the Mesozoic, it is clear that the earliest fossils, with which we are acquainted at present, cannot decide for us whether the original progenitors of the class were trees or herbs. But we have still to consider a further argument used by Sinnott and Bailey which does not depend on the period at which the flowering plants originated. These writers have satisfied themselves that there were very few herbs among the Mesozoic Angiosperms, and furthermore that, before the Glacial Period was reached, about 50 per cent. of the Dicotyledonous vegetation of the north temperate zone had become herbaceous; they therefore conclude that the Tertiary Period witnessed a great outburst of herb production, which they regard as a new development in the history of the flowering plants. But they do not seem to have allowed sufficiently for the fact that in the Tertiary rocks there is, on the whole, more chance 5-2</page><page sequence="4">72 AGNES ARBER of the survival of the relics of delicate herbs than in earlier strata. Moreover their estimated equality in number of herbs and trees in the Preglacial Period is based on the study of certain modern floras which they believe to have changed relatively little in composition since Preglacial days; but this is a very large assumption, and con- clusions based on it can scarcely be held to be well-founded. Another argument derived from the fossil record has been brought forward by Sinnott and Bailey; though it is concerned with the Cryptogams, it is suggestive in connection with the general problem of the relation of herb and tree. They state that in the Lycopodiaceous and Equisetal series, "the herbaceous forms have, without much question, been derived from ancestral woody types." Other writers take the same view, and it has become one of the picturesque commonplaces of the text-books that the little Club-mosses and Horsetails of the present day are the reduced and humble descendants of the aristocratic arboreal Lepidodendra and Calamarieae of the Palaeozoic. Eames (14), who holds this opinion, says, " Their survival is probably due to an adjustment to modern conditions, this ad- justment involving the loss of secondary growth, and the acquisition of a low or prostrate habit." There seems to me to be a dangerously anthropomorphic flavour about this explanation; it suggests that these modern Cryptogams have achieved safety in the struggle for existence by adopting an attitude of humility and insignificance, and effacing themselves in an inconspicuous corner. But whatever our view of Eames's explanation, it is unnecessary to discuss it unless it is proved that our modern Lycopods and Equisetums actually are descended from arboreal forms. Now the palaeontologist T. G. Halle(16), whose opinion carries great weight, wrote in I908 that it seemed to him that the arboreal Lepidodendra and Sigillariae should not be regarded as the forbears of the modern representatives of the Lycopodiales; he thought it more probable that the genera Lyco- podium and Selaginella, at any rate, were derived from simpler her- baceous forms which he held to have undoubtedly existed even as early as the Devonian, side by side with their gigantic relatives. The case of Equisetum is more doubtful, but the validity of its descent from the arboreal Palaeozoic Calamarieae cannot be said to be fully proven. Another piece of evidence discussed by Sinnott and Bailey, which, if not exactly geological itself, is interpreted by the aid of geology, is the fact that there is found to be a lack of annual herbs in isolated insular floras. To explain this, they suppose that these insular floras</page><page sequence="5">The Tree Habit in Angiosperms 73 represent vestiges of an earlier and much more uniform flora which flourished over the earth in Tertiary times, before the great flood of herbaceous vegetation (which they postulate) had spread far over the globe. But it seems to me possible that there may be other explanations of this lack of annual herbs. To begin with, it must be decidedly more difficult for annual species to take possession of an island than for perennials. For an untoward season, which hinders flowering, or pollination, or the ripening of the fruit, may easily wipe out a whole batch of immigrant annuals at once, while perennial individuals which have once established themselves, can bide their time for setting seed. Moreover, references to " isolated insular floras " in the literature nearly always relate to islands in the hotter parts of the world-that is to say to places where there is adequate warmth as well as moisture, and which are thus particularly suited to the growth of woody forms and hence to the crowding out of annual herbs. It is useless, within the limits of this paper, to go into detail about the evidence for the relative age of the herb and the tree which might be gleaned from plant geography, because so much of this evidence is closely entangled with the vexed question of en- demism that it can scarcely be discussed independently. But there is a single feature of plant distribution to which I should like to refer. Long ago de Candolle (9) drew up an oft-quoted list of the most widely distributed flowering plants; he enumerated 117 species, each of which occupies at least one-third of the land area of the globe, and every member of this list, as he points out, is an herbaceous form. This certainly seems to indicate a tendency to a more re- stricted distribution on the part of trees than herbs. On Willis's "Law of Age and Area," I should be inclined to look upon this tendency as suggesting, in a broad sense, that the herbaceous form is older than the tree form. I ought to say, however, that I make this suggestion on my own responsibility, since Willis(32) has ex- pressly disclaimed the application of his theory to the problem of the relative age of trees and herbs. The botanists who have been most active in advocating the hypothesis of the arboreal ancestry of the Angiosperms have been primarily anatomists, so that what they have to say on this aspect of the subject demands attention. They differ somewhat as to details, but apparently they all agree that the separate bundles of the her- baceous type have been derived from the dissection of the continuous hollow cylinder of the woody type. It is conceivable that events</page><page sequence="6">74 AGNES ARBER may have followed this course, but it seems to me more natural and unstrained to derive a continuous cylinder from separate bundles than vice versa. The views of Jeffrey (22) on this question are par- ticularly open to criticism, but it is not necessary to discuss them here, since Thoday (28), in a study of the growth and development of the stem of the Sunflower, has laid bare the confusion of thought which vitiates Jeffrey's reasoning'. It is difficult not to feel that there has been a lack of solidity in many of the individual arguments which have been used to support the arboreal ancestry of the Angiosperms. The fact is that there seems to be a very general faith in the ancestral character of the tree, and the derived character of the herb, and, since this is the case, any argument is considered good enough to uphold an edifice whose stability is no longer in doubt. Another example of the inadequate evidence brought forward to support the theory of the arboreal ancestry of the Angiosperms is to be found in an interesting paper by Ischikawa (21), in which he deals with embryo-sac structure from this point of view. His general conclusion seems to be that aberrant embryo-sacs (with either four or sixteen nuclei instead of the normal eight) are found almost exclusively in herbaceous plants scarcely ever occurring in arboreal forms, even in those related to the anomalous herbs in question. From this he deduces that the gametophyte as well as the sporophyte furnishes evidence for the derivative nature of the herb type. But I doubt whether the obser- vations he cites will bear the weight he puts upon them. The fact is that for practical reasons it is much easier to investigate the gametophytes of herbs than of trees, and thus the majority of embryo-sac studies which preceded Ischikawa's memoir dealt with herbs, and the data available when he wrote were not adequate for comparing on broad lines the embryo-sac structure of trees and herbs. Ischikawa may be right that there is a correlation between aberrant types of embryo-sac structure and the herbaceous habit- a conclusion is not necessarily wrong because the evidence on which it is based is insufficient; but if he is right, his results may, I think, be interpreted in another way, to which we will return later. One thing which we should naturally like to ask those who believe that the arboreal habit is primitive for Angiosperms, is whether they can point to any herbs which in themselves give evidence of a tree ancestry. In this connection the work of Burtt Davy (12) is of peculiar importance. This author shows that under the special 1 See also Worsdell (34).</page><page sequence="7">The Tree Habit in Angiosperms 75 environmental conditions of the High-veld of the Transvaal, certain genera which elsewhere consist only of trees or shrubs, are repre- sented by sub-shrubs or even by " herbs," and he regards these plants as forming stages in the evolution of an herbaceous from an arbo- rescent type. I think that the essential question to ask in trying to gauge the value of his argument is whether any of his remarkably interesting cases of reduced arboreal types ought in strictness to be called herbs. Most of them are admittedly suffrutescent, but in addition to these sub-shrubs he adduces certain examples which he classes as herbs, and these we must consider individually. The first is Eugenia pusilla, N.E.Br. (Myrtaceae), which is described as a perennial herb 4 to 6 in. high, though the other members of the genus are arboreal(8). I find, however, on examining the specimen in the Kew Herbarium, that this anomalous Eugenia is not strictly herbaceous. The slender aerial shoots are indeed quite herb-like, but the woody underground axes from which they arise give the plant the character of a geophytic shrub. Burtt Davy's second example is one of the Leguminosae, Erythrina Zeylseri Haw., which he calls "a remarkable herbaceous plant," but as he describes it as resembling " the leafy, floriferous end of a tree-branch. . . cut off and stuck into the ground," it does not seem to have acquired the herbaceous habit with any completeness. Another plant, Menodora heteropfiylla Moric. (Oleaceae), is only 4 or 5 in. high, so one would imagine that it might be herbaceous, but I find that in Hooker's Icones Plantarum(18) it is described as "fruticulus." Burtt Davy does not claim that any of the other plants with which he deals are actually herbs, and it is clear, from his descriptions and also from his striking illustrations, that we have to do with plants which have retained their woody character, though they are reduced to such an extent that their woody development may be almost entirely below ground. It seems to me that his work cannot be taken as demon- strating the origin of herbaceous from arboreal types; his dwarfed arboreal forms furnish, rather, an example of the truth of Dollo's Law of Irreversibility(2, 3). According to this law, no species in the course of its evolutionary development ever really retraces its steps; it may return to something superficially resembling a stage which it has passed through, but the later is never an exact reincarnation of the earlier stage. On this law we should suppose that if the primaeval Angiospermic stock was herbaceous, a tree lineage arising from this stock might eventually be reduced again to something resembling a herb, but it would not achieve the herbaceous habit</page><page sequence="8">76 AGNES ARBER with any exactitude; and this seems to be what has happened in the case of these shrublets of the High-veld. Sinnott and Bailey, having concluded that the herb is descended from the tree, ask themselves what the cause of this change can have been. The answer they propound is that the herbaceous type of vegetation has developed in the north temperate zone, mainly as an adaptation to progressive refrigeration. It is indeed quite true that trees are, broadly speaking, characteristic of warm climates; an American writer has even given us one small piece of direct evidence that a raised temperature may, under certain circumstances, favour woody development (15). Moreover, herbs seem better able than woody plants to withstand a climate with extremes of cold. But because herbs are proportionately more abundant in cold, and trees in hot climates, it does not follow that it was a cold environ- ment that originally produced the herb. It almost seems as if there were something inherent in human nature that inclines us to magnify the effect of environment; and botanists are peculiarly under the influence of this tendency. I believe it is because the plant sits still and lets one manipulate the conditions of its life; the zoologist, on the other hand, has as a rule a much stronger sense of the importance of innate tendencies, because they are less masked in the creatures with which he deals, than in the botanist's more passive subjects. It seems to me probable, on general grounds, that the change of habit from the herb to the tree (or vice versa) is regulated by some funda- mental tendency in the plant itself, rather than by external forces. But it is a matter hardly within the range of proof, and Sinnott and Bailey's hypothesis, and my opposition to it, are both equally speculative. We must now turn to the other side of the shield. A good deal has been said on the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence for the arboreal ancestry of the herb, but it remains to be seen what positive evidence can be offered for the opposite view. To begin with, the first question that naturally enters one's mind is whether any indi- vidual cases can be cited in which there is a strong presumption that an herbaceous stock has given rise to tree forms. This question may, I think, be safely answered in the affirmative. Among the Crypto- gams the Tree Ferns afford a striking example. Bower (7) is of opinion that the Cyatheaceae and the Dicksonieae represent two distinct phyletic lines, in both of which dendroid plants have sprung from an ancestor whose habit was creeping. Turning to the Monocotyledons, we find that the Liliiflorae are characteristically herbaceous, but in the Liliaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Iridaceae and</page><page sequence="9">The Tree Habit in Angiosperms 77 Dioscoreaceae, certain tree forins occur, such as Dracaena, Furcraea, etc. (4). There appears to be a general agreement among botanists that these arboreal forms, with their unusual type of secondary thickening, have been derived from an herbaceous stock; even Sinnott and Bailey accept the view that the Monocotyledons were herbaceous from the first, and that the trees met with in the Lilii- florae are secondary developments. In the Dicotyledons I do not know that we have any comparable examples about which there is no dispute, but in one of the most recent books about the systematy of Angiosperms-Hutchinson's Familtes of Flowering Plants (20) (see also (19))-the author, who has made a special study of the Ranun- culaceae, disputes Hallier's claim that they can be traced back to the arboreal Magnoliaceae(17). He is inclined to believe that the type of wood characteristic of Clematis, Berberis, and the Menisper- maceae generally, may owe its peculiarities to its derivation from herbaceous ancestors, and he is disposed to trace Clematis, with its woody habit, to an origin in the herbaceous genus Anemone. There is a mode of statement, not infrequently met with in phylogenetic discussions about Angiosperms, which seems to me to be the root of much morphological evil: I mean that in comparing two groups, botanists are apt to speak of one as being more ancient than another. But if the Angiosperms are monophyletic, they have all had the whole time that has elapsed since the original stock came into being, and it is a misuse of language to talk of one section of them as being older than another. Now there is a point to which attention has been drawn by Sinnott (25), in a paper on " Comparative Rapidity of Evolution in Various Plant Types," which seems to be of the first importance when considered in connection with the equality of evolutionary age of all existing stocks of flowering plants. This point is the shortness of generations in herbs as compared with trees. Sinnott estimates that in herbaceous species we may reckon fifty to a hundred generations to a century, and with most trees, only four or five; it is possible that he exaggerates the difference, but it is anyhow a wide one. It was said not long ago that " the single step in evolution is not a year but a generation" (6), a dictum which we cannot but accept if we believe that evolutionary change depends on the changes in the germ cells which come about in connection with sexual reproduction. It is thus obvious that the herb will, in theory, have more numerous chances of exhibiting mutations than the tree. And that this is what has actually taken place, in practice, is shown by statistics of the relative number of species in genera</page><page sequence="10">78 AGNES ARBER and families of trees and herbs; for it is clear that the existence of a relatively high number of species in a genus or family means that it has been the scene of correspondingly active evolutionary develop- ment. Sinnott shows that in the Dicotyledons the average number of species in the woody genera is I2*5, while in the herbaceous genera it is I5. When we reckon by families the difference is more striking, for the woody families average 3IO, and the herbaceous 5IO species to a family. The existence of this evolutionary lag'-if we may so name it-among trees as compared with herbs is clearly expounded by Sinnott, and yet he hardly seems to appreciate its full significance. In his previous paper with Bailey(26), they deal at length with the distribution of trees among the families, and present a case that seems to have convinced many botanists that herbs are derivative, but which appears to be open to another explanation, when we re- member the relative rapidity with which herbs can suffer evolu- tionary change. We may take as an example the Leguminosae, on which Sinnott and Bailey lay special stress, and concerning which their view has been widely accepted. They point out that in the Leguminosae the two sub-families, Mimoseae and Caesalpineae, with their regular or nearly regular flowers, and frequently numerous stamens, are without question more primitive than the Papilionatae, with their curious butterfly flowers. Now of the I2I genera in the first two sub-families, II3 are wholly woody, and the other 8 contain both woody and herbaceous forms; there are no entirely herbaceous genera. In the Papilionatae, on the other hand, 29 per cent. of the genera are herbaceous. It is evident, therefore, that the more primitive members of the Leguminosae are almost all woody, but that there is a much higher percentage of herbs in the part of the family with more specialised flowers. Sinnott and Bailey interpret these facts as showing that the family was originally arboreal, and that a subsequent reduction from the tree to the herbaceous type in certain generahas been accompanied by the development of specialised flowers. But, bearing in mind the evolutionary lag in the tree form, it is surely more logical to suppose that the Leguminosae were originally herbaceous, and that those lineages which adopted the tree habit, put a break, as it were, upon their own evolution, and thus dropped behind the lineages which, by remaining herbaceous, retained the power of mounting the ladder of floral specialisation at a relatively rapid rate. The Leguminosae are by no means the only 1 The expression "lag in evolution" has been used by Bather (5) in a somewhat different sense.</page><page sequence="11">The Tree Habit in Angiosperms 79 family in which the same process can be followed. Sinnott and Bailey cite the Violaceae, for instance, in which the Paypayroleae and Rinoreae are almost certainly the most primitive members of the family, judging by the simplicity and regularity of their flowers: and the eight genera which they include are all trees or shrubs. The Violeae with their irregular corollas provide the only two genera, Hybanthus and Viola, which contain herbaceous species. Sinnott and Bailey mention a number of other cases, to which I should like to add the further example of the Gramineae. The herbaceous Grasses have, as a rule, extremely reduced flowers, but the flowers of the dendroid Bamboos approximate much more closely to the usual Monocotyledonous type. The array of evidence is altogether sufficiently striking, and indeed Sinnott and Bailey go so far as to say (with certain reservations) that in practically every case in which there are herbs and woody plants in the same group, the woody plants show a more primitive floral structure than the herbs. And if Ischikawa (21) is right that embryo-sacs with an aberrant number of nuclei are practically confined to herbs, the generalisation can be extended from floral structure even to cytological details. Moreover, in another line of evidence-the comparison of the numbers of woody and herbaceous plants in the Archichlamydeae and the Metachlamydeae-the same idea is confirmed. Sinnott and Bailey show that whereas 68 per cent. of the Archichlamydeae are woody and 32 per cent. herbaceous, among the Metachlamydeae only 42 per cent. are woody and 58 per cent. herbaceous; moreover, trees constitute 53 per cent. of the woody Archichlamydeae, and only 23 per cent. of the woody Metachlamydeae. Since there is a general agreement among botanists that the Archichlamydeae are more primitive in floral structure than the Metachlamydeae, these statistics may fairly be taken to show that the herbaceous type is relatively prevalent among the more advanced, and the arboreal type among the more primitive of the Dicotyledons. Sinnott and Bailey explain these facts as indicating that the arboreal type is the more ancient, but-as I pointed out for the Leguminosae-we are surely here witnessing the result of the evolutionary lag which is a necessary outcome of the tree habit. The systematist Wern- ham (31), writing at an earlier date than Sinnott and Bailey, touched, in passing, on the very trend which they afterwards treated in greater detail. His way of expressing it is as follows: "We have noticed ... that the most advanced members of particular evolutionary lines are prevailingly herbaceous; and that, in the van of the</page><page sequence="12">8o AGNES ARBER flowering plant class there is a general movement towards the her- baceous habit." I should like to metamorphose the latter part of this statement; instead of holding that "in the van of the flowering plant class there is a general movement towards the herbaceous habit," my impression is, on the contrary, that plants with an her- baceous habit show a general movement tozwards the van of the flowering plant class. It is interesting that the evolutionary lag in trees can be paral- leled among animals. Andrews (1), in his work on the Proboscidea, observed that, as evolution proceeds, the length of time taken by the individual to attain sexual maturity is liable to increase, and a ''necessary consequence of the longer individual life will be that in a given period fewer generations will succeed one another, and the rate of evolution of the stock will therefore be lowered in the same proportion." Now just as a zoological analogy can be found for the evolutionary lag in trees, so help can also be had from zoology towards under- standing the significance of the two tangible features which most markedly characterise the tree habit-size and woodiness. Let us first consider size. Zoologists have had more opportunity than has been accorded to botanists of following the history of definite lineages in the fossil records, and they have come to some very interesting conclusions about the general trends exhibited. One of these is the Law of the Increase of Size in Phyletic Branches' (13). On this subject Smith Woodward (33) writes, " towards the end of their career through geological time, totally different races of animals repeatedly exhibit certain peculiar features, which can be described as infallible marks of old age. The growth to a relatively large size is one of these marks, as we observe in the giant Pterodactyls of the Cretaceous Period, the colossal Dinosaurs of the Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous, and the large Mammals of the Pleistocene and the present day." I want to suggest that such gigantism may be a symptom of racial old age in plants as well as animals, and that the tree form is a development analogous to the colossal end-products of those animal lines which achieve an excessive size in the period preceding their extinction. We now come to the second distinguishing feature of trees- woodiness-a feature even more involved in perplexity than the character of size. But I think that the germ of an answer to I This law is not universally accepted; for arguments against it, and against other generalisations concerning old age in animal races, see Bather (5).</page><page sequence="13">The Tree Habit in Angiosperms the question, "What is the significance of woodiness?" may be found in Church's memoir, Thalassiophyta and the Subaerial Trans- migration(lo). This author holds that the transference of plant life from the sea to a subaerial environment, with its intensive insola- tion, and its relatively inadequate supply of salts, leads to an accu- mulation of photosynthetic products; the plant under these changed conditions stores sugars, starches and celluloses, because it manu- factures them in undue quantities and does not know how to dispose of them. On Church's view, "The problem of how to get rid of the excess and redress the balance is seen in ... the timber tree'." The idea that the tree, with its masses of woody tissue, is an organism laden with waste products-that it is, one might almost say, an example of a chronically pathological state-is speculative and impossible either to prove or disprove, but there are analogies in the animal kingdom which seem to lend it some degree of proba- bility. The accumulation of non-living material in the body is recognised by palaeontologists as a frequent mark of old age in animal races. Smith Woodward(33) points to the tendency among all animals with skeletons to produce a superfluity of dead matter which accumulates in the form of spines or bosses when the race passes its prime and begins to be on the downgrade. He mentions, among other examples, the spiny Graptolites of the end of the Silurian, and the horned Pariasaurians of the Trias. Moreover, W. D. Lang, in a remarkable paper on the evolution of a group of Creta- ceous Polyzoa(23), has instanced corresponding accumulations of calcium carbonate, which characterise the ends of many lineages and lead to their extinction. " It seems," he writes, " that, when once the habit of secreting Calcium Carbonate is established, it becomes increasingly constitutional, and the Polyzoa have discovered no means of checking this tendency, which finally overwhelms and obliterates the lineage." Lang claims that "this bionomic problem of the disposal of Calcium Carbonate after the habit of secreting it has acquired irresistible momentum, has been a pressing one among animals other than the Polyzoa," and he quotes such forms as the Rudistae (" Hippurites ") as having succumbed to a disease of un- controlled super-secretion. If we are willing to regard the tree habit as an expression of racial senile degeneration, we may perhaps go a step further, and 1 Thoday (28), on Molisch's authority, draws attention to the fact that trees appear to be poorer in nitrates than herbaceous plants. If this is generally true, it may be significant in connection with the present argument.</page><page sequence="14">82 AGNES ARBER interpret it, not as an isolated pathological phenomenon, but as the final expression of a certain fundamental tendency in plant life. If the power of photosynthesis with which the first green plants were endowed, carried with it, as the defect of its quality, the risk of the accumulation of excess polysaccharides, may not the earliest outward sign of this tendency perhaps have been the formation of the cell-wall? The idea that the cell-wall is in reality a waste product, receives some slight confirmation from the fact that in the Fungi chitin may replace cellulose; that is to say, in plants whose meta- bolism is likely to produce excess of nitrogenous material, a nitrogen- containing compound, rather than a carbohydrate, is used in wall formation. When the primaeval plant cell suffered self-imprisonment within a cellulose wall, it was paying for the privilege of photosynthesis by the renouncement of much of its sensitiveness and plasticity. Move- ment, responsiveness, and the free expression of vitality, were left to the animal cell, which was less encumbered with the products of its own metabolism. And may we not conceive of the tree habit as merely the ultimate expression of the liability to the accumulation of inert organic matter-a tendency which may be kept within bounds in the youthful phases of a race, but which is apt to pass out of control when senility is reached. SUMMARY. In the present paper the arguments that have been adduced in favour of the arboreal ancestry of the Angiosperms are discussed, and it is concluded that they are inadequate to substantiate the theory. Although the whole subject must remain at present largely speculative, it is considered that the probabilities are in favour of an herbaceous habit in the primaeval Angiospermic stock, which is held to have originated long ages before the earliest appearance of the group in the fossil record; the flowering plants, as they first come into our ken in the Mesozoic, would thus be already an old group. The fact that the floral characters of many woody plants are more primitive than those of their herbaceous relations, is attributed, not to their being "more ancient" than the herbs in question, but to the evolutionary lag which has occurred in trees on account of the lengthening of the generations which is a result of the arboreal habit. Herbs with their shorter generations must have been able to evolve more rapidly, and thus tend to show more advanced floral specialisation.</page><page sequence="15">The Tree Habit in Angiosperms 83 The frequency of the tree habit in the Angiosperms is held to point to the extreme antiquity of the flowering plant stock, which has allowed time for many lineages to reach a phase of senility; for trees show two characters which are indicative of old age in animal races-growth to a relatively large size, and the accumulation of non-living material in the body. The tree habit is probably the outcome of a certain fundamental tendency, which is the compen- satory drawback to the capacity for photosynthesis-the liability to the accumulation of waste products. It may be hazarded that the earliest symptom of this tendency, historically, was the deposition of a wall round the plant cell; this has perhaps been the most im- portant single factor in hampering the evolution of the plant as compared with that of the animal. The same tendency may be held to have reached an ultimate expression in the massive framework of the forest tree. LITERATURE CITED. (i) ANDREWS, C. W. Some Suggestions on Extinction. Geol. Mag.
