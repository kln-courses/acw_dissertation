<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 76: 2 : 282 (1985) changing usage of this family of terms is shown to be central to canons of Augustan literary criticism. Patey thus insists that lit- erary construction and interpretation were indissolubly linked to the broader intellec- tual scene. Although Patey's primary interest lies in demonstrating the influence of philosoph- ical theory on literary criticism and con- struction from 1660 to 1800, it is the first portion of his book, "Stages in the History of the Idea of Probability," that will be of particular interest to historians of science and philosophy. Here he examines the con- cept of probability from the ancient world to the beginning of the eighteenth century. He demonstrates that in order to under- stand the concept properly, it is necessary to examine its medical, legal, theological, rhetorical, and philosophical uses, espe- cially in the period before 1660. Patey's erudite interdisciplinary treatment of the history of probability should be useful to all scholars dealing with early modern thought. His analysis involves a repudia- tion of the Michel Foucault and Ian Hacking approach to the development of probability. A detailed critique of the Fou- cault-Hacking hypothesis is contained in a separate appendix. (The preface indicates that my own Probability and Certainty in Seventeenth-Century England appeared too late to be taken into account.) Part II, perhaps of less direct interest to Isis readers, deals with how notions of probability were employed in Augustan lit- erary criticism. The third portion attempts to link this eighteenth-century concern with epistemology and inference to the nar- rative fiction of Tobias Smollett, Henry Fielding, Henry Mackenzie, and Laurence Sterne. Patey argues that these writers consciously demanded certain procedures of probable inference from their readers and that these procedures reflected current thinking about the probable and probable inference. He also suggests that the pro- cedures were embodied and dramatized in the literary works themselves. This book is an important one, for it not only signals the return of literary history to the sphere of intellectual history, and thus to its connection with history of philos- ophy and science, but makes an important contribution to that rapprochement. BARBARA SHAPIRO Sally Shuttleworth. George Eliot and Nineteenth-Century Science: The Make- Believe of a Beginning. xiv + 257 pp., bibl., index. Cambridge/London/New York: Cambridge University Press, 1984. $34.50. Like George Levine in The Realistic Imagination and Gillian Beer in Darwin's Plots, Sally Shuttleworth gives us a George Eliot whose novels cross the boundaries of fiction. For Shuttleworth, as for Levine and Beer, George Eliot's methods are those of the nineteenth-century scientist; but unlike Levine and Beer, who aim to unify science and art, Shuttleworth divides them. Her George Eliot does not absorb scientific method into narrative form, as George Levine would have it, or scientific vision into fictive myth, as Gillian Beer claims. This George Eliot wrestles with scientific visions that go against the grain of her deep-rooted novelist's skepticism. Shuttleworth focuses on a single scien- tific field: organic theory. George Eliot's mentor Auguste Comte and his acolytes, her friend Herbert Spencer and her lover George Henry Lewes, looked for biological organicism in social and psychological life, searching for integrity in man's as well as nature's state. George Eliot's novels con- tinued their quest for social unity: "George Eliot, like Comte, Lewes, and Herbert Spencer, found her articles of faith in the belief that the growth and interdependence of society-the social organism-are gov- erned by the operation of the same im- mutable laws that govern physiological life" (p. 5). Like a good disciple's, George Eliot's novels set out to prove her men's wide- ranging, euphorically imagined theory. When a male scientific idea moves into a woman's experience of social and political life, though, it is forced to confront the na- ivet6 of its own unitary hopes. Shuttle- worth traces the passage of the organic idea through George Eliot's canon as it steadily gains complexity and depth; with each increase in social and political so- phistication, there is an increasingly im- placable failure of organicism. In Sally Shuttleworth's view of George Eliot, the ardent daughter-disciple of male scientific philosophers becomes their inadvertent Cassandra. Like Dorothea with Casaubon in Middlemarch, the priestess of a high- 244</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 76: 2 : 282 (1985) minded theory evolves into the clear-eyed demonstrator of the theory's futility. Shuttleworth's study of a novelist's vi- sion of science is darker and denser than those of Levine and Beer. Their George Eliot is a messenger of cultural wholeness; hers is an apostle of hopeless fragmenta- tion. Perhaps because Shuttleworth's in- vestigation does not yield cheery results, her book is not easy to read, though it gains authority as it goes along. The first hundred pages are dry and expository; like the George Eliot she writes about, Shuttle- worth hesitates to announce her bad news clearly. As she gets into the novels, how- ever, and especially as issues of gender and feminism pervade the material, Shuttle- worth relaxes. She claims that in the novels that follow the inhumanly idyllic Adam Bede, organicism becomes a male article of faith, and fragmentation a female historical reality. Just as George Eliot ar- rives at her own, skeptical vision by testing the theory of her male mentors and finding it unworkable, so Shuttleworth casts off the good student's mask to make a clear diagnosis of the impossibility of cultural in- tegrity for a woman who explores her his- torical situation honestly. George Eliot and Nineteenth-Century Science is a clear- eyed, illuminating account of the idealism of science as it confronts the dampening empiricism of a woman's art. NINA AUERBACH * Physical Sciences G. N. Cantor. Optics after Newton: The- ories of Light in Britain and Ireland, 1704- 1840. ix + 257 pp., apps., bibl., index. Manchester/Oxford, N.H.: Manchester Uni- versity Press, 1983. $20. This book is about the genesis and the etiology of the practice and the science of optics during the period following the de- cline and death of Newton. It is restricted to the period from about 1700 to 1840 and to the British Isles. The popular conception is that this was a fallow era in which little scientific activity and no progress took place. According to this view the century was held in the grip of a Newtonian cor- puscularism whose orthodoxy inhibited, if not prohibited, the development of alter- native points of view-or, that Newton himself had solved all problems perceived as being outstanding at that time, leaving little else for the poor natural philosopher to do in optics. Cantor shows us that, like so many other popular misconceptions, this one is indeed ill conceived. He demonstrates that Newton wavered between distinctly dif- fering concepts of the nature of light and its propagation, that these were offered as speculations-queries, actually-and that they were interpreted as fact, if not dogma, by later savants. Cantor identifies not two but four classes of theories concerning the nature of light. Class needs to be stressed as a larger taxon containing various genera and species of theories of light, each subject to some rather fast-moving evolutionary pressures. (Family rather than class would be a des- ignation more consistent with a biological analogy, but let's not quibble.) The first of these classes is what he terms projectile theories, meaning those in which light is described as a stream or flow of material particles ejected by luminous bodies and subject to Newton's laws of motion. Any deviation of these particles from constant, linear motion is explained in terms of forces analogous to the gravitational force but effective over only extremely short dis- tances. (We are reminded of the weak and strong forces of modern nuclear physics.) Newton postulated that color was caused by particles of different sizes and that dis- persion (the separation of a beam of white light into its colorful components by means of a prism) was caused by the differential effect of such forces on these particles. A distinction needs to be made between Cantor's concept of a projectile theory, in which the particles obey the laws of motion, and the earlier corpuscular theory, which we might assign to a fifth class, as- sociated with Pierre de Fermat, among others. This theory endowed corpuscles with a kind of anthropomorphic quality in which they exhibited laziness and sought the route of quickest arrival. Cantor's second class, to which he de- votes a single chapter, comprises what he calls fluid theories. Here Newton's influ- ence is weakest and the Bible and other ve- hicles of revealed knowledge are of greater importance. Light is conceived as a flow of a fluid analogous to, if not connected with, ideas concerning the nature of fire. It is too 245</page></plain_text>
