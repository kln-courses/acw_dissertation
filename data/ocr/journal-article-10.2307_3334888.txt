<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mumbira: Musical Instrument of a Nyanga Initiation DANIEL RBIEBUY(K T he Nyanga live in the rainforest area, in the eastern part of the Zaire Republic.1 I have elsewhere analyzed various relevant aspects of their culture, which will not be repeated here.2 The Nyanga are generally not known as an "artistic tribe" and are, therefore, one of several Central African ethnic groups that have not yet found a place on the stylistic maps of Africa. In a recent study in African Arts (VI, 2: 20-25, 86-92, 1973), I discussed the intricate meanings of the hide and bark masks and hoods that are used by the Nyanga in conjunction with their elaborate boys' circumcision rites. I now examine an extremely rare type of woodcarving that is made by some Nyanga subgroups for use in the mumbira initiations.3 Under the name mpa, the Nyanga classify a fairly large number of esoteric initiations that originate with the circum- cision rites (mukumo) for mature young men, and continue at various stages of life under such labels and forms as mbuntsu, mangwe, mpande, mukuki, kima, nkekuya, ukanga, kakoka, kasindi, bubire, mwari, bundia, nyamo- soku, and mumbira." Apart from the initiations centering around circumcision (mukumo), none of these mpa are universally distributed among the Nyanga. Celebration of the rites and knowledge of the initiations are restricted to specific local kinship groups dispersed in sections of Nyanga- land. Any particular group or village may hold several of these initiations. Some rites like mumbira and nkekuya in- volve men only; others like mpande include both men and women; a few like bubire or mwari have an exclusively female membership. The initiations are not structured on a hierarchy of grades and statuses but follow the kinship pattern, helping to consolidate the bonds within local kin- ship units and between affinally and matrilineally related individuals across the local units. But there are no linkages of such groups into broader ritual communities. All of the initiations are typically Nyanga in character, but some of them have a distribution that widely overlaps into sections of other ethnic groups adjoining the Nyanga. Apart from the circumcision rites which follow a similar pattern among such more or less related ethnic groups as Nyanga, Komo, Pere, forest Bira, Rumbi, and Lega, the mbuntsu initiations form an intrinsic part of the bwami association among some subgroups of Lega, whereas mpande and nkekuya are found also among some Hunde groups. Aspects of the mumbira initiation are present, as will be indicated later, among a range of forest-dwelling populations located to the north and northwest of the Nyanga, such as the Pere, Bali, Ndaka, Mbo, and Mbuti Pygmies. The initiations are secret, but all of them are fairly simple in scope and content. Sickness, barrenness, death, lack of hunting success, and some other general misfortunes may bring about such initiations which are thought to result in a change of fate. The initiation itself involves exchanges of goods, payments of fees, dances and songs, the viewing (and, in some cases, the audition) of one or more secret initiation objects, the learning of symbolic interpretations and of prescriptions, and the transfer of certain initiation objects and paraphernalia. One or more highly specialized and secret musical instru- ments plays a central role in several of the Nyanga initia- tions. In the circumcision rites these instruments include the bullroarer, two mirlitons, and "talking sticks"; in mbuntsu they are dogbells without clappers; in nkekuya they are the bullroarer, the kumamba percussion sticks, and a hollow trumpet-like piece of wood that is blown in a jar containing banana beer; in mumbira it is the carved figurine which is analyzed in this study. Similar musical instruments are also central to the initiation systems of many forest-dwelling populations in eastern Zaire. In 1955 in the village of Myanga, I received two mumbira sculptures (Figs. 1, 2) from the two senior members of the local Bangara descent group. The overall form of both carv- ings is the same, but there are slight differences in size and in certain details of the morphology. The sculptures are monoxyle carvings in light wood (bukombo-species) black- ened and completely adorned, except on the tail-like ex- crescence, with rows of large white and red dots and circles. The length of the carving in Figure 1 is 261/4?" (minus the natural hornbill beak that is attached to it); the length of the carving in Figure 2 is 241/2". Both sculptures consist of four clearly demarcated parts: 1. A flat, compressed, drawn-out head that very closely resembles the lower part of a real hornbill beak (respec- tively, 7/4?" and 7" long, and 2 /4" high at the maximum). The beak-like head ends in small nose- and mouth-like dents. The carving in Figure 2 has two small and shallow holes toward the middle of each side of the head. No eyes are indicated, but the placement of the dots gives the im- pression that there are eyes. 2. The head is connected by a short, cylindrical, neck-like junction (respectively, 3/4" and 1/2" long) to the second part of the sculpture, which may be regarded as the main body. This part (123/4" long and 10" wide in Figure 1; 10?3/" long and 83/4" wide in Figure 2) consists of a central elongated lozenge with four pairs of inward curving prongs. It can be viewed in various ways. Looking at it horizontally, it gives the impression of a flattened, drawn-out, stylized crab or spider with emphasis in each case on the excres- cences. Looking at it vertically, it can be viewed, both frontally and in profile, as the stylized bodies of two joined personages with arms curving downward and legs curving upward. 3. The third part consists of a barrel-like hollow cylinder (8" long in Figure 1, and 8 '2" long in Figure 2). In Figure 1 the back end (i.e., that part which is aligned with the back 42</page><page sequence="2">? ......... 4i - ... ...... ii iiii if , ........... ? .... ..... ? . . .., ..

In Figure 2, the cylinder is open at both ends (diameter 33/4") but it is divided into two parts on the inside, thus forming a shallow, cup-like container at the back, and a deeper, mug-like container at the front. In the second sculpture the barrel is joined to the main body by a small cylinder (? 2" long). 4. The fourth part consists of a tail-like excrescence (61/V2" long in Figure 1; 53/4" long in Figure 2) which is hollowed out and connects with the barrel through a small hole. The end part of the tail is transversely slit like the mouthpiece of a flute. A hornbill beak has been fixed by means of an iron pin to the carved head of the sculpture in Fig. 1. Stylistically speaking there are few, if any, examples of this kind of carving that come to mind for this part of Africa where composite carvings, ambiguous in representational form and in content, are rare. The objects that are some- times referred to in the literature and that are used among other ethnic groups, such as Bali, in contexts similar to mumbira have not been seen, described or analyzed. An in- complete description by Bouccin (1936, pp. 207-208) of Nasasa, the bird of the mambela initiations among the Bali, comes close to the Nyanga sculpture. Here the representa- tion of Nasasa is said to consist of a hollow piece of wood in the form of a large pipe which ends in the representation of a hornbill beak. The closest type of carvings that can be thought of are the famous wooden, anthropomorphic trum- pets from the Pere [Etnografisch Museum in Antwerp (Fig. 4)], and from Batangi, a subgroup of the Nande [Mus6e Royal de l'Afrique Centrale, Tervuren (Fig. 3)]. The uniqueness of the form of this sculpture can perhaps best be understood in terms of Nyanga thought. The Ban- gara, of Myanga and Mutongo villages, who are great ex- perts in this initiation, tell the following story about the ori- 43</page><page sequence="3">gin of the object. Two female members of the Bangara descent group, Nyabisheo and Nyabiora, were collecting crabs in a river when suddenly they saw, near a cataract, something resembling a bird. They returned home with it. The men concluded that it was a nice thing to have; they took it away from the women and called it mumbira. The Nyanga see a relationship between this term and the verbal root be which designates the murmur produced by a small cascade. Therefore, they say, the mumbira initiation sounds like a murmur, a complaint. They transformed mumbira into the central object of an initiation. When the original object was old and broken, "they carved a new piece of wood in the form of the first object." In Nyanga thought, the sculp- ture is thus the more or less accurate replica of a natural object of unusual appearance that was found near the water. Since both common and unusual things found in the natural environment are used as initiation objects by eastern Za'ire populations, there is no reason to question the veracity of such a statement. Was it a natural object transformed by the action of the water? Or a manufactured object trans- ported from elsewhere by the river? There is no way to trace the exact nature of the original piece, since the Nyanga have no theory or explanation for it. The main point is that the Bangara regard the mumbira sculpture as an unusual and mysterious object which they decided to keep as a sacred and distinctive patrimony, and to transform into an object of initiation and learning. In its essence, the mumbira sculpture is to the Nyanga a bird-like being, ambiguous in identity-something like a kirimu, an extraordinary creature that cannot be easily conceived of or described. The sculpture is the central object in the mumbira initia- tion. For the members of the Bangara descent group, the sculpture and the initiation that centers around it are a ntungo, a sacred patrimony and privilege, which they own by virtue of an old tradition and not through purchase or transactions with other groups. Almost all male members of a group having this "tradition" are initiated. Outside the group, the transfer of the initiatory knowledge of mumbira is to the sororal nephews. The actual use of the sculpture is simple. It must be viewed and heard secretly both by the initiates and the can- didates in the house of the main candidate's mother. The context is one of singing, dancing, eating and beer-drinking, and the setting creates an atmosphere of awe, terror and suffering. It will be remembered from the morphological analysis of the sculpture that its hollow tail is connected through a small hole to an open cylinder; the piece can thus be used as a wind instrument. During the initiation it is placed on its head with the tail pointing upward and a kazoo- like reed is introduced into the tail. An expert singer mur- murs, hums, sings and talks into the kazoo while he or his helpers elicit with cupped hands various sound effects from the hollow cylinder which is used as a sound box. The sounds of different animals such as the hornbill, rongo-bird, mburu- monkey, itewa-rodent, as well as the murmur of the rapids of a small river are reproduced. The general social and physical settings in which the viewing and audition of the mumbira sculpture take place can be briefly summarized. For reasons of sickness or mis- fortune, or for some other less specific causes, a man con- sults the oracle and is told to acquire the sacred patrimony (ntungo) from his mother's people. He promises to do so, and ties a few rings of butea-fiber money to the wall near his bed as a mark of his genuine intention to undergo the initiation. He then assembles the necessary goods (one goat, banana beer and other foods) and accompanies his mother to her village. It is the mother who must ask her people to proceed with the initiation and who must provide them with the gift of a rooster and a kisindi-rodent. Mother and son are requested to return home while her kinsmen prepare for the transfer of the sacred patrimony with offerings and the wrapping up in hides and leaves of the sacred object to be shown during the actual initiation. Male representatives of the mother's group (excluding the senior head of that group) then take the bundle to the village of their sororal nephew. The package is carried on the back with a raffia rope by the head of the junior descent line in the mother's group. Near the village of their sororal nephew, the visitors dress in skirts of leaves, speckle the forehead and shoulders with white dots, and enter the village drumming, singing, and dancing. The songs mention many distant places to empha- size that they would have travelled to their sororal nephew, however far away he was born or had settled. The visitors then enter the house of their female relative (i.e., the mother of the man to whom they bring mumbira), and place the package not far away from the hearth. They receive food as welcome gifts and run around in the village. In the eve- ning they kill the goat presented by their sororal nephew as part of the fee, and eat a lavish meal. In the meantime, the father of the candidate recruits from among his kinsmen two to three men to undergo the initiations with his son. All non-initiates must then leave the house while the visitors prepare the initiation setting. A raffia rope is hung from wall to wall, and pieces of dry barkcloth are attached to it. Many thorny vines with pieces of cloth also stretch from wall to wall. The mumbira object is unwrapped and, setting the figurine on its head and placing a kazoo in the hollow tail, an expert singer hums and sings into the kazoo to produce various animal sounds. The pieces of bark cloth are lit, the candidates are called in, and they enter, following their tutor, called "father-of-the-candidates," in quick pace. While they run around in the house, the initiates shake the rope and the vines so that burning sparks and hot ashes fall on the candidates and their bodies are scratched by the thorns. After the candidates are seated near the mumbira object, the initiates remove the rope and the vines, and wrap them in banana leaves. The mistress of the house de- posits food near the threshold. While songs are sung, the object is packed again in a hide. The head of the junior line among the visiting maternal uncles then invokes the an- cestral spirits and the other spirits of the Nyanga pantheon, asking for plentiful game, food and other good things, for liberation from sickness, and, generally, for their help and their blessing. The mumbira bundle is left for the night in the mother's house while all participants scatter to sleep. In the morning the packages containing the vines and pieces of barkcloth are thrown away; a bundle containing a kazoo and a bullroarer is hidden against the wall near the hearth of the mother's house. The visitors receive food and some valuables (butea-money or iron tools) and return home. The next day the new adepts must fish for small fish with tackle and bait, and give them to the "father-of-the-candi- dates" and to those in their village who were initiated before them. The new initiates now have several weeks' time to provide the meat and the banana beer that is needed for the shaving 44</page><page sequence="4">ceremony. When everything is ready, representatives of the maternal uncles are called in, and the new initiates are shaved in the house of the "father-of-the-candidates" (for this, the hair is wetted with banana beer for "beer is the oil of the initiation"). The new initiates wrap their hair in leaves and hide it. The entire procedure ends with a ritual bath in a nearby river. Apart from the actual initiation, the mumbira sculpture is also seen and heard when the senior head of that kinship group which holds it as a sacred patrimony makes offerings to the ancestors and to the other divinities. On such an oc- casion, all male members of the group bring banana beer and a goat. The senior head of that group may also invite members of other kinship units established in the village to participate in the rites and to be introduced to the secrets of mumbira. Whenever the sculpture is not actually in use, it is kept near the roof of the men's house of the mumbira-owning kin- ship group. The custody of the object is actually entrusted to its senior head (mutambo), but his two junior partners (muhunga and mukungu) are also intimately linked with its ownership and use. In Nyanga thinking, the mumbira sculpture represents a bird, and its connection with the hornbill (mombo) is quite obvious. As pointed out earlier, a real hornbill beak may be affixed to the sculpture, and in one song context, the carv- ing is spoken of as "Big Hornbill with big noise." This bird is of major ritual significance in the Nyanga and Komo cir- cumcision rites, and in some initiation cycles of the bwami association among the Lega. Its beak adorns the masks of the Nyanga circumcisors. Among both the Nyanga and the Komo the bird is said to inflict the wounds of circumcision. Women, therefore, must avoid it and may not eat its flesh (since the bird "sees" how the men are circumcised, the Continued on page 63. .... 3.

Although the hornbill is not actively hunted, snares are set up in the banana groves to protect the ripe fruit. Astonishingly, the bird is not other- wise the center of taboos, omens or prescriptions. But he is frequently mentioned in songs connected with the circum- cision rites, the mbuntsu-and mumbira-initiations, and the evening dance performances. The hornbill is a very particular bird, and the Nyanga are well aware of its biological and ecological peculiarities. Its striking characteristics which form the focus of the Nyanga's symbolic interpretations are the following: 1. The bird habitually nests in a hole that is high up in a tree without strangler vines. This is thought to be an effective means to avoid people, snakes and other predators, and he is thus a symbol of cleverness. 2. Because of these nesting habits, which also include the Konqo, Zaire Fetish Figure Wood, Skin.Gloss 12" high Donald Morris Gallery, Inc. 20082 Livemois Detroit* (313) 341-8575 63</page><page sequence="6">closing off with mud of the hole where the female lays her egg, the hornbill is also thought of as a fearful bird. A story recounts that Hornbill learned to build so well in order to avoid the anger of Hawk, who was preying on his chicks. 3. When people or animals try to remove his chicks, the bird steadfastly attacks the aggressor with blows of his powerful beak. Therefore, the hornbill is regarded as a symbol of war and violence. 4. Because of the heavy and complex structure of its crested beak (the Nyanga say, because its nose is placed on top of its beak), the hornbill is a bird of wonder. This crested beak also entails an aspect of excess, and so one of the bird's praise-names is Sh6but iri (Mr. Excess, Mr. Excedent). 5. The hornbill, which normally feeds on insects, seeds and fruits, also steals ripe bananas in the fields, so he is some- times referred to as a thief. 6. The most important symbolism, however, is linked with the sounds that the hornbill produces when it flies over the villages. The noisy bird is said to speak through its nose like one who suffers from the binyoho-disease, and is thus known by the praise-name, b6kab6kd (Noisy-Flyer). Most of all, the bird is said to be scornful of people because its sound, interpreted in Nyanga tonal language, is obscene (od, od0, iyo6, kirao, karao: penis, penis, iyo6, remove it, remove it!). As a master of scorn-a perpetual insulter, so to speak -the hornbill has close symbolic connections with twins and leopards. In Nyanga symbolic thinking, the hornbill is thus truly a bird of wonder and ambiguity-a symbolic referent that entails its own oppositions and contradictions. The appari- eburnea exports specialists in w. african tribal arts Wood, 11 $135 boite postale 5854 abidjan-treichville ivory coast tion of the hornbill beak on the masks of the costumed cir- cumcisors is explicitly designed to inspire fear in the circum- cision candidates and to mislead the women and the non- initiates into thinking that the circumcisor is not a human being, but rather a kirimu, a fabulous composite creature of the forest. Because of its strange manners and its inherent ambiguity, the hornbill, like the kirimu, evokes the mysteri- ous, the unlikely, the indescribable and unpredictable aspect of the forest. This association between the sculpture and the hornbill is part of a broader, though less explicitly developed, sym- bolic system that aims at presenting the initiates with an ambiguous, complex, somewhat undefinable being. The song contexts make this feature further evident. On the one hand, the songs try to confuse the non-initiates by refer- ences to contradictory and misleading information. But be- hind the deceptive and enigmatic element, they also make certain covert statements about the multifarious nature of the sculpture. It was already stated that the songs contain few explicit references to the hornbill. The allusions to the bird-like quality of the representation are made in terms of chickens (Mr. Big-Wings-of-Chicken), the rongo-bird (the feathers of the rongo-bird), and the feathered dragon who eats chickens. But symbolic references to other types of ani- mals are included as well. The concave contours of the nar- row body that connects the head and the barrel evoke the mburu-monkey which is admired by the Nyanga because of its deflated belly-a sign of its frugality. The tail suggests a long snake. The anchor- or pincher-like excrescences that adorn the narrow body-strip on both sides elicit the idea of the breasts of a chameleon with young. The lengthy, drawn- out figure evokes the idea of the myriapod. Some other song contexts refer to tukurukuru-insects, to the hedgehog "that is rotting in a far-away trap," and to the itewa-rodent, which is a "banana-eating noisemaker." In these cases the possi- ble connections between sculptural form and semantics are not clear, except for the fact that the Nyanga perceive in this complex sculptural form a conglomerate of several ab- stractions derived from the animal world, which all together enhance the ambiguous, fabulous and composite qualities of the creature represented by the carving. The animals associated with the sculpture are not selected at random. They include birds, insects, snakes and mammals which represent the essential categories of terrestrial animals rec- ognized by the Nyanga. They include the two cross-cutting categories of noisy and silent animals. Thus the sculpture seems to symbolize the various animal forces of the forest. The initiation is closely connected, as was pointed out before, with sickness, death, bad luck in hunting and trap- ping, and other manifestations of ill fate. The song context clearly indicates that the candidate who passes through the initiation is in search of karamo (force, strength, good health, long life, recovery from weakness and sickness), and mahano (teaching, learning, explanation and under- standing, insight). This is emphasized in such song texts as "I am searching for karamo" (sung six times at the be- ginning of the initiation in Mboboro village), "I am search- ing for karamo, for honey; my maternal uncle, cut it (the honey) for me," "I am asking for mahano; I cannot know them by myself," and "What is there? My maternal uncle has arrived. What is there? I am asking for mahano. What is there? My maternal uncle, my mother. I come to take the ntungo-patrimony. What is there?" 64</page><page sequence="7">BRONZE KUAN YIN MING DYNASTY 111/4 HIGH HODCX PODQX PRIMITIVE OBJECTS OF ETHNOGRAPHIC SIGNIFICANCE TEN EAST COTA STREET SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA 93101 (805) 962-5526 In other words, the Nyanga believe that to learn about mumbira entails a guarantee of karamo, that is, a revigora- tion of life force, the dwindling of which manifests itself in weakness, disease, death, and lack of hunting success. This diminution of life force, which is in other circumstances ascribed to the anger of the ancestors and/or of the divini- ties of the Nyanga pantheon, is attributed here to a force that is linked to the animals of the forest and to the forest itself. Induction into mumbira is a way of placating the forces of the forest, of restoring and/or maintaining their good will. The sculpture, which is a synthesis of these forces, acts as a mediator in the process of reconciliation. The parallelism between the Nyanga conception about mumbira and the Komo and Pere idea about the role of esumba is striking. These include various initiations, esoteric practices, and objects that cannot be seen by women and non-initiates. Here, too, connections with animals and with the revigora- tion of life force are very close.5 There are also linkages with the maduali, or "animal of the mambela" among the Bali which is used by members of the mambela association, outside the initiation context, in rain rituals (to bring rain or to stop it) and at certain other festivals.6 There are parallels with the trumpet used by the Mbuti Pygmies in the death molimo festival to imitate the sounds of the leopard and elephant, and which is also used in the singing. The general purpose of the molimo festival, held on the occasion of death but which is also meant to improve hunting success and to help a sick person recover, is to "rejoice" the forest, to "awaken it," "to at- tract attention of the benevolent forest deity."7 It was stated earlier that, in addition to the ancestral cult and a number of diverse cults for various divinities of the Nyanga pantheon, certain kinship groups hold as a sacred patrimony (ntungo) the secrets of a particular initiation. Mumbira belongs to the latter group. Those groups that have it find themselves in the special position of exercising a certain influence over the forces identified with the forest. They have, so to speak, an extra power to maintain harmony with the forest, and thus to ensure better karamo. This com- plementary power, exercised within specific local kinship units and transferred to cognatically related units, is com- plementary to whichever powers are agnatically exercised in relation to ancestors and divinities. For those groups that traditionally hold this power, the mumbira sculpture is an iconic proof of it. It is also an element of cohesion around which the members of an agnatic unit, and their initiated cognates and affines, rally and express their unity and soli- darity. Mumbira is one of these sculptures, as we find more of them in Africa, that addresses itself to very special spiritual forces which are impossible to identify in terms of such familiar categories as ancestors, deities, spirits or totems. Mumbira does not represent, or address itself to, any of these categories. It is a secret object, used in a context of initiation, representing a bird-like, composite, enigmatic being that addresses itself to the forces of the forest, and is apt to preserve and to restore their benevolence and to regulate and harmonize men's relationship with the forest. The preservation and restoration of benevolent forces has for the individual and the groups soterial value.
