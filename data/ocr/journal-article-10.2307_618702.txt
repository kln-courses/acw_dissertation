<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Archaeological Survey; and incorporated in Epigraphia Indo-Moslemica and its continu- ation Epigraphia Indica: Arabic and Persian Supplement. The first editor of the former periodical was in fact E. Denison Ross, the subsequent Director of SOAS. The history of Islamic epigraphy in the subcontinent is admir- ably summarized in the preface by Dr. Z. A. Desai, the retired Director (Epigraphy), ASI. Leading personalities and publications in the subject are mentioned, including manuscript works, and local Indian publications nowadays easily overlooked abroad. The story is carried down to the latest issue of EIAPS, for 1975 (issued 1983). Specially characteristic of the ASI in this field is the method of recording known as the' inked estampage '. The process, described here on p. 10, is simple and practical, easily accomplished by local helpers in out-of-the-way places, and requiring no costly and imported photographic apparatus. Yet it has been criticized, by the present reviewer amongst others, as tending to separate an inscription from its background (since the estampage will reproduce the one but not the other), and unable to record associated architecture and decoration. Such comments have some force in the study of inscribed Indian images. The estampages reproduced here are nevertheless superb specimens of the craft, and with Islamic epigraphy have the important merit that (p. 10) 'The impression thus closely approximates the original ink design that would have been prepared by the calligrapher for the stonecutter's use', and (p. 18) '... give a better idea of the calligrapher's original design than do some of the actual stone reliefs still in situ.' Indeed the examples shown here are striking, and must have been truly impressive when seen in the exhibitions at their natural size. Altogether 71 important Indo-Muslim monumental inscriptions are reproduced and described here, chosen as representative of dif- ferent calligraphic styles, historical periods, and regions. Of special value to students (since the periodicals are scarce, and laborious to work through) is Appendix I, listing authors and titles of all the articles printed in EIM and EIAPS up to the 1975 issue. There is also a list of relevant Western publications on p. 20. Appendix II gives the Arabic and Persian texts of the inscrip- tions, with English translations printed in the text. The volume is not just a beautiful produc- tion, but a real primer for the study. It provides as it were a summary 'statement of accounts' for the Indian survey of Arabic and Persian inscriptions. Recently reports have circulated that with Dr. Desai's retirement, there is danger that EIAPS could be discontinued. This volume itself shows the short-sightedness of such a policy, making evident that even without government support, the quality of the material will continue attracting scholarship. A. D. H.

(Monographien zur Indischen Archaeologie, Kunst und Philologie, Bd. 5.) 289pp., 166 plates. Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag Wiesbaden GMBH, 1986. DM 168. This is a revised and extended version of the author's thesis (Ikonographie der Siva-Bild- werke in der Kunst Mathuras, von den Anfdngen bis zur Spdtguptazeit) submitted to the Freie Universitat Berlin in 1981. Studies of the early Saivite art of Mathura have to rely mainly on material now available in museums and galleries since very few items indeed have survived as cult objects in situ, or even in what are now temple museums. The author has, however, successfully cast his net as widely as possible (London, Europe, America, even Israel, and several institutions on the sub- continent itself mainly the National Museum in Delhi, the Government Museum in Mathura and the State Museum in Lucknow) to give us a comprehensive picture of the history, the development, the iconographic significance and relevance of (as far as possible) all remaining examples (anthropomorphic and phallic) which originated in the ancient workshops of Mathura between the third century B.C. and the middle of the first Christian millennium. The book itself is well structured and thoroughly documented. It begins with an introductory part which discusses the basis and importance of image worship in Hinduism and the historical background of the concept and the figure of Siva, as well as the development of the ancient city of Mathura as a centre of gnostic bhakti worship which in turn sponsored the development of distinct artistic styles and modes of representation. The central part deals in detail with the pictorial representation of Siva; the iconographic elements and their sig- nificance; the divine figure itself, dress, hair- styles, emblems, gestures, jewellery, attributes; the various representations of the linga; and the significance and form of the sacred animals associated the Saivite cycle. Nearly half of the book is given over to the 'Katalog' consisting of some 500 excellent photographs, all preceded by detailed descriptions and analysis and very thorough bibliographical references. An excel- lent aid to the art historian as well as to the student of Indian religion. ALBERTINE GAUR DAVID J. KALUPAHANA: Ndgdrjuna. the philosophy of the middle way.

The first contains an elaborate Introduction (98 pp.), and the Sanskrit text (in transliteration) of the Mulamadhyamakakdrikd of Nagarjuna, fol- lowed by an annotated English translation. The second contains also an introductory essay (75 pp.) followed by the romanized version of the Pali text of the Dhammapada (based upon Fausboll's revised edition of A.D. 1900). This is followed by an English translation of the Pali text (pp. 113-53). The author then gives his own commentary (in English) on the verses, followed by an index. Both texts, the Milamadhya- makakdrikd and the Dhammapada, are very important as far as Indian philosophy in general is concerned, and Buddhism in particular. Hence Professor Kalupahana's achievement is praiseworthy. The two introductory essays are reasonably informative and highly critical of the approaches taken by other scholars towards the interpretation of these texts. The second text deals with Buddhist ethics primarily, while the first is 'metaphysical' in the sense that it criti- cizes and refutes the metaphysical theories and concepts of the other Buddhist scholastics. The author expects his books to be controver- sial, and it may therefore be in order for a reviewer, having noted their merits, to venture some critical comments. Kalupahana is highly critical not only of modern scholars like Stcher- batsky, Murti and Radhakrishnan but also of ancient commentators like Candrakirti and his Prdsangika school. As far as the Madhyamika school is concerned, Candrakirti is supposed to have followed Buddhapalita and Aryadeva, and criticized Bhavaviveka and his Svatantrika school. Kalupahana seems to have more respect for Bhavaviveka's interpretation, but there is a problem here. He mentions Bhavaviveka in three places and describes him as one of ' Nagarjuna's disciples' and one of 'the more positive thinkers of the Madhyamika school' (p. 26). Bhavaviveka is said to have ' admitted a positive thesis' (p. 101), but nowhere is this so- called 'positive thesis' explained. Indeed, it is difficult to attach any significance to the term 'positive' here (a case of' vyarthavisesana' in the traditional Indian terminology), just as it is wrong, in my view, to claim that Nagarjuna's or Candrakirti's view is one of' no views' or ' no position'. I agree with Kalupahana when he tries to show by analysing the kdrikds that ' several different concepts in the Buddha's phil- osophy' were referred to and justified by Nagarjuna (p. 101). Indeed, Nagarjuna was a Buddhist and not a sceptic or a Pyrrhonist. I believe both the Prasafigika and the Svatantrika schools accepted Nagarjuna's doc- trine of' emptiness ' (isnyata), and differed only in their method or principles of philosophical augmentation. It was a metaphilosophical issue as to how one could arrive at the 'emptiness' doctrine-by the prasanga method (reductio method), or by a separate, independent (svatantra) inference based upon evidence. This is not a contrast between 'positive' and ' nega- tive' theses. As I shall later point out some areas of disagreement between this reviewer and the author, I note here certain major issues on which we are in a agreement. It is true that the Karikas, 448 verses divided into 27 chapters, constitute a complete book and must be con- sidered together. Kalupahana rightly denounces the attempts of modern scholars which concentrate only on this or that chapter and take a partial view of the matter. The first two verses of Chapter 1 (dedicatory verses) note several negative epithets of pratltya-samutpdda, where a reference is made to the eight different drsti 'views' of the heretics. The last chapter (Chapter 27) refutes eight wrong views with arguments. This gives a unity to the book which should not be overlooked. Any 'central philosophy' must take note of this fact, and Kalupahana's emphasis on the aspect of unity is noteworthy. On the point of' no position' or ' no view' of Nagarjuna, I would make the following observations: Nagarjuna in VigrahavydvartanT did say that he had no pratijni (verses 29, ndsti ca mama pratijni). This was taken by scholars like Murti to imply that Nagarjuna had no position. In earlier writing, this reviewer noted that Nagarjuna had no proposition to defend. Professor David Ruegg has rightly criticized the ' no position' interpretation, indirectly referring to my account. I have since modified my formu- lation of this point. A proper interpretation of verse 29 of Vigraha seems to me to be this. A pratijna is a stated or statable thesis (sddh- yanirdesah pratijna in the Nydyasutra). Hence I believe what Nagarjuna says in verse 29 is that he has no thesis to state (no statable thesis), and hence he has nothing to defend. This does not mean that he has no position. Of course he was a Buddhist and hence subscribed to the Buddhist position and the practices based thereupon. But his ' emptiness' doctrine would be paradoxical if he stated his doctrine, for the simple reason that the statement that all metaphysical views are empty becomes itself a metaphysical view and hence is censured by the same argument that Nagarjuna uses to censure others. But as I have argued elsewhere, Nagarjuna could sustain his critique of all other views if he himself did not assert any view. Having a view of your own and not asserting it as a proposition in a debate are quite compatible acts. This is not identical with having' no position'. With this argument I simply wish to lend additional support to Kalupahana's contention that it is wrong to ascribe 'no position' to Nagarjuna. Kalupahana's general point is that Nagarjuna is closer to the Moggaliputta-tissa and the Theravada interpretation of the Pali canons prevalent in Sri Lanka than to the later Mahayana school. A. K. Warder once made a similar point in his paper, 'Was Nagarjuna a Mahayanist?', later incorporated in his book, Indian Buddhism (1970). This view may be right and perhaps the emphasis Kalupahana gives it is necessary. But it would be difficult to give unequivocal support to this argument for lack of adequate evidence. Besides, there is also evidence to the contrary (unless certain other works of Nagarjuna are regarded as non- authentic). What one should be wary of in this regard, however, is assuming that a true and correct interpretation of the Buddha's teaching is not only possible today but is also available to us, and that it will show all other interpretations to be spurious. Recent developments in hermeneutics often belie this assumption and in 152</page><page sequence="3">been brought out ever since J. R. Ballentyne's 1985 attempt to render the first two chapters. Like at least five among the available English translations (Woods, Rama Prasada, Bfaigali Baba, Hariharananda Aranya and Gafiganatha Jha) the present one also ventures to render Vyasa's expansive commentary on the Yogasutras. The translation under review (' written inter- mittently between long periods of meditation', p. 21) clearly bears the stamp of a devotedly committed personality belonging to a lineage of traditional gurus. A welcome feature of the work is the impressive erudition which it reveals in the informative introduction as well as in the discussion which follows each topic of the translated text, casting its net widely for tradi- tional interpretations culled from several less well known commentaries and for comparisons with other sources. In this respect the enterprise is very well conceived. However, the actual execution of this plan leaves too much to be desired as regards rigorous accuracy and clarity of language. The situation is further aggravated by a propensity to use a verbose, repetitive and long-winded style, in stark contrast to the ele- gantly restrained style of the original, and by a desire to harmonize and synthesize conflicting or disparate views offered by commentaries. The result is an inflation of words and an impoverishment of ideas. Nor are matters helped by reading theistic and Vedantic con- structions into the Safikhya-Yoga tradition underlying the sutra text. The result is regret- table distortion. The following may illustrate some of the unfortunate self-defeating formulations beset- ting the work. On pp. 267-8 Arya makes a sound and helpful comparison between the use of the term smrti in sutra 1.20 and the Buddhist term smrti-sati in Pali-pertaining to the prac- tice of mindfulness. In this connexion he also adduces what might have been an illuminating quotation from BhagavadgTtd 18.73. The quo- tation actually reads: nasto mohah smrtir labdhd ... maya .... Here the opposition between mohah 'delusion' and smrti 'mindfulness, presence of mind', is clear. Hence van Buitenen's felicitous rendering: 'The delusion is gone ... I have recovered my wits'. But what is the unsuspecting reader to make of Arya's topsy-turvy expatiation here: 'In the context of yoga it [i.e. smrti] is seldom common memory, but rather memory in the way Arjuna, the hero of the BhagavadgTtd, uses the term when he says: "I have gained memory" ... Upanisad- Brahma-yogin explains this statement to mean: " I have the recollection of my true nature that I am Brahman ".' An example of a quotation which is bewilder- ingly irrelevant is furnished on p. 299. Paraphrasing, to his own satisfaction, several different commentaries of sutra 1.25, Arya writes: '... bTja means the root. The root of all knowledge, even that seen in small degrees among beings of varying capacities, exists in the Tsvara. Obviously [sic] this pertains to such statements as: " The universe is the asvattha tree with its roots above, branches below" (Bha- gavadgita 15.1).' For Vyasa citta 'mind' is figuratively con- ceived as a river or stream (nddT),-a useful and inspiring model-thus forcefully bringing out some cases it may simply be arrogant to reject all other interpretations as fake. The Pali Dhammapada is an outstanding text of Theravada Buddhism. Kalupahana has done well to present an annotated translation of it. His elaborate introduction is helpful. Of the many points it raises, I shall comment on only one or two. Kalupahana argues that the com- pilers of the Dhammapada were working under certain constraints, notably that of selecting only the verses from the Buddha's recorded dialogue (predominantly in prose); and hence it was not possible to give an exact account of the middle path in Buddhism, for such accounts are contained in the prose section (Kaccayanagotta- sutta and Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta). This may indeed be so. But his next major argument is that the compilers were actually engaged in presenting a Buddhist counterpoint to the teachings in the Bhagavad-glta. This is deba- table, to say the least. He frequently contrasts the teachings of the GTtd with that of the Dham- mapada. This may be helpful, although I believe the discussion is often spoiled by a very unsympathetic assessment of the GTtd. The 'main theme of the GTtd' (p. 63) was not to promote disastrous conflict among human beings in order to get rid of some evil ones. This would be like grasping the snake by the wrong end (a la Nagarjuna). Besides, some factual problems must be pointed out. Under the head- ing 'The story of the GTtd' (pp. 45 ff.). Kalupa- hana notes 'Vyasa, the King of Hastinapura had two sons: Dhrtarastra and Pandu. When Vyasa died, Pandu became king...'. The king of Hastinapura was Vicitra-virya, not Vyasa. When the king died, Pandu became king, while Vyasa was still alive and well, even at the time of the battle of Kuruksetra (when the incident described in the GTtd took place). In fact it was Vyasa who empowered Safijaya to tell blind Dhrtarastra what was happening in the battle- field. This, of course, is a matter of detail and does not affect the philosophical points that Kalupahana wishes to argue about. I have noted the merits of the two books and it is also the sad duty of a reviewer to point out the problems and shortcomings. Indeed, within the short scope of a review, it is impossible to present even a bird's-eye view of all the philosophical issues (some of which are quite important and valuable) raised by Professor Kalupahana. If I have been critical here it is because I consider those two publications sig- nificant in the field of Buddhological research and worth recommending. BIMAL K.
