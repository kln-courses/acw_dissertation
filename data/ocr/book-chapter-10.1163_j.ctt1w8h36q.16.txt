<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter  xi Asmat headhunting and the initiation   of male adolescents The myths We owe a description of headhunting and its complement of male initiation  first and foremost to Zegwaard’s (1959:1020-41) classic paper in the American  Anthropologist. The paper is based on a narrative type of information pro- vided by his main informant, the war leader Warsekomen of Shuru, himself  an expert in headhunting. In addition, a slightly varying but most interesting  story was told to Bishop Sowada by Pirimbu (65) of Biwar in 1979 (Sowada  1980b). In the 1950s Pirimbu, a violent and hot-headed war leader, had  been the terror of the region. He accidentally killed his wife an hour before  Zegwaard’s arrival on one of his tours. He was both feared and praised in the  village.1 Another narrative he told Sowada about Cowoc-Biwar, the primeval  mother of Biwar, puts the male practice of headhunting in a female-oriented  cosmological setting.2 In Chapter X, I summarized the mythical introduction of headhunting by  the younger brother Beworpic’s severing of his brother Desoipic’s head at the  latter’s own request. The talking head of the victim [an archaic precursor of the  modern TV ‘talking head’] spells out how to handle the victim’s body and how  to celebrate the initiation of young males. The story has it that Desoipic was  disappointed about being offered merely a pig’s head, pinned to the floor by  the point of a dagger thrust into the pig’s throat. He demanded a human head  for consumption, and since there were no heads of other people around, it  would have to be his own head. Pirimbu’s story offers an interesting alternative  to Desoipic’s dog-bites-its-own-tail request: On the upper reaches of the Sirec,  near another river specified as the Brazza, and downstream of the Sirec [note  the dualistic set-up] lived two couples. These couples initiated the domestica- tion of wild boars. Their offspring, the wild pigs, increased so much in number  1 Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:252, note 1. 2 Sowada 1980c; for an earlier account, unclear on some points, see Offenberg and Pouwer  2002:197-201. </page> <page sequence="2"> 208 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua that they began to attack people and to make their lives miserable by causing  many wounds. So the men began to wage a war on the pigs. However, the  battle was so uneven that the people became dispirited. Fortunately, one day  a man called Beworpic – the younger brother in Warsekomen’s story – man- aged to kill a huge wild boar. He cut off its head. The people, in a vengeful  mood, tore the boar’s body to pieces, cooked the pieces, and feasted on the  animal’s flesh. Beworpic and his men launched other expeditions and killed  many pigs. [The story implies that humans then succeeded in getting the  upper hand.] On one occasion Beworpic killed yet another boar, severed its  head, and stuck his cassowary dagger through its neck until the point of the  dagger protruded from the boar’s snout. He then called his wife Tewerowoc  [here she is again] into the ceremonial house and placed her on a mat in front  of the central fireplace. Spreading her legs, he placed the boar’s head between  them. Tewerowoc was elated at being honoured in this lofty manner. The next  day she was dressed up and decorated by her husband with soft sago fronds  in her hair, woven bands on her arms, and a finely woven belt around her  waist. He also tied a cuscus fur crown on her forehead and inserted a bone  through the septum of her nose. He gave her a fine carrying bag in which he  put the boar’s skull. She proudly carried the bag wherever she went. However,  she complained that the teeth and tusks of the skull cut sharply into her back  while she was gathering food, harvesting sago, or fishing. She suggested to  her husband that a human skull [without jaws] would be more convenient.  She addressed her husband and the people: ‘You and I hear a man shouting  at the headwaters. His name is Siwet. Go and kill him.’ [Knowing the victim’s  name is imperative in headhunting.] Beworpic and his men took her advice,  located Siwet, and killed him. Beworpic’s first act was to sever Siwet’s head.  He then shared the flesh with the other men [as he had shared the flesh of  the boar; note the parallel]. This head turned into a ‘talking head’, who gave  instructions about the proceedings of the feast and ritual, the decorations, and  so on. ‘When you make a mbish pole, carve my features exactly. Call me Siwet  or Mbish.’ [Compare this with the female Mbish of the story in Chapter IX.]  Beworpic placed Siwet’s head between his wife’s legs, but the talking head  exclaimed: ‘You have placed me incorrectly. Turn my head around so that it  faces Tewerowoc, with the dagger protruding from my mouth.’  This story not only circumvents the ‘incestuous’ fratricide of Warsekomen’s  version, but also introduces the (male-derived) honour bestowed on the kill- er’s wife, which is part of the ritual. Further, it allows for a female initiative in  the introduction of hunting human heads, by reason of the pig’s skull hurting  the wife’s back – an amusing afterthought. Waging war on people is modelled  after hunting pigs. The head is a trophy and the protruding dagger a clear  symbol of male prestige.  Pirimbu’s story proceeds from the animal to the human sphere: Beworpic  </page> <page sequence="3"> XI  Asmat headhunting and the initiation of male adolescents 209 decorated his wife as he had done for the boar’s head ceremony. He added  momentum to it by painting her with white lime enlivened with red ochre.  The people drummed and danced through the night. On the third day of feast- ing, Beworpic and his people took Tewerowoc and placed her in the central  section of his canoe [note the male-centric wording]. She stood sullenly while  the men rowed downstream. At the ceremonial house Beworpic presented her  with a new carrying bag containing Siwet’s skull. She decorated the skull with  cassowary feathers and with grey and red seeds. [Note the progression and  the amplification in the ritual, moving towards the final episode, which con- sists of the initiation of a male adolescent. In the ritual it is the male adolescent  who stands sullenly in the central section of the canoe, and it is to him that a  decorated skull is presented.] The story continues as follows. When some time had passed, Beworpic  gave the command to haul the canoes onto the riverbank in order to dry and  seal them. They then went downstream on the Sirec and discovered some  people hunting for food. Beworpic captured one man and stabbed him with  his cassowary dagger. The man shouted: ‘Why kill me?!’ Beworpic answered:  ‘It is necessary for us to make war.’ He proceeded to stab the man through  his shoulders. He placed the body in an upright position in his dugout and  decorated him with white lime. When he arrived at the village he beheaded  the dead man and placed the head in front of the fireplace. The people cel- ebrated with drumming and singing. During the evening Beworpic sat his son  Ariwetekap on a mat in front of the fireplace and placed the head between his  legs. He repeated the ceremony he had performed for Tewerowoc. [The story  gives all the details again.] I have rendered the narrative almost verbatim in order to bring out its four- layered composition, which legitimates the social institution and convention  of waging interhuman and intergroup warfare on the model of humans wag- ing war with pigs. The first episode of the story establishes the war between  humans and pigs, concluding with the triumphant beheading of a boar. The  second episode connects this war and its pig’s head trophy with the paying  of tribute to the killer’s wife (and her kinfolk). In the third episode a human  head replaces the pig’s head, which adds to the wife’s male-derived honour  and convenience. The fourth episode connects both headhunting and the  honouring of wife and mother with the initiation of adolescent sons and their  classificatory equivalents. War/headhunting, male prestige, revenge, rever- ence for wife and mother, and male adolescent initiation aimed at replacing  the dead (see below) thus became normative and related features of Asmat  society. Zegwaard (1959:1020) rightly stresses the point that cannibalism is  not the objective of headhunting but only a subsidiary part of it. For the par- ticipants, the consumption of human flesh is analogous to vengefully eating  </page> <page sequence="4"> 210 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua the flesh of the boar, the killing and decapitation of which served as a model  for human headhunting.  As to revenge, the story ends with Tewerowoc being abducted by the vic- tim Siwet. Siwet runs away with Tewerowoc, explaining: ‘Why did you ask  your husband to kill me? Now I wish to marry you.’ By doing so Siwet initi- ated the chain of revenge, including the capturing of women.  The third narrative, about Cowoc-Biwar, the female founder of Biwar  (cowoc means woman), also told by Pirimbu, provides headhunting with  maternally inherited vigour. It relates headhunting to the occupation of ter- ritory and to the dispersion of people, and to localized cosmological power.  Cowoc-Biwar is represented as an imposing woman, the leader of her group.  She was peculiar in that she, throughout her life, never had sexual relations  with her husband Baiku (1979 version), yet, and equally peculiarly, produced  offspring. She was a man-woman, yipic-cowoc (1954 version). Initially she lived  with her people on the upper reaches of the Sirec River, indicated as its tail  (epmak) and at present known as the Brazza River. One day she decided to find  a new place of residence. With her older and younger brothers, her husband,  and a good number of others, she travelled downstream and settled on the Sor  River, near present-day Biwar-on-land (Indonesian: darat). From there she and  her people explored the Powec, Asewec, Undir, Pomac and Fai Rivers and, via  the coast, also the Yec, Binar and Oap Rivers. So she is presented as opening  up the entire Asmat region north and northwest of the Sirec River, where she  placed various individual ‘brothers’ on various specified rivers. She herself  returned to the Sor River. After giving orders that the canoes be dried out and  sealed, she departed for the downstream areas south of the Sirec: the Bayir  gully connecting the Sirec and the Bec and the Bec and Ac Rivers. Specified  areas were claimed by specified individual younger brothers. She then set- tled in the vicinity of present-day Biwar-on-sea, near the Omosmos River. So  the story considers Biwar the centre of the entire Asmat world north of the  Casuarinen coast.  On the sands of the seashore of Biwar-on-sea, Cowoc-Biwar planted vari- ous jungle fruits and roots and two coconut palms. She hung her carrying  bag on her spear, which grew into a huge ironwood tree (it fell down, but  a new one emerged and is still there; the area near this tree is sacred). She  continued her journey by travelling to a river near Ac. There, without hav- ing sexual intercourse, she gave birth to a rattan liana (Zegwaard version),  an amber snake, a flying fox, and a yuwur tree for making canoes. She cut up  the snake and divided it among the people she had settled on the various riv- ers, together with spears, bows and arrows. Specified brothers, among them  Acakap (at Ac), received head, tail and gall respectively. Their descendants  will therefore be yokmen, courageous and destructive like the teeth of the  amber snake. Headmen of five specified settlements refused to take a portion  </page> <page sequence="5"> XI  Asmat headhunting and the initiation of male adolescents 211 of the snake. Hence their offspring lacked fighting spirit and were therefore  doomed to die off or be forced to join other villages (1979 version). According  to the 1954 version, she also gave birth to a sawfish (ar) in the Ac area. Hence  the ferocity of the Ac fighters, matching the destructiveness of sawfish teeth.  One day Acakap discovered people downstream harvesting nipah nuts. He  quietly came up to them and killed a specified man, belonging to the Sogoni  people (at present living upstream on the Bec River). The phrasing signifies  headhunting. The next day the Sogoni people killed Acakap. They cut off his  hands and raised them on a spear across the river of Acakap’s people. When  Cowoc-Biwar recognized the hands, she shouted to the Sogoni people that  they were free to consume the flesh and have a feast, on the condition that  Acakap’s genitals (usually not eaten) be placed on the tip of an arrow on the  riverbank. She put the genitals in her carrying bag, which is still in the care of  specified descendants of Ac (Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:253), as an heirloom  (eram ese), a centre of sacred power. After establishing other villages, such as  Ayam, she settled with her husband near present-day Biwar-on-sea. There  she built her own hut and a bachelors’ house. According to the 1954 version,  she did not wear the usual apron of sago-leaf fibre (awer), but wore a star- shaped disc (mbiwamun) with an opening in the middle through which she  urinated. With this disc and the corresponding shaft (nao onak, ‘killing stick’)  she terrified her enemies, said to be the bird people who lived in hollow trees  upstream on the Omosmos River. She was merciless and aggressive and so are  her descendants: they are proud of their nickname ‘the snakes’. However, she  and her people soon travelled further south. Killing people of specified settle- ments along the way, she headed towards Safan, the underworld beyond the  Casuarinen coast. There she settled for good. [The narrative mentions names  of villages which remind me of the Wildeman River (Watiwamen) and Kepi  (Kopa), the administrative centre of the Mappi district. From there, colonial  officials and missionaries made exploratory trips into the Asmat region.] The 1954 version presents a different, viri-centric interpretation of the end.  After returning from the coastal settlement to her residence upstream on the  Sor River, Cowoc-Biwar noticed that her brothers had meanwhile turned into  autonomous leaders. They were no longer prepared to accept her authority. A  quarrel broke out; the brothers joined forces and killed her, her husband and  her father.  It is evident from the two versions of the narrative that Cowoc-Biwar was  not only an imposing woman; she was also an extraordinary person, both  a man and a woman. The 1954 version gives some fascinating details that  confirm her double gender. Children of the woman’s brothers, who are her  classificatory children, came across suckers of the liana to which she gave  birth. Since these suckers blocked the Bayir gully, her ‘children’ had to cut  them away. However, they only cut the right-hand side of the suckers and left  </page> <page sequence="6"> 212 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua the left-hand side untouched, because they were born out of Cowoc-Biwar.  Some un pa, sturdy roots of a mangrove tree, also blocked the gully. This time  the left-hand side was cut away and the right-hand side left untouched. The  Kamoro consider the superior right half of the human body to belong to the  mother, and the inferior left half to the father. Theirs is a matri-oriented sys- tem of descent. Apparently the Asmat have similar beliefs, but then reversed,  in keeping with their patri-oriented system of descent. I take it that the left  part of Cowoc-Biwar, corresponding with the soft liana suckers, is ascribed to  her mother and to the female side. The right part of her body, however, cor- responding to the sturdy roots of the mangrove, is ascribed to her father and  to the male side. Her double nature is repeated in her offspring, hence the  saving of the left-hand (mother’s/female) side of the liana and the right-hand  (father’s/male) side of the mangrove roots. The male aspect of her personality  is evident from the star-shaped disc cover for her genitals. The disc, placed on  a shaft, was used by her and by men as a club in brawls and wars. The Kamoro  also had similar clubs.3 Her disc is said to be still there, as an heirloom in the  care of Biwar-on-sea. Surprisingly, people asked Sowada if he would like to  see it. Pirimbu showed it to him in 1979, on condition that he would not insist  on purchasing it. The narrator, Pirimbu, solemnly placed an aged carrying bag, closed at the top  with a bone pin, on a mat in the centre of the [bachelors’] house. He proceeded  to open the bag slowly, and cautiously removed the object inside, which was  attached to a cord. To my surprise it was a deep black star axe, with a hole in its  centre. As he placed the axe gently on the mat, I admired it, explaining that I had  never seen an axe so beautiful. I made a motion to pick it up, but a hand stopped  me. An elder explained that the object could not be turned about or turned over  indiscriminately, since it was sacred. They went on to explain that Tjawotsj-Biwar  wore the axe beneath the genitals. One of its prongs stuck out, making her appear  like a man to other people. The area of the axe’s hole was liberally covered with  waseh, the red paint made from burnt mud. There were mud spots on one of its  prongs and I asked their significance. The people explained that whenever anyone  dies, as had happened the previous day, mud is placed on the axe. Then, as we  were discussing the axe, one of the elders got up, pointed to the hole in the axe,  and excitedly explained that the opening represented the opening from which  pigs, crocodiles, other animals, and men, too, were born. [Compare with the 1954  version, which has it that the woman urinated through the opening in the disc.] [...]  I asked whether, at one time, they had used the axe in warfare or for opening the  skulls of enemies in order to extract the brains [Sowada apparently mistakes the  club’s disc for an axe.] Surprised at the question, they stressed that its use in such  a manner was forbidden. When I asked how the axe was obtained from Tjawotsj- Biwar and handed down through the generations, they said that this was the axe  3 For a description and illustrations, see Smidt 2003:86-7. </page> <page sequence="7"> XI  Asmat headhunting and the initiation of male adolescents 213 that Tjawotsj-Biwar had hung in a carrying bag on a spear on the Omosmos River.  Later, the woman Darkau, while fishing on the Omosmos, had discovered the  spear and the carrying bag in the jungle. It had been there for a long time, as the  bag had deteriorated considerably and one of the axe prongs stuck out through  the bottom. As Darkau did not know what the object was, she ran off to call her  husband, Yuwus. She brought her husband to the spot. Yuwus, too, was puzzled.  He carefully lifted the bag by the strap with a piece of wood. They took it into their  hut. Yuwus, afraid of the object inside, attempted to remove it with wooden fire  tongs, without success. Finally, Darkau pulled the axe out with her hand. At that  moment they realized that the axe had belonged to Tjawotsj-Biwar, and that it was  necessary and good for them to have it. To the people of Biwar Laut [Indonesian  for ‘sea’], the axe is proof of Tjawotsj-Biwar’s existence and of her being the origin  of the people. To this day, the axe is handed down through her relatives. (Sowada  1980b:68-9.) This extraordinary field report by Sowada provides us with clear evidence  that Cowoc-Biwar is considered the primeval Mother of the Human World,  man himself included, at least as far as Biwar is concerned. She is the sacred  ‘lord of the land’, she opened it up, furnished and allocated it. Her sacred  heirloom-disc symbolizes fertility and virility, female and male genders.  The disc in combination with the shaft is a powerful weapon that represents  dominant male power. However, the constituents of the disc, namely the  prongs and the hole, represent male gender and virility and female fertility,  respectively. It may be concluded that the person and the emblem connote  the ambivalence of gender and of male/female power. Compare this with  Baicep, the huge anthropomorphic male/female sacred pig of the mountains,  whose children are the male ancestors of the Bismam people, who are like- wise dispersed (see Chapter VI). Note that their territory overlaps the terri- tory claimed by the Biwar people, so that there are competing claims. The  aggressive features of Baicep were also passed on to his/her descendants.  He is believed to still protect and encourage his offspring by accompanying  them wherever they go. With their paddles they create semicircular waves  that are shaped like Baicep’s tusks. Baicep will then make the waves bigger,  so that enemy canoes have difficulties and capsize (Offenberg and Pouwer  2002:215). Naneu, his eldest son, afraid of being outstripped by his younger  brother Ewer, shot a female being in the crown of a tree belonging to the bird  people, a being said to be not human but crazy and dangerous for humans.  Ever since, Naneu’s male descendants are equally reckless when attacking  an enemy (Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:213). Ewer earlier killed a turtle that  turned out to be a local female guardian, called Buciawuc. She exclaimed:  ‘Who are you? Why do those people from above come here to bother people  from below? Because you have shot me, you may not stay here, but must set- tle on the coast.’ The people cut her up, consumed her flesh, singed her hair  and rubbed it over their head and shoulders [thereby identifying with the  </page> <page sequence="8"> 214 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua victim, as in headhunting rituals]. Her emptied head was put in a bag as a  sacred heirloom (Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:213).  Baicep and Cowoc-Biwar can be said to relate as male/female to female/male,  and so do their competing descendants, the Bismam and Biwar peoples. The  double and ambivalent gender is reflected in the ambilineal Asmat practice  of appropriation of land, in the ideas and practices of war and headhunting,  and in the ambilineal practice of descent, although patrilineal descent tends  to predominate.  How do the Kamoro traditionally conceive of the Asmat? They used to  call them we manawe, that is, people who are eaten by people, not people  who eat people (mana means food/eating),4 yet they were feared for just this.  The neighbouring Sempan were constantly on their guard. When somebody  shouted ‘We manawe’, people took to their heels; the term connoted terror.5  The denotation of cannibals is reflected in a narrative related to Zegwaard by  Epepea of Iwaka (Kamora River, Central Mimika) and in an abbreviated ver- sion of it related to me by Tay, a well-known leader and storyteller of Keawkwa,  Central Mimika (Zegwaard 1952:51-3; Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:195-7). The  story deals with Manawe, said to live in an area east of the Sempan and west  of the Asmat. Upstream is the Akimuka catchment area where the Nafuaripi  live; downstream are the Miwar estuaries, situated west of the Sirec River near  the border of the Asmat region. It is this area from which the great trek to the  Mimika region is said to originate. The names of the terrifying culture heroes  and giants Aoweyao and Mbiminareyao who set the trek in motion are associ- ated with this area. The main theme of the narrative is a rebellion by children  against their parents, with the former being punished by the latter.  Epepea’s version of the story is as follows. The men and women of a  Manawe settlement in the far east leave the village in order to catch fish and  collect pile-worms in the downstream mangrove forest. They are unwilling to  take their children with them, so they leave them behind in the care of a few  elderly people. One of the boys, Minare [name derived from the Minar estuar- ies], is furious. He initiates a rebellion of all the boys and girls of the village.  They board canoes and go upstream. An old mother’s brother of Minare sym- pathizes with him and joins the party. En route the children grow up fast, as  is usual for culture heroes. They build a longhouse. The mature, strong men  divide the women of equally magnificent build among themselves. Some cou- ples live upstream, some midstream, and some downstream in the longhouse;  in short, it is a full-grown village.  Minare, having grown into a real giant, has his apartment at the end of  the village on the riverside (as is appropriate for the leader of a settlement).  4 Zegwaard, cited in Pouwer 1955a:1. 5 Trenkenschuh 1970b:111, quoted by Van der Zee 2005:29. </page> <page sequence="9"> XI  Asmat headhunting and the initiation of male adolescents 215 When their parents return from fishing in the evening and call out for their  children to receive their portion of pile-worms, there is no answer. Informed  by the elderly people that the children have rebelled against them and gone  upstream, the parents cry. Minare’s parents prepare a bundle of fish and  pile-worms to placate their son. They leave the village the following day to  look for him. When they arrive at the longhouse in the early morning, the  mother approaches his apartment cautiously. She whispers her son’s name,  but he shouts with a gruff voice: ‘Who is there?’ His frightened mother takes  to the canoe. Minare’s mother’s ‘brother’ interferes. The parents are invited  to the scene by Minare’s [brand-new] bride-givers and then surrounded by  the rebels, who threaten them with their lances. The parents ask their son for  forgiveness. They are ‘paid’ for being frightened with a copious meal of wild  game. The parents return to the village carrying a yardstick given to them,  which indicates the height of their son and his age-mates and is meant as a  challenge: ‘We are grown up and married’. The people of the village respond  to the challenge by preparing for war (wiko). When they approach the long- house, they mistake the mother’s brother of ordinary height for his sister’s son  Minare. They feel cheated, and launch an attack. Minare’s mother’s brother  answers the challenge by shooting quite a few men. A canoe capsizes. Then  Minare, thus far concealed behind the longhouse, comes into the open; people  panic. He boards his canoe, advances towards them and, standing at the bow,  shoots and kills all the men on his left-hand side, but saves the lives of the men  on his right-hand side [Kamoro: mother’s side, Asmat: father’s side].  The losers, after a period of mourning, plan a counter-attack. A scabby old  woman, the wife of one of them, attracted by the saga of the giant warlord,  runs away and joins him by means of a ruse: she attracts him by imitating  the call of a crown pigeon. Sitting in his canoe she offers him food, which  he accepts grudgingly because he has noticed red entrails hanging from her  vulva. However, after taking a shower she is reborn as a magnificent lady.  He finds her under a mat. They embrace and she becomes his [second?] wife.  The men of the village, further infuriated by the elopement, wage another  war against Minare. After some heavy fighting, while moving to the bow,  Minare does not notice a hole in the canoe. He falls through and gets stuck.  His enemies take this opportunity to kill him. [An adversary of Aoweyao and  Mbiminareyao meets his death in a similar way.] Accompanied by his weep- ing lover, they take his body to the village as a trophy and drop it on mats  in front of his parents’ hut. Then the bride-receivers, acting in reverse to the  normal practice of caring for an affine, slice the body into pieces, which are  then divided according to the rules of distributing flesh among relatives and  affines. Even his father and mother receive their normal share. At night a boy  asks his mother for water because the meat was very fatty. She goes outside  to help herself to water. Meanwhile a female spirit (mbi kapere) takes her place  </page> <page sequence="10"> 216 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua and offers water to the thirsty boy. When the real mother re-enters, she and  her son realize what has happened. The female spirit, accompanied by another  one, has bewitched the meat by blowing over it: ‘This is our punishment, for  you have killed Minare.’ They bewitch the houses as well: these topple and  sink into the earth.  Tay’s shortened version offers a different interpretation: The parents and  their rebellious children are not Manawe but Kamoro culture hero-ancestors  (amoko we). They are not cannibals. Cannibalism arises from the bad conduct  [Tay’s personal comment] of Minare rebelling against his parents, a capital sin.  Punishing him is correct in principle. When the children defeat the parents,  the latter enlist the support of the Manawe (Asmat), the Naowapinera people  originating from the parents’ area later at Koperapoka basin, and the Tarya  We of West Mimika. The giant Minare and his age-mates are then defeated.  He is killed by a Manawe. It is the Manawe who chop Minare into three por- tions: they lop off his head and divide his body lengthwise into two. They  give the left part of the torso to the people from below (that is, from the west),  the Kamoro. They say: ‘Eat it, it is nice and fat.’ But the Kamoro say: ‘No, that  is not proper, not right.’ They use the bones, sharpen them, and make spears  from them. The Manawe eat all the meat, including the head. They take the  women with them, as is usual after a headhunting raid.  So the two versions agree in that the leader of the revolt against the parents  is killed and his body cut up. Note that the Kamoro term wiko, denoting the  attack, refers to a brawl within the group or the federation. In this context  killing, and even more so headhunting, is in principal prohibited. If killing  does occur, indemnification is called for. Wiko, internal brawl, is opposed to  mokare, war with people outside one’s own group or federation. The corre- sponding Asmat distinction is between owen on one hand and ndao mber on  the other. The latter term means headhunting, and can also mean a person  whose head has been taken.6 In the first version the parents-in-a wider- sense are punished for their ‘incestuous’ cannibalism by female spirits. In the  second version the enlightened, sophisticated village chief Tay ascribes can- nibalism to the Asmat, not to the parents’ group. The Kamoro merely prefer  the bones to the flesh, an inversion of a Dutch saying, because human bones  lend themselves better for daggers than cassowary bones. Tay’s message is:  We are civilized people, the Asmat are not. The two versions correspond in  negating the conspicuous role of the severed head in Asmat myth, ritual and  social life. In a comment on the Iwaka narrative, Zegwaard notes that, when  the Asmat of Yoni were told the end of the Iwaka story, they were surprised  to learn that the Kamoro are familiar with a story which they had assumed  6 See Voorhoeve 1965:342 under now; Van der Schoot 1969:42. </page> <page sequence="11"> XI  Asmat headhunting and the initiation of male adolescents 217 was known only to them. My guess is that, assuming that an Asmat version  of the Iwaka story really exists – Zegwaard gives no evidence – it might  serve to legitimize the Asmat norm not to raid nor to take heads of people or  groups considered closely related or allied. However, political intrigues often  circumvent the norms.7  The ritual In this section I have rearranged the data provided by Zegwaard in his 1959  article in the American Anthropologist and in earlier typed drafts under a  number of headings, so as to offer more systematic intelligibility: prelude,  the raid, initiation. We concentrate on the ritual aspects. Zegwaard had ample  opportunity to study headhunting practices on hundreds of occasions, since  he was the first white man to take up residence at a time when Dutch colonial  rule was not yet established there (Zegwaard 1959:1020). Raids, however,  were relatively rare, as these require a good deal of ritual preparation and  the well-planned organization of assistance by alliances. People preferred to  avail themselves of opportunities that came to hand, which did not require  preparation, such as treacherously killing guests or people who ventured too  far from home. It often happened that visitors were cordially welcomed, even  given presents, but later killed, preferably in their sleep. The protecting fam- ily acting as host was overruled by the majority of the settlement and humili- ated. After one such occasion in Shuru, a hosting warlord and his group  broke away and built a new bachelors’ house at another spot. Prelude There are a variety of methods of ritual preparation. The very variety points  to both the importance attached to a raid and the risks of waging it.  1. Simulation. It is believed that simulation of a raid ensures its success.  A major type of simulation is the Firao Wu ceremony that opens the  celebration of constructing a new men’s house. Among the many sago  palms – sometimes hundreds of them – cut down for the maturation of  sago beetle grubs, there is an outstanding one impersonating an enemy.  The ‘enemy’ is ‘killed’ by pig hunters – the strongest men – and hit with  spears and daggers when ‘he’ falls down. While the lower part of the palm  is sliced and provided with openings for the beetles to deposit their eggs,  7 For an example, see Van der Schoot 1969:41, as cited by Van der Zee 2005:105. </page> <page sequence="12"> 218 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua the upper part is opened carefully so that the body of young palm pith  ending in a thick knob, kus (head), can be removed in its entirety. This  is decorated with rattan and various types of leaves, and then carried in  procession to the canoe on the shoulders of a number of enthusiastic men,  to the accompaniment of a singing and dancing audience. The ‘pith man’  is placed in a vertical slumped position in the canoe on a number of cross- pieces (similar to handling the body of a slain man). On their way to the  village the men sing the cloud song (see below) and the paddle song, as  is usual when returning from a headhunting raid. There is bamboo-horn  blowing and a loud reception in the village, where the oldest man asks:  ‘What have you brought?’ And the reply of a senior man in the canoe is:  ‘We have killed a big man, he is lying in the canoe.’ There is much yelling  and throwing of lime. At dusk the ‘pith man’ is taken to the men’s house  and surrounded with chunks of sweet sago pith. His head is severed and  his body cut up into chunks that are hurled in the direction of the senior  men and consumed by them. At midnight the ‘head’ is consumed in secre- cy by some of them (compare this with the secret consumption of sago  grubs by senior men during Kamoro Kaware). A ‘pith man’ may also rep- resent a deceased relative instead of an enemy. Father van Kessel reports  from Basim that the ‘head’ of two ‘pith men’, named after the dead parents  of the feast-giver, was fried and consumed by his bride-receivers (Van  Kessel 1962:2). Evidently one does not eat one’s ‘own’ head. According to  Zegwaard’s typed field notes on Firao Wu, this ceremony is also enacted  as a preliminary to large fishing or pig-hunting parties. There is a clear  analogy between the three Kamoro modes of simulating a successful pig  hunt as described in Chapter IV on the one hand, and Asmat simulation  of a man-hunt (or fishing and pig hunting, for that matter) on the other,  but an equation of the Kamoro pig hunt with the Kamoro man-hunt, as  suggested by Zegwaard (1959:1030), is not warranted by ethnographic  evidence.    Simulation may also be performed by means of a graphical pantomime.  A Shuru warlord imitated a woman preparing to pound sago and her male  companion looking for his paddle, bow and arrows. He then enacted their  departure for the sago woods. His men picked up the hint and laid an  ambush near the Seper River. Shortly two men from Amberep arrived and  were killed. Their wives, who had followed at some distance, managed to  escape. Had the warlord only foreseen this arrival, or had his pantomime  induced them to come along? The Shuru people are inclined to believe the  latter (Zegwaard 1959:1035).   2. Evocation of or identification with the founding ancestor. In Shuru a pig  hunt was organized on the eve of a headhunting raid. The pig was butch- </page> <page sequence="13"> XI  Asmat headhunting and the initiation of male adolescents 219 ered in an open space between the war canoes, lined up in two rows. The  pig’s head was offered to the leader of the raid. This evoked the presence  and support of the mythical founder Baicep, an androgynous pig believed  to join the raid and to cause a curved swelling of the water corresponding  with his curved tusks; this turbulence of the water gets the enemy into  trouble.   In Amberep one of the women dancing on the eve of a raid tied the  head of a pig to her buttocks. The older men were supposed to comment  that it would be better to have a dance with human heads, a clear allusion  to the myth accounting for headhunting (Zegwaard 1959:1035). In Biwar  the men sat around the sacred disc of their founding female ancestor. By  moving their bellies in the direction of the disc while sighing, they evoked  emulation of the courage of the ancestress, and of the ferocity of her ser- pent and sawfish offspring (Zegwaard 1959:1033). Were they emulating  their birth?   Each founding ancestor left to his/her descendants sacred objects, kept  in a bag, eram ese: tusks of a wild boar, a string of dog’s teeth, the gall of  some serpent, and so on. These objects or ‘things to frighten with’ (omer  pok) are manipulated to scare the enemy and make him an easy prey  (Zegwaard 1959:1033).  3. Enticing the enemy. On the occasion of the inauguration of a new men’s  house, the lower part of a thin ‘magical’ trunk (eram asa) is smeared with a  particular mixture. Its ingredients and the kind of tree are known only to  the performer. One of the ingredients seems to be cassowary fat. At night  fires are solemnly built in the new fireplaces. One of the leaders holds the  trunk in the fire. Its smoke has a penetrating smell. The wandering souls  (nam yipi) of much feared enemies are conjured and invited to consume  the smell. If such a soul, when roaming around while its owner is asleep,  ‘eats’ the smell of the trunk, or the smell of roasted pig or some other food,  this person is likely to be killed a few days later by the inhabitants of the  ‘hosting’ village. This person’s friends may be able to avert the disaster if  they notice the wandering soul (Zegwaard 1959:1030). Similarly, a ball of  sago and some sago grubs may be placed on a small platform in a river  bend near an enemy’s settlement. By uttering a spell while lifting the food  in the enemy’s direction and throwing some sago grubs in the river that  drift towards the village, the souls of the enemy are enticed (by the smell  of the food offered) to draw near. The bodies will follow shortly and can  then be killed. This kind of enticing is called fo fum, meaning ‘carried by  the wind’ (fum). The ceremony is performed by young males united in a  joking relationship (as akap; compare Kamoro akapa) on the occasion of an  imu (Kamoro: imu) play involving joking and jostling. This play confirms  </page> <page sequence="14"> 220 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua the spiritual ties between boys and girls who have their spiritual name in  common, given to them by a (usually female) medium (namer ow) shortly  after they were born. This generates life-long ties of friendship between  age-mates. On this occasion the age-mates offer sago grubs to their bride- receivers, but only after they have offered fum food to the enemy’s souls  (Zegwaard 1988a). In my view this ceremony commits young males to  participate in warfare if need be. A similar ceremony is performed on the  occasion of unveiling the carved memorial prow of a canoe named after  someone who has been killed. The brothers-in-law of the deceased are then  the performers. The platform is erected in the vicinity of the spot where  their affine died. The food is offered to the spirit of the deceased, and is  not meant for the enemy. It is even taken back, roasted and eaten by the  brothers-in-law themselves. The carving is then revealed by removing the  mat that covered it. By this token the brothers-in-law commit themselves to  take revenge. The ceremony is considered a threat (Zegwaard 1959:1031).    The odour of the massive quantity of sago grubs thrown into the tube  fashioned for the sago grub ritual on the occasion of the inauguration of a  men’s house (see Chapter IX) is also believed to attract the roaming souls  of enemies (Zegwaard 1988a).    Finally, enemies are lured into an ambush with the collarbone of a turtle  or with a forked bough, while the war leader beckons: ‘Come this way.’ In  an opposite movement, sorcerers approach the village to be attacked on  the eve of the raid and throw water in the directon of the enemy or blow  water through a loophole (Zegwaard 1959:1034).  4. Augury. A dignitary smears his right hand with lime powder mixed  with pulverized leaves; he rubs the hand faster and faster, so vigorously  that blood trickles down: there is going to be bloodshed. The raid will be  successful. In a shamanistic trance he takes his right hand in the left one  and swings both hands through the air while moving up and down the  men’s house. Suddenly he runs at a man and makes a movement as if sev- ering his head and slicing his body. He regains his senses by holding his  hand in a fire (Zegwaard 1959:1035).  5. Psychological warfare. Implements of war such as arrows are placed in  conspicuous places to intimidate the enemy. A favourite trick is spread- ing lies (nao piri), which is intended to confuse enemies and make them  nervous. A go-between man is selected, for instance because his decapita- tion name originally belonged to someone in the enemy’s village, or his  mother originates from there, or because he is being given in ransom by  the village concerned. All the men present rub his body with chewed sago;  sometimes the sago is mixed with his blood. The man then departs for the  </page> <page sequence="15"> XI  Asmat headhunting and the initiation of male adolescents 221 enemy’s village to spread concocted rumours. For instance he makes them  believe that his fellow men have left for a fishing party; this gives the pro- spective victims an opportunity to slyly gather sago on the territory of the  people thought to be absent for fishing. These villagers are then attacked  (Zegwaard 1959:1032).    All sorts of body ornaments such as red ochre, white chalk, black ash,  bones and feathers, nose shells and other symbols of strength and cour- age, are meant for display as well as to frighten the enemy. These body  decorations are armaments as much as ornaments. Consequently, they  are banned when on friendly visits, as they invite trouble (Zegwaard  1959:1033).    Last but not least, there is the custom of bragging and boasting (dewen  atakam) about the number of men or women a person has killed; he enu- merates their names and the exact locations of killing. This is performed  on various occasions, such as at the first stroke of the axe when carving  an ancestor pole – Kamoro men then call out their mother’s or grand- mother’s name – or when a sago-grub tube is opened, or when new  warriors are inaugurated. Boasting is meant to impress and frighten visi- tors. Interestingly, bragging also occurs in awkward situations, when the  braggers are not self-confident and do not feel at ease. While travelling on  unknown rivers, for instance, at every tributary and also at whirlpools,  which are thought to be entries to the underworld, men boast about their  exploits. Even after death, the deceased is believed to tell hair-raising  stories about his achievements in an attempt to frighten the dangerous  spirits and to overcome his own fear. The potential danger of new situ- ations, awkward experiences or encounters (such as meeting foreigners)  is thought to be neutralized by boasting. The Kamoro speak of kaypiri,  a new and potentially harmful situation (Zegwaard 1959:1031). When  travelling by canoe to the far western part of Mimika, I noticed that my  rowers, unfamiliar with the area, moved their paddles backwards, making  the water splash: ‘Kaypiri’, they exclaimed. They tried to counteract the  potential danger by behaving themselves contrary to ordinary behaviour  – an analogy of abnormalities! Most interestingly, Kamoro kaypiri is the  linguistic equivalent of Asmat papish, the ceremonial, strictly regulated  swapping of wives for one night by papish friends, briefly referred to ear- lier (Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:237-41). The Asmat myth accounting for  this institution deals explicitly with an unusual situation encountered on  a fishing trip8 by Biwiripic [again] and his wife Kankani – a name con- noting something unusual, strange, the realm of spirits – of Basim. They  8 For an example of this, see Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:201-4. </page> <page sequence="16"> 222 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua chase a fish with harpoons but in vain: the fish turns out to be a spirit. The  spirit in the guise of a fish takes them to the underworld, where they are  hosted by their deceased relatives. The different atmosphere, however,  turns the female visitor into a seemingly dead one, and the male visitor  seems to be close to death too. The woman is then revived by shaking her  body. The relatives in the underworld attempt to restore her good health  by administering succulent food. Alas, the food turns into shit, worms,  and seawater. The sago flour rubbed on her forehead becomes as hard as  clay. Under these circumstances, the couple have no choice but to return to  earth, loaded with presents from their dead relatives. On their arrival back  home, Biwiripic orders the villagers to make big fires with the explicit  purpose of producing a lot of smoke. The couple arrive in a cloud of ashes  and stand in the smoke, perspiring heavily. In this way the bad odours of  the dead are purged, so as to prevent illness. The woman Kankani also  initiates wife-swapping. Consequently, Biwiripic and the headman Fayit  exchange wives, as a way of counteracting danger. Ever since, wife-swap- ping has been practised by Asmat in unusual, potentially dangerous situ- ations, such as severe floods, thunderstorms, and encountering unfamiliar  objects, such as gramophones and radios, as well as unfamiliar persons  such as missionaries. This may very well be the first example worldwide  of a case where the coming of missionaries led to wife-swapping.    The Asmat, as well as the Kamoro, ‘steam’ or ‘smoke’ people and their  commodities when they return from a stay in foreign locations, as is the  case when contract workers come home, or when a person returns from  visiting a foreign ship. The Kamoro do not practise wife-swapping. There  are indications that wife-swapping was imported via the Casuarinen coast  from southern coastal Papua.9 Given the Asmat cultural focus on war and  headhunting, it is understandable that wife-swapping bonds are mobi- lized to ward off danger particularly in interlocal political alliances made  for the sake of warfare.10  6. Mobilizing commemoration and revenge. Shakespeare’s ‘The very dogs  bark at me’ is echoed in Asmat a thousand times by all sorts of objects  named after the dead. In the event of killings, these objects, called eco  pok, ‘things that make great’, connote revenge. The very walls, posts, roof  beams, new canoes, houses, spears, shields, paddles, bags, strings of dog’s  teeth, even domestic dogs and pigs or a bundle of firewood cry for com- 9 Compare with Marind Anim otiv-bombari, regulated heterosexual promiscuity in similar  situations of danger; see Knauft 1993:163-7, based on Van Baal 1966. 10 For an example I refer to the grounds for the political power of the warlord of Shuru  Warsekomen, discussed in Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:236-41. </page> <page sequence="17"> XI  Asmat headhunting and the initiation of male adolescents 223 memoration and revenge (Zegwaard 1959:1029). Private and public prop- erty barks at you. These powerful reminders of revenge surround their  addressees night and day. There is a parallel with the Kamoro naming of  walls, posts, and shields as a commemoration of the dead (see Chapter  II, Ema Kame), but the Asmat take it much further and explicitly use it  as a means to mobilize revenge. Anything may serve this purpose. Van  Kessel notes that in Basim the brother of a victim deposited a sago ball in  the men’s house: anyone eating from it would thereby commit himself to  take revenge or punish a theft, as the case may be. Once an old woman  took a bag of parched fruit, no longer fit for consumption, to a man. After  enquiry, it turned out that she had filled the bag recently with fresh fruit  as a reminder of the fact that men of Ocanep had murdered her child.  The fruit was meant to stay there until her child’s death was avenged. The  man to whom she gave the bag managed to change her mind. She then left  the bag with him to prevent the men of Basim from getting ‘hot’, that is,  enraged (Van Kessel 1962:5).  The raid A raid is normally launched shortly before daybreak. The party consists of  three groups, namely the leaders, the seniors of the family; the archers, strong  middle-aged men who have distinguished themselves on former occasions  and who open the attack from a distance; and the spearmen, mainly young  men who are being given the chance to prove themselves and gain renown.  They form a semicircle at the back of the village and attack the frightened  women and children who have fled to the woods. Men may put up a fight,  but sometimes feign flight. The invaders therefore have every reason to strike  quickly, for the fortunes of war can easily turn. After having taken their posi- tions, one of the attackers makes a noise. From the houses some man will call:  ‘Who is that?’ and the reply might for instance be: ‘Your husband, Shuru.’  Panic breaks out. The killing is irrespective of age and gender, unless speci- fied beforehand. A man may keep a captured woman or child. Sometimes, in  case of a shortage of women, abduction of women may be the sole objective  of the raid. A young man who has cornered his victim may exclaim: ‘Fathers,  brothers, the women of our village never took any notice of me. I’ll take this  woman home’, or, ‘I want a dagger’ (as proof of being a headhunter). As soon  as a victim is overpowered, there is a wild outburst of joy (kus yetet); at the  same time, this is a reaction to tense nerves. The victims are seized and gener- ally ill-treated, their heads in particular being subject to torture: ‘My head, my  head won in the raid’. Except when raiders are in a hurry and the victims are  killed on the spot and left there, the victims, dead or alive, are dragged to the  canoes and placed in a sitting position on the bottom, their hands and chests  </page> <page sequence="18"> 224 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua hanging over a pole. They are beheaded by especially skilled men at the con- fluence of rivers or at river bends, places where living spirits are found. It is  imperative to know the names of the victims. These are sometimes found out  by tricks beforehand (Zegwaard 1959:1034-50). On the way home the bamboo  horn is blown. On arrival there is the usual enquiry, as described under the  heading simulation. People jump and howl. The adorned, excited women  cheer and dance and praise the killers (Zegwaard 1959:1022).  Shortly before the raid, and on return, the warriors sing the song of clouds.  This song is said to have first been performed by the ancestors of the Bismam  villages when they rowed from the mountains to the coast. The song begins by  enumerating the large number of insane, deformed, malevolent and aggres- sive anthropomorphic and zoomorphic beings in the upper world: the misers,  the roughnecks, the lizards, the thunder-men, the ant-men, the gnat-men,  the wasp-men, the praying-mantis-men, the worm-men, in short all those  creatures who ‘harm us’ (mira fenaoa, Zegwaard 1959:1034). Zegwaard notes  that there is a striking resemblance to the underworld spirits that embitter the  lives of the Kamoro, against which a ritual war is waged at the end of Kaware,  when the apoko dignitaries thrust their lances into the sands of the beach (see  Chapter III). In various Kamoro narratives malevolent rain, thunder, and  storm beings, and black-cloud men or women in the upper world, function as  the counterparts of the benign heroes of the sun. The enumeration of malevo- lent beings in the song of clouds signifies the risks encountered en route by  the ancestors, and at the present time by their warrior descendants. The song  continues, enumerating scores of trees that grow on buttress roots, grasses and  reeds. It lists the spirits hiding in these places, from where they attack humans,  making them ill and weak. The third part of this cosmological ‘symphony’ rep- resents the turning point: it addresses one by one, separately, the companions,  the ‘brothers’ of man, namely various kinds of parrots, the tree-kangaroo, and  different kinds of squirrels. The headhunters feel a relationship with these  fruit-eating beings (Zegwaard 1959:1034), similar to Kamoro’s concept of ipu  enakoa. The song is a male prerogative: it is repeated many times and is sung  softly, so that the women and children sleeping in the family houses cannot  hear it.  The prelude to the raid and the raid itself in its ritual context clearly dem- onstrate that commemoration and revenge of the dead is an all-out affair  involving all walks of life and the entire cosmos. Headhunting provides  us with a classical example of Marcel Mauss’s total social fact. Small won- der, then, that Asmat art is so graphically anthropocentric. The initiation of  male adolescents represents a momentous aspect of the commemoration and  revenge of the dead. </page> <page sequence="19"> XI  Asmat headhunting and the initiation of male adolescents 225 The initiation The initiation of male adolescents is the third stage in a series of transitions:  from the invisible (nat) to the visible (moro) status of a ‘soft’ vulnerable human  baby; from there to the status of a ‘hard’, less vulnerable, real human being  (kawenak), a transition which takes six or seven years; and from there to  puberty and adolescence.11 It seems warranted to relate the first two stages  to the third one as female to male. The invisible, spiritual status reflects, and  not merely anticipates, the human status. Zegwaard gives details of two cases  that demonstrate my point. One is about a young man from the settlement  of Ayam who had served some years with the police corps in Kaokonao. He  explained to Zegwaard in 1954 why he never ate bananas:  Before I was born as a human baby, I was a spirit-child. I was living with my  spirit-parents in the woods. We were embodied in iguanas. One day they left me  alone in the house. I got hungry and, although I knew that I should not take a  banana from the bunch stored by my mother without her permission, I could not  resist the temptation and ate one. Almost immediately I realized that my mother  would be very angry. I got afraid and looked for a hiding place. I could not find  a safe one. When the sun was already low I panicked, and no longer knew where  I was. I heard voices and walked in the direction where the voices were coming  from. I saw a young woman who was chopping wood. She was not a spirit female  but a human female. I followed her into her house and hid in an attic where she  stored her skirts. After taking a bath in the river, she took the spare skirt in which  I happened to be hiding. To prevent discovery I had no other way but to enter  her womb. [...] My mother, concerned that I had not returned home, followed my  scent-trail to the village of the humans. There she contacted a female medium  and told her that her boy might have entered the womb of a human mother. She  wanted me back. However, the medium took the human side [as they usually do]:  the woman gave birth to a baby after some months. That was me. The medium told  my human parents about the stolen banana: ‘You must keep the boy away from  iguanas and never permit him to eat bananas.’ In the second story, an adult spirit-man who was living under big trees in the  woods ate the sago grubs his wife had stored for a grub ritual. She burst into  a rage and even gave him a public thrashing. Embarrassed, he ran away and  entered the womb of a human female. The medium explained to the human  mother what had happened. Ever since then, her son shared the name of his  spirit counterpart, a name that literally means Red Eyes. This name reflects  his craving for sago grubs. After that he was excused for his passion for sago  grubs.  These stories illustrate that the society of spirits is thought to be equal to  11 For a discussion of these stages, see Zegwaard 1989; see also Zegwaard n.y.f, from which I  have selected my brief description. </page> <page sequence="20"> 226 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua human society, except for its invisibility. It includes both children and adults.  The reason for leaving this society is typical of mythical and human realms:  antisocial behaviour drives them out. The liminal transition from the society  of spirits to human society is guarded by a human, usually a female medium.  Zegwaard specifies ten such mediums residing in Shuru (1954), two of them  males. Most of them are of middle age. There is a connection between them  and specified men’s houses. Each men’s house in Shuru has two or three  mediums. Three out of ten mediums are prominent. They receive messages  exclusively by hearing, not through trance, hence cannot be called shamans in  the current use of the word. Their contact-spirits produce a whistling sound,  almost identical to the sound of the wind, fa atakam, literally wind language.  The spirits come very close to the houses their agents live in. They come at  irregular intervals, mostly on short visits. They recognize their agents by their  body smell. Some spirits speak clearly; others can hardly be understood (this  difference may be one reason for the difference in status of the mediums).  The mediums’ knowledge is exclusive; nobody can check on the truth. Each  medium has his or her own spirits that they listen to. Zegwaard specified the  spirits for each medium in Shuru. The majority of them are spirits of culture  heroes or lords of the land, but one of them was the spirit of a baby which the  medium lost in a miscarriage. The emergence of the spirits entering a woman’s  womb tends to coincide with the first visible signs of pregnancy and the move- ment of the foetus. As soon as the condition of a newly born baby permits, it  is taken to a medium of the men’s house or to any other medium chosen by  the parents. The medium examines the baby very carefully. For instance, in  the first case reported she told the parents that the baby’s skin and fingers  looked remarkably similar to the skin and ‘fingers’ of an iguana. The medium  tells the parents how and why the spirit-child left its own sphere. From her  diagnosis she derives a set of preventive guidelines and taboos. In addition,  she contributes to the child’s health by giving it a spirit name, nat yuwus or  namir yuwus, referring to features and qualities of the culture hero that the  medium communicates with. This name is strictly taboo. It is only divulged  to a small circle of the closest relatives. It is used exclusively in the daytime,  and even then only if it cannot be avoided. At night it is replaced by the name  of the child’s father. It is strictly forbidden to mention the name of the culture  hero to whom the name refers, or his place of origin, in the presence of the  child. If the baby falls ill it is renamed. The spirit name is the most essential  animating element of the body and is for humans only. During the period of  having ‘soft’ bones the child might feel a need to go back to its spirit realm,  hence it is dealt with gently and carefully until its transformation to kawenak,  a really human child. Children are then given a human or real name (kawenak  yuwus), usually associated with a father or grandfather. The male children’s  ‘female’ spirit status decreases over the years, but never ceases to exist. A boy  </page> <page sequence="21"> XI  Asmat headhunting and the initiation of male adolescents 227 only gradually advances to a male status, culminating in his initiation as an  adolescent warrior.  A medium may give information about lost spirit-children, but may also  receive and communicate messages about natural disasters, black magic  practices, or the arrival of foreigners. In these respects a medium, though  formally not having a high status, may yet have considerable informal power.  Undoubtedly, the institution of spirit names highlights the position of the  female gender. However, it operates in a socio-political context in which  men have a big say. It is presumably no coincidence that two wives of  Warsekomen, the powerful warlord of Shuru, were mediums. As Zegwaard  puts it: ‘Sjamanism and group politics are hand in glove’.12  The demarcation of the transition from the spirit world to the human world  by a medium is not, or no longer, known among the Kamoro. There is a remi- niscence of a medium’s ‘wind language’ in the attempt of a male dignitary to  get rid of the hovering scary spirit of a powerful man who was feared while  alive. He is said to whistle while communicating with the spirit (see Chapter  V). I also know of a male seer in West Mimika who was able to foretell the  arrival of a feared pre-war police party by putting a maggot on his body near  his heart, thus communicating with the spirit world. An acceleration of his  heartbeat warned him of trouble. Identifying with the dead: the first stage of male initiation In Chapter III, I described how Kamoro initiates in the course of Kaware iden- tify with the death and resurrection of the culture hero Mamirima (Asmat:  Fumuripic). Asmat initiates do not; instead they identify with a slain enemy  victim of headhunting – a conspicuous difference. Another telling difference  is that for the Kamoro, initiation is the ceremonial duty of bride-receivers,  whereas among the Asmat the initiate’s mother’s brother acts as the initiator.  He immerses the decapitated head earmarked for the initiate in the river –  often after a brawl about suitable candidates that sometimes involves snatch- ing the victim’s body. He then takes the head to the men’s house and pins it  to the floor near the fireplace with a dagger, so that it will dry. He makes a  mat and fills it with magical twigs (eram). The initiate walks out of the men’s  house, the mat under his arms, boards a canoe, places the mat in the bottom,  and acts as if he is returning to the place where the victim comes from. He  then changes his mind and returns to the men’s house after some water has  been poured over his head [thereby identifying with the submerged head  12 Zegwaard 1989, Zegwaard Archives, KDC, File 27:10. </page> <page sequence="22"> 228 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua of the victim]. He sits on the floor assuming the taboo pose of one who is  ashamed: he lowers his head and does not look around. He perseveres in this  pose for several days and takes no notice of the attempts of bystanders to  divert his attention. Like newborn babies, he is subject to food taboos, such  as not eating fish with bones in them. Meanwhile, his mother’s oldest brother  holds the decapitated head in the fire long enough to scorch part of the hair.  In the afternoon or evening following the raid, he smears the ash of the vic- tim’s hair, mixed with the victim’s blood, on the initiate’s head, shoulders and  body. In this way the initiate identifies with the victim. The initiate’s body is  painted with red ochre and his face with black and white stripes. His hair  is lengthened with sago-leaf fibres. A piece of mother-of-pearl hangs on his  forehead, and two tassels of cassowary feathers on the back of his head. A  delicately open-worked pig bone is placed in his septum, and a triton shell on  his abdomen. A crossed band is put across chest and shoulders, as in Mimika;  bracelets woven of finely split rattan adorn his arms, wrists, calves, and  ankles. A dagger is stuck into an armband, and a sago-fibre apron, otherwise  worn only by married women, adorns his hips. A bamboo plate (owam), a sign  of decapitation, dangles on his back.  Meanwhile, the mother’s brother prepares the head. It is roasted and then  kept in a loft during the night. The following morning the nose skin is taken  off and the jaws are removed. The jawbone is thrown outside for anyone  interested in using it as an ornament. The skin is torn off. The flames of a fire  touch the temple and the back. A hole is cut into the head with an axe named  after the victim. The brains are taken out and, mixed with sago, consumed  about midnight, exclusively by the old men. Only the head is taken to the  men’s house. The flesh of the body has been distributed beforehand among  relatives and friends. Even the women and children get their share; the initiate  is absolutely excluded from the cannibalistic meal: he must not eat his alter  ego. The inedible parts, such as eyeballs and genitals, are placed in the initi- ate’s magic mat.  The head, painted and decorated with feathers and beads, is then laid  between the spread legs of the initiate against his groin. He must look at it  continuously. The head remains there for two or three days.  A few days afterwards everyone, dressed up, boards canoes. The initiate  stands sullenly in a canoe, taking on the pose of a worn-out old man leaning  heavily on a club-with-a-disc. His mother’s brother supports him. The canoes,  manned with drumming and singing villagers, move in the direction of the  sea. The ‘old man’ becomes weaker and weaker and finally collapses. Together  with the head, the initiate is immersed in the sea for a while; the victim with  whom he is identified has then descended to the underworld of the dead.  After the initiate has been hauled back from the sea, all his ornaments are  removed and placed in his mat, never to be used again. The head is no longer  </page> <page sequence="23"> XI  Asmat headhunting and the initiation of male adolescents 229 placed near the initiate, marking the end of the identification with the dead.  The ceremony has reached its turning point. The old Adam is gone; his name- sake the initiate is reborn. Initially he acts like a child, does not know how  to handle a paddle and has to learn the name of the river and its tributaries.  His decapitation name (nao yuwus), transferred from the victim he replaces, is  pronounced at every tributary. The ritual recognition of adolescence Back in the village, the initiate is decorated anew in the family house from  head to toe; the bamboo plates covered with the dried nose skin of the victim,  signifying a conquered head (there are three types of plates connoting a dif- ference in ranking), switch from his back to his breast. All present sound a  long drawn-out ‘e-e-e-e-e-h’. Henceforth the initiate acts as a vigorous young  man admired by all. After a few days of rest, the initiate’s mother’s broth- ers, in the presence of the whole community, assist in cutting down a sago  palm and removing the bark. The initiate watches the scene together with  the woman to whom he previously had handed the skull; she acts as a ritual  mother. His mother’s brothers plant a sago-leaf stalk near the middle of the  trunk of the palm. By loosening the outer layer, except at the top and the bot- tom of the stalk, they can bend the middle part in such a way that an oblong  hoop is formed. Then the ritual mother-with-the-skull swings a sago pounder  through the hoop without touching the sago palm. She hands the sago  pounder to her ‘son’, who repeats the act. The onlookers sing ‘Sago pounder,  sago pounder’, followed by a song that was performed on the occasion of the  preparation of the head. This ceremony re-enacts the following narrative told  to Zegwaard (1959:1027-8) on another occasion: Biwiripic [again] goes with  his wife and children to the mouth of the Fait River to pound sago. After fell- ing a palm in full flower, he removes the bark from top to bottom. He orders  his adolescent son to lie prostrate on the bare trunk. The father [or, according  to some versions, the mother] swings a sago pounder and strikes the boy’s  neck. The boy’s head, decorated with hair-lengthenings, lands upside-down  in a tree. The father [or mother] strikes again and again, so that the blood and  flesh of the son’s smashed body entirely mix with the sago pith; the entrails  splash high into the surrounding trees. Now the pith proves to be very easy to  handle. The mother rejoices: ‘Before, the sago was hard to knead and to wring  out; now it is easy.’ [Headhunting even literally permeates the sago.] The  son’s head begins to talk. He teaches his father the songs to be sung on the  way from the raid, at the decapitation festivities, and so on. [Apparently, this  is an alternative version of the myth which institutionalizes headhunting.]  After this ceremony everyone departs for pounding sago. The ritual moth- er and her ‘son’ exchange sago pith. The woman also prepares some sago in  </page> <page sequence="24"> 230 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua the shape of a stick and gives a few pieces to the initiate. Other pieces are put  in the magic mat. The initiate’s mother’s brother then decorates him again.  The following night there is drumming and dancing in the men’s house till  daybreak. In the morning the initiate’s hair is lengthened with curled sago-leaf  fibres. He and the skull are decorated for the final ceremony on the following  night. The skull is suspended in the centre of the men’s house. At night a big  fire is built in front of the house; singers and dancers sit around it in solemn  silence. Then the initiate comes out of the men’s house carrying the magic mat  under his arm and the richly decorated skull. The men carry shields and move  them towards and away from them, while a song is intoned. The dance begins.  The initiate joins the dancing men; from now on, he is accepted by them as an  adult. The songs performed during the preparation of the head and the sago  pounding are repeated again and again. The dance, lasting till dawn, com- pletes the Nao Pokmbu, the headhunting and initiation rituals.  Strikingly, an important part of the initiation of adolescent men aims at  identifying the initiate with the victim of a raid. The great attention paid to the  victim is in keeping with a general tendency, among both Kamoro and Asmat  (a tendency also noticed by Zegwaard) not only to commemorate the dead but  also, even particularly, to placate the dead. This is believed to be vital for the  well-being of the living. It applies all the more to anyone killed in action. There is also a most remarkable strategic side to ritual identification with  the victim: it proves to be very useful in interlocal communication. Zegwaard  (1959:1027) notes that the relatives of the murdered person, whenever they  meet his namesake in the attacking party, will always call him by his assumed  name. They will treat him as a relative, dance and sing for him, and give  him presents. It is strictly forbidden to kill people from other villages who,  because of their ritual names, are related to ego’s village. A namesake (by  virtue of this ritual) is often chosen as a go-between. On his tours Zegwaard  frequently hired such namesakes to be his guides on his visits to tribes hostile  to their community. Killing such people, although it happens occasionally, is  considered a serious breach of convention. This Asmat practice seems to me a  most interesting alternative to a rule practised in many parts of New Guinea,  namely to marry those you wage war with. Asmat interlocal marriages outside  affiliated settlements are rare. These two practices keep interlocal rivalries in  check and promote interlocal trade and travel. Finally, initiation of adolescent men is not the main significance of head- hunting, although it may contribute to it. It is merely one aspect of headhunt- ing, which functions as a ‘totalizer’ of Asmat society and culture. </page> </plain_text>
