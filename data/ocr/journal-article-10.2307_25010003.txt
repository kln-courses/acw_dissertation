Soc. 10l(1):1-83, 1993 A PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS AND RECLASSIFICATION OF THE GENERA OF THE POCOCERA COMPLEX (LEPIDOPTERA: PYRALIDAE: EPIPASCHIINAE) M. ALMA SOLIS Department of Entomology, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20740 Current address: Systematic Entomology Laboratory, USDA, % National Museum of Natural History, NHB 168, Washington, D.C. 20560 Abstract. -Based on a worldwide survey of representatives of epipaschiine genera, a mono phyletic subset is identified and designated the Pococera complex. Its monophyly is defended by a prominent saccus in the male genitalia and a long, narrow ductus bursae in the female genitalia. The complex contains approximately 300 species that are restricted in distribution to the Westem Hemisphere. This phylogenetic study of the complex establishes its monophyly, re-examines the genera included, establishes their monophyly, and estimates their relationships. The cladistic analysis is based on 22 taxa and 65 characters of the adult head, genitalia, and wings. Lacalma Janse and Macalla Walker are used as outgroups. The PHYSYS program generated three equally parsimonious trees with a length of 144 and consistency index 0.52. The stability of the estimated trees were tested with successive weighting and sequential removal of taxa. The tests showed the position of the root to be somewhat uncertain. Nevertheless, the topology of the estimated trees is shown to be stable in most manipulations despite the fact that most of the groupings are supported by very few characters. A taxonomic synopsis presents the results of the examination and the definition of the genera as monophyletic. Twenty-two genera of the Pococera complex are diagnosed and six new genera are described. Representatives of each genus are illustrated by line drawings and photographs. Larval host use patterns are briefly reviewed. A nomenclatural summary is provided, including taxa to be removed from the Epipaschiinae. The Epipaschiinae are one of five subfamilies currently placed in the Pyralidae (Solis and Mitter, 1992). The monophyly of the Pyraloidea and the Pyralidae are well supported in the literature (Solis and Mitter, 1992) and is not in dispute. The monophyly of the Epipaschiinae was established and discussed previously (Solis and Mitter, 1992), but relationships within this subfamily are not well understood. The Epipaschiinae historically include approximately five hundred species that are pri marily pan-tropical in distribution. They occur from the northern periphery of Aus tralia north into the Oriental Region, including temperate China, and to the southern limits of the Palearctic. They also are found south of the Sahara to South Africa and in the Western Hemisphere from the eastern temperate forests to northern Argentina. Information is limited on the life history and immature stages of the Epipaschiinae. The morphology of the immatures is not well known (Allyson, 1977; Passoa, 1985). The larvae are known to be leafrollers, leaf tiers, and leafminers. Some species are believed to be host specific, for example, Epipaschia superatalis Clemens on poison ivy. Other species, such as Phidotricha erigens Ragonot, have been reared on a wide variety of hosts, including loquat, tamarind, lima beans, sorghum, and corn. As</page><page sequence="2">2 JOURNAL OF THE NEW YORK ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY Vol. 10 1(1) illustrated by hosts of P. erigens, some species in the tropics are economically im portant. The Epipaschiinae have been the subject of very few comprehensive morphological, and no modern phylogenetic, studies. Hampson (1896) was the first to study the genera on a worldwide basis; he used wing venation and external characters of the head. Janse (1931) conducted a survey of the genera and was the first to use male genitalia and secondary sexual characters of the head after removing the scales. He often investigated only one specimen of one species, the type species, or a species he had access to, and at times depended on opinions about type species by other tax onomists. He delineated genera based on male characters of the genitalia, head, and wings. The lack of modern, comprehensive studies in the Epipaschiinae is evident in a list of species (see Nomenclatural Summary) which, during the course of this study, were found to belong in other subfamilies. To delineate major monophyletic groups, a survey of the major genera of the Epipaschiinae was conducted. First, the exact size and content of the Epipaschiinae on a worldwide basis were determined by developing lists of genera and species for the Western Hemisphere and for those found elsewhere. Fletcher and Nye (1984) listed fifty-four genera and I found 385 species outside the Western Hemisphere (Solis, in press). In the Western Hemisphere fifty-eight genera were listed by Fletcher and Nye (1984) and I found 370 species. Second, representative specimens of genera were dissected and studied. From the Western Hemisphere a male and female specimen of the type species of forty-five genera were dissected. Other species examined in each genus are listed in the generic synopsis. Outside the Western Hemisphere almost all type species were seen and at least one male and one female of each type species of twelve major genera were dissected. In the larger genera examples of more than one species was dissected, and some species were dissected whose generic affinity was not known. The most clearly evident monophyletic group identified by this survey was a large set of genera that is found only in the Western Hemisphere and is here termed the Pococera complex. This is not to be confused with Pococerinae, a synonym of the Epipaschiinae. This complex comprises forty-seven generic names and approximately three hundred specific names. The complex includes several large and economically important genera such as Pococera Zeller and Phidotricha Ragonot. The complex is named after Pococera because the genus is the largest occurring in North America and is commonly associated with the subfamily name by lepidopterists. This study is a generic re-classification and phylogenetic analysis of the Pococera complex based on a morphological study of the adults, and it will serve as a starting point for a larger study on the relationships within the subfamily. The goals of this study were to confirm or disprove the monophyly of the Pococera complex and of the included genera. It also estimated the relationships among the genera and provided a generic synopsis and description of the new genera of the complex.

Most of the type material is located in The Natural History Museum, the National Museum of Natural History, and the Carnegie Museum. When the only known specimen of the species was the holotype, or when material was not available, a photograph of the type was used. After the Pococera complex was provisionally identified, 47 genera and 349 species were hypothesized to belong to the complex. The type species of each genus was dissected, and at least one male and female of approximately 82% of the species in Pococera complex were dissected. This figure does not represent species designated as junior synonyms and species in the checklist based on photographs of the types. Species were studied by dissection, or were included in the genus based on a photograph. Most of this study was carried out using a Wild M5 stereoscopic dissecting mi croscope, but preliminary/exploratory morphological studies were carried out with a compound light microscope and a scanning electron microscope. Line drawings of representatives of each genus are provided because most of the taxa have never been illustrated. The drawings were executed using a Wild M5 stereoscopic dissecting microscope with a camera lucida attachment. Head, legs, wings, abdomen, and genitalia of adults were dissected for this study. Heads were cleared in KOH, dissected in water, and temporarily stored in 75% alcohol. They were mounted in balsam on concavity slides, frontal side up. Wings were bleached, stained with eosin-Y and mounted in balsam. Genitalia were cleared with cold KOH and dissected in water. They were stained with chlorazol black and stored in glycerin until ready to be mounted in balsam. The genitalia were mounted on slides ventral side up. The aedeagus is small, so no attempt was made to inflate the vesica. Terminology applied to the head (Fig. 3) and to wing veins and markings (Fig. 5) corresponds to Forbes (1923) and Wootton (1979), respectively. Terminology applied to the genitalia follows Klots (1956) and to the tympanic organs follows Maes (1985) (Figs. 1, 2, 4). To determine the relationships of the genera of the Pococera complex a cladistic analysis was performed. The analysis was executed with the PHYSYS software pack</page><page sequence="4">4 JOURNAL OF THE NEW YORK ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY Vol. 101(1) C &gt; uncus anGus Xtegumen gnathos valvsa tegumen scierite ( l juxtal arm juxta ( saccus proximal end of aedeagus 2 scape extension pedicel |/ / antennal segment // eye second segment of labial palpus 3 pilifer I \ third segment of maxillary palpus proboscis Figs. 1-5.

Farris (1984). The characters were coded alphanumerically and read with the CREAD option. A description of each character and its hypothesized transformation series is discussed in the morphology section. The DWAG.S command (with the tree buffer set to 10, the default) was used to perform a Wagner ground-plan analysis (Farris, 1970; Mickevich and Farris, 1984) that estimates relationships among taxa based on the Wagner parsimony criterion (Farris, 1983). The program uses both local and global branch-swapping. Branch swapping searches for the most parsimonious tree by iteratively rearranging branches on an estimated tree and re-optimizing ancestral character states. Local branch swapping rearranges terminal taxa and global branch-swapping rearranges subter minal groups. The DIAG.C command in PHYSYS calculated the consistency indices, a measure of homoplasy (Farris, 1969), for each character and tree. MORPHOLOGY The character numbers in the following discussion correspond to the character matrix in Table 1 and to the Summary of Characters and States. Head. The eyes do not vary in shape or size. An ocellus, with an associated chaetosema, is always present. However, ocelli are absent in other taxa of the Py ralidae, such as the Galleriinae and occasionally the Phycitinae. The antennae are sexually dimorphic. The antennal segments are simple in the female, but vary from laminate to serrate to bipectinate in the male. The length of the pectinations varies within genera. The antennal setae in the female always are shorter than the length of any one antennal segment. In the male, the setae vary in length along the antenna. The setae are longest near the base and on the ventral side and decrease in length toward the apex. The longest setae are usually two segments long and free, but in Phidotricha Ragonot they are longer than two segments and appressed to the ventral side of the antennal shaft (Fig. 43; Character 1). The pedicel is only slightly longer than the adjacent antennal segment. The scape of the female antenna is simple, not medially elongated at the base of the pedicel. The plesiomor phic condition in the male is a medial elongation of the scape that is longer than the base of the pedicel. This modification of the male scape is absent in ten genera (Fig. 31; Character 2). The length of the modification at the base of the scape and its possession of specialized setae varies within genera. The medial modification of the scape of Milgithea Schaus has secondary, fingerlike protrusions (Fig. 40; Character 3). The frons is usually not sculptured, but Mazdacis Solis, new genus, has a lobe below the antenna extending medially to the base of the clypeus (Fig. 101; Charac ter 4). A proboscis is always present and fully developed, except in Roeseliodes Warren where it is reduced in length to about half the length of the fully developed proboscis found in the remaining Epipaschiinae (Character 5). The pilifers vary in length within genera. A median clypeal lobe is present in all genera except Roeseliodes (Fig. 51; Character 6). The labial palpus is always upturned, never porrect. The second segment of the labial palpus in the male varies in shape. Typically it is simple with no modifications (Fig. 31; Character 7), as in the female, but several modifications, interpreted as independent, occur. The genera Quadraforma Solis, new genus, Mazdacis, Pococera Zeller, Tancoa Schaus, and Dasyvesica Solis have a tubulate second segment of labial</page><page sequence="7">Table 1.

The second segment in Pandoflabella Solis, new genus is flabellate, that is, it expands to a narrow fanlike shape when water is flushed through the segment (Fig. 76). In Macalla Walker the distal portion of the second segment is broadened and bears a circular patch of non-deciduous setae. The position of the organ of vom Rath varies within some genera. The third segment of the labial palpus varies in length within genera. The maxillary palpi have three segments, although studies by Hulst (1889) had suggested four segments. Scanning electron photographs of the same species studied by Hulst were examined. The disagreement results from a medial collapse of the first segment. Four and five segments are found in the more primitive groups of Lepi doptera. The base of the first segment of the maxillary palpus is typically sclerotized, but in Mediavia Solis, new genus, and Deuterollyta Lederer it is membranous and pleated (Fig. 36; Character 9). The second segment bears a proximal lobe or extension in Anarnatula Dyar (Fig. 9; Character 11). The place of attachment of the third segment of the maxillary palpus on the second in the male varies among genera (Character 10). The third segment adjoins the apex of the second segment (Fig. 54), the typical lepidopteran condition, in Roeseliodes, Cecidipta Berg, Tallula Hulst, Phidotricha, Carthara Walker, Oneida Hulst, Anarnatula, Accinctapubes Solis, new genus, and Bibasilaris Solis, new genus. In Chloropaschia Hampson, the third segment adjoins the second segment slightly below its apex (Fig. 31), and in Mazdacis and Tancoa it arises from the midpoint of the second segment (Fig. 58). In the remaining genera, including the outgroups Macalla and Lacalma Janse, the third segment is attached at the base of the second segment (Fig. 64). The insertion of the third segment on the second is hypothesized to transform gradually from the apical to basal position. In Anarnatula the midpoint of the segment of the maxillary palpus is twice as wide as the base (Fig. 9; Character 8). Thorax. The legs are simple with no variation in tarsal spines. The number of hind tibial spurs varies in number in some genera. The epipaschiine wing-locking device provides several characters. The frenulum consists of one bristle in the male and two bristles in the female. The bristles are tapered in all genera except Accinctapubes, in which they are bulbous apically in the male (Fig. 89; Character 12). There are two structures in the forewing that function to hold the frenulum, a retinaculum and a frenulum hook, both of which occur in other Pyralidae. A retinaculum, a group of small, hooked setae at the base of the wing below the Cu vein, is always present in males and females of the Epipaschiinae. In addition the frenulum hook, an extension of the Sc vein originating at the base of the wing and extending to the discocellular cell (Fig. 35; Character 13), occurs in eight genera. Color and pattern on the wing were not used for the phylogenetic analysis because of their variability (see Solis, 199 1). Many Epipaschiinae have green-tinted wings in life, but this color fades to brown or dull-yellow after they are dry. Patterns vary within some genera. The forewing of most males in Pococera, except gibella Zeller and tertiella Dyar, has a costal fold with a specialized tuft of scales (Fig. 127; Character 14). This feature occurs sporadically in the Phycitinae and other families in the Lepidoptera. Wing venation has been used widely in Lepidoptera taxonomy. Fusion of wing</page><page sequence="9">1993 POCOCERA COMPLEX 9 veins is usually considered to be derived and a full complement of veins is considered to be plesiomorphic. In the epipaschiine forewing, R, and R2 may be separate or completely fused (Character 15). R2 usually arises proximal to the discocellular cell (Character 16), but in Mediavia Solis, new genus it arises distal to the discocellular cell (Fig. 92). In Macalla and Roeseliodes R3 and R4 are fused (Fig. 50; Character 17). R5 and M, are always present with M, forming the anterior outer corner of the discocellular cell. In the plesiomorphic condition, the cell is more than half as long as the forewing, but in Mazdacis and Pococera it is less than half the length of the forewing (Fig. 69; Character 18). M3 and Cu1 are fused at the base in Lacalma (Fig. 113; Character 19). In most genera CuA1 and M3 are parallel to each other, but in Tallula CuA, arches toward M3 (Fig. 55; Character 20). The CuP vein is primitively absent in the Epipaschiinae, but re-appears in Lacalma, Roeseliodes, Cecidipta, Chlo ropaschia, Quadraforma, Deuterollyta, and Accinctapubes (Fig. 35; Character 21). 2A is coincident with 1A in most epipaschiines, but 3A is lost in several genera (Fig. 69; Character 22). In the hindwing, Sc+R, and Rs may be fused at one point or separate (Fig. 35; Character 23). Sc+R, may be convexly curved, a synapomorphy of Carthara (Fig. 17; Character 24). Rs extends to less than half the length of the discocellular cell in most genera, but it extends farther in Carthara, Tallula, and Cacozelia Grote (Fig. 17; Character 25). For most epipaschiines M2 and M3 are separate, but fusion of M2 and M3 occurs in Roeseliodes (Fig. 50; Character 26). The amount of fusion at the base of M2 and M3 varies within the remaining genera. CuA, and CuA2 are separate at the base. The loss of CuA2 is a synapomorphy for Roeseliodes (Fig. 50; Character 27). IA, 2A, and 3A are present in the hindwing. Abdomen. The first eight segments that form the abdomen are simple, without any distinguishing characteristics, except for the unique sclerotized pattern on segment eight of Chloropaschia (Fig. 28) and Tancoa (Fig. 53; Character 28). The epipaschiine tympanic organs occur on the first sternum and are described and well illustrated by Minet (1983, 1985). Secondary venulae are never present in the Pococera complex or the entire subfamily, the Epipaschiinae (Solis and Mitter, 1992). No morphological variation was detected at the generic or specific level in the Pococera complex. Male genitalia. In the epipaschiines, the tegumen articulates ventrocephalad to the vinculum, valva, and gnathos and with the uncus dorsoposteriad. The tegumen is primarily membranous and abuts only a small portion of the base of the uncus. Anteriorly, the tegumen is sclerotized at points of articulation. A synapomorphy of the Epipaschiinae is a separate "sclerite" formed by the section of the tegumen that articulates with the gnathos, which is highly sclerotized and separated by membrane from the dorsal part of the tegumen (Character 29). The term "sclerite," as used here, is not a sclerite according to Torre-Bueno (1989), because it is not part of the body wall, but it is a section of the tegumen separated by membrane. This separate sclerite does not occur in the remaining subfamilies of Pyralidae. Its distribution in the Crambidae is uncertain since this structure is usually visible only on unmounted specimens, but representatives studied did not have the sclerite. The tegumen sclerite varies in shape and length. It does not usually reach a midventral position, but in Oneida and Dasyvesica it does reach a midventral position (fig. 9 in Solis, 1991), and in Cecidipta it extends beyond the midventral position (Fig. 22; Character 30). The tip of the tegumen sclerite is usually pointed, that is, less broad than the base,</page><page sequence="10">10 JOURNAL OF THE NEW YORK ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY Vol. 10 1(1) but in Quadraforma, Phidotricha, and Pococera the tip is as broad as the base (Fig. 65), and the tip is broader than the base (Fig. 22) in Mazdacis and Cecidipta (Character 31). A synapomorphy for Tancoa is a dorso-anterior extension of the tegumen (Fig. 59; Character 32). One of the apomorphies for the Pococera complex is the presence of a saccus that is elongate, bulbous and curved up toward the anterior end of the aedeagus (Fig. 91; Character 33). The entire vinculum curves up toward the base of the aedeagus in all other epipaschiines and some other pyralids, but it does not form an evagination or saccus. The uncus is well developed, almost as long as the vinculum in epipaschiines and is reduced only in Roeseliodes (Fig. 48; Character 34). The uncus has arms that are elongate ventro-anteriorly and articulate with the base of the gnathos. In some genera, the uncus has a sclerotized structure at the base (Character 35). The basal scleroti zation when present is U-shaped (Fig. 19), except that in Tallula and Phidotricha it is triangular (Fig. 36; Character 63). Caudally, the uncus usually has many setae, at times extending to the middle of the uncus, but in several genera, there is only a single, distal row of setae (Fig. 65; Character 37). The width of the uncus is usually uniform, but in several genera the caudal end is wider than the width at the midpoint (Fig. 65; Character 38). Only Tancoa has structures that could be termed socii (Klots, 1956), arising medially from the uncus (Fig. 59; Character 39). In the epipaschiines, the base of the gnathos articulates posteriorly with the arms of the uncus and anteriorly with the tegumen. The arms of the gnathos are always fused at the apex, and most genera have a small curve just before the apical hook. The derived condition is the absence of this curve (Fig. 28; Character 40) and occurs in Chloropaschia. The valvae are usually simple; however, most genera possess a median basal lobe (Fig. 87; Character 41) that is secondarily lost in Roeseliodes, Tallula, Phidotricha, Mediavia, and Tancoa. The lobe is usually a short, round nub, but in Quadraforma it is at least twice as long as the short condition, and square (Fig. 96; Character 42). A lobe adjacent to the costa occurs in Mediavia and Mazdacis (Fig. 91; Character 43). In Mazdacis, the lobe extends midventrally only to the end of the costa, but in Mediavia it extends beyond the costa and adjoins the juxta (Fig. 91; Character 44). In Chloropaschia, the valva is covered with non-deciduous rows of thin setae (Fig. 28; Character 45). Dasyvesica has a patch of deciduous, thick setae on the sacculus (fig. 19 in Solis, 1991; Character 46). Tancoa has a membranous extension, covered with setae, from the apex of the valva (Fig. 59; Character 47) that does not occur elsewhere in the epipaschiines. Lacalma has an expanded vinculum with coremata (Fig. I1 1; Character 48). This condition does not appear to be present in any other epipaschiine. In most epipaschiines the anterior end of the aedeagus, the coecum, is usually elongate and curved (Fig. 13; Character 49). A synapomorphy for Bibasilaris is a bilobed coecum (Fig. 84; Character 50). But in Roeseliodes (Fig. 49) and Tancoa (Fig. 60) the anterior end is short, or the coecum is absent, and the ductus ejaculatorius is found at a terminal, anterior position on the aedeagus. In the Pococera complex cornuti occur only in Dasyvesica (fig. 19 in Solis, 1991; Character 51) although they do occur in other genera, such as Macalla, outside the Pococera complex. A transtilla is not present in the Epipaschiinae. The juxta in the epipaschiines</page><page sequence="11">1993 POCOCERA COMPLEX 11 consists typically of a base with arms extending laterally and caudad around the aedeagus, but in Macalla the juxta is almost completely bifurcate and its arms are ventrad and caudad of the aedeagus (Fig. 107; Character 52). In most genera the arms are longer than the base of the juxta, but in Oneida and Dasyvesica the arms are as long as the base of the juxta (fig. 9 in Solis, 1991; Character 53). Lacalma, Roeseliodes, and Cecidipta lack arms and the juxta is entire (Fig. 22). If arms are present, they can be shorter distally than the costa of the valva (fig. 9 in Solis, 1991), or extend beyond a point perpendicular to the base of the valva (Fig. 28; Character 54). The base of the juxta may be more heavily sclerotized than the arms (fig. 19 in Solis, 1991; Character 55) as in Dasyvesica. The juxta can have one medial lobe or two lateral lobes anterior to the aedeagus. The base of the juxta may have a lobe that is long and pointed, extending caudally (Fig. 65), as in Phidotricha, Pococera, Milgithea, Accinctapubes, Bibasilaris, Anartula and Toripalpus, or that is small and round (Fig. 28) as in the remaining genera, except Dasyvesica and Oneida which lack a medial lobe. In Dasyvesica the base of the juxta is flat (fig. 19 in Solis, 1991), but an apomorphy for Oneida is a slight curve caudally of the base of the juxta (fig. 9 in Solis, 1991; Character 56). If lateral lobes are present, the lobes have round apices (Fig. 22) in Cecidipta and pointed apices in Roeseliodes (Fig. 48; Character 59). Female genitalia. The ovipositor lobes are membranous with many, usually un modified setae. However, Accinctapubes bears unique setae on the ovipositor lobes that are spatulate and distally trifurcate (Fig. 85; Character 58). The distal margin of the lamella antevaginalis is typically membranous, but in Macalla it is sclerotized (Fig. 105; Character 59). A ventral membranous fold as sociated with the lamella antevaginalis may occur in some genera, and it may be weakly or strongly bilobed (Figs. 26, 32; Character 60). The lamella postvaginalis is typically membranous in epipaschiines, but in Roeseliodes it is sclerotized (Fig. 47; Character 6 1). In the Epipaschiinae, the ductus seminalis originates from the ductus bursae near the ostium bursae. In the Pococera complex the ductus bursae is always less than half as wide as the posterior edge of the seventh segment, in contrast to a ductus that is at least half as wide as the posterior end of the seventh segment in Macalla and Lacalma (Figs. 105, 110; Character 62). The ductus bursae has no constrictions before the corpus bursae in the Pococera complex, but it has a constriction in Lacalma and Macalla (Figs. 105, 110; Character 63). The corpus bursae is membranous and comprised of only one sac in the Pococera complex, but Macalla shows a derived accessory bursa (Fig. 105; Character 64). Most genera in the Pococera complex and Lacalma have a signum composed of two, separated, elongate-conical, spinelike projections on the inner surface of the bursa (Fig. 68). These are lost in Toripalpus (Fig. 70) and Tallula. Macalla has a signum composed of two flat, scobinate patches (Fig. 105; Character 65).

Carthara Walker (p. 19) TAXONOMIC SYNOPSIS Anarnatula Dyar, 1918 Figs. 6-10, 115 Anarnatula Dyar, 1918:371. Diagnosis. Anarnatula is diagnosed by two autapomorphies on the male head (Fig. 9), a proximal lobe on the second segment of the maxillary palpus, and the third segment of the maxillary palpus with the midpoint twice as wide as the base. The presence of a frenulum hook (Fig. 10) also diagnoses this genus, but one also occurs in Mazdacis, Deuterollyta, Bibasilaris, Accinctapubes, Milgithea, Toripalpus, and the outgroup Macalla. Identification synopsis. Anarnatula can be identified by the forewing pattern (Fig. 1 5) with a white postmedial line curving to the base of the wing at M2 and white scales present from the base of the wing to the postmedial line in the discal cell and between Ml and M2. The hindwing has orange scales. Anarnatula is the sister group to the Phidotricha-Tallula clade. They share the lack of an elongated scape which is also lacking in other genera. Species in all three genera are small, approximately 7 mm in wing length, in comparison to other epipaschiinaes. Externally this genus can be differentiated from all other genera by the orange scales</page><page sequence="16">16 JOURNAL OF THE NEW YORK ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY Vol. 10 1(1) Fig. 61. Aratl sp. 6.

The two species in the genus (see Nomenclatural Summary) can be distinguished by the shape of the valva in the male, size of the signa, and wing color and pattern. Cacozelia Grote, 1877 Figs. 11-15, 116 Cacozelia Grote, 1877:263-264. Diagnosis. Cacozelia is diagnosed by a unique combination of two homoplasies. 1) The Rs of the hindwing (Fig. 15) is more than half the length of the discocellular cell, which also occurs in Carthara and Tallula. 2) In the male genitalia (Fig. 12) a sclerotized structure at the base of the uncus is lacking and is a parallelism in Roe seliodes, Cecidipta, Oneida, Dasyvesica, and Toripalpus. The sclerotized structure is also lacking in the outgroups, Macalla and Lacalma. Identification synopsis. Cacozelia can be identified by a reniform spot extended to the costa on the forewing (Fig. 116). Cacozelia can be confused externally with Toripalpus. The species are about the same size, but Toripalpus lacks the extended reniform spot. Although Toripalpus and Cacozelia share a homoplasious character, the lack of the sclerotized structure at the base ofthe uncus, there are various other differences. Cacozelia lacks a frenulum hook, but Toripalpus has a frenulum hook. Cacozelia has Sc+R, and Rs of the hindwing completely separate, but these veins are fused at one point in Toripa/pus. The Rs of the hindwing in Cacozelia is more than half the length of the discocellular cell, but is less than half the length in Toripalpus. The base of the juxta is present in both genera, but is small and round in Cacozelia and long and pointed in Toripalpus. In the female, Toripalpus lacks the ventral fold in the lamella antevaginalis, but in Cacozelia the ventral fold is present and equal in width or weakly bilobed. Cacozelia has a signum that is spinelike and scobinate, but in Toripalpus the signum is absent. Type species. Cacozelia basiochrealis Grote, 1877, ibid. 19 (I):264, by monotypy. Type locality.

Cacozelia was placed in synonymy with Stericta by Hampson (1896), but Janse (1931) could not understand Hampson's reason, and instead placed Ca cozelia under Jocara. Janse also stated that he did not have access to the type species of Jocara and used trabalis Grote since it appeared to be similar. Originally, and in this work, trabalis was placed in Toripalpus. After re-definition of this genus addi tional species were included from a variety of other genera. Cacozelia has four described species (see Nomenclatural Summary) distinguished by scale color and pattern. Males of the species differ in the shape of the extensi6n of the scape, the length and shape of the third segment of the labial palpus, and the second and third segments of the maxillary palpus.

Carthara is diagnosed by an autapomorphy, Sc+R, of the hindwing curves toward the costa prior to the point where M, splits off R (Fig. 17), and a homoplasious character, Rs of the hindwing is more than half the length of the discocellular cell, which also occurs in Cacozelia and Tallula. Identification synopsis. Carthara can be identified (Fig. 117) by the white costa of the forewing, and the postmedial line curving to the outer margin above Cu2 and below Cu2 curving toward the base of the wing. Externally, Carthara can be distinguished from other genera by the prominent white costa of the forewing. Carthara is most similar to Bibasilaris. See Bibasilaris for a comparison of the two genera.

Although Hampson (1896) and Janse (1931) overlooked Carthara al bicosta Walker, Carthara is the senior synonym. Hampson placed Leptosphetta and Pycnulia in Stericta. Hampson synonymized ministra and rabdina under scopipes. Janse (1931) placed albicosta and scopipes in Leptosphetta and outlined reasons for removing the two species from Stericta. He found the species to be distinct from Stericta divitalis (Guenee), the type species of Stericta, and provided a description for Leptosphetta. Janse pointed out that Leptosphetta Butler was originally placed in the Notodontidae and stated that he believed the genus to be confined to America.

Cecidipta Berg, 1877 Figs. 21-25, 118 Cecidipta Berg, 1877:236-238. Acecidipta Amsel, 1956:60. NEW SYNONYMY. Diagnosis. Cecidipta is diagnosed by an autapomorphy, a tegumen sclerite (Fig. 22) that is extended beyond the midventral line. It is also distinguished by a unique combination of the following three homoplasies: the tip of the tegumen sclerite as broad as the base, which also occurs in Mazdacis; an uncus with the caudal end wider than the midpoint, also occurring in Pococera, Mediavia, Bibasilaris, and Lacalma; and a single row of setae on the caudal end of the uncus, as in Tallula, Phidotricha, and Pococera. Identification synopsis. The adults of Cecidipta are the largest in the Epipaschiinae, some females reaching 5 cm in wingspan. Average forewing length is 1.5 cm in males and 2.0 cm in females. The genus can be identified by the forewing pattern (Fig. 1 8) with a white apical area beyond the postmedial line, the reniform spot a thin black line from R to CuA, and large black spots on the adterminal line. Cecidipta is most similar to its sister group Roeseliodes, but specimens of Cecidipta are larger than those of Roeseliodes. Forewings of Roeseliodes are usually 11 mm or less in length, and the basal color is gray. Cecidipta wing length is usually around 15 mm and the basal color is beige or white. The forewing of Roeseliodes lacks a white apical area, a reniform spot in most species, and large, black spots on the adterminal line, all of which are present in Cecidipta. In Roeseliodes the tip of the tegumen sclerite is narrower than the base, but as broad in Cecidipta. Cecidipta has an uncus that is wider at the caudal end than at the midpoint and a single row of setae on the caudal end. The caudal end of the uncus of Roeseliodes is less or as wide as the midpoint and lacks a single row of setae on the caudal end. Type species.

Type species: A. major Amsel, by original designation. Species examined. cecidiptoides (Schaus), excoecariae Berg, teffealis (Schaus). Distribution. Southwestern Mexico to Argentina, with one Caribbean record from Trinidad. Biology. Berg (1877) and Bourquin (1945) described and illustrated the biology of excoecariae in Argentina. Berg reported that the eggs were laid in dipteran-induced galls and Bourquin reported that they were laid in cracks of the stems. According to Bourquin, the larva feeds on the foliage, but lives, eats and then pupates within stems of Sapium haematospermum Mueller (Euphorbiaceae). But Berg pointed out that while this method of concealment was the most common, the larva also constructs silk tubes from the galls or seeks out tubes of spiders or pupal cases of other larvae, and if these methods fail, it will web leaves together. Two specimens of Cecidipta sp. from Guyana reared on Ficus sp. ("Golden Fleece") (Moraceae) are in the USNM. Remarks. Cecidipta has always been considered as distinct, but Janse (1931) dis cussed the inaccuracies associated with Hampson's (1896) description, particularly</page><page sequence="22">22 JOURNAL OF THE NEW YORK ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY Vol. 10 1(1) *.. ..,3A? , ,! .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ V ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Figs. 2 1-25.

Janse provided an in-depth description of Cecidipta. I synonymized Acecidipta based on a photograph of the adult and genitalia by Amsel. More species were included from a variety of other genera. Cecidipta has four described species (see Nomenclatural Summary). They are dis tinguished in the male genitalia by the width of the uncus at the apex and base, and the length of the midventral extension from the tegumen sclerite. Males also differ in the shape of the extension from the scape and the length of pectinations on the antennomeres. In females, species differences may be found in the length and width of the ductus bursae and corpus bursae, and in the dimensions of the signa. Chloropaschia Hampson, 1906 Figs. 26-31, 119 Chloropaschia Hampson, 1906:14 1. Diagnosis. Chloropaschia is diagnosed by two autapomorphies in the male geni talia, a valva expanded posteriorly with non-deciduous hairlike setae and a gnathos without a curve before the apical hook (Fig. 28). It is also distinguished by a com bination of homoplasious characters of the head, wings and male genitalia. On the abdomen, the eighth sternum has a sclerotized pattern (Fig. 30), as in Tancoa. The male head (Fig. 31) has a simple second segment of the labial palpus, with no modifications, a condition which also occurs in Bibasilaris, Oneida, Tallula, Roe seliodes, Cecidipta, Deuterollyta, Accinctapubes, Anarnatula, Cacozelia, and Tori palpus. The third segment of the maxillary palpus arises at the apex of the second segment, and this condition also occurs in Roeseliodes, Cecidipta, Tallula, Phidotri cha, Carthara, Oneida, Accinctapubes, Bibasilaris, and Anarnatula. Sc+R1 and Rs of the hindwing are fused (Fig. 27), as in Pandoflabella, Tallula, Phidotricha, Pococera, Milgithea, Tancoa, Oneida, Dasyvesica, Deuterollyta, Bibasilaris, Anarnatula, To ripalpus, and Lacalma. Identification synopsis. Chloropaschia can be identified by a forewing pattern (Fig. 1 9) with the reniform spot reduced to a small dark line and the medial line curved basally posterior to the reniform spot. Chloropaschia is most similar to its sister group, Quadraforma, but can also be confused with species of Pandoflabella. See Quadraforma for a comparison of the two genera. Type species.

Dasyvesica Solis, 1991 Fig. 135 Dasyvesica Solis, 1991:821-825. Diagnosis. Dasyvesica is diagnosed by two autapomorphies in the male genitalia (fig. 19 in Solis, 1991), a patch of thick, deciduous setae on the sacculus, and the base of the juxta more heavily sclerotized than the arms. Other homoplasious syn apomorphies are a tubular second segment of the labial palpus, as in Mazdacis, Quadraforma, Cacozelia, Tancoa, Pococera, Milgithea and Lacalma, a third segment of the maxillary palpus arising from the base of the second segment, as in Quadra forma, Pandoflabella, Pococera, Milgithea, Mediavia, Cacozelia, Toripalpus, Lacal ma and Macalla, and cornuti present, as in the outgroup Macalla. Identification synopsis. Dasyvesica can be identified by a forewing pattern (Fig. 135) with the postmedial line concave from Ml to CuA, and then concave again to CuA2 and the posterior margin of the wing. The reniform spot has darker scales distally. The median line is present from M2 to 1A + 2A. The sister group of Dasyvesica is Oneida. See Oneida for a comparison of the two genera. Type species. Pococera nepomuca Schaus, 1925, Ann. Carn. Mus. 16:16. Type locality. Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia (CNP). Species examined. nepomuca (Schaus), lophotalis (Hampson), crinitalis (Schaus). Distribution. Venezuela and Bolivia to Quintana Roo in Mexico and to Jamaica in the Caribbean. Biology. No information available. Remarks. The three species in Dasyvesica were previously placed in Jocara and Pococera. Dasyvesica was recently described (Solis, 1991) with three included species (see Nomenclatural Summary), and specimens of least two new species from South Amer ica are in the USNM. Species are distinguished by wing color and pattern, the area in the sacculus that is covered by setae, and the length of the extension of the scape. Etymology. This generic name is derived from the Greek dasys meaning "thick with hair" and the Latin vesica (feminine) meaning "bladder" in reference to the cornuti on the vesica.

Deuterollyta is diagnosed by a unique combination of three homopla sious wing characters; CuP present in the forewing, also occurring in Roeseliodes, Cecidipta, Chloropaschia, Quadraforma, Bibasilaris, and Lacalma; frenulum hook present, as in Mazdacis, Milgithea, Accinctapubes, Bibasilaris, Toripalpus and Ma calla; and Sc+R, and Rs in the hindwing fused, as in Chloropaschia, Pandoflabella, Tallula, Phidotricha, Pococera, Milgithea, Tancoa, Oneida, Dasyvesica, Bibasilaris, Anarnatula, Toripa/pus and Lacalma. Identification synopsis. Deuterollyta can be identified by a forewing pattern (Fig. 120) with the postmedial line above R5 shifting abruptly toward the base of the wing. Deuterollyta is most closely related to Mediavia. See Mediavia for a comparison of the two genera. Type species. Deuterollyta conspicualis Lederer, 1863, ibid. 7 (10):359, Taf. 7, Figs. 16, 17.

Distribution. Florida and Mexico to Brazil and Argentina. Biology. Specimens with the following host-plant data are in the USNM: aidana from Cuba on Picramnia pentandra Sw. (Simaroubaceae); chlorisalis on avocado (Lauraceae) from Costa Rica; majuscula on avocado from Honduras and Florida; zetila on avocado from Peru; subcurvalis on avocado from Honduras, Costa Rica and Venezuela. Upon describing perseella, Barnes and McDunnough also noted that one specimen was reared from Persea americana Mill. (cited as P. gratissima by the authors)(Lauraceae). Martorell (1976) listed the following leafwebbers from Puerto Rico on representatives of Lauraceae: majuscula, collected at Cayey, 1,800 ft on Nectandra sintensii Mez (Lauraceae); at Cayey and Arecibo on Ocotea leucoxylon (Sw.) G6mez Maza (Lauraceae); and at Cayey, 1,500 ft on Phoebe elongata (Vahl) Nees (Lauraceae); and ragonoti at El Pastillo and Mona Island on Conocarpus erectus L. (Combretaceae). Remarks. Hampson (1 896) treated Deuterollyta as a junior synonym under Stericta, but Janse (1931) disagreed with Hampson's placement based on wing venation and placed it in Jocara. Janse did not know whether Deuterollyta was "worth preserving" as he could not find any differences between it and Jocara trabalis Grote. Holland and Schaus (1925) treated Deuterollyta as a junior synonym of Jocara. I have res urrected Deuterollyta based on the synapomorphies listed in the diagnosis. Therefore,</page><page sequence="28">28 JOURNAL OF THE NEW YORK ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY Vol. 10 1(1) many species described in Jocara are now placed in this genus. The true identity of Jocara is not known. The type species, Jocara fragilis Walker, was described from one female from the Dominican Republic. Only one other specimen, another female, from Haiti was located. Deuterollyta has 36 species (see Nomenclatural Summary). I suspect that some will prove to be species complexes. Species are distinguished by scale color and pattern. They are also recognized by modifications of the extension of the scape, the uncus and by the dimensions of the signa. Milgithea Schaus, 1922 Figs. 37-41, 121 Milgithea Schaus, 1922:208. Diagnosis. Milgithea is diagnosed by one autapomorphy, the secondary fingerlike protusions on the scape extension (Fig. 40). Identification synopsis. Milgithea can be identified by a forewing pattern (Fig. 121) having a prominent reniform spot sometimes extending toward the costa, a post medial line extending from R5 basally with a small patch of white scales toward the outer margin, and a medial line twice curved. The hindwing has a spot on IA near the margin. Milgithea and Toripalpus are very similar in that they both have a medial line in the forewing that is twice curved and a faint spot on 1 A near the margin of the hindwing, but they are externally distinguishable. In Milgithea the postmedial line has a small patch of white scales toward the outer margin and extends from R5 toward the costa basally, but in Toripalpus the postmedial line extends from R, toward the outer margin and toward the base of the wing after CuA2. Both Milgithea and To ripalpus have an elongated scape, but the scape extension of Milgithea has secondary fingerlike projections. The second segment of the labial palpus of the Milgithea is tubular, and in Toripalpus it is simple with no modifications. Milgithea has a U-shaped sclerotized structure at the base of the uncus that is absent in Toripalpus. The signa of Milgithea are two spinelike, scobinate projections, whereas the signa are absent in Toripalpus. Type species. Pococera melanoleuca Hampson, 1896, Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond. Part IV: 458, by original designation. Type locality. Colombia (BMNH). Species examined. alboplagialis (Dyar), melanoleuca (Hampson), rufiapicalis (Hampson), suramisa (Schaus), trilinearis (Hampson). Distribution. Mexico and Florida south to Brazil; the only species in the Caribbean is trilinearis. Biology. Adults of trilinearis in the USNM have labels that state they were reared from larvae on Manilkara emarginata Britton &amp; P. Wilson (Sapotaceae) from Middle Torch Key and Sugarloaf Key, Florida. Remarks. Janse (1931) provided a description and stated that Milgithea was close to Jocara (based on trabalis Grote) when he studied the genitalia. That Toripalpus trabalis is closely related to Milgithea is substantiated by this study. Milgithea has five species (see Nomenclatural Summary), three added after re definition of the genus.

The extension of the scape and maxillary and labial palpi in the male are highly modified and variable. Oneida Hulst, 1889 Fig. 122 Oneida Hulst, 1889:63. Diagnosis. Oneida has one autapomorphy, the base of the juxta lacks a medial lobe, but with a convex midventral deformation (fig. 9 in Solis, 1991); and one homoplasious character, the second segment of the labial palpus is simple, with no modifications (fig. 9 in Solis, 1991), also occurring in Bibasilaris, Tallula, Chloro paschia, Roeseliodes, Cecidipta, Deuterollyta, Accinctapubes, Anarnatula, Cacozelia, and Toripalpus. Identification synopsis. Oneida can be identified by a forewing pattern (Fig. 122) with the postmedial line concave proximally only to M2, and prominent black scales proximally to the postmedial line. The sister group of Oneida is Dasyvesica. Oneida has a postmedial line concave proximally only from the costa to M2 and in Dasyvesica it is concave from the costa to M, and then again at CuA, to the posterior margin of the wing. Oneida has prominent black scales proximal to the postmedial line from the costa to M2 and Dasyvesica has dark scales proximally to the median line from M2 to IA + 2A. The medial line is not present in Oneida. Oneida is diagnosed by a juxta which lacks a medial lobe with a slight convex midventral deformation, whereas Dasyvesica also lacks a medial lobe, but midventrally it is flat. Oneida has a second segment of the labial palpus that is simple, but in Dasyvesica it is tubular. In Oneida the third segment of the maxillary palpus arises at the apex of the second segment, and in Dasyvesica it arises at the base of the second segment. Type species. Oneida lunulalis Hulst, 1889, ibid. 5(3): 64, by monotypy. Type locality: Canada, New York (AMNH). Species examined. lunulalis Hulst, luniferella Hulst, marmorata (Schaus), mejona Schaus, grisiella Solis. Distribution. Eastern North America from Canada to Florida, west to Colorado, and south to Costa Rica. Biology. One specimen has been reared on red oak in mid-August in southern Ontario (Prentice et al., 1965), one specimen on beech in September in Grenville (Raizenne, 1952), and one specimen on Quercus sp. (Solis, 1991), later found to have fed on both red and white oak (T. Harrison, pers. comm.). Specimens have been caught at elevations of up to 7,900 ft. Remarks. Hampson (1896) placed Oneida under Tioga. Janse (1931) resurrected the genus based on venation. Based on labial and maxillary palpi he believed that Oneida was closely related to atrifascialis Hulst and aplastella Hulst, but this study does not support his hypothesis. The species atrifascialis is placed in Tallula and aplastella in Pococera. The species grisiella was added to this genus after re-definition. Oneida was recently revised (Solis, 1991). Species are distinguished by wing color and pattern. They are also defined by dimensions of male genitalic components and the ratio of signum length to diameter of its base in the female.</page><page sequence="31">1993 POCOCERA COMPLEX 31 Phidotricha Ragonot, 1888 Figs. 42-46, 123 Phidotricha Ragonot, 1888:139. Eutrichocera Hampson, 1904:182. NEW SYNONYMY. Jocarula Dyar, 1925:219. NEW SYNONYMY. Diagnosis. Phidotricha is diagnosed by one unique autapomorphy, the hairlike setae on the antennae long and appressed on ventral side, and by one homoplasy, the tip of the tegumen sclerite as broad as the base (Fig. 44), as in Quadraforma and Pococera. Identification synopsis. Phidotricha can be identified by a forewing pattern (Fig. 123) with the postmedial line curving toward the outer margin at M2 and a median line with dark scales from M2 to the posterior margin. Phidotricha is the sister group of Tallula. Based on wing pattern, it is difficult to confuse the two, but Phidotricha can be confused with some species of Pococera. The males of Phidotricha have the very long hairlike setae on the antenna that are lacking in Pococera males. Males and females of Phidotricha can be distinguished by a median line in the forewing with dark scales from M2 to the posterior margin that does not occur in Pococera. Phidotricha and Pococera share many homoplasies, but Phido tricha has a scape that is not elongated, and is elongated in Pococera. The second segment of the labial palpus is concave in Phidotricha and tubular in Pococera. The third segment of the maxillary palpus is at the apex of the second segment in Phi dotricha but at the base of the second segment in Pococera. In the forewing R, and R2 are separate in Phidotricha, but fused in Pococera. R3 and R4 of the forewing in Phidotricha are fused, but separate in Pococera. The discocellular cell in Phidotricha is half or less the forewing length, and in Pococera it is greater than half the length. In Phidotricha the sclerotized structure at the base of the uncus is triangular-shaped, but it is U-shaped in Pococera. The width of the uncus at the caudal end is not wider than the width at the midpoint in Phidotricha, but it is wider than the midpoint in Pococera. The medial lobe at the base of the valva is absent in Phidotricha and present in Pococera. Type species. Phidotricha erigens Ragonot, 1888, ibid. 6(8): 139, by monotypy. Type locality.

Specimens have been reared on major agricultural crops such as corn, sorghum, lima beans and tropical fruit plants such as tamarind and loquat. The biology of erigens Ragonot, which in the economic literature has been misidentified as atramentalis Lederer, was described by Hoyle (1961), and the larval and pupal stages described by Passoa (1985). Martorell (1976) listed atramentalis on Cleroden drum squamatum Vahl (Verbenaceae), Mangifera indica L. (Anacardiaceae) and buds of Terminalia catappa L. (Combretaceae); and insularella in "bulbs" of Agave sisala na Perrine (Amaryllidaceae).</page><page sequence="32">32 JOURNAL OF THE NEW YORK ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY Vol. 10 1(1) .1~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~' Figs. 42-46r Phidotricha erigens Ragonot. 42.

Hampson (1896) synonymized Phidotricha erigens under Pococera atra mentalis based on the lack of an extension from the scape. Janse (1931) found it "peculiar" that certain aspects to the genitalia of atramentalis and gibella, the type of Pococera, were so different. I resurrected Phidotricha when the types of erigens Ragonot and atramentalis Lederer were studied and found not to be conspecific or congeneric. In this study atramentalis is placed in Tallula. Holland and Schaus (1925) synonymized the two species and placed them in Pococera as did Hampson (1896). Phidotricha has seven species names (see Nomenclatural Summary) although it is not clear how many biological species are involved. Delineation of species may prove to be difficult because genitalia and head structures appear similar, varying only in size. Species are recognized by wing color and pattern. Roeseliodes Warren, 1891 Figs. 47-51, 124 Roeseliodes Warren, 1891:435. Diagnosis. Roeseliodes has many autapomorphies: a reduced proboscis, a clypeus with median lobe absent (Fig. 51), hindwing with CuA2 lacking and M2 and M3 fused (Fig. 50), an uncus half as long as vinculum, a juxta with two lateral lobes and pointed at the apex (Fig. 48), and a sclerotized lamella postvaginalis (Fig. 47). The following homoplasious characters also are diagnostic of this genus: a second segment of the labial palpus simple, with no modifications, also occurring in Bibasilaris, Oneida, Tallula, Chloropaschia, Cecidipta, Deuterollyta, Accinctapubes, Anarnatula, Cacoze lia, and Toripalpus; the forewing R3 and R4 fused, as in Macalla; a third anal vein not coincident with the second anal vein, also occurring in Tallula, Phidotricha and Tetralopha, Oneida, Dasyvesica, and Anarnatula; a medial lobe absent at the base of the valva, as in Tallula, Phidotricha, Mediavia, and Tancoa and in the outgroup Macalla; and the ductus ejaculatorius terminal, which also occurs in Tancoa. Identification synopsis. Roeseliodes can be identified by the forewing pattern (Fig. 124) with a black, prominent medial line curving out medially. Roeseliodes is very distinct based on its many autapomorphies. It is most similar to Cecidipta. See Cecidipta for a comparison with Roeseliodes. Type species.

Species from a variety of other genera were included in this genus after re-definition, and it now includes six species (see Nomenclatural Summary) that differ in wing color and pattern. There are also differences in the shape of the uncus and length of the extension of the scape in males, the amount of sclerotization in the lamella postvaginalis, the size of the corpus bursae, and length of the ductus bursa and signa.</page><page sequence="34">34 JOURNAL OF THE NEW YORK ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY Vol. 10 1(1) .,e.;..i .

Diagnosis. Tallula is diagnosed by one autapomorphy, vein CuA, of the forewing arches toward M3 (Fig. 55), and several homoplasious characters, a simple second segment of the labial palpus, with no modifications (Fig. 54), also occurring in Bi basilaris, Oneida, Chloropaschia, Roeseliodes, Cecidipta, Deuterollyta, Accinctapubes, Cacozelia, and Toripalpus; Rs of the hindwing more than half the length of disco cellular cell, as in Carthara and Cacozelia; the medial lobe at the base of the juxta small and round, as in Chloropaschia, Quadraforma, Pandoflabella, Mazdacis, Car thara, Mediavia, Tancoa, Deutero/lyta, and Cacozelia; and the corpus bursae lacks a signa as in Toripa/pus. Identification synopsis. Tallula can be identified by a forewing pattern (Fig. 125) consisting of an apical area beyond the postmedial line that is always suffused with dark scales, an area between the medial and postmedial line that is almost all white, and an area between the basal and medial line with dark scales. Tallula is the sister group of Phidotricha, but as mentioned previously they are not easily confused. Phidotricha has gray or brown scales on the entire forewing. Tallula has dark scales, usually brown, apically and between the basal and medial line of the forewing, and white scales that form the basal field, especially between the medial and postmedial line. On the male antennae Phidotricha has setae that are more than two antennal segments long, whereas in Tallula they are only twice as long as two antennal segments. The second segment of the labial palpus is concave in Phidotricha, and in Tallula it is simple with no modifications. The origin of R2 in the forewing of Phidotricha is distal to the discocellular cell, but in Tallula the origin is proximal to the cell. R3 and R4 of the forewing are fused in Phidotricha, but separate in Tallula. In the hindwing Rs is less than half the length of the discocellular cell in Phidotricha, but more than half the length of the cell in Tallula. The tip of the tegumen sclerite in Phidotricha is as broad as the base, and in Tallula it is less broad than the base. In Phidotricha the medial lobe at the base of the juxta is long and pointed, but small and round in Tallula. Phidotricha has two spinelike signa, but Tallula lacks the signa. Type species. Tetralopha atrifascialis Hulst, 1886, Trans. Am. Ent. Soc. 13: 160, by subsequent designation. Type locality. Texas, USA (AMNH). Species examined. atrifascialis (Hulst), beroella (Schaus), fieldi Barnes &amp; Mc Dunnough, melazonalis Hampson, watsoni Barnes &amp; McDunnough. Distribution. In North America species occur from North Carolina to Arizona, Texas, southern California south to Mexico. They are also present throughout Central America to Panama and in the Caribbean. In South America, species occur in Ven ezuela, Bolivia, French Guiana and the Amazon Basin of Brazil. Biology. Kimball (1965) reported that larvae had been reared on Rutaceae (lemon, orange, grapefruit) in Florida. Members of this genus have been reared on live oak in Mississippi according to specimens in the USNM. Remarks. Hampson (1896) sank Tallula under Tioga. Janse (1931) used atrifas cialis Hulst for his study of the genus.

Holland and Schaus (1925) placed most of the species under the genus Tioga. Munroe (1983) resurrected Tallula and placed Tioga as a junior synonym of Tetralopha. Many of the species were already included due to their external similarity. It has 11 species (see Nomenclatural Summary), but I suspect that many are synonyms, because little or no variation was apparent in descaled structures. They differ only in size and wing pattern. Tancoa Schaus, 1922 Figs. 57-62, 126 Tancoa Schaus, 1922:217. Diagnosis. Tancoa has three autapomorphies found in the male genitalia: presence of socii, a membranous extension at the apex of the costa of valva, and a dorsocaudal extension from the tegumen (Fig. 59). Several homoplasious characters also diagnose this genus: a third segment of the maxillary palpus arising at the midpoint of the second segment, also occurring in Mazdacis; a sclerotized pattern on the eighth abdominal sternum, also occurring in Chloropaschia; absence of a medial lobe at base of valva, which is also absent in Roeseliodes, Tallula, Phidotricha, Mediavia, and the outgroup Macal/a; juxtal arms do not extend to the costa of valva as in Roeseliodes, Cecidipta, Carthara, Mediavia, Oneida, Dasyvesica, Deuterollyta, Ac cinctapubes, Bibasilaris, Anarnatula, and Lacalma; and the ductus ejaculatorius ter minal, also occurring in Roeseliodes. Identification synopsis. This genus can be identified by narrow wings and lines or spots of dark scales basal to the medial line of the forewing (Fig. 126). The genus Tancoa is the sister group of Pococera. See Pococera for a comparison of the two genera. Type species. Deuterollyta calitas Druce, 1899, Biol. Cent. Amer., Ins. Lep.-Het.

Mexico (Yucatan) to Peru and Brazil, with one record from Trinidad. Biology. Two new species in the collection of Vitor 0. Becker (Planaltina, Brazil) were reared one on Emmotum nitens Miers (Icacinaceae), and the other on Qualea grandiflora Martius (Vochysiaceae). Remarks. Janse (1931) redescribed Tancoa and stated that the "genitalia are very peculiar and would place Tancoa in a group by itself." Its affinity was unknown to Janse. This study places Tancoa as the sister group to Pococera. Most of the ten species in the genus are very similar externally and were already included in the genus (see Nomenclatural Summary). They can be distinguished by wing color and pattern; shape of the apex of the uncus, valva, socius, extension from the tegumen; scale tuft on the valva; and sclerotization of the eighth abdominal sternum. The extension from the scape and the length of the third segment of the maxillary palpus also may provide information at the species level.</page><page sequence="38">38 JOURNAL OF THE NEW YORK ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY Vol. 10 1(1) A&lt;t~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~t W. t. ..: .f ...

NEW SYNONYMY. Attacapa Hulst, 1889:71. REVISED SYNONYMY. Diagnosis. Pococera is diagnosed by a unique combination of homoplasious char acters, usually a costal fold in the forewing of the male, a discocellular cell half or less than the length of forewing, also occurring in Mazdacis, 3A not coincident with 1A + 2A, as in Roeseliodes, Tallula, Phidotricha, Oneida, Dasyvesica, and Anar natula, the tip of the tegumen sclerite as broad as the base, as in Quadraforma and Phidotricha, the base ofjuxta with the medial lobe long and pointed as in Phidotricha, Milgithea, Accinctapubes, Bibasilaris, Anarnatula, and Toripalpus, a single row of setae on the caudal end of uncus, as in Cecidipta, Phidotricha, and Tallula, and the width at the caudal end of the uncus wider than the width of the midpoint, as in Cecidipta, Mediavia, Bibasilaris and Lacalma. Identification synopsis. Pococera can be identified by a wing pattern (Fig. 127) with the postmedial line extending to outer margin at M2 and the postmedial line that is faintly present in the hindwing. The sister group of Pococera is Tancoa, but they can easily be differentiated. Pococera has an elongated scape, and Tancoa does not. Pococera has the third segment of the maxillary palpus arising at the base of the second segment, and Tancoa has the third segment arising at the midpoint of the second segment. In the hindwing, Sc+R, and Rs are separate in Tancoa, but fused in Pococera. Setae at the caudal end of the uncus are a single row on Pococera, but in Tancoa the setae arise between the caudal end and half the length of the uncus. The width of the uncus at the caudal end is wider than the midpoint of the uncus in Pococera, but not wider in Tancoa. Pococera has a medial lobe at the base of the valva that is absent in Tancoa. The ductus ejaculatorius is terminal in Tancoa and subterminal in Pococera. The juxtal arms do not extend to the costa of the valva in Pococera, but extend beyond the costa in Tancoa. The medial lobe at the base of the juxta in Pococera is long and pointed, but small and round in Tancoa. Type species. Pococera gibella Zeller, 1848, ibid. XI: 874, by monotypy. Type locality.

Distribution. Southern areas of eastern and midwestern provinces of Canada to Brazil. Biology. Most of the biological information on the species has been compiled by the Canadian Department of Agriculture (Raizenne, 1952; Prentice et al., 1965) as they are occasional pests of deciduous trees and conifers. The larvae have been reared on very diverse host plants from pines to legumes to oaks (see Table 2). Most of the species are colonial webbers and folders of leaves. Allyson (1977) conducted a larval study of nine species and described the habits. Studies on larvae feeding on sycamore (Thompson and Solomon, 1986) suggest multiple broods in militella. Remarks. Hampson (1896) synonymized Tetralopha under Pococera. Holland and Schaus (1925) resurrected Tetralopha and designated the type species as militella Zeller. They did not study the type of Pococera and stated that gibella Zeller was not found "in any collection in the United States." Janse (1931) stated that he did see two specimens of gibella sent to him by the Berlin Zoological Museum, but he did not see the type, and the male sent to him lacked the head. He used a female specimen of asperatel/a Clemens as an example of Tetralopha because he did not have a specimen militella Zeller. Janse used Hampson's key to describe the difference be tween the two genera. Hampson used the absence of an extension from the scape in two species of Pococera to separate them from other species with a process. Gibella does have a process, but I found it to be short in comparison to that of militella after denuding the head. Hampson also used the presence of a deep furrow in the cell of the forewing of the male Pococera, but absent in Tetralopha. This furrow is present in species of Tetralopha, but it is not prominent as in Pococera. Hampson also used wing venation to separate the two genera, but the males of Tetralopha have a highly variable and deformed venation co-occurring with a costal fold. This genus contains 44 species names (see Nomenclatural Summary) and has always been regarded as difficult at the species level. Some species can be recognized by wing pattern and color. A costal fold is present in males of most species, but is</page><page sequence="42">42 JOURNAL OF THE NEW YORK ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY Vol. 10 1(1) Table 2.

It is suspected that comparative dimensions of the female signa and male uncus may be useful at the species level. Heads of the males vary widely from having a definite extension from the scape to an extension that barely protrudes from the scape to one that is simple, as in females, and a long third segment of the maxillary palpus arising from the base of the second segment. It may be that larvae and pupae will provide reliable characters at the species level. Species have been thought to be highly host specific, but in at least one case this has been shown to be untrue. Allyson (1977) reported that asperatella Clemens has been reared on Acer, Ulmus, Fagus, Carya, Ostrya, Gleditsia and Rhus. Toripalpus Grote, 1877 Figs. 70-74, 128 Toripalpus Grote, 1877:265. Diagnosis. This genus has one homoplasy, the corpus bursae lacks signa as in Tallula. Identification synopsis. Toripalpus can be identified by a forewing pattern (Fig. 128) with the postmedial line extending from R5 toward the outer margin and toward the base of the wing after CuA2 and a medial line that is twice curved. A faint spot on 1A of the hindwing is present near the margin. Toripalpus is found at the base of the cladogram of the Pococera complex. See Cacozelia, which it resembles externally, and Milgithea, which it is closely related to, for comparisons with these genera. Type species. Toripalpus brevionatalis Grote, 1877, ibid. 19: 265, by monotypy. Type locality. Texas, Colorado, USA (AMNH). Species examined. breviornatalis Grote, trabalis Grote. Distribution. Trabalis occurs from British Columbia south to New Mexico, and breviornatalis occurs only in Texas, Oklahoma, and Florida. Biology. The following host plant information is available at the USNM: brevior natalis on Eriogonum tomentosum Michx. Benth. (Polygonaceae) from Florida, and trabalis on Eriogonumfasciculatum from southern California. Comstock and Dam mers (1935) described the larva and pupa of trabalis Grote. Remarks. Toripalpus was resurrected for two species that were previously placed in Jocara (see Nomenclatural Summary); it may be distinguished by wing pattern and color. Other differences may be seen in the shape of the clypeus, second and third segments of the maxillary palpus, and in the wing venation. Pandoflabella, new genus Figs. 75-79, 129 Diagnosis. Pandoflabella is characterized by an autapomorphy, the flabellate sec ond labial segment (Fig. 76). Identification synopsis. Pandoflabella can be identified by the forewing pattern (Fig. 129) with the postmedial line extending toward the outer margin from M2 to CuA2, and a patch of darker scales beyond the postmedial line above M2. The medial line is bifurcate, turning sharply toward the base of the wing below CuA2 and toward the base of the postmedial line about halfway along the width of the wing. The reniform spot is a small black curve.</page><page sequence="44">44 JOURNAL OF THE NEW YORK ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY Vol. 10 1(1) tF~~ Figs. 70-74 Toripapus sp 70 Female genitalia ofT breviornatalis Grote #441 MAS 7 Male genitalia of T. trabalis Grote #150 MAS. 72.

In Chloropaschia the reniform spot is a dark line, but in Pandoflabella it is a black curve. In Pandoflabel la the extension ofthe scape is longer than the base ofthe pedicel, but in Chloropaschia it is shorter than the base of the pedicel. The second segment of the labial palpus is flabellate in Pandoflabella, but simple with no modifications in Chloropaschia. The third segment of the maxillary palpus in Chloropaschia arises slightly below the apex of the second segment, but in Pandoflabella it arises at the base of the second segment.

Southern Mexico to the Matto Grosso in Brazil. Biology. No information available. Remarks. Most of the species in Pandoflabella were previously placed in Auradisa. Auradisa is now a junior synonym of Pococera. Pandoflabella is composed of 11 species (see Nomenclatural Summary) and can be distinguished in the male genitalia by variation in shape of the juxta, shape of the valva, shape of the uncus, and the number of setae on the uncus. Other useful characters include the length of the extension of the scape and the nature of certain specialized structures on the ovipositor lobes, and length and width of the signa. Etymology. The name of this genus is derived from the Latin pando- meaning "to spread" and the Latin flabellum (neuter) meaning "fan" in reference to its autapo morphy. Bibasilaris, new genus Figs. 80-84, 130 Diagnosis. Bibasilaris has one autapomorphy, the coecum of the aedeagus is bilobed (Fig. 84). Identification synopsis. The forewing pattern (Fig. 130) has the postmedial line extending toward the outer margin at Ml and curving toward the base of wing to the posterior margin. The reniform spot is a dark straight line. The hindwing postmedian line is present. Carthara is similar in wing length and basal color of the forewing to Bibasilaris. But Carthara has a second segment of the labial palpus concave, whereas it is simple in Bibasilaris. The frenulum hook is absent in Carthara and present in Bibasilaris. Carthara has an uncus that is not wider caudally than at the midpoint, but is wider caudally in Bibasilaris. Carthara has a juxta with a medial lobe that is small and round, and in Bibasilaris it is long and pointed. Bibasilaris also has the Rs of the hindwing more than half the length of the discocellular cell, whereas in Carthara it less than half the length. Description.

The two species included here (see Nomenclatural Summary) were pre viously placed in Locastra, an Old World genus. Length of the wing averages 1.5 cm. Species are distinguished by external wing morphology and the shape of the uncus in the male genitalia. Etymology. The genus name is derived from the Latin bi-meaning "two," and from the Latin basilaris (feminine) meaning at the "base." Accinctapubes, new genus Figs. 85-89, 131 Diagnosis. Accinctapubes has two autapomorphies, a male frenulum that is bulbous at tip (Fig. 89); and ovipositor lobes with some spatulate setae, that are trifurcate distally (Fig. 85). Identification synopsis. Accinctapubes can be identified by the forewing pattern (Fig. 131) with the postmedial line curving toward the outer margin at M. Species are sexually dimorphic, the males with white patches of scales, and the females without. The median line and reniform spot are not prominent. The hindwing post median line is prominent from the costal margin to IA. Accinctapubes is the sister group of the Cecidipta-Roeseliodes clade. Species of Accinctapubes are approximately midway in wing length between Cecidipta and Roe seliodes although some females of Accinctapubes approach the wing length of some Cecidipta males. Fresh specimens of Accinctapubes have the base of the forewing green, but this area is beige or white in Cecidipta. The apex of the male frenulum in Cecidipta is tapered, but in Accinctapubes it is bulbous. In the male genitalia Cecidipta has a tegumen sclerite that extends beyond the midventral position, whereas in Accinctapubes it does not reach a midventral position. The tip of the tegumen sclerite is narrower than the base in Accinctapubes, but in Cecidipta the tip is broader than the base. Cecidipta lacks a sclerotized structure at the base of the uncus, but it is present in Accinctapubes.

Type locality. Sarayacu, Ecuador (TMP). Species examined. albifasciata (Druce), chionopheralis (Hampson), apicalis (Schaus). Distribution. Southern Mexico to Paraguay and Brazil. Biology. Albifasciata has been reared on avocado (Lauraceae) (Dyar, 1912). In Trinidad the species is known as the "avocado moth," and "The caterpillars are gregarious and live in nests made by webbing leaves and branches with tough silk" (Kaye and Lamont, 1927 from Williams, 1922, p. 62: "Fruit Cultivation in Trinidad" "Pests of Avocados: Webbing Caterpillars"). Remarks. Two newly included species were previously placed in the Old World genus Stericta. Accinctapubes has four species (see Nomenclatural Summary), but there is at least one new species in the USNM collection. Species are distinguished by the presence or absence of a thick patch of setae on the dorsal surface of the forewing and the shape of the lobe at the base of the valva in the male genitalia. Etymology. The generic name is derived from the Latin accinctus meaning "well equipped," and from the Latin pubes (feminine) meaning "private parts," in an anthropomorphic sense to its two unique autapomorphies, a bulbous frenulum in the male and some trifurcate setae on the female ovipositor. Mediavia, new genus Figs. 90-94, 132 Diagnosis. Mediavia has two unique autapomorphies: the origin of R2 distal to the discocellular cell (Fig. 92), and the presence of a lobe at the base of valva adjacent to the costa extending midventrally to the juxta (Fig. 91). Two homoplasies also diagnose this genus: a medial lobe is absent at the base of the valva, as in Roeseliodes, Tallula, Phidotricha, and Tancoa and the outgroup Macalla; and an uncus wider at the caudal end than the midpoint, also occurring in Cecidipta, Pococera, Bibasilaris, and Lacalma. Identification synopsis. Mediavia can be identified by the forewing pattern (Fig. 132) with the postmedial line curving toward the costa of the wing above CuA, and below CuA, extending to base of wing. The sister group of Mediavia is Deuterollyta, and externally they can be distin guished by the shape of the postmedial line in the forewing. In Deuterollyta the postmedial line above R5 shifts abruptly toward the base of the wing and in Mediavia</page><page sequence="51">1993 POCOCERA COMPLEX 51 ..Q O.. Figs. 90-94.

Deuterollyta has CuP present in the forewing but it is absent in Mediavia. A frenulum hook is present in Deuterollyta but absent in Mediavia. Sc+R, and Rs in the hindwing are fused in Deuterollyta but separate in Mediavia. The uncus at the caudal end is as wide as the width at midpoint in Deuterollyta, but in Mediavia the caudal end is wider than the width at the midpoint. The medial lobe at the base of the valva is absent in Deuterollyta but present in Mediavia. Description. Male head (Fig. 93): Scape extension longer than base of pedicel; second segment of labial palpus concave; third segment of maxillary palpus at base of second segment. Wing (Fig. 92): Retinaculum a group of hooked setae below Cu. Forewing with CuP absent; 3A intersecting with IA + 2A. Hindwing with Sc+R, and Rs separate. Male genitalia (Fig. 91): Juxta with small median lobe; juxtal arms not reaching costa of valva; tegumen sclerite not reaching midventral position, tip narrower than base; base of uncus with U-shaped sclerotized structure.

Distribution. Northeastern Mexico south to Curitiba, Brazil. Apparently not pres ent in the Caribbean. Biology. No information available. Remarks. The species included in Mediavia were previously placed primarily in Stericta and Jocara. Mediavia has 18 species (see Nomenclatural Summary). The species can be dis tinguished by prominent scale color and pattern, variation of the shape of the lobe adjacent to the costa at the base of the valva, and the length of the extension of the scape. Etymology. This genus name is derived from the Latin media via meaning "middle of the road" in reference to one of its autapomorphies, a lobe extending medially toward the juxta. Quadraforma, new genus Figs. 95-99, 133 Diagnosis. Quadraforma has one autapomorphy, a long and square-shaped medial lobe at the base of valva (Fig. 96). It is also distinguished by two homoplasious characters, a tubular second segment of the labial palpus, also occurring in Bibasilaris, Dasyvesica, Mazdacis, Milgithea, Pococera, Tancoa, Cacozelia, and Lacalma, and the tip of tegumen sclerite as broad as base, as in Phidotricha and Pococera. Identification synopsis. Quadraforma can be identified by a forewing pattern (Fig. 133) with the basal band usually present in males. The medial line bifurcates just below the reniform spot, one line extending to the posterior margin and the other to base of the postmedial line. The reniform spot is a small line.</page><page sequence="53">1993 POCOCERA COMPLEX 53 - ~ ~ ~ ~ . . ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~ R Figs 9599 Quadraforma obliqualis (Hampson); 95; Fee genitalia #892 MAS, 96: Male genitalia #891 MAS. 97.

Externally, species of Chloro paschia and Quadraforma can be distinguished by a medial line that curves basally in Chloropaschia, whereas the medial line bifurcates, one line extending to the pos terior margin and the other to the base of the postmedial line in Quadraforma. Chloropaschia has a simple second segment of the labial palpus and Quadraforma has a tubular second segment of the labial palpus. In Chloropaschia the third segment of the maxillary palpus arises at the apex of the second segment, but in Quadraforma it arises at the base of the second segment. In Chloropaschia Sc+R, and Rs of the hindwing are fused, and in Quadraforma they are separate. Quadraforma lacks the sclerotized pattern on the eighth abdominal sternum that is present in Chloropaschia. Description. Male head (Fig. 95): Extension of scape not extending beyond base of pedicel; second segment of labial palpus tubular; third segment of maxillary palpus arising from base of second segment. Wing (Fig. 96): Retinaculum a group of hooked setae just below Cu. Forewing with CuP absent; 3A intersecting with IA + 2A. Hindwing with Sc+R, and Rs separate.

Sinaloa, Mexico to southern Brazil. Apparently not present in the Caribbean. Biology. No information available. Remarks. Most of the species in Quadraforma were previously placed in the Old World genus Stericta. Quadraforma has four species (see Nomenclatural Summary) that can be distin guished by scale color and size. Quadraforma obliqualis exhibits much variation externally and in the labial and maxillary palpi, and may be a complex of sibling species. Etymology. The genus name is derived from the Latin quadra meaning "square" and the Latinforma (feminine) meaning "shape" referring to the square-shaped lobe at the base of the valva. Mazdacis, new genus Figs. 100-104, 134 Diagnosis. Mazdacis has one autapomorphy, the lateral ridges on the frons extended medially to base of the clypeus (Fig. 101). The genus is also diagnosed by a com bination of homoplasious characters: the third segment of the maxillary palpus arising at the midpoint of the second segment, as in Tancoa, the second segment of the labial palpus tubular, as in Dasyvesica, Quadraforma, Cacozelia, Tancoa, Pococera, Milgithea and Lacalma; a frenulum hook present, as in Milgithea, Deuterollyta, Bibasilaris, Accinctapubes, Anarnatula, Toripalpus and Macalla; the discocellular cell</page><page sequence="55">1993 POCOCERA COMPLEX 55 I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I * , l X '' X ' it i:4 ; Figbs.10-0.

Identification synopsis. Mazdacis can be identified by a sheen to the entire body particularly the wings and a forewing pattern (Fig. 134) with the postmedial line extending toward the outer margin to M2 and M3 and then extending toward the base of the wing until CuA2 where the line extends toward the posterior margin. A band extends from the medial line at CuP to the base of wing. The reniform spot is faint and curved. Mazdacis is the sister group to the Chloropaschia, Quadraforma clade. Mazdacis can be distinguished from Chloropaschia by the second segment of the labial palpus that is simple in Chloropaschia, but tubular in Mazdacis. The third segment of the maxillary palpus arises slightly below the apex of the second segment in Chloropas chia, but is at the midpoint of the second segment in Mazdacis. The frenulum hook is absent in Chloropaschia, but present in Mazdacis. The discocellular cell is more than half as long as the length of the forewing in Chloropaschia, but half as long or less than the forewing length in Mazdacis. CuP of the forewing is absent in Mazdacis, but present in Chloropaschia. In the hindwing, Sc+R, and Rs are fused at one point in Chloropaschia, but separate in Mazdacis. The tip of the tegumen sclerite is narrower than the base in Chloropaschia, but broader than the base in Mazdacis. In Chloro paschia the ventral fold of the lamella antevaginalis is strongly bilobed, but in Maz dacis it is equal in width or weakly bilobed. Description. Male head (Fig. 101): Scape extension not longer than base of pedicel; second segment of labial palpus tubular; third segment of maxillary palpus arising at midpoint of second segment. Wing (Fig. 104): Retinaculum a frenulum hook. Forewing with CuP absent; 3A intersecting with 1 A + 2A. Hindwing with Sc+ R and Rs coincident. Male genitalia (Fig. 102): Juxta with small median lobe; juxtal arms reaching costa of valva; median lobe on valva a short, round nub; tegumen sclerite not reaching midventral position, tip broader than base; uncus base with U-shaped sclerotized structure; vesica without cornuti.

Central Brazil to French Guiana and Guyana then west to Peru. Biology. No information available. Remarks. The species presently included in this genus were previously in several genera. Mazdacis has three species (see Nomenclatural Summary). They differ in the shape of the male valva, the modification of the maxillary palpi, and the size of the ridge on the head of the male. Etymology. The generic name is derived from the Persian Mazda, "god of light" referring to the shiny surface of the adult moths. CLADISTIC ANALYSIS Monophyly of the Pococera complex. After the survey of the genera of the Epi paschiinae, the Pococera complex was found to be monophyletic based on two syn apomorphies, the presence of a saccus in the male genitalia and the distinctly narrowed</page><page sequence="57">1993 POCOCERA COMPLEX 57 ductus bursae in the female genitalia. The saccus is elongate, bulbous and curved up toward the coecum of the aedeagus and this condition is unique in the Pyralidae, but occurs in the Crambidae (B. Landry, pers. comm.) and in other lepidopteran groups. The entire vinculum may curve up toward the base of the aedeagus in other epipaschiines and pyralids, but in those groups it is not an evagination of the saccus. The term "saccus" is commonly used to describe the anteromesial point of the vinculum, but in the epipaschiines the saccus is also an evagination. In the female genitalia the ductus bursae near the ostium bursae is always less than half as wide as the posterior margin of the seventh segment, in contrast to a ductus that is at least half as wide as the posterior margin of the seventh segment as occurs in other epipaschiines (including Lacalma and Macalla), other Pyralidae (especially the epi paschiine sister group Phycitinae) and some Crambidae. The narrow ductus bursae does occur in some pyralines and crambids. The distribution of this character in the crambids is not well known. Re-examination of the genera and delimitation of the terminal taxa. To develop generic concepts, synapomorphies (unique states that do not occur in the outgroups) were sought to define the smallest groups of species. Tentative generic concepts based on the synapomorphies of species groups were tested with additional dissection of species and preliminary cladistic analyses. Groups of species that did not have syn apomorphies were consolidated with near relatives. The results ofthis analysis formed the basis of the re-classification of the genera of the Pococera complex as described in the Taxonomic Synopsis discussion following the phylogenetic analysis. Previous concepts of the importance of some characters over others were not taken into consideration. Characters such as wing pattern, color, and wing venation, upon which the old generic concepts were based, were not utilized during the development of new generic concepts. Wing pattern and color were not used as characters for this cladistic analysis (Solis, 1991), and previous concepts of wing venation were for the most part found to be unreliable (Janse, 1931, and in reference to Hampson, 1896). Many of the smaller genera that were externally distinctive, such as Anarnatula, were supported by this analysis. The larger genera (e.g., Jocara and Stericta) usually con sisted of unnatural groups of species. These genera formerly included many species now placed in a wide variety of other genera (see original combinations, Nomencla tural Summary). In the case of Stericta, the type species, divitalis Guenee from Indo Australia, was dissected and found not to belong to the Pococera complex. The Nomenclatural Summary lists genera and species that are only provisionally placed in the Pococera complex. Most of the species listed were not dissected to verify their placement due to time and other constraints, such as inaccessibility of types. Many species appear, after perusal of external characters, to be synonyms of other species. Some genera and associated species that were not included in the analysis for a number of reasons are included in the Nomenclatural Summary under Incertae sedis. For example, the description of the genus Jocara was based on one female from the Dominican Republic. Only one other specimen, another female, from Haiti was located. The type specimens of Anaeglis and Homura described by Lederer could not be located at their expected repositories in Berlin and Vienna. Outgroups. Historically, epipaschiines have been hypothesized to be closely related either to the pyralines or phycitines. The preliminary phylogenetic analysis of the Pyralidae (Solis and Mitter, 1992) placed the Epipaschiinae as sister group to the</page><page sequence="58">58 JOURNAL OF THE NEW YORK ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY Vol. 10 1(1) Phycitinae. But the Phycitinae are a highly derived group and correlation of characters for the purpose of polarization was difficult. In preliminary analyses the pyraline genus Herculia was used as an outgroup, but it too was divergent enough that the characters of the Pococera complex could not be polarized. Therefore Macal/a (sensu stricto), a genus in the Epipaschiinae but outside the Pococera complex, was chosen as the outgroup. Macalla was used because extensive material was available and because it had been studied in-depth at the species level (Howard and Solis, 1989). Macalla (sensu lato) is historically a "waste basket," and a survey of some species in Macalla outside the Western Hemisphere showed that it is not monophyletic. For the purpose of this study Macalla is restricted to noctuipalpus Dognin, thyrsisalis Walker, arctata Druce, and hyalinalis Amsel. This group of species share a juxta that is almost completely bifurcate and highly sclerotized (Fig. 107) and includes the type species, Macalla thyrsisalis Walker, from Honduras. However, Macalla was also suspected of being a highly derived group based on the worldwide survey of the genera of the Epipaschiinae. Lacalma, a well-defined genus, was then added to the analysis because the survey and studies at the species level indicated a closer affinity to the ground plan of the Pococera complex than Macal/a. Janse (193 1) included four species in Lacalma. The genus is Indo-Australian in distribution and defined by an expanded vinculum with coremata (Fig. 11 1) in the male genitalia (Janse, 1931). The exact relationship of Macal/a and Lacalma to each other and to the group being revised was not investigated, since this would require a revision of the entire subfamily on a world basis. There is some evidence that Macalla is more basal to the epipaschiines than Lacalma. Macalla lacks a tegumen "sclerite" as in other subfamilies which puts forth the possibility that Macal/a may be basal to all epi paschiines including the Pococera complex. Also, the signum in Macalla is scobinate and flat as in most phycitines, the sister group to the epipaschiines. The signa in the phycitines are variable but are never scobinate and spinelike as in the Pococera complex. Characters. For the cladistic analysis of the Pococera complex 24 terminal taxa and 65 characters were used to develop a character matrix (Table 1). The characters were discussed in the Morphology section and are listed in the Morphology section. In the following discussion and Figure 137, "autapomorphy" means a transfor mation to a derived condition only in a terminal taxon. At the interior nodes, a transformation to a derived condition occurring only once on the tree is termed a strong or unique synapomorphy. A "reversal" denotes a transformation to a ple siomorphic condition occurring only once on the tree. A "parallelism" denotes a synapomorphy of multiple origin or a multiple reversion to a primitive state either at a terminal taxon or a node. Stability tests. Homoplasy (parallelisms, convergences, reversals), coupled with incomplete sampling of taxa, introduces error into tree estimation. A variety of approaches have been suggested for empirically gauging the stability or robustness of phylogeny estimates (Farris, 1969; Mickevich, 1978; Felsenstein, 1985; Lanyon, 1985). These involve sub- or re-sampling (or re-weighting) of either the taxa or the characters. The trees produced by the Wagner analysis of the Pococera complex were subjected to two such kinds of tests, successive weighting and sequential removal of</page><page sequence="59">1993 POCOCERA COMPLEX 59 ,L~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Th'4 ~ Figs. 105-109.

Successive weighting (Farris, 1969) was applied to the data set to test the effect ofhomoplasy. It is an iterative, a posteriori procedure in which characters are weighted by their consistencies on each succeeding tree estimate until the tree does not change. This procedure should result in the emphasis of the best and most consistent set of characters (Farris, 1983; Carpenter, 1988), those that "fit a common branching pat tern" (Farris, 1969). If the topology of the tree following successive weighting is different from the initial estimated tree, then the highly homoplasious characters may be introducing error into the analysis, decreasing confidence in the estimated tree.

This exercise allows the comparison of the stability of subsets within the Pococera complex when different outgroups are used. Subsets of taxa that remain the same after the removal of taxa are more stable than those that change. Results. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed that there was considerable homo plasy in the data, but only three equally parsimonious trees were generated, of length 144 and consistency index 0.52. The disagreement among the three trees was the placement of two taxa, Bibasilaris and Accinctapubes (compare Figs. 137, 138). One tree was chosen for the purpose of discussion (Fig. 136). Successive weighting pro duced two trees with the same general topology as the tree chosen for discussion. Changes in the topology of the trees is discussed at the node in question. In the following discussion the characters are indicated by numbers in parentheses. The analyses generally supported the monophyly of the Pococera complex. That is, the two outgroups, Lacalma and Macalla, came out together whenever they were both included (Farris, 1972), except when Carthara was removed. Removal of Car thara, with the tree rooted at Macalla, placed Lacalma inside the complex as a member of a clade including the Pococera clade (Tetralopha + Pococera + Tancoa) and the Oneida clade (Oneida + Dasyvesica) just above Milgithea and Toripalpus at the base of the tree. It seems unlikely that Lacalma lies inside the Pococera complex, since Lacalma lacks the two key synapomorphies of a prominent saccus and the narrow ductus bursae that diagnose the Pococera complex. This instability is attrib utable instead to the absence in the analysis of additional outgroups close to Lacalma. The estimate of the position of the root is somewhat unstable since the arrangement of the apparently basal elements, e.g., the Pococera clade, Milgithea, and Toripalpus, differs when only Lacalma is used as the outgroup or when Toripalpus is removed. In the analyses, node 3 and node 5 in effect exchange positions (Figs. 136, 139). This results from conflicting distributions of several character states in Macalla, and Lacalma and Toripalpus. The characters in question are the presence or absence of a frenulum hook and of a lobe at the base of the valva, and the width of the caudal end of the uncus. These characters are highly homoplasious on the tree. Nevertheless, the basal elements, the Pococera clade, Milgithea, and Toripalpus, are clearly iden tified. Although the root is thus somewhat uncertain, many of the clades were maintained. All other manipulations did not destabilize the tree (Fig. 136) despite the fact that most groups are supported by very few characters. The only disagreement in almost all trees was the placement of Bibasilaris and Accinctapubes. At node 3 Milgithea is the sister group to the remainder of the Pococera complex and is diagnosed by one homoplasious synapomorphy, the presence of the sclerotized structure at the base of the uncus (35). This state is lost several times in the remainder of the clade. The removal of Milgithea from the analysis did not destabilize the general topology of the tree. Node 4 consists of the Tancoa + Pococera (sensu lato) clade and node 7. It is diagnosed by a unique synapomorphy and two homoplasious synapomorphies. The origin of a concave second labial segment (7) occurs only once on the tree. The two highly homoplasious states diagnosing this node are an absent frenulum hook (13) that re-appears in several taxa, and the presence of a long, pointed medial lobe in the juxta (56), which is subsequently lost and regained. Node 5 is diagnosed by a unique combination of homoplasious characters.

The sister group relationship of Pococera and Tetralopha (node 6) is fairly well established. This group is diagnosed by a unique combination of six characters: a relatively short discocellular cell (18), a third anal vein (22) that is not coincident with the second anal vein, a tip of the tegumen sclerite as broad as the base (31), a single row of caudal setae on the uncus (37), a caudal end of the uncus wider than the width of the midpoint (38), and a juxta with a small, round medial lobe (56). Pococera was included to show that no synapomorphies were detected to define it. Therefore Tetralopha is synonymized under Pococera (see Morphology and Taxonomic Synopsis for further discussion). Node 7 includes Pandoflabella as the basal taxon and is diagnosed by one unique synapomorphy in the female genitalia. The lamella antevaginalis (60) has a ventral fold that is entire or only weakly bilobed. The removal of this genus does not de stabilize the topology of the tree. Node 8 includes Cacozelia, node 9, and node 11, which form the only trichotomy in the tree. It is defined by a highly homoplasious separation of veins Sc+R, and Rs of the hindwing (23). Removal of Cacozelia does not destabilize the tree topology. Node 9 includes Chloropaschia, Quadraforma, and Mazdacis and is diagnosed by the homoplasious reduction of the scape (2). The modified scape is lost again at node 20. The sister group relationship of Quadraforma and Chloropaschia (node 10), is defended by a unique synapomorphy in the female genitalia. The lamella antevagina lis (60) has a ventral fold that is strongly bilobed. It is also diagnosed by the hom oplasious presence of a first anal vein in the forewing (21) that is gained several times. Node 11 includes Mediavia + Deuterollyta, and node 13. It is diagnosed by the homoplasious reduction of the juxta arms (54). In almost all manipulations, the sister group relationship of node 12 and node 13 was maintained. The sister group rela tionship of Mediavia and Deuterollyta is based on a single unique synapomorphy: the base of the first segment of the maxillary palpus is membranous and pleated (9). Node 13 includes Carthara plus node 14 and is diagnosed by a unique synapo morphy. The third segment of the maxillary palpus (10) is at the apex of the second segment. Removal of Carthara affects the placement of the group Oneida + Dasy vesica and of Lacalma (as discussed earlier), but does not otherwise change the tree. The transformation of state 3, the third segment of the maxillary palpus arising at the base of the second segment, to state 0, the third segment of the maxillary palpus arising at the apex of the segment, occurs only once on the tree, but the character is multistate and homoplasious. Degeneration of the character to less than four states would result in loss of information since states 1 and 2 are unique to terminal taxa. Alternatively, the character could prove to be too homoplasious to provide any consistent information on phylogeny. For example, the sister group relationship of Oneida and Dasyvesica is well defended by other characters and yet the states for the placement of the third maxillary segment in the two genera are at the two extremes of this four state transformation series. Further resolution by study of the maxillary palpus in the Pyralidae may solve the polarity problem of this character. Node 14 includes Bibasilaris and node 15 and is also diagnosed by a homoplasy. The medial lobe of the juxta (56) is small and round. This node is not well defended, but removal of Bibasilaris causes little destabilization. In most analyses Bibasilaris was placed either as the sister group to node 15 (Fig. 136) or node 20 (Fig. 139). The placement of this genus is not resolved.</page><page sequence="69">1993 POCOCERA COMPLEX 69 Node 15 consists of node 16 and node 18 and is diagnosed by a reversal. The lamella antevaginalis of the female genitalia (60) lacks a ventral fold. Despite the homoplasious character state, the clade is fairly stable, because all manipulations resulted in the inclusion of the same terminal taxa. Node 16 consists of Roeseliodes, Cecidipta and Accinctapubes and is diagnosed by a highly homoplasious synapomorphy, loss of the first anal vein of the forewing (21). While removal of Accinctapubes does not destabilize the remainder of the tree, the placement of Accinctapubes is not well resolved. Accinctapubes was also placed as the sister group to a clade including Bibasilaris and node 20 (Fig. 139) when either Carthara, Toripalpus or Pandoflabella were removed and when only Lacalma was used as the outgroup. The sister group relationship of Roeseliodes and Cecidipta (node 17) is defended by two homoplasious characters: loss of the sclerotized structure at the base of the uncus (35), which occurs several times in the tree, and the loss of juxtal arms (53), which occurs also in Lacalma. Node 18 is diagnosed by two homoplasious characters. The third anal vein (22) is not coincident with the second anal vein in the forewing and in the hindwing Sc+R, and Rs are fused (23). The relationship of node 19 and node 20 is not well defended. When Toripalpus is removed and Lacalma is used as an outgroup, node 19 is the sister group of node 17 and when Carthara is removed node 19 is placed in a clade at the base of the tree with the Pococera clade. The sister group relationship of Oneida and Dasyvesica is well defended by two unique synapomorphies and one homoplasy. The tegumen sclerite (30) reaches a midventral position and the juxta (56) lacks lobes. The sclerotized structure at the base of the uncus (35) is lost several times on the tree. Node 20, consisting of Anarnatula, Phidotricha, and Tallula, is defined by a par allelism, the loss of an elongate scape (2). Despite the parallelism, all manipulations resulted in the clustering of these three taxa. The sister group relationship of Phidotricha and Tallula (node 21) is supported by a unique synapomorphy. The sclerotized structure at the base of the uncus (36) is triangular rather than U-shaped. Three homoplasies also diagnose this clade: the presence of a single caudal row of setae on the uncus (37), elongate juxtal arms (54) that extend to and beyond the costa of the valva, and the absence of a (41) medial lobe on the base of the valva. Discussion. Two main problems are apparent with the results of the phylogenetic analysis. First, the relationships among the relatively primitive genera are unsettled, as exhibited by the instability on removal of some taxa, and the use of a different outgroup. Characters associated with these problems are highly homoplasious and warrant in-depth study across all taxa in the Epipaschiinae. Such a study would test the polarity and transformation series of the characters used in this study. The second problem, the placement of Bibasilaris and Accinctapubes is not resolved. Future placement of these genera may depend on discovery of additional characters. Despite these problems, certain clades are stable, always clustering together despite the manipulation. This is evidenced by the general correspondence of the trees pro duced by the Wagner analysis and successive weighting. While there is much ho moplasy, many characters on the trees are hierarchically correlated producing a stable tree. This estimated phylogeny will serve as a hypothesis to be tested further. Log ically, two lines of systematic inquiry in the Epipaschiinae follow the present study. The genera of the Pococera complex should be revised at the species level. Second,</page><page sequence="70">70 JOURNAL OF THE NEW YORK ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY Vol. 10 1(1) outgroups that have been studied in-depth at the species level should be added and used in cladistic analyses. Studies on the remaining genera outside the Pococera complex might resolve some of the questions about basal relationships and character evolution in the Pococera complex. Inferences about biogeography based on this estimate of relationship of the Po cocera complex are difficult primarily due to the overlap of distributions for almost all genera, and secondarily, to the lack of resolution at the species level and the paucity of collected material, hence a paucity of information on the entire range of the organisms. Hypotheses of insect-plant relationships are speculative because of the paucity of corroborated information on host-plant associations in many of the genera. At first glance, the list of hosts utilized (Table 2) appears to be taxonomically disparate. But recent work has uncovered a host utilization pattern correlating many unrelated plant families which share a common defense syndrome: latex and resinous canals (Dus sourd and Eisner, 1987; Farrell et al., 1991). Among the canal-bearing hosts in the Pococera complex are Sapotaceae, Fabaceae, Pinaceae, Anacardiaceae, Icacinaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Moraceae. Departures from association with canal-bearing or resinous plants are species found on temperate plant groups and polyphages. For example, Tancoa is a specialist on canal-bearing plants and occurs from southern Mexico to Brazil and the occasionally polyphagous Pococera occurs from Brazil north to Canada. Some species of Pococera and Phidotricha appear to be oliphagous; in fact only one or two species are feeders on a wide variety of plant families. In Pococera many different species feed on resinous legumes, and one species feeds on Anacar diaceae, Fabaceae, Aceraceae, Ulmaceae, Fagaceae, Juglandaceae, and Carpinaceae. One species of Tancoa feeds on the laticiferous Icacinaceae, whereas the sister group of Tancoa, Pococera, has species feeding on resin-canal bearing Pinaceae or resinous legumes. If the ancestor of the two groups is hypothesized to feed on canal-bearing plants, this could have predated Pococera radiation into temperate areas. Genera associated with canal-bearing plants are Milgithea, Pococera, Tancoa, and Cecidipta. The first three genera, basal on the cladogram, could be hypothesized to be primitively associated with canal-bearing plants. A species of Cecidipta is associated with Eu phorbiaceae and Moraceae, but few records exist between Cecidipta and the basal genera. As a result the association of Cecidipta with canal-bearing plants could be interpreted as being either plesiomorphic or a parallelism. Discovery of canal-bearing hosts for intermediary genera would support the hypothesis of plesiomorphy. The hypothesis of convergence seems less likely, a priori, because of certain complex behaviors generally associated with insects feeding on laticiferous plants (Dussourd and Eisner, 1987) that have been documented in Cecidipta and probably characterize cladistically basal genera likewise associated with canal-bearing plants. In at least one species of Cecidipta, eggs are laid on fly-induced galls on the stem and early instars feed on the gall. If there is not enough food in the gall for the development of the caterpillar, it exits the gall, severs leaf petioles, and returns to the gall with the leaves (Berg, 1877). The specialized behaviors allow the caterpillar to avoid latex defenses of the plant which it would no doubt encounter were it to feed directly on intact tissues. Similar behaviors have been documented for other lepidopteran as sociations with various laticiferous plants (Dussourd and Eisner, 1987). I expect that Roeseliodes, the highly derived sister group of Cecidipta, is probably also associated</page><page sequence="71">1993 POCOCERA COMPLEX 71 with laticiferous plants and may exhibit specialized behaviors for countering latex defense. Some of the similarities in host plant associations in the Pococera complex may be attributable to similarity in chemistry. Two distantly related plant families share benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, known to be toxic to most non-adapted herbivores (Miller and Feeny, 1983). Several genera (Deuterollyta, Accinctapubes and Tallula) have a majority of species known to feed on Lauraceae and Rutaceae. Thus, the apparent parallel associations with the families may reflect a common inherited ability to detoxify the noxious compounds.
