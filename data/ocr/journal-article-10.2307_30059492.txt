<plain_text><page sequence="1">A HIDDEN TRADITION MARK PATRICK HEDERMAN It is not the business of the artist to make himself understood, it is the business of the people to understand him. That the people are at last compelled to under- stand is proof of the artist's authority. (W.B. Yeats) It is tremendously important that great poetry be written, it makes no jot of difference who writes it. (Ezra Pound) There are some who believe that poetry, of its nature, is bound to flourish in Ireland; that, living in the shadow of Synge, Yeats, Joyce and Beckett, we belong to a tradition which automatically perpetuates itself. Maurice Harmon, in a recent study,1 suggests that the great advantage of being 'born after the Irish Literary Revival' is that 'any Irish writer' can now aspire to 'a tradition that has been widely recognised and accepted'. From another viewpoint this could be a serious disadvantage. In a recently published directory of Irish Writers, produced by the Arts Council of Ireland,2 over a hundred names appear. Are we to believe that any or all of these are co- equals of Joyce, Synge or Yeats? Is there not nowadays the possibility that anyone who shouts loudly or 'poetically' enough can be part of that 'recognized and accepted' literary tradition? A further quotation from Ezra Pound is pertinent: 'I believe in everyone writing poetry who wants to; most do. I believe in every man knowing enough music to play 'God bless our home' on the harmonium, but I do not believe in every man giving con- certs and printing his sin.' The search for contemporary greatness in art is always difficult and dangerous: diffi- cult because the canons of greatness which we apply may have been rendered anachronistic by the new work being judged; dangerous because our judgement could be the death- knell of the very greatness for which we search. Most civilizations find it safer to wait for a few hundred years and declare 'great' what- ever survives the rugged passage of that time. However, this would mean accepting that the vast majority of people must always live two hundred years, at least, behind their time. If at all possible we should try to benefit from the great art of our day. Poetry is defined here as a kind of search: the conquest of consciousness. Man, the artist, gives a human form and his signature to the space between himself and all that is not him- self. And it is genuine exploration and not just versatile repetition. The world around us reveals, through the artist, new spaces, new dimensions, new relations. 'The poet', to use T.S. Eliot's phrase, 'is occupied with frontiers of consciousness beyond which words fail, though meanings still exist,' Although philos- ophy does explore the space between sub- jectivity and the world outside, it does so in the language and idiom of the rational mind. Any experience which falls outside the scope of this specialized internal logic is left without a voice. Poetry represents consciousness before and after it has been reduced to the narrow dimension of itself which is rational thought. Consciousness is not just in and from the mind. It is more like a fever invading the whole organism. It is a total presence. The poet casts his experience into a form which is dic- tated by this relentless presence of conscious- ness. Poetry becomes the language of the per- son in the most ontological understanding of this much maligned term. In this language the mind does play an important part. But it is not an overwhelming part. The mind is just one characteristic of that overall porousness which makes the poet so adequate a filter of experience. But this is not yet enough. The experience itself has to be worthwhile if the poet's formul- ation of it is to be regarded as 'great'. The poet's struggle with his breakfast, his meeting 71</page><page sequence="2">with a crocus, or his suffering on a tube-train, may be very touching reminders of his height- ened sensitivity and our insouciance, but they are not authoritative. We may feel sorry but do not feel impelled. The experience or emot- ion or region of being which is so adequately formulated by the talented poet must be some- thing like that 'absolute experience' which Hart Crane describes as the differentiating factor between what he calls 'impressionist' and 'metaphysical' poetry. 3 Such a poem is at least a stab at the truth, and to such an extent may be different- iated from other kinds of poetry and called 'absolute'. Its evocation will not be toward decoration or amusement, but rather toward a state of consciousness, an 'innocence' (Blake) or absolute beauty. In this condition there may be discoverable under new forms certain spiritual illuminations shining with a morality essentialised from experience directly, and not from previous precepts or preconceptions. It is as though a poem gave the reader as he left it a single new word, never before spoken and impossible to actually enunciate, but self-evident as an active principle in the reader's consciousness henceforward. The danger of 'tradition' in poetry is that it ties down too much to the forms of the past which have been most successful. Great poetry is nearly always the creation of forms which explode the literary tradition which seems to be as a homogeneous culture behind it. 'Tradition' has to resurrect itself and re- arrange its resources to accommodate the novelties, which at first seemed to destroy the structures essential to tradition, but which are now incorporated and become an organic part of the tradition they sought to usurp. This means that the history of poetry becomes a time sequence which, from a distance, may look linear and sequential, but which, in fact, is a series of disconnected and unpredictable interventions. One of the possible weaknesses of the bien fait tradition of poetry, to which our Northern poets belong, is the obsession with the well made poem which draws its canons of workmanship from an already ex- isting culture. Here the more atavistic and radical elements are harnessed to a, perhaps, parasitic attachment to the sequential history of poetic forms. Every great poet should be relying on a source of his poetry within himself which is original and personal and, therefore, refract- ory to any incorporation-into a cultural family based on either history or race. Of course there are affinities and similarities between poets of the same country writing in the same tongue. But these are incidental. The very qualities which make poetry great are those which refuse to allow it to be identified with any source other than the uniquely personal and inimitable resourcefulness of the individ- ual poet. This is, presumably, what Heidegger means when he says: 'whenever art happens a thrust enters history. . .This is so because art is by nature an origin: a distinctive way in which truth comes into being, that is, be- comes historical'. 4 Where does this poetic word come from? The finished 'form' is filtered through con- sciousness, but this does not answer the quest- ion. Consciousness is the place where many forces and energies meet to emerge into the light of self-expression. The energy which generates the language of poetry could come from several sources. The act of creation in poetry is one which opens the poet to worlds beyond his conscious mind. The pre-logical and supra-logical language of poetry breathes a spirit whose origin is difficult to exhume. When we talk of 'the spirit of poetry' we enter very hazardous and uncharted territory. However, whatever may be understood by this concept seems essential to an understanding of at least three or four of the recent poetic geniuses of our race, and the ones most fre- quently called upon to establish the lineage of our Irish Literary Tradition. I am not making a definite statement of fact in this essay. I am suggesting a possibility which is supported by a number of striking examples. The possibility is that great poetry requires of the poet a quality of openness to a certain kind of spirit and that this openness can best be described as a kind of mysticism. Rather than make extrava- gant claims I shall just point to the existence of this 'hidden' tradition in our own cultural his- tory. A.E. is the easiest case to establish. His ex- plicit references to the 'Earth Spirit' and the overt mysticism of his Candle of Vision auto- 72</page><page sequence="3">matically assign him to this tradition. In the case of Synge I have already tried to show5. the 'mystical' sources of his inspiration and his debt to what he called 'the psychic memories attached to certain neighbourhoods' in the Aran Islands. One of the most obvious examples of a poet who belongs to this hidden tradition is Rainer Maria Rilke. However, my attempts to show some similarity of inspiration between him and James Joyce6 brought protests from some who thought that Joyce had absolutely no interest in mysticism and that 'the spirit of poetry' could not be 'a head of steam which can escape through several fissures - one being Joyce and the other Rilke'. The notion of the mystic element in poetry seems to be associated in many people's minds with uncontrollable slovenliness and lack of precision. This is a prejudice which Joyce himself was aware of and which he repudiated. In a lecture on Defoe and Blake, given in 1912, Joyce is reported as having said about Blake7 that "he was a mystic only insofar as he could be one and remain an artist: his mysticism was no swooning ecstacy like that of St John of the Cross, but a western mysticism filled with an 'innate sense of form and the coordinating power of the intellect' ". The poet translates from the order of events and experience to the order of expression and sig- nificance. The first step is taken by his gesture of self-expression. Here he is obeying aesthetic impulses which produce the definitive form. The reader of the poem is provided with an infallible statement. The structure is such an eloquent configuration that there are no spaces between words which would allow for decay. The poem carries whatever the poet has chis- elled it to say, regardless of fashion or of cult- ural prejudice. It does not depend for its in- tegrity or value upon the eye of the beholder, instead it draws its meaning, its truth and its beauty from its own internal relationships. The poem, then, is a use of words in what- ever way is necessary to convey the new kind of consciousness that the poet experiences. Hart Crane says that he attaches no intrinsic value to the means he uses 'beyond their practical service in giving form to the living stuff of the imagination'.8 So, in this sense there is no such thing as tradition or 'recog- nized technique' in poetry. To succeed is the only success for the poet no matter how he achieves it. 'It is part of a poet's business' Crane continues, 'to risk not only criticism - but folly - in the conquest of consciousness'. There are no limitations involved in the choice or invention of form, but once the form emerg- es it becomes the only and the exact measure of greatness in the poem. Greatness in poetry can only be measured in the work achieved; it cannot be awarded for good will or worthy intention on the part of the poet. It is a quality of the poem itself which 'approximates a formally convincing statement of a conception or apprehension of life that gains our unquest- ioning assent, and under the conditions of which our imagination is unable to suggest a further detail consistent with the design of the aesthetic whole'.9 To search for a form which will be 'interior' to the poem itself, adequate to it and to the inspiration, is the specific task of the poet. The specifically 'western' mysticism which Joyce ascribes to Blake is a combination of openness to every source of poetic inspiration and extreme sensitivity to the formal claims of poetic art. However, the order of events must not be reversed. The technical infallibility is a sign and an effect of the original inspirat- ion, it is in no way a cause of the inspiration and no amount of technical skill or study of technique can produce great poetry. The specific connection between 'greatness' and technique is further identified by Yeats in his essay on Blake's illustrations to Dante.10 Al- though Yeats is specifically referring to Blake his remarks are applied to 'every creator' and must, therefore, apply to his own poetry. Yeats is commenting on a letter in which Blake says: 'Excuse my enthusiasm, or rather madness, for I am really drunk with intellect- ual vision. .. even as I used to be in my youth'. Yeats proposes that: This letter may have been the expression of a moment's enthusiasm but was more probably rooted in one of those intuit- ions of coming technical power which every creator feels, and learns to rely upon; for all his greatest work was done, and the principles of his art were form- ulated, after this date. The mystical poet, in this 'western' tradition, is one who combines an openness to 73</page><page sequence="4">some overwhelming source of energy with the capacity to organize and control the power which surges through him. In fact, the myst- ical experience is often identified with the recognition of the precise technical power which will effectuate such exteriorization. The poetry must be judged according to formal standards. The movement from anarchical life experience to the structured concrete form of the poem is governed by the 'innate sense of form' and the 'coordinating power of the intellect'. And it is this 'technical power' of the poet, his capacity to encompass the energy which invades him without, as it were, spilling a drop or crushing a leaf, which will define the genius of his poetry as form. Form as the fruit or the culmination of the poetic effort should not aspire to be its root and source as well. This would be the danger of an age of poetry over-obsessed with the bien fait tradition. Although technique is the sine qua non of any poetry worthy of the name, it is not, nor can it replace, the essence of 'great' poetry. And, here, Yeats' warning to the readers of his day might be entirely appropriate to our time: 11 Living in a time when technique and imagination are continually perfect and complete, because they no longer strive to bring fire from heaven, we forget how imperfect and incomplete they were in even the greatest masters. . . for he who half lives in eternity endures a rending of the structures of the mind, a crucifixion of the intellectual body. The poets of this 'hidden' tradition have a double exigence to obey. Technical compet- ence can never make them adequate bearers of their own tradition. Form is not the only, nor is it the most important, constitutive elem- ent in this kind of poetry. The other is this elusive 'spirit of poetry' without which all technique is barren pedantry. So, what is this 'spirit of poetry', this neb- ulous source of poetic genius? Malraux, who was an indefatigable exponent of these matters, seems to propose that the Spirit of Art is a subterranean torrent of history, an invisible, unified and independent force which takes over the talent and sensitivity of the artist. Merleau-Ponty, on the other hand, finds this idea of history which works as it were, behind the poet's back and uses him as an instrument, a 'hegelian monstrosity'. He accepts the phenomenon but rejects this explanation. 'We must recognise that this miracle is natural to us and that there is no reason to look for its explanation in some Spirit of the World which allegedly operates within us without our knowledge. . .This Spirit of the world is ourselves'.12 Whether we take the view of Malraux that this spirit is something exterior to the poet which invades his being, or support the anthropomorphism of Merleau-Ponty who insists on finding the explanation of this mystery within the human dimension exclusively, it is difficult to clinch the issue one way or the other. What we do know is that great poetry sometimes emerges from a place within the poet, an area where experience merges with expression, consc- iousness with the sub-conscious, things thought by the brain with things felt in the blood. This 'place', called 'Eden's breathing garden' by Blake, is so patently an unfathomable confluence of untraceable sources that no one could claim to account for either their precise causality or their extent. It is as if our consc- ious world possessed only the stems with the flowers and had no way of examining the roots which lie below the surface of the garden. The poems themselves are like the obverse side of a tapestry whose threads may stretch in any direction and for any distance on the other side. Poetry of this kind would seem to sugg- est that the final skin of consciousness which defines and preserves the limits of the sub- jective self, is in fact porous and that energies other than the conscious self can avail them- selves of this porousness to breathe through to the conscious world. Some of our greatest poets seem to suggest that this openness does not simply extend to other regions of the sub- conscious within the poet's own being, but that it extends to a much vaster subconscious: that of the race or that of the world. When Synge, for instance, talks about 'a psychic memory attached to certain neigh- bourhoods' he is reiterating an ancient mythic belief. Fintan tells us that in 'the settling of the manor of Tara it is right to take the provinces of Ireland from Tara and from Uisneach,' two sites which are for Ireland like 'two kidneys in a beast'. 13 Whereas 74</page><page sequence="5">Tara was the seat of kingship and the pol- itical centre of Ireland, several considerations associate Uisneach with the druids and with the role of the poets. 14 The chief druid of the people of Nemed first lit the fire in this place and when the indigenous druids compl- ained they 'were marshalled into a house and their tongues were cut out. He then buried the tongues in the ground of Uisneach and sat upon them'.15 Although not the hydrographic centre of Ireland, Uisneach was a secret well which was the source of all the rivers of Ire- land. Above this well grew a hazel tree. The hazel nuts dropped into the well and were carried to the various arterial rivers through- out the country. These rivers represented the five senses and those who partook of the nuts therein were accorded the gifts of the seer and the poet.16 This myth is very close to the ideas expressed by Synge and A.E. in many accounts of their poetic inspiration. It is more suggestive than revealing. It points to some connection between the actual 'earth' of Ire- land and the particular person of individual poets, although it does not clarify the conn- ection. Whether this 'hidden' tradition of poetry is fed from sources inside or outside the poet, it does seem to be true that the 'tradition' dies with the death of each one of its poets. Between the source and the 'form' of this poetry is always the unique personality of the poet who has both the openness to the source and the imaginative daring which can appropriate the invading energy in an ad- equate form. This form may bear no resem- balance to any previous manifestation. And certainly no amount of imitation or study of culture could produce it. It seems to be the precise way in which the individual poet hypostatizes the breath of his poetry. It is as original and unrepeatable as a fingerprint. How do we find out if there are any rep- resentatives of this tradition in our own gener- ation? Is the yardstick to be the impact such a poet makes on his public? Not necessarily. His public may be waiting to be called into existence by his poems. His work may have to wait and appeal to the judgement of hist- ory: 17 The appeal to the judgement of history is not an appeal to the complacency of the public. It is inseparable from the inner certainty of having said what waited to be said. 'I shall be read in one hundred years,' Stendhal thinks. This means that he wants to be read, but also that he is willing to wait a century, and that his freedom invites a world as yet in limbo to become as free as he is by recognizing as acquired what he has had to invent. Is it necessary for long periods of history to elapse before the discovery of the artist can become the property of the people? Surely there must be some way of speeding up the process in our times of almost instantaneous communication of news and events. If such artists do exist in this country at the mom- ent they at least must be aware of it. Although the world has constantly neglected artists, it is rare that the artist has been unaware of himself. A certain justified self-confidence, what the Romans called hilaritas, is the normal temperamental safeguard of the poet's work and energy in the face of constant misunder- standing and disappointment. Of course, the artist can misjudge his own situation, but such delusions of grandeur should not be allowed to obliterate the very many clear cases where the artist was entirely correct in his assessment.
