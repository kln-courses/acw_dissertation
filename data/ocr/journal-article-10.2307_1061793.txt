<plain_text><page sequence="1">Herbert V. Guenther TANTRA AND REVELATION The knowledge of man is as the waters, some descending from above, and some springing from beneath; the one informed by the light of nature, the other inspired by divine revelation.- FRANCIS BACON, Advancement of Learning, Book I, Vol. I. The idea of revelation is found in every religion and has been interpreted in various ways. In the specific Christian conception it is the communication to man of the Divine Will. Here, in course of time, a distinction was made between a "natural" revelation (revelatio naturalis) and a "supernatural" one (revelatio supra- naturalis or divina). While the former was assumed to be a self- manifestation of the divine in man and nature and to be intelligible through man's natural gift of reason (lumen naturale), the latter was claimed to "transcend" or to be "outside" nature and human experience. Even if supernatural revelation occurred, it remained inaccessible to reason, whose function was merely to argue and to infer from the evidence of the senses. Reason therefore was contrasted with faith, which was supposed to show man many more of the effects of God.But in being thus contrasted with reason, faith itself suffered a degradation, ranging from the specific form of religious awareness to an excuse for believing anything it liked, and so remained on the level of a child's acceptance of the word of his parents or teachers whom he trusted. The growing rift between reason and faith led to the idea of a double truth, initially meant to further religion but which became a dogma for worldly philosophy (whatever this may have meant or still may mean) and the downfall of both reason and 279</page><page sequence="2">Tantra and Revelation faith. Still, faith is not necessarily an anti-intellectual feat. It goes beyond reason only in the sense that, being the work of the self, it is much bolder in its approach to a goal than is reason, whose scope is much broader than that of faith because its rules are universally applicable.' A further aspect of revelation is brought out in two opposing views about it or, more exactly, about what it does. The widely accepted one is stated by William Temple: "What is offered to man's apprehension in any specific Revelation is not truth con- cerning God, but the living God himself"; 2 "There is no such thing as revealed truth. There are truths of revelation, that is to say, propositions which express the results of correct thinking concern- ing revelation; but they are not themselves directly revealed."3 The other, which also claims a large following, is laid down in the Westminster Confession that "the Lord" was "pleased" "to com- mit . . . wholly unto writing" the declaration of His will and in Pope Leo XIII's encyclical, Providentissimus Deus, of 1893, that the Holy Scriptures were written at the dictation of the Holy Ghost (dictante Spiritu Sancto). Last, it is generally held that revelation comes in unusual ways, by means not open to the ordinary channels of investigation, and that as a result it yields knowledge which is not ordinarily avail- able. This view is easily shown to be fallacious, as it prejudges and restricts the scope of knowledge and the means of its attainment. From this short survey it is evident that revelation not only is a process but also has a content stirring man to response. Doubtless, there can be no response independent of the impingement of the divine presence in man's experience, but the ways in which man may respond to the divine call are many. It is true that there are people who do not care to listen and who shut themselves off from any communication, but there are others for whom communica- tion with the divine is or will be of pre-eminent importance. It is, however, doubtful whether the feeling of absolute dependence, which since the time of Schleiermacher has often been claimed to be characteristic of a religious attitude, can be considered com- munication, in the strict meaning of the word, with the divine. To be an abject slave to the Divine Will, to persevere in blind faith and unquestioning obedience, may be a necessary corollary to a 1 On the relation between faith and reason, see also Paul Weiss, Modes of Being (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1958), pp. 312-13. 2 William Temple, Nature, Man, and God (New York: Macmillan Co., 1934), p. 322. 3 Ibid., p. 317. 280</page><page sequence="3">supernatural revelation. But to the extent that supernatural re- velation attempts to enforce its authoritarian claim it destroys the individual and even morality, because it does not, and cannot, ad- mit of freedom, least of all of freedom of understanding, which is grounded in man's very act of existing and so makes morality possible. The rejection of supernatural revelation as a form of absolutism is therefore not a sign of irreligion; rather, it is the first step toward a recognition and, through it, a restoration of the dignity of the human individual, who, through his intellect, shares in the realm of the Ideal and is enabled to assent to the divine presence instead of merely submitting himself to it.4 Where there is the feeling of dependence, its absoluteness being the sign of some vested interest, not a characteristic, man's re- sponse to the divine is strongly marked by the observance of cer- tain rites. This ritual has grown out of the combination of a certain idea with actions appropriate to that idea and retains its character of service. To a certain degree, like magic, it attempts to in- fluence the deity by propitiating it. Yet ritual is more than this. Through it, man also tries to arrive at a new conception of himself as living in a world of law and order of divine origin. Inasmuch as ritual carries with it its own laws, it finally develops into religious ethics, which become as important for the relation between man and the divine as the ritual itself and which often supersede the latter. Ethical demeanor contains, in addition, an element of self- reflection which can be developed and transformed into meditation. Meditation is the cornerstone of mysticism, which is a distinct human reaction to the divine presence. Mysticism deliberately avoids all outward show, which it considers sham, because, in transfusing the whole life with religion, it cannot see a separate existence for worship and ritual. It attempts to establish an inti- mate union of man and God. In this union, however close it may be, the "terms" of the relation, man and God, may still be pre- sented as external to each other, so that the divine stands over and against man, not as something understood but as that which man is not. But if the divine is the absolute ground of man's being, then it may be doubted whether it can be said to be wholly other than 4 It will be obvious that here a clear distinction between "will" and "presence" is drawn. The former is a presumptuous, if not blasphemous, concept, as it merely absolutizes man's striving for power and prejudges divine frailties as being of the same kind as human ones but operating on a larger scale. "Presence" constitutes a value in interaction and thereby remains a living process and admits of indivi- dual growth and a broadening of intellectual perspective. 281</page><page sequence="4">Tantra and Revelation man. There is a point, then, when the relation takes to itself a new quality, which may be called oneness with the divine. These various ways of man's response to the divine presence characterize the classification of the Buddhist Tantras, as literary works or instruction manuals, into Kriya-, Carya-, Yoga-, and Anuttarayoga-Tantras. This classification shows clearly that, in the concrete life of religion, it is our attitude toward God that deter- mines what sort of God we take him to be. It also reveals the criti- cal attitude of Buddhism, which asks, not whether such a God as defined by our attitude toward him exists, but what God means; as a result of this investigation, Buddhism finds that God and man are abstractions from the same whole, which is the infinite fact of being, living in its entirety in each individual and his every act. This is also the meaning of "Tantra" (rgyud), which, apart from designating a certain type of written text, basically and technically is the term denoting the essential and absolutely individual nature of man as a constant possibility, not as something that can be re- duced to some entity or other. In this respect, whether he is or be- comes a Buddha or is and remains an "ordinary" being, man is his possibilities, in the light of which he has to decide what to become. Being his possibilities, man is "divine" and so contrasts with his drab concretizations and postulates.5 This transition from submission to understanding can be clearly seen from the account given by Mi-pham 'Jam-dbyangs rgya- mtsho: 6 This Mantra-Vajrayana, which is distinguished [from the other spiritual courses] by special properties, comprises four kinds of Tantra, each of which possesses most sublime qualities. They are known as Kriya-Tantra and so on and have been formulated in view of the four types of mankind, their various degrees of intelligence, the extent and character of their emotionality, and other features.7 I. In the Kriya-Tantra great stress is laid on the observance of outer ablutions, ritual purity, and other ritual actions by body and speech. The god (lha) who is the embodiment of a priori awareness (ye-shes)8 is 5 "Tantra," as a term for man's total being, is the thesis of Klong-chen rab- 'byams-pa, who discusses the multiple meanings of this term in detail in his Theg- pa'i mchog rin-po-che'i mdzod, fols. 60a-91a.

My use of the term "a priori" differs from the Kantian conception, as mine does not refer to judgments but to that cognitive event which is prior to judgments. 282</page><page sequence="5">considered to confer favors like a master, while the individual com- mitted to his service receives these benefits like a servant. It is claimed that thereby temporal and lasting realizations are achieved. Here, too, one distinguishes between (a) viewpoint, (b) creative imagination,9 (c) conduct, and (d) their fruition. (a) Although all phenomena are ultimately the same in their actuality, which is the indivisibility of the truths of appearance and nothingness, in our relative world the supreme divine being becomes the embodiment of an a priori awareness in which the radiancy of the evidence of being is directly present in its nature of being free from any defects and in being replete with all values in highest perfection. And so it is considered to be like a master because he confers temporal and lasting benefits on us who receive them like his servants. Since we are not yet perfect as re- gards our real being and are shrouded in the veils [of unknowing and emotional instability], we feel ourselves dependent upon God. There- fore, since ultimately our identity with and relatively our relation to [God] is incontestible, the viewpoint of the Kriya-Tantra is accom- panied by the firm belief that, through our perseverance in patterning ourselves after the god's form, speech, and mood, our temporal activities become significant and that ultimately the god's essence is realized by us. (b) Kriya is known as referring to six divine presences.10 This, in brief, means that we concern ourselves with such experiences as the visualiza- tion of the god's form, the hearing of his message, and the feeling of his mood as well as the manifestation of the god's palace and the emanation and reabsorption of light rays. We then create this mood again and again by repeating the god's specific mantra as if one's life were at stake, and so cause the god's sustaining power to descend upon us, just as if iron were touched by the philosopher's stone. (c) Inasmuch as the recitation of the mantra is effective in a ritual context, but otherwise remains barren like a seed without water and manure, we must exert ourselves in performing such ritual acts as taking a bath and changing our clothes thrice a day, worshiping and making offerings, as detailed in the Tantras. (d) By such efforts as temporal gifts, any of the ordinary attainments are won, such as the body of a Vidyadhara,11 who is equal in fortune with a god of a sensuous world, and as a lasting result the essence of a 9 sgom, Skt. bhdvana. The rNying-ma-pas interpret this term in two ways: One is the traditional way, corresponding to what is understood by "meditation" as fixing the mind on a certain topic. This conception is strongly criticized because it implies a "fixation," the denial of mind's spontaneity and freedom. The second way is precisely this spontaneous activity. As the working of the mind expresses itself in images, I have tried to indicate this aspect by the above translation of sgom (bhdvana) by "creative imagination." On the distinction between "fixation" (meditation) and "creative imagination," see the gZhan-'dod bsdus-pa'i bcud-phur in Bi-ma snying-tig, Vol. Ga, fols. 34a-36a. 10 lha drug-pa. The six "divine presences" are don-dam-stong-pa'i Iha (the ab- solute), sgra'i lha (its message), yi-ge'i Iha (its articulation), gzugs-kyi lha (its vision), phyag-rgya'i Iha (the meditator's empathy), and mtshan-ma'i Iha (the final embodiment). 11 rig-'dzin; literal., "he who holds to ('dzin) the intuitive, aesthetically moving awareness (rig-pa) of reality." 283</page><page sequence="6">Tantra and Revelation god of any of the three action patterns12 is realized within a period of sixteen human lives. II. In the Carya-Tantra, outwardly, ritual purity as effected by ablutions and other observances and, inwardly, creative imaginations are of equal importance. It is claimed that by viewing ourselves and God as being brothers or friends, realizations are won. Here too, there is the distinction between (a) viewpoint, (b) creative imagination, (c) conduct, and (d) their fruition. (a) Since here the conviction of the identity [of man with God] in the ultimate sense is still stronger than in the Kriya-Tantra, we and God are of equal status, like brothers or friends. Since temporal and lasting good is realized by reliance on God as he is envisaged as he really is when appearance as a concatenation of interdependent entities has sub- sided, the viewpoint of the Carya-Tantra is accompanied by belief in the profoundness of the two truths.13 (b) Creative imagination means that when we have clearly visualized the God as the embodiment of an a priori awareness in front of ourselves as the individual committed to his service and then repeat his mantra in a steady flow passing to and fro between ourselves and the God and his entourage, finally the God as the embodiment of a priori awareness will come near, and ultimately there is nothing left of logical fictions or propositions claiming truth. (c) This is to observe the various rites of ablution and ritual purity to the best of one's ability. (d) Temporarily, our activities become significant, and, finally, the level of Vajradharal4 of four action patterns15 is attained within a period of seven human lives. Further, one speaks of a "twofold Tantric spiritual course," because here, inwardly, creative imagination as in the Yoga-Tantra and, out- wardly, observances as in the Kriya-Tantra are equally distributed. Actually, however, the realization of our goal is quicker, because the viewpoint is profounder than in the previous Tantra. III. The Yoga-Tantra comprises two varieties: (A) an outward Yoga- Tantra and (B) an inner unsurpassable spiritual course. (A) While here ritual purity and other observances are merely con- sidered to be friends and helpers for the realization of the path, in- wardly concern with the working of the mind is stated to be of primary importance. It is claimed that realizations are attained through the con- templation of non-duality when by way of four "seals" (phyag-rgya) and five "intuitions" (mngon-par byang-chub) there has come about a fusion 12 rigs, Skt. kula. The three are: De-bzhin-gshegs-pa'i rigs, Padma'i rigs, and rDo-rje'i rigs. According to the Bla-ma yang-tig, Vol. V, fol. 3a, rigs is synonymous with snying-po (Skt. hrdaya, sdra) and, as a term for the core of man's being, varies in nature with each individual. See also the collected works of Klong-rdol bla-ma Ngag-dbang blo-bzang, Tibetan Buddhist Studies, ed. Ven. Dalama (Laxmanpuri, Mussoorie, 1963), I, 50-52. 13 I.e., appearance and nothingness. 14 rdo-rje 'dzin-pa as distinguished from rdo-rje-'chang. The former still implies separateness, the latter absolute self-sameness. 15 The three patterns as indicated in n. 12, to which is added the las-kyi rigs or rin-chen rigs. 284</page><page sequence="7">of subjectivity and objectivity, subjectivity being the individual trans- figured into a being committed to the service of the god and objectivity being the god as the embodiment of a priori awareness invited to come from his pure realms. Here, too, there is the division into (a) viewpoint, (b) creative imag- ination, (c) conduct, and (d) their fruition. (a) Since this view of the absolute is superior to that of the two pre- ceding Tantras, we know for certain that we are actually identical like water poured into water. When we concern ourselves with this, the view- point is accompanied by the special certainty of the realization of the essence of the god [of our choice] by means of assiduously enacting as the four "seals" [of our being] the god's nature of (i) existing, (ii) com- municating, (iii) thinking, and (iv) acting, since all phenomena are manifestations of the working of a mind. This deep absorption em- powers us to feel that we are the god whom we have visualized. (b) Creative imagination is to "seal" our three action levels [i.e., body, speech, and thought] and their operations as the expression of the god's acts of existing, communicating, knowing, and acting with the four seals of (i) mahamudrd, representing the act of existing, (ii) dharma- mudrd, being the act of communicating, (iii) samayamudrd, being that of thinking, and (iv) karmamudrd, being our activity as it expresses itself through the emanation and reabsorption of light rays. We perform this act of sealing after we have taken refuge [in the Three Jewels], developed an enlightened attitude and effected out of a sphere of nothingness a transfiguration by means of five "intuitions." These are (i) the intuition of a lotus and a moon, forming a throne, being the cause factor of the existence of divine realms and habitats; (ii) that of letters as the ele- ments of communication being the cause factor of the most sublime message; (iii) that of a mood as the cause factor of a temporality which cannot be defined conceptually, but is eternally present; (iv) that of perfected form-endowed existence in and with an entourage, being the cause factor of the sublime teacher and his followers; and (v) that of the god as embodied a priori awareness, being the cause factor of the very fact of existing or of most exalted awareness. Even in this ritual activity we resort to deep absorption until the desired realization has been won through mastery and proficiency. (c) Although ritual purity and other observances are practiced from time to time in the proper way, it is through attending to the ex- perience of the inner processes of contemplation and imagination that our activities become more harmonious and steady than they were in practicing the previous forms of Tantra. (d) While for a time the qualities of our experience and understanding improve more and more, finally, within a period of three human lives, the five psychophysical constituents, the five senses, and the five emotive reaction patterns become purified and are turned into the Buddha nature of five Buddha action patterns representing five forms of a priori awareness.16 These three Tantras in their totality conceive of the two truths (of 16 ddarsajinana, samatdjinna, pratyavekEanadjnna, krtydnu.sthdnajndna, dhar- matajidna. 285</page><page sequence="8">Tantra and Revelation appearance and nothingness) as alternations. They insist, however, on the importance of contemplating the ultimate as beyond judgments and propositions when all objective reference has been lost after the re- lative world of common appearance has been imagined as divine and when afterward the appearance of it as God has been dissolved in itself. (B) Concerning the unsurpassable spiritual course we must first of all know the difference between an outer and inner aspect relating to the triple division into (i) starting point, (ii) path, and (iii) goal. (i) The outer aspect is present when, at the time of the maturing ini- tiations the "jar-consecration" is of primary importance; the inner one is given when the three higher consecrations figure more prominently.l7 (ii) When creative imagination proceeds in such a way that the De- veloping and Fulfilment Stages 8 form a unity and not an alternation because the symbol character and the self-same absoluteness of reality are envisaged as not implying any acceptance or rejection, the inner aspect is given. If this is not possible, the outer aspect prevails. As a consequence, when conduct is based on acceptance and rejection con- cerning the ritual purity in place, food, dress, and so on, the outer aspect obtains; when there is equality, the inner one. (iii) Freedom related to a particular time means that the inner aspect obtains when Buddhahood is realized in this life, the outer one when in a future life. The general idea underlying the inner aspect of these great Yoga dis- ciplines of the special Tantra is as follows: the totality of reality sub- sumed under samsdra and Nirvana or appearance and possibility resides in utter absoluteness. Here, "profoundness" is the purity [of all reality] in having the same value regarding its status of the "great mean" (dbu-ma chen-po)19 devoid of all judgments and propositions moving within four confines. "Vastness" is its contemplation in the knowledge of the identity of appearance-that is, the psychophysical constituents, the biotic forces, and sense fields-with the great pure mandala, the five action patterns of Buddhahood, and other features pertaining to it. And so whatever appears need not be rejected, but as a most excellent means that is free in itself, it is turned into a helper for traversing and scaling the paths and levels of spirituality. When in all our actions the unity of "vastness" as the Developing Stage and "profoundness" as the Fulfilment Stage, which is a unity that from its very beginning has never been joined or separated, is felt as the great absolute a priori awareness in which the two truths [of appearance and nothingness] are indivisible, the highest realization of mahdmudrd, integration, or the citadel of Rdo-rje-'chang is reached. These ways in which man reacts to the divine impingement point 17 On these consecrations (confirmation-empowerments), see in particular my The Life and Teaching of Ndropa (Oxford, 1963), pp. 143-45. is See ibid., pp. 138-41. 19 The term dbu-ma, Skt. madhyama, usually translated "middle," actually con- notes "central" or "related to the center." The qualifying adjectives chen-po, Skt. mahant, lit. "great," indicates the absoluteness of the center. This center is the support and point of reference of the whole of nature. In actual life, it is the supreme motivating idea. 286</page><page sequence="9">to an important character of revelation. Its experience may be in- terpreted as coming from without (being exogenous), or it may be felt as coming from within (being endogenous). This distinction, which is not wholly absent in Christianity, has been clearly stated in Buddhist Tantrism. However, even in its exogenous character, revelation is never absolutistic-supernatural; it always retains its nature of being intelligible to the individual to whom it manifests. Where revelation is regarded as deriving from a source outside our- selves, it addresses itself to those who have not yet ventured beyond the ordinary world of subject and object as two self- contained entities, but where revelation is thought to come from within, it becomes the impetus to self-development, which is an awakening to Buddhahood and commonly described as enlighten- ment. Regardless of whether revelation is claimed to come from with- out or within, it never occurs in a vacuum. It comprises (1) the "place" where it occurs, (2) the revealing power, (3) the recipient, (4) the subject matter, and (5) the occasion of the revelation. "When place, revealer, assemblage, content, and occasion unite, the religious life begins." 20 Inasmuch as Buddhism has always stressed the inner life of the spirit, it is only natural that the inner character of revelation should rank foremost and that even the outward one shines in the light of the former. The primary question has not been whether revelation is this or that kind of information but whether it is any kind at all. This again has been bound up with the double question of fact and expression, and with reference to this question the various features of revelation have been discussed in the texts. Certainly, there is something there before it becomes expressed, and as it is expressed, it is created. Insofar as it has been created, it can be said to exist. In this way, fact and expression, existence and creation, are correlatives and have meaning only in the frame- work of imaginative activity productive of results under the agent's control. It is important to understand "imaginative activity" and "agent" correctly and not to misjudge the former as being merely the capacity to redistribute and rearrange materials supplied to it by perception. Nor should we confuse the latter with a solipsistic or pantheistic postulate which in either case overlooks the concrete 20 Kun-tu-bzang-po'i dgongs-pa zang-thal-las/Bi-ma-mi-tra'i snyan-brgyud chen. mo rgyal-po-la gdams-pa yang-gsang bla-na-med-pa rdzogs-pa chen-po'i 'grel-pa yes- shes rang-gsal, fol. 3b. (In the following, the title of this text will be given in the abbreviated form dGongs-pa zang-thal.) 287</page><page sequence="10">Tantra and Revelation reality, the absolute fact of the imaginative activity living in its entirety in every individual and every act of his, expressing itself uniquely. This means that the imaginative activity is not of some agent but the agent as he expresses himself. The absolute fact of imaginative activity always refers to a situation of a definite kind, although nobody can say what kind of situation it is until it has become expressed and thereby made clear to him who has had the feeling of there being something. Secondarily, the situation becomes clear to anyone who can un- derstand, and, as the case may be, it is then capable of arousing in him a desire to find a "way" to feel like the person or divine being who addresses him. Actually, in Tantrism, as the above analysis of man's reaction to the divine impingement has shown, man is one with God, informed throughout by the indwelling of the divine spirit. Only someone who suffers from theophobia because he con- fuses an abstract concept with the concrete reality can object to the use of the term "God" in connection with Tantrism, which by dealing with the whole of man's life is both religion and philosophy, the one relating to the life of the soul, the other to that of the mind.21 Not only does the absolute fact of imaginative activity refer to a situation, but wherever it moves it never finds anything that is not a fact, individual and unique. So also it reveals nothing that is not a fact. That is to say, in the act of revelation the imaginative activity creates itself in a perpetual discovery of fact and com- municates this fact of its being to its environment of fact. Technic- ally this is known as "self-knowledge" (rang-rig), and what is to be understood by this term has been a problem for various philo- sophies both in the West and in the East. In Tantrism self- knowledge does not mean the mind's static contemplation of its own given nature but the mind's creation of itself by knowing itself to know and, in so doing, also to know the world which it reveals and, in this revelation, creates. This absolute fact of imaginative activity which creates and re- veals itself in a total situation of fact and so communicates itself to that which as part of this whole partakes of the nature of fact is not a process in time as a revelatory act. If it were this, time would appear to be something external to the absolute whole. Rather, the absolute whole is time itself which later on, by the working of the 21 Of course, the term "God" is highly ambiguous, and quite a number of people equate God with their idiosyncrasies. There is no reason why this term, having re- ligious significance, should not be retrieved from its abuses by popular superstition. 288</page><page sequence="11">intellect whose function it is to apprehend or construct relations, is split up into the correlatives of temporality and eternity. As such an absolute whole, the factual character of revelation is described in the Tantric texts as follows: The absolute "place" is the concrete universal, innocent of all logical judgments and assertions, not existing as this or that [abstract particu- lar], and inaccessible to the elements of language, words, and syllables. The concretely existing revealing agent has neither face nor hands, because no such assertion can be made as no words, which are the basis of all assertion, are available. The absolute environment for such a revealing agent is the play of the concrete universal, self-created and self-manifesting. The absolute message to such an environment is self-knowledge. Al- though it has come into existence it has done so by itself, and although it arises it does so by itself; it has not been created by causes and con- ditions [external to it], and it has no beginning or end. Although it is there encompassing everything, nothing can fathom it. In this concrete fact of being, the unity of place, revealing agent, en- vironment, and message is absolute time, having neither beginning nor end.22 Fact and expression, which is primarily imaginative activity, are correlative, or, as R. G. Collingwood states it, Imagination does not exist in the free state, and itself requires a basis of fact. This basis of fact in turn requires a basis of imagination, for no fact can be known until it has been sought by the imaginative act of questioning, and this question itself requires a further basis of fact, and so ad infinitum. This is not an infinite regress only because the two moments, question and answer, are not actually separate. Their dis- tinction is an ideal distinction only, and the presupposition of each by the other is only a way of stating their inseparability.23 Now, inseparability is the key word of Tantrism: inseparability of the absolute and relative, of the divine and the human, and, by im- plication, of fact and expression. The fact of absolute knowledge is expressed through its act of imagination, which ultimately remains self-knowledge; this self-knowledge, as we have seen, never means that there is a self in abstract isolation becoming the ostensible object of this knowledge but that it is the knowledge of a knowing mind by itself. In its act of expression, it effects the concrete act of knowing and through it the refutation of its ostensible content. And so the expression of the fact of knowledge (mind, imaginative activity, aesthetic awareness, or whichever term we may use to refer to fact and expression) is described in this way: 24 22 dGongs-pa zang-thal, fol. 7a. 23 R. G. Collingwood, Speculum mentis (Oxford, 1924), p. 80. 24 dGongs-pa zang-thal, fol. 8a. 289</page><page sequence="12">Tantra and Revelation The absolute "place" is the citadel "Precious Mind," the focal point of experiences in which the structural pathways [of possible experiences] gather, in the mandala of our body. Being a "place" it is the birthplace of all virtues, and being "absolute" it must be considered as the exist- ence of infinite acts of existing and of being aesthetically aware by this body of unique fortune and purity. [This intuition] liberates the body's material form from its bondage by atoms.25 This, then, is the essence of the "great-perfection doctrine" going beyond all strained endeavors so that by knowing one's body as a "place" judgments and assertions as to it being something else are abolished. The absolute revealer in such a "place" is Samantabhadra, all en- compassing, self-existing, the royal self-knowledge. Being "a revealer" he is the quintessence of perceptivity knowing the whole of samsdra and Nirvana, and being "absolute" he is knowledge manifesting itself in- cessantly in various contents. Since this knowledge stands in utter free- dom over the variety of contents, our consciousness is liberated from its fetters of [believing in the irreconcilable dualism of] a knowing subject and a known object. This, then, is the essence of the "great-perfection doctrine" going beyond all strained efforts so that such a revealing power manifests itself by itself. What is the message transmitted to such an environment? It is the bliss of undivided knowledge resting on [the imaginary world of] path- ways (rtsa), motility (rlung), and creativity (thig-le).26 Being a "mes- sage" it is by virtue of it that there is the awakening to Buddhahood, and being "absolute" it brings the virtues of Buddhahood to utter per- fection by making a vivid experience of anything that man encounters. It liberates our feeling from its fetters of pleasure and pain. This, then, is the essence of the "great-perfection doctrine" going beyond all strained efforts so that this message [of bliss] exists by itself in itself. Since in this way "place" or our body, "revealing power" or our capacity of aesthetic awareness, "environment" or our acts of existing and of being aesthetically perceptive, and "message" or the instruction in the formative means of pathways, motility, and creativity are united in our body this very moment, the realization of Buddhahood becomes a necessity. If this goal of Buddhahood is not attained, it is necessary to practice austerities. What is meant by "absoluteness"? The true message, the realm of the specific revealing power, and ourselves as pertaining to a Buddha pattern of action in accordance with our karmic buildup. Moreover, "absoluteness" is given when interest and devotion concerning the un- surpassable path of mysticism unite. Since [in such a case] there is no obstacle to enlightenment, our volitions, motives, and drives are freed from the shackles of karmic activity, emotive reaction patterns, and their various emotively toned responses. Since in this way our mind in its absolute originality has turned out to be the very fact of being, its place and all that relates to it need not be sought elsewhere. This is known as the self-existing aesthetic perceptivity. 25 In other words, the body is experienced as a Gestalt, not as a postulate. 26 On the meaning of these terms, see Guenther, op. cit., p. 46, n. 1; pp. 270-72, 273-74. 290</page><page sequence="13">Apart from describing how the "fact" of knowledge "expresses" itself and, when it is so seen as expression, constitutes the character of revelation from outside, this account also points to the task of man: to find a way out of the maze of his ideas about himself inso- far as they have been judged, falsely, to be real. In psychological and philosophical language which is more akin to the original texts, this means to correct the mind's error about itself so that it can re- gain its true nature of aesthetic perceptivity. As a distinct form of experience, aesthetic perceptivity refers to and constitutes a whole beyond which there is nothing and in which there is no part that does not refer to or contain the whole. Inasmuch as it is within this whole that experience takes place, this whole may rightly be said to be a "place" and "absolute" in the sense that there is nothing besides it. This implies that "place" is not a certain place of a cer- tain thing but this thing itself, which is technically referred to by the expression "concrete universal" (chos-nyid).27 As such, the concrete universal is the unity of the universal and the particular before these two are separated into contrasting principles and as mere abstractions, by the intellect become metaphysical fictions. The concreteness of the whole means that it cannot be viewed as a mere object. It is subject and object together, the subject being a constitutive element in the object, as there would be no object unless there is a subject to know it. The character of the whole as an object is not the abstract objectivity of a world in which the knowing subject has no place but the concrete objectivity which is the correlative of subjectivity. This is clearly stated by Mi-pham 'Jam-dbyangs rgya-mtsho: 8 The ground [of all being] insofar as no assertions and judgments about it obtain, is purely transcendent (ka-dag); insofar as it is self- lucent, formless, and impartial, without, however, being a mere nothing 27 This term was first coined by Collingwood. The Tibetan term chos-nyid is the translation and interpretation of Skt. dharmatd. The suffix -td in Sanskrit forms "abstracts" and corresponds to the English -ness. Due to the influence of Greek thought, we tend to distinguish between horseness and horse, and Western philo- sophies have set up ingenious systems to unite the concrete and the universal. Similar interpretations are found in Hindu systems and Buddhism, if we interpret the latter in terms of the former. Since the Buddhist tradition in India has been dead for nearly a thousand years, while Hindu ideas have continued, it is extremely doubtful whether the rendering of Buddhist technical terms and ideas by Hindu connotations is justifiable. The Tibetans who translated when the Buddhist tradi- tion was still alive may have given a translation which is more to the point and reflects the Buddhist spirit. According to this tradition, then, the "horseness" is not of the "horse" but the horse which is "horsy" in relation to other things, which then are technically termed chos-can (Skt. dharmin). 28 Mi-pham 'Jam-dbyangs rgya-mtsho, Gnyug-sems 'od-gsal-gyi don rgyal-ba rig- 'dzin brgyud-pa'i lung-bzhin brjod-pa rdo-rje-syning-po (Varanasi, n.d.), fol. 3a. 291</page><page sequence="14">Tantra and Revelation like empty space, it is immanently spontaneous (Ihun-gyis grub-pa), and since it is the birthplace of all presential values such as Nirvana and sansdra, it is called all-encompassing compassion (thugs-rje).29 In the language of the "great-perfection doctrine" it is termed "that which possesses the three kinds of perceptivity abiding in the prime ground" (gzhir gnas-lkyi ye-shes gsum Idan). Similarly, in the Sitras and Tantras it is spoken of as "evidence of being" (dbyings) and "nothingness" (stong-pa-nyid) insofar as no assertions and judgments whatsoever and no defining characteristics obtain; and as "self-existing a priori per- ceptivity" (rang-byung ye-shes) insofar as it is shining in its own light. The conception of such an "object" is the conception of its objectivity determined by knowing the object, and whether it is known truly or erroneously must make a difference to it. This is to say, while the "object" is the knowing mind itself, the mind's error about itself must distort the object or, what is the same, itself. Such error is, according to the Bi-ma snying-tig, similar to mistak- ing the reflection of one's face in a mirror for an alien face, and so one "strays from true existence (sku) into organismic being (lus), from the evidence of being (dbyings) into [abstract] objectivity (yul), and from aesthetic awareness (rig-pa) into mentation (sems)." 30 In the concrete world of human thought, the "fact" of a "place" of knowledge and experience as the "concrete universal," resting in itself, revealing itself to itself and by itself, becomes our own body experienced as a Gestalt (gzugs), not as an assemblage of atoms which are its "misplaced" concretizations. Similarly, the fact of knowledge as the mind's knowledge about itself becomes our own consciousness (rnam-shes) in its absolutely fundamental and original activity before it becomes involved in its own ab- stractions of an object alien to and contrasted with a subject. How- ever, consciousness never exists in a vacuum and can never attend 29 thugs-rje ordinarily represents Skt. karuna when it is used with reference to Buddahood. Otherwise, Skt. karuna is in Tibetan snying-rje. In rNying-ma-pa texts, the use of thugs-rje rarely corresponds to our concept of "compassion," which closely resembles an emotion. thugs-rje is basic to rig-pa (aesthetic aware- ness), which seems to be its derivation. Inasmuch as rNying-ma-pa thought origin- ated when Chinese thought seems to have been well known, it is very likely that thugs-rje combines both the Indian idea of "compassion" and the Chinese Taoist conception of "responsiveness" (kan ). Chinese influence on early Tibetan ideas is not to be ruled out, and the rNying-ma-pa triad of ngo-bo, rang-bzhin, thugs-rje has a close resemblance in usage to the Chinese t'i rll , tzu-jan j or yung )J, the first term dealing with ontology, the second with actuality, and the last with cognitiveness. 30 Bi-ma snying-tig, Vol. Nya, fols. 2a-b. 292</page><page sequence="15">to more than a part of a total sensuous-emotional field. Therefore, it works in company with imagination ('du-shes) as an idea- forming process whose function it prepares in the sense that, if it is not warped by an error about itself in imagination, we experience ourselves as existing and as knowing rather than as things that may be classified as constituting an "outer" or "inner" world. It is customary to contrast thinking, which we associate with con- sciousness, with feeling, and to a certain extent this distinction is correct. But in the absolute whole where mind is its own object and where the subject is also object, being the one because it is the other, thought is feeling and feeling is thought, their differences being held together by an intrinsic unity. What the mind knows, and that with which it transfuses the whole of its being, is feeling (tshor-ba). It is described as undivided bliss because the wound of separateness from the whole has been healed and the petty feelings of pleasure and pain have been overcome. Although bliss is thus the subject matter of knowledge, the maxim "don't think, feel" does not apply, because it is the denial of knowledge and through it the denial of itself. Lastly, if knowledge is the life of the mind, its activity ('du-byed) is the actualization of Buddhahood, not an in volvement in actions and emotional outbursts that tend to harden the mind's error about itself. The realization of Buddhahood as man's unique task and goal thus turns out to be the total life of self-conscious development. As this process unfolds, be it gradually or instantaneously, the mind comes to know itself through its imagery, which it recognizes as its own creation and which it needs for arriving at its fore- ordained and pre-existing goal-knowledge. This goal is described as follows: "The absolute place is the evidence of being; the reveal- ing power is omniscient Buddahood, its essence, perceptivity grown into self-knowledge; the environment is enjoyment in the intellectually inconceivable play of existing and knowing; the message is unfailing great bliss; and time is the presence of com- prehending [a world of fact]." 31 Inasmuch as knowledge "reveals" the world in which it lives as its environment and which it discovers and creates by its act of self-creation, and inasmuch as this perpetual process of becoming self-conscious occurs here and now "within" us and so is endo- genous to itself, it is justifiable to speak of revelation from within. It will have been noted, however, that such revelation belongs 31 dGongs-pa zang thal, fol. 7b. 293</page><page sequence="16">Tantra and Revelation more properly to the level of philosophy as a continual quest for knowledge and not to that of religion proper. But the transition from philosophy to religion or vice versa is never abrupt. This is so because both participate in the same world of fact, which it is impossible to reduce to narrowly confined, mutually exclusive areas. Therefore, philosophical and religious elements also interpenetrate in Tantrism, which deals with the whole of man, the word "Tantra" itself being a term for man's total life. It is precisely in the religious sphere and, closely allied to it, in that of art that the sensuous and imaginary elements pre- dominate, and it is here that we feel ourselves to be on more familiar ground. And so the texts also speak of this sphere as of a "common" one pointing through its imagery to that which, as it were, lies behind it and yet imbues it with life; as Collingwood writes: If the mind feels cold without an object other than itself, nothing is simpler for it than to create a palace of art, a world of mythology, a cosmos of abstract conceptual machinery, and so forth. In fact that is precisely what it does when it cannot achieve what it really wants- self-knowledge-without the help of these things. But it is not these things that it wants: it is self-knowledge. For when it has its works of art, what it values in them is not themselves but the glimpses they give of hidden and mysterious beauty. What it worships in the figures of its gods is not these figures themselves in their externality to itself but the revelation through them of something really divine; and so on.32 The rich imagery of the spheres of religion and art is linked with the idea of the Buddha's three kdyas: dharmakdya, sambhogakdya, and nirmdnakdya. Rather than give a mere dictionary translation of these terms, which is bound to be meaningless if not utterly non- sensical, it is preferable to retain them as shorthand expressions for complex ideas which can be paraphrased but not "translated." Moreover, the Sanskrit term kdya is ambiguous, as it may mean what we ordinarily understand by the English word "body." The Tibetan language steers clear of the ambiguity by having two terms, sku and lus, whose distinct uses cannot create any uncer- tainty or misunderstanding. It so happens that, while it is true that the Tibetan texts have been translated from Sanskrit works and that on the basis of these translations there developed an im- mensely valuable indigenous literature, it is from the Tibetan texts that the Sanskrit terms become intelligible. Accordingly, the kdyas are structures of experience. Although 32 Collingwood, op. cit., pp. 281 ff. 294</page><page sequence="17">experience is an indivisible absolute whole, three aspects can always be distinguished: a factual, an immediate-intuitive, and a mediating-reflective one. There is, further, a certain interconnec- tion running through these aspects, so that each seemingly succes- sive one is more explicit than the preceding one. As "structures," these kdyas are present to man in an intuitive or immediate form, while as "contents" they are so deeply embedded in his "body" that it is impossible to extricate them. It is here that the distinc- tion between sku ("structure") and lus ("body") becomes most ex- plicit, but, before proceeding with our analysis, the notion of "body" must be clarified. When we speak of a "body" we usually tend to contrast it with a "mind" which is connected with it in a peculiarly intimate way and animates it. In this view the distinction between body and mind, both of which fall within one and the same whole, the con- crete, though infinite, fact of absolute mind, on closer inspection turns out to be an abstraction from absolute mind which has been regarded as a thing in itself so that "body" and "mind" became irreconcilable entities. But inasmuch as "mind," as ordinarily un- derstood on the basis of the mind's abstracting capacity, is merely such an abstraction, there is nothing mental or material about it; in the same way, our "body," as commonly understood, is neither the one nor the other, whereby the claims about body and mind by either idealism or realism are implicitly refuted. This is an im- portant point that has to be borne in mind constantly, because, in spite of the emphasis on mind in the Buddhist texts, "body" and "mind" cannot be interpreted in terms of realism or idealism with- out qualification. Being abstractions, they are not mere non- entities; they are the mind's ostensible objects which it believes, erroneously, to be real. However, these ostensible objects are not the real object of which the mind has been in search, which is the mind itself, hidden, as it were, behind its ostensible objects. Every ostensible object or abstraction is the mind's error about itself. But no error is complete; it implicitly contains truth. This is be- cause the mind's own nature and state is one of truth, from which it has strayed in its search for itself. Error, therefore, contains truth positively as a warning signal to turn back from a further ad- vance in the direction of error. Because of the truth in error, a mind which is in error can discover that it is so. Through this dis- covery it conquers error and reaches truth, that is, it comes to itself. Each truth, however, then takes the form which it does to conquer a particular error. This gradation in overcoming error we 295</page><page sequence="18">Tantra and Revelation can realize from comparing the definitions of sku and lus, of which the dictionaries say that both mean "body," and also from the re- lation these two have to each other, comparable to that of "struc- ture" and "content" or "truth" and "error." The word sku, which is found as the Tibetan rendering of the Sanskrit word kdya in the triad of dharmakdya (chos-(kyi) sku), sambhogakdya (longs-(spyod-rdzogs-pa'i) sku), and nirmdnakdya (sprul-(pa'i) sku), is explained as follows: chos means generality and specificity; kyi their connection; and sku is a pattern of preciousness mysteriously hidden (rin-po-che gsang-ba'i sbubs-kyi sku). [In particular,] chos-sku (dharmakdya) is anactuality which is absolutely nothing as such. longs-sku is the enjoyment of the abundance offered through the five kinds of aesthetic awareness (longs ... spyod); rdzogs is the perfection of symbols and signs; and sku is a pattern of knowledge and vision (ye- shes sgyu-ma'i sku). sprul-sku refers to the different shapes of beings who come into existence by four modes of birth, and it manifests itself (sprul) in order to educate any being of the six classes of beings; sku is a pattern under- lying [the beings] against themselves due to inveterate tendencies (rnam-rtog bag-chags-kyi sku).33 That which is called lus and which is commonly translated as "body," although more exactly it means "body-mind," "the body as lived in by the mind," is defined and termed so because it roams about, is set aside, left behind, or does not remain the same. It is by leaving one body behind and migrating to another one that we speak of "body," and this is because with reference to any body we know that the present body is not our previous one which has been left behind together with its atomic and elementary constituents and because in future also we will take on a new body different from the present one, if we do not know what the body really is. It has four varieties: (i) a precious and mysterious body (rin-po-che gsang-ba'i lus) in which dharmakdya, sambhogakdya, and nirmdnakdya gather; (ii) a body having the character of a priori knowledge and of being an appari- tion (ye-shes sgyu-ma'i lus) which exists with reference to the sambho- gakdya; or the precious one is dharmakdya and the one of a priori knowledge and apparition is the two form-endowed patterns of being; (iii) a body representing [any being's] dividedness against himself due to inveterate tendencies (rnam-rtog bag-chags-kyi lus) which exists in cer- tain formless spheres and when all mental activity has been [temporarily suspended].34 The Tibetan terms of the first three "bodies" are particularly significant, because, except for the substitution of lus for sku, they 33 Bi-ma snying-tig, Vol. Nga, fol. 72a. 34 Ibid., Vol. Nya, fols. 53b if. 296</page><page sequence="19">use the same words as in the preceding quotation. This shows that sku and lus are correlative aspects of experience in which im- mediacy or intuition, and mediation or reflection, and assertion in- termingle. This is what has been described above as the structure lying so imbedded in the content that to extricate it is impossible. Ordinarily, however, we are unaware of such imbedded structure until, in collaboration with a guru, the disciple brings it to light. And this happens on what is termed "the path." That which we call our "body," and of which we may say that it is our "mind," insofar as our body, B, animated by our mind, M, behaves in a certain way characteristic of B being animated by M, is something through which we experience ourselves as existing on various levels, physical, mental, factual. However, in the act of experience, we see ourselves and others as a Gestalt which we sub- sequently interpret and assert to be either physical or mental or "existential." Thus, experience is both imagination and assertion, and, while the former is neither true nor false of set purpose and is essentially a non-assertive attitude of discovery and exploration, the latter is something dead and done with and constitutes "error" when it is considered to be the whole of knowledge. But since error is never complete it becomes a challenge because of the truth residing in it. The moment the challenge is understood, the "path" from error to truth, from assertion to imagination, from content to structure, is traveled. The imagery of the path, how- ever, in the sense that the images are the path, points beyond itself to the underlying absolute reality. The relation between sku ("structure") and lus ("body") in con- nection with the "path" is as follows: "Structure" (sku) is defined as "in [or with reference to] the body" (lus-la). That is to say, we have to do with the body until structure has been realized and this means that the path starts with the body and must be traversed [by separating the impure from the pure], which again means that the goal does not exist as the body. Although this is so, it is sometimes claimed that the goal can be realized immedi- ately without the path being necessary. This, of course, is nonsense, for it is like expecting to possess the goal without preparing for it or with- out traveling toward it. Besides, the statement in the Guhyamantra texts that the goal must by all means be made the path [of goal re- alization] is with reference to the three patterns of being (sku) becoming the path. If something that is not these three patterns were to be made the path, the statement would be proven to be false, and the fallacy of seeking something unreal by something real would have come up. Therefore, if all the Tantras and instructions of the Guhyamantra de- clare the three patterns of being and the five kinds of perceptivity to be 297</page><page sequence="20">Tantra and Revelation the goal, here [in the "great-perfection doctrine"] they are made the path. How to do it has been explained previously. Further, any given form of a body (lus-yod) is not what we understand by structure. There are the bodies of flesh and blood, the product of the five elements (as in the case of men and animals), of knowledge and brilliance (as with the gods), of a numbed mind (as in the intermediate state between death and rebirth), of fancies (as with the spirits), and of massive error (as in the case of the denizens of hell). "Structure" is spoken of with reference to the body and other features of the six different classes of beings. That is to say, nirmdnakdya is a pattern that is not fixed once for all but corresponds to each of the six kinds of sentient beings and takes on the form of the body which a sentient being believes to be his real body on the level of his being divided against him- self and his real nature due to inveterate tendencies (rnam-rtog bag- chags-kyi lus-yod). Sambhogakdya is the body of a priori knowledge and apparition as it is found in a vision (ye-shes sgyu-ma'i lus snang-ngo-la grub-par yod). Dharmakdya is a form of a precious and mysterious body (rin-po-che gsang-ba'i lus-yod) because it fulfils the beings' spiritual aims by the two form patterns that have come from it. Since in this way the three patterns of being (sku) are the images of the path, ultimately, when the goal has been reached, they do not ob- tain. If it is argued that then the continuity of spiritual awareness has come to an end, the answer will be that it is not so. Although active spiritual reality (mdzad-pa) is not a mind in the ordinary sense of the word (yul-can), its spirituality or compassion, unceasing in its power, like the rays of the sun once it has risen, watches over sentient beings with the eyes of omniscience never falling asleep and is present in aiding them. Just as ice and snow melt and flow in abundance when the heat of the summer increases, so the great sustaining power of Buddhahood in sentient beings has grown by itself, and therefore one must know that all the happiness of all sentient beings is the spirituality and compassion of Buddahood.35 From this it follows that dharmakdya is the hidden source of man's being, and insofar as he feels this source to be there, it is a value which no words can comprise, but when he concretizes it and asserts it to be, the life-spending source dries up and becomes a dead counter; there is lus ("body") instead of sku ("structure") or "organismic being" instead of "true existence." So, also, sambho- gakdya is a structure of sensuous elements of imagery which are felt to give knowledge and in the contemplation of which we feel to have come nearer to knowledge. But here, too, assertion turns the vision into dogma and the inspiring images into aesthetic idols. Lastly, nirmdnakdya, which as human beings we conceive in human form, is essentially a unifying symbol which challenges us to overcome our dividedness against ourselves and to find our- 35 Ibid., Vol. Nga, fols. 79a ff. 298</page><page sequence="21">selves in the life of absolute mind. Each living being participates in and lives through these three patterns of being, but those who do not know that they are doing so give a false account to them- selves of their experiences and turn them into "error." Although corresponding to the various levels of man's being, these patterns of being are in a certain way the self-portraiture of the path which always means spiritual development. As such they produce a powerful and very peculiar emotional effect which is felt to come from outside. In this context it is possible to speak of re- velation from without, where each pattern appears in a special world of its own, which is woven into the whole. This revelation from without is described in the following words: 36 The teaching is the word of the teacher who embodies the three patterns of being: as dharmakdya he speaks by way of his sustaining power;37 as sambhogakdya by means of his very fact of being; and as nirmdnakdya in well-articulated words comprising the sixty kinds of modulation. The "place" of the dharmakdya is the citadel of the evidence of being, the Akanistha heaven; that of the sambhogakdya the pure Ghanavyfiha realm; and that of the nirmdnakdya the spheres of Alakavati, Tusita, Vajrakiuta, and others. The revealing power as dharmakdya is Samantabhadra; as sambho- gakdya, Vairocana; and as nirmdnakdya it is threefold: as dharmakdya it is Mahavajradhara or Vajrasattva; as the Vajra pattern it is Vajrapani; and as nirmdnakdya for the education of the six kinds of beings by appropriate means it is the six Buddhas. The environment means that as dharmakdya he transmits his message to the host of gods which are the self-manifestation of spiritual aware- ness and as peaceful and frightful appearances constitute the five action patterns of Buddhahood. As sambhogakdya he transmits his message by way of symbols and gestures to the assembly of those who have mani- fested themselves for the sake of sentient beings, the intellectually in- conceivable group of the five "fathers" beginning with Aksobhya38 and representing the formative aspect of the spiritual life, the five "mothers" beginning with Vajradhatvisvar 39 and representing the discriminative- appreciative aspect, the male bodhisattvas Ksitigarbha40 and so on as well as the female bodhisattvas Lasya41 and others, all of whom are 36 dGongs-pa zang-thal, fols. 7b ff. 37 byin-rlabs, Skt. adhisthdna. The meaning of this term is very similar to the Thomistic conception of "conaturality." 38 The others are Vairocana, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, and Amoghasiddhi. 39 The remaining four are: Buddhalocana, Mamaki, Pandaravasini, and Tara. 40 The others are Gaganagarbha, Avalokitesvara, and Vajrapani. They are the "intellectual" bodhisattvas, while Maijusri, Samantabhadra, Nivaranavi- skambhin, and Maitreya are "functional" bodhisattvas. The distinction between "intellectual" and "functional" bodhisattvas is discussed by Rong-zom chos-kyi bzang-po in his rgyud-rgyal gsang-ba snying-po'i 'grel-pa, fols. 56b ff. 41 She and the other three, Gitima, Malema, and Nrtyema, are the female part- ners of the "intellectual" bodhisattvas, while Puspema, Dhfipema, Alokema, and 299</page><page sequence="22">Tantra and Revelation nothing but the absolute mind of enlightenment. As nirmdntakdya he imparts his message by way of articulate speech to the innumerable hosts of transworldly Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and great grdvakas as well as to the countless numbers of form-endowed beings, such as the eight great gods, the protectors, the planets, lunar mansions, the lower gods, serpents, demons, and gandharvas, belonging to this world. The message: the dharmakdya promulgates that which is ineffable; the sambhogakdya, the six self-existing letters (omn mani padme hum); and the nirmdnakdya, the innumerable Sutras and Tantras. The time: the dharmakdya speaks when the profound understanding of reality sets in, and this means that time has no end. The sambhoga- kdya speaks when the concrete universal appears in its distinctness, and this is a pure vision. The nirmdnzakdya speaks from the time that an attitude directed to supreme enlightenment has been developed until such time when the world has become empty of sentient beings. Or it speaks from the time when the life span of each being is incalculable in years until the time when it is one hundred years. This promulgation is called the most excellent occasion. Revelation from without produces a world of imagination; every distinct aspect gives us a cosmology of its own fitted into the scheme of the whole. The danger of such a process is that it tends to become dogmatic and, thereby, absolutized error. However, the fact that this cosmology ultimately is grounded in man's very nature and that this may express itself individually in different forms has never been lost sight of. And this accounts for the fact that religious images vary from pattern to pattern, all of which are interrelated. Thus, we also find the following "cosmology":42 The dharmakdya's dharmakdya is Samantabhadra;43 the dharma- kdya's sambhogakaya is Vajradhara; and the dharmakdya's nirmdnakdya is Vajrasattva. The sambhogakdya's dharmakdya is Vairocana; the sambhogakdya's sambhogakdya is the five spiritual Buddhas; and the sambhogakdya's nirmdnakdya is Vajrapaini. The nirmdtnakdya's dharmakdya is Vajrasattva; the nirmdnakdya's sambhogakdya is the triad of Avalokitesvara, Vajrapani, and Manjurli; and the nirmdnakdya's nirmdnakdya is the six Buddhas [in the six worlds of beings]. Exterior revelation in Tantrism is essentially a suggestion of Gandhema, are those of the "functional" ones (see ibid.). Their relation to the "spiritual" Buddhas (Dhydnibuddhas) has been detailed in the Man-ngag snying- gi dgongs-pa'i rgyud rdo-rje-sems-pas gsungs-pa (dGongs-pa zang-thal, Vol. Ke). 42 Bi-ma snying-tig, Vol. Nga, fols. 72a ff. 43 This name is significant for the claim that religious symbols have to be ex- plicated. On the popular level where exterior revelation prevails, Samantabhadra has anthropomorphic traits, while on the philosophical level, Samantabhadra is a term for the absolute which is a positive value and which, psychologically speak- ing, indicates the positive character of human nature. 300</page><page sequence="23">themes, categories, propositions, and symbols which have to be thought out and applied. Exterior revelation, therefore, is not the ultimate in living religiously; it is merely a stimulus. The explica- tion of the propositions and symbols is important for the sake of self-knowledge and self-realization and also for keeping the re- ligious spirit alive. Insofar as exterior revelation is merely a sug- gestion and, at its best, a promise of truth, but never a conclusion or judgment about truth, its meaning must be explored. Not only does such exploration aim at obtaining what the proposition or symbol promises ("attaining the status of a Vidyadhara or Vajradhara"), it even more so functions as the capacity to relate the whole self (rgyud, tantra) to its source or ground (gzhi) or goal ('bras-bu). In this exploration of meaning, exterior revelation as a promising suggestion becomes interior revelation as a supremely illuminating and life-sustaining process (mngon-par byang-chub) working through creative imagination (sgom). 301</page></plain_text>
