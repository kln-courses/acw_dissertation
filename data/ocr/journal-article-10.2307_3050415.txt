<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Formation of Delacroix's Hero Between 1822 and 1831 Roy Howard Brown It is generally acknowledged that Delacroix developed many of his basic motifs from about 1822 to 1831 and returned frequently to the early themes later on, but con- tinuity in content among the paintings of this period has received relatively little attention.1 The early paintings vary greatly in subject matter, deriving from a wide range of literary, historical, and biblical sources. Many but not all show a single protagonist, the minority including such major works as the Bark of Dante with its pair of central figures, and the Massacre at Scio in which no protagonist is clearly defined. Hence a straightforward account of thematic continuity is difficult. If there be continuity, the artist's progress in this respect seems marked more by a troubled search than by a maturing singular vision, though perhaps, as Bau- delaire suggested, the real content of Delacroix's art lies in the expression of "passion."2 In his well-known posthu- mous tribute to Delacroix, however, the poet commented upon the artist's "morality," seeing in his work "... nothing but devastation, massacres, conflagrations; everything bears witness against the eternal and incorrigible barbarity of man."3 With such bleak witness there is scarcely place for a hero in any positive sense, one to lead humanity to a better state of being. Baudelaire implied a connection between Delacroix's outlook and Emerson's famous defi- nition of the hero as "immovably centered" in the face of adversity and social upheaval.4 Delacroix's later heroic model, Trajan for example, suggests a protagonist immov- ably centered in a mel6e of activity. If one is to look for precursors of this pattern in the early paintings, it is necessary to posit a sequential development of content that underlies the diversity of subject matter from one painting to the next. The formation of Delacroix's pro- tagonist then would become the main strand connecting the major works. I shall argue that the continuity is, rather, a matter of transformation, which includes both the artist's troubled search and the forming of a singular vision. This continuity is revealed in compositional structures, and can be supported by reference to preparatory sketches for sev- eral key paintings and to concurrent remarks in the Journal. In the Bark of Dante (Fig. 1) of 1822, the protagonists and damned are linked in a closed orbit, in which every part is joined through the tension of lights and darks and through the ordering of volumes. In the lower right corner the two damned are at once self-sufficient and an "anchor" to the major group. If one reads the major group as a closed composition and thereby removes it from its surroundings, this ground is then set off as an indefinite surrounding ambiance. A sense of drift is thus doubly conveyed: in the image of a menaced craft with its passengers and in the figure-ground relationship. On further inspection the two protagonists may appear further isolated within the orbit. Fixed to two major crossing diagonals, the composition may be seen to be constructed of a triangle and an oval. The one is based on the figures floating in the foreground and rising to include Dante and Virgil, thus isolating them, while the other is the orbit already mentioned, now read in depth across the foreshortened back of Phlegyas, the boatman. This orbit seems to surround the triangle like Saturn's rings. Thus forms emblemmatic of isolation and collective engulf- ment are juxtaposed. At this point it seems worthwhile at the cost of a brief digression to consider how the artist's immediate prede- cessors presented their protagonists. The structural differ- ence between Delacroix's first masterpiece and several exemplary paintings by David, Gros, and G6ricault will help to reveal his significant conceptual break from them at the start. That is to say, there already is at the outset of the artist's work a notion of protagonism different not only from David's, which would not be surprising, but also from that of Gros and G6ricault, whose work and criticism strongly influenced the young painter. David's Brutus, exhibited in 1789, also has an isolated protagonist.5 Brutus is alone in the foreground and seated 1 This paper is developed from one delivered at the Annual Meeting of the College Art Association in Cleveland, January 29, 1959.

Today, you place the principal character in the shadow ... furthermore where have you seen a composition made without employing the pyramidal line?" (my translation). David, we are told, dis- missed the criticism contemptuously. See Richard Cantinelli, Jacques-Louis David, Paris, 1930, 25-26. Herbert does not mention this incident but, in his own analysis, rec- ognized David's use of the split composition to gain dramatic effect. Da- vid's Brutus, together with Voltaire's play of the same name, played key propagandistic parts during the Revolutionary period. See Robert L. Her- bert, J. L.

Obscured by the shadow that crosses him, he appears, at first glance, sub- sidiary to the strongly lighted group of anguished mother and daughters who alert us to the tragic event. Entering from the left and behind Brutus, the Lictors carry home the bodies of his traitorous sons, who were condemned to death by their brooding but morally resolute father. The drama is conveyed not only by the central group but also through a supporting cadence of verticals, a converging of hori- zontals, and the stark opposition of diagonals. Structural features are intimately bound into pictorial action. Though placed in isolation, Brutus is the ultimate focus and per- vasive force of the painting. Everything else either antici- pates his presence or develops from it. In effect, his will and necessary decision - symbolic of enlightened virtuous individualism - provide the meaning of the painting and determine its measurable rectilinear structure in which the protagonist and his pictured world are united. David's masterpiece of 1793, the Dying Marat, projected the ultimate glorious martyrdom of the enlightened indi- vidual. While fallen in death, the hero's head seems lifted compositionally by the folds and cloth panel beneath it. There is a sense of deposition and apotheosis combined, as if Marat's head and shoulder had risen to challenge the great descending weight of uninterrupted negative area that fills the upper part of the painting. Like the Brutus and David's other pre-Napoleonic epic pieces, the Dying Marat is char- acterized by a composition in which the protagonist is inte- grated with his setting. With the advent of Napoleon a new protagonism cap- tures French thought and art. In Baron Gros' depiction of him, Napoleon, the roi thaumaturge, is significantly, though perhaps narrowly, separated from a vast wreckage of humanity reaching much farther than he can encompass; he is not threatened by it and, to the contrary, seems con- fident in his power to master circumstances. In his Pest House of Jaffa of 1804, Gros utilizes background orthog- onals - the rhythmic swing of an arcade, reminiscent of that in David's Oath of the Horatii - to focus attention on Napoleon. The band of dead and dying that stretches across the foreground sets the stage for what occurs above, or behind if one reads the painting in depth. There a broad band of the sick, as a collective mass, presses in from the right to be halted and, in a sense, turned back by the pro- tagonist with the healing touch. To the left of Napoleon and his adjutant one sees an empty space which reinforces the meaning of the protagonist's effective act: it makes clear the commanding role of the leader. Farther to the left is a small group of witnesses, one looking upon the terrible scene, another gazing at the major action of the work. Gros produced his effect with the same structural groundwork as did David, but here the concept of enlightened individ- ualism has become encapsulated in the figure of the new Ar?:; c I w l; YN 1 Bark of Dante, 1822. Paris, Louvre imperial republican. While Gros' protagonist is structurally focal and distinct, he is also part of the collective mass as seen pictorially. Following Napoleon's defeat and the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, Gericault painted the Raft of the Medusa; without it the whole of Delacroix's early work is inconceivable. It has no central protagonist, only a drifting collection of individuals that coalesce into a single trian- gular thrust toward a brighter horizon. The progression from lower left to upper right of the main diagonal is from death and desolation to life and hope. One may find in this work something of a social dream inherited from the Rev- olution. With the Gericault, there is a sense of collective will transmitted through structural forces. By way of con- trast, Delacroix's Bark of Dante suggests no collective will but represents instead, as I have indicated, protagonists who are tenuously isolated - both structurally and pic- torially - within an encircling, menacing group. The social circumstances during the Bourbon Restora- tion, when Delacroix was in his 'teens, were hardly con- ducive to optimistic social dreams. Benjamin Constant's Adolphe captured the mood of the time. Adolphe typified the new distraught temperament torn between sympathetic moral duty and personal ambition. Between 1815 and 1828 Victor Cousin formulated his eclectic philosophy of the juste milieu. He rejected the eighteenth century's socially focused self-interest as the morality of despotism and slav- ery, and countered it with what he considered the true ethic of free, impartial, unimpassioned individualism.6 Echoing the tone of Cousin's philosophy, Delacroix decried his own equivocations in the face of social medi- ocrity and distraction. He expressed this self-reproach among the first entries in his Journal, begun shortly after exhibiting the Bark of Dante. He wished to conquer emo- 6 Cousin's major philosophical work, which was finally titled Le vrai, le beau et le bien, appeared in many editions throughout the 19th century. According to Levy-Bruhl (History of Modern Philosophy in France, Chi- cago, 1924, 347), after Cousin was accused of pantheism (because he viewed God as one infinite and absolute substance and because of the entire spirit of his philosophy), he began modifying his work to comply with orthodoxy, changing among other things the name of his philosophy from "eclecticism" to "spiritualism." The first editions of Cousin's work were based heavily on notes taken by his best students during his lectures.

See particularly ibid., chap. 30, 302-312. A later English edition contains this explicit passage by Cousin: "It was especially nec- essary for me to strip the ethics of interest of that false appearance of liberty which they usurp in vain." Cousin is concerned here with the 18th- century sensationalist's arguments for "enlightened self-interest." "I main- tain, on the contrary, that they [i.e., these ethics] are the ethics of slaves, and return them to the time when they ruled." See Victor Cousin, The tionality by a coldly calculating will. He was yet unable to gain this detachment, however, as his youthful erotic activ- ities reveal. "What is this I," he asked early in 1824, still searching for an answer that would project this ego above the oppressive multitude.7 For his chief work of 1822 Delacroix had initially intended to show Charon centrally placed and holding an oar with which he was forcefully subduing the damned about him, according to the text of Canto III of the Inferno (Fig. 2).8 The two figures seen faintly in the background to the left of Charon are doubtless the two poets. They are detached from the events that swirl about them. The inseparability of Dante and Virgil in Delacroix's initial idea is shown by the sketch of their huddled heads and what is probably Virgil's oddly placed hand. The expression of the laurel- wreathed poet is stronger than that of a frightened, retiring Dante. In a later version of the subject (Fig. 3), the artist turned to Canto VIII where Virgil and Dante are trans- ported across the river Styx to the infernal city of Dis.9 Here, the two replace the earlier Charon in prominence. Much as in the final oil version, Virgil appears the more stalwart of the two, though more stoical and removed. In both this sketch and the painting, it is Dante who recoils in horror and possibly fright. The painting reverses the composition and amplifies the text. At the same time, the arrangement of figures is more cohesive in the painting. Virgil in the oil retreats further from the action to become a shrouded wraith. Gesture is concentrated in the more volumetrically revealed Dante whose upraised arm signifies, if not engagement, at least True, The Beautiful and the Good, trans. 0. W. Wight, New York, 1879, 254. Delacroix was frequently in Cousin's company throughout his life, and his Journal indicates that they were often engaged in serious discussions, the artist not always agreeing with the philosopher. In an entry in the Journal dated October 4, 1855, Delacroix reminisced about his youth and mentioned that he had taken Cousin's course. Earlier, when he first decided to paint "scenes of the Massacre of Scio," he wrote of intending to see Cousin. Significantly, in the very same entry and just following this self- reminder, Delacroix copied an extensive series of paragraphs from Addi- son's Spectator in which the English writer discusses freedom that increases for men by virtue of their self-control. See Delacroix, 1950, 11, 398 and I, 32-33. 7 Ibid., i, 51. 8 Johnson's search for formal antecedents in the work of Michelangelo, G&amp;ricault, and Rubens for the figures and arrangements in Delacroix's painting seems in no way affirmed or denied by the present argument. The two approaches may in fact complement each other. See Lee Johnson, "The Formal Sources of Delacroix's Barque de Dante," Burlington Mag- azine, c, 1948, 228-232. I am grateful to Mr. Johnson for helping me to obtain the photograph of the Schoeller study, which he published and which is also reproduced here. The writing in Delacroix's hand on the left and above these preliminary sketches, RF 23.356, is his transcription of Canto III, lines 100 to 124 of the Inferno. 9 The sketch follows fairly closely lines 40 to 42 where Virgil pushes Filippo Argenti back into the water after he threatened to board the boat and seize Dante. Immediately after this action in the poem, however, Virgil embraces Dante with a protective reassuring gesture. This movement is implied in the Schoeller study but is completely absent from the painting.</page><page sequence="4">240 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1984 VOLUME LXVI NUMBER 2 psychological immediacy of relation with the event. Taken together, the two show a complex psychic wholeness, active in its rejection (Dante), and passive in its acceptance (Vir- gil). The progression of Delacroix's idea "in quest of itself," to cite Rudrauf's apt phrase, crystalizes in form as the pro- tagonists become jointly detached from the rest.10 In this first major work Delacroix's protagonist is a pair of Sia- mese twins, each requiring the other: Dante needing Virgil's support, Virgil requiring Dante's substance, caught as they are in a world beyond human control. Virgil suggests Vic- tor Cousin's ideal, yet without Dante, he dissolves into a shadowy presence."1 Although Delacroix had contemplated doing a painting on the Greek War of Independence since January 1821, his motivation was not sufficiently stirred, apparently, until the vast devastation on Scio.12 Unlike the general recording of philhellenic sympathies, however, his Journal and cor- respondence contain no hint of pity, rage, or defiant indig- nation. As Rosenthal wrote, "... in the Massacre at Scio he no longer represents revolt but resignation mourning under an irremediable adversity."13 Friedlander com- plained that "... instead of a single picture ... Delacroix formed diverse incidents that are somewhat anecdotal in effect."14 This failure reveals the meaning of the work in Delacroix's development. The confused duality of the imagery in the Bark is now shown split apart though differently conceived, as I shall indicate. The chaos of the Styx has been transplanted to Scio and given overtones of the work of Baron Gros and Goya. The group on the left of the painting (Fig. 4) dom- inated the artist's original plan, as is shown in the early sketch (Fig. 5).15 The squat crowded triangle encloses as its central personality the Christ-like, half-naked wounded Greek patriot reclining on the breast of his mate. His resem- blance to Christ cannot be accidental; it fits the then-con- temporary view of the Greek battling in defense of Chris- tendom, freedom, and the classical inheritance against the infidel and despot.16 The foreground grouping in the sketch suggests a Pieti~. The reclining pose of the patriot was a favorite of Dela- croix's for many of his heroes. His venerated brother in an 1822 portrait and an 1826 version of his favorite figure, 10 Rudrauf, 247. Rudrauf quotes further on from a letter by the artist to his good friend Pierret who, in fact, had read to Delacroix those passages from the Inferno which inspired him. The letter was written from Souillac during the autumn of 1820: "It is not sufficient ... to have active and fecund sources: one needs a firm spirit and to develop [these sources] without drying up that fugitive flower that colors the thought within the thought [i.e. the overall original comprehensive idea], and which dis- appears so rapidly when the [latter] thought has donned its garments in order to be seen and felt" (ibid., 262, my translation). Delacroix is here suggesting an inner driving idea that remains itself concealed behind the surface formations of his creation. It is just such teleological notions that lift him from the ranks of the illustrator or formalist and lead us to expect a continuity of thought through paintings which, when superficially observed, seem quite diverse and unrelated. More recent discussions on Delacroix's own theories of art and imag- ination are focused on his syncretic handling of diverse ideas. See George Mras, Eug ne Delacroix's Theory of Art, Princeton, 1966, and Wolfgang Stolte aus Schwerin, Zur Imagination im Werk von Eughne Delacroix, Bonn, 1978, which treats especially of his synthesizing the romantic and classical modes. 11 See Cousin (as in n. 6), 49-55 passim. In 1955, Eitner made an interesting observation about the artist's life- time preoccupation with "the theme of the distressed boat." He concludes: "the textual reference changes from picture to picture, but the image of shipwreck remains constant. It was very evidently this image that basi- cally attracted Delacroix, not the shifting narrative subjects; they merely gave him an opportunity for presenting what appears to have been a private symbol."

(ca. 1900), 209, my translation. 14 Walter Friedlander, David to Delacroix, trans. Robert Goldwater, Cam- bridge, Mass., 1952, 111ff. Trapp suggests that the artist "... chose to dramatize a brutal and point- less sacrifice ...," an explanation that is not very helpful. His analysis of the sequence of studies for the painting makes no connection between the formal process and the meaning. See Frank Anderson Trapp, The Attain- ment of Delacroix, Baltimore, 1970, 35-39. 15 The presence of hatching throughout this grouping and particularly the distribution of small dark areas exclusively in this section bear witness to the ideo-formal integrity of the group. 16 In 1829 Delacroix painted a Pietai showing a supine Christ with his head resting in the lap of Mary who is seated on the ground. Behind them is an open background of hills and fields, a compositional formula already established in the Massacre at Scio. See Robaut, 83, No. 397. For the influence of the Greek War of Independence of 1821-27 upon Western art, especially that of France, see Nina Athanassoglou, "Under the Sign of Leonidas: The Political and Ideological Fortune of David's Leonidas at Thermopylae under the Restoration," Art Bulletin, LXIII, 1981, 633-649. Athanassoglou refers to Delacroix's "... keen curiosity about current events and his taste for things exotic heightened by a freedom- loving idealism," ibid., 635. In light of my argument, I question the asso- ciation of "freedom-loving idealism" with Delacroix. For contemporary accounts of the Greek War and attitudes toward it, see Edward Blaquiere, The Greek Revolution: Origin and Progress, Lon- don, 1825, 2nd ed., particularly the "Declaration to the Christian Pow- ers," 330-31. French and German editions of this book were also published the same year by Bossange Freres in Paris and Leipzig.

There is, moreover, a link with the earlier Dantesque themes in a sketch, dated per- suasively by Serullaz to 1822, for an uncompleted project (Fig. 8).21 It shows the poet in a similar consolatrice motif; the reference to Dante's text, however, is not clear. Mutual sympathy and equality in suffering characterize the whole left-hand group of the Massacre. As the early sketch shows, the effect was initially intended. Here, the hero seems com- mitted to sharing the collective ordeal. The next version, since the dead woman and her child are still not indicated, is the watercolor study in which the patriot group is retracted toward the left (Fig. 9). The tri- angle of the earlier sketch has given way to a more circular form, but retains the latter's dominant diagonal. The woman in the foreground, who had earlier bracketed the Christ-like patriot of the Pietah grouping, shifts to a new unit emerging on the right below an ominous Turkish horseman. The horseman, who was an incidental back- ground figure in the earlier version, now presses forward. The third version (Fig. 10), which includes the dead woman and her hungry child - a factual detail probably drawn from a French officer's eyewitness account - shows the horseman in power.22 His compositional tie was not clar- ified in the watercolor, but now a diagonal, indicated by the hatching, fixes his position and, thrusting downward, transfixes the axis of the defeated Greeks. In this version the two opposing groups are clearly marked off. In contrast to the collective humanity of the left-hand group, the one on the right shows an opposing content. Anchoring the downward diagonal, the foreground figure becomes, in the painting, the lonely old woman who expresses futility in a long literary and artistic lineage. The adjacent dead mother with her child, showing abandon- ment, is the very antithesis of the consolatrice on the left. The dominating mounted Turk represents the arch-enemy, whose triumph threatened all that Western European phil- hellenism held dear. Yet from the personal standpoint of the artist, the moral- ity is not so sharply defined. Since 1817 at least, Oriental horsemen had fascinated Delacroix. Byron's Giaour had so captivated him during the last stages of work on the Mas- sacre that he promptly projected a series of paintings on the "noble ruffian."23 His preoccupation with the Turk's sin- ister eye, as shown in the sheet of studies (Fig. 11), recalls Byron's description of the Giaour with his "... dark and unearthly ... scowl ..." and "flash of ... dilating eye."24 Indeed, reflecting Mario Praz's ample description, the mounted Turk suggests a satanic hero, who prepares to abduct his voluptuous prize.2? This recalls Delacroix's other, more contumacious attitude toward women, toward those models and working girls who aroused his passions.26 In the context of 1824, the Oriental could be hero only by disguise, but precisely such a reversal of social morality 17 Delacroix regarded his brother as an exemplary hero, "... in the first rank of estimable men ...," whom he found, characteristically for his her- oes and self-image, "... surrounded by brutes and rabble." See Delacroix, 1950, i, 11. See also Rudrauf, 86. 18 See Serullaz, pl. XLI and comment on 68. See also Johnson, 79. 19 See Delacroix, 1950, I, 89. The fact that the wounded Greek of the Massacre had already been fixed prior to this commission, hence prior to the first probable sketches of Christ, does not deny that the Greek has Christ-like aspects. Indeed, the similarity suggests that the conception of Christ, alone and not understood, in the Garden grew directly from earlier conceptions of the Greek. See Robaut, Nos. 176, 179-183, and also Ser- ullaz, pls. XLVI and XLVII, comments on 47 and mimeographed addenda on pl. XLVI. 20 See Rudrauf, 103-131, on the relations between Delacroix's eroticism and his creativity; also Raymond Escholier, EugBne Delacroix et sa "Con- solatrice," Paris, 1932, a well-documented elucidation of this rather obscure side of Delacroix's life. A more recent work on the same subject by this author is Delacroix et les femmes, Paris, 1963. 21 Serullaz, pl. xxIII, comments on 31 and mimeographed addenda. 22 In a footnote to the English edition of Blaquiere (as in n. 16), 200-01, and in the French edition, 221-22, is a vivid description of the desolation on Scio. Included in the account is the following (English ed.): "A French officer, who landed soon after the massacre, saw an infant clinging to the breast of its mother, a young and beautiful woman, whose lifeless corpse lay bleeding on the ground." Inasmuch as the detail in the painting follows this description so closely, Delacroix may have been familiar with the first edition in French of Bla- quiere's work or learned of the incident through newspaper accounts. 23 Delacroix, 1950, 99; also Escholier, I, 128; and Mario Praz, The Roman- tic Agony, 2nd ed., London, 1933, 70. 24 George Gordon, Lord Byron, The Complete Poetical Works of Byron, ed.

A critical comment upon Praz's viewpoint toward women may be found in an unpublished Ph.D. thesis for Boston Uni- versity by Virginia Allen, The "Femme Fatale." 26 In his comments on the Universal Exposition of 1855, Baudelaire con- sidered Delacroix's conceptions of women divided into two groups: those - presented especially in the Death of Sardanapalus - who are "... rich, robust, opulent, abundant women, and are endowed with a wonderful transparency of flesh and superb heads of hair," and the others: "... who are sometimes historical women (like the Cleopatra looking at the asp), but are more often women of fancy, of genre - Marguerites, Ophelias, even Blessed Virgins or Magdalens - these I would be inclined to call 'women in intimacy.' Their eyes seem heavy with some painful secret which cannot be buried in the grave of secrecy. Their pallor is like a revelation of their internal struggles ...," Baudelaire, 215. Baudelaire did not make the class distinctions that I do. For Baudelaire, Delacroix was "... of all artists the best equipped to express modern woman, and, above all, modern woman in her heroic manifestation, in the divine or the infernal interpretation of the word."

Paris, Louvre, Cabinet des Dessins makes him all the more audacious and alluring.27 A Journal entry dated May 9, 1824, a day before Dela- croix's first mention of Byron's poem, expressed his grow- ing satisfaction with his work and simultaneously a tight- ening spiritual resolve: "There is an old leaven, a black depth that demands satisfaction. If I am not quivering like a snake in the hands of Pythoness, I am cold; I must rec- ognize it and submit to it, and to do so is happiness ... No more Don Quixotes and things unworthy of you! Concen- trate intensely before your painting and think only of Dante. Therein lies what I have always felt in myself."28 Whatever "Don Quixotes" meant to Delacroix, the type could not stand for passivity and acceptance of evil. Don Quixote may have been foolish and ill-guided, but surely he was motivated by a desire to right wrongs and conquer evil in the world. There was a social vision in his quest. But, for Delacroix, no more of that! Dante, for him, was an observer who was detached though appalled by what he saw. The new Dante of the artist is more secure than his conception in 1822. The 1824 passage from his Journal seems curiously suggested by the drawing reproduced in Figure 8 with its snake motive and winged youth (the freed spirit of genius?). Is Dante here submitting perhaps to "the hands of Pythoness"? In light of all this, the Massacre at Scio appears to divide the protagonist theme between a defeated, Christ-like and 10 Massacre at Scio, sketch.

"... Allegory is a fine field! Blind destiny dragging along all the suppliants who hope, by their cries and their prayers, to stay his inflexible arms ..."

According to Robaut, this canvas, which resembles in general composition and conception several of his works on Tasso, was begun on April 6, 1824, and finished in 1825. Beyond this single effort, the Spanish hero appeared to hold no further fascination for the artist. The contrast between Delacroix and the socially oriented Daumier in their attraction to the character of Don Quixote is noteworthy.</page><page sequence="8">244 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1984 VOLUME LXVI NUMBER 2 ineffectual hero, the vestige of a socially oriented force, who is visibly one with his "damned" compatriot, and an aggressive, sadistic "enemy" Turk who rises to dominate and detach himself from the whole. The dualism repre- sents, in effect, a realignment of the earlier dualism, cross- fertilized, so to speak, so that Dante's compassionate inef- fectuality joins Virgil's passivity in the wounded Greek while Dante's will-to-act joins Virgil's self-possession in the Turk. Between 1824 and the appearance of The Death of Sardan- apalus in 1827, chief among Delacroix's themes were his celebrated illustrations for Goethe's Faust, which the old poet found so remarkably close to his own intentions. One ought to be cautious, to be sure, in drawing conclusions about an artist's frame of mind from such explicitly illus- trative pieces as these, whose compositions are restricted by their immediate function. Without going into detail, it may be observed that Delacroix's Faust and Mephistoph- eles are engaged conjointly in their exploits. More alike than the earlier Dante and Virgil "twins" they continue to embody the central detachment of the earlier pair.29 Though Goethe indicated his satisfaction, Delacroix's Faust expresses a more aggressive satanic spirit than the deeply introspective, morally troubled hero of the play. In any case, the trend that I have traced so far in his paintings and sketches is not contradicted by these lithographs. There is no deviation, either, in his images of the self-contained mis- understood Tasso in the insane asylum, the suffering for- lorn Christ in the Garden, the animals whose muteness allows no vent for their fury,30 and the provocative female nudes of the period. The split composition of the Massacre expresses an irre- solution between contending opposites. The risen protag- onist, the mounted Turk, must surely have caused anxiety while it excited the artist's imagination. In whatever way it rested in his conscience, it served apparently to dispel the "Don Quixotes" or other socially oriented protagonists. Thereafter, Delacroix's thematic emphasis is upon combat or detachment, not social collectivity. By 1827, the year when liberalism in politics was equated by Delacroix's circle of friends and acquaintances with indi- vidual freedom in art, The Death of Sardanapalus (Fig. 12) synthesized the previous duality of the artist's protagonist in the single figure of the reclining monarch. Delacroix referred to the painting as his second "Massacre," indicat- ing a conscious connection in thought.31 In pose Sardan- apalus descends from the wounded Greek and the long series of reclining heroes.32 Particularly noticeable is the self-enclosing position of his arms. The sketch and painting of 1827 for Tasso in the Madhouse shows the identical posi- tion. In physiognomy Sardanapalus is blood brother to the Giaour and recalls the mounted Turk of the first "Massa- cre" vis ~ vis the voluptuous victims of his will. Farwell has quite correctly indicated the discrepancy between Dela- croix's conception and the denouement of Byron's play which inspired the artist.33 In order to explain the differ- ences, she searched for other literary and archaeological sources. It is a search, as she concluded, that can never be fully completed. Unfortunately, Farwell circumscribes the determining stimuli for Delacroix's creation with the sen- tence: "... Delacroix preserves the treasures, slaves, and concubines that Byron removed from the final scene, and evidently preferred the proud and willful Sardanapalus of antiquity to the martyr of Byron."34 Spector comes closer to the argument here presented but does not link the pro- tagonist to Delacroix's preceding ones, and has a critically different way of seeing the composition.35 There are impor- tant continuities in composition from the previous works that he does not mention. In contrast to Farwell's conclu- sion, I believe that preference is the key factor at issue. Delacroix departs from the play precisely in eliminating any allusion to the monarch's social consciousness, strained and vainglorious as it is. In Byron's play, Sardanapalus defends his sybaritic policy as more benign and morally enlightened than the merciless belligerency of his forebears. When forced to take arms, he astounds friend and foe alike by his courage and martial skill. Nevertheless, Byron's hero never loses his devotion to the gentle ways of luxurious peace. This is made quite evident. After his display of brav- ery and his dispatching his queen and heirs to safety in distant Paphlagonia, and just before his final effort on the battlements, he reassures his favorite concubine, the Ionian Myrrha, with these words: I am content: and, trusting in my cause, Think we may yet be victors and return To peace - the only victory I covet. To me war is no glory - conquest no 29 See Robaut, esp. 68, No. 238; 69, No. 242; 70, No. 246; 71, Nos. 248 and 249; and 72, No. 250. 30 For a discussion of Delacroix's anthropomorphic view of animals, see Eve Twose Kliman, "Delacroix's Lions and Tigers: A Link Between Man and Nature," Art Bulletin, LXIV, 1982, 446-466. 31 Letter to A. Soulier, dated Paris, February 6, 1828; Delacroix, 1935, i, 211. 32 For this observation I am indebted to Professor Meyer Schapiro who pointed out the similarities of pose in lectures at Columbia University during 1950-51. 33 Beatrice Farwell, "Sources for Delacroix's Death of Sardanapalus," Art Bulletin, XL, 1958, 66-71, esp. 66-68; see also Lee Johnson, "The Etruscan Sources of Delacroiox's Death of Sardanapalus," Art Bulletin, XLII, 1960, 296-300. Inasmuch as Johnson deals only with the formal influences, based on Delacroix's belief in his own "classical" orientation, nothing is added to or subtracted from my argument. Since Delacroix was free to search a wide range of pictorial and literary sources for the painting, the question must still be answered concerning both the specific selections and their adaptations and their relevance to the picture's content. A monograph on the work that suggests connections between formal detail and content is by Jack J. Spector, Delacroix: The Death of Sar- danapalus, New York, 1974. Spector relates the internal evidence of the painting to external supporting material in the artist's life and record in order to place the work with respect to the artist and his influence. The problem of continuity between the Death of Sardanapalus and Delacroix's other work is not treated, however. 34 Farwell (as in n. 33), 68. 35 Spector (as in n. 33), 21ff., also sees the bed as a raft but fails to connect its meaning with earlier works. He cites the formalistic arguments of Wahl and Johnson. See Johnson, 116-121.</page><page sequence="9">DELACROIX'S HERO 245 12 Death of Sardanapalus, 1827.

Never, never, Can I forget this night, even should I live To add it to the memory of others. I thought to have made mine inoffensive rule An era of sweet peace 'midst bloody annals, A green spot amidst desert centuries, On which the future would turn back and smile, And cultivate, or sigh when it could not Recall Sardanapalus' golden reign. I thought to have made my realm a paradise, And every moon an epoch of new pleasures. I took the rabble's shouts for love, the breath Of friends for truth, the lips of woman for My only guerdon - so they are, my Myrrha: Kiss me. Now let them take my realm and life! They shall have both, but never thee!36 Byron would like to persuade us of the essential goodness of his hero - not his evil - whose tragedy lay in being too humane for his epoch. The play ends in an over- wrought medley of horror and tenderness, but it is surely closer to the spirit of Deveria's illustration of the climactic immolation, a work that Farwell reproduces as a possible source for Delacroix.37 In the Deveria version, strikingly similar in detail to Byron's directions for the funeral pyre with the throne forming "... the core of it," the lovers sit together, he embracing her, as they fearfully await the mounting tongues of flame. Deveria's conception, in fact, recalls the group of the wounded Greek in the Massacre at Scio rather than the section with the mounted Turk of that work or the insulated Sardanapalus of the later painting. Delacroix's preference for a portrayal of a more sardonic, unadulterated egocentricity than Byron provides is crucial to the present argument. That the painter initially intended to depict a malevolent protagonist is shown by a preparatory sketch (Fig. 13) in which Sardanapalus' bearded visage - incarnate evil - emerges from shadow. In this sketch the twisted figure of the doomed concubine, doubtless the antecedent for the unfortunate who is about to be stabbed in the foreground of the painting, is still in a formative phase, while Sardan- apalus seems already intact in Delacroix's imagination. Per- haps the ruler's image was added later to a space unfilled by earlier sketches on the sheet so that the emergence of the monarch's visage may have been quite independent in time and formation from that of the woman. Nevertheless, the rapid pen-strokes that form the monarch's head are so like those which render the more ephemeral nude while yet being more definitive, that we can assume the artist's early arrival at his hero's image. Unlike the phased crystalizing of the Oriental of the earlier Massacre, the present one seems to have leapt more quickly, less equivocatingly into final form.3" Accordingly, Delacroix in 1827 could have had no doubt concerning the personality or effect of this major figure. In the first Massacre the satanic compound of beauty, eroticism, and death was restricted to the right side of the painting. Now in the Death of Sardanapalus it is given full play. The prominent presence of the monarch's favorite steed consigned to perish with him suggests a connection with the antecedent mounted Turk. The ruler's bed, like Dante's raft, floats upon the display of impending butchery and holocaust. The glow of Nineveh in the background 36 Byron (as in n. 24), 586, lines 502-523. 37 Farwell (as in n. 33), figure 3 facing p. 70. The editorial reader of this article has kindly pointed out to me that the engraving is incorrectly attributed in the caption to De Bruyn. 38 Confirmation for this is given by two sketches for the painting, repro- duced by Robaut, 51, Nos. 168 and 169. Both show the monarch as he appears finally in the large oil. The oil sketch, No. 168, presents the fore- ground concubine gruesomely beheaded, as in Fig. 15. Robaut comments on "... the numerous variants that the master has introduced in the defin- itive composition of this ..." (my translation). In contrast with the changes in other details, the monarch's pose as well as the general composition are fixed. The "pens6e" had been established in the artist's mind, conse- quently, early in the creative process.</page><page sequence="10">246 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1984 VOLUME LXVI NUMBER 2 recalls Dis of the infernal scene. Thus, the former duality is resolved in the monarch while, at the same time, a tri- angular structure is regained from the compositional split of the earlier Massacre. Although the hero is intended for death, it is a martyrdom quite unlike that of David's Marat.39 The painting's amorality, if not immorality, was too strong and undisguised for many of Delacroix's con- temporaries, but it was nevertheless defended by Victor Hugo and other liberals as a banner raised against conservatism.40 The Death of Sardanapalus was a catharsis for Dela- croix's imagination. It resolved an inner turmoil; it did not inaugurate a strain of negativism and despair. No sequence of morbid or sadistic themes followed it - at least not for a decade until he painted Medea killing her children. To the contrary, the work of his next few years is noteworthy for its positively heroic character. Two new images emerge at this time, the allegorical female protagonist and the young man with a top hat, both in contexts that are polit- ically tendentious. Overtly they would seem to stand for everything that Sardanapalus did not, a commitment to social betterment and liberating causes. Yet, upon exami- nation, they reveal Delacroix's protagonist in essence: to be in and yet above the battle. Between 1826 and 1830 the artist had become as politi- cally involved, as partisan to public causes as he was ever to be. While no pamphleteer or ardent advocate of the Greek War of Independence, he was nevertheless engaged in philhellenism which, in France, was led by a combina- tion of Bonapartist retired officers and Orleanist liberals like the banker Lafitte. On several occasions Delacroix pro- vided paintings for philhellenic fund-raising exhibits in England and France. In 1826 he was one of the founders and leaders of the Societh de peintres, later broadened into the Societe libre de peinture et sculpture, which petitioned the Bourbon regime for a more open policy of exhibitions and commis- sions.41 Delacroix drafted the petition of protest. Such activity was unique for this very private person and delib- erate non-joiner. Even so, he expressed his doubts con- cerning the success of the Societe in a letter to his friend Soulier written four months after completing the Sardan- apalus. "I fear the Frenchmen," he wrote in English, "will not have the constancy necessary in such a business, parce qu'un artist never will consent to lose a quarter of an hour a week for occupying himself of the common good of the society."42 Perhaps his observations of his fellow artists were correct. More important, the fact that in the face of this assessment he chose to exceed his expectations of others shows him in a moment of social commitment. His friend- ship with Victor Hugo during the period, moreover, must have been significant in strengthening his general outlook. It is not surprising, then, that his imagination would be engaged with socially founded subjects. In both the Greece Expiring at Missolonghi (Fig. 14) and Liberty Guiding the People (Fig. 15) the protagonists are positioned in centralized triangles standing above the evi- dence of death and destruction. Huyghe has pointed out their resemblance in facial type to the dead Greek mother in the Massacre at Scio.43 But unlike the earlier figure, these two are compositionally set apart from their compatriots by the "raft" motif. Of course, there is a different purpose here. Unlike the anecdotal dead mother, they are symbols of courage and leadership.44 Their sexuality has been mod- ified. Despite the partial or full exposure of their breasts, they are not erotically arousing. Expiring Greece is demure, less "a woman of the people" than Liberty, but both display a decided classical solidity. In contrast to the concubines of Sardanapalus, their hips are not curvaceous. Prepara- tory sketches for Liberty show the artist's intention to reduce the eroticism of the hips (Fig. 16), and by dimin- ishing and neutralizing them, he gave the breasts a less erotic, now more maternal and nurturing association. This suggests another link with the dead Greek mother of the 39 Jack Lindsay comments: In Sardanapalus the impulse of heroism, severed from all rational and human ends, is distorted into the mad self-exaltation that wills murder and cruelty as part of its heightened egoism. The long series that we have seen running from the dead Achilles and the ardent Horatii, through Marat, Le Peletier, the battle dead of Gros and G4ricault, the men of the Raft, the defeated ones of Chios - this series is sharply inverted. The hero is driven satanically back on himself, his pride is a festering wound, he dies in a revenge that curses life - inside a great cavern of jewelled shadows lighted by the white bodies of doomed women. Beauty has become a thing of perverse personal satisfactions; the unavailing pity is swallowed up in the egoist interpretation of experience. Death of the Hero, French Painting from David to Delacroix, London, 1960, 164. Lindsay does not indicate the process of this inversion among "the defeated ones of Chios." Otherwise, I agree with his general percep- tion of the work. 40 For a discussion of the liberal-romantic offensive that was then mounted in the Salon of 1827, see Rene Schneider, Quatremere de Quincy et son intervention dans les arts 1788-1830, Paris, 1910, 327-331.

Paris, Louvre, Cabinet des Dessins Massacre.45 Liberty is lustier than Expiring Greece, a militant fighter rather than a stoical victim. Unlike Greece, she is com- positionally more engaged with the anecdotal figures about her: the formal concurrence of her musket with the gesture of the gamin on the right, the linkage with the corpses below, and the wounded rebel on the left who looks up in worshipful adoration. It should be noted, however, that Liberty's exposed left foot planted on a pedestal-like stone slab sets her apart from the others.46 H61ene Toussaint links Liberty not only to Expiring Greece but also to a series of sketches going back to Dela- croix's philhellenic preoccupations of 1821, prior to the Bark of Dante.47 Notable are numerous sketches that she relates to the struggle of Greece against the Turks.48 In all of these 4s In A Letter to the Earl of Liverpool on the Subject of the Greeks, Lon- don, 1822, the Rev. T. S. Hughes refers to Greece as "... that land, the fostering nurse of Civilization ..."; quoted in St. Clair (as in n. 16), 58. T. J. Clark also comments on the de-eroticizing of the image of Liberty: She begins as an image straight from Delacroix's private vocabulary - a lithe twisting torso, assertive and yet fragile, a sexual body still close in feeling to the women of Scio or Sardanapalus. In the next drawing ..., she is squarer, more massive; and in the painting itself her body is turned towards us, flattened out by the hard light which falls on her side, the chest seemingly much broader than the breasts it carries, the arms thrown into shadow, thin and match-like in comparison; the face less feminine, turned into profile and harshly lit, like a face on an antique medal or a low relief ... It is not ... that the final Liberty is sexless, far from it. But her sexuality is a public one; her nakedness is not one with which Delacroix was, endlessly, familiar; her breasts and shoulders are those of Marie Deschamps ... a woman of the People, one of the crowd that surrounded her. T. J. Clark, The Absolute Bourgeois, Greenwich, Conn., 1973, 18. While I agree with Clark in recognizing the transformation of Liberty, her ascription to Marie Deschamps is by no means certain, and as I explain in the text, there are sources also in the artist's "private vocabulary" for the type that Liberty becomes. As an allegorical figure, she may be in detail a pastiche of many thoughts surrounding a central motif and, thus, appear quite novel in Delacroix's lexicon of images. 46 For a review of facts and comments on this work, see Hd1lne Adhemar, "La Liberte sur les Barricades de Delacroix," Gazette des beaux-arts, XLIII, 1954, 83-92.

Toussaint suggests that the crown of Cybele was later replaced by the Phrygian bonnet as the artist's early conceptions developed into the image of Liberty.49 There are no figures in the sketches that are clearly Greek or Turkish, but Toussaint calls attention to some annota- tions that appear in connection with a particular early sheet with three studies.50 The sheet had been removed from a dismembered notebook but remained in a binder that bore a red wax seal for the posthumous sale of the artist's work. Inside the binder's front cover are several notes in Dela- croix's hand and near them on a label are words written by someone else: "Epoque de la Gr&amp;ce representhe par le meme dessin.. (un mot indechiffrable)." On another page, which had accompanied the sketch since the nineteenth century, according to Toussaint, the following appears in the same hand as on the label: "Un trompette s'effor;ant avant de mourir d'appeler ses compagnons" and below this: "Laissant flotter sa draperie au vent pour appeler ses fils aux armes." Do not these annotations, Toussaint asks, indicate the exhortations of a mother of her country (mere-patrie) encouraging her children to the struggle? She argues that such annotations are much like what Delacroix commonly adds to his studies and that, when the original notebook was taken apart, Delacroix's own notes were copied in order to explain the studies before us.51 It is not certain, however, that the annotations were cop- ies of Delacroix's own, for there may have been reasons for fabricating them. The sketches may have been intended initially for a project never consummated and without any philhellenic bearing at all. The artist might have reviewed them when he was thinking about the Expiring Greece or Liberty, making the clarifying connections and, if Tous- saint is correct in her essential argument, reinforcing his thoughts with annotations. Quite possibly, Delacroix may have removed the studies from his notebooks at the time the new ideas occurred to him. The original motivations behind the mother-savior fig- ure could have been quite personal for the artist. Indeed, with one sketch in the series that Toussaint presents is another of "Moses saved," a woman in Oriental garb kneel- ing protectively over a naked infant, which Toussaint is unable to trace further in the artist's work.52 This image may not be extraneous to a line of thinking in which the artist was searching to express a consolatrice motif, not explicitly with philhellenic overtones. I noted earlier, how- ever, that a consolatrice motif is central to the group of Greek victims on the left in the Massacre of Scio. The stud- ies published by Toussaint provide supporting evidence to link the artist's private iconography to his public commit- ments: the consolatrice who is transformed into Expiring Greece and Liberty. In a letter to his brother, Delacroix described Liberty Guiding the People as a "modern" work.53 The use of alle- gory in an anecdotal setting follows a longstanding tradi- tion.54 What broke iconographic ground was the introduc- tion of allegory into the representation of a topical event, albeit an ennobled one, idealized in a classical manner. The "raft" composition helps to distinguish the two levels of meaning, the universal rising above the particular. Purchased by the Duc d'Orleans and exhibited for four months at the Luxembourg Museum following his inau- guration as the "Bourgeois Monarch," the painting was an immediate success.55 So frightened was Royer-Collard, the Director of Fine Arts, that it could have the power to inspire further rebellion, that he had the work placed in storage apparently without any strong protest from the artist.56 It was not to be shown again until well after the 1848 Rev- olution, by which time Delacroix had estranged himself from popular causes.'7 The work was painted for the sake of his country, Delacroix told his brother; Liberty stands for the freedom of the nation, for all citizens. What is sig- nificant for this paper, however, is her connection with the artist's private views. More exactly, in what sense does she relate to his essential protagonist? The protagonism of both Expiring Greece and Liberty is 49 Ibid., 13 50 Ibid., 10-11. 51 Ibid., 11. 52 Ibid., 14-15. s3 Cited in Mus6e du Louvre, Centenaire d'EugBne Delacroix 1798-1863, Paris, 1963, 49. 54 For a discussion of the function of allegory in painting, see E.

To the critic Thor6 in 1836, Delacroix wrote of the work as an "alle- gorical painting on the events in July"; quoted by Hamilton (as in n. 46), 56. ss The July Monarch commissioned two works to apotheosize the Citizen King, Jemmapes and Valmy, two successful foreign battles of 1792 led by the Girondist General Dumouriez and in which the then Duc d'Orl6ans participated. Delacroix, however, preferred to represent Liberty Guiding the People. See Escholier, i, 268. 56 Royer-Collard's fearful and equivocal attitude toward the armed rebel- lion of July was clearly expressed in his comment: "Moi aussi, je suis des victorieux, triste parmi les victorieux."

Hadjinicolaou finds that favorable or adverse criticism in the journals generally correlated with the political alignments of these journals with the Revolution at the time. As he points out, reactions to the work have continued to change up to our own day. For one painting in 1830, he says, and another in 1831, a long history of interpretations began. 57 For a discussion of Delacroix's embitterment and social alienation after 1848, see Clark (as in n. 45), 126-141.</page><page sequence="13">DELACROIX'S HERO 249 special. The first half-stands, half-kneels in dignity, acquiescent without submission, alone, even deserted, but brave to the end. The second rallies her forces on to victory. Behind Greece and dimly seen in the background is the victorious antagonist. With Liberty, on the other hand, there is no adversary in the painting, since the dead Swiss Guardsman beneath her may be discounted as obviously no longer a challenge. What then is happening7 Does the painting represent a moment after victory7 The vigilance of all indicates that the battle is not over, nor is glory over a vanquished enemy being depicted. The dead soldier is joined at the base by a sansculotte of the hero's side, a detail linking this representation with the Revolution of 1789. Perhaps there are no victors or vanquished, only a whole nation brought together once again under the juste milieu monarchy. This might be a satisfactory explanation of Delacroix's intention were it not for the prominent young man dashingly attired in open tailcoat, trousers, waistcoat, neck cloth, and top hat. This figure holds his weapon at the ready, just as the worker behind him raises a saber for the charge. The young man in top hat has been identified variously as the artist himself, his close friend Frederic Villot, later to become Curator of Paintings at the Louvre, and Arago, the ardent republican propagandist.58 Many years after the painting was done, Dumas ridiculed the notion of the art- ist's presence on the barricades, pointing out Delacroix's ambivalence to the fighting during the July Revolution.59 No one can doubt that Dumas saw the figure as the artist's self-portrait but I do not believe that was Delacroix's main point. For him, the anecdotal figures were types standing for classes of participants, not particular people. If the fig- ure resembled the artist, it was because Delacroix doubtless associated himself with the class it represented. Unlike his several battle scenes or many other anecdotal pieces, there are surprisingly few figures in Liberty Guiding the People. The participants are distinguished by their costumes. Thus, the young man with a top hat, in this context, stands apart from the workers in their aprons, rags, and semi-nudity, the Swiss Guard defending the regime, and even the man in the distance in a Bonapartist cocked hat. He belongs to the generation of dandies, representing that curious blend of liberal nationalism and emigre-influenced autocracy which appeared in France after 1815. The clothing that Delacroix gave to the figure was the uniform of that class.60 Toussaint also sees the various participants as types - she calls the representation "a veritable sociology."61 She indicates the one with raised saber and a protective work apron as the manufacturer and the one kneeling at the feet of Liberty as the rural worker. Regarding the controversial figure holding the gun, whom Toussaint refers to also as the man in the high hat, she disputes any individual identity for him, especially that of the ardent republican Arago with whom Delacroix seemed to have no contact. She suggests that the figure was a composite made from sketches of sev- eral of Delacroix's friends, especially Villot. She interprets the figure as representing an artisan, perhaps a shop fore- man or chief. His high hat, she argues, does not necessarily make him a bourgeois - all citizens of the time wore such hats irrespective of class.62 I do not find this last point convincing. The figure is not, to be sure, stereotypically bourgeois in a post-1840's sense. On the other hand, why is he dressed in leisurely attire, not work clothes, and carrying not a musket, like that held by Liberty, but a hunting piece? Considering the economic development of France prior to 1830, there would be little basis for Delacroix's formulating a "bourgeois" type like those whom Daumier or Balzac would later represent. The entrepreneurial industrialists, Guizot's "jeune ambitieux," had not yet become economically prominent. Other than small manufacturers, artisan laborers, or rural workers, the main visible contributors to French economic life by 1830 were shopkeepers and bankers.63 Of course there were yet others, but the "sociology" of 1830 would probably place 58 Mus"e du Louvre (as in n. 53), 49; and Lee Johnson, Delacroix, New York, 1963, 39.

See also Huyghe, 120ff., and the work cited in n. 43 by the same author, 233-35. Huyghe places dandyism in aesthetic terms, finding it combining classicism and romanticism. On the social and historical aspects of dandyism, see Ellen Moers, The Dandy, New York, 1960. Moers points out the liberal connections of dan- dyism in Restoration France. The dandy "costume" itself was the sign of the young "gentleman" (Bau- delaire used this English word in describing Delacroix - work cited above, 324). According to Geoffrey Squire who comments on the male-oriented effect of the English-inspired attire: "... the clothing of the nineteenth century was the first in history to place sexual appeal prominently before all other considerations. It cannot be without significance that an age which had, by dress and manner, so effectively separated men from women should close the the formulation of sexual psychology." Geoffrey Squire, Dress and Society, New York, 1974, 157. The prominence of the top hat in this attire is generally recognized. See, for example, Millia Dav- enport, The Book of Costume, II, New York, 1948, 800: "The plain English 'round' hat had early Revolutionary connotations, but it was so practical that it made great strides. By 1812 it was universally worn [my comment: in fashionable circles generally], with conical, sugar-loaf, or spreading top-hat crown. Its brim was apt to be rolled up slightly on the sides with a dip over the forehead." See also Blanche Bayne, History of Costume, New York, 1965, 457ff., who indicates that the high hat reached its char- acteristic shape by 1798. 61 Toussaint, 44. 62 Ibid., 49. 63 The Revolution of 1830 legitimized once and for all the new capitalist land tenures that were established after the abolition of feudal property rights in 1789. It placed financiers firmly in control in the Bank of France and the government, and by 1840 this cleared the way for large-scale French industrial capitalism. It was Louis Philippe, the Bourgeois Mon- arch, who encouraged the new economic development. See E. J. Hobs- bawm, The Age of Revolution, 1789-1848, New York, 1962, esp. 212-13; also Schapiro (as in n. 56), 238ff.; and J. H. Clapham, The Economic Development of France and Germany, 1815-1914, 4th ed., Cambridge, 1936, 53. According to E. Levasseur, while mechanization was introduced into cotton textile and chemical manufacturing before the 1840's, until then French industry was, for the most part, essentially petty artisan, rural or cottage.

If Delacroix had planned the painting to represent the salient types of the French nation who rallied around Lib- erty, with which one of these would he identify himself and his friends? He was hardly a manufacturer, an artisan- worker, or a farmer. There is little evidence to find him especially attracted to shopkeepers except as they may also be petty manufacturers. Yet, surely, he would want to include representatives in the painting of his own group of diverse intellectuals, writers, artists, bankers, journalists - who would lead the Bourgeois Monarch and, in the pro- cess, shape a consciousness of "bourgeois" types. Conse- quently, I continue to hold that the concept "dandy" is most accurately associated with the top-hatted youth. This youth captures a secondary focal center. Like Lib- erty, who dominates the work as a whole, he is bracketed compositionally. At the same time, he occupies an interval of space alone. By his axial divergence from the thrust of Liberty's movement, his independence is asserted. Were his figure to be parallel with her image of force, his identity would have been lost in the collective. Delacroix gives us a second theme, consequently, a subordinate "raft" in which the protagonist stands out in contrast, above the emblems of death beneath him. If Liberty develops from the protective Cybele and the consolatrice motif, it may now be possible to see the gamin as the liberated "child" with his "mother" and the top-hat- ted youth as, then, the mature product of their liberation. The complex synthesis that I have followed up to Sardan- apalus may be represented here, and now made more acces- sible as a "positive" image. This provides further insight into the artist's ambivalent attitudes toward women, at least in light of his iconography if not psychology, and it sug- gests how his protagonist emerges progressively in part through his sexual vacillations, defining himself as he defines his women. Like Picasso's Guernica, Delacroix's Liberty reaches deeply into a private world view to provide a public state- ment. The force of the painting in each case depends upon the folding of one into the other. Once the image becomes public - political currency so to speak - it takes on a broad public life apart from any necessary reference to its interior, private connections. The linkage may be such that the artist may not be aware of or care to discuss it. A few clues may link the dandy on the barricades with Sardanapalus. One has more to do with meaning than with form; it is a comment about a philosophy of life in the same letter from Delacroix to Soulier in which he complained about the critical mauling that the Death of Sardanapalus received in Paris. At the end of that letter he reflected: "... let us push on and try to have, before dying, a bit of peace and independence in this sordid world. A little library, some good wines and some other good things. The rest, as my ancient friend Sardanapalus says, is not worth a straw."64 In essence, this is the dandy's point of view. Rudrauf indi- cated Delacroix's orientation to the world as a recognition of a permanent state of ambivalence: "Delacroix would have without doubt taken as his own the resolution of Flaubert: 'Vivons en bourgeois et pensons en demi- dieux.' "65 In the posthumous assessment that I cited earlier, Baudelaire appreciated in the artist an attitude of polite acquiescence in society yet an uncompromising private reserve that marked him as a dandy.66 In this regard, the young man on the barricades seems the godchild of Sardanapalus. A second clue connects the two more in form. In a study for Liberty Guiding the People (Fig. 17), in the righthand corner, the artist drew a profile of a young man, scowling, recalling the visage of Sardanapalus. On top of the head, seemingly as a secondary thought, he sketched in broad wash lines a top hat placed rakishly to the side. Though the idea was never picked up for the painting, its presence in Delacroix's thoughts during the preparations is reveal- ing. But of course the two clues are insufficient to make a strong case. That a standing protagonist is asserted on the barricades may be a breakthrough to the full expression of independence.67 It seems worthwhile, however, to review briefly Dela- croix's use of standing male figures before Liberty. This may supply other strands of thought that went into the artist's formulation of his protagonist. They may be divided between those who appear alone and those in groups; the numbers in parentheses are those assigned by Robaut in his catalogue raisonne of the artist's work.68 The review can hardly be definitive and there will be several instances where connections would be farfetched, but some main lines of meaning are discernible which together contribute to an understanding of the protagonist of 1830. First, there are the several examples of "twin" standing figures. Dante and Virgil and Faust with Mephistopheles have already been discussed. The lithograph of Hamlet with Horatio contemplating the skull of Yorick (No. 286) of 1828, like the earlier works, conveys a mood of reflection, doubt, or even indecision, which certainly suits the image of Ham- let, especially in the scene that Delacroix chose to depict. Next are the many examples in which a standing male figure is represented alone. Some of these are Orientals: The Persian Ambassador of 1817 (No. 10) who is shown in Oriental costume and holding a saber, The Favorite Slave of the Ambassador also of 1817 (No. 11), and two water- colors of 1828, one of a Turk saddling his horse (No. 284) and the other of a Mameluke restraining his (No. 285). No new insights seem to be gained from these to add to what is already known about Delacroix's interest in the Orient. 64 Quoted in English translation by Spector (as in n. 33), 105. 65 Rudrauf, 48. 66 Baudelaire, 326. 67 There is a possible tie even back to Dante. On the reverse side of a pen- and-ink study of Dante's so-called death mask - a profile view - Dela- croix made several studies for Sardanapalus.

The stance of this figure, holding a rifle at the ready, is strikingly like that of the top-hatted dandy of 1830. The difference is mainly in the costume. The oil was copied by Villot in an engraving, so the image must have been spread among many in the philhellenic movement. Other single figures include a self-portrait as Scott's tragic hero Ravenswood of 1819 (No. 40), portraits of M. J6r6me, an artist, of 1825 (No. 119) and of Delacroix's good friend Baron Schwiter, of 1826 (No. 190), a Venetian Gentleman of 1828 (No. 273) which Robaut describes as done in the manner of Bonington "... being absolutely romantic," an 1829 lithograph of Vercingetorix, the valiant foe of Caesar (Nos. 311-12), and of the same year an oil of Louis XI (No. 318), known for his important reform measures, a fact that might have wanted recalling to the monarchy of 1829. All of these, varying in specific meanings, share a common quality of respectability. Unlike the mounted Turk of the Massacre or, possibly, Sardanapalus, they are positive in import. Finally, there are several works in which the standing protagonist takes part in a confrontation. There are two from the life of Jesus: Jesus Led Before Caiaphas of 1818 (No. 16) and Jesus Before Pilate (No. 22) produced in the following year. A lithograph of Macbeth consulting the witches (No. 117) of 1825 is not confrontational in the same sense, and the positiveness of this particular hero is ques- tionable. The most important of Delacroix's early con- frontational situations, however, is seen in the Massacre of the Bishop of Liege, based on a scene in Scott's Quentin Durward. He produced two representations of this event, a preparatory work in 1827 (No. 196) and the final oil of 1829 (No. 292).69 There are several others which do not fit easily into these categories, but they do not seem to offer any emphatic alternatives. What conclusions may be drawn from this inventory? It may be suggested that Delacroix saw the standing male figure, prior to 1830, as an independent sol- itary in one sense and, when confronted by another figure, as an uncompromising opponent. If the doubt of Dante, Faust, and Hamlet is added to this, the syncretic and yet complex representation that emerges may be what stands with Liberty in 1830 and provides the prototype for what followed in 1831. In that year, when the retrenching Orleanists were quell- ing new revolts and seeking a juste milieu of constitutional monarchy, Delacroix entered his Boissy d'Anglas at the Convention (Fig. 18) in the competition that Guizot, then Minister of the Interior, arranged. Guizot's purpose was to obtain paintings on given subjects to decorate the Chamber of Deputies assembly room in the Palais Bourbon. He chose two themes, both clearly motivated by ideological consid- erations. Of the countless themes from the first French Rev- olution, the canny minister settled on two that would jus- tify and epitomize the new July Monarchy.70 One, the marriage of monarchy and freedom, was rep- resented by the Oath of the King, an event that occurred on August 12, 1789; the painting shows Louis XVI with crown and red cockade. It would confront the legislators on one side. The other, Boissy d'Anglas at the Convention, would appear on the opposite wall to remind the Deputies of the limits of "Liberte Francaise." This subject was based on events during the 1st of Prair- ial iii RF (May 20, 1795) when, despite threats to his life, Boissy d'Anglas refused to accede to the Jacobin-inspired Constitution of 1793 and to the demands of rioting Pari- 69 See Beth Segal Wright, "Scott's Historical Novels and French Historical Painting 1815-1855," Art Bulletin, LXIII, 1981, 279-280. Wright points out that "Delacroix situates his mob of small and vehemently gesturing figures on a diagonal into depth, illuminated by blazing torches." She does not indicate that the main figure is placed within the mob, though by a variety of pictorial and structural means opposing its surge like a dam before a torrential river. The difference between this use of the diagonal and that of G6ricault, twenty years before in the Raft of the Medusa, is noteworthy. (See my comment on the latter in the text above.) In addition, the transformational connection with Boissy d'Anglas at the Convention, to be discussed in the text below, is worth consideration. 70 M. Francois-Pierre Guillaume Guizot, Memoires pour servir a l'histoire de mon temps, II, Paris, 1859, 70; my translation from the French: We [i.e. Guizot, as Minister of the Interior] had to rule on the interior decoration of the assembly room of the Chamber of Deputies. It was decided that this would be composed of three large paintings and two statues, placed above and on each side of the president's desk. At the center, The Oath of the King, in the meeting of August 9, when the Chambers had bestowed the crown on him. At the right, The Consti- tutional Assembly, after the royal meeting of June 23, 1789, and Mir- abeau replying to M. de Braze: "Go tell those who sent you that we are here by the power of the people and that we will leave only by force of bayonets."

Two great souvenirs, one of resistance to power, the other of resistance to anarchy. The two statues were to be two allegorical figures, Order and Liberty.

Bordeaux, Mus&amp;e de Bordeaux sians for bread. Less than a year after the Thermidorian Reaction (July 28, 1794), he helped to dissipate once and for all the remnants of the political left of the time. The critical moment and lasting symbol of that day involved Boissy d'Anglas' dauntless courage before the ghastly sev- ered head of Deputy F&amp;raud - who had attempted to defend him - which had been impaled on a pike and thrust to his face as a threat. Historical accounts state that Boissy d'Anglas bowed his head reverentially to that of his unfor- tunate defender and remained calm.71 This moment captured bourgeois imagination immedi- ately. There are several engravings of the scene dating from the early decades of the nineteenth century, including one by Duplessi-Bertaux in the monumental Tableaux histo- riques de la Revolution Frangaise, ii, published about 1801.72 In the Salon of 1796 Joseph Ducreux, popular por- traitist and miniaturist of the time, exhibited a painting on the theme, which, according to Renouvier, received great acclaim at its showing.73 In Guizot's contest of 1831, Court won the award for his 71 See Mercure universal, l'an troisieme de la Republique franCaise, Floreal LI, Paris, 50. Boissy d'Anglas is described as: ... preserv[ing] in this terrible moment the firm and calm attitude of a representative filled with the dignity of office and the place that is entrusted to him. With his head covered, braving threats and insults, he remains firm and unshakable. ... all of a sudden, the head of the unfortunate F&amp;rraud [sic] is seen entering the room carried at the end of a pikel It is advanced up to the desk of the president; nothing intimidates the president. He makes no gesture of indignation or timidity [... il ne lui bchappe aucun geste d'in- dignation ni de timidite] (my translation). No mention is made here, however, of the respectful gesture to F&amp;raud's head, but several other authoritative accounts (Aulard, Carlyle) do include this detail, after C. F. Beaulieu, Essais Historiques ..., vi, Paris, 1803, 182: "... the head is presented to the President, who bows with respect [qui s'incline avec respect ..."] (my translation). Adolphe Thiers gives a somewhat different account which puts the insurrectionists in a more barbaric light (Histoire de la Revolution Fran- iaise, vII, Paris, 1827, 424). Albert Mathiez plays down the role of Boissy d'Anglas and is more sympathetic to the revolt (Mathiez, After Robes- pierre ..., trans. Catherine Alison Phillips, New York, 1931, 204-211). 72 Duplessi-Bertaux views the scene from the opposite end of the room from Delacroix. It is difficult to see from the engraving whether the Pres- ident's hat is on or not. He is shown standing and leaning over or back, away from the observer. The written account in the text (p. 463) follows the description (already quoted in n. 71) from the Mercure universel and is therefore at variance with the image by Duplessi-Bertaux. An engraving on the theme designed by Monnet (b. 1730-still living in 1808) and engraved by Helman appears in Jacques Boussard, Atlas historique et culturel de la France, pref. Jean Alazard, Paris-Brussels, 1957, 127, No. 23. In this representation, probably from the first years of the 19th century, Boissy d'Anglas is again seen standing, but his action is difficult to interpret. A number of engravings on the theme appear in the various editions of the work of Adolphe Thiers (as in n. 71); in the edition of 1859 there is one designed by Raffet (facing p. 193), ca. 1835, which shows the President standing and surrounded by a menacing crowd. Another depiction by the same artist but viewing the scene from the same orientation as Delacroix's was published in an English edition of Thiers's work in London, 1895. Boissy d'Anglas is given a plumed hat, which he is decidedly tipping to F&amp;raud's head (facing p. 214). In the French edition of 1834 there is an engraving after a drawing by Tony Johannot probably of the same year, showing the President in the act of removing his hat to F&amp;raud's head. Here the observer is placed in the crowd behind F&amp;raud's head and looking up to the President who, surrounded by insurgents, stands behind his desk. 73 See Collections des livrets des anciennes expositions ..., Salon de 1796, xxxIx, Paris, 1871, 30, No. 140: "Boissy d'Anglas, presiding at the Con- vention, the 1st of Prairial ...

Vin- chon's work shows the protagonist seated nobly upon his elevated chair, and everywhere about and below him indi- viduals and groups are engaged in a variety of disparate activities. Apparently the artist wished to contrast their basic disunity with Boissy d'Anglas' singleness of purpose. Vinchon did not violate historical fact: the protagonist is bare-headed, continuing to preside - hence, he is seated. Of the fifty entries on this theme that were exhibited at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Louis Boulanger singled out Delacroix's as the best. He wrote that it was: ... an immense magnificent painting, full of an intimate and true poetry, of an admirable execution, with brilliant color, rich in subordinate episodes and yet unified, intel- ligible, consolidated, tied tightly as a drama and varied as an epic. We are not afraid to state and affirm in advance what other generations will not contradict: it is one of the most beautiful compositions that has ever been found in painting.74 The critic observed how one is first struck by the overall "arabesque" composition before noting the small, brilliant, stirring features. This compositional unity, I submit, was owed to Delacroix's developed comprehension of the hero - someone so matching his own attitudes.75 The artist was able to submerge details to the massed effect because such was precisely his recognition of "society" beneath the "indi- vidual" protagonist. The "raft" motive found first in the Bark of Dante had been developed to maturity. Above a storming sea of humanity surging up to the president's desk, stands the defiant protagonist, top-hatted. Boulanger was fully aware of Delacroix's departure from accuracy, but as he wrote: "... the scene, such as M. Dela- croix understood and composed it, though not given by history is profoundly probable, and by consequence for art, profoundly true."76 Detail is not distracting; movement runs swiftly from head to arm, to musket to sword, unable to hold any lingering inspection. Even Feraud's horrifying head on the pike is barely visible - to the dissatisfaction of the judges of 1831 - amid the other spots of light and color that shift and twist across the multitude. Only the large, bright elongated triangle of Boissy d'Anglas is suf- ficiently arresting to offset, collect, and finally terminate the movement beneath. The hero's hat is on, as no other version that I have found shows (in fact, it would seem to contradict the necessary respect for Feraud in the conven- tional sense of etiquette), perhaps because, for Delacroix, Boissy d'Anglas cannot be less than the covered soldiers and citizens around him, but also because he is the essential new citizen - the jeune ambitieux whose generation Gui- zot applauded - who appeared with Liberty on the bar- ricades the year before. The jury of artists, probably with David's lessons in mind, failed to find the "intimate and true poetry" that Boulanger felt. The present argument would be better served had the jury selected Delacroix's work, but the pro- cesses that engage human minds are more complex and not so exactly synchronized. Delacroix had projected a sub- jective truth. Not bound in taste to the classical cliches that public commissions required, Boulanger could sense this. Although governments would still need and commission history paintings in the grand manner, the old-style hero who might inhabit such pieces was dead. Without his living soul the versions of them that continued to be produced became, of necessity, drier and emptier shells. The new pro- tagonist that Delacroix was among the first to understand could not exist in the older environment: he was perma- nently at odds with society. Between the years 1822 and 1831, as I have tried to show, Delacroix's protagonist changed from a personality split between social concern, weak as it was, and egocentric detachment to one who was completely a-social, detached, and self-possessed. This is the "heroism" of disengagement, rappelle l'assemblbe au calme] (my translation).

A contemporary critic of Ducreux, "Polyscope," writing in Decadaire, an VII R.E, observed: "Even if it were possible, it was at least very difficult to render that double action [i.e. the two actions given in the Livret description]; moreover, the artist has not rendered it at all. One does not know what this man is doing or wishes to do. [This man] is shown to us entirely nude, standing, two hands extended, his eyes have some incompre- hensively vague expression that cannot relate any distinct sentiment ... A merit of this portrait is in being a perfect resemblance."

For Toussaint, the meaning of Delacroix's painting is in sharp contrast with the positive effect of his Liberty. She sees the people playing the essential role with Boissy d'Anglas about to be swallowed up in the human tide. Toussaint, 42. Robaut records sixteen drawings and sketches for the painting but does not mention specifically or separately the small oil sketch now in the Smith College Museum of Art, Northampton, Massachusetts, which agrees in essential details with the larger finished canvas. See Robaut, No. 1563. 75 In his letter of March, 1831, to the Director of L'artiste, Delacroix expressed himself pessimistically concerning the jury system of the Con- cours. He felt that an acceptable mediocrity would always have the advan- tage over talent in the choice between "... la plate exactitude, ou g l'ex- ecution sup&amp;rieure." Without mentioning his own work in the competition, he doubtless had it in mind. See Delacroix, 1935, 268-276. Philippe Burty, in his edition of the letters, Paris, 1878, gives the date as April, 1831. Huyghe contrasts the "violent Boissy d'Anglas" with the artist's "bal- anced and rectilinear Mirabeau", the latter, now in the Ny Carlsberg Glyp- totek in Copenhagen, was also produced for the competition. This piece, Mirabeau Protesting to the Marquis de Dreux-Brbzb, did not receive any critical acclaim when it was first exhibited, if I may argue ex silentio. It still seems much less successful. I suggest that the difference in content between the two is crucial: Mirabeau is remonstrating with his peers while Boissy d'Anglas separates himself from the mob.
