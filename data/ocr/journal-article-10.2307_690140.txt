<plain_text><page sequence="1">Egg Timers, Human Values, and the Care of Autistic Youths Ruud Hendriks University Maastricht This article argues that autistic people occasionally experience greater comfort from imposed routines than from a yielding form of love and understanding, which I will call naive humanism. Collins's theory of action, with its attention toward the achievements residing in a reductionist approach, can help to point out the flaws of a naive humanistic stance. It would, however, be a mistake to stop at this point and remain satisfied with the problem-solving capacity of such a reductionist stance. In a ward for autistic youths, the risk of cruelty resides in a purely mechanistic stance as much as in a naive humanistic approach. Thus, the social context of care of autistic people urges us to question the scope of a traditional scheme of thought, which cherishes a deep distinction between humans and machines. Introduction "In May of 1989, I drove 1,200 miles to attend the 10th annual TEACCH1 conference, where I learned that autistic people can't drive." Jim Sinclair (1992, 294), the author of these words, is a (high functioning) autistic man himself. Indeed it can be considered an achievement when a person with autism learns to struggle his way through the complex web of traffic rules. It is also quite unique for an autistic person to make a reflexive remark on this point. Many people with autism are hardly able to read even the simplest of social cues. It is extremely hard for them to discern order in the subtleties of AUTHOR'S NOTE: I am most grateful to the people working at W. who kindly welcomed me into their midst, who shared their stories and experiences with me, and thus enabled me to do my fieldwork. I am also grateful to the residents at W. Although they could not have a voice allowing me in, it is my hope they are the main characters in my work.

And traffic rules, in spite of their formal status in theory, are hardly less elusive in the practice of modem city life. Normally speaking, children require only a minimum of social stimulation to add meaning to their observations. They start to engage in human commu- nication from very early on, and within a few years, they begin to understand human behavior as meaningful action and to behave in socially appropriate ways. People with autism appear to be impaired precisely in this respect: in the ability "to go beyond" bare registration and break away from the imme- diately given (Frith [1989] 1993; Peeters 1994).2 Their inability to recognize regular patterns on a metalevel may drive autistic people to focus on explicit rules and concrete regularities instead. Such a tendency to literal-mindedness is expressed in a triad of impairments (Wing and Gould 1979). Persons with autism are impaired in their social abilities, in verbal and nonverbal communication, and in their imaginative activities.3 In this article, I will focus especially on impairments in the social realm. Ordinary social life with its countless symbolically mediated mean- ings, its ambiguous signs, and elusive conventions proves extremely difficult to grasp for most autistic persons. Has Jim Sinclair recovered from autism, now that he has learned to drive a car? What his account tells us is that people with autism do have feelings and do wish to communicate with others. What is more, it shows that people with autism, in spite of their impairments, may develop social, communica- tional, and imaginative skills and may even find pleasure in widening the scope of their actions. On the other hand, this does not mean that no autistic symptoms remain. Sinclair does not want to be cured of his autism. To him autism is not necessarily a burden, and he regards problems he encounters as stemming as much from normality inscribed in daily life as from autism itself. Not all the gaps are caused by my failure to share other people's unthinking assumptions. Other people's failure to question their assumptions creates at least as many barriers to understanding. (Sinclair 1992, 296) Difficulties originating from the incompatibility between the autistic and nonautistic world are pervasive throughout Sinclair's life. He has tried hard to cope, he has learned how to survive, but he still feels he is "terribly ill-equipped to survive in this world, like an extraterrestrial stranded without an orientation manual" (p. 302). People with autism will only be able to find comfort in society if the efforts to adapt are mutual rather than demanded of autistic people only. Sinclair pleads for making room in society at large for an autistic form of life. This article discusses the implications of Sinclair's</page><page sequence="3">Hendriks / Egg Timers and Human Values 401 call to "recognize that we are equally alien to each other" (p. 302) for familiar, nonautistic ideas about what constitutes the social. This is not the proper place to discuss how best to provide comfort to autistic people. However, I do think that an analysis of the kinds of adapta- tions that are required in the care of autistic persons bears directly on a central issue in the field of STS: the dividing line between humans and machines. To make this link explicit, I will explore how the impairments of autistic persons and the way their problems are approached illuminate, complicate, and confuse ways in which distinctions between human and machinelike actions and behaviors are traditionally drawn. This article draws on theoretical as well as empirical data deriving from literature search, interviews, and ethnographic research done in a ward for mentally handicapped autistic youths.4 The Machine Metaphor in Autism Of all symptoms in autism, none has attracted more interest than the impairment of social and interpersonal relationships. Already in his seminal 1943 article, Kanner observed: "There is from the start an extreme autistic aloneness that, whenever possible, disregards, ignores, shuts out anything that comes to the child from the outside" (p. 233). According to Kanner, the world of people-among-themselves seems to be a closed domain for autistic children. "It would be wrong to say that they were not aware of the presence of persons. But the people, so long as they left the child alone, figured in about the same manner as did the desk, the bookshelf, or the filing cabinet" (p. 246). In a more recent volume on autism, Wing notes "an overwhelming difficulty in acquiring and understanding the multitudinous rules of social life and developing empathy with others" (Wing 1992, 131), even though she is discussing high-functioning individuals with autism.5 Phrased in a sociologist's vocabulary, people with autism might be de- scribed as undersocialized human beings: depending on the severity of their condition, autistic children grow up in a more or less complete social void. Consequently, they seem to have problems in making sense of meaningful human action, which can only be properly understood by those who are brought up in the social community where the subtle rules of two-way social intercourse find their foundation. People with autism are particularly im- paired in grasping those forms of meaningful human action in which the underlying rules cannot be formalized. For instance, they have difficulties in understanding the point of a joke or in reading a message between the lines.</page><page sequence="4">402 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values The problem is that most of our rules governing social and interpersonal functioning are especially subtle, situational, or abstract. In addition, they are not generally articulated but rather deduced by most nonhandicapped people during their developmental years. Simple rules like how far one should stand from another person when talking are easily deduced by most people. However, the autistic youngster, already deficient in rule-governed concepts, finds understanding these many social conventions to be extremely overwhelming. Humor, another important social and interpersonal process that often involves suddenly altered expectations and conventions, is also difficult for autistic people for the same reason. (Mesibov 1986, 268) The autistic inability to discern order beyond the level of the literal and concrete may often lead to a certain literal-mindedness. There is a rigid quality in the autistic person's social and cognitive style which may tempt one to conceive of them as a class of people who display typically machine- like characteristics. Uta Frith, for instance, relates how robots may very well capture the rigid and nonsocialized features of autism, at least on a metaphori- cal level. Obedient to logical principles, robots are untouched by all that matters in ordinary human relationships .... Like autistic people early robots have no sense of humour, and are utterly literal in their understanding.... As a meta- phor for Autism robots serve well in many respects.... Robots carry out jobs that they are specialized for, without concern for wider aspects, with precision and, above all, in an unvarying routine. The machine-like behaviour reminds us of many characteristics of Autistic behaviour: We see repetitiveness, stereo- typed movements, lack of emotional expression and lack of spontaneous playfulness. (Frith [1989] 1993, 46-47) Descriptions of autism in terms of robots or machines are contested because they risk literal rather than metaphorical interpretations, suggesting total equation of autistic persons and machines. This raises philosophical and normative objections. For example, one might argue that to think about a person as a mere organism or a machine does not do justice to a minded entity (Elton 1998 [this issue]). Moreover, such comparisons tend to ignore per- sonal accounts of people with autism and research in this field, both demon- strating that the autistic person's "lack of understanding of the subtle rules of social interaction and communication does not necessarily indicate an absence of feeling or of a desire for a relationship" (Mesibov 1992, 140).6 Also, when such comparisons are taken too literally, the individual differ- ences between (young) people with autism and their developmental potential (especially among the more able) tend to be overlooked.7 High-functioning people with autism criticize sharply a monolithic conception of autistic</page><page sequence="5">Hendriks / Egg Timers and Human Values 403 persons as rigid, machinelike, and humorless participants in human society.8 Oliver Sacks (1995) even reports of autistic in-jokes (precisely on the assumed need for explicit rules and formalizations) in an Asperger's syn- drome9 family he visited. Everything seemed perfectly normal, he writes. It was only after I had settled down that I noticed the well-used trampoline, where the whole family, at times, likes to jump and flap their arms; the huge library of science fiction; the strange cartoons pinned to the bathroom wall; and the ludicrously explicit directions, pinned up in the kitchen, for cooking, laying the table, and washing up-suggesting that these had to be performed in a fixed, formulaic way (this, I learned later, was an autistic in-joke). (Sacks 1995, 263) The same family, however, notwithstanding their sense of humor and their quasi-normal lifestyle, wrestled with persisting difficulties to understand social conventions. "We know the rules and conventions of the 'normal,' but there is no actual transit. You act normal, you learn the rules, and obey them, but..." "You learn to ape human behavior," her husband interpolated. "I still don't understand what's behind the social conventions. You observe the front-but..." (Sacks 1995, 263) If persons with autism can be understood as people with machinelike characteristics at all, it is only metaphorically so. And if they can be conceived as nonsocialized persons, it is only relatively so. Although I am inevitably generalizing about the rich and ambiguous life-world of people with autism, and deliberately reducing much of the variation among members of this group,'? I believe that autism does offer an opportunity to study how ordinar- ily socialized actors (such as counselors in the ward) manage to deal with the relatively nonsocialized (such as people with autism) in their midst. This is particularly interesting, because it allows us to observe how both groups encounter obstacles in their interactions and sometimes manage to solve these problems. Collins's theory of action is used here to cast new light on these issues. Collins's theory of action was originally developed in the context of the debates on human-machine interactions, with a special focus on problems in artificial intelligence (Collins 1990). Collins argues that to learn how to react appropriately to the continuously changing circumstances of social life, one has to be brought up by people who correct one's mistakes. Going through a process of socialization is the only way to learn the subtle rules of the social community which enable one to carry out what Collins calls polimorphic</page><page sequence="6">404 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values action.II Machines, however, are not raised by people the way children are. Thus, one would not expect machines to be part of society, except maybe as the "strangest of strangers." Yet, machines and people sometimes do mingle very well. How can this be? According to Collins, the boundary between humans and machines dis- appears for a certain class of acts only. For the nonsocialized to be able to mix with the socialized in a more or less trouble-free way, the socialized simulate the behavior of the nonsocialized. They try to restrict themselves to what Collins calls mimeomorphic action (or "machinelike action"). These are actions where exact reproduction of the (external) behavior by someone who did not understand (the meaning or purpose of) an action, would appear to reproduce the action to someone who did understand the action. In the case of polimorphic action, on the contrary, only the enculturated can see "same- ness" properly, and reproduce the action. If an action is mimeomorphic, then a description of the movements associated with the action can be captured in space-time coordinates. "Playing back" the space time coordinates through an appropriate robot will, as far as an outside observer can see, reproduce the action, even though the entity that reproduces it may be without relevant socialization. (Collins, de Vries, and Bijker 1997, 269)12 We can exemplify these two types of action with reference to autistic behavior: an autistic person may pay compliments to the cook by reproducing and following exactly the rules others have taught him. But the truly encul- turated would probably have noticed the subtle difference in behavior in a situation in which the intended result of the cook's efforts has turned out to be an evident disaster. For the nonautistic observer, "paying compliments to the cook" would no longer be the same as "being polite." The mere mimicking of the learned behavior might have proved successful when a piece of production-line work was at stake-an instance of a mimeomorphic act par excellence, where "sameness" can also (or even better) be achieved by a smooth-running machine. In the situation sketched above, however, a non- socialized actor is not well prepared. A competent member of the community would have seen quite another (polimorphic) act, because the context has altered, even though the formal rules were followed with iron discipline. The gap can be traced back to what Collins holds to be a fundamental difference between socialized and nonsocialized understandings of "doing the same thing." I have no intention of equating interpersonal contacts found in social intercourse between counselors and autistic youths with human-machine interactions, but I believe their comparison can be illuminating.</page><page sequence="7">Hendriks / Egg Timers and Human Values 405 First, I will apply Collins's vocabulary to everyday life in the ward. How do autistic and nonautistic people interact with each other? How do counsel- ors manage to bridge the gap between the socialized and the relatively nonsocialized ways of being? A possible answer may be found in the concept of restriction: helping autistic people to see order in ordinary social life means that counselors should strive to avoid much of the richness and subtleties of polimorphic action and to act mimeomorphically instead. Polimorphic ac- tion, however, is also part of daily life in the ward, and given the specific context, it is often accompanied by problems. Second, the empirical data will be used to reflect critically on Collins's distinction. Although counselors and others obviously have difficulty in formulating an alternative, they are not satisfied with a dualistic account of their everyday work in the ward. Sometimes, they stress in particular the need to circumvent fundamental distinctions between human and machinelike action. I will argue that such ideas have consequences for the dichotomy of humans and machines, underlying familiar, nonautistic ideas about what constitutes the social. Reductionism Monday 20 June, late shift Sitting at the table at five o'clock in the evening. It is fairly silent, with only some short remarks every now and then. An egg timer rings. Peter, a big guy, seventeen years of age, covers his slice of bread with chocolate flakes and starts to eat. As soon as the sandwich is finished, he picks up the egg timer standing in front of him and hands it to the counselor. She sets the clock at ten minutes. Peter waits. He waits for the ring with perfect patience. As soon as the egg timer rings, Peter continues his meal. When the last bit of the sandwich is swallowed, he again hands over the egg timer and the whole ritual is repeated. Mealtime continues in this fashion until four sandwiches have been eaten, three quarters of an hour have passed, and the time has come to clear the table. While the others are leaving the table, Peter places his chair with neat precision along a seam in the carpet. Then he leaves as well.13 During this meal, the regular means by which people attune their behavior to one another's expectations appear to be blocked. Peter, for instance, does not seem to know what "waiting" or "appropriate" table behavior mean. I am told this is because Peter is an autistic person. His awkwardness at the table exemplifies the autistic inability to deal with social conventions. He would finish his meal in a rush, and a turbulent evening meal would be guaranteed if there were no egg timer to provide comfort.</page><page sequence="8">406 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values Peter doesn't know what "waiting" is. Because what's waiting? How long does it take? You can try to explain it to him a hundred times.... We know that, waiting for a train, yes, it will come .... But I think that in autism there's a completely different concept; that they do know something about waiting, but... I don't know how this works, but you can solve this by saying: if the egg timer rings, then the waiting is done, or: if all the sand has run through the hourglass, then it's done. That way you make it very concrete.14 For the sake of the argument, let us consider Peter's behavior as a result of his inability to join in polimorphic action. Furthermore, let us consider the use of an egg timer and comparable actions counselors initiate in their care of people with autism as mimeomorphic in nature. In order to reduce the particular kind of problems people with autism encounter in ordinary social intercourse, counselors provide them with physical means to bypass incom- prehensible social cues, with formal expressions to connect what would otherwise remain implicit. Yes, the trick is that you must. . . well, to externalize might be too easy an expression, but it's almost like materializing the kind of connections that we in our brains so easily ... physical yes. The remark that "to externalize might be too easy an expression" is appropriate, since it allows us to stipulate that it would be wrong to conclude that the distinction between polimorphic and mimeomorphic action "is simply the difference between what is 'inside' humans and what is 'outside'" (Collins, de Vries, and Bijker 1997, 269): the behavioral rules for a mimeo- morphic action can, among others, be internalized by a person (by a coun- selor, for instance). Instead of overwhelming Peter with abstract information which presumes a high level of social skills, an egg timer is fixed at ten minutes. What for an autistic person would be a highly complex message such as "Please wait a minute Peter, it's not very gezellig15 if you finish your meal in a rush" is transformed into an unambiguous physical signal. A mimeomorphic quasi- translation is made of the elusive polimorphic action Peter does not seem able to join in. (I say "quasi" because concepts like gezelligheid according to Collins are supposed to be of a socialized and open-ended nature, and are thus irreducible to formal rules.) Another striking story to illustrate the pervasive inability of people with autism to cope with the yielding rules of social intercourse and the difficulty of formulating mimeomorphic detours runs as follows: Take this young man who had learned how to date a girl. He had learned what kind of things belong to dating a girl. His counselors had given dating a</page><page sequence="9">Hendriks / Egg Timers and Human Values 407 concrete form: it means going to the movies together, eating ice cream together, a lot of things like that. And this man had a girlfriend and everybody was satisfied, until the day that he came to his counselor and said: I must have a new girlfriend. And his counselor said: gosh, did you have words, or did you guys break up? But this autistic person didn't understand these words. Until the counselor asked the right question, and then the man said: well, yes, it's all spent, because we went to see the movies, and we had an ice cream, and ... well, you see, I've done it all and now it's finished.16 They forgot to make a loop in the program, I said jokingly to my resource person, and we laughed. But we were also aware of what Theo Peeters once called "the horrible lack of meaning" in the lives of people with autism (Meire 1994). One thing is clear: to cope with the specific problems people with autism encounter in social relationships, "we" should radically change our tack. A possible (although, as we will see further on, by no means unproblematic) conceptualization of the adaptations required here is to restrict ourselves. Framed in terms of Collins's theory of action, in interactions with autistic persons, counselors must act in a mimeomorphic way. Such an approach resonates with the concept of structure used in reports about the ward. Structure is one of the keywords in treating autistic persons. The concept of structure is related to what we would like to call the essence of autism: not seeing the relations, the meaning, the sense of things. Structuring then refers to all activities that are meant to clarify those connections, for instance by making them simple and explicit, by making them visible using means which sometimes look ridiculously naive to us. (de Jaegher 1989, 3) Another important source of inspiration for this approach in the ward is provided by the TEACCH program. The program is described as a simulation model of ordinary life and its symbolically mediated meanings in terms which are more easily understood by autistic persons. It's a continuous description. TEACCH describes the continuous provi- sions that are needed by people with autism. You couldn't imagine how odd: recreation, working, meeting their parents, social behaviour, commu- nication. In fact it's ordinary human life translated in autistic terms, with everything that belongs to it.17 The key for successful translation of ordinary life into autistic terms seems to lie in generating specific, explicit, and very structured rules that autistic people can learn and follow. For instance, a rule may be given for when, where, and for how long one should talk about one's hobbies, and that one should not forget to ask the other about hers as well. Sometimes, however, such discursive rules say so little that other means have to be found to provide</page><page sequence="10">408 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values comfort. Such is the case in the ward for autistic youths in W. Here order has to be made even more transparent. So why not use pictures instead of words? Or even better, "If sometimes words say so little, cannot objects speak for themselves?" (Peeters 1994, 39). Accordingly, the resident who does not seem to know anymore what a day is all about is shown what his day will look like. Acupboard is emptied and filled with objects such as a dish, a small model of a chair, and a washing glove. These things seem to refer to the coming events in a straightforward, literal manner. This way, pupils with autism (sometimes for the first time in their life) experience that life is not dominated by chance, but that there is a link between an object and the activity that follows, that a visual symbol has a "meaning." (Peeters 1994, 103) The extension of sociality is effectuated by offering autistic persons specific, concrete rules. But to what end? What if one of these youths does not see the point of, let us say, going for a walk? What if he does not see what good there is in remaining seated while drinking lemonade, to mention only a few of the simple social activities of everyday life in the ward?'8 These are activities which have their point in an invisible, social nature which will not instantly mobilize autistic people. How to make clear why, if the "why" is so difficult to understand? Again, the answer seems to lie in a change of bearings. Evidence may have to be sought in a much more concrete form. Thus, one has to consider offering a visible, more tangible goal to reach for. "Here a conceptual, social why is replaced by its observational equivalent: to see the final goal, sometimes is enough" (Peeters 1994, 63). Offering a concrete order seems easier said than done, although it may very well be the other way around: perhaps our linguistic habits and our inclination to look for hidden meanings often prevent us from seeing how to adjust. Possibly, a glimpse of the difficulty for ordinary language-users to adjust, to purposefully forget about the "why" and to recover or reinvent the evident form, is mirrored in Wittgenstein's observation that people who are constantly asking "why" are like tourists who stand in front of a building reading Baedeker and are so busy reading the history of its construction, etc., that they are prevented from seeing the building. (Wittgenstein 1980, 40)</page><page sequence="11">Hendriks / Egg Timers and Human Values 409 Humanism Thursday 16 June, early shift One of the counselors, Marc, has cooked a warm meal. I think he has done a fine job. So do most of the residents I guess. One of them, Rick, refuses to eat. It's not the first time this happens. Lately, Rick is so locked up in his compulsions that he cannot seem to find a way out of them. I watch him kneel down on the floor and lick the ground incessantly, tap the shoulders of his neighbor and ask Marc whether he may leave the table. Another counselor, who's keeping an eye on the meal from the back of the room, reacts as follows: "Oh Rick! Marc did his utmost to cook a nice meal and now you don't want it! That is not very nice for Marc, is it?!" The remark doesn't seem to have any positive effect. Instead Rick's behavior becomes ever more compulsive. Fi- nally the counselors see themselves obliged to send Rick to the backroom, if only to keep the meal pleasant for the others. We have seen how those working with autistic youths take physical objects, routines, and structures as a model for treatment. This is not to say that autistic lives have to be structured from beginning to end or that offered routines may never be loosened. Everyday life in the ward involves much more than making an effort to simulate egg timers. For example, to teach the residents to cope with an unpredictable world, contingencies are sometimes introduced on purpose. Thus, a route different from that expected by the residents can be chosen during a walk. Still, counselors are expected to develop a basic, reductionist attitude toward these special persons and to provide them with a steady background of expectations to fall back upon. Such an attitude, however, is not easily realized in everyday practice. Coun- selors do their utmost to be as regular as egg timers, but they often fail in these efforts. Notwithstanding the fact that they know they should not do so, counselors' behavior often deviates from the structured care people with autism supposedly need. By relying on a repertoire of polimorphic action in a situation where they should provide comfort with an egg timer or a mimeomorphic equivalent, counselors appear to be guilty of mixing up categories. For instance, they wrongly think that being strict tout court-which sometimes appears to be quite similar to mimeomorphic action-is the same thing as offering a formal</page><page sequence="12">410 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values structure in the mimeomorphic sense. Thus, the counselors decide to send Rick away from the table when he is considered to be difficult. To Rick, however, reasons for the counselor's severe behavior will most likely remain as opaque as the remarks on gezelligheid would to Peter. Moreover, counsel- ors tend to interpret autistic behavior-which, from the socialized point of view, sometimes appears to be polymorphic-as meaningful action in the ordinary sense. For instance, not eating the nice meal appears as a deliberate act to undermine Marc's cooking efforts. Such an account, however, must be considered an example of overinterpreting Rick's behavior (which is not the same as saying that autistic behavior cannot be interpreted as communicating feelings such as fear or confusion, at all). In people working with autistic persons, one is often confronted with ideas like: "He doesn't want this" or "He's putting pressure on us." Those are presumptions I think we might very well have, and an autistic person might have something like it too, but in the latter case there's no doubt that these will be radically different from ours. We are continuously attributing our concepts to people with autism. Thinking that it will be the way we think it is. Routines offered at the ward are often much looser than one would expect them to be. But we need not be very surprised by this. The socialized find it very difficult to reduce their actions in the required manner. Bridging the gap between the two conceptions of social order at stake here-the machinelike order of an egg timer and the elusive order of a language community-is an extraordinary achievement; an achievement of socialized people who have learned to communicate with the nonsocialized in their midst, by forcing their actions into a mimeomorphic format. These demands are not to be taken lightly: it takes blood, sweat, and tears to learn to behave oneself with machinelike regularity, as Collins's theory of action teaches us (which is not meant to delete from everyday reality the pain and effort which the autistic people must bear in interactions with the nonautistic). Rather counterintui- tively, the investments required to suppress ordinary human tendencies and to simulate thinglike traits instead require a lot of creativity,19 as some commentators in the field acknowledge. Those working in the ward are not "rigid," these are "flexible" counselors adapting themselves to the rigidity, the "other cognitive style" of people with autism. Helping people who suffer a lack of imagination, requires an awful lot of imagination. (Peeters 1994, 106) Apparently, it takes a great effort for ordinary people not to proceed from implicitly shared meanings and simulate the regularity of egg timers instead.</page><page sequence="13">Hendriks / Egg Timers and Human Values 411 Social and mental habits play an important role.20 At the same time, autistic life is not seen as "meaningful" human life as long as it is lived entirely in what counselors perceive as monotonous, repetitive ways (which should be considered an echo of "our" deepest intuitions of what it means to be "human"). Structure is not a good in itself, they say. It is a necessary adaptation required to get the residents used to more flexibility. "Not because they should be more like us, but simply because via this flexibility they'll be more able to enjoy life" (Peeters 1995). According to the personnel sharing so much time with these youths, structures are not the only good. The care of autistic people does not consist of relying on the automatic pilot. To do a good job, it is not enough to be as regular as an egg timer and to apply formal rules. According to me, that would give you such a science fiction idea: a robot in the kitchen who programs life on the other side. But I think no, you're dealing with people here. I think that an autistic person has feelings too, be it in another way. But it's also for yourself I think: you must enjoy working here. I watched counselors work in a more passionate way, rather than providing rational structures. I saw them make fun, talk, and laugh. Teasing and joking appear to be a normal part of social life in the ward.21 More than that, a purely mechanistic approach was often criticized. I heard a call for love and care, and for treating these youngsters as fellow humans.22 Initially, I was horrified by the whole program. So much structure, so many rules, that isn't workable. Everything needed to be prestructured: fixed meal- times, a separation between the dining room and the living room, etc., etc. It went so far even that a resident would go in the shower exactly one quarter of an hour before her parents came, so that she would be finished and clothed at the very moment that they would ring the doorbell. So empty and cold, we were really dreading it. In the end, it didn't turn out so strict.23 Still, as my field notes show in the case of Rick, such a yielding approach toward people with autism is fraught with risk, which is well acknowledged by people working in the ward. There is a danger of ignoring the differences between autistic and nonautistic people; there is a risk of being uncaring, even hurting autistic people, precisely by treating them as fellow human beings. I will call such unintended indifference regarding the otherness of autistic people "naive humanism." Such an approach proceeds from its own unques- tioned assumptions about universal human needs which are projected on the other in his or her best interest. In the case of autism, however, naive humanism may end up being cruel.24</page><page sequence="14">412 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values All people familiar with autism are aware of the thin dividing line between doing good in their own terms and what they think is good for autistic persons. Anybody working with people with autism will recognize the urge to give in, to yield. But, what is good for normal people is not necessarily good for autistic persons. Those people who really want to help will not paint common standards onto autistic lives. By all means we must avoid the mistake of presupposing that people with autism need a copy of what's good for us: we're too common. Of course, love is most important, but to really love somebody, you must try to go under his skin, and help him from his perspective, rather than from our own projected needs. (Peeters 1994,177)25 People living and working with people with autism, however reluctant they may occasionally be to impose routines because it is fellow humans they are dealing with, learn that in many cases they provide better comfort in a reductionist mode. Often they find this out the hard way. What may have been intended as a careful response to the other's uncertainty may turn out to be completely confusing to him. An apparently sensible reaction may result in violent tantrums, anger, and fear. Working in a ward for autistic youths is often hard work--hard work carried out by caring people. From the outside, however, the "severe" regime in the ward may appear harsh and demeaning. Counselors are suspected of paternalizing and dehu- manizing the youngsters, rather than communicating with them. However, in order to not dehumanize people with autism, a radical shift in standards is required: we have to learn that there is nothing demeaning about taking physical objects, routines, and structures as a model for caring consideration. In a way, people with autism are offered more grip, sometimes even literally so, by nonhumans than by humans. The nonhuman predictable behavior and iron regularity are thinglike traits that people can only try hard to simulate by acting in a mimeomorphic way. Kids like Peter and Rick seem to be better off in the "empty," mechanistic world of the egg timer than in the meaningful world of people-among-themselves. By overlooking this, the creativity and investments to get that far tend to be underestimated. By the same token, the moral achievement residing in a reductionist approach is completely over- looked. Doing good morally in the ward in W. appears to be intimately connected with treating other human beings in a reductionist way. You'll have to be willing to use a communicative style which is unlike your own. A style which is often seen as paternalistic. However, I think that for the largest part "to care" is to take this responsibility: to engage in another style of</page><page sequence="15">Hendriks / Egg Timers and Human Values 413 communication, another social mode than you're normally involved in. (Peeters 1995) The Care of Autistic Youths An autistic boy received an airplane model for a present, but did not seem to know how to play with it. He did not get any further than making a broumbroum sound and making the airplane land and take-off within a fifty centimeter range of his face. Even though he was totally in love with his plane, he appeared to be locked in a state without initiative, goal and direction. During a course participants came up with the idea to visualize what more could be done with the plane. In the leisure comer a circuit of over forty meters was drawn, to indicate that the plane could not only take-off and land in the fifty centimeter tunnel in front of his eyes, but could fill up the entire leisure comer. This was shown to him explicitly. The result was predictable yet amazing. He really seemed released, he began to flap his arms, took his little airplane all over the circuit, started jumping up and down, and walked the entire circuit again. (Peeters 1994, 102) Social relations in the ward at W. may be described as necessarily reduc- tionist; doing good appears to be closely related to treating the other in a specifically structured way. In this respect, two lessons can be drawn from Collins's theory of action. First, Collins urges us to differentiate between two types of order which are sometimes intermingled in everyday practice in the ward: the iron regularity of an egg timer and the regularities of social life. Second, Collins's theory enables us to point out the limitations of a naive humanistic stance: an underestimated behavioral and moral achievement resides in a reductionist approach. In a more general vocabulary, this can be summarized as follows: Our intervention techniques are designed to make social situations and expec- tations as clear as possible for our group members. We often generate social rules where they are not ordinarily specified, even if they are less than perfect. Autistic people need rules in situations where actions are guided by judgment and subtle cues from other people. Although concrete rules often do not work as well as good judgment, they are better and more adaptable for autistic people than having no rules at all. (Mesibov 1992, 151) Although a structured (mimeomorphic) order is far from ideal, it is still preferable to the (polimorphic) alternative, which means asking autistic people to function with no rules at all, thus closing opportunities for them to</page><page sequence="16">414 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values participate in society. At least, that is what options look like from the perspective I have discussed so far. However, formal rules (in a rigid, machinelike sense) are the best option only when the alternative is to provide no grip at all; when there is indeed a contradiction between humanism and reductionism; when there is a deep distinction between human and machine- like action. These oppositions typically stem from a nonautistic frame of reference. In this last section, I will try to problematize this either/or type of argument by making the empirical data comment on social theory, instead of the other way around. Thus, I will try to answer Sinclair's call for a more even, a more symmetrical approach of autistic and nonautistic terms. If you would help me, don't try to change me to fit your world. Don't try to confine me to some tiny part of the world you can change to fit me. Grant me the dignity of meeting me on my own terms-recognize that we are equally alien to each other, that my ways of being are not merely damaged versions of yours. Question your assumptions. Define your terms. Work with me to build more bridges between us. (Sinclair 1992, 302) Is a dualist frame of reference which is reinforced by Collins's conceptual scheme a sufficient basis to question the familiar, nonautistic assumptions? Or, to limit myself to only one of the poles: Does the provision of clocklike order simulated in mimeomorphic action yield a satisfactory answer to Sinclair's request for help? I do believe he's happier like that than with no rules at all. But I think that if he would have had means to communicate.... Communication in its broadest sense: not only what he can communicate ... but if he, let's say, if he would have come to a complete visual language, which would have contained other elements of meaning ... (Peeters 1995) Although it appears to be difficult to express verbally an alternative to the either/or way of reasoning, neither of the two extremes-a communicative human society, on one hand, or a cold and empty, machinelike condition, on the other-seem to provide a fully satisfactory description of the approach advocated by my informant. In fact, "reductionism" appears to be a rather poor characterization of the care of autistic youths. My final example, for instance, tells of how the drawing of a circuit enables an autistic boy to feel more comfortable in his surroundings and to engage in joyful play. The story suggests that providing a concrete visual environment should not be equated with silencing or conditioning the other. On the contrary, the example shows an autistic person coming alive through the structured environment he is offered.26 The extension of the circuit appears a crucial step in the laborious construction of this person's being.</page><page sequence="17">Hendriks / Egg Timers and Human Values 415 Therefore, this approach differs from what could be called reductionism in a "naive mechanistic" sense. The crucial difference lies in the results one is satisfied with. But when and where do we stop exploring the unknown potentials of a more concrete form of constructing and representing order? It's a pity that we still haven't come further than the first few letters of what I call the auti-alphabet.... They've started specifically structured and visual- ized classes, and this approach has indeed minimalized behavioral problems. But now everyone is satisfied and thinks one has reached all that is feasible. However, only a start has been made. They stop where they should really begin. This causes a lot of misunderstanding nowadays. It gives you the idea that visual structure is there to condition people, that it's just an easy way to keep them down. However, all the possibilities this has to offer ... (Peeters 1995) The danger of dehumanization thus resides in being satisfied with behav- ioral problem-solving, which is the mechanistic counterpart of a naive humanistic stance. A naive mechanistic approach proceeds from its own unquestioned assumptions about machinelike characteristics and needs. These assumptions about what machines "really are" are sometimes pro- jected on people with autism, with the best of intentions, to be sure. But such a mechanistic approach may end up being as cruel as a naive humanistic stance. This time, the risk of cruelty is not hidden in an indifference toward the otherness of autistic people, but in its opposite. By setting its goals too narrowly, the approach carries a risk of reducing interactions in a ward for autistic youths to mere behavioral problem solving. Thus, I would agree with Elton's claim, mentioned before, that full- fledged interactions between persons should not be reduced to mechanistic (or behavioristic) accounts. On the other hand, and contrary to Elton's claim "that in so doing one will fail to capture the nature, indeed the very being, of the entity in question" (Elton 1998, 394), the case of autism shows some of the normative flaws of reduction in the opposite direction. It is also reduc- tionist to generalize about the essence of "minded entities" such as counselors and autistic youths. We do not need generalizations but empirical examples which may exemplify what "being different" and nevertheless "sharing a form of life" may look like. Such examples may show us how contradictory commitments are at once felt and overcome. This, finally, brings me to some problems with Collins's theory of action. By holding that the deconstruction of the dichotomy of humans and machines would "obscure rather than clarify our understanding of the interactions between entities" (Collins, de Vries, and Bijker 1997, 281), Collins tends to generalize his claims where he should be reluctant to do so. Whereas this perspective has proved valuable in showing the limitations of a naive human-</page><page sequence="18">416 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values istic stance--in itself a countercommonsensical and extraordinary thing to do-we should not remain blind to its flaws when it contrasts the open-ended nature of polimorphic action to the limited and predefined possibilities residing in the mimeomorphic side of life. For residents and counselors alike, "development" can then only mean a quantitative extension of formal cir- cuits. Thus, when counselors try to make room for an autistic way of being, and consequently, they extend sociality to include autistic persons, the result can then only be understood as a qualitative impoverishment, rather than an enrichment of human society. It is seen as something less (or something more) rather than as something else. From this point of view, then, autism cannot be considered anything but a disorder: a damaged way of being. A second objection to the theory stems from its assumption that only competent members of the social community should be granted agency. Although the theory allows us to acknowledge the efforts of the people trying to simulate a nonsocialized condition, events as they unfold themselves in the ward tend to be understood as being solely and entirely reducible to the intentions, habits, or mistakes of the counselors. It implies that only the socialized actors are in charge. The counselors are supposed to be untouched by all that matters-immediately, materially, and tangibly-in ordinary life in the ward, just as the autistic people remain untouched by all that matters (meaningfully, symbolically) in ordinary human relationships. Autistic per- sons are supposed not to act upon the world as other people do. At best the undersocialized ways of being in the world are tolerated by those who are assumed to be in charge. They are allowed to partake in (a secluded part of) human society as the passive and docile objects of intentional human action. They are patients, not agents. They are cared for, but do not care themselves. Although the vocabulary I have sought to apply critically in this article did shake some of the commonsense assumptions about the care of mentally handicapped autistic youths, other presumptions-notably about the dualist nature of our world and the roles played by counselors and autistic residents in it-remained unquestioned. A familiar way of speaking, where the alter- native for a lack of socialization in the language community by necessity has to be found on the mute-machine pole, remained untouched throughout. Whether this vocabulary meets Sinclair's demand to question our assump- tions appears doubtful. So, how to proceed? Let me formulate the problem once more. In the case of autism, one of Wittgenstein's remarks on the tricky nature of language and the need for safe passways gains extra significance. To people with autism, abstract means of communication often have no meaning at all. But are we not all victims of the ruse of familiar ways of speaking? In (reflecting on)</page><page sequence="19">Hendriks / Egg Timers and Human Values 417 everyday life in the ward, any further step along alphabet street might as well lead in the wrong direction. Language sets everyone the same traps; it is an immense network of easily accessible wrong turnings. And so we watch one man after another walking down the same paths and we know in advance where he will branch off, where walk straight on without noticing the side turning, etc. etc. What I have to do then is erect signposts at all the junctions where there are wrong turnings so as to help people past the danger points. (Wittgenstein 1980, 18) To allow people with autism to develop themselves, instead of only asking them to adapt, society at large ought to make room for an autistic form of life. Chances that people with autism will be able to develop may possibly be extended along the networks of a (visually) structured environment, with signposts all along the roads. But what could such "signposts" look like? To define them as the mechanistic counterpart of a polimorphic order confines us to our linguistic habits instead of challenging them.27 To offer a concrete structure is only a point of departure for the development of what could possibly be meaningful life in an undersocialized, autistic sense. That is why Collins's refusal to extend the principle of symmetry to the dichotomy of humans and machines (Collins and Yearley 1992) does not seem warranted, at least not as a general rule. How to explore the unknown potentials of a more concrete form of constructing and representing order? And how to speak of these?28 People who have grown up within the familiar scope of the language community can hardly be expected to give up all their linguistic certainties. It would make them autistic. Is reductionism cast in amimeomorphic mold the optimal goal? Perhaps it is our best option of bypassing a blocked humanistic approach.29 Sometimes, however, we may have the opportunity to question some of our assumptions further. In this article, I have tried to explore some of these attempts. In this account, we have come across people trying to navigate carefully between the double bearings of material and meaning: counselors doing their utmost to create a common ground between human values and egg timers; commentators searching for words to describe interactions in the ward without reducing them either to linguistics or to the muteness of machines.3? Their success may be partial, but it is still worth something, and we should be reluctant to impose our dualistic schemes of thought on these efforts. Perhaps we can only catch a glimpse, a shimmer of the common history of egg timers and human values in the care of autistic youths in the ward in W. But the signposts that may help us to rethink the (conceptual) world autistic</page><page sequence="20">418 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values and nonautistic people can share are most likely to be found in the everyday practice in the ward. Postscript People with autism can find comfort in society only if mutual efforts are made. This implies that society will have to allow landmarks and signposts to be installed and not to remain untouched by all that matters in autistic lives. Willingly or not, this happens often enough. It happens, for instance, when, on one of those early mornings at the breakfast table one of the counselors finds himself missing the egg timer. He has become so used to its availability that he is quite inconvenienced now that Peter has moved to another unit, and the egg timer has moved with him. I missed it already! I really missed the egg timer! I sat there the other morning, and I always used to do this with [one of the other youths] Jason: I made him a sandwich as soon as the egg timer rang for Peter. Now my first thought was: When must I make this sandwich for Jason? At breakfast that was. It was so weird. I thought, shit, the egg timer! Notes 1. TEACCH stands for Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication Handicapped Children. The TEACCH division at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill provides services to children with autism and their families as well as staff training and consultation for classrooms, group homes, and other services. 2. In this article, I will not discuss explanations of autistic behavior. Still, according to one of these explanations known as the theory of mind hypothesis (e.g., Baron-Cohen, Leslie, and Frith 1985; Frith [1989] 1993), social and other problems with meaning seen in autism can be explained by a cognitive defect. These authors hypothesize an impairment in the mechanism which normally allows people to make metarepresentations-that is, not only to represent the world but also to think or reason about these representations. A coherent theory of mind results from the ability to think about other people's mental states, to deduce their thoughts from ambiguous external signs, to anticipate the other person's actions and thus to engage in social intercourse. In autistic minds, this mechanism appears to be damaged. 3. The autistic disorder is a subgroup of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders listed in the chapter on Disorders usu,ally first evident in infancy, childhood, or adolescence in DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association 1994). Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder, which means that it is a disorder on a central level with widespread effects on the development of the child. Following the DSM-IV definition, people with autism suffer a qualitative impairment in social interaction and in communication and display restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities; they show delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas: social interaction, language as used in social communication or symbolic</page><page sequence="21">Hendriks / Egg Timers and Humnan Values 419 or imaginative play, with onset during infancy or childhood (before thirty-six months of age), and their disturbance is not better accounted for by Rett's disorder or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. 4. The material discussed in this article was gathered between June and September 1994 in a residential ward W. in the Netherlands, where a team of seven women and men was involved in the care of six mentally handicapped, autistic youngsters. 5. Social impairments are generally more severe in autistic persons with a low IQ. Only 15 percent of autistic persons are reported to have IQs in a range that could be said to be a normal average or above. About 70 percent of people with autism have an IQ below 70 and thus have an additional mental handicap (Frith [1989] 1993). 6. For autobiographical accounts on feelings as various as fear and joy, happiness and loneliness, as well as on the desire to be a respected member of society, see, for example, Grandin and Scariano 1986; Momma 1996; Sellin 1993; Sinclair 1992; Williams 1991; Zoller 1989. 7. "After age five there is often marked improvement in social skills, especially in the more able children. Indeed during the whole of their development, autistic children show noticeable increases in socialization. Yet, learning to behave appropriately toward others remains much harder for them than it is for other children" (Frith [1989] 1993, 139). 8. Autistic humor is even one of the items that is warmly welcomed as a contribution to ANI-L, Autism Network International-an electronic communication network for autistic people-as the entering regulations reveal. 9. Most researchers place Asperger's syndrome on the autistic continuum (Wing [1991] 1993). As a kind of short hand, Asperger's syndrome is often conceived of as a form of high-functioning autism. As hallmarks of Asperger's syndrome, Ozonoff, Rogers, and Pen- nington (1991) mention peculiar preoccupations, lack of reciprocity in social intercourse, and pragmatic language deficits (such as pedantic speech). 10. Deleting much of the variation among the group of autistic individuals is, of course, a reduction in itself and certainly not without dangers. However, to explore ways of not reproduc- ing familiar schemes of thought, I think it is useful to ignore this variation here. 11. The prefix "poly," as it resonates in "polimorphic action," refers to the various behaviors that can be used to carry out the same action (e.g., "paying money" can be done by writing a check, by passing paper tokens, etc.). The pun "poli" is used to indicate that the appropriate performance of such a meaningful action finds its foundation in the society (polis) where it is found, as well as to indicate that the acts are constitutional for the form of life found in this society. This formulation shows that Collins positions his work in the tradition of the later Wittgenstein (1953). Wittgenstein introduced the concept of rule-governed behavior to explicate the meaning of words: meaning is rule-governed use. But rules do not contain the rules for their application; they are underdetermined, which suggests that something extra, something external is needed to make social life tick. Collins (following Winch 1958) holds that social conventions, transmitted in the process of socialization, fill in the gap between rules and their correct use (de Vries 1996). Interestingly enough, Wittgenstein is now often described as someone who might have had Asperger's syndrome (see note 9), which would imply that the theoretical basis for this analysis has been established by someone with an autistic spectrum disorder. This does not mean that Collins's interpretation of Wittgenstein is the "right" one (see de Vries 1992 for a critique). Ironically, an interpretation such as Collins's would introduce typically nonautistic terms (such as social conventions) that cannot be easily accounted for if Wittgenstein indeed had an autistic spectrum condition. 12. It should be noted that the difference between both types of action, according to Collins's definition, can be tested empirically. It would not be a metaphysical difference we are dealing</page><page sequence="22">420 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values with here, but a boundary between two types of action which can be established by sociological means. 13. Observation made at W. For reasons of privacy, all residents and counselors have been given fictional names. 14. All quotes, unless mentioned otherwise, originate from (partly informal) interviews I had with the nurses and the psychologist who counsel the group. Translations from these and other Dutch sources are my own. 15. Gezellig is the Dutch expression for a sociable atmosphere, with a wide variety of associations such as closed curtains, an open fire, flowers on the table, drinking coffee with the entire family, talking about the weather, and avoiding improper subjects such as the infamous black sheep of the family. The broadness of the category does not imply there is no order in gezelligheid. On the contrary, tact is extremely important for gezelligheid. Georg Simmel considers it the ideal playground of by necessity tactful and self-restrained social intercourse, which would explain why people with autism cannot see the point of remarks referring to it: "Von den soziologische Kategorien her betrachtend, bezeichne ich also die Geselligkeit als die Spielform der Vergesellschaftung und als-mutatis mutandis-zu deren inhaltsbestimmter Konkretheit sich verhaltend wie das Kunstwerk zur realitat." For Simmel's interpretation of the concept of Geselligkeit, see his [1917] 1984, 53. 16. Of course the autistic need for reliable structures is no stranger to nonautistic people. Sometimes there may only be a gradual difference, and the boundary between normal and autistic behavior may become blurred. However, the difference between normal and autistic needs for concrete structures cannot be denied. 17. The case of autism thus appears to be extremely challenging for an analysis of the difficulties in and opportunities for translating words, morality, and linguistic meanings into things, concrete structures, and tangible meanings. In this respect, the concept of the script as it is developed by Akrich and Latour (1992) may be a useful tool. 18. More ambitious goals are seldom met in these situations. Providing comfort often means focusing on and finding solutions for the small problems in everyday life. Of course, there is also the issue of what is the inherent value of social interaction, communication, and widening up the range of one's actions as such. According to Theo Peeters, founder and director of the OpleidingscentrumAutisme in Antwerp, Belgium, these human possibilities remain meaningful, even when they have to be pursued by other means, so that they will at best be approximated. "You can probably say that what happiness means for ordinary people, is also happiness for autistic people. Only, I think that the level, or better, the dimension in which happiness is reached, is a different one" (Peeters 1995). 19. Usually the history of humans and machines (formal structures and routines included) is associated with the unbounded extension of mindlessness and the suppression of human creativity (e.g., the history of Taylorism and military drill). Collins provides a surprising reversal of such assumptions as they are usually found in man-machine debates. In the context of autism, a fine illustration of this point is provided by the counselors. 20. A cognitive psychologist would explain such mistakes in terms of the inner drive of people to attribute states of mind to others, no matter what they actually are, and to look for hidden meaning. For instance, writing about human interaction with robots, Frith claims that one tends to "forget" and treat them as scheming beings, despite their metal exterior. "This is under- standable if we assume that the attribution of states of mind is pervasive and compulsive" (Frith [1989] 1993, 46). On this point also, see Sherry Turkle's (1984) book where she describes how children attribute anthropomorphic characteristics to their computers, for instance, the ability to cheat. For Collins the attribution of shared meanings in polimorphic action is as compulsive as</page><page sequence="23">Hendriks / Egg Timers and Human Values 421 the attribution of states of mind (which he would consider a secondary phenomenon) for the psychologist. 21. Spontaneous processes of social ordering occurring in the ward are much richer and much more ambiguous than the previous sections would lead us to believe. From Collins's point of view, these events (such as teasing or joking) are necessarily looked upon as counterproductive or residual processes. For it is the reductionist (mimeomorphic) mode of human action which allows counselors and autistic youths to mix smoothly. Notice, however, that according to others there is no need to generalize this point: "There are people with autism who really learn to appreciate certain forms of teasing, verbally orphysically. And others who don't" (Peeters 1995). 22. This may appear to be a personal argument against the conditioning of autistic youths in favor of a more humanistic approach toward them. To be sure, I do find it unpleasant to compare people with autism to machines, but that is not the position I want to argue for here. The argument is that it is the counselors themselves who mention humanistic qualities as an indispensable and normal part of their job, and who use such a humanistic approach in practice. Counselors are the ones who cannot stand reducing autistic persons to machines. Such humanistic or moral concerns, however, play an ambiguous role in the ward. 23. People's reluctance to get stuck in automatisms is expressed literally in the following quote: "Yes, a kind of robots. That you're going through a kind of fixed program for yourself. But I think you should pay attention with this group, that it doesn't become too much of an automatism, a kind of rooting." 24. Of course, the point could also be made for other cases, for instance, ordinary child rearing. In the case of autism, however, the need to adapt seems to be particularly pertinent. 25. Notice the Verstehende, humanistic undertones residing in this and other pleas for a reductionist approach. The question, if these accounts go far enough in their critique of ordinary human standards, is taken up elsewhere (Hendriks 1997). 26. According to Peeters, the events in the leisure comer might possibly be interpreted as a compensation for an autistic lack of a verbal inner language (paralleled by a lack of socialization) by external scripts or scenario.s: "People with autism have a lack of inner language or a shortage of inner scripts that would allow them to organize their thoughts .... Now, what we do in counseling, I think, could best be described as offering external scenarios to compensate for the lack of inner scripts" (Peeters 1995). In elaborating on these thoughts, Peeters has been inspired by Temple Grandin, an autistic scientist with great talent in visual thinking. To recognize order in all kinds of events, she reports playing videotapes in her mind (Grandin and Scariano 1986; Sacks 1995). For the concept of script as it is elaborated upon in STS, see Akrich and Latour 1992. 27. An interesting account of the communication between a deaf-blind child and her parents which seeks to avoid such a dichotomy between linguistic and nonlinguistic resources (such as material environment and temporal routines) is found in Goode (1990). For an analysis of how linguistic elements themselves may come to act as concrete signposts in autobiographies by autistic authors, see Hendriks (1998). 28. "I never more than half succeed in expressing what I want to express. Actually not as much as that, but by no more than a tenth. That is still worth something. Often my writing is nothing but 'stuttering' " (Wittgenstein 1980, 18). Keeping in mind these words of Wittgenstein on his difficulties to verbally express what he found in architecture, images, and music, we can ask how we might allow autistic people to find comfort in (written) theory as well. 29. Elsewhere in this issue, Marc Berg asks whether eroding the preset distinction between the realm of the human and the realm of the mechanical will not lead to a dangerous reduction in political leverage.</page><page sequence="24">422 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values 30. For a tentative further step in this direction, see Hendriks (1997), where I use an estranging vocabulary, inspired by the actor-network theory, to describe processes of temporal ordering in the ward. Actor-network theory appears promising for describing such ordering processes because it seeks to allow for forms of agency and representation that come in all kinds of material forms, not only in meaningful words. Callon and Law (1995) formulate this crucial (irreductionist) insight of actor-network theory as follows: 'Td like us to imagine chains or networks of re-presentation. This is the point. We need to drive a wedge between re-presentation and language. Between making present again, and its linguistic form. Sometimes re-presentation comes in the shape and form of words. But often it does not. That's the virtue of all this work in science studies about laboratory science. Chains of re-presentations may lead to words. May come to take the form of words. But they may equally well lead to, or take the form of, technical objects-for instance, instruments, or diagrams, or skills embodied in human beings" (Callon and Law 1995, 501).
