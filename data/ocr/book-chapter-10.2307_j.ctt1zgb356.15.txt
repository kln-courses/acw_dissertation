Within this region in Jawoyn Country can be found Nawarla Gabarnmang, an  impressive rockshelter exhibiting a gridded network of pillars that supports a thick ceiling of  10 cm to 40 cm thick cross-beds of hard sandstone and quartzite (Figures 11.2 and 11.3; see  also Chapter 10). The inter-layer joints and fissures between these compact and poorly soluble  quartz-rich sandstones and quartzites have witnessed geologically slow dissolution of the  bedrock, resulting in a hollowing out of the rock in a process known as ‘ghost rock’ formation  or ‘phantomisation’ (Quinif 2010), a particular cave-forming process causing the regular grid- shaped structure of underground cavities and pillars (for details of site formation processes,  see Chapter 13).  The remnant pillars supporting ceiling rock strata at Nawarla Gabarnmang are an anthropic cave  structure (Delannoy et al. 2013; see Chapter 10): in addition to the slow geological dissolution  of the rock along layer planes and fissure lines, people have also entirely or partially removed  individual pillars, and possibly ceiling strata, over a period commencing sometime after the site  was first occupied around 50,000 years ago (e.g. David et al. 2011, completed manuscript).  What catches one’s attention at Nawarla Gabarnmang are the voids between the pillars, typically  c. 1–2 m apart in the southwestern corner of the site, but more than 8 m apart in the central- eastern portion. In that noticeably more open central-eastern area, a large, sub-horizontal and  flat ceiling is supported by some 20 sparsely distributed pillars. Here, as in most other parts of  the site, the floor of the sheltered area is generally flat and sub-horizontal, consisting of ashy  sand with sparsely scattered, relatively small blocks of rock originating from the ceiling but  not in their original fallen positions (these blocks have all, without exception, been moved by  people). Within the fill across the site are rich archaeological deposits including stone artefacts,  ochre pieces and animal bones, as revealed in the archaeological excavations (David et al. 2011;  </page> <page sequence="2"> 246    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Geneste et al. 2012). What we see today in the shelter are the results of tens of thousands of years  of human occupation, modification of rock surfaces and site use that express well the notion  of ‘dwelling’ and ‘inhabitation’ (e.g. David et al. 2013, 2014; Delannoy et al. 2013; Geneste et al.  2010; cf. Ingold 2000; Thomas 2008).  Figure 11.1 Detail of the vast rockshelter landscape of the central-western Arnhem Land plateau. Source: Photograph by Bruno David.

Source: Photograph by Jean-Jacques Delannoy. Nawarla Gabarnmang is of special interest for rock art research because it has a rich and especially  well preserved record of paintings under its well-protected overhang and, to a lesser extent, on its  rock pillars (e.g. Figure 11.3). This art is, in some parts of the site, represented by expansive and  overlapping concentrations of paintings (with minor quantities of other kinds of artworks also  being present, such as cupules, beeswax designs and stencils). Elsewhere in the shelter, more or  less discrete art panels usually have multiple and complex patterns of superimposition.  Gunn (2016) has divided the shelter’s ceiling into 41 sections with pigment art (Figure 11.4),  each section representing a more or less spatially discrete area of art. A total of 1391 images have  been recorded in up to 49 layers of superimposition from the ceiling alone. The area reported in this  chapter is Panel E1, located immediately above archaeological excavation Square P (Figures 11.4  and 11.5). While the complex superimpositions in Panel E1 reveal a chronological sequence of  painted images, detailed three-dimensional (3-D) laser mapping of the site, geomorphological  investigations and excavation of Square P have revealed surface and in situ buried information  that individually and together enable us to understand better the ages of these sequential layers  of artworks on the ceiling above.  The aim of this chapter is to cross-correlate information obtained from the painted ceiling at  Panel E1 with geomorphological details and archaeological evidence buried immediately below  the art panel in Square P. In this way, the information immanent in the rock art and in the  strata below it are combined into an integrated understanding, in a way rarely attempted when  studying Australian rock art. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="4"> 248    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 11.4 Map of ceiling of Nawarla Gabarnmang, showing location of Panel E1 relative to other  ceiling art panels and excavation squares.

Dating painted Panel E1 at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land plateau    249  Panel E1 Panel E1 is large, covering a roughly triangular area 5.4 × 2.4 m in maximum dimensions. It is  located in the central-eastern side of the shelter, in a part of the site where there is maximum  spacing between pillars. The surface of the ceiling at Panel E1 is flat and sub-horizontal, exhibiting  small and shallow ripple marks that provide minor rounded texture. Eighty-two painted or  stencilled images are present on this panel, mostly concentrated towards its centre, with extensive  superimpositioning virtually obliterating the central motifs of the underlying and therefore older  layers (Tables 11.1–11.3; Figures 11.6 and 11.7).

The Harris Matrix approach,  originally created to describe complex archaeological stratigraphies in intricate urban sites (Harris  1989; Russell 2012), was first used for rock art in western Arnhem Land (Chippindale and  Taçon 1993). It models the relative superimposition of strata across space, in this case involving  the micro-strata of superimposing artworks spread across the panel. The completed Harris  Matrix depicts the minimum number of paint layers required to account for all the art and  their superimpositions in Panel E1, as generated from the sum of individual superimpositions  (Figure 11.8).  Figure 11.8 Harris Matrix showing pattern of superimpositions for all 82 images of Panel E1. Red squares indicate images at the beginning or end of a sequence of superimpositions, and singular images not involved  in superimpositions. Blue squares indicate images within a sequence of superimpositions (see Harris 1989; Russell 2012). Note: To magnify the diagram please see the PDF version at: press.anu.edu.au Source: Illustration by Robert Gunn. The systematic computation integrating all the cases of superimposition in Panel E1 identifies  at least 15 layers of superimposition involving all but one of its 82 images. That lone image  (Image #7) was assigned to Layer 13 on the basis of similarities in motif type, colour, size and  preservation relative to adjacent Images #6 and #8. All 15 layers, numbered from the top down  as Layers 1–15, were grouped into six chronological phases, numbered from the bottom up as  Phases I–VI (Figure 11.9): • Phase I is made up of Layers 14 and 15: This earliest phase consists of 21 images in red in at  least two separate layers. Of note is the presence of basic X-ray features in a monochrome red  fish (Image #15; with stylised backbone and ribs depicted) and a long snake (Image #11; with  backbone, ribs and eggs depicted) (Figure 11.10). • Phase II is Layer 13: This layer consists of 12 yellow paintings, with only one simple design  being clear enough to identify to motif type (Figure 11.11). • Phase III is Layer 12: A layer of four red paintings also cannot be identified to motif type  (Figure 11.11). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="7"> 11.  Dating painted Panel E1 at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land plateau    251  • Phase IV is made up of Layers 5–11: The 39 images from this phase come from six  distinct layers dominated by paintings in monochrome white and bichrome white and red  (Figures 11.12–11.14). Within this phase, Layer 5 has two anomalous orange anthropomorphs,  one of which (Image #46) has a white headdress. The white monochrome and bichrome with  basal white motifs do not occur as separate, discrete layers, suggesting that on this panel they  are contemporaneous. • Phase V is Layer 4: A single bichrome turtle motif in white and orange. This motif is distinctly  different from all underlying or overlying motifs (Figure 11.14).  • Phase VI is made up of Layers 1–3: This most recent phase, which contains five images, shows  a distinct change in the art towards larger and more visually dramatic images (Figure 11.15).  Figure 11.9 Interpretation of the Panel E1 Harris Matrix, with phases indicated. Coloured squares indicate the principal colour of the image (in polychrome works, this is the underlying colour and usually the  most abundant colour in that image, as in an X-ray image where the underlying colour forms a solid silhouette onto which lines  in other colours are superimposed): blue = white, red = red, yellow = yellow, orange = orange (see Harris 1989; Russell 2012). Note: To magnify the diagram please see the PDF version at: press.anu.edu.au Source: Illustration by Robert Gunn. Most of the larger motifs occur towards the central parts of the panel. However, a large snake  (Image #11) from the earliest Phase I (Layer 15) was positioned to curve around the panel’s  western edge (Figure 11.10). No consistency has been noted in the alignment of images relative  to each other or to any other reference point. Unlike a vertical panel, this near-horizontal surface  seems to have no top or bottom, and there is no ‘right way up’ or ‘upside down’ for the figures  on it. X-ray features occur among the lowermost (i.e. oldest) layers of Panel E1. This was unexpected,  as elsewhere at Nawarla Gabarnmang (e.g. on Panel D) X-ray features occur only in the more  recent art (Gunn 2016). The two X-ray motifs in the lowermost Layer 15 (Phase I) of Panel E1  are both in monochrome red: a fish (Image #15) with stylised backbone and ribs; and the large  red snake mentioned above (Image #11) with backbone, ribs and eggs (Figures 11.10 and 11.16). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="8"> 252    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 11.10 Phase I images (Layers 14 and 15), Panel E1.

As noted above, the white monochrome and bichrome with basal white paintings occur within  the same phase, suggesting that they are contemporaneous. The bichrome motifs include two  ‘Jawoyn Lady’ paintings (Images #57 and #58) and a large fish with patterned infill (Image #56)  (Figures 11.13 and 11.17). Figure 11.17 Details of body decoration on ‘Jawoyn Lady’ Image #57. Source: Photograph by Robert Gunn. The uppermost, most recent paintings in the superimpositions show a distinct change in the  art towards larger and more visually dramatic images. The lowermost of these impressively large  images is a turtle (Image #75; Figure 11.18) painted in ‘Bula style’. Bula art is a style of painting  relating to the ethnographic period and restricted to Jawoyn Country, defined by solid white  silhouettes with bold red outline and infill line work (cf. Gunn 1992). Above the Bula-style turtle  of Layer 4 in Panel E1 is an unusual form of X-ray macropod (Image #76; Figure 11.19) and two  large polychrome X-ray barramundi (Image #77 and Image #78; Figures 11.20 and 11.21), each  of Layer 3; both barramundi have been later partially retouched on several occasions.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="12"> 256    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia The most recent image on Panel E1 is a barramundi that appears to have been only partially  completed (Image #79; Figure 11.22). It was painted on a prepared ‘surface-smear’ of pink  paint (probably a blend of an applied white mixing with an existing red image). Subsequently,  the barramundi (Image #79) was partly over-painted by an off-white smeared area (Image #80).  Similarly, Images #76 and #77 were also painted over prepared surfaces. Ethnographically, Elkin  (1952:245) reported the practice in Jawoyn Country of erasing a deceased person’s painting by  relatives smearing it with red ochre and over-painting another picture, usually a malindji (spirit  figure) representing the deceased’s spirit. He gives no actual examples of this practice, and no cases  of smearing and over-painting with a spirit figure have been located in the recent extensive site  recording in Jawoyn Country. Apart from these examples on Panel E1, smearing has only been  recorded at the nearby shelter of Dalakngalarr (see Chapter 13). Whether the underlying smear was  a preparation for making the over-painted image is unclear. Certainly, the practice of smearing  was uncommon in Jawoyn Country.

Figure 11.21 X-ray barramundi Image #78. Source: Photograph by Robert Gunn. In the overall sequence, there is a change in colour from red to yellow to white and polychrome  with basal white. Gunn et al. (2012) proposed that the turtle motif (Image #75) of Panel E1 has  stylistic connections – similarities in colour, size, form and visual impact – to paintings relating  to the apocalyptic Bula cult of ethnographic times (cf. Gunn 1992), suggesting a past association  between Nawarla Gabarnmang and that religious cult. The Bula cult incorporated restricted  rock art and non–rock art sites across a small area in northern Jawoyn Country, some 30 km  southwest of Nawarla Gabarnmang. The subsequent partial over-painting of the Bula-style turtle  on Panel E1 was seen by a senior Jawoyn man, Peter Bolgay (pers. comm. to Robert Gunn  2006), as indicating a change in the function of the site, shifting away from an association with  the Bula cult to becoming a place where visitors from the north of the plateau would camp while  attending ceremonies with Jawoyn (Gunn et al. 2012).  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="14"> 258    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 11.22 Image #79 painted on a smeared background (B) and subsequently partially over- painted by a second smear (A). Source: Photograph by Robert Gunn. The quality and proficiency of the brushwork on Panel E1 also changes noticeably over time.  Earlier paintings more often incorporate fine-line brushwork, occasionally also broad brushwork.  More recent paintings generally have broader line works, and even their finer details are applied  somewhat more coarsely than are the earlier line infills (Figures 11.23 and 11.24). Further  evidence for this change in conventions is the later partial re-decoration of Image #77, where an  orange mesh design uncomfortably overlies the brown gut pattern beneath, and a partial purple  infill of this mesh design has not been confined to the mesh compartments (Figure 11.25).

Dating painted Panel E1 at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land plateau    265  Excavation Square P In May 2012, we excavated a small,  50  ×  50  cm square immediately beneath  Panel E1 (Figures 11.4 and 11.26). Our aims  were threefold: • To find and date any (now dried) drops of  paint that may have fallen onto then-floor  surfaces at the time of painting, thereby  dating immediately overhanging paintings  in those colours. • To find and date fragments of pigment that  fell from the overlying ceiling paintings,  thereby giving minimum ages for those  paintings. • To date when the Panel E1 ceiling surface  was created, by finding and dating buried  slabs of rock from the previous ceiling  rock stratum before the current one was  painted, thereby giving a maximum age for  the painted Panel E1. Square P was excavated in 23 artificial  Excavation Units (XU) following the  stratigraphy (Table 11.4). Individual XUs  averaged 1.3 ± 0.3 cm in thickness. Excavation  proceeded to a maximum 29 cm depth when  a hard and continuous flat rock surface was  reached. That rock surface is not the bedrock, Figure 11.26 Square P before excavation, below  but a layer of rock that fell from the ceiling painted Panel E1.

Source: Photograph by Bruno David. Stratigraphy of Square P The Square P sediment sequence consists of the following SUs from the top downwards (Figure  11.28); SUs define the sediment layers, unlike XUs that relate to units of excavation. An XU is  almost always thinner than the SU in which it occurs. Where neighbouring sediment layers are  similarly composed, they are divided into sub-SUs, differentiated by a capital letter (e.g. SU1A,  SU1B) rather than given their own SU number: • SU1A: The loose, disturbed surface sediments of the current treadage zone, consisting of  fine, ashy, loamy sand with abundant charcoal. Sediments, dry at the time of excavation, are  homogeneous in colour, texture and content across the square and with depth. The changeover  to SU1B is ill-defined. No plants grow on the ground surface at the top of SU1A. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="23"> 11.  Dating painted Panel E1 at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land plateau    267  • SU1B: Similar in all respects to SU1A, only being differentiated by a slightly greater  consolidation of sediments. Like SU1A, SU1B is loose and should be treated as a near-surface,  disturbed deposit below the looser surface zone that is SU1A. A few dry leaves in vertical or  angled positions are present. Sediments are homogeneous across the square and with depth.  The changeover to SU2 is fairly marked but not sudden. • SU2: Moderately consolidated and slightly compact fine, ashy, loamy sand with abundant  charcoal and with animal bone. Sediments, dry at the time of excavation, are homogeneous in  colour, texture and content across the square and with depth. Rootlets are present. Sediments  are noticeably lighter in colour than SU1 above and SU3 below. The changeover to SU3A is  gradual, typically over c. 3 cm vertical depth, sometimes slightly more. • SU3A: In many ways similar to SU2, SU3A sediments are darker in colour with less abundant  charcoal. Rootlets are present throughout the square but less abundant than in SU2. Sediments  are homogeneous in colour, texture and content across the square and generally with depth, except  that during excavation small, c. 1 mm to 2 cm thick patches of consolidated and compact, very  fine, light-coloured powdery pigment coagulated around the dry, ashy, loamy sand that makes  up the bulk of SU3A occurred at c. 26 cm depth in XU18, with a minor presence continuing  down into XU19. These distinctive patches of coloured sediment are densely distributed across  much of XU18 (Figure 11.29), rapidly petering out towards the northeastern quadrant of  the square. These very numerous patches are, in plan view, typically c. 2 cm in diameter with  diffuse convex edges that often overlap at their margins because they are so abundant. They are  interpreted as drops of paint that fell on the ground during the painting of Panel E1, became  mixed with the surface ashy, loamy sand and then dried in situ (see below). The absence of dried  paint drops in the northeastern corner of the square matches well the edge of painted Panel  E1 overhead on the ceiling (see Figure 11.4, which was accurately mapped to sub-centimetre  accuracy by 3-D laser). The interface between SU3A and SU3B is marked in many parts of the  square and easily distinguished during excavation; in other parts, in the central and northern  sections, SU3A was intermixed with SU3B onto the basal rock. • SU3B: This SU is the lowermost c. 4 cm of the sediment sequence across much of the square,  although in some parts SU3B is intermixed with the basal levels of SU3A. Its sediments are  less ashy and less charcoal-rich fine, loamy sand than those of SU3A. SU3B sediments are  homogeneous in colour, texture and content across the square and with depth, and more  humid than in higher SUs, although never ‘wet’. Abundant, very fine rootlets grow against the  surface of the rock at the very base of SU3B. The rock surface reached at the base of SU3B is  flat across the square.

Ground penetrating radar Ground penetrating radar (GPR) was used at Nawarla Gabarnmang to map the depth to bedrock  and locate pieces of roof fall in the stratigraphic profile. A total of 28 GPR lines were positioned  in an approximately southeast to northwest orientation, with a spacing of 0.5 m between lines.  The GPR data were obtained using a Mala X3M unit with a 250 Mhz antenna using a sampling  frequency of 10038 Mhz, time window of 102 ns, trace interval of 0.02 m, 1024 samples and four  stacks. The data were processed and interpreted using ReflexW software using a suite of filters,  including move start time, dewow, energy decay, background remove, bandpass and time cut.  The methodology for processing GPR data is well summarised by Goodman and Piro (2013).

This methodology,  while necessary given the sub-surface conditions and the fixed geometry of the GPR transmitter  and receiver, introduces a degree of uncertainty into our depth calculations. Figure 11.30 Profile view (top) and interpretation (bottom) of GPR data from the southeast to  northwest ends of the rockshelter passing through Square P. Source: Illustration by Ian Moffat. Interpretation of the GPR data (Figure 11.30) focused on a transect running across Square P,  intended to map the geometry of the layer of rock that fell from the ceiling from the area of  Panel E1. The results show that the slab of rock that forms the base of the excavation is c. 30 cm  thick; it appears to sit over a deposit of unconsolidated sediment c. 30 cm thick. The bedrock  surface appears to deepen significantly to a maximum depth of c. 1 m in the centre of the GPR  line, rising nearly to the surface at the start and finish of the line. The base of Pillar 29 is indicated  near the southeastern end of the line. The depths of features appear to be slightly underestimated,  given that the surface of the rock slab appears by GPR at a depth of c. 25 cm, whilst it was found  at 30 cm in the excavation. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="27"> 11.  Dating painted Panel E1 at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land plateau    271  A particular problem with interpreting these data is reliably defining the exact bedrock surface.  This is due to the relatively low frequency of the antenna used; a 500 Mhz or higher instrument  would have been more appropriate for the depth of interest. The excavation, not having reached  bedrock, does not provide a ground truth for just where this surface is. A further challenge to  interpreting the data along the transect is the presence of blocks of roof-fall in localised places on  the ground surface. These surface irregularities may have caused significant lateral discontinuities  in the data, when the antenna bumped over the uneven ground surface during the survey. Despite these challenges in interpreting the GPR data, the survey has demonstrated the potential  of mapping the geometry of sub-surface features in rockshelter sites with this technique.  In particular, the ability of GPR to image the geomorphology of the sub-surface bedrock, and  so to validate whether an excavation ends on bedrock or on a slab of roof-fall, has important  implications for siting excavations and determining whether they have found the maximum  thickness of sediment within a site. Radiocarbon dates Forty accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates on individual pieces of charcoal  from Square P were obtained (Table 11.6). Throughout Square P, there is a high level of consistency  in the calibrated radiocarbon ages within individual SUs, but poor depth-age sequencing within  those SUs (Figure 11.28). That is, within a given SU the calibrated ages fit well within its  delimited age range, but there is poor depth-age progression. There is good age differentiation  between the SUs. It was not possible, therefore, to apply temporal constraints to the radiocarbon  chronology within SUs, so we have identified four Radiocarbon Phases on the basis of age alone.  To refine the chronological interpretation, the 14C ages are grouped into four Radiocarbon Phases  using the program Oxcal v4.2 (Bronk Ramsey 2009, 2013), and each phase is arranged within  a sequence separated by a boundary that provides an estimated date of transition (Figure 11.31).  All calibrated ages are based on the 68.3 per cent probability distributions. The uppermost and most recent Radiocarbon Phase 4 consists of all the radiocarbon  determinations with median ages of 180 cal BP or less, represented by all the radiocarbon dates  from XU13 and above except for Wk-39278 (337 ± 25 BP). All of these are in SU1A, SU1B,  SU2 or in the SU2/SU3A interface. The single exception, the slightly older charcoal sample Wk- 39278 from the surface XU1, is probably a sample that originated from deeper levels in areas  adjacent to Square P where trampling by feral water-buffalo has been documented, although the  ‘old wood’ problem (e.g. Spriggs 1989; Wesley et al. 2016) cannot be discounted. In Square P,  this treadage zone is limited to SU1A and SU1B. Radiocarbon Phase 3, preceding Radiocarbon Phase 4, consists of the radiocarbon determinations  with median ages from 390 to 510 cal BP, found throughout SU3A and its interfaces with SU2  above and SU3B below (the single exception of Wk-39278 notwithstanding, as discussed above).  Radiocarbon Phase 2 consists of all the radiocarbon determinations with median ages from 1030  to 1370 cal BP; these are all from SU3B or its interface with SU3A above it, indicating an  intermixing of Radiocarbon Phases 2 and 3 (and 4, see below) at this interface. Radiocarbon Phase 1 consists of all the radiocarbon determinations with median ages from  2580 to 4240 cal BP. Radiocarbon Phase 1 covers a wide time range whose many gaps indicate  multiple phases of activity condensed into the basal 1.1 cm of the excavation in XU22 or XU23,  immediately against or very close to the basal rock surface in SU3B or its interface with SU3A  above it where sediments from Radiocarbon Phases 2–4 are intermixed. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="28"> 272    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 11.31 Bayesian age model for Square P produced with OxCal v4.2 (see text for discussion). Note: To magnify the diagram please see the PDF version at:press.anu.edu.au Source: Illustration by Fiona Petchey. This evaluation shows that the end of Radiocarbon Phase 4 began no earlier than 350–260 cal BP  (1600–1690 AD), and may have taken place anytime between 210 and –10 cal BP (1740 and  1960 AD). It was closely preceded by Radiocarbon Phase 3, which began around 570–500 cal BP  (1380–1450 AD). There is no evidence of activity between this era and the end of Radiocarbon  Phase 2 (1090–990 cal BP), which may have been deposited as early as 1430–1330 cal BP.  Radiocarbon Phase 1 represents a diffuse set of events starting around 4660–4170 cal BP.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="29"> 11.

On the one hand, it could be charcoal redeposited through foot treadage or wind action onto  the exposed upper surface of the rock slab that now lies at the base of Square P after it collapsed  from the ceiling. As we have not yet excavated below that rock slab, we do not know the age  of the ground surface on which it fell; we therefore do not know whether there is any missing  temporal window between the underlying deposits, the time of ceiling collapse and the base of the  excavated deposits in Square P. Archaeological excavations across much of Nawarla Gabarnmang  find that late Holocene sediments immediately overlie late Pleistocene sediments in Squares D,  E, F, I+L+M, Q and R, squares that are 9–14 m west and west-southwest of Square P. In Square  A, 14 m southwest of Square P, late Holocene deposits immediately overlie early Holocene  sediments. Only in contiguous Squares C, G, K and N, 13–15 m southwest of Square P, do  late Holocene sediments overlie mid-Holocene sediments. In those excavation squares, at all  levels above sterile basal sands where these are present, sediments are rich in cultural materials,  including abundant charcoal throughout most of the late-Pleistocene to late-Holocene levels.  We can infer from this that when the rock slab that now lies at the base of Square P fell from the  ceiling (see below), the soft sediments then on or near the surface across most parts of the site  were of late Pleistocene age and could easily have been carried by foot, or blown by wind onto  nearby surfaces. The isolated radiocarbon determination of this age at the very base of Square P,  from a tiny charcoal sample weighing 0.01 g, suggests that this could be how the Pleistocene  charcoal fragment on top of the slab could have gotten there. On the other hand, it may be in its  ‘correct’ chronostratigraphic position, indicating that the slab fell around that time. Excavation  below the slab may resolve this question.

Dating painted Panel E1 at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land plateau    275  Geomorphological history of area around Square P Square P is located on the central-eastern side of the site, where widely spaced pillars create  an open space beneath a large, more or less flat ceiling (Figure 11.4). Immediately to the east,  this open space is delimited by the set of closely spaced Pillars 29–36, while to the west are the  moderately spaced Pillars 25–28. In this central-eastern part of the site that contains Square P, the  large ceiling measures 8 m wide by 12 m long. Elsewhere, from ground level to ceiling, the open  space is interrupted by numerous pillars. It is on the ceiling of this large, open space that we find  the most visually spectacular art panels at the site, including Panel E1.  Although Square P was shallow (29 cm deep) compared to the other excavation squares at  Nawarla Gabarnmang, it contained rich archaeological deposits of stone artefacts, faunal remains  and earth pigments dating to the past c. 4240 years, a similar period of time as that found in  Square B 5 m to the west. The accumulated sediments in both these squares signal a recent  history relative to the long sequences revealed in Squares A, D+H, F+I+L+M and E+J+O+Q+R,  which are all deeper (60–85 cm depth) and have an antiquity close to 50,000 years (David et al.  completed manuscript).  This study of Square P and its immediate surroundings prompts two questions: • Does the rock floor at the base of the square represent bedrock, or is it the upper surface of  a collapsed ceiling slab?  • Why are there no pillars in this part of the site?  To answer these questions, we turned to the archaeology, geomorphology and the 3-D laser map  of the site (cf. David et al. 2011, 2013, completed manuscript; Delannoy et al. 2013; Geneste et  al. 2010, 2012; see also Chapter 10).  Origin of the rock at the base of Square P To explore whether the rock surface at the base of Square P is bedrock or the upper surface of  a fallen ceiling slab, we looked at the configuration and geomorphology of the other excavated  squares across the site. Confirmed bedrock was reached in a number of squares (A, D+H, E+J,  F+I+L+M). These squares, all positioned close to pillars, are where the quarzitic bedrock is  dissected by geologically ancient narrow crevices along fissure lines. These crevices rapidly taper  to a depth of c. 20–35 cm below the bedrock surface (Figure 11.32). Square P is different in  that it is some distance from extant pillars, the surface of the rock at its base is flat and there are  no signs of a crevice or fissure in the basal rock. Initial indications are thus that the rock base  of Square P is not the bedrock, but a fallen (or positioned) slab. Further investigation enabled  a firmer determination. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="32"> 276    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 11.32 Section drawings of excavation squares, showing the relative depth of pits.

C: The area around Square P, looking south-southwestward. Source: Illustration by Jean-Jacques Delannoy. At first look, the spatial relationship between the area of Square P and the location of past pillars  is unclear, as some pillars across the site have been removed by people (Delannoy et al. 2013; see  Chapter 10). So the base of Square P may correspond with the location of a now-removed ancient  pillar whose base would have been at a high point of the bedrock. We addressed this question in  two ways. We began by examining the depth of the bedrock across the excavated squares. As these  are located along the northern (Squares F+I+L+M and E+J+O+Q+R) and southern (Squares  A, D+H and C+G+K+N) sides of the site, they enable a north–south transect to be drawn for  bedrock across the site (Figure 11.33).

The bedrock is approximately at the  same elevation: see the dashed line identifying  the level of the bedrock base in Squares  C+G+K+N, F+I+L+M, E+J+O+Q+R; Squares  A, B and D+H, excavated in 2010–2011, were  already back-filled when the laser scanning was  done in 2012, and therefore do not appear on  Figure 11.33. Figure 11.33 clearly shows the  rock at the base of Square P is higher than the  bedrock in the other squares. Three possibilities  can thus be entertained: 1) the bedrock is more  elevated at the centre of the site, as represented  by Square P; 2) the base of Square P represents  the base of an ancient, now-collapsed pillar;  or 3) the base of Square P represents the upper  surface of an ancient collapsed ceiling slab.  The first option is ruled out by observing the  dip of the bedrock around the pillars and on  the ceiling rock strata. Figure 11.34 (viewed in  3-D) shows well the sub-horizontal alignment  of the geological strata to the right (west) of  Square P.  To explore the second option, we analysed the  positions of pillars and ceiling fissure lines using  the 3-D model (Figure 11.35). This analysis  utilises the current distribution of pillars across Figure 11.35 Ceiling view of the central-eastern  the site, as well as the densely pillared, slightly and western parts of Nawarla Gabarnmang,  elevated area that delimits the open ‘courtyard’ showing the location of Square P.  on the southern side of the site.

Dating painted Panel E1 at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land plateau    279  Projection 2 (Figure 11.35B) shows the axes of the pillars with their parallel and criss-crossing  alignments (white lines: SSE–NNW; yellow lines: ENE–WSW). The natural fissures exposed  in the bedrock at the base of the excavations, aligned with matching ceiling fissures overhead,  parallel those criss-crossing pillar alignments (the corridors between the dashes). The extant  pillars are positioned where the two pillar axes meet. This on-site mapping coupled with the 3-D  model allows us to identify the tops of the missing pillars (Figure 11.36): these remnant pillars  on the ceiling are located where the alignments of the pillars cross. We can thus locate the pillars  that once existed in the eastern and northern side of the site, where the largest sections of painted  ceiling occur.  Figure 11.36 Southwest section of rockshelter, showing remnants of a missing pillar. Source: Photograph by Jean-Jacques Delannoy. To see whether the sparseness of pillars in the eastern side of the site was due to preferential  weathering and erosion (lateral variation of geological facies that would have caused the eastern  pillars to be less resistant), we have projected the NNW–SSE alignment of the pillars on the  edge of the densely pillared, slightly elevated area to the south of the site (Figure 11.37). This  projection, and the dense packing of pillars on the southern side, shows that these align along the  same axis as the pillars under the rockshelter. The two 3-D views shown in Figure 11.38 confirm  this. Figure 11.38A is a north–south view from the northern entrance of the site, with the  rockshelter shown in grey, the ‘courtyard’ to the south shown in green, the rock outcrop further  to the south shown in light yellow and the background (southern) pillars under the overhang of  the rockshelter shown in pink. This figure clearly shows the continuous alignment of the pillars  and of the voids between them. Figure 11.38B is a north–south view from the northern edge of  the rockshelter (numbered pillars and Square P), through the central courtyard (green) and the  northern edge of the densely pillared, slightly elevated area to the south of the site (light yellow).  On this latter edge, the alignment of the site’s pillars can be seen: for example, Pillar 28 of the  rockshelter aligns with the 28th pillar of the slightly elevated area to the south, and that sequence  of pillar alignments progresses in good order across space.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="36"> 280    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 11.37 Edge of the densely pillared, slightly elevated area to the south of the shelter. The spacing between the pillars differs noticeably from that inside the main shelter. This difference is not due to geological  causes, as the same pillar and inter-pillar alignments project across the two areas (see Figure 11.35), along with the action  of comparable weathering processes. The difference is due to the actions of people, who have altered the geological matrix  in the shelter (and commenced also to remove pillars in the western part of the southern rock outcrop shown at the extreme  right-hand side of the photograph). Source: Photograph by Jean-Jacques Delannoy. These results allow us to conclude:  • The low density of pillars in the eastern part of the site is not due to differential weathering  and erosion. The edge of the slightly elevated area to the south of the rockshelter demonstrates  the regular presence of pillars along the same alignments as within the rockshelter. The same  logic should thus also apply to the eastern part of the site where pillars are absent.  • The rock base in Square P does not correspond with the base of an ancient pillar, as the  location of the square does not correspond with the alignment of the pillars (see Figure 11.35);  instead, it is positioned along the NNE–SSW alignment of fissure lines in the bedrock. Those  fissure lines are evident as narrow crevices in the bedrock that now lies underground and  has been revealed in the excavations at the base of Squares A, D+H and F+I+L+M, and as  corresponding fissures along the ceiling overhead. Overall, the spatial configuration of the bedrock (Figure 11.33) and the distribution and  alignment of extant and ancient pillars (Figure 11.35) enable us to be sure the rock base in  Square P is neither an elevated part of the bedrock nor the base of a pillar. But it is consistent  with a rock slab fallen from the ceiling. The location of the high points revealed by GPR mapping  (Figure 11.30; see above) corresponds to the alignment of the pillars, so those high points can be  interpreted as the bases of disappeared pillars. The GPR cross-section also confirms that Square  P is located to the right of a deepening of the bedrock, consistent with the formation of a crevice  caused by the weathering and evacuation of weathered products along fissure lines over long  geological time frames. This convergence of geological, GPR and 3-D modelling evidence lead us to conclude that the  rock at the base of Square P is the upper surface of a collapsed portion of the ceiling rock rather  than the actual bedrock of the shelter. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="37"> 11.

This extant art could only have been made after the current ceiling rock surface was formed. Figure 11.34 shows various views of the Square P area. Figure 11.34A is a view of the ceiling with  its art panels, exposed geological strata, and the extant pillars. Figure 11.34B is a ground view  showing the blocks exposed on the surface, and the edges of extant rock strata. Figure 11.34C  shows the flatness of the ceiling, which is related to the sub-horizontality of the quartzitic strata  (with strata D1 and D2 as the base layers) and to the resistance of those strata to weathering  and erosion. In this part of the site, rock art predominantly occurs on stratum D2, less often on  stratum D1. Along more northern and southern parts of the site, rock art is also found on a large  surface of stratum D4 (not shown on Figure 11.34C). These views show that no art phase on Panel E1 above Square P could have been done until  strata D0 and D1 had fallen from the ceiling. The remnant ledges on the edges of strata D0 and  D1 clearly have a rectilinear geometry, indicating where the missing strata have collapsed. This  collapse took place when there were no pillars to give structural support. Here, the geometry  of the remnant broken edges does not align with geological points of weakness; i.e. the broken  edges do not align with the network of fissures. This is particularly visible on Figure 11.34,  where the northern and southern edges of the overhang (transition slabs D3-2 and D4; see  Figure 11.34A) are not aligned along these fissure lines (shown as white and yellow dashes in  Figure 11.35B), but rather cut across them. This non-alignment of ceiling surface edges relative  to the natural fissure lines results from ceiling slab collapse caused by an absence of structural  support and ensuing mechanical stress, rather than from mechanical failure along zones of  weakness. The  ledge  separating the rock art–bearing Panels G-E4-H from Panels F1-E1-E2- E3-E5 corresponds to an area of weakness (fissure line) running in an ENE–WSW direction.  The eastern rectilinear ledge of rock stratum D2 (Panel E1) and the fissure that runs through  stratum D2 (between Panels E1 and D) are aligned with lines of weakness oriented SSE–NNW  (Figure 11.34). These ceiling strata ledges correspond to the edges of slab collapses. Analysis of the two collapsed  strata D0 and D1, and their respective ledges, indicates that these collapses, whose exact timing  we do not know, certainly did not all happen at the same time. In the area of Square P, we know  that stratum D1, which caused the exposure of stratum D2, became exposed on the ceiling  sometime before 3839 ± 25 BP (4150–4410 cal BP; see Table 11.6, Figure 11.28), as indicated  by the minimum age for the collapse of the slab at the base of Square P. If the flat surface of the  ceiling above Square P can be matched to the separation plane (the sub-horizontal joint) between  strata D1 and D2, then we could conclude that the flat surface of the ceiling probably relates to  a lack of pillars in this part of the site. In other parts of the site, ceilings with extant pillars are  corbelled, and between pillars their flat surfaces are much smaller (e.g. the space between Pillars  21–23 and Pillars 25–27 that house art Panels K2–K3; see Figure 11.34A). If the flat surface  of the ceiling above Square P relates to an absence of pillars in this part of the site before the  collapse of stratum D1, then the question must be asked: What caused those pillars to disappear?  This question is the more significant because the ground around Square P is relatively flat and  its few large blocks suggest an absence of accumulated collapsed rocks below ground. The blocks  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="39"> 11.  Dating painted Panel E1 at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land plateau    283  of stone in this part of the site are mostly small and tend to sit on the ground surface, unlike other  parts of the site where large and partly buried blocks emanate above ground level. These small  and tabular surface blocks cannot account for the roof collapse, or for the mass of rock from the  missing pillars. The west side of the site (not mapped in Figure 11.34; see Chapter 10) demonstrates two  important features. First, the collapse of pillars creates an uneven, densely cluttered floor surface.  Second, from this we can conclude that some blocks from collapsed pillars in areas with flat  surfaces were physically removed from the shelter; there is ample evidence of this in the large  quantities of anthropically removed blocks, immediately outside the northern dripline in  particular (see Delannoy et al. 2013). The absence of accumulated blocks, and the flatness of  the ground surface in the area of Square P, indicate that many blocks from the collapsed pillars  were removed before the collapse of stratum D1, at least in the area north of a line linking Pillars  28–31. Although the area south of this line lies under the same ceiling stratum (D2) as the area  immediately to the north, the ground surface there is more chaotic and includes numerous  blocks from stratum D1. These observations allow us to conclude (see Figure 11.39): 1. Fallen blocks from 12 now-missing pillars were removed from the large, open central part  of the site by people, whatever the cause(s) of those pillar collapses. Both the pillar collapses  and the removal of their blocks pre-date the fall of stratum D1. 2. The absence of pillars from the large, open central part of the site led to the collapse of the  entire stratum D1 from the ceiling in the space between Pillars 28, 27, 31 and 34. This  collapse must have taken place before c. 4240 cal BP, possibly during terminal Pleistocene  times, as indicated by the minimum age of the stratum D1 collapse evident at the base  of Square P. 3. Strata D2–D3 subsequently collapsed along the northern and southern edges of the  site, exposing new flat surfaces upon which large panels of rock art were then created,  Panel J1 in the north and Panel C2 in the south (see Figure 11.4). The collapse of the strata  D2–D3 should have created a higher ground level in this part, but the reverse occurred:  the ground level is slightly lower than in the central, open part of the site (Figure 11.33).  This lowering of the ground level, and the blocks immediately outside the northern  overhang in particular, result from removal of blocks under the overhang to beyond the  dripline. This anthropogenic change to the site took place before the fall of stratum D1, i.e.  before c. 4240 cal BP. It is evidence of the social modification of a very large rockshelter  through aménagement and inhabitation (cf. Delannoy et al. 2013; Thomas 2008; see also  Chapter 10). 4. Today, we see numerous horizontal slabs of rock on the present ground surface. Local  Jawoyn Elders call these ‘pillows’ (see Delannoy et al. 2013). Examination of one (slab ‘a’ on  Figures 11.34B and 11.34C) indicates that it is not in its original position; it has come from  the localised collapse of a section of stratum D0 near Pillar 34; its repositioning onto the  ceiling was digitally tested with the 3-D model. After it fell from the ceiling, it was moved  by people to its current location (red arrow on Figure 11.34B). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="40"> 284    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 11.39 Geomorphological reconstitution of the area around Square P.

Our major aim is to understand better the sequence of paintings on  Panel E1 overhead, and their cultural context. A total of 793 definite stone artefacts weighing 304.8 g were recovered from Square P, nearly  half from the uppermost XU1 to XU8 (Table 11.7; Figure 11.40). Stone artefacts weigh on  average 0.38 g, and the vast majority (89.4 per cent, n = 708) measure &lt;10 mm in maximum  length. They appear to represent the by-products of on-site artefact manufacturing or retouching,  an issue to be addressed in detail elsewhere.

A total of 10 modified artefacts other than the ground-edge axe fragments, all tools or tool  fragments, were recovered from the topmost 12 XUs of Square P; all are made on quartzite  (Figure 11.42). They include three unifacial, two bifacial and one unclassifiable point, as defined  by Brindley and Clarkson (2015) (Figure 11.43). The unclassifiable point does not possess  evidence of retouching, but its pointed distal end coupled with the presence of multiple fractures  diagnostic of high velocity impact suggest that it is the tip of a projectile point (the complete left  margin of the artefact has been removed by a burinating fracture along a length of 7.3 mm; tip  crushing extends onto the dorsal face; the distal end of the dorsal face has a 2.7 mm long fracture  scar with a step termination; the end of the ventral face has a fracture scar 0.7 mm long with  a step termination). Macro-fracture types diagnostic of high-velocity impacts, sometimes in the  form of negative and sometimes as positive fracture lips 1 to 2 mm long with step terminations  (Brindley and Clarkson 2015; Geneste and Plisson 1990, 1993; Normand et al. 2008; O’Farrell  2004), are also present on two of the five definite excavated points and suggest that they were also  used as projectile points.

Dating painted Panel E1 at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land plateau    289  Cultural materials in Square P: Faunal remains The faunal assemblage from Square P consists of a moderate quantity of fragmentary bones  and teeth (Table 11.7), some mammalian faecal material and a tiny quantity of freshwater  bivalve shell. Well-preserved macropodid (wallaby or kangaroo) faecal pellets were recovered from XU2 and  XU3. Other faecal material from XU1 and XU3 adheres to unburnt bone fragments and contains  abundant mammal hair. These are interpreted as fragments of dog faeces. One example from  XU1 contains part of a caudal vertebra of a macropodoid, while another also from XU1 contains  a complete thoracic vertebra of an agamid (dragon lizard). Another example from XU3 contains  a small sliver of unburnt cortical bone, probably from a medium-sized mammal. Shell fragments, all from XU4–XU5, have a total weight of 0.03 g. The fragments are extremely  fragile and breaking up into laminar sheets. The highest concentrations of bones and teeth were recovered from XU1–XU8, with a reduced  quantity in XU9–XU13, and only occasional small fragments in XU14–XU22 (Table 11.7;  Figure 11.40). The bulk of the assemblage thus dates from Radiocarbon Phase 4, i.e. since c. 180  cal BP. The oldest recovered remains from XU22 might be as old as the end of Radiocarbon  Phase  2 (c. 990–1090 cal BP), but are more likely associated with the start of Radiocarbon  Phase 3 (500–570 cal BP). The most recent bones and teeth from XU1–XU3 are exceptionally and uniformly well-preserved,  and show a relatively low prevalence of burning (Figure 11.44). Most remains from XU4–XU6  are similarly well-preserved; however, a few unburnt fragments show extensive corrosion along  root channels and/or areas of surface damage interpreted as consumption by termites. Damage  of both kinds becomes increasingly more prevalent from XU7 to XU15. Below XU15, virtually  all of the recovered bone is heavily burnt to the point of being fully calcined (Figure 11.44);  these fragments are visibly corroded and, with the exception of a few fragments of tooth crown,  are taxonomically uninformative. The changes in the physical condition of the faunal remains  through the deposit point to an aggressive preservation environment in which bones and even  teeth are degraded to the point of non-recovery even by fine-scale excavation methods within  a period of centuries. The principal degradation processes in this environment are likely to be  microbial attack, much of it associated with rootlet contact and penetration, the acidity of  sediments and direct consumption by termites (Hedges 2002; Jans et al. 2004). Fungal attack  may also be prevalent, but this tends to work on the internal structure of bone and be less visible  macroscopically. The total sample contained 48 individual fragments for which it was possible to make a taxonomic  determination to family level or below (Table 11.9). This includes a minimum of seven mammal  species, including a species of quoll (Dasyurus sp.), an unidentified bandicoot (Peramelidae or  Thyaclomyidae), the northern brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula arnhemensis), a small  rodent (the grassland melomys – Melomys burtoni) and at least three species of macropodid  distinguishable by size. Small macropodid remains are probably from a rock wallaby (Peradorcas  concinna) and/or a species of nail-tail wallaby (Onychogalea sp.). A medium-sized taxon is almost  certainly the agile wallaby (Macropus agilis). Larger remains might be from the black wallaroo  (M. bernardus), the antilopine wallaroo (M. antilopinus) and/or the euro (M. robustus). None are  identified with certainty as diagnostic elements are absent. The agamid lizard remains include  one dentary from XU6 positively determined as a frilled lizard (Chlamydosaurus kingii). A small  crocodile, probably less than 1 m in total length, is represented by a small fragment of maxilla in  XU2. A single calcined teleost fish vertebra comes from XU10.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="46"> 290    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 11.44 Square P: Burning composition (by weight) of recovered bones and teeth through  the stratigraphic profile. Carbonised = burnt but with retained carbon; calcined = all carbon has been pyrolised. Source: Illustration by Jerome Mialanes. Medium-sized macropodid (M. agilis) remains make up nearly 50 per cent of the total sample  of  identified fragments, with small macropodids and the brushtail possum accounting for  13 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively. The agile wallaby, which inhabits grassland/savannah  habitats, appears to have been favoured during Radiocarbon Phase 4 times from c. 180 cal BP.  Brushtail possums are found in most habitats, including savannah and rocky gorges and  breakaways. Noteworthy in the assemblage from Square P is the high incidence of human modifications  to bone fragments: the application of red ochre to bone surfaces; the occurrence of clusters of  fine scratches and shaving marks (presumably made with stone artefacts); and modification by  grinding. Examples of both ochre application and scratches/shaving marks occur in most XUs  from XU1 to XU5; older examples are perhaps not recognised due to root and termite damage to  the bone surfaces. Only one example of grinding was observed, on a small, unburnt cortical bone  fragment from XU2. Bone from other parts of the site displays the same kinds of modifications.  A detailed account of the entire assemblage is in preparation. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="47"> 11.

They occur as three different  types: 1. Paint drops that fell from the ceiling and/or brushes as paintings were made immediately  above the square. These fell as wet drops of paint, coagulated on the sandy surface when it  was at the depth of XU18, impregnating the ashy loamy sand sometimes down to the level  of XU19, and dried in situ. These now-dried paint drops were sampled during excavation  as slightly accreted concentrations of pigment mixed with incorporated ashy loamy sand. 2. Tiny solid pigment pieces (2–3 mm long, the 2 mm minimum size representing the mesh  size of the sieves used in the excavation) to small (up to 1.7 cm long) fragments of pigment. 3. Small painted rocks (from 4 mm to 6 mm long), each consisting of a thin quartzite spall  covered by a thin reddish layer of pigment on a single surface. Both paint drops and solid pigment pieces were investigated by macroscopic observation and by  microanalytical techniques (e.g. scanning electron microscope coupled with energy-dispersive  X-Ray spectroscopy [SEM-EDX]; X-ray fluorescence [XRF]) coupled with structural techniques  (e.g. Raman microspectroscopy; X-ray diffraction [XRD]). A sample of pieces was analysed with  a LEO Stereoscan 440 SEM with a Brucker SDD X-FLASH 4030 EDX, in high-vacuum mode  at 20 kV. The elemental composition of the excavated pieces was analysed with a Bruker S1  Titan 500 portable X-Ray Fluorescence (pXRF) analyser equipped with a rhodium tube, a SDD  detector and a 5 mm collimator (acquisition parameters: for 10 keV, 30 s live-time count and  for 30 keV, 30 s live-time count). XRF analysis revealed major chemical components. XRD  and Raman microspectroscopy were used to determine chemical structures. XRD patterns were  measured by a diffractometer with an INEL XRG-3000 generator, an INEL CPS 120 curved  detector (within an angular range of 0° to 120°, in 2θ), equipped with an anticathode in Cobalt  (ʎCo = 1.78897 Å) and a monochromator plan in Silicon. The Raman spectra were obtained with  a green laser at 514 nm with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba T640000 equipped with a microscope (at ×10,  ×50 and ×100 magnification). Paint drops As each paint drop sample contained a combination of fine pigment powder and ashy loamy  sand, the powder was hand-separated under a binocular microscope. The powder samples are  unambiguously dried paint drops because of 1) their physical characteristics as slightly accreted  powder patches embedded in the ashy loamy sand; 2) their sudden appearance on an ancient  ground surface beginning at c. 26 cm depth in XU18; 3) the sub-rounded plan shape of the  individual accreted sample patches; and 4) the rapidly decreasing volumes of the individual  patches with depth.  Six phials of light-coloured (Munsell: 7.5YR 4/3 brown [4 samples] to 7.5YR 6/4 light brown  [2 samples]) pigmented sediment were analysed from XU18, representing paint drops excavated as  dry pigment powder accreted around the ashy loamy sand. These pigment-rich sediments contrast  with the homogeneous and unpigmented, very dark brown (7.5YR 3/1) to dark-brown (7.5YR 3/2)  ashy loamy sand that surrounds them in SU3A (these Munsell colours were measured on sediments  from each of the surrounding XU16, XU17 and XU20, where dried paint drops are absent).  SEM-EDX analysis indicates that the ashy loamy sand from XU18 is largely made up of Si, Al,  Fe, P, Ca and Ti, with K, Na and Mg also present as minor elements. Five of the six dried paint  samples show a composition similar to the ashy loamy sand; the sixth (XU18 in situ sample #4),  one of the two light-brown samples, was different. It contained a higher incidence of Al than the  other samples, and a crystalline morphology consisting of plates (e.g. Figure 11.45).  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="49"> 11.  Dating painted Panel E1 at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land plateau    293  Figure 11.45 EDX spectrum of light-coloured pigment powder from XU18 in situ sample #4. Source: Illustration by Emilie Chalmin. The elemental composition of that different light-brown pigment powder is distinctive from  both the ashy loamy sand in which it is embedded, and from the other dried paint drop samples:  it exhibits high Ca and P values (2 per cent as CaO and 7 per cent as P2O5), with minor Si, Al,  Na, Mg, S, Cl and K, and a fluffy pellet morphology. For the paint drop samples, the only structure identified through XRD is quartz. Nevertheless, it  is not possible to determine if the quartz really comes from the paint or if its presence is due to  contamination from the surrounding sediment. The structure of the light-coloured powder was  more difficult to identify due to its weak crystallinity. The two light-brown patches of pigmented ashy loamy sand sampled from XU18 mainly consist  of alumino-silicates. One of these patches also contains apatite (Ca5(PO4)3(OH, F, Cl)).  The presence of apatite could suggest that the pigment was mixed with crushed bone in the making  of a paint paste. However, apatite is rarely found in the dried paint drops of Square P, whereas  it should be represented in numerous samples if the pigment had been systematically mixed  with crushed bone. We thus conclude that the apatite found amidst the dried paint drop sample  from XU18 more likely comes from a tiny fragment of heavily degraded bone that happened  to lie in the ground at this level and that was included in the phial during sampling. A tiny,  light-coloured fragment of heavily degraded bone was also separately sampled from XU20, and  subsequently identified in the laboratory as apatite, confirming the presence of degraded bone in  these sediments (see also the faunal remains section, above). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="50"> 294    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Solid pigment pieces  One hundred and ninety-seven solid pieces of pigment (red, orange, brown, yellow, yellow- and-red, white) were excavated from Square P. They are all tiny to very small. None have the  morphology of fallen flakes of paint; rather, they all appear to be by-products of the on-site  processing of originally larger lumps of pigment.

Note: The surface traces of black on individual pieces are ashy sediments from the archaeological layers from which they  were excavated. Source: Photographs by Géraldine Castets. All pieces, regardless of their colouration, have a dull, earthy lustre. The three solid white  pieces from XU4 and XU15 have a compact powder texture that produces a white streak  (Figure 11.46A). In contrast, 11 pieces, some red, some orange, have strongly porous textures  and a high iron content (Figure 11.46B). The great majority of pieces – 183 tiny to small red,  orange, yellow, and yellow-and-red lumps – contain iron oxides that would produce reddish or  yellowish streaks when rubbed (Figure 11.46C, 11.46D and 11.46E). Some have a compact  powdery texture, whereas others have a few cracks on their surfaces. Four of the 60 red pieces  reveal a metallic lustre characteristic of a ‘pure’ iron mineral.  All the solid pieces other than the white ones contain iron (Fe) in varied proportions, the iron  causing their colouration. According to the results of the elemental analyses (Figure 11.47),  iron is not associated with any other major chemical element (Si, Al, Ca and P). It reveals that the  iron apparently only occurs in the form of oxide. It is difficult to classify the samples into a set of  distinct chemical groups, as there is considerable overlap in the chemistries of individual samples. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="51"> 11.

Source: Illustration by Emilie Chalmin. Alumino-silicates (presence of Si and Al) are only detected by XRF (which identifies the elements)  and not by XRD (which reveals the structure of compounds). Two different Si:Al ratios are  revealed by XRF quantitative analysis – 1:1 and 2:1 – indicating clays such as kaolinite and  muscovite respectively. Weakly crystallised clay minerals may also be present. Some tiny red pieces &lt;2 mm long excavated from XU14 were ground into powder to allow further  analyses. A maghemite (γ-Fe2O3)/magnetite (Fe3O4) structure has been identified by XRD for  one of these powdered pieces (Figure 11.48), whereas goethite (FeOOH) has been detected on  a solid yellow piece that also came from XU14. However, in these samples, the iron oxides are  always mixed with abundant quartz grains from the deposit that makes the identification of the  minor compounds difficult.  Raman microspectroscopy clearly identifies the presence of haematite (Fe2O3) on several red  pieces from XU14. A number of white particles, each a few micrometres long, embedded in the  red matrix of sample A74PXU14R from XU14, were identified as rutile (TiO2) (Figure 11.49). The structural characterisation of several solid pieces of pigment confirms the presence of multiple  compounds within individual pieces. Some of the iron oxides are well crystallised, others less so.  The poorly crystallised oxides and clays are not always clearly identified. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="52"> 296    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 11.48 XRD pattern of a sample of red pigment from XU14  (laboratory sample code: A74PXU14_powder).

Dating painted Panel E1 at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land plateau    297  Painted rocks Nine samples are small fragments of rock with red or orange pigment adhering on one surface  only (Figure 11.46F). In all cases, the rock matrix is quartzitic sandstone. The continuous  coloured layer covering the rock is largely iron oxide. The composition of these pigment layers  is compatible with the similarly coloured solid pieces of pigment, but it could also be due to  weathering of the rock surface prior to its falling, presumably from the ceiling. The pigmented  surface could not have attained its colouring after burial as 1) only one face is coloured in each  case; and 2) alteration of the rock would have required exposure to air if it was a natural by- product of surface weathering.  Discussion of the excavated pigments The excavated dried paint drops were overwhelmingly found in XU18 during excavation, with  a  minor presence in XU19. These paint drops fell onto an old, ashy loamy sand surface as  paintings were made overhead. That much of the surface area was covered by now-dried paint  drops in XU18 suggests a major painting event between 390–510 cal BP (Radiocarbon Phase 3),  the time when the level of XU18 was the floor in this part of the site. The light colour of the  paint drops indicates that this painting event made light-coloured, off-white paintings rather  than yellow or red paintings. We identify this painting event with Panel E1 art Phases IV, V  (see  Figures 11.12–11.14) or Phase VI (see Figure 11.15), the three phases when numerous  paintings in light-coloured pigments were made immediately overhead. Solid pieces of pigment are found pretty much continuously through the stratigraphic sequence  (Figure 11.50). The quantity of such solid pieces varies with depth, although no clear patterning is  evident in the chrono-stratigraphic distribution of particular colours. The solid pieces of pigment  may relate to rock art or to other kinds of painting activity, such as the coating of bone with red  ochre that is evident in Square P and elsewhere at Nawarla Gabarnmang. We cannot determine  whether or not these solid pieces of pigment relate to the Panel E1 art, although they do suggest  repeated painting activity at Nawarla Gabarnmang given their high frequencies throughout the  Square P sediment sequence. Small, probably exfoliated pieces of painted rock were recovered from XU3 (4 pieces), XU6  (1 piece), XU7 (2 pieces) and XU15 (2 pieces). These are too small to indicate which items of  rock art they came from, and only suggest minimum ages of 390–510 cal BP (the age of the  ground levels onto which the small painted rock fragments fell) for the earliest artistic activities  in this part of the site. Chemical analysis has confirmed that the yellow solid pieces consist of goethite. The orange and  red pieces owe their colours to the presence of iron oxides in the form of haematite and/or  maghemite/magnetite. Maghemite can form naturally by weathering or by low-temperature  oxidation of spinels containing ferrous iron, commonly magnetite. Its presence can also reveal  heating in direct contact with organic materials (at moderate temperatures of &lt;350°C, reachable  in small open fires). The presence of red and orange pieces enriched in maghemite at Nawarla  Gabarnmang Square P may indicate that these pieces of ochre have been in contact with wood  and/or animal fats in a fireplace (see Cornell and Schwertmann 2003; Grogan et al. 2003;  Salomon et al. 2015; Schwertmann and Cornell 2000). This evidence of probable heating of  ochres at Nawarla Gabarnmang may indicate purposeful heat alteration of lumps of ochre for the  production of paint pastes, or accidental heating in the presence of campfires. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="54"> 298    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 11.50 Square P: Number of solid pieces of pigment by colour, by XU. Source: Illustration by Emilie Chalmin. Conclusion Our varied studies allow a series of clear conclusions about the painted rock art on Panel E1  at Narwala Gabarnmang:  1. The large, flat ceiling area encompassing art Panel E1 was caused by roof fall following  the removal of supporting pillars sometime before c. 4240 cal BP, and possibly in late  Pleistocene times. 2. The rock base of Square P is not bedrock, but a large slab of roof fall (stratum D1) that must  date to c. 4240 cal BP or older. 3. As the extant art on the ceiling surface at Panel E1 can only have been produced after the  collapse of stratum D1 from the ceiling, it must be more recent than c. 18,594 cal BP, and  possibly is more recent than c. 4240 cal BP. 4. The evidence from stratified ochre in Square P, paint drops and small painted rocks indicates  a major painting event during Radiocarbon Phase 3; this suggests that the bulk of the art  in Panel E1 was produced 390–510 cal BP. 5. The light colour of the paint drops indicates white or off-white or light tan coloured  pigments, rather than yellows or reds; so it is most likely to be associated with the most  recent period of rock art production (artistic Phases IV, V or VI). With an occupation history approaching 50,000 years and rock art dating to at least 27,000  years ago (David et al. completed manuscript, 2013, 2014), Nawarla Gabarnmang has a well- documented chronology of long occupation and art production.

Dating painted Panel E1 at Nawarla Gabarnmang, central-western Arnhem Land plateau    299  Panel E1 and excavation of Square P directly below it have allowed a further chronological  refinement relating to the production of art at the site, clearly indicating that, although the  paintings on Panel E1 are relatively recent, art production took place repeatedly over long periods  of time at Nawarla Gabarnmang.
