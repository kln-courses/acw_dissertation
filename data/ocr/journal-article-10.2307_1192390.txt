BAUMAN* Like many other parts of the world during the past two decades, my own country of Canada has seen governments at all levels-federal, provincial, and municipal-undertake programs to privatize key enterprises, agencies, and functions.1 After World War II, Canada's public policymakers committed the country to Keynesian economic planning, one feature of which was a dynamic public sector designed to stimulate aggregate demand and to promote high rates of employment and social and economic stability.2 The shift to privatization re- flects an international trend that, even if it falls short of a late twentieth-century Copyright ? 2001 by Richard W.

The situation in the United States differs because there has never been a comparable concentration of ownership in the public sector, and deregulation has been a more common strategy than asset sales.

It can take various forms, including (1) the complete or partial sell-off (through asset or share sales) of major public en- terprises; (2) the deregulation of a particular industry; (3) the commercializa- tion of a government department; (4) the removal of subsidies to producers; and (5) the assumption by private operators of what were formerly exclusively public services, through, for example, contracting out.9 Another form of priva- tization, the distribution of vouchers to citizens (who do not pay for their stake when they use the vouchers to obtain shares in a formerly state-owned enter- 3.

The retreat of governments from economic control and public responsibilities-not only in the West, but also in Latin America, Asia, and Central and Eastern Europe-has been analyzed and lauded in DANIEL YERGIN &amp; JOSEPH STANISLAW, THE COMMANDING HEIGHTS: THE BATTLE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND THE MARKETPLACE THAT IS REMAKING THE MODERN WORLD (1998). Yergin and Stanislaw describe the process as a "vast drama" that, according to their chronol- ogy, has antecedents in 1776 with the start of the American Revolution and the publication of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations.

There is a growing consensus in the community of states to lift border controls for the flow of capital, information, and services and, more broadly, to further global- ization. But when it comes to immigrants and refugees, whether in North America, Western Europe, or Japan, the national state claims all its old splendor in asserting its sovereign right to control its borders.

To what extent is this motivated by anti- bureaucratic ideology or simple distrust of government,1 in addition to consid- erations of economic efficiency?1 Privatization proposals often appeal to a clas- sical liberal view that economic decisionmaking is best left to private ordering or the exercise of individual preferences through the mechanisms of private property and freedom of contract.13 The provenance of this tradition can be traced back to the publication in the seventeenth century of John Locke's Two Treatises of Government, which described the permissible limits of government action in terms of preserving the individual property-owner's security and lib- erty.14 Individual citizens-who are frequently re-cast in the role of "consum- ers" of goods and services in the rhetoric of privatization debates-should be free to make decisions and arrange their priorities without submitting to com- mand institutions or government paternalism.1 In the words of a contemporary 10.

PRIVATIZATION, PROPERTY, AND THE EMERGENCE OF NEW MARKET ECONOMICS 57 (Gregory S. Alexander &amp; Grazyna Skapska eds., 1994). Another perspective on the so-called "shock therapy" approach used in Russia-involving rapid price liberalization, stabilization, and privatization-has been offered by Andrei Shleifer. See ANDREI SHLEIFER &amp; ROBERT W. VUISHNY, THE GRABBING HAND: GOVERNMENT PATHOLOGIES AND THEIR CURES 227-53 (1998). Blame for the problems associated with Russian privatization has been attributed to a "market fundamentalist bias," as well as cronyism and corruption. See George Soros, "Who Lost Russia?," N.Y.

Gray makes the controversial claim that the former is a "condition and a component" of the latter. Id. at 61. The conceptual connection identified by Gray does not by itself justify a wholly laissez-faire approach to government policy, for many writers sympa- thetic to classical liberalism concede some grounds for legitimate government intervention.

Absent compelling reasons for administering goods through a public agency, the processes of production and distribution should be left to market forces.19 Governments should be scaled back and be- come less dirigiste. Under this theory, market discipline is preferable to the use of administrative directions, public ownership, controls, plans, or regulations.20 Legislators supporting privatization initiatives are less likely to cite Locke, however, than to invoke the virtues of efficiency, competition (both domestic and international), debt reduction, the stimulation of trade, and higher rates of share ownership among citizens.2' From the perspective of agency theory, which takes into account the costs associated with incentives and monitoring, private ownership of an enterprise should provide superior efficiency.22 Agency theo- rists conceive of an organization as a series of contracts.23 This nexus-of- contracts analysis, while not uncontroversial, usefully illuminates the policy as- pects at stake in the debate over private versus public enterprise.2 When set- ting up a private firm, owners of the enterprise contract with managers to pro- 16.

Free markets, individual preferences, and the profit motive are arguably no more natural than any other socially constructed matrix of interaction and personal formation. See, e.g., SUNSTEIN, supra note 13, at 41 ("Private preferences are partly a product of available opportunities, which are a function of legal rules.").

Because the private firm measures success in terms of profit, managerial contracts typically include incentives that reflect the level of the firm's performance.25 Executive compensation can be paid not only in salary and performance bonuses, but also in the form of equity, such as shares or share options. In a public enterprise, the latter, alternative types of reward are un- available to civil servants.26 Thus, public enterprises lack the full range of incen- tives necessary in contemporary business administration to make managers ac- countable for economic performance.27 Agency theory also addresses the costs of monitoring. This, too, is arguably more effective when the enterprise is privately operated. The owners and man- agers are assumed to have interests and objectives that often diverge.28 In a pri- vate firm, the board of directors is supposed to supervise the firm's manage- ment to ensure that officers and employees do not shirk their duties or engage in disloyal conduct.29 Directors are compensated for performing this supervi- sory task, and, again, the amount of the directors' fees can be geared to the firm's overall profitability. The market for executive talent will also prompt managers to act in a way that makes them desirable to other firms. By contrast, government officials do not enjoy the same market for talent. In addition, monitoring their activities through democratic governmental processes is spo- radic and difficult. Unlike a private firm, whose single goal is to make profits, the aims of a public enterprise are often vaguely expressed and distinctive to that particular agency; different public enterprises might have different goals in terms of balancing their political mandate against profit maximization.30 When the agency's mission is so confused, ascertaining what is in the "public interest" or "common good" is no easy task. The public monitors themselves-elected representatives-are prone to follow their own political aims. Public choice theory, developed by economists to account for political action, attributes to politicians and bureaucrats alike relatively meretricious motives. That is, in performing their duties, public offi- 25. On the strict contractual view, a firm does not have to be devoted to maximizing short-term profits; its aims could be negotiated at the time the corporation is formed. Different rights to divi- dends, fixed payouts, or residual value could be negotiated among different classes of investors. See EASTERBROOK &amp; FISCHEL, supra note 23, at 36-37. 26. The obverse of this argument, of course, is that the use of stock options for executive compen- sation can lead corporate managers to pay undue attention to the firm's short-term performance, at the expense not only of the long-term fortunes of the corporation, but also the "nation's long-run economic interests."

See Robert Howse, Accountability in Public and Private Enterprise: The Uneasy Case for Priva- tization, in ERA OF CHANGE, supra note 1, at 129 (questioning whether civil servant management in- centives might be adopted to increase accountability, so that "public-sector restructuring" rather than privatization would be a better choice of policy instrument). 28.

They use the system to appropriate benefits for themselves at public expense.31 This might take the form of bureaucrats enlarging the size of their own staff or their influence, instead of striving to serve clients or citizens most efficiently.32 Politi- cians, who suffer from the same rational propensity to act selfishly as other people, are therefore ill-suited to the role of conscientious watchdogs. A third ground on which privatization has been justified is the recognition that in certain sectors, governments no longer need to protect monopolies. Conventionally, it was thought that certain infrastructural sectors, such as en- ergy or telecommunications, because of scale economies, could provide services to the public more efficiently through a single, coordinated operator, controlled by a government accountable to electors, rather than through several private operators.33 The provision of such goods or services as electricity, heating fuel, water, postal services, or a telephone system were treated as giving rise to a natural monopoly. Advances in technology, the ability to raise vast sums of capital to cover sunk costs, and the arrival of multi-national firms, have created new opportunities for competitive entry.34 For example, Canada's national postal service (re-invented as Canada Post) is now just one among a host of car- riers and couriers.35 The "exclusive privilege" of transmitting and delivering let- ters, advertising, and packages has been attenuated.36 New telecommunication technologies, including telephone, telefax, and the Internet, provide alternative means for linking citizens in a universal system. When a public enterprise re- tains a monopoly, there are no incentives to be "businesslike" comparable to those motivating private firms to adopt efficient strategies.37 This consideration does not always point toward selling off the public enterprise as the only effec- 31. "Rent-seeking" has been defined as "the attempt to obtain economic rents (i.e., rates of return on the use of an economic asset in excess of the market rate) through governmental intervention in the market. An example of rent-seeking is a firm's attempt to secure government-granted monopolies." Jonathan R.

As the example of Canada Post shows, in the mid-1980s, when the federal government was considering ways to reform the post office, the politicians found it useful to commission a "private- sector review" panel, whose mandate was to study the postal corporation's productivity and woeful fi- nancial record. The focus was on the public corporation's "corporate rationale," rather than its public service functions or constraints. See id. at 239-46. 6 [Vol. 63: No. 4</page><page sequence="7">Page 1: Autumn 2000] tive form of privatization. In the case of Canada Post, the strategy instead has been to introduce an element of competition and to encourage the public firm to operate more efficiently as a quasi-private enterprise.38 To what degree does the rationale for privatization rest (at least in part) on emulating the policies enacted in other countries? Has membership in interna- tional organizations such as the International Monetary Fund ("IMF"), the Or- ganization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD"), the World Bank, or the World Trade Organization ("WTO"), as well as the last decade's phenomenal growth in trade liberalization-Canada's and Mexico's entry, for instance, into the North American Free Trade Agreement-fostered the crea- tion of a new "culture" of privatization and marketization? The IMF and the World Bank have been vocal supporters of privatization schemes among the least-developed countries receiving financial support from those organizations.39 There is a sharp difference of opinion as to whether those organizations operate merely by recommending privatization as a matter of policy advice or technical expertise, or by actually tying financial assistance to a promise to privatize.40 Some writers claim that these international lenders typically lay down the con- ditions regarding structural or sectoral adjustments that must be satisfied by the debtor country,41 conditions that encourage high levels of foreign investment. This image differs from the view that IMF or World Bank officials take of themselves. They have characterized their methods as engaging in "policy dia- logue"42 and working closely together with the country-through the provision of "technical assistance"-to help resolve balance of payments problems and public debt reduction.43 Privatization is simply presented as one option among many. Countries are not coerced into privatizing their national enterprises; 38. Since the adoption in 1986 of major reforms affecting Canada Post, the corporation's goals have been to raise its revenues, cut its costs (especially its labor costs), increase its productivity, and overall to make a profit each year. For this transition in Canada Post's mandate, see id. at 291-95. For a critical assessment of similar attempts with respect to the U.S. postal service, see Sharon M. Oster, The Failure of Postal Reform, in PRIVATIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES, supra note 1, at 109. 39. These lending organizations are naturally concerned about possible future defaults by countries that receive IMF or World Bank loans; to that extent, they have an interest in promoting sound eco- nomic policies. See generally Kim Reisman, The World Bank and the IMF: At the Forefront of World Transformation, 60 FORDHAM L. REV. 349 (1992). 40. The situation has been summed up in a recent IMF research paper, where the authors observe: "IMF conditionality has reinforced public enterprise reforms, including privatization, planned under the aegis of the World Bank, where these reforms are important to the objectives of the program."

FOREWORD 7</page><page sequence="8">LAW AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS they are instead persuaded that privatization is the wise thing to do.4 To assist countries in precarious economic circumstances to sell nationalized assets, the World Bank even maintains a website that advertises ripe opportunities of which overseas investors-sometimes called global bargain hunters-might take advantage.45 From the perspective of these organizations, privatization on a grand scale is not a condition for receiving financial assistance. But it is viewed as an important aspect of the overall push to "modernize" and stabilize recipi- ent countries' economies, to bring them into line with global trends. Much of the literature produced by World Bank or IMF researchers is exhortative. Pri- vate sector development is an undoubted success and "any privatization is bet- ter than none," even if certain cases (such as Russia's program of mass, speedy privatization) have encountered severe problems.46 The degree to which the least-developed or emerging countries have benefited from the implementation of privatization policies designed to stimulate growth and stability remains a matter of debate. Some critics claim that the lack of competitive markets and of sufficient private investors, coupled with the presence of entrenched oligopolies (which tend to siphon business opportunities to themselves) have undermined privatization programs in many countries.47 Research compiled for the World Bank itself has recognized that some countries are not ready for a substantial transfer of state-owned enterprises to the private sector, though this observa- tion does little to alleviate the pressure to privatize.4 Privatization affects the scope for politics, regulation, and public oversight. To what extent, then, does sustained privatization redefine the state? Moreo- ver, is the process of privatization strategically best executed without wide- spread political consultation? Should the government absorb the enterprise's debts in order to attract private owners? Are all public goods best delivered through market systems? Or are there limits to this? Though privatization was in part conceived as an antidote to excessive bureaucratization, can we now de- tect discontent with overweening corporate power that is insensitive to local conditions? To what extent has the privatization of certain services led to calls for the re-regulation of firms' behavior in the marketplace? 44. Even World Bank officials have acknowledged that on occasion, "well-intentioned outsiders, including the World Bank, have sometimes attempted to prod developing countries that are not ready for reform into acting."

The lessons to be derived are valuable, because the process of privatization contin- ues apace. In Canada, for example, two of the most noteworthy divestitures have involved, first, the "people's airline," Air Canada, and then the "people's railway," Canadian National Railway ("CN").49 Both enterprises were origi- nally established to serve the purpose of "nation-building."50 Since going pri- vate, the firms have faced several challenges, including the spectre of foreign ownership, stiff international competition, and the threat of "re-regulation," es- pecially on the occasions when it is debatable whether the firm is acting in the public interest.5 Governments in many countries appear interested in going further than just divesting themselves of inefficient transportation behemoths. Among the sectors often targeted have been public utilities, telecommunica- tions facilities and networks, airports, air traffic control systems, as well as other parts of the public infrastructure, such as highways52 and registry systems. Will social security schemes and public pension plans be next?3 The upshot of denationalization and deregulation is not only that govern- ment has shrunk-it has fewer assets and maintains less oversight-but also that the reach of administrative law has been shortened. Once a function has been moved to the private sector, public law remedies for lack of jurisdiction, abuse of administrative discretion, or lack of fair treatment by an overseeing body charged with protecting the public good no longer readily apply.54 Moreover, putting public assets into private hands reduces the scope for public account- ability and transparency.

FOREWORD 9</page><page sequence="10">LAW AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS holder meeting does not lend itself to any discussion of civic or political values. Indeed, in Canada federal business corporations law expressly restricts the abil- ity of shareholders to raise topics that involve "general economic, political... social or similar causes."55 As a leading U.S. commentator has noted-after studying several transitional economies in central Europe and the tribulations involved in setting up markets for corporate securities-one of the apparent les- sons from newly privatized enterprises is that shareholders there have "shown little interest in monitoring."56 Such trends illustrate the need perhaps for re- regulation, in the form of either legislative intervention or enhanced judicial powers, whereby judges faced with securities abuses can enjoy "greater discre- tion and can fashion novel remedies."57 A similar conclusion has been reached in the context of studying the effects of privatization on corporate governance in Australia.58 Why should a lawyer be interested in these processes and questions? First, lawyers are inevitably involved in the mechanics of privatization. When a gov- ernment asset is sold, whether to a single buyer or through a public offering of shares, or when a particular service or duty is "outsourced," at some stage law- yers bring their skills to bear as tacticians, negotiators, or drafters. Lawyers are among the important technicians working behind the scene. But more than this, lawyers are often the authors of principled arguments over whether the state ought to retreat from doing certain tasks. Because government operates according to various structures-legal and economic, as well as political-deci- sionmakers turn to legal advisors for opinions on whether a proposed action aligns with the framework of laws, including constitutional and international commitments, that bind the state. Finally, lawyers ought to be interested in the privatization phenomenon because it raises interesting questions about the in- evitability of government regulation-if not public ownership-of key engines of public policy. The generous support of Canadian National ("CN") is gratefully acknowl- edged. But for CN's sponsorship, the conference on privatization that brought 55. Canada Business Corporations Act, R.S.C., ch.

Whincop &amp; Stuart Rowland, "Plus Ca change...": The Effects of Markets and Corporate Law on the Governance of Privatised Enterprises, in WHO BENEFITS FROM PRIVATISATION? 58 (Moazzem Hossain &amp; Justin Malbon eds., 1998). At a positive level, it is possible to detect an increasing infiltration of the leitmotivs of public law into corporate law-an analysis of procedure, the treatment of ac- countability as an end rather than as a means, the increased use of non-substantive grounds of review, and the liberalisation and expansion of standing rights for share- holders ....

In particular, the conference reflected the interest shown by David G.A. McLean, chair of CN's board of directors. After its formation as a Crown cor- poration during the period from 1917 to 1923, CN played a vital role in popu- lating western Canada, by transporting new immigrants to homesteads on the prairies and by helping them adjust to the climate, the culture, and the business of farming.59 Canadian National and its privately owned counterpart, Canadian Pacific Railways, also provided the major mode for transporting wheat, cattle, minerals, and forest products to market.6 Despite its central role in the Cana- dian economy (at one time it was Canada's largest employer),6' CN was from its origins overbuilt-it was consolidated out of five separate railway companies- and plagued by financial troubles.62 After its privatization through an interna- tional flotation of its shares in November 1995-the largest initial public offer- ing in Canadian history-CN drastically reduced its debt, transformed itself into a profitable venture, and has emerged as a railway that binds not just Canada east and west, but the continent north and south.6 Since purchasing Illinois Central in July 1999, CN has re-branded itself as "North America's railroad."64 The conference received additional material support and encouragement from the Duke University School of Law, the Global Capital Markets Center and the Program in Public Law at Duke Law School, Duke's Office of the Vice- President (International Affairs), and the Faculty of Law at the University of Geneva.

The CN privatization was "remarkable in a number of respects," including the federal govern- ment's complete divestiture (it did not retain a "golden share"), no limit on foreign ownership, and a vast oversubscription for its shares.
