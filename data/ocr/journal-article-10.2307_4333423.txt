<plain_text><page sequence="1">Walter Elder THIS MAY BE THE BOOK FEELING AND FORM. By Susanne K. Langer. Scribner's. $7. F OR ONE THING this is a thoroughly satisfactory essay about Art and the arts. Even if it were no more than an essay it would be distinguished for its arguments and its literary merits. However, this book also purports to do for art, as non-discursive symbolism, what Mrs. Langer's earlier book, Philosophy in a New Key, did for science through her analysis of discursive symbolism. Despite her contention that she does not wish to coordinate art with any metaphysical perspectives or "world hypotheses," she does state that she wishes to provide an intellectual framework for philosophical studies of art. On the one hand, she has done more than she has promised. By providing this intellectual framework, she has grounded her essay on philosophy. On the other hand, by concentrating on the argumentation of her essay, she has been forced to subsume a great deal of epistemological and other philosophical ground- work which require more extensive investigation than anyone could reasonably demand in one volume. So we are faced with a philosophical essay about Art and the arts, an essay which would stand fragile and isolated were it not tied to some world view. But Mrs. Langer's own world view of the basic importance of symbolization to mentality, art, and language has been well-known for at least twelve years; this furnishes the major portion of the philosophical background. The essay takes as its key question, What does art create? By concentrating on the problem of artistic creation, she skirts the pitfalls of the theories which emphasize either the impression of art on the observer or the expression of something by the artist. The inquiry begins by focussing our attention on the object.</page><page sequence="2">WALTER ELDER 387 Mrs. Langer begins by generalizing from her theory that music, as it was outlined in her earlier book, is a tonal analogue of emotive life. This description is expanded to read: the musical work of art is a symbol, an articulated, sensuous object which can express the forms of vital experience. A generalization of this description is then set forth as a tentative definition of art. Art is the creation of forms symbolic of human feeling. To test this hypothesis-in her words, to see if it is fecund and capable of generalization-she analyses the "otherness" of art objects. She argues that the power of an image lies in the fact that it is an abstraction from actuality, a symbol, and hence capable of bearing ideas. She argues that in art we are confronted by abstractions, an illusion, a semblance, Schein. It is this removal from actuality and from objects which constitutes the illusory quality of art. When one concentrates closely on appearances alone, one has a sense of illusion; but one need not be deluded. The mind is freed from its practical considerations to see forms and what content they may contain. Even if this is an accurate argument on behalf of the formal character of art, we must still deal with the problem of content. The time-honored paradox is stated as follows: since the form is given directly to experience or perception, one expects the con- tent to be similarly given. But if the content of art is feeling, then how can the non-sensuous quality of feeling be presented as the sensuous quality of the imaginal content? The paradox suggests its own solution when Mrs. Langer insists that the perceptual form of an art object is an abstraction from actuality. She argues analogously that the content of art is an abstraction, too. Art objects convey the patterns of feeling, the forms of sentience. Even as the illusion in art forms represents a removal from actual objects of experience, so the conception of a pattern of feeling is an abstraction from the stream of feeling and from the singular items in the pure stream of feeling. One of her brilliant insights consists in her suggestion that</page><page sequence="3">388 SYMBOLIC since art objects are illusory and not actual, so art may convey ideas of feeling, not actual feelings. Emotions are therefore trans- muted. They acquire a reference, although not a logical reference. They become capable of more than singular or private valuation. Decoration is proposed as a test case for the view that art can be both abstract and expressive. She argues that if we assume a principle of artistic vision or experiential seeing, which is far different from the principle of geometrical space, then we may say that the static lines of decoration convey ideas of motion, rest, rhythmic unity, and even vitality. In a general sense, decoration, which is usually considered pretty but without import, conveys the idea of growth. It portrays images of organic form, a sem- blance of organic growth in which permanence is simply the pattern of change. According to her view of the plastic arts, fundamental shapes serve as the motifs for these arts. The purpose of plastic art is the articulation of visual form; it is not to copy actuality. The artist literally creates a virtual experiential space, and this creation rep. resents the primary illusion in the plastic arts. This virtual space has modes. In pictorial art, the illusion is that of a virtual scene; in sculpture, the image of volume in sensory space; in architecture, the illusion of an ethnic domain. For example, a temple, say, Stonehenge, circumscribes and creates a virtual religious space. The temple is the abstraction from the world of a non-geographical place, the spatial semblance of an organic, non-physical world. In sculpture, the image is of kinetic volume; and kinetic is a qualitative term related to vitality, per- haps to the teleological measure of the world, certainly not the mechanical. There is no Gesamtkunstwerk. Opera is to be judged by its primary illusion, not by its secondary effects. The words become operatic; the music is operatic; all the attached illusions must be taken as operatic. But the possibility of an identity of the prin- ciples underlying the arts, a fundamental unity which does not</page><page sequence="4">WALTER ELDER 389 blur the differences between the specific arts, leads Mrs. Langer to propose another fecund generalization. She argues that since art is abstractive, it may be related closely to intellectuality. It may even have a logic of its own. Since art conveys images of felt life, we may be sure that this logic will not be discursive. To exemplify this assertion-one could hardly demand a proof-she turns to music, about which she is most learned. Music she defines as the sonorous image of passage, abstracted from actuality so as to become free, plastic, and perceptible. It deals wholly with time, a virtual, vital, experiential time which re- minds one of Bergson's pure duration. We can speak of the volume of this time as when we speak of a big time. It is music which is generally labelled as the most formal or the most sentient of the arts. Can it be an association of both qualities? Mrs. Langer contends that form is fundamental, and that the original conception or Idea (after Flaubert and perhaps Kant) is the commanding form in the musical matrix. But music does not remain in the composer's head. The musical imagination is both sonorous and conceptual, and the aim of the musician is the articulation of his Idea through utterance, whether by voice or by instrument. In other words, the work must be played. The ear is necessary to complete the work of composition, and it is through hearing that music conveys its vital import; the artist's Idea is expressed through sounding forms in motion. Singing is an excellent example of the necessary concomit- ance of technique and passion in a performance. The quality of Lebensndhe affirms the close association of the human voice with feeling, but the singer is not making noises which are an alphabet of his or the composer's passions. There is also a realm of virtual powers which is created in the dance; and here again we meet the assumption, or the meta- phor, of a natural conception of the world which is neither me- chanical nor anthropomorphic. Through gestures, we get the illusions of influence and agencies at work. There is a semblance</page><page sequence="5">390 SYMBOLIC of mysterious volitions. These are the conceptions appropriate to a mythic consciousness. Poetry conveys one of the grandest illusions, the illusion of life, an appearance of experiences, a semblance of special events. The poet creates in accordance with his conviction that these virtual events are qualitative in nature. The poet creates by mak- ing a basic abstraction in the imaginative mode, an abstraction by which events are conceived as mixtures of feeling and action or sense and morality. Everything actual is transformed by the imagination into something experiential. Everything in a poem, including literal statements or preachments, must be poetic. Hence it is that in poems we find an almost exclusive concentra- tion on the exhibitable (darstellbar) and the qualitative, the direct datum and its value, as it were. Poetry, like music, runs constantly between the Scylla of Idea and the Charybdis of Emo- tion. It need not wreck. Mrs. Langer argues that the primary illusion of poesis is that of experienced history in the mode of a virtual past. A poem presents an image of life which we never actually encounter, an image of completeness and finality. Through memory, the great organizer of consciousness, the past is made fixed and definite whereas the present is always unfinished and unfashioned. The power of her account of poesis lies in the fact that it prevents us from mistaking conventions and devices for the sub- stance of poetry or literature. She avoids the errors of exclusion which bother all definitions of pure poetry. She defines limits for literature without trying to arbitrate its fashions. Literature runs its gauntlet, too. It seeks to give the impression of livingness, an air of reality. At the same time it has a harder job, namely, to keep its fiction fictional. If literature is, in accordance with Mrs. Lan- ger's description, concerned with the illusion of life, then the category can include the lyric poem, the epic, the ballad, the novel, and even the essay. Drama is poetry in the mode of action. As literature is in</page><page sequence="6">WALTER ELDER 391 the mnemonic mode, so drama is in the futuristic mode, or the mode of destiny as opposed to the mode of virtual history. Destiny is nothing actual; it is a virtual phenomenon. But drama, accord- ing to Mrs. Langer, is a semblance of action containing an in- divisible piece of history whose completion is implicitly under- stood long before the presentation itself is completed. She distinguishes the comic and tragic rhythms in drama. The rhythm of human existence is the maintenance of vital bal- ance amid alien chance and passional (personal) desires. The in- eluctable future is Fortune. Comedy, whether serious or humor- ous, presents the image of human vitality holding its own in a world of surprises. Comedy is contingent, episodic, and ethnic. Tragedy, on the other hand, presents the image of Fate which is also only virtual. Tragedy is the big unfolding of feeling in the organic, personal pattern of a human life, rising, growing, accomplishing destiny and doom. Tragedy is a fulfillment. It is closed, final, and passional. These, then, are the highlights of the essay wrenched from their context. It is a sensible and profound essay, and if one has the feeling that he has seen it all before, tell me where and if it were all together and with such grace. I should like best simply to point to it and tantalize a bit by quoting more, but critical and philosophical questions arise. Apparently they must have answers. If she is correct, how could the Augean stables of aesthetic theorizing and criticizing have become so befouled? We get dis- tracted. Ideally, each work of art, as an image of a complex of emotional tensions and resolutions, ought to express a single feeling and express it unambiguously. One work, one message. Should it be a single message since the understanding of art begins, at least, in the intuition of a whole presented feeling? Since artistic import can be only exhibited and not demonstrated, dare we speak of taste or failures or successes? How can one judge art? If by criticism of techniques alone, is not the stable sterile as well as bare? Finally, what are the qualifications for</page><page sequence="7">392 SYMBOLIC understanding art? Now these questions occur naturally in the course of theori- zing about art. They occur to Mrs. Langer, and she sees that they require more than rhetorical answers. They call for hard philosophical thinking, but not for scientific demonstrations. Even if one grants the power of her essay and the accomplish- ment of her purpose to find principles which are fecund and capable of generalization, there is the unescapable feeling that her essay should be grounded in something. She has made broad use of the argument by analogy in showing the fruitfulness of the teleological (mythical) conception of the world; she recog- nizes that the mode or semblance of a purposive life is not the only mode, but she contends that it is a genuine one. She relies heavily on unexpanded views of the nature of imagination, and she raises thereby some epistemological puzzles. Ultimately, we have to face the plausibility of the suggestion that there can be a logic of non-discursive symbolism. If these questions can be dealt with philosophically and suc- cessfully, then we may have a unique book on our hands. It may very well be that here is an essay about art grounded on philos- ophical thinking-an essay whose argument will, by way of suit- ing aestheticians who practice and profess as well as contemporary philosophers who prune and probe-which will establish a com- munity of interests between criticism and philosophy, and estab- lish it on better terms than almost any other inclusive or exclusive account of Art and the arts. Mrs. Langer herself believes that the purely literary studies of poetic diction by Mr. Owen Barfield are consistent with the conclusions reached by Mr. Ernst Cassirer in his philosophical analysis of symbolic forms. Consider her philosophical treatment of the philosophical paradox from which her book takes its title. She states the prob- lem of significant form as a problem in the presentation of feeling to perception. Suppose that feeling and form are not really polar terms. Suppose that feelings are not expressed directly, and forms</page><page sequence="8">WALTER ELDER 393 are not perceived purely, but that both are mediated through an intellectual process, whether it be called knowledge, perception, intuition, conception, or symbolization. An answer along this line of inquiry would surely furnish a new key to the problem of objectified feelings or the puzzles of artistic creation, expression, and impression. Unless such a solution is forthcoming, we may be thrown back on either the "experience" schools of aesthetics, such as psychological behaviorism or pragmatism, or the "intellectual" theories of art, whose logic pretends to be discursive and whose judgments may be moral or otherwise irrelevant. In any case, Mrs. Langer argues that the expression of ideas may be through a symbolic function, not a signific function. Music, for instance, cannot be a language of feeling because it lacks definitively associative symbols within a conventional frame of reference. But were music commanded by its forms, and were its contents not pure feeling, but vital import, then we might indeed argue that music has significant form. The argument takes two directions. First, can images serve as expressive symbols? Second, can the content of art be removed from the stream of feeling in such a way that it acquires import? First, she contends that in our perceptions of actuality we relate images not only to each other but to an object. If images were related simply to other images, then we could have a non- practical realm in which images are capable of bearing a special species of ideas, the ideas which are closely associated with emo- tions. In this realm the image is free to serve as a special sort of symbol. All art-as does all conception or knowledge-depends on an abstraction from material experiences. Generally we carry this abstraction to the point of making definitive symbols. In art the image is simply freed from this demand. At this free-floating level of thought-referred to with mixed motives as primitive-we are prone to the mythic conception of life. We are, in other words, liable to the hypostatic tendency in</page><page sequence="9">394 SYMBOLIC thought, the tendency to fix by naming, a process often guided by emotional excitements and attachments. This tendency is con- trasted with the abstractive tendency which seeks to define rela- tions. These trends are not incompatible, but they receive different emphases. Herein, says Mrs. Langer, lies the basic distinction be- tween discursive and non-discursive thinking. The one tends to split meanings into distinct concepts; the other strives to retain an organic, vital unity. Next, she contends that all art partakes of the character of organisms. Poetic events, for example, are conceived in the imaginative or mythic mode where events and emotions are in- extricably mixed. Such a conception is analogous to the concep- tion of life as dynamic-not static, but progressive, with processes which have phases, complexities, depth, and other apparent di- mensions. It is not absurd to attach import to this conception if we remember that we are not dealing with actual, practical life nor with pure, unmodulated feelings. In a dance, the gestures and the dancers are actual; the symbols and the expressions are only virtual and convey imagined feelings, not actual emotions. This fundamental relationship between the static symbols created in art and the morphology of feeling is perhaps best illus- trated by Mrs. Langer's account of music. In the creation of the virtual time in music, there is a complete determination of the original motif through the movements of the audible forms. Music seems to follow a principle of rhythmic unity which is analogous to the basic unity of organism, that unity which alone gives permanence and import to living bodies. Living bodies, moreover, are alone in their capability for a life of feeling which is beyond simply feeling. Thinking beings alone seem to be able to attach import, through symbolization, to this life. These statements are not proofs or demonstrations. But even if they are only fecund metaphors, they show the way to her basic conviction that mentality is essential to art, and that it is thus plausible to speak of a logic of non-discursive symbolism.</page><page sequence="10">WALTER ELDER 395 Mrs. Langer avers that her theory of art raises questions which go straight to the heart of psychology and anthropology, and she promises to set off on her explorations shortly. She goes, I think, well-armed, and with a clear agenda of queries to put in these quarters. She will, I trust, retain that attitude of philo- sophical reasoning which has brought her safely from the bases of her investigations through the perils of discursive symbolism and well into command of non-discursive symbolism. The questions to which she proposes to seek deeper answers concern the very nature of the process of artistic abstraction and the unity of all the arts. The direction of the answers will be dictated by the course of her questioning, and she may well go to learn and finish by teaching. For of what value is psychology unless it become or be forced to become philosophical? Here, as in her earlier book, she does not pretend to have discovered any new keys by herself, but she has set the right ques- tions forth in a fruitful way which has not been approached since, say, I790. Ultimately, the cogency, if not the persuasiveness, of her theory rests on our ability to take the teleological metaphor as useful and as related to the mental transmutations through which we live, and think, and feel, and act. It is through the intricate and intellectual processes of thought and imagination that we are able to have a life of feeling and to make sense out of the apparently endless stream of tensions and resolutions. This same kind of transmuting process enables us to know the world in which we live. Although we are caught in the constant shifting of our intellectual and emotional attentions, we strive for and sometimes achieve a pattern which may ap- proach a unity. In art this life of feeling is shown in a timeless projection which creates its elements in the illusory mode of ten- sions and resolutions. It creates a semblance of functional unity, using "natural" materials, and its creations connote the tensions of experience. To take the opposite perspective of an art object, we perceive</page><page sequence="11">396 SYMBOLIC art through the basically intellectual act of intuition. What we perceive is already fashioned by the act of perceiving. (Hence the correctness of the ambiguous term, perception.) The apprehen- sion of forms in perceiving is a spontaneous act of abstraction. So is the recognition of metaphorical value. We can no more deny either product of this activity than we can deny the world or the values which we hang on things. Both activities are intuitive (and hence intellectual in Mrs. Langer's sense of the term), and they are considered by her to be basic to mentality, art, and language. Responsiveness, she says, is the single qualification for under- standing art. The immediate impact of the whole is the psycho- logical lure to long contemplation. The transmutations of the artistic imagination clear our minds for the revelation of our most intimate reality, the inner life of feeling. Art shapes our imagination of external actuality in accordance with the rhythmic forms of life and sentience. There is a strong feeling that one has almost to take Mrs. Langer's book whole or reject all of it. Her appreciation of art would be hollow if it were no more than metaphorical. On the other hand, if she were indulging in the favorite contemporary pastime of philosophizing about philosophy, this, too, would be empty. We should be back again to the view that criticism is criticism and philosophy is philosophy, and better that the two should avoid each other. Mr. A. J. Ayer may be one of the few people left holding this bag, but Mrs. Langer is the only person for some time to come forth with a sensitive and analytical account of what has in the meantime often been mislabelled as philosophy of art. Finally, this book demonstrates some of the limitations of aesthetic theories. Artistic import can be exhibited, but not demon- strated, and no philosopher can make anyone see what he cannot or will not. A philosophy of art does not obviate the need for good creation, good responsiveness, or good criticism; but too</page><page sequence="12">WALTER ELDER 397 many philosophers and critics cannot resist the temptation to make arbitrary standards. It is as an ultimate compliment to Mrs. Langer that I note her caution about tying art to any meta- physical structures. Art can, for instance, be very close to religion; it can also be very far from religion. For this reason and for many others I commend this book on all sides and to all sides as an excellent chance to get the ques- tions about art set straight. Any axe-grinder will furnish some final answers right away; not Mrs. Langer nor anyone who reads her correctly.</page></plain_text>
