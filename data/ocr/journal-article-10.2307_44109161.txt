When Dr. Millikan, the noted scientist, reported the results of his study and correspondence with other noted scientists and with religionists on the question of "Evolution," it included the following statement : "The truth is, there is no essential difference of opinion between the modern scientist and the modern theologian. Conflict lies only between the extremists in both camps." Dr. Kel- logg expressed his view of the question thus : It is not more proof that is necessary. What is needed is more explanation of what the acceptance of evolution as a proved fact im- plies - and does not imply in connection with our understanding of Nature, of the Universe, of God and Religion. We do all want to know what an acceptance of evolution means for us/1) 1 Kellogg, V. L., Evolution and Its Implications , p. 34, Amer.

Finally, it supplanted irrationality with ra- tionality; and to accept it, no man needed to give up any part of his religious beliefs because it did not interfere with true religion, but it did discredit some of the theological dogmas that have grown up with religion.1 The real conflict was found to be between science and theology, which fact was accepted by many outstanding lead- ers in the Protestant, Catholic and Jewish churches.2 Henry Drummond made the following statement, "Natural laws originate nothing, sustain nothing; they are merely respon- sible for uniformity in sustaining what has been originated and what is being sustained."3 Spencer called evolution, "The contin- uous adjustment of internal relations to external relations."4 He believed that one could not accept science in part, but only as a whole. He said that, "Science is simply a higher development of common knowledge ; and that if science is repudiated, all knowledge must be repudiated."5 He further pointed out that the criticism against science has been spread over a period of two thousand years and has been ad- vanced by the severest critics. Nevertheless, it has stood the rigid examination and has been accepted by the clearest thinkers, and by its gains has become established in the field of education. While many of the theological doctrines have passed into oblivion with the times to which they belonged, science became a mass of puri- fied facts.6 As for evolution, he said, "All things are growing or decaying, accumulating matter or wearing it away, integrating or disintegrating."7 That was what he called evolution. The Church of England gave three views of the creation upon which it based opinions concerning the theory of evolution. The last one referred to it more than the others. They said : Origin's view that Creation is an eternal process was generally re- jected in the ancient church, but this view in a different form is now 1 Kellogg, V.

Christianity is not especially com- mitted to any of these views.8 They also believed that any view that held to a creation with- out God was not Christian.9 It pointed out that the Christian doc- trine of Creation was stated in such a manner that it gave a wide scope for various theories of the evolution of the world. It held that the narratives in Genesis I and II were mythological in origin, according to many educated Christians, and the chief value of these stories was symbolic rather than historical. That threw the sub- ject open to the discretion of the individual, which seems to be the attitude of the protestant denominations at the present time.10 An interview with other Protestant leaders of both the north and south showed them to be in common agreement with Drum- mond, Spencer and the Church of England in their attitude toward the theory of evolution; that there was no difference in the realm of truth and religion and since the Protestant Church has not tak- en any definite stand for or against the question of evolution, min- isters should avoid discussing it unless they have a thorough knowl- edge of biological science. It is obvious that William Jennings Bryan did not represent the churches of America in his attitude toward this question. The Jewish faith. The Jewish religion took a definite affirm- ative stand toward that subject. Again an interview with out- standing Rabbis showed that to the Jew there was no problem con- cerning evolution; it solved itself readily. He believed that the Bible did not reach down from God to man, but was man's aid for reaching up to God, it was the step of man's evolution spiritually. The Jew has not accepted the Bible as a finished product, but only as the beginning of the whole Talmud. He found that Orthodoxy pre-dated evolution, but it did not necessarily oppose it. The whole of the Talmudic extent of the Biblical text would enable an Ortho- dox Rabbi, if he so desired, to find some support for evolution in the Bible. Basically, since Judaism never emphasized the down- ward development of man from perfection to imperfection, there- fore, it has no theological doctrine directly opposed to evolution. Doctor Hirsch believed that evolution did not preclude crea- tion, but implied it. He said : 8 The Doctrine in the Church of England, p. 45, New York, Macmillan Com- pany (1922). » Ibid. w Ihid.</page><page sequence="4">206 PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE Natural selection in strict construction is teleological. Mechanical design alone is precluded. In its stead the hypothesis of evolution op- erates with a teleology that is both in intensity and extent, much more adequate to, the higher conceptions of God. Mechanical teleology is anthropomorphic. Jewish theism, not being anthropomorphic, does not defend mechanical teleology.1 He believed that while it was obvious that the Jewish faith ac- cepted the theory of evolution, there was still a restriction placed upon that phase of the theory which dealt with "Mechanism." Since that was true, the opposite phase of "Vitalism" was evidently ac- cepted. To believe in evolution, according to Hirsch, did not neces- sarily destroy their faith in other works of God. He said, "Belief in miracles and in catastrophical interpretations of the continuity of nature's processes, indeed, is not compatible with the acceptance of the doctrine of evolution."2 Finally, he believed that all religious growth was not to be considered a fixed quantity ; therefore, it must be involved in a form of evolution. The Catholic faith . The opinion of the Catholic church re- garding evolution as a process of development was stated concisely in the work by Michael Depta. His concluding remark, after anal- yzing eighty-three of the most outstanding books covering that subject was: The church is the Divine Teacher and the sole Interpreter of Tra- dition and Scripture. The ecclesiastical authority has thus far ab- stained from a decisive opinion regarding the evolution of the body of man. The question is still an open one. However, the Roman Cath- olic church may some day make a decision, hence it is advisable for a Roman Catholic to suspend and avoid an unqualified assent to the evo- lutionary theory of the body of man. This does not mean that one may not regard it as a possible view, nor hold individual opinions, sub- ject to the judgment of the Church; nor does it forbid research work leading toward a supposed conclusion of the evolution of the body of man.1 Concluding statement. Thus it may be justly concluded that there were no legal or religious charges against the facts of evolu- tion as an established scientific method of development. Therefore, those who opposed the teaching thereof in the public schools did so because either of a lack of a thorough understanding of the pro- 1 Hirsch, Jewish Encyclopedia , p. 281. 2 Ibid. 1 Depta, Michael, The Origin of Man and- Roman Catholic Thought, p. 69, Uni- versity of Pittsburgh (1937).</page><page sequence="5">PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE 207 cess or their biased opinions toward scientific advancement. Those opinions had been instilled within them by their emotions and tra- ditions generations old. Therefore, many of them were not willing to set them aside to take on something new.</page></plain_text>
