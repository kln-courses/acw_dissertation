<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kenjo Jumbam. The White Man of God. London: Heinemann Educational Books, 1980. 151 pp. $4.50, paperback. In The White Man of God the perfectability of man is taught to people living in early twentieth-century rural Cameroun by a Catholic missionary dangerously overloaded with imperfection. The confusion, pain, and social disorientation which result form the subject matter of the book. In charmingly told tales and episodes which bear an autobiographical flavor, society enacts the drama of religious colonization. The book opens with a scene in which the child narrator, Tansa, talks alone to Sunday morning chatechism class asking himself, "Do squirrels have their own church ... Do animals have the same hell or heaven as men? That would be terrible, hell, with the wailing of every creature, a man crying, a woman crying, a child crying, a lion roaring, a cow mooing ... all that noise in one hot, burning hole" (pp. 7-8). This childishly anthropomorphic hell exists as a counterpoint metaphor to daily life. Coming to terms with the White Man's hell provides the main dynamic of the book. Established customs and practices are constantly measured against the new yardstick of perfection. Chapter Two ends with Tansa imploring God not to put his grandmother, Yaya, in that burning, noisy hole as a punishment for refusing to accept the imported religion. Yaya is a single-handed Greek chorus, a social authority figure challenging and questioning the invading Catholicism. She does not oppose directly but rather probes as a prosecutor the events she witnesses. She continuously enters into dialogue with her daughter and son-in-law regarding their religion and child-rearing practices. It is the White Man's hell which she cannot accept."[I]f a man said that God can punish someone forever and ever wihout pity, then that man is not the son of God for he is certainly telling a lie. God can punish a man for an evil action but certainly not for eternity" (p. 38). An assistant priest arrives, Father Cosmas, creating a foil to "Big Fadda." Father "Cosima" is light with laughter and joy, where Big Fadda is dark and morose, distanced and harsh. Father Cosima is accessible where Big Fadda is ascetic. Father Cosima learns to speak to his people in their language; he instigates Sunday afternoon co-educational soccer games; he visits every parishioner's home. Big Fadda never once sets foot inside one of his parishioners' houses. The power struggle which ensues between the two priests is dealt with obliquely, off stage, its resolution, tragic. The tragedy between the two priest is seconded by the life and death of Yaya. Yaya is the voice of inquiry and resistance throughout the book. As the children grow up and leave home for mission schools in larger towns, as the community 97</page><page sequence="2">98 AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW/REVIEW OF BOOKS falls more deeply under the sway of Catholicism, Yaya begins to falter. She falls ill and her world begins to collapse. Lying between life and death she straddles an ever-widening chasm between her old benefits and the new ones. In a death bed scene of extreme pathos she must decide whether to become a Christian or not. In order to be baptized she must take a Christian name. "'No,' she whispered and managed, just managed to say, 'if you rename me Ndze [my deceased husband] won't recognize me'" (p. 119). Yaya's death is a release. For the other citizens dwelling in Nso the struggle continues. Mary Dalton Howard Rutgers University, Newark</page></plain_text>
