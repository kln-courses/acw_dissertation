<plain_text><page sequence="1">Die Religion der Griechen. Von OTTO KERN. Erster Band: von den Anfangen bis Hesiod. Berlin, Weidmann, 1926. Pp. viii +-308. 11 marks (paper), 15 marks (cloth). There is room for a work on Greek religion larger than the sketches by Farnell, Nilsson and others, yet smaller than the largest works on the subject and not too technical to be used by the non-specialist. The author has undertaken to supply this want, and the present volume, the first of three, gives a large enough sample of his performance for us to form some opinion of the value of the whole. The learning of Dr. Kern has been sufficiently demonstrated by his Orphicorum fragmenta and his numerous excellent shorter works. His methods he himself indicates in a short preface, as follows; 'ich hoffe doch, dass sie (the account given in this work of Greek religion) eins zeigt, dass Ernst Curtius und Hermann Diels, Carl Robert und Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff meine Lehrer waren.' A goodly company of teachers, certainly, and a not unworthy pupil; but it would have done the book no harm if Kern had paid a little more attention to views put forth since the death of some of these scholars, and in countries other than Germany. Very rightly, he begins with a sketch of the religious life, not simply of prehistoric Greece, but of the whole Aegean basin. As a characteristic of its earliest form he finds what he calls fetichism, a word which he uses in the loose way popular with many writers in Germany and out of it, to signify little more definite than non-anthropomorphic cult. It is a pity that he does not use some more accurate term, for it is confusing to be told, for example, that the worship of Artemis Brauronia has behind it the cult of a ' Barenfetisch,' meaning presumably not a magical image shaped like a bear, but the beast itself, whether as an individual or as a species. It is at least reassuring to find that he does not discover totems in these worshipped creatures. Anthropomorphism, he believes, began when the inhabitants of Greece came to conceive their gods as of partly human form, or when they paid worship to objects not indeed representing the human-shaped god himself, but be- longing intimately to him, as his throne or his sceptre. The first anthropomorphic art- types are of course Minoan. Chthonian gods were the first to become prominent, arising as they do from the primaeval worship of Mother Earth. Sky-gods, even Zeus, are later, and war-gods belong to the chthonians. They personify the fear of death and annihila- tion. The development of such ideas, and the clash of invaders and invaded, naturally led to compromises, of which the best known is that pairing of god and goddess found in the widespread [Eph y',oao, which generally unites a chthonian to an Olympian god. In the local forms of religion, a great part was played by the topography of the various dis- tricts, mountaineers, for example, conceiving of a deity who lived in their mountain, those who lived near the changeful sea, of a god who could change his shape as he chose, and</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS 137 so forth. Many of these local figures live on in the guise of heroes; but it does not always follow that because a particular deity never was given any very splendid cult, his or her influence was not widely and deeply felt. Artemis, for example (p. 104), was intensely reverenced, yet her public cult is not especially imposing. When the Achaian invasion came down from the north, bringing with it the sort of religion familiar from Homer, it reacted in various ways upon the existing cults. To a certain extent it oppressed them, driving some forms of worship into secrecy, and thus accounting for many mystery-cults. Elsewhere the two combined; thus the new-comer Zeus absorbed the ancient mountain-spirit of Olympos, but compromised with the ancient and powerful goddess Athena, who from henceforth was reckoned as his daughter. But through many such compromises and modifications, the ancient religion of the land is still clearly to be seen, for example, in hieratic names and formulae inexplicable from Greek speech. In the case of many deities it is possible to see where and even approximately when they forced their way into the chosen circle of the conquering and proselytising religion of the Zeus-worshippers. In this mixed new religion there grew and developed the typically Greek E;&amp;o-Ef/Ea, which after the very earliest times contained in it a consider- able element that was not mere formalism. Such is roughly Dr. Kern's idea of the religious history of Greece up to the time of Hesiod. It is clear that he possesses insight and sympathy as well as good acquaintance with the facts. It is also clear that few, if any, will agree with every detail of his exposition. The reviewer finds something to criticise adversely as unsound or shallow, much to question. For example, the author supposes (for instance, p. 202) that the new, composite religion was the result of deliberate missionary effort on a carefully thought out basis. The Thessalian barons to whom he attributes its inception, ' haben nach ganz bestimmten Grundsatzen gewahlt und verworfen . . sie haben . . . eine Aristokratie der hellen- ischen G6tterwelt schaffen wollen.' It seems not impossible; but to prove it will need much more evidence than Dr. Kern has seen fit to put forth in this book, at all events. To take a less important point, he is rather too much given to the pleasant game of finding faded gods everywhere; and some of his dicta, as that phallic worship presupposes anthropo- morphism, are rather startling. Worse than doubtful are such statements as (p. 30) that human sacrifice is certainly very old; can the author produce examples of it from really primitive, or anything like primitive, cult? In the same context, the alleged human sacrifice to Zeus Lykaios is far from certain for historical times, since our best and earliest authority, Plato, mentions it only as a rumour, and the most circumstantial accounts are much later. On the next page, to call the death of Polyxena a sacrifice and class it with that of Iphigeneia is playing with words. On p. 41, if the statement that Pindar calls Pelops a son of Kronos rests, as it appears to do, on 01. iii, 23, the author has misconstrued that passage, or at least adopted a highly doubtful rendering. Also, I should be inclined to place his free use of and dependence for proof upon etymologies under the head of mistakes, since so few are certain, and some hardly appear reasonably probable. Nevertheless, we have here a treatise to be reckoned with, and one full of good and ingenious suggestions. We may look forward with interest to the forthcoming volumes, especially perhaps to the next, which presumably will include the rise and progress of Orphism and the obscure religious history of the seventh and sixth centuries, in which the author, if I have not misunderstood some rather obscure remarks on p. 134, sees a survival or recrudescence of prehistoric religious developments in an ethical direction.
