<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pantheism, Poetry and Politics. By A. R. CHISHOLM.* Under the attacks made upon it by Voltaire and others in the eighteenth century, orthodox Christianity began to give way in intel lectual circles. Yet few of the outstanding writers who thus deserted the faith could be called atheists. Many of them even dabbled in occultism, and it is astonishing to find how many strong minded people took Cagliostro, Saint-Martin and the other high priests of hocus-pocus seriously; in this respect Viaitte's Sources occultes du Romantistne makes interesting reading and would, in fact, be enthralling if only the writer had been able to combine his own erudition with that verve and vividness that Dumas put into his Joseph Balsatno, where he goes over part of the same ground. Though they were not Christians, most of the writers in question were deists, who saw "God" in the phenomena of the universe (Voltaire), or in nature (Rousseau, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre), or in man's moral structure (Kant), or in the very existence of one's own mind (Fichte). The fact is that in countries which had been moulded on a Christian basis throughout a long cycle of centuries, atheism was practically impossible. The idea of divinity is not so easy to destroy as one might think, and for my own part I have never met a consistent atheist. The most common type of atheism is that aggressive variety which has a standing quarrel with God for continuing to let people believe that He exists. . . . Now deism is closely related to pantheism, and pantheism is the belief that takes the place of Christianity among dissident European intellec tuals from Romanticism onwards. It can, however, assume many forms, none of them being mutually exclusive, and it is largely this diversity that explains the varying avatars of European poetry and politics in the nineteenth century and in our own time. I do not mean that the individual thinker is necessarily a pantheist, and indeed we are not concerned here with "pure" thought so much as with applied thought; we are dealing with the history of applied ideas rather than with the history of philosophy, which would be somewhat out of place in the Quarterly and is in any case beyond Associate-Professor and Head of the Department of French in the University of Melbourne. 92</page><page sequence="2">PANTHEISM, POETRY AND POLITICS my competence. I mean, therefore, that those who have most distinguished themselves during the past century or so in applying ideas to definite purposes?men of action and artistic creators? have constructed for the most part on a background of pantheism. I. The simplest or at any rate the most downright form of modern pantheism is Materialism, which postulates matter as exist ing eternally and as engendering all forms of existence. I call this pantheism, first because the materialist assumes a gradual ascension of forms (inanimate bodies, plants, animals, man) and thereby, consciously or otherwise, presupposes a primal source which is self sufficing and all-sufficing, and which has come about by a sheer miracle, as well as a principle of development that determines matter itself; and secondly, because, even though he identifies this determinative principle with matter, he is thus putting a spirit into matter and simply overcoming his intellectual difficulties by iden tifying matter and God. God-Matter creates itself, and is eternal. And the various doctrines analogous to materialism all come back to the same sort of identification. Lamarckism assumes a number of simple animal types from which the great diversity of species has descended, and thereby implies (1) the existence of "miracu lous" archetypes, and (2) a principle of development applied to these archetypes. A similar remark applies to evolutionism. French positivism, which I suppose may be considered the "official" doctrine of France (with certain interruptions) for the last hundred years, is a strongly humanised form of materialism, this humanistic element coming partly from the long tradition of French culture, and partly from the mystic temperament of Auguste Comte, the father of positivism. For Comte was so strongly humanistic that he pro posed to extend to the whole solar system a kind of fraternal soli darity (a fact which is overlooked by most British positivists), and his innate mysticism led him to found a Religion of Humanity (as the positivists admit with some regret), in which it is easy to recognise resemblances with certain parts of Christian mythology. His system is really, therefore, in its ultimate form, a peculiar species of pantheistic anthropomorphism. There is little need for us to follow up the political and social corollaries of these materialistic forms of pantheism. We are only too familiar with dialectical materialism and its evolution. It is interesting, however, to point out that French socialism, as 93</page><page sequence="3">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY Maurice Barres remarked long ago (notably in his Ennemi des Lois), is more humanistic than other continental varieties of col lectivism. This is largely because Comte and Proudhon were both humanists. . . . And it is perhaps both necessary and useful to point out to Australian readers that materialism, and more par ticularly positivism, has been a source of poetic inspiration. The great Comte himself had a poetic imagination, as his very terminology indicates (the Earth-Mother, the Great-Being, the Great-Fetish, etc.), and some of his followers have mar!e real poetry out of his tenets; one of the most outstanding is Charles de Pomairols, as Charles Maurras remarks, illustrating his remark by an apt quotation, in his essay on Comte in the Avenir de VIntelligence. M. Maurras has a somewhat surprising admiration for Comte; but this surprise is largely a result of our own inadequate knowledge of positivist philosophy^. Pomairols, with his pure Cybele-worship, is a much greater poet, in my opinion, than the better-known Sully-Prudhomme, who found in positivism only an inspiration to sing of science and its instruments, and who has left us, among other things, a poem on the Barometer! But neither of them is as great a poet as Emile Zola, though the latter wrote in prose. Zola, in his vast series of novels, made such an immense poem out of matter, nature and determinism, that he unwittingly spiritualised them and ended up on a mystic note (in his Evangiles) that has practically nothing in common with pure materialism. That is probably always the fate of materialism; it begins with a denial of metaphysics and ends in the mystic cult of Cybele. Russian communism seems to be in the middle stage at present: its greatest poetic effort is the construction of gigantic buildings. How long will it be before these are poeticised into temples of the Mother Earth out of which they have sprung? And is not the much worshipped machine a special transformation of the eternal metals? This machine cult has not far to go in order to become a special, highly poetic variety of transformism, the principle of transforma tion here being Man himself, who thus becomes a God, with the Engineer as his high-priest. It was interesting in this respect to notice how very priestly, sanctimonious even, was the engineer who came to the rescue of struggling, snarling humanity in Mr. H. G. Wells' recent film, Things to Come. 94</page><page sequence="4">PANTHEISM, POETRY AND POLITICS II. I have said that none of the modern systems of pantheism are mutually exclusive; and so the materialistic variety is not without its points of contact with another form of pantheism which, though characteristically German (even Goethe subscribed to it more or less), has left its mark on France and other countries also. It is what we might call Pattern-Pantheism, and it has found its fullest expression in Oswald Spengler's Decline of the West (see my article in this Quarterly, September, 1935). God, or the source of being, is a centre of radiation from which the various phenomena consti tuting man and the universe move out in a series of rhythms, some what like the circles made by a stone cast into the water: only in this case stone, water and circles are all one. Schopenhauer's doctrines were a special form of the same creed, the main difference being in the imagery by which he expressed his thought, and which was largly influenced by Hindoo imagery and speculation (the Upanishads, etc.). We find the same idea in Swinburne's Garden of Proserpine and in his Hertha, with its opening image ("Out of me the years roll"), suggesting a centre of radiation, and its eternal cosmic pulsation: "Man, pulse of my centre, and fruit of my body, and seed of my soul." Such a rhythmic pulsation is essentially musical, and this pattern type of pantheism is in fact a musical creed. Spengler feels this so fully that he interprets all modern European culture as a Faus tian or musical one: for him, even modern mathematics are "musical." He would have been right if he had confined his in terpretation to German culture; and even as it is, he is not alto gether wrong, for both France and England have been strongly influenced by this musical pantheism, thanks to its great artistic medium, Romanticism. Now music belongs to the domain of time, and more particu larly to the sphere of memory. We hear only the beginning or end of a chord or passage at any given moment (for time is a series of moments between two points); the rest is already a memory, or else it is (when we know the piece) an anticipation, whereas plastic art, which we can examine continuously, is a reality more or less independent of time. Poetry is normally an art of reality also, for we can always go back over a stanza, a thing that is impossible when we are listening to music. ... So then, romantic poetry and 2 i* * 95</page><page sequence="5">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY its offshoots, including French symbolism, being essentially a musical or "musicalised" art, must necessarily lay great stress on memory; and its source of inspiration, the pattern-pantheism, re inforces this backward urge: all Being moves backward towards its originating centre (cf., Rousseau's idea of a golden age). And it applies to the development of remembrance a subtle and original technique: it strengthens the qualities of remembrance, which are already characteristic of musical art in general by using subjects of remembrance, such as the Middle Ages, the national past, national legends and the memories of the poet's own vicissitudes (hence the "romantic egotism"). It remembers and utilises even the dim past of humanity, its prehistoric stages. And by thus going back to the beginnings of time, Romantic art finds a common origin for all forms of life. The life-force of the individual poet is linked up with the eternal life-force, so that the differences between the in dividual and the totality disappear, and nature becomes one with the poet, landscape becomes a mood (an "etat d'?me"), the poet becomes a cosmos. This technique has persisted right up to our own times, and there is a striking example of it in Stefan Zweig's story of Die Frau und die Landschaft (the Woman and the Land scape), where a woman is a sort of concentration-point for the thunderstorm, so that we can scarcely distinguish between the two. Feuchtwanger's ]ud Suss abounds in similar passages. Pushing its subtleties further, nineteenth century poetry some times makes its memories doubly reminiscent by giving them the form of remembrances of a remembrance. Thus ih Leconte de Lisle's Khiron the poet calls up from the memories of the past the figure of the legendary centaur, who in turn recalls the dim memories of his world, stretching away into the mists of time's beginning. The same technique is adopted by Victor Hugo in his Satyre, in which, moreover, the unconscious forms of life reach back into the depths of memory and being: thus the tree is linked with the remotest depths of the earth and with the seeds of its own life force that there lie latent: The earth beneath it opens its dark pit Wherein are leaves and flowers and the moving mass Of branches that the wind will sway anon. Nor is that all. Nineteenth century poetry remembers man's dim Edenic past and tries to recapture it; the phenomenal world be comes a system of "correspondences" for calling up the lost Eden 96</page><page sequence="6">PANTHEISM, POETRY AND POLITICS (Baudelaire, and later, here in Australia, Christopher Brennan), a system of "symbols" reaching back into the beginnings of mind and the subconscious (Mallarme and the Symbolists). And when we bear this in mind, we realise how logically Marcel Proust (who is above all a poet), with the web of intricate memories that he slowly weaves in his Recherche du Temps perdu, takes his place towards the end of this Romantic genealogy. Technically, then, Romanticism marked the beginning of a tremendous backward urge: backward towards the pantheistic, musical centre of spiritual radiation. And it is perhaps to Roman ticism that we owe also the remarkable development of history and kindred studies in the nineteenth century. It is usually taken for granted that historical discoveries gave Romanticism its backward urge; but it is probably just as reasonable to assume that this back ward urge of Romanticism made these discoveries possible. Or are they both expressions of the same Zeitgeist? However, it may be, science went further and further back this road of remem brances: first came the development of historical studies, then the science of prehistory, then Darwin's theory of origins. We realise that all this is essentially post-Romantic if we stop to consider that the pre-Romantic sense of history was a social thing rather than a real technique of remembrance. It served to edify and instruct the members of a well-organised modern society, as in Bossuet's Discours sur Vhistoire universelle, and in English classical teaching Greece and Rome seemed for a long time to exist merely for the ethical training of English public school boys. . . . And finally, let us notice how Nietzsche, with his Hellenic urge and his musical theory of tragedy, sums up the tendencies of his century; in his work we have all that I have just described: pattern-pantheism, memory-technique, musicalism, all brought together and labelled with that convenient and immortal Nietzchean term, Dionysos. The new political systems of to-day more or less unconsciously follow the same road. Where older cultures matured slowly in the light of the sun and the cold of the winter, these modern ones are striving to work out a pattern (disguised sometimes under the name of a "plan"): the Russian, the Italian, the German pattern, each of them being an exteriorisation of its own godhead, an enlargement towards the source. Each strives to move in one great rhythm, radiating from a centre: the Dictator. Each has its musical in cantation, its Dionysian hymn as it were, its pattern-gesture or salute. And each has its sacred fund of remembrances: for 97</page><page sequence="7">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY Germany it is the golden age of the Altgermanen, reaching back to the still holier period of the Aryans; for Italy it is the classical age of Rome, reaching backward towards the She-Wolf. We do not hear much of a Russian golden age situated in the past, but it may yet come to light, for we must not forget that Marx was a Jew, with the memories of the pre-capitalist patriarchal days in his blood; and there was never a prophet who did not look backward as well as forward. . . . Let me make it clear that I am condemning none of these systems (though I admit an innate dislike of communism on account of its materialistic basis), but merely trying to find a "metaphysical" genealogy for them. My point of view is that each country is entitled to have the system that it likes, and my objec tions begin only when it wants to export its theories, Russia cer tainly being the offender in this respect (or would it be more correct to say that we have too many indent-agents here who are trying to interest us in the Soviets' intellectual wares?). III. There is a third kind of pantheism, which we might call the Classical, for it reminds us in some ways of Lucretius, who argues that nothing is ever engendered out of nothing by divine power, nullam rem e nilo gigni divinitus umquam (I, 150), and yet attributes an eternal, engendering power to nature and writes his poem under the sign of Venus. For the classical pantheists, God or the Gods are only a symbol of this everlasting fertility, and in themselves have no reality of contact with us. We see them occasionally, but only as symbols begotten of our own mind when we realise the deeper beauty of things or their inner tragedy. That is what we call seeing things \sub specie aeternitatis, a mode of vision that Christianity has arrogated to itself, but which is common to all classical thought. In France this kind of pantheism has been worked out into a subtle and beautiful philosophy of art in the last hundred years. Beginning at the end, let us take an example from Jean Giradoux' recent play, Electre, based on the Greek theme of Agamemnon's daughter. Aegisthus, discussing the existence of the Gods, says: "I believe in them not as great powers of attention and surveillance, but as great distractions. Between the spaces and the durations, ever coquetting; between the gravitations and the voids, ever at war, there are great indifferences which are the Gods." And a little later he goes on: "There are no two ways of sending a signal (to the Gods) . . . One has to get away from the herd, mount an eminence and swing one's lantern or flag. You 98</page><page sequence="8">PANTHEISM, POETRY AND POLITICS betray the earth as you betray a beleaguered place, by signals. The philosopher makes them from his terrace, the poet or the desperate man from his balcony or from the place where he takes his plunge. If the Gods, for years past, have not come to meddle with our life, it is because I have seen to it that the promontories are empty and the fairs full, because I have ordered dreamers, painters and chemists to get married. . . . Nothing better maintains the im mobility of the Gods than the same absence of conspicuousness and the same equality of atmosphere around murders and petty thefts." That is the negative side of the doctrine, put by a cautious ruler who aims at peace through mediocrity. It is only the extraordinary act, the unusual ecstasy that flashes a signal to the Gods, and this signal is reflected back from their crystalline perfection in the form of a lofty inspiration, a poetic creation, a great event or a great catastrophe. This is precisely the opposite of the pattern-pantheism. It is the old theme of classicism: the attainment of the universal through the magnification of the particular. And that is why we find it most fully developed in France, on the age-old soil of classicism. It is the theme of Baudelaire at his best, when he feels divinity as a diamond-point of perfection. . . . made of pure light, Drawn from the holy centre of primal rays, Of which the eyes of mortals in their splendour Are only mirrors plaintive and obscure. (Benediction.) It is the theme of Mallarme at times, for whom reality is so perfect as to be almost a void, a "transparent glacier of flights unflown." And it is one of the principal themes of M. Paul Valery, who alter nates it with the theme of life's incessant activity. This alternation makes up the whole structure of his ]eune Parque, and we find it everywhere in his Cimetiere marin, from which I quote one example: Ah, what reward it is after a thought To cast a long look on the calm of the Gods! In M. Valery's condensed style "a thought" here stands for life's conscious strivings. The fact is that this alternation is part of the innermost secret of classicism, a secret too often concealed or made banal by the formula of "a just equilibrium." We must be alternately actors and spectators, accepting the nothingness of things and yet enjoy ing their beauty, realising life's imperfections and illusions, and yet 99</page><page sequence="9">THE AUSTRALIAN QUARTERLY satisfying ourselves with occasional glimpses of that perfection that is so absolute that it ceases to have a concrete content (and here perhaps you will see my aesthetic reason for disliking com munism, which cannot imagine an entity minus a content). Nietzsche, who was a classic as well as a romantic, sometimes held this view, and found in art the means of emancipation from Schopenhauer's thesis of the eternal illusion. Art sets us free, not by making the illusory phenomena of the cosmos real in the vulgar sense, but by enabling us to build up, beyond the fleeting forms, a perfection of beauty that is unassailable. Reality is an aura set above illusions, a projection of the godlike human spirit into the shifting scenes of life and death. And in the political sphere such is, I think, the metaphysical background of Charles Maurras' doctrines. Lacking Catholic faith, he yet sets store by Catholicism, for it holds a key to that garden wherein we can see things sub specie aeternitatis. Avoiding the pattern, he sets store by the individual, and sees in the enlargement of individual personalities the one way of sending a signal to the Gods as it were. Humanity is to be led not by a pattern-maker who weaves it into a standardised design, but by those who have some hope of contact with the eternal by virtue of their long heri tage, which is itself a human adumbration of the eternal. Kings are above the battle of money and politics, yet attached to their country by threads that run through many centuries. Thus they are at once actors and spectators, poets and men, living in time and living in eternity. . . . And in the light of the foregoing we could find a metaphysical explanation of M. Maurras* hatred for centrali sation, his stressing of the value of regionalism. Centralisation is not a crystalline perfection, for it is made up of too many elements to be crystalline, and the idea of perfection can reside only in a human brain, and not in the onward march of a standardised totality. Perfection is attainable only through the calm of the spirit, and a mass is not a calmness, but an agitation. It can strive and aspire and threaten and sway, but it cannot meditate. To those Maurrassians who would accuse me of having read too much into the thought of their master, I would recommend his Invocation to Minerva, and above all its closing sentence: "Goddess who lovest men, thy charm alone is fitted to lead us to the divine." Surely that means that only the harmonious meditation of our own mind can ever lead us towards the idea of a perfection set high above the surging seas of life and politics. 100</page></plain_text>
