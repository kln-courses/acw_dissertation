Friedrich Schlegel, Athenaeum Fragment 281 the census fi gures come out wrong there’s an extra in our midst Silver Jews, “The Ballad of Reverend War Character” The Right to Have Rights Readers of Hannah Arendt’s The Origins of Totalitarianism have  long hailed it as a ground-breaking analysis of modern mass atroc- ity. However, we are only recently beginning to plumb the depths  of its critical account of human rights. According to the fi rst article  of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, which ap- peared just three years prior to Arendt’s book, “All human beings  are born free and equal in dignity and rights.”1 For Arendt the  problem with this proposition is that its emphasis on birth assumes  that rights are hard-wired into one’s natural existence as a human  being, when in fact politics takes form as the artifi ce of speaking  and acting as a member of an organized community, for example,  as a citizen of a nation-state, something quite different from be- ing a member of a biological species. This biologistic assumption  not only removes human beings from the concrete, artifi cial cir- </page> <page sequence="2"> 224 qui parle   spring/summer 2011   vol.19, no.2   cumstances that give reality to political communities; it abandons  them to an animal ontology in principle disarticulated from the  conditions of ethical responsibility and political action. On this ac- count the subject who is said to bear rights is, then, not a human  being at all, but rather an animal. Hence the tough wit of Arendt’s  observation about the similarities between human rights advocacy  groups and societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals: while  human rights advocates think they are fi ghting practices in which  human beings are treated like animals, they are themselves actu- ally engaged in a campaign for the rights of animals, a campaign,  moreover, with little chance of practical success.2 Animal advo- cates, such as Peter Singer, might often characterize the call for a  radical transformation of humanist speciesism as an extension of  campaigns for the rights of ethnic minorities, gay and lesbian mi- norities, women, and so on. For Arendt, human rights are already  a form of animal rights. At the same time, she is quick to clarify that the biopolitical  reading does not exhaustively describe the real-world work that  rights can perform. In fact, her critique of human rights is simulta- neously an affi rmation of what she calls “the right to have rights.”  This suggestive phrase has in recent years served as the common  jumping-off point for some of the most inventive scholarly efforts  to recover the important role that rights have played and still can  play in our attempts to address urgent political problems.3 The  right to have rights is not one imputed to inhere in the biological  existence of human beings, and yet it is not itself one of the rights  already possessed by citizens. It is the right to become a citizen,  the right to a position in a society in which one can effectively  exercise one’s rights. “Its loss entails the loss of the relevance of  speech (and man, since Aristotle, was defi ned as the being com- manding the power of speech and thought), and the loss of all  human relationship (and man, since Aristotle, has been thought  of as the ‘political animal,’ that is one who by defi nition lives in  a community), the loss, in other words, of some of the most es- sential characteristics of human life” (OT, 297). Insofar as it can  be deduced from the ontological human capacity for speech and  action—the distinctively human activities in which politics mate- </page> <page sequence="3"> Hunt: Rights of the Infi nite 225 rializes—the right to have rights would seem to be, as Arendt puts  it, “the one human right.”4 The negative form of Arendt’s formulations of the right to have  rights, however, already hints at an interesting gap opened up be- tween this right and human rights as such. She dilates on this gap  in her very fi rst mention of the right to have rights, where she times  its emergence into cognition to correspond with the appearance of  those who have lost this and all other rights: “We became aware  of the existence of a right to have rights (and that means to live  in a framework where one is judged by one’s actions and opin- ions) and a right to belong to some kind of organized communi- ty, only when millions of people emerged who had lost and could  not regain these rights because of the new global situation” (OT,  296–97).5 Her immediate reference here is to the appearance in  increasing numbers since World War I of political minorities and  stateless peoples. Such people are deprived not just of the particu- lar rights listed in declarations of human rights but of membership  in any community willing and able to guarantee their exercise of  any rights. Paradoxically, it is with those who have lost the right to  have rights that this right appears. But if this is so, then given that  Arendt explicates the loss of this right as the dispossession of “the  most essential characteristics of human life,” those whose suffering  is the occasion of her vindication of the right to have rights are not  exactly human beings. Furthermore, this right is not exactly a right  of human beings, but rather the right of those reduced to an animal  condition that human rights are powerless to help rectify. Perhaps  there is something signifi cant in the literal fact that any reference to  the human species does not survive the translation from the “rights  of man” and “human rights” to the “right to have rights.” Far  from being formally deduced from a specifi cally human ontology,  the right to have rights emerges from the crisis of the human as  an effective ground for rights. Insofar as the right to have rights is  claimed by those reduced to a condition of rightlessness, perhaps  the author of The Human Condition, one of the most magnifi cent  humanist treatises of the twentieth century, is in her own way also  an advocate of animal rights.6 So why does Arendt’s attempt to ground human rights in a prop- </page> <page sequence="4"> 226 qui parle   spring/summer 2011   vol.19, no.2   erly human ontology end up with a subject of rights that is not hu- man? What is the relationship between being specifi cally human  and the subject of rights? Is being a member of the human species  a necessary property of the subject of rights, or can other entities,  such as nonhuman animals, also bear rights? Is the subject of rights  even something that can be said to have properties? Just who—or  what—is the subject of rights? In this essay I argue that the diffi culty of giving human form  to the subject of rights, far from being an idiosyncratic quirk of  Arendt’s text, is an essential feature of the discourse of rights and  can be traced back to the very acts by which rights materialize in  the world. We will examine an exemplary articulation of these acts  in an essay written by the early German romantic writer Friedrich  Schlegel around the time of the French Revolution. Schlegel vindi- cates what he calls “the rights of the infi nite” (“die Rechte des Un- endlichen”). Like the right to have rights, the rights of the infi nite  are, I will argue, irreducible to the rights of human beings, because  the act of claiming rights calls into question any defi nitive identi- fi cation of the subject of rights. The subject of rights is not some- thing we can clearly determine, let alone determine as specifi cally  human, but rather what issues from the excess of act over represen- tation. Schlegel condenses this interminable excess in, precisely, an  X that marks the subject of rights as unnameable and indefi nable  and thus in principle open toward the nonhuman. Such an X does  not amount to a direct argument for the rights of the other-than- human, such as animals. In fact, it suggests something more funda- mental: that human rights have never been only or wholly human. The Community of Humankind Out of all the resources to which one might turn in thinking what  we are doing when we claim and exercise human rights, early Ger- man romanticism is probably not the fi rst that comes to mind. In  fact, given the persistence of belief in a genealogy between German  romanticism and National Socialism, it might be the last.7 More- over, while the misconception that the early German romantics  were too lost in the swells of passion or the abstractions of specu- </page> <page sequence="5"> Hunt: Rights of the Infi nite 227 lative idealism to pay attention to political realities has long been  debunked, existing scholarship gives little indication that they said  very much about human rights. In literary studies this impression  stems from the way we tend to conceive of early romantic politi- cal discourse—and this holds for both British and German roman- ticism—as a debate between liberals and conservatives about the  French Revolution. While the Revolution took place in the name  of human rights, the topography of the pro-revolutionary and an- ti-revolutionary opposition seems to displace scholarly attention  from rights discourse.8 In human rights studies, the silence on early  German romanticism is amplifi ed if not wholly explained by the  imposing fi gure that Kant cuts in the historiography of human  rights. Given that historians routinely credit him with being among  the fi rst to formulate elements central to both the theory of human  rights (e.g., the categorical imperative) and the practice of human  rights (e.g., a federation of nation-states), the long shadow he casts  effectively obscures the contributions of his immediate followers.9 In fact, those who followed Kant sometimes took a decided- ly more radical position on human rights than he ever explicitly  avowed. Of all those to do so, the best-known, at least to his con- temporaries, was Johann Gottlieb Fichte, who in his philosophical  writings and the popular Contributions to the Correction of the  Judgments of the Public on the French Revolution and Science of  Knowledge (1793) argued for republican politics too radical for  Kant to countenance.10 Another to radicalize Kant’s politics be- yond Kant’s explicit intentions was Friedrich Schlegel, perhaps the  central fi gure in early German romanticism. To be sure, Schlegel’s  radical position would not endure unadulterated.11 Nevertheless,  his “Essay on the Concept of Republicanism” (“Versuch über den  Begriff des Republikanismus”) from 1796 is widely recognized as  one of the most progressive political writings produced during the  1790s in Germany. It is time to appreciate it more specifi cally as  one of the most radical vindications of rights of the same period. The central point of Schlegel’s essay, readers agree, is a critique  of Kant’s hard distinction in “Towards Perpetual Peace” between  republicanism and democracy. The essential feature of a republic,  for Kant, is the separation between the executive and legislative  </page> <page sequence="6"> 228 qui parle   spring/summer 2011   vol.19, no.2   powers. Such a distinction ensures that the government does not  give itself laws to implement and thus displace the general will with  its own private will. It is for this reason that Kant says republican- ism is actually incompatible with democracy. For in a democratic  state the people—through their representatives—serve as both the  executive and the legislative powers. As counterintuitive as it is  seems to twenty-fi rst-century modern sensibilities, this makes de- mocracy by defi nition despotic because it leaves no power to op- pose the will of the people.12 Schlegel’s point-blank counterclaim is that “Republicanism is . . .  necessarily democratic.”13 What I want to stress is that this thesis  comes at the ends of an argument that begins as a discussion of  what a human being is. At this beginning point Schlegel’s critical  move is to one-up Kant’s merely practical foundation of repub- licanism upon “the idea of an original contract [ursprünglichen  Vertrags]” (“PP,” 99–100; “EF,” 297) with a formal “deduction  of republicanism” (“Deduktion des Republicanismus”) from the  ontological nature of human beings. He borrows his conception  of human being from the fi rst principle of the 1794 edition of Jo- hann Gottlieb Fichte’s Science of Knowledge (Wissenschaftslehre),  namely, “I am” (“Ich bin”) or “I = I” (“Ich = Ich”). As is well  known, Fichte also presents this principle in the normative form of  “the I should be” (“das Ich soll sein”). Schlegel’s innovative twist  is to argue that “the I should be” means slightly different things  when considered in relation to particular human capacities. Con- sidered in relation to the capacity of one human being to commu- nicate with other human beings, “the I should be” indicates the a  priori legitimate form of political community. By means of the theoretical datum that the human being, apart  from the capacity it possesses as a pure isolated individual as  such, has the capacity of communication [das Vermögen der  Mitteilung] (the activities of all other capacities) in relation  to other individuals of its species [andern Individuum seiner  Gattug]—that human individuals actually, or at least could,  stand in a relation of reciprocal natural infl uence to one anoth- er—the pure practical imperative receives a new specifi c modifi - cation, which is the foundation and object of a new science. The  </page> <page sequence="7"> Hunt: Rights of the Infi nite 229 proposition ‘the I should be’ means in this specifi c case ‘the com- munity of humankind should be’ or ‘the I should be communi- cated’ [Gemeinschaft der Menschheit soll sein, oder das ich soll  mitgeteilt werden]. This derived practical thesis is the foundation  and subject matter of politics. (“CR,” 99–100; KS, 14–15) It is the capacity of human beings to communicate with each other  that allows Schlegel to politicize the pure practical imperative. By  way of communication, “the I should be” becomes “the commu- nity of human kind should be.” Communication among human  beings, we could say, implies community among human beings.  The proposition that this community should exist is what he calls  the “political imperative” (“politische Imperativ”) (“CR,” 100,  KS, 15). Schlegel’s next move is to assert that the political imperative  requires universal freedom and equality: “political freedom” and  “political equality” are each a “necessary condition of the politi- cal imperative, and an essential characteristic of the state” (“CR,”  100; KS, 15). His language here is as precise as his ideas are pro- gressive. Participation in political community, he insists, must be  available not merely for “every single individual [jedem einzel- nen Individuo],” but for “every individual [jedes].” In elaborat- ing what the universality of freedom and equality mean in con- crete terms, Schlegel makes what many readers take to be one of  the most extraordinary and contemporary contentions in the es- say. No human being, he says, can be arbitrarily deprived of the  right to vote. “Poverty and presumed corruptibility, femininity and  presumed weakness are indeed not legitimate grounds to exclude  someone from the right to vote [Stimmrecht]. If the political fi c- tion to regard an individual as a political non-entity, a person as  a thing [ein Individuum für eine politische Nüll, eine Person für  eine Sache], were permitted, then it would . . . confl ict with the  ethical imperative” (“CR,” 102; KS, 17). Schlegel’s vindication of  an unlimited democratic franchise is indeed extraordinary for a  time when not only supporters of monarchy and aristocracy but  also most human rights advocates across Europe could not take  seriously such claims. Kant, as we have seen, rejected democracy  in principle. And not even Thomas Paine, the great British human  </page> <page sequence="8"> 230 qui parle   spring/summer 2011   vol.19, no.2   rights advocate of the 1790s, brought himself to consider such a  universal franchise. Out of all the German philosophers of the peri- od, only Johann Gottfried Herder and Georg Forster, the leader of  the short-lived Mainz republic, dared such an assertion in print.14 The universally human reach of Schlegel’s version of democrat- ic community is confi rmed in the naturalistic fi gures used to de- scribe it. The state “comprises an uninterrupted mass, a coexistent  and successive continuum of human beings, the totality of which  stand in a relation of physical infl uence to one another [ununter- brochne Masse, ein koexistentes und sukzessives Kontinuum von  Menschen, die Totalität derer, die im Verhältnis des physichen Ein- fl usses stehn], e.g. all inhabitants in a country, all descendants of a  family.” The state is, by defi nition, distinct from political associa- tions that have “special ends, and therefore only concern particular  individuals. All these societies comprise no mass, no total continu- um, but only connect single scattered members [keine Masse, kein  totales Kontinuum, sondern verknüpfen nur einzelne zerstreute  Mitglieder]” (“CR,” 100–101; KS, 15). The body part implicit in  “members” (“Mitglieder”) merely emphasizes what the rest of the  passage makes plain, namely, that whereas a non-democratic com- munity is merely a discontinuous collection of entities with only  an accidental connection to each other, a democratic community  exists as a political body continuous enough to be thought of as a  natural whole. One might be tempted to say that such a fi gure fore- shadows in miniature the organic conception of the state, which it  is said the German romantics, following the great English critic of  human rights, Edmund Burke, put to a conservative use. However,  here at least the fi gure serves the decidedly radical purpose of af- fi rming the universality of a political community isomorphic with  the human species. Schlegel’s vindication, against Kant, of democ- racy is founded in a political imperative that itself takes the specifi - cally human as its condition. Political Fiction The point of my largely thematic summary of this part of the “Es- say on the Concept of Republicanism” is simply to prepare us for  </page> <page sequence="9"> Hunt: Rights of the Infi nite 231 the claim I want to make about the next step of the text’s argu- ment. My reading travels some similar ground with that offered  by Michel Chaouli in an essay entitled “The Politics of Permanent  Parabasis,” but ends up at a very different conclusion.15 Chaouli  contends that the human capacity for communication that Schle- gel takes as the foundation of political community “is merely the  general form of aesthetic communication.” Hence Schlegel’s poetic  theory “would seem to give expression to that original impulse  with great precision” (“PPP,” 330). An important feature of ro- mantic poetry is captured in Schlegel’s well-known defi nition in  Critical Fragment 42 of irony as “permanent parabasis” (“perma- nente Parekbase”) of communication, an interruption that, as Paul  de Man has emphasized, is uninterrupted or infi nite. “But what  kind of a monstrosity,” Chaouli asks, “is a movement that is inter- rupted at all times? How are we to imagine a process of writing— and a society modeled on it—that has a break at every point of its  narrative?” (“PPP,” 333). His answer is that a theory of poetry that  turns upon the interruption of communication models not merely  a dangerous form of political community but the destruction of the  political itself. “In those moments,” he writes in the fi nal sentence  of his essay, “art affords us not with a positive utopia of what  social relations might ideally look like, but with a glance at the  real possibility that social bonds might, at any moment, dissolve”  (“PPP,” 339–40). My minor point of disagreement with Chaouli concerns the texts  by Schlegel in which this infi nite breakdown of communication  and of community is legible. While he locates it in texts addressed  explicitly to poetry—the essays on classical and modern literature,  the Athenaeum Fragments, and the Critical Fragments—I think  this breakdown is already evident in the “Essay on the Concept  of Republicanism.” My more important divergence concerns Cha- ouli’s characterization of such breakdown as an unsuitable model  for democratic politics. Schlegel’s vindication of universal human  rights, I contend, turns upon the insight that it is not communica- tion but rather the interruption of communication—which is not  the same thing as the absence of communication—that bears the  progressive aspirations of democratic community. If democratic  </page> <page sequence="10"> 232 qui parle   spring/summer 2011   vol.19, no.2   community is necessarily one of universal freedom and equality, if  it holds for each and every individual, then such community is one  that, in the words of Jacques Derrida, cannot not take “a glance  toward those who . . . turn their eyes away when faced by the as  yet unnamable which is proclaiming itself . . . only under the spe- cies of the nonspecies, in the formless, mute, infant, and terrifying  form of monstrosity.”16 “Equality and freedom,” Schlegel asserts, “demand [erfordert]  that the general will [allgemeine Wille] be the ground [Grund] of all  particular political activities (not only the laws, but also their op- erative judgments and execution)” (“CR,” 101, translation modi- fi ed; KS, 15). A widely used term in eighteenth-century political  theory, the “general will” was most famously associated with Jean- Jacques Rousseau, who defi ned it as the synthetic expression of  the intentions of a collection of individuals who have been formed  into a people by a social pact.17 The general will is the unifi ed in- tention of those individual subjects who bear rights as members  of a community, and it is itself fi gured as the intention of a subject  that, via referenda or general elections, fi nds form in the law. This  is how it appears in the sixth article of the French National Assem- bly’s Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789:  “Law is the expression of the general will [volonté générale].”18 In  the logic of the argument of the “Essay,” the general will initially  serves Schlegel as a criterion by which, contra Kant, to differenti- ate republicanism from despotism. A despotic state is one in which  the ground of all political activity is a “private will,” the special  interests of an individual or a group smaller than the entire com- munity. By contrast, the general will, which is the basis of politics  in a republican state, synthesizes the interests of each and every  member of a community. It is the will of the generality or univer- sality (Allgemeingheit) of subjects. As Schlegel’s account continues, however, the signifi cance of fi g- uring the general will as a “ground” that is called into existence by  a “demand” becomes clear, whether the general will is capable of  serving as the “ground” of politics. For not only is it the object of  a “demand” by freedom and equality, a demand that takes as its  condition of possibility the absence of ground; the acts by which it  fi nds expression are also groundless. </page> <page sequence="11"> Hunt: Rights of the Infi nite 233 But how is republicanism possible, because the general will is its  necessary condition, but the absolute general [der absolut allge- meine] (and therefore absolute enduring) will does not appear  in the realm of experience and exists only in the world of pure  thought [in der Welt der reinen Gedanken existiert]. The singu- lar and the universal are even separated from one another by an  infi nite gulf [unendliche Kluft], over which one can get only by  a salto mortale [durch einen Salto mortale]. Nothing more re- mains here than, by a fi ction [durch eine Fiktion], to regard an  empirical will as the surrogate [Surrogat] of the a priori virtual  absolute general will. Since a pure resolution [reine Aufl ösung]  of the political problem is impossible, we have to make do with  the approximation to this practical x [der Approximation die- ses praktischen x]. Because the political imperative is categorical,  and can be realized only in this manner (in infi nite approximation  [endlosen Annäherung]), the highest fi ctio juris is not only justi- fi ed but practically necessary. However, it is valid only in cases  when it does not contradict the political imperative (the founda- tion of its claims [das Fundament ihrer Ansprüche]) and its es- sential conditions. (“CR,” 101–2, translation modifi ed; KS, 16) The complexity of Schlegel’s account of the general will is evi- dent within the fi rst sentence of this paragraph, where the assertion  that the general will is the condition of possibility of republicanism  is immediately qualifi ed by the explanation that the condition of  possibility of the general will is its absence from the phenomenal  world and the impossibility of our experiencing it. Perhaps it is at  this point that an early German romantic account of rights derived  from an idealist conception of the subject starts to look as far re- moved as it is possible to get from the material realities of politics.  What purchase on practical political life can be attributed to a gen- eral will that, because it is absolute, virtual, and ideal, takes no  phenomenal form? And yet consider how, by calling into question the possibility  that the general will can materialize in a determinate phenomenal  location, Schlegel focuses attention on the act by which a particu- lar individual or group claims to represent the will of all those who  </page> <page sequence="12"> 234 qui parle   spring/summer 2011   vol.19, no.2   bear rights. If the general will is located on the far side of a gulf  that is “infi nite,” then it is clear that no one can coherently claim  that their will is that general will. All one can claim is that one’s  will stands in for the general will. In Schlegel’s language, a particu- lar empirical entity can be a “surrogate” (from the Latin surrogãre,  “to substitute”) for the one absolute general will. The way Schlegel  introduces the necessity of this act of substitution even performs  the political surrogacy he is describing. The practical act of substi- tution with which we must “make do” itself substitutes for a theo- retical or “pure resolution” to this problem. Schlegel specifi es that the substitution between the infi nitely  distant singular and universal is achieved by means of “fi ction,”  “fi ctio juris” (“legal fi ction”), or what, in the next paragraph, he  calls “political fi ction” (“CR,” 102; KS, 17). The particular na- ture of such fi ction is suggested in the striking image of a “salto  mortale” taken over the “infi nite gulf.” In Italian, salto mortale  literally means “mortal leap.” Within acrobatics it is the name for  a somersault, that is, the rotation of a body around an axis such  that the feet move over the head. In a religious context it is com- monly translated as “leap of faith.” In 1793 Kant used the phrase  to describe a political situation in which a power decides to rule  by means of an appeal to “force” rather than an appeal to “right.”  Such a “counsel leap of desperation (salto mortale),” he says, may  occasion the people themselves to resort to force.19 As Schlegel’s fi g- ure for the operation of a fi ction required to practically articulate  form a will that is universal, a salto mortale over an infi nite gulf  signifi es that the fi ctional substitution involved is nonreferential.  The fact that there is no far side on which to land suggests that the  general will does not presuppose a referent. The fact that, knowing  this, one still jumps means that such a salto mortale is pure action.  For one cannot simultaneously think and jump to what appears  to be one’s certain death. One must just do it. The phenomenal  materialization of the general will proceeds, then, not on the basis  of knowledge but as a sheer act. It takes place—in the absence of  all given place to take—as an active verbal deed that mobilizes the  noncognitive, positional power of language to performatively con- stitute its referent. It is as rhetorical act rather than representation  </page> <page sequence="13"> Hunt: Rights of the Infi nite 235 of referential meaning that a community claims to embody the uni- versality of subjects of rights. The unbridgeable gulf that separates  empirical wills from the general will preserves politics as a matter  of practice rather than theory. Schlegel is well aware that the fi ctional nature of the representa- tion of the will of all is vulnerable to being appropriated by des- potic forces that pursue special interests under the protective cover  of a specious claim to serving the community as a whole. Upon  fi rst introducing the general will, he acknowledges that the distinc- tion between despotism and republicanism can be tricky to draw,  given that very often “despotism usurps the appearance of the gen- eral will” and “promotes, if only accidentally, the interest of the  community along with its special ends” (“CR,” 101; KS, 15–16).  And yet in the same passage Schlegel declares that all even des- potic power masquerading as a republican power is vulnerable— not to greater external powers, but to its own operations: “against  its knowledge and will [Wissen und Wollen] [despotism] carries  the germs of a genuine state within itself” (“CR,” 101, translation  modifi ed; KS, 16). At the end of a footnote appended to this pas- sage, he declares, “The fi nite cannot usurp unpunished the rights of  the infi nite” (“Das Endliche darf die Rechte des Unendlichen nicht  ungestraft usurpieren” “CR”, 101; KS, 16). That the “Essay” as a  whole is meticulously argued and takes a polite tone towards Kant  throughout all disagreements only makes it more conspicuous that  this marginal declarative sentence does not just hang unsupported  by explanatory evidence, but also reeks of a presumptive confi - dence that would become a tonal hallmark of his Schlegel’s frag- mentary writings. What justifi es such a bold assertion? The answer is partially revealed in the very way Schlegel’s rejec- tion of Kant’s rejection of democracy performs the essential indeter- mination of the claim he sees as essential to rights discourse. Like  most political forces who campaigned for human rights in the late  eighteenth century, Kant did not take seriously the idea that people  could express the general will. The state should represent the gen- eral will, he acknowledges, but this does not mean that the people  must express that will by voting. Better to leave such an important  task up to those qualifi ed to do so. In “Towards Perpetual Peace”  </page> <page sequence="14"> 236 qui parle   spring/summer 2011   vol.19, no.2   and “On the Common Saying,” moreover, he presents his rejection  of both the right to insurrection and the right to vote as an effort to  protect not just republicanism but also the rights of man. As we have seen, Schlegel’s response is: “Republicanism is . . .  therefore necessarily democratic” (“CR,” 102). At the level of the  sentence, his affi rmation of democracy might take a positive form;  rhetorically, it takes the form of a denial of a denial. For the neces- sary condition of Schlegel’s vindication of the people’s right to elect  a representative government is Kant’s disavowal of that very right.  In Schlegel’s terms, Kant’s political fi ction mistakes “an individu- al for a political non-entity, a person for a thing [ein Individuum  für eine politische Nüll, eine Person für eine Sache]” (“CR,” 102;  KS, 17). Since the thingness of the persons whom Kant defi nes as  things is a crucial part of the occasion of Schlegel’s vindication,  then in a certain sense the beings whose right to vote he is vindi- cating are not wholly persons. What is at issue is not simply the  rights of persons, but also the rights of things. More than this,  the voice (Stimme) implicit in the German word for right to vote  (Stimmrecht) means that we are dealing not just with things that  vote but with things that speak. Schlegel’s declaration is ultimately  that, against all appearances to the contrary, things have a right to  speak, to say “Ich bin” and even “Ich soll sein.” My larger point, however, is that the form of the practical act by  which Schlegel vindicates the right to vote belies any assumption  that the universality of subjects of rights can be given determinate  form. Moreover, if freedom and equality of rights materializes in  Schlegel’s text as a practice of resistance to coercion and discrimi- nation, then it is crucial to appreciate that this practice includes re- sistance to forms of coercion and discrimination that emerge from  efforts to practically institute rights. Schlegel’s vindication of the  rights of the infi nite is directed against Kant’s vindication of human  rights. This antinomy internal to rights discourse produces a form  of universality that Étienne Balibar dubs “negative universality.”20  What is negative about such universality is that rights claims do  not proceed from the certainty of a recognition of those who bear  rights, but materialize as a loss of unconsciousness about the lack  of certainty in knowing who bears rights. </page> <page sequence="15"> Hunt: Rights of the Infi nite 237 Schlegel’s most compressed account of political fi ction, however,  comes in his presentation of the general will as a mark. In the pas- sage I quoted above we read, “Since a pure resolution of the politi- cal problem is impossible, we have to content ourselves with the  approximation to this practical X.” From the context, it is clear  that X means—or substitutes for—the absolute general will that  takes no phenomenal form.21 And yet unlike what in the previous  sentence he called the “a priori virtual absolute general will,” X,  as a mark, rather than substituting for a word, performs the fi c- tional act of substitution upon which democratic politics depends.  For X is not a surrogate for a particular thing in the way that “a  priori virtual absolute general will” is. X can be the twenty-fourth  letter of the modern Latin alphabet, the sign of multiplication in  mathematics, the Roman numeral for 10, an index of the position  where something is or should be located (“X marks the spot”), an  abbreviation for Christ (“Xmas”), a visual representation of the  rhetorical fi gure of chiasmus, the signature (or mark made in lieu  of a signature) of an illiterate person, an indication of the place  near where a signature should go (X marks a spot beside the spot),  a target to aim at as accurately as possible, a mark of the forbid- den or censored (and hence desired), a homophone of “ex” (as in  former, exterior), a variable for an unknown or changing concepts  in mathematics, a sign of affi rmation (e.g., on voting papers), a  sign of negation, error, failure, or falsehood (e.g., the opposite of  a check mark), and a saltire or heraldic symbol (e.g., St. Andrew’s  cross). For us, if not for Schlegel, X can also be the name of a Los  Angeles punk band, a North American slang term for the drug  MDMA (“ecstasy”), the graphic mark that puts a word “under  erasure” (as in Heidegger and Derrida), a conventional way of rep- resenting the eyes of a deceased entity in cartoons, a sign of a near- by railroad crossing, a sign of “cross,” the name of my generation,  and a kiss. For me, X is the mark I temporarily put beside quota- tions in place of page numbers I do not have to hand while drafting  essays such as this one. I’ll stop listing. However, the point is not so much that X is a lot  of (often contradictory) things, or that it is everything, but rather  </page> <page sequence="16"> 238 qui parle   spring/summer 2011   vol.19, no.2   that it is anything: X is “that which” is in principle indeterminate  and unknowable.22 Unlike such words as “a priori virtual absolute  general will,” the mark X does not refer to a referent, but to its  own inability to take a referent. This is not to say X simply marks  the absence of reference. For, as a mark that makes sense within a  network of differences (linguistic, numerical, graphic, and other- wise), X does refer. But it is because X is referentially hyperactive  that it is defi cient in referential attention. Its capacity to refer is  what prevents it from taking a referent. What it refers to, if any- thing, is not a totality that can be circumscribed or given a deter- minate border. X has no positive thematic content. In other words,  X is a fi gure of fi gure as fi gure. Because it bears referential cargo, X  marks sheer substitution. In the sense that it can even substitute for  itself, but can only approximate rather than be itself, X, we might  say, is substitution. In the logic of the argument built up in Schlegel’s “Essay,” the  way X marks the totality of rights-bearing subjects registers that  we cannot know this totality. Just as the use of variables in algebra  foregrounds the formal operations and relations rather than de- terminate values, so Schlegel’s deployment of X concentrates our  awareness on the formal operation of the claim by which an em- pirically limited political community embodies a will that is uni- versal. This claim itself contains a critical awareness of its own  insuffi ciency to respect the universality of rights-bearers, an insuf- fi ciency that emerges within the act of claiming when our previous  claims that our community respects the rights of all are returned to  us as exclusionary. Since there is no theoretical resolution for this  practical inability to name the universality of the subject of rights,  X is not just a temporary fi ll-in for a positive determination of all  those who bear rights to come. It is not a placeholder with which  we are making do until we replace it with something that holds  properly. The privation of all positive content from the subject of  rights is infi nite, and there can be no end to efforts to represent  X. Substitutability itself, X is unsubstitutable. In the absence of  knowledge about who bears rights, X extends the play of substitu- tion infi nitely. </page> <page sequence="17"> Hunt: Rights of the Infi nite 239 X-Men Étienne Balibar translates the predicament Schlegel encounters in a  widely read essay titled “Citizen Subject” that pursues a trajectory  suggested by Arendt’s phrase the right to have rights.23 The larger  arc of Balibar’s argument is that human rights, as exemplifi ed by  the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen by  the National Assembly of France, far from being the culmination  of earlier natural right theories, are not grounded in an innate or  natural quality in human beings. The point at issue in the follow- ing passage is the corollary thesis that the universality of rights  discourse in principle is not preestablished. Equality cannot be limited. Once some X (‘men’) [certain X  (‘hommes’)] are not equal, the predicate of equality cannot be  applied to anyone, for all to whom it is supposed to be applica- ble are in fact ‘superior,’ ‘dominant,’ ‘privileged,’ etc. Enjoyment  of the equality of rights cannot spread step by step, beginning  with two individuals and gradually extending to all: it must im- mediately concern the universality of individuals, let us say, tau- tologically, the universality of X [l’universalité des X] that it con- cerns. (“CS,” 50, translation modifi ed; “CSR,” 40) What do we make of this brace of X’s? Why does Balibar even  say “X” instead of “men” or “individuals”? More to the point,  why in the fi rst instance say “X” and then immediately say “men”?  Who—or what—is this “X”? To return to the question Arendt  poses for us, Who—or what—are the subjects of rights: human  beings or X? From the juxtaposition of X and men, one could always quite  sensibly infer that the latter is supposed to explicate the meaning  of the former. Similar parenthetical moments in various of Bali- bar’s essays on human rights explicitly call to be read this way:  “all men (meaning: human beings),”24 “the citizen as a man (= a  male)” (“CS,” 53), “only the legal citizens are men (i.e. human  beings).”25 Admittedly “X (‘men’)” lacks the intermediary “mean- ing:,” “=,” or “i.e.,” but one could quite justifi ably say that “X  (‘men’)” means “By ‘X’ I mean ‘men.’” We might translate this  </page> <page sequence="18"> 240 qui parle   spring/summer 2011   vol.19, no.2   proposition, after Fichte and Schlegel, “X = human beings” or “X  should be human beings.” The problem, however, is that Balibar is in the process of as- serting that the universality of political community is in principle  illimitable. It makes sense that at this very moment he would, like  Schlegel, use a mark like X rather than a word, because the sub- ject of rights has no determinate content. X can mark the spot, but  in this instance X is a blind spot, a mark of something we cannot  perceive, conceptualize, or even name. X marks an acute effort by  Balibar and Schlegel to resist the determination of the subject of  rights. (Indeed Balibar will immediately go on to explain how the  idea of a social contract has historically been used to try to “add . . .  to equality a determination that compensates for its ‘excess’ of uni- versality [‘excès’ d’universitalité]” [“SC,” 51; “SCR,” 4].) This is, therefore, the point at which a careful argument about  rights experiences maximal antagonism with the very terms that  articulate and give it form. For Schlegel and Balibar do not fully  abandon the basic anthropologistic assumption that the subject of  rights is human. Even as Balibar renews Arendt’s critique of the  naturalistic mode of human rights, he asserts that (but does not  argue why) the negative universality distinctive of the modern poli- tics of rights is something containable within the human species.  For his part, Schlegel, as we have seen, never explicitly revokes the  Fichtean assumption about being human with which his argument  begins. And yet the very rigor of their own language implies that  the universality of the community of rights is not the universality  of human beings. If X is anything, then this can include human be- ings, but does not include only human beings. X is not the specifi c- ity of the particular things that human beings are. X does not mean  or equal human beings or men, not even X-men. My reference to mutants with an “X-gene” that gives them su- perhuman powers might seem wayward, but monstrosity is pre- cisely what is at issue here. “The investigator of truths,” Fried- rich Nietzsche declares in his essay “On Truth and Lying in an  Extra-Moral Sense,” “is basically seeking just the metamorpho- sis of the world into man [Metamorphose der Welt in den Men- schen]; he is struggling to understand the world as a human-like  </page> <page sequence="19"> Hunt: Rights of the Infi nite 241 thing [menschenartigen Dinges].”26 As an epistemological strategy,  the anthropomorphic tendency to see everything in terms compre- hensible to human beings can, he insists, proceed only as an ef- facement of the radical otherness of the world. Just before he fa- mously answers his own question “What is truth?” with “A mobile  army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms . . . ,”  he writes, “Overlooking the individual and the real gives us the  concept just as it also gives us the form, whereas nature knows no  forms and concepts, hence no species, but only an X that is inac- cessible and indefi nable for us” (“Das Übersehen des Individuellen  und Wirklichen gibt uns den Begriff, wie es uns auch die Form gibt,  wohingegen die Natur keine Formen und Begriffe, also auch ke- ine Gattungen kennt, sondern nur ein für uns unzugängliches und  undefi nierbares X”) (“TL,” 249–50; “WL,” 374). It is an error to  confuse X not just with the subjectivity of the specifi cally human,  but also with the human species as a phenomenal reality. If any  given institution of the subject of rights will be in tension with the  universality of the subject, then this applies not just to the deter- mination of the subject as a particular kind of human, but equally  to its determination as human. A subject of rights that in principle  cannot be seen cannot be seen as human. Of course, ever since the end of the eighteenth century, the sub- ject of rights has within offi cial juridical orders increasingly come  to be seen as human. One could even say that ever since the late  eighteenth century human beings have come to stand to X as the  instituted subject of rights stands to the insurrection against this  institution, in the sense that the human refers to universally recog- nized subjects of rights, whereas X refers to the subject of rights as  an unknown. I do not mean to glibly elide the fact that we do not  live in a world where the rights of human beings are universally  and effectively protected. Indeed, the increasingly universal con- sent human rights have inspired since the middle of the twentieth  century has neither extirpated the delinquency and hypocrisy that  too often characterize efforts to realize them as a living practice  nor curbed the contemporaneous proliferation of rights abuses— in many cases by the very groups that explicitly claim to act in  their name. Flagrant genocides, programs of ethnic cleansing, and  </page> <page sequence="20"> 242 qui parle   spring/summer 2011   vol.19, no.2   violent political repressions should not distract our attention from  the more subtle phenomenon of nation-state governments, special- interest groups, and profi t-seeking organizations co-opting the dis- course of human rights in order to publicly legitimate and mask the  pursuit of agendas that actively produce human rights violations.  Nevertheless, it remains true that human rights discourse recog- nizes human beings at least in principle as the subjects of rights. In  fact, being human is offi cially the sole qualifi cation necessary for  bearing rights: simply by being human, one has rights. This is true  even when the subjects in question are either anthropomorphized  corporations or nonhuman anthropomorphized great apes.27 Yet  such aspirations to become human mask the prior and irreducible  distance between the subject of rights and the specifi cally human.  One could even say that ever since the late eighteenth century hu- man beings have attempted to saturate X with a human form only  to fi nd that they stand to X as the instituted subject of rights stands  to the infi nite insurrection against this institution. Inhuman Rights It is tempting, at this point, to conclude that if what we call human  rights are originarily the rights of the infi nite, then it follows there  is nothing but the anthropomorphic disfi guration of ideology to  prevent us from affi rming that nonhuman entities are subjects of  rights. I think one could make a strong case in this direction. It is  not a logical implication of the idea of human rights. It is, however,  a claim already implicit within the acts by which human rights ma- terialize in the real world. Of course, one could always object that  the subject of rights is obviously only human or that the nonhuman  are obviously rightless. And yet given that our reading of Schlegel  and Balibar has delivered us to an X before the human, one that re- fuses human form, such objections would be burdened with the re- sponsibility of explaining why the equation “X = human” is not an  ideological misrecognition of subjects of rights—why, in Schlegel’s  terms, it is not mistaking persons for things. Such an explanation  also becomes the burden of any position that accepts the unknow- ability of the subject, yet insists that such unknowability is a trait  </page> <page sequence="21"> Hunt: Rights of the Infi nite 243 of specifi cally human beings only. Such an insistence is implicit  within Judith Butler’s statement that “the human comes into being  . . . as that which we have yet to know.”28 While such a statement  understands that humans rights depend upon the indetermination  of the subject of rights, it does not explain why subjects of rights  produced by such indetermination must be human. The more speculative conclusion I wish to draw, however, is  purely formal and, for that reason, perhaps even more consequen- tial for the practical question of whether the nonhuman can be  subjects of rights. I have argued that Schlegel’s and Balibar’s use of  the mark X, at the precise moment they refer to the universality of  the subject of rights, indicates that this subject is in principle not  something we can experience as a positive phenomenal referent.  This is not the same thing as the affi rmative proposition that X  marks an a priori knowledge that the subject of rights is indeter- minate. Rather, X marks critical knowledge about the limits of a  priori knowledge about the subject of rights. X also does not trans- late into a principle, understood as a rule worked out logically in  the abstract and applicable in various contexts. The critical knowl- edge that X marks is dependent on specifi c conditions of its emer- gence from which it cannot be separated. This knowledge emerges  as a critique of knowledge about who the subject of rights is. X is  a compressed fi gure of the radical negative logic of un-knowing  that Schlegel terms “political fi ction.” The history of the rights of  the infi nite is not a progressive improvement in our vision of those  who bear rights; it is a sequence of failures of visions seen, a non- linear series of acts of resistance to established, fi nitizing construc- tions of rights. What I want to stress, however, is that our constitutive inability  to see the subject of rights is an insight that Schlegel, Balibar, and  Arendt remain blind to. For in none of their texts does the aware- ness about the diffi culty in saying for certain that the subject of  rights is human take the form of thematic assertions whether ex- plicit or implicit. This awareness materializes, rather, in the criti- cal form assumed by the account of the errors committed in prior  constructions of human rights. If they vindicate rights that are not  exclusively the rights of human beings, they do so quite against  </page> <page sequence="22"> 244 qui parle   spring/summer 2011   vol.19, no.2   any announced intentions. That these texts perform what they do  not thematize means that the critique of error itself emerges as an  error. In this way blindness becomes an integral part of the insight  about blindness. My fi gures of blindness and insight invoke Paul de Man’s ac- count of reading as an act that produces radically negative knowl- edge. In the question-and-answer session that followed the last of  the Messenger Lectures he delivered at Cornell University in 1983,  de Man calls that aspect of language which exceeds the deliberate  control of human beings “inhuman.” “The inhuman,” he says, “is  not some kind of mystery, or some kind of secret; the inhuman is:  linguistic structures, the play of linguistic tensions, linguistic events  that occur, possibilities which are inherent in language—indepen- dently of any intent or any drive or any wish or any desire we  might have.”29 In response, M. H. Abrams poses a question that he  says represents the “humanistic perspective”: “What can be more  human,” he asks, “than the language which distinguishes human  beings from all other living beings?” (“TT,” 99–100). De Man’s  response is curiously uneven—insistent and politic, pointed and  disorganized, as if he is not quite in control of his language. But  he returns to his motif of an interminable predicament when he  says, “That there is a nonhuman aspect of language is a perennial  awareness from which we cannot escape, because language does  things which are so radically out of our control that they cannot  be assimilated to the human at all, against which one fi ghts con- stantly” (“TT,” 101). What Schlegel, Balibar, and Arendt ultimately deliver us to is  perhaps a way of thinking of rights as oriented not by the human  but rather by the inhuman.30 To acknowledge that the human is  not the genetic origin of rights does not mean claiming that a priori  structures of language determine who are subjects of rights. Rather  it means admitting that declaring, vindicating, claiming, legislating,  enforcing, exercising, losing, and violating rights are acts that, even  as they are situated in historically and culturally specifi c contexts,  are as sheer form, indifferent to the human and the difference it  makes. This disjunction between the human and rights should not  be construed as a theoretical version of the violation of rights. For  </page> <page sequence="23"> Hunt: Rights of the Infi nite 245 it is precisely this inhuman disruption of our control over rights  discourse that allows the infi nite subjects to punish the fi nite for  usurping the former’s rights. The subject of rights is infi nite, we  could say, because the acts by which we claim human rights are  inhuman.31 The performative contradiction between what one is  saying and what one is doing when one claims rights means that  rights claims always miss or exceed their projected mark. Ideology  might easily be able to render a person a thing, but no ideology  can transform the negative universality marked by X that is indif- ferent and incomprehensible to us into a thing we can know. The  question with which we are, thus, faced is not whether to admit the  nonhuman could be a subject of rights. Rather the question is what  are we to make of the fact that the nonhuman is already there in  the process of un-making and re-making human beings as subjects  of rights. Notes An earlier version of this essay was presented at “Pets and Meat,” a  special session of the 2010 North American Society for the Study of  Romanticism conference in Vancouver, BC, organized by Ron Broglio. 1.  The idea that one has rights simply by being born as a human being  is outdone by the so-called personhood bills that have recently been  making their way around legislative bodies of several of the United  States. Typically these bills assert that anything with a human ge- nome, even a single-cell embryo, possesses the rights of a human be- ing. Hence, one is not born with rights, but pre-born with rights.  Insofar as these bills merely extend the biologistic logic that animates  international human rights law, they can quite legitimately be read in  the way the organizational sponsor, Personhood USA, a grassroots  Christian organization, intends them, namely, as a project to protect  human rights. “What Is Personhood?” Personhood USA, April 24,  2009, www.personhoodusa.com. 2.

Hannah Arendt, “‘The Rights of Man’: What Are They?” Modern Re- view 3, no. 1 (1949): 37. Hereafter cited as “RM.” This is the consen- sus among recent book-length studies of Arendt’s conception of rights  by Seyla Benhabib, Peg Birmingham, and Serena Parekh. It is worth  noting that Arendt revised this identifi cation of the right to have rights  and the one human right out of the fi nal edition of The Origins of To- talitarianism. It appears only in the fi rst edition and in an essay from  1949 in which she fi rst formulates the account of human rights that  would appear two years later in the book on totalitarianism. Chris- toph Menke points out that the English and German versions of this  essay, published nearly simultaneously, bear two quite different titles.  Compared to the cautious, even skeptical title of the English version,  “‘The Rights of Man’: What Are They?” the title of the German ver- sion, “There Is Only One Human Right” (“Es gibt nur ein eniziges  Menschenrecht”), is rather affi rmative (see Menke, “The ‘Aporias of  Human Rights’ and the ‘One Human Right’: Regarding the Coher- ence of Hannah Arendt’s Argument,” in Hannah Arendt’s Centenary:  Political and Philosophical Perspectives, Part One, ed. Arien Mack,  special issue of Social Research 74, no. 3 [2007]: 739–62, 741). The  entire problem of understanding Arendt’s position on human rights is  contained within the distance that unites these two titles to the same  essay. Similarly, Judith Butler says that the two halves of the ninth  chapter of The Origins of Totalitarianism adopt different voices: the  fi rst is “sardonic, skeptical, disillusioned,” whereas the second enters  a “declarative mode” the result of which is that Arendt “redeclares  the rights of man” (Judith Butler and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak,  Who Sings the Nation-State? Language, Politics, Belonging [London:  Seagull Books, 2007], 47). As a question of voice, Butler’s reading is  spot-on. However, I am not so sure that the two gestures of the chap- ter can be separated so neatly as to allow for a dialectical resurrection  of the human as the bearer of the right to have rights. 5.  While here Arendt presents the right to have rights alongside the right  to belong to a political community, and thus seems to imply that they  are two separate rights, elsewhere she defi nes the fi rst right as the sec- ond. The right to have rights, she says, is “the right of every human  being to membership in a political community” (“RM,” 34). </page> <page sequence="25"> Hunt: Rights of the Infi nite 247 6.  To clarify: I am arguing that an originary disjunction between the  condition of those who claim rights and the successful exercise of  rights conditions the practical articulation of rights. You don’t claim  what you already have or even what you are capable of claiming.  Actually reading, rather than ignoring, this disjunction between the  subject and rights would be one way to begin to theorize the rights  of the animal, including what Judith Butler calls the “human animal”  (Frames of War: When Is Life Grievable? [London: Verso, 2009], 19).  I take up this issue in an article titled “The Right to Have Rights”  in a special issue of New Centennial Review on “Animals . . . in  Theory” edited by David Clark (forthcoming 2011). The present es- say explores a corresponding issue at the other end of the practical  process of enacting rights, namely, why rights claims endlessly renew  this originary disjunction. 7.  Famous assertions of this genealogy have been made by Thomas  Mann and Georg Lukács. Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc  Nancy, authors of a major study of early German romanticism, offer  a compelling version in their essay “The Nazi Myth,” trans.

Beiser’s comprehensive study of the politics of early Ger- man romanticism, Enlightenment, Revolution, Romanticism: The  Genesis of Modern German Political Thought, 1790–1800 (Lon- don: Harvard University Press, 1992), pays little attention to human  rights. 9.

The term “the capacity to acquire  rights” (“die Möglichkeit sich Rechte zu erwerben”), which Fichte dis- cusses in the last text (333; 318), deserves to be read closely alongside  Arendt’s “the right to have rights” (“das Recht, Recht zu haben”). 11.  Maurice Blanchot’s characterization of Schlegel’s conservative turn is  classic: “as a young man he is an atheist, a radical, and an individual- ist. . . . Some years pass: the same Schlegel, converted to Catholicism,  a diplomat and journalist in the service of Metternich, surrounded by  monks and pious men of society, is no longer anything but a fat philis- tine of unctuous speech, lazy, empty, his mind on food, and incapable  of remembering the young man who had written: ‘A single absolute  law: the free spirit always triumphs over nature.’” However, Blan- chot immediately asks, “Which is the real one? Is the later Schlegel  the truth of the fi rst?” It’s not always appreciated that the questions  are the crucial point for Blanchot. It is the distance between Schle- gel’s early radicalism and his conservative turn that allegorizes a “new  mode of accomplishment . . . : the work’s power to be and no longer  to represent; to be everything, but without a content that is almost  indifferent, and thus at the same time affi rming the absolute and the  fragmentary; affi rming totality, but in a form that, being all forms— that is, at the limit, being none at all—does not realize the whole, but  signifi es it by suspending it, even breaking it.” Blanchot, “The Ath- enaeum,” in The Infi nite Conversation, trans.

Insofar as Schlegel’s X lies beyond all cognition, even to the extent  that we cannot know that it exists, let alone anything about it, it  bears some resemblance with the X Kant uses in his discussion of the  transcendental object in his Critique of Pure Reason. For an excellent  discussion of Kant’s X, see Geoffrey Bennington, “X,” in Interrupting  Derrida (London: Routledge, 2000), 76–92. </page> <page sequence="28"> 250 qui parle   spring/summer 2011   vol.19, no.2   22.  A recent observation by a friend about the American platitude that  anyone can be president neatly captures the difference between any- thing and everything. Maybe anyone can be president, he said, but  that doesn’t mean everyone can be. 23.  Étienne Balibar, “Citizen Subject,” trans. James B. Swenson Jr., in  Who Comes after the Subject? ed.

The fusion of the ontological (being human) and the political (bear- ing rights) is explicit whenever the basic idea of human rights fi nds  formulation. For example, consider the following statements: “Hu- man rights are rights held by individuals simply because they are part  of the human species” (HHR, 3). “Human Rights are rights which  a person enjoys by virtue of being human, without any supplemen- tary condition being required” (Christian Tomuschat, Human Rights:  Between Idealism and Realism [Oxford: Oxford University Press,  2003], 3). “[T]he present call for human rights presupposes the idea  of a human nature or essence and makes this idea the foundation of  juridical values” (Luc Ferry and Alain Renaut, “How to Think about  Human Right?” in New French Thought, ed. Mark Lilla [Princeton:  Princeton University Press, 1994], 168).

My understanding of the source of the inhuman differs from that of  Lyotard, but I agree with his characterization of the inhuman as an  unpresentable excess above existing constructions of rights. I even  agree that it is “the very foundation of human rights” (Jean-François  Lyotard, Postmodern Fables, trans. Georges Van Den Abeele [Minne- apolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1997], 116). However, unlike  Lyotard, I am not convinced that it is the foundation of the rights of  only beings who are human. 31.  To say that the infi nitude of rights is ensured by their inhuman condi- tions of emergence is not to say that we can control rights by interven- ing in the inhuman. In an essay that on one page uses the fi gures of  “a leap of faith” and “X,” Rei Terada explains why such a politically  progressive hope is not theoretically progressive.
