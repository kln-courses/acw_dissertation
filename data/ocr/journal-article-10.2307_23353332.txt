<plain_text><page sequence="1">Empedocles on Divine Nature1 Résumé. — L'objet de cet article est d'examiner l'ensemble des entités qui sont appe lées divines dans le poème philosophique d'Empédocle (à savoir les racines, les puis sances, les dieux à longue vie, les daimones, la Sphère et l'esprit saint). Il s'agit de se demander si ces entités aboutissent à une vision consistante de la divinité. On examine aussi la dialectique de la mortalité et de l'immortalité présente dans la pensée d'Empé docle. Dans la mesure où la moindre chose, y compris les vivants les plus instables, sont issus des principes divins, il y a un sens à dire que, dans le cosmos d'Empédocle, toutes les choses composées sont considérées comme étant divines. Mais en un autre sens, seules les structures hautement intégrées méritent d'être considérées en tant que dieux. On montre que souffrir comme un mortel revient à vivre une vie fragmentée continuellement menacée par le spectre de la mort. Au contraire, mener une vie de dieu revient à vivre au sens plein, sans être tourmenté par le terme éventuel d'une existence heureuse. En conclu sion, on établit que deux orientations distinctes de la poésie grecque et de la philosophie semblent avoir rivalisé dans l'interprétation qu 'Empédocle se faisait des dieux. Abstract. — The paper examines all the entities that are said to be divine in Empedocles' philosophical poetry (i.e. roots, forces, long-lived gods, daemons, the Sphere and the holy mind), and raises the question of whether or not they form a rather consistent view of what it is for something to be a god. The paper also examines the dialectics of mortality and immortality in Empedocles ' thought. Since everything whatso ever, including the most unstable living beings, stemmed from divine principles there is a sense in which all composite things were regarded as divine in Empedocles' cosmos. But there is another sense in which only highly integrated structures were considered to be gods. To suffer as a mortal, it is argued, was to live a fragmented life continuously threatened by the prospect of death. Contrariwise, to lead a divine life was to live in wholeness, not at all worried by the eventual termination of such a blessed existence. In conclusion it is argued that two distinct trends of early Greek poetry and philosophy seem to have vied for supremacy in Empedocles ' understanding of godhead. 1. I wish to wholeheartedly thank Jean-Claude Picot and Stavros Kouloumentas for attentively reading an earlier draft of this paper, detecting omissions, raising pertinent objections, and saving me from errors. For those that remain I am fully responsible. My thanks should also go to Constantin Macris for an inspiring discussion, oral comments, and much more. All three have generously offered me invaluable help for which I am grateful. Last but not least, I would like to thank Anne Gabrièle Wersinger, the editor of the papers on Empedocles published in this volume, for the invitation and our impeccable collaboration.

I. SUBJECT, AIM AND METHOD Several entities in Empedocles' philosophical poetry are characterized in ways that make the reader think of them as divine. The most prominent of them are (i) the four elements, (ii) the two motive forces, (iii) the Sphere or Sphairos (B28-29), and (iv) the holy mind of fragment B134.2 Besides them, we also hear (v) of the Muse that is called upon to inspire the poet (B3.3, B4.2, B131), (vi) of "gods" (B3.1, B21.12, B23.8, B115.1, B131.4, B132.2, B146.3, cf. B 147.1) and "blessed ones" (B 115.6) in the plural, (vii) of couples of opposite personifications said by Plutarch to be the "twofold moirai and daimones" who take hold of us at birth (B122 quoted in Tranq. anim. 474b; cf. B123 quoted by Cornutus in Epidr. 17, p. 30 Lang), and (viii) of transmigrating daimones, again in the plural (B115.5, cf. B147).3 Empedocles famously claimed to be one of those daemons in a state of exile (B 115.13). He also claimed to be honoured as a god by his compatriots in Acragas (B 112.4-6, cf. B23.ll). And the question immediately arises: What is the divine in Empedocles' philosophical poetry? Did Empedocles have a coherent idea of what it means for something to be a god or daemon, or did he use those characterizations rather loosely without ever seriously considering in what respects the entities intended might belong to a common class?4 My hypothesis is that Empedocles was indeed consistent on the subject of the divine, and my aim is to test such a hypothesis against the available evidence of Empedocles' extant fragments. I personally trust those ancient authors who testify to the existence of two separate poems. However, I shall use the evidence provi ded by the surviving fragments rather indiscriminately, first because, with the 2.

I use double quotes ("...") to signal quotations from Empedocles and other authors, single ones ('...') for all other purposes and primarily in order to indicate the linguistic sense, rather than the extra-linguistic reference, of a word or phrase. I owe a great deal to O'Brien's and Primavesi's publications. The present paper may be considered a kind of response to Primavesi (2006b) and (2008b). 3.

Empedocles had no standard ways of referring to the principles of his physi cal system. He could use the name of Zeus now to denote elemental fire (B6.1) and then to allude to the reign of Strife (B 128.2) or even to the visible world as opposed to the underworld (B142). He could also refer to elemental fire by the name of Hephaestus (B96.3, B98.2), and use the designations of 'sea' (0á\ctaaa, ttôvtoç) and 'rainfall' (ó|ippo&lt;;) for elemental or even visible water.6 The consis tency we are looking for is a consistency of philosophical doctrine rather than poetic expression. II. IMMORTAL AND LONG-LIVED GODS: COSMIC PRINCIPLES, TRADITIONAL DEITIES, AND INVENTED PERSONIFICATIONS Empedocles seems to have made a sharp distinction between entities that are, strictly speaking, "immortal" and other entities that are "long-lived".7 The former group consists solely of the four roots or (more commonly) elements — I do not assume any semantic difference between the two terms — and of the two forces whose continual struggle for domination produces alternate phases of unification and separation of the elements. (In what follows I shall use the term 'principles' to collectively refer to elements and forces.) The Sphere and the eponymous or anonymous gods and daemons that populate Empedocles' universe (including the Muse Kalliopeia of B131.3) belong to the latter group. Although in the extant fragments the Sphere is nowhere called 'long-lived', Empedocles clearly concei ved him as a temporally finite god (B31). In a general sense, all members of both groups are divine. But the members of each group are divine for a different reason. The principles are divine because they are ungenerated and indestructible. On the contrary, gods, daemons, and the 5. Wright (1995) 151, fr. 152. B153 is not a fragment but, rather, a testimony. 6. B21.5, B22.2, B27.2, B38.3, B73.1, B98.2, BIOO.12,18, B115.9-10.

In B21.9-14 and B23.5-8 "long-lived gods, highest in honour" are mentioned together with trees, men, women, beasts, birds and fish as entities that have sprung (è(3A.àaTqoe) from the roots. In a still enchanted world (to use Weber's famous phrase) it was normal for people to sense deities around and to place them side by side with plants and animals as indisputable members of the universe. Though not necessarily identical with the traditional deities of the Greek pantheon, Empedocles' "long-lived gods highest in honour" owe a great deal to the collective imagination of the Greeks as crystallized in myth and cult. Long-lived gods were for Empedocles specific living structures made up of the four elements. But instead of claiming, as Homer and Hesiod did, that gods are born immortal, Empedocles thought of them as perishable entities, presumably because he realized that only what has no beginning in time may have no temporal end. Moreover, Empedocles' conception of the cyclical alternation of phases of total unity and phases of total separation of the elements in the uni verse precluded any compound entities, including the Sphere, from being truly immortal. Immortal were only the principles of Empedocles' system because they were simple. We need not, however, assume that all long-lived gods were meant to die with the advent of the absolute rule of Love or the absolute rule of Strife. If their life-span was deemed longer than that of any other known crea ture, this need not mean that they came into being with the gradual advent of Love or Strife and will pass away when Love or Strife achieves indisputable predominance over the opposite force.9 After all, experience shows that plants, animals and humans die before the total supremacy of either force in the uni verse at large. Empedocles seems to have perceived a microcosmic reflection of the cosmic cycle to be operative in the generation, maturation, decay and death of individual living beings (B20=ensemble c of P.Strasb.-Physika 301-308; cf. B26.5-7). If so, he will have imagined gods to perish when their life-span comes to an end. Long-lived gods belong to the category of mortal things (0vr]TCt). But of all perishable things gods are explicitly said to be the most honourable. It is reaso nable to assume that their high honour was in Empedocles' mind causally related 8. That the Sphere comes into being and passes away is evident from Empedocles' acceptance of a cosmic cycle with alternate phases of total unification and total segregation of the elements. That gods and daemons perish is evident from the ascription of longevity, as opposed to everlastingness, to them. That gods come into being is made clear from B21.9-14 and B23.5-8. 9. I accept O'Brien's (1969) 2, 189-236 reconstruction of Empedocles' cycle (with four phases and two cosmogonies) rather than the rival interpretation put forward by Bollack (1965-1969) 1.97 124.</page><page sequence="5">Empedocles on Divine Nature 319 to their long lives, although we cannot be sure whether longevity was deemed the effect or the cause of their high honour. So far I have assumed that principles were divine in Empedocles' poetry. To substantiate that claim some argument is needed. For Empedocles never calls them explicitly gods. As for elements, the argument is rather easy and straightfor ward. In B6 (cf. B96 and B98) each of the four roots is mentioned with the name of a traditional god. Already in antiquity there was some dispute about the exact correspondence between traditional names and elements (A33), and the dispute has continued well to the present date.10 Some claimed that Hera stands for air and Aidoneus (=Hades) for earth while others thought the reverse. But it was clear that Zeus and Nestis (probably a Sicilian goddess akin to Persephone11) represent fire12 and water,13 respectively, and that each root was named after a traditional (panhellenic or local) deity because of some affinity between the mythological and cultic function of the deity in question and the character of the root it represents. Zeus, for instance, the god of the thunderbolt who dwelled on mountain peaks and the vault of the sky, pointed to heavenly brightness, and so could become a symbol of elemental fire. By calling the roots after the names of traditional deities Empedocles must have assumed not only that the roots are divine14 but also that they are more divine than the (to his mind perishable) gods of traditional cult. In this respect, the arrangement of the roots in two couples well-known from traditional mythology (Zeus-Hera, Aidoneus-Nestis = Hades Persephone) should be significant. When we come to the motive forces we find straightforward evidence for the divinity only of Love. Strife is nowhere explicitly mentioned as a deity nor called by the name of a traditional god. Such a silence may be telling (although B59, B128 and B 122.3 do provide allusions to Strife's divine status). By contrast, in many fragments Aphrodite, Cypris and even Harmonía are names for Love (OiXóTqc;, Zropyii), which clearly implies that Love is a divinity.15 Empedocles 10. Cf. Kingsley (1996) 15-48; Picot (2000) 41-82. 11. Kingsley (1996) 348-356; Picot (2008). 12. Although the roots were explicitly said to be equal with one another and of the same age (B17.27), in the identification of fire with Zeus the king (cf. B128.2) we may find implicit confirmation of Aristotle's view (Met. A.4, 985a33-b3, GC II.3, 330M9-21 = A36-37; cf. A31) according to which Empedocles accorded to fire a more prominent role than to each of the other three elements. 13. The unattested Nestis clearly stands for water since she is she "who moistens with tears the mortal spring" (B6.3). 14. Cf. Arist.

But no mortal, he continues (25-26), has understood her as a power "swinging among" the elements. Empedocles' task was to show the truly cosmic force that stood behind the traditional cult of a particular goddess. Rather than seeking to subvert traditional piety, Empedocles wanted to disclose the real philosophical foundations behind Aphrodite's popular cult. In B128 Empedocles spoke of an unspecified earlier time, apparently similar to the golden age of traditional mythology, when Cypris was queen of the uni verse and worshipped as such by humans. Her cult, we learn, was bloodless because those early people, presumably closer to the ethical message of Empedo clean vegetarianism, understood that "it was a great defilement to bereave ani mals of life and eat their parts" (B128.9-10) as was the custom of sacrificial practice throughout mainstream Greek religion. Empedocles claimed that there was "neither Ares as god nor Kydoimos (=Tumult), neither king Zeus nor Kronos or Poseidon" during that peaceful reign of Aphrodite. The aforementioned names of traditional male gods seem to stand for aspects or particular manifestations of Strife. But since the fragment assumes the existence of many particular things including individual men who "propitiated Aphrodite with pious statues and painted animal figures, with perfumes of subtle fragrance and offerings of distil led myrrh and sweet-smelling frankincense, and pouring on the earth libations of golden honey" (B 128.4-7), the fragment cannot possibly refer to the absolute reign of Love when no particular entities exist in the uniform body of the Sphere. The fragment as a whole must, then, refer to a cosmic phase when Strife has not yet begun to gain, or has already lost, sufficient influence in the universe. And if the present state of the world is, on the most plausible reconstruction of Empedocles' cosmic cycle, a phase of ascending Strife, it follows that B128 refers to a past period when Strife had less influence on the world than it has today (cf. B130). B128 is quoted by Porphyry who explicitly draws on Theophrastus (De abst. 11.20-21). Porphyry introduces the fragment by saying that Empedocles, "while dealing with the theogony, also displays, along with it, the sacrificial offerings, saying...".16 Since gods were entities of the natural world in Empedocles' sys tem, as B.21.9-14 and B23.5-8 suggest, an account of their origin could find a 16.

According to it, the Kai is emphatic rather than copulative, and Empedocles is not credited with a (quite implausible) discourse on sacrificial offerings on an equal footing with his discourse on the origin of gods.</page><page sequence="7">Empedocles on Divine Nature 321 natural place in the Physika. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Empedocles included in his cosmogony, except for a zoogony, also a theo gony17 in which gods were analysed as particular configurations of the four elements — like everything else. While Hesiod had composed a theogony in which the present state of the divine world was explained by means of the familiar notions of natural birth from pre-existing parents and family struggles for domination, Empedocles composed a more philosophical theogony in which (in Aristotelian terminology) the material constituents of long-lived gods were the roots and their efficient cause the power of Love in its struggle with Strife. The reign of Cypris was not meant as a period of primordial monotheism. The exact opposition of "king Zeus" (B 128.2), who was traditionally king and 'father' of other deities as well as men (ncmip àvôpûv re Gewv te), to "queen Cypris" (B 128.3) implies that other divinities, besides the great goddess of Love, were acknowledged by those primordial people. We may think of the divine persons that formed the entourage of the goddess of love in traditional mythology (such as Himeros, Eros, Persuasion, and Harmony)18 as being the gods and goddesses of that distant era. We may also assume, more controversially, that Ares, Kydoimos, and the other warrior-gods were not worshipped in that distant period of powerful Love because they had not yet come into being. In B122 Empedocles mentions some female deities of his own poetic creation. They are arranged in pairs of opposites. "She-of-the-earth" is contrasted with the "far-seeing She-of-the-sun", "bloody Discord" with "Harmony of solemn aspect", the "Beautiful one" with the "Ugly one", the "Speedy one" with the "Slow one", and "lovely Faultlessness" with "Obscurity of black harvest19". Plutarch who quotes the fragment (Tranq. an. 474b) informs us that they are the "fates and daemons who take hold of, and rule, each one of us at the time of birth". These divine personifications obviously mean to indicate the contrary powers to which we are subject in present life. The second pair, in particular, clearly represents Strife and Love. And since in Empedocles' physical doctrine all oppo sition ultimate stems from the fundamental contrariety between the two strug gling forces we may assume that the other pairs were considered to be so many specific manifestations of the two forces as they mingle with the elements. The Beautiful One, for instance, would be the unifying power of Love, and the Ugly One the disintegrating influence of Strife, in so far as each relates to physical 17. Cf. Guthrie (1965) 255; Kahn (1993) 432. 18. Hes. Theog. 201-206; P.Derv. col. XXI. 19. I read with Plutarch ^EXcryicapnoc; rather than neXcryKoupoc; ('black-eyed', i.e. 'with sightless pupils' = 'blind' according to Mullach, or 'black-haired' according to Wilamowitz) with Tzetzes (app. crit. in Diels et Kranz (1951) 1.361; Wright (1995) 281.</page><page sequence="8">322 Spyridon Rangos appearance. Similarly, Faultlessness qualified as "lovely" (èpôeoaa) would be the outcome of Love's strong presence in the mixture of the blood around the heart where thought resides (B106), and Obscurity characterized by the 'bad fruits' it produces would be the outcome of Strife's aggressive presence in the heart-blood of congenitally dull people or during sickness and old age. If we accept that the Sphere is motionless as long as Love reigns supreme while the speed of the roots' movement increases with the gradual advent of Strife and reaches its culmination when Strife arranges the elements in four concentric layers,20 we may infer that motion and (high) speed are products of Strife whe reas rest and slowness products of Love. With the first pair of opposites it is less clear how it relates to the motive forces. But once we notice that She-of-the-sun is qualified as "far-seeing", the opposition turns out to be between clear percep tion, on the one hand, and senselessness, on the other, outcomes of Love and Strife, respectively. The divinity of all those personifications must have been a way for Empedocles to indicate the pervasive and multifaceted influence of Love and Strife in our world.21 In earlier and later stages of the cosmic cycle, we may assume, one member of each pair passes away simultaneously with the retreat of the cosmic force which has brought it about. Quite generally, then, the long-lived deities that are present at any time in the circular evolution of the universe are a sure indication of the relative influence of Love and Strife at that time. III. SPECIAL CASES OF GODHEAD : THE SPHAIROS AND THE HOLY MIND Apart from roots and forces we hear also of the Sphere (Ztpctipoç) as a god. B31 speaks of a god's limbs as beginning to tremble, and the reference can only be to the Sphere when it starts dissolving under the influence of raising Strife. Since the Sphere comes into being with the absolute rule of Love and passes away after a certain period of time,22 the ascription of divinity to him cannot be for the same reasons as the ascription of divinity to the principles. During the period of his life, the Sphere rejoices in circumambient aloneness and rest 20. O'Brien (1969) 46-54. 21. A similar argument can be developed in the case of the opposites of B123 (which, however, are not explicitly mentioned as goddesses). 22. According to the most plausible interpretation of the highly abbreviated Byzantine scholia (Rashed (2001), Primavesi (2006a)), the life-span of the Sphere amounts to one fifth of the whole cosmic cycle (Primavesi (2006b) 59; Primavesi (2008a) 19; Primavesi (2008b) 255), while, according to O'Brien's reconstruction, to half of it (O'Brien 1969: 1, 57). The Byzantine scholia need not reflect genuine Empedoclean views.</page><page sequence="9">Empedocles on Divine Nature 323 (B27.4, B28.2) — both senses are present in Greek |iovir|.23 The ascription of divinity to him, therefore, is meant to indicate the Sphere's self-sufficiency and bliss as results of its wholeness. For of all compound beings in Empedocles' philosophy, including blessed and long-lived individual gods, the Sphere alone is truly all one. In this respect the Sphere is the prototype of all integrated beings. Since no amount of Strife is present in it to cause a distinction of one part from another the Sphere has no parts as long as it endures. Furthermore, the Sphere's ignorance of Strife, of which Aristotle complained,24 was meant to perfect his well-being. For since it is a universal law in Empedocles' system that like is known be like (B109), the most blessed things should be the most ignorant of disruptive forces as well. In the primordial time of B128 people knew and wor shipped no manifestation of Strife and were, presumably, happier than the pre sent generation of men who venerate Ares and Kydoimos. A puzzling divine entity in Empedocles' surviving verses is the "holy and tremendous25 mind" ((ppí)v iepf) kcù àOéacpatoc;) of B134. Because the description of the holy mind closely resembles that of the Sphere (B134.2-3 = B29.1-2),26 one might be tempted to equate the holy mind with the Sphere, as it has been done time and again. But the equation is refuted by the last line of B134 where Empedocles speaks of "swift caring-thoughts" (cppovTiai Gorjaiv) which the holy mind "darts through the whole cosmos" (kóctjiov anavta KaTataaouaa). The activity of the holy mind is here presented as an extroverted mental and emotional care. For unlike other terms denoting 'intelligence' and 'thought' (such as vót]|ia, 9póvr|cn&lt;;, etc.), cppovTic; is a word with strong emotional undertones27 and should be translated as 'worry', 'concern', 'caring thought', or 'attentive care' (cf. B131.2). Such an emotional-cum-rational care/concern on the part of the holy mind implies the existence of an entire ordered structure (kóg[k&gt;&lt;; ànaq) as some thing distinct from the holy mind itself.28 Therefore, the holy mind is not one and 23. O'Brien (2010). 24. Met. B4, 1000b3-5 ; An. 1.5, 410b4-6. 25. The usual translation of à0É0&lt;paToc; is, in accordance with its etymology, 'unspeakable', "unutterable', 'inexpressible', 'ineffable'. But Picot (forthcoming) has shown that the word, as actually used in ancient literature, means 'huge', 'enormous', 'immense', 'vast', i.e. it has a quantitative rather than a qualitative sense. I have tried to combine the two senses by opting for 'tremendous'. 26. The differences between the two fragments are: the presence in B134, (i) of the particle ^èv instead of the explicative yáp, (ii) of ànai instead of ánó, and (iii) of Xaxvr|£VTa instead of Y£wr|£VTa. Zuntz (1971) 216, 250 accepts cmíGea Xaxviievxa instead of (ir^ta Xaxviievta in B134.3. Wright (1995) 131, 253-254 obelizes the whole line B134.2. 27. Cf.

In the only other fragment where the word KÓa|io&lt;; is used, i.e. B26.5, the term (qualified by the numerical 'one') means not 'world' but an individual 'ordered structure' such as an individual human being or an individual animal. That the verse in question does not refer to the state of the</page><page sequence="10">324 Spyridon Rangos the same with the Sphere; still, the conspicuous similarity between the two des criptions stares us in the face. Both the holy mind and the Sphere are said to possess neither limbs nor geni tals. This obviously means that they should not be imagined in anthropomorphic or theriomorphic terms nor as having sexual appetites. The popular representation of gods in traditional mythology and iconography is thus rejected. Since the Sphere is a blessed god because of its wholeness which is a consequence of the absence of Strife, we may assume, given its similarity to the holy mind, that the holy mind is holy and tremendous because it is not defiled by Strife either. Ammonius who quotes the fragment says that Empedocles referred specifi cally to Apollo since that was the immediate subject of his discourse.29 Ammonius assumes that what Empedocles said of Apollo applies more gene rally to Empedocles' conception of the divine as a whole. We do not know whether Ammonius made the generalization himself or inferred it from the context of Empedocles' verses. But Tzetzes is more precise when he introduces the two last lines of the fragment with the words: "In the third book of the Physika Empedocles, while showing what is the essence of the divine, says verbatim the following...".30 Since a copy of Empedocles' Physika was avai lable in Byzantium,31 we can be relatively sure, against the authority of Diels, that the fragment stemmed indeed from the third book of the Physika 32 and that Empedocles intended those verses as a general description of divinity. In other words, what Empedocles said of Apollo was meant equally to apply to all other gods, at least those of a similar kind. Since the subject of B134, whether Apollo or the Sphere, is not an immortal principle but rather a temporally finite god. Sphere is indicated by line B26.7 in which the unity of all extant stuff, i.e. the state of the Sphere, is the end product (eíoókev) of the partial mixture and separation of the elements that was going on in the previous lines where Love was assumed to be gradually gaining influence in the universe. In B134 the word kóct|ío&lt;; is qualified by the adjective cmaç ('entire'). This qualification implies the existence either of just one ordered structure permeated throughout by the caring-thoughts of the holy mind or of numerous such structures collectively understood. In view of B26.5 the latter option seems preferable. Moreover, if Koajioq áitai; referred to the very body of the Sphere, the holy mind would be made to think of, and care for, its own well-being, an option which, though not absurd in itself, is not supported by the overall tone of the fragment (cf. Bollack (2003) 95-96). 29.

'</page><page sequence="11">Empedocles on Divine Nature 325 what Empedocles said of him would equally apply, to all other "long-lived gods, highest in honour". It would then follow that for Empedocles the "long-lived gods, highest in honour" were essentially minds whose caring-thoughts exten ded to the entire structured universe. Mythologically Apollo was a notorious killer. But in cult and ritual practice he was addressed as the god of healing, purification, prophesy and music, which were all domains very intimately connected to Empedocles' own concerns. It seems that Empedocles either disregarded Apollo's traditional association with blood shedding or approached it allegorically rather than literally. The famous Indian mystic Ramakrishna Paramhansa (1836-86) is reported to have said that Kali, the terrible mother goddess of Hinduism, appears black as long as she is viewed from a distance: when embraced in the soul of her devotee she is shown to be warm and loving. Empedocles may have entertained a similar view about Apollo who was also the favourite god of the Pythagoreans. We know that Empedocles was accu sed of breaking the Pythagorean oath of silence and of vulgarizing Pythagorean doctrines.33 Since he is also reported to have composed a hymn to this god34 we may suppose that Apollo had a particular significance for him. The hymn was supposedly destroyed immediately after Empedocles' death by his sister or daugh ter. In it, we learn (A23), Empedocles identified Apollo with the sun in a kind of natural allegory. Even if this hymn was destroyed, it is not unreasonable to sup pose that an approximation of Apollo to the sun would have stood in the back ground of, or have found a place in, Empedocles' major poetic composition. This should have occurred in the third book of the Physika where B134 belonged. The identification of Apollo with the sun as the greatest of gods is ascribed to Orpheus in Aeschylus' lost play Bassarai or Bassarides,35 a tragedy that, like the rest of the tetralogy to which it belonged (Lykourgeia), dramatized the story of Dionysus from a decidedly Orphic perspective. It seems that the approxima tion of Apollo to, or his identification with, the sun was an idea thriving in Orphic and Pythagorean circles to whom Empedocles was clearly indebted for the doc trine of transmigration. One of the obvious features of the sun is that it is all-round ; another that its rays reach the earth from a great distance and have a beneficial effect on plants and animals. The sun was considered to play a major role in the preservation of the cosmic order in as divergent authors as Heraclitus, Alcmaeon, the Derveni author, Plato and Aristotle.36 Some of those authors regarded the sun as the 33.

From Herodotus we also learn that the sun was a symbol of cosmic order in the imagi nation of everyday people.37 If Empedocles, who is known to have shown an interest in the sun in his cosmological poem,38 identified Apollo with the sun,39 all those features of the latter would be transferred to the former. What is more, the divinity of B134, which possesses neither limbs nor genitals and seems to be all-round in shape and a holy mind in essence, would be enriched with a visual image from our sense experience. However, we should hesitate before we reach the conclusion that Empedocles' supposed identification of Apollo with the sun amounted to a total identity of the two. It seems preferable to think that the sun provided Empedocles with a visible object which could be used as a symbol for invisible Apollo. For in B133 Empedocles claims that the divine is imperceptible by the senses. Now, if what Empedocles said of Apollo was meant to apply to all other long-lived gods, it would follow that, besides being minds, long-lived gods were spherical and benevolent beings like the sun. (We shall qualify this claim in the following section.) IV. MYSTERIOUS DAEMONS AND BLESSED GODS In archaic poetry 'daemon' was either a synonym for 'god', especially in situations where the identity of the deity involved could not be determined, or a generic term for 'divinity' quite indiscriminately.40 Later, in Plato for instance (Symp. 202d-203a), 'daemon' becomes the name of higher-than-human powers that lie in-between the mortal and the divine realms. The Platonic meaning of the term seems to owe quite a lot to Pythagorean doctrine.41 But Empedocles' system has no room for such intermediary entities. In two fragments (B21.9-12, B23.5-8) "gods highest in honour", but no daemons, are mentioned side by side with men, women, trees and animals, and in another (B146) the gods represent the highest level in the scale of daemonic reincarnations. It seems safe to Alcmaeon ("et ideo dicit Alcmaeon quod terra mater est plantarum et sol pater"), Plato and Aristotle the sun was regarded as an ultimate cause of the generation and nutrition of plants and animals. I owe Alcmaeon's reference to Stavros Kouloumentas. 37. Herod. VIII. 143.2. 38. A56; cf. Kingsley (1994). 39. The case is argued forcefully by Picot (forthcoming); cf. Stamatellos (2005) 37-38. 40. The obvious exception to this rule seems to be provided by Hesiod's men of golden race who became Saí|iovei; (O.D. 122) after death. But those men, while still alive, already "lived like gods" (ofcrre 0Eot Ô' £(iuov cu&lt;r|ôéa 0u|iôv êxovteî;, O.D. 112), so that their post-mortem daemonic status does not necessarily mean that they became something less than full-blown gods with a particular function. In O.D. 314 the word Saipcuv retains the common (in archaic poetry) sense of 'god'. 41. Cf. Detienne (1963); Kerferd (1965).</page><page sequence="13">Empedocles on Divine Nature 327 conclude that for Empedocles gods stood immediately above the human level of being. In line with earlier poetic usage, Empedocles did not always sharply distin guish between 'gods' and 'daemons'. B59 obviously refers either to the roots or (less probably) to the forces but, in any case, to some immortal principles, and calls them "daemons".42 In B115.5, by contrast, which stems from the fragment that is our primary evidence for Empedoclean transmigration and the daemonic cycle, the daemons are said to have been appointed a "long-lasting life" (|iaKpaío)vo(; \e\áxaai (3ioio), a qualification which, in a different form (ôoXi Xaiœvec;), is normally used for "gods highest in honour" (B21.12 ; B23.8). What is more, in B147 Empedocles spoke of "immortals" in the poetically standard way to mean 'gods' (rather than 'imperishable principles') and stated that "with the other immortals they [=the deamons43] share hearth and table, having no part in human misery". Such an implicit identification of daemons with gods implies one of the following two ideas: either the daemons reassume their divine status at the end of their wandering period or they never lost it during their successive reincarnations. We shall see that the first option is preferable. Empedocles' physical doctrine leaves no room for transmigrating entities unless they are somehow constituted by the elements. Although many scho larly suggestions have been made (some more plausible than others), the daemon's material constitution remains a mystery and his relation to the principles of Empedocles' physical doctrine cannot be determined on the available evidence. However, the doctrine of reincarnation was, no doubt, present in the Physika.44 Apparently, Empedocles conceived a parallelism between the cosmic and the daemonic cycles somewhat along the following lines:45 1. Full reign of Love — the daemon is in the community of blessed gods in the Sphere blissful state - primary wholeness 2. Disruption of the Sphere by Strife — the daemon commits the crime of bloodshed/peijury the daemon is sentenced to exile 42. O'Brien (1969) 323-336 adopts, and argues extensively for, Cornford's suggestion according to which they are "fragmentations of Love imprisoned in mortal bodies". If he is right, Empedocles' terminology was stricter than I have assumed. 43. The word is not mentioned in the fragment but is the obvious subject of the participle eóvtei;. 44.

Ascending rule of Strife -— the daemon is in exile descending series of incarnations mortal pain gradually increased 4. Full reign of Strife in the Roots — the daemon is in exile wretched state - ultimate fragmentariness 5. Ascending rule of Love — the daemon is in exile ascending series of incarnations mortal pain gradually decreased 6. Restoration of the Sphere — the daemon returns to the community of gods The evidence for the daemonic cycle is mainly provided by B115 which most probably came from the Purifications.46 To the very simple question 'when is the daemon in a happy state of bliss?', the answer should be obvious: the daemon is happy before the beginning of his wandering period and after its conclusion. His suffering begins with bloodshed and perjury,47 reaches its zenith (or nadir) at mid-point, and ends when the daemon finds again a place in the company of blessed gods. The daemon's exile from home signals a period of 30,000 seasons, probably the equivalent of 10,000 years, when the daemon finds himself in alien places (B115.6-11) or assumes alien garments (B126; cf. B 115.7). The penalty for his transgression consists in a period of successive incarnations in ever worse life forms until he reaches ultimate misery. Then a series of successive incarnations in ever better life forms begins. If the first series of incarnations indicates increased alienation from home, this second series indicates gradual proximity to home. B146 refers to this second series of reincarnations: "By the end", it says, "they become seers, minstrels, physicians and leaders for the sake of earth-dwelling men, whence gods highest in honour spring". The subject of the maim verb is missing and should be supplied from Clement's context. The Christian father said that Empedocles spoke of "the souls of wise men" (ràc; \|/uxàc; tcov aocpcov). The term yi&gt;xn is only once found in Diels' collection of Empedocles' fragments by Love blissful state - ultimate wholeness 46. O'Brien (2001) 79-149. 47. In the famous fragment B115. which is reconstructed by Diels from the accounts provided mainly by Plutarch and Hippolytus, verses 3 and 4 (if genuine, cf. Zuntz (1971) 194-5) seem to be alternative ways to denote the same thing. To bypass the false dilemma whether daemons' crime consisted in murder or peijury we may assume that the daemons had sworn an oath binding them to avoid bloodshed so that their transgression could be qualified as either peijury or murder since it was both at once. For a very convincing defence of the manuscript reading &lt;pó(3o) (instead of cpóvip. which is Stephanus' correction) in B115.3 see Picot (2007).</page><page sequence="15">Empedocles on Divine Nature 329 (B138), in a half line whose attribution to Empedocles has been seriously challen ged.48 But even there the word bears the old sense of 'life-breath'. It is then certain that in B146 Empedocles was speaking not of disembodied psychai but of daimones instead. The "end" (téXoç) of B146 must, then, mean the end of the daemons' transmigration period. It follows that the daemons incarnate as pro minent men just before their final incarnation as "gods highest in honour". If so, then Empedocles must have seen in incarnations an hierarchical order,49 In B127 lions are said to be the best animals and laurel-trees the best plants as abodes of transmigrating daemons. Such a 'chain of being' (or scala entis) ranging from the lowest plants to the highest gods would correspond to a scala divinitatis, as we shall see. The seers, minstrels, physicians and leaders of B146 are all men of superior mental skills destined to assuage the pain of average humans. Those four profes sions were probably seen by Empedocles as suitable for rather integrated dae mons, i.e. those with a higher degree of love in their constitution. If the daemon's wandering period begins when the daemon practically lays confidence in raving Strife, as B115.14 states, it must end when he practically suspends that confidence for the sake of the opposite force. And since to put confidence in Strife practically means to shed blood and break an oath, to lay confidence in Love must mean to abstain from killing, reassume the binding oath, and exhibit an increased sense of care for life quite generally. We may reasonably assume that when the daemons finally incarnate as gods their confidence in Love reaches its culmination. Their mythological return to the company of gods must then be understood as one and the same with their assumption of divine forms. In plainer words, when the daemons incarnate as gods they eo ipso return to the company of "other immortals and share hearth and table with them" (B147). Their participation in the company of gods is a return to the place of origin. The end coincides with the beginning. All intermediary stages are greater and lesser forms of alienation and fragmentation. It must be clear that Empedocles' daemons are not identical with gods. The divine form is just one among the many possible forms that a daemon may assume during transmigration. But it is not just any form, i.e. a form on an equal footing with others: the divine is the original form of the daemon. When in home and in a state of bliss the daemon is a god; when in exile and in a state of misery the daemon is a mortal creature of one sort or another. Before we proceed to investigate the dialectics of mortality and immortality in Empedocles' system it would be advisable to deal with a fragment where the philosopher-poet, while 48. Picot (2006). 49. Kahn (1993) 447.</page><page sequence="16">330 Spyridon Rangos speaking of human happiness or well-being, gives us glimpses of what it means for a human being to be like god. B132, which forms the motto of the present paper, says: "happy is the man who has gained the wealth of divine understanding, / wretched he who cherishes an obfuscated opinion about the gods". The gnomic tone of the fragment is a traditional literary form.50 What is striking here is the ambiguity of the first verse. 'To possess the wealth of divine understanding' may mean 'to possess an understanding such as the gods possess'. But it may also mean 'to possess a wealth of knowledge about the gods'. If the first line of the fragment stood on its own without a sequence, the first interpretation would be the most natural. But the presence of the second verse tends to favour the second interpretative option. For line 2 does not state that 'wretched is he who does not understand things as gods understand them'. Rather, it states that 'wretched is he who does not enter tain the right opinions about the gods', namely a person whose ideas about divine nature are either fundamentally confused or plainly false. We may ask why knowledge of the true nature of the gods was so important for Empedocles. We may also ask ourselves whether the ambiguity of the first verse might, after all, have been intentional. To answer those two questions we need to go back to B134 and see it in conjunction with B133. In B133 Empedocles says that "it is not possible to bring it [=the divine] close within reach of our eyes or to grasp it with the hands". Apparently 'eyes' and 'hands' represent the sense organs, and the fragment means to say that gods cannot be perceived through the senses. This denial, however, need not imply that gods are absolutely imperceptible. If gods are holy and loving minds, as B134 on our interpretation implies, they may be graspable by means other than sense perception. Empedocles' epistemological principle, pronounced clearly in B109, states that like is known by like. It would then follow that holy and loving minds are grasped only by other such holy and loving minds ; for "love is known by love" (B 109.3), and Pausanias is urged to mentally perceive Love (tt]v où vócp ôépKeu) rather than "sit staring dazed" (B 17.21; cf. B2). Now, if gods are loving minds sending forth their caring thoughts to the entire cosmos, as B134 on our interpretation suggests, then "to possess the wealth of divine understan ding", in the sense of possessing a mind such as the gods possess, would be tantamount to 'caring for the entire cosmos'. But to actively care for the entire cosmos is to actually possess a considerable amount of love and, because of that, to possess an understanding of, among other things, the divine as caring mind. It follows that to care about divine nature, in the sense of wanting to know what it is, is to care about caring love. It also follows that the happy human being who 50. Cf. Hes. Theog. 96-97; Hom. H. Dem. 486-487; Alcm. Fr. 5, 37-39 Page.</page><page sequence="17">Empedocles on Divine Nature 331 possesses the wealth of divine understanding is like a god among humans. I conclude, therefore, that for Empedocles to actually possess intimate knowledge about divine nature and to be such a divine nature must refer to the same state of affairs under two different descriptions. Empedocles' own self-proclaimed divi nity (B112.4) springs to mind as a case in point.51 Having realized the essentially divine nature of his own being as caring love Empedocles urged his fellow citizens to do the same by abstaining from bloodshed and purifying themselves from the pollution implicated in the works of Strife. Sextus seems to have very well captured the meaning of Empedocles' self-proclaimed divinity when, after rejecting interpretations that saw arrogance and sin in Empedocles' behaviour, claimed, instead: "Empedocles called himself a god because, having kept his mind pure from baseness and unpolluted, he alone apprehended the god without by means of the god within himself'.52 It seems that the Purifications, as its title suggests, contained specific advice about how one may reach such a purified state of being.53 For Empedocles, then, to be a divine being is to have the constitution of a holy and caring mind. B105 strongly suggests that thought is produced by the circula tion of blood around the heart, and B98 states quite plainly that blood "and other kinds of flesh" are mixtures of all four roots in equal measures, the difference presumably being the more thorough mixture of the elements in blood than in flesh. For Empedocles the more well-mixed blood is, the better the thinking produced by its circulation around the heart will be. But since anything that is well-blended is so blended because of a greater influence of Love in it, the best blood, and hence the best thinking, should be the blood that is most influenced by the power of Love. Gods as holy and caring minds will have been for Empedocles very much like pure hearts with excellent blood, their loving thoughts being the outcome of the circulation of this superb blood. By being pure, pulsating, and probably spherical hearts Empedocles' gods resemble the Sphere in which all four elemental masses are perfectly united under the supreme power of Love. It is not, therefore, the case that "daimon parallels the holy phren".54 The case is, rather, that any long-lived god is such "a holy and tremendous mind". 51. I follow the traditional interpretation of B112.4-6 defended by Panagiotou (1983) against Van der Ben's (1975) 22-25 novel interpretation. 52. Cf. Sextus Adv.

THE DIALECTICS OF MORTALITY AND IMMORTALITY In several extant fragments Empedocles juxtaposes the merely human with the divine element. In B3.1-2 the gods are summoned to turn from the poet's tongue "the madness of these" — presumably vulgar — "men and to let a pure stream flow from the hollowed lips" of the poet who then entreats the Muse to "send what is right and fitting for mortals to hear". In another such epiclesis (B131) the poet, after reminding the Muse of her earlier help to him about merely mortal concerns, asks her to answer his present prayer "as he is going to unfold a noble account about blessed gods". In B112.4 Empedocles opposes mortality with immortal divinity and claims for himself the status of the latter. In B23.ll the poet states that the recipient of his message, i.e. Pausanias, hears a discourse from a god. This authority claim, whether it refers to Empedocles himself or to his Muse,55 repeats the traditional distinction between mortals and immortals. But the opposition between mortality and immortality assumes almost tragic propor tions in B115 where long-lived daemons are said to be born in all kinds of mortal forms as a result of their transgression. Although the daemon is not an immortal but a "long-lived" entity, his punishment consists in his assumption of various mortal forms (B 115.7 : rtavrola eïÔea Bvqrdrv). The opposition of the daemonic with the merely mortal shows that Empedocles' notion of mortality was not confined to the literal meaning of the term. We may infer that the ascription of mortality to a thing did not or did not only mean that the thing in question would eventually die, i.e. dissolve. It could mean also that this thing was afflicted by pain and death while still alive. The opposite of mortality in this sense was not immortality but a blessed, integrated and well-balanced existence permeated by Love like that of the long-lived gods qua caring minds and, in a greater degree, of the Sphere. In B139, which thanks to the Strasbourg papyrus we know to have been part of the Physika, the Empedoclean speaker would prefer death to the presumably wretched existence he is now leading as a result of committing the cruel deed of eating flesh. For him to be non-existent is preferable to leading a disintegrated and wretched life. If mortality implied a mentally fragmented state of being which caused pain and death to other living creatures, its opposite, namely immortality, would be a state of psychological and mental wholeness. The opposition of mortality (appropriately understood) to blessedness is not confined to the daemonic cycle. A similar opposition appears in the cosmic cycle. The alternate dominance of Love and Strife brings about a corresponding change 55. "The god mentioned here is sometimes said to be his muse, but nothing besides a desire to save Empedocles from the sin of arrogance supports the interpretation" (Inwood (2002) 57, n.127).</page><page sequence="19">Empedocles on Divine Nature 333 in the status of the elements. When the roots are arranged in four concentric layers under the absolute rule of Strife they are (wpá (B35.15), a term which has caused a long controversy about its precise meaning.56 But when they are mixed together in various configurations under the relative influence of Love, "tens of thousands of mortal types" (ë0vea fiupia 0vr|x&lt;i&gt;v) are said to come into being, "a wonderful spectacle to see" (B.35.16-17). We may notice the parallelism between eGvea pu pía 0vr]T(I)v of the cosmic cycle and the TtavToIa ri'Sea 0vr|Tü&gt;v of the daemonic cycle. If the designation 0vi]tá in the former case applied only to the various combinations of the elements that produce unstable and ultimately dissolvable living structures, the opposition between the mortality of compound structures to the immortality of their simple constituents would be readily understandable. But it seems that Empedocles wanted to say something more than that. In describing the birth of mortal creatures he wrote the memorable verse (B35.14): "immedia tely what were formerly accustomed to be immortal sprang forth as mortal" (aUj/a 5è 0vr|T' éípúovro, Tà itpiv páGov à0àvaT' elvai). This phrase strongly suggests that the immortal roots themselves undergo a change of status and become mortal when they combine with one another under the influence of Love. Their change reminds us of the corresponding change of status which the daemon undergoes when forced to leave the company of gods. It seems that Empedocles meant the opposite attributes of 'mortality' and 'immortality' to denote not only mutually exclusive classes of things (i.e. principles, on the one hand, and derivative entities, on the other) but also temporally successive states of being (like wakefulness and sleep). Mortality and immortality are not only enantiomorphic opposites in the sense that the one is precisely what the other is not. They seem to be enantiodro mic too, in the sense of coming from, and resulting in, one another. The idea was clearly put forward by Heraclitus (B62, B76). But it seems that it has had an impact on Empedocles too. The elements recognize themselves as divine/immor tal only when Strife reigns supreme and liberates their innate tendency to form homogeneous masses on the principle of 'like to like'. But they forget, so to speak, their divine origin when they are mixed together under Love's pressure. What they seem primarily to forget is their essential deathlessness, rather than a hypothetical bliss. For, to my knowledge, the roots are nowhere characterized by Empedocles as blessed when unmixed. Mixed structures are, then, worried by death because they have forgotten the essential endlessness of their constituent parts. 56. For references see Wright (1995) 208. I think that, on the evidence of Aristotle's Poetics (1461a) 14-15 and 23-25, we should read Çcopà Te 7ipív, KÉKpr|TO. I suspect that the standard meaning of Çtopôi; ('pure', 'unmixed with water' in the case of wine) comes from an earlier (unattested) sense of 'strong' and/or 'alive'.</page><page sequence="20">334 Spyridon Rangos Now, if some particular compound structures are not only mortal but also blessed, that would mean that those particular structures are not worried by death, presumably because they have realized that death cannot afflict the essen tial immortality of their ultimate parts. Those compound structures were, I sug gest, for Empedocles the "long-lived gods highest in honour", and we have seen that those gods, including the Sphere, are the most integrated mortal beings. It follows quite generally that as long as mortal compound structures are fully integrated and live their lives in bliss not at all worried by the eventual termi nation of such a blissful existence, they can be described as divine. But whenever compound mortal things are afflicted by pain, misery and the prospect of death, because of a lower degree of integration, they can be described as exiled divinities. VI. CONCLUSIONS Let us now draw some conclusions. Since the roots are themselves alive and intelligent, it follows that everything constituted out of them will, in a certain sense, be also alive and intelligent (B110.10). And since the roots are divine (because they are unchangeable and imperishable in themselves), all destructible things made out of them (plants, animals, humans, and gods) will have a certain share in divinity. They can, therefore, be characterized under two distinct and seemingly contradictory descriptions: they are obviously mortal since their indi vidual structure will sooner or later be dissolved; but they are immortal since the portions of the elements that make up their present forms will continue to exist for ever in innumerable other configurations. As mortal they can be said to be inhabited by daemons unconscious of their divine origin. As immortal they are inhabited by daemons who have realized their divine status. The narrative of the poem On Nature was, in an important sense, the descrip tion of a divine drama. All six principles of Empedocles' physical doctrine are divine, and their interaction produces the cosmic alternation of One and Many. In the process the elements suffer loss of their divinity and become the mortal constituents of compound structures. They thus lose sight of their essential immortality and get involved in the fundamental duality of coming-into-being and passing-away. The vegetative, animal, human and divine realms constitute a hierarchy of lower and higher species and individuals displaying various grades of integration. There is a sense in which everything whatsoever is divine, and another sense in which only highly integrated structures are divine. The prototype of them all is</page><page sequence="21">Empedocles on Divine Nature 335 the Sphere, the integrated whole par excellence, but there are innumerable others. They are the "long-lived gods, highest in honour". Their visible symbol is the sun who darts heat and life-providing energy to the entire cosmos of our sense experience. According to Empedocles, the cosmic cycle as a whole is variously reflected in the birth, maturation and death of each and every distinct being of our world. At the peak of their existence distinct beings are integrated structures which resemble, in a very dim way, the wholeness of the Sphere. But their physical wholeness is rarely coupled by a corresponding awareness of whole ness. The physical and the mental aspects of wholeness seem to part company. Such a rupture of mental wholeness is expressed in the vivid imagery of exiled daemons. Whereas Empedocles' Sphere indicates the sacredness, aliveness and unity of blissful being, the exiled daemon is a symbol of the profanation and the empirical fragmentariness of life. A distinctive feature of those highly integrated structures which also possess a mental awareness of wholeness is bliss. In Empedocles' natural and ethical phi losophy, bliss turns out to be the most prominent feature of divinity, more pro minent than immortality or merely everlasting existence. The most blissful entities are the most divine, and since wholeness is the product of Love those entities that display bliss in the highest degree are those in the actual life of which Love plays a most prominent role. Immortality presupposes simple, hence indissoluble, entities, while bliss is ascribed to fully integrated entities which must be compound, hence perishable. Two different tendencies or trends of early Greek philosophy seem to vie for supremacy in Empedocles' understanding of godhead.57 The first, stemming from Ionian monism, says that the truly divine nature is the everlasting dpxn out of which everything is constituted. In it divinity was the predicate of endless continuity through time or (which is the same) eternal perseverance in time. The second, coming from Eleatic monism, says that motionless Being is, despite appearances, always a spherical whole, always full, always lacking in nothing. In this second trend divinity was primarily a predicate of timeless wholeness, not of temporal continuity or endless persistence. Those two different views about the divine had also a Homeric pedigree. For the traditional gods of Homer were both immortal (à0àvcxToi / aièv éôvTeç) and blissful (iicucapeç). In his teaching Empedocles tried to summarize the entire poetic and philosophical tradition of his time. Still, the tension between the two conceptions of divinity is evident. Divine bliss cannot last for ever. For, in line with Heraclitus' message, Being is 57. Cf. Solmsen (1975) 136-141, 144-145.</page><page sequence="22">336 Spyridon Rangos (in) conflict.
