<plain_text><page sequence="1">Legal Advice Privilege and its Relevance to Corporations Andrew Higgins* This article considers whether the rationale for legal advice privilege applies to corporations. It examines the rationale for legal advice privilege in the aftermath of the disagreement between the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords in theThree Rivers litigation, and argues that the rule of law rationale for advice privilege endorsed by the House of Lords is based largely on the needs and behavior of individuals. The paper examines the case for recognising advice privilege for corporations. Recent developments in corporate law and governance, especially in relation to directors' duties, have arguably reduced the need for a corporate privilege. Public and large private companies in particular already have sufficient incentives to obtain accurate legal advice about their affairs even without a privilege. There are also sound policy reasons for restricting the right of corporations to claim legal advice privilege given its costs to the administration of justice. INTRODUCTION Legal advice privilege has a long pedigree dating back to 1833 when Lord Broughman held in Greenhough v Gaskell that legal professional privilege covered legal advice unconnected with any litigation, so that clients could arrange their affairs in order to 'make any proceedings successful, or all proceedings superflu- ous.'1 However, the realities of modern corporate life are so different from those which existed in the nineteenth century that it is doubtful whether corporations need a privilege in order to obtain accurate legal advice, and whether they should be granted a privilege. This paper argues that corporate advice privilege is a rule that is slowly losing its rationale. In England and Wales, cracks have now begun to appear in the judiciary s sup- port for corporate advice privilege. On the one hand, the House of Lords gave a resounding endorsement of legal advice privilege inThree Rivers No 6 and stressed that the privilege was a right of all legal persons including corporations.2 On the other hand, the Court of Appeal gave a judgment in Three Rivers No 5 which has the potential to substantially limit the scope of corporate advice privilege.3 The Court of Appeal rejected privilege claims over documents prepared by Bank of England employees in preparation for an inquiry into the collapse of the BCCI. It ruled that the client for the purposes of the privilege was a special unit established *Career Development Fellow in Civil Procedure, Faculty of Law and University College, University of Oxford.

The implications of the decision, that not all employees of a corporation (or public body) will necessarily fall within the definition of the client, and thus their com- munications will not automatically qualify for advice privilege, sent Shockwaves through the legal community4 However, the House of Lords refused leave from the decision inThree Rivers No 5, and declined to revisit the issue inThree Rivers No 6 despite being urged to do so by numerous interest groups who had intervened in the appeal.5 The courts have thus affirmed the need for corporate advice privilege, while at the same time opening the possibility of limiting its scope. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to examine critically the House of Lords' (implicit) claim in Three Rivers No 6 that the justification for advice privilege applies equally to corporations and individuals; secondly, to explain why the Court of Appeals con- cern in Three Rivers No 5 to limit the scope of corporate advice privilege is defen- sible, and why it reflects a broader legal trend. The House of Lords' decision in Three Rivers No 6 is symptomatic of a gap between the jurisprudence on privilege and the modern realities of corporate life. Too often, courts explain the rationale for corporate privilege by considering its value to the individual - for example a witness at an inquest, or a testator making a will - and then argue by analogy that the privilege is needed by all legal persons from the Crown to major publicly listed companies because all legal persons require advice, and artificial entities can only obtain advice if their agents are will- ing to consult a lawyer and be completely candid with the lawyer about the entity's affairs. This reasoning is reminiscent of the 'insidious practice'6 of extend- ing legal rules to artificial legal 'persons' based solely on an anthropomorphic model of treating such persons as if they were real persons. Some of the pitfalls of this reasoning are obvious when the analogy between natural and artificial persons does not hold: corporations cannot make wills and enjoy perpetual succession, nor can they testify in person. Of greater sig- nificance, is that this mode of reasoning can lead courts to ignore the complex body of laws that specifically govern and regulate those legal persons (for example, the Companies Act 2006) and the effect such laws have on the value of the rule. Several developments in corporate law and governance in the UK have reduced the need for a corporate privilege. More stringent obligations have been imposed on directors to stay properly informed about the company's affairs as part of their duties of 'diligence' and 'skill and care'. These changes have now been codified in section 174 of the Companies Act 2006, and the new derivative action under Part 11 of the Act will make it easier for individual shareholders to com- mence derivative actions for breaches of directors' duties. The UK also has a voluntary but influential corporate governance code for publicly listed compa- nies, which requires inter alia the adoption of internal risk management and 4 B.

Arguably there is a trend here: in many corporate contexts the privileges role in encouraging corporate agents to comply with the law has been overtaken by laws and policies designed to force corporate agents to do the very same thing: achieve compliance. Ultimately, the case for corporate advice privilege rests on a belief that the best way to achieve legal compliance is to encourage corporations to com- ply voluntarily, and to remove obstacles that would undermine this goal. Increas- ingly, however, lawmakers are no longer prepared to leave compliance to the judgment and competence of corporate managers and their advisers. Instead they are seeking ways of making companies 'perform better' through regulation of cor- porate agent behaviour, and more accountable through greater transparency. This shift in policy focus, putting less emphasis on voluntary compliance and more on regulation, has substantially reduced the need for a corporate privilege because corporations and their agents already have sufficient incentives to obtain accurate legal advice even without a privilege. These corporate-specific developments need to be situated in a broader legal debate about the value of legal advice privilege. Not only did the Court of Appeal question the scope of corporate advice privilege inThree Rivers, but in two separate rulings the Court of Appeal questioned the rationale for legal advice privilege per se, disputing whether a client needed a privilege to talk candidly to their lawyer where the purpose of a communication was to obtain legal advice unconnected with litigation.8 It was the second of these rulings that led the House of Lords to reaffirm the value of legal advice privilege as a fundamental right. Nonetheless, their Lordships may have been too quick to close the book on the rationale for advice privilege, for the Court of Appeal's analysis is particularly apposite in the case of corporations. The first part of this paper re-examines the rationale for legal advice privilege. It argues that the rationale for advice privilege is principally based on the needs and behaviour of individuals, and has limited relevance to corporations. The sec- ond part of the paper will turn to the corporate privilege specifically, examining how the privilege affects the behaviour of corporate agents, from directors to ordinary employees, and the value of the privilege to corporations in light of the recent developments in corporate law and governance. It argues that the empirical case for corporate advice privilege is weak because companies, especially large and publicly listed companies, already have sufficient incentives to obtain accurate legal advice. Furthermore, the case for a corporate advice privilege is not just an empirical question. Normatively as a society we must also consider what stan- dards of conduct, transparency and accountability we should demand of corpora- tions and their agents.

THE RATIONALE FOR LEGAL ADVICE PRIVILEGE Legal professional privilege confers an absolute immunity from compulsory dis- closure of certain confidential communications between a lawyer and their client in connection with the giving of legal advice or representation, and confidential communications between a lawyer and third parties in preparation for legal pro- ceedings.9 Notes and memoranda generated by lawyers for the purposes of advis- ing or representing their clients are also protected by privilege.10 The privilege belongs to the client, the client is free to waive the privilege for whatever reason.11 Lawyers, like most professionals, have professional obligations to protect the con- fidences of their clients. Lawyers are also subject to a range of equitable, common law and statutory duties restricting their ability to disclose or use confidential information.12 These laws apply to most professional and commercial relation- ships, yet in England and Wales the communications of every other professional and commercial relationship are also subject to compulsory legal disclosure. Only lawyers and their clients can resist compulsory disclosure of their communications. Thus the basic policy choice is not between recognising a privilege or permitting breaches of clients' privacy, but whether to maintain a privilege from compulsory disclosure which is presently exclusive to one relationship13 or to rely on general rules of confidentiality that determine when information can or must be disclosed. A number of rationales have been put forward for the privilege over its lengthy lifespan, ranging from protecting the honour of the gentleman barrister to priv- acy concerns. The most convincing and enduring rationale has been the idea that the privilege promotes the rule of law by enabling people to gain a better under- standing of their legal rights and obligations. This is an important end in itself, and underlines much of the recent jurisprudence declaring the privilege to be a fundamental human right.14 However, the privilege is also said to have social ben- efits, principally through fostering greater legal compliance. Of course, the absence of a privilege does not prevent anyone from obtaining legal advice, but it may still constitute a practical barrier to persons gaining knowledge of the law. 9 A useful definition of privilege, which has been held to accurately reflect the common law posi- tion, can be found in section 10(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984: Rv Central Crim- inal Court ex p Francis &amp; Francis [19891 AC 346, 392. 10 Anderson v Bank of British Columbia (1876) 2 Ch D 644 CA 656. 11 ß v Auckland District Law Society [2003] UKPC 38, [2003] AC 736 at [44]-[45]. 12 For example the equitable duty of confidence, express or implied obligations of confidence in con- tract and statutory obligations under the Data Protection Act 1988. 13 In England and Wales the authorities have been uniformly against extending the privilege to other relationships: C.

The claims that the privilege fosters more consultation with lawyers and greater candour in the lawyer client relationship are crucial, for without them the case for the privilege is stillborn. To date there have only been three empirical studies into the behavioural assumptions underlying legal professional privilege.16 A study by Yale University in 1962 found that almost half the people surveyed were not aware of the privilege rule, somewhat weakening the argument that it encourages people to consult with lawyers. The assumption that privilege induces greater candour in the lawyer client relationship largely rests on lawyers' experiences, intuitions and analysis of client self interest over the centuries. Almost every experienced lawyer has a story, and sometimes many, of how the privilege played an important role in encouraging a client to talk to them. Even opponents of the privilege have rarely challenged the assumption. For example, Benthams principal critique of the pri- vilege proceeded on the correctness of the empirical assumption. He argued that if the privilege were abolished clients would no longer repose confidences in their lawyers so no breach of trust would befall them, while clients who had acted in good faith had nothing to fear from disclosure of their communications with law- yers. The net result of abolishing the privilege would be that persons who had breached the law would not derive as much assistance from their lawyers in defending charges or claims against them as they do with the privilege.17 Benthams critique was directed at litigation privilege, which covers communi- cations between the lawyer and client for the purposes of preparing for actual or contemplated litigation. The claim that without privilege there would be a lack of candour in lawyer client communications is a strong one in the context of litiga- tion. Set against the prospect of a court determining a persons rights and liabil- ities, or culpability, there is a real risk that a client will withhold information from their lawyers for fear of prejudicing their cause if the information could be dis- closed and used against them. Sometimes those apprehensions are misguided and the information actually supports the party's own case. Sometimes the apprehen- sions are well founded. In both cases, the privilege provides a secure zone in which 15 A.

But where no legal proceedings are on foot or contemplated, the justification for legal advice privilege is not so clear. Not long after Benthams critique of pri- vilege, the English courts extended the privilege to cover legal advice uncon- nected with any pending or apprehended litigation.19 Lord Brougham LC justified the extension in the following terms: If the privilege was confined to communications connected with suits begun, or intended or expected or apprehended, no -one could safely adopt such precautions as might eventually render any proceedings successful, or all proceedings superflu- ous.20 Lord Broughams analysis is perfectly defensible to the extent that it recognises the value in obtaining legal advice before any dispute has arisen, or offence com- mitted, in relation to the very matters that at some point may become the subject of a dispute. What this analysis assumes however, without substantiation, is that the privilege is needed to secure access to legal advice in circumstances where there are no prospects of legal proceedings. The critical difference between the opera- tion of litigation privilege and legal advice privilege is both in the timing of when advice is sought and the reasons for which advice is sought. The client seeking legal assistance for the purpose of litigation, and the client who seeks purely legal advice, have divergent interests when it comes to deciding what information they will disclose to the lawyer. One wants to win their case, the other wants accurate legal advice so that they can protect their legal rights or avoid legal liability. Self-interest in the context of legal advice would tend to motivate the client to provide full disclosure of relevant facts because she wants the right advice and any advice not tailored to the true facts will be of limited assistance, however accu- rately it may state the law. The same is not true of litigation privilege, because the litigant has an interest in only putting forward the facts most favorable to their case. As Justice Longmore expressed it in Three Rivers No 5, for the client who is seeking purely legal advice 'the prospect of winning or losing a particular case will normally do nothing to cloud his judgment as to what facts he places before his legal adviser.'21 Both the timing of and reasons for requesting advice are critical factors in influ- encing what information a client will impart to their lawyer. The question is not solely whether litigation is foreseeable at the time the advice is sought. There is always a possibility of litigation if the client does not follow their lawyer's advice, and ends up breaching the law. Rather the key issue is whether the advice is sought before, during or after the events that may give rise to legal liability. If the advice is sought ex ante (for example in relation to the legality of a business proposal, or when a client wants to know what a law requires her to do) then self interest will motivate disclosure. Even if the events in question have already been 18 Anderson v Bank of British Columbia (1876) 2 Ch D 644 CA 649. 19 GreenouQh v Gaskell (1833) 1 My &amp; K 98. 20 ibid, 103. 21 Three Rivers (No 5) n 3 above at [26]. © 2010 The Author.

The client needs accurate legal advice so that she can comply with the law, or take whatever steps are necessary to protect her rights. Ignorance of the law is no excuse, as the oft- cited maxim puts it. Incomplete or inaccurate legal advice is no excuse and not much help, either.22 So when a person needs legal advice, it would be foolish of them not to make a clean breast of it' to their lawyer. The force of the self-interest motivates disclosure' analysis can be seen when the lawyer client relationship is compared with other professional relationships built on trust and confidence which work without a privilege. Take, for example, the doctor-patient relationship. The self-interest in obtaining an accurate diagnosis provides an extremely strong motivation for the patient to fully disclose all poten- tially relevant information to the doctor. An incorrect diagnosis is of no value to the patient and could end up worsening their medical condition. Similarly there is no value to a client in obtaining advice that is wrong, and considerable risk to them if they choose to rely on it. Failing to talk candidly to the lawyer means the client may be wasting time and money, or risking serious legal consequences including imprisonment. The doctor-patient relationship might be distinguished from the lawyer-client relationship on the grounds that legal rights and obligations are often inter-perso- nal, and inherently controversial. However many aspects of the doctor patient relationship are also inter-personal, such as the treatment of contagious or com- municable diseases. Diagnosis and treatment of such diseases would seem to be the quintessential case in which a doctor-patient privilege is necessary to encou- rage patients to seek medical treatment and be completely candid with their doc- tor. Ironically however, in some jurisdictions including England and Wales, doctors have compulsory reporting obligations when treating patients with com- municable diseases.23 So can a convincing case be mounted for legal advice privilege notwithstand- ing the fact that the client has very strong incentives to disclose all the relevant facts to their lawyer? Yes, most certainly, for there are a number of situations where the self-interest analysis falls down, or is irrelevant, such that a privilege can be justified. The archetypal case for legal advice privilege is where a client seeks advice in relation to past events. If the client has done X, but has no knowledge whether X is lawful and if unlawful whether it can be rectified, she may wish to obtain advice as to whether X will give rise to legal liability. Without a privilege the cli- ent faces a difficult dilemma between getting advice to clarify her legal position at the risk of having those communications disclosed to her prejudice, or to refrain from obtaining advice and living with the attendant uncertainty regarding her legal rights and obligations. The latter outcome would be particularly unfortunate for both the client and the goal of encouraging legal compliance if X could in fact 22 An action for professional negligence may be available if the advice itself was negligent. 23 Under the Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations 1988 doctors in England and Wales have a statutory duty to notify a 'Proper Officer' of the Local Authority of suspected cases of certain infectious diseases. © 2010 The Author.

Sometimes, a persons involvement in past events can become the subject of quasi-legal proceedings, and he may be called on to produce documents or give evidence about the matter. An inquest is a case in point, as noted by Lord Carswell in Three Rivers No 6.24 The case for advice privi- lege in such circumstances is the same as the case for litigation privilege. The client needs legal advice and/or assistance to protect his legal position, and a secure zone in which to take advice and prepare his response. The second instance where a privilege can be justified is that where the clients predominant concern is to protect personal relationships, sensitivities and reputa- tions, rather than their own self-interest. The classic example considered in Three Rivers No 6 is the testator who wishes to instruct a solicitor to draw up his will. Lord Rodger noted that the instructions of a client may be motivated by jealou- sies, slights, animosities and affections, which the- testator would not wish to be revealed but which he must nevertheless explain if the solicitor is to carry out his wishes.'25 This statement could be criticised on the grounds that it is doubtful that such sentiments of the testator are relevant to the validity of his will, and would probably be inadmissible in any challenge to it - a point implicitly made by Lord Phillips in the Court of Appeal inThree Rivers No 6 when he stated on behalf of the court that there is little reason to fear that, if privilege were not available in such circumstances, communications between solicitor and client would be inhib- ited.26 Nonetheless, in terms of the value of the privilege Lord Rodger probably has the better of the argument because the correct question is not whether such matters are irrelevant, but whether the client knows they are irrelevant. Given that principal means by which he is going to obtain such knowledge is through advice from his lawyer, there is a risk that without an assurance from the lawyer that whatever he says will be kept confidential, a client may be so concerned about the disclosure of his motivations that he will materially alter his instructions. The third case where a privilege may be justified concerns that of clients who are ambivalent about complying with the law. While the law-abiding individual seeks advice for the purpose of ordering his affairs in a lawful manner, individuals who are ambivalent about legal compliance may only wish to know what the legal consequences of a particular course of action are. Without a privilege, there is a real likelihood that the indifferent or recalcitrant individual would refrain from seeking advice or disclosing his plans to the lawyer because he has not yet made a decision about what course of action to adopt, and does not want his com- munications used against him if he decides not to follow the advice he receives. Every person, whether they are a diligent law abiding citizen or a committed anarchist, has the right to know the law. Furthermore even affording the privilege to the recalcitrant individual can have social benefits. The lawyer might persuade the client to disclose all the relevant facts with the aid of the privilege, and can then advise him on ways in which the proposed conduct can be executed lawfully, or alternatively convince him not to engage in the proposed conduct because the legal consequences are too great. 24 n 2 above at [1151. 25 ibid at '55l 26 Three Rivers (No 6)nS above at [39]. © 2010 The Author.

It presumes that clients always under- stand what is in their own self-interest, and how those interests can be furthered when making decisions about consulting a lawyer and what information to put before the lawyer. Human beings are not always rational, and because of our var- ied levels of education, intelligence, and experience with the legal system, it may be that many persons out of fear or misapprehension believe that in some situa- tions they should avoid getting legal advice, or should tell their lawyers as little as possible about their affairs. A recurring theme in the Australian authorities reiter- ating the importance of the privilege as a fundamental right is the need to protect the liberty' and 'dignity' of all persons, especially the ordinary citizen, the unin- telligent' and the 'ill-informed', in their dealings with the state.27 In short, legal advice privilege plays an important role in maintaining an appropriate balance in the relationship between the state and individual. Recognising the value of advice privilege in the circumstances above raises some fundamental questions about the rationale for affording it to corporations. Most of the cases where there is a strong likelihood of reduced candour in the lawyer client relationship in the absence of a privilege relate to the needs and behaviour of individuals. Indeed as Lord Rodger noted in Three Rivers No 6 the rationale for the privilege 'is rooted in an aspect of human nature.'28 The question is whether these aspects of human nature, which justify advice privilege for the individual, are relevant to corporate clients as an empirical matter, and whether they should be taken into account as a matter of policy. It is nonsensical to talk about the jealousies, animosities and affections' of an artificial entity, or its dig- nity. Secondly, how many corporations fall into the category of 'ill-informed' and 'inexperienced', such that they may not appreciate that it is in the company's interests to disclose all the facts to the company lawyer? Thirdly how many cor- porations are ambivalent' towards legal compliance such that they are not willing to disclose their intentions to a lawyer without the protection of a privilege? The probable answers are not many, especially in the case of large corporations. Even if there are significant numbers of ambivalent and ill-informed corporations, there is a further question as to whether the law should tolerate such standards of con- duct from corporations and their agents. Should the law make allowances for cor- porate agents acting 'irrationally'? As can be seen in the next section such standards are increasingly no longer acceptable and there are concerted efforts by law and policy makers to improve them. In discussing the standards of corporate behaviour' it should be stressed we are not talking about the behaviour of individuals qua individuals acting on their own behalf, but in their capacity as agents of an artificial entity, which the law treats as a separate legal person from its members. These artificial entities - creatures of the law - enjoy various privileges and powers not available to natural persons, the most prized of which is limited liability. Whether these special powers and privi- leges entitle the state to regulate corporations more closely is a contested question 27 Baker v Campbell (1983) 153 CLR 52, 95, 120; Attorney General (NT) v Maurice (1986) 161 CLR 475, 484. 28 n 2 above at [54]. © 2010 The Author.

These requirements are designed to protect the corporations members, its creditors and the wider community; and the state has a legitimate interest in regulating the behaviour of corporate agents to achieve these objectives. One legal requirement is that as a condition of registration a putative company must be dedicated to exclusively lawful purposes.31 Granting a privilege to corporations is a means of encouraging corporate agents to take advice so that they can ensure the entity's purposes remain lawful, and are carried out in a lawful manner. Increasingly however, governments are opting for laws and policies designed to force corporate agents to obtain that advice and achieve compliance, rather than relying on the privilege carrot alone. This trend has ramifications for the social utility of corporate privilege. THE CASE FOR CORPORATE ADVICE PRIVILEGE The main argument for extending privilege to corporations is an instrumental one: that it promotes the same desirable behaviour in corporations that it is sup- posed to promote in individuals, encouraging greater consultation with lawyers, greater candour in the lawyer-client relationship and ultimately greater legal com- pliance. The US Supreme Court, the House of Lords and the High Court of Aus- tralia have all expressed this belief when affirming their support for corporate privilege.32 In Three Rivers (No 6), Lord Scott declared that the privilege was a fundamental right of all legal persons great and small, real or artificial. He stated: [The authorities] recognize that in the complex world in which we live there are a multitude of reasons why individuals, whether humble or powerful, or corpora- tions whether large or small, may need to seek the advice or assistance of lawyers in connection with their affairs; they recognize that the seeking and giving of this advice so that the clients may achieve an orderly arrangement of their affairs is strongly in the public interest.33 This is a strong statement, but its flaw is that it does not consider the differences between the corporate and individual privilege, and whether the privilege does in fact promote the same behaviour in corporations that it is said to promote in individuals. The answer is not axiomatic. Transposing a rule originally designed for individuals into a corporate setting can create genuine problems of Tit'. The courts have struggled to define the scope of corporate privilege, wrestling with 29 See eg J.

Therefore, if the privilege is to perform its intended function it must guide the behaviour of the many actors that make up the corporate client. Accordingly, the position of directors and ordinary employees, who have different interests and are subject to different obligations, need to be separately examined when considering the effects of pri- vilege on corporate behaviour. And there is the concomitant problem that the confidence' does not belong to any of these corporate agents but to the entity itself, and that the power to waive privilege over communications resides not with the agents who were a party to the communication but those who control the company. This rule is bound to reduce the candour of some employees when talking with corporate counsel. One of the differences between corporations and individuals cited as a reason in favour of a corporate privilege is that corporations are subject to an ever increas- ing array of complex laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws would be virtually impossible without taking legal advice, and guaranteeing corporations the right to communicate with their lawyers in confidence is an effective way of encouraging corporations to get legal advice. This is the position of most lawyers associations and corporate lobby groups. For example, the American Bar Associa- tion claims that: Promoting legal compliance is one of the most significant incentives offered by the attorney-client privilege to corporate organizations. Corporations are faced by a myriad of complex legal requirements. Sometimes the actions that corporate man- agement considers pursuing may unbeknownst to it violate the law. Extending the privilege to corporations fosters an open dialogue between a corporations manage- ment and corporate counsel, which can help ensure that the corporation complies with laws that might otherwise have been broken.36 Were the risk of compulsory disclosure of lawyer-client communications to have a chilling effect on corporations, the inevitable result would be reduced legal 34 The Court of Appeal ruled in Three Rivers No 5 n 3 above, that privilege could not be claimed over communications prepared by ordinary Bank of England employees, because the Bingham Inquiry Unit was the client for the purposes of that case. However it did not lay down any guidelines to identify which members of a corporate group or public body constitute the client for the purpose of the privilege rule. 35 If one accepts the empirical assumption applies. In Upjohn v US n 32 above, the US Supreme Court stated that a privilege attended by uncertainty 'is little better than no privilege' (at 396-397) despite in the very same opinion expressly declining to lay down clear guidelines as to when corporate communications will attract privilege (at 393). 36 American Bar Association, Taskforce on Attorney Client Privilege Report 18 May 2005, 9.

Perhaps not co-inciden- tally one heavily regulated area is the laws governing trade and commerce where the line between prohibited conduct and legitimate commercial behaviour is hardly an 'instinctive matter.'37 Given the complex web of laws that are a feature of developed societies, partly because of the need for rules regulating corporate activities and the dominant role corporations play in those societies, it would seem on first reckoning self evident that the privilege should be extended to cor- porations - to enable their human agents to take the necessary steps to ensure compliance with the law. This argument is superficially attractive but can also be turned on its head. The fact that corporations are subject to an often bewildering array of regulations means that their agents have little choice but to obtain accurate legal advice about the company's affairs. Legal advice and assistance might be necessary to help man- agement understand the regulatory environment in which they operate, to carry out internal investigations into possible breaches of the law, and even to structure day to day business transactions. Put simply most large corporations are virtually dependent on accurate legal advice in conducting their business, and thus need little incentive in the form of a privilege to obtain it. Contributors to the Harvard Law Review have more than once described corporations and the state as 'irreduci- ble bedfellows'.38 Some empirical support for this argument can be found in a study of corporate attitudes towards privilege in the US in 1989.39 The study con- ducted by Vincent Alexander found that lawyers were Virtually omnipresent' at the larger corporations surveyed.40 Remarkably, Alexanders study is the only empirical study to date on the effects of the privilege on corporate behaviour. It comprised 182 interviews with corpo- rate executives, in-house counsel, external corporate attorneys and judges in Man- hattan.41 The results provided qualified support for a corporate privilege, but also demonstrated its limitations and suggested that the importance of the privilege in promoting candour may be overstated. Some of the key findings were: (i) a solid majority of the lawyers' (82 per cent of external counsel and 62 per cent of in- house counsel) stated that in their experience the existence of the privilege encouraged candour on the part of corporate executives. Three quarters of corpo- rate executives reported the same belief;42 (ii) executives' interaction with counsel relied more heavily on their trust and experience with that counsel, than knowl- edge of privilege laws. If rapport was established executives would continue to consult these counsel even if the privilege were abolished or curtailed;43 (iii) if the privilege were abolished executives would put fewer things in writing and be more circumspect in written communication. Most oral consultations would 37 United States v Upjohn n 32 above, 392-393. 38 Note, 'The Attorney Client Privilege: Fixed Rules, Balancing, and Constitutional Entitlement' (1977) 91 Harvard Law Review 464, 473-4; 'The Supreme Court: 1980 Term (1981) 95 Harvard Law Review 91, 276-77. 39 Alexander, n 16 above. 40 ibid 273. 41 ibid 202. 42 ibid 246, 261. 43 ibid 225, 248, 263, 269-270. © 2010 The Author.

These persons have a vested interest in maintaining a broad corporate privilege and are likely to overstate its importance. An analysis of the different actors that make up the corporation, and the laws affecting them, is an objective and prob- ably more reliable guide. One of the most striking features of corporate actors' interests and the laws governing them is the changes that have occurred since Alexander conducted his study. The position of directors Probably the biggest changes to corporate law in the UK in terms of its potential impact on the corporate privilege are changes to the content of directors' duties. The most important obligations of directors are the combined duties of diligence, care and skill owed to the company. Historically, these duties were given a lax interpretation by the courts, and required the director simply to exercise the level of skill or care he or she possessed.49 Of course, if the director was a professional and experienced business-person, as was frequently the case, in practice this test would require a high degree of skill and care. However, in light of the realities of modern corporate life, where many directors are highly paid professionals and ordinary shareholders have little say in their appointment or removal, the law has gradually imposed more stringent obligations on directors to be properly informed about matters affecting the company, and to meet an objective standard of care and skill.50 This shift has been codified in section 174 of the Companies Act 2006, which provides that a director of a company must exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence' and defines reasonable care as follows: This means the care, skill and diligence that would be exercised by a reasonably diligent person with (a) the general knowledge, skill and experience that may rea- sonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions carried out by the 44 ibid 264, 370-371, 374. 45 ibid 295. 46 ibid 266. 47 ibid. 48 ibid. 49 Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co [1925] Ch 407. 50 Dorchester Finance Co v Stebbing [1989] BCLC 498 Ch (The case was decided in 1977); Norman v Theodore Goddard [1991] BCLC 1027 Ch; Re D'Jan of London Ltd [1994] 1 BCLC 561 Ch. © 2010 The Author.

Under the new test, the directors personal skills can only add to the objective standard of care that they would otherwise be required to meet. The significance of this duty to corporate advice privilege is straightforward. The obligation on directors to be diligent and exercise reasonable skill and care in managing the company for executive directors, or to place themselves in a posi- tion to guide and monitor the management of the company in the case of non- executive directors, means that both types of directors have an extremely strong incentive, if not a practical requirement, to obtain accurate legal advice about the company's affairs. This is not a legal duty in the strict sense. The authorities demonstrate a strong reluctance to prescribe the content of the diligence duty in the abstract, and they are highly unlikely to hold that section 174 imposes a legal obligation to take advice about the company's affairs.51 Nonetheless, what those same courts have been will- ing to do is lay down guidelines as to the minimum level of diligence and care that can ordinarily be expected of the reasonable director. It is readily apparent from the detail of these guidelines that in many cases getting regular and accurate legal advice is a practical necessity for the reasonable director. In Daniels v Ander- son,52 the New South Wales Court of Appeal sought to outline the level of dili- gence, skill and care reasonably required of a director. The decision has been endorsed by the High Court in England as accurately reflecting the law in Eng- land and Wales.53 The requirements that can be discerned from the judgment in Daniels include: (i) become familiar with the business of the company; (ii) guide and monitor the management of the company; (iii) get outside specialist advice on issues of substantial importance', (iv) understand the regulatory environment in which the com- pany operates and measures taken to comply with that environment, and (v) do not 'shut eyes' to corporate misconduct.54 The requirements highlighted in italics virtually demand directors obtain legal advice. It is almost inconceivable that a director could obtain a thorough under- standing of the regulatory environment in which the company operates without obtaining legal advice. At the same time, advice about the regulatory environ- ment will be a vital means of educating directors on what measures must be adopted by the company in order to achieve compliance. Similarly, the need to obtain specialist advice on issues of substantial importance will invariably require directors to obtain legal advice where those issues have a legal dimension. Finally, the requirement not to shut one's eyes to corporate misconduct will require direc- tors to establish internal controls, and, when evidence of wrongdoing emerges, to 51 See eg Parker J in Re Barings pic and others (No 5), Secretary of State JorTrade and Industry v Bakerand others (No 5) [1999] 1 BCLC 433 Ch 489.

All this requires the assistance of lawyers. Directors' duties not only influence the decision about whether to obtain legal advice. They also affect the decisions of directors about what information to disclose to the lawyer and their instructions. The requirements on directors outlined in Daniels are not mere formalities or a box-ticking exercise that can be satisfied by obtaining a legal opinion no matter how general or brief it might be. Directors must get accurate and relevant advice about the company's affairs so that they can guide the company's decision-making. To get accurate and rele- vant legal advice, directors must provide full and accurate instructions to their lawyers. A recent case from the New South Wales Supreme Court, ASIC v Macdonald provides a salutary warning in this respect. The case was brought by the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) against the directors of James Hardie Ltd, historically Australia's largest manufacturer of asbestos products. ASIC alleged that the entire James Hardie board had breached their duties of diligence and care by approving misleading public statements regarding a proposed corporate structure.55 The purpose of the restructure was to separate James Hardies massive asbestos liabilities from the corporate group, by establishing an independent trust fund to manage and pay compensation claims. James Hardie was diligent in making sure the directors of each of the enti- ties involved in the restructure received advice about their duties as directors. The restructure was a complex one, involving a series of transactions one of which required court approval. It would have been impossible for James Hardie to undertake the restructure without obtaining legal assistance, and it had obtained extensive expert and legal advice on how to achieve the restructure and its poten- tial ramifications. Unfortunately, however, James Hardie used wholly inadequate actuarial reports to calculate the amount of funds the trust would need to satisfy the asbestos liabilities. As a result, the trust was massively underfunded, and Hardie had in effect defrauded thousands of involuntary creditors. When it became clear that the trust was technically insolvent, the NSW State Government established a Royal Commission to investigate the matter. The Commission made highly critical findings about James Hardie, noting that the restructure went ahead despite there being a host of lawyers advising on it (and the applicable law), but not on the merits of the underlying transactions or their legality. The report stated: What is ... disturbing ... is that ... no one . . . expressed any view on the merits of the underlying transactions. The nature of directors' duties was discussed at length, the subjects to which the duties relate were not.56 55 ASIC v Macdonald (No ÍÍ) [2009] NSWSC 287 (re breach of directors duties); ASIC v Macdonald (No 12) [2009] NSWSC 174 (re application by directors to be exonerated for breach, and declaration of penalties). 56 D.

(2010) 73(3) MLR 371-398 385</page><page sequence="16">Legal Advice Privilege and its Relevance to Corporations The principal defence of the directors in ASICs subsequent enforcement proceed- ings was that they did not see, nor approve, the misleading statements made by James Hardie to the market about the restructure.57 The outcome of the case therefore turned largely on the evidence as to what transpired at the board meet- ing, rather than on whether the directors were entitled to rely on legal and other expert advice in approving and announcing the restructure. The Court held that the directors did see and approve the misleading statement.58 However, most of the directors sought to rely on the extensive legal and other expert advice the board had received on the restructure as part of an application to be relieved of liability for breaching their directors' duties. Section 1317S(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) states a court may relieve a person of liability for breaching a civil penalty provision if they acted honestly and taking into account all the circum- stances of the case. The circumstances that the directors relied on included the fact that their lawyers were present at the meeting which approved the (misleading) statements announcing the restructure and made no objection to it. The Court ruled however that the presence of lawyers and other advisors at the board meet- ing did not assist the directors' position.59 At best, the lawyers had been given limited instructions and gave limited advice. At worst, their presence was mere window dressing. The judgment and penalties imposed are likely to be appealed,60 but the case provides a cautionary lesson: if directors wish to rely on legal advice as a defence to a claim alleging breaches of the duties of diligence and care, the advice must be relevant to the matters they are considering so that it can inform their decision-making. To ensure the advice is relevant, a company has little choice but to disclose all the material facts to their lawyers, and instruct them to give an unfettered opinion about the legality of the matters in question and what would be a sensible course of action in the circumstances. It would a be a foolhardy director who would be prepared to go into the wit- ness box facing allegations that they breached their duties of care and diligence and admit that they did not obtain detailed legal advice or provide full instruc- tions to the company lawyer about any matter with a legal dimension that could significantly affect the company Similarly, it would be a weak defence for a direc- tor to claim that she took legal advice, but only orally, on the issue in question. In most cases detailed and accurate legal advice will be necessary, but not sufficient, to establish a director s defence against an alleged breach of section 174. Where a company is or becomes insolvent, and the failure of a director to take legal advice amounts to incompetence, the director could also face an application for disquali- fication on the grounds of unfitness.61 Finally, it should be noted that the extent to which directors' duties promote com- pliance is not merely a function of the relevant standard but also the probability of 57 ASIC v Macdonald (No 11) n 55 above at [191]. 58 ibid at [221]-[225]. 59 ASIC v Macdonald (No 12) n 55 above at [75J- [78J. Because the vice in the statement announcing the restructure was that it contained unequivocal statements about the adequacy of the fund, when the board ought to have known that the expert analysis did not support such a definite conclusion. 60 All of the directors were disqualified from being a director for lengthy periods, including 15 years for the CEO and 5 years for the Chairman of the Board: ibid at [317], [354]. 61 Pursuant to the Company Directors Disqualification Act l^öö, s o. © 2010 The Author.

In the UK before 2006 this was limited by the rule in Foss v Harbottle,62 which significantly restricted the right of individual shareholders to bring deriva- tive claims. However the 2006 Companies Act has also made it easier for share- holders to commence litigation for breach of directors' duties. Part 11 of the Act creates a new derivative claim which can only be continued with the court s per- mission, and it puts the decision about whether it is in the best interests of the company for litigation to be commenced in the hands of the court, ie an indepen- dent party The factors that would normally doom a derivative claim under the rule in Foss v Harbottle, for example the possibility of ratification by the share- holders, are now only one factor that the court takes into account in deciding whether to grant permission for the litigation to continue.63 The emergence of corporate governance codes has also added to the incentives corporations have to obtain legal advice and provide complete instructions to their lawyers. Policy makers and interested parties have put a lot of work into producing corporate governance codes which set out 'best practices', and the result in the UK is the Combined Code on Corporate Governance. The code applies only to publicly listed companies and its essential features remain voluntary, but it also contains concrete reporting rules. Specifically, there is a comply or explain rule in relation to the code. The Financial Services Authority Listing Rule 9.8.6 requires a company to confirm that it complies with the Code's provisions or give reasons for its non-compliance. Equally importantly the Code, and the work that went into its development, has been influential in the reforms to the Companies Act and the courts' interpretation of directors' duties at common law.64 One aspect of the Code that has significance to the debate on corporate privilege is that it requires companies to adopt internal risk management and audit systems includ- ing financial, operational and compliance controls.65 The Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control (which is annexed to the Code) provides guidance to companies on how to apply the Code and defines the 'Elements of a sound system of internal control' as follows: [T]he policies, processes, tasks, behaviours and other aspects of a company that, taken together: • [help] the safeguarding of assets from inappropriate use or from loss and fraud and ensuring that liabilities are identified and managed; • help ensure the quality of internal and external reporting . . . • help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.66 Once again, the need to obtain legal advice as part of compliance and risk man- agement measures is so obvious it hardly needs stating. Being voluntary, the Code is unlikely to exert much influence over directors' decision-making regarding 62 (1843) 67 ER 189 (Chi. ~~~ 63 2006 Companies Act, s 261, 263. 64 Davies n 30 above 492. 65 Main Principle C2 and Code Provision C.2.1, n 7 above. 66 Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control para 19, at http://www.frc.org.uk/corporate/internal control. cfm (last visited 19 January 2010). © 2010 The Author.

However if corporations establish risk management systems, including legal compliance controls, in accor- dance with the Code this should have the effect of reducing the number and severity of legal breaches in the first place. But could the argument that a corporate privilege is unnecessary because com- panies already have sufficient incentives to obtain accurate legal advice be criti- cised as naive? The agents of a company are, after all, fallible human beings, and corporate agents have significant personal career and economic incentives, and social pressures, to put the success of the company above everything else. As far the legal analysis is concerned, such criticism only holds if we ignore the fact that the individuals are acting not on their own behalf, but as agents of the entity, and in that capacity they are subject to a combination of binding rules and standards (as well as Voluntary' codes) that place a premium on legal compliance. From a practical point of view it may strike business people as naive to think that direc- tors and senior managers would always seek legal assistance and advice about the company's affairs, and give complete and accurate instructions, even in the knowl- edge that the advice and instructions will be the first thing government regulators or their opponents look to should a matter become the subject of an investigation or legal dispute. So much may be true for some corporate managers, at least at present. Eventually, however, if the standards imposed on directors and managers are clear, and the consequences of non-compliance are equally clear and serious, there will come a point when corporate directors accept that seeking accurate and complete legal advice is something that they must do as a matter of course. No doubt the vast majority of directors already take this view. The position of employees Any assessment of the value of corporate privilege must take into account the interests of company employees. In many cases the information which might affect the company's legal position is held by ordinary employees, hence their co-operation is crucial if companies are to obtain accurate legal advice about the company's affairs. But how significant is the privilege to ordinary employees deciding whether to co-operate with corporate counsel and talk candidly about what they know, or did, or witnessed? The privilege's role in securing employees' co-operation and candor is probably negligible when compared with the ordin- ary obligations, pressures and incentives to co-operate with management that are part of any employment relationship. Arguably, an employee needs no more rea- son to talk to the lawyer than an order from her superiors to talk. The main instance where an employee might be reluctant to co-operate with or talk candidly to corporate counsel is where they have some personal interest in the issue and potential criminal or civil liability. This is the quintessential scenario in which a promise of confidentiality can play an active role in encouraging the employee to talk candidly. But it is precisely in these circumstances that the cor- porate privilege is of questionable value to the employee. For in the case of corporate privilege, the confidence' does not belong to any individual corporate agent but to the entity itself, and the power to waive privilege over communications resides © 2010 The Author.

In practice, this means that the fate of a communication rests not with the employee who made it, but with their superiors, or their colleagues, or future boards, or administrators representing hostile creditors. The fact that the individual employee who communicates information to the company lawyer does not have control over the communication is bound to make employees less rather than more likely to talk candidly to the company lawyer if they have any concerns about their own legal position. One writer has suggested that corporate privilege can still serve its intended purposes if the employee is under the (mistaken) belief that they can keep the information confidential.67 However, basic principles of fairness require that employees are warned that what they tell the company lawyer could be disclosed without their permission and used against them in court. The privilege should not 'become a trap' for employees who, believing that their communications are confidential, incriminate themselves before persons who might use the admis- sions to their own advantage.68 Nor is this prospect far-fetched where the cor- poration and the individual are both potentially liable to criminal or civil sanctions, and there is a real conflict of interest. This is true of tort law, where each tortfeasor has an interest in minimising their own liability by maximising the liability of other tortfeasors, although all tortfeasors will normally have a com- mon interest in denying liability. But it can also be true of criminal liability in practice, where corporations might 'plea bargain with regulators, seeking lenient treatment in exchange for co-operating with investigations into corporate employees. Indeed, this practice was once common in the US, when the Depart- ment of Justice had a policy of regularly demanding corporations waive privilege over internal investigations and witness statements in return for lenient treatment in prosecuting decisions and sentencing applications.69 The fact that corporations almost always acceded to such requests or 'threw their employees to the regulatory wolves', as the editors of the US treatise Federal Practice and Procedure graphically put it,70 highlights the limited nature of the protection corporate privilege provides individual managers and employees. The DOJs policy was highly controversial and the American Bar Association and corporate interest groups successfully lobbied the Government and the Congress to curtail the practice.71 Yet the underlying cause of the problem is not a regulator flex- ing its muscles, but the rule that the privilege belongs to the entity and not the employee who communicates the information. So long as this remains the rule there will always be the prospect of those controlling the corporation hanging their employees or former employees out to dry if they decide it is in the entity's interests to disclose the employee's communications. Accordingly, responsible corporate counsel should warn employees that the privilege over their communications 67 T.

Alexan- ders 1989 study found this was already a common practice.72 The corporate waiver problem may be amenable to a technical solution. It has long been the case that the privilege can be held by more than one person, either as joint clients or because they share a common interest.73 Sexton has argued that this rule should be adapted to the company-employee relationship so that a cor- poration could not waive privilege unless the employee who communicated the confidential information also agreed to waive privilege.74 However, the joint and common interest privileges have their own problems when applied in corporate contexts. Joint interest privilege protects the communications of clients who jointly retain a lawyer. Many corporations would be reluctant to have their law- yers loyalties divided between them and the employee, especially where there is a conflict of interest. There is also Court of Appeal authority that a claim for com- mon interest privilege cannot be maintained in the case of a conflict.75 Secondly, the joint and common interest privilege creates a shared zone of privacy in which the clients can take advice, consistently with this principle, while the privilege prevents the communications from being disclosed to third parties, so that the privilege cannot be asserted in disputes between the parties.76 The possibility of corporations relying on confidential communications by their employees in legal disputes with those very employees once again highlights the fact that a corporate privilege is likely to have a limited if not negligible role in encouraging candour on the part of the employee where a conflict of interest exists. Small and medium sized enterprises Assuming that the corporate law and governance changes discussed above do reduce the need for a privilege for large corporations, does this analysis also apply to small companies? The short answer is that it does, but certainly not to the same degree. Section 174 of the Companies Act makes clear that the standard of care and diligence required of directors will vary depending on the function carried out by the director in relation to the company. It follows that the more important the function a director performs in relation to their company the greater the stan- dard of care and skill they will be expected to meet. In many instances the func- tions carried out by directors of small and private companies are more limited than those of directors of large and public companies. Reporting and regulatory requirements often impose less stringent obligations on smaller companies, and because their activities are more limited in scope, the matters that directors of small companies need to attend to or take into account are typically more limited 72 Alexander, n 16 above 252. 73 Buttes Gas and Oil Co v Hammer (No 3) [1981] QB 223 CA. 74 J.

Given the lower levels of care and skill required of directors of smaller companies, it would be difficult to sustain an argument that a director of a small company acting reasonably would always obtain advice on all matters affecting the company that have a legal dimension. Similarly the argument that the size, significance and complexity of a corporations' affairs means that they have little choice but to obtain accurate legal advice has less traction in the case of small busi- nesses. Further differences between the standards of conduct required, or expected, of directors of large and small companies can be found in the combined code of corporate governance. The code only applies to publicly listed companies. Small and medium sized companies are normally private, and private companies com- prise the vast bulk of companies on the company register. These factors suggest that small companies have fewer incentives to obtain accu- rate legal advice in the absence of a privilege than is the case for large companies. On the other side of the ledger there are also some disincentives for small compa- nies to talk candidly in lawyer client communications in the absence of a privilege. For many small companies, the interests of the individual can be so intertwined with the corporations interests that the individual may be reluctant to obtain advice regarding the entity's affairs, for fear that what she tells the lawyer about the company could be used against her if the company was compelled to disclose it. In short, if there were no privilege there is a greater risk of reduced candour in the case of small companies compared to large companies. There are a number of creative solutions to minimise the risk of chilled can- dour for small companies. Individuals, including a sole proprietor, could continue to obtain advice protected by privilege in their individual capacity. Privilege would even attach if the individual sought advice about the entity's interests, for as Lord Rodger noted in Three Rivers No 6 a client can obtain confidential legal advice about another persons legal affairs.77 In the case of a one-man company no problem of waiver would ever arise, because the agent need not disclose the advice to anyone. In a two- or three-man company the agents could obtain advice as joint clients, and thus all would have the capacity to obtain and consider advice in a shared confidential sphere. However these solutions become less practical as the size of the company increases. If we accept that small companies have fewer incentives to obtain legal advice than large ones, and that there is a risk of reduced candour in lawyer-client com- munications if small companies cannot claim the privilege, the debate on corpo- rate privilege can be taken in several directions. Lawyers' associations argue that because the privilege has value for small corporations, it must be extended to all corporations because it would be undesirable, if not impossible, to decide which companies should or should not have the privilege, and whatever division is ulti- mately drawn would be arbitrary78 Alternatively, it could be argued that small businesses that elect to incorporate, and enjoy the benefits of separate legal person- 77 Three Rivers (No 6)n2 above at [561. 78 The Law Society of Australia advanced this argument in its submission to the Australian Law Reform Commissions review of Client Legal Privilege and Federal Investigatory Bodies, 4 June 2007 at [44]-[45]. © 2010 The Author.

The absence of a privilege is not too great a price to pay for the prize of limited liability. On balance, the latter view seems the better one. For the need effectively to regulate large corporations who wield extensive economic power, which is inhibited by a broad corporate privilege, is a higher priority than affording small corporations the right to obtain legal advice in confidence. A third option is to adopt different privilege rules for small and large corpora- tions. Differential treatment for companies based on their size and type is com- mon in corporate law. The 2006 Companies Act is divided into rules applying to private and public companies, and adopts further distinctions based on the size of the company with special rules for small and medium companies. These classifi- cations also differ depending on the relevant legal requirements. For example, for reporting purposes it is the economic size of the company.79 There are also pro- posals in other areas of law to have different rules for small companies or busi- nesses if there are good policy reasons for granting them greater protection, or reducing regulation. For example, the Law Commission Report in 2005 into unfair contractual terms recommended that micro-businesses enjoy the same pro- tections against unfair contractual terms that are available to individuals, and defines micro-businesses as businesses with nine or fewer employees.80 There is no obvious reason why the law of privilege could not also adopt dif- ferent rules for large and small companies. However, given the policy questions involved about where to draw the line between small and large companies for the purposes of the privilege rule, any such change would need to be introduced by the legislature after careful consideration. Corporate advice privilege and regulatory choices The developments discussed above are designed to foster greater legal compliance, by lifting the standards of behaviour of corporate agents. In practice, this includes requiring company directors and managers to take advice more often and moni- tor legal compliance. The consequence is to render the privilege redundant in many cases, as incentives to encourage voluntary compliance are overtaken by legal obligations to take steps that will maximise the chances of achieving com- pliance. If correct, this analysis raises the possibility of abolishing corporate advice privilege, or significantly limiting its scope, with no adverse impact on the rate of legal compliance in practice. One obvious question is: why does all this matter? Defenders of corporate pri- vilege might suggest that it is possible, and sensible, to rely on both the regulation 79 Companies Act 2006, s 383. A company is classified as small if it meets two of the following cri- teria: i) its annual turnover does not exceed £6.5 million ii) its balance sheet total ie assets does not exceed £93.26 million iii) it has not more than 50 employees. Section 383 also has buffer rules to prevent companies constantly moving between different classifications, and corporate groups as a whole must meet the criteria to prevent them from artificially taking advantage of the less onerous rules. 80 Report No 292 (2005) [14] of the Executive Summary. © 2010 The Author.

This would be true if the privilege was cost free, so that any role it played in encouraging corporate agents to take advice and talk candidly to their lawyers could only increase the chances of achieving greater legal compliance. Unfortunately, however, the privilege comes with significant costs to the administration of justice because it enables clients to suppress sensitive information potentially relevant to civil and criminal proceedings. The result is to make it harder for regulators to enforce the law, and private litigants to enforce (and defend) their rights. It is beyond the scope of this paper to examine the costs of corporate privilege in detail, but some observations are necessary because the costs of privilege cannot be overlooked altogether when examining the rationale for the privilege. As Wigmore famously observed, a privilege can only be justified if the injury that would inure to the relationship by the disclosure of their communications outweighs the benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of litigation.81 The benefits of the privilege must outweigh its costs. For several reasons it is debatable that a corporate advice privilege cast in broad terms would pass Wigmores test. First, the amount of evidence that is lost to a corporate privilege is potentially huge in comparison to the evidence that is lost when individuals assert the privilege. Corporations enjoy perpetual succession, can be registered in multiple jurisdictions at the same time, and can have thousands of agents in numerous loca- tions. Most large corporations generate voluminous internal communications, and communications with third parties, as part of their day to day activities. It would not be hyperbole to describe large corporations as information-processing bureaucracies. Accordingly, corporations tend to acquire much more information and generate many more records than an individual does in the course of their lifetime. Furthermore, corporate activities normally involve larger amounts of money, a broader range of legal issues and greater potential legal liability than individual affairs. Consequently, corporations have more need for legal services than individuals, and provide the bulk of the demand in the legal services mar- ket.82 When these factors are taken together, the amount of records corporations are required to disclose under compulsory processes, and the amount they can claim privilege over, tends to dwarf the disclosure obligations and privilege claims of individuals. Secondly, while there are limits to the scope of privilege which are designed to minimise the loss of evidence, these limits are far less effective when the client is a corporation. The capacity for individuals to suppress evidence is limited princi- pally because the privilege only applies to what is communicated between lawyer and client. The client s knowledge of the underlying facts remains compellable.83 The individual client can only communicate what she knows, and disclosure of such knowledge can be compelled through interrogatories, cross-examination or other compulsory processes. Thus the evidence contained in the lawyer-client communication can still be obtained by other means, and with minimal cost. 81 J. H.

(2010) 73(3) MLR 371-398 393</page><page sequence="24">Legal Advice Privilege and its Relevance to Corporations By contrast, restricting the privilege to communications is much less effective in preventing corporations from suppressing evidence, because corporations have the capacity to structure their corporate knowledge as communications, and transmit the communications through lawyers. In the case of corporations, the line between compellable knowledge and privileged communications can be almost impossible to draw. Corporations acquire information and can act only through their agents, and the act of acquiring and communicating knowledge can be one and the same process: the company's 'knowledge' is principally found in the records obtained or generated by its agents, normally in the form of communica- tions from third parties or communications to other agents in the corporation. It is not difficult to see the temptation for corporate managers to have company records generated by lawyers, or routed through them, for the purposes of creat- ing a privilege claim over sensitive information held by the company. For exam- ple, if a corporate employee communicates information to the company lawyer about a matter, and the lawyer than advises the board about its legal implications, both the employee's communication and the lawyers advice can attract privilege. Of course knowledge of the matter would then reside with both the board and the employee, but it may not qualify as compellable knowledge of the company.While the privilege rule does not protect knowledge of underlying facts, it does attach to any material which evidences or reveals the substance of legal advice, including infor- mation derived from legal advice.84 The rule is designed to allow companies to disseminate the substance of legal advice within the company, and sometimes to third parties, without losing privilege over the legal advice.85 However, the cost is that knowledge obtained by corporate agents from legal advice is also privileged from disclosure. Thus, where a manager's knowledge of certain facts is derived entirely from legal advice from the company lawyer, it is arguable that the man- ager cannot be questioned about her knowledge of the matter, because she could not answer without revealing the substance of legal advice given to the company. One way of avoiding this conundrum is for investigators or opponents to obtain the information from the employee who initially communicated the information to the company lawyer. However the problem with this strategy is that the law does not always attribute the knowledge of ordinary employees to the company, notably in the vexed area of corporate criminal liability.86 Where the knowledge of ordinary employees cannot be attributed to the company, there is the prospect of the privilege giving corporations the power of selective amne- sia.87 Companies can direct the employee to communicate his knowledge to the company lawyer who can then advise management about the issue. Thus man- agement can acquire everything it needs to know about the company's operations, yet conceal that information under the cloak of privilege if its activities are scru- tinised by regulators or become the subject of litigation. Even if the knowledge held by an employee can be attributed to the entity, investigators and opponents face the practical difficulty of identifying the 84 Three Rivers No 6 at [721. 85 USP Strategies v London General Holdings Ltd [2004] EWHC 373 (Ch). 86 Re Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd [19951 2 AC 500. 87 Wright and Graham, n 70 above 161-162. © 2010 The Author.

The employee may no longer work for the entity, or may no longer be available, which is often the case where the relevant events occurred many years ago. Whereas an individual client can always be cross examined in the witness box over their knowledge of the underlying facts, trying to ascertain whether and which employees or former employees in a major corporation hold relevant compellable information can be like trying to find the proverbial needle in a haystack. The rule that a communication must be made for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice or preparing for litigation is designed in part to prevent clients sending information to lawyers for the purpose of generating a privilege claim.88 Merely transmitting information through lawyers is not sufficient to found a claim for privilege. Nonetheless, routing information through lawyers does make it easier for a party to prove as a matter of evidence that the commu- nication was made for the requisite purpose of obtaining legal assistance.89 Cor- porations can also advance a credible argument that 'making sure what we do is legal' is the dominant purpose of every communication filtered through lawyers. Thus a potential weakness of the dominant purpose test is that it allows corpora- tions to legitimately structure their communications in a way that will protect significant parts of its operations from disclosure. Furthermore, a dominant purpose test is likely to provide greater protection to corporations than to individuals in practice, because of differences in the way they interact with lawyers and use legal services. Typically, when an individual consults a lawyer their sole purpose is to get legal advice. By contrast, corporate memor- anda can have a variety of purposes: administrative, commercial and legal. If one of the intended destinations of a corporate memo is the lawyers inbox, should it qualify for privilege? Provided the business purposes do not predominate over the legal purpose of the memo, it will. Nor is the dominant purpose test without evidentiary problems when applied in practice. Regulators and litigants, and ultimately the courts, face the difficulty of trying to ascertain whether the legal purpose of a communication was the minor purpose, the dominant purpose or one of two or more equally important purposes. In many instances this question can only be answered by examining the communication in question. However, it would be unworkable for the courts to carry out in camera inspections for every privilege challenge. Even the content of the communication may not reveal its dominant purpose, and evi- dence needs to be taken from the corporate agents involved in preparing or requesting the communication as to their state of mind at the time. The nature of the privilege rule means there are inherent limitations in the mechanisms available to parties and the court to detect and prevent unfounded privilege claims.90 88 Waugh v British Railways Board [1980] AC 521. 89 A.

(2010) 73(3) MLR 371-398 395</page><page sequence="26">Legal Advice Privilege and its Relevance to Corporations The amount of evidence, including non-legal information, which is lost to a corporate privilege is likely to increase with the advent of multi-disciplinary part- nerships (and alternative business structures), which will be permitted from about 2011 under Part 5 of the Legal Services Act 2007.91 This radical change to the struc- ture of the legal profession will allow lawyers to go into business with other pro- fessional service providers, such as accountants, bankers, insurers and business consultants, while also permitting businesses to offer legal services to their custo- mers. Multi-disciplinary partnerships might offer significant economies of scale for service providers and ultimately lower costs for clients. They may also be very convenient for companies looking for a one-stop shop for their legal, accounting and business consultancy needs. However, they are likely to provide even greater scope for corporations to structure sensitive non-legal information in such a way as to render it privileged, and make the task of assessing privilege claims even more difficult than at present. Clients of these new legal service providers will have the same rights to legal professional privilege that they would have had if they had retained a traditional law firm. According to the Ministry of Justices latest fact sheet about alternative business structures, so long as communications with a multi-disciplinary partnership are carried out through a lawyer or under the supervision and direction of a lawyer, then the ordinary rules of privilege will apply.92 However, the wording of the Act is not so straightforward. The Act creates certain reserved legal activities' that only authorised persons are able to provide,93 and sec- tion 190 ensures that where a non-lawyer in a multi-disciplinary partnership is providing reserved legal services, ie advocacy, litigation, conveyancing or probate services, privilege will still apply if they were working under the supervision of a lawyer. Non-reserved legal services however, including the generation of business contracts and agreements and other general legal advice, can be provided by any- one, with or without a law degree. This will create many unenviable questions for the courts with respect to the rules of privilege: whether and when privilege will apply to lawyers providing such services to their clients, and non-lawyers work- ing with or without qualified lawyers providing the same services. Where lawyers are providing such services the starting point of the inquiry is, of course, whether the communication satisfies the dominant purpose test. But where lawyers are providing 'integrated legal and other professional services'94 identifying the domi- nant purpose of a communication becomes more difficult, if not an exercise in fiction. It seems wishful thinking to believe that the courts will always, or even in most cases, be able to determine whether a company that sends sensitive legal and commercial information to a multi-disciplinary partnership offering a one stop shop' for their client's legal, accounting and commercial consultancy needs, 91 The new Legal Services Board is committed to getting the regulatory framework in place to allow alternative business structures by mid-2011: Legal Services Board, 'Opening the Market for Legal Services' (Press Release) 14 May 2009. 92 Facilitating the provision of these services is one of the purposes of the Act: Ministry of Justice, 'Legal Services Reform Fact Sheet: Alternative Business Structures' 9 June 2008 http: //www. justice.gov.uk/publications/abs-fact-sheet.htm (last visited 20 October 2009). 93 Part 3. 94 n 92 above. © 2010 The Author.

Then there is the controversial question of whether privilege should cover non-lawyers providing legal advice to their clients. In some areas it is already common for non-lawyers to provide legal services. For example, accountants pro- vide advice about tax matters without the protection of privilege, while clients who retain lawyers to provide the same advice can assert a privilege over their communications. This issue has attracted the scrutiny of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which is concerned that where lawyers are in competition with non-law- yers the privilege could distort competition in favour of lawyers. The OFT recommended either a limited extension of the privilege to specified legal ser- vices provided by other professionals (recognising that there was need for these professions to receive adequate training and be bound by similar ethical codes as lawyers) or a reduction in the scope of the privilege.95 The courts are likely to come under significant pressure to extend the privilege to non-lawyers providing legal advice, as one of the regulatory objectives of the Act is to 'promote competi- tion in the provision of [legal] services' including non reserved legal services.96 To the extent that a case for privilege can be made for individuals obtaining legal advice, there seems no reason to discriminate between lawyers and other profes- sionals providing such advice. For corporations however, given the benefits of privilege are marginal and the costs are significant (though difficult to quantify), it seems a reduction in the scope of the privilege is the preferable approach. The possibility that corporations could use the cloak of privilege to avoid dis- closure of large amounts of sensitive information, may have been one of the moti- vating factors for the Court of Appeal ruling in Three Rivers No 5 that not all corporate employees were necessarily part of the client' for the purposes of the pri- vilege rule. The Court's concern to limit the scope of corporate privilege is entirely defensible if one remembers that the corporation in Three Rivers No 5 was a major public body. It is apparent from the Courts judgment that it believed that a national institution like the Bank of England had a public duty to put all relevant information before a major inquiry established by the Government.97 This high- lights another important point in the debate on corporate privilege. Examining the value of a corporate privilege is not just an empirical question. Normatively as a society we must also consider the standards of conduct, transparency and accountability we should demand of corporations and their agents (and public bodies and officials). Stopping public and large private companies from concealing the information that they provide their lawyers and the legal advice that they receive under a cloak of secrecy may be required by, or is at least compatible with, policies designed to ensure more effective regulation of companies. It would cer- tainly reduce the amount of evidence lost to the privilege, and thus make it easier for regulators and third parties to enforce the law and their legal rights respectively. It is also not unreasonable to assume that removing the privilege for larger corpora- 95 Office of Fair Trading, OFT s response to the to consultation paper published by the Lord Chan- cellor's Department 'In the public interest?'

CONCLUSION This article has argued that the empirical case for corporate advice privilege is weak, and that there are sound policy reasons for limiting the scope of corporate privilege. The rule-of-law rationale for legal professional privilege assumes that without a privilege, clients would be less willing to consult a lawyer and talk can- didly to them about their affairs. However, this assumption has less force in advice contexts. Clients who are seeking legal advice unconnected with litigation already have a strong incentive to provide their lawyers with all the relevant facts because their aim is to get accurate legal advice that they can rely on. The circum- stances in which the reduced candor assumption might hold true in advice con- texts are limited and mostly related to the needs and behaviour of individuals. Accordingly, the rule-of-law rationale for privilege has little relevance to corpora- tions, especially large and public corporations. Insofar as the privilege is said to promote compliance by encouraging corporations to obtain advice and speak candidly to counsel, there are many aspects of a company's business that are dependent on obtaining legal assistance and advice. Furthermore, company direc- tors have extremely strong incentives, if not a practical requirement, to obtain accurate advice about the company's affairs when discharging their duties as direc- tors even in the absence of a privilege. To the extent that corporate privilege is said to promote greater compliance by encouraging corporations fully to investigate suspected legal breaches of the law and rectify them, this is already a standard of conduct that can be expected of directors as part of their duties of diligence and care. At the other end of the corporate ladder, employees who may have some per- sonal liability arising out of suspected legal breaches - the quintessential scenario in which a privilege might induce greater candour in the lawyer client-relation- ship - are likely to be less willing to talk candidly to the company lawyer when informed that the privilege belongs to the entity, and can be waived without their permission. On the other hand, employees who have no personal interest in a suspected breach, and are merely witnesses to it, arguably need no more incentive to talk to the lawyer than an order from their superiors. Finally, the standards of conduct that we impose on corporations and their agents, including standards of transparency and accountability, are ultimately a matter of policy. Taking into account the trend towards more effective regulation of companies, and the costs of corporate privilege, there are good policy reasons for restricting the right of companies, especially large and publicly listed companies, to claim legal advice privilege. The courts ought to focus on these issues when considering the rationale and scope of corporate privilege, rather than relying on analogies between the interests of testators drawing up a will and the interests of major corporations and public bodies. © 2010 The Author.
