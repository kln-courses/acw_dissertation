<plain_text><page sequence="1">The BRITISH ART Journal Volume IX, No. 1 Hogarth's Mackinen Children Arthur S Marks The William not Mackinen received Hogarth's any Children finest extended full-length (PI 1) consideration.1 is admired portraits, as but Besides one it has of William Hogarth's finest full-length portraits, but it has not received any extended consideration.1 Besides questions about the sitters identities and the work's proper dating, it is appropriate to ask how this richly devised work containing likenesses of a young man and woman at a partic- ular moment in their youth might have been understood in its own time. Although there is only limited documentation for the painting, sufficient information and internal clues exist to permit, indeed even to encourage, discussion on these various points. What emerges as a result is a picture of considerable content and consequence. As was no doubt intended, The Mackinen Children is foremost a portrait, the animated likenesses of some beloved offspring. Going beyond their appearances and depending on the knowledge and experiences that a viewer brought to the work, it also could function for its various audiences, whether for Hogarth as the maker, the sitters, the patron or some other spectator, as a narrative and allegory of some complexity. Drawing upon diverse sources, on an acquaintance with visual, oral, and tex- tual sources, including in this last category scientific writings, literature and most notably emblem books, the artist and his viewers could find in this painting a variety of personal and public moralizing meanings, pertinent presumably to their various lives.2 At the same time, reflecting a particular situa- tion in British history, it also possessed a highly personal significance for these Mackinens and for those acquainted with the recent record of their clan, Clan Fingon. Depicted are two adolescents on a terrace adjoining a neo- classical English country house, apparently of no particular identity or location. To the right stands an elegantly clad young man, dressed in breeches, frock coat and waistcoat. He has been reading and his left arm with an opened book in hand is seen extended behind him. Now he is momentarily diverted by the sight of a butterfly about to alight on a potted sunflower. With his free hand he reaches out and seeks to capture the insect. His sudden movement has aroused the attention of his companion, an equally elegantly garbed young woman seated at the left, wearing a pointed bodice, half-sleeves with ruffles, a skirt and apron, and a day cap.3 Possibly out of her own interest in the butterfly or in response to his pursuit, she abruptly rises from her chair. Portending disaster, the resulting distraction is causing the collection of shells she has been otherwise examining to slide unnoticed from her lap, from the folds in her apron.4 At the lower right a small dog sits. Likewise, its attention has been arrested by the commotion over the butterfly towards which it now glances. Finally, all are bathed in a pleasant warming sunlight that plays across the scene on what must be a won- derful English summer's day. Family records identify the subjects as the children of William Mackinen, a planter and lawyer from the West Indian island of Antigua. Members of the Highland clan of Mackinen or Fingon, they traced their lineage most immediately to Donald Mackinen, the second son of Lachlan Mohr Mackinen, 28th chief of the clan.5 Reportedly, Donald had fled the ancestral home, Strathsaid on the Isle of Skye, fol- lowing an altercation with his father on the hunting field. Being a younger son, however, it is more likely that, denied any inheritance by the rules of primogeniture, he departed in search of adventure and good fortune elsewhere. Eventually, he found his way to the Caribbean and certainly was settled on Antigua by 1693, the year when the first of his several land grants was recorded.6 In time Donald became an important local political power, his authority aided by a wealth estab- lished from sugar cane, the island's most valuable crop. His status was enhanced by his marriage in or before 1696 to Elizabeth Thomas, daughter of Colonel John Thomas, anoth- er sugar planter and leader of the island's militia. To this couple several children were born, different accounts pro- viding different numbers: the primary heir, their eldest son William, the father of Hogarth's sitters, appeared in 1697. Donald Mackinen died in 1720, aged 67, and was buried on the island. About eight years after succeeding to his father's estates, William Mackinen made an advantageous local marriage. His wife Charity was the second daughter of the then governor, William Yeamans. The pair had four children, and it is the two eldest of these that Hogarth is said to have painted: Elizabeth who was baptized at St John's church, Antigua in May 1729, and her brother, named William like his father and baptized in the same church in February 1732. 7 These details are put forward in various genealogical volumes, reflecting family recollections, and there seems no reason to question them. Similarly, as will be seen, knowledge of various aspects of the family's circumstances lends support to dating the picture around 1747, the time most commonly assigned it in these records, when, like the children depicted, William was prob- ably aged fifteen and his sister eighteen.8 Presumably Hogarth executed The Mackinen Children in London and from the life. It could have been done from miniatures sent abroad for that purpose, a not uncommon practice, especially for those situated in places without access to a painter of any decent abilities, such as Antigua. Yet the composition's dramatic and unitary quality together with the sense of location and the solid quality of the likenesses seem to attest to an immediate access to the sitters, though perhaps not for as long as the artist might have preferred.9 For Hogarth this only could have been obtained in England in his London painting rooms. No documented journey to the capital by the Mackinens is known at this time in the mid- to late- 1740s. But this lack of hard evidence should not be regarded as precluding such a visit. For the parents and their sort, wealthy colonial settlers, the occasional voyage 'home', as Britain was commonly referred to, whether for social or commercial reasons was not at all unusual.10 Similarly, it was far from uncommon for offspring, generally the males, but at times the daughters as well, to accompany their parents or even to be sent unaccompanied to the care of a relative, friend or business agent for further education or profession- al and business training. In the case of Elizabeth there is also the possibility that, beyond any edifying benefits that might accrue, she, like many young women of her class, would have come in order to widen the pool of possible suitors for her hand.11 Just as we do not know the actual circumstances of the commission, the intended destination of the painting also remains unknown. On the likely assumption that it was 38</page><page sequence="2">Volume IX, No.l The BRITISH AKT Journal directly commissioned by the parents or, if they were not present in England, that the immediate patron was someone acting on their behalf, in all probability the portrait eventual- ly returned to the Mackinen home on Antigua, though when is also undetermined. In London, whether available in Hogarth's painting room or subsequently in the Mackinen's chambers during their brief stay abroad, it would have found only a limited audience. Certainly, it is not known to have been exhibited. Once, installed back on Antigua, The Mackinen Children was of course available to the family and, other than servants and menials who passed through the house, it would have been seen primarily by other members of the same privileged planter class, who not only would have recognized the sitters, and been privy to their various family dynamics, but were perhaps even sufficiently educated to be capable of distinguishing the different allusions devised for William and Elizabeth's representation, the recreation of which is the task of the present essay. Eventually, probably in the latter half of the century, on the assumption that the painting sequentially remained with the two Williams, it pre- sumably returned to England, for both father and son eventually settled there: the father sometime before 1767, the year he died at Bath, and in the 1780s, William the younger, who in 1757 had married an Englishwoman, Elizabeth Vernon, retired to Berkshire. As for Elizabeth, she married another islander and remained on Antigua until her death, also sometime in the 1760s.12 As for the representation, the shells in her lap that Elizabeth has been examining could have been included as a reference to the children's West Indian origins and their cur- rent presence on what was for them foreign soil. Pictorially, such accumulations of oddly shaped, colourful and even valuable shells often serve as geographical ciphers, especial- ly for tropical America. They were recognized and appreciated as tangible relics of distant and often curious places. As fitting bits of imported exotica, reflective of a nation's imperial and commercial interests, they appear quite frequently in still-lifes and are included amongst the mirabil- ia in depictions of Kunst - and Wunderkammern . 13 More appropriate perhaps, in their specificity of reference is the occasional use of shells as an attribute of the Indian Princess who frequently symbolizes America in representations of the four continents (PI 2). 14 Like her and like the shells, William and Elizabeth also might be regarded as rare specimens, curios plucked from a tropical American sea or shore and then sent abroad to be displayed and admired. Certainly, and regardless of whether it was hung eventually in Antigua or Britain, the painting would testify to their exotic origins. The sunflowers too may signify their distant origins. First introduced into Europe from the Americas by the Spanish in the 16th century, the sunflower, also know as the Indian Sunflower, the golden flower of Peru, or Flower of the Sonne, quickly obtained widespread popularity amongst gardeners and herbalists.15 A partial testimony to its successful trans- plantation and popularity is its inclusion in numerous horticultural manuals, such as Gerard's Herhall (1st edition 1597) or in compilations of botanical plates, including Crispin de Passse's Hortus Floridus (PI 3), who describes them, like the sitters, as being among the 'rarest and excel- lentest flowers'. Conceived in part as an artist's manual, the de Passe volume first appeared in Utrecht in 1614 and promptly went into an English edition the following year as A Garden of Flowers. These volumes and others of a similar sort, usually with bold engravings awaiting hand colouring, retained their popularity well into the 18th century, often being reprinted to meet a continuing demand.16 In Hogarth's composition the sunflowers, cultivated in 1 The Mackinen Children by William Hogarth (1697-1764), 1747.

Staatsgemäldesammlungen, Munich pots, ostensibly function as a terrace ornament and initially would seem to possess no significance beyond being decora- tive or functioning as a geographical cipher. Their decorative role seems confirmed by the diverting presence of a second plant in the right background, somewhat hidden in shadow. Through duplication the latter seems to lessen any potential importance of its foreground companion and to confirm their decorative role. Yet, compositionally, the foreground sunflower is deliberately positioned. Not only is it central to the composition, but it receives further emphasis as well through the introduction of the settling butterfly. A small story now unfolds, and no matter whether it is the Mackinen children, the rising girl and the reading boy, or the dog from within or the viewer from without the picture, all are induced to focus their gaze on the butterfly about to alight on the large golden bloom. What Hogarth has done is to introduce 39</page><page sequence="3">The BRITISH ART Journal Volume IX, No. 1 a distraction and grant the painting an animated dramatic quality. Anecdotally, focusing on shells, sunflowers and the butterfly, the painting depicts the interests and distractions of these privileged children. In the seeking description to go beyond of any the readily identification evident narrative of the sitters appear- and the description of any readily evident narrative appear- ances, it is the three subsidiary yet compositionally prominent objects cited, the shells, sunflowers and butterfly, considered singly and in combination that provide access to the extended meanings of the painting. Through these objects and the various associations they arouse, several alle- gorical conceits have been introduced that complement and enhance understanding of the picture. To attempt to define limits for such readings would be futile, but working with these objects as symbols, constructions of meaning are pos- sible that are viable and reasonable, largely because they remain close to the image and to the little that is known about the lives of Elizabeth and William at this time. Certainly it appears that on his own or in conjunction with the pro- grammatic requirements of his sitters or patron, the latter most likely the parents, Hogarth incorporated a series of readings that takes The Mackinen Children beyond the anec- dotal. He drew upon a medley of sources, on art-historical traditions, on a knowledge of academic and professional texts as well as on images and ideas from the diverse materi- al of a culture shared by the artist and his audience, the Mackinen family included, who despite their residence in the West Indies remained part of a cosmopolitan English culture. The sunflower, bold in its positioning and scale, seems the best point of entry in reconstructing the allegories present. By the mid-18th century, the sunflower, the Tromba d'Amore , as de Passe referred to it, had become a well-established symbol for love. The source for its meaning lay in antiquity and was best know from the legend of the nymph Clytie as related in Ovid's Metamorphoses (iy 265-70). Through her focused but unrequited passion of the sun god, Apollo, upon whose face she daily gazed, Clytie was eventually transformed into a flower, the heliotrope (or tournesol or girasole), whose blos- som as the name implies turns ever skywards in a search for her beloved. Commonly, when illustrating this legend, it was the sunflower, with its large and finely formed brown head and flame-like surrounding golden pets, its corona, that artists consistently preferred to represent.17 From the Renaissance onwards literary references to the heliotrope regularly recur, notable in the emblem literature, where its meanings were expanded, codified and, most importantly, it was given an accompanying visual invention.18 From such published sources the sunflower as symbol received especially wide distribution and had a profound and continuing effect. The flower came to represent not just romantic love, but devotion and faithfulness, with the requi- site variety of expression being determined by the recognition of to whom or what this affection was directed and the particular situation in which it was included.19 Given a sacred gloss it also could imply a deep and abiding faith marked by a profession of passion for God.20 Profanely, the sunflower also came to denote an erotic love, as for example in Otto Vaenius Amorum Emblemata (Pi 4), well known in editions in many different languages.21 In a similar vein and addressed more particularly to an English audience it appears in Philip Ayre's 1683 pastiche of Vaenius, Cupid's Addresse to the Ladies, Emblemata Amatoria , which was several times republished in the early 18th century.22 Codified, these various metaphoric meanings persisted and flourished and through the course of time and the cross- ing of national boundaries, new details appropriate to partic- ular circumstances would further accumulate and could be applied to an understanding of the different usages. Poets were quick to exploit the expanded possibilities the heliotrope offered as these lines from James Thomson's epic poem The Seasons , from Summer', first published in 1727 testify: But one, the follower of the sun, they say, Sad when he sets, shuts up her yellow leaves, Weeping all night; and, when he warm returns Points her enamour'd bosom to his ray.2^ For painters the sunflower as an affirmation of love came to be included in portraits, history paintings, still-lifes, and genre scenes, again most notably in the Netherlands where this emblematic expression remained especially strong. Just as the sunflower always turns toward the sun, so too a per- son could turn towards the divine, to a lover, a friend or, as in The Mackinen Children , a sibling.24 Given its placement and very distinct configuration with two blooms extending from the same plant and with each directed towards one of the siblings, the elder the girl, who is seen in reference to the larger, more mature bloom, the sunflower seems to serve foremost as a confirmation of the children's relationship. The same stem joins together broth- er and sister, and would seem to indicate filial affection and admiration and coming from the same vital source, a mutual dependence, all qualities encouraged by their presence abroad, especially if they had travelled there alone. Since it serves as a common bond, the sunflower could have been included as a sign of their parents, as a surrogate for those who properly offer them succour and support, and whose actual heartening gaze and uniting warm embrace already was or eventually would be greatly distanced by space or time as the pair matured and pursued their respective lives. Under whatever circumstances The Mackinen Children was com- missioned, it would have served as an aide mémoire , as a reminder of these progeny absent from home for whatever the reason and through time of their once glowing youth. Recalling family portraits where children flank their parents, the sunflower here assumed the role of the concerned, adorning and nurturing mother and father. It draws their attention to itself and in turn offers them a rewarding and heartening glow. If the sunflower's presence as a substitute for the elder Mackinens has validity as an interpretation, it is tempting to suggest that the picture was encouraged by a particular his- torical occurrence, a tragedy from which the family would have been saved. In August 1747, the year assigned the por- trait by family accounts, a massed merchant fleet of 120 vessels, many with passengers aboard, sailed for England from the Leeward Islands, the chain that includes Antigua. At sea the next month a horrendous gale was encountered and the loss of people and goods was enormous. Only 35 ships finally reached England.25 Perhaps the Mackinen children had sailed with this convoy and were among the survivors. If so, regardless of whether they had travelled abroad on their own or in the company of their parents, though the former possi- bility seems to make the best sense, it is tempting to propose that Hogarth's painting was executed to celebrate their deliv- erance, the intention being that it would be sent home eventually as a testament to their safe arrival. Such a possi- bility for motivating the commission is not otherwise substantiated, but it is one of those instances when an actual historical occurrence seems to provide a tempting explana- tion for the genesis of this family portrait. Similarly, even if the Mackinens were not personally involved in this, tragedy, 40</page><page sequence="4">Volume EX, No. 1 The BRITISH ART Journal 3 Sunflower, Crispin de Passse Hortus Floridus, Utrecht, 1614 (London, 1615) 4 Otto Vaenius, Amorum Emblemata, edn 1618 the event may have suggested the precariousness of colonial life and been sufficient to encourage the commission. The presence of the children's loyal companion, the dog, hints at themes of devotion. By the mid- 18th century the dog existed as a ubiquitous, even trite sign of fidelity. Indeed, hav- ing been exhaustively utilized over several centuries, it had become such a cliché that at times it seemed to lose its estab- lished meaning and could be included and recognized for what it actually was, a dog and companion. Hogarth, howev- er, rejoiced in the animal. His dogs are frequently endowed with anthropomorphic qualities and mimic the actions and foibles of any accompanying humans.26 In conversation pieces the dog could be incorporated as here, in an ordinary and humane manner, yet maintaining through its casual inclusion the traditional references to a loyalty and constan- cy born of reciprocated love and friendship. Although the sunflower boldly confronts the viewer, for the Mackinens in the painting it is merely an incidental terrace ornament until suddenly the butterfly intrudes and draws their (and our) attention. On one level the butterfly possess- es a straightforward narrative role: it serves to animate the figures and unites their various glances, directing them to the bloom, the place were momentarily it will settle. The butter- fly's affinity for flowers was a commonplace realization. If one were sensitive to such a phenomenon in nature, as Hogarth and the Mackinens apparently were, then that relationship could be directly observed, but butterflies and flowers were everywhere encountered in natural history illustrations, in the decorative arts, and in that category of still-life generally referred to as flower pieces. Again such paintings were espe- cially favoured in Holland, but they also had a considerable popularity in Britain.27 No previous representation seems directly to conjoin the butterfly with a sunflower, but such a combination remains a reasonable derivative from the evi- dence of other recurring juxtapositions, enough of them in any case to suggest its inclusion here. When included in paintings such displays of flowers and 5 Boy with a mousetrap. Engraving after Adriaen van der Werff (1659-1722) insects, through the presentation of a broad range of forms and colours, often served to exhibit and confirm the variety of nature's creative powers. Furthermore, anticipating their combined, dispersed, presence in The Mackinen Children , these flower-pieces also frequently include an assortment of shells as if to stress their embracing theme. It seems reason- able that the metaphor of creation present in those compositions could extend to the children who are therefore included among the beauties being displayed, all being part of nature's broad spectrum of possibilities. Indeed, in this assemblage it is even reasonable to assert that the central sunflower was meant to serve as a surrogate for the artist, for Hogarth himself as the prevailing creative force. Presumably Hogarth was well award of the established links between the sunflower and the artist, the former serving as a sign for the latter in both painting and literature.28 Just as the parents' love illuminates the children basking in their radiant light, and the lover sheds light on the beloved, so too does the sun as a sunflower illuminate nature in all its variety and beauty. And it is the painter, in turn, as a creator, who reveals these phenomena on the canvas, offering them to the light of day for all to witness. In 'The Universe', first published in 1726, Henry Baker made reference to this kind of exposure: See, to the Sun the BUTTERFLY displays It's glittering Wings, and wantons in his Rays: In Life exulting, o'er the Meadows flies, Sips from each Flow'r, and breathes the vernal Skies. Its splendid Plumes, in graceful Order, show The various Glories of the painted Bow.29 41</page><page sequence="5">The BRITISH ART Journal Volume EX, No.l 6 'Of the Boy and Butter Fly' by John Bunyan, Book for Boys and Girls (1686], vignette in edition of 1724 7 Roemmer Visscher, 'Tis misselijck waer een geek zijn gelt aen leijť, with engraving by Claes Janz, Sinnepoppen, 1614 Fixed while in the its Mackinens, pot, the foreground the dog, and sunflower the butterfly, is a static all active, form, while the Mackinens, the dog, and the butterfly, all active, suggest a sense of animation. Having such a still presence the flower remains oddly unobtrusive and its initial significance, the associative meanings just discussed, could be over- looked. Should that occur, despite its small scale, the hovering butterfly to which all are drawn offers another means of entering into the drama of the painting, into the unfolding narrative. From a consideration of the butterfly and its symbolic possibilities other readings of the painting emerge all of which remain complementary and appropriate to the allusion already identified and developed. Foremost, given Williams momentary preoccupation with the insect and his reaching gesture, there is the motif of the butterfly chase. In painting prior to Hogarth this theme appears infrequently and when seeking a fitting comparison for the boy's action it is necessary to look instead to such a variant as Adrien van der Werff 's Boy with a Mousetrap of the early 1680s (Pi 5). 30 Distracted, William Mackinen has disre- garded his own task, his reading, to pursue the ephemeral, much as van der Werff 's neglectful figure wistfully looks towards the butterflies circling in the air before him. If uncommon in painting, in England, the butterfly chase had achieved especially widespread recognition and circulation as a literary image, and was sometimes even illustrated.31 Used as a moralizing device, it came to represent the futility of searching and reaching for the unobtainable or the pursuit of some gaudy, worthless or transitory pleasure. Such a didactic statement is found in 'Of the Boy and Butter-fly': a poem from John Bunyan's Book for Boys and Girls , first issued in 1686, frequently reprinted, and accompanied sometimes by a vignette, as in the 1724 edition (PI 6). 32 Still closer in time to Hogarth is Thomas Foxton's 'On a Boy's pursuing a Butterfly as he was going to school', included in his popular Moral Songs for the use of Children , initially published in 1728. The pertinent stanzas, well illustrating the intended adage, read: And now it lighted on a Flower, And seem'd as just within his Power; The gave a sudden active Spring, Andn Mounted glitt'ring on the Wing. And While thus the fond impatient Boy Sought to obtain his painted Joy, He tir'd his little busy Feet, And gain'd but Weariness and Sweat. Besides, the Time so far was gone, He was afraid to venture on; He durst not see his Master's Face, Nor answer for his silly Chace. Now attention is drawn to the moral of the lesson: Thus persons more advane'd in Years When some deceitful Charm appears, Forget their great and main Design; And with the gay Temptation join. Tho' Matters of the greatest Weight Call for a present wise Debate; They after glittering Trifles fly, That still deceive, tho' never nigh.33 If the butterfly chase represents the futile pursuit of some- thing of transitory value, then a complementary conceit can be read in the seashells. Her attention having been distract- ed by the appearance of the butterfly, Elizabeth carelessly rises and momentarily neglects her shells, and her prized col- lection of rarities slides unnoticed from her lap, seemingly fated for destruction as it falls to the ground. From her excite- ment, her captivation by the beautiful and alluring butterfly, comes misfortune. Admired as they might have been as sci- entific specimens or as tactile objects of exotic beauty, such a collection of shells could also represent an indulgence, a risky investment in something fragile and possessed perhaps of only passing value. Roemmer Visscher's emblem book Sinnepoppen , includes a device reflective of this sentiment (PI 7). Illustrated are several shells awash on a beach, the implication being that this assemblage could easily be lost, swept out to sea on the next wave. The accompanying motto reads 'Tis misselijck waer een geek zijn gelt aen leijť ('It is astonishing what use a fool can make of his money').34 Recalling the ostentatious and often uniformed faddish enthusiasms of many English virtuosi, there are several depictions of shell collectors fondling and displaying their treasures of which Hogarth and those who saw The Mackinen Children may have been aware. An English exam- ple is the 1645 double portrait of John Tradescant the Younger with his colleague Roger Friend, a painting attrib- uted to Emmanuel de Critz (Pi 8). Tradescant had inherited a shell collection from his father of the same name, which, through the beneficence of Elias Ashmole, eventually made its way to Oxford University together with the remainder of their Cabinet Of Varieties.35 Besides serving as self-aggrandiz- ing images, as testaments to their wealth, presumed intelligence and taste, such likenesses seem able to absorb an emblematic admonition of the sort that Visscher offers, no matter whether it was included as an original and intentional part of their content or supplied as a subsequent overlay by a knowledgeable viewer.36 Lurking behind these lavish displays may be a warning, a caution to avoid the dangers of beguiling appearances and the seductive powers of superficial charms. Consequently, in The Mackinen Children , with each child preoccupied, he reading while she apparently examines and admires her collection, much as these earlier collectors had been portrayed, and then with both suddenly diverted and inexorably drawn together by the glimpses of the butterfly, the young lady's shells are threatened with ruin. Her impending disaster as she rises is an appropriate adjunct to his distraction, although for William the immediate risk seems almost negligible for apparently he has nothing tangible to lose. Yet the concern of each echoes the other and informs the sitter or viewer of the risks to be encountered when pursuing such fleeting pleasures. Assembled together, these elements, the flowers, -butterfly 42</page><page sequence="6">Volume IX, No. 1 The BRITISH ART Journal 8 John Tradescant with Roger Friend attributed to Emmanuel de Critz (1607-53). Oil on canvas, 107 x 132 cm. Ashmolean Museum, Oxford and shells, also point to a long established and widely recog- nized allegorical theme, that of vanitas , of the fragility and temporality of human existence, a condition infrequently noticed by exuberant distracted youths.37 Like people's lives, blooms will eventually fade, butterflies flourish only briefly, and shells are soon emptied of the life that dwelled within them. Beautiful but empty, the shells assume a role analo- gous to that of the human skull or skeletal elements often found in such compositions.38 They are objects for contem- plation, reminders of man's transitory presence on earth and in nature. Although most commonly found in still-lifes, the vanitas theme is also found in portraits. For example, it seems to have penetrated another of Hogarth's full-sized child-portraits, The Graham Children , 1742 (Pi 9). 39 However, the Graham children are young and the accompa- nying devices are drawn from the nursery, from within the house, with the Mackinens are on the brink of adulthood and their interests reflect an interest in the world at large, on the outside. Indeed, The Machinen Children can be considered within the context of a particular sort of vanitas composi- tion, a topos that has been identified as a form of reminder, as the offering of behavioral advice to young gentlemen, especially to students distant from home. Forewarned, the young scholar could avoid the temptations that could divert him from his studies and the virtuous path he should travel.40 Such cautions would be equally applicable to young women like Elizabeth who were abroad in similar circumstances.41 Thus, regardless of whether it was addressed to these par- ticular sitters situated far from home and from a parent's settling hand, or if it was seen by other rising adults, The Machinen Children could be regarded as a call for a serious- ness of purpose in plotting the course of one's life. In several details, Hogarth's painting also might have been intended to proffer advice on a more directly practical level. It might be regarded as a warning about the dangers of material plea- sures and earthly delights, the ordinary and everyday temptations that could befall and easily divert a young man or woman from a considered and marked course of study and behaviour. Hogarth's various narrative series, for exam- ple, A Harlot 's Progress (1732), A Rake's Progress (1735) and Industry and Idleness (1747) certainly have a comparable didactic function.42 They warn of the pitfalls to be encoun- tered through life and advise of the virtues and skills to be encouraged, cultivated and learned in order to survive and flourish. Cautionary advice, which in its specific concerns is espe- cially well contrasted with The Machinen Children , is found in some contemporary letters the Earl of Chesterfield 9 The Graham Children by William Hogarth, 1742. Oil on canvas, 160.5 x 181 cm. National Gallery, London addressed to his bastard and distant son. Extensive in num- ber and consequently wider ranging in their interests, they are also more precise and detailed in their instruction. In at least one striking instance, though presented for opposite purposes, a letter and the painting share common motifs. Writing in July 1748, Chesterfield inveighed against a 'lazy mind'. He advised: . . . But those things which every gentlemen independently of pro- fession, should know, he ought to know well and dive into all the depth of them: such are languages, history, and geography, ancient and modern, philosophy, rational logic, rhetoric; and, for you particularly, the constitutions, and the civil and military state of every country in Europe. This, I confess is a pretty large circle of knowledge, attended with some difficulties, and requiring some trouble; which, however, an active and industrious mind will overcome, and be amply repaid. The trifling and frivolous mind is always busied, but to little purpose; it takes little objects for great ones, and throws away upon trifles that time and atten- tion, which only important things deserve. Knick-knacks, butterflies, shells insects, insects, etc., are the subjects of their most serious researches. They contemplate the dress, not the characters of the company they keep. They attend more to the decoration of a play than the sense of it; and to the ceremonies of a court more than to its politics. Such an employment of time is an absolute loss of it.43 Chesterfield had definite professional ambitions for his son, foreseeing a role for him, he seems to suggest above, as a diplomat. Certainly the textually directed course of study with its antiquarian emphases that he recommended as nec- essary preparation for this calling held no real place for the Lockean experiential sorts of tuition with their emphasis on the acquisition of useful knowledge that were then gradually entering into newer more progressive curricula. Notably this occurred through the study of Natural Philosophy, through the personal observation of those natural phenomena nega- tively represented by Chesterfield's cynical references to such sciences as lepidology and conchology, the very fields that seem to draw The Machinen Children , fields which had 43</page><page sequence="7">The BRITISH ART Journal Volume IX, No. 1 recently begun to be systematically investigated with, on occasion, the results handsomely published.44 Following Locke, notably in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding , 1690, it was vision that now assumed a pri- macy in acquiring knowledge, a primacy that is as much confirmed by the activities of the Mackinens as by any view- er of the painting who on gazing at the painting shares in their naturalist discoveries.45 Chesterfield's references to such bits of frippery as shells and butterflies should not be confused with their possible presence in the painting as part of the accumulations articu- lating the vanitas theme. They could be part of that configuration or the indication of yet another allegorical intrusion, but as Chesterfield explicitly indicates they also possessed a material and practical actuality. They had been or were about to be handled and admired. For him, as he clear- ly stated, they represented trivial and superficial diversions of a sort that a contemporary student might encounter and mis- takenly embrace if not forewarned of thee accompanying pitfalls. Earlier Alexander Pope in the last volume of The Dunciad had offered comparable advice. Relating his own comparable philosophy of education, Pope riled against the often witless virtuosi and their preoccupation with indis- criminate collecting and the 'study of Butterflies, Shells, Birdsnests, Moss'.46 But where for Tories like Chesterfield and Pope, with their conservative views on education, emphasizing the enduring value of the classics, such pursuits might have been regarded as virtually worthless, others took a contrary view. The senior Mackinens or whoever else was charged with the children's education probably took a pragmatic approach to their studies and saw real value in such learning, it being especially useful for a young man whose future lay in the run- ning of a great sugar plantation. Doubtless Hogarth too would have been sympathetic and supportive of the new emphasis on useful and practical knowledge. . It could have been he who, when determining the programme for the por- trait, introduced the passages that suggest such a progressive reading. In seeking a statement of the educational philoso- phy that reinforces such a reading of the painting, the remarks of Isaac Watts stand out. Watts, who was long preoc- cupied with rethinking the methods and purposes of education, found a sympathetic audience with Whigs, that party to whose principles and ideas Hogarth and the Mackinens, with their roots in colonial commerce, will be seen to have adhered. For Watts the empirical observation of natural phenomena was method by which 'the mind is improved to the Knowledge of things', and its pursuit he noted was best served by venturing out into the world beyond the student's immediate spaces. 'For this Reason also', he wrote in The Improvement of the Mind , 1741: . . . where Time and Fortune allows it, young People should be led into Company at proper Season, should be carried abroad to see the Fields, and the Woods, and the Rivers, the Buildings, Towns, and Cities distant from their own Dwelling; they should be enter- tain'd with the Sight of strange Birds, Beasts, Fishes, Insects, Vegetables, and Productions both of Nature and Art of every Kind, whether they are the products of their own or foreign Nations. And in words that seem especially pertinent for the Mackinens, Watts added: And in due Time, when Providence gives Opportunity, they may travel under a wise Inspector or Tutor to different Parts of the World for the same End, that they may bring home Treasures of useful Knowledge.47 If such pursuits were increasingly thought suitable and valu- able for all young people, they might have been regarded as possessing a special importance for the Mackinens. Indeed the similarity of Watt's recommendation in this passage and the apparent activities of William and Elizabeth in the paint- ing are striking. Being abroad and presumably in the charge of some tutor or schoolmaster, their training, apparently balan ced between knowledge obtained by reading and directly observing nature, would seem to have been much like that advised by Watts.48 For William especially, presum- ably fated to return eventually to his island home, to the family's sugar plantation and, like his father, to the life of an agriculturalist and trader, such studies were entirely appro- priate. Indeed, such principles were reiterated in an especially pertinent manner by Samuel Martin known as 'The Father of Antigua' (cl690-1776) in his Essay upon Plant er ship, published in Antigua in 1750, just after The Machinen Children was executed. The book was written 'for the instruction of a young planter' and Martin observes, 'A liberal education is undoubtedly the principal ingredient nec- essary to form a good planter, who ought at least to know the rudiments of all the sciences, if he attains not the mastery of them.'49 Not only would a young man of the islands need to learn to be a 'skilful [sic] husbandman', but by this account he also would need to acquire business skills and, for the maintenance of slaves, some knowledge of medicine. (There are connections here with Hogarth, one of whose close friends was Samuel Martin (1714-88), an English MP and eldest son of the author of The Essay upon Plantership. Towards the end of his life, Hogarth painted his portrait. See nlll below.) For Elizabeth too, such studies had become acceptable and young women at the time were being encour- aged to investigate science, possibly for purer, less practical purposes, though through marriage she too eventually might find such knowledge useful if she assumed any role in estate management.50 Beyond introducing issues that relate to practical concerns of the sort just noted, the butterfly also hints at other possi- ble readings of the painting. Butterflies, as observation and texts confirmed, passed through the standard life cycle of birth, life and death. In an interpretation extending back to antiquity, one of these phases had come to offer an enduring gloss both in literature and theology. Beyond death an addi- tional state, a posthumous state was added. Passing from the larvae, that is the caterpillar or, as it was commonly called in Hogarth's time, the grub, a cocoon was spun. Within it the insect entered a period of dormancy. Because of this with- drawal and a perceived resemblance between the cocoon and a shroud, this last phase was regarded as tantamount to death. But, warmed by the sun and possibly, as the emblem writer Jacob Cats implied, by a love emitted within the sun's radiating force, there emerged from this morbid sleep, the butterfly (Pi 10). 51 If its earlier existence was entirely earth- bound, the insect now was airborne and sky bound, drawn it was believed towards its reviving source of power. Certainly, within the sun's illuminating rays, it became in this state, as Baker had observed, more ravishing than ever before. Seemingly the result of a miraculous rebirth, a veritable return from death and the grave, the caterpillar was now pre- sent in its adult form, the imago. In antiquity this transformation into a butterfly had been personified in the legend of Cupid and Psyche first related by Apuleius in Metamorphoses (IV-VI). After much tribulation, the mortal Psyche, wed to Cupid, is given ambrosia to drink, and by this act she achieved immortality and, deified, rose as a butterfly to join the gods on Mount Olympus. Her name, Psyche, came to signify both soul and butterfly and, over time, the latter, 44</page><page sequence="8">Volume IX, No. 1 The BRITISH ART Journal 10 Jacob Cats, 'Amor elegantiae pater', Sinne- en minnebeeiden , 1627 11 Taste in High Life. Etching after William Hogarth painting of 1742. British Museum the butterfly, gradually came to signify the former. In Christianity the butterfly as a symbol of the soul was conve- niently absorbed and its flight came to represent the Resurrection of Christ and the ascending soul.52 As such it also came to signify a departed soul and to be included in portraits as a mark of a deceased sitter. No such significance seems to be implied here, since both Elizabeth and William lived well beyond the completion of the painting. Rather, recalling the transitions in its existence, the butterfly is a fit- ting element in a vanitas composition, serving both as a reminder of the passage of time and of the promise of an afterlife.53 From a secular perspective, it is also pertinent to consider the butterfly's presence as a metaphor for maturation, for the emergence of the sitters into adulthood. Links were recog- nized between the butterfly's metamorphosis and the animal economy, the process of change that reflected the various Ages of Man. Thus, the lowly crawling grub came to signify man's infancy.54 Responding to the question, 'Is it possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man?', Shakespeare in Coriolanus (V, iv, 11-12) observes, 'There is a deficiency between a grub and a butterfly, yet yon butterfly was a grub.' Such a transformation as he implies seem perti- nent to these siblings, though by 1747 neither was still a child. Having passed their childhood, they were now matur- ing sexually and on the verge of adulthood.55 For William as a rising gentleman, this could have occurred at 16 years old when, were he at home, he would have assumed political and social responsibility, including the payment of taxes and ser- vice in the island's militia.56 Elizabeth at or approaching 18 was at an age when women were regarded as suitable mar- riage partners and it should be recalled that this would have been one of the reasons she had come abroad in the fist place. As the composition implies, William's approaching adulthood is marked by the butterfly, the splendid adult towards which he reaches. His sister's movement towards maturity is indicated rather differently, for already her attrac- tion to the butterfly portends disaster. Her attention diverted, her shells are about to accidentally fall to the ground, and these shells give her presence a distinctly sexu- al character. Shells were long associated with Aphrodite, the goddess of love, born from the foam of the seas. The resultant associa- tion that developed from this myth between women and molluscs, the latter as instruments of love, was strengthened still further since some shells, because of their shape or the form and color of their opening came to be associated with the female pudenda , which they were said to resemble.57 Certainly they were frequently employed in painting as a love device. However, upon careful examination it becomes apparent than the most noticeable object in Elizabeth's lap is actually not a mollusc. Seated prominently atop the pile of shells it is instead the ball-like, hollowed-out skeleton of a sea urchin. Its commonly assigned name, urchin, derived from ericius , the Latin for hedgehog, an animal it was thought to resemble because when taken alive from the sea its body was still covered with dart-like projectiles.58 Often, like Elizabeth's specimen, given their fragility, these spines were removed to expose the handsomely formed and collectible body underneath. It was with this in mind that the 18th cen- tury came to use the word urchin when referring to a prickly mischievous boy and as an epithet for Eros, that son of Aphrodite who with varied results wantonly shot off his own arrows.59 Consequently, through its presence and location in Elizabeth's lap the sea urchin obtains a charged erotic signif- icance. It could be understood to represent a sexual threat to this virtuous and handsome young woman, the risky tempta- tions and dangers of amor that she was just beginning to confront as she entered the English social whirl.60 In The Machinen Children the accumulation of shells is linked with what might be termed the lap-motif. Elizabeth rises and grasps her gown in such a manner that the folds assume an oval form that is suggestive of her underlying pudenda , a possibility enhanced by the presence of the shells and sea urchin held in this embracing gathering. The suggestive use of the lap-motif was widespread in female por- traits from the later 17th century onwards and also appears in various genre painting of Dutch domestic scenes, some of a homely nature but others set in brothels and more directly sexual and illicit in tone.61 In a portrait the sitter might be portrayed holding in her lap roses or some other attractive flower or sometimes plucked fruits representative of fecun- dity or, when apples, of temptation. The shells are yet another suggestive possibility, but here distinctly sexual in tone. Close to Hogarth's use of them in a narrative context, there is the woman, often a housemaid, depicted, for exam- ple, by van Meiris, c 165 5-57, who holds eggs whose broken shells, like seashells and, ultimately, her virtue could be per- ceived as fragile, vulnerable and sometimes irrevocably lost.62 Yet in The Machinen Children the most immediate danger 45</page><page sequence="9">The BRITISH ART Journal Volume EX, No. 1 that Elizabeth confronts is not a male suitor, but rather it is the alluring and seductive butterfly that tempts her from her seat. It is the butterfly that diverts her attention and repre- sents the real threat to her treasure, but in this reading the insect also is representative of a certain unpleasant and excessively attentive male, the sort that any respectable young woman would be at pains to avoid, a worthless cad possessed of a flashy and vain appearance. Alexander Pope employed such a-metaphor several times, using it most effec- tively, perhaps, in 'To Sir John Moore' (1716). For him 'all human kind are worms', whether bookworms, glow-worms or some other variety, such that: The Fops are painted Butteflies, That flutter for a Day; First from a Worm they take their Rise, And in a Worm decay.63 Similarly, John Gay would observe of such a foppish figure in his fable 'The Butterfly and the Snail': All upstarts insolent in place, Remind us of their vulgar race. . . And what's a butterfly? At best, He's but a caterpillar, dress'd; And all thy race (a numerous seed) Shall prove of caterpillar breed.64 Hogarth had used a similar reference. In Taste a la Mode , 1742 (Pi 11), he inserts a picture labelled 'Insects', that mim- ics the format of scientific illustration and which shows butterflies surrounding the dandyish French dance Desnoyers.65 Often irresistibly alluring, the butterfly, never- theless, like many a potential suitor for the hand of a handsome heiress, should be recognized for what he is, a worthless gaudy suitor who, only momentarily present, flits from flower to flower, never really settling on any. Such men, as the butterfly (and the painting) remind Elizabeth, were to be carefully avoided, or disaster might ensue. The various discussion contemporary up to this viewers, point has depending demonstrated on their that rela- for various contemporary viewers, depending on their rela- tionship with the sitters and the sorts of knowledge they brought to the work, The Machinen Children could carry various meanings, most of which, though they draw on diverse ideas, images and texts, are nevertheless comple- mentary to each other. The painting can be seen as a straightforward portrait; or a tale built around the adventure of two children, involving a butterfly, sunflowers and shells; or it can be seen as a moralizing statement; and as an allego- ry. Further combinations and conflations of these different readings are conceivable, and Hogarth often sought to blur and redefine the various genres of painting. As a portrait, the specific presence of Elizabeth and William could only be recognized if they were known to the specta- tor whether by personal acquaintance or by some method of labelling. If, as seems likely, the picture was destined for the Mackinen's family residence on Antigua, their recognition would not have been problematic. However, out of that immediate context, perhaps as seen in Hogarth's painting room prior to its being dispatched to the island, and conse- quently lacking their identity, not only would the figures become nameless, but there is no definite sign that they are siblings. At best some semblance in their faces might be dis- cerned. Yet a strong emotional link between the sitters is indicated. Compositionally sharing the same space, the two figures are conceived of as a pair, though the particular nature of their relationship remains to be defined. Although not in any physical contact, not even sharing eye contact, some bond of affection is implied. The presence both of the sunflower and of the loyal dog, well established symbols for asserting such a relationship, might be understood in suffi- ciently broad terms to suggest a range of amatory and devotional readings. That the sitters are depicted on the verge of adulthood and sexual maturity, as represented by the butterfly and the erotically edged shells, complicates any process of understanding. Without knowledge of who they are, the painting can be recognized as an emblematic cele- bration of friendship and love. But when it is recognized that the Mackinens are brother and sister other problems arise. These same symbols now become loaded and beyond mere affection they also suggest another kind of love, the Horror naturalis , sibling incest. Adequate evidence exists to suggest that Hogarth intended to hint at such a relationship and importantly that some part of his audience, at least those who were aware that the two were siblings, would have shared in the allusion. Not that the Mackinens were involved in such a liaison, only that refer- ences to this most highly charged of all relationships permitted the artist and his audience to explore the extreme limits of sexuality and affection. During a time that people were concerned with understanding the idea of Vamitie amoureuse , the phenomenon of sibling incest as a variant fascinated many.66 An interest in such liaisons was aroused by academic inquiry and by the sort of discoveries and experi- ments that proceeded from the study of natural history Long regarded as taboo, with stern biblically derived injunctions in place, the idea of incest began to be reconsidered in the light of observed scientific investigation and discovery. The common occurrence of incest was recognized in the plant and animal kingdoms, realms with which it was increas- ingly acknowledged man had affinities. With the rise of agricultural management, farm animals, race-horses and dogs were commonly bred incestuously to enhance bloodlines. The same was true of the husbanding of farm crops and, to take one instance, ornamental flowers. Sunflowers, as Hogarth presents them, offer a good example of this sort of coupling, with the blooms being offspring from a common parent, as they are portrayed here. Although they share the same stem, just as siblings would, the flowers are fully capa- ble of fertilizing each other and of reproducing and are entirely unaffected by any moral or social prohibitions. The sort of questioning of what otherwise was regarded as a sex- ual verity is well summarized by the Anglo-Dutch physician and philosopher Bernard de Mandeville. Writing in his A Search into the Nature of Society , 1723, he noted of incest: 'Such alliances are abominable; but it is certain, that whatev- er Horror we conceived at the Thought of them, there is nothing in nature repugnant, but what is built upon Mode and Custom.'67 In other words, it was only tradition and the- ology that sustained the injunction, because scientifically no objections to such relationships could be observed. It was perhaps the vicarious possibilities that even the hint of an incestuous coupling offered to an unfolding plot that made it appeal to contemporary painters and writers, though only rarely in contemporary human society were the limits of good taste and behaviour breached and the act consummat- ed. As a mtter of act, just prior to painting The Machinen Children , Hogarth in a distinctly satirical vein had already begun to explore incest and other proscribed sexual prac- tices. In Marriage A-la-Mode , a series of paintings begun in 1743 and pubished in engravings two years later, he com- ments on the vicissitudes of a modern marriage. Plate IV (PI 12) depicts a stylish gathering in the ill-fated countess's fash- ionable boudoir whose walls are covered by old masters. 46</page><page sequence="10">Volume IX, Noi The BRITISH ART Journal Prominently displayed are a Ganymede and the Eagle , pur- portedly by Michelangelo and carrying reference to homoerotic love; Jupiter and Io after Correggio, in which Jupiter achieved congress with a cow in the guise of an enveloping cloud; and Lot and His Daughters , a composition then attributed to Caravaggio.68 This last work carried a clear reference to the dangers of parental incest and, in the con- text of the saga of Marriage Ala-Mode and its portrayal of sexual corruption, it serves as a pointed reminder of the potential risks attending casual encounters at a masked amusement such as the masquerade for which the countess prepares herself.69 Too late, one's disguised partner could be discovered to be from one's own family. However, these vari- ants aside, it was the incestuous pairing of siblings that held the strongest fascination. Contemporary with The Machinen Children , another por- trait can be cited which also hints at sibling incest. Thomas Hudson's Courtenay Children (PI 13) generally dates to 1745.70 Shown at younger ages than the Mackinens are a brother and two sisters. The boy garbed in Van Dyck dress, holding a bow and arrow, assumes the guise of Cupid, a not uncommon persona in the depiction of male children at the time. He gestures towards the older sister. She sits slumped on the ground. Beside her, abandoned for the moment is her doll, a discarded toy of youth. In her lap are several apples, the forbidden fruit, the fruit with which Eve had tempted Adam. However, in a welcome note of ambiguity, deriving from the association of Eve with the Virgin, besides being a sign of vice the apple also came to represent virtue.71 How fit- ting a confusion for a seemingly unaffected child who must tread a delicate and disturbed line, wavering between her youthful naiveté and her future guile, the tempting sexuality of her maturity. Yet in the Hudson composition any incestu- ous undertone appears underplayed, largely because it is a portrayal of younger children whose innocence is implied by their age. In Hogarth's painting, a portrayal of what is now regarded as late adolescents, such sexual references are more distinctly present.72 Among writers the possibility of sibling incest tended to be approached forthrightly, although because it was such a diffi- cult and sensitive subject it was often couched in comic language and exploited for its humorous possibilities. An author who exploited the theme and who is especially impor- tant for the present discussion is Hogarth's close friend and admirer, the popular novelist Henry Fielding. Their relation- ship is best acknowledged and celebrated in Fielding's 1742 book, The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews, and of his Friend Mr. Abraham Andrews , which includes several complimentary references to the painter.73 More importantly, however, the book contains an extensive adulatory preface in which Fielding attempts to define his friend's work, devoting himself particularly to the artist's various narrative series. For the author, Hogarth is a 'comic history painter', one who concerns himself with the 'exactest copying of nature'. Sibling incest is an important theme in Joseph Andrews 74 On the verge of marriage to his beloved Fanny, Joseph, the hero, discovers that they are actually brother and sister. Unfortunate childhood circumstances had resulted in their early separation. Having been raised independent of each other, they had entered into a romance unaware of their blood relationship. At the very moment of their wedding, the parson suddenly reveals that they are brother and sister. As Fielding describes the scene, Joseph 'fell on his knees and ejaculated many thanksgivings, that this discovery had been made before the dreadful sin of incest was committed'. But still the couple feel an overwhelming passion for each other, 12 Marriage Ala-Mode, iy by William Hogarth, 1745. Engraving.

Testing the limits of their emotions, they vow 'a perfect celibacy and to live together all their days and indulge a Platonic friendship for each other'. Eventually, to their great relief, it is discov- ered that a mistake has been made and they are not siblings at all, thus permitting their marriage to proceed. As with Joseph and Fanny, and in line with the contemporary dis- course with which he seems to have been well acquainted, Hogarth too appears to have taken his protagonists William and Elizabeth, to an edge of acceptable sexual behaviour, as a means perhaps of emphasizing their closeness. And they too, brother and sister, through a Platonic friendship may have found an acceptable and enduring love. Afinal ical in dimension nature, remains to the Mackinen to be discussed. portrait, Once distinctly established polit- ical in nature, remains to be discussed. Once established and collated with historical events and family records it emerges that the painting may have been intended to serve immediate purposes: to function as an attestation of the loy- alty of the Mackinens of Antigua to the Protestant Succession 47</page><page sequence="11">The BRITISH ART Journal Volume IX, No. 1 14 George Wither, A Collection of Emblemes. . . , 1635 15 Self-portrait by Anthony van Dyck (1699- 1743). Oil on canvas and the reigning House of Hanover, and also to refer to William Mackinen's attempts to secure for himself the fami- ly's ancestral Scottish homelands. The device that initiates this reading and through which any announcement of loyal- ty would have been announced is again the sunflower. The association of rulers, sunflowers and suns extends back at least to the 14th century when the connection was celebrat- ed by Dante, who utilized the sun emerging from the darkness of night as a symbol for the emperor who shines his reviving night on the heliotrope of justice.75 From the 16th century onwards and especially during the 17th there evolved an emblematic variant on this noble conjunction which joined the regal links to the already existing themes for the flower of constancy, love and devotion. In these circum- stances the sunflower commonly represented either the fidelity that emanated from the ruler or that his adoring sub- jects directed towards him. If it was identified as representing the obligations of the prince to his subjects, then the metaphor was of the. prince as the sun shining forth and nur- turing his people, the dependent flowers that turn towards and bask in his radiant embrace. Or the reference could be to the people's dutiful obligations personified as the sunflower that offers the prince a dutiful warmth. Allusions of either type flourished in 17th-century Britain.76 The vicissitudes of dynastic succession marked by the Catholic House of Stuart, with its pronounced absolutist bent, initially to retain and eventually to regain power, encouraged sympathetic royalist devices that emphasized the crown's central authority Perhaps the earliest references of this sort appeared during the reign of James I, around 1600. In an unillustrated manuscript volume of emblematic verses presented to Thomas Egerton, Frances Thynne writ- ing of 'The Subject' refers to the sunflower: So pliant subject follow still, Whist rulinge Prince doth live, The good or badd examples which In his customd actions give.77 Also fitting to establish this usage is the illustrated emblem from George Wither's 1635 collection dedicated to Charles I and his queen Henrietta Maria (Pi 14). Like the other plates in his Collection of Emblems it too is derived from a Dutch example, although its meaning has been altered to make it pertinent to the English situation.78 Several flowers are shown, including a sunflower, facing the sun. As with Hogarth's use of the flower, here too a butterfly alights on the petals. In the background an equestrian party is seen departing from a country house. Presumably they are going on a hunt, a fitting and exclusively noble exercise. The accompanying verses are a further testimonial to the peo- ple's dependence on their prince: All are not Heliotropes that favour'd growe, In Princes Courts; nov Marigolds that ebeard The goldes blossomes: but some spring below, Like Day sie ßow'rs that in the Path wayes are: Yet all shall feele it, when their Sovraignes eye Doth frown, or some, regard, or else neglect. The sunflower also makes an appearance in two notable English likenesses by Van Dyck: that of Sir Kenelm Digby, cl636, and the artist's Self-portrait of 1640 (PI 15). 79 In both works it appears that the sunflower assumes multiple roles, but central to both is the idea of allegiance and royal magna- nimity. In the Self-portrait Van Dyck, the king's painter, wears and fondles the gold chain presented to him as a token of royal esteem. With his other hand he gestures towards the bloom, suggesting perhaps a divine calling for his artistic vocation, but also acknowledging his devoted service to the king. In turn he benefits from the luminous generosity of his princely benefactor. The same sort of beneficent reciprocity is indicated in the portrait of Digby, a naval commander of great loyalty to the king. Assuming that Hogarth and some sections of his public would have been acquainted with the various sources and therefore would have recognized the political implication of the sunflower, it remains to demonstrate the emblem's rele- vance for The Machinen Children. Well before the portrait was executed the hereditary Laird of the Mackinens had become separated from branches of his more immediate family, not only by distance, part being in Scotland and the other in the West Indies, but important- ly also by their respective political sympathies. Those remaining in the Highlands retained a fervid commitment to the Stuart cause, a commitment that actively extended back at least to the time of Lachlan Mohr, the sitters' great grand- father. In 1645, as a youth during the Civil War, he is said to have fought on the side of the Crown as part of the Highland force organized under the leadership of the Earl of Montrose.80 The futile efforts of that expedition and other campaigns to retain the throne for Charles I culminated dis- astrously with the king's execution in 1649. Unaffected by the apparent futility of the royalist cause, in 1651 Lachlan Mohr was back in the service of the Stuarts, this time serving along- side the future Charles II when the latter, after having been declared King of Scotland invaded England in a premature attempt to regain his late father's other throne. 48</page><page sequence="12">Volume IX, No. 1 The BRITISH ART Journal Lachlan Mohr's eldest son Ian Dubh, or John Mackinen as he also was known, the 29th chief of the clan, maintained these loyalties, but his second son Donald, who had left Scotland and settled in Antigua, eventually made a radical shift in his political allegiance.81 Succeeding abroad as a planter and trader he became an active Whig, assuming an outlook more in line with his newly acquired wealth born of trade and the island's flourishing commercial interests, notably in sugar. Having .abandoned the Jacobite sympathies of his forefathers, Donald became active as an elected repre- sentative in the island's governing Assembly where he struggled against any abuses of crown authority and for the extension of civil liberties and legislative autonomy for the colony Local interests were pitted against the needs of the King and Donald avidly sided with the former. So protective was he of these privileges that in 1710, at the culmination of a bitter dispute between the elected delegates to the Assembly and the powers of the crown's representative, the Captain General, and his advisory Council of appointed members, he played a central role in the assassination of the abusive royal emissary, Daniel Parke, a favorite of Queen Anne.82 The succeeding governor had Mackinen sent for trial to England where for a time he and another who accompa- nied him evaded their captors. Eventually recaptured they were held for trial at the Tower. Doubtless hanging would have followed a guilty verdict, but fortuitously the two were released either by petition to Queen Anne or subsequently by the General Pardon issued at the accession to the throne of George I, the first Hanoverian in 1714. 83 After Donald's death in 1720 on Antigua, where he had returned, his eldest son, William Mackinen the Elder, the children's father, was elected to the same Assembly seat and continued to serve the Whig and Hanoverian cause until his own death in 1765. It was the movement of William and Elizabeth's great uncle, Ian Dubh, that is John Mackinen, the long-lived 29th Laird of the Mackinens that quickly became central to the family's concerns and fortunes, regardless of where they dwelled. As noted he was a committed Jacobite. Living through the reigns of William and Mary, and Queen Anne, he could only have looked forward to an opportunity to restore the Stuarts to the throne at Westminster. When in 1714, at Anne's death, the Lord Advocate of Scotland issued a call to the Highland chiefs to appear before him in Edinburgh and swear allegiance to George I, the newly crowned Hanoverian king, in a dynastic succession determined by the detested Act of Union of 1707 that united the kingdoms of England and Scotland, Ian Dubh failed to appear.84 Instead, at the head of his clan, he became part of the Rising of 1715, the unsuc- cessful attempt to usurp the throne of what had become the United Kingdom for him who they saw as the legitimate heir, the Old Pretender, James II's son, Prince James Francis Edward Stuart or, as he was otherwise styled, James III and VII of Great Britain, France and Ireland. Following the col- lapse of this futile rebellion the prince and some of his followers fled to safety and exile in France in February 1716. Others were captured and imprisoned, either in Scotland or England, and still others, including apparently Mackinen, went into hiding in their native Highland and were attaint- ed.85 By an Act of Attainder, those who remained at large were declared traitors and if convicted were deprived of their property by forfeiture and, by a corruption of the blood, were denied the right to hold or inherit land or to transmit titles by decent.86 Prosecutions under this Act when pursued in the courts of Scotland often failed because there remained a sufficient residue of local sympathy for those being tried. Prisoners held in England were less fortunate. Among the lesser punishments meted out was transportation and a large number of failed Jacobites, nearly 700 persons, were sent to the West Indies as indentured servants.87 Finally, in 1717, an Act of Grace and Pardon freed those still held in captivity, but presumably this action would have had no effect on Ian Dubh' s eventual fate: apparently still uncaptured he remained at bay, an outlaw sheltered in the Highlands by sympathetic kinsmen. Undeterred by the escapade of 1715, in 1719 a desperate Prince James made a second short-lived effort to recoup the throne. Again he failed and once more a loyal Ian Dubh was at his side, thus further confirming his status as a traitor and threatening his own property and his rights to the chieftain- ship.88 The Antigua Mackinens evidently knew of their estranged relation's rebellious activities, his consequent attainting and the indecisive state of the ownership of the family estates, and William Mackinen the Elder, who trained and practised as a lawyer, knew what to do.89 In 1726 he appeared at the College of Arms in Edinburgh where, in what must have been an attempt at disassociation, he recorded a new family pedigree and registered a redesigned coat of arms.90 Only the crest remained the same, the shield being entirely reconstituted. No known benefit seem to have accrued to this branch of the family following this visit, pos- sibly because, as some accounts indicate, Ian Dubh was pardoned by yet another Act of Grace and Pardon passed by Parliament the following year.91 Though William Mackinen's scheme came to naught, it must nevertheless remain a pos- sibility that he was motivated by an ulterior purpose. By demonstrating his own branch's loyalty to the reigning monarch, the recently installed Hanoverian George I, he may very well have had hopes of claiming for himself and his descendants the Lairdship of the Mackinens and with it title to his family's ancestral estates. In 1745 came the final Stuart attempt to regain the crown, organized this time on behalf of the Pretender's son, the Young Pretender, Princes Charles Edward, the legendary Bonnie Prince Charlie. And yet again, the now aged but still committed Jacobite Ian Dubh responded to the appeal for support. Fortunately for him, having been sent on another mission, he missed being present in mid-April at the decisive slaughter of the Highlanders on Culloden Moor by the English forces under the command of Prince William, the Duke of Cumberland.92 In the immediate aftermath of that defeat, however, he did play a crucial role in abetting the Prince's escape by boat on 5 July from the Isle of Skye to the Scottish mainland from where, in September 1746, the Prince eventually reached sanctuary and exile in France.93 With his departure, the Stuart cause effectively collapsed and no fur- ther challenges to the Hanoverians were forthcoming. Already by that time, under an Act of Attainder of 8 June 1746, which declared him a traitor for a second time, Ian Dubh and his wife Ann had been taken into custody by the Crown authorities. Captured soon after the Prince's flight, they were eventually escorted to London and there impris- oned under what often were very unpleasant conditions.94 She was released a year later when her innocence in all these proceedings became known. The Laird, though, remained a prisoner until at least January 1749, not necessarily having served time for this crimes but perhaps because he was just plain forgotten by the authorities.95 Finally, he was freed by petition. Right to the end, though, until his death in May 1756, the records show that, despite a life of political misad- venture and failure, Ian Dubh, ie John Mackinen, remained an unreconstructed Jacobite, for ever plotting for the return of another Stuart to the British throne.96 49</page><page sequence="13">The BRITISH ART Journal Volume IX, No.l 16 Three Children of Charlesi. Mezzotint by Richard Purcell after Van Dyck 17 Three Children of Charles I by Sir Peter Lely (1618-60), cl647. Oil on canvas, 198 x 206 cm. Fetworth, National Thist The charged 1746 was Act followed of Attainder the next under year, which 1747, Ian by the Dubh passage was charged was followed the next year, 1747, by the passage of a Parliamentary Act of Indemnity that would have exempt- ed Ian Dubh from any pardons. Again, news of his role in the Rebellion, in the Young Pretender's subsequent flight, as well as of his own fate, his succeeding arrest and imprisonment, would have been known to interested parties, enough to encourage the suggestion that sometime in 1747 or there- abouts William Mackinen of Antigua, perhaps accompanied by his wife, and almost certainly travelling with his two eldest children, Elizabeth and William, arrived in London to press his claims for entitlement as Laird of the Mackinens, with all the accompanying rights, privileges and properties.97 Consequently, at the very moment that Ian Dubh was moidering there in prison, and when other leading Jacobites were being beheaded on Tower Hill for their roles in the rebellion, the younger Mackinens were apparently sitting for their portrait to Hogarth, an artist of strong Whig conviction and with a demonstrated dislike of Jacobites.98 What better time could there have been self-servingly to assert the fami- ly's loyalty and devotion to George II and the Hanoverians to whom they owed much of their good fortune?99 And through what better device could this be achieved in an otherwise ordinary children's portrait than through the inclusion of the conspicuous sunflower, a well-established symbol for senti- ments of royal service, attachment and fidelity. Possibly Hogarth even tried to emphasize the Mackinen's Hanoverian commitments by a deliberate and playful inver- sion and subversion of what had evolved as particular Jacobite references. If anything, in Britain the sunflower had come to bear Stuart associations. Thus, for example, a 18 The Prince of Wales [Prince James Edward Stuart , the 'Old Pretender '] and his sister. Mezzotint by John Smith, 1699, after Nicolas de Largillière valence, dated 1719 and possibly embroidered by Anne Urquhart of Newhall, shows a sunflower on which are stitched a crown and the initials of 'James VIH' and of his queen Clementine Sobieski.100 Further, and more significant- ly, it might be observed that Hogarth's entire format worked in a similarly ironic manner. Behind the portrait there is a compositional tradition established in a number of royal por- traits by Charles I's painter Anthony Van Dyck, for example, in The Three Eldest Children of Charlesi, 1635 (PI 16).101 This arrangement of sitters was maintained by his successor as royal portrait painter, Peter Lely, when in 1647, he turned his hand to portraying the same offspring (Pi 17). 102 Using what was by then a recognized formula for depicting Stuart chil- dren, Nicholas de Largillière, once Lely's student in England, had in 1695 portrayed a young Prince James, later the Old Pretender, and his sister during their Parisian exile (PI 18). 103 Hogarth admired all these artists, and here in The Mackinen Children he appears to have exploited their works in a delightfully perverse way, using royal Stuart models for por- traying Hanoverian loyalists.104 Perhaps the final indication of this frame of mind is the dog. Through William and Elizabeth, indirectly paying homage to George II and attesting to their loyalty to the Union of the Kingdoms and the Protestant Succession, is a playful King Charles spaniel, the favourite breed of the last Stuart monarch, Charles II, for whom it was naméd, and a bred which had gone out of favour with the collapse of that royal house. In turn it had been replaced in popularity by the English pug which, coincidentally, was Hogarth's favourite.105 In actual fact, other than the circumstances provided by the existence of The Mackinen Children and the collapse of Jacobite attempts to usurp the throne, we have no real evi- dence that William Mackinen and his family came to England in 1747 or thereabouts to pursue any claims to the Lairdship. Indeed, as already indicated, the children could have trav- elled abroad on their own for entirely other purposes, presumably educational. Nor, if the family had come to stake their claim to this inheritance is there anything that attests to their success or failure in doing so. But the coincidence between the timing of these different events in the family's history and the date traditionally assigned to the portrait is striking.106 If they made such an attempt, it does seem that they were successful in any such claims for the title or the estate, if only because they are all recorded in subsequent years as residing on Antigua. Instead, by whatever means, the lairdship and the land were retained by the Highland branch of the family, at least for the remainder of the century and just into the next. But, in what might be the final irony attached to this saga, in 1808 there died without any immediate heirs, John Mackinen, son of Ian Dubh, and the 31st chief. Therefore, entirely unbeknownst to him and for perhaps only a year, since he died the following year, William MacKinnon [sic] the Younger did finally fulfill his father's dynastic ambitions and was briefly the 32nd Laird of the Clan Mackinen.107 And, as his heirs eventually came to learn of their inheritance, virtually nothing remained of the family's lands, the seat at Strathaird on Skye finally having been sold off in 1791.108 50</page><page sequence="14">Volume IX, No.l The BRITISH ART Journal What representing emerges from Elizabeth this essay, and then, William, is that The in addition Machinen to representing Elizabeth and William, The Machinen Children carries a remarkable number of meanings, and that their invention and inclusion is almost entirely owed to the artist, William Hogarth. Possessed of a remarkable versatility of mind, he was familiar with and drew from a wide range of resources. As his oeuvre clearly demonstrates, he was well informed about literature, theatre, religion, history, medi- cine, science, music, and of course art, and he knew each discipline through both its texts and its images. He also knew their myriad expressions through a range of learned and pop- ular sources. Just as he knew great literature he knew doggerel, and just as he knew great art, he knew the crudely devised penny-prints hawked to one and all on the streets. He also was highly sensitive to the nuances of language, spo- ken and heard, to slang, puns and double entendres. He possessed an observing eye and an absorbing ear and from these assorted sources and experiences Hogarth assembled his art.109 Reflecting the variety of his sources, his work was usually directed towards a variety of audiences. Often this was for commercial reasons, for an expanded public offered a wider market. He constructed images that had the poten- tial to reach across an entire social spectrum, acknowledging that individual viewers brought to his invention a varied body of knowledge and experiences which in turn determined what they saw, how they saw it, and what was understood. But, as in The Machinen Children , on commission Hogarth constructed works that, although derived from a broadly shared cultural context, also were directed towards a specific and localized audience. Here, by bringing together such familiar objects as shells, sunflowers and a butterfly, all pos- sessed of conventional, established and accessible meanings, with the anecdotal content that emerges from the interaction of these elements and the figures of Elizabeth and William and their particular stories, there emerges a range of restrict- ed though varied interpretations. Beyond their personal history, he addressed broader issues of education, matura- tion, sexuality, and of the fragility of life. Attempting to reveal some general truths, Hogarth worked with an immediacy, the need to represent his sitters, but as this painting demon- strates he also was drawn to surround them with tradition and learning. The result is a remarkably rich composition that can be seen as animated likenesses or as has been shown here, a synthesis of great richness and complexity.110 51</page><page sequence="15">The BRITISH ART Journal Volume EX, No.l 1 Previous considerations of the pic- ture, more commonly known as The MacKinnon Children, include Mary Webster, Hogarth , London, 1979, ppl 18-19; Webster, 'From an Exotic Home: Hogarth's Portrait of the Mackinen Children', Country Life , 183 (18 September 1989), pl51; Raymond Keavney, et al, National Gallery of Ireland, 50 Pictures, Dublin, 1981, p.4l; Richard Wendorf, The Elements of Life, Biography and Portrait Painting in Stuart and Georgian England , Oxford, 1990, ppl82, 295-08; Ronald Paulson, Hogarth, 3 vols, 1991-3 (=Paulson), II, ppl77- 9; James Christen Steward, The New Child: British Art and the Origins of Modern Childhood, 1730-1830, Berkeley, 1995, p87; and Elizabeth Einberg, Hogarth the Painter , London, 1997, pp46-7.

By contrast art historians have tended to date the painting to about 1742, presumably because of its closeness to Hogarth's Graham Children, which is securely dated to that year. Paulson, II, ppl77-79, prefers 1745, which he claims is close to the ages at which to his mind the sitters appear. 9 On the movement of colonial American and for their portraits, which is equally pertinent to those in the West Indies, see Ellen Miles, 'The Portrait in America 1750- 1776', in Richard H Saunders and Ellen G Miles, American Colonial Portraits 1700-1776, Washington DC, pp46-50. Einberg has made observations which indicate that Hogarth very likely only had ade- quate time to take their likenesses and the remainder of the painting was probably completed in their absences: Einberg, Hogarth, pp46- 47. Other schematic passages and pentimenti can be noted which seem to support her observations, such as the sketchiness visible in the urn at the left and the shift in William's right foot. 10 William Sachse, The Colonial American in Britain, Madison, 1956, pp48, 51, 118-22. Also see Robert V Wells, The Population of the British Colonies in America before 1776, Princeton, 1975, p217, who notes a marked absence of children in the Leeward Islands by 1756, possibly because many had been sent abroad. Furthermore, by 1747, besides the reasons to be advanced below, it should be observed that the War of the Austrian Succession was coming to a close and although there still was much capturing of their shipping the British had recently regained control of the seas, which could have permitted easier movement between England and the islands. 11 Sachse, Colonial American, pp 130-52.

In the will of William the Elder the only heirs mentioned are William and Elizabeth, indicating possibly that any other children pre-deceased him; MacKinnon, pp70-72. Regarding the painting's prove- nance, it is known that it descended from William MacKinnon, the son of the sitter, to his son John Daniel MacKinnon (1730-1830), and then in turn to his son General Daniel Henry MacKinnon (b 1813) : see MacKinnon, p75.

For example, lepidology volumes that appeared near or at the time the Mackinens sat to Hogarth include, Eleazar Albin, A Natural History of English Insects, London 1724; Benjamin Wilkes, Twelve New Designs of British Butterflies, London 1742; and Wilkes, The English Moths and Butterflies: Together with The Plants, Flowers and Fruits, Whereon they feed, London, 1747-60, in which see p20 and the accompanying plate that shows the Great Ermine Moth and its various states with 'The small Garden Sun Flower.' In his preface to the previous volume Wilkes identified himself as a painter of ' History Pieces and Portraits in Oyl', but he appears in none of the standard artists' dictionaries. Also see James Dutfield, Natural History of English Moths and Butterflies: considered through all their progressive states and changes. Drawn and Coloured exactly from the Life, together with the Plants, Flowers, and Fruits, in their Season, on which they feed, and are usually found, London, 1748-49.

Wohlfahrt, 'Schmetterlinge in der Illustration', in Nissen, Zoologische Buchillustration, II, Lieferung 13, Stuttgart, 1975, pp3 12-13. 45 Recalling Locke, Hogarth several years later noted in the Analysis of Beauty (1753), that 'occular demonstrations will convince and improve man sooner than ten thousand fol [io] s': Analysis of Beauty, ed Joseph Burke, Oxford, 1955, p215. Also see Michel Baridon, 'Hogarth the empiricist', in The Dumb Show, Image and society in the works of William Hogarth, ed Frederic Ogee, Oxford, 1997, ppl91-202. Complementary to Chesterfield's view, but referring to a woman, and reflecting perhaps a widely held attitude, is a remark from a memoir of Eleanor Glanville (cl654-1709), an early collector of insects regarding a challenge to her will: 'Some Relation that was disappointed by her Will, attempt- ed to set it aside by Acts of Lunacy, for they suggested that none but those who were deprived of their Sense would go in Pursuit of Butterflies'; from Moses Harris, The Aurelian, London, 1766, and here quoted from Ronald S. Wilkinson, 'Elizabeth [s/c] Glanville, An Early English Entomologist', Entomology Gazette, 17 (19 66), 155. 46 Alexander Pope, The Dunciad, ed James Sutherland [The Twickenham Edition of the Poems of Alexander Pope, V] , New Haven, 1943, p338, also p384 lines 446-50 and footnote for further references of this sort.

In general on the virtuosi, see Walter E Houghton, Jr, 'The English Virtuoso in the Seventeenth Century', Journal of the History of Ideas, 3 (1942), PP51-73, 190-219. 47 Isaac Watts, The Improvement of the Mind, 2nd ed„ London, 1743, p53, also 51. On Watts and the Whigs see Caroline Robbins, The Eighteenth Century Commonwealthmen , Cambridge, MA, 1959, pp246-51. 48 In contrast to Chesterfield's views and perhaps pertinent for the young Mackinens, there appeared during this period natural history books directed at children, for example [Thomas Boreman] , A Description of Three Hundred Animals. . . Extracted out of The Best Authors and adapted to the use of all Capacities: especially to allure Children to Read, London, 1730 (5th edn 1743), which though indiscriminate in its inclu- sion of entirely fictitious animals, also can be reliable as for butter- flies, with a plate showing the various stages of the animals devel- opment; and Boreman, A Description of a Great Variety of Animals and Vegetables. . . espe- cially for The Entertainment of Youth, London 1736 (2nd edn 17 44). 49 Samuel Martin, An Essay Upon Plantership, Antigua, 1750, pp i- xvi. For further on the usefulness of such information for estate management, see George C Bauer, Jr, The Education of a Gentleman: Theories of Gentlemanly Education in England, 1660-1775, New York, 1959, pp76, 93-95; and Mason, Gentlefolk in the Making, p90. It might also be noted that if William pursued such studies he was apparently preceded by his grandfather, Daniel Mackinen, who practiced as a physician and sur- geon on Antigua, and was approached, 1694-95, by the natu- ralist James Petiver for specimens of shells, insects, plants, sea -urchins, etc.; see Raymond Phineas Stearns, 'James Petiver, Promoter of Natural Science, ca 1663-1718', Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, new series, 42 (1952), pp265, 268, 320, where he is identified as Dr. Daniel MacKenning. 50 See Gerald Denis Meyer, The Scientific Lady in England 1650- 1760, Berkeley, 1955, pp70-93, where it is noted that the encour- agement of women studying science came to a head cl750, and that it was marked by volumes of poetry and such publications as Elizabeth Haywood, The Female Spectator, London, 1744-1746, a work which was known in the American colonies. Also see Jones, Rhetoric of Science, ppl6l-63. Significantly perhaps for Elizabeth, important early examples of but- terfly literature were the work of a woman artist observer, Maria Sibylla Merian: see her Der Raupen wunderbare Verwandelung und sonderbare Blumen-Nahrung, Nuremberg, 1679-93; and with reference to New World insects, Metamorphosis insectariums surinanensium of te verandering der surinamische Insecten, Amsterdam, 1705. Possibly pertinent too is the fron- tispiece to the Amsterdam, 1719 edition of the latter volume, after a design by F Ottems, and which shows the stufy of lepidoptera per- sonified as a woman who, accompanied by genii, studies vari- ous specimens of moths and butterflies while in the distance further example are being captured in an open field. Indeed, amateur women entomologists were quite active in early 18th- century England, for example, Eleanor Glanville and the Duchess of Beaufort and James Petiver also used some in his collecting; for Glanville and references to these others, see Wilkinson, 'Glanville', ppl49-60; WD Bristowe, 'The Life of a Distinguished Woman Naturalist, Eleanor Glanville (Circa 1654-1709), Entomologists' Gazette, 18 (1967), pp202-ll. Because of the rise of documenta- tion and scientific illustration, these insect collectors tended to exist on the margins of the art world and perhaps were even more deeply involved. Thus for example, Eleazar Albin has links to Joseph Dandridge a Huguenot who produced floral designs for the Spitalfields weaving trade, and it will be recalle that Hogarth through his apprenticeship to an émigré silversmith also was rooted in this community. For Dandridge see 'More about Joseph Dandridge and his Friends James Petiver and Eleazar Albin', Entomologists' Gazette, 18 (1967), ppl97-201. 51 Jacob Cats, Proteus of te Minne- beelden verändert in Sinne-beelden, Rotterdam, 1627, p52, and later editions. 52 See Lexikon der Christlichen Ikonographie, ed. Englebert Kirchbaum, Rome, 1968-1976, iy col 95 (' Schmetterling'), and cols 138-41 Q Seele'). 53 For artistic responses to this meta- morphosis in vanitas paintings see, for example, Sam Segal, A Fruitful Past, A Survey of the Fruit Still Lifes of the Northern and Southern Netherlands from Brueghel to Van Gogh, Amsterdam, 1983, p40; and Eddy de Jong et al, Tot Lering en Vermaak, Amsterdam, 1976, pp221, 228. 54 See, for example, an anonymous Scottish portrait of an unidentified young girl, cl620, whose dress is decorated with caterpillars; Rosalind K Marshall, Childhood in Seventeenth Century Scotland, Edinburgh, 1976, p48. Caterpillars and butterflies also frequently appear in samplers and other embroideries, both crafts commonly practiced by young women, see for examples, JL Nevinson, 'English Domestic Embroidering Patterns of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries', Walpole Society Annual, XXVIII (1939-40), pp4-5; and Donald King and Santina Levey, The Victoria and Albert Museum, Textile Collection: Embroidery in Britain from 1200- 1750, London, 1993, ppl6-17, 24-26 55 On defining their status, see Jean H Hagstrum, Sex and Sensibility, Idea and Erotic Love from Milton to Mozart, Chicago, 1980, p380; and importantly, NR Hiner, 'Adolescence in Eighteenth Century America', History of Childhood Quarterly, 3 (1975, pp2 53-80. 56 As Martin, Essay upon Plantership, p ix, observes, 'If he is born to a large estate, or has acquired it by industry, he must expect to be a member of the legislature, and of the military order also.' Also see Wells, Population of British Colonies, p40. 57 See the useful discussion of this connection in William S Hecksher, 'The Anadyomene in the Medieval Tradition', Nederlands Kunsthistorisch Jaarboek, 1 (1956), pp22-25. who notes, for example, the tradition of giving shells as erotic gifts to young maid- ens; and for a specific example, an analysis of Lorenzo Lotto's Venus and Cupid-.

Also see JA Simpson and ESC Weiner ed, Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford, 1989, sc 'urchin.' 60 Indeed there even was an emblem that seems especially per- tinent here, since it again recalls Elizabeth's shell collection, and were it known it could have fore- warned against such disasters as it was meant to remind the reader of the painful cost that love could demand. Vaenius, Amorum Emblemata, pp202-03, includes a device comprised of shells scat- tered along a shoreline and in the foreground, an injured lover, his breast having been pierced by an arrow from the cupid perched beside him. The accompanying motto from Ovid, Ars Amatoria II, p519, reads ' Litore quot conchae, tot sunt in amore dolores. Et quot silva comas, sidera Olympus habetV ('The shells that are on the shore, so many are the pains of love...') 61 Although he does not fully exploit the sexual imagery present, see the discussion of several of these sorts of themes, such as male callers scratching the ears of a lap dog, or the dripping of gold coins into a prostitute's lap - a recollec- tion of the Danae legend, in Peter C Sutton, Seventeenth-Century Dutch Genre Painting, Philadelphia, 1984, ppl52-54, 258. 62 See the discussion in Nauman, van Mieris, II, ppl9-20. The best- known use of this image is later, Greuze's Les Oeufs Cassés, 1756, for which see Edgar Munhall,/e««- Baptiste Greuze 1725-1805, Hartford, 1976, p40. Similarly there is the image of the broken pot, painted for example by Gainsborough, Cottage Girl with Pitcher and Dog, 1785, for which symbol see PJ Vinken, 'Some Observations on the Symbolism of the Broken Pot in Art and Literature', The American Imago, 15 (1958), pp 149-74; and for these and still others of the sort, see Philip Steward, Engraved Desire: Eros, Image and Text in the French Eighteenth Century, Durham, NC, 1992, pp75-82. 63 Alexander Pope, Minor Poems, ed Norman Ault [The Twickenham Edition of the Poems of Alexander Pope, VI] , New Haven, 1954, ppl6l-63.

Also see Baridon, 'Hogarth the empiricist', ppl93-94. 68 For the scene and the identifica- tion of these works see Paulson. Hogarth's Graphic Works, I, p273. Hogarth also dealt with father- daughter incest in his Satan, Sin and Death, cl735-38, a scene from Milton's Paradise Lost : see David Bindman, 'Hogarth's 'Satan, Sin and Death' and its Influence', Burlington Magazine, CXXII (1970), ppl53-59; and Paulson, II, ppl08-09. 70 On the excesses of masquerades see Terry Castle, 'Eros and Liberty at the English Masquerade, 1710- 1790', Eighteenth Century Studies, 2 (1983-84), ppl 56-76. 71 For the portrait see Ellen Miles, Thomas Hudson 1701-1779, exh cat., London, 1979, no. 22. 72 Returning to Elizabeth Mackinen, it might be noted that molluscs also could be associated with the Virgin, in part because it was believed they generated sponta- neously and also because of their association with pearls, which were thought to be born of a 'celestial conception'. The sea urchin, commonly red in colour, also relates as it was familiarly know as a sea-apple and can con- sequently be linked with Eve and temptation. For the association of shells with the Virgin see Kuechen, 'Wechselbeziehungen', pp479-87; and Sven Otto Achen, 'Det Symbolske', in Konkylien og Mennesket, pp53-59; and for the sea-apple, Rumpf, Amboinsche Rariteikamer, pp29-37; and the Oxford English Dictionary , sc 'sea- apple.' 73 Another work contemporary with the Hogarth that deploys this theme is Stephen Slaughter's 1747 portrait of the children of Sir Edward Walpole that shows his son surrounded by his three sisters - the three graces? Like Paris he holds an apple, obviously taken from the basket held in a sister's lap; see Rococo: Art and Design in Hogarth's England, London, 1984, pp226-27. An earlier example by JM Wright, cl676, pairs the siblings James Cecil, 4th Earl of Salisbury, and Lady Catherine Cecil. He is not yet breeched and the composition includes flowers, shells, references to Cupid, and an offering of a pomegranate: see Erna Auerbach and C Kingsley Adams, Painting and Sculpture at Hatfield House, London, 1971, ppl75-76; and John Michael Wright, The King's painter, Edinburgh, 1982, p74. The pomegranate associated with Proserpine as a mark of virginity and fertility is also much noted erotically in Canticles , eg, iv, 13, vii, 12, viii, 2: see Lexikon der Christlichen Ikonographie, II, cols. 198-99 ('Granatapfel'). Later than the Hogarth is Gainsborough's Heneage Lloyd and His Sister. Shown with interlocking arms he holds a bow and she an arrow: see JW Goodison, Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, Catalogue of Paintings III, The British School, Cambridge 1977, pp80-81, who also questions these traditional identifications. 74 For Fielding and Hogarth, see Robert Ethridge Moore, Hogarth's Literary Relationships, Minneapolis, 1948, pp77-l6l; and Paulson, II, pp 19 1-202, 360-81. 75 See Fielding, Joseph Andrews, vari- ous ed, books iy XII, XV; and for Fielding's use of incest in the novel and in the slightly later The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, London, 1749, see TGA Nelson, 'Incest in the Early Novel and Related Genres', Eighteenth Century Life, 16 (1992), ppl52-58; and Barry D Bost, 'Incest theme in Tom Jones', American Notes and Queries, February, 1965, pp84-85. 76 See Vincenzo Cioffari, 'A Dante Note: Heliotrpoium', The Romanic Review, 28 (1937), pp59-62. An early use in art is with a Pisanello medal cl447 dedicated to Lodovico Gonzaga, which, howev- er, uses the marigold in place of the sunflower: see David Chambers and Jane Martineau, Splendours of the Gonzaga, London, 1982, pl09; and Mirella Levi D'Ancona, The Garden of The Renaissance, Florence, 1973, p226, with references to Filippo Picinelli, Mundus Symbolicus, Cologne, 1680-81, 1, p647. 77 By contrast Holland with its strong republican tradition had little need for such symbolic testimonials to authority and in their emblem books the Dutch preferred to emphasize the amorous and reli- gious aspects of the image. This point is made by J Bruyn and JA Emmens, 'The Sunflower Again', p96. An exception is DeHeem's portrait, cl667, of a youthful Prince William of Orange, later William III of England which does include the flower and which may well have been made with England in mind; see Bergstrom, Dutch Still-Life, pp208-10. 78 Francis Thynne, Emblemes and Epigrames, ed FJ Furnival (Early English Text Society, no. 64), London 1876, ppl9-29; and for another example, HG, The Mirrour of Majestie, London, 1619, pp20-21.

From various Antiguan sources, some account of his location in this peri- od can be determined, but not enough to either affirm or deny such a voyage. For example, recall- ing that he also practiced as a lawyer, he is listed as an executor in wills of 22 November 1746; 18 November 1747; 23 February 1748; and 31 March 1748, though this role does not confirm his presence on or absence from the island on those dates. He does however appear at the meeting of new ses- sion of the Assembly, 25 July 1749: for these various dates see Oliver, I, pp cviii, 274, 276, II, ppl31, III, pp6l, 67. It may be coincidental, but it is worth noting that there also appeared in London in 1747, purportedly for health reasons, the Mackinen's Antiguan cousin, George Thomas, who since 1737 had been serving as Governor of Pennsylvania; on his presence see his entry in Dictionary of American Biography , 18, p34l. From 1753-66, when he retired to England, he held appointment as Governor of the Leeward Islands. 99 In his work these feelings were most strongly expressed in The March to Finchley, 1746; the por- trait of Lord Lovat, whose likeness he took prior to Lovat's appear- ance on the executioner's block in April 1747; and by his design for the headpiece for his friend Henry Fielding's Jacobite Journal, 17 December 1747. For The March to Finchley, see Benedict Nicolson, The Treasures of the Foundling Hospital, Oxford, 1972, pp277-80; for the Lovat, Paulson, Hogarth's Graphic Work, I p276. Also see the useful discussion of his politics in Fredrick Antal, Hogarth and his Place in European Art, London, 1962, pp2-21; Ronald Paulson, Popular and Polite Art in the Age of Hogarth and Fielding, Notre Dame, 1979, ppl90-207 ('The '45 and Bonnie prince Charlie'), whose primary focus is Henry Fielding, but who does give con- sideration to Hogarth, ppl91-92; and Paul Monod, 'Painters and Party Politics in England, 1714- 1760', Eighteenth Century Studies, 26 (1993), pp389-92, who sees Hogarth as a Whig who opposed the Hanoverians as foreign inter- lopers. But it should be recalled that Hogarth was nevertheless an anti-Jacobite and thus compromised. More generally on the artistic response to the Jacobite defeat, notably in popular prints, see the useful survey, Richard Sharp, The Engraved Record of the Jacobite Movement, Aldershot, 1996, esp ch 2. 100 For the Antigua Mackinens and their Hanoverian allegiances see Daniel MacKinnen, A Tour thru the British West Indies in the Years 1802 and 1803 , London, 1804, pp73-75; and MacKinnon, p69-70. Perhaps Hogarth even placed the Mackinens before a Palladian revival house as an additional way of establishing their credentials, for the building of country houses in this style was linked with Whigs who had earned their wealth in trade; for which see John Summerson, 'The Classical Country House in 18th Century England' , Journal of the Royal Society of Arts, 107 (1959), pp539- 88. 101 Royal Museum of Scotland, acq. No. A1988.263. 102 For the portrait see Oliver Millar, Pictures in the Royal Collection: Tudor, Stuart, and Early Georgian Pictures, London, 1963, pp98-100. 103 For this portrait, done while Charles I was a prisoner, see Olivier Millar, Sir Peter Lely 1616- 1680, London, pp38-39. 104 Myra Nan Rosenfield, Largillière and the Eighteenth Century Portrait, Montreal, 1981, pp82, 100-05, 207-11, who discusses the Stuart children's portrait and its relationship to Van Dyck and Lely. 105 For Hogarth and his reactions to these artists see Antal, Hogarth and His Place, pp36-38, 44-46. 106 For the dog see Mary Forwood, The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, 3rd edn, revd, London, 1974, pp4-20, who also notes the legend that such a dog was found within the skirt of Mary Queen of Scots when she was executed in 1563; and the discussion of Gisbert van der Kuyl's 1615 portrait of such a dog, in John Jacob, to pre- serve and enhance, London, 1975, p22. For its appearance in Stuart portraiture, for example in Largilliere's 1691 likeness of the Old Pretender, see Dynasty: The Royal House of Stewart, ed Rosalind K Marshall, Edinburgh, 19XX, pl99; and for its appearance in Van Dyck's portraits of Charles I's children, the likenesses of the three cited above, and a later, 1637, picture of five, both includ- ing the future Charles II, see Millar, Pictures in Royal Collection , I, pp098-101. For Hogarth and the pug, which appears beside him in his 1745 self-portrait, see Paulson, II, pp260-64, 429-30. 107 It also can be argued that the painting dates to after the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, 17 October 1748, which ended the War of Austrian Succession and diplomatically by international agreement conclu- sively finished Stuart claims to the British throne; or at least this date made the anti-Stuart iconography even more pertinent. It also offi- cially removed any threat to sea travel, though as noted above with reference to the convoy of 1747, shipping between the West Indies and England had already resumed. 108 MacKinnon, pp26, 31. 109 MacKinnon, pp51-52. 110 See Paulson, Emblem and Expression, pp35-36; and Paulson, Popular and Polite Arts, pp96-96. Ill In 1757 or 1762, by most modern accounts, Hogarth did a portrait of at least one other Antiguan, Samuel Martin (1693-1776), who had connections to the Mackinens. His maternal grandfather was John Yeamans, Attorney-General for Antigua and a brother to Charity, the elder Mrs Mackinen: see Oliver, II, pp240, 270. His father, also Samuel Martin, was author of the above-cited Essay on Plantership (Antigua, 1750). From 1742-44 Martin, a London trained barrister, who was probably born in Antigua, served as Deputy-Agent for the island, and from 1747-74, he sat in the House of Commons. He maintained close relationships with Antigua and with the island community in London, being a friend for example of John Baker, who also records meetings with Hogarth in 1759 and and in whose diary Martin frequently appears 1762 (eg, 4 February, when Martin and Hogarth were with Baker at a dinner party); see Philip C York, The Diary of John Baker, Barrister of the Middle Temple, Solicitor- General of the Leeward Islands, London, 1931, passim, and for Hogarth, ppl20, 130, 164. On February 13, 1757 (p91), Baker also records a dinner party that included 'Mr. Mackinnen', whom the editor identifies as Donald Mackinen, a planter on St Kitts and a brother to William, father of Hogarth's sitters. In another con- nection to the family, it might be observed that Martin was close to George Thomas, the younger Mackinen's cousin, who eventually served as Governor of the Leeward Islands. Of him Martin wrote an extensive obituary, The Gentleman 's Magazine, 1775, p421. The Martin's portrait, now in the Koriyama City Museum of Art, Japan, indicative perhaps of the closeness of their friendship, remained in the artist's collection until his death (1764), when it came as a gift to the sitter in the painter's, II, pp240-41, 244; and for the fullest account of Martin, Sir Lewis Namier and John Brooke, The House of Commons 1754- 1790, II, ppl 14-17. 56</page></plain_text>
