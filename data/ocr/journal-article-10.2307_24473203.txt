By exten sion, a full set (plus one) of the "Untitled Film Stills" (1977-80)—that early leap to maturity with a filmic conception of setting-up-the-shot and playing-to-the camera—is crammed so tightly together on two short walls as to defuse their individual narrative charge and bring into relief only a grid-like demonstration of the artist's well-known ability to assume an endless variety of alternative aspects. Similarly muted by interference and with held from close inspection, the "History Portraits/Old Masters" (1988-90) have been hung in the tiered format of a nineteenth-century portrait gallery, replete with disparate ostentatious frames. The "Hollywood/Hamptons Types" (2000-02), also framed and clustered, suggest a wall in a commercial photographer's studio.

The whole story about Sherman's tenth elucidation.

Any Sherman show that comprises some two hundred fifty of her photographs cannot fail to satisfy a real appetite for their specific qualities: the exactitude of the compositions, the scale, the color ters," embedded as they are in their pictorial sites, to be nothing less than projections of singularities constructed out of nothing more than obtuse details—as Roland Barthes understood them: outside of language, outside of meaning. In what is really an art of assemblage, Sherman's appurtenances and paraphernalia would eventually attain autonomy and sufficiency, a life of their own, in the "Sex Pictures" (1992), "Horror/Surreal" (1994 saturations, the lighting, and above all the myriad choices of pictorial 96), "Broken Dolls" (1999) and the magisterial "Fashion" (1993-94). elements, so canny as to evoke the uncanny, and often obscured in Only the tendency of a residual Beaux Arts sensibility to domesti reproduction. But an exhibition can also make an artistic practice cate American "edge" can explain why the curators have chosen to hard to see. Opting for the apparent neutrality of a chronological installation, co-curators Regis Durand and Veronique Dabin come down hard for a view of Sherman as fresh and complex as a platitu dinous press release—a view that, yet again, places the premium on tread so lightly, so decorously, so censoriously on the key transitional period of Sherman's three-decade career: "Fairy Tales" (1985) and "Disaster" (1986-89).
