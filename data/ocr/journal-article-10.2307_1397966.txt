<plain_text><page sequence="1">108 Book Reviews how Gandhi, the untiring seeker after truth, was able to respond in different ways to the changing conditions in his environment while still remaining faithful to his most fundamental beliefs. Throughout the volume, the author refers frequently to Gandhi's own writings and speeches, making extensive use of the files of Young India and Harijan. He also exhibits a thorough familiarity with the finest in Gandhi scholarship by both Eastern and Western authorities. The book actually contains over fourteen hundred footnotes and references. Bhattacharyya states in the Preface that he will be satisfied if this work raises controversies and provokes healthy discussion on the subject of Gandhian thought. The volume should have little difficulty in producing the former result, and the discussions to which it gives rise at least will be heated, if not healthy, especially among those followers of the Mahatma whom the author has charged with "can- onizing" Gandhian doctrine only to debase its true spirit, making it vulgar and banal by presenting it as a closed system of fixed theories "expressing the acme of absolute truth" (p. 485). Much of what has been written about Gandhi in the past has been merely pane- gyrical in character, devoid of any thorough-going analysis and criticism. This is not true of Bhattacharyya's book. Although some of his conclusions are still open to question, nevertheless, this is a very sympathetic and insightful study in which he has succeeded admirably in his attempt to understand and evaluate Gandhi from an objective and a critical point of view. EDWARD J. QUIGLEY University of Hawaii Japanese Religiosity, by Joseph J. Spae. Tokyo: Oriens Institute for Religious Research, 1971. Pp. 313. $7.50. Concern for understanding Japanese religiosity arises from the fact that Japan is the one nation of Asia which has attempted to absorb fully Western culture, while at the same time maintaining its own cultural identity. It has shown that it possesses a highly resistant core of religious feeling and insight which has made the progress of Christianity slow, despite the attraction of Western culture. Within this context Joseph Spae surveys in detail the manifold characteristics and aspects of Japanese religiosity and the points where it anticipates, coincides, or conflicts with aspects of Christian faith and outlook. He writes for scholars of religion as well as for Christian missionaries. His approach is phenomenological and deals with the cen- tral elements of Japanese religion. He leaves aside systematic historical and doc- trinal considerations of the particular traditions. The study begins with observations concerning methodological problems confront- ing the student of Japanese religion. The major issue is that Western concepts and methods of analysis developed in the field of sociology are not sufficient to grasp the "subtle, variegated and elusive" nature of Japanese religion. The diffuse character of Japanese religion makes it particularly difficult to study since religiosity is not</page><page sequence="2">109 always restricted to, or coincident with, institutional expressions. Nevertheless, glimpses of Japanese religiosity filter through social and individual moral and ethical ideals. Japanese religion appears as a highly experiential phenomenon, evolving in the course of Japanese history from cosmo-morphism through anthropomorphism to theomorphism which reflects influence from Christian interaction. In this develop- ment the awareness of global mystery and the emphasis on the feeling side of religion are outstanding traits. In more recent times there are evidences of a shift from a corporate to a more individualistic religious outlook, which is favorable to the progress of Christianity. In order to delineate the religious dimension of Japanese life, Spae undertakes a penetrating analysis of the value-attitudes associated with Shinto, Buddhist, and Confucian traditions. He also depicts the intimate relation of aesthetic interest in Japan and the significance for religion of Japanese intuitionism and Japanese lan- guage. In the depth of all these phenomena, the author traces suggestions of transcen- dence appearing in individual strivings for moral growth or perfection, in promoting the good of society within the context of Japanese national consciousness of being an "immanental theocracy." Within Japanese art and aesthetic vocabulary there appears awareness of the Numinous. In intuitionism, the awareness of Truth, rather than being relegated to intellectual acquiescence, demands action, as the true is iden- tified with the good. Japanese language, reflecting religiosity, presents a challenge to foreign ideologies like Christianity through its intuitiveness, emotionality, perfor- mance emphasis, and lack of concern for ultimacy. The last section of the volume offers a variety of materials for reflecting on the state of religion in contemporary Japan. These include observations based on several statistical studies, presentations of Buddhist religiosity represented by the teaching of Niwano Nikkyo of the Rissho-Kosei-kai, and the theological implica- tions of Shin-shu piety based on faith in the salvation of Amida Buddha, observa- tions of aspects of religious motivation indicated through studies of religious counseling situations, and finally an essay "Nishitani on Japanese Religiosity," by Jan Van Bragt. It is difficult in a short space to do justice to the erudition and sensitivity, acquired over many years by the author, which undergirds his study. In a well- documented and highly detailed manner, he offers the reader a mine of insight and information. While the work is comprehensive, the author might have devoted more space to develop the concept of "immanental theocracy" and how, centered on the imperial house, it forms the ground of Japanese self-understanding. Also the study of contemporary forms of Buddhist piety should not have overlooked the peculiar form of intolerance and absolutism of some segments of Nichiren tradition which contrast with the general relativism and lack of concern for ultimacy generally ascribed to the Japanese character. Although the author reflects great empathy and appreciation for Japanese culture and religious perspective, the interspersing of somewhat pietistic hopes for the future of Christian interaction with Japanese culture appears, perhaps inadver-</page><page sequence="3">110 Book Reviews tently, to betray an assumption, undefended, that Japanese tradition remains inadequate until fulfilled by Christian faith. It seems on the basis of his presentation that the Japanese have more to learn from Christianity than vice versa, though the essay on Nishitani qualifies this tendency. Further, the author is more aware of the evolution and changes in Japanese tradition than in Christianity. Nevertheless, the volume is a substantial contribution to understanding the religious foundations and expressions of Japanese tradition. ALFRED BLOOM University of Hawaii Buddhism and Society: A Great Tradition and Its Burmese Vicissitudes, by Melford E. Spiro. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1970. Pp. xiv + 510. $17.95. This is a beautiful product of the printer's art with twenty years of dedicated labor in relations between personality, culture, and society as its content. The author's major preoccupation is the question of why people hold certain religious doctrines and ideas, and with what consequences. It is full of information about Buddhism, especially as perceived from the vantage point of a Burmese village; and Southeast Asia, like India, is chiefly thousands upon thousands of villages. There is more information here about Burmese Buddhism than any single volume on the market. It also shows that a specialist can write in language any intelligent layman can understand. A growing number of anthropologists have come to grips recently with religion as a factor that is capable of molding and limiting human development more sharply than any other aspect of Asian culture. The author of this attractive book could conceivably be one of these. On the one hand, he helps the reader to see that religion is always embedded in the total culture and influenced by it in every respect. On the other hand, Buddhism is held to be "the single most important cultural force in the village and certainly its most important basis for social integration" (p. 18). The Burmese episode of Spiro's depth study of personality, culture, and society lasted for a year in a village of Upper Burma and ended with the coup of General Ne Win in February 1962. The author spent an additional three months in Thailand and one month in Ceylon. Some small notion of the great scope and complexity of the book is suggested by the following topics. "Buddhism and the State" is a topic reaching backward to Asoka and forward to more recent "political monks," with the British period included chiefly to point up the disillusionment and humiliation following failures of the post independence decades. Monasticism, "The Normative Structure," is described in its social structure, recruitment procedures, and in the character structure of its members. Veneration of the monks is described at great length, along with possible causes of this veneration. Spiro concludes that human nature inside and outside the sangha is much the same, except that the monastic order is more prone to vanity, self-praise, frequent hostility and even violence toward other monks, and is apt to disregard the welfare of others in his "overriding preoccupation with self." Monks who engage in political action, Spiro says, are no</page></plain_text>
