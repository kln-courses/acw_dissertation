<plain_text><page sequence="1">The problem of being and the question about God ' CALVIN O. SCHRAG ±§L International Journal for Philosophy of Religion 45: 67-81,1999. rn ^f © 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands. Purdue University, USA One of the most durable features of the legacy of philosophical thought in the Western tradition has been the linking of the question about God to the problem of being. From the time of Aristotle's definition of God as the Unmoved Mover in Book Lambda of his Metaphysics to Nietzsche's resound- ing proclamation of the 'Death of God' in Thus Spake Zarathustra, metaphys- ical concerns have occasioned inquiries into the existence and nature of God. It is thus that reflections on the meaning and reality of that which in Western religions has been variously named the 'divine', the 'holy', and the 'sacred', found its proper semantic matrix within the grammar of a metaphysics of theism. To ask about God as divine, holy, an object of worship, and ultimately normative from the perspective of a metaphysics of theism, is to ask about a being - a special kind of being, to be sure. Using the resources of a metaphysical grammar, God is defined as a being that is infinite rather than finite; eternal rather than temporal; immutable; impassible; pure actuality; immaterial, and without imperfection of any sort. This portrait of God as a very special sort of being achieved a categorial consolidation in the medieval concept of the ens realissimum. Thus it came as no surprise to be told by Saint Anselm that God is that being than which nothing greater can be conceived; or by Saint Thomas Aquinas that God is actus purus and first efficient cause; or by Descartes that God is the supremely perfect being; or by Spinoza that God is infinite substance. All of these definitions of God move about within the vocabulary of a metaphysics of theism, informed by a rather bold appli- cation of the metaphysical categories of essence and existence, substance and attribute, form and matter, act and potency, causality and dependence - to name just a few. Now as even the casual observer of the philosophical scene in our institu- tions of higher learning is quick to notice, the sub-discipline of 'Philosophy of Religion' (which has macle its way into the curricula of most American *An earlier version of this essay was presented at the 49th annual meeting of the Metaphysical Society of America, held at the University of South Carolina, March 1998.</page><page sequence="2">68 CALVIN O. SCHRAG colleges and universities) is to a great extent formatted along the lines of a metaphysics of theism, sometimes referenced as 'classical theism' by certain authors of philosophy of religion texts. The lead questions here have to do with the existence and nature of a divine being and its relation to a world of which it is in some sense the cause. What are the philosophical grounds for asserting the existence of such a divine being? What is its nature? How is it related to the world of material beings and the world of human culture? If this divine being is understood to be absolutely good in its ultimate normativity, how can we account for the existence of evil among the finite beings of which this divine being is alleged to be the cause? These are the principal questions that guide the inquiry of much of what we do in philosophy of religion, and we quickly note that these questions require a metaphysical grammar for their intelligibility. One asserts (or denies) the existence of such an entity. One devises a table of metaphysical attributes to define the entity's essence. One applies the category of causality to explain the relation of the divine entity to the empirical world. One solicits categories of ideality and actuality to frame the perplexing problem of evil. And thus we see how theology as the logos/word/discourse about God becomes linked to metaphysics as an inquiry into the meaning, structure, and modes of being. But things are never quite that simple in dealing with the issue at hand as first would appear to be the case. I guess they seldom are that simple when metaphysical and religious interests are addressed! They are neither that simple with respect to inquiries within the relatively standardized format of 'philosophy of religion' nor with respect to the story of metaphysics as inquiry into the problem of being. First off, the terrain of philosophy of reli- gion is not all that evenly terraced. To be sure, issues in the metaphysics of theism (which throughout its history developed hand in glove with an epistemology of theism), and particularly those occasioning the interminable debates on theism versus atheism, define much of the topography of philos- ophy of religion. There are, however, also non-metaphysical approaches to religious beliefs and practices. We have learned from the likes of Tertullian, Pascal, Kierkegaard, Karl Barth, and others that there is a distinction of some consequence between the God of the philosophers and the God of Abraham, Issac, and Jacob - between God defined as First Cause and Infinite Substance and as manifested in the Christ-event. There is also the tradition of Western mysticism (as represented by Meister Eckhart, Jacob Boehme, Saint Teresa, Saint John of the Cross, to name but a few) in which the linkage of meta- physics and theology becomes somewhat more tenuous. Yet, this linkage is never entirely severed. A careful examination of the grammar and concepts used in classical mysticism will show that the mystical for the most part continues to reside in the metaphysical, evidenced in the mystics employment</page><page sequence="3">THE PROBLEM OF BEING AND THE QUESTION ABOUT GOD 69 of the binary grammar of the finite versus the infinite, the temporal versus the eternal, the material versus the immaterial. As the terrain of philosophy of religion is not all that evenly contoured, so also is this the case with the landscape of metaphysics, which displays its own detours and dead ends, menacing precipices and turbulent rapids. To navigate the seas of metaphysics requires that one heed the sirens in steering one's course between multiple manifestations of the legendary Scylla and Charybdis. As our proverbial 'every schoolboy' well knows, there have been differing - and sometimes opposing - definitions of the nature and task of metaphysics throughout the history of philosophy. And these differing definitions each had their own delimitations and aporia with which to deal. Aristotle had much to do with getting the ball rolling on matters meta- physical when in Book Gamma he defined metaphysics as an inquiry into the problem of 'being qua being'. But this problem/issue/subject matter of inquiry, from its very beginning, ushered in an unavoidable ambiguity. The problem can be formulated on the one hand as an inquiry into the totality of beings, geared to a description of the different kinds or modes of being and an explanation of their relations with each other, and possibly with themselves insofar as some of the forms of being were considered to be amendable to self-predication. The classical categories of substance, causality, and relation appeared to be particularly helpful in addressing these concerns. But then there was also the facet of the problem or issue that required an inquiry into the way or the manner in which each of these beings, in their referen- tial togetherness, are. Here the being-problem takes on a different point of departure and a different telos, proceeding from an inquiry into the meaning of 'to be' with the expressed goal of achieving an understanding of what it means 'to be' as a human being, and possibly also what it means 'to be' as a gazelle and a field mouse, all the way down to the 'to be' of molecules and atoms. Since the time of Heidegger in particular it is common to refer to these two inquires as the ontic and the ontological respectively. Ontic inquiry address matters having to do with particular beings or entities (Seiendes) in their totality of causal connectedness. Ontological inquiry investigates the Being (Sein) of these beings, the 'to be' of their entitative status, the manner or way in which they show themselves or come to presence. Now it is the view of Heidegger that Western metaphysics has mainly followed the route of ontic inquiries, preoccupying itself with an investigation of the different kinds of being - physical, mental, spatial, temporal, mineral, vegetative, animal, human, angelic, and divine - and the peculiar relations and connections that obtain among these different types and orders, comprising some manner of a unity and totality. It is this thrust of inquiry that occasioned a variety of</page><page sequence="4">70 CALVIN O. SCHRAG metaphorical usages in seeking to illustrate the binding texture of the various modes of being, to wit, 'the scale of being', 'the great chain of being', 'levels of being', 'gradations of being', and the like. It is the considered view of Heidegger that the pursuit of this line of inquiry led in Western thought in particular to an occlusion of the other route of inquiry, namely an ontological investigation that sets its sights on an explica- tion of the 'to be' of particular beings. Western metaphysics has invested all of its stock in ontic analyses, and in the process it has marginalized the resources of ontological inquiry, the inquiry into the 'to be' of the particular beings. The Being of beings has been occluded, covered up, 'forgotten'. According to Heidegger, at least in his early works, the vagaries of metaphysics in the history of thought can be traced back to a widespread Vergessenheit des Seins. Hence, the requirement for a 'deconstruction' (Abbau) of the history of West- ern metaphysics so as to retrieve and revitalize the question about the Being of beings, a question that has been suppressed by the accelerated conceptual construction and planking of categories in Western philosophy in particular. The recalling/retrieval of this originative question is the assigned task of what Heidegger felicitously named 'fundamental ontology'.1 The story of Heidegger's distinction between metaphysics and funda- mental ontology and his project of deconstruction, as taken up and continued by both his right and left wing sympathizers (Gadamer and Derrida, for exam- ple), is quite well known, having become a favorite topic in certain philosophy seminars as well as among the cocktail circuit crowd. It is a story that has been told numerous times, and we need not rehearse its arguable contributions. But the ambiguity within the heart of the being-problem, to which Heidegger has called our attention (and Heidegger was not the first to discover this ambiguity - it is just that he got the most mileage out of it!), has some direct relevance for our topic. It is an ambiguity that has played a significant role in the thought of a number of philosophers and philosophical theologians who have dealt with the God-question. The names of Paul Tillich, Emmanuel Levinas, and more recently Jean-Luc Marion, are some that specifically come to mind in the present context. If the question about God is coupled to the problem of metaphysics as an ontic inquiry then certain consequences follow. If it is coupled to fundamental ontology as an ontological inquiry then certain consequences follow. If it is uncoupled from both metaphysics and fundamental ontology, then certain consequences follow. Our principal task in this essay is to track some of these consequences. When the question about God is linked to the problem of being as an issue for metaphysics and its categorical constructs then grammar about God assumes the burden of referring, in some manner of reference, to a super-</page><page sequence="5">THE PROBLEM OF BEING AND THE QUESTION ABOUT GOD 7 1 natural being, the existence of which needs to be established through some species of argumentation. And the arguments that are the most frequently catalogued and examined are the ontological, the cosmological, the teleo- logical, and the moral. Pursuing these arguments, revising and reformulating them from time to time, makes up a considerable portion of the agenda in our standard courses in philosophy of religion, framing the issue as having to do with the existence and the nature/essence of a supreme/supernatural being. Now as our oft-quoted proverbial 'every schoolboy' knows, this portrait of the divine as a supernatural being suffered serious disfigurement in the wake of Nietzsche's unsettling proclamation of the 'death of God'. With this highly metaphorical missive, Nietzsche called the world's attention to the demise of the concept of God as it had been understood in the history of the metaphysics of theism. Theo', in this sense at least, is dead. In actuality such a being had never 'lived', having been little more than a fictionalized abstraction in a Platonized Christianity. Also, this portrait of a supremely existing supernatural being became part of the metaphysical furniture that was at least rearranged if not consigned to the warehouse in Heidegger's and Derrida's projects of deconstruction, as well as in Tillich's program of 'transcending theism'. As the deconstructive turn in recent philosophy has pointed us to a terrain 'beyond metaphysics' and 'beyond epistemology', so its application to matters of religious belief and practices would quite naturally gear us in the direction of a space of inquiry 'beyond theology' - and, one might add, beyond any 'logology' that purports to be logocentric and foundationalist. Yet, one does well to press the inquiry into what resides on the fringes of the 'beyond', whether it be the beyond of metaphysics, epistemology, or theology. Since the publication of Richard Rorty's Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, the invitation to proceed 'beyond epistemology' so as to avoid the snares of foundationalism has been accepted in a number of philosophical enclaves. But what precisely resides on the hither side of the 'beyond' - if indeed anything - is not always clear. To be sure, Rorty informs us that the newly opened route leads us to hermeneutics, but we soon learn that for Rorty hermeneutics supplies basically a 'negative' function, functioning in the conversation of humankind as a 'hermeneutics of suspicion' if you will, undermining any and all foundationalist claims. Hermeneutics according to Rorty is through and through 'reactive' - reacting against the illusion that an 'accurate representation' of reality is available. At best this leaves us with a 'negative epistemology', which might have some species of an analog in the 'negative theology' of certain fourth and fifth century theologians.2</page><page sequence="6">72 CALVIN O. SCHRAG Further attention, however, we submit, needs to be given to the space of the beyond, be it the beyond of metaphysics, epistemology, or theology. Does it have any positive features, characteristics, determinations - or is it just utterly, totally, and unqualifiedly 'beyond'? If so, it is of course outside any solicitations of discourse and action. Does it exhibit any recursivity to that from which the movement to the beyond proceeds, from which the very ques- tioning about the delimitation of the boundaries of metaphysics, epistemology and theology arises? Does it in some way depend on, presuppose, or in some manner require still attending to the metaphysical, the epistemological, the theological, which in the course of the ascent (or the descent) is left behind? If I properly understand the celebrated 'deconstruction' offered by Heidegger, the dismantling of the categorial edifices of traditional metaphysics does not entail its 'elimination'. This is not a proposal for positivism. The dynamics of Heideggerian deconstruction falls out as a 'deconstructive retrieve' - a reclamation of a more originative questioning and discernment. Admit- tedly, the strategy that unfolds in Derrida's French version of Heidegger's 'deconstruction' is, of course, another matter. The relevance of the grammar of deconstruction for addressing the issue of the interface of the problem of being with the question about God, and for the projected move 'beyond theology', has its own complications. Clearly, the God of classical theism, defined as a supremely existing being who fills a gap for cosmological explanation, not only continues to produce philosoph- ical quandaries but also becomes problematic with regard to sustaining our religious interests. The legion of difficulties in connection with the criteria of validity in mounting compelling arguments for the existence of such a being are of course well known, to say nothing about the soundness of the proofs within the traditional arguments. And there comes a time when one must ask what it is that is sought after in these apparently interminable efforts to demonstrate the existence of a supernatural cause of the world. What is the alleged 'referent' of the arguments? And indeed might this alleged referent be a 'misplaced referent'? Nietzsche's Zarathustra had already apprised us that such is indeed the case. Zarathustra's heralded proclamation of the 'death of God' stands as one of more dramatic announcements of the bankruptcy of the concept of God in classical theism. Freud, also, via the curious serendipity of his psychological atheism testified of the anthropomorphic consequences of the classical concept of God that in the end lead to a reduction of the divine in which God is nothing more than an extension of the father image. Pinning our religious concerns and aspirations on the existence of such a being is destined to lead both to a metaphysical and a religious disappointment. One would do well to speak of God neither as 'a being' nor even as 'the highest being', and further to speak of such a being as 'existing' may indeed involve</page><page sequence="7">THE PROBLEM OF BEING AND THE QUESTION ABOUT GOD 73 stretching the category of existence beyond its elastic limits. The referents of the metaphysical categories of essence and existence, in this arena in any case, remain forever undecidable. Now whether they remain undecidable in other arenas as well, as some postmodernists have maintained, is an issue which it is necessary to address but which needs to be reserved for another occasion. Tillich, in his project of Transcending Theism', with its main operative metaphor of The God beyond God', is particularly helpful in delineating the consequences of linking the question about God to metaphysics as an ontic inquiry. And one of course does not have to read all that many pages of Tillich's extensive published works to notice the rather heavy indebtedness to Heidegger. Tillich is of the mind that to characterize God as 'a being' some- how existing alongside other beings is not only philosophically untenable but also blasphemous and idolatric from a religious perspective. So we are enjoined to rescue God-talk from metaphysics. But what about the utilization of a fundamental ontology that preoccupies itself with the Seinsfrage rather than with the metaphysical schematization of a totality of beings in devising a proper grammar about God? It is here that matters become more interesting, but also unfortunately much more complicated. Although Tillich jettisons the metaphysical grammar of classical theism, he still finds Heidegger's project of fundamental ontology useful in talking about even the 'God beyond God'. Indeed, the first thing that we can say about God, according to Tillich, is that he is 'Being-Itself. Hence, the question about God, although liberated from the inquiry standpoint of metaphysics, remains linked to the Seinsfrage, calling upon the services of a fundamental ontology.3 Now whether Heidegger's theology, or his 'a-theology' as it might be more appropriately called, retains this linkage of God with Being that Tillich appears to make explicit, is one of the proverbially moot questions. Jean-Luc Marion, in his provocative but extraordinarily difficult work, God Without Being, is of the mind that Heidegger does indeed delimit the meaning of God within the confines of the Seinsfrage. I am disposed to believe that Marion is only half right about this, principally because of his failure to follow out the consequences of Heidegger III. But these are all issues for another day - issues having to do with the theological/antheological views of Heidegger; the Heidegger-Tillich connection; and Marion's interpretation of the wider scene.4 Our interests in the present essay have to do with a thought experiment of our own on how one might proceed beyond theology by severing and then possibly re-aligning in some fashion or other the problem of being with the question about God. And we purport to carry through our thought experi- ment by exploring two sites or regions from which the question about God</page><page sequence="8">74 CALVIN O. SCHRAG might be reasked without purchases on the presuppositions and principles that have guided not only the traditional metaphysics of theism but also the more recent Heidegger inspired reflections on the ontology of the Divine. The one site we will name the hermeneutics of acknowledgement. The other site we will call the phenomenology of response. That which provides the dynamics or catalyst that energizes these two sites of acknowledgment and response is the eventuation of the gift. It is the gift, in its giving and its being received, that stimulates the 'new economy' of divine-human transactions. By necessity it is a 'new' economy, for we are no longer dealing with the old economy of distribution and exchange, in which gifts could neither be given nor received. It is thus incumbent upon us to clarify the semantic entwinement of acknowledgment, response, and gift as it figures in our post-theological grammar. The hermeneutic of acknowledgment in our deconstructed God-talk comprises an effort to proceed beyond the epistemology that buttressed classical metaphysics of theism and to do so without jettisoning the compo- nent of knowledge. The knowledge at issue in the event of acknowledgment has to do with a discernment of alterity, an interpretive decipherment of tran- scendence, a confronting of that which is other, an encounter with exteriority. Instead of an epistemology of recognition, in which that which is known is represented via subsumption under a guiding concept, answering to criteria that are laid out in advance, a hermeneutics of acknowledgment is solicited by the impingement or incursion of that which is other. The principle point here has to do with proceeding beyond knowledge construed within the construct of a recognition in conception, whether this recognition be that of a recollec- tion of preexisting ideas or forms (Plato) or a recognition enabled by apriori principles within the very structure of the human mind (Kant). Knowledge borne by acknowledgment is not formulated in advance of the interpretive decipherment of the other in its incursive disclosure. It proceeds from the dynamics of the encounter of the mind with that which is other rather than from the interior of an isolated epistemological subject. The discernment of alterity is clearly the pivotal feature in a hermeneutics of acknowledgment, heralding the incursion and disclosure of transcendence. It is the otherness of the other that defines the event of transcendence in the self-other relation. Indeed, alterity and transcendence are two sides of the same coin. To experience transcendence is to experience that which is other. Now admittedly there are different degrees and modalities of transcendence. There is the immanental or intramundance transcendence of perception, language, social practices, and institutional forms. Husserl referenced this transcendence- within-immanence as the principal structure of perception when he distinguished the perceived object from the object-as-</page><page sequence="9">THE PROBLEM OF BEING AND THE QUESTION ABOUT GOD 75 perceived. The perceived object transcends the object-as-perceived by virtue of its inexhaustibility within any of the presentative profiles of the intend- ing consciousness. Language also illustrates an economy of transcendence. One always speaks from a language and from a tradition of already deliv- ered significations. Such an economy of transcendence is also operative in the domain of human action. Our embodied acts are always contextualized within a history of social practices that transcend their particularized inscrip- tions;' individualized actualization proceeds always against the backdrop of institutions and social forms that antedate our having come to be. These are all illustrations of an encounter with that which is other, with a meeting of transcendence; but this is still a transcendence within the economies of intramundance perception, discourse, and action. There is, however, a more robust sense and eventing of transcendence - a transcendence on the hither side of the intramundane economies of percep- tion, language, social practices, and institutional forms. This is transcendence in the guise of a radical otherness, an alterity that Emmanuel Levinas indexed as an 'absolute exteriority'.5 Ultimately this alterity/transcendence takes on the character and quality of mystery in that it remains inexhaustible in any particular intramundance economy or even in the totality that encompasses them all. It is this grammar of a transcendence as radical otherness and indelible mystery that fills the void resulting from the deconstruction of God- talk. Indeed, in moving 'beyond theology' one moves to the semantic and experiential region of transcendence and mystery. To talk about God is to talk about transcendence in its extramundane modality. The question about God boils down to a question about transcendence as radical alterity. But this space or region of radical transcendence that is the site of an encounter with what Levinas called 'absolute exteriority' is still lacking in definable content and existential import. It is at once nameless and faceless. Hence, further inquiry and exploration is required so as to enable us to land on a more positive feature of this transcendence as it relates to the concrete contexts of human affairs. We find such in the semantics of the gift - a seman- tics that is at once an elucidation of experience. The eventuation of the gift provides the peculiar content of the transcendence that we find to be at issue in religious discourse and experience. And here too we have some resources to aid us in tracking the principal matter at stake. What immediately comes to mind, of course, is Mauss's celebrated essay, Essai sur le don, and the host of succeeding commentaries that followed in its wake, including those of Levi-Strauss, Bordieu, Bataille, and Derrida. Derrida has given particular attention to the delimitation of the intramundance economies of distribution and exchange by focusing on the paradoxes of gift giving and gift receiving.6 But quite in advance of this preoccupation with the motif of the gift by</page><page sequence="10">76 CALVIN O. SCHRAG French philosophers, there is a significant literature on the topic going back to Kierkegaard, Saint Augustine, and early sources of both Jewish and Christian thought. The pivotal feature of the gift, and that which has particular relevance for our current discussion, is that the gift is outside the intramundane forces of production and consumption, distribution and exchange. The giving of a gift is not a transaction that has exchange value. Indeed the very grammar of 'gift- exchange' is semantically misleading. To offer someone in 'exchange' for a gift either that which is quite similar or quite different is in effect to deny the gift as gift. It amounts to a reduction of the gift to a commodity-item within the circularity of distribution and exchange in which the presentation of a gift becomes a debt that requires repayment. Now it was Kierkegaard who had already profoundly understood the rele- vance of the gift to the religious dimension of human life and specifically as this dimension figured in his characterization of 'religiousness B\ In Kierkegaard's celebrated stages or spheres of existence, it will be recalled, the aesthetical, the ethical, and the religious are set forth as dialectically interpen- etrating profiles of the existing subject. The religious sphere itself undergoes a two-fold modification into 'religiousness A' and 'religiousness B'. It is in the latter that the dynamics of the gift as unconditional love achieves its highest expression. It is unconditional in that it is freely given and expects nothing in return. It is a love that unfolds as a love for the sake of loving, and it continues in spite of being unreciprocated or unrequited. It is this unconditional quality and asymmetrical structure of love as a gift that testifies of its transcending status, transcending the economy of person to person relations that is stimulated by a distributive justice that defines human relations along the lines of symmetry, equality, and reciprocity. Love tran- scends the human all too human exchange value matrix of distributive justice. Veritably in the beginning was love, older than justice, and 'otherwise than Being', to borrow Levinas's quite marvellous title. Love as otherwise than Being places it outside the bounds of both ontic and ontological analysis and schematization. It is common in the literature to characterize the perspective on love as the supreme gift as elucidated by Kierkegaard as a doctrine peculiar to Chris- tianity. This is a mistake. To be sure, Kierkegaard's existential reflections need to be understood against the backdrop of the New Testament teaching on agape and the continuing interpretations and commentaries on this theme in the writings of the Church Fathers and later in the corpus of Medieval theology and philosophy. Yet, even a cursory investigation of world religious will provide ample evidence that Christianity does not hold the copyright to the theme of love, or even more specifically to the theme of love as freely</page><page sequence="11">THE PROBLEM OF BEING AND THE QUESTION ABOUT GOD 77 given. On this point one is reminded particularly of Emmanuel Levinas's rather remarkable epistle on The Ambiguity of Love' which draws upon the contribution of Jewish thought and Nishitana's emphasis on the importance of 'Compassion' in the Buddhist tradition.7 The intertwined phenomena of the gift and love as orthogonal to the religions of the world, both East and West, comprise a topic for exploration and analysis that has not received the attention that it merits. Our explication of the hermeneutics of acknowledgment has led us to the alterity of the gift, transcending the economies of reciprocity that structure our quotidian discourse and action, making manifest a gift that was not ours to initiate. But there is yet another aspect or facet to this acknowledgment of a gift that expects nothing in return. This other aspect has to do with the impact or the reverberation of this extramundane and transcending love in the corridors of human justice as they advance the telos of a harmonious social order. If the dynamics of this transcending love is indeed located only on the hither side, understood strictly as an 'absolute exteriority', completely independent of the economy of human discourse, individual action, social practices, and established institutions, then how does it impact on the require- ments of our daily existence? This may indeed be one of the problems in Levinas's use of the designator "absolute exteriority" in explicating the region of transcendence. Admittedly, one needs to acknowledge an asymmetry in the self-other relation, requiring an acknowledgment of the primacy of the other as constitutive of the being of oneself. And on this point Levinas and Hegel may not be all that far apart; for Hegel too realized clearly enough that self-consciousness is parasitic upon an acknowledgment of another self- consciousness. But then the Denkwege of Hegel and Levinas diverge. The former moves in the direction of a philosophy of identity; the latter posits a philosophy of absolute difference. The former mediates the self and the other and locates the transcendence of that which is wholly other within the depths of the self. The latter insists on an unwavering asymmetry of self and other and elevates the transcendent to a status of 'absolute exteriority'. Against Hegel we need to curb the striving for an idealist mediation of self and other, of the human and the Divine, within the requirements of a philosophy of identity. Against Levinas we need to attest to a relation without mediation between self and other, between the human and the divine, that would curb the proclivity of recourse to a philosophy of absolute exteriority and difference. Only via some such splitting of the difference between Hegel and Levinas will we be in position to address the resultant aporia and para- dox of the gift as unconditional and robustly transcendent and yet becoming efficacious in the polis of human affairs. This is an issue that has intrigued and perplexed religious thinkers over the centuries. How is unconditonal love</page><page sequence="12">78 CALVIN O. SCHRAG related to the requirements of a justice based on reciprocity and equality of distribution? How does it impinge on the telic designs of individual and social action? How can that which by its very nature cannot be commanded because it is freely given be translated into the sphere of duties and obligations? How can the supreme gift receive expression in the commandment that 'Thou shalt love they neighbor as thyself?' Kierkegaard's sustained wrestling with this problem in his book, Works of Love, is well known, as are other such efforts in both Western and Eastern religions. Our approach to this longstanding and knotty issue proceeds via a sketch- ing of a phenomenology of response that complements our hermeneutic of acknowledgment. It is the latter, as we have seen, that led us to an acknowledgment of the alterity of the gift in the guise of a transcending and unconditional love. The task of a phenomenology of response is precisely that of clarifying the structures of mundane and conditioned existence that make possible the reception of the unconditional, showing how the gift can be received and in some manner actualized through the performance of what we have come to call 'the fitting response'. Clearly, the project of such a phenomenology of response, culminating in the requirement of responding to prior thought and action, is extensive both in scope and depth, demanding a disciplined pursuit of the question 'What does it mean to be human?' And in pursuing this question the problem of being, formulated/reformulated as an inquiry into what it means 'to be', is indeed inescapable. So here we are enjoined to revisit our philosophical heritage and its ontological and meta- physical concerns. We do so, however, only after we have jettisoned the over extension of the problem of being in both its ontic and ontological manifes- tation, only after we have surmounted both the categorial constraints within a metaphysics of theism and the specters of a fundamental ontology. This leaves us with a phenomenology of response within the limits of an ontology of human finitude alone. But such an ontology of human finitude is sufficient for the purposes at hand, namely that of describing the texture of human discourse and action against the backdrop of the question 'How does the to be of human being become manifest within the economies of thought, speech and action?' The disciplined pursuit of this question will yield a portrait of the human self in its posture of being able to respond to the epiphany of the gift, and to do so with the resources for a discernment of its relevance to the requirements of justice in the affairs of our intramundane economies. Although the alterity of the gift does indeed provide the inau- gural moment, the power to respond to the gift in such a manner that our response is indeed 'fitting' to the circumstances at hand requires that the gift not become reified into an absolute exteriority at an unbridgeable distance from the aspirations of the human spirit.</page><page sequence="13">THE PROBLEM OF BEING AND THE QUESTION ABOUT GOD 79 We are now in position to sum up our project, which veritably is more like a 'prospectus' of a project yet to be developed than a project in some manner finalized. We have suggested certain strategies for thinking beyond the program of classical theism by way of a realignment of the problem of being and the question about God. This has led us not only to a jettisoning of the traditional metaphysical concept of God but also to a problemizing of latter-day approaches to the God-question via fundamental ontology. In all this the very grammar of God-talk has become suspect, followed by a recom- mendation for substituting the entwinement of 'transcendence/gift/love' for the classical concept of 'God' as some sort of supernatural being or even as the ground of Being-itself. The content of the transcendence at issue, as radical alterity, is the eventuation of the gift as unconditioned love. The apprehension and the praxial relevance of this gift of transcendence requires a hermeneutic of acknowledgment and a phenomenology of response. Without the coupling of acknowledgment and response, the dynamics and efficacy of the gift remains in limbo. Without the linkage of acknowledgment and response, the gift could neither be given nor could it be received. Notes 1. The principal source of Heidegger's sustained discussion of his project of 'fundamental ontology', which at times he names 'universal phenomenological ontology', is of course his classic work Being and Time, trans. John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1962). However, a condensed and consolidated version of the central features of his fundamental ontology as distinguished from classical and modern metaphysics is presented in the short introduction to the fifth printing of his 1929 essay on What is Metaphysics?

Rorty's take on hermeneutics as displaying an intrinsically reactive and negating function results from his identification of hermeneutics with abnormal discourse and edifying philosophy, which he then sharply contrasts with the normal discourse of systematic philosophy. 'Hermeneutics', writes Rorty, 'is the study of an abnormal discourse from the point of view of some normal discourse - the attempt to make some sense of what is going on at a stage where we are still too unsure about it to describe it, and thereby begin an epistemological account of it', Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979), p. 320. He then links hermeneutics as abnormal discourse directly to edifying philosophy, which he construes as a reaction and protest against the construc- tion of philosophical systems. 'Great edifying philosophers are reactive and offer satires, parodies, aphorisms. They know their work loses its point when the period they were reacting against is over. They are intentionally peripheral. Great systematic philosophers, like great scientists, build for eternity. Great edifying philosophers destroy for the sake</page><page sequence="14">80 CALVIN O. SCHRAG of their own generations', p. 369. One could readily concur with Rorty that hermeneutics has a reactive function to perform, but one must not overlook that it has proactive poten- tialities as well. It reacts against misunderstanding, ideological hegemony, and paralyzing system building. This defines its negating/critical function. But it is also prospective and proactive, exploring possible strategies for understanding self and society in a new way, enabling a reshaping of the present order of things through a pre-enactment of future possibilities. This defines its affirming/positive function. The point is that hermeneutics as a performance of interpretive understanding is both proactive and reactive, both positive and negative, in its critique and comprehension. 3. Tillich's case for transcending theism is most aggressively made in his book, The Courage To Be, originally published as the Terry Lectures delivered at Yale University. Summa- rizing his extended argument against classical theism, which he considers to be 'bad theology', Tillich writes: 'The God of theological theism is a being beside others and as such a part of the whole of reality. He certainly is considered its most important part, but as a part and therefore as subjected to the structure of the whole, he is supposed be beyond the ontological elements and categories which constitute reality. But every statement subjects him to them. He is seen as a self which has a world, as an ego which is related to a thou, as a cause which is separated from its effect, as having a definite space and an endless time. He is a being, not being-itself. As such he is bound to the subject- object structure of reality, he is an object for us as subjects', The Courage To Be (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1952), pp. 184-185. 4. Marion recognizes clearly enough that Heidegger continued to distinguish the tasks of philosophy and theology and that he denied any equivalence between God and Being. Yet Marion is of the mind that Heidegger never fully succeeded in liberating the notion of God from the ontic/ontological problematic. In the end, according to Marion, for Heidegger any 'theology of faith falls with the domain of Dasein and, directly through it of Being', God Without Being, trans. Thomas A. Carlson (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1971), p. 69. What Marion fails to recognize, however, is that in the development of Heidegger's wider project with its multiple turnings the Seinsfrage became increasingly problematized, leading to the quite stunning erasure of Being in Zur Seinsfrage (Frankfurt: Vittorio Kostermann, 1956), pp. 30-35. We have chosen to characterize this 'develop- ment' (which is more like a rupture) from Heidegger's earlier projects of pursuing the Being-problem as the eventuation of 'Heidegger III'. This comprises the second turning (Kehre) of Heidegger's thought, the first having involved the shift from the question as to the 'meaning of Being' (Sinn des Seins) to the question as to the 'truth of Being' (Wahrheit des Seins). For an explication of the two turnings in Heidegger's philosophy see Calvin O. Schrag, 'The Three Heideggers', in Philosophical Papers: Betwixt and Between (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1994), pp. 159-173. The consequences of the second Kehre, involving the erasure of Being, are clearly far-reaching. They veritably refigure the province of philosophy as it might relate to theology, liberating the question about God from the problem of Being. This in turn would move in the direction of an a/theology, in which the gods and goddesses of the ancients and moderns alike are seen as having undergone their own demise so as to make possible an epiphany of the divine that is 'otherwise than Being'. 5.
