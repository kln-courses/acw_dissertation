<plain_text><page sequence="1">in a period that has been characterized by the spread of nationalism, by indus- trialization, and by a growing world economy is it the case that the wars which have ended with endurable changes to the international arena have almost solely been those fought for self-determination and independence? Tel Aviv University AZAR GAT Two gems culled from The Good Reviewer's Guide to the Universe: 'what audience is the book aimed at?'; 'what are the basic assumptions of the writer(s)?' Modern Times. Reflections on a Century of English Modernity, ed. Mica Nava and Alan O'Shea (London: Routledge, 1996; pp. 272. ?45; pb. ?14.99), is intended for those 'studying and teaching in the fields of cultural history and cultural theory'. The assumptions are that theories are realities, not merely tools of analysis, that 'modernity' has an actual, indisputable, existence, and that a secure framework for studying 'cultural history' (in the limited and highly technical sense in which that phrase is used here) is provided by certain privileged texts, the products of such authors as Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno and Marshall Berman. As early as page 17 we learn that 'one of the features of modernity has been its global aspiration', and, as late as page 200, that after adopting a more generous spirit towards race relations in the g 5os, 'modernity took to the streets once more'. This is not merely 'nat- uralization' (as people who write this sort of stuff like to say of the behaviour of those they oppose), it is good old-fashioned anthropomorphism. One at least of the editors may wish to challenge me on this. Nava's own chapter, 'Modernity's Disavowal: Women, the City and the Department Store' sounds about as anthropomorphic as they come, but then on the second page of this chapter (p. 39), we are casually informed that 'modernity of course is a constructed narrative'. But 'narrative' as used in this kind of discourse is always represented as having materiality. Who, or what, is the subject of that glibly over-used verb, 'to construct', is never made very clear, though if one steeps oneself in the theory, it begins to emerge that whatever 'constructing' is being done is being done by wicked old bourgeois society. This book, then, is not written in accordance with the principles which underlie articles published in The English Historical Review. That made clear - and it must be made clear because there is so much obfuscating waffle about the need for interdisciplinarity and an end to over-specialization (let me never fly in a jet which has not been built by specialists) - I heartily commend this book to all historians. The metaphysical tradition in which it is securely placed has always depended upon rhetorical brilliance rather than the citation of evidence, so that everything in Modern Times, even when utterly unconvincing, is at least a joy to read. And even if 'modernity' doesn't actually exist, it really is quite exciting to have fine minds grappling with what it might be. Two chapters particularly caught my imagination. The first is Sally Alexander on 'The Mysteries and Secrets of Women's Bodies: Sexual Knowledge in the First Half of the Twentieth Century'. Using autobiographies, a certain amount of oral testimony and the famous collection of letters addressed to Marie Stopes, edited by Ruth Hall, the author presents an appalling picture of sexual ignorance and fear among young women in the 1920S and I930S. This, if I have understood aright, was 'pre-modern', sexual knowledge becoming 'modern' when it was 'embodied EHR Feb. 98 264 February SHORTER NOTICES</page><page sequence="2">in the institutions and practices of the Welfare State which sought, with patchy effect, to replace ignorance and trauma with reassurance' (p. 171). My mind kept turning to one of the most satisfying sex surveys ever carried out, that of I8,876 British men and women in I990 and i991, published in I994 under the editorship of Kaye Wellings et al. This conclusively demonstrates that British people today (women and men) are utterly happy and relaxed in their sexual practices. Has the change really come about so quickly? - and was the Welfare State the magic bullet? Alexander comes over as knowledgeable and authoritative, but somehow I found it very difficult to believe her. The other chapter is 'Replacing British Music', by Andrew Blake. Good social and cultural history ('cultural history' in the non-technical sense) is hard to come by: building on a fruitful distinction between the Great Tradition which 'proved attractive to the meritocrats (influenced by Reith and Leavis)' (p. 2I3), and 'high Modernism' (which 'became entrenched through the I96os expansion of the universities, and through the championship of William Glock at the head of Radio Three'), Blake presents - my belief still not totally suspended - an outstandingly interesting account of British music since I945. On the whole that goes for the entire book: not history, but fascinating none the less. The Open University ARTHUR MARWICK Few authors can claim to have achieved so much for the cause of making 'philosophy of history' available to a wider public than William H. Dray. Any publication from this most accessible and intelligent of philosophers attracts the attention of practising historians who - the minority, sadly - retain an interest in the speculative, second-order dimension of the subject, and they are likely to be particularly intrigued to watch Dray handle one of the great exponents of the art in his new account of History as Re-Enactment. R. G. Collingwood's Idea of History (Oxford: Clarendon P., I995; pp. xii + 347. ?40). That they will be disappointed says nothing about the worth of the book. It merely becomes apparent that Dray is speaking almost entirely to fellow philosophers, which is doubtless necessary, but makes one sad when Colling- wood is perhaps the one philosopher of history whom historians continue to read, and when Dray is one of the very few philosophical critics who has the patience and lucidity to reach an historical audience. Provenance explains a considerable amount. The volume began as a manuscript written towards the end of the I970S and then abandoned: its reappearance has much to do with the prompting of others together with the opening, after I978, of some of Collingwood's unpublished MSS in the Bodleian Library. Meanwhile, Dray had published on several facets of the argument re-worked here, so the book feels a little leaden to the reader and probably did to the author. By dwelling on Collingwood's insistence that past thoughts have to be re-enacted in the mind of the historian, Dray focuses on a theme of great philosophical richness which he follows through a series of reflections dealing with, among other issues, understanding, explanation, imagination, relativism and scepticism. His method is a touch formulaic: each chapter starts with a review of the previous chapter's argument, followed by an overview of what everybody else has said about the problem in question, leading to segments, separated by subtitles just as in The Idea of History, in which Dray agrees with X, EHR Feb. 98 I998 265 SHORTER NOTICES</page></plain_text>
