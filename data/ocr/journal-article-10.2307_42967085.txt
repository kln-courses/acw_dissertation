<plain_text><page sequence="1">'The Garden' and MarvelPs Literal Figures Dominic Gavin i In THIS ESSAy I TAKE UP a familiar feature of Marvell criticism, that of the poetry's tendency towards literal figure, the paradox of figure that seemingly denies its own power to refer beyond itself. While allegory points beyond its own means of expression, literalism is often a sign of the poet's tendency towards retreat, or self-enclosure in nature. The inclination towards redun- dancy in Marvell's symbols is often remarked on by critics. For Thomas Greene, the puzzle of the wood in 'Upon Appleton House' is that 'every- thing is replete with a significance which trembles on the brink of revelation but never passes into definition.'1 Similarly, Judith Haber has described the symbols of the wood as symptoms of causes that are not revealed.2 Here I discuss this tension between literalism and the need for any sym- bolic order to be interpreted in relation to the book of nature. The book of nature provides not only a context against which the poetry can be read, but a body of diverse traditions which the poetry critically reflects on. The pastoral poetry may be understood as commenting on the varied allegorical or interpretative modes (Augustinián, Neoplatonic, or the emblem tradition) that it employs, rather than conforming to any one of these. In the second part of the essay I attempt to justify this approach by concentrating on some stanzas of 'The Garden'. Certainly, this is to cover some familiar ground, but I believe that consideration of the poet in his 1 Thomas M.

Yet it can be misleading to think of the figure as cultu- rally normative, and scholars have recently evaluated it as a site of cultural and religious change in the early modern period.3 Certainly, much of Marvell's poetry can be read as displaying signs of tension and decline in this paradigm. The pastoral verse recurrently implies the loss of a basic tenet of the book of nature, man's place in its great ordered hierarchy, united with nature as part of creation to the Creator in a known and ordered cosmos. Harold Toliver places the pastoral poetry in the context of the development away from nature understood as providing a prototype of man, an identity in a universal relation, to a more modern, opposi- tional understanding of man and nature. He writes: In the seventeenth-century phase of this movement toward seculariza- tion, it became more difficult for the poet to consider nature a reflec- tion of the self, either a collection of revelatory symbols or as a 'macrocosm' corresponding in detail to the physical and spiritual structure of the microcosm. The subject- object dichotomy of later nature poetry began to replace the old system of 'integrative' or 'con- sistent' analogues. It is Marvell . . . who perhaps more than any other poet of the mid-century reveals the difficulty of making the transition from one to the other.4 Thus Toliver remarks on the eccentric humour of the poet in the wood of 'Upon Appleton House', that his 'reading in this increasingly outmoded book of nature required taking refuge behind a shield of irony'.5 3 As Klaas van Berkel and Arjo Vanderjagt write, 'From Raymond de Sabunde to Galileo Galilei . . . the notion was used to undermine traditional conceptions of nature and to open up the study of nature to other social and intellectual groups than the traditional ones of clerics and other scholastics' (in Aijo Vandeijagt and Klaas van Berkel (eds.), The Book of Nature in Antiquity and the Middle Ages (Dudley 2005) p. x). On the varied meanings of the book of nature in the early modern period, see e.g. Peter Harrison, The Bible, Protestantism, and the Rise of Natural Science (Cambridge 1988) pp. 64-265; see also Klaas van Berkel and Aijo Vandeijagt (eds.), The Book of Nature in Early Modern and Modern History (Dudley 2006).

Toliver's line of interpretation inclines us to think of Marvell's nature as something of a démodé convention at the dawn of modern science, one that 'does not work'. Arguably though, some of the oddities of Marvell's nature result from the book of nature's 'working', albeit in its own peculiar way. Marvell's revisionism in testing a cultural commonplace seems clear enough. Despite this datedness though, or perhaps because of it, the analogy of nature and text takes on new, discursive significance in Marvell. For instance, while the classical figure proposed a model for understanding nature borrowed from biblical hermeneutics, in 'Upon Appleton House' the poet's symbolic nature offers a critical analogy for contemporary biblical interpretations of history. As many commentators have noted, the poet's light fantastical readings of nature in the meadow and wood imitate and subvert the claims of those of his 'inspired' contem- poraries to see the divine hand manifest in history, and political events as fulfilling the patterns of Protestant typology and eschatology. Protestant literalism provides one kind of 'literal figure' informing the poetry.6 Here I am more interested in considering how the poetry might be read alongside the more conventional allegories of nature. The division of realms that the book of nature supposes is in broad contrast to the rhetoric of 'real presence' of the symbol in the pastoral poetry. The problem arises with the frequent claim in the pastoral poetry of an ideal unity or sufficiency. In 'The Garden', the wood of 'Upon Appleton House', and the Mower poems, the speaker supposes himself to be in an ideal state of nature, where the lost harmony of man and world still pre- vails. Here the bond between word and thing, sign and signified, has not been sundered. The pastoral romance of the return to origins takes place in that 'twilight region between the literal and the metaphorical', as Ernst Gombrich puts it, speaking of Renaissance allegory that permits 'the fusion between the image and its model or the name and its bearer'.7 We are never sure how much credence to grant this vision of nature, left to guess to what extent the poet's musings represent a concept of nature or 6 In his prophetic role, and in the treatment of such figures as Thestylis in 'Upon Appleton House', Marvell explores the paradoxical status of literal figures in Protestant typology, much as Thomas Luxon has described this figurative mode.

Alongside the play on pastoral topics, the poetry reformulates elemental features of the genre's appeal, a return to a state where things are no longer symptomatic of a truth that lies beyond them. Convention no longer exists, in a return to the origins of things. Nature itself provides the ur-language of the poet, fulfilling the widespread Renaissance aspira- tion for an ideal or universal language, while the Ovidian echoes of 'The Garden' bring to mind the adjunct role of myth in providing the etymol- ogy of words, their root meaning. Seeking to overcome the reduction of nature to convention in sceptical thought, the poet declares that, unlike lovers who carve the loved one's name on trees, he will write only that of the tree itself - 'wheres'e'er your barks I wound, | No name shall but your own be found'. Despite the tone of almost urbane irony that creeps in, the poet is rewarded for his faith in stanza 5: What wondrous life is this I lead! Ripe apples drop about my head; The luscious clusters of the vine Upon my mouth do crush their wine; The nectarine, and curious peach, Into my hands themselves do reach; (11. 33-8)8 In this hermeticised version of the land of Cockaygne, the poet's spiritual desires are temporarily fulfilled, if not wish-fulfilled. Marvell's garden presents a significant alternative to that of Francis Quarles, writing in the emblem tradition: Alas, alas; there's nothing can appeare, But onely Types, and shadow'd Figures there: This Dyall is the Scripture ; and the Sun, Gods holy Spirit; Wee , the Lookers on . . .9 The argument of the speakers in the poems cited - whether it is argued seriously or not - is the contrary. For the speaker of these poems, the garden, or nature, is the thing itself. No lament is sounded here about nature's surrogate truth, only (suggestively in 'The Garden' - 'beyond a 8 All quotations from the poems of Andrew Marvell are from Nigel Smith (ed.), The Poems of Andrew Marvell (New York 2007).

In the context of the book of nature it appears that, contradicting its proper role, nature is celebrated in Marvell for its symbolic power rather than for what it indicates. In what looks like nothing so much as a rec- reational or gentleman's pantheism, creation absorbs the poet's attention, while its Creator - the origin of the poet's 'original' nature - is discreetly forgotten. As symbolic nature becomes 'immediately physiognomical', Hans Blumenberg writes of the book of nature in the early modern period, '"readability" as an idea of experience becomes ... a second- grade metaphor'.10 For 'second-grade metaphor' we understand literalism. For the poet, his magic garden or wood is the place where higher and lower worlds meet and he can imagine they have never been sundered. What the symbol gains in real presence, though, it loses in signifying power, much as Brian Vickers writes of Paracelsus, that 'he pushes the correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm to the point where they become interchangeable, identical, as if fused with each other'.11 In short, Marvell's nature invites consideration as a symbolic text, even as, sundered from the burden of signification, it subverts conventional assumptions of its readability. What sense does it have, then, to speak of the garden-world, as critics sometimes do, as a site of allegory, or contemplation? Marvell can be seen as offering alternative ways to understand his garden. First and most obviously, the garden is an emblematic one, where plants become signs of innocence and quiet, and nature incarnates the beauty of truth. There is, though, another, more latent possibility, that what the poet practises is the renunciation of allegory. Marvell's figurative nature apparently exists to be enjoyed, rather than to be interpreted. Reversing the Augustinián and scholastic principle that the things of this world are to be used above all for understanding, the poet's criterion of truth is experiential, and that experience is curiously aesthetic. Since the symbols of the garden or wood exist to be enjoyed, the poet need not define or refine their presence (that would be gilding the lily). Identification with nature results in the paradox of a superfluous symbolic world, one that forgoes interpretation. 10 Hans Blumenberg, La leggibilità del mondo (Bologna 1984) p. 29.

The poet's resolve is to resist abstraction of any kind, lest the spell of nature be broken. Less is more from this point of view, though it leaves the poet in a double bind. Whereas, in the normal scheme of things, doubleness is the condition of allegory or raising figure to a higher or second meaning, we understand that doubleness in the magic garden would amount to a loss of purity, a semantic Fall. The poet desires a simple sense, purity in con- cordance with nature, but puns and homonyms, the connotative power of language and the figurai itself, all conjure multiple meanings. The double motion in the poetry - towards allegory, in some sense, in the profusion of figure, but also towards its effacement in the name of unity - is some- times repeated in the critical literature. Frank Kermode, connecting 'The Garden' with emblem literature, writes that in this poem 'sensual pleasure has to give way to meditation'. At another point he remarks (of the fourth stanza's account of the transformation of the nymphs), 'Here one needs quite firmly to delimit the reference, because it is confusing to think of laurel and reed as having symbolic significations.'12 It is tempting to think that there is a false problem being dealt with in such attempts to fix the meaning of figure, and that the poetry invites us to explore this kind of contradiction. The tension between mythos and logos, participation in the symbol and its translation, makes up part of the game the poetry plays, besides whatever specific significance these figures may traditionally have or be supposed to have by the speaker. Instead of a mys- tical nature, it is possible to think of a mystique of nature, one that refuses nature's transitive status as allegory. This can be understood as the explora- tion of an internal contradiction in the symbolic order, however, and not only an ironic regression to an outmoded vision on the poet's part. At this point it is useful to consider some of the varied traditions and contested meanings employed by the poetry in its depiction of symbolic nature. m Marvell provides a point of comparison for such eccentricities in 'On a Drop of Dew'. Here nature performs its orthodox function of analogy to the higher realm, while the sophistication of the poem illustrates the point that, as Geoffrey Hartman says, if the book of nature was a commonplace 12 Frank Kermode, 'The Argument of Marvell's Garden', in John Carey (ed.), Andrew Marvell: A Critical Antko logy (Harmondsworth 1969) pp. 250-65: 257-9.

Friedman, Marvell's Pastoral Art (London 1970) pp. 158-9.</page><page sequence="7">230 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY of Marvell's age, it was also part of a developed theology of nature, going back at least to the time of St Paul.13 An interchangeable figure for the 'book' is that of the mirror, taking us back to St Paul's description of worldly vision as seeing 'through a glass darkly', in the language of the King James Bible. Nature both veils and reveals the higher, intelligible realm of the divine. The failure of vision, of right interpretation, may be due to the capacities of the reader, unable to transcend the given and literal to achieve comprehension of what lies beyond it. For John Smith, an espouser of Christian Platonism and Marvell's contemporary, 'God made the Universe and all the Creatures contained therein as so many Glasses wherein he might reflect his own Glory . . . Good Men . . . find every Creature pointing out to that Being whose image and superscription it bears, and climb up from those darker resemblances of the Divine Wisdom and Goodness ... till they sweetly repose themselves in the bosom of the Divinity'.14 A corresponding vision of nature informs 'On a Drop of Dew'. Nature is at once the dialogic other of the soul and a world that must be transcended in the ascent of the dewdrop, itself a self- cancelling figure at the poem's close. If the tautological role of figure (1. 13) is typically Marvellian, the framework (which includes such Neoplatonic elements as the circular pattern of the soul's return to its place of origin) is conventionally religious. Instead of speaking of the book of nature as a tradition, it becomes useful to think of the pastoral verse as responding to a disparate heritage concerning nature's readability. The discrepancy we find between the status of figure in 'On a Drop of Dew' and the portrayal of the symbol as essential bond in 'The Garden' recalls the contrast between the classical/ medieval understanding of the book of nature and that developed in Renaissance occultism. The claim made for Marvell's pastoral figures that they are what they represent, and the poet's identification of mind and world derives in great part from the ontological bond between spirit and matter in Renaissance Neoplatonism or occult thought. This school of thought provides Marvell with a holistic world of correspondences, an ani- mated allegorical landscape; at the same time, the poetry obliquely 'remembers' the metaphorical status of creation as held by medieval Aristotelianism. 15 13 See Geoffrey Hartman's discussion of the Pauline context of 'The Garden' and the Mower poems in 'Marvell, St Paul and the Body of Hope', in Beyond Formalism: Literary Essays, 1958-1970 (London 1970) pp. 151-72.

While the sixth stanza offers a narrative of unity, there is in the last line an admission of disparity between the mind and what it is required to re-create within itself. On the one hand, the sixth stanza refor- mulates the identity of knower and known in occult thought, the micro- cosmic mirroring of mind and world. The mind is an 'ocean where each kind I Does straight its own resemblance find'. Ostensibly, this privileging of unity reaches its high point in the poet's 'green thought', the dialectical culmination of his identification with nature. Yet the stanza's conclusion actually reverses the premise which it imitates, in tacit, subtextual denial of any such correspondence. The stanza closes with the exclusion of figure from thought, settling instead for a contemplative abstraction. Perhaps the pattern of disjunction is Augustinián, as the poet's imagination, like St Augustine's memory, is revealed to be insufficient, 'too straight' (that is, narrow) to contain creation.16 The hermetic context has been central to many readings of the pastoral verse, though the emphasis here is not on the hermetic philosophy as such (as in Maren-Sofie Rostvig's pioneering studies17), nor the wider social significance of hermetic discourses in the mid-seventeenth century, tradition. A thinker of Aristotelian schooling might interpret it rationally by recommending the Pelican as a suitable metaphor for Christ. But the Neo-Platonist could at any time revive the popular conception which presupposes the idea that God himself pre-figured and represented His Charity in the habits of the Pelican' ('Icones Symbolicae', p. 149). 16 'Straight' for the modern 'narrow' can be found in 17th-century translations of Augustine's discussion of memory in the tenth chapter of the Confessions. Thus, 'Great is this faculty and power of the Memory, excesuely great it is, O my God. It is a vast and infinite place of receipt, &amp; it is a faculty of my Mind, and it belongeth to my Nature ; nor doe I my selfe comprehend all that I am. The Mind therefore seemes too strait, to possesse, and to vnderstand all it sels.' The context of these celebrated lines is highly Marvellian; in lines immediately preceding these, Augustine writes, 'Such things do I say within my selfe; and whilest I say so, the Images or resemblances of all those thinges, wherof I speake with the language of my Mind, are present': The confessions of the incomparable doctour S. Augustine, translated into English Together with a large preface, which it will much import to be read ouer first ; that so much the book itseļfe map both profit, and please, the reader, more (1620), British Library, pp. 482-3. Basing much of her reading on the Pimander and Foix de Candale's commentary on it, translated by Fairfax in his retirement, Rostvig argues that the poet's irony can be understood as part of a hermetic parable. For Rostvig, both 'The Garden' and 'Upon Appleton House', within their ironic forms, contain hermetic 'sermons on the necessity of liberating the mind'.

Nigel Smith's comment on the Plotinian influence on The Garden' appears to be typical of the critical response. Considering the second stanza, Smith writes that such influence does not make the poetry an instance of the teachings of this school. 'In effect, Marvell transfers the metaphors of Neoplatonism from the cosmic to the human scale, almost parodying Neoplatonic language'20 (although the reference here is to the Neoplatonism of the ancient world, this was still very much associated with the philosophy of Ficino in Marvell's time).21 One of the distinguishing features between different currents of her- metic thought was the differing evaluation of the physical world. As Wayne Shumaker has pointed out, a marked ambivalence with regard to the value of the material realm can be found in the hermetic manuscripts translated by Ficino, giving rise to contradictory positions in Renaissance hermeticism with regard to the status of nature.22 While the doctrine of 18 See Douglas Brooks-Davies, The Mercurian Monarch : Magicai Politics from Spenser to Pope (Manchester 1983) pp. 165-74.

The Poems of Andrew Marvell , ed. Nigel Smith p. 154. Smith is comparing lines from the Enneads with lines 41-6 in stanza 6 of 'The Garden'. A similar point might be made concerning the adaptation of occult figures to the nature -art debate. The 'doubleness' that troubles the speakers of the pastoral poetry is a recognisable adaptation of a hermetic discourse. In the occult tradition, duality is the type of fallen multiplicity and matter, with two as the 'lucklesse number of division', as Robert Herrick had it. Similar patterns of hermetic thought are evident in the androgyne fantasy of 'The Garden', as has often been noted. Giving a pastoral twist to this cabbalistic idea, art - the duplicity of man-made figure - is presented as a falling away from the state of nature. Now duality becomes the loss of the ideal unity of nature, rather than the loss of contact with the divinity or the ultimate good. Quotation from Robert Herrick's 'The number of two', in The Complete Pbetry of Robert Herrick, ed. J. Max Patrick (New York 1963) p. 525. On the varying interpretations of the number two in the occult tradition, see e.g. Wayne Shumaker, The Occult Sciences in the Renaissance: A Study in Intellectual Patterns (London 1972) p. 138. See Shumaker, The Occult Sciences in the Renaissance , pp. 211-32. Thus, in contrast to the monistic/immanentist tendency emphasised here, the hermetica could also inspire gnostic pronouncements such as Robert Fludd's description of nature as 'that dark deformity out of which the world was made . . . blindfould and deceiptful matter': Fludd, quoted in Robert Fludd and his Philosophicall Key, ed. Allen G. Debus (New York 1979) p. 89.</page><page sequence="10">MARVELL'S LITERAL FIGURES 233 the world-soul or microcosm formed part of a transcendent philosophy, its panpsychism, its proclamation of the unity of spirit and matter, made possible an evolution towards pantheistic vitalism in the early modern period, as in the manifestations of what Rogers discusses as the 'vitalist moment' of the English mid-century.23 A poem such as 'The Garden' reflects these ambivalences in hermetic thought, the paradoxes of its mys- tical philosophy of matter. Arguably, 'The Garden' echoes the attempt to bridge the gap between monism and dualism in the Neoplatonic and hermetic traditions. The doctrine of the world-soul contains both dualistic features, in its ultimate mysticism, and monistic ones, as in its principle of emanation (alluded to in the second stanza, as Smith notes) rather than creation (recollected in the sixth). John Macquarrie, discussing the difference between creation ex nihilo and emanationism, writes that the latter proposes that the world is not made but rather "'flows forth" from its origin'. According to this doctrine, the material realm maintains a closer relation to its origin. 'It participates in the origin, and the origin participates in it . . . emanation- ism does not necessarily lead to pantheism, but it does imply that in some sense God is in the world and the world is in God.'24 In the fifth and sixth stanzas of the poem, matter becomes a precipitate of spirit, abolishing the hierarchy that sets one over the other. The vanish- ing point of the poet's 'green thought' plays out a fantasy of identification with the point of origin, a fullness of the signifier that is only possible if the division of realms is forgotten. In the process, the distinction between immanence and transcendence is collapsed, as if nature had been elevated to the condition of being its own source. The sixth stanza acts out the pro- pensity towards mystical unity of self and world, even as it obliquely remembers the necessity of that world's 'annihilating'. The 'green shade' remains a metaphysics manqué, maintaining a 'residual dualism' in the poem, as Rostvig notes.25 The very notion that the book of nature should be esoteric already stands in contrast to another long-standing tradition surrounding nature's readability. The poetry reflects the discrepancy between the exoteric and the hermetic or esoteric interpretation of nature. In stark contrast to the tra- dition of nature as the 'book of the poor' or illiterate, the occult tradition 23 Rogers, 'Marvell, Winstanley, and the Natural History of the Green Age', p. 1. 24 John Macquarrie, In Search of Deity: An Essay in Dialectical Theism (New York 1984) p. 35.

While Browne could readily speak of the book of nature as 'that universal and publick manuscript, that lies expansed unto the eyes of all', he could also feel com- pelled to qualify this, as the quotation continues: 'Surely the heathens knew better how to join and read these mystical letters than we Christians, who cast a more careless eye on these common hieroglyphics, and disdain to suck divinity from the flowers of nature'.27 These lines imply a tension between two appealing models, between capacious and cryptic nature. Seemingly Browne, like Marvell's poet, finds a degree of comfort in obscur- ity, while retaining the older acceptance of this book's universality. Either way, Browne admits the possibility of a higher knowledge cut off from the common gaze, much as the poet in the wood admires his symbolic land- scape with a quasi-nostalgia; the discovery of the charmed, supernatural wood of 'Upon Appleton House' takes the form of a retreat, implicitly a loss and retreat from faith in a universally legible nature. The poet's sybilline book of nature (11. 577-84) is the province of an Adamic sage, not fit for an Adamic Everyman, though Marvell is content to pose as this too. The poet passes distractedly over the hermeneutics of the occult tradition, converting the mystical into the obvious and folkloristic, so to speak. In his failed seriousness, the poet can be said to re-read the her- metic book of nature, reducing the hieroglyphic sign to a transparency without second-level significance, as Haber says. Such forgetfulness has a comic highlight in the self-comparison to the hermetic arbor inversa in 'Upon Appleton House', in lines which Al Alvarez has compared to nonsense verse.28 Here as elsewhere, the poet presents us with a Menippean satire of the obscurities of hermetic lore. Outdoing his proposal in 'The Garden' to inscribe trees only with their own names, here the poet takes the more drastic step of proposing that he is, or ideally somehow once was a tree, Or turn me but, and you shall see I was but an inverted tree. (11. 567-8) 26 Arguably, the contrast between these two books may be present in the poems featuring the cultured poet and the Mower respectively, the Mower being both pagan and illiterate, two categories deprived of direct access to Scripture.

The upside-down tree is in that category of impossible symbols which, for the apophatic tradition, pointed the interpreter of religious texts beyond the plane of the literal or material to that of the symbolic. Shorn of its cosmology, the figure remains as a philosophical trope with the philosophy taken out, a cosmi-comic joke or rebus.29 Time and allegory are both manifested and simultaneously effaced by the poeťs need for a symbolic plenitude. The indifference to allegory marks the failed transcendence of the poet's project of reading in this poem, as in the case of his bizarre imitatio Christi (11. 615-16). Meanwhile, the 'I was' reminds us that this is play-acting in the present, the offer to reverse the effects of the Fall a fanciful regression on the poet's part.30 Hermeticism is also present in a diluted form in another source of the pastoral verse, the emblem tradition as it had evolved by Marvell's time. Critics have often commented on the affinities of 'The Garden' with emblem books. As in the works of compilers such as Whitney, Quarles, Withers and others, so in Marvell we find conventional allegory mixed with hermetic puns in the contemplation of nature. Critics such as Rosalie Colie31 and Frank Kermode have looked to these sources as significant guides to interpretation of 'The Garden' and other poems. Here again, though, Marvell appears to be providing a revisionist insight into the tra- dition from which he draws. It is surely relevant that, by mid-century, the tradition was more spent than not in any case, making the emblem another of those anachronistic or 'exhausted' genres that Marvell was so 29 Some commentators take the figure to be a positive one. C. A. Patrides points out that the inverted tree is a variation of the divine image in man, and so, for Patrides, the poet may be seen as effecting its restoration after the Fall. Yet the comic bathos here involves the opposing connotations of upside-downness, the divine image as alternately restored (following the hermetic and Platonic parable) or marred via the Fall, extending the motif of the Fall and the world upside down in 'Upon Appleton House'. See C. A. Patrides, Premises and Motifs in Renaissance Thought and Literature (Princeton 1982) p. 88. M.J. K. O'Loughlin also passes over the association of this figure with the Fall.

For Marvell, nature is sufficient to the day, and the poet fore- stalls awareness of the allegorical mode. Unlike these authors, the garden poet eschews exegesis. Compare the use of organic allegory in Palmer for instance; for this author, the palm becomes a symbol of baptism, courage and constancy (like Marvell, Palmer was not against punning on his own name), in contrast to the rejection of allegoresis in the first stanza of 'The Garden'.33 In the emblem tradition, the pun is another means of symbolic expression, a play on difference that apparently assumes the underlying organic bond of the signified and signifier, as sanctioned by the hermetic tradition. Marvell instead repeatedly points up the contradiction in the status of the metaphor as symbol. It is significant that much recent scho- larship on emblem books has emphasised their generic and semiotic instability. For Michael Bath, the emblem books' mixture of distinct generic modes such as hermetic figure and conceit raises the question of the sign's merely conventional status. At the same time, the force of con- vention allows for a 'process of naturalisation' of the conceit. So, writes Bath, 'it is often impossible to distinguish the hieroglyphic theories of the Renaissance, which conceived the book of the creatures as a language of natural signs, from rhetorical theory concerning figurative Î 34 constructions . These concerns are recognisably close to questions raised by pastoral verse. As homo Indens the poet has the alibi of wit for his conceits. Arguably though, poetic licence has no place in interpreting the book of nature. For S. K. Heninger, writing of the poetic treatment of nature as a divine scripture, The job of 'making' . . . becomes not so much a creation of some- thing new, but rather a discovery of something already prescribed in God's book of nature. The creative act rests more in selecting the 32 George Wither, A Collection of Emblems , introd.

For the poet, therefore, the framing of metaphors is an act of discovery and choice rather than of creating ex nihilo.35 A difficulty of Heninger's argument is the arbitrariness in any attempt to distinguish between reverent invention within the religious framework and poetic licence. For instance, in 'On a Drop of Dew' the poet's fic- tions depict the ontologica! fictions of nature; nature and the poet create copia , in contrast to the indissoluble unity of truth. In the hermetic-inspired poetry of Vaughan, or Traherne, it is appropriate to think of poetic inventiveness as a token of the poet's belief in nature as a book of signs. Yet the question of disparity between figure discovered in nature and its invention by the poet is wholly apt in the case of Marvell's pastoral poetry, which has as a hallmark the naturalised or apparently 'found' conceit, the poetic persona's wondering contempla- tion of what is most likely to be his own fantastic creation (or bookish memory). This supplementary logic seems to me to be central to interpretation of ťThe Garden', and worth emphasising.36 In Marvell, the poetic imagin- ation constitutes something other than a simple positive; rather, it is the implicit token of a subjective or fallen consciousness, as to add to the book of nature would be to subtract from its authority. The occult corre- spondences are revised by the slippage between symbol and metaphor in the pastoral verse. Only harmony with nature allows the poet to live the symbolic as being, not representation. Yet there is an implication in the poetry that the poet fights shy of, that his enchanted symbolic world cannot live on the principle of unity alone. The symbolic after all is nothing if not an exchange value; the making of meaning depends on 35 S. K. Heninger, Touches of Sweet Harmony: Pythagorean Cosmology and Renaissance Poetics (Sail Marino 1974) p. 338. 36 It is useful to quote Vickers's criticism of Heninger's use of the word metaphor, in a discussion of Renaissance hermeticism. Pointing out that Heninger uses the words metaphor and symbol arbitrarily in his discussion of the book of nature, Vickers writes that correspondences 'are not perceived by the imagination but by the rational mind, and must be assented to - otherwise the whole system risks being abandoned. . . . whereas metaphors and models, in indicating similarities, also insist on differences . . . correspondences assert similarity or identity and are not interested in differences . . . metaphors allow for development, correction, and refinement in a reciprocal relationship with the reality that they illuminate; correspondences are made once and for all, by a kind of collective fiat of the occult tradition'.

The dual status of figure is marked in such lines as these, in 'Upon Appleton House', Out of these scatter'd sibyl's leaves Strange prophecies my fancy weaves: (11. 577-8) There is a vein of Whitmanesque contradiction in the offer to literalise the book of nature in 'leaves', in the simultaneous desire to pun and yet retain the mythos of an underlying identity, wanting his meanings to be ¿illusive and yet pure. The admission that the meanings of the garden are human and not magical, Edenic, or divine cannot be made. Alongside whatever profundity of meaning we attribute to the poetry, the poet/ persona himself is engaged in a flight from the awareness of metaphor or subjective discursivity, manifesting nostalgia for a lost wholeness of being, or ontolgie , in Raymond Queneau's neologism. IV Turning to 'The Garden' for a close reading of some of its stanzas, one way of tracing the patterns discussed above while doing justice to the text is by consideration of the poetic voice. 'The Garden' wears its argument lightly, but the tone is hard to define, passing from the ingenious to the ingenuous. There are shifts between quizzical irony and imaginative rapport, and again to a more contemplative detachment. As John Greaser writes, there is a polyphony of registers in the poem, between light conceit (stanzas 1,2, and 8) and a more contemplative voice, as in the sixth and seventh stanzas, though this concept of a range of voices also holds true even in the interpretation of single phrases and words.37 To some extent, the poem's conceits and allusions are witticisms that belong to the speaking poet, expressions of his own cultured sophisti- cation. There is no clear line to be drawn though between puns seemingly 'authorised' by the poetic persona and a naive use of language. The first stanza argues against conceit, but is itself one. Other phrases seem casually opaque. The declaration, 'Two Paradises 'twere in one | To live in Paradise alone' could be the poet's ideal, the expression of a mood, a witticism, or form of self-parody; why is the poet wishing for a solitude that he already enjoys? When we read the poet's apostrophe to innocence 37 John Creaser, 'Marvell and Existential Liberty', in Warren Chernaik and Martin Dzelzainis (eds.), Marvell and Liberty (London 1999) pp. 145-72: 167.</page><page sequence="16">MARVELL'S LITERAL FIGURES 239 and quiet, ťYour sacred plants, if here below, | Only among the plaints will grow', we could suppose that this is just a good, old-fashioned play on words, one that adapts the hermetic principle of similitude between that which is above and that which is below Still, by inclining for the principle of identity, the poet has reversed the priority of the natural and spiritual orders, making the plant-forms of nature the originals. The puzzle here is similar to that of the pilgrims in Bermudas', who sing He hangs in shades the orange bright, like golden lamps in a green night . . . (11. 17-18) These lines recall God's placing of lights in the sky for 'signs and seasons' (Genesis 1: 14), while our expectations are reversed by the figure - it is as if the pilgrims saw oranges and were reminded of stars (why should oranges be thought of as being visible in the dark?). Since these pilgrims are still in the middle of the ocean, navigating by the stars on the way to the Bermudas, the opposite is of course true, leaving us to wonder how literal or self-conscious their hymn might be, and whether they are navi- gating well. Once again, Marvell reminds us of metaphor as a temporal mode (set off against the pastoral-synchronic). Such ironies lead Robin Grove to remark on 'Bermudas' that 'this is not Paradise Regained, so much as Paradise Withheld'.38 'The Garden' abounds in 'double-voiced words' as Bakhtin has it, words that belong in different ways to the speaking persona and the writer,39 though just how they do, or don't, belong to either is very much the rub.40 The Marvellian use of doubleness, or creative misprision in the speech of a naive persona, allows for the sense in which language speaks through the speaker, as we employ more senses in language than we are always aware. Marvell's figures are ambiguous not so much because they veil cryptic meanings, but because the speaker himself takes a simple view of some- thing we cannot help seeing as double; it is ingenuousness, not elision, that creates the effect of irony. The use of literalism leaves the reader searching 38 Robin Grove, 'Marvell's Bermudas', Critical Review, 42 (2002) pp. 72 -84: 79. See Mikhail Bakhtin, Problems of Dostoievsky's Poetics, trans. R.

A signal instance of the contest between authorised and unwitting meanings occurs in the poet's semi-comic tumble in stanza 5 (itself unintentional): Stumbling on melons, as I pass, Insnar'd with flow'rs, I fall on grass. (11. 39-40) The reminder of the biblical Fall in his own language appears to have escaped the poet, while in the pastoral context we cannot fail to pick it up, making this a sort of prelapsarian lapsus on the poet's part. The lines may also point us back to the prophet Isaiah, for whom 'all flesh is grass', as some critics have argued, at the risk of reading too much of 'Damon the Mower' into 'The Garden'.41 In any case the logic here appears to be that of association rather than allegory, much as in 'Upon Appleton House' the poet cannot see the mowers at work in the meadow without recalling the violence of war, hence they 'massacre the grass along'. In the longer poem, the poet's mentili images are con- strained by occasion and memory, milking the speaker less of a free subject than he might think in his passive associations. By a sort of osmosis of the imagination, the harvest in 'Upon Appleton House' becomes a scene of war, while the memory of war is recollected in the massacre of the grass. Likewise, the 'green sea' of grass through which the mowers go is alternately 'green' in fact and 'red' by association with the crossing of the Red Sea, as well as with contemporary vio- lence.42 In place of an allegorical or typological 'higher term' where we would expect it, Marvell explores what Roger White calls the 41 By contrast, Rosalie Colie is a critic who rejects the implication of mortality in the last two lines of stanza 5 (Colie, My Ecchoing Song , p. 162). Smith notes the reference to the book of Job in this stanza: 'The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way' ( The Poems of Andrew Marvell, ed. Smith, p. 156). Interestingly in this connection, Hill sees a comparable ambivalence at work in the practice of typology in the first half of the 17th century. Tart of the object of typology, whether conscious or not, was to minimize the savagery of the Old Testament: Samson was transformed from a bloodthirsty bully to a type of Christ.'

The colours green and red, Mower and Israelite, the innocuous and biblical Fall become oddly interchangeable figures. At such points, the hierarchies of meaning we associate with allegory are replaced by a polyphony of registers; perspective is replaced by an artful 'loss' of perspective. In 'The Garden', the garden's status as a microcosmic omnium gatherum requires that a 'higher' meaning, that of the Fall, intrude in the last line of stanza 5, though this can only be recollected in softened and disguised form. The strict meaning of the Fall is rendered innocent by the context; while the green world of pure meanings has been disturbed, echoes remain where the poet hears only single senses. The poem's rhetoric of symbolic presence is tested by the (likely) allusion to death or absence, and the comic fall marks a point of rupture in the poem (stanza 6). Death is also signified in the seventh stanza in the figure of the bird, as an allegory of the soul waiting for its 'longer flight', making this second figure an answer of sorts to the implicit fragility and disturb- ance of the poet's reverie at the close of the fifth stanza. A world of magical presences in the garden suspends absence, the condition of desire and loss. Sex is consequently not present in the garden, the poet affirming that, far from suffering any loss of human potential in its exclusion, the green world is sufficiently 'am'rous' to substitute for what has been lost or, rather, precludes the idea of loss itself in love. The pun that 'Two Paradises 'twere in one | To live in Paradise alone' is an instance of a recurrent idea in Marvell, that of the condition of sufficiency which still admits a surplus - as if an ideal state could be more like itself. Bent on identification with nature, the poet would have us believe that nature is an end in itself, excluding sexual pleasure from the catalogue of true delights and procreation from the worthy drives of humanity. Thus, the speaker approves of the ending of the 'race' of Apollo and Pan in the fourth stanza, in the metamorphosis of the nymphs into a reed and tree, punning on race as 'descendants' of the gods as well as their 'contest'. 43 Arguing against the definition of metaphor in the terms of tenor and vehicle proposed by I. A. Richards, White writes, 'Undetermination . . . would involve the idea that the same sentence could be used to express two different metaphors , even though all the words in the sentence are taken in precisely the same sense. If this can be so, which metaphor is being expressed on a particular occasion may depend on considerations other than the mere reflection on words and their meanings.'

The stanza also provides a curious antithesis to the Edenic myth, since Adam and Eve's tale exists to explain whose descendants we are. How much, or what type of, value can we attribute to the poeťs re-reading of romantic pastoral in favour of a purely exclusive love of nature? The poet is orthodox enough in evoking those Christian and Neoplatonic traditions for which the division of the sexes constituted a form of fall from the first state of unity.44 There is too the added comfort of the widespread belief of the period that plants repro- duced asexually.45 There is nothing spiritual, though, in the strictly reli- gious sense about the poeťs form of delight in the garden. The tone is not quite the same, but only a shade away from that of the boastful poet in Fairfax's wood: How safe, methinks, and strong, behind These trees have I encamped my mind; Where beauty, aiming at the heart, Bends in some trees its useless dart; And where the world no certain shot Can make, or me it toucheth not. (11. 601-6) The poeťs promise ťThat I may never leave this place' in the following stanza of 'Upon Appleton House' is soon and easily undone, revealing a commitment hardly more credible than that of flighty lovers. His chastity is not much of a virtue, since virtue involves self-overcoming; it is rather a high-toned form of indolence, as if to say what hasn't been tried can't be missed. Ostensibly, for the speaker of 'The Garden', chastity is the corollary of purity of meaning, and the attraction of the garden is partly that of a lost simplicity or totality of identity associated with childhood pre-sexuality, as well as an atavistic recall to the childhood of the human species in Eden. 44 See e.g. Edgar Wind, Pagan Mysteries in the Renaissance (Bungay 1967) pp. 212 - 14, and Rostvig. The Happy Man. pp. 162-3, 168-9. 45 On the supposed celibacy of plants, see Harrison, The Bible, , Protestantism, and the Rise of Natural Science , p. 238. Admittedly, Harrison points out that an exception was made for the palm, and ťThe Mower against Gardens' makes a further exception for the cherry.</page><page sequence="20">MARVELL'S LITERAL FIGURES 243 (The regressive quality of pastoral is marked in a different way in poems such as 'A Dialogue between Thyrsis and Dorinda', 'The Mower's Song', and ťThe Nymph Complaining for the Death of her Fawn', where pastoral becomes the scene of anticipated suicide, offering pastoral as a pattern of another, more ultimate, form of 'escape' from life's commitments.) In the poet's declarations on love the tradition of the paradoxical enco- mium meets that of pastoral folly, in a blithe memory of the lover's furore. As with the pastoral madness of Don Quixote, we are left to wonder at a character who plays at being what he really is (mad, in the first case, eccentric in his preferences in the second, though in both cases conven- tion is mocked and oddly reaffirmed). That there is a higher sense than reason in the paradoxes of the imaginative life is surely something of the 'truth' that the poet presents us with. It would be exaggerated though to say, as does Eugene Gunnar, that in 'The Garden' Marvell takes 'nature as the model for human love'.46 Concentrating on the claim, 'No name shall but your own be found', Cunnar argues that the poet's arboreal ideal, exalting the literal against the figurative and the natural against the trope, 'mocks the Petrarchan notion that loving the woman's image is better than loving the woman herself'.47 The argument that 'The Garden' re-reads the conventions of Petrarchan love, and its Neoplatonic reformulation, is a convincing one. Still, this hardly obliges us to take Marvell's formulation of nature as a preferable alternative. Rather, this argument leads us to wonder if the poet's claim to speak of nature without borrowing tropes from it holds good. When we read No white nor red was ever seen So am'rous as this lovely green. (11. 17-18) we recognise red and white as figures for the roses and lilies of love poetry, making 'green' a shorthand not merely for the poet's own experi- ence but for the pastoral genre, converting the authentically lived back into the figurai. Nature is only apparently a more tangible ideal than the beloved of courtly poetry. We are dispensed from considering the poet's reflections on sexuality and nature as preceptúa! truths or aphorisms, as 46 Eugene Gunnar, 'Names on Trees, the Hermaphrodite, and "The Garden'", in Claude J. Summers and Ted-Larry Pebworth (eds.), On the Celebrated and Neglected Poems of Andrew Marvell (London 1992) pp. 121-38: 138. Ibid., p. 134.</page><page sequence="21">244 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY they are already relativised, true only to this particular experience of the garden. The speaker's personal relationship to the symbols of the garden can be understood as a form of tact, in Theodor Adorno 's sense, in the co-presence of universalising conventions and personal response, the poet employing forms of expression that, having lost their prior status as truths, disguise subjectivity or nominalism in their formal impersonality.48 Cunnar makes an interesting contrast between Marvell's literalism and Petrarch's play on the similarity of the name of Laura and the laurels of poetry in which he raises a monument to her absence, transforming fru- strated amorous desire into poetic achievement.49 This is indeed just the type of pun Marvell's poet/persona does not wish to make - what amounts to an admission of the compensatory role of pastoral for a desire or pleasure that cannot be fulfilled in the surroundings of nature. Any allowance that pastoral provides the substitute or fiction rather than the originell type of human desire goes against the argument that Marvell pro- poses in 'The Garden' that there is a state of plenitude in which man knows no division between self and world; the meaning of loss and the transformation of frustrated desire into poetry must remain unstated. Marvell plays upon the transformation of sexual desire into creativity and contentment in his version of Pan and Apollo's pursuit of the nymphs, who, to evade their pursuers, metamorphose into a laurel and a reed, figures of the arts that the gods then take up as their own. Apollo hunted Daphne so, Only that she might laurel grow; And Pan did after Syrinx speed, Not as a nymph, but for a reed. (11. 29-32) In these lines the poet offers us a sort of secular felix culpa of the origin of the arts of poetry and music. 'Desire is only to be quieted in the presence of Art', is the comment of Bradbrook and Thomas on these lines, a judge- ment which raises the question of whether art or nature is the real subject here.50 There is, once more, a tension between a figurative and a literal sense in these lines. The laurel and reed are figures of the arts (figures of 48 Theodor Adorno, Minima Moralia : Reflections from Damaged life (London 1974) p. 16.

Besides, how can we reconcile an approval of the discovery of the arts with the poet's banishing of the laurels of poetry as vain signifiers in the first stanza? The founding of the arts of poetry and music cannot be celebrated without a contradic- tion. The ambiguity between literal and multiple senses is implicit again in the word 'Only', which could mean 'merely' or 'simply' (Apollo's desire was frustrated in the transformation of Daphne into a tree), or 'solely' (the god's true desire was fulfilled in this transformation). Nature passes smoothly and without regret into culture in the poet's account, and the gods are contented with the substitution, though we only have the poet's word for it. The poet is after all imposing an allegorical form on a series of events, taking the consecutive for the consequential, destiny effa- cing contingency. The role of sublimation in creativity, the realisation in artistic form of energies that have been denied their primary object, escapes the speaker even as he evokes them. The poet's own account of the relationship between desire and inspiration might be given a reverse interpretation, since the nymphs, before they were forgotten, were necess- ary for the transformation of desire into art, as in Nietzschean fashion the creation of all higher culture is conditioned by sexuality. In this reading culture (art or spirit) does not escape the conditioning of nature, or, rather, culture is rendered metaphorical in another sense as we perceive it to be a masking and transformation of desire. For some critics 'The Garden' offers us the truth of the poet's imaginative activity, as Donald Friedman takes the garden to be a symbol of wisdom, a place where the poet makes it clear that 'the mind and the soul . . . attain their highest and happiest states when contemplating the creations of their own mind'.51 This is a just reflection of the poet's state of delight, but, as if taking Marvell for his persona, Friedman begs the question, is the poet aware that his garden symbols are the creations of his own mind? The sub- jectivity of the imagination at work behind the garden's symbols is explored directly in the sixth stanza, where the poet renegotiates the threatened parity between self and world. After the poet's fall which closes the fifth stanza, for a moment the sufficiency of the garden appears disturbed: Mean while the mind, from pleasure less, Withdraws into its happiness: (11. 41-2) 51 Friedman, Marvell's Pastoral Art, p. 160.</page><page sequence="23">246 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY The gesture of pastoral retreat from the world is re-enacted, this time in passing from the garden into the mind, in the attempt to recover a status of being that is not betrayed by representation. 'Mean while', and the passage from pleasure to the synonymous state of happiness, offer continu- ity and compensation, smoothing over the sense of rupture in Tall'. In the mind the world's figures are rediscovered: The mind, that ocean where each kind Does straight its own resemblance find; (11. 43-4) Adapting the commonplace derived from Pliny, that the animals of the earth have their equivalent in the creatures of the sea, the poet takes the reproduction of nature's figures in the mind as sustaining the pattern of symbolic equivalency. Once more, it is not the significance of any of these figures that grants him assurance so much as their status as symbols. The potential of the mind, however, suggested by the vastness and force of 'ocean', goes beyond the task of mirroring the given world, an inevitably unfaithful one at any rate. Now vocational in his inspiration, the poet con- jures up things that lie outside the realm of his perception: Yet it creates, transcending these, Far other worlds, and other seas; (11. 45-6) Here the poet discovers the imagination, in the fantasy of multiple worlds. 'Yet' is the apprehension of another stage in the poet's drama of thought, in which the mind asserts its autonomy, creating what it contemplates. Still, for this poet the discovery of the mind's activity, breaking with pas- toral passivity/ objectivity in the creation of meaning, can only be a mixed blessing. What is also figurative is at the same time merely figurative; speculation is the stuff of contingency, the re-creation of the world in the mind is a symptom of the loss of the original. After the audaciousness of creation, the poet returns to nature's order, reconstituted in a yet more refined and exclusive form. Marvell's garden ecstasy repels definition: Annihilating all that's made To a green thought in a green shade. (11. 47-8)</page><page sequence="24">MARVELL'S LITERAL FIGURES 247 Figure is effaced from the mind via colour, green, as the condition of pure thought. Even here, the paradox of the poet's desire for a purity of meaning that is also symbolic manifests itself in the overlapping or dou- bling of green. The poet's mysterious 'green thought' includes all that threatened to undermine its wholeness by remaining outside it. These lines are poised between the renunciation of figure and an ultimate condition of being metaphorical - in standing for something else, in this case, for creation, 'all that's made'. As a totality, the sum of 'all that's made', 'green' in the poet's thought allows for no slippage of meaning towards another state of nature of which this is the mere copy. The poet takes the irony behind his symbolic order, that any reproduction or representation is the exclusion of the original, to an extreme point where his 'green thought' both figures and forgets the world. The ambivalence is at work in the poet's language, as William Empson comments, annihilation 'to' being a redundancy - the Latin root, ad nihil , makes this phrase signify 'to nothing to'.52 Besides, as Empson adds, annihilation 'to' something is not negation; instead the phrase provides us with something like 'reduce to a nothing which is still a something'. The annihilation and re-creation of imaginary worlds, the play of absence and presence in green, recalls Mallarmé 's 'Néant', the attempt to think an ultimate nothingness which is evoked by a blank page for the symbolist poet, here by 'green'. Instead of an allegorical garden, the poet has provided us with a sym- bolist one where the symbol is, in Colie 's words, a 'coincidence only pos- sible in thought'.53 In a self-cancelling logic, figure aspires to a purity of meaning which it cannot possess, as in much of the poetry of Mallarmé; figure in language or thought is bound to be connotative, hence impure. As with that of the French poet, Marvell's verse dramatises the quality of perception, we participate in the activities of the speaker's mind 'in the time it takes to read the poem', as Kenneth Friedenreich has it.54 Much as in a symbolist poem, contraries are entertained within the selfsame figure, only in Marvell the two senses that operate within the same term frequently are the literal and the figurative. The second or supposedly higher meaning is typically unstated, lying perdu on the threshold of the poet's awareness. Thus, in the seventh stanza, there is a disjunction between the available interpretation of the bird as a model Platonic allegory of the soul and the 52 William Empson, Some Versions of Pastoral (New York 1974) p. 99.

In this stanza the poet has shaken off some of his enthusiasm and accepts with a tone of willing detachment the wondrous workings of the garden, as we read: Casting the body's vest aside My soul into the boughs does glide: There like a bird it sits and sings, Then whets, and combs its silver wings, And, till prepared for longer flight, Waves in its plumes the various light. (11. 51-6) The poet has renounced self-identity it seems, but has also in some way exchanged it for identity with another figure of nature, the bird, on which he fixes his fascinated attention before its 'longer flight'. This ascension comes to look like anticlimax, Geoffrey Hartman points out, as ťthe poet slips his body off, and his soul flies up, not beyond the garden but into the boughs'.55 In turn, the preening bird itself is not intent on its departure (it doesn't know perhaps how to behave according to type), but on the delights of the garden and its own beauty. Robert Wilcher also under- scores this surprising lack of spirituality in the figure, remarking that the bird, in its 'self-absorption and self-satisfaction ... is happy to wave "in its plumes the various light," simultaneously reflecting the beauty of Nature and showing off its own'.56 The light is not 'clear' or white like that of the dewdrop in 'On a Drop of Dew', but 'various' in reflection, while we understand that it is the plumes rather than the light that are so, hence this is another imaginative literalisation (recalling the halcyon in 'Upon Appleton House', in the description of the darkening air that 'sucks her azure dye'). Once more the symbol is such by virtue of a self- contradiction, an incorporation of simple and double meanings. The understanding of the poet, Colie's Simplicissimus, remains on that first level while basking in the reflected light of some higher realm he has not openly admitted to his understanding, but which is available for us as readers. The same can be said for the lines in 'Upon Appleton House' in 55 Hartman, Beyond Formalism , p. 152.

Marvellian nature hates emptiness, and so the poet resists the implication that the figure is a vehicle for other meanings. Instead the soul becomes a bird or tree, much as in the last stanza of 'The Garden' time becomes 'thyme5 and the deity, apparently, becomes a gardener. Marvellian literalisation of figure goes against a traditional function of reli- gious metaphor in startling us into new forms of awareness, metaphor that surprises us through an estrangement in language which breaks down our conventional modes of perception - Vaughan's 'deep, but dazzling darkness' in The Night , for instance.57 While a problem of religious meta- phor whose aim is to surprise us with a disruption of speech genres is that it risks itself declining into the generic, the textbook ornament, Marvell might be said to make it new by filtering startling figures through the mind of a naive interpreter, for whom they resemble self-evident truths or commonplaces. V By way of conclusion, I would like to suggest the theological aptness of Marvell's use of literalism. If literalism is a sign of fallen vision in the pas- toral verse, then it would follow that it is inescapable. As is often remarked, a paradigmatic irony of the pastoral verse is that the speaker may have mistaken the 'map' of Paradise for the thing itself, the figure for the thing figured. Yet there is a sense in which such a mismatch is inevita- ble, after all, if a worldly garden has to stand in for an otherworldly Paradise. When it comes to the things of the next world, we are not required to think of God as a gardener any more than we suppose him to resemble Michelangelo's grey-bearded patriarch; but the poetry works to remind us that we are limited by what we imagine, by figure as a con- dition of thought. 57 The Works of Henry Vaughan , ed.

Martin (Oxford 1957) p. 522.</page><page sequence="27">250 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY This is to return to the topic of seeing 'through a glass darkly', and negative theology, the radical difference of figurative representation to the spiritual signified. There is the notable instance of Thyrsis' account of the hereafter in 'A Dialogue between Thyrsis and Dorinda', There's no wolf, no fox, nor bear. No need of dog to fetch our stray . . . There, sheep are full Of sweetest grass, and softest wool (11. 21-32) No doubt these are 'somewhat comic misconceptions of religious truth' in Barbara Kiefer Lewalski's words,58 but then again, who is to say? The irony here goes beyond the portrayal of character, as pastoral 'provincial- ity' of vision renders the difficulty of speaking of the supernatural in terms of the natural. Imaginative efforts in such directions are bound to fall short. The attempt to comprehend what may be beyond figure or speech is also implied in Dorinda's own 'silent thinking'. The pattern recurs in a variety of forms: when the Mower discovers death, he conceives it in his own likeness, repeating the pattern of projection of the familiar world onto the unfamiliar.59 Brought to the point of naming the absent, Damon reclothes absence in another guise, a process which can be readily taken as a sign of the speaker's egocentricism.60 The point is taken, but there is a sense in which the speaker has litde choice about the matter. 'Damon the Mower' belies the Mower's autochthonous fantasy of belonging to his green fields, even as it is clear that his thoughts cannot transcend the familiar. The awareness of difference is both radical and inevitably mediated. 'The Mower against Gardens' provides another instance of the conun- drum. As is often noted, the Mower's ideal of pure nature is troped by his own language. At the same time, the speaker's figures are drawn from his provincial plot. In order to speak of the world of culture, the Mower has no 58 Barbara Kiefer Lewalski, 'Marvell as a Religious Poet', in G. A. Patrides (ed.), Approaches to Marvell (London 1978) pp. 251-79: 271. In this respect the end of the poem is far from allegorical, as Friedman criticises it for being: 'The only note of excess is in the last line, because Marvell forces the identification of death and the mower into a much broader meaning than it should be made to hold in this poem' (Friedman, MarvelVs Pastoral Art , p. 138). 60 See Haber, Pastoral and the Poetics of Self-Contradiction, pp. 121-2.

His misapprehension reveals the limits of thought projected onto an unlike world, resulting in an all too human irony. If the category of the metaphorical can swallow up the literal, it is also true, as Christopher Ricks for one has pointed out, that we might as well say the literal comes to absorb the metaphorical.62 In Marvellian terms, as the natural is revealed to be figurai ťat root', so figure remains confined within the bounds of nature, in a double deconstruction. In such ways the poetry manifests Marvell's own vein of fideistic scepticism with regard to knowledge of the divine.63 Anthropomorphism of some kind would seem hard to escape, far from being a mark of the poet's enthusiastic parentheses. The closing lines of 'Upon Appleton House', among other instances, reveal that the projection of figure is a characteristic of thought. In one of Marvell's most famously stretched comparisons, the darkening 'hemisphere' reminds him of the figures of the salmon fishers, in a self-consciously anthropo- morphic rendering of the heavens. This awareness of the way in which thought is conditioned by context (the green world as creation) is likewise present in 'The Garden', however the accent is put. As Bradbrook and Thomas write of the sixth stanza, 'there must be a green shade, otherwise no green thought: that is, (the poet) only achieves the power of complete detach- ment through the instrumentality of that particular time and place'.64 In this regard, the poetry's pastoral myth of identity reveals a truth of perception. This is one way of viewing the mixture of imaginative fusion and false consciousness in the poet's fantasy of harmony with nature. Such fusion takes place in the twilight of 'Upon Appleton House' in the figure of the flooding river: And its yet muddy back doth lick, Till as a crystal mirror slick; Where all things gaze themselves, and doubt 61 Much as in Borges's short story, 'Aferroes' Research', the gulf between cultures provides the analogy for negative theology.

And for his shade which therein shines, Narcissus-like, the sun too pines. (11. 635-40) Above and below meet in a moment of trance; gazing upon the river, nature and the poet forget themselves, talking themselves to be the 'orig- inals' of the reflection. While the poet's imagination leads him outside himself, it takes him no further than identification with the scene before him, another instance of the one step forward, two steps back irony or missing Rumination' of Marvellian nature. The sun - symbol of philoso- phical wisdom - pines like Narcissus for its shade, enacting a gnostic fall into the material realm.65 Yet the poetry belies easy use of the categories of authentic and inauthentic, offering us instead a paradigm of imagi- nation and perception. To say that the world mirrors the mind is to suppose that there is a preordained harmony between the two, but to say that the mind mirrors the world is to describe the ineluctable quality of perception. To think after all ¿y to mirror the world in the mind, as in speculation or reflection. Mirroring is another reversible figure, capable of construing opposite meanings. Whether the mirror is a symbol of self- identity or difference is a question of which side we want our bread but- tered. The poetry explores indirectly through fable and imagination the intentional nature of consciousness, that is, thought directed towards the unlike, the object outside itself, conditioned by time - another way in which Marvell reveals his modernity.66 65 Both Rostvig and Brooks-Davies have suggested a hermetic allegory in this stanza; see Rostvig, The Happy Man, pp. 187-8; Brooks-Davies, The Mercuriali Monarch , pp. 167-8. Again, the understanding of figure as limited by nature in the attempt to surpass it could be compared with Mallarmé. 'Les Noces d'Hérodiade' offers a useful comparison, since the poem, like Marvell's, has human figures representing its debate. In this poem the roles of nature and art, literal speech and self-conscious figure, are those of the Nurse and the hymeneal Princess. Hérodiade's distinction is to be aware of her own merely figurative status, as a type of beauty, an ideal which, like death, exists as an absence in the world - 'un baiser me tûrait ļ Si la beauté n'était la mort'. The mirror in this poem does not stand for the closed reflexivity of art, but the nature of thought condemned to reproduce the world, rather than transcend it. Like the garden poet, Hérodiade endeavours to pass beyond the mind where 'each kind | Does straight its own resemblance find'. Hartman's description of the nymph in 'The Nymph Complaining for the Death of her Fawn' suits Hérodiade: the nymph does not 'fall into duality, but abandons the whole (this impossible world) for another whole (the world beyond)'. Hartman, Beyond formalism, p. 176.</page></plain_text>
