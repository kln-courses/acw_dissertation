Dearborn, Ml ABSTRACT This paper reviews the basic features of three occupant simulation models - MVMA2D, CAL3Df and MADYMO - currently used in the auto- motive and the aircraft industries. Historical reviews of the three models are also made. An attempt to identify various studies using the above models in the literature has been made to show the usefulness of the above. IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN INSIGHTS into the behaviors of complex biodynamical systems , mathematical models have become useful tools since they are based on the laws of motion and do not possess the uncertainties of test-to-test variability. This paper gives an overview of three mathematical models that can be described as "Gross-motion Simulators". They describe the dynamic response of human body analogs to a variety of impact environments. A review of several "Gross-motion Simula- tors" was made by King and Chou (1)* in 1975. Two of the models reviewed - CAL3D and the MVMA2D - have gone through nine more years of extensive use and development , and a third model - the MADYMO (2D and 3D) - has been developed by TNO in Holland. Since the first two models and their derivatives have gained acceptance in the automotive and aircraft industries, and the third appears very useful, this paper con- centrates on reviewing the capabilities of the three. GENERAL DESCRIPTION All the above models can describe planar motion of the human body analog, e.g. anthropo- morphic dummies or cadavers. The CAL3D model * Numbers in parentheses designate References at the end of the paper. (also known as the CVS model) has the capability of describing notion in three dimensions. One version of the MADYMO model has three dimen- sional capabilities but is currently going through further development. In the MVMA2D model, the (human) body is described by eight rigid and two flexible segments. In both the CAL3D and the MADYMO, the (human) body can be described by any number of rigid segments and joints, although fifteen segments are suggested for describing an anthropomorphic dummy in three dimensional motions. In all the models the linkage systems cannot have closed loops, i.e. no closed paths can be found which leave a segment via a joint and return to the same segment through another joint. Such systems are also known as "tree structures" (Figure 1). The equations of motion of such a collection of rigid bodies are derived using the Lagrangian or the Newtonian approach. CHAINED STRUCTURES Tree structure System with closed chain Figure 1 - Kinematic chains The shapes of the rigid body links are described by ellipses in the MVMA2D model, by ellipses or hyper ellipses in the MADYM02D (two dimensional) version and by ellipsoids in the 4.146 0096-736X/85/9304-0146$02 . 50 Copyright 1985 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">CAL3D and the MADYMQ3D (three-dimensional) ver- sion. Hyperellipsoids can also be used in the MADYM03D. In all models the relative rotation between links are resisted by non-linear tor- sional springs, dampers and Coulomb frictions. The human body linkage system interacts with the environment through contact planes that develop resistive forces on the segments in con- tact. Additionally, restraint systems, e.g. belts or air bags, develop resistive forces on the body segments. In all the models, the ellipses or ellipsoids are used to sense con- tacts. The amount and rate of penetration of the ellipse or ellipsoid into a plane are used to develop non-linear spring forces, viscous damping (in MADYMO only) and frictional forces on the link in contact. The resulting equations of motion are solved numerically using Ruge-Kutta techniques in the MVMA2D and the MADYMO models, and by a vector exponential integrator in the CAL3D model. SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODELLING RIGID BODY ROTATIONS IN THREE-DIMENSIONS : Due to the non-commutative nature of rotations in three-dimensions (i.e. the necessity to account for rotations about three axes in an estab- lished order), and the fact that, in general, the angular velocity of a rigid body cannot be represented as the time derivative of another vector, the selection of generalized coordinates for three-dimensional motion is important. They are important because the joint torque models and the integration strategy of the equations of motion are affected by the generalized coor- dinates selected in the formulation of the model. The angular orientation of a rigid body in a base coordinate system can be specified by the angular orientation of a "body fixed coordinate system" relative to the base. This can be done by specifying the "direction cosine matrix" con- taining nine elements. These nine elements can be used as generalized coordinates. However, six constraint equations between the nine ele- ments exist, making it inconvenient for prac- tical use. Euler angles and Bryant angles are often used as three coordinates without con- straint equations. Euler angles are described in most textbooks on Dynamics. Bryant angles are similar to Euler angles except for the order of rotations and are also known as Cardan angles. A description of the Bryant angles can be found in a book by Wittenburg (2). The MADYMO three-dimensional formulation uses Bryant angles as the generalized coordinates for rotation. For both the Euler and the Bryant angles, transformation matrices exist to recover the "direction cosine matrix". Both systems, how- ever, have singularities for some values of the angles, leading to numerical difficulties. A generalized coordinate system exists, con- sisting of four coordinates with one constraint equation not containing critical cases similar to those in the three coordinate systems. This system is known as the "Euler Parameters" and is also referred to as normalized quaternions. A description of this system can be found in reference (2), and also in (3). The CAL3D uses this system for integrating the three-dimen- sional rotational equations. Readers interested in the relationship between angular velocity of a rigid body and the generalized coordinates describing the angular orientation of the body, are referred to Chapter 2 of reference (2). The following sections in this paper describe the various features of the three models mentioned above and their various uses reported in the literature. No attempt to select the best of the three is made. It is believed that all the models discussed can simulate a variety of impact conditions depend- ing on the experience of the modeller. In fact, even though they were developed for vehicle occupant or pedestrian simulations, they can be used to simulate the dynamics of many other systems of rigid bodies. MVMA2D HISTORICAL REVIEW - The origins of the MVMA2D crash victim simulation model can be traced to a model developed at the Cornell Aeronautical Labs by McHenry and Naab ( 4 ) in 1966. Further improvements in the model were carried out under AMA sponsorship and the resulting model was released by Segal (5) and was called ROS (Revised Occupant Simulation Model). Improvements to the ROS were made at G.M. by Danforth and Randal (6), and the new model was named MODROS. MODROS was released to the MVMA in 1972. Further developments to the MODROS were undertaken at the HSRI by Robbins, Bennett and Bowman. Between 1972 and 1974, three versions of the MVMA2D model were developed. Version 3 was first reported in 1974 (7). Since 1974 various additions and debugging have been carried out at G.M. and HSRI, the most notable being in the advanced belt simulation algorithm. Attempts at the development of an advanced air bag algorithm and a driver air bag system incorporating an air bag and an energy-absorbing steering column have been made. These algorithms are currently inoperable and future efforts to enhance the model may be in completing the above algorithms. ANALYTICAL FORMULATION - The linkage system used to describe a crash victim is shown in Figure 2. As can be seen, there are ten segments and nine masses. The mass of the neck is lumped partially in the head and partially in the upper torso. The neck is modelled by an extensible link with two articulations - one at the head/neck junction and the other at the upper torso/neck junction. The shoulder is also modelled by an extensible element. These 4.147</page><page sequence="3">4.148 p. PRASAD two features of the MVMA2D formulation of the crash victim are unique when compared with other crash victim simulators. ยง f I $ M3 M4' V - ' M6ร Figure 2 - MVMA2D occupant simulation linkage system The equations of motion of the linkage system are derived using the Lagrangian tech- nique explicitly as opposed to other models, like the MADYMO or the CAL3D, in which they are generated automatically. CURRENT FEATURES - Joints: There are eight hinged joints used in the model. Torques generated in the joints are of the elastic, viscous damping, coulomb friction types and a nonlinear and nonlinear energy-dissipating type for the joint stop. Figure 3 shows a general representation of the linear and nonli- near joint torque. A unique feature of this model is its attempt to simulate biodynamic muscle tension into the joints. Use of the muscle tension model has been demonstrated by Schneider and Bowman (8) in a study of the dynamic response of the head and neck of volun- teers subjected to -G^ acceleration, and by Bowman et al. (9) in a study of lateral head and neck response of human volunteers. Contact Model: Occupant interaction with vehicle interior surfaces is sensed by ellipses fixed to body links. The contact ellipses can be arbitrary in number and dimensions, and can be deformable or rigid. The reaction forces on the occupant linkage system are generated as a function of the penetration of these ellipses into vehicle contact planes, e.g. seat, instru- ment panel, windshield, etc. Additionally, ellipses can contact other ellipses, e.g. head into chest or knees, etc. In order to save computer time, ellipse-ellipse or ellipse-plane contacts can be inhibited.

Inertia spikes to account for rate effects can also be simulated. Hysterisis of the contact surfaces or ellipses are described by R and G factors shown in Figure 4. By specifying the location of the contact planes as a function of time, intrusion can be simulated, e.g. dash intrusion into the occupant compartment .

Since most automotive belt systems are three-dimensional in nature, the usefulness of this system is limited. Advanced Belt Restraint System: This system allows for a more realistic simulation of the belt system in today's vehicles. It</page><page sequence="4">OCCUPANT SIMULATION MODELS 4.149 consists of up to seven belt segments acting independently or in pairs. Friction between the upper torso , the pelvis and the belt system can be simulated. Inertia reels at three of the four anchor locations can be simulated. Figure 5 shows a side view of a five-segment advanced belt system. The three dimensional aspect of the belt system is simulated by spe- cif iying lateral dimensions as shown in Figure 6.

INITIAL GEOMETRY FOR 5 -SEGMENT BELT SIMULATION- SIDE VIEW Figure 5 - Advanced belt simulation - side view Air Bag: The air bag model used in the MVMA2D was developed at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory by Hammond (10). The air bag is cylindrical in shape. The mass inflow rate and temperature of the gas entering the bag are input parameters to the model along with other thermodynamic properties of the gas. Deflation membranes can be simulated. The bag attachment point in the air bag model is a fixed point in the vehicle. As a result , an air bag mounted on an energy- absorbing steering column cannot be simulated. Efforts at developing a model of a driver air bag mounted on a collapsible steering column were made by Chou et al. (11). Due to problems with the steering column model, Chou1 s model becomes unstable under general input con- ditions. The air bag model itself has been identified as having instabilities under cer- tain input conditions. initial geometry for 5 -segment BELT SIMULATION - FRONT VIEW Figure 6 - Advanced belt simulation - front view STEERING COLUMN - The steering column model incorporated in the MVMA2D was developed by Segal for the ROS model (5). This portion of the MVMA2D needs extensive debugging to become a useful tool. SPECIAL FEATURES - Although not generally used for crash victim simulation, a force can be applied directly to any point on the head. This force - both in magnitude and direction - can be time dependent. This special feature of the model was used to empirically derive the carpos i te lateral bending stiffness of the human neck for small deformations (12). OTHER APPLICATIONS - Even though the MVMA2D model was developed for simulating occu- pants of vehicles in frontal or rear impacts, with careful choice of input parameters, other crash modes can be simulated. Robbins and Becker (14) have developed baseline data for describing response of occupants in side im- pacts, and pedestrian impacts using the MVMA2D. Backaitis and Robbins (15) have also reported a study on side impact using this model. Robbins and Viano (16) have reported a simulation of</page><page sequence="5">4*150 P. PRASAD occupant response in vehicle rollover. Further application of the model include its use in vehicle accident investigation (17), head/neck response of helmeted and non-helmeted motorcyclists (18), and simulations of human fall victims striking hard or soft surfaces (19). EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION - Alem et al. (20) have reported the results of sled tests with three-point belted cadavers and their com- parisons with simulations using the MVMA2D. Considering the variations in the cadaver anthropometry and joint characteristics, the model results compared well with the test results. It was pointed out that a more general joint model is required for cadaver simulations. Ideally, tabular specification of joint torque loading curves is required. Comparison of sled test results with the Hybrid II dumny and the MVMA2D model simula- tions have been reported by Viano et al. (21). Various modifications to the advanced belt routine were made during this study to incor- porate the lateral locations of the belt anchor points. The belt loads predicted by the model agreed poorly with the test results. It was felt by the authors that a five segment belt simulation would improve the simulations. It should be noted here that since then, further improvements in the advanced belt routine have been made. USER CONVENIENCE - The model is documented in three volumes of the user manual covering the analytical formulation, card-by-card description and description of the sub-routines used in the program (22). To facilitate the learning process in using the model, a Tutorial System has been developed. It consists of a Self-Study Guide and an Audio-Visual program (12,13). The Self-Study Guide consists of text, illustrations and example problems. The Audio-Visual program includes narration text and figures on 35irm slides. An interactive program that positions the MVMA2D occupant in approximate equilibrium has been developed by Bowman (23) for General Motors. Printer plots of the occupant, vehicle interior and the restraint system are standard options in the model output. An occupant display package in use at General Motors has been reported by Danforth and Prisk (24). An interactive occupant display package has been developed at Ford Motor Company by Huang (25). MADYMO HISTORICAL REVIEW - The MADYMO Crash Victim Simulation Program package consists of a two-dimensional and a three-dimensional ver- sion. The formulation of the two packages are nearly identical and were completed in 1975 at TNO, Netherlands. Since 1975, the simulation program package has gone through considerable debugging and optimization at TNO. The first reference to the package in the literature was made by Wismans, Maltha, et. al. in 1979 (26) where model responses were conpared with sled test results using a child dummy and child cadavers. The currently available version was completed in 1983 and is referred to as Version 3. This version has been implemented at Ford Motor Company and at a few other locations in the USA and Canada. This paper reviews the program package of Version 3, relying on four volumes of documentation provided by TOO. ANALYTICAL FORMULATION - The equations of motion for multiple tree structures composed of rigid bodies connected by joints (hinge or ball-socket type) are derived using Lagrang ian methods. As a result, constraint equations of the type used in the CAL3D formulation for joints are not required. The formulation effi- ciency is evidenced by the fact that the entire two-dimensional package for an arbitrary number of rigid bodies and contacts consists of about 1800 Fortran lines. The three-dimensional package consists of approximately 2200 lines. The memory requirement depends on the number of elements and contacts used for a particular simulation. CURRENT VERSION FEATURES - There are no limitations on the number of rigid bodies for the human surrogate, its environment, i.e. the car interior or exterior, belt systems, etc. Closed chains or paths are not allowed. Pro- grammers have to use their own editing software to set some key dimensions based on the number of elements, belt systems, contacts, etc. This allows for the minimum memory requirement for any given simulation. TYPES OF JOINTS - Two types of joints are permitted. They are: 1. Hinged joints in two-dimensional version 2. Ball and socket joints in three- dimensional version Joint torques are described in tabular forms as opposed to polynomial forms in the MVMA2D and the CAL3D models. STANDARD FORCE INTERACTION MODELS - Three interactions are permitted as follows: 1. Acceleration Forces 2. Ellipsoids with planes 3. Ellipsoids with ellipsoids - only in the two-dimensional version Planes can be attached to the vehicle or the occupant ellipses. Also, ellipses can be attached to the vehicle. The contact forces can be of the non- linear spring, viscous damping, or frictional type. Note that the viscous type of contact force is not allowed in the MVMA2D or the CAL3D models. An interesting feature of this model is that penetration used to calculate contact forces is taken relative to the initial penetration, e.g. from the initial penetration of the pelvis into the seat cushion as a result of normal seat compression. This assumes a state of equilibrium of the system at the ini- tiation of the simulation. Hysterisis is simu- lated by unloading slopes as opposed to the R and G factors used in the MVMA2D and the CAL3D</page><page sequence="6">OCCUPANT SIMULATION MODELS 4.151 models. RESTRAINT SYSTEMS - Two restraint systems can be modelled. They are: 1. Simple Belts - these are basically springs. 2. Advanced Belts - more realistic belt model accounting for the spatial geometry of a belt system. Slip between belt segments is possible, e.g. as between the lap belt portion and shoulder harness portion of a three point belt system. For belt systems with a retractor, "film spool effect" can be simulated if the data is available, e.g. applied belt load versus length of belt spooled out of the retractor. EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION - Comparisons of the two-dimensional model responses with sled test results for a child dummy and cadaver in a harness type child restraint system have been reported by Wismans et al. (26). Satisfactory agreement between model and test results were obtained in terms of peak responses and shapes of the response-time histories. Side impact simulations with the Part 572 dummy and their correlations with rigid wall tests are described by Wismans et al. (27). Mathematical models of the various dummy thora- xes developed for side impact are reported by Wismans and Wittebrood (28). Pedestrian simulations using two-dimen- sional models and a fifteen segment three- dimensional model and their comparisons with two tests at 30 and 40 km/h are reported by Wijk et al. (29). The model predictions are within or close to the range of experimental responses. OTHER APPLICATIONS - The versatility of the program package is demonstrated by the design and optimization of a new concept child restraint system using the MADYMO (30). The MADYMO two-dimensional package has also been used in the design of an abdominal section for use in side impact dummies (31). USER CONVENIENCE - The user manual is written clearly with actual examples of simula- tions, making it easy for use by an inex- perienced programmer. A graphics package for the representation of three-dimensional kinema- tics is included in the latest version. CAL3D HISTORY - Around 1970, the CALSPAN Corporation of Buffalo, New York began the development of a mathematical model for simu- lating the three-dimensional response of a vehicle occupant in a crash environment. The resulting model described by Bartz (32) and Bartz et. al (33) was known variously as the CAL3D occupant simulation model or the CVS (Crash Victim Simulator) model. In this model, the occupant was described by fifteen segments with forty degrees of freedom and a contact model was developed for generating the external forces acting on the occupant. Restraint systems such as the belts and air bags were included. The early programs were known as Versions I and II of the CAL3D. Further developments at CALSPAN by Fleck et al. resulted in an Improved Three-Dimens ional Crash Victim Simulation Program known as CVS Version III (34). The earlier version of the model was generalized to an arbitrary number of segments to describe an occupant. In addition, the concept of "null joints" was introduced so that disjointed sets of segments interacting against one another could be simulated. The vehicle and the ground were designated as additional segments, thus making it easier to model pedestrian impacts. Additionally, in this version, two symmetry modes could be specified - a two-dimensional symmetry and mirror type symmetry. As a result of the improvements, Version III can be regarded as a general purpose program for simu- lating three-dimensional motion of sets of con- nected or disjointed rigid elements . Between 1974 and 1982 several modifica- tions and features were developed by Fleck and Butler under contracts from NHTSA and Air Force Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory (AFAMRL) (35,36). The latest version of this model is known as CVS- IV and also as Version 20 of the CAL3D. The major developments were the following: โข A new, more efficient integration tech- nique. โข Automatic equilibrium routine for a seated occupant. โข An advanced harness-belt routine that treats interaction of belts connected at a common junction point, belt slip- page on deformable segments and rate- dependent belt forces. โข Aerodynamic forces. Incorporation into the main program integrator of the air bag equations and vehicle equations. โข The ability to specify the motion of up to six segments. โข Principal axes may be different from the geometric axes of a segment. This paper reviews the latest version and relies on four volumes of available documen- tation (37) released in 1982 covering the ana- lytical formulation, validation effort, user's manual, and a programmer 1 s manual. ANALYTICAL FORMULATION - The analytical treatment for deriving the equations of motion of sets of rigid bodies used in this model is neither Newtonian nor Lagrang ian. It is simi- lar to the Newtonian method, since the con- straint forces are explicitly contained in the equations of motion without employing Lagrange multipliers. However, constraint relations of the type used in the Lagrange method augmented by compatibility relations as a direct con- sequence of Newton's third law are used. The authors have demonstrated the equivalence of the method used in this model to the classical</page><page sequence="7">4.152 P. PRASAD Lagrange method in Appendix 2 of reference (31), Volume 1. CURRENT VERSION FEATURES - The capability of Version 20 is 30 segments plus the vehicle and ground, with 21 joints and 20 other types of constraints. With proper dimensioning, the capability may be increased. Segments, if connected by joints, have to have "tree structures", i.e. no closed paths can be found which leave a segment via a joint and return to the same segment through another joint. TYPES OF JOINTS - Four types of joints are permitted in this model. They are: 1. Locked 2 . Pinned 3. Ball and socket 4. Euler Joint - based on Euler angles using three axes of rotation. The ball or pinned joints can be locked. The Euler joints can be locked on any com- bination of its principal axes (eight possible conditions including no lock on any axis). For computing joint torques, a separate coordinate system is defined for the joint, described by yaw, pitch and roll angles rela- tive to segment principal axes. Joint coor- dinates are defined for both segments attached to the joint, and the joint torques are com- puted based on a relative angular orientation and velocity of the two coordinate systems. The joint torques can be spring, viscous or friction types and are described similar to those in the MVMA2D. CONTACT FORCES - Contact forces are spe- cified similar to those in the MVMA2D. Three contact force systems are permitted as follows: 1. Ellipsoids with planes 2. Ellipsoids with ellipsoids 3. Inpulsi ve Forces RESTRAINT SYSTEM - The model permits the use of two restraint systems as follows: 1. Belts - simple and advanced 2. Air Bag - stored gas type OTHER CONSTRAINTS - Four other constraints are allowed. They are: 1. Zero distance constraint - a point on one segment be the same as a point on another segment 2. Fixed distance constraint - a speci- fic point on one segment to be a fixed distance from a specified point on another segment. 3. Sliding constraint 4. Rolling constraint SPECIAL ELEMENTS - The model permits the use of two special elements as follows: 1. Tension only - for muscle simulation 2. Flexible element - for possible use in simulating neck, torso and trunk INTEGRATION OF EQUATIONS OF MOTION - Integration is done by a Vector Exponential Integrator that has proven to be more accurate and time efficient than the integrator in CVS III. Three-dimensional rotational equations are integrated using quaternions (also known as Euler Parameters). Hie efficiency of the numerical integra- tion strategy and its accuracy for three- dimensional rigid body motion is demonstrated by simulating a single rotating segment for a case where the exact analytical solution is known (37). EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION - Experimental verification of the model has been attempted by the authors for two sled test conditions using a Part 572 dummy restrained by a three-point belt restraint system and a pre- inflated air bag restraint system. A major portion of this effort consisted of developing input data to describe the physical characteristics and impact responses of the Part 572 dummy by actual laboratory measurements, pendulum tests and simulations of the various pendulum tests. The dummy is described in the model by 15 rigid segments and 14 joints. Three types of joints are used: 1. Ball joints - neck and the lumbar spine 2. Pin joints - knees 3. Euler joints - hips, ankles, shoulders, and elbows A complete description of the dummy segment geometrical and initial properties and joint properties are reported in Part II of the engineering manual. Also reported in this manual are the effective belt/chest stiffness and air bag properties. The sled test results and model results are well documented in Part II of the engi- neering manual. The important model responses compare well with the test results in magnitude and pulse shapes. It is left up to the user to decide whether the fidelity of model simulation is adequate or not. STUDIES USING THE CVS - Since the intro- duction of the model in 1974, several studies using the model have been reported. The majority of the earlier uses of the model has been in studying the pedestrian impact problem. Padgaonkar et al. (38), Niederer (39), Kruse (40), and Fowler et al. (41) were the early users of this model for pedestrian impact simu- lation. The current version vas used by Verma and Repa (42) for pedestrian impact simula- tions. In the earlier versions of the model, vehicle hardware simulation planes could not be intruded into the passenger compartment. Thus side impact simulations were not attempted. Padgaonkar and Prasad (43,44) used Version III of the model and the option of using disjointed sets of ellipsoids to simulate car-to-car side impacts. Newman, et al. (45) and Segal (46) have used the latest version to simulate side impact by using the option of prescribed motion to ellipsoids. Robbins (47) has also reported using the CVS for side impacts. But in the course of the study, the contact model was modified extensively. The final report on this project is not currently available. Whole body ejection problems from high speed aircraft have</page><page sequence="8">OCCUPANT SIMULATION MODELS 4.153 been studied by Frisch (48). Although the validation of the model was done using the advanced harness routine by the authors, only the experience of Newman et al. (45) of British Leyland is reported in the literature. It appears that Newman made exten- sive changes in the routine for simulating frontal impacts with three point belt systems . It is not known whether the current version incorporates the changes made at British Leyland. USER CONVENIENCE - A user convenience package is being developed by McGrath and Segal (49). This package allows a user to generate an input data deck and post process response variables. It also contains plotting and occu- pant kinematics display packages. An occupant display package called VIEW has been developed at AFAMRL and its extensive use has been reported by Kaleps and Marcus (50). SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS An attempt at describing the historical development and the salient features of three occupant/pedestrian simulation models has been made. It can be seen that all the models discussed have gone through many years of deve- lopment and application in a variety of crash environments. These models are general enough that their use is not limited to occupant/pedestrian simulations. It is expected that developments of these models will continue. A few areas of development are suggested below: 1. Energy absorbing steering columns 2. Driver a ir bag mounted of an EA steering column 3. Airbag models capable of simulating "bag slap" effects and out-of- position occupants 4. Pyrotechnic belt retractors and further improvements in belt modeling 5. Seat cushion models 6. Variable step integrators with built-in stability checks 7. User friendliness ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The author wishes to acknowledge the help of R. P. Daniel and C. D.
