<plain_text><page sequence="1">Two Tribal Law Cases (Documents) (Wahidi Sultanate, South-West Arabia) By R. B. SERJEANT (Continued) 2 The Dispute over the Eunaway Wife The general procedure in this case is very similar to that of the aforegoing, but here we have the decision of the tribal mukaddam (pi. makadimah) or headman. Bin 'Awzar's solution of the problem is, of course, very different from a legal decision in a European court to-day, but our methods would probably fail where decisions such as this are effective in obtaining justice. The two parties are con strained to produce other individuals to give evidence to clear or convict them, on an oath which, if false, they firmly believe will swiftly bring upon them the direst consequences.1 Bin 'Awzar, however, envisages a possibility that neither party will be able to produce suitable evidence, and should this happen, he has instructed them to refer back the case to him. It is clear from this case that the plaintiff is not acting from a sense of outraged sentiment, but for economic reasons, for dowries are high in Wahidi territory. Amongst the ra'iyah, dowries of 1,300 Maria Theresa dollars have even been known, but perhaps their dowries are higher than those of tribal women. In Hadramawt the peasant-cultivator pays a dowry of 60 to 100 riyals for a virgin bride, because she is a useful economic asset, working in the fields and house, but the masha'ikh only pay about 35 riyals for a virgin shaikhah, and even the 'Alawi saiyids have a standard 40 riyals for a virgin bride, though by arrangement between the two families it 1 Landberg has described how oaths are taken at the tomb of a saint: " On se range en cercle autour du coffin (tabiit), ou le simple tombeau (kabr), s'il n'y a pas de tabiit. Si le misdjid (mosque) ou la kubbah (domed tomb) sont petits, on s'aligne devant la porte. Lorsqu' il y a plusieurs personnes appelees a preter serment, on commence d'abord par une marche autour du sanctuaire, en se placant deux a deux, les uns apres les autres. On chants des maradjiz. Leur arrivee est signalee par des salves de fusil . . . Quelque saiyid ou shaikh est toujours present a ces ceremonies pour empecher que le sang coule, car l'excitation est toujours grande. Ce n'est pourtant qu' une partie remise ; hors du territoire du wall la vengeance cherche sa victime jusqu'a ce qu' elle la frappe. Cette pratique de se purger d'une accusation moyennant le serment est la kasamah des anciens Arabes (Arabica V, op. cit., pp. 141-2).</page><page sequence="2">TWO TRIBAL LAW CASES (DOCUMENTS) 157 may be more. The reason stated for the strange practice of the upper classes in paying less for their brides than peasants, is that their women do far less work than a peasant woman, or even none at all.

They delivered over hostages into the hands of the qaim of Maifa'ah, Muhammad bin Sa'id al-Wahidi, as a guarantee of one (tribe) to the other, in the (matter of) the scrutiny (3) of the case, and the setting forth of claims (in the customary way of) the tribe of the Ahl Hamad bin Dhiyaib (4), according to their precedents (5) and laws. This (action took place) in (the case of) the wife of Salim bin Husain Ba 'Awdah Lashraf and, over and above that, the theft of the sheep and the she-camel (6). I, the qaim of Maifa'ah bring (7) them the judges whom I choose from the Al Ba 'Awdah. (5) A Plaint Copy of the Plaint of Salim bin Husain :? (I bring a plaint) before (8) God, and before you, oh Bin 'Awzar (9), that my wife ran away to her father's (house), and that I followed her at once, and deposited my pledge (10) for that on account of which my wife is with-held, according to the procedure of the tribe, but Ba Turab refused any pledge, and did not produce my wife. So help me, and trouble me (11) ! What I stole from Ba Turab</page><page sequence="5">160 TWO TRIBAL LAW CASES (DOCUMENTS) when he was refusing (12), does not cause me to incur any liability for a fine (13), according to that which (comes) within the custom of the Ahl Ba 'Awdah. (6) A Defence Copy of the Defence of 'All bin Salim Ba Turab :? My defence, oh Bin 'Awzar, is that my " honour " (14) came to me, being beaten, and not having received in full (the clothes and jewellery due to her (15)), and that Bin Lashraf came to me and sat in my house, and I agreed to return (16) him his wife if he would deliver (to her) the woman's clothing and jewellery he still owes her, (and) on account of which the woman is with-held, in accordance with the laws of the tribe ; but he refused to pay, and I am (there fore) before God, and before thee, oh (thou who) givest impartial justice (17). (7) A Judgment Copy of the Decision of Bin 'Awzar Ba 'Awdah :? A decision (in accordance with the circumstances (18)) between Bin Lashraf and the Ahl Ba Turab is necessary. I have decided that two witnesses for Bin Lashraf, honourable persons, neither parties in opposition (to the other family) nor interested persons, should be produced to the qaim of Maifa'ah, to testify to God, and before the hands of God (19), an absolute and irrevocable testimony, that Salim bin Husain deposited a pledge for Ba Turab, in respect of his wife, on account of that for which his wife is with-held, the pledge holder being responsible (20); but that Ba Turab refused, and that no clothing and jewellery due to the woman remain outstanding with Bin Lashraf. If Bin Lashraf produces the witnesses, according to the usages of the tribe, he will obtain damages for his wife, for each day (21) two measures (22) and a half of grain ; and for that which he took from the person refusing (23) he shall pay no fine. If Bin Husain Lashraf fails (to produce) witnesses, the Ahl Ba Turab must (produce) five persons, each individual swearing a single oath (24) by (the saint) Ba Lahman (25), the first of whom shall be Dumaidim (26) and the second Lakwar, swearing by God the Merciful the Compassionate who fills the Heavens with his mercy (27), and your head, oh Ba Lahman, an oath extinguishing fires, emptying houses, cutting off wealth and fortune (28), (that) he did not produce a responsible pledge-holder for us, in the matter of that on account of</page><page sequence="6">TWO TRIBAL LAW CASES (DOCUMENTS) 161 which the wife of Bin Husain Lashraf is with-held, and that he (still) owes of her clothing and jewellery the following separately detailed items (29). If they swear, they are acquitted. If all fail (30) they should refer (the case) to me. This is the decision which the headman Muhammad bin Sa'id bin 'Awzar Ba 'Awdah gave. And God knows what is correct. Notes (1) Note the spelling 'Awdah or 'Awzah. (2) I.e. Muh. b. Sa'id. (3) I was told that nakd al-kalam meant scrutiny of the case to see whether it was a sharfah or 'adah case, but I cannot think that was the intention here. (4) One of the three sub-tribes of the Ba 'Awdah, the Hal Yamanah, the Al Biharah, and the Hal Dhiyaib. Landberg, Arabica V, op. cit., p. 231, names them the Al Husain b. 'Umar, the Al 'All bin 'Umar, and the Hal Dhiyaib b. 'Umar. They are doubtless the same. (5) The term sawalif seems to be of general use amongst Arab tribes, and is even found in the Sudan amongst the Beja (J. S. Trimingham, Islam in the Sudan (London, 1949), p. 180, footnote). The phrase above might also be rendered, " according to ancient custom and law." (6) Le. the theft of these animals by Lashraf from Ba Turab as a sort of forcible compensation when the latter withheld Lashraf's wife. Lashraf, even if he had only paid over part of the agreed dowry, was nevertheless being deprived of services for which pay ment had been made. (7) Note the change to the present tense, a not infrequent occurrence in narrative. (8) As in the other plaint bi-'llah is used, whereas in other places 'ind (at) is used. It might be better here to translate the phrase as " by God ". (9) Bin 'Awzar is the mukaddam (chief) of the Ba 'Awdah, a stoutish man, light skinned, for a Wahidi tribesman. (10) This pledge may be placed in the hands of any responsible person. Lashraf deposits a pledge for the unpaid portion of the dowry with a third party. He does not, of course, place it in the hands of his father-in-law, in the hope that the latter would return his wife.</page><page sequence="7">162 TWO TRIBAL LAW CASES (DOCUMENTS) (11) I.e. "to produce witnesses ", as in the previous set of documents. (12) I.e. to return Bin Lashraf s wife. The sense is clear though the word is difficult. (13) The term employed, kafi, was explained to me as being the responsibility to return a stolen camel (and here, no doubt, the sheep also), and to pay a fine of five kurush (dollars) in addition. See note 12 to document 1. (14) The term which has been translated as " honour " is actually the word 'ar, which is equivalent to the word 'aib, a well-known term, which might perhaps be rendered as " impugnment of personal or tribal honour ". It is used here as a circumlocution for " my daughter ",as the tribesman dislikes reference to a female relative in the presence of others. It is, in fact, a term used to mean any female relative, because one's honour can be impugned in them. C. von Landberg, Hadramout (Leiden, 1901), p. 173, gives the term ma'iirah from the same root, as " la femme parce qu'elle est le 'ar de l'homme, la chose qu'il doit defendre Le djar = rabi' ou nazil est aussi mon 'ar ", etc. It is possible that a tribesman only cares about the sexual conduct of his womenfolk insofar as it reflects upon his own honour, though any tribesman here would impress on one, if questioned, the extreme measures he would take in the case of any sexual misdemeanour on the part of his womenfolk. In Daw'an, however, I was informed of a type of tribal custom where, if a tribesman finds his wife in flagrante delicto with another, he demands payment with damages, to divorce the woman, who is then married by the adulterer. This is known as Irtibat, and is mentioned by 'All bin Ahmad bin Sa'id Ba Sabrain in his Djumal min al-Muhimmat al-Diniyah (written 1294 h.), a copy of which is described in BSOAS. (1951), op. cit. A Wahidi Sultan with a well-deserved reputation for gallantry, whispered to me that the sister of one of the individuals whose name figures in this collection had a reputation not free from reproach. I find it difficult, however, to believe that Wahidi tribeswomen can indulge in secret affairs of the heart, owing to the virtual impossibility of concealment. Tabari, Tafsir, v, 14, quotes Ibn 'Abbas as saying of the Arabs of the Djahiliya, " They used to forbid (haram) such adultery (zina) as appeared, but to allow (istahall) what was hidden, saying, ' concerning that which appears, it is disgrace (lu'm),</page><page sequence="8">TWO TRIBAL LAW CASES (DOCUMENTS) 163 but as for what is hidden, that does not matter.' " This reveals the essence of the tribesman's attitude to the subject. In this connection, the gist of a conversation I had with the new Sultan Nasir may be quoted. The women of the sultans never leave the house, except perhaps two or three times in the year, for a funeral, feast, etc., when they may visit another house in 'Azzan. A woman is then accompanied by her husband, leading the way, the woman following at a little distance. If the Sultan did not accompany his wife, the Bedouin meeting her, might cut off an ear or a lock of hair as an insult ('ar) to the Sultans. Their women do not laugh or talk much in the village of 'Azzan itself lest they be heard by Bedouin, who would say such conduct was unseemly. Should the Sultan's wife go to the window to look out on account of some noise in the street, he would reprimand her sharply and ask why she had done so. Sultans usually, it seems, marry tribeswomen. Sultan Nasir himself was betrothed to a girl of the Al Liswad, near Habban, and I was present at the betrothal visit and feast. Sultans can, of course, marry from all sections of the population except the Saiyids. In 'Azzan, the 'Askar al-Sultan (Soldiers of the Sultan), now mostly merchants owning a little land (tin), and no longer regarded as tribesmen, seem to allow their women to come and go more freely than the Sultans. The 'abid women move at their liberty, unveiled. In the tall dars here, women live on the floor below the roof, and on the roof itself during the cooler portions of the day. Visiting a masha'ikh house in Rudum, our host preceded us upstairs shouting " tank " as he went, to avert the women, as is common practice in South Arabia. In general, women of noble blood are much less restricted in Tarim and Saiwiin than in Wahidi country, but wives of the Shibam merchants seem more closely confined, like women of the Wahidi towns. (15) Lit. " shortage ", but it refers to what is known in Wahidi territory and elsewhere as kashsh (see Landberg, Gl. Dath.), i.e. appurtenances of a woman, such as jewellery, clothing, and cosmetics, kept in a wooden box roughly painted in traditional style. These are agreed upon in the marriage settlement, but actually delivered later, or at least the full amount is usually delivered later. In Wahidi houses the woman, i.e. wife of the owner, has a little room of her own (khalwah), sometimes used for more honoured</page><page sequence="9">164 TWO TRIBAL LAW CASES (DOCUMENTS) guests who may wish a little privacy, or where a few friends are enter tained when the main reception room is not used. The woman is not, of course, present on these occasions. In this room she keeps her silver ornaments in the wooden box, and the walls are hung with a great variety of household gear, all this known as shakkah ; there are basket containers of all sorts and sizes, gaily coloured palm-fibre trays (tafalah) for rice, etc., cloth or food stored in baskets, wooden bowls, incense burners, the cosmetic-pots, often old powder-horns of metal, or beaded glass bottles like African work, leather pillows, Japanese enamelled plates, and innumerable odds and ends, nearly all hung on the walls. The floor is covered with matting and the whole, when new, is pleasing. (16) The sense of the context is clear, but the verb wakkaf is a little difficult. The reading is, no doubt, correct, as the texts were checked several times. One might otherwise have expected waffakt, but perhaps, by transposition, this dialect gives wakkaf the sense of waffak. (17) Bin 'Awzar is addressed here. (18) This is how the term fasl (lit. separation) was explained. It was also explained by the term hukm, which appears in the title of this document, but cf. vocabulary to the texts. (19) This should not, I think, be regarded as an anthropomorphic phrase, but merely as Arabic idiom. (20) Presumably to pay over the pledge, if required. Vide supra. (21) I.e. for each day that his wife has been withheld by her father, the latter paying over the damages. Conversely, a woman who has fled to her people cannot re-marry or claim support from her husband (Landberg, Hadramout, 163). (22) I assume that a mikyal is the same as a kailah. Wahidi cubic measures are as follows :? 2 kailahs (pi. akyal) 1 mudd 2 mudds 1 mizarah (maizarah) 2 maizarahs 1 sa? 2 sa' 1 dhahab (pi. dhihab) According to Landberg, Arabica V, op. cit., p. 292, the dhahab is equal to eight Aden bushels. My informants said it was equivalent to 12 musras or 2 kahawils. (23) He must, of course, return the stolen animals. (24) One individual hallafah or oath-giver might take five separate</page><page sequence="10">TWO TRIBAL LAW CASES (DOCUMENTS) 165 oaths, but five hallafah hattamahs will only take a single oath each, this, no doubt, being regarded as a more stringent oath than the former type. It is necessary to insert hattamah to specify that five different persons shall take the oath. (25) Ba Lahman is the wall (saint) at Djol al-Shaikh. The present mansab there is Shaikh 'AH b. Kasim b. 'Abd al-Mani', the latter being the family name of the Masha'ikh there. Cf. Landberg, Arabica V, op. cit., p. 172, where it is noted that the mansab of that time was a mubashshi', i.e. one able to perform trial by ordeal. For bish'ah see also 'Arif al-'Arif, al-Kada bain al-Badw (Jerusalem, 1933), p. 95, and Landberg, Gl. Dath. The 'Abd al-Mani' have " spiritual influence " over the Ba 'Awdah. Landberg's visit to Djol al-Shaikh was remembered. The shaikh asked him for 200 riyals as a gift for having entertained him. (26) Dumaidim is the father of Ba Turab, but I have not recorded who Lakwar is, perhaps he may be the uncle of Ba Turab. (27) Rahmah, which has also the sense of " rain ". In Hadramawt it is said : " Sultan Hadramawt al-rahmah," i.e. " The sultan of Hadramawt is Rain ". (28) Thariyah, here translated as " fortune ", was explained to me as meaning " inheritance ". It seems to me that the phrase is really a jingle, but perhaps the word dhurriyah offspring is also in the minds of the speakers. For types of oaths in North Arabia, see " 'Arif al-'Arif", op. cit., pp. 72 ff. (29) Lit. " to the limit of what is a limit ". (30) I.e. if neither party is able to produce the required number of witnesses. Summary This case does not seem to me to be inconsistent with shari'ah law, while in two important points it agrees exactly with principles enunciated in the fourteenth century Ahkdm al-Man'ah (cf. supra) which tends to bear out the contention of the author of that work, namely that Man'ah is not inconsistent with shari'ah but an extension of it. On fol. 726 the author says that the plaintiff in all the Man'ah laws has the onus of the proof, and on him who denies the charge is the necessity for taking the oath to this effect. The Ahkam al-Man'ah also states (fol. 576) that " whosoever takes away his (relative-in law's) wife from the house of his relative-in-law (sihr) without cause, and without fault on the part of the husband, has done wrong, and</page><page sequence="11">166 TWO TRIBAL LAW CASES (DOCUMENTS) must pay restitution (nisfah) to the extent of a ram worth ten dirhams ". Fines prescribed in special cases follow. Comparison may be made also with the section on Kasamah in Bukhari, Sahih (trans. 0. Houdas (Paris, 1914), iv, 414. Appendix The Appointment of a Mansab of the MasM'iJch The mansab in Southern Arabia is the ruler of the sacred enclaves known as Hawtah, independent entities owing obedience to no temporal overlord. The Hawtah is a centre for the tribes, neutral territory upon which they can meet to trade or settle disputes.1 The mansab is naturally a person of great importance in the country, and acts as impartial mediator between warring tribes. In turn, the tribes have some say in the election of a mansab of Masha'ikh, in the Wahidi area, but among the Sadah in Hadramawt the mansabate seems usually to be hereditary. The notes upon which this appendix is based were taken from the Mansab of Sa'id himself, Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Muhammad Ba Kadir, of the Ba Kadir Masha'ikh, descended from Kadir bin 'Abdullah, who is buried at Sa'id. When a mansab dies, a hawik (khadim, servant) or sabl (of the non-Arab but Arabic-speaking submerged race known in this part of South Arabia as Subyan) is sent with a note to all districts to inform the people. The kaba'il (tribes), ra'aya (peasants and craftsmen, etc.), sultans, and subyan collect at the village of the deceased. They recite the Koran over his grave, and are entertained to a feast known as walimat al-nakad,2 the expenses of which are borne by the brother or son of the late mansab. The chiefs of the land (ru'asa '1-Ard) collect and select a new mansab, that is to say the principal persons and the representatives of the various classes. The ra'aya have no real head of their class, but they elect (istanldiabu) one. Notables of all sections then, including the Masha'ikh, collect in a circle in the open. All must consent to the election. The dawlah (sultans) are said to be present only for consultation, as the election is a matter for the people of the district, but I was informed that Sultan Salih bin Muhsin of 'Azzan 1 For the Hawtah and the Habat, material from Landberg has been utilized in articles in the Encyl. of Islam. These might be consulted. Sa'id is a Ilabat. 2 nakad to go away (according to my informants). Gl. Dath. gives it the sense of to annul, untie.</page><page sequence="12">TWO TRIBAL LAW CASES (DOCUMENTS) 167 was a supporter (hamil) at the election of the Shaikh of Al-Rawdah. I am not sure whether potential mansabs would be present at the election, but I think they can hardly be present at the preliminary discussions. Among the Bin 'Abd al-Mani', there are three branches (shu'iib). and the mansabate passes from one branch to another in rotation, The other Masha'ikh have the office of mansab confined to one house (dar) only.1 When the mansab has been elected, one of the mansab's own fakhidhah (section) walks round the assembled circle several times, carrying a rosary, and then throws it over the head of the chosen person, saying : " This is our father " (Hadha abti-na). All present inform the newly elected shaikh that they wish him to be their mansab. The tribesmen like a mansab to be generous with the funds at his disposal, but for his functions, clearly he must be endowed with other qualities also. After this, all go and visit the wall (saint) whose descendant the mansab is, and the mansab enters the kubbah (domed tomb) with all the people. They touch the kafas (wooden or adobe ark-shaped canopy over the tomb), and go round the shawahid (either the four corner-posts of the canopy, or the projecting upright stones on top of the tomb),2 beat drums, and sing mukhidhs (panegyrics of the saint), a sort of chant. From here all proceed to the mansab's house and entertainment (diyafah) is prepared for them. They feast, and each individual gives the mansab a present, every man according to his means (kullain bi-kadaruh), to help to defray the expenses of the occasion. When he is appointed, conditions are made with a mansab. Shaikh 'Abdullah Ba Kadir showed me the agreement made at his own election, but I did not find it of sufficient interest to transcribe and examine in the limited time at my disposal. I did note its principal terms. The mansab entertains all who come. He judges between the tribes and the ra'aya. According to usual practice in South Arabia, the tribes must help the mansab against a wrong 1 For the Masha'ikh of the Wahidi area, see Landberg, Arabica V, op. cit., pp. 189 ff. The Masha'ikh of Sa'id, 2jol al-Shaikh, al-Hawtah, and Al-Rawdah, are all descended from a common ancestor, and they claim descent from 'Abd al-Kadir al-Djilani. 2 For some notes and sketches of the shapes of tombs, see my The Cemeteries of Tanm (Museon, (Louvain, 1949)).</page><page sequence="13">168 TWO TRIBAL LAW CASES (DOCUMENTS) doer or pay a fine. The main part of the agreement was largely taken up with a list of fines for offences by tribesmen (kaba'il) against miskins (peasants). If, for example, the kabili should steal an ox, he must return the ox and a sum equivalent to its value, half (nasifah) to the mansab, and half to the robbed person (manhub). If a kabili commits a misdemeanour, the usual procedure is to interdict him from the suk (market), which in the case of Hawtat al-Fakih 'All is an important sanctuary. The economic insufficiency of the tribesman is thus apparent, as he must have recourse to the market, and this is a powerful weapon in the hands of a mansab.
