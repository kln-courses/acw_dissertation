<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIII.-PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. Vol. xvii., No. 5. J. Seth. 'The Alleged Fallacies in Mill's " Utilitarianismn".' [Acquits Mill of the charge of various logical fallacies: as of composition, in his proof of the principle, of utility; of figure of speech, in his use of the term ' desirable'; of irrelevancy, in his treatment of motives; of contradiction, in his ac- ceptance of psychological hedonism; of confusion, in his doctrine of the qualitative distinction between pleasures. As.regards the two last points,, " Mill was not concerned . . . with the deeper ethical question which we, cannot help raising. His entire arguiinent is dominated by the practical purpose which inspires the essay."] W. Fite. 'The Agent and the- Observer.' [The observer's view is inechanical, visually descriptive; the observer's is logical and teleological, anthropomorphic and automorphic, couched in terms predominantly of organic and muscular contents. The author shows the importance and the consequences of the distinction within descriptive psychology, and indicates the partiality, inadequacy and abstractness of each view taken alone. In particular, the observer's, view involves both exclusion and distortion; witness the conce.ptions of humanity offered by the social sciences.] E. H. Hollands. 'Neo-- Realism and Idealism.' [The epistemology of neo-realism rejects the representative theory of knowledge: it thus parus company with the older realism, and finds itself in agreement with objective idealism. But. it holds, also, that knowledge makes no difference to the facts which are known; here it conflicts with objective idealism. Negatively, however, its criticism is aimed almost exclusively at subjectivism; positively, it is committed to a procedure which starts with reals and tries to arrive at, relations of reals. In other words, it has not met objective idealism in the field of controversy, and its constructive effort lags behind that of objective idealism as a statement, not a solution, of the metaphysical problem.] W. K. Wright. 'Happiness as an Ethical Postulate.' [There is a peculiar mental experience which attends moral action, partly cognitive an4 partly affective. " In its affective aspect, it is pleasurable. because self-consciousness is unimpaded in its contemplation of the moral worth of its action. It is cognitive because the ends striven for are . . . cognised. The experience . . . represents the highest satisfaction that a moral man can experience,-it is happiness." In this sense happiness, as an ethical postulate, becomes morally significant and finds psycho- logical support.] Reviews of Books. Notices of New Books. Summaries. of Articles. Notes.

The illusion is not confined to moments of monocular vision.] 'On Meaning: a Symposium before the Western Philosophical Association, December, 1907.' W. B. Pills= bury. 'i. Meaning and Imaoe.' [Ordinarily, image is taken to be the primary process, and meaning is either derived from it or made a second ultimate. Really, meanino, is the primary process in concrete conscious- ness, and image is but a certain kind of meaning. Meaning is a co-ordi. nation, an interrelation bebween sensation, idea and earlier experience, controlled or represented by the purpose of the moment; it implies a sensory content associated wibh a vast number of other sensory and motor elements, dominated by still other and more remote nervous pro- cesses. Image is the psychologist's construction, set up to explain mental roperations.] S. Colvin. 'Ii. The Nature of the Mental Image.' [We .cannot usefully distinguish the image epistemologically, in terms of -reality, or physiologically, in terms of the seat of the aroused processes. InLtrospection also breaks down, since somne psychologists make image and -sensation fundamentally the same, while others find a qualitative differ- ence. Imagination is best defined as that activity of consciousness in -which an object of sensation is experienced as not immediately present *to the senses. The reaction to perception is prompt and definite, while the reaction to image, though it must be made, may be postponed.] T. L. Bolton. 'iii. Meaning as Adjustment.' [It is the attitude of the experiencing subject that gives meaning to the object; perception arises through a reaction that is characteristic of the obj ect perceived. The meaning is, however, never complete or exhausted, since it is contained only partly in the adjustment that has taken place, and partly in other reactions that are about to take place. This incompleteness is a general character of consciousness.] J. E. Boodin. ' iv. Truth and Meaning.' [Meaning in its essential aspect is intent; imagery is means or by-play. 'Truth is one species of meaning. Its criterion is not usefulness, or even (without qualification) satisfaction; for this is only a coefficient of the terminating of an idea in a certain reality which it intends-or suspects. 'The test of truth is the agreement of idea or belief with its reality: formal, as of idea with idea in formal reasoning; or material, as of idea -with facts of a perceptual and individual kind in concrete truth. Truth must agree with the future ; individual and social selection are subject to cosmical selection.] J. M. Baldwin. ' Knowledge and Imagination.' [Discusses the difference between the semblant or imaginative and the .actual or truthful meaning, and the parts that they play in the upward movement of knowledge. Every cognitive content must have both renderings; belief motives make-believe and make-believe engenders belief. The instrutn3ntal meaning is a personal and imaginative re- reading of an actual or truthful meaning, and the truthful meaning is .a common and actual re-reading of an imaginative personal construction. What, then, is the end of im-igtnation? It may be theoretical, the true, or practical, the good; or it may be aosthetic or intrinsic, the real par excellence. As the self -reality of inner and the thing-reality of outer con,- -trol get apart in the development of experience as cogrnitive, so do they- come together in the oesthetic mode. This asthetic mode of realising has -the bnly meaning that can be called in any intelligible sense absolute.] Discussion. F. C. French. 'Group Self-Consciousness: a Stage in the Evolution of Mind.'

VOl. XiX., No. 3. E. Murray. 'A Qualitative Analysis of Tickling: Its Relation to Cutaneous and Organic Sensation.' [The first part of the paper reports a careful intro- spective analysis of the pressure quality, and concludes that Goldscheider's granular pressure is a complex: the elementary tactual quality is ' con- tact-brightness,' and the dull substrate of the Goldscheider pressure is. a secondary and probably a non-cutaneous factor. The second part is devoted to a similar analysis of tickling, and concludes that tickling is. "an intensely vivid complex of unsteady, ill-localised and ill-analysedc sensation, with attention distributed over the immnediate sensory contents, and the concomitant sensations reflexly evoked". The sensory basis of the experience is contact-brightness; but in actual experience tickling differs from the ordinary contact-complex as 'feeling' from perception. A 'feeling' (as here defined) is a coherent and persistent mass of sensory- elements, unanalysed and but roughly localised, which has an intrinsic claim on the attention and is distinguished by peculiar vividness and. strong dynamogenic value; the tickle-experience, in particular, is a form. of the 'feeling' of excitement.] F. L. Wells. 'A Neglected Measure of Fatigue.'

The. rapid and marked improvement by practice throws additional doubt. on the general influence of any form of specific practice. Individual difference in the changes of rate of improvement is, probably, due not. only to the operation of one identical law modified by difference in con- ditions, but also to the action of radically different laws, operating on different individuals according to the different physiological changes in them which underlie improvement. Greater original capacity apparently gains as much as (or more than) lesser capacity from the same environ- mental training; and capacity to improve more quickly to a small degree probably means capacity to improve to a higher degree under the maximum of efficient training.] W.

B. Baillie. ' The Dramatic and Ethical Elements of Experience.' [Finds the essential character of a dramatic situation in the invasion of the moral life and purposes of an individual by factors that are non-moral, but which are inseparable from morality itself and form its co-element in human ex- perience. The distinction between its two forms, tragedy and comedy, depends on the permanency or temporariness of the conflict, i.e., on whether the reconciliation remains a demand or is actually brought about by the course of events.] C. W. Super. 'Ethics and Law.' [Directed against the statement that in the progressive alteration of laws the appeal is from law to ethical principles. Contends that, while ethics deals with personal virtue and motive, legislation is concerned with the promotion of justice without taking account of these, or even with affairs which have nothing to do with justice and are only matters of expediency. Ethical progress and legislation do not keep pace with each other.] W. M. Salter. ' A New Type of Naturalism-Montgomery.' [" Parts company equally with materialism and with current idealism. The peculiarity and originality of his way of thinking lies in his use and interpretation of biological facts." All motion, being reaction, is in a sense creation-the realisation of inherent potencies. "All we call material is idealistic in nature, i.e., is conscious experience, actual or imagined." But conscious experience is not self-contained or self- explicable; it implies " an ektra-conscious reality, both without and within man ".

The " power to work " is really an a pri9ri principle imperfectly recognised.
