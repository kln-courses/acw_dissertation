<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEATH AND RELIGION IN THE SOUTHERN MOCHE PERIPHERY: FUNERARY PRACTICES AT HUAMBACHO, NEPENA VALLEY, PERU David Chicoine This article explores religion, death, and mortuary practices in the Southern Moche (A.D. 1-800) periphery as viewed through the excavation of grave contexts at the site of Huambacho, Nepeha Valley, Peru. Moche influence reached Nepeha as is vis ible in the construction of religious buildings at the site of Panamarca and the presence of Moche style ceramics at several sites. In 2003 and 2004, scientific excavations at Huambacho, an Early Horizon center mainly built and occupied during the first millennium B.C., yielded a series of intrusive graves containing Gallinazo, Virii, and Moche style objects. This con tribution contextualizes these discoveries and focuses on the analysis of funerary patterns of burial, osteological evidence, and symbolic meanings with the objective of understanding local funerary practices and Moche religious and cultural expres sions. Symbolic references to coast-highland interactions, inversions in body positioning, and possible human sacrifices bring insights into the complex and potentially tense sociohistorical cirmcumstances in Nepeha during the Moche phase. Este articulo explora la religion, muerte, y costumbres funerarias en la periferia sur de los moche, basandose en la excavation de contextos de entierros en el sitio de Huambacho, Valle de Nepeha, Peru. La influencia moche llego a Nepeha como es apre ciable en la construction de edificios religiosos en el sitio de Panamarca y en la presencia de ceramica de estilo Moche en varios sitios. En 2003 y 2004, excavaciones cientificas en Huambacho, un centro del Horizonte Temprano construido y ocu pado principalmente durante el primer milenio a.C. , permitieron el descubrimiento de una serie de entierros intrusivos con objetos de estilo Gallinazo, Virit, y Moche. Esta contribution contextualiza estos descubrimientos y se enfoca en el analisis de los patrones de enterramiento, la evidencia osteologica, y sus significados simbolicos con el objetivo de entender las prac ticas funerarias locales y la expresion cultural y religiosa moche. Referencias simbolicas a interacciones entre la costa y la sierra, inversiones en el tratamiento de los cuerpos, y posibles sacrificios humanos brindan information sobre las complejas y potencialmente tensas circunstancias sociohistoricas durante lafase Moche en Nepeha. Anthropologists have long recognized the value of funerary practices for the study of religious beliefs, social organization, and status differentiation (Binford 1971; Tainter 1978). Indeed, the ways in which people treat a deceased member of their community, dispose of one's body, and perceive their relationships with the dead are central social practices. Funerary rit uals are encoded with rich symbolic meanings, which are best understood in terms of religious ide ology, socio-historical contexts, and perception (Buikstra 1995; Cannon 1989). Funerary behaviors are essential to the consti tution of society and they hold potential for mate rializing dominant ideologies and promoting interests over competing groups. As ceremonial events, they become arenas for manipulation and negotiation (DeMarrais et al. 1996:17) and, as such, mortuary practices are relevant to understanding the adherence or resistance of communities to cer tain religious ideologies. In the Americas, one of the most famous and spectacular ancient funerary traditions is associated with the Moche (ca. A.D. 1-800) of the north coast of Peru. Much debate surrounds Moche sociopo litical organization, but it is generally agreed that this society was highly stratified and characterized by strong inequalities, especially visible in differ ential funerary treatments (Chapdelaine 2001:77; Millaire 2002:137). Moche influence extended over a vast portion of the north coast, and certain poli ties coalesced around a powerful religious ideology materialized in a very distinctive art style, ritual paraphernalia and elaborate funerary practices and David Chicoine ■ Department of Geography and Anthropology, Louisiana State University, 227 Howe-Russell-Kniffen Geoscience Complex, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 (dchico@lsu.edu) Latin American Antiquity 22(4), 2011, pp. 525-548 Copyright ©2011 by the Society for American Archaeology 525</page><page sequence="2">526 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 Piura\ Piura Moche ' Vv \ La Leche Lambayeque' Zar)a\ Lambayeque Moche »i -o y o Jequetepeque V® 4 ^Jequetepeque Moche \-s. o Chicama Moche •6 4 Southern Moche Wrtn Chao fore Sanfag *10 o NEPENA Casma\ o -7 »ii ,\ 1 Sipan 8 Huaca de la Cruz 2 San Jose de Mora 9 Guadalupito 3 Pacatnamii 10 El Castillo de Santa 4 Dos Cabezas 11 Manchan 5 El Brujo 12 Cerro Lampay 6 Huaca de la Luna 13 Pachacamac 7 Huancaco Huarmeyx Fortaleza Pativilca N Supe © .12, Huara \ Chancay^ 150 Chilldn) ■U - o I V km Rimac'X^t Lurln Figure 1.

The mechanisms of Moche religio-political expansion are still unclear. While traditional hege monic views emphasize the centralization and homogeneity of the Moche world (Larco 1938; Strong and Evans 1952), recent studies indicate the existence of multiple cultural and political regions from Piura in the north to Ancash in the south (Fig ure 1) (see Castillo and Quilter 2010:14-15). Fur ther, it now appears that styles like Gallinazo and Viru, traditionally considered as ancestral to Moche, are contemporary and materialized the existence of distinct social groups and probably polities (Millaire and Morlion 2009). In this con stellation of Moche worlds, shared religious iden tities were materialized through ritual displays and allegiances expressed most saliently in burial treat ments and sacrificial practices (Castillo 2010; Don nan 2010).

The corpus presented here includes graves with Gallinazo, Viru, and Moche style grave goods. Analyses of burial contexts, funerary sym bolism, and osteological remains bring insights into the relationships between Gallinazo, Viru, and Moche phenomena, as well as atypical funerary practices and eventual violent death including tor ture and strangulation. While some graves contain Moche style grave goods, they also display signif icant differences that underscore the complexity of religious networks and political organization in the southern part of the Moche world. This article explores the symbolic meanings of local practices and suggests that archaeologists might have overemphasized the homogeneity of Moche funer ary behaviors. of Ancash, the presence of the southernmost cere monial center with Moche monumental art and architecture suggests a strong religious influence. Yet little is known of local funerary behaviors dur ing the Moche phase (Proulx 1982:85). of energy expenditure have been particularly use ful in understanding the relationships between social ranking and funerary treatment (O'Shea 1984; Tainter 1978). More recently, scholars have suggested that graves are venues for negotiation and affirmation of social structures. Emphasizing more symbolic and contextual approaches, archaeolo gists have focused on how grave contexts are his torically constituted as important social strategies (Cannon 1989; DeMarrais 2004; DeMarrais et al. 1996; Pader 1982). From that standpoint, funerary archaeology aims at unraveling the meanings and messages coded into grave contexts (Buikstra 1995:32). Bodies themselves have the potential to become symbolic arenas and spectacles open to manipulation as exemplified in post- and peri mortem alterations such as torture, delayed burial, grave re-entry and dismemberment (Hill 2005; Mil laire 2004; Verano 1998). Background Funerary practices are one of the most salient expressions of the belief in the non-material aspects of human existence. They are rites of pas sage that materialize a series of complex relation ships between funerary actors, including the corpse of the deceased, the soul and the mourners (van Gennep 1965). These actions have the objectives of separating the deceased from the community, treating its corpse and soul so as to avoid poten tial danger for the collectivity, and reestablishing the social persona of the deceased, often in the form of an ancestor, into collective memory (Bloch and Parry 1982). Archaeologists studying death have invested special efforts in trying to unravel the social sig nificance of funerary practices. One approach has been to consider such practices as reflections of the social organization of a given community, arguing that the variability in grave contexts is a function of the complexity of social relations and hierarchies (Binford 1971; Saxe 1970). Studies of the dynam ics responsible for mortuary variability and degrees In Peru, the discovery in the late 1980s of elab orate royal burials at the site of Sipan in the Lam bay eque Valley (Alva 1988) has highlighted the rich symbolic meaning embedded in Moche grave con texts. Beyond "vertical" differences associated with hierarchical ranking and social inequalities, schol ars have highlighted a wide range of "horizontal" distinctions within Moche funerary treatment and the significance of this heterogeneity for under standing status diversity, group membership, and belief systems (Castillo and Rengifo 2008; Chapde laine et al. 2009; Donnan 2007). Hence, the more symbolic aspects of grave contexts and their asso ciated variability hold potential to bridge the gap between regional patterns and local funerary prac tices. Considering that social roles and identities are fluid and open to manipulation, the expression of institutionalized religious behaviors may vary (Parker Pearson 1999:33). Moche funerary behaviors are best understood as the outcomes of a rich coastal tradition, but their high degree of elaboration and complexity, unseen before the Early Intermediate Period (Millaire 2002:168), suggest that funerary practices and reli gion were closely related to the ways polities extended their membership and, under certain cir cumstances, became unified (Bawden 2004:125; Donnan 2010:47; Shimada 2010:71). In this per spective , the adoption of, adaptation of and/or resis tance to the dominant religious ideology —as materialized in mortuary patterns—must have been</page><page sequence="4">528 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 at the core of inter-community interactions and rit ual identities. der-onented mortuary practices are not unique to the Moche and similar patterns have been observed in pre-Moche times (Makowski 2002:115). One way to assess the diversity with which local groups along the North Coast engaged with Moche religious ideas is to investigate their conception of death and burial treatment: from the preparation and encasing of the corpse to the elaboration and loca tion of funerary chambers, and the quantity and quality of grave goods (Donnan 1995; Millaire 2002). Funerary variability has to be understood in terms of scale, group membership, and status diver sity (Millaire 2002:166). Moche deceased were typically buried under ground1 , in a fully extended position2, on their back, with the hands alongside the body or placed on the pelvis. This position is believed to be symbolically associated with concepts of rest and sleep (Rowe 1995:27). Feet are usually found side-by-side, although ankles can be crossed and/or tied together. Corpses were consistently wrapped in textile shrouds and sometimes placed inside a coffin. Some body parts were at times offered special treat ments. The face could be covered with red pigments and the hair braided or bundled (Donnan 1995:123). Burials were located in different contexts includ ing subfloor pits in residences, cemeteries, and non residential buildings. Bodies were placed inside chambers that ranged from simple pits to elaborate adobe rooms. The location of the graves could be marked with special objects, such as wooden posts or ceramic vessels, in order to facilitate reopening. More elaborate graves tend to be located inside or near monumental buildings, while less elaborate contexts are typically found outside ceremonial structures, in cemeteries or residential architecture in the periphery of important buildings or centers (Donnan 1995:142, 153; Millaire 2002:169). The Moche buried their dead according to their status and roles during their lifetime and, as such, tools, special insignias and other markers can be used to infer a deceased's biography (e.g., the Priestesses of San Jose de Moro, [Donnan and Castillo 1992; see also Castillo andRengifo 2008]). For instance, women, who are believed to have been typically involved in spinning and weaving activities, are often buried with spindle-whorls and bundles of yarn (Donnan 1995:150). In contrast, men are often buried with weapons or fishing implements associated with their activities. Gen On a more general note, graves usually contain ceramic vessels and gourd containers that were often buried with food and drink. Most burials contained fewer than five ceramic vessels, and those were often paired, materializing concepts of duality (Don nan 1995:143). Other common grave goods include metal objects, usually placed in the mouth, the hands, and sometimes beneath the feet, and plant remains, including maize (Gumerman 1994). Recent research has shed new light on the dynamism of Moche funerary practices, in partic ular delayed burials, grave re-entry, and the manip ulation of human remains (Hill 2003; Millaire 2004; Verano 1998, 2003). Articulation patterns and insect pupae indicate that some corpses were held for long periods of time before being buried (Nelson 1998; Verano 1997a, 2001), and several graves were reopened and tampered with, indicat ing that powerful symbolic meanings were attrib uted to ancestral remains (Hecker and Hecker 1992; Millaire 2004). Death rituals, in particular torture, display and sacrifice, were at the core of Moche religious beliefs (Bourget 2001, 2006). For instance, Hill (2003, 2005) suggests that the bodies of war captives were reassigned into the more symbolically useful cat egory of prisoners in order to feed the institutional demand for public displays of violence, including sacrifice. Prisoners became arenas for spectacle while body parts eventually became relics open to manipulation. The widespread distribution of Moche religious tenets was linked to their potency, the success of their promoters, and the regional need for ritual insignia and paraphernalia (Bawden 2004:124; Donnan 2010:68-69). Indeed, funerary practices and rituals of sacrifice might have well served to bridge the gap at the elite level between various communities. The Moche culture developed between A.D. 1 800 and current evidence suggests the parallel development of several polities based in the Piura, Lambayeque, Jequetepeque and Chicama-Moche to the south (Castillo and Quilter 2010). This new emphasis on stylistic diversity points towards the specificities of the cultural history of each region and the impossibility to apply a single mode of</page><page sequence="5">Chicoine] DEATH AND RELIGION IN THE SOUTHERN MOCHE PERIPHERY 529 development for the Moche world (Shimada 2010). For the Southern Moche world, extending from Chicama in the north to Nepena in the south, peer polities probably negotiated powers and territories, battled among each other and/or forged alliances with groups in different valleys. Members of these polities produced different styles of fine ceramic wares including Moche painted and sculpted pots in the Chicama and Moche valleys, and Viru Neg ative and Huancaco vessels in the Viru Valley (Bourget 2003,2010; Millaire 2009,2010). Mean while, Gallinazo Modeled and Gallinazo Incised ceramics are now seen as part of a long-standing tradition of utilitarian and domestic wares wide spread along the north coast (Donnan 2009:30). Middle period and the limited distribution of Moche materials has been used to argue for a short lived and tenuous occupation limited to the mid dle and lower sections of the valley (Proulx 1982:83). Meanwhile, the upper valley is believed to have been the realm of groups with close con tacts with the highlands, possibly with Recuay related populations. In the lower valley, recent investigations at Huambacho, some 5 km down stream from Panamarca, have yielded the first evi dence from excavated contexts of a Moche presence outside the monumental complex. Con sidering that social identities and roles are blurred through practice and open to manipulation, the remainder of this article investigates patterns of Moche religion and funerary practices from the perspective of a small cemetery at Huambacho. At its peak, Southern Moche influence encom passed several regions, including the Chicama, Moche, Villi, Santa, Nepena, and possibly Casma and Huarmey valleys (Donnan 2010:60-66; Makowski 2010; Pozorski and Pozorski 1996). The mechanisms involved in the coalescence of widely distributed communities are still debated and they are likely linked to unique sets of local historical circumstances. Recent research in Santa, for instance, suggests two major waves of Moche influ ence starting during the fourth century A.D. and lasting probably 300 years (Chapdelaine et al. 2005). Stylistically, the Moche presence in Santa is associated with Middle Moche Phases 3 and 43 ceramics, and constructions at the sites of El Castillo and Guadalupito, respectively (Chapde laine 2010). It is assumed that the spread of Moche styles and materials through local settlements and cemeteries materialized the engagement of local groups with Moche religion, but the integration of Moche influence along the north coast was "not a smooth linear progression or one in which the Moche centered at the site of Moche single-hand edly dictated all major decisions [...] and the process involved many negotiations, conquests, recon quests, and rapprochements between the Moche and local populations" (Shimada 2010:72-73). In Nepena, the Moche influence is associated with the construction of the southernmost Moche monumental site at Panamarca (Schaedel 1951). Valley wide surface surveys, meanwhile, have revealed the existence of 37 Moche sites (Proulx 1982:83), mostly cemeteries located in the vicin ity of Panamarca. Stylistic evidence from surface ceramics appears to date the Moche presence to the Investigations at Huambacho Huambacho is a multicomponent site of the lower Nepena Valley situated 8 km from the shoreline and 65 m asl (Figure 2). The site was first reported by Soriano (1941) and revisited by Proulx (1968:135 137) during his systematic survey of the valley in the 1960s and 1970s. After Soriano, Proulx iden tified Chimu (ca. A.D. 1000-1470) materials, but also suggested an earlier Moche occupation (Proulx 1982:84). Later work indicates that the initial occu pation of Huambacho dates back to the Early Hori zon (Chicoine 2006), but excavations by the Proyecto Huambacho (2003-2004) allowed the dis covery of several Moche graves. Excavation results and ten radiocarbon dates indicate that most structures were built and used between 800 and 200 cal B.C. (2a) (see Chicoine 2010). At that time, Huambacho was organized around two compounds of wall-enclosures. Field work focused on the Main Compound and revealed a complex spatial organization dominated by large sunken plazas and complexes of raised platforms (Figure 3). Following the Early Horizon the site witnessed a series of reoccupations by groups pro ducing Gallinazo Modeled and Gallinazo Incised, Viru Negative, Moche painted and molded, Casma press-molded and Casma incised, and Chimii blackware ceramics. These reoccupations are mainly represented by intrusive grave contexts. The Moche presence is mainly documented by the discovery of several graves at Huaca-A, a com</page><page sequence="6">530 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 San Jacinto* Neperia■ Paiiamarca Tres Marias* .

Additional evidence for a Moche occupation includes objects found at the surface of looted areas. More than 400 pottery frag ments came from the clearing of a looter's pit in the North Sector. Moche style ceramics include various forms such as face necked jars, sculpted lateral-handle bottles, and stirrup-spout bottles. The surface ceramics were decorated using three dimensional techniques complemented by red and white painting, a pattern consistent with the Moche artifacts found in undisturbed grave contexts. A broken jar sculpted in the shape of a toad, very sim ilar to the one from Grave 11 (see below), was dis covered (Figure 4A). The toad is represented with similar morphological attributes (e.g., parotid glands), as well as with a growing maize plant on its body. A small necked jar sculpted in the shape of a human figure with supernatural phytomorphic attributes was also collected. The figure is depicted with six corn cobs placed on both sides of the body and in the back (Figure 4B). The representation emphasizes fertility and closely resembles similar vessels found to the north on which the main Moche ritual actor, the degoUador or throat slaughterer, is associated with maize (Benson 1972:29, Figure 2.4) (Figure Aof the Sacrifice Ceremony; see Don nan 1975). Other anthropomorphic vessels were found at Huambacho (Figure 4C, D, E). Non-ceramic grave goods from this area include a wooden staff in the shape of a fist (Figure 4F), several copper objects, Spondylus shell beads, and bone adornments. The fist-shaped scepter is sym bolically associated with death and authority. It has been suggested that the "half-fist gesture" (Don nan 1978:151), which replicates the stepped appearance of sacred mountains and temples, was used among Moche religious elites, perhaps dur ing special rituals including human sacrifices (Bourget 2006:123). Similar fist-shaped bone and wooden objects have been documented at Moche sites (Benson 1972:110,Figure 5.14). Meanwhile, wooden scepters are known to have been found in higher status burials, notably at Huaca de la Cruz in Viru (Strong and Evans 1952).

Even nowadays local community members bury their deceased in a cemetery south of the Main Compound. Funerary Contexts at Huambacho Excavations at Huambacho allowed the recovery of skeletal remains associated with at least 23 indi viduals in contexts numbered Grave 1 to 17 (Fig ure 3). When multiple skeletons were discovered inside a burial context, a different number was given to each individual (e.g., Grave 11, Individ ual 1) (See Table 1). The grave contexts consist of simple pits excavated directly through Early Hori zon contexts. They were found at a depth ranging between 30 and 175 cm. Data relevant to burial pro cedures and contexts were recorded in situ while a more detailed analysis of the skeletal remains was realized in laboratory facilities in Casma and Nepena (Ancash, Peru)4. The objectives of the funerary and osteological analyses were to acquire biographical information about the life of buried individuals and reconstruct funerary events. The graves are represented by 10 infants and 13 adults. For the adults, sex could be identified with confidence for two females and four males. Of the total human remains excavated, ten individuals are associated with the Moche phase occupation based on the presence of Moche style grave goods and the consistent placement of the body in a north south face-down position. Other graves are inter preted as pre-Moche (Grave 6, 7), post-Moche (Grave 2,3) or unidentified (Grave 1, 17). Offer ing contexts were also excavated including sacri ficed camelids (Grave 4) and dedicatory vessels with foods, and a Viru Negative vessel (Grave 8), further attesting to the sacred importance of the bur ial ground.</page><page sequence="8">532 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 Figure 4.

The cluttered aspect of the burials indi cates a lack of centralized coordination at Huaca boat-shaped necked jar (Figure 5D). The bowl, fired in a reducing atmosphere, was highly polished and reminiscent of some Early Horizon forms. The grave also contains more utilitarian wares includ ing three cooking jars (Figure 5E, F, G), one of which was a broken tripod jar with lateral strap han dle showing carbonized residues (Figure 5E). The disc/plate on which the person was placed (Figure 5H), meanwhile, is reminiscent of the tools used by Andean potters (Ramon 2011:163). A, and the simplicity of the pits, the absence of remains of a coffin (e.g., reeds)5, the location away from residential areas, as well as the quality and quantity of grave goods, all suggest an oppor tunistic cemetery for lower and middle class local folks. Overall, the Huambacho graves compare favorably to lower status burials from Pacatnamu and Huacas de Moche to the north (Chapdelaine 2004; Donnan and McClelland 1997; Tello et al. 2003). Graves exhibit similar general patterns and lit tle variation with respect to basic concepts of funer ary treatment. Corpses were laid out in an extended position with the head to the southwest, pointing towards the Pacific Ocean. This orientation fol lows the layout of Early Horizon structures (N41 °E). The extended position of the Moche phase graves contrast with the contexts of Gallinazo and Viru material (Grave 6 and 7) where bodies were buried in a flexed position. Grave 6, excavated in the south portion of the Huaca-A, contained the remains of a 173 cm tall adult female over 50 years old6. The woman, buried 50 cm below the surface (66.95 m asl), had been placed in a flexed position on her side, with her arms to her face and her head tilted right and tipped forward (Figure 5A). The body was wrapped in a plain weave cotton shroud and accompanied by several grave goods. Six vessels surrounded the body, which was laid on a seventh vessel in the form of a disc/plate. Maize cobs were discovered from one of the vessels, which pro vided a radiocarbon (AMS) date of 1960 ± 40 B.P. (cal 50 B.C.-A.D. 130 (2ct); BETA-197084; maize; Sl3= -10.7). Five gourd containers were also placed inside the grave, along with four spin dle-whorls made of copper (n - 1), ceramic (n = 2), and stone (n = 1). Copper sheets in the fore head (mesofrontal section of the cranium) and the mouth, as well as copper pendant were also recov ered. The cranium was artificially deformed in a fronto-occipital fashion. The vessels are particularly interesting. A large, spherical body, necked jar with a modeled zoomor phic applique suggests some Gallinazo Modeled stylistic affiliations (Figure 5B)7. Grave goods also included an ovoid shape bowl (Figure 5C) and a To the south of Grave 6 at the same depth, Grave 7 contained the looted remains (feet and pelvis) of an adult female of undetermined age and stature buried in a flexed position. The corpse was accom panied by a double-body whistle jar with Viru Neg ative decoration (resist painting) (Figure 6A). Other grave goods included a wooden spindle and a gourd container. The dating of Grave 7 is uncertain, but the discovery of an offering context (Grave 8) con taining a similar Viru Negative whistle jar (Figure 6B) elsewhere at Huaca-A has yielded a radiocar bon date of 1850 ± 60 BP. (cal A.D. 20-340 (2a); BETA-197085; maize; 813=-11.6). Several surface sherds in Viru Negative, but also Gallinazo Mod eled and Gallinazo Incised, have been found at Huambacho. Elsewhere in Nepena, Viru and Gallinazo influ ences have been identified in the vicinity of Pana marca in the middle valley, most notably at Tres Marias (PV31-73) some 5 km to the north of Huam bacho. This site is composed of two platform mounds built with cane-marked adobes, as well as an adjacent cemetery area (Gambini 1983-84:124). More research will be needed to understand the relationship between Gallinazo, Viru, and Moche components in Nepena, but major stylistic and funerary differences can be observed. More specif ically, Gallinazo and Viru deceased are placed in a flexed position while Moche ones are consistently extended and placed on their stomach. Currently chronology remains underdeveloped to allow a clear understanding. The radiocarbon assays reported above place the Gallinazo and Viru styles at Huambacho between 50 B.C. and A.D. 340 (cal 2a), but no dates are available for the Moche component. In Santa to the north, Chapdelaine (2010:260) places the Moche phase between A.D. 300 and 700, which he asso ciates with the stylistic phases 3 and 4.

This assertion awaits a more thorough revision of the validity of that stylistic sequence and the nature of Early Moche phenomenon in Nepena. It would suggest, however, that stylistic and funerary dif ferences resulted from the arrival of Moche influ ences in the region. Conversely,Gallinazo, Viru and Moche distinctive funerary behaviors could have well materialized ethnic, social and/or religious differences at a time of particular political frag mentation. At Huambacho, three undisturbed grave con texts have yielded Moche style artifacts (Grave 10, 11 and 15). Grave 10 was arranged as a simple pit dug some 50 cm deep into the Early Horizon con struction fill at an elevation of 66.90 m asl. It con tained the skeletal remains of a 176 cm tall adult male probably aged between 25 and 30 years (Indi vidual 1). The preservation of the corpse was excel lent and sections of the body were still covered with soft membranes, most notably the hands and feet, which were naturally mummified (Figure 7A). Individual 1 had been wrapped in a plain weave cotton shroud and placed in an extended position (Figure 7B), face down, with his head to the south west. The left hand was placed along the body while the right hand was covering the pelvis under neath the body. The deceased was wearing a cylin drical headdress made of plant fibers. The headdress consists of a band of plant fibers twined using an open cross-warp technique8. The main body of the hat is arranged as a cylinder of four bast rims tied together to the twined body with cot ton yarns. The headdress has a diameter of 26.7 cm at the base and displays a circular opening of 11.5 cm beneath which hair was found bundled up (Figure 7C). The headdress from Grave 10 is rem iniscent of similarly shaped garments made of gilded copper from Dos Cabezas (see Donnan 2007:134, Figure 5.137).</page><page sequence="12">536 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 Grave10,Huambacho(PV31-103),Peru Figure 7.

Individual 1 was buried with grave goods, but no ceramic vessels. Near the head, on the right side, a textile bag was found wrapped in a plain weave cotton cloth (Figure 8A). Coca leaves (Erythroxy lum coca) were found inside the bag along with a small bone spatula made of a camelid metatarsal (Figure 8B). The bag was decorated with brown, beige, red, and black designs forming steps, frets, and concentric crosses. The bag is composed of four pieces: a bottom, an interior wall, a superimposed exterior wall bearing decoration, and a handle stitched to both walls. The exterior presents the most complex techniques and designs. Warp yarns are made of beige cotton, while the weft yarns are made of different materials and colors: brown camelid fibers, beige cotton, and black human hair. Red fibers are only found on the handle. The bag was apparently used to carry coca leaves, perhaps for ritual purposes. Similar bags are depicted in Moche iconography in a scene known as the "Coca Ceremony" (Figure 8C) (Benson 1972:61, Figures 3.17-3.18; Donnan and McClelland 1999:84). As seen in the iconography, coca-chew ing rituals involve the use of bags, probably to carry coca leaves, as well as special spatulas or applica tors used to consume lime (calcium hydroxide), a vital agent in the release of coca alkaloids (Bawden 1996:90,334). The lime is stored in small hand size containers or caleros. Figure 8C illustrates how the bags are carried by the ritual consumers and the way spatulas are brought to the mouth and used to ingest lime. In this scene, it is significant that the bag held by the ritual actor on the right is decorated with designs very similar to those from Grave 10.</page><page sequence="13">Chicoine] DEATH AND RELIGION IN THE SOUTHERN MOCHE PERIPHERY 537 Figure 8. Photograph illustrating (A) the bag and (B) spatula found in Grave 10 at Huambacho; (C) drawing of Coca ceremony scene depicted on a Middle Moche (Phase 4) style stirrup-spout bottle (redrawn from Donnan and McClelland 1999: Figure 4.90); note the special bag held by the individual on the right (inset, upper right) and the spatula taken to the mouth of the actors on the left (inset, upper left). In the Andes, coca represents an important com modity and it is essential to labor and other phys ical endeavors as it reduces fatigue (Allen 1988). In relation to its use by farmers, it has been sug gested that the Moche saw a deep symbolic con nection between coca and maize (Bawden 1996:90), and it is possible that agrarian rituals involved the chewing of coca. It has also been sug gested that coca was used by warriors in order to boost courage prior to battle (Benson 1972:59). At the Moche site of Dos Cabezas in Jequetepeque, Donnan (2007:30-31) has reported the presence of fine, sculpted, necked jars depicting individuals chewing coca and absorbing lime. At Huaca de la Luna in Moche, Uceda et al. (1994) have reported graves of high-ranking males with copper caleros in their hands. Coca typically grows in mid-valley zones, known as yungas, located on the western slopes of the Andes between approximately 500 and 2,300 m asl (Onuki 1985:340). In Nepena, coca would have been cultivated in the upper valley, upstream from the Moro area. Interestingly, the Coca Cere mony scene incorporates elements of coast-high lands interactions. Specifically, the presence of a feline headdress and a weapon bundle that includes a star-shaped mace compare favorably with depic tions of highland-based groups, especially Recuay (Lau 2004:167, Figure 3). The evidence from Grave 10 attests to some form of contact with groups based in the upper valley where coca was grown. Almost 30 years ago, Proulx (1982) suggested that the Nepena Valley was divided into upper and lower valley territories occupied by the Recuay and Moche, respectively. The access and control of coca production and circulation would have played a majorrole in inter-community interactions on the north coast and Grave 10 points toward the poten tial diversity and extent of the geographical con nections of local Huambacho. West of Grave 10, some 40 cm deeper (66.25 m asl), Grave 11 consists of the compound disposal of three individuals: two adults (Individual 1 and 3) and an infant (Individual 2) (Figure 9A). Indi vidual 1, a 174 cm tall male aged between 25 and 30 years at the time of his death, was buried in an</page><page sequence="14">538 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 Figure 9.

His hands had been placed in front of the pelvis under neath the body. The distal phalanges of both mid dle fingers were missing. The legs of Individual 1 had been dismembered beneath the femurs, leav ing the bones of the patella and the lower legs and feet unfound—even though the surrounding areas were systematically excavated. An infant aged between two and four years (Individual 2) was buried behind Individual 1, near his left shoulder. The cranium of Individual 2, per haps due to later disturbances, had rolled towards the right shoulder of Individual 1 .To the north, con sistently aligned with Individual 1, was laid a sec ond adult male aged between 30 and 35 years. Individual 3, who was 174 cm tall, was found in a similar position. This person was placed directly where the lower legs of Individual 1 should have been, in the same orientation (Figure 9B). No cut marks were observed on joints and bone extremi ties. Stone blocks had been placed over the body, perhaps as a grave marker. Compound disposals are common in Moche archaeology, and many scenarios can explain the arrangement of Grave 11. The consistent alignment of Individual 3 with Individual 1, their similar strati graphic position and identical body position all suggest a related, albeit slightly delayed, funerary event. Both corpses were wrapped in plain weave cotton shrouds and the discovery of Moche style ceramics in direct association with Individual 3 suggests that these deceased were inhumed in Moche times. Based on grave goods, Individual 3 might have had a prominent status within the funer ary context. Individual 3 had his arms placed laterally on both sides of his body, with the right in front of his pelvis while his left was in the back. Both hands were tied at the waist with bast fiber cordages (Fig ure 9C). Cordages were also tied around the neck and the ankles. Despite the absence of osteological evidence for perimortem trauma, the neck ligature in particular could point to a death by strangulation (see Verano 2001:165). Although strangulation vic tims often present broken hyoid bones, strangula tion by ligature does not always leave forensic traces (Gagne 2009:211). At Pachacamac, for instance, Uhle (1903) reported female sacrificial victims strangled from behind with cloth ligature and with out any osteological evidence for trauma (Ubelaker 1992; see Verano 2001:168-170). As will be dis cussed below, strangulation by ligature is also hypothesized for Grave 15 at Huambacho. In contrast to Individual 1, Individual 3 was accompanied by grave goods. Two fine Middle Moche style ceramic vessels had been placed near the head: a lateral handle bottle sculpted in the shape of a vulture, probably a condor (Vultur gry phus), and a necked jar with lateral handle in the form of a toad of the Bufo genus as indicated by the curled parotid glands above the eyes (Figure 10A, B) (Bourget 2006:140). On the body of the toad, between the legs, a maize plant with visible cobs was sculpted and painted in white. The vul ture, meanwhile, is recognizable by its diagnostic crest on top of the beak. It is depicted with a ser pent in its claws. Representations of condor are common in Moche religious art, most notably in painted murals and ceramics (Bourget 2006:229, Figure 5.1; Shimada 1994:19, Figure 2.5).They are typically associated with processions of prisoners and human sacrifices (Verano 2001:176). Wooden staffs were also placed on each side of Individual 3, along with gourd containers. The staffs, made of algarrobo (Prosopis pallida) were buried in pristine condition and might have been commissioned especially for the burial. The shape of the gourd containers (Figure 9D), with the han dle, is reminiscent of a canchero, a popular Moche ceramic vessel found in funerary contexts in Santa and elsewhere (Benson 1972:31, Figure 2.5; Chapdelaine et al. 2005:25). The handles of the con tainers were respectively oriented to the north and the south, perhaps to emphasize duality in the same manner as the dual positioning of the wooden staffs. Other grave goods associated with Individual 3 include a spherical gourd container, most likely containing food, body adornments, and copper pieces. Copper objects were found in four places on the deceased. A folded copper sheet in the shape of a spatula, was found inside the left hand. Oppo site, in front of the pelvis, another small copper plate was discovered. Two small copper discs, possibly from a hair tweezer, were wrapped inside a plain weave cloth and placed over the left shoulder of the deceased, and a copper needle was found in association with a small stone with cotton yarns wrapped around it. In addition, the deceased was wearing a necklace made of nacre and Spondylus</page><page sequence="16">540 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 Figure 10.

The placement of grave goods on top of the left scapula parallels the position of the infant over the left shoulder of Individual 1. could have resulted from the individual struggling at the time of death. Overall, the evidence from Grave 15 suggests some form of violent death, exposure of the body, and even eventual torture and/or sacrifice. Directly beneath Grave 11, at 175 cm below the surface, excavations revealed another Moche grave intrusive to Early Horizon refuse strata. The rela tionship between Grave 11 and 15 is uncertain, but it is possible they represent related episodes of a single funerary project as suggested by the identi cal compass orientation of both graves and the strong stylistic and symbolic correspondences in grave goods. The three adults buried in Graves 11 and 15 are males aged between 20 and 35 years. They are unusually tall by Moche standards rang ing between 171 and 174 cm9, which points to eventual kinship ties. Similarly, at Dos Cabezas, Donnan (2007) interprets a group of unusually tall males (175-180 cm) as potentially related. Grave 15 contained the remains of an adult male aged between 25 and 30 years. The deceased, who measured 171 cm, was wrapped in a plain weave cotton shroud and placed in an extended position, face down, with the head to the southwest and slightly turned to the left (east). In contrast to other skeletons from Huambacho, the bones were rela tively clean of soft membranes and mildly sun bleached, suggesting the body was exposed for some time before its final burial.The skeleton was fully articulated, but an unusual anatomical posi tion suggests a special treatment (Figure 11 A). The torso was turned to the left, with the body partly resting on its right side. The feet, meanwhile, were turned to the right (west), giving the overall skele ton a "twisted" appearance. This particular posi tion apparently caused the complete collapse of the thoracic cage as indicated by the ribs, which were found folded and almost parallel to the spine (Fig ure 1 IB). Acotton sash was passed around the neck and tied to a wooden post set into the ground next to the head (Figure 11C). Similar ligatures have been reported in funerary contexts along the coast (e.g.. El Brujo,Pachacamac,Sipan) (Verano 2001: 170). The feet and hands were respectively tied together with bast fibers. Hands were joined together in front of the body, directly beneath the pelvis. As for Individual 3 from Grave 11, the pres ence of neck ligature suggests a death by strangu lation although no skeletal evidence for perimortem trauma could be identified. The twisted position of the skeleton is consistent with this hypothesis and In Moche iconography, one particular type of sacrifice is represented by vultures pecking at tied human figures. It sheds potential light on the atyp ical arrangement of Grave 15. Here, victims— usually males (Bourget 2006:118)—are tied to a post or a rack while turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), black vultures (Coragyps atratus), or even condors (Vultur gryphus) feed on them. Based on the feeding behaviors of black vultures, Bourget (2006:201) suggests that the victims are alive when the birds peel their skin and other soft membranes. One particular bottle (Bourget 2006:189, Figure 4.4) depicts a sculpted male-female couple whose faces are peeled from their head by a vulture. Below the sculpted effigy, there is a fine-line painting of a female with her hands and feet tied. Her facial skin has been peeled away and vultures are feed ing on her. Bourget (2006:119) suggests a symbolic link between individuals with mutilated faces and anal intercourses. In Moche iconography anal and vaginal intercourse are typically contrasted by prone and supine positions, respectively. This bod ily inversion, perhaps significantly, could be related to the special status and position of the Huamba cho deceased. The person in Grave 15 was buried with several grave goods, which contrasts with the inferred low to middle status of most Huambacho graves. Here, the grave goods could have emphasized the sym bolic importance of the rituals rather than the sta tus of the deceased. Verano (2001) reports on a similar scenario at the Chimu site of Manchan in the Casma Valley. Here, an individual inteipreted as a sacrificial victim was found with a rope around his neck along with several grave goods. Verano (2001:169) suggests that the grave goods, in that case, should not be interpreted as indicators of the status of the victim, but rather as related to the importance of the ritual itself. In Grave 15, a copper plate was placed in the mouth (Figure 11D), on the lower left side between the gum and the cheek. Additional folded sheets of copper were encountered in the right hand (n = 2), in the neck, and underneath the right foot (n = 1). Several copper pieces were also recovered in the</page><page sequence="18">542 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 Figure 11.

The skeleton was accompanied by a necked jar sculpted in the form of a toad reminiscent of the jar from Grave 11 (Figure IOC). White designs were painted on the red paste background to represent the toad's morphological features. The vessel was placed near the head, to the left of the wooden post. A jet mir ror was placed in the back of the deceased, along side a spherical gourd container and square-shaped cover. The gourd was probably used for food or drink as indicated by the organic residues inside the gourd. Beneath the mirror was found a small polisher made of white stone. An additional pol isher made of green stone was discovered in the back of the deceased, near the shoulders. Such pol ishers were typically used in the burnishing of ceramics. The person was also wearing a trape zoidal-shaped shell pendant, recycled from a more elaborate pectoral adornment as indicated by the presence of previous support holes. To summarize, Gallinazo, Viru, and Moche phase bodies from Huambacho were wrapped in one or more shrouds in simple pits dug directly through Early Horizon structures and refuse deposits. Coffins or more elaborate structures such as funerary chambers have not been documented. Gallinazo and Viru contexts contrast with Moche ones, especially with respect to body position. Three intact graves have yielded Moche style arti facts . The presence of coca in one grave suggests some connections with the upper valley and even tually the adjacent highlands. The compound dis posal of two or three individuals points toward complex funerary rituals and some form of social ties between the deceased interred at Huaca-A. Meanwhile, the consistency visible in the posi tioning of bodies face down, with the face some times turned left (to the east), is atypical by Moche standards and indicates the special status of the deceased. The eventual torture and strangulation of certain individuals is a good indicator of the spe cial treatment received by some of the Huambacho deceased. Discussion Very little is known of Moche funerary customs in the southern periphery (Kaulicke 2000:238) and the data presented in this article raise a number of ques tions related to the membership and identity of the deceased and the symbolic meaning of the funer ary events. The Huambacho data indicate the exis tence of a small cemetery ground in use intermittently during the first and second millen nia A.D. This contribution has focused on graves dated to the Early Intermediate Period and attrib uted to low to middle status Gallinazo, Viru, and Moche groups based on diagnostic grave goods. The Moche graves contrast with Gallinazo and Viru contexts. The latter, currently dated to 50 B.C. A.D. 340, are preliminarily interpreted as earlier than Moche contexts based on comparative evi dence from the neighboring Santa valley to the north (Chapdelaine 2010). Based on stylistic evi dence, the Moche materials pertain to the Middle Period (A.D. 300-800). It is uncertain where this Moche community was established. Some limited evidence of domes tic reoccupations has been identified at the Main Compound at Huambacho,but it is more likely that the local population lived in nearby settlements. A good candidate would be the site of La Huaca (PV31-143), a small adobe mound located 2 km west of Huambacho where Proulx identified post Moche components (Proulx 1973:164—165). The mound still awaits excavations, but surface obser vations by the Proyecto Huambacho have revealed rectangular adobes and redware ceramics that are both typical, although not exclusive, to the Moche. The patterns of visual arts and mortuary sym bols with which Moche groups engaged differ from local Gallinazo and Viru standards. A salient dif ference resides in the placement of the Moche phase bodies in an atypical, extended, face-down posi tion . Whi le the extended position, orientation of the body, encasing of the corpse, and the grave goods are consistent with practices widespread at Moche sites to the north, the burying face-down is not. The tying-up and possible death by strangulation of two individuals in Grave 11 (Individual 3) and Grave 15 further point towards the special nature of the cemetery and status of the deceased. Symbolically, the face-down position can carry different meanings. Rowe (1995:28) assigns face down positions with the head turned to one side to a sleeping position, but it could also represent an inversion of basic precepts of appropriateness. For example, Hill (2003:287) suggests that prisoners in Moche iconography are depicted upside-down to emphasize status reversal. On the North Coast, face</page><page sequence="20">544 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 down burial positions have been interpreted from that standpoint and associated with executions, sac rifices, and violent deaths. At Pacatnamu, a Middle Moche site in Jequetepeque, individuals found face down have been interpreted as retainers and human offerings (Hecker and Hecker 1983:389-391). Their role appears to have been to accompany important individuals in the afterlife. At Cerro Lampay, in the Fortaleza Valley, Vega-Centeno et al. (2006) have reported violent deaths in the form of two intrusive Late Intermediate Period burials. Here, individuals were buried face down in an extended position. One adult male had his hands tied and mouth gagged, while another showed evidence of perimortem occipital trauma. The Cerro Lampay graves were set in improvised shallow pits and no grave goods accompanied the victims. Moche death ideology was engineered as part of elite strategies with the objectives of promoting local interests and extending these to a wider com munity (Bawden 2004:119). It has been proposed that one of the central mechanisms for the expan sion of Moche religio-political power was related to the perception of their religious and ritual pro grams as successful liturgical tools. Conversely, a powerful incentive to acquire Moche ritual objects was the need to personify ritual actors during spe cific liturgical performances (e.g., San Jose de Moro contexts: see Castillo and Rengifo 2008; Donnan 2010; Donnan and Castillo 1992). At the Moche site of Dos Cabezas in the Chi cama Valley, Tomb 2 is interpreted by Donnan (2007:65) as the sacrifice of a 15 year-old female, who was found in a face-down position with no sign of violent death. At the site of El Castillo in the Santa Valley, excavations have yielded a series of Early Intermediate Period individuals buried face down (Gagne 2009). Several skeletons show signs of perimortem violence including decapitation and cerebral trauma (e.g., Burial 1 and 9). Other face down burials indicate postmortem skeletal manip ulation including decapitation (e.g., Burial 27) (Gagne 2009:212-213). The El Castillo contexts were devoid of any grave goods. In contrast, the Huambacho graves contained elaborate goods that point towards the symbolic importance of the rit uals over the status of the deceased or victim. The face-down burial type materializes the spe cial status of the group buried at Huambacho. Fur ther, it suggests an intricate relation to Moche funerary ideology and an inversion of Moche pre cepts potentially embedded in the relationships between local lower Nepena populations and the broader Southern Moche world. The occurrence of eventual torture spectacles and human sacrifices are consistent with this hypothesis. Such death rituals could have materialized the social and political ten sions associated with the arrival of Moche influ ence in the region. In itself, the placement of the cemetery on an ancestral hill (Huaca-A) could attest to an attempt at incorporating foreign precepts and/or members into the local sacred landscape, and vice versa. Moche religious ideology was centered on con cepts of sacrifice and offerings ultimately effective in stimulating agricultural fertility and the produc tion of marine resources. In conjunction with this complex of rituals, the Moche phase corresponds to important developments in irrigation networks and increased agricultural potential in many regions of the north coast (see Billman 2010; Castillo 2010; Chapdelaine 2010 for Moche, Jequetepeque, and Santa, respectively). In Santa, research indicates that the arrival of the Moche influence coincided with the extension of irrigation canals to the Lacra marca drainage, underdeveloped by local groups prior to Moche times (Chapdelaine et al. 2005:18; Wilson 1988:336). The local integration of Moche religious ideas was situated within this historical context and possibly negotiated based on increased agricultural productivity and other social and eco nomic advantages. Current evidence is insufficient to assess the possible increase in harvest production associated with the arrival of Moche influence in Nepena, but variables such as interactions with the neighboring highlands, the control over trade routes, and the need to acquire more diverse resources are also likely to have played roles in the Moche influence in the region (Lau 2004; Shimada 1994:88-91). In Santa and Nepena, Moche monumental ceremonial centers were strategically built adjacent to local centers of power (Chapdelaine et al. 2005; Schaedel 1951), suggesting that one of the strategies was to promote religious beliefs and rituals. In Nepena, the analysis ot grave contexts from Huambacho brings insights into the degree and ways in which local people in the periphery of Panamarca engaged with Moche religious customs. Combined with recent data from other sites from</page><page sequence="21">Chicoine] DEATH AND RELIGION IN THE SOUTHERN MOCHE PERIPHERY 545 the Southern Moche world, funerary practices point towards diversity in patterns of articulation between Moche and local religious precepts (Chapdelaine et al. 2009; Gagne 2009).

Thanks also ought to be extended to the LAA editorial board and review ers for their constructive comments. Conclusions The Huambacho data provide a preliminary basis upon which to assess religious ideology and death rituals in the Southern Moche world. The nature and extent of the Moche presence in Nepena is still unclear, and our understanding will undoubtedly rely on the systematic investigation of the monu mental complex of Panamarca. Nevertheless, results of the Huambacho research bring initial insights from excavated contexts and highlight the complexity of the Moche occupation in the region. The interactions between different social groups and communities were likely structured by a series of factors including alliances, peer-polity interac tions, technological innovations, and religious ide ology as important variables. The research suggests the existence of a special burial ground for local community members, including possible sacrificial victims. The pre dominance of the face-down position certainly materializes the special status of the deceased while the rituals surrounding sacrificed bodies and the inclusion of Moche offerings and symbols could have acted as spectacles. Meanwhile, the funerary symbolism, in particular the presence of coca in Grave 10, and the emphasis on agricultural fertil ity and sacrifice in Grave 15, provides promising avenues through which to research the social and religious environments in the Southern Moche dui - ing the two or three centuries of Moche influence, including coast-highland relationships, the negoti ation of territorial arrangements, and the impor tance of agrarian production. Investigations in the southern Moche periphery are in their infancy and this article has highlighted the importance of the Nepena Valley. It attests to the fluidity of religion and social identities in a period of changing socio historical structures. Acknowledgments.

Smithson ian Institution Press, Washington, D.C. Notes 1. This contrasts with funerary traditions from the Andean highlands where corpses are usually wrapped in a flexed position and placed in above-ground mortuary monuments known as chullpas (Rowe 1995:28). 2. In order to minimize terminological ambiguities, this article follows the terminology proposed by Sprague (2005) for the archaeological description of grave contexts. 3. Traditionally, Moche chronological studies have been relying on a five-phase sequence based on the stylistic evolu tion of stirrup-spout bottles (Larco 1948). Recent advances, especially in the northern Moche realm, have highlighted the limitations of this division and popularized the use of a tri partite division into Early, Middle and Late phases (Castillo and Donnan 1995). In the Southern Moche region, those cor respond to Phases 1-2, 3-4 and 5, respectively. 4. Original osteological analyses realized by the author in Casma in 2004 and complemented by the expertise of Ginesse Listi based on photographic materials in Baton Rouge in 2009. Emily Grace re-analyzed first-hand the remains in Nepena in 2010 and provided the final estimations for age, sex and stature. 5. This contrasts with later Chimu graves excavated inside the sunken plazas that made use of cane coffins (Grave 2 and 3). 6. Age estimations for adults are mainly based on the degree of closure of the several palatal sutures (incisive, interpalatine, intermaxillary, palatomaxillary), pubic symph ysis and dental usewear. Stature estimations are based on Genoves (1967) formula for Mesoamerica. 7. It is possible that the vessel also share stylistic affini ties with the Tablada style from the central coast (see Makowski 2002:98, Figure 4.8). 8. The analysis of the hat associated with Individual 1 in Grave 10 was realized by Charles Perreault. 9. Verano (1994, 1997b) estimates that Moche stature at Pacatnamii typically ranges between 139 and 156 cm for females (it = 146.8 cm), and 148 and 169 cm (x= 157.6 cm) for males.
