<plain_text><page sequence="1">La Poesia mitica de Federico Garcia Lorca. By GUSTAVO CORREA. ("University of Oregon Publications.") Eugene, Ore.: University of Oregon, 1957. Pp. 174. This detailed study by Gustavo Correa of a large portion of the work of Federico Garcia Lorca is primarily one of interpretation. And precisely in this fact is to be found its most important contribution to the Lorca bibliog- raphy, since there have been relatively few previous attempts to analyze his poetry at such length. Correa's book is not destined to increase our knowledge of Lorca the person, but rather of Lorca the artist. Nor is it literary history but painstaking internal analysis of the work of art. Correa is not writing for the casual reader but clearly for one well informed in contemporary Spanish literature and natural- ly in the work and background of Lorca him- self. It is refreshing not to find here the so often repeated pronouncements about the poet. The book is happily free of anecdotes and exterior happenings. Furthermore, there is a felicitous absence of rhetoric about Lorca and his value as a poet. It is not the intention of Correa to write a panegyric. Analysis takes precedence over evaluation. Certainly on one occasion at least he does state that the Llanto represents the high point in his evolution as a poet (p. 168), but no one can take serious exception to this fact. The reader notes im- mediately the prudence and laudable lack of aggressiveness with which Correa faces his task. In view of its interpretive nature, the book will be open to comment naturally enough, but we feel that Correa has added substantially to the comprehension of the poetry of Garcia Lorca. The book under review is divided into six major chapters, so numbered, each of which bears the title of the work to be studied: Poema del cante jondo (pp. 6-21), Romancero gitano (pp. 22-53), Bodas de sangre (pp. 54-79), Yermra (pp. 80-99), Llanto por Ignacio Sdnchez Mejias (pp. 100-113), and Poeta en Nueva York (pp. 114-54). A short introduction (pp. 1-5) and a rather longer series of conclusions (pp. 155-74) complete the volume. Although Correa recognizes his marked debt to the philosopher Ernst Cassirer in the initial pages of his study, a fuller comprehension of the individual chapters might have been enhanced at a first reading if some of the theoretical considerations about myth and symbolic forms had been briefly anticipated in his intro- duction. It should immediately be noted to Correa's credit that he has intelligently chosen to take into consideration two of the major plays of Lorca and thus does not fall into the fallacy of separating the two genres insofar as Lorca is concerned. Throughout the examination of this highly representative selection of works, certainly culminating moments of his poetic genius, Correa proposes a structural analysis of each, in order to enrich our aesthetic appreciation of the author. At the same time he wishes to establish the basic source of inspiration and to characterize the form into which this primary impulse is finally shaped. A consequence of this original attitude on the critic's part has been the resulting treatment of the mythical aspects of the works themselves. In the vari- ous collections of poems Correa finds a basic unity which justifies their consideration as homogeneous units. And above these minor unities of form and inspiration he further en- counters a larger, over-all unity of conception and vision of reality: namely, a mythical con- cept of the world. Despite a few scattered and fragmentary allusions to this aspect of Lorca's poetry in previous critics, this is the first systematic and extensive study of its kind. After identifying the motif of tensi6n as fundamental in the Poema del cante jondo and studying this atmosphere primarily caused by the ever present threat of sudden and violent death as revealed both linguistically (themes, metaphors, symbols) and also musically (chap. i), Correa gives in chapter ii a highly satisfactory explanation of the Romancero gitano. The most characteristic aspect of the majority of these exquisite ballads, according to Correa, is the continual fusion and interac- tion of two planes of reality. One is human and based on a possible anecdote; the other, created by the poet, is mythical and imagina-</page><page sequence="2">216 BOOK REVIEWS tive. Correa shows with precision how these two "realities" are blended and how there is also an uninterrupted continuity between the human and cosmic elements, which in their turn influence human destiny directly. The ex- terior event, transformed into poetry, gains its lyric qualities by being projected into a world of myth. In my opinion this quality would tend to reaffirm the universality of Lorca, whose poetry has been criticized by some as being local and limited in nature. In accordance with his main thesis, Correa does not fail to point out the unreal overtones of mystery, fascination, and magic which pervade the romances. It occurs to me also that the basic premises of this chapter might be even further substantiated, if necessary, by added reference to statements by Lorca himself re- garding lo gitano in this particular collection of poems. The two central chapters (iii and iv) are devoted, respectively, to the analysis of the mentioned Lorca tragedies. Correa not only considers in detail the many symbolic implica- tions of both plays, which reaffirm the relation between man and the cosmos, but also studies the structure, function, and ritualism of the lyric songs within each. The treatment of Bodas de sangre stresses, in addition to in- evitable fate and passion as essential elements of the play, the symbolic identification of La Madre and the earth in virtue of their mutual power of reproduction. The dominant theme of Yerma is, of course, the sterility of the pro- tagonist, who cannot thus participate in her normal function within a total harmony of the universe. When Correa studies Yerma's con- cept of honor, which prevents her from break- ing tradition despite her own maternal long- ings, he points out how it differs from the ex- terior, social concept of honor to which her husband is bound. The ensuing exegesis of the Llanto (chap. v) interprets the elegy as being a ritualistic cere- mony of cosmic proportions executed before mythical divinities of mythical figures (p. 113). Here Correa observes, in his analysis of the rhythmical and stylistic aspects of the poem, how all the elements, both cosmic and human, collectively converge in a determined place and moment to witness the ceremony. Certain- ly, Poeta en Nueva York (chap. vi) is one of the most difficult books of Lorca and also one somewhat neglected, consequently, by former critics. Although Correa takes into account the radical difference that exists between this work and those previously studied, he still considers it to be an integral part of Lorca's poetry and not merely a disconnected par- enthesis in his total production. Poeta en Nueva York reflects a negative and tortured world of chaos and destruction and, according to the critic, represents the antimythical phase of his poetry. Even though there is a systematic sacrifice of the affirmative mythical vision, a sacrifice consummated by the negative ele- ments of the poems, the highly personal sym- bols, however, still bear a close relationship to myth. Their analysis serves, moreover, to de- limit the exploitation of myth in his other works. This is the most extensive chapter of the book. As such, it is a significant contribu- tion to the understanding of these difficult poems, and Correa has with great penetration explained the symbolism of the negative forces of ruin and catastrophe in relation to the unity he finds in Lorca's concept of the uni- verse. The well-organized final conclusions, which incorporate frequent references to Cassirer and cultural anthropologists, define mythical thinking and point out the char- acteristic relation to the primitive as opposed to a more logical and rational attitude. Correa again ties in briefly with myth in general many aspects of Lorca's poetry already studied (continuity between man and the cosmos, anthropomorphism, ritualism, archetypes, etc.) and reaffirms how mythical thinking implies the poetic and metaphorical, although he is careful not to identify completely myth and poetry. Finally, then, Correa finds in his study that a mythical vision of the world is a permanent characteristic of Lorca's poetry. Moreover, this attitude determines structure, symbols, and images in his work and, in so doing, afford us a key to its true interpretation. This is not just another book on Lorca but rather a worthy contribution to the bibliography of a significant poet. ALLEN W. PHILLIPS University of Chicago</page></plain_text>
