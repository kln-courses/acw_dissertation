Yizraeli-Noy: The Human Figure in Prehistoric Art in the Land of Israel, Israel Museum and the Israel Exploration Society, Jerusalem, 1999 (Hebrew). 158 pages. ISBN 965-278-180-0 (paperback). Reviewed by Y. Garfinkel, Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. This well illustrated publication, which appeared after the untimely death of Dr. Tamar Yizraeli-Noy, presents her life-long interest in the symbolic expressions of prehistoric cultures in general, and in anthropomorphic figurines in particular. Noy served at the Israel Museum as the curator for prehistory, from the founding of the museum in the mid-1960's till her retirement in the early 1990's. During some 30 years she organized the prehistoric exhibit in Israel's most prestigious museum, while conducting her own excavations, usually at Neolithic sites. The work brought her in close contact with everyone who dealt with prehistoric research in Israel: professional archaeologists in the universities and the Israel Antiquities Authority; numerous local museums, located all over Israel (usually representing small surface collections made by local farmers) and even the antiquities market with its dealers and private collectors. This position enabled her to acquire access to a large number of published and unpublished objects. Equipped with all this knowledge, she created for us the first systematic representation of almost all known prehistoric anthropomorphic figurines, statues, masks and plastered skulls in the somewhat elusive geographical term " The Land of Israel". This publication is organized in the format of an exhibit catalogue, although no such exhibit ever materialized. Yael Israeli, who took upon herself the task of bringing the manuscript to the press, wrote a short foreword. This is followed by Noy's original foreword and then a preface. Anna Belfer-Cohen wrote a general introduction to the Natufian culture, and Avi Gopher wrote a general introduction to the Neolithic period. The book is organized in six parts. The introduction includes five short sections. The 135 items are presented in great detail. These details include size, verbal description, photos (usually black and white, seldom in color), and in a few cases line drawings as 227</page><page sequence="2">228 book reviews well. Comparative material from all over the Near East is also incorporated, either as photos or drawings. In order to differentiate between these parallels and the actual catalogue items the comparative material is marked with white numbers inside black squares. The reader should be aware of that double numbering system. The first chapter deals with figurines. This is the largest part of the work, including 114 items out of the entire catalogue of 135 (85%). It starts with a general discussion on figurines, their meaning, function and use in the relevant periods. Such discussions appear at the beginning of each of the following chapters, on statues, masks and plastered skulls. The first item in the catalogue is the enigmatic worked basaltic tuff-pebble from the lower Paleolithic site of Berekhat Ram, dated to earlier than 230,000 years ago. Various scholars have discussed this artifact recently, and it is quite clear that it bears intentional human engravings (Goren-Inbar and Peltz 1995; Marshack 1997; d'Errico and Nowell 2000). However, a major question remains to be answered - was it meant to represent a human figure at its time, or does it look like a figurine only to our modern eye? After a gap of at least 240,000 years, human representations appear in the archaeological record in larger numbers, and without further gaps. From the Natufian culture, 10th-8th millennia BC, seven items are presented (Nos. 2-8). From the 8th millennium BC, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A period, 12 items are included (Nos. 9-20), most of them unearthed in Noy's own excavations at Nahal Oren and Gilgal. From the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period, of the 7th millennium BC, 18 artifacts are included (No. 21-38). From the 6th millennium BC, the Pottery Neolithic period, 64 artifacts are presented (Nos. 39-103), almost all of them from sites of the Yarmukian culture, and most of them are from the site of Sha'ar Hagolan (49 artifacts, about one third of all the items in this catalogue). In the excavations conducted at this site in the course of the last 11 years, many more clay and stone figurines have been uncovered, and the corpus of anthropomorphic representations from this site documents over 200 items. This specific site produced more figurines then all other Natufian and Neolithic sites put together. From the 5th millennium BC, mainly from sites of the Wadi Rabah culture (late Pottery Neolithic period in Noy's terminology, Early Chalcolithic according to other scholars) 13 artifacts are included (Nos. 104-116). This section of the work is of special interest since to date hardly any art objects have been reported from Wadi Rabah contexts. Noy demonstrated that in this period figurines clearly continued to be used as an important aspect of the material culture. She also noticed a Halafian influence on the iconography of some of these figurines. I would like to make some comments on the following specific artifacts: Items 2-3. These are engraved limestone pebbles from the Natufian site of Eynan. They are commonly interpreted as human heads. However the incised pattern is quite similar</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 229 to the Ain Sakhri pebble that depicts two figures in copulation (Item 8). Since the Ain Sakhri item has no clear context, its dating to the Natufian is not clear. But if the two artifacts from Eynan represent the same motif they can be used as chronological anchors for the dating of the Ain Sakhri item. Items 33. This is a Pre-Pottery Neolithic B clay statue discovered by Gerstang in Jericho in 1935, but was not actually published till now. As such, it would be better presented with the statues in Chapter 2 and not among the figurines of Chapter 1. This item, together with plastered skull No. 132, are the earliest examples of the so-called "coffee-bean-eye" motif which later spread over vast areas of the ancient Near East and southeast Europe. Item 38. This is a small fragment of a greenstone-polished axe from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B Site of Munhata. In my personal examination of the object I found it not to display characteristics of a figurine. The so-called eyes are very thin and shallow scars, which apparently represent use wear. Item 41. This is a seated clay figurine from Kefar Gileadi, with no clear information on its dating, since the excavation remained unpublished. This item is related by Noy to the Pottery Neolithic Period. However, stylistically it resembles the seated clay figures of Tel Aswad of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period (de Contenson 1983, Fig. 7). In these items the figures are represented with large breasts supported by both hands. In addition there is no indication for a garment, which usually characterizes Yarmukian figurines. The second chapter deals with statues, all of them from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period (Nos. 115-120). Here the famous head from Garstang's excavations at Jericho is presented together with five small fragments from Nahal Hemar Cave. As the geographical horizon of the work excludes Jordan, the rich collection of such statues from 'Ain Ghazal has not been included. Thus the fascinating phenomenon of nearly life size human figures in the Neolithic period is only partly presented. The third chapter deals with masks, all of them dated to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period (Nos. 121-127). In addition to the well-known masks from Khirbet Doma, Nahal Hemar Cave, and an item of unknown origin, now on exhibit in Paris, three items are published here for the first time (Nos. 123, 126-127). They are of unknown origin, from an anonymous private collection. Two of these masks are complete and one seems to be still in preparation. In addition two other stone masks are mentioned in the text, but are not included in the catalogue: the Er-Ram mask and a broken fragment from the excavations of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B site of Basta in Jordan. All the masks are made of limestone. All the complete ones have two large rounded holes for the eyes. Another hole represents the mouth, which is sometimes depicted with emphasized teeth. On the periphery of each mask a series of small holes can be seen. It seems that</page><page sequence="4">230 book reviews the masks were used in ceremonies, as the eye holes enable seeing, the mouth enables breathing and speaking, and the peripheral small holes helped fix the mask to the human head. Why have most of the masks come from the antiquities market and site surfaces, and only three were discovered in proper excavations? Is this no more than mere luck? It seems to me that it is more an indication that the intensive plundering of antiquities, traditionally concentrating on Biblical and classical sites, is now also taking place with relation to prehistoric remains. The fourth and last chapter deals with plastered and decorated skulls. It begins with a general discussion of the phenomenon, and then presents eight specific skulls from the following sites: Beisamoun (No. 128), Kefar Hahoresh (No. 129, with the text written by the excavator, Nigel Goring-Morris), Jericho (Nos. 130-133) and Nahal Hemar Cave (Nos. 134-135). In this case all the items have been previously published and they all came from well-known sites. The last section of the publication includes a list of footnotes, abbreviations, references to the illustrations and a rich bibliography. No general discussion or evaluation of this rich collection of data is given. These are found at the beginning of each chapter. Probably many things can be said as a summery to the artistic tradition of the Natufian and Neolithic periods, but I would like to emphasize the following aspect. It is clear that the objects in the catalogue can be subdivided into two main groups, based on their size. On the one hand there are small anthropomorphic figurines, usually smaller than 10 cm. These were probably used by individuals and reflect household cults. On the other hand there are the larger items: statues, masks and plastered skulls, usually artifacts larger than 20 cm. These were used on more public occasions and apparently reflect rituals performed on the community level. The items in the second category are all dated to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period, which was a formative era for the art and cult of the ancient Near East (Garfinkel 1994, 1998). When gender is introduced to this division, it is interesting to note that most of the small figurines are female, while the big items have no specific gender characteristics. Is it possible that the big items represent male figures? If so, the community rituals were more male oriented ceremonies (either with male participants, or worshiping male gods) while the household cult were more female oriented ceremonies (either with female participants, or worshiping goddesses). Certainly Noy's publication is a most welcome contribution to art history of the Natufian and Neolithic cultures from the 12th to the 5th millennia BC. By placing together old and new data Noy creates a fascinating picture. It is the only work where the reader can get all this wealth of information together, and will certainly become the basic reference book for all further studies. An English translation of this study is a desideratum. It is a great pity that Noy herself did not live to see the fruit of her labor.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 231 REFERENCES de Contenson H. 1983. Early agriculture in Western Asia.
