This article shows how Philo often quotes Homer, but also Hesiod, Solon, Pindaros and Theognis. He knows the poets as well any Greek writer. In most cases, Philo quotes the verses exactly as we have them from other sources, preserving all the dialectic peculiarities. However, he may correct the quo tation theologically, make a mistake or drop a line, and sometimes he might have learned a text that differed from ours. He often cleverly gives the words a new sense and makes them speak for his own view, following the manner of the Stoics. Philo's works allow us a glimpse the learned circles of the Alexandrian Jews. Philo had memorized poets in gymnasium. He hardly lost the contact to them after his early years, but allowed them to entertain him and his friends during his lifetime. Keywords Philo, poets, Homer, libraries, education The early Jewish world produced many learned men, of whom we know very little. We can only regret, for example, that mere fragments of Aristo bulus' works remain. The few lines we have from him attest to the fact that he had acquired a thorough Jewish and Greek education in Egypt. Aristo bulus' successor, Philo of Alexandria, however, wrote a large number of works, and happily we have enough of them to investigate his world and ideals. If there are serious gaps in his [sc. Philo's] scholarship, they inhere rather in the Judaic side of his training, where he is almost totally reliant on Greek translations of the Bible.1 " David Winston, Philo of Alexandria: The Contemplative Life, the Giants, and Selections. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2010 DOI: 10.1163/157006310X488034</page><page sequence="2">302 Ε. Koskenniemi / Journal for the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 301-322 The view that Philo was well educated in the Greek culture does not surprise anyone,2 although the fact is not always noted, as it should be. Philo uses a nice allegory to illuminate why Greek education should be acquired:3 Abraham had his own wife Sarah and her maidservant Hagar, and children from both. Similarly, two kinds of education exist. TheTorah teaches the proper wisdom and it is every man's duty to seek children from this wife. It is, however, not useless to beget children also from the maid servant, that is, from the Greek culture.4 Philo indeed had children from both, and his works include numerous quotations of Greek poets. Everyone who often quoted or referred to ancient writers revealed his view on Greek culture. Especially the role that Greek poets played in the works of Jewish authors is very interesting, because even a part of the Greek tradition was very critical of them, and for example, Plato was willing to expel the poets from his ideal city. However, Homer and other poets were an essential part of the Greek education. It is very interesting to see, for Translation and introduction by David Winston (The Classics of Western Spirituality; London: SPCK, 1981), 3. 21 The major study still remains Isaac Heinemanns Philons griechische undjiidische Bildung (Breslau: Marcus, 1932; repr.

Runia, Philo of Alexandria and the Timaeus of Plato (Philosophia Anti qua 44; Leiden: Brill, 1986). 31 This was a burning question in Alexandria: it was impossible to become an official with out a good education. Philo, worried about the motives of his fellow Jews, applied a well-known Hellenistic allegory to the suitors of Penelope: it was possible to seek an educa tion from wrong motives. Philo applies this view to sacred history and to the relation between Abraham and Sarah / Hagar, see Peder Borgen, "Philo: Survey of Research since World War II," ANRW2.21.1: 98-154, esp. 116-17. 4) On the propedeutic value of a Greek education, see De congressu eruditionis gratia·, Intro duction, traduction et notes par Monique Alexandre (Les Oeuvres de Philon d' Alexandrie 16; Paris: Cerf, 1967), 48-72.</page><page sequence="3">Ε.

But how much did Philo know poets and how was his manner to quote and refer to them? As David Runia writes, we do not have a compre hensive index of Philo's explicit quotations of and allusions to Greek lit erature.6 According to Samuel Sandmel, Philo quotes fifty-four classical authors,7 and Birnbaum speaks of "well over 50 Greek writers."8 The regis ters prepared by Johannes Leisegang for Cohn's edition9 and the editors of the LCL are incomplete, especially because Philo does not always name his source, even if he happens to directly quote a classical author. The only method is to go ad fontes, of course, also with help of the registers. I have elsewhere10 presented how Philo used the works of the Greek dramatists. In this article I deal with the rest of the Greek poets as an aid in defining Philo's attitude towards Greek culture. I will briefly present the passages in which Greek poets are mentioned or quoted in Philo's text. This should result in an illuminating view of his cultural ideals. But where had Philo learned to know poets and how did he work when he referred to Greek poets? Did he have a private library or did he have permission to use the great library in Alexandria? What we know of the Greek school system has been thoroughly investigated by Henri Marrou and recently updated and completed by Teresa Morgan.11 Although former scholars intended to over-emphasise a curricular aspect and several details may still be sub iudice, features important to the present article are obvious.

Koskenniemi /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 301-322 very beginning and it went on as long as instruction was given. This is clearly the main source of Philo's quotations. When quoting Homer, he had no need to go to the bookshelf, laboriously open a scroll, and check the text—the verses flow spontaneously, and he quotes because he likes to quote and to show his education. In his famous letter Claudius denied access to gymnasiums by the Jewish population in Alexandria (41 C.E.), showing that it had been possible earlier, that is, when Philo was in his early years.12 But Greek poets hardly belonged to Philo's past exclusively. We happen to know how poetry lived in Classical Rome, and the situation in the wealthy circles of Alexandria was hardly different. Great poets and singers visited banquets in Augustan Rome and presented their own verses (Hor ace, Sat. 1.3.1; cf. atria magna colam as a profession, Martial 3.38), but Classical texts were presented publicly, too. Cornelius Nepos notes that every slave in Titus Pomponius Atticus house was able to read literature publicly (Nepos, Atticus 13-14), attesting to the strong role of Classical literature at banquets. Martial's passages attest to the fact that wealthy Romans had their own libraries and completed them regularly (1.2; 1.70; 1.117). But we know that many rulers had a library in their palaces already in the sixth century, and the tradition went on into the Hellenistic period. These libraries were open only for experts, but schools collected books from Aristotle's times onwards already, and gymnasiums usually had a collection of books. The first public library in Rome was founded in 39 B.C.E., and we know of great collections, for example, in Pergamum.13 Not one of the ancient libraries, however, could compete with the treasures of the Alexan drian library. But undoubtedly Philo had a private library, and it is not too bold to claim that he enjoyed its treasures with his friends, that is, learned fellow Jews and Gentiles leaning to Judaism. At least, he did not hesitate to visit Greek theatre and was impressed by Euripides' tragedy (Prob. 141), although Palestinian Jews disliked Herod's theatre in Jerusalem {Ant. 15-267-268, 274-275). 121 On the education in Alexandria and religious problems connected with it, see Borgen, Pbilo,Pbilo, 252-59; Sandelin, "The Danger of Idolatry," 126-29; John J.

Koskenniemi / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 41 (2010) 301-322 305 Homer No poet was honoured like Homer in the Classical world.14 His unique position meant, however, that criticism of poets and their world, in gen eral, but also specifically, targeted Homer and his works.15 The Greek world thus offered two paths, praise and criticism, and early Jewish writers used both.16 Sibylline Oracles 3.419-434 was especially critical, and there were others sharing this view. However, Aristobulus17 cited Homer to attest the wisdom of Jews, using a Jewish-Pythagorean source early on,18 and appar ently Philo, when referring to "quarrelsome" exegetes (Mut. 60) meant Jews who used to apply the methods of Homeric exegesis to interpretation of the Scripture.19 What can we say about Philo? Philo quotes Homer often, spontaneously and eagerly. It is not reason able to quote all the passages in detail and to compare Philo's text with our critical texts. A few examples are enough to illuminate Philo's attitude to Homer and the way he uses his verses.20 To Philo, Homer has a special status among the poets. Homer is the poet who was "most highly esteemed among the Greeks" {Mut. 179, refer ring to Od. 7.36), but he also says more: 141 See, for example, the chapter that Felix Buffiere entitled "Homere, Bible des Grecs," in his Les mythes d'Homere et lapensee Grecque (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1956), 10-13. "י On the theme, see Buffiere, Les mythes d' Homere, 13-25 and Koskenniemi, "Josephus and Greek Poets," The Intertextuality of the Epistles (ed. Thomas L.

Niehoff, "Homeric Scholarship and Bible Exegesis in Ancient Alexandria: Evidence from Philo's 'Quarrelsome' Colleagues," CQ 57 (2007): 166-82. 201 Philo also quotes or refers to Homer in Aet 42 (II. 15.362ff); Decal. 69 (II. 17.32, per haps proverbial); Fug. 31 (Od. 21.294); Legat. 80 [Od 4.454(F); Mig. 195 (Od. 4.392); Prob.Prob. 31; Somn. 150 (Od. 11.303?); Somn. 2.52 (Od. 15.529) Somn. 2.144 (Od. 4.535); Somn.Somn. 2.148 (II. 22.60); Spec. 1.74 (Od. 20.379); Spec. 2.6 (II. 6.266); Alexander 47 (II. 20.170-171).</page><page sequence="6">306 Ε. Koskenniemi / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 301-322 For just as we give the title of "the poet" to Homer in virtue of his pre-emi nence (κατ' έξοχήν), though there are multitudes of poets besides him, and "the"the black" (τό μέλαν) to the material with which we write... so too Moses gave the name of man in pre-eminence (κατ' έξοχήν). (Abr. 10) The context of the passage is that Enos was the first to put his hope in God, which resulted in the use of Enos as a term for "man" κατ' έξοχήν in the Hebrew text. Philo's words on Homer reveal his self-evident place as the first among the poets. A similar passage is found in Conf. 4, where Homer is called "the greatest and most reputed of poets" (ό μέγιστος και δοκιμώτατος των ποιητών).21 In Conf. 170 Philo quotes the famous verses of II. 2.204-205: ούκ αγαθόν πολυκοιρανίη, εις κοίρανος έστω εις εις βασιλεύς.22 However, the context is changed and Odysseus' words that he uttered, when he tried to stop the flight of the Greeks, are not applied to Agamem non, but they are applied to God instead: [these words] could be said with more justice of the world and of God than of cities and men. For being one, it must have one maker and father. Philo thus gives the words a totally new sense: Homer is now used to rebuke polytheism and to support monotheism.23 Philo can also quote the verse in a sense that is closer to the original context. When praising Augustus and his rule he writes: For there is justice in the saying ούκ αγαθόν πολυκοιρανίη, since multiplic ity of suffrages produces multiform evils. (Legat. 149) Now Philo applies the verse to Augustus, although he certainly was unwill ing to attribute supreme power to Caligula. However, Philo's words reflect the situation in which Jews, and later Christians, lived. They had little to 20 Philo here quotes Od. 11.315, 318. 22) "It is not well that many lords should rule: be there but one, one king." (Translations originate from the Loeb edition of Philo, unless otherwise indicated.) 231 See Peder Borgen, Philo of Alexandria: An Exegete for his Time (NovTSup 86; Leiden: Brill, 1997).</page><page sequence="7">Ε. Koskenniemi / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 41 (2010) 301-322 307 expect from the mob on the street; thus, when persecuted, they usually sought help from rulers, governors and the higher classes. Homer could also be helpful when needed. It is interesting that Philo has left out the following words: φ δωκε Κρόνου πάϊς άγκυλοήτεω σκηπτρον τ' ήδέ θέμιστας, ϊνα σφίσι βουλεύησι.24 It may be only a coincidence that Philo has cut short the quotation where he did, since the view that God has given the sceptre to kings is by no means alien to Old Testament thought. However, the words of Kronos's son were perhaps too difficult for him. Unfortunately, we cannot advance the argument through speculation. In De aeternitate mundi25 Philo argues for the eternity of the world and says that every φύσις tries to conserve itself and, if only possible, to stay alive forever. Because the φύσις in a tree and in an animal attempts this, the φύσις in the world does also, πασάων ύπέρ η γε κάρη έχει ήδέ μέτωπα ρεΐά τ' άριγνώτη πέλεται, καλαι δέ τε πάσαι. (Aet. 37)26 The verses are taken directly from Od. 6.107-108, but the context is totally changed. In the original, Artemis, the goddess, excels among her followers, but now the nature of the world excels among other natures. The picture is skillfully adapted, and the reference to a Gentile goddess did not disturb Philo at all. Here, as so often, the only reason for quoting seems to be that Philo liked to quote Homer. The reference does not add substance to his 24י "...to whom the son of scheming Saturn has given the sceptre of sovereignty over you all." 25&gt; Some earlier scholars have considered De aeternitate mundi spurious (the thesis of Ber nays, Uber die unter Philon's Werken stehende Schrift iiber die Unzerstdrbarkeit des Weltalls [Philosophische und historische Abhandlungen der koniglichen Akademie der Wissen schaften zu Berlin; Berlin: Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1882-1883]), and Bruno Snell, in his edition of Pindaros, still attributes the quotation to Pseudo-Philo (Pindarus /-// [Teubner; Lipsiae: Teubner, 1959-1964]), 10. See, however, Roger Arnaldez, De aeternitate mundi. Introduction et notes par R. Arnaldez, traduction par J. Pouilloux (Les oeuvres de Philon d'Alexandrie 30; Paris: Cerf, 1969), 12-37, who agrees with Franz Cumont's view (Philonis de Aeternitate de Aeternitate mundi. Prolegomena [Berlin: G. Reimeri, 1891]) that Philo was still young when writing the treatise. There is no serious reason to assume any writer other than Philo. 261 "High over them all she rears her head and brows / Easy to recognize though all are fair."</page><page sequence="8">308 Ε. Koskenniemi / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 301-322 argumentation. Apparently, he happened to remember the verses, and willingly quoted them to decorate his own text. Philo here acts as any Greek writer writing a cultivated text. In the same treatise Philo encounters the argument that the world can not be indestructible because man is not everlasting and, consequently the environs in which man lives cannot be either. Philo's first counterargument is that the world can change and still be everlasting: The trees shed their leaves at some seasons and then bloom again at others. And so there is truth in the poet's lines which tell us that φύλλα τά μέν τ' άνεμος χαμάδις χέει, άλλα δέ θ' ϋλη τηλεθόωοσα φύει, έαρος δ' έπιγίγνεται ώρη. (Aet. 132)27 In the original context, the words are spoken by Glaucus (II. 6.147-148), who wonders why Diomedes asks about his origin. This time Philo thus preserves the sense of the original quite well: men die and new lives are born. Philo also uses Homer elsewhere to support his philosophical system. In DesomniisDesomniis Philo, as so often, contrasts knowledge based on the senses with better, heavenly knowledge (Somn. 1.57). He here quotes a line from Homer (oru τοι έν μεγάρονσι κακόν τ' άγαθόν τε τέτυκται, "All that exists of of good and of ill in the halls of your homestead," Od. 4.392) to show that a man cannot even understand the universe, although it is more difficult to know himself. Similarly, in Mig. 156 Homer's words (δακρυόεν γελάσασα, "She laughed with glad tears in her eyes," II. 6.484) are used to describe how righteous men can also be moved in their hearts, which corresponds to the Stoic theory of emotions: a wise man may feel disturbances, which, however, do not hinder him from acting justly.28 In Quod omnisprobus liber sit Philo tries to show that every good man is free in spite of his social status. He tells about athletes and warriors who never gave up, and quotes the Iliad (II. 6.407): 271 "Driven by the wind the leaves pour down to earth, / But others come when spring returns and brings / Fresh life into the forest." 28) In Her. 189 Philo quotes Nestor's words honouring Agamemnon έν σοι μέν λήξω, σέο δ' αρξομαι ("With yourself... will I both begin my speech and end it," II. 9.97), applying them to his allegorical interpretation of half a didrachmon mentioned in Exod 30:12-16.</page><page sequence="9">Ε.

(Prob. 112)29 In the Iliad, the words begin Andromache's plea to Hector to stay with him in the castle and not to go out into battle. The context is thus preserved faithfully. In Prob. 121-124, Philo tells the well-known story about Diogenes of Sinope, who was going to be sold on the slave market. He did not lose his audacity. Instead, he requested and received food so as to be in good shape at the market, and tried to share his food with the other captives. To one of them he said: Stop this repining and make the best of things, for καί γάρ τ' ήύκομος Νιόβη έμνησατο σίτου τη τη περ δώδεκα παίδες ένί μεγάροισιν δλοντο, εξ μεν θυγατέρες, εξ δ υίέες ήβώοντες. {Prob. 122)30 The verses are II. 24.602-605, and the context of the original is exactly as it is in Quod omnis probus liber sit·. Achilles has granted Priam us permission to take Hector's corpse and invites him to a meal. The story may have con tained the quotation before Philo's treatise. In Prob. Philo relates the story about Chaereas, who was at odds with Ptolemy. Chaereas considering that his own natural freedom was not a whit inferior to the others kingship replied: Αίγυπτίοισιν ανασσε, σέθεν δ' έγώ οΰκ άλεγίζω ούδ' δθομαι κοτέοντος. {Prob. 125)31 Philo—or, of course, the anecdote before him—changed Agamemnon's original word Μυρμιδόνεσσιν (II. 1.180-181) to Αίγυπτίοισιν to Achilles, and the sense is totally changed. 29) "Ah! then thy own prowess will destroy thee." 301 "Even fair-haired Niobe took thought for food / Though she had lost twelve children in the halls / Six daughters and six sons in prime of youth." 311 "Be King of Egypt: 1 care not for you— / A fig for all your anger."</page><page sequence="10">310 £ Koskenniemi /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 301-322 In Defuga et inventione Philo interprets allegorically32 the sign God set on Cain and takes it for impiety (ασέβεια): Because, I suppose, impiety (άσέβεια) is an evil that cannot come to an end, being ever set alight and never able to be quenched, so that we may fitly apply to wickedness (κακία) the poet's words: ή δέ τοι ού θνητή, άλλ' άθάνατον κακόν έστιν. {Fug. 61)33 In the original context, the verse is part of Circe's words to Odysseus and they refer to Scylla. The context is thus skillfully changed. The verse is used in a similar context also in Det. 178 and QG 1.76, and in both passages Philo mentions Scylla.34 Homer is thus used quite often in the treatises in which Philo defines the relation of the Jewish religion and Greek thought, namely, De aeterni tatetate mundi and Quod omnisprobus liber sit. However, Homer is also mark edly often used in other passages which apparently are directed to Jews. Homer is used in QE2.102 to explain why Gods altar is made from bronze and not from gold: bronze was used in weapons in Homer, and the altar was for bloody offerings. Homer is often quoted elsewhere, too, when Philo directs his message mainly to Jews, as in QG 1.7 {II. 12.239, Od.Od. 20.242), in QG 1.76 (Od.I 12.118), in QG 2.26 (II. 4.2999) QG3.16 (Od.(Od. 14.258). He may also use Homers verses as negative exemplaP as in Cont.Cont.Cont. 40, where he says that a drunken man acts like a Cyclop (cf. Od. 9.373), or in Fug. 31 with its clear allusion to Od. 21.294: And when he is thoroughly sated with eating, he will as the poets say "drink with a yawning maw," and incur the mocking and ridicule of all who see him. Philo seldom if ever writes critically of Homer. However, he reveals his view on Homer clearly in De confusione linguarum. Philo deals with the 32) On Philos allegorical interpretation and its contacts to an Alexandrian interpretation of Homer, see E. Koskenniemi, The Old Testament Miracle-Workers in Early Judaism (WUNT 2.206; Tubingen: Mohr, 2005), 129-30. 331 "No mortal is she, but a deathless ill." 341 Det. 178 is not a direct quotation; QG certainly is, but the text is not preserved in Greek. 3" Legat. 80; Homer Od 4.454ff—Proteus, whom Homer represented as admitting every kind of transfiguration.</page><page sequence="11">Ε.

He refers to the story told in Od.Od. 9.315; 318 and quotes the lines. Although a Jew acquiring Greek edu cation meets with dangers, the Gentile myths are not dangerous: they can easily be read and referred to, but, of course, the sacred stories in the Scrip ture are different, although sometimes similar in uncultivated eyes. Philo quotes Homer so often that it is easy to define his view on the great poet. The quotations show that Philo knew Homer well and appreci ated him. He could quote Homer freely, often preserving the original con text. However, he often used only one or two verses to illuminate his thought, and radically changed the context. He cited Homer partly because he wanted to cite him. It is worth noting that Philo reveals no feeling of tension when mentioning Homer or quoting his verses to his Jewish readers. There are no traces of caution or apologies when Homer is introduced. This tells a lot of of Philo's implied audience. But Homer was also a part of Philo's argumen tation. I have elsewhere suggested that he used Classical drama as Chrysip pus did: the famous Stoic philosopher eagerly quoted tragedies to support his views. The model is adopted by Philo: if only understood properly, Homer and other poets speak for the Jewish religion. Moreover, the inter esting thing is not only what Philo says about Homer but also what he does not say. Plato, his favourite philosopher, strongly criticized Homer, although he also appreciated him.36 Josephus readily quoted Plato's critical words and, for his part, was willing to cast the poets, and even Homer, out of the city, which in his text seems to mean Jerusalem.37 To Philo, such a view is alien. Some ancient writers, who liked both Homer and Plato, tried to interpret Plato's problematic criticism as well as they could.38 Others simply wrote positively of both, and this is precisely what Philo does. Homer obviously belonged to the commune bonum and Philo was not afraid of being criticized for quoting him. Kindstrand investigated how Dion of Prusa, Maximus ofTyrus and Aelius Aristides used Homer: Philo shows that he knew him as well as any of these learned writers. But before coming to any conclusions, the rest of the evidence must be collected. 361 On the philosophical critique of Homer among the Greeks, see above, p. 000.

His Theogony, along with his strong position in the Graeco Roman culture, generated a special interest in him in early Judaism.40 In De aeternitate mundi, Philo presents his view on the origins of the world, and tries to connect it with different Greek views. Among several Greek authors, he also quotes Hesiod: Some think that the poet Hesiod is the father of this Platonic doctrine and suppose that he calls the world uncreated and indestructible, uncreated because he says ήτοι μέν πρώτιστα χάος γένετ', αύτάρ επειτα γαΐ' εύρύστερνος, πάντων εδος ασφαλές αίεί,41 indestructible because he never declared that it will be dissolved or destroyed. Chaos in Aristotle's opinion is a space because a body must have something there already to hold it, but some of the Stoics suppose that it is water and that the name is derived from its diffusion. But whichever of these is right Hesiod very clearly states the view that the world is created and long before Hesiod Moses the lawgiver of the Jews said in the Holy Books that it was ere ated and imperishable. These books are five in number, to the first of which he gave the name of Genesis. (Aet. 17-19) In this context Philo concurs with Plato's doctrine that the world was ere ated and will never be destroyed, and now he is happy to be able to derive everything from the Torah, Hesiod, as well as Plato. The way he presents Moses and the Pentateuch makes it clear that he directed his work to people not knowing them, that is, to Gentiles. The line quoted is from Theogony Theogony 116-117, and the reading is identical with the text we have (OCT). In De ebrietate Philo refers to the story about Hannah, who was falsely thought to be drunken and says, according to Philo, γυνη ή σκληρά ήμέρα έγώ εϊμι, και οίον και μέθυσμα ού πέπωκα ("I a woman am the hard day, I have drunk no wine or strong drink"). Philo goes on: 391 On Hesiod, see Graziano Arrighetti, "Hesiodos," DNP 5:506-10. 40, On the anonymous Samaritan, see Hengel, Judaism and Hellenism, 88-89; on Sib.

First, we see, she calls herself a "hard day," taking the view of the varlet who thought to make a mock of her, for to him and to every fool the way to virtue seems rough and painful and ill to tread, and to this one of the old writers has testified in these words: την μέν τοι κακότηα και ίλαδόν έστιν έλέσθαι της δ' αρετής ίδρωτα θεός προπάροιθεν εθηκεν αθάνατος, μακρός δέ και όρθιος οίμος ές αΰτην καΐ τρηχύς τό πρώτον· έπήν δ' εις άκρον ϊκηται, ρηδίη δή 'πειτα πέλει, χαλεπή περ έοΰσα. (Ebr. 149-150)42 Hie "old writer" is Hesiod in Erg. 287, 289-292. The lines are not identical with what we have (OCT). Above all, one line (288) is missing: ρτ!δίως · λείη μέν όδός, μάλα δ' έγγύθι ναίει · ("the road to her is smooth, and she lives very near us") The line should not contain anything problematic for Philo, and it is not easy to explain, why he would have dropped it. Was it a mistake or did his text differ from ours? In Philo's context, the verse could be dropped with out losing the meaning of the quotation. On the other hand, Philo, or others before him, has obviously changed θεοί, έθηκαν and άθάνατοι in Hesiod to θεός, έθηκεν and άθάνατος (v. 289-290), which means that monotheism is carefully preserved, even when a classical author is quoted. Personal lecture was not the only way in which to meet interesting Greek verses. Especially Josephus' works attest to the fact that Jewish scholars had collected such verses before him and delivered a collection used for educa tional purposes.43 Philo, too, could use the work of his predecessors. To be true, as known of his writings, he was rather a man who helped his fellow Jews by collecting than one who used anthologies compiled by former scholars. However, as a young student he certainly used tools produced by Aristobulos and other Jewish scholars. 42) "Vice you may take by squadrons: but there lies / "Twist you and virtue (so hath God ordained) / Sore travail. Long and steep the road to her, / And rough at first: but—reach the top—and she / So hard to win, is now an easy prize." 43) See Koskenniemi, "Josephus and Greek Poets," 50-51.</page><page sequence="14">314 Ε. Koskenniemi / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 301-322 The myth told by Philo in Plant. 129-130 is not a direct quotation from Hesiod,44 but close enough that it must be mentioned: The story runs that the Author of the universe on hearing this commended what had been said, and that it was not long before there appeared the new birth, the family of the Muses and hymnody, sprung from the womb of one of His powers, even virgin Memory, whose name most people slightly change and call her "Mnemosyne." So runs the myth of the men of old. Apparently the myth is a version of Theogony 56-61, in which Zeus lies nine nights with Mnemosyne, who after a year gives birth to the nine Muses: έννέα γάρ οΐ νύκτας έμίσγετο μητίετα Ζεύς νόσφιν άπ' αθανάτων ιερόν λέχος είσαναβαίνων άλλ' δτε δή ρ' ένιαουτός εην, περι δ' έτραπον ώραι μηνών φθινόντων, περι δ' ήματα πόλλ' έτελέσθη, ή δ' ετεκ' έννέα κούρας, όμόφρονας, ήσιν άοιδή μέμβλεται έν στήθεσσιν, άκηδέα θυμόν έχούσαις.. .45 Philo thus uses a Gentile myth, but, of course, makes many changes. The birth of the Muses is attributed to Israel's God, who, of course, does not, like Zeus, lie with Mnemosyne, yet uses his words. In any case, this flexible use of the myth provides very interesting evidence of Philo's adaptation of Greek texts. A short proverbial quotation appears in Decal. 69 δ καΐ παις εγνω νήπιος, which resembles the words in Erg. 218 παθών δέ τε νήπιος εγνω ("only when he has suffered does the fool/child learn this," see also II. 17.32). The proverbial character of the words is also evident in Plato's Symposium 222b. In Alexander, a text preserved only in Armenian, Philo writes on the wisdom of irrational animals; his Alexander praises the bees, who kill 441 In Her. 116 and Det. 64, Philo quotes the words άρχή δέ τοι ήμισυ παντός ("The begin ning is half the whole"), and does not tell his source. The line resembles Hesiod, Erg. 40 δσ&lt;ρ πλέον ήμισυ παντός. On grasshoppers which do not need food, see Contempt 36 and Hesiod, Asp is 395fF. 45) "For nine nights did wise Zeus lie with her, entering her holy bed remote from the immortals. And when a year was passed and the seasons came round as the months waned, and many days were accomplished, she bore nine daughters, all of one mind, whose hearts are set upon song, and whose spirit is free from care."</page><page sequence="15">Ε. Koskenniemi / Journal for the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 301-322 315 the drones, because they eat the work of others; in this context he quotes Hesiod's Theogony 599. The Armenian text does not give the exact words (in Hesiod, άλλότριον κάματον σφετέρην ές γαστέρ' άμώνται, "reap the toil of others into their own bellies"), but the context has remained the same. In the original text of Hesiod, the bees and drones are used as meta phors for men and women.46 Solon Solon, the famous lawgiver of Athens,47 was also a poet, who left a number of verses written in distichon. In De opificio mundi, Philo quotes the words of Solon extensively. These ages of mans life were described by Solon, the lawgiver of the Athe nians, among others, in the following lines Παις μεν άνηβος έών έτι νήπιος ερκος οδόντων φύσας έκβάλλει πρώτον έν έ'πτ' έτεσιν· τους δ' έτερους δτε δή τελέση θεός επτ' ένιαυτούς, ήβης έκφαίνει σήματα γιγνομένης· τη τριτάτη δε γένειον άεξομένων έτι γυίων λαχοΰνται, χροιής άνθος αμειβομένης. τη δέ τετάρτη πάς τις έν έβδομάδ' έστίν άριστος ίσχΰν, ην τ' άνδρες σήματ' έχουσ' αρετής· πέμπτη δ' ώριον άνδρα γάμου μεμνημένον είναι και παίδων ζητεΐν έξοπίσω γενεήν · τη δ' έκτη περί πάντα καταρτύεται νόος ανδρός, ούδ' έρδειν έθ' όμως έργ' άπάλαμνα θέλει· έπτά δέ νουν και γλώσσαν έν έβδομάσιν μέγ' άριστος όκτώ τ', άμφοτέρων τέσσαρα και δέκ' έτη· τη δ' ένάτη έτι μην δύναται, μαλακώτερα δ' αύτοΰ προς μεγάλην άρετην γλωσσά τε και σοφίη · την δεκάτην δ' εϊ τις τελέσας κατά μέτρον ϊκοιτο, ουκ αν άωορος έών μοΐραν έχοι θανάτου.48 46) In QE 2.102.503, Philo uses Hesiod's view on three subsequent ages, but very innova lively and without mentioning the poet; see Emile Brehier, Les idees philosophiques et reli gieusesgieuses de Philon d'Alexandrie (Etudes de philosophic medievale 8; Paris: Vrin, 1950), 38-39. 47, On Solon, see Ewen Bowie and Misha Meier "Solon," DNP11:705-10. 48) "In seven years the Boy, an infant yet unfledged, / Both grows and sheds the teeth with which his tongue is hedged. / When heaven has made complete a second week of years / Of</page><page sequence="16">316 Ε. Koskenniemi /Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 301-322 Solon, then, recons the life of man by the aforesaid ten weeks of years {Opif.{Opif. 104). The context in Solon's poem (27 West) is lost and we only have these lines, rendered with few changes by Philo, Clement of Alexandria {Strom. 6.144.3) and Anatolius (p. 37 Heiberg). The context in Philos work is division of human life into weeks of years. Now, besides the Pythagorean philosophers and Hippocrates, he can also refer directly to Solon and quote his verses extensively. Often, we only have the fragmentary works of the early Greek poets, quoted by some later writer, and only in one version. Now it is hardly an occasional occurrence that we know the verses exclusively in Jewish and Christian tradition. Clement was impressed by Philo's writings and copied many of his innovations, thereby mediating him to a broader Christian readership. But Philo was hardly the first Jewish author who had noted Solon's verses. Here, too, we meet the work of eager Jewish scholars who had collected everything that could speak for the Jewish religion. Josephus was able to tell what Homer never said, although he knew his works poorly, and apparently relied on the work of former Jewish scholars.49 This seems to be the case here, too. Although Philo was himself able to read original texts, he and his colleagues collected quotations that were important for Jewish readers. It is no wonder that he knew these verses by heart.50 coming prime of youth full many a sign appears. / In life's third term, while still his limbs grow big apace, / His chin shows down: its early bloom now quits his face. / In the fourth heptad each of one full of strength doth seem— / Strength, which of manly worth best earnest all men deem. / Let him in his fifth week of years a bride bespeak, / Offspring to bear his name hereafter let him seek. / The sixth beholds the man good sense all round attain; / Not now can reckless deeds as once his fancy gain. / Now see him seventh and eighth, fresh heptads, duly reach / In insight strongest now, strongest in power of speech. / In his ninth week of years, strong still but softer far / For high achievement's venture speech and wisdom are. / Then should the man, ten bouts complete, attain life's end / Fate, no untimely gift, death's call may fitly send." 49) See Koskenniemi, "Josephus and Greek Poets," 50-51. 501 Philo also mentions Solon in Spec. 3.22-23 and Prob. 47, but here Solon, who was considered one of the legendary seven wise men, does not appear as a poet, but as a lawgiver.</page><page sequence="17">£ Koskenniemi / Journal for the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 301-322 317 TheognisTheognis Theodor Middendorp claimed in 1972 that already Ben Sira used a collec tion of Theognis' verses to compose his work for educational purposes.51 Although this view has mostly been rejected, it is obvious that Theognis52 was famous in the Hellenistic world. Philo quotes him once. In Quod omnisomnis probus liber sit, he writes as follows: οΰποτε δουλείη κεφαλή ευθεία πέφυκεν, άλλ' αϊει σκολιή, καύχενα λοξόν εχει.53 For the crooked, artificial, deceitful character is utterly ignoble, while the straight, simple and ingenuous, in which thoughts agree with words and words with thoughts, is noble. (Prob. 155) In our text (BT, Young), the first line is only slightly different (οΰποτε δουλείη κεφαλή ίθεΐα πέφυκεν, Theognis 1.535-536). As so many ancient writers, Philo also uses Theognis for the main purpose of Quod omnis probus probus liber sit, to show that a wise man is not afraid of tyrants. In contrast to Theognis, however, for Philo the tyrant was not an earthly lord, but pas sion and pleasure. Philo thus cleverly uses Theognis for his main topic, to remind his readers of the struggle between the soul and passions. Pindaros Pindaros was famous of his epinikions and epigrams.54 Philo mentions him55 in De aeternitate mundi: Men also gave the name of Anaphe to Delos, using both names to vouch for the fact here stated, because it became apparent and visible, while in the past it was unapparent and invisible, and so Pindaros says of Delos: 5I) On Middendorp's book and the discussion that followed it, see Koskenniemi, Old Testa mentment Miracle Workers, 28-29. 521 On Theognis, see Bowie, "Theognis," DNP 12: 351-54. 53' "A slaves head ne'er sits straight upon his shoulder / But always crooked on a twisted neck." 54) On Pindaros, see Emmett Robbins, "Pindaros," DNP 9: 1030-36. 55, In Legat. 84 Philo refers to the Dioscuri, who were said to have shared immortality between themselves: he apparently refers to Pindar's Nemean 10.73-90, but this is not a quotation.</page><page sequence="18">318 Ε.

Pindaros' hymn is preserved only in fragments (Fr 29-3 5e Snell). The verses, which Philo quotes, are quoted exactly as we have them (Fr. 33c Snell); only κικλήσκοισιν is changed to κικλήσκοισιν. However, the rest of the dialectic features are carefully preserved in Philo's text. It means that Philo deeply understood the diversity of old Greek dialects. To be true, this fact must have been known to every reader of the ancient poets. In De virtutibus, Philo writes, perhaps pointing to Gaius,57 as follows: Secondly, the arrogant man is always filled with the spirit of unreason, hold ing himself, as Pindaros says οΰτε ανδρα οΰτε ήμίθεον, άλλ' δλον δαίμονα,58 and claiming to overstep the limits of human nature. (Virt. 172) The quotation (Fr. 280 Bowra) is unknown in other sources. In Deprovidentia, which is preserved only in fragments, Philo mentions Pindaros: The sun and moon are natural divinities, and so these eclipses are concomi tant circumstances, yet eclipses announce the death of kings and the destruc tion of cities as is darkly indicated by Pindaros on the occurrence of an eclipse in the passage quoted below. (Prov. 2.50) 561 "Hail, island built by gods / Thou scion best beloved by those / Whom lustrous-haired Latona bore, / Daughter of Ocean, marvel of broad earth, / Whose base no power can shake. Delos we mortals name thee, but on high, / Where dwell the blessed ones, they call thee Star / Seen in the distance of the azure earth." 571 On Philo's possible latent criticism of Gaius, see Koskenniemi, Old Testament Miracle Workers,Workers, 132-33. 58) "Neither man nor demigod, but wholly divine."</page><page sequence="19">Ε. Koskenniemi / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 301-322 319 The passage to which Philo refers is not preserved. However, it perhaps was the fragment quoted by Dionysius of Halicarnassus [De vi dem. 6, fr. 107 / 74; Paeanes 9 = Fr. 52k Snell).59 Unidentified Unidentified Poets Philo sometimes quotes lines which we cannot identify. In Aet. 41 Philo writes as follows: As As they say, ούδέ γυνή τοσσόνδε νόου έπιδεύεται έσθλοΰ ώστε χερείον' έσλέσθαι άμεινοτέρων &lt;παρεόντων&gt;60 The source of the hexameter verses is unknown. In De aeternitate mundi, Philo's train of thought runs as follows: if another world takes the place of the current one, this world is either worse or better than this previous world, and both are impossible, because God neither makes mistakes nor corrects his works. A little later in the same work he writes as follows: Many other cities also are stated to have been swallowed up and to have disap peared overwhelmed by the sea. And so too in Peloponnese they say that the three, Αϊγειραν Βοΰράν τε και ύψηλήν Έλίκειαν, τείχεσιν ή τάχ' εμελλε περί βρύα μυρία φύσειν,61 which were most flourishing in old times were inundated by a great inroad of the sea. {Aet. 140) The stories of cities overwhelmed by the sea were common, and Philo himself refers to Atlantis in the following chapter. However, this quotation remains unidentified and only the hexameter helps to guess the genre and the content of the work the verses are taken from. 591 See Colson, Philo IX. With an English translation by F. H. Colson (LCL 363; Cam bridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1941), 46; Snell, Pindarus, 46. 60י "Not even a woman so far lacks good sense / As when the better's there to choose the worse." 611 "Aegeira, Bura, lofty Heliceia, / Whose walls would soon be clad with thick sea-moss."</page><page sequence="20">320 Ε. Koskenniemi / Journal for the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 301-322 In Quod omnis probus liber sit, Philo writes: Surely when we agree that the familiars of kings enjoy not only freedom but authority, because they take part in their management and administration as leaders, we must not give the name of slaves to those who stand in the same relation to the celestial gods, who are god-lovers and thereby necessarily god beloved, rewarded with the same affection as they have shown, and in the judgment of truth are as the poets say, παναρχοντές τε και βασειλέες βασιλέων εΐσι. (Prob. 42)62 Philo does not attribute the words to any of the poets, and it is also unclear which poetic words were part of the quotation. Possibly Philo himself had a remote reminiscence of something he had read or heard.63 Poets in General Philo thus quotes the verses of several poets, but often he summarily refers to poets in general. These brief references, of which only exemplars have been chosen, are important and tell about his attitude to Greek culture. Sometimes Philo refers to poets in a negative sense.64 One of the most pejorative words he could use was the word "sophist," and in De opificio mundi,mundi, he writes as follows: Now these are no mythical fictions, such as poets and sophists delight in (οίς το ποιητικόν και σοφιστικόν χαίρει γένος). (Ορ if. 157) The context is the fall of Adam and Eve, which is contrasted with myths and interpreted allegorically (Opif. 157-160). In a similar way, Philo could contrast other biblical stories, such as the confusion of tongues in Babel (Conf. 2-3), with myths, and this triggered an allegorical interpretation of ω) "Rulers of all and kings of kings." 63) Philo's works, which are preserved in Armenian only, include in QE 2.6 and Alexander 47 partly identical verses, which the editors cannot identify; according to Abraham Terian {Alexander{Alexander vel de ratione quam habere etiam bruta animalia (de animalibus) e versione arme niacaniaca / introduction, traduction et notes par Abraham Terian [Les oeuvres de Philon d' Alexandrie 36; Paris: Cerf, 1988], 141) the verses "rappelle les poemes orphiques." 641 I exclude Fug. 42, in which Philo speaks of "fabulous fiction, the poem without metre or melody"; that is, of bad poetry.</page><page sequence="21">Ε. Koskenniemi / Journalfor the Study of Judaism 41 (2010) 301-322 321 the biblical passage, and emphasised the dissimilarity. "Myths" and "poets" could thus have a negative sense, which Philo tried to avoid. But although Philo occasionally criticises poets, most of his general references are positive in tone. He may say that Paradise was created in the same manner as was the chorus of the Muses according to poets (QG 1.6). In his apologetic Legatio he can speak of Tiberius' age as an almost Satur nine age (Legat. 13). He may also refer approvingly to poets who tell about giants (QG 1.92) or the nature of earth {Opif. 133). The Greek tradition offered Jewish writers several options for attacking poets in general. The criticism of anthropomorphism had long roots and, as stated above, even Homer was criticised. Philo's favourite philosopher, Plato, would have offered a full arsenal, if the Hellenistic Jewish writer would have wanted to make use of it. Obviously he did not want to. This is somewhat strange, because Philo, for example, passionately excludes anthropomorphism and anthropopathism. However, this did not lead him to a general aversion to the poets. Conclusion The ancient tradition offered many ways to use and reuse Classical poets. Philo was not a poet, and consequently he did not rewrite verses like Catul lus reshaped Sappho in his Ille mi par esse deo videtur, and, as far we know, he never wrote or used pseudonymous verses. What he quotes, we almost always know from other sources. He often quotes Greek poets: Homer, but also Hesiod, Solon, Pindaros and Theognis. He preferred to use his deep knowledge of genuine verses, although often in a changed sense. A learned Jew certainly knew that Greek authors either liked or disliked poets. Prominent writers, especially Plato and some of his predecessors, were very critical of them. This was the way Josephus took them, appar ently representing the mainstream of learned Palestinian Judaism. But Philo was totally different, and a general aversion to poets was an attitude alien to him, although he now was necessarily at odds with Plato, his favourite philosopher. Of course, he sometimes makes it clear that the myths of the poets, although they can be referred to, cannot be compared to the Jewish Scriptures. The references are mostly very accurate compared to critical editions. Philo was able to preserve almost all dialectical features, which shows that he had worked with original texts and also understood the dialectical</page><page sequence="22">322 Ε. Koskenniemi / Journal for the Study ofJudaism 41 (2010) 301-322 peculiarities. He could make mistakes, or perhaps drop a line. Part of the reason for this might be that his text differed from our critical editions, although they mostly agree verbatim. But sometimes he made changes for theological reasons, although he may refer to surprising passages, such as the birth of the Muses. More often he skillfully changed the context of the quotation, making it speak in support of his own view. As said above, he here follows the manner of Chrysippus and the Stoics. These quotations, together with the evidence presented in terms of the Greek dramatists, attest that Philo had an extremely good knowledge of Greek literature. Anyone using Homer and other poets reveals the level of his education, and Philo was a very learned man. He knows poets as well any Greek writer, and he may be mentioned together with, for example, any of the learned sophists, such as Philostratus and the tradition of the Second Sophistic in general. Philo's works allow us a glimpse to learned circles of the Alexandrian Jews. Philo had memorized poets in gymnasium, and undoubtedly the collecting work of his learned Jewish predecessors was known to him in his youth. But unlike Josephus, Philo did not need to plow with a foreign heifer. His works show that he knew Greek poets very well, and liked them. His manner of using the Greek poets indicates that he had received a very good Greek education in an Alexandrian gymnasium. It is thus no exaggeration to say that he was certainly equal to any of his classmates. He hardly lost the contact to Classical poets after his early years, but allowed them to entertain him and his friends during his lifetime. Homer, Hesiod and others were not dangerous: if only interpreted properly they supported the Jewish religion.</page></plain_text>
