Aharoni, Jerusalem During the first four seasons of excavations about 100 Hebrew ostraca dating from the period of the First Temple were discovered. From the point of view of contents the most important are 17 from the archives of Eliashib, who was in charge of the fortress' stores in the period preceding the destruction of the First Temple and was apparently a priest or a Levite. Beth Yahweh is mentioned, evidently referring to the Temple in Jerusalem. Another ostracon dating approximately from Josiah's period contains a long row of personal names. Fragments of a letter, apparently from the time of Hezekiah, in which the 'King of Judah' is mentioned, have also been preserved. The rest of the ostraca are most fragmentary and their main importance is paleographic. They belong to strata 6-10 in Arad, i.e., from the end of the 9th century until the des truction of the First Temple. This is the first time Hebrew ostraca have been found in the various layers of a single tell the date of each of which can be established with considerable certainty thanks to large quantities of pottery found on the floors. With their aid it is possible to determine the subtle differences in the development of the cursive script of this period as well as the more striking variations which occurred in the forms of a number of letters, e.g., yorf, and qof. A comparison of the ancient ostraca from Arad with other Hebrew inscriptions such as the Samaria ostraca proves that they should be dated somewhat earlier than many scholars have conjectured. (See Figs. 5-9.) JOINT SESSION OF THE BIBLE, ARCHAEOLOGY, AND ANCIENT JEWISH HISTORY SECTIONS The book of Genesis in the light of history B. Mazar, Jerusalem The study of the book of Genesis with its wealth of traditions has made immense strides in our time thanks to an abundance of epigraphic documents and archaeological dis coveries dating from the second millennium B.C.E. Various problems touching on literary and linguistic aspects as well as on the religious and socio-juridical background came to be seen in a new light and were given fresh interpretations, especially by Cassuto, Albright, and Speiser and innumerable studies devoted to various subjects and phenomena in the book and to Hebrew history. On the other hand, some basic questions connected with the history of the book of Genesis and the life reflected in it have remained obscure. This essay postulates that the book of Genesis was from the beginning a uniform historiographic composition based on oral traditions and written sources, which mirrors the spirit of the times in which it was composed. It is reasonable to suppose that the book received its original written form in the period of the Israelite kingdom's consolidation and the crystallization of the stable, fixed Hebrew-Phoenician alphabet. The mode of life reflected in it dates chiefly from the end of the period of the Judges and the beginning of the monarchy when memories of the wanderings and the settling of Canaan were still fresh and there were various traditions circulating about the patri archs and their way of life, their faith and their connection with shrines in the country and even about their origins in Meso potamia and their relationship to the descendants of Nahor. In this fashion, it is possible to explain the so-called 'anachronisms' appearing in all the narratives of the patriarchs and in the fragmentary poems with which they are inter spersed. The descriptions of the lives of the patriarchs in the western Negev, in the land of Gerar, where they tended their flocks and temporarily engaged in agriculture under the protection of Abimelech, king of the Philistines, and the mode of life reflected in these tales; the appearance of the Arameans in Mesopotamia, their connection with the Hebrew patriarchs and their occupation of Northern Gilead; the list of the kings of Edom 'before there reigned any king over the children of Israel' and the blessings of Isaac; the stories about Hagar and Ishmael and the settling of the Ishmaelites on the country's borders and the role they played in the caravan trade; the lists of the peoples of Canaan and the mention of Sidon's name as Canaan's 'first-born' and similar instances — all fit nicely into the political and ethnic picture of the second half of the eleventh century and the beginning of the tenth. This applies equally to everything concerning Mahanaim, Penuel, Shechem, Bethel, Hebron, and Beer-Sheba and the allusions to places of worship, including shrines in Bethel and other sites, which became famous in the period of the Judges and at the begining of the monarchy. Gen. xiv was probably written in David's time, based on a more ancient source, with a double purpose in mind: to explain that the nation's progenitor had already acquired the right to the entire country, from El-Paran (Eilat) as far as north of Damascus, and to emphasize his connection with Melchizedek king of Salem, a wondrous figure of a monarch and a priest to God the Most High, whom the rulers of Jeru salem regarded as their ancestor (Psalms cx). Jacob's blessing not only shows the inheritance of the Israelite tribes but also raises the prestige of the tribe of Judah as out standing among the people and fighter of its battles. JOINT SESSIONS OF THE BIBLE AND ANCIENT JEWISH HISTORY SECTIONS The Book of the Acts of Solomon J. Liver, Tel Aviv One of the most important questions in the study of the book of Kings is the nature of the 'Book of the Acts of Solomon' mentioned (in I Kings x!:41) as a source for the history of Solomon's reign. Of the various suggestions made, the least likely is that the book of the acts of Solomon is a work based chiefly on royal chronicles, but the opinion that this book contained Solomon's 'wisdom' provides an opening for understanding the nature of the work.</page><page sequence="3">252 ABSTRACTS OF HEBREW LECTURES The description of the history of Solomon in the book of Kings based on the book of the acts of Solomon is unique in that it makes an extended use of sources of archival nature and lays special stress on Solomon's wisdom. The stories it contains should not be defined or belittled as folktales. They originated among the scribes and scholars close to the court, and do not contain the ingredients of folktales, nor do they contain actual accounts of wonders. Even God's revelation to Solomon at Gibeon when He promised him a wise heart takes place in a dream — the form of revelation nearest to the sphere of rational experience. In I Kings v, Solomon is described as a person steeped in the knowledge of the sages and scribes. Similarly, in the story of the Queen of Sheba, Solomon's ties with this distant kingdom are described with emphasis not on their commercial or political aspects but on the reputation of the king's wonderful wisdom. A scribe from the circles of sages could be expected to emphasize the king's wisdom and lace his story with tales of a wisdom nature; at the same time, he would have access to royal chronicles and archival sources like those woven into the description of Solomon's history appearing in I Kings. A basis for determining the date and slant of the Book of the Acts of Solomon is to be found in chapter xii. According to chapter xi, the background for the division of the kingdom was the fact that ,Solomon's heart was not whole with the Lord'. The chapter pivots on the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and bears the stamp of a prophetic tale, although prophetic elements are not found in other texts dealing with Solomon's history. The description of the division of the kingdom in chapter xii is of a different nature. The reason for the division is the foolishness of Rehoboam, who scorned the counsel of his father's old advisers which was politically expedient but far from the realm of pure ethics. This is an obvious wisdom story displaying a penchant for presenting Rehoboam as a person despising wisdom and thus losing his mastery over the northern tribes. It relates nothing of God's will or of Solo mon's sins. The story in chapter xii has no formal opening and appears to be a continuation of the description of events during Solomon's reign. This would seem to further the assumption that I Kings xii (and not chapter xi) is the conclusion to the Book of the Acts of Solomon. All this may serve as a foundation for a proposition con cerning the composition of the Book of the Acts of Solomon; namely, that it was written a relatively short time after the division of the kingdom, by a sage of Solomon's court who was one of those turned out during Rehoboam's reign. The author used royal chronicles and archival sources and added tales about Solomon's wisdom in its various aspects; while his purpose was to show that Solomon's success was in no small measure due to the power of his wisdom. The biblical account of Shishak's invasion: prophetic historiosophy versus reality Y. Elizur, Jerusalem Shishak's raid into Palestine (ca. 926 B.C.E.) is dealt with in the Bible in two places: I Kings xiv: 25,26 and II Chronicles xii :2. The essential feature in both places is that Shishak, king of Egypt, 'came up against Jerusalem'. The event in its entirety is considered as part of the history of Judah, and the Bible contains no indication that the raid in any way in volved the kingdom of Israel. On the other hand, the Egyptian document which parallels the biblical account is Shishak's inscription from the Temple of Amon at Karnak, which lists more than 50 places in Palestine which Shishak (Sheshonk) attacked. The over whelming majority of place names which can be read and identified are in the kingdom of Israel. Mazar reconstructed Shishak's route and discovered that it passed mainly through the kingdom of Jeroboam and hardly touched the kingdom of Judah itself (with the exception of the Negev, which is a separate matter and is described at the bottom of the in scription). Thus, the biblical account appears to contradict historical reality as portrayed in the inscription and the archaeological finds. The routine explanation that the biblical scribes happened to have before them only a source which mentioned Shishak's invasion incidentally is unacceptable, since compre hensive and exact information concerning historical events of such magnitude were not lacking in the biblical period. Most likely, what the Bible contains is not a fragmentary, almost unintelligible description, but a deliberate statement in the spirit of prophetic historiosophy. The sharp discrepancy between historic reality and the biblical account not only sheds light on the pragmatic observation typical of the biblical scribes in historical matters, but also lays bare the background of Shishak's raid. Logically, in view of all the documentation, Shishak should have come to Jeroboam's aid at the very outset of his career in order to secure the latter's help in crushing the Davidid dynasty, which had grown powerful, and its center, Jerusalem. The original object was Shishak's destruction of Judah in the south and Jeroboam's in the north and the establishment of a small Israelite vassal state instead of the powerful kingdom of the Davidids. Apparently, that was not what Jeroboam had in mind and he refused to participate in the plan. Then, a turning point occurred. Shishak, angry at his 'treacherous protdgd', transformed the campaign to annihilate Judah into a punitive expedition against Jeroboam's kingdom. Shishak's inscription and the archaeological finds describe historic reality. The Bible, on the other hand, describes what lay in store for Judah and Jerusalem but did not materialize by virtue of the concern of Divine Providence, which is the center of the Scriptures' interest. Menahem the son of Gadi's war against Tiphsah M. Haran, Jerusalem During the reign of Jeroboam son of Joash (788/7 to 748/7 B.C.E.), a number of political and military changes took place. At first he still had to restore Israelite rule over Trans Jordan, and not until the end of his reign could he make himself master of Damascus and Hamath (II Kings xiv: 24, 28). This imperial expansion, which brought Jeroboam to the</page><page sequence="4">JOINT SESSIONS 253 shores of the Euphrates River, could only have occurred at a time when the Syrian region was free of all Assyrian influence, that is, during the reign of Ashur-Dan III (773-755) and still more, of Ashur-Nirari V (755-745), during which the Assyrians disappeared completely from south and central Syria. However, the political and military vacuum which the Assyrians left lasted until the appearance of Tiglath Pileser III in Syria in 743, i.e., about 4-5 years after the death of Jeroboam. The question arises, what happened to Israelite rule in south (and central) Syria after the death of Jeroboam. Within a year after Jeroboam's death, Menahem the son of Gadi was on the throne, for the reign of Zechariah the son of Jeroboam lasted only six months (II Kings xv:8-10) and Shallum the son of Jabesh was put to death after ruling for only another month (ibid., 13-14). This means that during the early years of Menahem's reign, Syria was still free of Assyrian influence. The imperial structure established by Jeroboam did not collapse immediately after his death. There is illuminating evidence of this in II Kings xv:16 which says explicitly that after succeeding to the throne Menahem smote Tiphsah, and he ripped up all the women there who were with child. According to this reference, Menahem looms up as one of the few Israelite kings who established themselves on the shores of the Euphrates. Scholars at this point accept the reading of the Lucian recension of the Septuagint and read Tappuah instead of Tiphsah. But this reading (like the other readings of the Septuagint for this verse: Tirzah, Tairah) is erroneous. Mena hem could not have had any reason for attacking Tappuah (nor Tirzah either). The cruel act of ripping open the pregnant women indicates an assault against an alien city (cf. II Kings vui :12; Amos 1:13) and was apparently an atrocity invented by the Assyrians (Hos. xiv:3). The upheavals surrounding the throne of Samaria in the year of Jeroboam's death were not enough to rescue Damascus from its state of subjection to Israel, and consequently, the way to the Euphrates River was still open to Menahem. The Israelite kingdom's hegemony in Syria ended several years later with the appearance of king Uzziah of Judah at the head of a coalition of states against Tiglath Pileser III. This event occurred about 740 (738, at the latest), i.e., during the very reign of Menahem (which lasted at least until 737). We have no information to explain how Uzziah's stature grew and, concurrently, how that of Menahem declined. Further more, it is clear that Uzziah's action in Syria was dependent on an alliance and peaceful relations with the kingdom of Samaria. The alliance between the two countries already existed during Jeroboam's reign and may explain the reference to Judah in II Kings xiv:28. JOINT SESSIONS OF THE BIBLE AND HEBREW LANGUAGE SECTIONS The biblical vocabulary of Saadia Gaon Eli Eytan, Ramat Gan One of the important tasks of the historical dictionary of the Hebrew language should be to gather the meanings attributed to biblical words in mediaeval times and explain them. It is impossible to have a complete understanding of Saadia Gaon,s interpretations of biblical terms as long as we do not possess a critical edition of his Bible commentary; but the meaning of a few words can be discussed. מורשים, which occurs frequently in mediaeval Hebrew poetry, can be explained from Saadia's commentary on מורשי לבבי in Job. It is translated by the Arabic ניאט קלבי and the reason behind this translation is discussed. שפיפון is translated by what this writer thinks should be emended into Arabic מטחן, an adjective, used substantively for a snake. The word קשיטה in Saadia is shown to denote a flayed sheep. JOINT SESSION OF THE JEWISH HISTORY SECTIONS: Symposium on the division of Jewish History into periods B. Mazar, Jerusalem In his opening remarks, the chairman stressed the particular difficulties which mark the task of fixing limits for the periods in Jewish history, a history which is extremely long and complicated, which spreads over a most extensive geographic al area, and which has not followed a straight line of develop ment through processes of organic growth, but was dependent to an extraordinary extent on the changes in external conditions. The chairman further pointed out the differences in attitude between various scholars as far as the problem of highlighting the most significant turning-points in Israel's ancient history is concerned. There is a difference of principle between whether one regards as the most significant turning point in the ancient period the destruction of the First Temple, or whether one attaches most importance to the beginning of Greek rule in Judah following Alexander's conquest. The first event is of supreme significance in the history of the Jews in this country, while the latter occurrence hardly constitutes a major development in Jewish history, central though its importance may be for general history. Some historians consider the history of Israel to have come to its end with the biblical period or with the destruction of the Second Temple. It is a current opinion among such scholars, who reflect a Christian attitude, that there are two distinct histories: the history of Israel on the one side and that of Judaism on the other. Although the destruction of the Second Temple and the Bar Kokhba revolt are two events each of which can claim to be regarded as a decisive turning point in Jewish history, neither of them constitutes a trans formation as profound as that which is implied by the scholars mentioned above. Throughout the Roman period, it must be remembered, Jews continued to live in Palestine as an organic social entity. Similar differences which reflect a fundamentally distinct view of the history of Judaism can be seen in the various</page><page sequence="5">254 ABSTRACTS OF HEBREW LECTURES dates given of the beginning of the next period in Jewish History by Graetz, Dubnow and Dinur: the rise of the Jewish centre in Spain, the Crusades and Palestine's conquest by the Arabs. B. Dinur, Jerusalem If the writing of history is like formulating a national autobiography, it is possible to gauge changes in outlook and self appraisal by what different Jewish historians have singled out as turning-points in the history of the Jewish people. It is not always the explicit division of history into periods that counts; it is often possible to discover the historian's view by noticing the space and importance he devotes to an event, a generation or an aspect of life, while overlooking other things. It is usually a mistake to attribute this only to the abundance or scarcity of historical materials on a given point, the historian being limited in his choice by the materials at his disposal. This can be demonstrated by examples: Graetz did not mention the fact that the Jewish population of Russia numbered millions, or that modern Heb rew literature was created there etc.; Dubnow did not mention the yeshivot of Russia; Yavetz did not refer to the renaissance in the study of sciences in European communities in the thir teenth century. All these facts were known to the respective writers, but they did not regard them as worthy of discussion. There are three types of problems in which historians of the Jewish people show divergence of opinion: the emphasis on the cultural and religious aspect as against the political and social; the question of continuity in Jewish history or of breaks; the geographical dispersion raises the question whether the turning points in Jewish history are common to all centres. These three problems can be treated under two headings: i. What is the subject of Jewish history, whether it is one and continuous or changeable and constitutes thus a variety of histories ? ii. What is the character of the changes in time which induced historiographers to divide the history under discussion into periods? Jewish historiography can be divided into six periods, in each of which the subject matter and the contents of Jewish history were differently viewed. 1. The classical historiography of the Bible, which can be designated as 'Israel and Judah in their country and their inheritance'; 2. The period of the Second Temple. This period can be characterized by the title: 'The Jewish people in the Holy City and its distinctiveness'; 3. The Mishnah, Talmud and Geonim, a period which can be called 'Knesset Israel under foreign rule and in Exile'; 4. Medieval historiography in Europe, to be called: 'Jewish communities and their heritage in dispersion and suffering'; 5. The 'Haskala' Movement and the Emancipation; the title proposed for this period is: 'The Jews in the lands of their dispersion'; 6. The historiography of the latest generations. This period may bear the name: 'The whole Jewish people and its struggle for its fate and culture towards the Restoration of Israel'. The bulk of the paper is devoted to further characterizing and illustrating the distinctive traits in the historiography of each period, as hinted at in the 'slogan' given to each one of the periods. I. F. Baer, Jerusalem The two basic assumptions of our discussion are the following: a. The subject of Jewish history is a religious body which is established on national principles, or a national entity which is organized by means of ecclesiastical and confessional communities. b. It is possible to survey this subject as an organic unity which is related to the historical organisms surrounding it. In accordance with this criterion, Jewish history is divided into two great periods: i. the ancient period, in which the general historic subjects surrounding the Jewish people are Greece, Rome, Iran and, latterly, the Christian Church, as well, with their diverse religious and cultural trends, until the final destruction of the Roman Empire. ii. the long period beginning at the onset of the Middle Ages which comprises the history of peoples professing a monotheistic faith (Christianity and Islam), and on these foundations European history until the end of the 18th century developed. i. We ought to correct the distorted picture of the period of the Second Commonwealth obtained by most Christian theologians and the secular historians of Greece and Rome. In antiquity, the Jewish people appeared as a historic factor with a distinct creative power. It saw its function in announc ing to the world the faith in a single God, and in building a model social structure based on the doctrines of mono theism, with its moral and religious values. The faith of the Jewish State in the period of the Second Temple developed through contact with the political and philosophical doctrines of Greece. In the midst of this great period, two decisive events took place: the destruction of the Second Temple with its con sequences of limiting the Jewish peop^s political and religious freedom; and the rise of Christianity as a rival force in proclaiming a monotheistic religion. This resulted in the reduction of the political power of the national centre and led to an intensification of the ecclesiastical trends striving to expand and penetrate to the farthest borders of the Roman Empire, anticipate its des truction, and look to the establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven. ii. Jewish history in the Middle Ages was determined by the fact that the historic phenomenon the features of which were formed in antiquity continued to pursue its own road while separated from its natural soil. The historic forces striving for ecclesiastical expansion similar to the Christian church remained attached to the national body of the Jewish people. The socio-religious tradition which had been created in the Second Temple period now servedas armour to protect</page><page sequence="6">JOINT HISTORY SESSION 255 the existence of the Jewish people as a nation and a church, despite the fact that the natural elements on whose soil several items of the tradition had grown had ceased to exist. This explains the problems connected with Jewish existence in the Diaspora. A national body fortified by a dogmatic tradition, the subject of a complete religious outlook hoping for divine redemption, must preserve its individuality in the lands of its dispersion. A complete national-ecclesiastical body sends its limbs out to various political provinces and develops diverse traits through adaptation to special conditions of time and place. Diaspora history, with variations depending on the diversity of country, is marked by recurring forms of expan sion, of spiritual and economic creativity on alien soil and once again concentration on what is inside while withdrawing from hostile forces without, of a dispersal of the church in the provinces and a national concentration in Palestine, of sanctifying the name of God by making the supreme sacrifice, and of conversion, assimilation, and secularization. The expulsion of the Jews from Spain and most German towns and the revival of Palestinian centres at the end of 'the Middle Ages' and the beginning of 'the modern period' (in accordance with conventional concepts in European history) do not constitute a revolutionary turning point in Jewish history; the same problems and phenomena charac teristic of the Middle Ages recur in subsequent generations with changes corresponding to differences in time and place. Diaspora history can not be measured by a criterion of historic materialism unless the period of dispersion is conceived as being cut off from its origins which are rooted in antiquity. On the other hand, the historian can not accept the theological view tending to judge every period according to its relation to the one preceding it. The internal wealth of the historic process supports the application to Jewish history of Ranke's thesis that each and every period bears a direct relation to God. But even the historian who measures historic phenomena by a criterion of internal historic laws can not disregard the fact that in the early awakening of the human race values came into being for which later generations can not find substitutes. It is undeniable that to this very day we are duty bound to the moral and religious testament bequeathed to us by creative generations in antiquity, the biblical era and the periods of the Second Temple and the Mishna. The true student of history is engaged in a struggle in his encounter with all the periods and generations, and through this study a process of maturation takes place which is the be-all and end-all of history. Raphael Mahler, Tel Aviv The dependence of the history of the Jews in the Diaspora on their environment is responsible for the fact that the turning points in this history, more obviously than in that of a territorially concentrated nation, correspond to the changes in world history. On the premise that the socio economic structure constitutes the basis of all phases of human society, socio-economic developments should serve as the basic norm for periodization. Still we have to do justice to the fact that in a direct way the fate of the Jewish people in all times has been a consequence of the political tendencies prevailing in the countries of its domicile. Last but not least, the Jewish movements for Restoration, and in modern times the process of resettlement in Palestine, which lately culminated in the reestablishment of the Jewish State, have to be taken into account as landmarks, characterizing each respective period. In fact, starting from the new er . marked by the achievement of political independence, the periodization of any future history of the Jews will have to take as its basis the milestones in the development of the Jewish State as the growing national centre of the Jewish people all over the world. The following is a general scheme of periodization, based on the principles outlined above: Parallel periodization of the history of the Jews in the Diaspora and of world history 1.

BIBLE STUDIES SECTION Redaction and changes in biblical books E. Auerbach, Haifa Most biblical books were redacted and edited during a period which can be definitely demarcated as falling between 604 and 400 B.C.E. The certainty of this dating is due mainly to the issue of the Babylonian calendar. The books which were thus redacted and enlarged by the insertion of additions are the books of the Pentateuch, the historical books and such prophetic books as were written before the Babylonian Exile; the Hagiographa bear no evidence of similar changes. The redaction was prompted by change in outlook and in the conception of the world and of history, caused by the Dispersion. There are examples illustrating each aspect of the redaction.</page><page sequence="8">BIBLE STUDIES SECTION 257 Reuben and Judah in the Joseph-cycle S. E. Loewenstamm, Jerusalem The two most prominent brothers of the Joseph-cycle are Reuben and Judah, both of whom are described in two stories as acting consecutively (Gen. xxxvn: 18-29; xlh:36 xliii:14). In both stories it is Reuben who is depicted as the one who starts the action, and Judah as the one who brings it to a close. This duplication points to a complex pre history of the narratives. It may be surmised that the pro tagonist in the earliest crystallized versions of the stories was Reuben, Jacob's eldest son, i.e., the most prominent Israelite tribe in the early history of the Hebrew people. With the decline of Reuben's importance and the rise of Judah's, changes were introduced in the narratives. Reuben's role was reduced to preparing the groundwork for the action, whereas the final and decisive act was transferred and ascribed to Judah. This redaction gave a homogeneous cast to the narrative in Gen. xlii:29-xliii:14. The original Reubenite version can no longer be reconstructed and a pristine Judean version in which only Judah acts to obtain permission on behalf of the brothers to revisit Egypt probably never existed. The attempts of harmonistic exegetes to defend the ho mogeneity of the narrative in Gen. xxxvir.18-29 have not been convincing, and the Reubenite version of the story as reconstructed by scholars adhering to the document theory can not be disputed. However, their attempt to reconstruct a parallel Judean version in which Reuben plays no part has failed. The redactor of the story though transferring the final act to Judah has again preserved the original version which ascribed the initiation of the act to Reuben and deleted only Gen. xxxvH :28a, 29-30 from the Reubenite story. A later redactor restored the deleted verses and thus marred the homogeneity of the narrative. Elements Psychodramatiques dans les Recits Bibliques A.

The Aramaic translation of the Book of Isaiah as a commentary Y. Komlosh, Jerusalem The purpose of Jonathan ben Uzziel's translation of the Bible was in a sense one of mass education, which fact caused him often to provide commentary through paraphrasing the text. But despite interpretative intention, the translation contains numerous literal renditions of the original and etymological explanations which are important for a better knowledge of the biblical text. Jonathans translation of Isaiah is sometimes identical with those of all the other translators. There are a number of points in common between the Aramaic translation and the Isaiah text of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which indicates the existence of ancient traditions in Jonathan's translation of Isaiah. Sometimes the etymological analysis of the translation differs from the accepted understanding. אשום ואשאף (xlii : 14) has the meaning of 'to breathe air', whereas the Targum rendering is 'they will perish and be annihilated as one', having in mind the enemy. The Targumist introduces a change in person and number, and he derives the verbs in a different way from the accepted tradition. There are cases, however, where the Targumist finds by correct intuition the proper etymological meaning. Thus, for example, וכל הנספה (xm:15) is rendered following a version which apparently read וכל הנאסף. This is also the rendering of the LXX and the Peshitta. One traces the tendency to coordinate between the verbs in the verse from the grammatical point of view (1:29; xlii :24; xlviii:15). It is sometimes difficult to decide whether the changes in the translator's rendition are due to another version or to a special interpretation. E.g., it may be assumed that the rendering of the expression נצר נתעב (x1v:19) may be traced to the fact that the Targumist based himself on an ancient comment (Jer. Shebi'it, Chap. LV, XXXV, 4). Anthropomorphic expressions and such as are unbecoming were exchanged for more suitable ones like in the other translations. A large part of the changes stem from the fact that the translator eliminated every picturesque expression and all metaphors and did not translate parables but only the moral drawn from them (1:6, 25; vii:18; x:18; xxiv:34; xiv: 14) — in the examples cited the metaphors are completely omitted.</page><page sequence="9">258 ABSTRACTS OF HEBREW LECTURES On the other hand, there are examples of the picturesque expression appearing as a comparison directly after the moral, e.g. —, vii :4 : תרץ רברביא, דאי־נץ כאודיא מחעיא האלץ There are several kinds of additions. Sometimes the addition is designed to supplement a word for the purpose of simplifying the text, e.g., in xux:4; xxii:18; xli:25. On the other hand, there are instances where the addition has the nature of an actual paraphrase. Another kind of addition is the insertion of aggadic material, usually in contrast to Jerusalem translations, to serve as a commentary. In Isaiah vhi:2 Uriah the priest is, according to the translation, the symbol of a prophecy of doom while Zecha riah the son of Jeberchiah represents a prophecy of peace. This translation is based on interpretation by Rabbi Aqiva (,Sifrei, Deuteronomy xliii, 40, Makkot 24b. Lamentations Rabba to verse v:19). The principal ideas of Judaism, e.g. Tora, Messiah, and the hereafter, appear many times as a paraphrase in the translator's commentaries. economic ones). In Egypt, the most popular generic name for such associations was auvoSog. There can be little doubt that under Ptolemaic dominance, the Egyptian officials, military men, and merchants formed many such synodoi (obvoiSoi) in Judea, just as they did in other sections of the Mediterranean area and Asia Minor, where they were stationed. Our point is that the term knesset is the literal equivalent of synodos. The Great Synagogue, in turn, recalls the ruling body of the cartels of city and professional synodoi. Many of the associations owned the house where they met. This suggests that originally the synagogue was 'the house of the synodos' — bet ha-knesset. The basic difference between the knesset and the Hellenistic and Egyptian religious synodoi is that while the latter were dedicated to the cult of a deity other than the official god of the city, the knesset cultivated the Pharisaic interpretation of the Tora, as contrasted with the Sadducean one, enter tained by the Zadokite high priests. ANCIENT JEWISH HISTORY SECTION The Nature of the Great Synagogue (Knesset ha-Gedolah) H. Mantel, Tel Aviv Various theories, none of them satisfactory, have been offered as to the significance of the Talmudic tradition concerning the Great Synagogue: 1. that the tradition is not authentic or that the Great Synagogue was not a distinct institution; 1,. that the Great Synagogue was merely another name for the high priestly government; hi. that it was a national assembly which was summoned in times of crisis. L. Finkelstein develops the theory that the Great Synagogue (knesset ha-gedolah) was the Supreme Court of the non official Association of Hasidim founded by Ezra and was called knesset hasidim in the First Book of Maccabees. This view is essentially right, with certain modifications. It may be shown that 'knesset' was never a technical term for court, but that in Tannaitic literature it stands for the Pharisaic Association. In the days of Ezra, the religious association of his followers — which was organized along the lines of the Fathers' Houses — was known as the 'Commu nity' or 'Children of the Exile'. In the Hellenistic era, under the impact of altered social conditions, this group was apparently reorganized under the name knesset. In each city there was a local knesset, which occasionally sat in judgement over defaulting members, The central governing body in Jerusalem was called knesset ha-gedolah. The guiding principle of the knesset, like that of its predecessor, the Community of the Exile, was that the high priest was not the final authority in the Tora. Further light may be thrown on the organizational aspect of the knesset by noting that the Hellenistic world abounded with non-official religious associations (as well as social and The Sanhedrin and the Gerousia in the period of the Second Temple Y. Efron, Tel Aviv In the works of Josephus and in the New Testament, the Sanhedrin appears as a distinctly priestly hegemony, while in the Talmud it is described as a body whose membership and presiding officers always consisted only of Pharisee scholars. Recent scholars are inclined to reconcile the two views. One group postulates the existence of a supreme institution composed of various cells, which underwent certain changes. Another school prefers to suggest the existence of two or three different Sanhedria in order to consolidate divergent evidence by assuming the existence of parallel bodies. These systems rest, however, on a weak foundation. Talmudic tradition is heterogeneous and reveals different historical strata. In the light of its Palestinian sources, which are nearer and more faithful to ancient oral tradition, the Great Sanhedrin is associated with an ideal body of law which was only realized in a defective, fragmentary form after the ter mination of prophecy. Concrete examples of the appearance of the Sanhedrin are drawn from biblical accounts and based on theoretical assumptions. Its activity is never mentioned in practice from the beginning of the Hellenistic period to the end of the Second Temple. Members of the five generations of scholars preceding the Tannaim and their successors were called nasi ('president5) and av-bet-din ('senior judge of the court'); they issued regulations and decrees, decided upon various halakhot and passed judgement, apparently as courts of law. In their time the rulings of the Sanhedrin were no longer applied fully and in all categories; these were the rulings which completely eliminated 'controversy in Israel' (Palestine Talmud). However, according to the version of the Babylonian Talmud, or under its later influence or in its offshoots, the basic approach became obscured and the picture of a Sanhedrin existing uninterruptedly down to the period of the Amoraim emerged. This view was widely</page><page sequence="10">ANCIENT JEWISH HISTORY SECTION 259 accepted without reservation, and scholarly criticism regards it as representative of the entire Talmudic tradition. The existence of a central Sanhedrin is not evident in any other Jewish source from the SecondTemple period. Josephus and his sources, as well as references in certain documents, mention the people's Gerousia ('Council of Elders') in pre vious generations, but all traces of this body had vanished completely by the Hasmonean period. During the period of Roman rule, a council called boule was functioning in Jerusa lern. It consisted of the upper classes represented by leaders of the priesthood and circles of notables. Its role is partially clear and fits in well with the controversies on the eve of the Great Revolt. No detail alludes to any connection with the Talmudic Sanhedrin. Josephus used the term 'Sanhedrin' in numerous senses to designate government councils, con ventions, courts, and diverse Jewish and non-Jewish in stitutions. His account does not confirm the existence of a Sanhedrin as portrayed in the New Testament organized on the basis of the boule. Thus, the facts and descriptions in Josephus do not contradict the ancient Talmudic tradition preserved in Palestinian sources, nor do they support the Christian version which is rooted in the theological concept ion of the New Testament. Figures from the time of Sossius' conquest of Jerusalem B. Z. Lurie, Jerusalem Josephus Flavius relates that at the time of the conquest of Jerusalem (37 B.C.E.) the sons of Baba stood at the head of those loyal to Antigonus, and that there was a fierce battle between them and those who had come to terms with the rule of Herod and advocated surrender. The leader of this party was Shammai, Hillel's colleage. To the party of Baba's sons, i.e. the party of the Hasmoneans, two personages should be added who took an active part in the events of the tempestuous years of the Parthian conquest, the ex pulsion of the Parthians and the conquest of the kingdom by Herod. The first, a notable of the nation, chief justice (ay-bet-din) and Hillel's first colleague, is Menachem. Menachem was av-bet-din when Hillel was President of the Sanhedrin. At a certain time he left his position in the Sanhedrin and was replaced by Shammai. Fragmentary mentions in the Talmud make it clear that Menachem left to serve the king, i.e. he enlisted, and with him many of his pupils. His vigorous support of Antigonus and his call to battle, to defend the city against Herod and the Romans, caused a great ferment among the youths of Beit Hammidrash. Menachem enlisted, and with him went out two brigades of Beit Hammidrash students. Menachem and his students were killed in battle. The second personage, Antigonus' sister, we have heard about only en passant from Josephus Flavius. It is the first time a woman led freedom warriors. There is no doubt that she was an unusual personality, for she was able to conduct a war for five years against Herod, who was supported by Roman legions. The fortress of Hyrcania, located in the wilderness of Judea, near Qumran, was one of the three famous fortresses in Judea. It fell after a prolonged siege in which Herod himself participated. We retain only a legend about this siege : When all was lost, Antigonus' sister, the last of the Hasmoneans, climbed to the top of a tower, cried out scornfully at the Edumean slave breaking out against his masters, and threw herself from the tower. Herod brought her body to his camp and immersed it in honey. Antigonus' sister was a handsome person, as most of the Hasmoneans were, and since Herod was well known as an unbridled lecher, the legend came into being that after her death he approached her body. The Emergence of the Talmudic Academy in Babylonia Moshe Beer, Jerusalem The Babylonian Talmudic Academy was a religious and communal institution of outstanding importance. The greatest halakhic scholars devoting themselves to the clarifi cation of questions concerning Jewish law and actions in the religious courts were centred around it. When the head of the academy and his associates sat in judgement, their authority was recognized as a supreme religious tribunal. The heads of the academy also organized courses in halakha in the months of kalla, as well as lectures for the general public on the Sabbaths of festivals, etc. The heads of the academy and its scholars also played an important role in representing the Jews before the Persian authorities. They also filled top administrative posts in the Babylonian Jewish community. We may assume that the academy developed over a long period of years and crystallized into its final form not later than the beginning of the second half of the 3rd century C.E. We do not have sufficient evidence to trace this process. At any rate, it is clear that the Talmudic academy was not an outgrowth of the Sidra school as many scholars believe. The formation of the Talmudic academy was contingent on the consent of the exilarchs. This fact is most obvious in the emergence and development of the academy at Sura. How ever, the academy at Pumbedita came into being and existed, at least during the first decades of its formation, without either the consent or support of the exilarchs. The emergence of the Talmudic academy in Babylonia and the extent of its authority also stem from the fact that the central academy in Palestine was separated from the pat riarchate and began to crystallize as a more or less indepen dent institution. In the opinion of Sherira Gaon (Epistle of Sherira Gaon, Levin edition, p. 81, and especially addenda to the Epistle, (ibid., p. xix) Rav and Samuel were the first heads of Talmudic academies in Babylonia. But according to the tradition cited by the author of Seder Olam Zuta (Neubauer edition, p. 77), Rabbi Huna was the first head of an academy. A study of the structure of Rav's school and religious court in Sura reveals that he laid the principal foundations from which the Talmudic academy in Babylonia developed.</page><page sequence="11">260 ABSTRACTS OF HEBREW LECTURES ARCHAEOLOGY AND DEAD SEA SCROLLS SECTION The fortifications of Jaffa in the Hyksos period J. Kaplan, Tel Aviv During the fourth season of excavations at Jaffa, 1960, work was carried out inside the building of the Turkish hammam (public bath) situated at the edge of the northeastern portion of the ancient tell. A glacis made of layers of beaten earth and sun-dried clay bricks was excavated on this site. From contents of the layers of beaten earth and bricks it was inferred that the glacis dates from the 9th century B.C.E. at the latest. However, further excavations in the western area behind this glacis brought to light an earlier glacis which dates from the Middle Canaanite period, i.e., the times of the Hyksos. It is thus probable that somewhere at the top of the tell (west of the hammam), the main structures of the fort ifications of M. B. Jaffa exist at a great depth. For the purpose of digging up these fortifications, addi tional excavations were carried out, in 1963 and 1964, in the area behind and to the south of the hammam. At this spot, the upper section of an earthen embankment with a trapezoidal cross-section was discovered at a depth of about 3.30 metres below the surface. The outer facing of the embankment was covered with a hard shell made of blackish clay soil. As the work proceeded, it became clear that the embankment had extended from south to north, i.e., we had unearthed a section of the eastern side of the Hyksos compound which had encircled Jaffa and which resembled the Hyksos system of fortifications known from other places. A topographical survey of the tell and its surroundings suggests that more than half of the enclosure had been destroyed by the shore erosion caused by the gradual sinking of the coastline, a natural phenomenon long known to science. The Jewish Amphitheatre at Berenike, Cyrenaica S. Applebaum, Tel Aviv University Jewish life at Berenike (Benghazi, Cyrenaica) in the Roman period is illustrated by three Greek inscriptions, two of which are well known. They date respectively from the years 8 B.C.E., 25 C.E. and 56 C.E. The first two record resolutions passed by the organized Jewish community (the politeuma) of the city and its territory in honour of benefactors. In the third the synagogue of Berenike Jews expresses its thanks to its wardens and to other contributors, for their donations towards the restoration of the synagogue. The first two inscriptions refer to an 'amphitheatre'. The second is a stele to be set up in that building and dedicated to M. Titius; the first, also to be set up there, resolves to honour Decimus Valerius Dionysius for painting and plastering the same amphitheatre. What was this building ? Despite the differing opinions of scholars, I have no doubt, on the basis of the language used, that a Jewish building is meant, since its decoration was executed by Decimus not as a liturgy but as a 'present to the community'. The Greek word 'amphitheatre' was new when the inscription was set up, and this, to the best of my knowledge, is its earliest appearance in Greek epigraphy. Only in the 1st century B.C.E. were the first amphitheatres being erected in Rome. Some scholars have interpreted the plastering of the floor at Berenike as an indication that the building was roofed. This is not inevitable, as is proved by the plaster floor in the theatre of Caesarea Palaestinae in the same period. It is only necessary that the seats should have been arranged on opposite sides of the edifice, in a circle, or in an ellipse, for the name 'amphitheatre' to be apposite. The Greeks were acquainted with rectangular roofed assembly halls with internal benches ranged all round the walls as early as the 6th century B.C.E. (e.g. the Telesterion of Eleusis), and the Berenike building may well have been roofed, as meetings were held in it not only on festivals but also on new moons and sabbaths. Small roofed theatre-like buildings (odea) were used as assembly-places in Greek lands including Cyrenaica, but no instance of a roofed amphitheatre is known. On the other hand, a small rectangular assembly or prayer hall was found in the wall of Masada in the first season of excavation. Its roof had been supported by pillars and benches lined the interior walls, as in the Greek assembly halls built as late as the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C.E. at Delos and Notion. This hall dated from the Zealot occupation (66-73 C.E.) and below it was found an earlier Herodian hall (37-31 C.E.) with a basilical plan. The significance of the Zealot alteration was that — in contrast with the basilica which is a royal hall — the hall surrounded by benches is a democratic form. If the amphitheatre at Berenike was like the Zealot hall at Masada, its planning may well have resembled the Ekkles terion of Priene (c. 200 B.C.E.) whose seats were ranged on three sides and whose capacity was some 700 souls. Notes on the development of ancient Jewish art B. Kanael, Jerusalem The first attempt to create Jewish art with a distinctive character begins at the time of the First Temple and continues in the Persian period. It comes to an end after Alexander's conquest of Palestine. The second stage began at the end of the Hasmonean period, and it is marked by the appearance of Jewish symbols in the Pharisean spirit. The first stage of Jewish art is also distinguished by the special character of Jewish culture, especially in so far as it is a monotheism in which there is no visual representation. There was tension between the tendency to develop visual arts among the Jews and the opposite feeling that this goes contrary to the basic tenets of Judaism. An examination of the small objects found in Palestine of the Persian period, particularly the YHD coins, suggests that a syncretistic trend was in action, which went against the religious Puritanism of Ezra and Nehemiah. The encounter with Hellenism produced similar effects, although the first generation of Hasmonean rulers was careful not to use pagan symbols (thus Simon the Hasmonean, preparing the tombs at Modi'in).</page><page sequence="12">ARCHAEOLOGY SECTION 261 Human representation is found for the first time towards the end of the Hasmonean period in Jason's tomb in Jerusa lern. We find also there engravings of the menora with seven candles, which also appears on the coins of Mattityah Antigonos. Herod seems to have been careful about the use of human figures in the greater part of his reign. The ornaments which are seen at the base of the menora on the arch of Titus do not appear to be copied from the original. Philo, too, confirms our contention that during the Second Common wealth there was little visual art among the Jews, although this does not exclude the possibility that private manuscripts, of the Bible, for example, contained pictorial ornaments. Towards the end of the Second Commonwealth, the beginning of the second period in the development of Jewish art comes to light, and this time it is the type of symbolism approved by the Pharisees. This is the development which culminated in the synagogal art of the Talmudic period. The ark occupies a central place in this art, as well as the menora, the shofar, the lulav, etrog, etc. Among synagogues richly ornamented we may mention Capernaum, where besides the Jewish symbols we also find the hippocampus and the medusa, the function of which is chiefly ornamental. The art of Dura Europos is best explained, in the writer's view, as traditional Jewish, with certain modifications and additions which could be expected to occur in a provincial and fairly distant community. The book of model drawings, from which the artists presumably copied, did not contain details which were required to fill the huge space of the walls; these were supplemented from the pagan environment. Jewish Background of Synagogue Symbols J. Braslavi, Tel Aviv A disturbing problem in early Jewish art is the significance of the mythological beasts, such as centaurs, dolphins, sea horses, sea-goats etc. inserted therein. Religious, magic and eschatological symbolism is usually sought in the motifs of early Jewish art, but it would seem that not enough attention has been paid to the 'Midrashic criterion' based on biblical authority, which motivated Jewish art to borrow secular and mythological motifs from the surrounding Hellenistic- Roman pagan art. Let us take as an architectural example the three portals in the facade of the synagogue, borrowed from the fagades of Syrian pagan shrines. If we seek the 'Midrashic criterion' that influenced this 'copying', we will find that it is based on Proverbs 1:21 ('at the entrance of the ... gates she speaks...'), just as the setting up of synagogues 'on the height of the city' is based on 'on the top of the walls she cries out' (ibid.) and on 'to set up the house of our God' (Ezra ix :9). Another architectural example is the synagogue quarried in rock at the bottom of a narrow ravine in Kefar Hanania, which is contrary to the customary 'height of the city'. The biblical authority for this is 'Out of the depths I cry to Thee, O Lord!' (Psalms cxxx:l). Among the ornamental motifs should be considered the censer which appears alongside the shofar, and the lulav and ethrog which accompany the candelabrum. Goodenough sought in vain an incense-burning function for the censer in early synagogues, but if we seek the 'Midrashic criterion' we will find that it served as a symbol of the Day of Atone ment (Lev. xvn:12) just as the shofar symbolized the New Year and the lulav and ethrog symbolized the Feast of Tabernacles. As to the mythological beasts, they too were inserted into early Jewish art by the 'Midrashic criterion', based on biblical authority or allusions. The centaurs are sons of Kenan (Gen. v:9). 'Adam, Seth and Enosh' were made in the image of man but 'from that time forth, centaurs' (Mid rash Bereshit Rabba). This is an instructive example of how traditional Judaism, and not the Hellenized element, could take mythological figures and fit them into its legend. And it may be assumed that from the Midrashic world of legend the centaurs found their way into Jewish art as well. Another example of the introduction of Greek mythology via the 'Midrashic criterion' into the traditional Jewish world of legend is the 'siren'. '... And of the living creatures that are in the waters' (Lev. x1:10-ll) — 'implies the siren' (Sifra Debi-Rav), but since the siren is an 'abomination' (Lev. ibid.) it did not penetrate early Jewish art. The dolphins, 'which bear and foster as does man' (Tos. Bekhorot) and 'breed and multiply as do people', and 'they are children of the sea' (B. Bekhorot), appear in Greek mythology as 'horses' harnessed to the chariots of the sea-gods, or as their mounts. If we look for the 'Midrashic criterion' which introduced the dolphins into the early Jewish world of legend and art, we must find in them 'thy horses,... thy chariot of victory' (Hab. hi:8), the horses upon which God, so to speak, rides: 'Thou didst trample the sea with thy horses, the surging of mighty waters' (ibid. 111:15). The 'half horse and half fish' or 'half goat and half fish' in the frieze of the synagogue at Capernaum is reminiscent of the 'monster' on the stem of the candelabrum in the Arch of Titus in Rome, but since the figure in the Arch of Titus could be the fruit of imagination of Roman artists it is difficult to find an identification between it and the 'monster' at Capernaum. Goodenough identifies it with the Leviathan, but it does not fit the biblical description of 'Leviathan the fleeing serpent' (Is. xxvn:l). It is perhaps the'sea-goat'that was the Leviathan's prey (Baba Batra 74a). Trees of life, ' Weltenbaum' and the gardener in Hodayot VIII H. M. I. Gevaryahu, Jerusalem The discussion centres around the allegorical עצי חיים ('trees of life'), עצי עולם ('trees of the world' — ' Welten bäum') and their gardener, allusion to which is found in the Hodayot ('thanksgiving') scroll. This tree-symbol is apparently a reference to a select sect. A close examination of the relevant textual details will help us differentiate between the usages of more ancient sources and the innova tions of the author of the scrolls. i. It is immediately noticeable that the author here employs the plural עצי חיים (as well as the plural עצי עולם) in</page><page sequence="13">262 ABSTRACTS OF HEBREW LECTURES juxtaposition to the biblical עץ חיים, which appears seven times in the singular form. Isaiah apparently hints at this singular tree (lxv:22). Might we not assume that the authors belonging to an elect group of saintly people may have affected his metaphor ical use of the term 'trees of life' in the Hodayot scroll? This term appears later to have been borrowed by the author of 'Psalms of Solomon'. ii. We may also note that the author of Hodayot switches from 'trees of life' to a 'world-tree' (Weltenbaum). A classical description of the cosmic properties of the 'world tree' is given in Hodayot vi, against the background of heaven, earth and she'01. It is legitimate to compare the dimensions of the cosmic trees of Daniel iv and of Hodayot with the one in the Epos of Era. iii. New terms, like מעין רו, מעין דיים, מי קדש, also appear in Hodayot viu. Thus, in contrast to the biblical מים דים (as opposed to 'still water' from a well), the spring in our context is more closely identical with the global aspect of the 'water of life' and 'holy water'. To the best of our knowledge, the author of Hodayot is the first to speak of 'holy water' in the cosmic sense and within the context of Jewish literature. This motif of 'holy water' appears also in Mesopotamian sources. The author of Hodayot, apparently employing ancient Jewish traditions preserved in the Zohar, which referred to the struggle between pure and impure waters, went a step further. He sought to establish a dichotomy between מי קדש ('holy water') and other waters nurturing the ordinary עצי מים ('trees growing at the water-side'). iv. The concept of the 'gardener' also represents the author's yearning for a return to the pristine state of the Garden of Eden, wherein man had been placed to work and keep watch. This garden, as well as the concept of the עצי קדש plays a part also in Mesopotamian records, as shown in Widengren's assembled material . v. We later encounter the description of the gardener in his irrigation of the ditches (!י... ומטע עצידם על משקלו השמש...'), implying that the garden is meant to be oriented in line with the sun, i.e. to the east. The Sun-god in the sacred garden is mentioned in Meso potamian sources. An even more definite expression of the orientation of the holy trees is to be found in the Pyramid texts. vi. In the gardener motif, possible support may be found for the contention that the 'I' in the Hodayot scroll was originally an individual allusion rather than a collective one. Further support may be gained for this point of view from a comparison with tree motifs in ancient dreams, and from the tree symbols in the addenda to Daniel. The Nabonaid prayer, the only one so far published from Cave 4, hints at the world tree in the dream of the king which Daniel interpreted, a further corroboration of the claim that Daniel's Nebuchadnezzar bears some semblance to the historical Nabonaid. The comparison of biographical inscriptions generally, and the type of 'ideal biographies' particularly, lends support to the concept that the gardener possesses elements of the leader of the sect, and perhaps also of its founder. TALMUD AND RABBINICS SECTION The nature and scope of the Book She'eltot S. K. Mirsky, New York The statement made by Abraham B. Daud in his Sefer haqabala (Neubauer 1, p. 63) on the nature of the book She'eltot misled many a scholar to look for the reason why it deals with a number of commandments and leaves out the rest. It was already suggested by A. Kaminka that it is a book of lectures held in the synagogue of the Babylonian Academy on Sabbath and holidays. In my edition of the She'eltot, the nature of this book as a book of lectures is clearly demonstrated. There is, however, another point which seems to me clearly proven and that is that this book, though reduced to writing in the early part of the Gaonic period (the middle of the 8th century), is of Amoraic origin and merely edited, not written, by R. Aha of Shabaha. It contains what was called hilkhot tzibur (see Sabbath 139 a, cf. Sanhedrin 7 b.) The name she'elta seems to be taken from Daniel 1v:4 and to indicate halakhot which were discussed among the inner circle of scholars and for mulated in the manner to be quoted in a public lecture. Only in this light will the statement made by R. Nahman b. Isaac (Pesahim 33 a and ibid. 105 b) be understood. A clear distinction was drawn between halakhot taught in the academy to students and halakhot taught publicly in the synagogue of the academy. There were two forms of lectures: methivta and pirqa, the former for students and the latter for thepublic. In examining the differences, both in text and in the halakhic decisions, between similar sugyot in She'eltot and in the Babylonian Talmud, it became clear to me that the She'eltot is not taken from the Talmud, as heretofore assumed, but that it was independently formed as pirkey. It remained in the archives of the Babylonian Academy until R. Aha of Shabaha who was a resh kala took it with him when he went to Eretz Israel and edited it there. The hesitation in giving hilkhot tzibur in the hands of the untrained is the reason for the delay in its appearance. This gave rise to the strange legend mentioned by R. Menahem Hameiri in the introduction to his Beth habehirah, concerning the She'eltot. The date of compilation of the tractate 'Kalla rabbati' B. de Vries, Tel Aviv Most scholars — most recently Epstein in his grammar of Babylonian Aramac — assume, on the basis of A. Apto witzer's article in REJ 57 (1909), p. 245-248, that the tractate of Kalla rabbati, as the book of Shimmusha rabba, dates from the Gaonic period, and reject the view of M. Friedman in his introduction to the addenda to Seder Eliyahu Zuta, p. 15, that the tractate was compiled in the school of Rava, who is frequently mentioned in it. Pursuant to AptowitzcEs approach it has even been conjectured that the Rava referred to here is the famous disciple of Yehudai Gaon and not the Rava of Mahoza, since there is no complete agreement between the statements of Rava in the Gemara and those in the tractate of</page><page sequence="14">TALMUD AND RABBINICS SECTION 263 Kalla rabbati; and in general, the author of the tractate apparently made use of other traditions than those expounded in our Gemara. However, the problem has not been properly investigated from the points of view of language, style and form, The purpose of this paper is to defend Friedman's view and to adduce proof by presenting linguistic (terminological) and stylistic and formal indications (the nature of the discussion). In the present author's view, the work dates from the early period of the Amoraim and evidently is a sort of 'Gemara for beginners'. He also demonstrates by adducing examples from Talmudic usage that there is a difference between the styles of Kalla rabbati and Shimmusha rabba. Inheritance laws and after-life E. E. Urbach, Jerusalem There are several striking changes in Jewish inheritance laws which occurred over a period of generations. The rules concerning inheritance as presented in the Tora and taught in the Mishna preserved the perpetuation of the name of the deceased in his inheritance and assured the maintenance of the inheritance within the family and the tribe. These rules were relaxed in various respects. The pentateuchal law says regarding daughters inheriting their father's property where there are no sons, 'only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married' (Num. xxxvi:6). This ruling, which had parallels in Baby Ionian law, corresponded to the institution of '6jukXt1po&lt;; in Greek law and was apparently observed in the Jewish Diaspora (Book of Tobit 6; 10-11): Philo, Laws II 120), but it was abolished in Palestine in the period of the Tannaim, who regarded it as a sort of temporary provision of the settle ment era (Sifra, Emor, iv 5; Bava Batra 120b). At the end of the Second Temple period we hear of frequent instances of sons who had misbehaved being disinherited and of the dedication of property to heaven (Shabbat 127b; Bava Batra 133b; Nedarim, v 7). Parallel to these changes in the laws of inheritance we find a transformation in the outlook on reward. The reward promised in the Tora is 'that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days' (Deut. xxn:7) and 'that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land' (ibid. vi:18), in accordance with which an ancient Mishnaic ruling teaches 'whoever performs a single act of piety is benefited and his days are lengthened and he inherits the land' (Qiddushin, ch. I Mishna 10). But from Hillel's time on, added emphasis was put on securing a portion in the world to come (Avot, ch. II, Mishna 7). The promise of the Tora'he shall live by them' (Lev. xvm:5) is translated by Onkelos as 'he shall live an eternal life by them'. The terms of inheritance are extended to apply to the hereafter and Scriptural passages discussing inheriting the land are interpreted accordingly (Sanhedrin, x, 1; Avot, v ,29); a man's share in this life is perceived as his portion in the world to come (Berakhot 61b; Tanhuma, Tavo 11). The perpetuation of a name and tribal survival is no longer a matter of inheritance. This change is also attested to by the inscriptions on the grave stones at Beit Shearim: Sehpupi 'may your portion be good'; Eupopog 'the possessor of a good portion'. A person assures himself this portion by his deeds. By giving alms to the poor and dedicating his property without con sideration for the laws of inheritance a man puts away treasures in this life for the world to come. On the one hand, this view about a man's share in the hereafter was based on popular beliefs on the relations between the dead and the living and on certain burial customs; on the other, it reinter preted them and introduced new meanings into them. The view concerning the absolute bond of the dead man to his family, heirs and bequest ceased to exist. His portion in the hereafter does not depend on recalling his name through his property. The introduction of wills completes the abolition of this bond. The establishment of the new legal institution did not happen all at once. The sages were not pleased at disinheriting legal heirs, and only R. Simeon ben Gamliel expressed himself in the following manner about this custom: 'if his sons did not act properly, may he be blessed for the good he has done' (Bava Batra vm, 5). The conservative scholar Eliezer did not distinguish between the gifts of a healthy and a sick man CBava Batra ix, 9). A clear definition of a will is supplied only during the generation of the sages of Usha (Bava Batra, vn, 6, 7; Tosefta, Bava Batra vm, 10; Pe'a, 111, 9; Bava Batra, 135b). Again, it was Simeon ben Gamliel who promulgated the rule 'a will cancels a will but a gift does not cancel a gift' (Bava Batra vm, 7). It was apparently not just by chance that during the period when the institution of the will developed and became crystallized there were great acts of benevolence and a tendency to dedicate all property to charity and the poor — a tendency which led to the enactment of the' Taqqana of Usha'. Despite recent statements made concerning this matter (Isaac Baer, Tarbiz, 1962), there is no evidence of the pene tration of Greek laws into Jewish tradition with respect to ancient inheritance rules. On the one hand, there are dif ferences regarding basic matters, e.g., inheritance by the mother's relatives, inheritance by the father, and adoption, and, on the other, similar matters are so general that parallels may be found for them in every legal system. This is not the case, however, with regard to the institution of wills — the diyateke. Not only the Greek term, but the form of the will display — as has already been proved — the distinct influence of Roman-Hellenistic law. The ground was prepared for the reception of this influence by the change which occurred in the view concerning man's share in the hereafter. Tales about Rabban Gamaliel in the Mishna and Tosefta Ben Zion Wacholder, Cincinnati This paper proposes to show that Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi, the editor of the Mishna, made use of a collection of tales and stories whose hero was Rabban Gamaliel II of Javne (Jamnia). The very first paragraph of the Mishna Berakhot opens with a tale about Rabban Gamaliel and his sons. (Unless otherwise stated, the reference in Tannaitic texts is always to Rabban Gamaliel II, who flourished circa 80-115 C.E.) Mishna Berakhot II, 5-7, records three stories about him, of which only one deals with the legal problem at hand. The other two tales were part of the source from which the digression was</page><page sequence="15">264 ABSTRACTS OF HEBREW LECTURES taken. This evidently was the same source from which Tosefta Yom Tov, II, 12-16, has extracted five tales concern ing Rabban Gamaliel. The hypothesis that a collection of stories about Rabban Gamaliel was used by Judah Ha-Nasi gains some confirmation from a statistical analysis of the tales recorded in the Mishna and Tosefta. In the Order Zera'im, 18 stories are recorded, 7 of which deal with Rabban Gamaliel; in Mo'ed, 33 stories, 13 of Rabban Gamaliel. In the Tosefta, too, the number of tales about Rabban Gamaliel exceed by far any other Tanna, though not in the same proportion as in the Mishna. Is it possible then to deduce that Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi, the editor of the Mishna, deliberately intended to build up the prestige of the Nasi? But not only the Mishna, but also the Tosefta as well as the other Tannaitic records all contain a disproportionate number of stories about Rabban Gamaliel. The reason may be either because these texts follow the lead of the Mishna or that they also made use of the same collection of Rabban Gamaliel's tales. From the contents of the stories, scattered throughout the Tannaitic texts, it is possible to get a glimpse into the nature of the patriarchal collection of tales. These tales related to every aspect of the Nasi's life, including the most intimate. Some of them dealt with the Nasi's family or slaves. It is evident that the practices and customs preserved in the Mishna and Tosefta were recorded by professional scribes, whose names are occasionally given. The halakha as reflected in Ben-Sira L. I. Rabinowitz, Jerusalem The Wisdom of Ben-Sira was written in the period between the close of the biblical canon and the beginning of the development of the Oral Law. In other words it may be regarded as belonging roughly to the period of the men of the knesset gedola, during whose era, and as a result of whose activities, the Tora became, for the first time, 'the in heritance of the congregation of Jacob'. Although Ben-Sira is not a legal work, but belongs to the class of 'wisdom literature' which deals with ethics and modes of conduct, it nevertheless indirectly reflects the halakha as it was practised in the writer's period. In this paper, the author attempts to establish the state of the halakha as reflected in Ben-Sira's work. He comes to the conclusion that, although in general the legal pattern is that of the Written Law, here and there signs of the halakha belonging to the Oral Law can be detected. 'Hammering' as one of the principal labours forbidden on the Sabbath Y. Gilat, Tel Aviv Despite the ancient origin of most of the Sabbath pro hibitions, it would appear that the basic principles of the Sabbath observances and rules as they appear in Talmudic precepts were first established by the Tannaim and in the generations following them. The conditions which apply to the thirty-nine principal forbidden labours, e.g., the sti pulation that the act must be performed in its usual way, that it should be necessary in itself, that it should be done deli berately, etc., are based on the principle: 'the Tora forbids skilful workmanship'. This rule is not found before the period of the Amoraim. Some Tannaim who transmit ancient traditions, such as R. Eliezer and R. Judah, even postulate that a man is held guilty also for a work which is not necessary in itself. According to R. Eliezer, even a mit'asseq, i.e. one who does an unintentional work out of mistake or inattention, is guilty; R. Eliezer does not distinguish between a work performed in its normal way and one which is done with a difference. It thus seems that the ancient law regarded forbidden work on the Sabbath as carrying guilt no matter how it is per formed. The conditions which limit the application of these prohibitions and which are based on abstract legal principles appeared only after the destruction of the Second Temple, and are the result of the systematic study developed at the schools of the Tannaim and Amoraim. The Mishna Shabbat vii:2 which lists the 39 principal forbidden works does not belong to the ancient stratum. The list was debated, changed and added to by various sages. The act of hammering also underwent a certain develop ment. It was first defined as the blow coming at the end of a work, but was enlarged to include work done with living beings, such as manipulating an abscess; according to the Palestinian Talmud it also includes the treatment of food stuffs. It is said that R. Yohanan and Resh Laqish used to refer to hammering forbidden works which they could not relate to any other principle (Yer. Shabbat xn :2). However, the statement in Mishna Shabbat xn:l proves that at first delivering a blow with a hammer was understood in accordance with its literal meaning, as one of the customary acts connected with building, like the operations of striking with a mallet and drilling which are mentioned there. Also, if we compare paragraph 1 of the Mishna (ibid.) to paragraph 2 adjacent and similar to it, we learn that 1 contains a list of acts construed as one labour: building is the principal and striking a blow with a hammer, etc., are its derivatives. Thus we see that the writer of the ruling in Mishna Shabbat Chapter vn:l, who listed the principal forbidden labours in accordance with formulae enumerating their order, with which various kinds of artisans were familiar, regarded striking a blow with a hammer an operation belonging to building and added it to the same group as building, wrecking, etc. How ever, the writer of the ruling in Shabbat Chapter vii:2 listed it as a separate principal labour, unlike the writer of the ruling in Shabbat Chapter xh:1, who considered it only as a sort of operation of the builder. It may be that formulations like 'building is like striking with a hammer' are the reason the Amoraim divested the expression 'striking with a hammer' of its literal meaning and gave it a new interpretation as an act denoting the end of a labour and the preparation of an article for its proper use. It is possible that a factor supporting the new definition of 'striking with a hammer' stemmed from the fact that despite the acceptance of the prohibition against making and repairing an article as a principal labour, like all principal</page><page sequence="16">TALMUD AND RABBINICS SECTION 265 labours, its prohibition was not included among the thirty nine labours and it was also difficult to find any connection with or support for it among the principal labours. The new significance given to striking a blow with a hammer clearly distinguished it from the act of building and emphasized it as the source for holding a person culpable for all the acts considered forbidden because of the ruling against making or repairing an article. The order and authorship of the first chapter of Mishna Nazir D. Weiss-Halivni New York The clause concerning the Nazarite who is like Samson seems to be out of place in Mishna Nazir 1,2. The comparison in the clause of a Nazarite like Samson with a life-long Nazarite, before the possibility of a life-long Nazarite was stated, prompted the B. Talmud to suggest that there is a lacuna in this Mishna. The late Professor Epstein held that in the original order the subject of a Nazarite who is like Samson came after Mishna 4, after the subject of the life-long Nazarite, as it is in the Tosefta; and that 'Rabbi, for some reason, changed the order' (Epstein does not give the reason) 'but left the language intact; hence, the impression of a lacuna in this Mishna'. Since all of the Mishnas in this chapter belong to the school of R. Judah, the clause covering a Nazarite who is like Samson also should be attributed to him. Our analysis leads us to different conclusions. In brief: the clause under discussion comes from the school associated with the Sifrei Zuta (R. Eliezer Ben Jacob?) and disagrees with R. Judah in two major points: 1. That a life-long Nazarite is one who takes upon himself to be a Nazarite for thirty days with a provision to constantly renew his vow; 11. According to this clause, a Nazarite like Samson is forbidden to defile himself, while according to R. Judah he is permitted. This is thus not a case of a Mishna merely transposed from one place to another, all stemming from the same school — as Professor Epstein thought — but rather the case of a clause torn out of context and inserted in the midst of opinions emanating from a different school. The compiler chose the second Mishna for the insertion because it contains the law: 'If a man says: I will be an abstainer from grape stones ... he is pledged to every rule of the Nazarite vow'. The purpose was to contrast the Nazarite like Samson with one who says he wants to abstain from grape stones; that although one who says he wants to abstain from grape stones is nevertheless 'pledged to every rule of the Nazarite vow' — if he specifies that he wants to be only like Samson, he is only a partial Nazarite and if he was defiled, he does not bring an offering. The order in the Mishna is different from the order in the Tosefta. In the Mishna, the order of the first two Mishnas is determined by the principle stated at the beginning of the chapter: 'Any substitute for a Nazarite vow is as binding as the Nazarite vow itself; while in the Tosefta the order is determined by the duration of the Nazarite vow, such as two vows, as many as there are hours in the day, etc. It follows, therefore, that no proof can be adduced from the Tosefta as to the order of the Mishna. The Palestinian tradition and the Halakhic teaching of Rabbi Pappa Tsevi Dor, Jerusalem I. The school of Rava and Rabbi Pappa. It is well known that the Palestinian Amoraim, and especially those of Rabbi Johanan, occupied a considerable place in the teachings of the Babylonian Amoraim at all times and in all the Talmudic academies. Palestinian traditions occupy a large part in the halakhic teachings of Rabbi Pappa, more so than with other Babylonian Amoraim of his generation. Rabbi Pappa devoted con siderable attention to explaining and interpreting them as well as to refuting and settling various points about them, and sometimes he even discussed their source. In some cases, his Palestinian traditions differ in form and content from the versions expounded in other schools in Babylonia and Palestine. Some traditions taught by him also differ in form and original meaning from the versions preserved in the Palestinian Talmud. We are especially interested in Rabbi Pappa's teachings because he was an old disciple of Rava's, his spokesman and loyal to his school. Rava, too, had a strong predilection for Palestinian sources; we may consequently bracket both men together and speak of one school with a strong attachment for the teachings of the Palestinian Amoraim, the school of Rava and Rabbi Pappa. It would appear that the teachings of Rava himself were for Rabbi Pappa an important source for the traditions of the Palestinian Amoraim. II. The traditions of Abbahu. Just as his teacher Rava, Rabbi Pappa made frequent use of Palestinian traditions attributed to Rabbi Johanan, but he also dealt with the statements of other Palestinian Amoraim. Rabbi Pappa expounded numerous Palestinian traditions attributed to Rabbi Johanan, and these, too, are for the most part the same as those transmitted by Rabbi Abbahu in Rabbi Johanan's name. This fact is more noticeable in his teachings than in those of Rava or other Amoraim of his generation. He sometimes rejected Palestinian traditions appearing with out specific attribution in the Babylonian Talmud, or trans mitted in Rabbi Johanan's name by other Palestinian Amo raim, in favour of traditions which Rabbi Abbahu cited in Rabbi Johanan's name. in. Ancient anonymous references and Palestinian discussions. We also find in Rabbi Pappa's teachings ancient anonymous references dealing with interpretations of Palestinian tra ditions. Sometimes there are complete Palestinian discussions to which Rabbi Pappa added his own comments for the purpose of settling those Palestinian traditions around which the discussions were centered. This phenomenon is not found in the teachings of other Amoraim of his generation, with the excep tion of Rava.</page><page sequence="17">266 ABSTRACTS OF HEBREW LECTURES Similarly, we sometimes find Palestinian elements, in their original form or with changes, woven into the halakhic teachings of Rabbi Pappa. This is also to be found in Rava,s teachings. Rava and Rabbi Pappa must have exerted con siderable influence on the scholars of their time and those who followed by the fact that they disseminated the doctrines of the Palestinian Amoraim. Mishna and Tosefta as used by the Halakhic Midrashim E. Z. Melamed, Jerusalem This paper reports results of a research into the various quotations of Mishna and Tosefta which occur in the collec tions of halakhic midrashim. Some 400 quotations occur in Tor at Kohanim; 200 in Sifrey of Deuteronomy; Mekhilta of R. Shimo'n bar Yohay contains some 170 quotations; many such quotations are also found in the midrashim which stem from the school of R. Yishma'el. Similarly, the quotations which occur in the halakhic midrashim of the Babylonian and Palestinian Talmud. The various terms used for introducing the quotations are discussed, and the ways in which the wording of a quotation is sometimes woven into the texture of the midrash, or two quotations grafted upon each other are illustrated, as well as other changes made in the wording of quotations. Ques tions of establishing the original text of the Mishna and Tosefta by aid of the quotations are also dealt with. [In the meantime, the complete study has appeared as a book entitled The relationship between the halakhik Midra shim and the Mishna and Tosephta (Jerusalem, 5727), p. 200.] JEWISH LAW SECTION The Jaws of Tsedaqa (Almsgiving) in law practice in Israel I. Kister, Jerusalem Tsedaqa (almsgiving) is an obligation of the individual as well as a duty of the group, and in a certain sense is among those legal obligations which may be enforced. In Israel, judgements have been given, based on the laws of tsedaqa, to compel a person to aid members of his family, as being within the meaning of maintenance to which the personal status law applies. The extent to which the obligation of aiding may be enforced has been discussed; meanwhile, a aw has been enacted which is based to a large degree on hose principles of tsedaqa. In addition, the courts have dealt with undertakings and vows to charity within the framework of maintenance laws of tsedaqa; with wills for charitable purposes; and with charitable endowments. In the paper, wills for charitable purposes and their construction are discussed. The laws of tsedaqa deal with the obligation to return alms which have been received without justification. This question has been discussed in several judgements, the aid having been given either by individuals or by social welfare agencies. The matter has now been established by the laws of Israel. Static and dynamic conceptions in Jewish Law T. Arieli, Tel Aviv The terms 'static' and 'dynamic1 are current in general legal literature for designating the difference between a law which deals with concrete physical objects and functional law which is interested in developing, changing reality (Spengler, Fehr). Fehr emphasizes that the concepts static or dynamic should not be regarded as absolute categories but as desig nating trends. Jewish law, before the conclusion of the Talmud and for many generations afterwards, bears the stamp of being static and is noted for a plastic, concrete approach which sees matters from the point of view of what 'is', of what exists and is actually on hand. The extreme static condition is embodied in various halakhic regulations. Animals (moving'hafez') do not acquire possession. The assumption that a previous situation continues is the basis of nearly every kind of any presumption ('hazaka') especially of 'a presumption of existence'. The concrete, physical conception limits possession, the obligation and the lien regarding an object which has not yet begun to exist and a person not yet born. Just as it is impossible to convey or acquire the title to a non-existent object so it is impossible to waive the claim to such an object. Alternate possession must proceed from the 'concrete existence of a thing' and not 'by virtue of discussion'; possession of a coin is only acquired alternately as metal. From the point of view of the static conception, an expected profit is an object which does not yet exist, and this is a source of difficulties in establishing a partnership of merchants or artisans. The static quality is expressed in the distinction between the 'possessed object' and 'the object to be possessed' in cases of the inheritance of the eldest son and collecting the sum listed in a woman's marriage contract. In principle, it is impossible to transfer the debt of a lender accepting a verbal promise to pay and of a lender who takes a note. (Powers of attorney appear later and attain recognition chiefly in the period of the Geonim.) The fact that Talmudic law ignores rights unless they are concerned with articles as liens or linked to something physical also finds expression in its terminology: a 'right' usually has a religious or procedural significance, and nearly always occurs in the singular. The Dynamic Conception The effect of the new dynamic conception can be discerned in six manifestions: a) Severance from the tangible and practical base 1. The transformation of an incidental possession (kinyan agab) from an actual possession to a bare form. 2. The recognition of the commercial and economic rights of individuals.</page><page sequence="18">JEWISH LAW SECTION 267 b) Separation of the present and future Numerous solutions of the codifiers regarding an object which has not yet come into being and the undertaking of a partnership. c) Severance from the causa The undertaking of an abstract obligation by a verbal and written execution and by a transfer note. d) Obscuring the personal factor in establishing an obligation The presenting of a bearer note on the basis of accepted commercial practice, and the abolition of the difference between an obligation and a lien. e) A new conception of causality in the Law of Civil Wrongs Entrenchment of the rule: He who causes damage, even indirectly, perpetrates a civil wrong. f) A new evaluation of the property rights of the married woman with regard to her labours in the acquisition of common property. The order of succession in Jewish law Seiden's argument against Origen. A. Ehrman, Jerusalem John Seiden, in the Prolegomena to his book De succession ibus in bona defuncti ad leges Ebraeorum, sharply criticizes the Church Father Origen on account of the latter's inter pretation of Num. xxvn:8-ll (Homilia XXII). Selden's strictures are directed mainly to the following two questions: 1. Daughter's right of succession. Origen states that the biblical order of succession has been accepted by the whole world. This is challenged by Seiden, who points out that, in biblical law, a daughter inherits only if there is no son, whereas Roman law recognizes the equality of son and daughter. 2. Father's right of succession. Origen does not list the father in the order of succession, thus disregarding rabbinic tradition (the father has precedence over the brother of the deceased); Seiden argues that Origen was wrong to ignore rabbinical Bible exegesis. References are made to Jewish and non-Jewish sources bearing on Origen's time which show that the non-Jewish law of inheritance (i.e., the Roman-Provincial law current in the 'world' of Origen) was, essentially, not different from a particular line of Jewish tradition that obtained in circles familiar to Origen. More particularly, sources are adduced to show that, in Jewish tradition, there existed a tendency to equalize the rights of son and daughter (and this trend may well have crystallized into 'law' in certain sectarian groups); on the other hand, it appears that comparable non-Jewish law did not accord unreserved equality of rights to the daughter. As to the father's right of succession, it is important to note that the Bible itself does not mention the father as an heir. Selden's criticism that Origen ought to have taken rabbinic tradition into account here would seem to be unwarranted, especially in view of the fact that ancient Greek law apparently did not recognize the father as an heir, either (later, Byzantine Emperors denied the father a right of succession). Courts as expropriators H. Cohn, Jerusalem It is a matter of common knowledge that the opinions of Talmudical scholars are divided on almost every question of law which arose for discussion or decision. More often than not, the scholars give their respective reasons for the opinions they hold; and where such reasons are not given by them selves, subsequent discussions provide such reasons ex post facto. This paper is an attempt to trace the personal views and approaches of two great Talmudical scholars, R. Yitshak and R. Elazar, from the different reasonings of each of them, in their dispute over the origin of the rule that property which the court has expropiated is considered to be no longer the property of the previous owner but that of the person in whom the court has vested it. The fact that R. Elazar bases this rule on a precedent reported in the Book of Joshua (chapter xix, verse 51), when lands were expropriated for equitable distribution among the people as a whole, tends to show that, in his view, the ex propriation powers of the court are of a public-law nature, to be exercised for the good of the general public. On the other hand, R. Yitshak's preference for another precedent reported in the Book of Ezra (chapter x, verse 8) under which the confiscation of goods was threatened as a sanction for non compliance with the elders' command, appears to indicate that in his view the expropriation powers of the court were meant to provide swift and effective sanctions for non compliance with the (civil and private) law or with any order of the court. The difference between public and private law exprop riations is traceable to other ancient systems of law, such as Greek and Roman, and the fact that, both in those other systems of law and in Jewish law, expropriations bore also punitive or fiscal character, does not derogate from this differentiation, but may be said to strengthen it. The respective approaches of R. Elazar and R. Yitshak as demonstrated by their dispute over the rule in question — namely, the paramount consideration of public welfare and the insignificance of private rights as compared with the pub lie interest, in the case of R. Elazar, and the necessity of providing the court with effective means to do justice and equity in every individual case as it thinks proper, in the case of R. Yitshak — are amply supported by a great number of dicta reported in their names on other questions of law. Community of matrimonial property Z. Warhaftig, Jerusalem The three principles which govern the laws regarding financial arrangements between the two parties of a marriage are: 1. The mutual dependence of the financial and the marital relationship; n. the freedom to make stipulations which exists in this, as in every other field of financial activity; hi. the recognition that every marriage contract affects</page><page sequence="19">268 ABSTRACTS OF HEBREW LECTURES a third party, viz. children or relatives, as well as the rest of the community. The various systems which impose a community of pro perty in the laws of different countries are surveyed in the paper and their implications are compared to the system which applies in Jewish law. A legal imposition of the partnership in property between husband and wife is seen to lead in most cases to a restriction on the freedom of action of the wife. In cases where the marriage is annulled the court can under Jewish law take into consideration various circum stances, and particularly the responsibility of each one of the parties, whereas in systems which impose community of property the courts lack this flexibility. Various decisions are found in Jewish legal writings to regulate the questions of inheritance: in the taqqanot of Castile, for example, the principle of equal rights over the property is conceded to a large extent. Legal decisions are discussed in the paper regarding cases where the parties explicitly stipulated in the marriage contract that the property is to be shared, and where the secular law in force regards a community of property as implied in the state of matrimony. The writer's conclusion is that a legally binding community of property is too rigid and undesirable, but that a marriage contract which contains arrangements for equal partnership between husband and wife should be introduced for those who wish to regulate their financial relationship in this manner. Nulla Poena Sine Lege P. Dykan (Dikstein), Petah Tikva The principle that punishment must be provided for by a specific law was accepted by Judaism in very ancient times. In the Pentateuch, the principle appeared in instances of the person cursing the Lord and the man gathering wood on the Sabbath. The Talmudic sages were of the opinion that God Himself observed this principle and did not punish nations for moral corruption unless they had been forewarned of the prohibitions. They limited punishments which depend on logical suppositions (analogy, a fortiori inference). In Second Temple times, the necessity for a special personal and immediate warning in the case of every offence was established. This resulted from the rule that logical con elusions emerging from the details and circumstances of the act are not enough for determining the intentions of the accused and the extent of his knowledge, but direct proof relying on the defendant's statements at the time is required. The judges had to investigate the witnesses thoroughly. They endeavoured to penetrate to the depths of the defendant's soul at the time the offense was committed and exhaust every detail relating to the facts. They also attempted to learn what the persons present did in order to prevent a serious crime. The students who sat in the Sanhedrin actively participated in questioning the witnesses. The concept of warning, which had been originally intended only to prove the accused's intention, expanded in time until it reached unrealistic, extreme dimensions. This exaggeration gave birth to the concern that the form of administering justice should not cause an increase in the number of mur derers. Therefore, an amendment was introduced which provided that a person killing another without due legal warning should be incarcerated for life and fed sparse quantities of bread and water. A special personal warning applied at the time only to those liable to the death penalty. However, a projection of this is the concept of doubtful warning, i.e., a warning which, even if unheeded by the would-be offender, still leaves the question in doubt at the time whether or not a crime has been committed. This concept produced exemptions when the external or internal (mental) elements of the offense were not sufficiently clear. The concept of warning, although not in such a severe form, also applied in laws concerning family relations, damages, and even in civil law cases such as discharging a hired workman who did not act properly. Freedom of Contract Regarding the Law of Surety M. Elon, Jerusalem One of the basic problems in Jewish law, as in all other le gal systems, is that of the freedom of contract. It seems that in accordance withthe ancient halakha, the rule 'if one makes a stipulation which is contrary to what is written in the Tora, his stipulation is void' applies to money matters (mamona) as well as to matters pertaining to prohibitions 0issura). In the fourth generation of Tannaim, opinions were divided concerning the freedom of contract only in matters concerning prohibitions. In the period of the Amoraim a tendency appears to accept the principle that in money matters a person may make stipulations on what is written in the Tora. This tendency, which was accepted in the post-Talmudic period, is very important in the development of Jewish law. With respect to the laws of surety, the problem of the freedom of making stipulations underwent a special develop ment because of various legal and literary factors. One of the basic rules in Jewish surety laws specifies that a creditor cannot demand the payment of a debt from a guarantor unless he has first taken steps to collect his money from the principal debtor, and learned that he does not possess goods for settling the debt. This law is a necessary outgrowth of justice and logic, since a guarantor, who did the principal debtor a favour, should not be required to pay off the debt when the principal debtor himself is capable of paying the money. However, the requirements of commerce made it necessary that there should also be a possibility of appealing directly to the guarantor in order to assure the creditor a rapid, efficient collection of his money. For this reason, several Tannaim decided that if during the undertaking of the guaranty it was stipulated that the creditor could demand repayment from whomever he wished, he could go directly to the guarantor, even if the borrower had property (Mishna Baba Batra 10, 7). However, whereas in other matters pertaining to money matters the Amoraim both in Palestine</page><page sequence="20">JEWISH LAW SECTION 269 and in Babylonia tended to accept the principle of freedom of stipulation, the Babylonian Amoraim displayed a contrary tendency regarding surety. This can be explained by literary and halakhic factors, the same as those which led to divergent developments in Palestine and Babylonia in other rules regarding surety (for example, surety for a ketubba). Gulack was right in pointing out that the denial of the freedom of stipulation by the Babylonian Amoraim led to the creation of the institution of 'arev qablan, whereby a creditor could appeal directly to the guarantor. However, because of the formal requirements connected with undertaking this kind of guaranty, this legal institution was not a convenient substitute for the freedom of stipulating conditions. In the post-Talmudic period, we find various attempts to restore the principle of the freedom of contract to the laws of surety. Part of the halakhic sages deny, by way of inter preting the relevant discussion in the Talmud, the very existence of any restriction on the freedom of stipulation in laws of surety. Others draw distinctions between the forms of stipulating conditions: ('I shall demand payment from whomever I wish', 'I shall demand payment first from whomever I wish'). This last distinction in the form of stating the condition was erroneously ascribed to the views of Maimonides (Lenders and Borrowers, Ch. XXV, rule 4). According to the Rome edition of 1480 and on the basis of further proof from other rules laid down by Maimonides, it becomes clear that the text we have before us contains Maimonides' first version and that in his last version Mai monides, in agreement with Rabbi Joseph Migash and Rabbi Aha of Shabha, favoured the maintenance of the absolute freedom of contract in laws of surety. Jewish law thus establishes that unless otherwise stipulated the creditor must first exhaust the possibilities of collecting the debt from the principal debtor, and only when it has been explicitly stipulated 'I shall demand payment from whomever I wish', indicating that the guarantor agreed to this condition in advance, may the creditor appeal directly to the guarantor. This rule answers both the requirements of justice and the needs of business and credit. It is today applied by some of the legal systems in various countries, and it is surprising that the Surety Bill (1964; sections 9-11) presented to the Israeli Knesset by the Government did not adopt this principle of Jewish law in order to embody it in the laws of the State of Israel.</page></plain_text>
