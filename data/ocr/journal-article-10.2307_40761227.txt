Of these two foreign influences, that of Islam appears to have a more antiquated history in the Yorùba artistic panorama. But no direct scholarship has been made to throw light on the relationship of Islam with their visual art traditions. It is the dearth of literature on this aspect of the arts of the Yorùba, that this art historical efforts attempt to bridge. Against this background, the people's contact with Islam vis-a-vis their indigenous religious background as well as the impacts and the image of Islam in their visual art traditions are examined. This exercise is being attempted not for any mere reason to explain the arts of the Yorùba from religious contexts but for the importance of the Islamic related themes in the visual arts of the Yorùba as material for history. And consequently a part explanation for the origin of and the inspiration for themes and motifs in the visual arts of the people. Since it was not until the nineteenth century that the Yorùba language was reduced into writing 0), this study has drawn largely on oral traditions and visual art materials. But literature relevant to the topic are also used to complement these two sources. Contact with Islam The actual period of the introduction of Islam into Yorubáland is not certain. Traditional evidence however indicates that its advent predated other religions (non-African) foreign to Yorubáland, hence the Yorùba saying: (1) S.O. BlOBAKU, Introduction, in S.O.

Ifá religion is as old as our (Yorubá) world Islam is also almost as old as our (Yorubá) world Christianity was introduced only recently. Christianity started filtering into Yorubáland from the coastal region only in the late nineteenth century (2). This suggests that Islam in Yorubáland would have a pre-nineteenth century advent. Abdurraham Doi shows in his work that Islam was introduced into Yorubáland from both the northern and the coastal sources. From the coast, it was introduced via free Yorubá captives returning home through Lagos in the beginning of the nineteenth century (3). But its contact had been on mainly from the northern source through Old Oyó, the most northern of the Yorubá kingdoms. This is largely because of Old Òyó's northern location and the strategic position of Òyó-ilé its last capital, on the trade routes that connected the markets of the West Sudan through the Niger to the southern coast and partly because of Old Òyó's influence over its large empire which incorporated many other Yorubá kingdoms (4). As a result, Old Oyó kingdom have shared boundaries and cultural ties with Islam bearing cultures to the north and as well as served as conduit of sudanic influences to other Yorubá states. Based on the premise that Islam was introduced to Yorubáland from the north through the Fulani jihad of 1804, Samuel Johnson, the Yorubá historian, claimed that it was introduced at the end of the eighteenth century (5). Records however indicate the presence of Islam in Yorubáland at an earlier date. Some sources have suggested the fourteenth century (6). Yorubá tradition and history even suggest it could be earlier. Sàngó the third Aláàfin, the traditional ruler of Old Oyó, who is certainly not in any way regarded as a muslim is described as being favourably disposed to muslims (7). He is even praise-named (2) W.H. CLARKE, Travels and Explorations in Yorubáland 1854-1858, J.A. Atanda (ed.), Ibadan, Ibadan University Press, 1972; S.O. BlOBAKU (ed.), op. cit., p. 1; R.C.C.

He that sits on a mortar to perform ablution like the muslim. Sàngó ruled at an earlier capital of the kingdom before the fourteenth century when the capital was moved to Qyó-ilé(9). Nonetheless, from its early contact with the Yorubá culture, Islam had been tolerated. For example by the late sixteenth century, there have been very serious muslim missionary activities in some parts of Yorubáland such as Qyo-ile(10). At that period, Ajíbóyèdé the reinging Aláàfin at Old Òyó was said to have been admonished by a learned Sheikh for his unjust revenge for his son's death on innocent citizens and as a result of which the king publicly apologized to his citizens (n). Consequent upon the Fulani jihad of 1804, ìlprin, one of the northern Yorubá towns, became a centre for Islamic learning. This paved way for the coming of more Islamic scholars and preachers into Yorubáland. Corollary to this were more converts made. Yorubá indigenous religious culture An understanding of the position of Islam in the Yorubá cultural setting would involve a comprehension of their indigenous religious set up, so as to appreciate the dynamic interactions between Islam and the visual arts of the people. The Yorubá believe in the one God, the Creator and the Cherisher of the whole universe and of whom reference is made in Òsá-'Gúndá, one of the Ifá divination verses, the Yorubá traditional repository of knowledge and information (12).

He did not take this incidence as evidence for the presence of Islam in Old Òyó and which would have helped him reach a decision on a date earlier than the nineteenth century is unlikely that a divine king like the Aláàfin will take heed of a condemnation from a foreign religious perspective if the religion is not known in his kingdom. For the incidence see: S. JOHNSON, op. cit., p. 164. (12) The use of the oral literature of the Yorubá Ifá divination as a source of history has been extensively discussed by generations of scholars.

God is only reverred in the mind. He has no shrine built for His worship. Being Omnipotent, He cannot be confined within space, rather, He is prayed to whenever the need arises. And as He is all sufficient, sacrifice was never offered to Him. At an unknown stage in their religious evolution, the Yorubá have also developed pantheon of gods who are invariably anthropomorphic and are venerated in various ways. These gods are held to be mere intermediaries between the people and the supreme God. This is a reflection of the Yorubá social pattern which do not recommend a determinate inferior to approach a determinate superior for favour; except through an intermidiary(14). The indigenous religious outlook of the Yorubá is tolerant of religious pluralism. An individual may belong to one or more religions. This partly explains the Yorubá's traditional tolerant attitude towards other religions which are foreign to Yorubáland. The tolerant outlook towards Islam is not unconnected with the fact that the worship of: ^s&amp;W%$$s$s ... ... God, the One and Only; God, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten(112: 1-3). To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: everything renders worship to Him. To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth ... (2:116-117) (14) A.I.

(10:47) who taught the worship of the one God. The pluralistic attitude in the indigenous Yorubá religious culture on the one hand and similarities in the conception of the Supreme God in the Yorubá religions and Islam on the other hand, have aided the toleration of Islam in Yorub aland. The two religion types are however contrasted by the cultures they radiate. Before their language was reduced into writing, the Yorubá operated a non-literate religious culture. Record concerning their religions have therefore been preserved through oral tradition and visual art forms, among others. This is, to a large extent even also true of the situation till date. The Yorubá have therefore developed a non-literacy way of appreciation of religion and a very high sensitivity to image construction. Whereas Islam discourages the usage of icons but encourages writing (15), especially the peculiarly rich Islamic art of calligraphy. These similarities and contrasts are part of the reasons for a paradoxical relation of love and hate between the Yorubá culture and Islam, and which has affected the twentieth century visual arts on the Yorubá in various ways. Bearded figure with leather sandals One of the most noticeable influence of Islam in the visual arts of the Yorubá and the most dramatic of their attempts to portray Islam in their visual arts and which is observable in this twentieth century is to be found in the theme of the bearded figure with leather sandals (pis 1-3). This peculiar theme which is an important historical testimony is carved in varieties on door panels and house posts. The theme is essentially composed of a standing bearded male figure wearing a long narrow dress with a pair of trousers. The figure dons the turban on its head and wears a pair of sandals. The figure also carries a big leather wallet with a long strap on its shoulder, holds rosary in one hand and a slate on which arabic letters are in some cases inscribed, on the other hand. The figure is at times also depicted holding a spear in one hand. Such figures undoubtedly reflect the image of muslims in their early contacts with the Yorubá. This position is corroborated by oral records. In Òtùra-méjì, an Ifá verse which is quoted below, metaphorical allusions on the (15) M.M.

He slides his sandals unto his feet and treks away It was divined for Àmódù (Ahmad) That was going to the towns of the Arabs The theme of the bearded figure wearing the long dress, Jàlâbíyâ which is almost invariably of white colour, and sandals in Yorubá sculpture may be a reflection of the Yorubá's early conception of the purity of the foreign religion with which they were then having contacts with. Though such sculptures are not painted and are finished in the brown colour of the wood, but the egret with its immaculate white colour with which the muslim is likened in the Ifá verse suggests a sense of neatness and purity. The depiction of the spear with the bearded figure portrays the eventual nineteenth century participation of the Fulani jihadists, who, spoke in martial language, in the spread of Islam to Yorùbaland. They harried many northern Yorubá settlements in the cause of their activities. Nonetheless and more significantly, the theme indicates that the early bearers of Islam to Yorùbaland were associated with slate; standing, perhaps walking postures and pair of slippers, most probably of leather; all of which suggest a social order, a conception of dedicated, disciplined and learned (16) Fatayo Yetunde AWOLERE, I/a priestess, Eleegun Compound Oyo, Personal communication, 7-9 April, 1992. (17) Àwòròkò-n-jobì is a bird that some Yorubá believe is fond of eating kolanut, though some claimed it does not eat kolanut. Nonetheless, its name is a compound and a descriptive one that has obi (kolanut) as one of its components. Either way, the usage of the name to describe the early muslims as in the Ifa verse may be an ironical personification or euphemism, but the association of the personas with kolanut is the thing being emphasized.</page><page sequence="10">586 NOTE E TESTIMONIANZE minds with some level of competence as scholars and teachers of their faith. Their association with kolanut and long distance journey as mentioned in Òtùra- méjì, the Ifá verse quoted above indicates, that the teachers and the bearers of Islam to Yorubáland were somehow connected with kolanut and they operated more on itinerant basis. These were undoubtedly the Arabs and the Berbers as well as the Hausa who were known leather-workers (18) and who through the trans -saharan trade route traded in kolanut with the Yorubá states through Old Oyó (19) This significant theme which paradoxically represents the ways by which the Yorubá saw Islam and an important historical comment on the passage of the bearded figure with leader sandals, the early bearers of Islam to Yorubáland, through Old Oyó is not the only influence of Islam in the Yorubá artistic culture and sculpture is not the only art so influenced. Islam in the Yorubá artistic panorama Nonetheless, there is yet no evidence to suggest any Islamic influence on the Yorubá visual art traditions of antiquity such as those of Ilé-Ifè Òwò and Èsìé, which have mostly come to us through archaeology. But in the contemporary Yorubá artistic setting where such influences are felt, the impact is paradoxical. It is paradoxical in that it has enriched the visual arts of the Yorubá and has also served as the basis for the destruction of some indigenous art objects. Such influences are worth examining in historical retrospect. Islam has not made any noticeable significant stylistic impact on the sculptural traditions of the Yorubá. Themes associated with Islam are invariably rendered in Yorubá styles. But the religion has enriched the arts of the Yorubá in motifs and forms. For example, the typical flat Qur'anic school slate that invariably have thin neck-like handle that is surmounted by an invented semi- circular form is now used, on its geometric shape merit, as motif on Yorubá wood sculptures (pl. 4). Also the Qur'an, simply represented as an open book, and the rosary are used as motifs in wood carving and gourd carving. Some Arabic texts such as: ¿UJI (18) R. Smith, Kingdoms of the Yoruba, London, Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd., 1976, p. 52. (19) Ibid, p. 40.</page><page sequence="11">NOTE E TESTIMONIANZE 587 are used as motifs on carved wooden door panels (pl. 4). Such inscriptions are also not uncommonly written, engraved, or made in bass relief on walls of mosques, private houses and motor vehicles, particularly the commercial ones belonging to muslims. Stylistically, the visual forms of the arabic text inscriptions do not however reflect the rich free flowing rhythm and the elegance characteristic of Islamic calligraphy. This is partly because of the limitations of the medium, usually wood, on which they are done. Gourd carving whose design surface lends itself more easily to carving manipulations have not adopted arabic texts as motifs. And partly because the texts are written by artists who are usually unlettered and also those who can not write arabic alphabets but who merely engrave or emboss whatever is written for them. And also till date, Islamic education in Yorubáland have concentrated on Qur'anic and arabic studies, it has not taken any interest in calligraphy as an art as is the case in the Islamic countries. It appears fairly certain that calligraphy as an art form was never introduced along with the religion to Yorubáland. In their own cases, some of the mosques are reminiscent of Islamic architecture which is characterised by the pylon derived forms and minarets. The two dimensional representation of these architectural forms are also used as motifs on carved wooden doors on mosques and some private houses. The interlace motifs are now commonly found in Yorubá leaterwork, gourd carving and wood carving. Such motifs have a pre-Islamic origin but are associated with Islamic cultures in West Africa. Their southward spread to Yorubáland have been attributed to trade contacts with the Sudanic influences through the Hausa(20). A few other geometric motifs now found in the visual arts of the Yorubá appear to have been inspired through contacts with decorations on saddles and other horse riding equipments as well as ornamented swords, that reflect Islamised Sudanic and Bornu influences and which were imported into Yorubáland in the early times (21). Cloth embroidery which David Heathcote claims developed from around Mali is associated with Qur'anic scholars and teachers (22). The art is also practiced among the Yorubá, but more especially by their muslims. Evidence do not suggest a local origin for it. It was most probably introduced into Yorubáland through the interaction with the early Islamic scholars. Islam does not encourage direct figurai representation and its practice in Yorubáland is somehow associated with some level of iconoclasm. Contrariwise however, the arts of the Yorubá have been dominated by sculptures and which have largely been employed in architectural and religious contexts. Though (20) R.O.

But in the northern parts of Yorubáland, around Old Oyó kingdom, where many muslims resided in the early period of its introduction into Yorubáland, sculptures and other art objects were used extensively By the second half of the seventeenth century, there was a large number of muslims both natives and non-natives in Old Oyó kingdom (25) Islamic clerics acted as secretaries, political advisers and provincial governors to the Aláàfin. They also acted as secretaries and advisers to members of Òyómèsì, the Qyo traditional legislative council. Landolphe, a french trader, records that the ambassadors from the kingdom of Old Oyó, «les Ayeax,» whom he met in the Benin area in the late eighteenth century «savaient écrire et calculer en arabe» (knew how to write and calculate in arabic). Bowdich also reported that the muslim scribe of Ashantehene at Kumasi in 1817, had earlier resided in Òyó- ilé(26). Captain Clapperton also reportedly encountered in 1825, at ìpókia, non- Yorubá muslims (27). Tradition in the Ifá verse, Òtàrá-méjt, also suggests that at such an early period, the numbers of muslims in Yorubáland was quite appreciable. They even travelled in groups, both natives and non-natives, perhaps through the caravan routes to perform the pilgrimage in Arabia (28). The Ifá verse explains thus: Okó béébé, awo Alará, Lo dífá fún Alará Àrèbò awo Osù Lo dífá fun Osù Ká sáré lo, ká tètè dé A dífá fún ènlpjp Imple Wón ñlp lèé pà 'gbò ní'lé Olódùmarè ..&gt;)' Very-small-hoe (cognomen), the priest of Alará Was the one that divined for Alará (23) It is only the sculpture representing Èsù, the Yorùba god of chance and trickster that shows any consistent form that suggests that the sculpture may represent him.

In spite of the largeness of the muslim population, eye witness accounts on the kingdom describe the people as fond of ornamenting their doors and house posts with carvings (30). It appears that iconoclasm with which Islam is now associated in Yorubáland does not appear to have been introduced until the Fulani jihad, of the nineteenth century. Through the Fulani jihad, some Yorubá settlements were despoiled of their valuable artistic treasures. For example between 1833-35, on more than one occasion, the Emir of Ilorin sent the jihadists, under his head slave, to Òyó-ilé to pack: ... anything of value he could lay his hands upon that Oyo may not be said to have anything which Ilorin has not ... among other things removed were ... 100 brass posts (31) ... all the Egungun dress [masquerade costumes] ... (32) These art objects were destroyed and the metal ones melted by the jihadists to make cannon balls needed in their war against the kingdom (33). Also, till the late twentieth century, it was not unusual to find muslim preachers publicly destroying indigenous art objects belonging to new converts or their families. And for Islamic iconoclasm some artists, in the indigenous arts such as the brass casters at ìlorin, who professed Islam stopped the production of figurai forms, for example. They are still however engaged in the production of other non- figural metal objects. The iconoclastic incidences mentioned earlier notwithstanding, aside from the theme of the bearded figure with leather sandals, there have been other attempts to specifically portray Islam by Yorubá artists. Masque- dramaturgists sometimes display with costumes having the mask representations of the Aqal- al-sharif and Shabaqah, two types of head wear usually brought home from Arabia by some Yorubá pilgrims and with which those who have performed the Islamic holy pilgrimage to Mecca are somehow associated in Yorubáland. Another novel example is the case of Olúkòtún, an Egungun masquerade, in (30) H. Clapperton, op. cit., p. 48. (31) S. Johnson, op. cit., p. 259. (32) Ibid, p. 217.

Excluding a few of the young generation, very few Yorubá muslims have any serious iconoclastic tendency. Yorubá traditional thoughts still exert some influence on the Islamic outlook of many Yorubá muslims. In fact some of them have maintained a symbiotic religious relationship between Islam and the indigenous religions or with their artistic culture such as is reflected in Òtùra-méjì: Ká háá 'su Ká háá árà Káhárà Káhásu Ò-s'eye'-gbó-mòle awòròkò-h-jobi A díá fún Álu láà Ti í s'oni 'mòle Òyó Njè Òrìsà-oko,vagbà ìràwò Sáré wá, o wá gbà mí lówp ajogun (34) Memorizing in chapters Memorizing in verses Memorizing-in-verses Memorizing-in- chapters Àwòròkò-h-jobì, an inconsistent traditionalist cum muslim It was divined for Álu láà Who was a muslim at Òyó Please Òrìsà-oko, the elder (divinity) of Iràwò (a town) Hasting up to save me from afflictions. They therefore, till date, use sculptures for architectural and other decorative purposes. Such sculptures also identify them with Islam. Conclusion Evidence indicate that the presence of Islam in the Yorubá religious landscape has a more antiquated history than any other non-African religion. Consequently its direct influence on the visual arts of the people would appear to have an equally long history. (34) Fátáyò Yétúndé AwÓLÈRÈ, op. cit.</page><page sequence="15">NOTE E TESTIMONIANZE 591 But if Islam was indeed present in Yorubáland around the fourteenth century, its influence on the visual arts of the people at that initial period was not significant enough to influence the artists of the well established Yorubá art traditions like Ilé-Ifè and the rest. There is also no visual evidence to suggest a position contrary to this for Old Oyó, it is however possible that its influence at such period might have been felt in the visual arts of Old Oyó kingdom which had a closer contact with the Islam bearing cultures to its north and consequently the earlier contact with Islam. The paradoxical impact of enrichment and iconoclasm which Islam had on the twentieth century visual arts of the Yorubá emanated from the paradoxical relation of love and hate between the Yorubá culture and Islam. That paradoxical relation itself was a result of some similarities and contrasts in the cultures which both the indigenous Yorubá religious setup and Islam radiated. The theme of the bearded figure with leather sandals is in itself an embodiment of this paradox. It is a representation of the disciplined and learned image of the earliest bearers of Islam to Yorubáland; and the martial and iconoclastic image of the jihadist who later joined the activities for its spread in the nineteenth century. This theme being representation of the male figure also reflects the fact, that women did not participate, at least openly, in the teaching of and the spread of Islam to Yorubáland. Islam and indeed its practice in Yorubáland has not employed direct figurai representation for decoration or to propagate its teachings. This made the representation of the theme of the bearded figure with leather sandals and other art objects that reflects Islamic influences very interesting. The Yorubá's use of such art objects is therefore not out of religious compulsion but as one of the ways of identifying with the religion through a much valued aspect of their culture-visual art. It also reflects the fact that Yorubá artists see their products not only as a means of national identity but also as a means of identification with foreign influences and a reflection on life and its immediate pre-occupation.
