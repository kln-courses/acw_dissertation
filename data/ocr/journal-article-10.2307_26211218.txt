Introduction Despite the ascendancy of secularism on the world stage, religion continues in many parts of the world to inform national priorities. It im pacts international relations between nations and the intra-national rela tionships between ethnic and religious groups within nations. Religion has always been an important factor in shaping the social reality of peo ple, and this extends to laying down the approved means for dispute resolution. The nexus between religion and dispute resolution can be overlooked in a western context, where a secular world view and the separation of church and state distances dispute resolution from the reli gious priorities and values of the Judeo-Christian tradition.

INT'l L. &amp; DISPUTE RESOLUTION [Vol. 13:1 porary aim of Western dispute resolution is to be value-neutral and to utilize an impartial intervener,1 for whom religious knowledge is irrele vant, even inappropriate, in fulfilling the role - whether as judge, arbitra tor or mediator. However, in many parts of the world, religion is not relegated to the private sphere, but directly informs state practice includ ing the means by which conflict is de-escalated and disputes are re solved. Religious knowledge and credentials become essential to the process. One such nation where law and religion meet is the Sultanate of Brunei Darussalam.2 Negara Brunei Darussalam3 (Brunei) is a small Southeast Asian na tion on the northwestern coast of Borneo, nestled between the two Ma laysian states of Sabah and Sarawak. This oil-rich Malay Islamic Sultan ate proclaimed its independence in 1984, making it one of the last nations in the region to shed its colonial ties. However, it inevitably bears a distinctive legacy from almost a century of British protection and influence. This legacy is evident in the processes employed for dispute resolution, with the retention of the English common law and courts be ing tangible reminders of its era of colonial dominance. Brunei, of course, had a history predating English influence - one that extends back in time to the first Raja's conversion to Islam in 1360. While this date marks the commencement of the Sultanate, dispute resolution processes go back even further to the animistic beliefs and practices that evolved in the dense, rugged, tropical rainforests of Borneo. As distinctive religious and social systems, both Islam and animism4 provided specialized proc esses for managing conflict and settling disputes, and both were able to survive during and beyond the century of British colonialism. However, Adjudication, arbitration, or mediation in the common law system relies on the same values of impartiality, neutrality, and independence. 2 For an overview of the legal system of Brunei, see Ann Black, Brunei, in LEGAL SYSTEMS OF THE WORLD: A POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ENCYCLOPEDIA 199 (Herbert M.

Daru 'L-Salam is a honorific, Arabic title. 4 Animism comes from the Latin word anima meaning breath or soul and requires belief in the existence of spiritual beings. It is the oldest form of religious belief on Earth and continues today, especially in native and indigenous cultures. Animism requires an acceptance of a spiri tual realm in which humans share the universe with other natural creations and gods. The con cepts that humans possess souls and souls have life apart from human bodies before and after death are central to animism, along with the ideas that animals, plants, natural phenomenon and celestial bodies have spirits. The presence of holy men or women, visions, trancing, danc ing, sacred items, sacred spaces for worship, and the connection to the spirits of ancestors are characteristic of animistic societies. See generally EDWARD CLODD, ANIMISM THE SEED OF Religion (1905).</page><page sequence="3">2005] Animistic Dispute Resolution under the Sultanate's current policy of Islamization, which has been pur sued since Independence, the animistic dispute resolution processes are under threat. The focus of this paper is on the dispute resolution of the Iban, a small indigenous non-Muslim ethnic minority in Brunei. The paper ex amines the Iban form of mediation, which is infused with animism and shaped by the practical necessities wrought by close inter-connected rela tionships. It does so against a backdrop of Islamization, where the reas sertion of an Islamic and Malay5 identity is bringing about absorption and integration of indigenous minorities into the Malay. This fits a pat tern of cultural extinction that Winzeler found occurring in other post colonial societies where indigenous minorities "have become encapsu lated within the larger states which seek to transform and integrate them into an emerging national society and culture."6 The terms "Fourth World colonialism"7 and "internal colonization"8 have been used to iden tify post-colonial situations in which the dominant indigenous ethnic group is subsuming other smaller or different indigenous peoples. The discussion is divided into five parts. Part II provides back ground information on the religious imperatives that are directing the forms of dispute resolution in the Sultanate; most notably the resurgence of Islam and the features of Iban life that differentiate them from the Muslim Malay majority. Part III outlines the features of Iban dispute resolution, which is centered on the core characteristics of the longhouse, the application of adapt and augury, and the intervention of the headman. Part IV provides an analysis as to whether this ancient means of dispute resolution can survive into the 21st century and canvasses a range of fac tors, including the inroads being made by Islam and Malay culture. The last part concludes by linking the Brunei experience to similar trends in Southeast Asia. 5 The term Malay (Melayu) in Brunei Darussalam is used for a person who professes the relig ion of Islam, habitually speaks the Malay language and conforms to Malay custom. This is essentially a cultural definition though it is also used in a political sense in Brunei to describe a member of the seven indigenous groups that the Constitution and the Brunei Nationality Act (1961) state are Malay, although some, such as the Murut and Dusun, are mainly non Muslims. 6 Robert L.

INT'l L. &amp; DISPUTE RESOLUTION [Vol. 13:1 II. Background Information For centuries, Brunei society, like all of the island of Borneo, has been comprised of many ethnic groups with different languages9 and re ligious practices.10 The Constitution acknowledges seven indigenous groups: Belait, Bisaya, Dusun, Kedayan, Murut, and Tutong who, to gether with the Berunai (Brunei) Malays, make up 67% of the popula tion.11 There also have been indigenous people from contiguous parts of Borneo, such as the Iban/Dayaks, Penan and Kelibat (6%),12 who have been residents in the current enclaves of Brunei Darussalam13 for a cen tury or more together. There is also a significant number of Chinese residents (15%).14 Although Brunei is home to these many distinctive ethnic and religious groups, it can best be described as a multi-ethnic rather than a multi-cultural nation. This is because the government strenuously promotes mono-culturalism through its official prioritization of Malay culture and of Islam. A. Resurgence of Islam in Brunei Since Independence, Brunei has been asserting its Islamic identity. The Sultan's titah15 at the proclamation of Independence, January 1, 1984, declared Melayu Islam Beraja16 (MIB) to be the national ideology, adding that it must be honored and practiced by all the people of Brunei.17 He formalized MIB as "a concept which upholds Islamic prin ciples and values based on the Qur'an and Hadith18 as the basis of all ac 9 Brown states that linguistically they belong to one language family but speak mutually unin telligible languages. See D.E. Brown, Principles of Social Structure: Southeast Asia 132 (1976). See also Language Use and Language Change in Brunei Darussalam (Peter W. Martin et al. eds., 1996). 10 Animistic religions, often identified as pagan, were present prior to the arrival of Hinduism in the 13th &amp; 14th Centuries, and Islam from 15th Century. Some Christian conversions oc curred from the 19th Century onwards, especially in the non-Muslim indigenous population. Buddhism and Taoism came with Chinese settlements. 11 Central Intelligence Agency, The World Factbook 2004 81 (2004). 12 Id. 13 They came to reside in Brunei during the early part of the 20th century. 14 Central Intelligence Agency, supra note 11, at 81. 15 A royal address to the people of Brunei Darussalam in which policy directions are an nounced. 16 Translates as Malay, Islam and Monarchy. 17 Borneo Bulletin Brunei Yearbook 91 (2000). 18The activities, deeds, sayings, and teachings of the Prophet Mohammad recorded by verifi able eyewitnesses and accepted as correct.

However, the inculcation of MIB into all aspects of life has had far-reaching consequences for Muslims and non-Muslims. MIB's success extends to dispute resolution. Its aim has been to re verse the dominance of the secular common law courts by placing "Is lamic laws at their rightful place as the principle legal system in the country and not the colonial system as practiced today."21 The centrality of law in Islam necessitates this. Hence, the implementation of an Is lamic legal system administered in accordance with the Syariah22 is seen as demonstrating the Sultanate's commitment to Islam as well as herald ing the Sultanate's independence as it shifts away from dependency upon me uaiispiaiiieu sceuiai, vvcaiciii uispuic icauiuuuii niuuei ui me euiii mon law. Tangible restructuring can be seen in the conversion of Kadi Courts to Syariah Courts,23 with appellate and original jurisdiction, and in the introduction of training in Syariah law and procedure for Syariah lawyers and judges at the University of Brunei Darussalam. The ap pointment of an Islamic scholar and Syariah lawyer as Vice Chancellor of the University24 indicated priorities in education, including legal edu cation. Common law subjects are not taught at any institution in the country. Commercial and financial laws, which had been the sole pre serve of the inherited colonial system, have been supplemented by a se ries of statutes on Islamic banking,25 finance, investment and insurance.26 Islamic evidence law,27 family law,28 and other personal laws for Mus lims29 have also been strengthened.

INT'l L. &amp; DISPUTE RESOLUTION [Vol. 13:1 mitment to Islam,30 was foreshadowed in another titah from the Sultan but has not eventuated. All these modifications are part of the process of readjusting the framework for dispute resolution so that it accords with MIB's Islamic heart. One consequence of the recent ascendancy of Islam, together with the strengthening of Malay culture pursuant to MIB in Brunei Darussa lam, has been to undermine the non-Malay indigenous culture, including their processes for dispute resolution. The indigenous non-Malays are descendants of the ethnic peoples of Borneo who did not convert to Is lam, many of whom have retained aspects of their traditional way of life and animistic beliefs. As MIB strives to promote a homogenous national Malay culture, religion, government, and language, it is seen as in the na tional interest to contain the customs and practices, which are incompati ble with it. A direct consequence of the policy of encouraging indige nous non-Malays to be absorbed, through conversion, into the Malay (Masuk Melayu) is that their animistic dispute resolution processes de rived from adatiland augury32 are becoming rare. B. The Iban of Brunei Darussalam The Iban are a Proto-Malay33 people considered by anthropologists to be representative of the Dayaks,34 the people of the interior of Borneo who did not convert to Islam. A generic Bornean form of social organi sation has been identified: 30 Ibrahim Khalid El-Mahdi, Highlights on Some Legal Aspects of the Shari'ah 36 (1990). Contra Mohammad T. Mehdi, Islam and Intolerance: Reply to Salman RUSHDIE (1989) (rejecting the position that a Muslim country can claim to be Islamic merely by applying Islamic criminal law). 31 Adat is an Arabic derived word and is frequently defined in English as customary law. An thropologist Herbert Whittier in his research on Borneo writes that adat pertains not just to what Westerners call religion and law, but that it underlies all aspects of life including "rela tions to other humans as well as to the natural and supernatural world." Herbert L. Whittier, The Kenyah, in WORLD WITHIN: THE ETHNIC GROUPS OF BORNEO 152 (Victor T. King ed., 1994). "[Adat] includes the whole notion of the proper order and harmony of the cosmos and the behaviour of its components." Id. 32 Augury is a term derived from Latin and referred to the practice of ancient Roman officials, known as augurs, who observed and interpreted omens. It was a means of predicting future events. 33 See Derek Freeman, Some Reflections of the Nature of Iban Society 4-25 (1981) (portraying a historical perspective on the arrival and migration of the Dayaks through Bor neo). See also Benedict Sandin, The Westward Migration of the Sea Dayaks, 1 SARAWAK MUSEUM J. 54(1956). 34 See VICTOR T. KING, THE PEOPLES OF BORNEO 30 ( 1993). 35 Cf. Carl L. Hoffman, The Punan: Hunters and Gatherers of Borneo 1 (UMI Re search Press 1986) (1983) (defining Dayak in its "broadest sense," as it has come to be recog nized in Borneo as referring to "all the indigenous, proto-Malay tribal peoples of the island's interior").</page><page sequence="7">2005] Animistic Dispute Resolution All dayaks have broadly the same physical characteristics; their lan guages can be categorised together as "Malayo-Polynesian"; most peoples share similarities in material culture, such as, in agricultural, domestic and other equipment, and in longhouse domicile; finally some characteristic customary practices and associated beliefs, for ex ample, the taking of omens from birds and animals, headhunting and its rites, and the belief in the spirit world.35 They share worldview, cosmology and symbolism.36 The non-Malay indigenous people who adhere to this "Bornean type of organization" make up six percent of the current population of Brunei Darussalam.37 As they have retained features of traditional Bornean or ganization, their means of dispute resolution can be distinguished from that of the Brunei Malays. It is informed by a very distinctive and differ ent worldview than that of Islam. It is one in which the individual is in constant interaction with the spirit world and multiple Gods. Such be liefs and practices form a continuum of indigenous culture which pro vides modem scholars with a window into a pre-islamic, pre-huropean, traditional way of life. While the Iban are in the minority in Brunei Darussalam, they are a numerically significant proportion of the population in nearby Sarawak38 and in Borneo generally. This numerical base has assisted in their reten tion of traditional ways. Although the process of conversion to Islam and thereby "becoming Malay" is regularly occurring amongst the Iban of Brunei, their links with the wider Iban communities of Borneo have meant they have been more able to resist the incentives offered by con version than other groups who do not have the same network of ethnic connections, such as the Dusun39 and Belait.40 Many Iban, young and old, still speak with pride of their heritage and willingly share knowledge of their traditions and beliefs. For this reason, it was possible to inter view Iban and spend time in a traditional longhouse in remote rural Temburong.41 The description of the dispute resolution processes of the 3 See KING, supra note 34, at 2-3.

INT'l L. &amp; DISPUTE RESOLUTION [Vol. 13:1 Iban that follows was derived from these interviews and supplemented by accounts of other researchers in Borneo. III. Features of Iban Dispute Resolution Processes The Iban in Brunei Darussalam, along with other animist peoples of Borneo, are heirs to a long tradition of consensual dispute resolution. Animism thrives in an environment where the dense tropical jungle, in tricate river systems, and difficult terrain of the interior gave rise to small scattered segmentary42 groups. In the spirit world, the natural order and the supernatural are believed to interest all human endeavors. Thus, the dynamics of dispute resolution allowed both adat and augury43 to guide both process and outcomes. At first it may seem incongruous that people who were known as the "headhunters of Borneo" would also adopt a consensual and spiritually based process for settling disputes and employ an essentially egalitarian social structure. However, in all probability, this occurred as a protective reaction against the external violence that permeated Borneo's interior. The longhouse became the vital institu tional ingredient in Iban life as it provided a means of defense and pro tection for its residents. Separate dwellings would have made families vulnerable. One structure was easier to defend because the longhouse was built off the ground on high stilts,44 making enemy access difficult since the ladders could be drawn up when needed. Longhouses no longer fulfill this protective function, but they have survived as the piv otal social institution into the 21st century.45 The longhouse, the application of adat and augury, the mediating role played by the headman, and the principles that govern the process of dispute resolution within and outside the longhouse can be identified as the distinctive features of Iban dispute resolution. Each will be discussed in turn. A. The Longhouse Iban dispute resolution typically takes place in the longhouse. The longhouse establishes a delineated community and minimization of con 42 Term describing a state comprised of sub-units that are structurally and functionally equiva lent at every level of the political system. 43 See discussion infra Part III.B. 44 The height also provided protection in case of flooding and had the additional advantage of allowing river breezes that cooled the hot, humid air. It also gives shade for the animals kept underneath the longhouse, which in the past included pigs, but today are mainly chickens and dogs. 45 Vinson H. Sutlive, The Iban of Sarawak 59 (1978).</page><page sequence="9">2005] Animistic Dispute Resolution ilict between members or the house is a priority. A longhouse does not operate strictly in a communal form, but more as a collection of inde pendently owned and inhabited family apartments (bileks), joined later ally, and connected with a joint gallery (ruai) and open-air veranda (tanju). Freeman explains, "the unbroken expanse of roof tends to con ceal the fact that the Iban long-house is fundamentally a series of discreet entities—the independent family units of a competitive and egalitarian society."46 The bilik family usually consists of two or three generations, which are domestically and financially autonomous. Each family pos sesses land,47 such as a rice (padi) field, and provides for the needs of its t au: 11.. u., i i t.: /XU* 1 lUUiVlUllUilJ Ullü TT MO «JJ lUlllllllg U11U X/XXV VV/ day many seek paid outside employment. However, after one's family, an Iban's identity and loyalty is to the longhouse. This is strengthened by kinship and friendship ties. It has been described as an open society "where the most intimate details of family life can be open for public discussion ... [an Iban] lives in an at mosphere of reciprocity, freedom and egalitarianism. The longhouse binds the individual to his community and his culture."49 The longhouse is a sovereign unit, acting dually as a collective ritual entity and as a fo rum for settling disputes between members. Both functions are adminis tered by the longhouse headman and elders, and by an augur.50 B. Adat and Augury For the animist Iban two agents regulate their world: adat and au gury. Each impacts upon the individual and his or her relationships with others, with the longhouse community and with the gods and spirits. Both adat and augury govern the processes for dispute resolution. Au gury defines the ritual magic-religious requirements for each member 46 Derek Freeman, The Iban of Borneo 1 (1992). 47 Land is termed an allodial unit. Contrasted with the Punan, who were nomadic hunters and gatherers, the Iban, like other Dayak groups, traditionally practiced shifting agriculture, or swidden farming, sometimes referred to as slash-and-burn agriculture. In this practice, the forest was cleared and burned so that crops, especially padi rice, could be grown. Then it would be left fallow for several years while the forest rejuvenated, and a new section would be cleared and burned. The ash acted as the main form of fertilizer. See KING, supra note 34, at 170-87 (describing swidden farming). 48 See R. A. Cramb &amp; I.R. Wills, The Role of Traditional Institutions in Rural Development: Community-Based Land Tenure and Government Land Policy in Sarawak, Malaysia, 18 WORLD Dev. 347, 349 (1990) (describing a "community based" land tenure system where the property rights are assigned and enforced by the longhouse community, but the rights are not communal as they are held by individual families). 49 Peter Mulok Kedit, Modernization among the Iban of Sarawak 37-38 (1980). 50 Augur in Iban is taui burong (literally, "bird elder"). The Iban interviewed in Temburong translated the term augur as "medicine man."</page><page sequence="10">10 WILLAMETTE J. INT'l L. &amp; DISPUTE RESOLUTION [Vol. 13:1 and bilik family, as well as for the longhouse as a ritual entity. Adat is an all-encompassing customary system of beliefs, rules, principles, and practices that guide all behavior, including relations with other humans as well as the natural and supernatural world.51 Sather explains the na ture of adat: "[t]o the Iban the term adat covers all the various customary norms, jural rules, ritual interdictions and injunctions that guide an indi vidual's conduct, and the sanctions and forms of redress by which these norms and rules are upheld."52 Adat is the means by which good relations are maintained within an Iban communitv and can be aoolied to virtually all snheres of human life. social,53 economic,54 religious,55 and political.56 It regulates interpersonal relationships by setting out reciprocal responsibilities, rights and duties; by providing sanctions to be imposed for breach of adat, and by estab lishing the moral standards to be valued and attained, such as courage, kindness, and generosity. An Iban can describe a person as having either good or bad adat,57 Good adat indicates that he or she possesses admi rable personal qualities, as well as adhering to the rules, practices, and beliefs. A large proportion of adat is believed to have been revealed by the gods and spirits, and so a breach of adat may require the observance of a ritual. This is to prevent supernatural retaliation for the lack of harmony within the longhouse. Augury further enhances the connection between adat and the dictates of the spiritual world. Augury is a form of divina tion, providing the means by which the will of the gods58 can be revealed to an Iban through the behaviour of birds, animals, and reptiles. The gods can issue warnings, provide favor and guidance, and foretell future occurrences to those who can interpret the omens and signs. The augur 51 See Evelyn Hong, Natives of Sarawak: Survival in Borneo's Vanishing Forest 37 (1987) (noting that the system of rights and obligations derived from adat is acknowledged by the whole community and is applied in all areas of Dayak life). 52 Clifford Sather, Introduction, in BENEDICT Sandin, Iban Adat and AUGURY xi (1980). 53 As seen in marriage adat\ adat for death and mourning; adat for childbirth; and naming a child. 5' As seen in adat for dividing game acquired from a joint or communal hunt. 55 Adat for making sacrifices for the dead, and the adat for religious festivals. 56See Vinson H. Sutlive, The Iban of Sarawak 59 (1978) (noting that adat confirms the longhouse as the sole political entity, without any supralocal integration). 57 Sather, supra note 52, at xii. 58 The Iban have many gods in their pantheon. Some have power over natural phenomena, such as god of the wind, gods of the tree tops, and gods of the earth and heavens. These gods can be invoked through incantations, prayers and rituals. Other gods, such as the creator of man and the god of war are anthropomorphic and can manifest themselves in animal form. See KEDIT, supra note 49, at 23-29 (describing Iban religion).</page><page sequence="11">2005] Animistic Dispute Resolution 11 of the longhouse is responsible for correctly interpreting the omens and for securing the ritual status of the longhouse. Of greatest importance are seven augural birds that act as messengers for the most important of the Iban gods, Singalong Burong.60 Harm is not caused by the omens of evil but by failing to heed the warnings and wilfully disregarding the prognostications of the gods. As the Iban explain: "[t]hese omen birds, they announce to us those things which are hurtful and those which are not; but if we do not understand their language, if we do not heed them, then we shall suffer."61 Augury complements adat, in that any serious breach of adat may necessitate supernatural sanctions and ritual redress to preserve the collective well-being of the longhouse community.62 In addition, a violation of adat that causes injury to the person or property of another is seen as an attack on the spiritual personality or the soul of the victim, which in tum requires spiritual redress, in addition to any other form of redress. It is the responsibility of the headman and the eld ers, including the augur,63 to see that correct redress is applied so that the social harmony between individuals and the spiritual health of that com munity can be restored. C. Role of the Headman As guardian and administrator of the adat, the headman, in a role akin to a mediator, continues to facilitate the resolution of disputes. Past practices explain the continuing significance of the headman. Up until the time when the Iban were subsumed within the western institution of the nation state, they lacked a centralized political order and had no hier archical structure of authority. It has been described as an "acephelous" society.64 While egalitarian when compared to the stratified Malay soci ety, there was still a need for mechanisms to maintain order and resolve differences among members. It was logical that the one with greatest knowledge of the rules and rituals of the adat be chosen as their head man. Headmen are still chosen by the members of each longhouse. His role was not merely to impose a solution by reference to adat, but to enunciate, confirm, and explain the adat. The support of elders and oth 59 The augur looks to the omens before giving advice on when to commence planting, harvest ing, building, or going on a journey. 60 Sather, supra note 52, at 93. 61 Freeman, supra note 46, at 118. 62 Otherwise supernatural punishments such as illness, death, injury, crop failure or other harm may befall the members. See Sather, supra note 52, at xi; KING, supra note 34, at 204. 63 The position of augur is generally held by a person other than the headman. 64 Donald E.

INT'l L. &amp; DISPUTE RESOLUTION [Vol. 13:1 ers in the longhouse was important in contributing to a consensus about the outcome and ensuring that correct redress was given. In this way, settlements could be voluntarily accepted65 and mutually acceded to by the disputants. It also restored harmony to the longhouse, which was seen as important, not only in collective social terms, but also spiritually. Whether the intervention of the headman allows this process to be labeled mediation,66 conciliation, or "med-arb" depends on the terminol ogy being employed. There is consensus in Western literature that it is difficult to provide a definitive definition of mediation.67 The fact that there is debate on what exactly mediation is, in itself, a feature of West ern culture, where mediation has been theorized, evaluated, researched, and professionalized. This does not happen in indigenous communities where the long-standing, more informal and localized nature of the proc ess, obviates any need for theorizing, analyzing, or labeling. The Iban process lacks the form, structure, and features of mediator independ ence, impartiality, anu neutrality. niese aie qualities mat western alternative dispute resolution (ADR) value and are an imperative of common law for all interveners, whether judge, arbitrator, or mediator. Iban dispute resolution is personalized and their elected headman is ex pected to have personal knowledge of each member of the community making Western features of independence, impartiality, and neutrality unnecessary, even undesirable. Attributes for a headman include persua sion and the ability to coax and coerce parties into an acceptable solu tion. The interests of the group outweigh those of individual disputants. However, although the rationale and process used by the headman differs ' Where this is not accepted, a member has the option to leave the longhouse. 66 See Black, supra note 2 (discussing the distinctive features of western and traditional media tions). 67 See John H. Wade, Mediation - the Terminological Debate, 5 AUSTL. DlSP. RESOL.

If this is the basic feature of a mediation process, then the Iban dispute resolution process falls under this rubric. Greenhouse considers "mediation" to represent a residual category, filling the gap between formal judicial processes and systems of violent self-help.71 While there are many variants and permutations of mediation, it is acknowledged as a process that has had a long and diverse history in most cultures around the world.72 Clearly, the cultural context directs and informs the nature of the process so that mediation in the longhouses of Brunei can be ex pected to differ from those informed by the Western ADR philosophy. D. Dispute Resolution Principles Make small things nothing: utai mit gaga nadai Make large things small: utai basai gaga mit73 These sayings reveal the two principles at the heart of Iban dispute resolution. The aim is to de-escalate conflict and to nullify disputes by a conciliated outcome. That is, quarrels, complaints, and minor disputes between parties should be erased so that harmony is completely restored to the longhouse. If this can be done by the headman talking privately with the disputants, or by the headman encouraging friends and relatives of the aggrieved party to make compensation, then "small things have become nothing." With anywhere from five to twenty-five bilik families living under one roof, a negotiated solution which de-escalates conflict is desirable. Similarly, larger issues of contention that cannot be settled quietly and informally will be resolved by prompt intervention in the form of a hearing in the gallery (raui) of the longhouse. The aim is to mediate, rather than impose a solution, in the hope that both parties, with the help of the longhouse members, can accept an agreed outcome. In this way, the longhouse community can continue living together without ill will. Given the close nature of longhouse life, it is not surprising that mutual concessions are a feature in most settlements mediated by a headman. A headman cannot issue commands, but by his knowledge, oratory, wisdom, and judgment he can influence the course of events so 71 Carol Greenhouse, Mediation: a Comparative Approach, 20 Man. 90, 90-91 (1985). 72 Christopher W.

INT'l L. &amp; DISPUTE RESOLUTION [Vol. 13:1 that a dispute may be resolved.74 Consistent with the principle of de-escalation of conflict is the speed with which a settlement can be effected. A hearing in the gallery, to which any member of the longhouse can attend and contribute, is likely to occur within a day of the matter coming to the attention of the head man. The usual time for such hearings is after the evening meal, when most members have returned from the fields or from work. By providing for early mediation of a solution, it is felt that intractable positions are less likely to develop, acrimony may be reduced, and permanent damage to relationships can be minimized.75 Given that the Iban are in close physical proximity with in a longhouse, resolution and remedies are quickly needed, and the resolution process can be immediately invoked. 1. The Dispute Resolution Process In the process of hearing a dispute, all members of the longhouse community can contribute. The process is democratic and inclusive, yet the words of the headman and the elders are accorded considerable re spect because adat remains an oral tradition,76 and the older Iban are ac cepted as having the greater knowledge. At times, there can be heated arguments,77 but generally debate and discussion is orderly. Were a dis pute to become intractable, with no mediated solution derived, there would be open admonition of the resisting party and an expectation that the person would leave the longhouse.78 One source of conflict, likely to end with an individual leaving79 or a partitioning into a new hilik, occurs when perceived unequal contributions between members of a hilik caused increasing resentment, insults, and gossip.80 Unless a solution to 74 KING, supra note 34, at 204. 75 This is in accordance with the earlier maxim, "Make small things nothing: make large things small." 76 In Brunei Darussalam, no one has written codification of adat in Sarawak. See IBAN ADAT AND AGURY, supra note 52 (recording in considerable detail the Iban customary laws of Bor neo generally). 77 The Iban are not bound by Islamic prohibitions on alcohol. 78 In the past, a new longhouse may have been commenced, but today leaving is easier because more Iban now live in single dwellings. One older Iban interviewed indicated that he left the longhouse after not being elected the headman, as he believed that the new headman lacked the requisite knowledge and experience, and that the longhouse would therefore not be a harmoni ous and healthy one. 79 See Kedit, supra note 49, at 34 (stating that because membership is by choice, a family is able leave the longhouse for a variety of reasons and there may be ritual propitiation required to restore the imbalance). 80 SUTLIVE, supra note 56, at 46-47. There were other examples recalled during interviews at the longhouse. For example, the case of a wife who was having an adulterous affair and who after a series of mediations would not agree to end that adulterous relationship. She had to leave the longhouse community.</page><page sequence="15">2005] Animistic Dispute Resolution 15 the conflict could be agreed to, partition or removal was inevitable. Con tinued dissension within a longhouse is believed to have wide-ranging repercussions for all members, including illness, crop failures, and all types of misfortune, while good fortune and success requires social cohe sion. As one author notes: [L]onghouse members are compelled to settle their differences. In the case of major ritual festivals as well, all are opened by admonitions delivered by the community leaders present to all of those who have gathered enjoining them to put aside their past grievances, avoid quar relling and breach of adat, for the success of the rituals they perform depends upon their preserving social harmony amongst themselves.81 w uiim me îoiiguuuse me uiik ueiween uuui, augury, aiiu uispuie resolution has continued and is apparent in varying degrees today. It was evident from the interviews with Iban that no clear demarcation between the secular and spiritual occurs. Disputes and difficulties between mem bers could be remedied in two ways: first, through the supervision of the headman by secular means (such as restitution, compensation, or apol ogy); or secondly, by ritualistic means with the medicine man (augur) casting spells, chanting to bring the good spirits to the longhouse, and performing age-old ceremonies. Animals such as chickens and pigs are still sacrificed to redress wrongs. Meaning is attributed to the state and color of their organs and, in particular, the heart and liver. Offerings, such as herbs, rice, and leaves, are hung in baskets to keep away bad spirits, and charms are used for safe protection. 2. Disputes between Members of Different Longhouses When members of different longhouses are in dispute, it is custom ary for the headman or an influential elder of each longhouse to mediate between the disputing parties. Disputes and complaints in this situation are not resolved by one headman providing a settlement, but by one or both headman negotiating or mediating with the aim of persuading the disputants to settle their difference amicably and in accordance with adat. While disputes over land use issues rarely arise within a long house, these occur more frequently between different longhouse commu nities.82 Negotiated and mediated settlement has been the favored proc ess for resolution of these matters. In earlier times, the disputes which could not be settled by negotiation or mediation were resolved by physi 82 Sather, supra note 52, at xxx. Cramb &amp; Wills, supra note 48,</page><page sequence="16">16 WILLAMETTE J. INT'l L. &amp; DISPUTE RESOLUTION [Vol. 13:1 cal contest, such as fights,83 ordeals,84 and self-help remedies.85 Today, however, today intervention by a government agent, such as the District Officer, police, or the courts, is more likely. Iban, through their headman and elders, seek to settle disputes without recourse to violence by "re straining the two sides and acting with their consent as negotiating agents. Such intervention was strongly supported by Iban values, particu larly by the notion that a breach of adat or unresolved contention posed a collective spiritual danger to the well-being of all community mem bers."86 One of the Iban interviewed described a dispute concerning a miss ing motorcycle that belonged to a youth in his longhouse. It was sighted outside another longhouse several kilometers away. The sighting aroused suspicions, which were immediately reported to the headman who, after discussion, went to see the headman of the other longhouse. This led to an nnpn dismission with the nernetratnr's familv and other longhouse representatives under the guidance of the two headmen. The settlement reached was for the motorcycle to be returned together with a small sum of money to compensate for the petrol used and for the anxi ety caused. It was thought that the perpetrator might have received sub sequent additional punishments from his longhouse's headman, although this was not articulated. The quick intervention taken by the headman was seen as a more effective process than involving the agents of the state, such as police or lawyers. However, it was indicated that if a satis factory settlement had not been forthcoming, the matter would have been referred to the police. Utilizing the state apparatus for dispute resolution is a "last resort" option, consistently described as less satisfactory be cause the ill will between the longhouse communities would be exacer bated. Involving police, lawyers, and courts goes against the Iban prin ciple of "making large things small." Although there is generally cultural homogeneity amongst the Iban 83 Where mediation failed, disputes over land were traditionally settled by fights with wooden clubs in accordance with strict and elaborate rules. 84 See Iban Adat AND AUGURY, supra note 52, at xxii (describing, for example, in the past a dispute might be settled, or an accused might establish his or her innocence by means of a formal contest or ordeal, such as a diving contest, in which the victor was the one who could stay under water the longest; a cock fight; the dipping of hands into boiling water, or into a fire, with the victor the one keeping his or her hands in the longest. These ordeals are no longer undertaken. The rationale for these ritualized conventions was to restrain the extension of violence between communities, by confining it to the disputants. It may also have served as an inducement to settle through mediation). 85 In property matters this included the seizure of an item that was the object of an ownership dispute. 86 Sather, supra note 52, at xxiii-xxiv.</page><page sequence="17">2005] Animistic Dispute Resolution 17 of Borneo, there can be local variation in adat, particularly between longhouses, so intra-longhouse disputes rely on general principles rather than precise formulations. The basic principle is that each party should respect the adat of the other.87 3. Disputes Between Iban and Non-Iban In the past, there was no mechanism for settling disputes between Iban and the people of other tribes, other than warfare and violent means. Where kinship ties did not exist, persistent feud and warfare prevailed.88 The elimination of the blood feud, headhunting, and warring raids was a high priority of the Sultanate and during the British residency. Until that time, headhunting—with head-taking as an integral component89—was imperative in Iban culture as it underpinned rituals crucial to the well being of the community and was a practice widespread amongst most Dayaks.90 While anthropologists warn about generalizing or simplifying a complex practice,91 the symbolism of head-taking and Dayak identity92 remains strong today, as evidenced by recent Dayak actions against the Madurese in Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo.93 Today, disputes between Iban and non-Iban will be sorted out by a range of measures from "lumping it" to direct negotiation or by utilizing third party mechanisms such as lawyers, the police, district officers, and the local courts. The headman may occasionally represent a member of his longhouse in a dispute with an outsider, though usually it is done on an individual basis, or by the head of the bilik family.

A dispute of this type was recounted involving a European who had been befriended by a longhouse community and then subse quently spoke in disparaging terms about one of its members.

Survival of Iban Dispute Resolution in 21 st Century Iban dispute resolution was developed to meet the specific needs of the people in an era long past. It was a time when the legal-political en tity of the nation state94 had no relevance. The impact of the state on mi nority indigenous cultures and practices in Southeast Asia has been con siderable and acknowledged.95 The specific ramification for the traditional dispute resolution process is that the exclusivity of traditional ways has been replaced with a competing and complementary process. The formal legal institutions of the state, which in Brunei Darussalam in clude the parallel secular common law courts and Syariah courts, provide strong and legitimate alternatives to the unofficial forms of social order ing and dispute resolution. Additionally, modern forms of communica tion have given exposure to different values and ways of life. An in creasing number of Iban and others leave the remote and rural areas for education or work in the larger towns. Once in the towns, the kinship and bonds that united the inhabitants of the longhouse are replaced by considerable social and economic independence and greater anonymity. In rural areas, single dwellings are becoming more popular than the longhouses. The practices that had relevance in the longhouse are seen as anachronistic, and adat can prove "ineffective in dealing with many of the problems of contemporary life."96 All these factors mean that tradi 94 Winzeier, supra note 6, at 1 (referring to the status of a nation state as a legal-political entity with a sovereign government exercising supreme authority over a relatively fixed population within well-defined territorial boundaries). 95 See id. at 6.

In the more rural and remote areas where the complex kinship and economic ties still exist, mediations by the headman continue. Two ad ditional factors, however, are affecting the continuing survival of this in digenous form of dispute resolution: the role of the headman is changing to accord with government policy and the direct impact of MIB. A. Changing Role of the Headman Today, the role of headman is a recognized Government position and a small stipend is paid. The headmen still need other sources of in come, so they increasingly turn to the government for work97 as clerks and teachers, or in the Temburong quarry mines, rather than their tradi tional work as farmers growing rice and vegetables. As the government regards the headmen as administrators and spokesmen for the longhouse community, their role increasingly involves dealing with the state. Ac cordingly, they have become the intermediaries through which govern ment policy is articulated and implemented. By assuming these adminis trative functions, another agent has entered the dynamics of the longhouse, and so the role of the headman is becoming increasingly insti tutionalized and subject to bureaucratic constraints. This alters the na ture of the headman's intervention in disputes, as accommodation of government policy brings external factors into the process. The imposi tion of bureaucratic functions introduces an external accountability into the running of the longhouse. This can give rise to a situation of institu tional dissonance, "where local-level institutions and those of the state, being based on different principles and concepts and serving different ends, do not adequately mesh."98 B. Impact of MIB More significant for the survival of traditional Bornean processes for dispute resolution in Brunei Darussalam is whether indigenous groups, such as the Iban, can continue to resist the pull of the dominant Malay culture and Islamic religious and political priorities. The "Me layu" component of the MIB ideology strives to negate a multi-cultural society by promoting mono-culturalism. Although a poly-ethnic society, the national culture is held to be that of the Brunei Malay, which the government justifies on the basis that there "has been a long-standing ac 97 The Iban refer to working for the government as "getting the golden spoon." There is a per ception that government employees receive high income for little work when compared to those who work in the fields. 98 Cramb &amp; Wills, supra note 48, at 357.</page><page sequence="20">20 WILLAMETTE J. INT'l L. &amp; DISPUTE RESOLUTION [Vol. 13:1 ceptance, by all groups, of the Brunei Malay Culture as the dominant fea ture of national culture."99 The long-standing aspect of dominance is derived from historical and anthropological research. The stratified social organization of the Brunei Malays with the Sultan as their unitary head allowed the Malays to assert dominance over other ethnic Bornean groups who were egalitar ian and acephalic. There is 19th Century evidence to suggest that those who were counted as ethnic Bruneis, in contrast to the Kedayan, Belaits, Tutong, Dusun, Murut, and Iban, were in "some sense considered supe rior."100 This differentiation between the Malays and other indigenous people is still apparent and is reflected in the pre-eminence of the Malay in the national psyche. It is also reflected in the categorization of six of these indigenous ethnic groups as Malay for the purposes of national ity,101 which has been viewed as treating non-Malay culture as inferior or inconsequential, thereby warranting absorption into the Malay. Braigh 4-f, « *—« TT4 AI V T /4 A a4-, «A /V A *A « ,4" A + &lt; AM 4 C% A 4 *A AM \ ^A 1 A « T 4« 111U1 UJV1 il^VJ IW U11J V1VTT; UVlVVUllg Uli imp UIU11V11 111UI 11V/11 i.TXMAUJ' ill digenous groups are seen as "[lacking] enough authentic culture or valu able culture to be considered anything better than 'sub-groups' of the dominant Malay population."102 The consequence for dispute resolution is that non-Malay processes, while not banned or prohibited, are seen as inferior and not in keeping with national culture. This is because they are informed by adat based on animism and, for Muslims, pagan traditions. With MIB endorsing Malay culture and Islam, non-Malay culture is conversely perceived to be incongruent. If one's culture of longhouses, augury, myths, music, rituals, and festivals is seen in national terms as inferior, it becomes in creasingly harder to sustain these age old processes. The Iban have maintained some resilience in this regard, as they are a dominant ethnic group in nearby Sarawak and comprise 20% of the population of Sabah, which may serve to validate their traditions and practices. Other indige nous groups such as the Dusun, the second largest group in the rural population after Malays,103 now manifest only remnants of their past cul tural system. One author reports that only one Dusun longhouse remains 99 Dato Paduka Haji Matussin bin Omar, The Making of a National Culture: Brunei's Experi ence, in CULTURES IN ASEAN &amp; THE 21 st Century 12 (Edwin Thumboo ed., 1996). 100 Donald E.

This had a "status affirming affect" for the Dusun, who increasingly consider their own language as "archaic."106 Knowledge of indigenous "folk medicine, heal ing practices, agricultural rituals, life-cycle rituals, mythology and folk tales"107 is in decline. Braighlinn considers that as the Malays see them selves as the "authentic heirs to the country," it entitles them to "demand that non-Muslim practices which offend them are kept out of sight."108 Iban children today are immersed in an education system that requires them, as non-Muslims, to attend classes on Islam and MIB, to speak and write in Malay, and to dress in accordance with Islamic requirements. The institutionalization of MIB into state services, such as education, makes it more difficult for traditional animistic beliefs and processes to be valued and maintained as regulators in their lives. jt\ luiuici wet y hi wiiiuii iviiD s piuiiiuuuii ui tiic maiay uuiiuic 1111 pacts upon indigenous non-Malay dispute practices is the process of Ma suk Melayu, which means "becoming Malay." This simultaneously means the rejection of previous indigenous ways of life and the adoption of Islam and Malay practices. The rate of absorption of all ethnic groups into the Malay is a direct consequence of MIB, which provides for active propagation by the Islamic Dakwah (Propagation) Centre. This is a divi sion of the powerful Religious Affairs Department, because a conversion to Islam automatically accords to the convertee Malay status. In addition to religious and social dimensions, there are tangible benefits that result from a conversion, with considerable incentives offered by the govern ment including cash benefits,109 promotions, land, houses, and improve ments in public works.110 Representatives from the Dakwah Centre visit 104 Since the 1971 Census, Dusun and the other indigenous people have been included as Ma lay in all data, and thus it is difficult to estimate demographic figures.

Once a Malay, the person also becomes subject to Islamic laws, which the Syariah courts and the religious police enforce. The steady conversion rate119 also suggests that the survival of non-Malay ethnic groups in Brunei is tenuous. One researcher has predicted that by 2050 all the ethnic groups in Brunei will have become Malay.120 Finally, the third pillar of the MIB, Beraja, which is the political in stitution of the Malay monarchy, also has bearing on the diminution of non-Malay practices. This is because MIB legitimizes the suspension of those chapters in the Constitution that provided for a democratic form of government through a Legislative Assembly. Although the 1962 rebel lion, which ushered in the State of Emergency, was suppressed forty years ago, there have been no parliamentary elections since that time. Consequently, the non-Malay's interests and concerns are denied a pub lic forum. This is in contrast to neighboring Sarawak and Sabah, where there is direct involvement in the political process with political parties such as the Sarawak's Dayak People's Party (PBDS) representing their interests. There is also a network of communal associations established to focus on issues directly affecting indigenous peoples in these two Ma laysian states.121 V. Conclusion For more than a thousand years, the longhouse domicile was the vi tal institutional ingredient, in all aspects of an Iban's life, including dis pute resolution. Adat was predicated upon longhouse living and was the means by which the longhouse community could function effectively. 117 Brunei Malay clothes include the dress of tudongs (veil), ankle-length loose gowns for women and girls, and songkit (MIB shirts) for men. 118 A Muslim is required to observe the five pillars of Islam, which include prayers five times a day; fasting during the month of Ramadan-, the annual payment of Zakat; a pilgrimage to Mecca during one's lifetime; and belief in God and Mohammad as his messenger. 119 BRAIGHLINN, supra note 102, at 19-20. 120 Bernstein, supra note 39, at 177. 121 Tan Chee-Beng, Indigenous People, The State and Ethnogenesis: A Study of the Communal Associations of the "Dayak" Communities in Sarawak, Malaysia, 28 J.

Economic forces, such as the modem market economy, have penetrated the old subsistence style farming causing Iban and other indigenous groups to seek new forms of employment, often in cities or in the coastal oil fields.123 Social forces, including the concurrent promulgation and domination of Islam and Ma lay culture, are marginalizing the non-Malay traditions and facilitating absorption into the mainstream way of life. Apart from Islamization, the increasing necessity to interact with the national government and to ad here to its laws, regulations, and controls on life have also segmented the traditional processes. The role of institutions, such as police and courts, inevitably rivals the traditional. Their presence weakens the position of Iban adat and augury so that there is decreasing homogeneity in their dispute resolution processes, just as there is in every other aspect of their lives. The Iban are not the only indigenous ethnic minority facing incre mental deculturation. While the seminal features of their traditional life style may seem out of step with the universally accepted goals of devel opment for the modem nation state, the United Nations has recognized the inherent dignity of indigenous neon le and the value and diversity of their distinct identities, social organization and cultures.124 Yet, achiev ing an accommodating position in the post-colonial order focused on promulgating a national Muslim culture is an added challenge for the Iban in Brunei. This is something they share with other Orang Asli, non Malay indigenous people of Brunei, Malaysia, and the Kalamantan prov ince of Indonesia. The Brunei's relationship with post-colonial govern ments is "analogous to, and sometimes a continuation of, that of Euro pean rulers to their former subjects."125 As Brunei continues on a path governed by the three pillars of MIB, the culture and dispute resolution processes of the Iban in the Sultanate may be more difficult to sustain 122 See Kedit, supra note 49, at 226. The view that longhouse living should continue, other wise Iban will become extinct through loss of culture, identity and traditions, is a recurring theme in the anthropological research. According to one Iban: [LJonghouse living should not be discarded or discouraged; or else, our race will become extinct, our territory split, our people have no purpose or direction in life. We will be reduced to the level of aliens, visitors without fixed abode, or knowledge of our own cultural tradition.
