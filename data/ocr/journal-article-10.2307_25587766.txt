<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHY THE DEFORMATION OF THE FORM IN PUBLIC MONUMENTS IS A SOCIAL MENACE See page 297 IN the December issue a picture by Cezanne was attacked. This was done not because of its color, since color may be regarded as secondary in im portance in any picture, however desirable it may be as an added beauty to a finely composed line-to pattern and faultless drawing and expression. We attacked it because of its brazen De-formation of the Form. Whereupon the Boston Transcript of December 18th said: "Such aberrations (as Cezanne's works) are taken altogether too seriously by the majority of critics, who are afraid of being out of the fashion." Now a fashion is something that is not permanent and is but a passing fad. Therefore we do not mind .how much cubistic nonsense and Cezannistic defor mation is used in such art-dodgers as are frankly nothing but caricatures or are used in commerce or in the comics of the day. Or when Weber and Fields, dressed up in cubistic clothing, one as a beer barrel and the other as a bean-pole, make us split our sides with fat laughter, why not? so long as it is clean, clever and heaven-blessed nonsense? But when a cubistic picture or a Cezannistic de formation of form is admitted into the great world exhibitions of the Paris Salon or our Metropolitan Museum and lauded as deserving of as much respect ful consideration, even of veneration, as sublime works of art, is it not time to take them more seriously and say, and definitely state why, such examples of the deformation of the forms of nature are a social menace? If we hope to preserve our democracy and help it along towards a higher perfection and prevent our selves from sliding backwards towards slavery, we must above all be loyal to the laws of Nature. "Truth" I cried "though the Heavens crush me in following her. No falsehood, though a celestial lub berland be the price of apostacy !" said Carlyle. "But what truth?" cries the cynical pragmatist. First of all the truth of material fact, about which there can be no quarrel. Such truths are few, but they are fundamental-witness. that twice two makes four, and three and two do not make nine. Then there are such spiritual truths as are sup ported by fact and this applies to art in a direct manner: Whether we believe in the anthropomorphic god of the Jews, the Mohammedans or the Hindoos, or in the Force back of the phenomena of nature pre conized by Spencer, Tyndal and Huxley, we are com pelled to recognize the operation of a Cosmic Urge or Volition. This Cosmic Urge is ever busy-indi cating to us the path we should follow. And, so long as we follow these indications, we walk in safety toward our ordained goal; when we ignore them, through rebellion or stupidity, we fall into the pit. Now the supreme indication that Nature gives us is-that she is eternally striving to perfect the type of every kind of thing she had created. Solomon sensed this and therefore said: "He has made all things beautiful in His time." Nature is always beautiful and never wrong-but only then when her handiwork is perfect, and she is never right and her handiwork is always ugly when her work is imperfect, be the cause what it may. Who determines that perfection? Nature herself. How? By so fashioning us that only the perfect types of Beauty can move our souls universally. Now we see types of perfect beauty persistently followed in all art from the days of the Parthenon down. Most of them were established in that apogee of Greek Culture from B. C. 600 to B. C. 400. Dur ing that epoch the most rational social structure the world ever saw was organized, and the bodies of both men and women, under those free conditions, reached a perfection of form such as the Creator could applaud. The Olympian, Isthmian and other games and the philosophy of life based on m&amp;den agacn-"nothing in excess"-were contributing causes. Hence the Greek artists fixed in marble, terra-cotta and bronze types showing such perfectly beautiful heads, arms, torsos, legs and feet, that Plato affirmed, they were merely copies of perfect types seen by the artists in a previous existence in Heaven. Those types dom inated every art epoch down to about 1860, when the "modernistic art party" rebelled against the in tuitions of mankind and the fiat of the Creator: "Seek ye the beautiful, even as I seek it!" And it came to pass that they said: "The search for the beautiful is an antique fad. The artist should not seek beauty, but the expression of char acter in a personal technique." Thus they became rebels against both nature and the finest instincts implanted in the soul of mankind. Now we know that there have been throughout history "streams of tendency," and that when a snowball begins to roll down hill it becomes larger and larger and more menacing, unless checked. Thus the initial negation of the beautiful grew and grew until it became a "stream of tendency" in the world of art. Finally Rodin the French sculptor sent forth the slogan: "Nature is always beautiful!" thus flying in the face of the fact that Nature, when imperfect, is often very ugly and repellent. Not satisfied with this he coined another slogan: "The 294</page><page sequence="2">February 1917 THE ART WORLD 295 deformation of the true in view of the reinforce ment of expression" (Camille Mauclair in "La Plume," 1900, page 22). "Rodin knew how to violate the truth" (Leon Riotor in "La Plume," 1900, page 78). "I then set myself the task of finding a method of logical exaggeration" (0. de Kozmutza in Burr McIntosh's Magazine). What was the effect of this upon Rodin's work? In 1864 he sent to the Paris Salon his "Man with the Broken Nose," in an epoch when men still in sisted upon seeking the perfect and beautiful in form and on avoiding the ugly. [See figure 1, page 297.] It was rejected. Why not? In the first place in its technique it looks like a crass imitation of the antique and could easily be mistaken for an antique find; and then it violates the fundamental law that always has governed the world of art: "Flee the ugly!" That the finger-workmanship was extremely clever was admitted. An examination of the head of Puvis de Cha vanne [see figure 2, page 297] shows that as a mere finger-workman, as a mere modeler, Rodin has had some equals but no superiors. No one ever did any modeling with more marvelous finesse than what we see in the forms of the face of that bust, though the slurring of the drapery is childish. But modeling is not art. It is mere skill-only a part of art. And skilful workmanship of any kind, devoid of beauty of design, thought and spirit is devoid of lasting value. Therefore millions have asked why Rodin did not use his great talent to some real purpose and produce some grand, even sublime works. While finger-workmanship in skilfully copying a deformed face in a classic technique is art, of course, it is a kind of art that is by mankind felt to be subversive of the fundamental reason for there be ing any art at all, which, at that epoch, 1864, meant the creating according to Aristotle or the imitating according to Plato of perfect forms. To what extent an artist shall be allowed to de part from nature and deform the perfect forms of the Creator before he becomes a social menace has become a very pertinent question. Before Rodin, all artists indulged in modification of the form. Lessing in his "Laocoon" gives us a fine essay on this matter; but no great artist ever went beyond modest accentuation of the form. Even Michelangelo did not exaggerate. The first man who dared to deform the form was Bandinelli, Michel angelo's rival, in his "Hercules and Cacus" in the Piazza at Florence. But it has worked as a cumula tive condemnation of Bandinelli. It was lampooned when unveiled, called a "sack of melons," etc., al most raised a row, and is ridiculed to-day. It is kept in place simply as an historical curiosity and warning. Rodin was the first modern man to go from modi fication to accentuation and from accentuation to exaggeration and finally end in the morass of deformation of the form! And for what purpose? To produce the beau tiful? Evidently not. Then why? No one knows! Bouyer wrote: "It is the affirmation of the con temporary ME." . . . "The romanticism of Stendhal had foreseen this crisis in plastic art which would seek to go 'beyond' the antique, or at least to create life through form in a totally different manner." That is to say, the fundamental motive of Rodin -according to most of the critics who wrote him into celebrity-was not to create the beautiful but to be more expressive than the Greeks-by depart ing from the forms of nature. It was a profound mistake, as time will prove. The epoch between 1860 and 1870 was the cul mination of the entirely egotistic romantic move ment, ending in a feverish ego-mania which bred artists who were only bent on "the affirmation of the me," my style, not your style, not everybody's style,' not the grand universal style of the Greeks and Italians. Now, of course, every work of art should have style, which means a departure from nature. For, as Goethe truthfully said: "Art is called art, prin cipally because it is not nature." But Shakespeare, the greatest of them all, said: "Hold, as 't were, the mirror up to nature." That is-since a mirror never reflects exactly that which it does reflect, we should not strive to mechanically copy nature but depart from it; but, as we value our soul, not to depart too far, if we wish normal mankind not to punish us by sending our work to oblivion. All art practice, all art-history, and the instincts of the human soul, even the fiat of heaven is: Do not slavishly follow nature in art, but do not degrade it into repellent ugliness by tortuously deforming the beauty of the foris so painfully realized by the Cosmic Urge. Consciously or unconsciously Rodin violated this command. Rebuffed at the Salon of 1864 with his ugly "Man with the Broken Nose" he came again in 1877 with his beautiful "Age of Bronze" which will live, though according to report he now calls it "cold." It was received by the Jury, but by onefool juryman called a "cast from nature" ! This served the mod ernistic party as a pretext for raising a bedlam row and brought Rodin into prominence and the favor of M. Turquet, then Under-Secretary-of-State for Fine Arts, and soon after brought him commissions galore, in the procuring of which he was aided by all the other rebellious artists who clamored for "liberty in art!" Then, no doubt because he felt secure at last after years of poverty and drudgery for others, which may account for his abnormal aesthetic philosophy, he began in reality his prac tice of the deformation of the form. First came his ugly statue of "Saint John" [see' figure 3, page 297], an almost literal copy of the deformed body of a degenerate type of peasant from Calabria who worked as a model in Paris. On this clumsy body with gnarled and deformed feet Rodin put an ideal head utterly out of harmony with the body and called it, apparently as an afterthought, "Saint John." It was laughed at by the majority of the public and artists, but bought by Turquet for the Luxembourg Museum. Now, had Rodin confined himself to deforming the form in his ideal sculpture only, no one would have ever done more than laugh at him and he would not now be such an over-advertised man. But he carried his deformation theory into public monumental sculpture also. What was the result? According to his eulogists, in every case where he erected a public monument a fierce civic quarrel resulted, and one wonders how it was possible for him to obtain the commissions he did obtain.</page><page sequence="3">296 THE ART WORLD February 1917 First came his "Claude le Lorrain" erected in 1892. It shows a miserable little shrimp of a man with zigzag legs and a head too big, utterly silly as an interpretation of the genius of the greatest landscape painter the world ever saw. It raised so much opposition that it divided the city of Nancy into opposite parties. "Dissatisfaction spread to the local authorities, who talked of nothing less than displacing the monument" as we get the report from Lawton, one of Rodin's eulogizers. Then came the "Burgesses of Calais," made to express and re cord the suffering of the eminent citizens when they surrendered to Edward III, a group that utterly defeats itself by the ugly deformation of the forms in every one of the six figures composing that un fortunate monument. How many men-gone daft with the silly idea that "personal style" is everything in art-have been al lured to call this group "strong," when it is only brutal? [See figure 4, page 297.] Note the coarse and over-deformed hands and key; note the enor mous feet which are no longer human in their gnarled and bestial deformity; note that the whole man looks more like a cave-man with a Neanderthal skull, instead of a leading citizen of Calais. The result is that while modest accentuation would have aided Rodin's hope of moving men, his ex cessive over-de-formation immediately arouses their questioning wonder and rebellion and his noble pur pose-of stirring human emotion-if he had that purpose-is defeated by the brutality which results from forcing the note of a theory of esthetic philosophy which is wrong. What took place in Calais when this creation was set up? We are told that the citizens split and quarreled so mightily that civil strife was feared. And to-day there are still many who regard the erec tion of this work as a calamity, to such an extent does it divtde the people-instead of uniting it. In stead of peace, joy and glory following the erection of this group, they have had quarrel, anger and shame. When the "Sarmiento" monument was erected at Buenos Ayres in 1899 the same thing happened. And it was bound to happen. The whole statue of the man, in conception and composition, is so over exaggerated that- it is exasperating, as a portrait, however much it may please those who hunger for extreme stylization of form. It occasioned great rage in the city, divided the people, the majority of whom ridiculed it, but were prevented by force from pulling it down. Finally he came out with his latest specimen of the "deformation of the form" in his Balzac [see figure 6, page 298]. Max Nordau said in his "Art and Artists" as to this statue: "Rodin has overstepped, in his Balzac Memorial, which he first exhibited in 1898, the very extensive limits within which his silly aberrations might have been borne. Master Shallow, who tolerates much, could not tolerate this work, and broke down under its crushing exaction. When the public saw this provocative monstrosity it broke out into that un controllable laughter whereby the outraged intelli gence of mankind revenges itself with primitive force for restraints that it has long suffered in silence. In the face of this result the Committee of the French Union of Authors, which had com missioned the Balzac memorial, resolved unani mously to decline it. In vain the Condottieri, who had usurped supremacy in art criticism by the most unscrupulous methods of conspiracy, violence and oppression, made desperate efforts to maintain themselves. They were powerless against the armed rising of sensible people who had at last come to themselves. Their tyranny was vanquished and they were swept away. They might still talk all sorts of twaddle about the stupidity of the masses, and, in impotent rage, hiss at the victors the well known shibboleths "Philistine," "Provincial," etc.; but this final, faint-hearted nagging sank un heard in the unanimous cry of scorn from public opinion. "Rodin worked at this wretched piece of work for ten whole years. First he read all Balzac's works; then he made a journey to Touraine and spent months there, so as to absorb the human environ ment from which Balzac took so many of his models and to become permeated with the feelings and im pressions with which Balzac may have satiated him self when composing-all this to make a human figure which was to be the likeness of a man whom many people now living have known in the flesh. After these preliminary studies Rodin finally pro ceeded to form his Balzac. His head was to be 'a synthesis of his works,' his physiognomy was to be summed up 'in an eye that looks on the Comedie Humaine, and in an upper lip that is curled in con tempt for humanity.' So said Rodin himself in several interviews which were published at the time when his statue was exhibited. He was then merely repeating what the twaddlers of Montmartre had chattered to him. It would be easy to make jests about this inflammation of the brain, but it is not worth even cheap raillery. It is quite enough to establish, soberly and drily, that Rodin, like a child or an idiot, aimed at something impossible. Sculp ture cannot furnish any 'synthesis of Balzac's works.' Nature herself cannot, in the sense that Balzac himself, when he was alive, did not synthetize his works, in his externals, in his physiognomy. He had perhaps the head of a man of mark, but there was assuredly nothing in his face to show that he had written the 'Physiology of Marriage,' and not written 'La Chartreuse de Parme' (Stendhal). Rodin imagined that a portrait-statue could quite alone, merely by its own means, supply the place of a biography and a psychological and literary characterization of the person represented. This patent lunacy was necessarily bound to end, as it has ended, in a mad caricature." We give an illustration of Balzac himself on page 298, figure 5, and a photograph of the Balzac statue in figure 2. The reader will see that the form has been so deformed that it no longer has any semblance to a human being. It is in fact so mon strous that it is fascinating. It demonstrates the fascination of monstrosities. We doubt if Rodin has ever become conscious of the enormity of his mis take in trying to express the entire Comedie Hu maine in one statue. Perhaps, since his friend Henri Rochefort said to him that it could not be done, he may be beginning to change his mind. Thus we see that in every case deformation of the form has brought on a large or small civil strife in every country where a public monument by Rodin has been allowed to be erected. Now all social division is a social menace. But</page><page sequence="4">FIG. 1. MIAN' TH TI-IE BRON NOSE FIG. C.

Why? Because in a public monument the public does not want, and it should not want, the expression of theories of art personal to any artist-theories more or less esoteric and incomprehensible. What the public wants and should want is the expression, by the help of the artist, of its own sentiments and aspirations. And the greatest artist is he who ex presses, not himself, but humanity, not his artistic whims but that which humanity wishes to have expressed for itself-because it cannot express it except through the medium of its gifted artists, whom for that very purpose it willingly supports. But then, it wishes to have its ideals expressed in forms of beauty, such as will surely express and stir its emotions, so that individually and collectively it can contemplate itself in the spiritual mirror held up by the artist, in the creation of which it feels its subconscious share. When a monument does that, then alone is it a masterpiece. In a public statue a sculptor should be as imper sonal as possible in the rendering of the form. Public monuments are public avenues of public ex pression. There is and should be nothing private about them. For it can be proven that deformation of the form brings on deformation of the mind, then deformation of the soul and then deformation of society. That is why it is a social menace. It is certain that there is an intimate connection between the deformation of the feet of Chinese women and the degradation of China. The idea that it is easier to express human emo tion and to stir mankind by a deformation of the form, above all in a public monument, is silly. In practice it can at most amuse the intellect of a few who lean towards the abnormal and then only for a short while, after which the practice will fill even those with ennui. For art means this-to stir human emotion and not to titillate the brain. And to inflict on the patient public what it, by instinct, regards as an atrocity, based on the deformation of form, just to amuse the intellects of a few artistic man darins in the individualistic corner of the world of art, is to destroy a golden opportunity that might have been used by some artist, in harmony with a normal majority, for creating a real emotion-stir ring and socially binding monument. If a sculptor wishes to howl to the world: "Look at me, I have an individuality different from any ever seen!" let him do it in his private work and then take the consequences-like the Teutonic ward heeler: "Shentlemens! I vent to a bolitical meetin de oder nite, und I tchompet on a dable, und I said: Shentlemens, I am here! Vell, by chimmeny, in five segonds I vasn't dere; I vas flyin ouwit by der vindow!" Royal Cortissoz says in his admirable book "Art and Common-Sense" (Scribner's): "In fact Rodin's career as a spoilt child of fortune makes a story by itself. An article in Le Temps not long ago repre sented him as saying that on a visit that he had made to Rome he was scrupulously left alone by the members of the French diplomatic circle there and the people of the Villa Medicis (the French art school at Rome) in which neglect he saw an official condemnation of his work. These people repre sented the upper classes of culture of France and were all opposed to Rodin's philosophy and work." Cortissoz continues: "However this may be, . . . you positively stumble upon his sculpture in the Luxembourg, there are so many of them in that museum." This represents the triumph of the mod ernistic art party through the help of certain poli ticians in the Paris parliament,of which party Rodin has been one of the leaders. This abysmal differ ence of opinion again represents civic division. And lately Parliament voted to accept Rodin's gift of his remaining plaster casts, etc., but against the solid opposition and vote of the Socialist members. Now history proves that whenever there has oc curred such fierce division of opinion about works of art as there has been for twenty years about Rodin's work, time will surely condemn it: witness Bandinelli's sculpture after he had descended to the deformation of the form, through stupidity. Can Rodin's deformation-made, let us hope, only through an error-escape the same fate? Hardly! A daily increasing number of thinkers are now agreeing with Cortissoz when he says: "Never was an artist kept more devotedly in the public eye. The sentimentalists have risen en masse to declare his fame, and it is perhaps no wonder that he is to-day one of the most fashionable makers of portraits in the world and the object of a cult. Neither is it surprising that he has become a little oracular in his sayings and a little complacent in his work. "What does it all amount to, and how are we really to regard this man of genius, who is also the hero of a preposterous reclame? It is indispensable, at the outset, to lay hold of the fact that the genius is there, or at all events was there when Rodin was in his prime. Nor is there anything at all esoteric or baffling about it. His hierophants, of course, would have it that there is something about him grand, gloomy and peculiar and quite beyond the scope of ordinary canons of appreciation. They are the people who in an earlier generation would have stupefied themselves making guesses at the Cor reggiosity of Correggio. Now they occupy them selves with the Rodinesquerie of Rodin. Of this it is enough to say that 'there ain't no sich thing.' Rodin is not a mystic, thinking profound thoughts and embodying them in puzzling forms. . 'What is it that first wakes a doubt? It is that these large contours in Rodin's art spell not so much style as manner. "Whither does it all tend? The genius who pre serves undimmed an authentic inspiration is con structive while he plays, and produces, one after the other, organic fabrics of design. By those works of his you know him for the great creative artist. The lesser man does not fail us in quantity, nor is he necessarily without a certain passing charm, but he remains inchoate and capricious, and by his works you know him, not for the great creative artist, but for the diffusive, unstable 'temperament.' Rodin began by suggesting that he might, perhaps, range himself in the first category, and there are among his earlier works pieces so fine that it is idle to imagine their ever falling into oblivion. But for years he has been unmistakably the man of the smaller gift, consummate in his exploitation of that gift, but none the less a man on the wrong track.. "Rodin's obvious handicap has been the quality of his mind and imagination. His is a profoundly sen</page><page sequence="7">300 THE ART WORLD February 1917 suous art, sensuous to the core, and while he has been attacking high erected themes, these have not, on his own confession, really mattered to him; it has been enough for him to caress in his marble or bronze a living form. And all the time he has been betrayed by his immense technical resource. It is a byword among sculptors that Rodin, as a modeler, takes their breath away. His is a fatal facility, if ever an artist had that affliction. "There is a burning life in Rodin's nudities. But it is a life invoked through mechanical skill and through a very earthy passion, if through passion at all. - It is perhaps the most conclusive of all testi monies to the truth of this impression that there is no one above the ruck in modern sculpture who is less haunting than Rodin. We observe his work with interest and enjoyment, but it leaves no mark. "That seems perhaps a risky thing to say of the man who bulks so largely not only in French but in other museums, who has had so many imitators all over the world and has stimulated such a horde of eulogists to unceasing effort. When one has ac counted for all the ignorance and sentimentality that have gone to the promotion of the Rodin legend one is still confronted by a body of opinion, among artists as well as among laymen, which is bound to command respect. It is still permissible to believe, however, that Rodin has been vastly overrated, that his great merits lie within clearly defined and, on the whole, rather narrow boundaries, and that when the imitators and the panegyrists have gone down the wind, they will be accompanied by a considerable number of his works." That having been the effect upon the works of Rodin, of his mistaken philosophy of the deforma tion of form, what was the effect on his followers and inevitable imitators, as a result of the "stream of tendency" that his theories and his artificial suc cess engendered? Deformation ever more and more pronounced became the order of the day in the Modernistic Bailiwick in the world of art until, finally, we get to the insane, in a "Venus" by Van Dongen [see figure 7, page 298], which was exhibited in the galleries of various dealers in Euro pean cities. Need we make any comment upon that degenerate atrocity? And yet it was lauded as a fine thing by a prominent critic in Paris! Finally we arrive at the bottomless pit of im becility in sculpture in the "Familial Life" by Arch ipencko shown in the International Exhibition held here a few years ago. [See figure 8, page 298.] This also was extolled at the time by a few aberrated fanatics of modernity in art and believers in the deformation of the form. When such things as these are seriously acclaimed as great art by would be sane critics, is it not time to ask "Whither are we drifting?" To what extent Rodin has created division of feel ing, and aroused hate in his own France is shown by the following story: In its issue of July 1st, 1910 the Gil Blas, one of the oldest journals of Paris, published one of a series of six articles on "The Parasites of Art!" in which it spoke of Rodin as a "trickster of the public," a "manufacturer of odds and ends," etc. Within a short time something happened in the business vitals of the Gil Bias. For in its issue of September 23d, 1910 appeared an article with flar ing headlines announcing that there would be held in the drawing-room of the Gil Blas an exhibition of the sketches and drawings of Rodin! This was written by the same man who wrote the other ar ticle. It is a masterpiece of pretending to "eat crow" by apologizing while in reality not doing do. Rodin was plastered over with praise. And on Oc tober the 17th, 1910 the exhibition was held in the Salon of the Gil Blas and was attended by Dujardin Beaumetz, then the Under-Secretary of State for Fine Arts, evidently for the purpose of making the rebuke to the Gil Blas thorough, and as a warning to other newspapers not to attack the Hero of the modernistic art party. Fancy our Commissioner of Education at Wash ington lending himself to Saint-Gaudens in order to force the Washington Era to "eat crow" by at tending an exhibition of his drawings and sketches, held in the parlors of that newspaper-because one of its writers had told what he thought to be the truth! There are those who look upon Rodin's extreme eroticisms as an apotheosis of love; others regard it as crass licentiousness. Some regard his deforma tion of the form as grand and significant style; others as a brutalization and a violation of the law established by nature, that, in art, man should honor the Creator by respecting the exquisite forms of the human body which He has realized in man-when the type is perfect. And the abyss between these opposing forces will never be bridged. Knowing the constitution of the human mind and soul as we do, and judged by the experience of the past, we can now safely predict immortality for the following works of Rodin: Busts of Puvis de Chavanne, Madame Vicuna, the sculptor Dalou, the etcher Legros and a few others; the statue of "The Age of Bronze"; the group "Springtime" and the bas relief "Apollo" on the Sarmiento pedestal at Buenos Ayres. These will live in the affections of mankind because they are either natural or dis tinguished or charming, beside being extremely skil ful in their craftsmanship, which is always alluring and, in these cases, has no offensive deformation of the form about them. All of the remainder of his works will, it is safe to say, never find a place in the hearts of mankind, either because they are ugly or licentious or brutal or because of their individualistic excessivism of one kind or another. Some of them will appeal to some people as a roast pheasant of an excessively gamey taste might appeal, but would repel normal people. But these works will ever be quarreled about to such an extent, that they will gradually weary the major ity of even such people as now applaud them because of their individualistic novelty. Because of this they will by degrees be slowly but surely shoved aside more and more, until they are finally either de stroyed or forgotten or ignored in some corner of a museum and used there to point the moral-that a false point of view, relentlessly pursued, will in evitably end in oblivion. The Rodin Noise will never be understood by the American public until it knows that, when in 1877 his statue "The Age of Bronze" was accused by one idiotic juryman of having been cast in plaster from life-a thing so utterly impossible, as every sane sculptor knows, as to raise a haw-haw at its very mention-the absurd penny-a-line critics of Paris - obsessed with the silly idea that skilful modeling</page><page sequence="8">February 1917 THE ART WORLD 301 alone is high art, and ever on the alert to be the first to note the appearance of a new talent so as to proclaim their own astuteness-lost their heads in stanter and became hysterical, all the more since Rodin had once suffered privations as an assistant to others. Sympathy intensified the hysteria. It also blinded them to the fact that skilful modeling is only a part of art. So they slopped over, as is common in Paris, the home of excessivism. And so they put Rodin on a pedestal, no doubt to his own stupefaction, as a new and wonderful revela tion, which was to rejuvenate and glorify French sculpture. The modernistic art party, then crystallizing, quickly made the most of this accusation of the foolish juryman, raised a row against the Jury and the Academy and bawled all the louder for "Liberty in Art!" and for so-called "freedom from academic oppression," which oppression never did exist-ex cept that the academicians obtained all the best commissions which the modernists wanted. So Rodin really became by the very force of events the standard bearer of the modernistic art party. Later on the boosters of Rodin were hypnotized to make the egregious error of mistaking his "deforma tion of the form" for a new and a "grand style"; many of them being obsessed by the absurdity that "a work of art lives only by virtue of its style," and they. hailed this excessive style as an immensely significant and sublime aberration in the world of art. Rodin, cunning fox that his privations seemed to have made of him, appears to have assumed that pontifical air so becoming to the prophet from the heights of a new esthetic revelation; he has been accused of having thrown over his acolytes the mys tic "kibosh" to intensify their aberration, until they came to regard him as the holy Mohammed of sculpture. How he must laugh now, in his halcyon days of success, and with tiches pontifically gath ered in, as in his Chateau at Meudon he reflects over the ease with which uncultured men are stampeded by a false philosophy of any kind, so long as it is promulgated with glittering and cryptic salaams! The high priests of the Rodin Cult have also talked loudly about the "science of modeling" pro claimed by him. But every sculptor knows there is no such thing. There is absolutely no such mystery about modeling in clay or marble as there is in painting in elusive colors. Every sculptor knows that the surfaces of human forms are made up of small planes dove-tailed into each other by delicate gradations, and that he is the best modeler who has the sharpest eyes and perception to see those planes, and the steadiness of nerves and patience to model them. That is all there is to it. Moreover Science has no open place in art. If used at all it must be covered up. Because art is not a matter of science, but wholly one of the expres sion, or the stirring, of human emotion. The acolytes of Rodin also talk about his using this deep science of modeling for "the intensity of the expression of life." But the public does not care a fig for intensity of expression of life-if the life as expressed is ugly, deformed or vulgar. If the life expressed is not beautiful and ecstacizing but de based and depressing, as many of Rodin's expres sions are-away with them to the art morgue ! How all this cryptic talk of the boosters of Rodin about the "science of modeling" smacks of the mystic non sense by which that festive charlatan Cagliostro hypnotized Paris a hundred years ago. When Julio Romano who, also like Rodin, had been an assistant to others-to Raphael-received after the latter's death the commission to decorate the palace at Mantua, he painted a lot of grotesque giants, etc. Many at the time hailed these as great advances in art. Even Michelangelo in his old age' praised them to Hollanda of Portugal. Neither Michelangelo nor the rest of the artists of that epoch could see that Romano's works were really part of the beginning of the decadence which marks the death of the Renaissance. If ever the words of Beaumarchais "We must laugh at it in order not to weep !" can be justly used, it is when we contemplate this sheep-like panic and "bell-wetherism," as Carlyle calls the disposition of the unthinking people to break their necks to rush along with the loudest bawlers who proclaim that this or that and so-and-so is "up to date." The craze to appear bored at everything a few years old is a disease injected into our life by Satan; it has become distinctly prevalent since 1850. It is this excessive, diseased hunger to escape ennui which generated Baudelaire and modernistic art and caused the apotheosis of the Rodin novelty. This apotheosis was largely helped along bywomen. Women should know above all that erotic sugges tiveness in art and vulgarity of form, vulgarized social forms and manners are the greatest dangers, not only to civilization but to their own happiness on earth. In self-defense they should be the first to condemn all licentiousness in art. Yet women not only condoned Rodin's eroticisms but maudlingly proclaimed them as either the pardonable slips of "genius" or a manifestation of the transfiguration of sensuality into spirituality. Others gloated over, his suggestive creations because of the subjective erotic satisfactions they derived from them. When one notices the number of women who pros trate themselves before the erotic altar of Rodin one begins to finds it difficult to combat successfully the woman despisers and the terrible indictments of the sex by Weininger. One woman art writer wrote us under December 20th, 1916: "If Rodin has devel oped his art as no other sculptor since Buonarotti, if among his masterpieces of beauty and lyric poetry in marble there are some ugly subjects or even obscene drawings, it is simply that the great artist has seen all sides of life, knowing that beauty by itself cannot fill out the whole of any expression of human nature. . "As to immorality, perversion, excess on the part of modern artists, taking Rodin as their master, let us acknowledge very clearly that here is a vigorous old man in full vigor and in possession of all his faculties, after a life of such hard work and hard ships that most other workmen would have suc cumbed long ago. Not only this, but in his old age this genius is producing work far more spiritual than any by the Academicians. "Among the 'Moderns' there are some loose livers or moral perverts. But I beg you to take me among any collection of people who are all perfect." This woman is morally so myopic that she cannot see that, while the public need not concern itself with the private lives of artists, be they moral perverts or saints, it is the absolute right of the public to flagellate every expression, in art, of licentiousness,</page><page sequence="9">302 THE ART WORLD February 1917 vulgarity, deformity and degeneracy. If an artist wishes privately to make his studio a lupanar, that is his affair. But let him not publicly defile the Temple in the World of Art! What is the lesson of the Rodin romance for us in America? this: that Rodin is the last man on earth Americans should imitate, above all in any public monument. For as sure as they do, they will engen der civic strife and hate. If any sculptor wishes to imitate him in his private work, that is his affair. He will learn, let us hope before it is too late, the truth of Emerson's remark: "Imitation is suicide."</page></plain_text>
