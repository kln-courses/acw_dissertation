Since not all funding requests can be satisfied, donors have to evaluate applicants and select just a few. We argue that their selection is based on the evaluation of the applicant ENGO's various aspects of "legitimacy" (Suchman, Acad Manage Rev, 20(3): 571-610, 1995). We test this claim by using data from 14 in-depth interviews with representatives of Greek foundations and businesses (banks and phone companies) which have funded flagship ENGOs over the period 2008-2010. We find that "moral legitimacy", which taps on the nor- mative evaluation of an organization by its audience, is the most important for all donors. On the other hand, "pragmatic legitimacy", which rests on the donor's self- interest calculations, was found to be more relevant for businesses than for foundations. Resume Cet article étudie la façon dont les fondations et les entreprises choi- sissent les ONG environnementales qu'elles financent. Dans la mesure où toutes les demandes de fonds ne peuvent être satisfaites, les donateurs doivent évaluer les candidats pour n'en sélectionner que quelques-uns. Notre argument est que cette sélection s'effectue sur la base d'une évaluation de divers aspects de la «légitimité» des ONGE candidates. Nous testons cette hypothèse en utilisant les données de 14 entretiens poussés avec des représentants de fondations et d'entreprises (banques et téléphonie) grecques ayant apporté un soutien financier à des ONGE majeures sur la période 2008-2010. Nous avons découvert que la «légitimité morale», qui se fonde sur l'évaluation normative d'une organisation par son public, est le type de légiti- mité le plus important pour les donateurs.

Zusammenfassung In diesem Beitrag wird untersucht, wie Stiftungen und Unternehmen entscheiden, welche nicht-staatlichen UmWeltorganisationen sie finanziell unterstützen. Da nicht allen Förderanträgen zugestimmt werden kann, sind die Spender gezwungen, die Antragsteller zu bewerten und nur einige wenige von ihnen auszuwählen. Wir behaupten, dass die Auswahl beruhend auf einer Bewertung diverser Gesichtspunkte der „Legitimität"(Suchman 1995) dieser nicht- staatlichen UmWeltorganisationen erfolgt. Wir prüfen diese Behauptung anhand von Daten aus 14 intensiven Befragungen mit Vertretern griechischer Stiftungen und Unternehmen (Banken und Telefongesellschaften), die führende nicht-staatliche UmWeltorganisationen im Zeitraum von 2008 bis 2010 finanziell unterstützt haben. Wir kommen zu dem Ergebnis, dass die „moralische Legitimität", die auf die normative Bewertung einer Organisation seitens ihrer Zielgruppe zurückgreift, den wichtigsten Faktor für alle Spender darstellt. Dahingegen war zu sehen, dass die „pragmatische Legitimität", die auf Kalkulationen im eigenen Interesse des Spenders beruht, für Unternehmen relevanter ist als für Stiftungen. Resumen El presente documento estudia cómo las fundaciones y las empresas deciden qué ONG medioambientales financiar. Dado que no todas las solicitudes de financiación pueden ser satisfechas, los donantes tienen que evaluar a los solici- tantes y seleccionar sólo unos pocos. Sostenemos que su selección se basa en la evaluación de los diversos aspectos de la ONG medioambiental solicitante con respecto a la "legitimidad" (Schuman 1995). Examinamos esta afirmación utili- zando datos de 14 entrevistas en profundidad a representantes de fundaciones y empresas griegas (bancos y compañías telefónicas) que han financiado a las prin- cipales ONG medioambientales a lo largo del período 2008-2010. Encontramos que la "legitimidad moral", que interviene en la evaluación normativa de una organi- zación por su audiencia, es la más importante para todos los donantes. Por otro lado, se ha encontrado que la "legitimidad pragmática", que depende de los cálculos egoístas del donante, es más relevante para las empresas que para las fundaciones. Keywords Environmental NGOs • Legitimacy • Businesses • Foundations • Funding Introduction "Philanthropic (money) giving" has a long history: not uncommon in the USA during the nineteenth century, it was institutionalized by the states and the federal government in the early twentieth century (Galaskiewicz and Colman 2006, p. 181). Over the years, philanthropic giving has spread worldwide and its occurrence has increased manifold. Available research distinguishes between those who consider the funding of voluntary organizations as a good thing and those who view it with suspicion. Thus, on one hand, it is argued that it benefits both donors and recipients: ^ Springer</page><page sequence="3">Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 283 the latter get much needed funds, the former promote their Corporate Social Responsibility image (Heap 2000; Arts 2002; Garriga and Mele 2004; Eweje and Palakshappa 2009; Galaskiewicz and Colman 2006). Yet, on the other hand, it is considered as a kind of "greenwashing" (Lyon and Maxwell 2011) or as a "Trojan horse", allowing financial elites to gain access and control over the NGOs' agenda and activities and ultimately to co-opt them (Brulle and Schafer Caniglia 1999; Lister 2000; Reith 2010). Irrespectively of whether one approves or is skeptical of institutional patrons' funding of NGOs, it remains a fact that not all supplicant NGOs can possibly be supported, hence this paper's broad research question: how do donors choose which NGOs to fund? Available research on firms/foundations-NGOs' relations has pointed towards the importance of the latter's "legitimacy", "reputation", and/or "status". Thus, Valor and Merino de Diego (2009, p. 120) report that Spanish "companies evaluate NGOs' operational legitimacy before accepting any contact with them". Also, there exists an almost unanimous agreement that a very important reason prompting firms to collaborate with NGOs is to take advantage of the latter's most prized asset, namely its "reputation and legitimacy" (Graf and Rothlauf 201 1, p. 9). Similarly, Sagawa and Segal (2000, p. 20) stress that businesses prefer to support "social sector organizations" which "have a good reputation, promote an attractive cause and [are] known by an identifiable market segment". While such economically wise considerations are more relevant to for-profit businesses than to philanthropic foundations, this does not mean that the latter would not be interested in their grantee's "good name": thus Jepson (2005, p. 517) argues that it was the donors' (especially foundations') increased interest in how their money is spent (and to what effect) as well as a number of financial scandals involving major environmental NGOs (such as The Nature Conservancy in 2003) which brought the issue of environmental NGOs' accountability and governance into the spotlight. Hence, this paper takes its cue from recent conceptual contributions (Bitektine 2011; Baur and Palazzo 2011) which argue that supporting/endorsing a NGO is ultimately based on an evaluation of its "legitimacy", "reputation", and/or "status". Our research has four goals. First, to identify a number of proxies for measuring an environmental NGO's "legitimacy", "reputation", and/or "status". Second, to empirically test to which extent donors take these proxies into account when considering funding a particular ENGO. Third, to assess which of these proxies are more relevant or important for the ENGO' s selection. And, fourth, to check whether business and foundation donors differ concerning the proxies they use for their evaluation/selection. Thus, on the theoretical side, our research will add to our understanding of the role, operationalization and relevance of (E)NGOs' legitimacy. On the practical side, it may help ENGOs in fine-tuning their approach of prospective donors. The paper develops as follows. In the Literature Review section, we discuss "legitimacy", "reputation", and "status" concepts and we show that, while they are all relevant in determining a grantee's selection, for the particular case study "legitimacy" is the "dominant form" of judgment formation (cf. Bitektine 201 1). We conclude the section by proposing a number of theoretically informed "dimensions" which, we argue, are used by donors when selecting future grantees. We then test these theoretical Ö Springer</page><page sequence="4">284 Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 propositions by using data from interviews with 14 Greek donor organizations (foundations and businesses) (Methodology' section) while in the Results' section we present our findings. We find that all donors prefer to fund educational, conservation, and research/data gathering projects. Also, the most important criteria for selecting a grantee is the quality of the proposal, the ENGO's (good) past record, its institution- alized organizational format and its business-like operation - all of which make up the applicant's "good name" in the eyes of the evaluator. Concerning some other dimensions, such as the role of the applicant's "public recognition", its use of activist tactics in promoting its agenda, or the existence of common board members between donor and recipient organizations, we find important differences between foundations and businesses. In the Conclusion section, we discuss our findings and suggest areas for future research. Literature Review Making Judgments: The Role of Legitimacy, Reputation, and Status The decision to support an NGO is not the outcome of an impersonal procedure, based on some abstract mathematical formula: rather, it is squarely rooted in some (donor-affiliated) individuals' assessment of a particular NGO most recent research has not paid enough attention to this important "human agency" aspect, focusing instead on the donors' organization-level priorities (cf. Bitektine 201 1, p. 151). In a recent contribution, Bitektine (2011) addresses this lacuna: he advances a psychological and socio-cognitive approach which deals explicitly with "the evaluator' s perspective" and, in particular, with how "evaluators form their judgments about organization" (op.cit. 152). Thus, this actor-centered framework is particularly well-suited for our own, qualitative, research design, and analysis. In particular, the decision to fund a particular NGO is a case of "social judgment", "an evaluator's decision or opinion about the social properties of an organization" (Bitektine 2011, p. 152). This judgment is dependent on the evaluator's perspective of three-related concepts: the organization's "legitimacy", "reputation", and "status". Legitimacy can be understood as an actor's perceptions of the organization, as a judgment with respect to the organization, or as the behavioral consequences of perception and judgment, manifested in actors' actions - "acceptance," "endorse- ment," and so forth' (p. 152). Bitektine (2011) distinguishes between two "fundamentally different types of [legitimacy] judgment". On one hand, the "cognitive legitimacy judgment", through which "the organization is categorized as belonging to a certain known organizational form, based on a set of recognizable organizational characteristics" (p. 156). On the other hand, there exists the "socio- political legitimacy", where "the observed features of an organization, its structural attributes, and outcomes of its activity are benchmarked against the prevailing social norms: the actor renders a judgment as to whether the organization, its form, its processes, its outcomes, or its other features are socially acceptable and, hence, should be encouraged (or at least tolerated) or are unacceptable such that the Springer</page><page sequence="5">Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 285 organization should be sanctioned, dismantled, or forced to change the way it operates" (Bitektine 2011, p. 157). Thus, "cognitive" and "sociopolitical" legitimacy represent 'two different paths of legitimacy assessment': In the case of cognitive legitimacy, the evaluation stops when the organization is classified as a member of some already known and already legitimate class of organizations, whereas in the case of sociopolitical legitimacy, the evaluation continues and the organization is subjected to further scrutiny and questioning in order to establish if it is beneficial to the actor(s), their social group, and/or the whole society (ibid). A legitimacy-based evaluation may be complemented by a "reputation" and/or a "status" evaluation as well (Bitektine 2011, p. 160). These latter concepts, albeit conceptually different to legitimacy, are nevertheless "operationally related" to it because the "dimensions" or criteria used for making those three different forms of judgment 'often partially overlap' (op.cit. 160-161). Thus, to form a "legitimacy" judgment, the evaluator assesses the organization's "perceive[d] [..] processe s, structures , and outcomes of its activity, its leaders , and its linkages with other social actors" (Bitektine 201 1; Table 4, p. 159) with the primary aim of discerning similarities with other known and socially accepted actors, and thus categorize the scrutinized organization 'as «one of those»' (op.cit. 160). In contrast, a "reputation" assessment is more interested in what distinguishes the particular organization from others of its kind: thus it will delve into "comparisons among organizations", paying attention to an organization's past actions and quality of performance in order to "identify the unique organizational features" which can vouch for its future performance (pp. 160-163). Finally, a "status" judgment would rank-order the specific organization as more "prominent", more "prestigious", and so on vis-a-vis the other socially accepted (i.e., "legitimate") organizations of its kind (pp. 161-162). However, in real-life situations not all four forms of social judgments ("cognitive" and "sociopolitical legitimacy", "reputation", and "status") need to be made: rather, depending on which "particular question [is] most important to the evaluator", one "dominant judgment form" is likely to be selected depending on the "task characteristics, the evaluator' s social environment, the evaluator' s personality (values, risk aversion, etc.), and, finally, the stakes/importance of the decision to the evaluator" (Bitektine 2011, pp. 168-170). While "the selection of the dominant judgment form should be regarded as a nondeterministic process", certain combinations of factors make it more likely that a particular form of judgment will be selected (p. 169) and these are shown in Table 1. We argue that for our case study, i.e., the funding of environmental NGOs by businesses/foundations, the most likely "dominant form of judgment" is the sociopolitical legitimacy one. We base this claim on the assessment of the "task characteristics", "social environment", and "stake/importance" factors, since our research design did not allow for the collection of personal information which could offer us clues on the "evaluator's individual properties" factor (see Methodology section). Thus, the decision to fund an ENGO: (a) obviously results in "support with respect to the NGO"; (b) is taken within the "highly institutionalized framework" of the businesses "Corporate Social Responsibility or the foundations" "Mission â Springer</page><page sequence="6">286 Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 Table 1 Factors promoting selection of a particular form of judgment (from Bitektine, 201 1; Table 7, p. 170) Factors Judgment Task Social Evaluator' s Stakes/importance forms characteristics environment individual properties Cognitive Routine, low- Simple, Unwilling/unable Low visibility of the legitimacy involvement, "scripted" to invest time judgment, low stakes, "nonissue" task interactions and effort in low perceived risk decision making Sociopolitical Judgment can Highly Socially High visibility of the legitimacy result in support institutionalized conscious, judgment (allows or sanction with "activist" and/or evaluator to "make a respect to the "conformist" statement'Vdisplay organization conformance) Reputation Resolution of High likelihood Low trust, willing High economic/social uncertainty with of opportunistic to do the "due stakes respect to future behavior diligence" behavior Status Resolution of High degree of Status conscious, High visibility of the uncertainty with social status seeking, judgment (allows respect to future stratification unwilling to evaluator to send a behavior, status invest much status signal) signaling time and effort guidelines"; and, (c) is a "high visibility" decision, all of which point towards the relevance and appropriateness of a "sociopolitical legitimacy" judgment. Concerning the remaining forms of judgment, they are either insufficient or of lesser importance for our case study. Thus, the "cognitive legitimacy" form of judgment is insufficient since, as Bitektine (201 1), p. 157) rightly argues, "cognitive legitimacy [..] spares the organization from increased scrutiny and distrust of external social actors [..] the evaluation stops when the organization is classified as a member of some already known and already legitimate class of organizations". It rather represents the necessary condition for a donor to even contemplate funding an ENGO: once the latter has passed this rule-of-thumb test then "the evaluation continues and the organization is subjected to further scrutiny and questioning in order to establish if it is beneficial to the actor(s), their social group, and/or the whole society " (Bitektine 20 1 1 , p. 1 57). On the other hand, the "reputation" and "status" judgments would be relevant yet, as we will show in the next sub-section, they will be used to complement certain socio-political legitimacy sub- categories' judgments, either when ranking is necessary (in which case "status judgments" also come into play) or when the supplicant ENGO's past record/ distinctiveness is assessed ("reputation judgment"). Measuring "Sociopolitical Legitimacy" Because of the different potential "beneficiaries", sociopolitical legitimacy runs over a "continuous scale" from "pragmatic" at one end to "moral" at the other end Ö Springer</page><page sequence="7">Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 287 (Bitektine 201 1, p. 158-159). According to Suchman (1995), "pragmatic legitimacy rests on the self-interested calculations of an organization's most immediate audiences" (p. 578) while "moral legitimacy",1 "unlike pragmatic legitimacy [..] rests not on judgments about whether a given activity benefits the evaluator, but rather on judgments about whether the activity is 'the right thing to do.'" (p. 579). For analytical reasons, the two socio-political legitimacy's types, the "prag- matic" and "moral" ones (Bitektine 2011, p. 158-159), are usually decomposed into more fine-tuned sub-categories. In this section we discuss what each sub- category stands for and we suggest criteria, or "dimensions", for operationalizing its measurement. Furthermore, we highlight those dimensions which may also serve for "reputation" or "status" judgments. Pragmatic Legitimacy Suchman (1995) breaks down pragmatic legitimacy into the "exchange", the "influence", and the "dispositional" sub-categories. "Exchange legitimacy" stands for "support for an organizational policy based on that policy's expected value to a particular set of constituents" (Suchman 1995, p. 578). Thus, the donors provide the ENGOs with resources in anticipation of some kind of reward. This is self-evident in "transactional"/" strategic" co-operations, such as event sponsoring or cause-related marketing: donors hope to get a return benefit of increased revenues, brand building, favorable publicity, and public goodwill, as well as improved "employee moral and retention" (Berglind and Nakata 2005, pp. 447^448; Rondinelli and London 2003, pp. 61-63). Some of these benefits are also relevant to "philanthropic" giving: while most donors would maintain that "[o]ur expectation was a thank-you note and a small sense of self- congratulations and nothing more" (Austin 2000, p. 73, quoting a Timberland's Chief Operating Officer on the "philanthropic" giving of some pairs of boots), it is never just that. "The gift of money is something that is given, received, and somehow repaid" (Stirrat and Henkel 1997, in Reith 2010, p. 448) and, at the most basic and encompassing level, a possible repayment can be "crudely stated [as] 'Give us the money and we will splash your name over some appropriate surface'." (Elkington 1998, p. 224). Obviously, the more conspicuous the "surface" it gets its "name... splashed over", the better for a donor. We argue that one appropriate indicator of that "surface's" conspicuousness is the recipient ENGOs' public recognition: donors would prefer to support a well-known ENGO for publicity reasons, so that their contribution reaches the largest possible audience. Thus, the first proposition we are going to test: Proposition 1 (PI) The ENGO is selected due to its public recognition/known name. It is obvious that this dimension is also relevant and may be used for status judgments since, in attempting to establish the applicant's 'public recognition/ 1 Also referred to as 'normative legitimacy' in most other accounts. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="8">288 Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 known name', the evaluator necessarily compares the ENGO to others and tries to assess where the applicant stands in the list. In the case of "influence legitimacy", "constituents support the organization not necessarily because they believe that it provides specific favorable exchanges, but rather because they see it as being responsive to their larger interests" (Suchman 1995, p. 578). Thus organizations have "to be co-opted, so to speak", either by adopting their audiences' standards of performance or by giving them access to their own policy-making structures (ibid.). We will discuss these two points in turn. On the one hand, the issue of "co-option" features prominently in the literature concerning the funding of ENGOs. Thus, US scholars in particular, taking their cues from elitism theory, have argued that flagship ENGOs are the preferred recipients of foundation giving since the former are "in tune" and/or are willing to conform with the latter' s (conservative) social and political agenda (e.g., Barker 2008; Brulle and Jenkins 2005; Brulle 2000; Dowie 2002, yet see Delfín and Tang 2007, who report a rather even distribution of foundation money across the ENGO population). Similar claims have been made concerning the ENGOs' attempts to secure funding from international bodies such as the EU or the World Bank (e.g., Chartier and Deleage 1998) or from businesses (e.g., Ramutsindela 2010; Baur and Schmitz 2012). Thus, a growing body of research argues that the cooperation between the international financial elites and conservation ENGOs are guided, serve and promote the former's neoliberal, capitalist agenda (MacDonald 2010; Holmes 2011). Accordingly, the projects which would command "influence legitimacy" - and consequently get funded - would be those which are not at odds with the financial elites' socio- economic interests. These are particularly the so-called first generation environ- mental issues, such as wildlife and nature protection and conservation (Mitchell et al. 1991). On the contrary, "second generation" issues (such as pollution) and "third generation" ones (such as global warming) will feature less prominently precisely because their root causes can be easily traced back to mainstream industrial and financial practices, that is, the donors' own turf (cf. Brulle and Schafer Caniglia 1999). Accordingly, we anticipate that P2 The ENGO is selected because its proposed/existing project concerns 'first generation ' environmental problems , precisely because such projects conform to the donors' larger interests. On the other hand, "the surest indicator of ongoing commitment to constituent well-being is the organization's willingness to relinquish some measure of authority to the affected audience" (Suchman 1995, p. 578), and "board interlocks" (i.e., having board members in common) between funding bodies and ENGOs can serve that purpose. By no means a rarity,2 board interlocking is considered an organizational strategy for co-opting adversaries and minimizing environmental threats (cf. Galaskiewicz 1985) and it can boost an ENGO's "influence legitimacy" 2 Hoffman and Bertels (2009) report that of all the board members US ENGOs had in common with other organizations, 59.27 and 51.85 % had been with foundations and/or corporations (for the years 2000 and 2005, respectively). Springer</page><page sequence="9">Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 289 since it personifies the interests' compatibility between an ENGO and its donors. Hence, P3 The ENGO is selected due to the existence of board interlocks with the donor. The final pragmatic legitimacy sub-category is the "dispositional" one. Highly anthropomorphic, partly relating to "influence legitimacy" yet also meshing into the "moral legitimacy" domain (see next section), dispositional legitimacy is accorded "to those organizations that 'have our best interests at heart,' that 'share our values,' or that are 'honest,' 'trustworthy,' 'decent,' and 'wise'" (Suchman 1995, p. 578). Here, it is the organization's "good character" or "reputation" which is assessed (op.cit. 588). This kind of 'reputation' can be considered as a " generalized favorability " which "is about evaluations of the organization as an aggregated whole, rather than about evaluations of its ability to provide certain outputs that meet the perceivers' specific needs" (Lange et al. 2011, p. 165). This process 'is consistent with a common theme in psychology - that humans engage in continuous and intuitive evaluative processes whereby environmental stimuli are sorted into approach-avoidance (good-bad) categories' (ibid.). Dispositional legitimacy can rest "on the reputation of [the organization's] key personnel in previous endeavors" and "may be reinforced by the use of character references , who are willing to vouch for the untested entity's innate reliability" (Suchman 1995, p. 588; see Valor and Merino de Diego 2009, pp. 115, 118 and Seitanidi and Crane 2009, pp. 419-422, for evidence). Thus, P4 The ENGO is selected due to its "good name " ( which can be established either by the evaluator's own experience or by the vouching of other sources). Moral Legitimacy "Moral legitimacy" also breaks down in four sub-categories: the "consequential", "procedural", "structural/categorical" and "personal" ones. "Consequential legitimacy" bases an organization's appropriateness on "what [it] accomplishes]", on the "quality and value" of either its current output or of its past record (op.cit. 580), and thus partly overlaps with the pragmatic legitimacy's sub-category of "dispositional legitimacy". Accordingly, The ENGO is selected due to: (P5a) the quality of its proposal ; (P5b) its good past-projects ' record. The second criterion, may also be used for "reputation judgments" since it rests on past performance (cf. Bitektine 201 1, p. 162). However, some "outputs are inherently difficult to measure" (Suchman 1995, p. 580), thus hindering the consequential legitimacy's assessment. In such instances, evaluators can fall back on assessments of "procedural" and "structural/categor- ical" legitimacies. "Procedural legitimacy" rests on the use of "proper means and procedures" for doing business: "In the absence of clear outcome measures [..] 'sound practices' may serve to demonstrate that the organization is making a good faith effort to achieve valued, albeit invisible, ends" (Suchman 1995, p. 580). The stress here is not on what outcomes you achieve (that is dealt with in "consequential Ö Springer</page><page sequence="10">290 Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 legitimacy" judgments) but rather on how you go about achieving them. "Structural/categorical" legitimacy can also "serve as easily monitored proxies for less visible targets of evaluation, such as strategies, goals, and outcomes": In this case, audiences see the organization as valuable and worthy of support because its structural characteristics locate it within a morally favored taxonomie category [..] Meyer and Rowan (1991:50) asserted that institution- ally prescribed structures convey[s] the message that an organization "is acting on collectively valued purposes in a proper and adequate manner" (Suchman 1995, p. 581). We argue that an applicant's "procedural" and "structural/categorical" legiti- macies can be "demonstrated" to evaluators in two ways. The first relates to the operational and structural characteristics of the ENGO: they have to be of the type that the donors themselves can recognize and value, i.e., they must have characteristics of a professional (economic) entity. This needs to be the case, on one hand, since "similarity breeds connection" (the well-known concept of "homophily", see McPherson et al. 2001). On the other hand, the requirements and evaluation processes attached to grants can only be met by a grantee which is itself 'professionally' organized (cf. Delfín and Tang 2008, pp. 611-613), and only "institutionalized" ENGOs, which use professional paid staff and have a clear (and usually hierarchical and centralized) organizational format (cf. Diani and Donati 1999; van der Heijden 1999; Carter 2001), are up to the task. Accordingly, P6a The ENGO is selected due to its * institutionalized * structure and its professional procedures (i.e. existence of paid staff, chain-of-commandy specialized expertise , business-like procedures , etc.). The second way relates to the tactics the applicant ENGO uses for promoting its agenda. An ENGO' s "institutionalization" is not merely an issue of organizational structure: social movement organizations (SMO) scholars define "institutionalization" as a "whole set of transformations in the course of which an SMO becomes more like a party or an interest group. This 'set' includes the stabilization of an SMO's resource flow, the development of its internal structure, the moderation of its goals, the conventionalization of its action repertoire, and its integration into established systems of interest mediation" (Kriesi 1 996, p. 1 56). As a matter of fact, structure and tactics are dialectically connected: formalized and professionalized SMOs tend to engage in institutionalized tactics because they suit their structure while, at the same time, their formalized structure and tactics make it easier to gain access and cooperate with entities which have and value the same modus operandi (op.cit. 1 58). Thus, a number of authors have linked the moderation of ENGOs' tactics to their institutionalization (cf. Kriesi 1996; Rootes 1999; Dryzek et al. 2003). Accordingly, we maintain that the tactics an ENGO uses would condition its funding, irrespectively of goals and outcomes. Brulle and Jenkins (2005, p. 160) note that "foundations are far more comfortable with groups that engage in lobbying, litigation, and public educational work and shun protest tactics" while "organizations that continue to engage in confrontational tactics are likely to have their funding removed" (Jenkins 1987, p. 301, cited in Brulle and Schafer Caniglia Springer</page><page sequence="11">Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 291 1999, p. 10). This holds a fortiori for businesses: Elkington points out that "the [environmental] NGO type likely to be most in demand, both with businesses and public sector organizations", is one which has an " integrator " profile which involves "placing a high priority on developing productive relationships with business, and striving to identify non-confrontational, 'win-win' strategies" (Elkington 1998, pp. 228-230). Firms mentally distinguish "between those [NGOs] they think they can work with and those who, no matter what position companies adopt, will always oppose them" (Lucea 2010, p. 133) with the former having "legitimacy" in the firms' eyes because they can be used as "a conduit to attain a level of social stability that allows them [the firms] to carry out their industrial activities undisturbed" (op.cit. 188). Thus, P6b The ENGO is selected because it does not use activist tactics. The final sub-category of "moral legitimacy" is the "personal" one, which "rests on the charisma of individual organizational leaders" (Suchman 1995, p. 581). We may consider "personal legitimacy" s as stemming also from the ENGO leaders' social characteristics and, in particular, their embeddedness in (social elites') networks. Due to their expertise and their personal reputation and social status as members of the elite (cf. Hillman and Dalziel 2003; Pro van 1980), board members can play a crucial role in securing financial resources for their organizations (cf. Brown 2005; Miller-Millesen 2003). Since high-profile board members are more likely to participate in the same upper-society acquaintance and/or friendship networks with (potential) donors, they can more easily secure funding for "their" ENGOs either due to solidarity incentives or because the existence of interpersonal trust "reassures donors that their money will be spent as intended" (Lowry 1999, p. 761). Thus, the following proposition: P7 The ENGO is selected because it has ' high profile/well connected ' board members/high-level personnel. Obviously, this dimension is also appropriate for "status judgment" which "captures differences in the actors' social rank that generate privilege or discrimination" (Bitektine 2011, p. 163). The preceding discussion is summarized in Table 2: Methodology In summer 2010 we contacted ten Greek environmental NGOs,3 asking them to provide us with information concerning their organizational donors for the latest two fiscal years (2008-2010). We chose to contact these ENGOs because previous research identified them as "flagships", constituting the core and most important 3 These are: WWF Greece; Hellenic Ornithological Society (EOE); Hellenic Society for the Protection of Nature (EEPF); Hellenic Society for the Protection of the Environment and the Cultural Heritage (Elliniki Etairia); Arktouros (bear protection); Kallisto (large carnivores' protection); Archelon (sea turtle protection); Mom (seal protection); MEDASSET (sea turtle protection); Network Mediterranean SOS (Diktyo Mesogeios SOS).

While the vast majority of existing ENGOs are volunteer get-togethers of concerned individuals with virtually no resources, these ten ENGOs have been active and successful in securing donors funding (Botetzagias 2006). To give one, though extreme, example, in 2010, 81 % of the WWF-Greece's 3.9 million euro income came from foundations and companies (source: WWF Greece, 20 11, online budget). Thus, these ENGOs were in a perfect position to act as our informants for mapping the Greek "donors-to-ENGOs" population. All ten ENGOs replied, which returned a total of 95 distinct donors operating within Greece (see Table 3). Similar to other research on industry-non-profits relationships (e.g., Valor and Merino de Diego 2009; Eweje and Palakshappa 2009; Lucea 2010; Seitanidi and Crane 2009) we opted for a qualitative approach, i.e., conducting semi-structured, in depth interviews with donors. Thus, we allowed interviewees to provide us with their own meanings, explanations and evaluations of the process, while following the "traveler" approach, which â Springer</page><page sequence="13">Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 293 Table 3 Greek donors' support as reported by the ten, flagship ENGO-recipients (2008-2010) (in italics, the sub-sectors selected for analysis based on the index score) Donors' sub-sector No. of No. of supportive actions Index of engagement companies (by ALL companies) (actions/companies) Food and Beverage 14 15 1 .07 Foundations 10 22 2.20 Banks 8 12 1.50 Publishing/media companies 8 8 1.00 Shipping 7 8 1.14 ( Mobile ) Phone companies 6 11 1.83 Oil/cement/steel companies 5 5 1.00 Automobile companies 4 5 1 .25 All other types 33 34 1 .03 Totals 95 120 understands the interviewer as a traveler on a journey that leads to a tale to be told upon returning home. The interviewer-traveler wanders through the landscape and enters into conversations with the people encountered. The traveller explores the many domains of the country, as unknown territory or with maps, roaming freely around the tem tory . The traveller may also deliberately seek specific sites or topics by following a method , with the original Greek meaning of 'a route that leads to the goal'. The interviewer wanders along with the local inhabitants, asks questions that lead the subjects to tell their own stories of their lived world, and converses with them in the original Latin mean of conversation as 4 wandering together with' (Kvale 1996, pp. 4-5). While Greek foundations constitute a rather homogeneous sub-sector of donors, businesses do not. Thus, interviewing a random sample of business donors is inappropriate since it might be too heterogeneous a group to deduce any conclusions.4 Accordingly, for securing meaningful informants concerning the grantees' selection, we needed to identify those for-profit donor sectors whose companies have had some experience in funding ENGOs. Hence, we calculated the number of individual companies in each sector as well as the total number of supportive actions these companies have undertaken (Table 3, Columns 2, 3): thus, for example, for the period 2008-2010, the ten Greek flagship ENGOs reported that 13 "Foundations" supported them in 25 distinct ways.5 In the last column of Table 3, we calculated the donors' "index of engagement" with ENGOs, simply by dividing the number of actions with the 4 Thus the Greek for-profit donors included companies as diverse as a local fish company (offering fish leftovers to a sea-turtles' rehabilitation centre) and a bank with a multi-million euros' annual turnover which has supported more than one ENGO. 5 The kind of "financial support" includes either "philanthropic" financial giving to ENGOs, where "money or products fare givenl to public charities with few or no conditions and no expectation of direct, measurable benefit" (Galaskiewicz and Colman 2006, p. 181) and/or "strategic" (ibid. 189)/ "transactional" collaborations where "there are explicit resource exchanges focused on specific activities" - such as cause-related marketing, events sponsoring etc - (Austin 2000, p. 71). Ö Springer</page><page sequence="14">294 Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 number of companies for each sector: the higher the score,6 the more supportive actions/ ENGOs the companies of the specific sector have undertaken/supported - and thus this sector should be selected for analysis. As indicated in Table 3, the highest scores, following "Foundations", were obtained by "(Mobile) Phone companies" (index = 1.83) and "Banks" (index = 1.50). In late summer 2010 we contacted all 24 individual donors, asking them to participate in our research, and in early autumn 2010 we interviewed 16 representatives from the 14 organizations which had agreed to be interviewed.7 They included five foundations, six banks, and three (mobile) phone companies: since the response rates for all donors' sectors ranged between 50 and 75 % and we have no reason to believe that refusals to be interviewed were other than random, our samples can be considered largely representative of the respective sub-sectors. Eleven interviews were conducted face-to-face in Athens while three were over the phone, due to geographical/time restrictions. All interviews were conducted in Greek and they were all voice-recorded (save one for which extended hand-notes were taken) under conditions of anonymity. The interviews lasted between 20 and 45 min. The recordings were then transcribed and each author of this paper independently studied the transcriptions and selected those extracts which s/he deemed as relevant to our analysis. Both authors discussed and agreed on the selection of extracts which are reported herein. Concerning the interviewees, they were all perfectly able to give us detailed and inside knowledge of the grantees' selection procedure. In the case of banks and phones companies, all interviewees came from the companies' Corporate Social Responsibility/Public Relations department, which has full and final responsibility for selecting which projects/organizations will be supported, and they had all been personally involved in the selection procedure. Concerning foundations, three interviewees came from the foundation's specialized "Donations/Projects" depart- ment. In the remaining three cases, where no such department exists, we interviewed the Secretary of the board: these individuals had attended the board meetings concerning the selection of grantees, and had been responsible for over- viewing implementation. Although in the case of foundations it is ultimately the board which has the final say over which grantees/projects will be selected, all our interviewees had been involved and followed the selection process closely and thus were reliable informants (See Technical Appendix for details in Table 5). The interview format followed a semi-structured approach. All interviews were opened along the following lines: "we would like you to tell us how your organization decides which environmental NGOs and which projects to fund, amongst the variety of applications you receive? Which are the most important criteria which guide your decision?". We let the interviewees respond without interruption, while checking against the list of dimensions we had identified as relevant (see Table 2). In the cases that the interviewee did not mention some of 6 The index's value may range from "1" (i.e., each company supported any one of the ten ENGOs) to "10" (i.e., each company supported all ten ENGOs). 7 In two cases, two individuals from the same company attended the meeting and were thus jointly interviewed. â Springer</page><page sequence="15">Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 295 these criteria, as soon as s/he had finished we would ask: "Would you say that [factor not mentioned by interviewee] has played any role in your selection?", and then let the respondent elaborate on the point. In the following Results section, we present our findings for foundations and businesses. Results Foundations: Pragmatic Legitimacy Whether the applicant ENGO is well known and or enjoys public recognition ("exchange legitimacy" proxy) was mentioned by one foundation ("one criterion is the ENGO's good name. . .and we can see that by the publicity it gets, how often it is mentioned in the media and so on") while the remaining four did not consider it crucial: It would not play a role [in the selection]... I mean, ours is a charitable foundation and we are not interested in reciprocal benefits. This means that our main focus is not on ENGOs which, due to their prestige and appeal may reciprocate and publicize our donation [...] We are more interested in supporting schemes which would find it difficult to succeed otherwise, and more often these are smaller and lesser known ENGOs (Foundation N.2). On the contrary, all interviewees stressed that the applicant should have "a good name" ("dispositional legitimacy" judgment) or a "good reputation". Similar to what has been suggested by previous researchers (Suchman 1995), dispositional legitimacy is closely related to the "moral" sub-category of "consequential legitimacy": thus the interviewees justified the "good name/reputation" of their existing grantees in terms of their own experience of the ENGO ("we have been cooperating with these people for over 10 years now") or their general perception of the ENGO ("Generally speaking we follow what is going on [in the ENGO field]... we read, we keep ourselves informed... [..] we follow the developments in an empirical fashion [...]"). On those instances where the applicant's standing or good name was an unknown quantity, the interviewees mentioned that they had referred to other trusted individuals to vouch for the organization: We also inquire, we discuss with people who are active in the field or with other ENGOs with which we are already cooperating [..] they can tell us "this [unknown ENGO] is a good one, we know them, we have also cooperated with it, we know this and that person"... since the really good ENGOs are very few, they all know each other... thus you can easily know who is who, what is the organization's reputation [in the ENGO field, our emphasis], whether past co-operations developed nicely and so on (Foundation N.2). Lastly, we got mixed results concerning "influence legitimacy" judgments. On one hand, all interviewee's mentioned that a project would only get funded if it fit the foundation's "mission" or "thematic axes". As one interviewee put it, "for us, ^ Springer</page><page sequence="16">296 Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 reinforcing the ecology [field] should be molded through specific axes, such as education.... or even research": thus, it is worth noting that 66.7 % of the projects funded by foundations (for the 10 flagship Greek ENGOs over 2008-2010) focused on forest management, education, and information centers (all of them, "first- generation" environmental issues). On the other hand, board interlocks between ENGOs and the surveyed foundations exist in only two (out of five) cases, and the opinion on whether they have been important in the selection procedure is split. Foundations: Moral Legitimacy Overall, "moral legitimacy" judgments were found more relevant than the "pragmatic" ones. The most commonly mentioned criteria conditioning the foundations' support of ENGOs related to the "consequential", "structural", and "procedural" legitimacy sub-categories. Thus, all interviewees highlighted the importance of the "proposal's quality" (a proxy of consequential legitimacy). Yet the applicant is rarely judged at an ad hoc project-based level. The ENGO's past record of activities as well as, and more importantly, its 'professional' character (structural and procedural legitimacies, respectively) are also of crucial importance, and, as the excerpts show, these three legitimacy judgments are closely interlinked: Well, we employ the same criteria for all organizations we fund, not just the environmental ones... it must have an effective management... that is, to be managed by personnel and by a board which can carry through the organization's mission, to be able to demonstrate that the projects it [the organization] undertakes are viable... especially when you fund a project which does not have a tangible outcome, say something is built and then you assess it somehow... [but] when the project involves personal work, we need to know that [the organization] has taken care to [...] have the correctly trained personnel to run the specific project, to be able to employ this personnel for the next 5-10 years -and not suddenly stop due to unforeseen financial difficulties... in general we want to have an idea of the organization's budget, thus we check its balance sheets, at least for the past two years, as well as its current year's budget... in order to assess the organization's management, how effective its management is... (Foundation N.5). Another [selection] criterion is how serious the applying ENGO is. [Interviewer: May I ask you what you mean by the term 'serious'? Answer:] What it has achieved in the past, the scientific personnel who will carry the project through [..Ēpauses.š.] the time schedule... (Foundation N.4). Many of the issues we have been discussing are mirrored in its [the organization's] application... I mean, who signs the application, what is the project's structure, what it aims to do, who will work in the project ...all these are certainly criteria... [..] the organization's "face" is in its application (Foundation N.2). Contrary to what we had anticipated, Greek foundations expressed the view that they would not mind funding an activism-oriented ENGO (a "procedural legitimacy" proxy) if it asked for their support: ^ Springer</page><page sequence="17">Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 297 For us, [activist tactics] would not preclude funding beforehand... since what we are mostly interested in is the ENGO's specific request. I mean, how it chooses afterwards to make its goals known to the wider public is one thing; how we will cooperate and what will we do together is another. Thus if we had a proposal for an educational programme at schools or anything else which would fit with our philosophy, well yes [we would cooperate], why not? [...] To say that we do not fund a worthy project because an ENGO might choose to promote its generic goals by some means which are not adopted by most organizations... no, this [activist tactics] would not preclude [funding]... (Foundation N.5). Finally, the foundations seem evenly split over the use and relevance of the last moral legitimacy's sub-category, the "personal" one. One interviewee clearly stated that the existence of prominent/well connected individuals on an ENGO's board plays no role in its chances to secure funding. On the contrary, another reported instances where such personal networks, and board interlocks, were the crucial factor in supporting two Greek flagships ENGOs: Mr. [name of prominent member of the Foundation's board] is himself an ecologist. He is the main reason why we [the foundation] took such a great interest in environmental issues -the great importance of environmental issues notwithstanding [...] He knows people in the environmental field and is also a board member of [name of X ENGO] and active in [name of Y ENGO] (Foundation N.l). The remaining three interviewees reported that personal recognition and acquaintances are only used for helping initial contact and play all but a minor role in the actual selection procedure: [They do play a role yet] not at the expense of quality. Of course there exist acquaintances yet they exist for doing good, not for doing favors (Foundation N.2). Businesses: Pragmatic Legitimacy Firms were found to place a strong emphasis on "exchange legitimacy": virtually all respondents stressed that an ENGO being "known", "of national caliber", "a foreign ENGO's branch", "having a positive image in the society" and so on, are very important criteria. Yet only one-third explicitly linked this parameter to the increased publicity the donor might get: [...] mainly [it matters] how well known it [the ENGO] is, in other words what its appeal to the public is; thus the company which decides to support it can get advertized. A very specialized ENGO cannot help much in promoting its sponsor (Bank N.3). [We became interested in the ENGO's proposal] because it focused on education, it was about Greece and last because it dealt with [name of endangered species] which is a very sympathetic and media-friendly little Ö Springer</page><page sequence="18">298 Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 animal, I mean, it is nice to watch ...since we are also interested in communicating [our actions], we are a company and we get judged, both internally and externally, on what we are doing. Thus we are interested that all these projects [we fund] have also a communicative aspect, that the [company's] support is promoted through these projects (Phone company N.3). On the other hand, for most business interviewees, a "well known/publicly recognizable" ENGO seemed to suggest that the applicant is professional enough and up to the task (thus linking "exchange legitimacy" to the moral sub-categories we discuss in the next subsection): In all honesty, [the applicant] being known has played a role [in a particular selection] since if nobody knew them we would not have been able to hear of their work [..] Being known definitely plays a role and, arguably, being known rests on the work done and on the ENGO' s record (Phone company N.l). Being a branch of an international ENGO, [means] most likely [that] you have very strict guidelines concerning the management of finance, its [the ENGO's] administration, its organizational plan, what and to whom it reports... all these guarantee bigger transparency, in a way... (Bank N.4). [The good name and the public recognition] did play a role but it was not the most important parameter... of course, what experience teaches [us] is that the best known ENGOs are the larger ones and that most times they have... well, not effectiveness... their work reaches more people... but again this is not always the case. (Phone company N.2). [The ENGOs' public recognition] did play a role, yes. Yet, with hindsight, I do not think this would be the prime criterion, next time we have to choose I mean. I mean, having a known "brand name", I do not think it is a sufficient guarantee that the project will succeed (Bank N.2). The influence legitimacy judgment proxies returned mixed results. Thus, all interviewees mentioned that the basic selection rule is for the project to fit the company's "thematic axes", and this usually meant educational, public awareness, and/or conservation issues: as a matter of fact, 43.3 % of the projects funded by these companies (for the ten flagship Greek ENGOs over 2008-2010) focused on forest management, education, and information centers. Concerning the second proxy of influence legitimacy, "board interlocks" between those firms and Greek ENGOs do not exist, so this criterion turned out to be irrelevant for our case study. Finally, dispositional legitimacy judgments were again found to be largely subsumed under the closely related consequential legitimacy one. Thus, the firms stated their preference for supporting or cooperating with "formal" (Bank 1), "charter of foreign" (Bank 2), "known" (Banks 3 and 4 and Phone company 1), "long established" (Bank 5 and Phone company 2), and/or "large" ENGOs (Phone company 3);and an ENGO would qualify as such due to its successful past record ("consequential legitimacy") and its formalized/professional organizational struc- ture ("structural legitimacy"). The flagship ENGOs' "dispositional legitimacy" is well established amongst the business people involved in the selection procedure, Springer</page><page sequence="19">Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 299 I know and I follow closely the work of these ENGOs, I mean we also know people who work in these organizations, thus we have a personal experience in addition to what we read in the press and hear about them. Most definitely that plays a very important role [in our selection] (Bank N.5), yet the same analytical framework is also employed in those instances when a newcomer asks for support: Of course, when it is a new organization, we often check whether it has worthy people in it, who have an established record, say, as it shows in their CVs... (Phone company N.2). Businesses: Moral Legitimacy Similar to foundations, firm interviewees stressed the importance, and the interplay, of "consequential", "structural", and "procedural" (the "business-like" compo- nent) legitimacy judgments. [..] it is obvious that when an [applicant] organization has a structure, has employees, has offices, has a twenty-year long record... then they have demonstrated by their work, their presence, their continuity and their consistency that they are serious organizations which wish to succeed in their field [..] also to have a transparent financial record, all of these are important to us (Bank N.5). Oh yes, [a professional structure influences selection] a great deal. All of that is part and parcel of the [ENGO's] ability to cooperate with a business. A small environmental organization which operates more or less on a voluntary basis and has no structures and no organizational chart... I do not think it can meet the needs of a large [donor] organization... [it would not] be able to understand some of the things a large organization might ask for... (Bank N.4). For some business interviewees, an easy rule-of-thumb for all three types of judgments is who the applicant's donors have been, since this serves as "evidence" that the organization already knows what is expected of it: We take into account an ENGO's donors... this is not the most important parameter, yet we take it into account [...] what kind of companies [the past donors] are, how important they are, are they small companies or multina- tionals, are they Greek or foreign.... since this shows to what extent an ENGO has learned to cooperate with companies of our size. . . of our way of operating (Phone company N.2). [One of the reasons which prompted us into cooperating was that] the particular ENGO had co-operated with businesses, thus it knew how businesses work, it had the experience (Bank N.4). Concerning the second procedural legitimacy's proxy ("use of activist tactics"), all firm interviewees highlighted that activist ENGOs rarely seek out collaborations or funding since "it is against their ideology", as one interviewee put it. Yet, when Ô Springer</page><page sequence="20">300 Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 asked how they would deal with such an instance if it occurred, firms proved highly skeptical of funding an activism-oriented ENGO. Almost half the interviewees reckoned that they would stay away since it might damage their firm's reputation: I do not think [we would fund an activism-oriented ENGO], no, it would be a high risk. Since if you cooperate with the X ENGO on a public awareness project and the next day that X organization goes out in the streets and performs a symbolic yet extreme action, say it paints the whole street black... there is an indirect connection, and it would not be a particularly positive one for the company (Bank N.4). Yet for the remaining businesses the decision would ultimately hinge on the trade-off between the negative publicity of activism and the positive publicity of being associated with a high profile ENGO (or, in our terminology, the ENGO' s exchange legitimacy): Well, I consider [an ENGO's overall tactics] part of [its] consistency, [its] soberness, [its] effectiveness... there are certain ENGOs' actions which might cause more problems than they solve... we do not want to have a cooperation arrangement with such an ENGO... [But again] say, to go and occupy a factory is not a "radical" action... I mean, Greenpeace which does such things has a great recognition and a great acceptance... thus we do not say "look, since the group does such a thing we avoid cooperating".... We would not mind cooperating if Greenpeace also wished to. Yet there are other groups, more likely operating at the local level, which cause more problems than they try to solve [...] If we were to cooperate with Greenpeace it would be on a very specific issue (Bank N.5). Finally, concerning personal legitimacy (applicant has high profile/well con- nected board members) we found a roughly normal distribution of opinions, ranging from the view that it plays no role whatsoever to the one maintaining that it is an important criterion. The medium point-view was that such board members simply help the initial contact yet cannot influence the selection procedure. The previous findings and discussion are summarized in Table 4. Conclusions and Discussion This paper set out to investigate an important yet under-researched topic concerning donor selection of recipient (E)NGOs. As we noted in the Introduction, most researchers have argued that it is an ENGO's "legitimacy" which renders it an attractive partner. Nevertheless, and quite surprisingly, there exist no detailed studies which make use of the concept when it comes to foundations and/or company funding of ENGOs. An exception to that rule is a recent article by Baur and Palazzo (2011) which explicitly studies how an ENGO's different "legitima- cies'^ might influence its selection as a partner by businesses. Another important contribution is Bitektine's (201 1) who theorizes how "legitimacy judgments" may relate, complement and/or be substituted by "reputation" or "status" judgments â Springer</page><page sequence="21">Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 301 Table 4 Legitimacy judgments conditioning donors' financial giving to environmental NGOs: Propo- sitions' assessment Legitimacy sub- "Dimensions" assessed Proposition (P) is Comments categories in the particular supported, or otherwise, legitimacy judgment; by our data The applicant...

Our research takes Baur and Palazzo (201 1) and Bitektine's (201 1) work one step further, by putting this theoretical discussion to the test. First we demonstrated that, for the specific case-study, "legitimacy judgments" are more relevant than ^ Springer</page><page sequence="22">302 Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 "reputation" or "status" ones, though the latter may be partially addressed through the former. Similar to previous research, we followed Suchman (1995) in distinguishing between different kinds of legitimacy and we argued that, for our case study, the "pragmatic" and the "moral" legitimacy-types would be relevant: the former is based on the evaluator's interest calculations; the latter, on his/her normative evaluations. In other words, we argued that donors would fund an ENGO if they perceived it as either "beneficial" to them (pragmatic legitimacy) or as "doing the right thing" (moral legitimacy). Second, we proposed a number of theoretically informed "dimensions" or "proxies" for measuring each legitimacy sub-category. Finally, we put those propositions to the test by interviewing a number of Greek foundations and business representatives and checking what (if any) role these "legitimacy dimensions" had played in the selection of the ENGOs the donors have funded. Since we were interested in comparing foundations to businesses and because of the highly heterogeneous make-up of the business-donors sub-group, we had to focus on just two business' sub-sectors: banks and phone companies. Thus, our findings can be generalized for foundational donors yet not for business ones: it is quite possible that businesses whose operations have a more adverse impact on the environment (e.g., oil/mining industries) would prioritize legitimacy judgments differently. Thus, further research is needed to clarify to which extent the donor's industry sub-sector influences its legitimacy judgments. Concerning our case study, we found some crucial similarities between foundations and businesses. First, the most basic ground rule concerning selection is the extent to which the application fits in with the donors' own agenda ("influence legitimacy"): donors would only fund a proposal if it fit with their own thematic focus, and this means, for the vast majority of cases, raising public awareness through "educational", "conservation", and/or (to a lesser extent) "research/data gathering" projects (i.e., all "first generation" environmental issues, thus our Proposition P2 is confirmed). Second, "consequential", "structural" and "proce- dural" legitimacy judgments (i.e., a good proposal/past record, an institutionalized organizational format, and the use of business-like procedures, respectively) are also sine qua non selection criteria and they are closely interwoven in the evaluators' mind (Propositions P5a-P6a, confirmed). Third, "dispositional legitimacy" (i.e., the applicant's good name) is also relevant, albeit to a much lesser extent: this type of judgment is rather firmly rooted in the assessment of "consequential", "structural", and "procedural" legitimacies, a fact which further highlights the latter's prominence and importance. Finally, "personal legitimacy" (the applicant ENGO having high profile board members) returned mixed results, for both foundations and business: all possible opinions were expressed, thus leaving Proposition P7 undecided. We also found some important differences concerning how foundations and businesses select their grantees. Thus, foundation representatives claimed that they do not take into account the applicant's public recognition when making their selection (Proposition PI, "exchange legitimacy", rejected for foundations). On the contrary, it is important for business, yet not only for the reasons we have hypothesized: thus, only one-third of businesses explicitly justified the importance £) Springer</page><page sequence="23">Voluntas (2014) 25:281-306 303 of the applicant's 'public recognition' in terms of increased publicity for the donor. For most businesses, a "recognizable" applicant is largely synonymous with a "professional" one, a finding which further underscores the prime importance of structural and consequential legitimacy judgments (thus PI is partly confirmed for businesses). A similar difference of opinion is found concerning the use of activist tactics (Proposition P6b). It would not stop foundations from supporting an ENGO, while businesses seem to perform this type of "procedural legitimacy" judgment in tandem with the "exchange legitimacy" one: thus, opinion is split between those businesses which would shun activist ENGO-applicants (considering them a potential public relations' threat) and those which would decide on a case-by-case basis (balancing the possible risk against the applicant's high public recognition and the boost such a carefully planned cooperation would give to their company's image). Finally, the role of board interlocks (Proposition P3) could not be determined. This is due to the fact that there were no board interlocks between businesses and ENGOs while, in the few cases of foundation-ENGO interlocks, the opinions concerning the importance of this dimension in the selection procedure are split. Our analysis offers some useful insights concerning the donor-ENGO relation- ship. Thus, an important finding is that foundations and businesses prioritize the same legitimacy judgments when it comes to funding (E)NGOs, resting on the applicant's formal structure, professional character, and good past record. These dimensions are not only important per se but they also feed into and condition other legitimacy judgments, such as the "dispositional" (good name) and "exchange" (public recognition) ones. The existence of feedback loops between the various legitimacy sub-categories suggests that future research should focus more closely on how these mechanisms relate to and inform each other across different contexts (see Bitektine 20 11, for an excellent theoretical exposition). Another important finding is that the different modus operandi and priorities of foundations and businesses do condition some legitimacy judgments. Private foundations seem to have the luxury to "ignore" their public appeal, and this is shown by the low emphasis they place on the applicant's "public recognition" and their indifference to the ENGOs' use of (activist) tactics. On the contrary, businesses are more interested in promoting and safeguarding their public image and this is why they are more concerned with securing positive publicity through their donations and avoiding any association with troublesome partners. Finally, our findings for the Greek case cast doubts over the claim, typically made for the US' political context, that donors, especially foundations, actively try to co-opt environmental NGOs, either through board interlocks or by "penalizing" activism-oriented ENGOs. If co-option is under way, then it is more likely a subtle process, centered on the prioritization and, consequentially, the funding of "first-generation" politically neutral environmental projects.
