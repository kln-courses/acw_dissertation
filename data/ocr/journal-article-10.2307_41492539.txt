GARFINKEL ABSTRACT. - Evidence accumulated in the last decade from new excavations and analysis of material from earlier excavations has broadened our understanding of the Yarmukian culture in Israel. Rounded and rectangular residential structures, some of them very large, are associated with pits which are an important component of Yarmukian sites. The Yarmukians are the first to produce pottery in this part of the Levant. A highly distinctive technique was used to adorn vessels. Flint, limestone, basalt items were extensively used. A great number of figurines show an impressive artistic achievement. RÉSUMÉ. - Les résultats des fouilles récentes et l'analyse du matériel provenant des fouilles anciennes ont permis d'élargir notre compréhension de la culture yarmoukienne en Israël. Des habitations rondes ou rectangulaires, parfois de grandes dimensions, sont associées à de nombreuses fosses, caractéristiques de l'habitat yarmoukien. La poterie est la plus ancienne produite dans cette partie du Levant. Son décor, incisé et peint, est particulièrement caractéristique. Des outils en silex et des objets en calcaire, en basalte ont été trouvés ainsi que de très nombreuses figurines qui sont parfois d'une grande qualité artistique. I. HISTORY OF RESEARCH The first Yarmukian settlement was discovered at the base of Tel Megiddo in the 1930s (1), but it was not recognized as an independent Neolithic culture. In the publication, the relevant finds were described together with other objects as Chalcolithic. The Yarmukian culture was first distinguished in the late 1940s by M. Stekelis, at the site of Sha'ar Hagolan in the central Jordan Valley. He recognized the unique character of the flint industry, the pottery and the art objects, and designated the assemblage "the Yarmukian culture", after the nearby Yarmuk River (2). Some reservations were expressed when Stekelis first presented his results (3), but soon the term "Yarmukian" gained general recognition. In his preliminary publications on Sha'ar Hagolan, Stekelis pointed out the most characteristic aspects of this material culture, which became "fossiles directeurs" for the Yarmukian : 1. Pottery decorated with incised herring-bone pattern; 2. Sickleblades with coarse denticulation ; 3. A rich assemblage of art objects, which include large numbers of schematic anthropo- morphic pebble figurines. Stekelis dated the Yarmukian culture to the Pottery Neolithic period, the same stage known as "Jericho IX" or "Pottery Neolithic A" (cf. infra) and the "Néolithique ancien" of Byblos (4). His dating was not universally accepted. Many scholars sug- gested other chronological relationships between Sha'ar Hagolan, Jericho and Byblos (5). (1) SHIPTON, 1939 : 44-46; LOUD, 1948 : 60-61.

During the 1950s Yarmukian settlements were discovered at various sites. In 1950-1952 J. Kaplan excavated the site of Habashan Street in the midst of the city of Tel Aviv (6). N. Zori conducted an intensive survey in the central Jordan Valley and reported two additional sites : Munhata and Ha- madiya (7). During this decade typical Yarmukian sherds and flint objects were found at Tell Far'ah North (8) and at Wadi Muraba'at in the Judaean Desert (9). The most intensive excavations of a Yar- mukian site were conducted by J. Perrot in 1962- 1967 at the site of Munhata (10). Rich assemblages of pottery, art objects, flint and stones were collected from the Yarmukian settlement, Layer 2b, making Munhata the key site for the understanding of the Yarmukian culture. In 1964 one season of excava- tions was carried out by Kaplan at the site of Ha- madiya (11). The excavations at Sha'ar Hagolan, Habashan Street, Munhata and Hamadiya yielded mainly pits, in which pottery sherds, flint items and art objects were found. No clear traces of architecture were reported. These data gave the general impression that the Yarmukian population was semi nomadic and pastoralist, occupying the sites only part of the time (12). It was suggested that they lived in sub- terranean pits and rounded huts made of perishable materials. The art objects aside (13), all other aspects of this material culture such as pottery, architecture (6) KAPLAN, 1954, 1993a. (7) ZORI, 1954, 1958. (8) DE VAUX and STEVE, 1947 : fig. 1 : 34, Pis.

Opinions ranged over a span of 1500 years, from the 6th millennium B.C. (14) to the second half of the 5th millennium B.C. (15). From the mid-1980s onwards, after a score of years of complete silence, the Yarmukian culture has once again been receiving scholarly attention. In Israel, the site of Sha'ar Hagolan was re-exca- vated (16) and Yarmukian remains were discovered in the Nahal Qanah Cave (17). Recently a final analysis of various find categories from the site of Munhata was carried out: flint (18), pottery (19), stone tools (20) and art objects (21). Three Yar- mukian sites have recently been discovered in Jordan (see Kafafi, this volume) : Jebel Abu Thawwab (22), 'Ain Ghazal (23) and 'Ain Rahub (24). Typical Yar- mukian items have been found mixed in fills of the Chalcolithic period at Pella (25), although the typical herring-bone decoration on the sherds was missing. It has been suggested that the earliest remains at the site of Tell Wadi Feinan in southern Jordan are also Yarmukian (26). However, these remains have noth- ing in common with the Yarmukian material culture as presented in this article. The earliest remains in Tell Wadi Feinan are similar to those of the sites currently designated "Qatifian" (27). The rapid accumulation of fresh data from new excavations, as well as the publication of material from Munhata, has led to new insights in our un- derstanding of the Yarmukian culture, as will be summarized and discussed below. II. SITE DESCRIPTION, STRATIGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION In this section the various Yarmukian sites so far known are presented in geographical order, run- ning from north to south (fig. 1) : Sha'ar Hagolan (central Jordan Valley) - Stekelis conducted four seasons of excavations at Sha'ar Hagolan in 1948-1952.

Further excavations at the Middle Bronze I village were conducted by E. Eisenberg in the late 1970s (29). The thickness of the Yarmukian accumulation was between 30-60 cm. Stekelis re- ported remains of two rounded huts and one grave, but did not publish a coherent plan of them. In the final report he concentrated mainly on the flint tools and the art objects, and the pottery was mentioned only very briefly (30). A local museum dedicated to the Yarmukian culture is open to the public in Kib- butz Sha'ar Hagolan (31). (28) STEKELIS. 1951. 1952. 1954. 1972. (29) EISENBERG, 1980. (30) STEKELIS, 1972.

In these seasons 120 sq. m were opened. One household unit and a corner of a large, well-built structure were discovered. In a trench cut by machine the thickness of the Yarmukian deposit was 2 m, and virgin soil was not reached. Such a thick occupation deposit has never before been reported from any Yarmukian site. Munhata (central Jordan Valley) - Some 2050 sq. m were excavated at this site, and the following stratigraphy was observed (33) : Layer 1 : Early Bronze I settlement ; Layer 2a : Wadi Rabah settle- ment; Layer 2b : Yarmukian settlement; Layer 3a : Gap ; Layers 3b-6 : a typical Pre-Pottery Neolithic В settlement. In the Yarmukian layer the remains of five rounded structures, some 50 pits and one grave were unearthed (34). In his preliminary report, Perrot suggested a sub-division within the Yarmukian sequence : Sha'ar Hagolan phase and Munhata- Ghrubba phase (35). However, the final analysis of the pottery has demonstrated the homogeneity of the material throughout Layer 2b. Hamadiya (central Jordan Valley) - The site is located about 10 km south of Munhata. Surface finds were published in the 1950s by Zori (36), and one excavation season was carried out by Kaplan in 1964 (37). About 100 sq. m were unearthed in this single-layer site, and the report mentions pits, ovens and fireplaces, but no building remains. Typical pot- tery, flint and art objects are briefly mentioned, but no detailed report has ever been published. Outside the excavated area, a rich concentration of flint items was discovered at one spot. The ex- cavator estimates that 300 sickleblades were col- lected from this locus, and he interpreted it as a sickleblades workshop (38). Tel Qishion (Lower Galilee) - At this site, lo- cated in the upper part of Nahal Tavor, classical Yarmukian pottery was collected on the surface (39), as well as a schematic anthropomorphic statue (40). Hazorea (Jezreel Valley) - A few sherds with the typical incised herring-bone decoration of Yar- mukian type were reported from this site (41). The pottery assemblage of the so-called "Hazorea Culture" (42), although published separately from the decorated sherds, is typically Yarmukian in form. (32) GARFINKEL, 1990, 1992a.

Megiddo (Jezreel Valley) - A Yarmukian settle- ment was discovered at the base of Tel Megiddo, in Area BB. Its main components - pottery, flint items, and a figurine - were found mixed with later mate- rial from Layers XX and XIX, and were designated Chalcolithic (43). Further discussion of these re- mains did not contribute much to the understanding of the Yarmukian layer (44). In figure 2 the most characteristic Yarmukian artifacts from Megiddo are presented. Tell Far'ah North (Samaria Hills) - In the layer designated "chalcolithique moyen/énéolithique moyen", some typical Yarmukian artifacts, mixed with those of later periods, have been found. These include jar fragments (45) and denticulated sickleblades (46). Nahal Qanah Cave (Samaria Hills) - Yar- mukian remains were collected in this karstic cave without any stratigraphie context. Well-preserved pottery vessels, some with complete profiles, and some flint tools were reported (47). Habashan Street (Coastal Plain) - This site is located 500 m south of the bank of the Yarkon River, nowadays in the midst of Tel Aviv and probably totally destroyed. Three seasons of excavations were conducted here by Kaplan between 1950 and 1952, but he only published very short reports (48). Three occupation layers were unearthed, all without build- ing remains. They were dated as follows (from top to bottom) : Layer I - Early Bronze ; Layer II - Wadi Rabah ; Layer III- Yarmukian. The Yarmukian settle- ment was established above alluvial virgin soil, and the occupation remains consist of some 20 pits. The finds include pottery, flint objects and figurines, similar to those discovered by Stekelis at Sha'ar Hagolan. The importance of the excavation in Habashan Street is twofold : it enlarges the geo- graphical distribution of the Yarmukian culture to the Coastal Plain and places it stratigraphically below the Wadi Rabah culture. Wadi Muraba'at Cave (Judaean Desert) - In the early 1950s a few pottery sherds with typical Yarmukian shapes and decorations were discovered in a cave in Wadi Muraba'at (49). This material was not found in a stratigraphie context, but was mixed with later pottery of the Ghassulian Chalcolithic. Yarmukian sites have been found in various geo- graphical regions of Israel : central Jordan Valley (Sha'ar Hagolan, Munhata, Hamadiya), Jezreel Valley (Megiddo, Hazorea), Lower Galilee (Tel Qishion), (43) SHIPTON, 1939 : 44-46; LOUD, 1948 : 60-61.

The scale refers only to the flint items and the figurine. Samaria Hills (Tell Far'ah North, Nahal Qanah Cave), Coastal Plain (Habashan Street) and Judaean Desert (Wadi Muraba'at Cave). Almost all these sites are located in the Mediterranean climatic zone. Wadi Muraba'at is the only site located further to the south, in the arid zone of the Judaean Desert. As this is a cave site, and only a few sherds were found, it may represent just one occasional visit to this place. Stratigraphically, two Yarmukian settlements were found below remains dated to the Wadi Rabah culture : Munhata Layer 2b and Habashan Street Layer III (see Table 1). No Yarmukian remains have been found immediately above Pre-Pottery Neolithic В settlements. At Munhata there is a gap in occupa- tion, and at 'Ain Ghazal an additional assemblage was recognized, termed "Pre-Pottery Neolithic C" by the excavators. III.

Group D) Medium-sized closed vessels : Dl- Sha'ar Hagolan jar, D2- Jericho IX jar. Group E) Large open vessels : El- pot, E2- large bowl, E3- basin, E4- pithos (E4a- holemouth pithos and E4b - open pithos). Group F) Large closed vessels : Fl- holemouth jar, F2- large Sha'ar Hagolan jar, F3- handleless jar, F4- various jars. Judging from their shape and size, these vessels could have served the inhabitants of the site in a large number of functions related to daily household activities. Pétrographie analysis of the Munhata pot- tery has also been carried out and it shows that the pottery was produced locally (53). The vessels are decorated with paint, with inci- sions and with a combination of the two. The incised decoration is very striking and singular, and has (53) GOREN, 1992. therefore been defined as "Sha'ar Hagolan decora- tion" (fig. 4). It is composed of three elements : 1. Horizontal lines; 2. Zigzag lines; 3. Herring-bone pattern. The potter's decorative techniques were per- formed in the following order (fig. 5a) : 1. Incision of parallel horizontal lines (around the neck of jars and close to the rim of bowls), forming a frame ; 2. Incision of parallel zigzag lines beneath the two horizontal lines, along the perimeter of the vessel, forming a frame; 3. Filling of the frames with short incisions in herring-bone pattern; 4. Painting the unincised area red. The incised area was not painted. Isolated sherds decorated with the classical Yar- mukian incised herring bone pattern or the incised frame lines have also been reported from sites belonging to the Jericho IX culture : Jericho (54) and Teluliyot Batashi (55). These probably reflect the (54) KENYON and HOLLAND, 1983 : fig. 37 : 15-16.

In addition to the pottery vessels other items were made of clay : 1. Clay pestles - cylindrical objects with pointed tips and straight or pointed bases. They were care- fully made and sometimes burnished (fig. 5b). Stekelis understood these objects as cultic items representing male sex organs (56) but this interpreta- tion is not convincing. 2. Clay whorls - rounded objects, bi-conical in cross-section and pierced in the centre, usually in- terpreted as spindle whorls (fig. 5c). IV. THE FLINT INDUSTRY The basic typology of the Yarmukian flint in- dustry is relatively well known. To date, three as- semblages have been published in detail : 1. Sha'ar Hagolan (old excavations) : 2,299 items, tools only (57); 2. Sha'ar Hagolan (new excavations): (56) STEKELIS, 1972 : 34. (57) STEKELIS, 1972. FIG. 6. - Various Yarmukian flint items from Sha'ar Hagolan (Stekelis 1972, Garfinkel 1992a). 16,071 items (58); 3. Munhata Layer 2b: 2,514 items (59). The basic data from these three assem- blages is presented in Tables 2-4. The flint knapping industry at Yarmukian sites usually used simple me- dium-sized cores. The elegant "naviform" tradition of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic В did not continue into the Yarmukian culture. The tool kit of the Yarmuki- ans is presented in Table 4. Two types are considered to be the most typical tools ("fossiles directeurs") of the flint industry : 1. Arrowheads : In Yarmukian sites, as in earlier Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites, elongated arrowheads (ca. 5-7 cm long) generally classified as "Byblos" (fig. 6 :l-2) and "Amuq" (fig. 6 :3) types, continue to be used. An innovation in this period is the appearance of three small types of arrowheads (ca. 2-3 cm long), commonly fashioned with pressure flaking (60). a. Haparsa point : an arrowhead with a tang, an angular conjunction between the tang and the body, and sometimes two pointed barbs (fig. 6 : 4-5). (58) GARFINKEL, 1992a. (59) GOPHER, 1989.

Nizzanim point : an arrowhead with a tang and a rounded conjuction between the tang and the body (fig. 6 : 6-7). This is the most popular type in the Munhata and Sha'ar Hagolan assemblages (Table 3). c. Herzliya point : an elliptical leaf-shaped ar- rowhead (fig. 6:8). Ten small arrowheads of these types were dis- covered at Sha'ar Hagolan and 36 were found at Munhata (Table 3). However, at Munhata only two of the 36 items discovered at the site (5.5 %) are related to Layer 2b. The other 94.5 % of these ar- rowheads were related to other units or did not come from a clear context (61). 2. Sickleblades : The typical sickleblades of the Yarmukian culture have coarse denticulation on the working edges, commonly fashioned with pressure flaking. At Sha'ar Hagolan, 61 such items were found, sub-classified as follows : a. Coarse denticu- lation on one side, the other side being plain (54.1 %, see fig. 6 : 9); b. Coarse denticulation on one side, the other side having regular or abrupt retouch (27.8%, see fig. 6: 10); c. Coarse denti- ci) GOPHER, 1989 : 89.

In addition five broken undetermined coarsely den- ticulated fragments were also found. At Munhata 192 such sickleblades (sub-classifed differently) were reported, but only 12 (6.2 %) came from Layer 2b (62). All the other 93.8 % items were related to other units or did not have a clear context. As this type of sickleblades was not used in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, and is not found at Wadi Rabah sites, it is very surprising that at Munhata only 6.2 % of them were definitely related to the Yarmukian assemblage. The examination of the Munhata Layer 2b flint assemblage reveals the following discrepancy : 1. An area of 2050 sq. m yielded an assemblage of only 2,514 flint items, while at Sha'ar Hagolan an area of 120 sq. m yielded 16,071 flint items. Even if we take into consideration that not all the sediment in Munhata was sieved, it is still hard to explain these figures. 2. Only 5.5 % of the small arrowheads dis- covered at Munhata were related to Layer 2b.

Only 6.2 % of the coarsely denticulated sickleblades discovered at Munhata were related to Layer 2b. From these indications one can estimate that 90-95 % of the original Layer 2b flint assemblage was excluded and spread among other layers, or was related to unclear contexts. The typical flint industry of the Yarmukian is also found in sites not classified as Yarmukian, but as belonging to two other Pottery Neolithic entities. The first is known as "Jericho IX" or "Pottery Ne- olithic A Jericho", where the flint was designated "Yarmukian" (63), and the second is formed of sites in the southern Coastal Plain (64). Unlike the pottery and the art objects, which are restricted to Yar- mukian sites, the flint has a much wider geographi- cal distribution. V. STONE TOOLS The stone tool industry was reported by Stekelis in his final Sha'ar Hagolan publication. A large number of deep limestone bowls were pre- sented (65). The material from Munhata is now under preparation, so the data have not yet been published (66). We will therefore concentrate on the assemblage from our recent excavations at Sha'ar Hagolan. In these excavations, 63 items were col- lected from an area of 120 sq. m. They were classified into different typological categories and divided into four functional groups : (63) CROWFOOT-PAYNE, 1983 : 706-716. (64) OLAMI et al ., 1977; YEIVIN and OLAMI, 1979. (65) STEKELIS, 1972. (66) GOPHER and ORRELLS, in preparation. 1. Food-processing tools : This is the dominant group of stone tools (47.7 %), including the follow- ing categories : grinding slabs (3.2 %), basalt mor- tars (4.8 %), grinding stones (23.8 %), pestles (3.2 %) and limestone bowls (12.7 %). The bowls are usually rounded, but are sometimes oval or rec- tangular (fig. 7 : 1-3) (67). Sometimes a bowl was decorated with herring-bone incisions (fig. 7 : 5), imitating the decoration on clay bowls (68). 2. Weight : This is the second largest group in the assemblage (25.5 %). The stone weights were classified into large weights (22.3 %) and discs (3.2 %). The discs are rather small items both in diameter and thickness. All the other varieties of shapes were not classified further but were grouped into one general category. The stone weights, to- gether with the bi-conical clay whorls, testify to the extensive use of weights in Yarmukian household activities. As they vary considerably in size and weight, they were probably used for a variety of purposes. The increasing importance of weights is a new development, since they were not common at Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites. 3. Working Tools : This group constitutes 17.4 % of the general stone tool assemblage, and includes hammerstones (4.8 %), anvils (6.3) and sharpeners (6.3 %). Stekelis understood some of the sharpeners as cultic items representing female sex organs (69), but this interpretation is not convincing. 4. Varia : This group includes all the items unsuitable for classification under one of the cate- gories mentioned above (9.5 %). Of special interest, although collected from the site surface and not included in the statistics, is a stone spoon (fig. 7 : 4). Such items were also made of clay (pottery vessel category A3). Stone tools were an important component of Yarmukian household equipment, as they appear in relatively large numbers. Although pottery was in- troduced at this stage, stone bowls continued to constitute an important component of the inventory. VI. ART OBJECTS The most interesting feature of the Yarmukian culture is the rich collection of art objects discovered at the sites. At the site of Sha'ar Hagolan about 130 anthropomorphic figurines, made either of clay or on limestone river pebbles, were found. At Munhata, over 50 such figurines were unearthed in strati- graphic excavations, as well as two dozen animal (67) STEKELIS, 1972 : PL 39 : 1-2, 7-8. (68) STEKELIS, 1972 : PL 40 : 1.

A variety of figurines and other art objects were dis- covered, but here we will concentrate on the most common types : 1. Anthropomorphic Clay Figurines with "Coffee-Bean" Eyes This is the most common clay figurine type in Yarmukian sites (figs. 8-10), and some 63 items, in various states of preservation, have so far been re- ported from the following sites in Israel : Megiddo (70), Habashan Street (71), Sha'ar Hagolan (72) and Munhata (73). The only complete item (fig. 9 : 2) was unearthed at Munhata (74). The figurines have often been discussed by various scholars, who interpreted them as connected with a fertility cult (75).

Habashan Street (Kaplan, 1954). The figurines are highly stylized. Many minute details, such as an elongated head, diagonal "coffee- bean" eyes, a nose, ears, earrings, a mouth, cheeks, a headdress, a cloak or scarf, fingers, fat folds, knees, and feet are portrayed realistically, and in a somewhat exaggerated fashion, making the figurine rather surrealistic. Some scholars designated the Sha'ar Hagolan figurine "the terrible mother" (76), influenced by psycho-analytical theories, "grotesque figurines" (77) or "broad figurines" (78). Most of the items are female (fig. 9), but two items from Sha'ar Hagolan and Byblos (79) represent males (fig. 10). 2. Male Cylindrical Figurines No complete example of this group has yet been found; only headless or torso fragments are known (fig. 11). The bodies are formed of elongated cy- linders to which hands, legs and sex organs were added. (76) CAUVIN, 1972. (77) MELLAART, 1975 : 239. (78) NOY, 1990.

Byblos (Cauvin, 1972), 2. Sha'ar Hagolan (Stekelis, 1972). 3. Anthropomorphic Pebble Figurines Pebble figurines have been reported from the following sites : Sha'ar Hagolan (80), Munhata (81), and Byblos (82). The carving of pebbles, as opposed to the moulding of clay, poses technical difficulties. Freedom of expression is evident, which allows the omission of much detail from the body or dress of the figure. Typologically, the figurines may be divided according to the amount or lack of detail they display : a. Detailed figurine : a face with additional details of dress (cloak) or body, usually the hips (fig. 12 : 1-2). At Sha'ar Hagolan this group constitutes 26 % of the pebble figurines. b. Face figurine : In this group an attempt was made to express the face, including the eyes, nose and mouth (fig. 12 : 3-4). Occasionally only eyes and a mouth were carved (fig. 11 : 5-6). At Sha'ar Hagolan this group constitutes 37.5 % of the pebble figurines. c. Eyes figurine : This is the most schematic type. Only the eyes were carved on the pebble (fig. 12 : (80) STEKELIS, 1951, 1952, 1972. (81) ZORI, 1954 : PL 11 : 9a-9b; PERROT, 1964 : Pl. XXIII : 16,20. (82) CAUVIN, 1972 ; DUNAND, 1973 : PL CX-CXI. 7-10). At Sha'ar Hagolan this group constitutes 36.5 % of the pebble figurines. The figurines in Group a are the least schematic, while these in Group с display the highest degree of schematization, with only the more important symbolic details being retained. We can thus take all three groups described above as conveying the same religious-ideological-symbolic message, which is even more strongly emphasized by the clay items. This creates a circular relationship between clay and pebble figurines. On the one hand, the detailed clay figurines help us interpret the carvings on the peb- bles, while on the other hand the pebble figurines emphasize the most important details of the clay figurines, thus indicating which are central and which peripheral. On the basis of this analysis, the most significant detail in the figure is not the repro- ductive organs but the eyes. With this conclusion in mind it is interesting to see that anthropomorphic figures with elongated heads, especially with "coffee-bean" eyes, were very common in the an- cient Near East from the sixth to the fourth millennia B.C. 4. Incised Pebble This group includes elliptical river pebbles, usu- ally of basalt, which were engraved in a variety of geometric designs : a. Parallel lines incised along the broad side of the pebble (fig. 13 : 1-2) ; b. Lines running parallel to the long side of the pebble (fig. 13 : 3-4); c. Rectangular net pattern (fig. 13 : 5-7); d. Rhomboid net pattern (fig. 13 : 8 10); е. A central line crossed by perpendicular short lines (fig. 13 : 11-13). Such items have been reported from Sha'ar Hagolan (83), Munhata (84), and Pella (85). Various hypotheses have been suggested concerning the function of these items in the Yarmukian con- text : fertility cult (86), textile dyeing (87), rain cult (88), initiation rites (89), and brands used to mark ownership of animals (90). We cannot offer a coherent explanation, but it is worth noting that similar geometric patterns appear on contemporary stamp seals in the northern Levant ('Amuq A-B) and Mesopotamia (91), and on clay "pintaderas" in the "Néolithique ancien" of Byblos (92). Similar items have also been reported from Khirokitia in Cy- prus (93). (83) STEKELIS, 1972 : Pl. 56-58. (84) ZORI 1954 : Pl. 11 : 1. (85) McNICOLL et al ., 1982 : PL 103 : 5. (86) STEKELIS, 1972.

Art objects have been found in almost every Yarmukian site, but two sites, Sha'ar Hagolan and Munhata, are unparallelled in the quantity and qu- ality of their artistic inventory. VII. BURIAL CUSTOMS This is a most obscure aspect of the Yarmukian culture, since to date only three graves from the period have been reported : 126</page><page sequence="13">1. Sha'ar Hagolan : A single skeleton was men- tioned briefly by Stekelis (94). A field drawing of the burial, in the excavation archive at the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, clearly shows that the body was laid in a flexed position with the skull intact. 2. Habashan Street : A single flexed burial, including the skull, was found inside a pit (95). 3. Munhata : One complete skeleton in a flexed position was unearthed in pit 738 (96). This pit con- tained Yarmukian pottery (97) and the burial is there- fore dated to Layer 2b. The same pattern was observed at all three sites : 1. Single burial; 2. Primary burial; 3. Flexed posi- tion; 4. The skull was found intact and was not removed as in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period; 5. The burial took place inside the settlement; 6. No grave goods were associated with the body. VIII. ECONOMY This is another obscure element in the study of the Yarmukian culture. No final reports on the fauna have been published from Sha'ar Hagolan, Habashan Street or Hamadiya, and the material from the new excavations at Sha'ar Hagolan has not yet been analyzed. Only from Munhata have some prelimi- nary results been published, concerning only 121 bones from both Layers 2b and 2a (98). The follow- ing identification of animal species and their per- centages were reported : sheep/goat (29.5 %), gazelle (25 %), pig (22.3 %), cattle (19.9 %) and fox (3.3 %). Not much can be deduced from the data yielded by one site, where two different layers are combined. This aspect of the Yarmukian should re- ceive more attention in future research. IX. ARCHITECTURE AND SETTLEMENT PATTERN Excavations at Yarmukian sites, as well as other Pottery Neolithic sites, have often yielded pits with no buildings. This gave a general impression of "pit dwelling settlements" (99). Thus, although some structures have been found in Pottery Neolithic sites : Munhata (100) and Pottery Neolithic A Jeri- (94) STEKELIS, 1972 : 10. (95) KAPLAN, 1959a : 23, fig. 2 (lower).

In the second half of the 1980s, clear evidence of construction activities in Yarmukian sites was published from Jebel Abu Thawwab (102), 'Ain Ghazal (103) and Sha'ar Hagolan (104). It now seems that Yarmukian structures have been unearthed in Israel at the fol- lowing three sites : (101) KENYON, 1981 : 94, PI. 228b. (102) KAFAFI, 1988. (103) ROLLEFSON et al ., 1992. (104) GARFINKEL, 1990, 1992a. 127</page><page sequence="14">FIG. 14. - The new excavations at Sha'ar Hagolan 1989-1990 : Square 1, phase 2. 1. Sha'ar Hagolan : A domestic structure and a corner of a massive public building were exposed in the new excavations at Sha'ar Hagolan (105). The domestic structure consists of one rectangular room (Locus 9), whose inner dimensions are 1.6 by 3 m; its area is about 4.8 sq. m (fig. 14). The corner of the massive building was formed by two walls (fig. 15) which met at a 90 degree angle. Each wall is one meter thick and reaches a maximal height of about 60 cm. The walls, which extend beyond the excavated area, have so far been traced for a length of some 8 m. A rectangular pier adjoins the inner face of one wall, probably to reinforce it. This seems to be part of a monumental building of a type never before found at a Yarmoukian site. 2. Munhata : Remains of five round structures were discovered at the site, about 3 m in diame- ter (106). Two of them were found in the northern part of the excavations (fig. 16, Structures 696 and 707), and three in the southern part. In addition, over 70 pits were found all over the excavated area (Table 5). (105) GARFINKEL, 1990, 1992a. (106) PERROT, 1968 : 415; GARFINKEL, 1992b : figs. 3,7.

Megiddo : At the base of Area BB fragments of rounded and rectangular structures were reported, which were generally related to Layer XX. The rounded walls were interpreted by the excavators as Early Bronze I "apsidal" buildings (107). Dothan's analysis of the stratigraphy of these remains sug- gested that the rounded walls (apsidal buildings) (107) LOUD, 1948 : 60-61. 128</page><page sequence="15">dated from the Early Bronze Age I, and that the rectangular buildings are later and date from the Early Bronze Age II (108). Kempinski suggested the opposite solution, i.e. that the rectangular buildings are the earlier element and date from the Ghassulian Chalcolithic period, while the rounded walls are a later element, from Early Bronze I apsidal build- ings (109). It should be noted that the reconstruction of the rounded walls at Megiddo as apsidal buildings is not supported by any architectural remains at the site. The Early Bronze Age I dating is also problematic, since no pottery was clearly related to these build- ings. As rounded architectural elements are now known to have been used in Yarmukian sites such as Munhata and Jebel Abu Thawwab, and since Yar- mukian pottery, flint and figurines were found at the base of Area BB (fig. 2), it seems that the rounded walls are Yarmukian rounded structures, and not Early Bronze I apsidal houses. To summarize : both types of structures have been found at Yarmukian sites - rounded (Munhata, Megiddo and Jebel Abu Thawwab) and rectangular (Sha'ar Hagolan and 'Ain Ghazal). X. LONG-DISTANCE TRADE The usual items found at Neolithic sites in Israel that reflect long distance trade are obsidian, green- stone and seashells. In the Pre-Pottery Neolithic В period such items are usually found in small quan- tities at almost every site. In Pottery Neolithic sites such items are very rare. Stekelis did not mention any exotic raw materials from his excavations at Sha'ar Hagolan. In the publication of the Munhata obsidian, no item was related to Layer 2b; all the material came from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic В lay- ers or Layer 2a of the Wadi Rabah culture (110). One obsidian item (bucket number 2687), which was related to Pre-Pottery Neolithic В layers (111), was unearthed at Munhata. It was found in Pit 796, which contained classical Yarmukian pottery (112), and is therefore a Yarmukian item. In the new ex- cavations at Sha'ar Hagolan one obsidian item was unearthed.

Sha'ar Hagolan and Byblos Various suggestions have been put forward con- cerning the chronological relationship between the three Neolithic layers of Byblos (113) and the Yar- mukian culture : a. The Yarmukian corresponds to the "néolithique ancien" of Byblos (114); b. The Yarmukian corresponds to the "néolithique moyen" of Byblos (115); c. It has been suggested, without any supportive evidence, that the remains from early Byblos should be separated into "néolithique ancien" and "néolithique ancien final", with the Yarmukian culture corresponding only to the latter stage (116). After the nature of the pottery assemblages from Munhata Layers 2b and 2a was clarified it became clear that the basic correlation between Byblos and the southern Levant is as follows : the "néolithique ancien" corresponds to the Yarmukian culture, and the "néolithique moyen" to the Wadi Rabah culture (117). The similarities between "néolithique ancien" Byblos and the Yarmukian are apparent in various aspects of the material culture : pottery ty- pology and decoration (118), the flint industry (119) and the figurines (120). The basic difference be- tween the Yarmukian sites and Byblos is in the architectural features. At the Yarmukian sites many pits and some rounded or rectangular structures with beaten earth floors were found. At Byblos the Pre- Pottery Neolithic В tradition of rectangular houses and plaster floors was retained (121). We can suggest two explanations for this phenomenon : 1. This ar- chitectural style continued to be used on the Phoeni- cian coast till the end of the sixth millennium B.C., as is also evident from Tell Sukas (122) and Ras Shamra Vc (123). 2. Taking into account the "Byblos method of excavations", it would not be surprising if two different layers, Pre-Pottery Neolithic В and Yarmukian, had been combined into one. When Gar- stang excavated Jericho in the 1930s, his Layer IX showed a combination of rectangular structures with plaster floors together with the use of pottery (124). Only in Kenyon's excavations in the 1950s did it become apparent that the pottery came from pits dug (113) DUNAND, 1973. (114) STEKELIS, 1972; BAR-YOSEF, 1978; KIRKBRIDE, 1971 ; CONTENSON, 1983 : 67.

(124) GARSTANG et al., 1935, 1936. 129</page><page sequence="16">at a later stage into the plastered structures (125). It is possible that the same mistake was made at By- blos. Even if we consider the first possibility as more likely, the divergences between the "néolithique an- cien" at Byblos and the Yarmukian with regard to pottery and architecture should be understood as regional and not chronological. 2. The Yarmukian and Jericho IX (Pottery Neolithic A) Five different suggestions have been proposed over the years concerning the chronological relation- ship between Sha'ar Hagolan and Jericho. The as- semblages in question are Garstang's Layer IX, equivalent to Kenyon's Pottery Neolithic A, and Garstang's Layer VIII, equivalent to Kenyon's Pot- tery Neolithic В (126) : a. The Yarmukian culture pre-dates Jericho IX(127); b. The Yarmukian is parallel to Jericho IX(128); c. The Yarmukian post- dates Jericho IX and pre-dates Jericho VIII (129); d. The Yarmukian is parallel to Jericho VIII (130); e. The Yarmukian is parallel to both Jericho IX and Jericho VIII (131). Nowadays the question concerns not the specific relationship between the sites of Sha'ar Hagolan and Jericho, but the relationship between the Yarmukian culture and the Jericho IX culture (132). The Yarmukian has been discussed here in some detail. The Jericho IX culture is now known from additional sites : Teluliyot Batashi Layer IV (133), Lydda (134), Dhra' (135), and Khir- bet ed-Dharih (136). As no radiometric datings are available for the Jericho IX culture sites, the chrono- logical relationship between this culture and the Yar- mukian cannot be determined on such a basis. Two other criteria will therefore have to be employed : typology and geographical distribution. Typologically, the basic vessels found in the Yarmukian culture are also found at the Jericho IX sites (Table 6). The only divergence between the two pottery assemblages is found in the style of decora- tion : incised frame and herring-bone pattern in the Yarmukian assemblage and painted lines and burnish (125) KENYON, 1957. (126) GARSTANG et al., 1935, 1936; KENYON, 1957, 1960. (127) AURENCHE, CAUVIN J., CAUVIN M.-Cl., COPE- LAND, HOURS and SANLAVILLE, 1981 : 572, (Table); KAFA- FI, 1987.

The assemblage of Ghrubba (137) can also be included in the Jericho IX culture, as it bears the same typological features (Table 6). The few Yarmukian decorated sherds found at Jericho IX sites (see supra : III) are another typological criterion indicating that the two assem- blages were contemporary. The flint assemblages of the Yarmukian culture and Jericho IX (Pottery Ne- olithic A) are also very similar. Crowfoot-Payne, who published the flint from Pottery Neolithic A Jericho, designated it "Yarmukian" (138). Geographically, it can be noted that Yarmukian sites are found mainly in the north and centre of Israel, while the Jericho IX culture sites are concen- trated in the southern parts of the country. The sites do not overlap geographically, except in the case of the Wadi Muraba'at Cave, where a few Yarmukian sherds were found. This site, however, is not a settlement, but a cave used for short periods, perhaps by herdsmen or hunters - people whose way of life naturally entails wandering and dispersion over greater distances. Therefore, in sum, the geographic dispersion of the sites indicates a tendency for each culture to concentrate in a given area. From the typological and geographical point of view one should, therefore, understand the Yar- mukian and Jericho IX as two contemporary cultures located in separate geographic regions. The hypothe- (137) MELLAART, 1956. (138) CROWFOOT-PAYNE, 1983. 130</page><page sequence="17">sis that we are dealing with an early and a late culture would create a strange situation : during the Jericho IX period all the northern part of the country would be empty, whereas during the Yarmukian pe- riod the south of the country would not be settled. We therefore conclude, on the strength of typological and geographic considerations, that the differences between the Yarmukian and Jericho IX pottery as- semblages are regionally, not chronologically, sig- nificant. The sites of the southern Coastal Plain of Israel : Giv'at Haparsa (139) and Nizzanim (140), should be understood in this context. These include assem- blages of pottery and flint with characteristics sim- ilar to the Yarmukian/Jericho IX cultures. The differences in the forms of decoration are also re- gional and not chronological. Further to the south and to the east, in the Negev, Sinai and Trans-Jordan deserts, small camp sites have been found. They are characterized by a flint industry which includes small arrowheads and sometimes rounded architec- ture, but no pottery (141). These reflect another adaptation strategy based on the local arid condi- tions. 3. Absolute Chronology To date, very few radiometric dates from Yar- mukian sites have been published. They are pre- sented in Table 7, in uncalibrated B.C. dates. It seems that all the dates are reliable, and should be accepted. They indicate that the Yarmukian culture flourished in the second half of the sixth millennium B.C. (ca. 5600/5500 - 5100/5000 B.C.). As the end of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, according to radiometric dates, falls somewhere towards the end of the seventh millennium B.C., this leaves a gap between the end of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic В and the beginning of the Yarmukian (ca. 6100/6000 - 5600/5500 B.C.). Three suggestions to bridge the gap have been advanced : a. Kenyon (142) and Per- rot (143) have suggested a settlement gap; b. Stager suggests that the Yarmukian followed the Pre-Pottery Neolithic В with no gap at all between them (144); c. Following the new stratigraphie evidence from 'Ain Ghazal, the term Pre-Pottery Neolithic С has been introduced (145), which bridges the period from the end of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic В to the beginning of the Yarmukian.

XII. DISCUSSION The variety of new evidence accumulated in the last decade from new excavations and the analysis of material from earlier excavations has broadened our understanding of the Yarmukian culture. It seems that the Yarmukians lived in village sites in which rounded and rectangular residential structures were built. Large public structures were also constructed at these sites, as indicated by the corner of the massive building exposed at Sha'ar Hagolan. A large number of pits were dug around the structures by the inhabitants. These pits are an important com- ponent of Yarmukian sites, and in the early days of research gave a false impression that they were the only architectural element. The settlement pattern of the Yarmukian was one of open loosely-knit villages, very unlike to the dense aggregations at the Pre-Pot- tery Neolithic sites. The Yarmukians were the first to produce pottery in this part of the Levant. Their pottery vessels were varied in shape and size and could serve diferent aspects of daily domestic functions. A highly dis- tinctive decorative technique was used to adorn Yar- mukian vessels, which are clearly distinct from other contemporary cultural assemblages. In addition, flint, limestone and basalt items were extensively used in daily activities. The Yarmukian figurines are an impressive ar- tistic achievement of the sixth millennium B.C. The quality and quantity of these items at the sites of Sha'ar Hagolan and Munhata establish the central 131</page><page sequence="18">Jordan Valley as a major artistic Neolithic centre in the Levant. Unlike the situation in the seventh millennium, in which the entire Levant was characterized by the same Pre-Pottery Neolithic В tradition, in the sixth millennium the Levant was characterized by regional cultures. In this period we also observe a decline in the amount of obsidian and other raw material im- ported to the region. It appears to be a time of cultural segregation, when every region emphasized its own identity by means of a distinctive material culture. Within this context the Yarmukian is charac- terized by the distinctive style of "Sha'ar Hagolan decoration" on pottery, and its elaborate art objects. Acknowledgements This article is largely based on Chapter 3 of my Ph.D. thesis (Garfinkel 1992a). I wish to thank my supervisors Prof. A. Ben-Tor and Prof. N. Goren Inbar for their help. J. Perrot, the excavator of Munhata, allowed me to study and publish the pottery, the figurines and other baked clay objects from the site. I am indebted to him for this. The excavations at Sha'ar Hagolan and the analysis of the finds were made possible through grants from the Israel National Council for Research and Development, the Irene Sala CARE Archaeological Foundation, and the Philip and Muriel Berman Centre for Biblical Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
