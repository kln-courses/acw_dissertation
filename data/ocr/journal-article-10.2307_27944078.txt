Garral, Johns Hopkins University) Traditionally, Hume scholars have privileged the study of Hume's epistemology, so much so that upon extending their analyses to his critique of morality and religion, the leading concern has remained epistemological. More often than not, this bias has served to thin out Hume's philosophical corpus by omitting his non-epistemological works from consideration. The result has not only been a fragmenting of Hume's oeuvre, but a narrowing of our under standing of how his conception of morality intersects with his worries about the social effects of religious zeal and faction. In her new book, Religion and Faction in Hume 's Moral Philosophy, Jennifer Herdt attempts to rectify this imbalance by giving an account of Hume which "resists allowing the tail of epistemology to wag the dog of critical reflection about ethics, religion, and society" (xi). Indeed, Herdt sees Hume's epistemological worries as "not only secondary to" but "actually driven by" his concerns about religious zeal and faction (9). Although she does not directly defend this claim, Herdt goes on to interpret "Hume's project" (10) as an attempt to determine the sources of, and solution to, social and religious strife. Herdt therefore reads everything from the Treatise to the History with an eye to fleshing out Hume's secular "search for shared public vocabularies" (xii). At the center of Hume's project, Herdt tells us, is his development of a conception of sympathy that captures our ability to appreciate another's beliefs, motives, goals, and values. Herdt characterizes sympathy as an out growth of the modern natural-law tradition which challenged the medieval emphasis on the common good by highlighting the reality of different and dis connected individual concerns. Such a reality, however, threatened to under mine not only human cooperation,but also the idea of moral authority. After</page><page sequence="2">76_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ all, if individuals are primarily self-interested, then what sanctions the claims of morality? And fiirther, why should the distinctive, separate claims of others motivate one to act for their sake? The "solution" to these queries, Herdt contends, lay in the principle of sympathy, which offered "a way of bridging the gap [between persons] by connecting us with the 'interiors' of others" (29). However, initial subscribers to the notion of sympathy, including Latitudinarians, Shaftesbury and Mande ville, tended to regard sympathy as merely the instinctive and automatic communication of another's feelings. It was Hume's great innovation, ac cording to Herdt, to modify this naive conception of sympathy and reformulate it in a less passive, more intentional and more reflective vein. In addition to postulating the influence of general rules which shifted the focus "away from occurrent states of sympathetic sentiment and toward stable dispositions to sympathize" (45), Hume distinguished between "weak" and "strong" sympathy (T 385), a distinction inadequately appreciated by students of Hume until now. When sympathy is "weak" or "limited," explains Herdt, the grief or sorrow another suffers, rather than inciting pity, repulses me, for distracted by the uneasiness with which his pain affects me, I am un able to get beyond my own discomfort and concern myself with his plight. Moreover, "when we compare the sentiments of others to our own," Hume observes, we may even "feel a sentiment directly opposite to the original one, viz. a joy from the grief of others, and a grief from their joy" (T 381). By contrast, writes Herdt, "extensive" or strong sympathy enables appreciation "not only of the other person's passion or sentiment, but the other person as such" (47), giving me "a lively notion of all the circumstances ofthat person, whether past, present, or future" (T 386). In other words, by considering "the other person as a whole we come sympathetically to share not only his or her unpleasant emotion, but also in his or here desire for relief or betterment" (48). The upshot is that as long as we are able to secure a "stable self-esteem" not threatened by another's "well-being" (49), extensive sympathy enables indi viduals to bridge the gap which separates them, perhaps giving them reason to act for each other's sake. What remains to be seen, however, is whether such a solid sense of self can indeed be established?a question Herdt does not pursue far enough, though the success of Hume's account depends on it. Nevertheless, Herdt successfully shows how Hume's complex use of sympathy as a means of communicating and appreciating the feelings of others</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 20, No. 1, January 1999 77 goes some way towards bridging the gap between separate individuals with different interests and concerns. But as Herdt demonstrates, Hume's approach did not go unchallenged or unmodified. Indeed, most of Herdt's book is dedi cated to inventively fleshing out the various trials, applications, and adjust ments undergone by Hume's conception of sympathy. The first trial Herdt explores emerges in response to the lingering question regarding the origin and sanction of morality. Fearful that sympathy based accounts threatened to conflate moral and prudential evaluation, Francis Hutcheson expressed grave reservations about the central role Hume assigned to sympathy. To the theologically minded Hutcheson, sympathy (or "public sense") in moral matters is, as Herdt explains, at best a "secondary phenom enon], while benevolent impulses are basic and not derivative" (5 1). Thus benevolence?an original impulse, approved of by the 'moral sense' God implanted in us?was for Hutcheson the key to the origin and purity of dis interested, moral claims and motives. Hume, however, rejected the provi dentialist account upon which Hutcheson's moral sense rested. (Hume also could not accept, among other things, that "the regard to publick interest" is the original reason or motive for virtues such as justice and honesty [T 480].) Though Herdt does not emphasize the point, the reader must presume, in light of her opening remarks, that Hume does not object to Hutcheson's provi dentialism on primarily epistemologica! grounds. Rather, Hume demurs, as Herdt suggests (53), because he could account for Hutcheson's moral sense "by an extensive sympathy," one capable of stimulating reflexive approval not only of what we think virtuous, "but also [of] the sense of virtue: and not only that sense, but also the principles, from whence it is deriv'd" (T 619). The re sult was an explanation, indeed a naturalization, of morality. In so far as we exercise extensive sympathy, Hume would argue, we assume a more disinter ested stance, and assuage the problem of egoism without invoking an all embracing benevolent instinct backed by a moral sense put in place by supernatural forces. Moreover, in so far as the qualities sympathy approves of are those agreeable or useful to ourselves or to others, sympathy, Hume would assert, can be said to be not only our "chief source of moral distinctions" (T 618), but that which bridges the gap between morality's dictates and human flourishing. Hume's principle of sympathy, then, effectively makes Hutch eson's reliance on a providential deity unnecessary, while it enhances our</page><page sequence="4">78_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ ability not only to feel each other's emotions, but to share, if only imagi natively, each other's interests (64). Having effectively trained the challenges Hume posed to Hutcheson, and explained why the latter felt so threatened, Herdt goes on to show that even if the explanatory power of Hume's account proved theologically devas tating, Scottish Evangelicals were not dissuaded from challenging it on the grounds that its foundation in sympathy encouraged an unseemly sensitivity to earthly pains and pleasures. Herdt creatively situates Hume's response to such opposition within the context of the contemporary debate about the pleasures of tragic drama?specifically, the "Douglas" controversy. Focusing on Hume's little-discussed essay, "Of Tragedy," Herdt teases out the way Hume's conception of extensive sympathy works to resolve three issues raised by John Home's play, "Douglas": the psychological problem, or why we are not repulsed by, but rather attracted to the emotions aroused by tragic drama; the fiction problem, or how we (?scriminate between real and fictive suffering; and the moral problem, or can a virtuous audience justify feeling pleasure at the sight of an actor's pain. At least the first and third of these dilemmas, argues Herdt, can be tempered, if not resolved, by employing Hume's dis tinction between limited and extensive sympathy. The second also benefits from the distinction, though it requires criteria for distinguishing fiction from reality, criteria established according to Hume's "holistic understanding of belief, in which beliefs are neither certified by a special feeling attached to them,. . . nor justified exhaustively by deduction or induction. Rather, our beliefs form an interdependent web" (108). The details of the account need not detain us. What is worth noting is how Herdt's case study serves to bolster her initial contention that Hume's epistemological concerns stand subservient to his moral ones, for the distinction regarding fiction and reality follows here on the heels of a real life moral debate. Indeed, throughout Hume's works Herdt finds various attempts to make sense of the parameters and possibilities of moral judgment and debate. As Herdt vigilantly reminds us, whereas in the Treatise Hume implied that moral disagreements would inevitably dissipate in light of the overriding "uni formity in the general sentiments of mankind" ( 547n), the Hume who penned "Of a Standard of Taste," comes to see such uniformity as utterly elusive, due to a "diversity in the internal frame ... [or] external situation" (MPL 243,227). But how, then, can we judge others with whom we disagree</page><page sequence="5">_Vol 20, No. 1, January 1999_79 about ends or goods? What is in order, asserts Herdt, is a "normative" account of what it is to make moral judgments about ends, an account Hume implicitly proffers in his attempt "to characterize the nature of good judgement" (121). Good judgment about the ends of others with whom we disagree, Herdt observes, prevails only when we are disposed to consider an unprejudiced "thick description" of their beliefs, desires, and ideals (120). And, as we learn, the principle of sympathy, once more, plays the decisive role here. But the question remains: just how far can our "sympathetic understanding" of others go? And further, how are we to become disposed to describe thickly? Though Herdt shies away from the latter query, she seizes on the former, submitting that for Hume, unless we share with those we judge a "peculiar similarity in our manners, or character, or country, or language" (T 318), our moral judgment of others as "morally flawed precedes and precludes the act of sympathetic understanding" (134). On the other hand, writes Herdt, the Hume of "A Dialogue" not only suggests that the universal criteria of "useful" and "agreeable" can be used to judge those who are moral aliens to us (E 336), but that a foreign point of view often helps curtail moral myopia (139,162). To resolve the tension, Herdt tries to distill an acceptable Humean response: we should not aspire to a view from nowhere, she warns, for when we judge we can sympathetically make sense of the actions and moral beliefs of others only by first reflecting on what we do and do not value, for "learning from alien points of view requires ... that we not lose our own moral bearing" (142). Thus, not quite paradoxically, to understand others sympathetically, we must ourselves remain morally moored. Nevertheless, charges Hume, devotees of "artificial lives and man ners" fail to anchor themselves morally "within" this world, and thus implicitly constrict the extent to which sympathetic understanding can be exercised. As Herdt explains, Hume's complaint is that, having submitted to "speculative systems" which disregard the common links between our moral attitudes and human flourishing, practitioners of artificial manners aspire to derive morality from "without" (164). In so doing, they not only disregard the this-worldly "maxims of common reason," they also exercise poor judgment as a result of the prejudice inspired by "the illusions of religious superstition or philo sophical enthusiasm" (E 343). How then can Hume relate to such people, especially since the mental strain of such illusions forces them to "involve themselves in the greatest absurdities and contradictions" (NHR 54), such as</page><page sequence="6">80_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ regarding the deity as simultaneously omnipotent yet benevolent, infinite yet anthropomorphic? Indeed, Herdt skillfully reveals that, for Hume, there is a sense of being not once, but twice removed from such zealots. For not only do they em brace alien moral values riddled with contradictions; their commitments re quire of them a duplicity that makes sympathetic understanding virtually im possible. In a remarkably clever reading of the History, Herdt captures Hume's worry that a mind sustaining such contradictions winds up having to deceive itself in order to embrace the inconsistencies. Self-deception of this sort, Herdt points out, involves not only logical contradictions, but the inten tional acquisition of competing beliefs. Thus theists, she stresses, must active ly pursue ways "to believe theological propositions that they can never wholly accept" in the face of more common convictions about life (178). The result, in Hume's eyes, is not just an adherence to a distorted, alien morality, but what Herdt calls a "sincere hypocrisy," whereby the zealot is at once victim and perpetrator of the deception (198). As a consequence, such moral perversions prove impenetrable to common sense, and thus thwart the possibility of sympathetic understanding. What Herdt has offered us, then, is an enlightening characterization of not only Hume's conception of sympathetic understanding, but also its limits. Though the project might have benefited from a deeper analysis of the nature and origin of the solid sense of self required by Hume's "extensive sympathy," as well as why one might be inclined to develop and sustain a disposition to sympathetically understand in the first place, the endeavor nonetheless succeeds. Herdt's presentation is coherent, and her approach to Hume refreshing. Her thesis that Hume's reflections on religion originated not in epistemological concerns, but as the result of witnessing the social effects of religious zeal and faction, is welcome?while her study of how sympathetic understanding actively strives to make sense of another's motives and values, yet may be "complicated or blocked" by the kinds of irrationality brought on by zealotry of any sort (213), points to the limits Hume judged he could not extend in order to realize a universally shared moral vocabulary. In all, despite the presence of some unfortunate typos [amongst others: 174: according to the edition used, NHR 139 does not exist; 54: "insturmental."], a rather high price, and some prolixity, Herdt's new book makes an important and original contribution to the ever-expanding corpus of Hume scholarship.</page></plain_text>
