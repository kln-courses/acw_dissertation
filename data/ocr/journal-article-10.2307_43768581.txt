Potnia to Zeus Cults of Deities Unspecified by Name by Albert Schachter Institute of Classical Studies University of London 1994</page><page sequence="2">PREFACE This volume completes the discussion of the cults of Boiotia in alphabetical order, which is followed by the presentation of data regarding cult activity where the identity of the deity is either difficult or impossible to retrieve. Volume Five, which, barring accident, should appear within the near future, will conclude the set, and will include an analysis of the cults of Boiotia, appendixes, addenda and corrigenda to Volumes One, Two, and Four, and indexes to Volumes One to Three. I am indebted to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for their continued generosity in support of this project, to McGill University for financial support, to the librarians and libraries of McGill University, the Ash- molean Museum, and the Institute of Classical Studies. Not least, I am indebted to my graduate assistant, Mirela Leibovici, for her invaluable work in the preparation of the text and the compilation of indexes. Unfortunately, I am no longer able to thank personally David Lewis, Paul Roesch, and Reynold Higgins. The value of their support is all the more obvious to me now that they are no longer available for me to turn to. The present volume uses material known to me up to July 1994.

Chadwick, The Thebes Tablets II = Minos Supplement 4 (Salamanca 1975) 102 (Of 36) The Theban Linear B tablet Of 36 is transliterated thus: 1. no-ri-wo-ki-de ku LANA 1 a-ke-ti-ra2, wa-na-ka [ 2. po-ti-ni-ja, wo-ko-de, a-ke-ti-ra2 ku LANA1. J. Chadwick translates the first two words of line 1 "to the house (temple) of Potnia", and suggests that this "may well have been at the place just south of Thebes known in classical times as Uorpim (i.e. Demeter and Kore)"2. Almost everybody takes the Theban po-ti-ni-ja, that is, Potnia, to refer to a god- dess, although A. M. Jasink Ticchioni has revived an hypothesis of J. Puhvel, that Potnia, like Wanax, is human, not divine, and refers to the queen, as Wanax does to the king3. Given the uncertainty which still dogs so much of our knowledge of Mycenaean society, it might be prudent to suspend judgement on the nature of the Theban Potnia. If the word does refer to a goddess, then the logical successor to the Mycenaean god- dess would be Demeter, who, as Thesmophoros, had her sanctuary on the Kadmeia4 and was the poliouchos of Thebes. In that case, the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Potniai would have been the one referred to in Of 36. In Hellenic times, Potniai housed the extra-mural sanctuary of the Theban Demeter and Kore, but its rôle seems to have been restricted to the performance of specific parts of the agricultural rituals 1 J. Chadwick, in Th. G. Spyropoulos and J. Chadwick, The Thebes Tablets II = Minos Supplement 4 (Salamanca 1975) 102. Further bibliography in P. Carlier, La royauté en Grèce avant Alexandre (Strasbourg 1984) 66-68. 2 As cited in note 1, pages 106 (translation) and 89 (reference to Potniai). See Volume 1.159 note 4. 3 SMEA 21 = Incunabula Graeca 72 (Rome 1980) 202-220. "Woikos" would then be, not a temple, but the palace. L. R. Palmer, Gnomon 48 (1976) 443-444, with reference to Of 36, argued "that woikos is not a 'shrine', but an industrial unit of a divine establishment". See also Nestor 6 (February 1979) 1338. Compare also J. T. Hooker, Kadmos 18 (1979) 111 ("The Fr tablets make it seem probable that the counterpart of the wa-na-ka is po-ti-ni-ja' and in this context [not necessarily in others] she, like him, is more likely to have been human than divine"). S. Hiller in R. Hägg and N. Marinatos, edd., Sanctuaries and Cults in the Aegean Bronze Age (Stockholm 1981) 99-100 (on the difficulty of interpretation). 4 I attach little weight to Pausanias's statement that Demeter' s sanctuary had once been the house of Kadmos and his descendants (9.16.5). This may mean little more than that there were ruins in the neighbourhood (there were certainly plenty of them on the Kadmeia in the second century A.D.). Aside from this, the sanctuary was obviously near if not next door to the sanctuary of Dionysos Kad- meios, which the Thebans - relying ultimately if not directly on Euripides - claimed to be in the ruins of the house of Kadmos (9.12.3-4). For a detailed study see M. Rocchi, SMEA 19 (1978) 63-67, esp. 65f. = Demeter (" PO-TI-NI-JA e Demeter Thesmophoros a Tebe"), and E. Peruzzi, Mycenaeans in Early Latium: Inc. Gr. 75 (Rome 1980) 119-120 (120 re Thebes Of 36) for a useful summary of the evidence for the Mycenaean god- dess Potnia. l</page><page sequence="4">POTNIA (THEBES) related to the Thesmophoria, while the focus of the cult shifted to the akropolis1 . The nature and functions of the Mycenaean goddess Potnia would not necessarily have been identical with those of Hellenic Demeter2. I do not know whether there is any connection between Potnia and the goddess of Hapha (Haphaia = Aphaia) who is referred to on one of the Linear B nodules from Thebes3. See Volume 1.166-168 and POTNIAI (POTNIAI). 1 On the location of sanctuaries of Demeter (and Kore) within the early Hellenic polis, see my article in Entretiens sur V antiquité classique 37: le sanctuaire grec (Geneva 1992) 44-45. The akropolis (Kadmeia) as focus of the cult of Demeter and Kore: Xenophon, Hellenika 5.2.29. See too THEILOUTHIA (UNSPECIFIED). ^ It would appear that no single Hellenic deity assumed the rôle of the Mycenaean Potnia, but that it depended on the religious and social preoccupations of whatever polis succeeded any particular Mycenaean centre. Thus, at Athens, one might expect the rôle of the local Potnia to have been sub- sumed by Athena, at Argos by Hera. On the identification in Mycenaean times of the Mycenaean Potnia, see J. Chadwick in A.M. Davies &amp; Y. Duhoux, edd., Linear Ķ: a 1984 survey = Bibliothèque des cahiers de V Institut de linguistique de Louvain ( BC1LL ) 25 (Louvain-La-Neuve 1985) 195, and J. C. van Leuwen, "Mycenaean goddesses called 'Potnia'", Kadmos 18 (1979) 114f. 5 C. Piteros, J-P Olivier, J. L. Melena, BCH 114 (1990) 153 (re 131 Wu94.0, a2-pa-a2-de). I discussed this in a paper entitled "Evidence for Cult and Continuity from Linear B Documents at Thebes", given at the II Congresso Internazionale di Micenologia, in Naples, October 1991. See also PTOIOS, HERO (AKRAIPHIA), and ADDENDA: HAPHAIA (THEBES). It may be of further interest that the collocation of sanctuaries of Demeter and Dionysos at Potniai - a small place, therefore with no great distance between them - corresponds to the proximity of the sanctuaries of the two deities on the Kadmeia. Dionysos, the divine child, might be regarded as stand- ing in the same relationship to Demeter as the infant associated with the mother goddess Haphaia (a possible forerunner of Ino).

I use Ch.

Symeonoglou, The Topography of Thebes from the Bronze Age to Modern Times (Prin- ceton 1985) 292 (compare p. 59) locates the sanctuary of Demeter at Potniai at his Site 201, which is just north of the point at which the road from Tachy joins the road from Plataia and Athens. A. D. Keramopoullos, who excavated the site - ADelt 3 (1917) 261-266 - had identified it as the sanctuary of Amphiaraos (see Volume 1 .22 note 2).

Their sanctuary was hard up against Mount Tilphossion (xpòç rą&gt; opsi rą&gt; TiXjxaaiq)). The most probable location of the sanctuary is the site excavated by Th. G. Spyropoulos at the chapel of Agios Joannis Prodromos, some four hundred metres west of the Petra spring (ancient Tilphossa)1. There, among other things, were dis- covered the foundations of what can best be identified as the enclosure of an open-air sanctuary. The site itself is at the western extreme of Haliartian territory, and may be taken to have been a limitary sanctuary, balanced by the Alalkomenion (the most likely location of which is about six hundred metres farther to the west), which marked the eastern limits of the territory of Koroneia2. On my interpretation of the data, the Praxidikai were the last inhabitants of a sanctuary whose first identifiable incumbent was the goddess of the spring Tilphossa3. According to Dionysios of Chalkis, the name "Praxidikai" was given to three daughters of Ogygos: Alkomenia, Thelxineia (or Thelxinoia), and Aulis4. Three of these names take us directly to Boiotia, and two - Ogygos and Alkomenia - to the immediate neighbourhood of the Haliartia5, so that it would appear that Dionysios was writing about the same goddesses as those whose sanctuary Pausanias describes. That they were three in number suggests that they may originally have been another example of the trinity of goddesses, traces of whom appear elsewhere in Boiotia, and especially in the western part6. Of their names, two recall epithets of goddesses as 1 See my article, "Tilphossa: The Site and its Cults", CEA 24 (1990) 333-340. 2 Pausanias 9.33.5: 'AKaXxofieml òè kú^t) ¡iév èan ov fieyákq, neira i òè õpovç ovk ay av úi/t;XoD xpòç rotę èaxároiç. àxorepío òè rfjç Kcófiiję ¿tstomjto èv tôj xBotfuxM# ri )ç 'AOijrôç vaóç, and compare Strabo 9.2.27 (411) and 9.2.36 (413).

Chr.: Kopais 2 - Wasserbau und Siedlungsbedingungen im Altertum (Munich 1987) 42-68, and Teiresias. Appendix: Boeotica 17 (1987) A/B.4. It differs from the location proposed by S. Lauffer, Kopais 1 (Frankfurt am Main, Bern, New York 1986) 98-101. My wife and I visited J. Knauss 's site in September, 1992; there were what appeared to be worked blocks in the appropriate area.

The third, Thelxineia or Thelxinoia, recalls one or more epithets of Hera1, another god- dess particularly well known in Boiotian cult. It may be, therefore, that she was known by this or a similar epithet in Boiotia, although evidence is not yet forthcom- ing. Hera, it may be recalled, had some connection with the neighbourhood of Alalkomenai, for it was here that the oak trees were cut for the Plataian Daidala2. Praxidikai are worshipped in various places, the nearest known to Haliartos being Gonnoi in Thessaly3, but one can only speculate about how the name came to be given to the Haliartian group4. 1 Athens: Hesychios sv OeX^ma' "H pa rt/xârat irctpà yA$rji&gt;aíoiç.

Helly, Gonnoi 2 (Amsterdam 1973) 204.204, a dedication of the second or first century B.C., with references to other cults of Praxidikai. On the Boiotian Praxidikai, see P.

Vernant, La mort dans les yeux (Paris 1985) 65-73, esp. 68-70, who groups them under "Les déesses- têtes"; but we do not know what these Praxidikai looked like. 4 Perhaps as follows: Panyassis of Halikarnassos, writing about the history of Lykia, described the consort of Tremiles as dvyarpa | vvfi&lt;f&gt;r)i&gt; ùyvyirjv, rjp Ilpa^tòíicrjv icaXeovaiv. Fr. 18 Ki/Davies, 23 Bernabé. The words dvyarpa vòyi&lt;1&gt;r]v œyvyirjv have been taken in various ways: 1) She is daughter of Tremiles, or of some other, whose name is lost: V. J. Matthews, Panyassis of Halikarnassos . Mnemosyne Supplement 33 (Leiden 1974) 102-103. 2) She is a daughter of Ogygos of Lykia (compare Stephanos Byzantios sv *íiyvyía): G. L. Huxley, Greek Epic Poetry (Cambridge, Mass. 1969) 101-102; GRBS 5 (1964) 29-33; compare Matthews, p. 103. 3) She is a goddess of the underworld, behind whom lie the Erinyes: H. Ehrlich, RhMus 63 (1908) 636-639. Compare B. C. Dietrich, Death , Fate and the Gods (London 1965) 102-104, who brings the Praxidikai into contact with Erinyes and Demeter Erinys in particular (see Volume 2.222-224). It is possible that Dionysios of Chalkis, having taken ùyvyirjp to mean "daughter of Ogygos", identified her with Alalkomeneia daughter of the Boiotian Ogygos, and thus turned Alalkomeneia and her sisters into Praxidikai.

The transcription in the original edi- tion - by A. Rangabé1 - suggests that the letters of the first line were larger than those of the others, while Lolling' s transcription in IG does not differentiate, except by spacing of the letters. Both editors agree that lines two and three are a series of names and patronymics. Rangabé transcribed line 1 IETIIPASITEAIE, taking ET for e&lt;j&gt; or eoi, and npa^ireXiç as a woman's name (otherwise unattested to date). Lolling read the first line as ETIIPAEITEAI, which Dittenberger took to be a dedication to a god or hero with the epithet Praxiteles (comparable to Teleios and Telesphoros)2. He also restored the names in lines two and three as those of three polemarchs. Neither interpretation inspires confidence. * * # PRIAPOS (THEBES?)

Lykophron, Alexandra 22 Stephanos of Byzantium sv 'Aucpai&lt;ļ&gt;ia Location and Site The sanctuary of the Hero Ptoios is about two kilometres east of the akropolis of Akraiphia. It is oń two levels at the north-east corner of the hill Kastraki ( Kriaria ), and looks across a valley eastward to Perdikovrysi, site of the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoios, not quite 1.5 kilometres away. The lower level is in the northern part of the sanctuary; the upper level lies some fourteen metres higher, to the south. The alignment of both levels is roughly east- west. The north-east section of the lower level is an open area, an esplanade, at the northeast corner of which are two altars, one over the other, a round one beneath a trapezoidal one. A curved retaining wall shores up the outer, that is, the north- eastern, edge of the esplanade. Some ten metres south-west of the altars are the foun- dations of two buildings which between them enclose the esplanade on its western side. The building nearer the altars is aligned roughly east-west, with a south-north deviation, and measures about five by three metres (earlier phase) and seven by four (later phase). The earlier building opened east, on to the esplanade, but opposite a point some five to six metres .south of the altars. The later building, which is some- what differently aligned, seems to have opened to the south at its eastern end. Adjoin- ing the south-west corner of this building - labelled the "herôon", but more of this later - is the north-east corner of the short, northern, wall of a longish building - about fifteen by five metres - which leads south. Some five metres in front of its east wall is a row of column bases, presumably of a stoa. This is the building labelled "A". At its southern end, building "A" abuts on the northern alignment of an avenue of monumental tripod bases, which lead both east from the direction of the town, and south in the direction of the upper level. About 150 metres west of the south end of building "A" is a construction ~ "Bâtiment ouest" - consisting of two parallel walls, some seven metres long and four to five metres apart, more or less in the same align- ment as the avenue of tripod bases. On the upper terrace, beyond a retaining wall, are the foundations of a temple, with a single row of columns down the middle. The temple's dimensions are about twenty-two by five metres, and it opens south-east to an altar some three metres distant. 1 All genealogies, none to do with the cult. 12</page><page sequence="15">PTOIOS, HERO (AKRAIPHIA) Finds and Chronology The earliest piece of evidence comes in the form of two sherds of a miniature skyphos of the Late Proto-Corinthian period, 650/630 B.C., found in the deposit of the round altar on the lower level of the sanctuary. The next is a piece of Middle Corinthian pottery, 595/590-570 B.C., from the "herôon" on the lower level. Pottery associated with the circular retaining wall on that level seems to date it to the middle of the sixth century B.C. Terracotta figurines from both the lower and upper levels (near the altar) begin to appear around the middle or third quarter of the sixth century, and continue until late in the fifth or early in the fourth. A number of stone columns attributed to the monumental tripods are inscribed: the earliest of the inscrip- tions is dated tentatively about 525-500 B.C., the whole series descending to the sec- ond quarter of the fifth century. Some material from earlier tripod bases and columns was re-used in the substructure of later ones, and in the rebuilding of the "herôon" and building "A". The tripods themselves, which were presumably of bronze, have disappeared. Architectural terracotta fragments from both the upper and lower levels are dated to the sixth century. It is not possible to be more precise: Claude Rolley dates the earliest 580/570, but this depends entirely on the Middle Corinthian pottery found at the "herôon", so that the argument is circular. Also datable to the sixth century is the upper rim of a large pithos, some 35 centimetres in diameter. It would have been used for collecting and storing water: the site seems to be without any natu- ral source of water. The pithos rim bears an inscription dedicating it to the Hero Ptoios. From the turn of the sixth to the fifth century comes a circular base, also with a dedication to the Hero Ptoios. All of the inscriptions mentioned so far - tripod columns, pithos, base - are, or can be restored as, dedications by the polis of Akraiphia. Two further official group dedications are known from the sixth century: one is on a fragment of a bronze sword blade, perhaps from Kastraki, dated to the end of the sixth or beginning of the fifth century, and reading -evi eç, perhaps the end of an ethnikon, for example, ['Epxo/*]eweç (although this would be a hapax : another possibility is Thebagenies). The other inscription is a dedication by the Boiotoi found at Kastraki, but not to my knowledge published1. 1 Late Protocorinthian sherds: P.

These include representations of charioteers and horsemen, and miniature wheels. There are many Boiotian black-glaze drinking vessels, mostly kantharoi, from the lower level: these range in date from the first or second quarter of the fifth to early in the fourth century. Many are reported to be inscribed with dedications to the Hero Ptoios. The two graffiti which have been published record dedications by individuals, not groups. Fragments of a large marble statue, which may belong to the middle of the fifth century at the earliest, were found on the upper level. The existing temple on the upper level is said to belong to the late fourth century, and is held to be contemporary with part of the walling of the akropolis of Akraiphia, which Y. Garlan attributed to the end of the classical or early in the hellenistic period: but for this he used the date of the temple, so the argument is both circular and sub- jective. The so-called "bâtiment ouest", the west building, was also erected in the fourth century B.C., to judge from associated pottery, and there are traces of rebuild- ing of the "herôon" and building "A", perhaps in the fourth century as well. A base bearing a statue dedicated to the Hero by Akraiphia, and created by Menestratos of Athens, is also attributed to the fourth century, usually to late in the century1.

Vases/kantharoi: BCH 88 (1964) 859 (about 30, almost all kantharoi, from the middle of the sixth century B.C. to the middle of the fifth, one of the fourth century from the west building). This is picked up by A. Mallwitz, Das Kabirenheiligtum bei Theben 6 (Berlin 1980) 161 and note 402, and reported as numerous kantharoi from the mid-sixth century on. However, a comparison of the kantharoi illustrated in BCH 88 (1964) with the classification elaborated by U. Heimberg in Das Kabirenheiligtum bei Theben 3 (Berlin 1982) gives the following results {BCH dates in brackets): BCH 88 (1964) 862 fig. 18 = KH 3 Form 4, mid-fifth century (ca. 550 B.C.); 863 figg. 19 and 20 = KH 3 Form 1, first to fourth quarter, fifth century (19: ca. 500 or later; 20: second quarter, fifth century). The karchesion shown in BCH 89 (1965) 917 fig. 19 appears to be from somewhere between the second half of the fifth and early in the fourth centuries B.C.

How long this lasted is uncertain. The Literary Traditions Ptoios appears in two legendary genealogies: in one he is a son of Athamas and Themisto, daughter of Hypseus; in the other he is the son of Apollo by a daughter of Athamas. Athamas may be said to represent the interests of Minyan Orchomenos: the abortive sacrifice of Phrixos and Helle links him with Mount Laphystion at the south- west edge of the Kopais, while he is also the eponym of the Athamantine Plain in its north-east corner. Pausanias relates a tradition according to which the Plain was so- called because Athamas lived there: perhaps, in fact, this story developed out of the Mycenaean stronghold of Gla. Athamas was unlucky in his marriages: the first, to Nephele, produced Phrixos and Helle, the next, to Ino-Leukothea, produced Learchos and Melikertes. His third wife, Themisto, bore him, according to one, probably Boiotian, tradition, four sons: Schoineus, Erythrios, Leukon, and Ptoios. Schoineus is mentioned in the Hesiodic Catalogue, but with no surviving reference to either parent's name. He is the eponym of Homeric Schoineïs, situated, it has been claimed, somewhere north or north-west of Thebes. Erythrios is the eponym of Erythrai, another town from the Homeric Catalogue of Ships, usually located south of Thebes, in the foothills of Mount Kithairon. Ptoios is the eponym of the mountain (which is not quite the same thing as being eponym of a town). Leukon can be traced back as far as the Hesiodic Catalogue , but his mother's name does not survive in that source. He is said, by Stephanos of Byzantion, to be the eponym of Leukonis, another name for the Kopais: in fact, his name would seem to be more appropriate for a son of Ino- Leukothea than for one of Themisto. According to the Hesiodic Catalogue, Leukon had three daughters, one of whom, Euippe - in the Orchomenian tradition related by Pausanias - married Andreus, thus passing on the throne (matrilineally, it may be observed) from one set of kings to another. The inclusion of the eponym of Erythrai in this quartet suggests that the group may have been put together to support a claim to ownership of the territory running from the north-east corner of the Kopais down to Mount Kithairon: the obvious beneficiary here would be Thebes. This genealogy appears in its full form in Herodoros and pseudo- Apollodoros, while Asios of Samos is cited as giving that part of it which refers to Ptoios. Pseudo- Apollodoros adds the name of Hypseus father of Themisto. We simply do not know whether the Hesiodic Catalogue included Schoineus, Erythrios, and Ptoios with Leukon as sons of Athamas: this would place the genealogy, according to the best informed guess, somewhere in the sixth century, a period not unacquainted with 15</page><page sequence="18">PTOIOS, HERO (AKRAIPHIA) Theban expansionism1. The other tradition, which makes Ptoios a son of Apollo by Zeuxippe, daughter of Athamas, is attributed to Pindar. This has been interpreted as an assertion of a Theban claim to the Ptoion and its oracle. It could as easily - if not more so - be seen as Pindar's way of complimenting the Akraiphians by elevating their local hero to the rank of god's son, perhaps by way of compensation for having another party, Teneros, neither a Theban nor an Akraiphian, but a neighbour of both, act as the god's spokesman at the Ptoion2. What all this comes down to is that the literary traditions tell us nothing about the nature, background, or function of the hero. He has no history, he is just a name. And even this name is not his own: it simply means, "the hero of Mount Ptoion"3. The Deities of the Sanctuary It is clear from the inscriptions, on stone and on pottery, that the lower level at least of the sanctuary at Kastraki was devoted to the Hero Ptoios. This is supported by the discovery of small votives from the buildings and deposits on the lower level, which depict males in various kinds of strenuous activity. There are no inscriptions from the upper level, but the terracotta figurines found there - mostly near the altar - are exclusively female, and it is a reasonable assumption that the deity worshipped there was female too. Pierre Guillon suggested that this goddess was the kourotrophos of the Hero Ptoios. The mature aspect of the females represented by the votives would certainly support the view that she was a mother goddess, although it should be noted that no figurines have been reported depicting mother and child, or nurse and nursl- ing, which would have settled the matter. That the two levels of the sanctuary are connected and together form one single sanctuary is suggested not only by the chronology of the place but also by the fact that the processional way bordered by the tripods, after reaching the southwest comer of the lower esplanade, turned south and upwards in the direction of the upper level, thereby linking the two4. 1 Schoineus: Hesiod, fir. 71A.12 (?), 72, 73.1 (?), 75.12, 76.9. Leukon: Hesiod, fir. 70.9 (?) and 28. Eurípides, in his Ino , relates, or perhaps invents, another version of the marriage with Themisto: the scene is set in Thessaly, where Athamas has two sons by Ino, and twins by Themisto, who plays the rôle of wicked stepmother usually assigned to Ino. Themisto plots to kill Ino's children, but the latter switches them around, and it is Themisto' s two who are killed. Themisto then goes mad and kills herself; Athamas goes mad and kills Learchos, the elder of his two sons by Ino. Ino takes the other, Melikertes, leaps into the sea, and becomes the goddess Leukothea: the story in Hyginus, Fabulae 4 = Mette (1982) F529. It would also be helpful if we could be certain of the date of Asios: most of those who dare to date him put him into the sixth century, but C. M. Bowra, relying on internal evidence from the quoted fragments, has suggested a date in the last decades of the fifth century. This would still allow time for Antiochos of Syrakuse to quote from Asios' works, and indeed for Herodoros to do the same (See Volume 1 .58 note 6). 2 Teneros at the Ptoion: see Volume 1.78-79. 3 On the various attested versions of the name of the mountain, see S.

It is matched, to an unusual degree, by the disposi- tion of the sanctuary of Aphaia on Aigina. There, in the archaic period, the goddess was worshipped in a separate, elevated enclosure, tucked in below which was a build- ing complex now seen as being used by male worshippers of a hero of whom Aphaia was the kourotrophos. Even the open area at Kastraki, between the buildings border- ing the esplanade and the west building, is matched by what Ulrich Sinn calls the "Festwiese", on the lower level at Aigina. Terracotta votive statuettes, some going back to the Mycenaean period, depict a goddess and babe in arms, confirming Aphaia' s basic maternal function. In addition to the physical resemblance between the two sanctuaries is the recent discovery that a goddess Aphaia can be detected as having been worshipped at or near Thebes during the Bronze Age: clay nodules inscribed with Linear B characters, found at Thebes, reveal that shipments of animals were made from outlying parts of Mycenaean Theban territory. These include a ship- ment made to a place at or near Thebes called Hapha or Haphai. Others have sug- gested a connection between such a place and a goddess called after it, that is, Haphaia or Aphaia. She, as a kourotrophos, may have been the forerunner of the Theban Ino-Leukothea. I do not claim that either of these goddesses was the goddess at Kastraki, but only, first, that this type of cult had a long pedigree in Boiotia, and second, that appearances to the contrary, the more important of the two deities at Kastraki must have been the goddess of the upper level ~ she after all, had the temple - rather than the hero down below. Compare, by way of interest, the situation at the Theban Kabirion, a mystery sanctuary where the unnamed goddess at the centre of the cult was attended by the better known Kabiroi1. What we have, therefore, are two deities, both anonymous, but probably wor- shipped in the area for centuries before the people of Akraiphia built a sanctuary for them. It is to be noted that the sanctuary was in the x¿&gt;pa of the polis rather than within or near the urban centre. The deities, as Ptoios's name reminds us, belong to the mountain, not the city. This is fitting for descendants - direct or collateral - of a goddess worshipped on high prominent places. Cult Activities Some at least of the terracotta figurines found near the altar on the upper level must have been deposited as offerings, for they show traces of having been scorched, presumably by the flames of the sacrificial fire. This suggests at least two kinds of 1 Aphaia and her characteristics: U. Sinn, in R. Hägg, N. Marinalos, G. C. Nordquist, edd., Early Greek Cult Practice (Stockholm 1988) 149-159, esp. 154-158.

It is to be presumed that the temple housed a cult image, possibly a rather small one, as well as other votive objects, notably the terracotta figurines. It may be that the temple, with its central single row of pillars, like other early ones, for example that of Hera at Samos, served not only to house a cult image but also as a treasury for the storage of valuables and sanctuary property2. For a period of over half a century - beginning about 525 B.C. ~ the polis of Akraiphia dedicated a series of monumental tripods to the Hero. Traces of upwards of thirty bases remain in situ and nearby, and in some cases elements of earlier bases and columns were re-used in the erection of new tripods. The dedicatory inscriptions give no hint of the occasion for setting up a tripod. They are dated by the local archon, but all this means is that they were set up by the polis, which in turn confirms that the sanctuary and any activity conducted there were operated by that body. We do not know how many years elapsed between dedications. One would expect, with a hero cult, that the dedications would be annual, but we do not know how many tripods were dedicated or even if tripods were the only form of dedication made. The absence of a natural water supply (see below) would tend to suggest that the festivities occurred at fairly long intervals, between which the sanctuary would not have been frequented. The predominance of drinking vessels found at the deposits on the lower level - at the altars, south of the esplanade buildings, by the west building - suggests clearly that a common activity was drinking, and probably - for the altars were there for cooking - eating as well. This gives a clue to the nature of Building "A" and the "herôon". The former, fronted by a portico, would have provided not only space for some to eat and drink, but also shelter from which to watch what was happening on the esplanade. The portico opened directly on to this, the altar being some distance off to the side. What went on was - I assume - athletic competitions, to judge from the surviving small votive bronzes representing charioteers, horsemen, and wheels. The equestrian competitions must have been held elsewhere, perhaps down below in the valley, but boxing and wrestling and the like could have been conducted on the esplanade, watched by the magistrates of the town from the shelter of the portico, and by the rest of the population from the slope leading up to the temple. The space between Building "A" and the West Building could have been used for footraces and/or eating and drinking by the rest of the population. A similar distinction in facil- ities is postulated for the sanctuary of Aphaia, which, like Kastraki, seems to have been short of running water: there, a cistern was sunk on the upper level; at Kastraki, at least one large pithos was used, presumably for the same reason. The setting - 1 Scorching: B. Alroth, in R. Hägg, N. Marínalos, G. C. Nordquist, Early Greek Cult Practice (Stock- holm 1988) 202 wonders whether the scorch marks might "be an indication of their dedication on the altar itself". 2 Samos: see, for example, B.

I do not know what the so-called "herôon" was used for: like Building "A" it does not face the altars, and in its second phase it opened to the south rather than the east. It may have been part of the overall oIkol complex and been connected with banquets held there2. These activities seem to have gone on until late in the fifth or early in the fourth century B.C.: one thinks of the Spartan takeover at Thebes in 382 B.C. as a possible stopping point here, as at the Kabirion. There was a resumption of activity later in the fourth century, again as at the Kabirion, with the rebuilding of the temple, the dedica- tion of a statue of the Hero, the erection of the west building as a kind of open, free- standing, propylaion (as at Epidauros and Samothrace) and perhaps the rebuilding of Building "A" and the "herôon". There is no evidence for how long this period lasted, but it is possible that it continued at least into the latter decades of the third century B.C.3. Both Michel Feyel and Pierre Guillon suggested that the Ptoia of Apollo Ptoios began as an agon in honour of the hero. The stumbling block to this has always been the fact that what evidence there is for the hero's agon is of equestrian competitions (and indirectly of other athletic contests), while the Ptoia of Apollo were exclusively musical. However, there is one inscription which may provide the link, in that it refers to an agon for cavalrymen at the Ptoia. This is a decree by Haliartos in partial response to an invitation by Akraiphia. This inscription, the text of which was estab- lished by the late Paul Roesch, has been minutely studied by him and by Kent J. Rigsby. Both take it to refer to the Ptoia of Apollo. I think that a case could be made for this agon's being the property of the Hero, and the inscription's pre-dating its re- organization as a musical competition in honour of Apollo. See the Appendix4. Kastraki and Perdikovrysi: the two sanctuaries of Mount Ptoion Readers familiar with the literature of this cult may have wondered why I have delayed dealing with the relationship between the sanctuaries of the Hero Ptoios and his trophos at Kastraki and that of Apollo Ptoieus at Perdikovrysi. In part, the answer is that I have dealt with the matter more or less to my own satisfaction in Volume 1 Lack of natural water supply at Kastraki: P. Guillon, Les trépieds du Ptoion 2 (Paris 1943) 104 (he uses it as an indication that the site was chosen by the Akraiphians faute de mieux, on being ousted from Perdikovrysi).

However, the main reason is that I thought it was more important to concentrate directly on the cult and sanctuary at Kastraki, without the introduction of red herrings in the shape of real or imagined quarrels. The argument between Pierre Guillon and his opponents has almost completely obscured the facts and diverted attention from the cult itself. I have tried to redress this by ignoring the question altogether, and by concentrating on Kastraki as a sanctuary with an independent existence, not geared to the vagaries of any supposed competitor. The result has, I hope, been instructive, and not without use. Ptoios and his kourotrophos turn out, on my reading, to belong to a recognized type of cult which can be traced back into the Bronze Age, and which was, moreover, known within the same geographical area. The sanctuary itself flour- ished during those periods of prosperity and security which Akraiphia from time to time enjoyed, especially under Theban protection. Its prosperity depended upon access to farmland won from the Kopais and protected at least since the sixth century B.C. by an earthwork thrown up across the bay of Akraiphia. It was a small but rich town, which, in its palmy days, could easily afford the luxury of lavish public devo- tion to a local hero - monumental tripods were not cheap ~ as well as active partici- pation in the neighbouring oracular sanctuary of Apollo. I suspect that the town's interest in the Hero and his Trophos began - or was revived - when its own growing wealth stimulated it to do something ostentatious in full view of the world at large: what better place for this than across the valley from the sanctuary of Apollo? The sanctuary at Kastraki did not so much mark the limits of Akraiphian territory, as tell the world that it was there1. Appendix: the Haliartos Decree^ The re-organization of the Ptoia under the auspices of the Delphic amphiktyony, which set up a sacred truce beginning on the fifteenth of Hippodromios - approximately equivalent to the end of July - was conducted jointly by the Boiotian Koinon and the polis of Akraiphia. Acceptance decrees survive of Oropos (complete), Orchomenos, Lebadeia, and Haliartos (all fragmentary). This seems to have hap- pened early in the 220's, at about the same time as the re-organization of the Theban Agrionia - in honour of Dionysos Kadmeios - by the Theban polis, and the Technitai of Isthmia and Nemea, also with the blessing of Delphi. Paul Roesch associated the Haliartos decree with this re-organization; Kent Rigsby dissociates the two and places the Haliartos decree before the re-organization, between the 230's and 220's. On the whole, Rigsby's argument in this respect is convincing: it hinges really on there already being an 1 See Volume 1.56-58. P. Guillon's theory: Les trépieds du Ptoion 2 (Paris 1943) 151-159.

It is not necessary to alter the text, but simply to accept that the drafter's intention was to distinguish the archon eponymous of the polis from a different group of archons, namely the thes- mophylakes. 20</page><page sequence="23">PTOIOS, HERO (AKRAIPHIA) acceptance decree for the re-organization from Haliartos, obviously passed in a different year. Paul Roesch's response to this is not convincing. The text of the Haliartos decree may be summarized as follows: Akraiphia has sent a delegation of three to invite (xapaicaXi ļiev) Haliartos to participate in a Oovoia in the temenos of Athena Itonia and Zeus Karaios, and to ask them (à |uu de) to send from the polis cavalrymen for the team competition in the agon of the Ptoia (è v tv Htuíow à[y]Cm). In response, Haliartos declares its decision to participate in the Sovai at and procure an ox for the purpose, employing the same procedure as for the Mouseia. The procession is to be conducted with the participation of the archon and the thesmophy lakes. Provi- sion is made to give the archos, the polemarchs, and the thesmophylakes choice portions of the animal sacrificed. Paul Roesch believed that the temenos of Athena and Zeus was at Haliartos, but I am convinced by Rigsby's contention that it must have been at Akraiphia. However I do not agree with Rigsby that the matter under discussion was an equestrian contest for Athena and Zeus conducted in their precinct dur- ing the Ptoia. There were actually two separate requests, one for participation in the sacrifice to Athena and Zeus, the other for the despatch of a team to compete at the Ptoia. This decree is a response to the first request. Another document will have dealt with the second. I think that the clue to the motive may be the rôle of the thesmophylakes. This magistracy existed at both the federal and the local levels in Boiotia. This inscription is one of only two referring to local ones. Presumably they had to do with the operation of matters of law. Why should Haliartos specifically send its thesmophylakes to Akraiphia to be present at the sacrifice to Athena and Zeus? Would it have been because there had been a dispute between the two poleis, which their legal magistrates had been able to settle, an event which was now being celebrated by a joint sacrifice at a temenos sacred to the national gods of the Boiotoi? Seen in this light, the concomitant invitation to participate in the Ptoia is a further gracious gesture of conciliation, wherein Haliartos is asked to join in a specifically Akraiphian festival. Since we can guess with reasonable security that there were equestrian competitions celebrated in honour of the hero Ptoios during the sixth and fifth centuries, there should be no great obstacle against assigning the equestrian Ptoia of the third quarter of the third century to the same deity. The subsequent re-organization of the Ptoia as a musical festival of Apollo would have marked only the next and per- haps final step in the history of the cult of the Hero, which would by then have been definitively abandoned. 21</page><page sequence="24">PYRES, SEVEN (THEBES) PYRES, SEVEN (THEBES) Site(s) Two hills, the Kastéllia { Mikró on the north, Mégalo on the south), east of the Kadmeia, and west of the Ismenos.

There was, therefore, a place at Thebes known in the fifth century as the "Seven Pyres", about which there were conflicting opinions4. We have to do, it would seem, not so much with a living cult, as with a landmark which it would be easy to identify as a mass burial mound. 1 The road might be much later, and belong to a time when the tombs had been re-discovered and turned into a local monument. 2 To the bibliography here, add AAA 4 (1971) 161-164. 3 He gives his reasons on p. 158 of the commentary to FGrH IIIB. 4 A note of controversy appears in ancient scholarship: Aristarchos accused Pindar of inventing the burial of the Seven at Thebes (an accusation levelled at Pindar and his contemporaries by T. K. Hub- bard, HStClassPhil 94 [1992] 97); Aristodemos, on the other hand, was equally certain that the grave of the Niobids was nowhere to be seen at Thebes (F3), and that the Seven Pyres were those of the men killed in the war (FIO: the text is corrupt here; the citation reads: ó be 'A/hcttóôtj/xóç &lt;¡&gt;y]Oí ràç ¿xrà xupàç tàxoXo/tewdPt.)- It is of no great importance whether either version was right or wrong. 22</page><page sequence="25">PYRES, SEVEN (THEBES) As it happens, both of the options proposed by the Theban contemporaries of Armenidas can be located in the area east of the Kadmeia. According to Pindar, the Seven against Thebes were cremated on seven pyres ò'sToxOaiai1. Euripides seems to locate the vlvthicltol of Amphion in this neighbourhood in the Sup- plices2, while in the Phoinissai it seems fairly clear that he places the tomb of the seven daughters of Niobe in the same general area3. The story of Amphion, Niobe, and their children seems to have been firmly fixed at Thebes from very early on, if not from its creation4, but there are no 1 Nemean 9.22. Both in this ode (1-24) and at Olympian 6.15, Pindar expressly identifies the site by name. The Athenians, of course, had their own tradition of where the Seven were buried. As early as Ais- chylos, Eleusinioiy the Argive chieftains were buried at Eleusis, the casualties of the lower ranks at Eleutherai ( TGrF 175-176). Others have pointed out the possibility that Euripides' s Supplices was motivated in part as a reaction against the Theban treatment of the Athenian dead after the Battle of Delion in 424 B.C. The principal argument against this is that the play repeats the plot of the Eleusinioiy and so could not have alluded to recent events. On the contrary, I should have thought that the theme of the Eleusinioi would have been too tempting for Euripides to ignore in the circum- stances. The matter is discussed by C. Collard, ed., Euripides Supplices 1 (Groningen 1975) 10. 2 663 (ěvepOe ociivûv ļimt] fiároop *Aļi&lt;ļ&gt;ioi&gt;og: unless this be taken as "beyond the solemn tombs of [the children of] Amphion", but I think this may be too complex). The speaker is the messenger, from a vantage point above the Elektran Gate. Euripides separates the tombs of Amphion and Zethos, apparently linking the former with those of his and Niobe' s children (see below). He may or may not have been aware of Pindar's statements, but he would hardly have referred to them, given the subject of his own play. Other sources locate the tomb of Amphion immediately to the north of the Kadmeia. The most important of these is Aischylos, Septem 526-528: tòv ôè Tcéfiirrov av Xéyœ TcéinrrauH irpoaraxOevra Boppaícaç TvXaiç Tvfißov KctTavròv Aioyevovç 'A/i^íowç. This is what that monument must have been called in the first half of the fifth century (and locally in the fourth century too: see Xenophon, Hellenika 5.4.8; Plutarch, De Genio Socratis 4 [577B]; Arrian 1.8.6). Euripides, however, called this one the ļivrjļia rov ZrjOov ( Phoinissai 145: this is where Parthenopaios was stationed, he who, in the Septem, was by the tomb of Amphion, so it would appear that both poets were writing about the same site). Pausanias 9.17.4 calls it the common tomb of Amphion and Zethos. This is the prehistoric burial mound excavated by Th. G. Spyropoulos: see his AM$EION (Sparta 1981). J Antigone has the attacking heroes identified for her by her paidagogos: first comes Hippomedon (120-126); next to him, by the waters of Dirke, is Tydeus (131-134); Then Parthenopaios, by the tomb of Zethos (145-150); then comes Polyneikes - èiceívoç èirrà -KctpOévuv rá&lt;f&gt;ov 7reXaç | Nió/fyç Aòpáarcú Tç'r)oíov -KctpctOTctrcï (159-160); then come Amphiaraos and Kapaneus. Such topographical indications as are offered suggest that the description by the paidagogos runs from west to north to east of the Kadmeia. 4 See A. Lesky, RE 17 (1937) ¿v "Niobe" (1) 644-706; W. S. Barrett, in R. S. Carden, ed., The Papyrus Fragments of Sophocles (Berlin and New York 1974) 224-226; E. Keuls, "Aeschylus' Niobe and Apulian Funerary Symbolism", ZPE 30 (1978) 41-68, esp. 64-67. Niobe, coming from Mt. Sipylos, where her story and monument were known from Homer on (Iliad 24.602-617), may represent another of the Eastern elements in the population of the region of Thebes who were brought together when the polis was formed. Of the two brothers Amphion and Zethos, who came from the Parasopia, the latter married Thebe herself, the former Niobe. See my comments in La Béotie antique (Paris 1985) 145-152, and Entretiens sur V antiquité classique 37: le sanctuaire grec (Geneva 1992) 26-30. A different, but also Boiotian, version of the story is told by Timagoras, FGrH 381 Fl {Schol. Euripides, Phoinissai 159, and compare Schol. T Homer, Iliad 24.602): the Niobids were ambushed by the Spartoi while on their way to Eleutherai èirl Ttárpiov Ovoíavy but Niobe was released because of her relationship to Pelops. This is conflated, not to say confused. 23</page><page sequence="26">PYRES, SEVEN (THEBES)/[PYRRHA (THEBES)] indications before Euripides as to where in Thebes the children were buried. Armenidas, ias we have seen, speaks of the confusion in people's minds, and of the possibility that Niobe' s seven children - or was it seven sons? - had been cremated there. This eventually results in Pausanias's description of monuments he was shown at Thebes. In the vicinity of the theatre just outside the Proitides gates, were the tombs of the children of Amphion, the boys and girls separate (9.16.7). Here he seems to be indicating the Kastéllia hills1 , and to be alluding to actual tombs. A little later he locates the pyre of the children, about one-half stade away from the tomb: apparently the ash of the pyre survived to his day, a detail which renders the identifi- cation slightly suspect (9.17.2). All the sources seem to be dealing with the same monuments, whether they associate them with the Seven against Thebes or the Niobids. Pottery found at the Kastéllia hills suggests that some at least of the tombs may have been used for cultic purposes during the archaic and later periods, but it does not seem to have been on a grand scale. There remains a further problem to consider. Armenidas is quoted as having written that the Seven Pyres were raised ¿xi roîç ëpneoiv. The noun has been vari- ously emended to 'Epfiaiaiv, spfiaoiv, Epfieœaiv, spfiáiç, II poiríoiv. Of these, epļiaoiv, in the sense of "cairns" or "barrows" seems the least unsatisfactory, but the usage is not certain2. One other possibility which would require a minimal change in the text is epneoiv, in the sense of "enclosures", which would not be inconceivable in the circumstances3. In general, what can be pieced together from the traditions which surrounded these mounds indicates the mixture of indifference and ignorance with which the Thebans treated the monuments of their real past4. * * * [PYRRHA (THEBES)] See [HENIOCHE AND PYRRHA (THEBES)]. 1 Possible site of Proitides gates, just opposite Megálo Kastélli: S.

Hubbard, HStClassPhil 94 (1992) 79-80 and 92-100. It is a good account (somewhat marred by ignorance of Armenidas), but reads rather more than I would by way of political motivation into the identification of the site as the pyre of the Argive dead (he suggests that it was Aischylos's Eleusinioi which led Pindar to take an interest in the issue). 24</page><page sequence="27">[RHADAMANTHYS (HALIARTIA)] [RHADAMANTHYS (HALIARTIA)] Plutarch, Lysandros 28 (449D) A tradition had developed by at least late in the fifth century B.C. that after her death, Alkmene was married to Rhadamanthys and lived on in the Isles of the Blest1. Either as a result of this, or parallel to it, another tradition arose according to which Thebes was identified as the Isles of the Blest (perhaps because of the sanctuary of Alkmene which seems to have existed there)2. Towards the end of the Spartan occupation of Thebes, a tomb was found at Haliartos, which was identified as the tomb of Alkmene. The Haliartans claimed not only Alkmene but also Rhadamanthys. Eventually, to give the tale a proper Homeric colour - or perhaps because by this time Haliartos had ceased to exist, that is, after 171 B.C. - the scene was shifted to Okaleia3. A complicated story, but no cult. See ALEAS/ALEOS (HALIARTOS), and ALKMENE (HALIARTOS/ OKALEIA) . 1 Pherekydes, FGrH 3F84 (Antoninus Liberālis 33); compare Plutarch, Romulus 28.7 (35E), who knew the story of the stone. 2 Armenidas, FGrH 378F5 (Photios/ Suidas y sv Ma/cápup vrjaoi). 3 Plutarch, De Gen . Socr. 5 (577E-578B); 7 (578F-579A) (the text of the first passage is problematic); Lysandros 28 (449D) (here the tomb of Aleos is identified as that of Rhadamanthys). Okaleia: pseudo- Apollodoros 2.4.11, and Schol. Lykophron, Alexandra 50 (see below). It is possible that the Haliartans had their own sanctuary of Herakles, which included a herôon of his mother in competition with the one at Thebes. Thebes also had a limitary sanctuary of Herakles (Hippodetes) in the Teneric Plain, just east of the Haliartia, beyond Onchestos. During the same period as the presumed discovery of the tombs of Alkmene and Rhadamanthys/ Aleos, Haliartos laid claim to Onchestos, as the coins show, so that a claim to Herakles and his entourage would not have been out of place. See POSEIDON (ONCHESTOS). Other elements of the life of Herakles set in the Haliartia: a) Alkmene married to Rhadamanthys at Okaleia (pseudo- Apollodoros 2.4.11, and see 3.1.2; Schol. Lykophron, Alexandra 50). b) Herakles educated by Rhadamanthys at Okaleia (Schol. Lykophron, Alexandra 50 [Rh. taught him archery]; Aristophanes of Boiotia, FGrH 379F8 [Schol. Theokritos 13.7-9b] [the story not local- ized, but Aristophanes wrote elsewhere about Tilphossa, and may have known the tradition: F4]). c) The horse Areion ( Thebaid fir. 8 Bernabé [Schol. Homer, Iliad 23.346 Dindorf and 347 Erbse]: the wonder horse Areion, born to Poseidon and Erinys Tilphossa, was given by Poseidon to Kopreus king of Haliartos. K. gave it to Herakles [who was visiting]; H. rode Areion in his struggle - or race - against Kyknos, and then gave the horse to Adrastos.

Aktaion, who was one of the founding (Archegetai) heroes of Plataia, was killed in the foothills of Kithairon, which was also the site of the birth of two other sons of Zeus, Amphion and Zethos, by Antíope.

This version of events, and an Orchomenian claim to suzerainty over the states bordering on the Kopais, may go back to the sixth century B.C. The Hesiodic Catalogue refers to the daughters of Leukon (fr. 70.9 and 28 M-W), Kopreus (1. 29, king of Haliartos, see RHADAMANTHYS [HALIARTOS]), Orchomenos (lines 30 and 35), (Argynnos) (1. 33), Andreus and Eteoklos (1. 34, compare fr. 71), Minyas (1. 35). On Orchomenian ambitions in the sixth century, see my article in H. Beister and J. Buckler, edd., Boiotika (Munich 1989) 73-86, esp. 80-82. We may note also that Pausanias 9.34.2 refers to a contemporary dedication of statues of Charités (that is, the chief goddesses of Orchomenos) at the sanctuary of Athena Itonia by Koroneia. Compare also IG 7.3426, tombstone of a woman from Chaironeia, who had been archpriestess for life of the Koinon of Boiotoi of Itonia Athena and of the Koinon of the Phokian ethnos, as well as of the Homonoia of the Hellenes chez Trophonios, and a high official in the cult of Isis. Territorial boundaries under the Empire differed from those in earlier times: compare METER (SOROS). It is possible, therefore, that the defunct oracle of Teiresias to which Plutarch refers was the one at Tilphossa. The so-called plague could have been the destruction in 171 B.C. of Haliartos, to which Tilphossa belonged. 37</page><page sequence="40">TEIRESIAS [THEBES]/(TILPHOSSA/HAUARTIA) [TEIRESIAS (THEBES)] There is no recorded cult1, although the ouůvooko-ksíov of Teiresias which Pausanias was shown2 could have had its origin in a real sanctuary, or a landmark3. * ♦ * TEIRESIAS (HLPHOSSA/HALIARTIA) Site T.

He seems here to be describing a statue by Kephisias, dedicated by Philetairos son of Eumenes of Pergamon, to which was added some centuries later an epigram by the poet Honestos2. This in itself is not evidence for a cult, but if P. Roesch's interpretation of an inscription of the first half of the fourth century B.C. is correct, then Thamyris was worshipped in the Vale of the Muses3. The inscription is on the body of a cylindrical base, of which both top and bottom are missing, therefore the name of the dedicand, if any, is unknown. It lists one man as iot[p'apxiopToq, two as OafivpiòòÓPTw, and nineteen as âyi opépuv. As P. Roesch pointed out, the presence of the hierarch means that the inscription is religious: he might have added that it also means that the docu- ment was an official one, or at least one sanctioned by the polis. He notes also that none of the names has a patronymic. He accepts it as evidence for a cult of Thamyris in the grove of the Muses, and derives ~ correctly - àytópepoi from ýyeioOm, inter- preting the title as being something akin to "guide, meneur, chef.

The name is found only in inscriptions and only in Boiotia: a supposed occurrence in Elis depends on a hazardous restoration of a scholion to Pindar, and is otherwise unsupported2. It is safe enough to assume that the month was named after a festival, and that the festival was one appropriate to the high summer. The problems are to identify the festival and explain the name. Two etymologies have been proposed for the name of the month, which appears in the following variants: QsikovOtoç , QslKlovOioç , QrfkovOioç* . P. Buttmann and August Boeckh derived the name from an original Qaikvoi oç, month of the festival of Thalysia4. This was disputed by H. L. Ahrens, who pointed out that in Boiotian ā does not become ¿r, and a does not become 0. Ahrens preferred an original *dss'ovOioç , derived from the advent of some deity5. There, so far as I can tell, the matter has rested. Ahrens's dismissal of Boeckh' s interpretation is sound.

The second syllable - Xov- could be explained on the analogy of òkóXovOoç and related words and ksXevOoç1. The retention in the Boiotian dialect of the common -ov- is not limited to Theilouthios, but is found also in the demonstrative pronoun ovroç, and the noun ßovg, as well as the month name, Boukatios, derived from it2. Ahrens's *QeeXov0ioç would be derived, as noted, from a festival connected with the advent of a deity. I would prefer to take it as a ritual which included the transfer from one place to another of a deity - that is, a cult image - probably in a procession3. There is another possible derivation, from Or¡X-, which would give us a ritual involving women. Plutarch, in his Roman Questions 57 (278D), in telling a local story, uses the words 6i)Xovi¡, drçXcó/ôrçXcoríç4, so that an original 0r¡Xo- for the first two syllables would be possible, and it might be possible also to derive the name from some word related to 9rj¡Xosíói'q. However, I can find no way to explain the -ov- and the second -0-5. On the whole, Ahrens's etymology ~ which would give a month name derived from a ritual involving the transfer of the image of a deity - is acceptable, although a name concerned with a ritual involving women is not impossible either. Whatever the name meant, the festival Theilouthia took place in the month immediately following the summer solstice. It is safe to assume, since the month name is not only found in every region of Boiotia - with attestations at Chaironeia, Orchomenos, Thespiai, Tanagra, and Oropos ~ but also in Boiotian federal decrees set up at Koroneia and at Delphi, that the ritual was also pan-Boiotian. We can be sure that there were local variations, but basically the rite would have been the same throughout the country. 1 P.

In the De Iside et Osiride 69 (378E), Plutarch notes that the Boiotoi celebrated a rite - sopriļ - during the month Damatrios, the Boiotian equivalent of Pyanepsion, month of the Thesmophoria at Athens. At this time, they disturbed the megara of Achaia - ret ríjç 'A xoiíaç fiéyapa kivovoív. This rite they called èiraxOy or èTaxOrjç, a name Plutarch derives from the epithet of the goddess, so-called because of the burden of sorrow she bore on being bereft of Kore. Although the epithet Achaia might very well refer to a sorrowing goddess, the name of the festival might refer to the weight of objects carried during it. The similarity of this rite with part of the Attic Thes- mophoria is clear enough. The rite described by Plutarch took place during the autumn, more or less at the time of the sowing of the principal grain crop. There was a secondary sowing during the late winter, but the main crop was sown in the autumn and harvested in the early summer1. The worship of Demeter Achaia, to whom this rite is attached by Plutarch, is directly attested - under that epithet ~ along the length of the Asopos basin from Thisbe and Thespiai in the west to Tanagra in the east, and, of course, to Eretria across the water. The ritual as described by Plutarch is, as I have just noted, reminis- cent of part of the activity at the Athenian Thesmophoria. The cults of Demeter in Boiotia show her as bearing a variety of epithets, but in practically every case she can be shown to be bi-form, either bearing two epithets - such as Megalartos and Megalomazos, at Skolos in the borderlands between Plataia and Thebes - or being joined in worship with Kore as Thesmophoros - at Koroneia and Thebes -, Eleusinia - at Thespiai and in the territory of Plataia -, and quite possibly as Achaia at Tanagra, for in the last there is an inscription which might permit the restoration of the epithet at a point where dittography has been suspected2. This leads to another rite of Demeter and Kore, which is described by Pausanias. It took place at Potniai, an outer suburb south of Thebes, probably the location of the woikos of the Theban Potnia referred to on a Linear B tablet from Mycenaean Thebes3. On the Kadmeia - the akropolis of Thebes - Demeter was wor- shipped with Kore as Thesmophoros. She was the poliouchos of the hellenic polis, a rôle she no doubt inherited from the Mycenaean period. Her sanctuary on the Kad- meia was next to the sekos of Semeie, the open-air centre of the cult of Dionysos Kadmeios, Dionysos of the Kadmeia.

What Pausanias describes went as follows1: At a specified time, they perform certain rites, which included releasing (ctfaãoip) some of the new-born piglets into the so- called megara. Subsequently, it is said, something concerning these piglets happens at Dodona. Unfortunately, the text is defective here, but the tale was outrageous enough to draw an expression of outright disbelief from Pausanias2. The gist seems to be that the piglets turned up again at Dodona3. There are of course other connections between Boiotia - especially Thebes - and Dodona4. There may have been a ritual journey to Dodona to collect the supposed remains of the animals for use in an agricultural magic ritual5. I used the word "subsequently" to paraphrase the Greek of Pausanias, who wrote that the event at Dodona occurred się rijv ¿xi ovoav tov stovç œpav. Some translators of the text take this to mean "at the next year"6, but it means rather "the following season of the year"7: this would give two parts to the rite, a first during which the piglets were released into the megara, and a second some months later, when they were - perhaps - "found" at Dodona. I equate the second half of the ritual as described by Pausanias with the ritual described by Plutarch, in which case we would have a rite in two acts, of which the second took place in the autumn, and the first in the preceding season, the summer. The summer ritual, I suggest, was the Theilouthia, conducted in the month named after it, and the autumn ritual, conducted during Damatrios, would have been called Damatila or Tà 'E raxOrj. 1 Pausanias 9.8.1. 2 9.8.1: XÓ70J TÛSe aXXoç irov tlç xeiaöwaerai, very strong words for Pausanias. 3 The text, immediately before Pausanias 's comment, reads èv Aojòwiqi &lt;1&gt;a&lt;JÌv ètri. That there was a lacuna here was obvious to the copyist of Parisinus Gr. 1399 (Pa). It has been tilled in a variety of ways, e.g. sTn&lt;f&gt;avrivm (K. O. Müller, rev. W.

The theatre had been rebuilt under Augustus, the sanctuary seems to have been visited by Hadrian, it was the site of an agon in the third century, was consulted by Julian in 362, and finally, in 391, the sacred oak tree was cut down: see S.

The scholion is a gloss on the Thesmophoria, which it identifies with the Skiraphoria1. The aition given is the rape of Kore: pigs tended by Eubouleus fell into the same hole through which Kore was taken underground. In honour of Eubouleus, pigs were thrown into the chasms -- or megara or adyta - of Demeter and Kore. The rotted remains were brought up by women called Antletriai and placed upon altars. When mixed with the seed-corn the remains were held to impart fertility. The scholiast also equates the ritual - that is, the Thesmophoria/Skiraphoria - with the Arrhetophoria, which was concerned with the fertility of both grain and men. Clement of Alexandria, in an abbreviated version which seems to have had access to a similar or parallel source, refers to the aition and to its influence on the celebration by women of Thesmophoria, Skirophoria, and Arrhetophoria2. At this point it may be germane to note that the Boiotian month Theilouthios was equivalent not only to the Děmatros at Halos in Phthiotis3, which suggests that we should be looking for a festival in honour of Demeter, but also with the Attic month Skirophorion, which takes its name from the Skira or Skiraphoria, a festival celebrated on the twelfth day of the month4, that is, soon after the summer solstice and not long after the summer harvest. It appears to have consisted of two parts, one public, the other restricted. The former included a procession from the Akropolis to a place called Skiron, just before the river Kephisos, along the sacred road from Athens to Eleusis5. According to Lysimachides, who wrote in the first century B.C. or A.D., the procession was organized by the Eteoboutadai6, and its main participants were the priestess of Athena, the priest of Poseidon, and the priest of Helios7. Near Skiron Pausanias saw a sanctuary of Demeter and Kore, where 1 A. C. Brumfield's objection to linking the Skira and the Thesmophoria is precisely the fact that in an underground chasm the carcasses of the piglets would disappear completely in the four intervening months: The Attic Festivals of Demeter and their Relation to the Agricultural Year (Salem 1987) 160- 161. But that is the whole point, as the ritual at Potniai makes clear: the piglets did disappear, which was why they could be said to have turned up again at Dodona a season later. We are not dealing with farming, but with sympathetic magic. L. Deubner, Attische Feste (Berlin 1932) 50-51, and H. W. Parke, Festivals of the Athenians (London 1977) 83-84, see no problem with having the whole of the ritual concluded within the period of the Thesmophoria. 2 Protreptikos 2.17.1: BovXet Kal rà $epe&lt;1&gt;ámiç àp$o'óyia óirjyr¡0a)1xaí col Kal tòv nákaOov Kal tt¡p apicayifv ttjp virò 'Alòwvéuç Kal rò x&amp;Oßct rfjç yrjç Kal ràç vç ràç Et ißovXeuq ràç ovyKaTairoOeíoaç ral v Oealv, òi rjp airíav èv roiç Qeoiio&lt;j&gt;opíoiç iLeyapíÇovrzç 'oípovç e1ißaXkovou&gt;; ravrqv tt)v ļiv6o'oyiav ai yvva íkcç ttolklXcúç icarà ttó'lv èopráÇovai , Qeafio&lt;1&gt;ópLa LKipoýópia * Appi]To&lt;f&gt;ópia , ttoXvtpóttcôç rtļv $epe&lt;l&gt;ámr)ç eicrpayiodovaai àpirayr'v.

The fifth century comic poet, Pherek- rates, refers to a temple of Athena Skiras at Skiron, whose epithet was derived by Philochoros from an Eleusinian mantis Skiros (originally from Dodona), while the historian Praxion derived it from Skiron2. The passage attributed to Lysimachides derives the word tò onipov from a large sunshade carried in the procession. Ancient literary sources were divided about the deities in whose honour the Skira was celebrated, assigning it either to Athena (and Poseidon), or to the hero Skiros, or to Demeter and Kore. Modern scholarship is also divided, but leans toward Demeter and Kore, not only because of the other main literary source for the Skira, but also because the epigraphical references to the Skira place it firmly in the context of the cult of Demeter3. Potniai was situated in the same relationship to the city of Thebes as Skiron was to Athens, that is, at the boundary between inhabited and cultivated lands. It is natural to suppose that there would have been a procession from the sanctuary of Demeter on the Kadmeia to Potniai, just as there was from Athens to Skiron. This would approach certainty if we could be sure that Ahrens' s etymology for Theilouthia is correct. So now we have at least the possibility of a two-act ritual, the first - called Skira at Athens, Theilouthia in Boiotia - possibly devoted to ensuring the survival of the seed com from after the harvesting of one crop until the sowing of the next, the second -- Thesmophoria at Athens, Epachthe/Damatria in Boiotia ~ aimed at least partly towards ensuring the success, by magical means, of the sowing of the next crop. There is, however, another Boiotian festival of Demeter and Kore, celebrated exclusively by women. This is the Thesmophoria of Thebes ~ and perhaps elsewhere -- conducted, not in Damatrios/Pyanepsion, that is, in the autumn, but mid-way between Theilouthios and Damatrios, in the Boiotian month Panamos (Attic Metageit- nion, Delphic Boukatios). We are told by Xenophon that when, in 382 B.C., the Spartan Phoibidas was leading a detachment of troops to join Teleutias, he encamped enroute at the Theban Herakleion. This is just south of the Kadmeia4. At the time, the Theban boule was in session in the agora - that would be east of and below the Kadmeia - because the Kadmeia was being used by the women who were celebrating the Thesmophoria. Leontiades, one of the leaders of the pro-Spartan faction at Thebes, suggested to Phoibidas that this would offer a good opportunity to seize the Kadmeia, which he did without difficulty, it being summertime and the streets being deserted5. Plutarch also reports that the Kadmeia was seized during the Thesmophoria, but gives no season for 1 1.37.2. 2 Pherekrates, fr. 265 PCG (231 Kock); Philochoros, FGrH 328F14-16 (and see Jacoby ad loc.); Praxion, FGrH 484F1.

Brumfield, cited above, 156-181, esp. 156-157, 162-165 (the inscriptions). 4 See Volume 2.22. 5 Xenophon, Hellenika 5.2.29. 48</page><page sequence="51">THEILOUTHIA (UNSPECIFIED) it1 . The orator Aristeides, however, fixes the season at the time of the Pythia, that is, some time during the period August/September2. There is no direct evidence that the Thesmophoria were celebrated at the same time of year elsewhere in Boiotia, but there is one sign that this was not unlikely. This comes in an inscription from Tanagra of late in the third century B.C., which deals with the consolidation of the cult of Demeter and Kore by bringing the sanctuary into the city itself from its former location in the rpoáarsiov. The new sanctuary was to be paid for by public subscription by the women of Tanagra, and there was a time limit of twenty days for the collection of the funds, in order that ~ as the document says - the work might be done as quickly as possible. Since the whole document - preamble, decision, decree, selection of a committee, and list of donors - is dated at the end of Theilouthios, it is not unreasonable to assume that the rush to complete construction was motivated by the need to have the sanctuary ready for an early festi- val, perhaps the Thesmophoria3. The Attic ritual that is nearest in the agricultural cycle to the Theban Thes- mophoria was the Pr(o)erosia, held during the late summer or early autumn4 and con- cerned with the preparation of the soil for the autumn ploughing. There is, therefore, a logical sequence of inter-connected agricultural rites attested for both Attika and Boiotia, whose purpose was to ensure, first, the preservation of the seed corn after the early summer harvest, second, the receptivity of the soil at the driest period of the year, third, the success of the sowing in the early autumn. This seems to be fairly straightforward, but it has interesting implications: the name Thesmophoria is given to two different rituals within the sequence at Athens and at Thebes, for the Theban rite can have had nothing to do with the autumn sowing, and the Athenian one nothing to do with preparation of the soil in the height of summer. However, this is not the place to discuss this particular problem, but I hope to do so elsewhere. 1 Pelopidas 5 (280C). 2 Aristeides 1 pg. 419 Dindorf 19 ( Eleusinios ) = 22.7 Keil): tovto yiev HvOicov ovtwv rj Kadļieia KaTe'rj&lt;l&gt;$rj.

The sanctuaries which Pausanias describes (9.20.4; 9.22.1-2) are those of Hermes, Dionysos, Themis, Aphrodite, and Apollo (shared with Artemis and Leto). The sanctuary of Hermes was near the theatre and a stoa (9.22.2), and we may allow ourselves to surmise that the sanctuary of Dionysos (9.20.4) was near the theatre too. Alongside the sanctuary of Dionysos (and therefore also near the theatre) were the temples of Themis, Aphrodite, and Apollo (9.22.1). The location of the theatre has been fixed, in the upper - south-west - corner of the site, just inside the line of the city walls1 . It is therefore reasonable to assume that all the other sanctuaries were in the same general area2. Hermes was the poliouchos of the polis, and in later antiquity at least he played the same rôle as that performed elsewhere by Herakles, namely the embodiment of the state's ephebes, in training to be warriors3. It is therefore easy to account for the presence of Hermes on the akropolis. Dionysos belongs by virtue of the presence of the theatre. As for the other three gods, each embodies a feature essential to the functioning of the polis: Apollo represents the governance of the state itself4, Aphrodite its magistrates5, and Themis the people gathered together, the àyopá 6. The grouping is therefore logical and balanced7. 1 D. W. Roller, BSA 82 (1987) 213-232, esp. 225-226, and see the town plans on pp. 222 and 223 (a longer version of this article is published in Boeotia Antiqua 1 [Amsterdam 19891 129-163). 2 See Roller 226-228. 3 See HERMES (TANAGRA). The local Herakleion may have been outside the city walls: as far as I can determine, the foundations from which the potsherds with dedications to Herakles come, were in a suburban context, near the tombs excavated by A. K. Andreiomenou, and grouped on either side of the ancient road, in the vicinity of the airfield: see Dr. Andreiomenou' s reports in La Béotie antique (Paris 1985) 113 and 119-120, and Magna Graecia 20.5-6 (1985) 1-2; see too SEG 35.411 bis, and D.

En tous cas, elle a pour fonction propre de réunir les dieux quand Zeus les convoque; elle agit de même chez des hommes"). ' H. Vos, 0EMIE (Assen 1956) 69 and 78, associates the worship of Themis in Boiotia with her cult in Thessaly (p. 68) as being the oldest and original manifestations. Ordinarily, I would find the use of late evidence (Pausanias at Tanagra and Thebes, a hellenistic inscription at Thespiai) to support an argument of this kind unacceptable. However, the grouping at Tanagra suggests that he may be right (although he was of course unaware of the political rôle played by Aphrodite: p. 78).

The sanctuary of Themis contained a cult image. The epithet of Zeus locates this in a sub- urban agora2. The possible existence of a theophoric name on a Theban inscription of the fifth century B.C. suggests that Themis might have been worshipped at Thebes at a much earlier date3. * * * THEMIS (THESPIAI) /G7.1816 A stone seen at Parapoungia, with a dedication (in dialect) to Themis by a for- mer priestess: 'A XsÇiç Ssvo^tKœ ' laps láÇaaa Osfim.

I presume that the sanctuary of Themis was in the vicinity of the agora, that is, if it was in the city and not in the countryside5. 1 By Zeus: Hesiod, Theogony 901-906. Themis's function as a guarantor of honourable behaviour (see the works cited in the next note) sug- gests that the Moirai here - who had no cult image - might be comparable to the Praxidikai of the Haliartia, qv. 2 See THEMIS (TANAGRA).

Since the deity whom Polykratides was serving as priest is not named, it might be justifiable to conclude that it was Titus Statilius Taurus2. A Tauros was the recipient of an enkomion at a celebration of the Mouseia held between 14-29 A.D. Other enkomia were offered on the same occasion to Julia Augusta (that is, Livia) as Mnemosyne, to the Muses, and to a Messallinus3. The Taurus honoured here could have been either the deified ancestor4 or one of his two sons. The presence of a Messallinus suggests that the latter is more likely, and of the two, the elder son, T. Statilius Taurus (cos. 11 A.D.), who was married to a sister or half-sister of M. Valerius Messallinus (cos. 3 B.C.) and M. Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messallinus (cos. 20 A.D.), children of M. Valerius Messalla Corvinus (cos. 39 B.C.)5. The inscription certainly post-dates August, 14 A.D. (but could have been as early as the late autumn of that year)6. The enkomia do not mean that Taurus, any more than Messallinus, was here regarded as a god. 1 BCH 26 (1902) 291 .1 . The correct reading - a third line with the words $eóiç -- is given by A.

He and his brother were friends of Ovid: see Teiresias Supplement 3 (Montreal 1990) 103-109.

This was probably in the period 6 B.C. to 2 A.D., during Tiberius's stay at Rhodes (see Bull . épigr. 59.184, p. 294). 6 That is, if the Messallinus was M. Valerius, since Cotta did not become Messallinus until after the former's death: Velleius Paterculus 2.112, and see R. Syme, History in Ovid (Oxford 1978) 114-134. Livia became Augusta by the terms of Augustus's will, that is, not before August or September (see, for example, G. Gerther, AJPhil 67 [1946] 233 and note 61). In the second century A.D., the Mouseia were celebrated in the month Damatrios (October/November) (SEG 3.334: see Volume 2.177), so that, if the date of celebration was the same in the first century A.D., then October or November of 14 A.D. would have been possible. 54</page><page sequence="57">THEOS TAUROS (THESPIAI) Appendix: The Tauri and Messall ini x Cornel lus Sisenna ! i Titus x Cornelia M Valerius Statil ius j Messalla Taurus ( I ) ļ Corvinus (37/26 B.C.) ļ (39 B.C.) - 0EOE TAYPOE ļ ¡ i i i i Sisenna Statilia Titus x (Valeria M Valerius M Aurelius Statilius Statil ius ļ Messallina) Messallinus Cotta Taurus Taurus (II)ļ (3B.C.)

Of the numerous sons of Herakles and the daughters of Thespios1, most were despatched with Iolaos to colonize Sardinia2, two or three went to Thebes3 and seven remained at Thespiai, where they were called òrjfiovxoL. The number seven, which occurs in the Thespian òthjlovxol , the Archegetai Heroes of Plataia - see HEROES ARCHEGETAI (PLATAIA) - and the seven champions of Thebes (who warded off the attacking "Seven against Thebes"4, may go back to the Bronze Age. The region occupied by the Hellenic poleis of Plataia and Thespiai were part of the realm of the wanax of Mycenaean Thebes. A division by sevens may have been a part of the administrative framework5.

Pseudo-Apollodoros 2.7.6 (of 50 sons, 40 went to Sardinia). Pausanias 7.2.2 (Iolaos to the Athenians and the Thespians to Sardinia: also 10.17.5, 1.29.5); 9.23.1 (they all died on Sardinia).

The Epigonoi of the sec- ond, successful expedition are, with the exception of Diomedes, colourless figures. The sequel is clumsily grafted on to the original to provide a counterweight to the siege of Troy. Ionic tradition demanded that Thebes should fall, but the Theban version was quite otherwise.

The two or three Thespiadai who went to Thebes may represent the rulers of Thespian KŪpai who transferred their allegiance ~ willy-nilly « from Thespiai to Thebes. A well-known example of this, often overlooked as such, are Amphion and Zethos, who moved from Eutresis - just inside Thespian territory - to Thebes2. This leaves the forty or so Thespiadai who accompanied Iolaos to Sardinia. This episode might be explained, as it has been by some, as resulting from the confusion of the name of Iolaos with an eponymous deity of a Sardinian tribe, the Iolei3. Others attach the supposed migration of Thespiadai to the period of colonization4. However, even a casual glance at the archaeological record on Sardinia reveals that there is not enough Greek ceramic material in Sardinia to justify claiming direct contact before the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.5. This evidence, as it happens, is of contact with Athens, which is interesting, for, according to Pausanias, Iolaos led a contingent made up not only of Thespians, but also of Athenians6. These Thespians supposedly led by Iolaos would then have been pro-Athenian and anti-Theban, and since there are relatively more of them than of those who stayed behind or switched their allegiance to Thebes, they may have been of the democratic rather than of the oligarchic persua- sion7. If we look for occasions in the fifth or fourth century B.C., when a group of Thespians on the wrong side might have sought refuge in Athens, we find that there are three: once during the Theban hegemony, and twice during the Peloponnesian War. The first has been dealt with by C. J. Tuplin, who concludes that between 373/372 and the summer of 371, Thespiai was destroyed and its population expelled 1 See above, page 25 note 3. 2 See Entretiens sur l'antiquité classique 37: Le sanctuaire grec (Geneva 1992) 26-30. 3 See J.

Balmuth, ed., Studies in Sardinian Archaeology 2 (Ann Arbor 1986) 188, where she takes the matter further, seeing the introduction of Iolaos as a conscious attempt by the Greeks to counterbalance the Phoenician tradition (Melkart = Herakles, Sardos son of Melkart = "Herakles' nephew/son, Iolaus"; this is very shaky ground). 4 P.

Of the two events in the Peloponnesian War, one occurred in the summer of 423, when Thebes tore down the walls of Thespiai on suspicion of àrruaa/ióç2, but there is no indication of a flight of Thespians in any direction. In 414, however, there was a popular uprising at Thespiai, which was crushed by the Thebans, with some of the insurgents fleeing to Athens3. An Athenian decree honouring Thespians has been connected with this incident4, and it has even been suggested that the Athenians may have planned to settle the Thespians and other pro- Athenian fugitives as colonists somewhere in their empire5. At this point we may note that there is some evidence for an Athenian "grand plan" in the west to subjugate, first Syracuse, then Sicily, Italy, and Carthage6. Sar- dinia, as a major Carthaginian possession, would have been high on the list7. So, if we must look for a real event behind the story of the migration of Thespians and Athenians led by Iolaos - although nothing obliges us to do so ~ the most likely occasion seems to be in the aftermath of the uprising of 414 B.C.

It is unnecessary to repeat the arguments for the identification of the spring, but I shall summarize the development of the place as a cult site. The original deity is the spring itself, Tilphossa. She is sometimes called Erinys, under which name she bore the Theban dragon to Ares and the horse Arion to Poseidon. In the Hymn to Apollo she is beautiful but jealous of her position. The vengeful Apollo defaces and buries her, but is unable to destroy her2. In fact, Apollo is a secondary figure in the cult. At first, he announces his inten- tion to build a temple, and even lays out its foundations, but in the end, all he leaves behind is an altar in the grove near the spring (383-384). Apollo's sanctuary is men- tioned only once after the Hymn, by Strabo (9.2.27 [410]: avrov òs Kal rò roO Tik&lt;f&gt;())(Toíov 'At oWœvoç ispòv). Here, and at 9.2.36 (414), the geographer refers to the monument of Teiresias by the fountain Tilphossa3. The collocation of a potent spring issuing from a hill or mountain and a prophetic male places this sanctuary among a group of similar oracular sites clustered around the Kopais4. Possibly related to a sanctuary of Apollo is a statue base bearing a dedication to Artemis, found in the excavations at the chapel of Haghios Joannis Prodromos5. But Artemis's presence might be explained otherwise as well, as part of the open-air sanctuary of the Praxidikai, which was in the territory of Haliartos and by Mount Til- phousion6. The location of the Praxidikai by Tilphossa is not surprising, given the functional similarity between them and the Erinyes: they can best be regarded as the direct descendants of the primitive deity of the spring. The three Praxidikai were 1 "Tilphossa: the Site and its Cults", in Cahiers des études anciennes 24 = Mélanges E.

Perhaps here he was following Apollodoros of Athens, as he so often did, and identifying Homeric sites. The tomb of Teiresias: Aristophanes of Boiotia FGrH 379F4; Diodoros of Sicily 4.67.1; Strabo 9.2.27 (411) and 9.2.36 (413); Pausanias 9.33.1; pseudo-Apollodoros 3.7.3. 4 The potency of Tilphossa is clear from the fact that a draught of her waters was enough to kill Teiresias. For a similar grouping of spring and heroic tomb, compare the monument of Arkesílaos by the banks of the Herkyna in the grove of Trophonios (Pausanias 9.39.3). The oracles in question are discussed by me in BICS 14 (1967) 1-16. See too P. Bonnechere, Kemos 3 (1990) 53-65, who disagrees with my interpretation of the data.

Alkomenia is clearly derived from Alalkomenai, the sanctuary of Athena near Tilphossion (in fact, the sanctuary of the Praxidikai and that of Athena can be taken as limitary sanctuaries of their respective poleis, that is, Haliartos and Koroneia); Thelxineia/Thelxinoia is similar to epithets of Hera in Athena and Italy: her presence here can be explained by the fact that the oak wood from which the trees for the Daidala were cut grew at Alalkomenai; Aulis is of course reminiscent of Artemis Aulideia. In sum, the names of the three Boiotian Praxidikai refer to Athena, Hera, and Artemis respectively, and the statue dedicated to Artemis could very well have been associated with their sanctuary1. In fact, the edifice excavated by Th. G. Spyropoulos and identified by him as the temple of Apollo Tilphossios, is more likely to have been an open-air enclosure with a sunken bothros to receive offerings to deities by whom oaths were sworn2. My reconstruction of the development of the site as a cult centre is as follows: first, there was the spring, which was deified as a god- dess who protected those who depended on her and punished any who offended them; to her was added, first the oracular group of nymph and male deity (Teiresias, Apollo), brought presumably by more recent inhabitants of the region; last to be added were the Praxidikai, themselves representatives of yet another type of deities - the female trinities -- common to Boiotia, but also linked by their avenging aspect to the original spring goddess, whose power thus persisted throughout antiquity3.

There is, however, another tradition, which places Euphemos at Hyria: here, although his father is still Poseidon, his mother is not Tityos' s daughter Europa, but Mekionike6. 1 The three Praxidikai: Dionysios of Chalkis, FHG 4 p.394F3, and see PRAXIDIKAI (HALIARTIA). 2 See my article, p. 338 (the argument is based on the extrapolated dimensions of the three surviving walls of the structure, and the sacrificial pit enclosed by them). 3 On the myths see L.

The témenos of a hero - or heroes -before the gates is not an unusual feature1. The most obvious Boiotian example is at the Theban Herakleion. Their function would have been to protect the entrance to the urban centre of the polis, and to act as a rallying point for the men of military age of the whole community. See HERAKLES (THEBES)2. The Herakleion of Tanagra itself seems to have been out- side the urban area: see HERAKLES (TANAGRA) and ADDENDA: HERAKLES (TANAGRA)3. The names of at least some of the individual heroes may go back to the period of synoikismos4. The three - Achilles, Hepolemos, and Peneleos ~ are described by Plutarch as ovy ysvsiç aravraq avTy/avrův ovraqp. A mutual relationship, while not obvious, may have existed. The Hesiodic Catalogue makes Tlepolemos son of Herakles by Astydameia, daughter of Ormenos6. Ormenos is associated with Eleon (a town in the Tanagraia), with the Ormenion near Pagasai, and with "Hellas"7. He was father of Amyntor, the father of Phoinix, who fled to Peleus, who in turn set him to tutor Achilles. This gives some kind of connection - but hardly ovyyévetct - between Achilles and Tlepolemos8, while the presence of Peneleos can be justified on the 1 J. S.

The matter is dis- cussed in Section 3, below. Many other attempts have been made to fix the site. See J. G. Frazer 5.203 and Hitzig-Blümner 3.516 on Pausanias 9.39.9. In 1912, A. D. Keramopoullos examined the areas by the Herkyna (in the vicinity of the niches) and inside the medieval kostro , but found nothing: Praktika 1912 (1913) 88-90 and see 77. E. Waszink, BABesch 43 (1968) 23-30 reviewed the evidence available at the time and concluded that it was on the mountain, at the summit of the precipice which overlooks the east bank of the Herkyna. N.

In each case, the cult retained its basic characteristics throughout antiquity. Although there is less evi- dence for Trophonios than for the Kabiroi, there is still enough to reconstruct the essential features of the cult and its development over time. The changes wrought by time cannot be underestimated, and it would be naïve to believe that details will have survived untouched or uncontaminated. The cult complex, in its fully developed form, shows a combination of three "cult types", as I have called them2: a) in the cult aition, Trophonios and his brother Agamedes form a pair of master builders, similar to Amphion and Zethos, who built the walls of Thebes3; 1 Much of the evidence is set out and analyzed by G. Radke, RE 7 A (1939) 678-695 sv "Trophonios". On the whole, I think that he extracts more out of it than it can offer, but this is a complaint which I have about most commentaries on this cult. Among others who have written at length about Trophonios are G. Dossin, "Une consultation à l'oracle de Trophonius à Lébadée", Le Musée belge 25 (1921) 209-220 (basically an annotated sum- mary of Pausanias's description); R. J. Clark, "Trophonios: the Manner of his Revelation", TAPA 99 (1968) 63-75; P. and M. Bonnechere, "Trophonios à Lébadée. Histoire d'un oracle", Les études clas- siques 57 (1989) 289-302. The last two are good workmanlike accounts, but, like the others, rely almost exclusively on the literary sources. 2 B1CS 14 (1967) 1-16; Teiresias Supplement 1 (1972) 17-30. A combination of cult types within the same sanctuary is not as unusual as it might seem. Not very far from Lebadeia, for example, at Tilphossa, it is possible to distinguish a number of distinct ele- ments, each added to the existing mass by a different set of worshippers: see my article in CEA 24 (1990) 333-340. 3 Teiresias Supplement 1 (1972) 20-21, and see the end of this section. Trophonios and Agamedes built a treasury for Hyrieus. They left a stone loose, which allowed them to make off with part of Hyrieus' s treasure; he set a trap which caught Agamedes, who urged his brother to cut off his head: to no avail, for Hyrieus chased Trophonios until the earth opened up and he fell into it; the story, told by Pausanias 9.37.5-7, is based on the Egyptian tale told by Herodotos 2.121. There is a Peloponnesian version of the story of Trophonios and Agamedes. It is told in Schol. Aristophanes, Clouds 508a, and attributed to Charax ( FGrH 103F5): Agamedes and Epikaste of Stymphalos in Arkadia had a son Kerkyon; Epikaste had a son of her own, Trophonios okótioç (father unnamed, but probably Apollo). Trophonios was, therefore, the stepson of Agamedes. In addition to building the temple of Apollo at Delphi, they built a storehouse of gold for Augeas at Elis, which they burgled (Agamedes was caught, Trophonios and Kerkyon fled to Orchomenos; Kerkyon ended up in Athens, Trophonios with Erginos at Lebadeia, where he dug a hole for himself and lived there until he died, whereupon he became an oracular god; he left behind him a son, Alkandros). A passage attributed to the Telegonia (p. 72-73 Davies = p. 101-102 Bernabé) tells how Odysseus received as a gift from Polyxenos of Elis a krater on which were rà Třepí T potjxiviov kcíí yAyaiiij0rļt&gt; Kai Avyéav. Trophonios and/or Agamedes in art: see C. Jacob, LIMC 1.1 (1981) sv "Agamedes" 255-256 (skepti- cal). A. H. Krappe, AKW 30 (1933) 228-241, traces the story of the theft from the treasury (of Augeas and Hyrieus) to Egypt, whence it would have been brought to Minyans in Boiotia, who took it to the Peloponnese. Z. Petre, "Trophonios ou l'architecte: A propos du statut des techniciens dans la cité grecque", Studii Clasice 18 (1979) 23-37, uses the story of Trophonios and Agamedes as the basis of a study of the low status accorded to artisans. 69</page><page sequence="72">TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA) b) in the cult, Trophonios inhabits one of a number of oracular sanctuaries found mostly around the edges of the Kopais, in each case within or at the limits of the X&lt;¡ opa of the community which owned it1. The cult complex consists of a male per- sonage and a female, the former regarded as residing in or personifying a hill or mountain, the latter represented by one or more springs issuing from the hill. The female is usually, but not always, the male's mother or Tp&lt;xf&gt;óç. Other examples are found at Tilphossa, Tegyra, Ptoion, Thourion, and the vicinity of the Teneric Plain. At Lebadeia, the pair seems to have been Trophonios and the river Herkyna2. The memory of Trophonios' s involvement with this kind of cult com- plex survived into late antiquity in the guise of Demeter Europe, who was represented in Pausanias as his rpo&lt;f&gt;óç 3; c) in the cult as well, Trophonios shared with Amphiaraos, at the other end of Boiotia, the character of an underground oracular god4. 1 shall look more closely at the characteristics shared by these two, as they may provide useful clues about the nature of Trophonios and the development of his cult5. In their cults, both Trophonios and Amphiaraos were thought of as living beings, that is, gods, rather than resuscitated mortals; they both functioned underground; they were approached directly by the consultant, Amphiaraos through lying on a ramskin on the ground, Trophonios through actual descent underground; they were consulted at night; they were connected, if not actually identified, with snakes; the seat of the oracle was in a ravine near the bank of a stream; each sanctuary was in the xúpa of its respective polis. In the cult aitia, each was pursued and swallowed up live by the earth; each had been famous in his lifetime, Amphiaraos as a seer and warrior, Trophonios as a master builder, possibly also a seer, and a warrior; each was connected with a group of outstanding people, Amphiaraos with the Seven against Thebes, Trophonios with his brother Agamedes, and perhaps his earthly father Erginos. 1 This is the cult type discussed in BICS 14 (1967). A different evaluation of the evidence for these and other Boiotian oracles is given by P. Bonnechere, "Les oracles de Béotie", Kernos 3 (1990) 53-65. We disagree on several points (in general, I tend to be harder on the evidence for individual oracles, while he is harder on that for the cult patterns). 2 In the literary traditions, which are all late, Herkyna is Trophonios 's daughter: I judge this to have resulted from the equation of Trophonios with Asklepios, possibly under the influence of Praxiteles's statue (see below, Section 5). Herkyna would then in her own turn have been assimilated to Asklepios's "daughter" Hygieia. Pausanias, in fact, remarks on the similarity of their joint statue to familiar groupings of Asklepios and his daughter (9.39.3). See Volume 2.38-39. Lykophron, Alexandra 153, lists Herkyn(n)a as one of the epithets of Demeter. The scholiast explains that the cult was founded by Trophonios's daughter Herkyna, who named the goddess after herself. It is possible, I suppose, that the use of the name as an epithet of Demeter may reflect a period when Herkyna was not Trophonios's daughter, but his trophos. 3 Pausanias 9.39.5. 4 See Volume 1.21-22 and BICS 14 (1967) 6-7. 5 A. Motte, Prairies et jardins de la Grèce antique (Brussels 1973) 243-244, notes the similarities between Amphiaraos ("l'héritier d'un génie chthonien") and Trophonios. He regards both as being closely connected with the fertility of the earth. P. Bonnechere, Kernos 3 (1990) 53-54, also groups Trophonios and Amphiaraos as oracular heroes (adding to the group Herakles at Hyettos). 70</page><page sequence="73">TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA) E. Rohde observed that neither Trophonios nor Amphiaraos was a hero in the strict sense, in that, although both of them were originally mortals, they did not die, but were instead translated during their lifetimes and lived on, underground, whence they delivered their oracular responses1 . The conclusion that they were not true "heroes" is correct, but there are traditions in which both men did die2. The problem is that cult aition has been confused with cult. The cult aitia refer to mortals, but the cult is the cult of an underground oracular god, who is immortal. It may be reasonable to assume that, since the god in question was given a different name in each of his sanctuaries, his original name had been forgotten. Certainly Amphiaraos* s pedigree is beyond doubt Peloponnesian3, and his name seems to have been given to a local deity by the people of Oropos primarily because he represented the enemy of their enemies, namely the Thebans. With Trophonios, the situation is less clear. There are three possibilities, first, that the name belonged to the underground oracular deity to begin with; second, that it was the name of the male partner in the male/female, hill/spring, cult type; third, that it was originally the name of one of the pair of master builders, and only later attached to the oracle. Most of the etymologies which have been proposed for the name "Trophonios" (or "Trephonios" as it appears in the Boiotian dialect) are based on the root Tp&lt;xf&gt;-, and would make Trophonios either a "nursling" or a "nourisher", or one who came from a place of nourishment; it has also been suggested that the name is pre-Greek4. An etymology having to do with nursing or nourishing might be relevant in the second of the two cases noted above, in which the name was that of the male associ- ated with a female mother or trophos. It would be irrelevant in the other two cases. Indeed, one might even consider the name "Agamedes" as having originally been an epithet of Trophonios, but one would be no wiser as a result. Nor is an etymology for Trophonios derived from rpo&lt;t&gt;- entirely satisfactory, since the name, being adjectival in form, means something like "the one who belongs to Trophon (or Trephon)", the latter being either a place or a person5. The nearest one gets to a place with a possible name is Trapheia (or Trepheia, but the reading is insecure), a town apparently near the eastern end of the Kopais6, and a lake Trephia, perhaps - but not necessarily -- 1 E. Rohde, transi. W. B. Hillis, Psyche (London 1925) 121, and see 90 and 101.

As for the person, the form "Trephon"2 would seem to be masculine, so that "Trephonios" should mean "he who belongs to the male entity that nourishes". I am compelled to conclude that etymology will tell us nothing about the origins of the cult. And, as far as the matter of priority is concerned, our earliest sources, all of the sixth century, already show Trophonios as both master-builder and oracular fig- ure: he is the former in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo and in the Telegonia , and the latter in a fragment of the Hesiodic Catalogue , where he is made a son of Apollo3. It has been suggested that Trophonios's was a iatromantic sanctuary, but there is no evidence whatever that healing was part of the function of the oracle. Nor is there any evidence beyond a supposed etymology of the name that Trophonios was in any way connected with fertility4. 2) The Sanctuary: contents and development The fullest description is that by Pausanias, and I shall begin this section with a summary of what he saw5. The sanctuary, which Pausanias calls the à'aoç rov Tpo&lt;ļ&gt;wpiov , was separated from the town, probably by the river Herkyna6. Near the bank of the river was a 1 Strabo 9.2.20 (407), lakes lying about the Kopais: íí tc Tpeóíct, Kal ri Kri óiaaíç. 2 Which we may take to be the basic form, just as Tilphossa ~ Boiotian ~ must have precedence over Telphousa, and Kabiros over Kabeiros. 3 Hymn to Apollo 295-297 ; Telegonia p. 72-73 Davies = p. 101-102 Bernabé: both with Agamedes.

In Pausanias âXaoç seems to have two uses: either a grove of trees, large or small, usually con- nected with or enclosing a sanctuary, or a large sanctuary complex, which contains smaller sanctuaries within it: Epidauros (2.27.1-6) and Olympia (5.10.1) are the largest. The ákaoç of Trophonios at Lebadeia belongs to the second category. 72</page><page sequence="75">TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA) temple of Herkyna, and in it a representation of a girl holding a goose in her arms1 . In the cave (no doubt the same one in which, according to the aition, the goose had hidden itself) were both the sources of the river and standing cult images, with ser- pents coiled around their sceptres. Those figures resembled Asklepios and Hygeia, but were in fact Trophonios and Herkyna2. Beside the river (I presume this would have been near the source) was the fiprjļia of Arkesílaos, his bones having been brought thither from Troy by Leïtos3. Also flowing into the river were two adjacent springs, one named after Lethe, the other after Mnemosyne4. The most prominent features of the grove were the temple and cult image of Trophonios5. The cult image, by Praxiteles, also resembled Asklepios. Probably the earlier cult image - attributed to Daidalos -- was also kept in the temple, but in an aSvroPy together with other dedications, which included the so-called shield of Aristomenes6. There was a sanctuary of Demeter Europe, and Zeus Hyetios in the open air7. The grove also contained a hostel for the housing of consultants and their 1 9.39.3: According to the story told to Pausamas, the source of the river Herkyna was discovered when a goose belonging to Herkyna, having escaped from her, hid under a rock.

Compare Pliny, nh 31.15 ("juxta flumen Hercynnan"), and Isidoros, Origines 13.13.3. It has been suggested - by S. Symeonoglou and N. Pharaklas, ADelt 22 (1967 [1968]) B. 1.244-245 - that these springs were at the foot of Profìtis Elias hill. I do not think this fits the sequence of events as described by Pausanias (sacrifice at the pit of Agamedes, bathing in the river, drinking from the springs, praying to the cult image [presumably in the temple], and thence to the oracle, which is described here but not before as being vTèp tò ãXaoç). At least one spring survives: it has been redirected underground and paved over, but when I first saw it in 1958 it issued from the foot of the Kastro hill: above the spot are carved a number of niches, presumably for votive offerings. See Frazer's description (5.196-197) and note that the flow of one of the springs was altered during the nineteenth century. The springs Lethe and Mnemosyne have been cited in connection with the Mnemosyne which fig- ures - in a formulaic expression - on two Orphic gold tablets or leaves, from Petelia and Pharsalos: see, for example, W. K. C. Guthrie, Orpheus and Greek Religion (London 1952) 177-178. G. Zuntz, who publishes the documents and comments on them in detail, is rightly skeptical about the connec- tion with the springs at Lebadeia: Persephone (Oxford 1971) 379. 5 9.39.4: "Most prominent" is a translation of rà ôè ¿xt&lt;^a rearara. Both expressions are equally ambiguous, meaning either "most important" or "most visible", or both.

Aristomenes' s shield was fetched from Trophonios to Leuktra on the occasion of the battle (Pausanias 4.32.5-6). One suspects that these stories arose out of the restoration of Messene by the Thebans under Epameinondas: a dedication by the Messenians at the oracle of Trophonios would have had symbolic value.

Also in the grove was a ßoOpoq named after Agamedes: this was where the earth opened up to receive Trophonios. Beside it stood a stele. On the night of consultation, the consultant would sacrifice a ram over this pit, and call upon Agamedes1 . As for the oracle itself, Pausanias remarks that sari òs tò ļiavrsiov vt sp tò aXaoç stí rov Spovç (9.39.9.

The oracular hole was in a man-made, oven-like structure, enclosed by a fence of metal rails2. Nearby was the throne of Mnemosyne, on which the dazed consultant was seated and, as it were, "debriefed" (9.39.13). Proceeding from the oracular hole towards the forepart of the mountain (that is, towards the east3), one came upon an area called Kóprçç 0r¡pa4 and the unfinished temple of Zeus Basileus5. In the vicinity were also a second temple, with images of Kronos, Hera, and Zeus, and a sanctuary of Apollo (9.39.4). It is surely unusual that the site of the oracle should have been outside the bound- aries of the sanctuary6. My explanation of how this came about is as follows7: A grandiose project was begun in the last third of the third century B.C. to build a new, massive, temple of Zeus Basileus on a hill-top in full view of the road to Del- phi. This undertaking, which seems to have been started by Lebadeia, was eventually taken over by the Boiotian Koinon, which set up a college of naopoioi to oversee the work (the dissolution of the Koinon in 171 B.C. put paid to this, although the naopoioi continued in office for some centuries as one of the few surviving quasi- federal bodies in Boiotia). It is my contention that the project included the removal of the focal point of the oracle of Trophonios from the ãXaoç to the vicinity of the new 1 The pit and disappearance of Trophonios: 9.37.7. The sacrifice: 9.39.6. Although Pausanias does not specifically identify the two, it hardly seems rash for us to do so. This may also have been the same opening into which the bees disappeared, followed by Saon, who "discovered" the oracle: 9.40.2. G. Dossin, Le Musée belge 28 (1921) 215-216, and P. Guillon, "La stèle d'Agamédès", RPhil 10 (1936) 209-235, note the similarities between the ritual at the bothros and that in the Nekyia of the Odyssey. There is no doubt that the former was modelled, at least in part, on the latter. Guillon takes the stele to be a prehellenic kóXqooóç (following E. Benveniste's explanation of the term). I suppose its original function might have been sacrificial, or to mark the spot where Trophonios had dis- appeared. This is, of course, assuming that the stele was not a late addition to the scene. 2 Pausanias 9.39.9-10; Philostratos, Vita Apollonii 8.19; see too IG 7.3077. 3 The remains of the oracular hole discovered by Phar aklas and Vallas were west of the foundations of the temple of Zeus Basileus and southwest of the former chapel of the Prophet Elias. My wife and I visited the site in 1975 and saw the hole. It has since been obliterated by construction on the hilltop. 4 9.39.4. The passage is obelized by Hitzig, and various emendations have been proposed. See Vol. 1.241. 5 Compare Livy 45.27.8, writing of L. Aemilius Paullus, who in 167 B.C. "Lebadiae quoque templům Iovis Trophonii adit; ibi cum vidisset os specus, per quod . . . descendunt". For "os specus", com- pare Philostratos, Vita Apollonii 8.19: móiuov. ® There is no question of Pausanias's having got this wrong. Not only is his description explicit, but it is confirmed in no uncertain terms by Philostratos (and probably Livy), and besides, the place was where he said it was. 7 Taken from AJPhil 105 (1984) 268-270. 74</page><page sequence="77">TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA) temple of Zeus Basileus and to a new artificial oracular chasm, with a superstructure resembling, as Pausanias put it, a bake-oven1 . If I am correct in my reading of the evidence, the original site of the oracle was inside the âXaoç, probably at the pit into which Trophonios was said to have vanished, and which, at least in Pausanias's day, was called the ßoQpoq of Agamedes. It has not been located, nor has any candidate been proposed. All we know is that it was inside the akaoç of Trophonios, and that it was in all likelihood a natural rather than artificial feature. It ought to have been near the temple of Trophonios2. Although all literary sources from Herodotos on make it clear that the consultant descended, that is, went underground, to encounter Trophonios, only Euripides gives any indication of the physical nature of the sanctuary in his day. He refers to ori noi and OáXafim of Trophonios3. Normally &lt;tijkóç describes a fenced-off area, sacred or profane4: an example from Euripides is the &lt;777 kóç of Semeie at Thebes, the focal point of the cult of Dionysos5. Bákány, on the other hand, is a den or lair, or grave. Euripides thus attests the two principal features of the oracle: the underground hole where Trophonios resided, and the open-air enclosure surrounding that hole. The term oi)kòç is used in IG 7.3077, an inscription of the first or second century A.D. listing contributors to works conducted on the iepòç orçicóç: this, of course would have been the man-made structure on the hill by the temple of Zeus Basileus6. This will, I hope, explain the topographical peculiarities of the oracle, and we can now turn to a chronological survey of its history. By the sixth century B.C., Trophonios had been installed as the inhabitant of the oracle. The cult image attributed to Daidalos, to which Pausanias alludes (9.39.8) would have belonged to this period, if not earlier, and one presumes that there was some place to house it. The oracle may have been consulted by Kroisos, but we can- not be certain of this. It would, at the time, have been within the territory of Orchomenos7. 1 Initially a project of the polis: IG 7.4136. Involvement of the koinon: P. Roesch, Études béotiennes (París 1982) 392-386, who at 392 note 60 lists the various pieces of the building contract for the temple of Zeus Basileus and studies of the document.

Displacement of basic features of a sanctuary: see, for example, G. Roux, Delphes (Paris 1976) 136-145 (Kassotis). 2 Perhaps therefore on the hill. For a similar hilltop - or hillside - hole providing access to the underworld, compare the nearby sanctuary of Herakles Charops, where Herakles was said to have brought Kerberos up from Hades: Pausanias 9.34.5, and see Volume 2.4. 3 Euripides, Ion 300 and 394 respectively. 4 For example, P. Chantraine, Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue grecque 4 (Paris 1977) sv. 5 See Volume 1.187-188. 6 Perhaps the oijkóç referred to in IG 7.3073 (1.90: etę tt]v ¿£oj vepíoTctoiv tov (ttjkov) may have been intended to house the oracle. For a reconstruction of the plan of this part of the temple, see G. Roux, MH 17 (1960) 175-184. 7 Everything between Orchomenos and Mount Laphystion (which is between Lebadeia and Koroneia) must originally have belonged to Orchomenos, one of whose kings, Athamas, was closely connected with the cult of Zeus Laphystios: see ZEUS (LAPHYSTION). Support for this can be found in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, which makes Trophonios and Agamedes sons of Erginos (295-297), who is, in other traditions, king of Orchomenos; see my article in H. Beister and J. Buckler, edd., Boiotika (Munich 1989) esp. 80 and note 31. 75</page><page sequence="78">TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA) Prior to the battle of Plataia, in 480/479 B.C., Trophonios may have been con- sulted by Mys for Mardonios1 . However, the oracle really became known on the world or - more precisely and literally - the Athenian stage in the second half of the fifth century. To Herodotos can be added the passages in Euripides, Ion from which it appears that the oracle of Trophonios may have been visited by people on their way to Delphi, perhaps as a regular occurrence2. Various Athenian comic poets wrote about Trophonios, either whole plays about him, or in passing references: they were intrigued by the complicated and frightening ritual of consultation and, of course, mocked it3. There are two possible reasons for this sudden emergence. One is the fact that Herodotos had referred to the oracle as a place consulted by the great. Another event which could have brought Trophonios to the notice of Athenians was the Battle of Koroneia of 447 B.C. (which Xenophon, Memorabilia 3.5.4, says took place sv Asßadeiy4). Tolmides and his force were returning from Chaironeia, where he had installed an Athenian garrison, when they were intercepted at Koroneia (Thucydides 1.113.3-4). There would have been occasion enough then for the Athenians to acquaint themselves with Trophonios; furthermore, I think it likely that, if the epigram CEG 1.5 does refer to the Battle of Koroneia, then the nç . . . H eynOêòv mentioned in it was Trophonios5. I do not take seriously the story of the discovery of 1 Mys: see the next section. An inscription of the fifth century which seems to be connected with financial matters concerning a publicly operated enterprise (/G 7.3086) may have to do with Trophonios, but the restoration is extremely doubtful. The text survives in transcriptions by Koehler, Pittakis, and Ross. Dittenberger restored the surviving first line as the third of the document, and proposed reading Aeßa6e[i]a[ilu)[v Tp]e&lt;}xj)[ví'o[i'. I do not think there is enough left of this line to justify the restorations, and am in any case unhappy with the presence of an Attic lambda in a fifth century Boiotian inscription.

Antonio Salieri wrote a comic opera in two acts entitled La Grotta di Tro fonio, but alas, it is beyond the scope of this study. 4 G. Busolt, Griechische Geschichte 3.1 (Stuttgart 1897) 423 n. 2 (on p.424): on this passage, "es ist nicht anzunehmen, dass Xenophon den Namen verwechselt hat. Möglicherweise zog sich Tolmides nach der Niederlage auf Lebadeia zurück, wo ein letzter Kampf und die Kapitulation stattfand". I agree with what he says about Xenophon' s veracity, but the explanation is unnecessarily complicated. But see Gomme on Thucydides 1.113.2. ^ As originally suggested by N. Kyparissis and W. Peek, AM 57 (1932) 142-146, esp. 145-146 (Nahe dem Wege von Chaironeia nach Koroneia liegt das Trophonion von Lebadeia: so könnte es | Trophonios gewesen sein, der die Athener Seictv rjXuaw àrnáaaç geschädigt hat"). See also Volume 2.5 note 3 = SEG 36.45. C. M. Bowra, Problems in Greek Poetry (Oxford 1953) 93-107 esp. 99-100 = CQ 32 (1938) 80-88 esp. 83-84, suggested the demi-god was Orion. C. J. Duli, A Study of the Leadership of the Boeotian League from the invasion of the Boiotoi to the King* s Peace (Diss. University of Wisconsin 1975) 41- 45, opts for Herakles. The foregoing all associate the epigram with the battle of Koroneia. H. B. Mattingly, however, argues that it dealt with the battle of Delion, and that the hero was Amphiaraos: Historia 12 (1963) 261-263, CQ 16 (1966) 176-177 and 191-192. 76</page><page sequence="79">TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA) the oracle by Saon of Akraiphia (Pausanias 9.40.1-2), preferring to regard it as a late concoction1. Lebadeia was pillaged by Lysandros in 395/394, and it is to be presumed that the sanctuary shared its fate. In any case, a full-scale re-organization of the sanctuary seems to have taken place during the fourth century B.C., probably after the Battle of Leuktra, and after the reduction of Orchomenos, when Lebadeia became fully inde- pendent. It is to be remembered that the Thebans established the Basileia and the cult of Zeus Basileus at Lebadeia, partly at least in order to manifest their superiority over their old enemies at Orchomenos. Lebadeia would have benefitted from this policy. For example, the creation of a new cult image, by Praxiteles, may have been just part of a larger building programme. It certainly would have cost a great deal to secure the services of a sculptor of his standing2. The oracle is said to have prophesied to Philip of Macedón, but the content of the response has not come down to us. Trophonios was also silent over the subsequent fate of Boiotia and Thebes. The oracle was still functioning and popular during the latter part of the fourth century, since Dikaiarchos of Messene and the comic poets Alexis and Menander wrote about it. Pausanias reports that a member of the bodyguard of a Demetrios had entered the oracle with the intention of plundering it, and suffered death for his impiety: this suggests that the sanctuary was sacked, per- haps by the troops of Demetrios Poliorketes. If it was Demetrios Poliorketes, then there might have been a subsequent restoration of the sanctuary which included the 1 See my comments in AJPhil 105 (1984) 269 note 46. There I suggest that what gave rise to the tale may have been one of the votive tripods set up at a number of Boiotian sanctuaries by the hellenistic Boiotian koinon, in accordance with an injunction from the federal oracle of Apollo Ptoios. On the tripods see Volume 1.67 and note 3. 2 Lysandros at Lebadeia: Plutarch, Lysandros 28.2 (449B). Reduction of Orchomenos: J. Buckler, The Theban Hegemony , 371-362 BC (Cambridge, Mass. 1980) 182-184. The popularity of the oracle in the fourth century is reflected in allusions by Herakleides Pontikos fir. 155 Wehrli, and Kallisthenes, FGrH 124F1 1 and 22a/b (prophecy before the Battle of Leuktra). Another prophecy before Leuktra is reported by Diodoros of Sicily 15.53.4 in the form of an injunction to produce an agon stephanites in honour of Zeus Basileus after the victory. This is clearly anachronistic (although evidence for the agon does go back to the fourth century: see ZEUS [LEBADEIA]), and Pausanias (4.32.5-6) records a prophecy ordering the Boiotians to set up a trophy using the shield of the Messenian hero Aristomenes: the political motivation behind this is clear. In another version, Epameinondas arranged for a stranger to report to the Thebans that Trophonios had foretold victory (Polyainos 2.3.8). See C. J. Tuplin, Klio 69 (1987) 99-103, for a sound analysis of die various accounts of the prophecies before Leuktra (especially 102-103 about M es se nia and Aristomenes). Praxiteles: Pausanias 9.39.4. (Trophonios in the guise of Asklepios); compare Cicero, De Natura Deorum 3.56, where Trophonios is described as a second Mercury, son of Valens (i.e. Ischys) and Phoronis, and thus the brother of a second Aesculapius: see C. Koth, RE 7A (1948) 2096 sv "Valens" (1). 77</page><page sequence="80">TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA) erection of a statue of Trophonios by Euthykrates, possibly the very one seen by Pausanias at the source of the Herkyna. 1 . During the third century B.C., a boundary settlement fixed by the Boiotian federal government between Lebadeia and - most probably - Koroneia, may reflect the pre- eminence of Trophonios at Lebadeia, if P. Roesch's restoration [τας Τ ροφ]ωνι,άδας yàç ļ [ ίοίβδίς ] is, as I suspect, correct. So does the dedication to Trophonios by the Lebadeian cavalry troop which had won in its category at the Pamboiotia2. The displacement of the oracle towards the end of the third century from the άλσος to the vicinity of the temple of Zeus Basileus resulted not only in the closer physical proximity of the two gods, but also in a closer association in cult. There were two periods when Trophonios was actually identified with Zeus. The first was of relatively short duration, during the second century B.C. and into the first; the second began late in the first century A.D., perhaps in conjunction with the resumption of the Trophoneia (on which see below). It is in fact possible to trace the development of the relationship between Trophonios and Zeus from joint offerings to the two gods, to single offerings to the combined gods: see Appendix 2. Under the Empire, as Pausanias, Plutarch, Lukian, Maximus of Tyre, and the third century A.D. inscription IG 7.3426 make clear, the connection was not rigidly adhered to, Trophonios being regarded by these sources independently of Zeus3. The oracle was sacked by some of Sulla's troops in 87/86 B.C.4. Thereafter, apart from the reference by Strabo 9.2.38 (414), nothing is heard about it until late in the 1 Oracle to Philip: Ailian, vh 3.45 (Φιλπτπω φασϊ χρηστηριον έπεσείν εν Β οιωτοις èv Τροφωνίου).

Badian, The Ancient History Bulletin 1.1 (1987) 13 (Trophonios's was the only Greek oracle to have foretold Sulla's success). Earlier still, in 95 B.C., the oracle had produced responses pertaining to the affairs of Rome: Julius Obsequens, Prodigia 50 (110). Sulla, HHR l2 p.201F16: he was approached by an Italian π pay ματευό μένος, Quintus or Quintius Titius, who had consulted Trophonios, and by one of his own officers, Sal vienus, who had done so too. The first-named may appear in IG 12.9.952 as Πόπλιος Κ oíynoç Τίτου β Ρωμαίος . See too J. Hatzfeld, Les trafiquants italiens dans l'orient hellénique (Paris 1919) 41 and note 2. It has been suggested that the sanctuary of Trophonios, like that of Amphi araos, benefitted from the generosity of Sulla: J. A. O. Larsen, "Roman Greece", in T. Frank, ed., An Economic Survey of Ancient Rome 4 (Baltimore 1938) 365, with the approval of M. Feyel, Contribution à l'épigraphie béotienne (Le Puy 1942) 86-87, and P. W. Wallace, Strabo* s Description of Boiotia (Heidelberg 1979) 177. This is an appealing idea. The Romans certainly seem to have found the oracle attractive. 78</page><page sequence="81">TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA) first century A.D., when it is described as the only Boiotian oracle still functioning by Plutarch, who refers to heavy fréquentation. There is the hint of a revival ~ therefore, perhaps, subsequent to a lapse ~ in the story of Apollonios's two visits to Lebadeia, and possibly epigraphical evidence for it as well. The oracle was well-known throughout the second century and beyond, and continued to operate at least until the Herulian incursion; eventually the site was taken over by a chapel of St. Christopher, and fades from view1. 3) The Oracle The oracle became well known in the second half of the fifth century, but probably functioned before then: so we must deduce from the Hesiodic reference to Trophonios 1 Trophonios the only Boiotian oracle still functioning: Plutarch, De Defectu Oraculorum S (411E-F). Plutarch wrote a piece on the oracle of Trophonios (Ilcpt rrjç eiç T pcxfxcviov KaraffâaeœÇy number 181 in the "Lamprias" catalogue), which has not survived; his description of a fictional descent by Timarchos provides the framework for the philosophical discussion in the De Genio Socratis : 21-22 (590A-592E). Possible revival and restoration in the second half of the first century A.D.: (a) Philostratos, Vita Apollonii 4.24 (he visited a number of sanctuaries, including that of Trophonios, ôiopOovfiévœ avrà); (b) IG 7.3077 (a list of subscribers - oCbe ovveßakomo eiç tòv tov iepov or} kov [tirepißoXov], or per- haps, for example, [(ám)Teixw¡Mir'9 or, as D.

The contributions are mostly in the range of 10-25 drachmas, with at least one of 50, and two of 100. The stone is not complete, but the list as far as it goes accounts for 550 drachmas. It may have been connected with a major rebuilding of the OT1KÓÇ into the form in which Pausanias saw it. Dittenberger dated this inscription in the second half of the first century A.D., or early in the second); (c) compare also Plutarch's monograph (see above). D. Knoepfler, Chiron 22 (1992) 486.156, is not certain that IG 7.3077 deals with Trophonios at all, noting that Pausanias 9.39.4, refers to several temples nearby. However, what with the presence of the priest of Zeus Trophonios at the head of the list of subscribers, and given the other indications of a revival, I think it is more likely than not that it does have to do with Trophonios. Knoepfler' s ingenious restoration (see above) would suit Pausanias's description of the oracular structure quite well. Pausanias's account, and those of Lukian and Maximus of Tyre, bear adequate witness to the con- tinued activity of the oracle. In the third century A.D., the sanctuary was the headquarters rrjç 'O iwvoiaç tûv 'EXkrjvuv irapà tú Tp&lt;xf&gt;wpícú (IG 7.3426: statue honouring the archpriestess for life of this body, and of the Boiotian koinon of Itonian Athena and of the koinon of the Phokian ethnos). From the third century as well comes the inscription ADelt 3 (1917) 421 note 2.5 = P.

Not necessarily: what survived - a hole in the ground - was the only part of the struc- ture that could not physically be removed from the site (until recently, that is). St. Christopher: Schol.

A consultation of Trophonios was called a Karaßaatg2, from which it is clear that the main act was a physical descent underground. The most complete description we have, by Pausanias, is naturally valid primarily for his own time, and no doubt included many details added or altered at various stages in the sanctuary's develop- ment. However, certain elements consistently form part of the tradition, and some are found even in the earliest sources which deal with the oracle. Thus, we know that consultation was conducted face to face as it were between consultant and deity, without the intervention of a prophet or priest3. Second, we have no evidence that * Herodotos: J.

Crahay, La Littéra- ture oraculaire chez Hérodote (Paris 1956) 195 (highly skeptical about the consultation by Kroisos); 292 (accepting the consultation by Mys). The story of Aristomenes of Messenia, his consultation and the dedication of his shield (Pausanias 4.32.5-6 and 9.39.14) is accepted more or less at face value by H. W. Parke and D. E. W.

Third, the consultant was obliged to take with him honey cakes and perhaps other edible gifts to placate serpents which were said to be awaiting him below2. Fourth, the consultation occurred at night3. Fifth, the oracular experience could be either aural or visual or both4. Sixth, this experience was frightening, to the point where it was claimed that consultants of Trophonios lost the ability to laugh5. Seventh, it was expensive6. 1 But see Appendix 1, IG 7.3055, line 30. The inscription IG 7.3090 (Ittkwv 'EicivUctv Ni kíxxo | Ait Tpe&lt;ļ&gt;wvioi) does not constitute an excep- tion.

[Aristotle], De Mundo 4 (395b) groups Lebadeia and Delphi as oracles where irveviictTct issued from y rjç otó/xl a, but this is probably learned theorizing. R. J. Clark, TAPA 99 (1968) 73-74, sug- gests the use of an hallucinatory drug, "added to the water of Lethe or Mnemosyne" . 5 Aristophanes, Clouds 506-508, plays on the fearsomeness. Semos of Delos, FGrH 396F10, tells the story of Parmeniskos of Metapontum who, having lost the ability to laugh as a result of consulting Trophonios, went to Delphi for advice (J. Fontenrose, The Delphic Oracle [Berkeley, Los Angeles, London 1978] 328 Q18, lists this among "not genuine" responses). Pausanias 9.39.13 is at pains to assure his readers that in due course the power of laughter did return. The expression eiç Tp&lt;xj&gt;o)i&gt;íov fieiiàirevrat was applied to people of gloomy mien: Apostolios 6.17; 6.82; Diogenianos 1.8; Greg. Cypr. 2.24; 2.97; Makarios 3.63; Nonnos, PG 36.1069; Plutarch, Proverbs 51 (Paroem. Gr. 1.329); Suidas 2.543.323 (Adler); Zenobios 3.61. The exhaustive and exhausting preliminaries, the nocturnal hour, the solitude at the bottom of the pit, all would be enough to build up a certain degree of apprehension within the consultant; and then, the sudden physical shock of being sucked into the hole would be more than enough to induce the proper state of mind. Once inside, the darkness and a touch of claustrophobia would magnify the effect of any sight or sound, which need not have been distinct enough to convey instant meaning. This could be provided later, by the priests. ® This we can deduce not only from Pausanias's description of his own consultation, which involved living in a hostel within the a'aoç for several days and the performance of numerous sacrifices, but also from the fourth century B.C. inscription IG 7.3055 (see Appendix 1), which set a minimum con- sultation fee of ten drachmas in cash and ten eilytai. At roughly the same period, the fee for consult- ing Amphiaraos at Oropos varied between six and nine obols: see A. Petropoulou, "The Eparche Documents and the Early Oracle at Oropus", GRBS 22 (1981) 39-63, esp. 53-54 (concerning the inscriptions AE [1925/1926] 43.155 and IG 7.235). See now SEG 38.386 (D. Knoepfler, on the dates of the Amphiaraos documents). 81</page><page sequence="84">TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA) A brief summary of Pausanias's own experience1 may give the flavour of what it was like to consult Trophonios2 (where Pausanias's account is matched or con- tradicted by other sources, this is mentioned in the notes). First the consultant stayed for a fixed number of days in a house sacred to Agathos Daimon and Agathe Tyche. During this time he bathed only in the water of the Herkyna, and conducted a number of sacrifices to the divinities associated with the sanctuary, being permitted to partake of the meat of the sacrificed beasts3. The entrails of every victim were examined by a mantis to see if the omens were favourable4. On the night of the actual descent the consultant put on special clothes5. The procedure began with the sacrifice of a ram over a pit while calling upon Agamedes: only if the omens from this sacrifice were favourable could the consultation proceed. Two thirteen-year-old local boys, called Hermai (presumably because they were in a sense psychopompoi), took the consultant to the Herkyna, where they anointed and bathed him**. Then the priests took him to two adjacent fountains, of Lethe and Mnemosyne, from which he drank in succession to clear his mind of previous thoughts and prepare it for receiving the oracle7. Then he was shown the Daidalic cult image of Trophonios, and prayed to and worshipped 1 9.39.14: ypá&lt;1xt) òè ovk àKor'v àXXà trépovç re iSàv xai avròç tú Tpoćwńu 'pr¡aá1iev°q. On Pausamas and Trophonios, see J. Heer, La Personnalité de Pausanias (Paris 1979) 302-305. See too C. Habicht, Pausanias'' Guide to Greece (Berkeley, Los Angeles, London 1985) 154 note 57. The elaborate ritual which Pausanias underwent has been described as "a device by smart priests aiming to refurbish the waning lustre of their patrimony in an age when traditional cults were faced with die alternative of 'progress or perish'": G. Zuntz, Persephone (Oxford 1971) 379. This seems to assume that charlatanry flourished only in later antiquity. It is generally accepted that the Timarchos who consulted Trophonios in Plutarch's De Genio Socratis was a fictional character: see, for example, J. Buckler, The Theban Hegemony, 371-362 BC (Cambridge, Mass. 1980) 38-39; Y. Vernière, Symboles et mythes dans la pensée de Plutarque (Paris 1977) 105-108; J. Hani, "Le mythe de Timarque chez Plutarque et la Structure de l'Extèse", REG 88 (1975) 105-120. We can at least accept that although Timarchos was unreal, his descent could have been based on actual practice during Plutarch's lifetime. The same can be said about Lukian's Menippos. Both Vernière and Hani remark on the similarity of the ritual to rites of initiation, but I think that this is a relatively late accretion. 2 Pausanias 9.39.5-14. See the commentary by S. Levin, ANRW 2.18.2 (Berlin and New York 1989) 1637-1642. 3 In earlier periods there seem to have been restrictions on the food one might eat, or indeed an entire ban: Krātiņos, F233 PCG (218 Edm.), 236 (221), perhaps 507. 4 Preliminary rites: Apostolios 17.30; Kosmas, PG 38.512f.; Philostratos, Vita Apollonii 8.19 (Apol- lonios went down without having performed any preliminary rites); Plutarch, De Genio Socratis 21 (590A); Schol. Aristophanes, Clouds 508; Suidas 4.597.1065 (Adler). Krātiņos, F234 PCG (|#ife Kal róôifc Kal òtappuvov) might, I suppose, be interpreted as referring to a ritual dance, while F237 (222 Edm.) seems to refer to singing; but these are not enough to con- stitute evidence for such activities' being part of the ritual of consultation or its preliminaries. 5 Special clothes: Apostolios 17.30; Kephisodoros, F3; 4; Lukian, Dialogi Mortuorum 3; Maximus of Tyre 8(14).2; Philostratos, Vita Apollonii 8.19; Schol. Aristophanes, Clouds 50S; Suidas 4.597.1065 (Adler). 6 Pausanias notes that they tended to the consultant's general needs (9.39.7: òróaa 'pr¡ òuxkovoviisvoi otre Taîôeç) ■ ' Here (9.39.8) Pausanias refers to tò òffléma, so perhaps this was his experience. 82</page><page sequence="85">TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA) it, whereafter he proceeded to the oracle. Once there, he was let down into the chasm by means of a ladder. At the bottom, he lay on his back1, honey-cakes in hands, thrust his feet and legs up to the knees into a narrow gap between the wall and floor of the pit2, whereupon he was sucked3 through the hole and into the õcòvtop . We have no way of telling what actually happened inside: presumably there were hands and arms waiting to pull the person in through the gap; presumably also a show of sound and/or sight was managed, related in some way to the consultant's request; probably, as at most other oracles, the request had been presented previously in written form4. The future having been revealed, he was thrust out again feet first through the hole by which he had entered5. Somehow he got back up to ground level, and was seated by the priests on a throne called after Mnemosyne, and asked to describe his experience. Since the consultant was in a state of shock, his replies could of course be manipu- lated with ease by the priests, who would eventually produce a written response to order: in any case, given the length of the preliminary stages, there would have been enough time to prepare a reply appropriate to the request6. Then he was taken back by his entourage to the house of the Good Daimon and Tyche. Before leaving, he was required to dedicate a tablet describing his experience. From Plutarch we learn that the oracle functioned only at specified times, possibly in connection with a festival and perhaps at the same time as Delphi, to catch the passing trade, as it were7. As is obvious from the foregoing, the whole process was geared to extracting as much out of the consultant as possible. For example, the entire procedure of consulta- tion could be halted if the omens from the sacrifice to Agamedes were deemed unfavourable: one can see how, if so minded, the officials of the oracle could drag 1 Compare Maximus of Tyre 8(14).2: timoc, and see Plutarch, De Genio Socratis 22 (592E). 2 On the narrowness of die opening, see Lucían, Dialogi Mortuorum 3 and Menippos 22 (jaicetvòv otóulov)-, Maximus of Tyre 8(14). 2 (otólliov ot évo v). 3 Compare Schol. Aristeides 3 (p. 65.30 Dindorf): TPevfiara] ota rov Tpofaovíov; and Schol. Aristophanes. Clouds 50%. 4 As, for example, at Korope (Sy//All57) and Dodona (Sy//A 1160-1166). Such must have been the form of the consultation by Kallikleidas: IG 7.4136 (see SEG 34.352). 5 There are variations on this theme: Plutarch, De Genio Socratis 22 (592E); Philostratos, Vita Apol- lonii 8. 19; Lukian, Menippos 22; Schol. Aristophanes, Clouds 508; Suidas 4.597.1065 (Adler). " Pausanias 4.32.5 quotes a response from Trophonios in hexameters delivered before the battle of Leuktra. This was probably fabricated after the event, but it suggests that the staff at the oracle were prepared to adapt their procedures to serve their clientèle. A different kind of response is hinted at by Kallisthenes, FGrH 124F22A, who claimed that the Boiotian augurs interpreted a fit of crowing by roosters at the sanctuary as an omen of a Theban vic- tory at Leuktra. Compare also Julius Obsequens, Prodigia 5o (110) ("L. Crasso Q. Scaevola coss [that is, 95 B.C.] . . . Lebadiae Eutychides in templům Iovis Trophonii degressus tabulam aeneam extulit, in qua scripta erant quae ad res Romanas pertinerent": one thinks of the Sybilline books).

If Xouthos's excursion to consult Trophonios is a reflection of a real situation, then it would indeed appear that the oracle was timed to function at the same season as Delphi. 83</page><page sequence="86">TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA) things out almost at will, perhaps depending on the number of consultants waiting. This was not a feature restricted to the later stages of antiquity: see Appendix 1. 4) Hierarchy The evidence is late, but there are references to priests (both of Trophonios and Zeus Trophonios), a mantis to examine the entrails of the sacrifices, and, of course, the two boys who acted as ministers to consultants, the so-called Herm ai. The func- tions of the priests and the length of their tenure are nowhere detailed, except that they were the ones who questioned the consultant on his return and, presumably, transformed his disjointed utterances into a sensible response. In addition to these people, there would have been others actually to operate the oracle, and others - not necessarily part of the hierarchy - who went down to consult Trophonios on behalf of the less hardy1. 5) Other deities It is not unusual for large sanctuaries to contain secondary ones within them. In the a'aoç itself, there was, of course, the temple of Herky na, who was part of the original oracular cult complex; there was the so-called ßoßpog of Agamedes, representing the other cult complex of which Trophonios was a member. The pit itself was, as I have suggested, the original oracular chasm. Also within the grove were sanctuaries of Demeter Europe (not unknown within the region), of Zeus Hyetios, and the tomb of Arkesílaos (see above), which did not receive worship in Pausanias' time, but may have played a larger rôle in the earlier disposition of the sanctuary. There were also - but we do not know where they were sited, or how many they were, the so-called Trophoniadai. Presumably these were his sons, although Herkyna might per- haps qualify. The only son whose name we know is Alkandros, but his name is all we know about him. These children might be the same as the Lebadeian hotífioveç men- tioned by Krātiņos, which would give them a high pedigree. They, and others in the sanctuary, may be illustrated on a hellenistic relief from Lebadeia2. 1 Priests of Trophonios: Philostratos, Vita Apollonii 4.24; 8.19; Pausanias 9.39.7, 8, and 13.

Pausanias notes that the images of Trophonios and Herkyna in the grotto at the springs of the river resembled Asklepios and Hygeia, and that the cult image by Praxiteles was like Asklepios too. One can readily imagine how this happened: as there was no canonical model on which to base an image of Trophonios, Praxiteles, when commissioned to make one, would have chosen the god whom he most resembled: a god associated with snakes and accompanied by a female deity might easily have led him to select Asklepios as the model. I do not think there is a more complicated reason: there is no evidence that Trophonios was in any way involved with healing2. For Trophonios and Zeus, see Appendix 2. 6) The Trophoneia Evidence for this agon comes from two distinct periods, first from about the mid- dle to the about the end of the second century B.C., and second, from the second century A.D. or earlier to about the middle of the third century A.D. The first appearance of the Trophoneia coincides with a lapse in the celebration of the Basileia, which would have stopped at the dissolution of the koinon in 171 B.C.3. Its resump- tion would coincide roughly with a possible revival of the cult in the second half of the first century, reflected also in the tradition of Apollonios's visits to Lebadeia. From the first period two inscriptions refer to victories in boxing, wrestling, and the pankration4. From the second period inscriptions refer to victories by heralds and a Pythie auletes: in an inscription of the mid-third century A.D., the agon is called Trophoneia Olympia5. cannot determine what it is). The relief of the hellenistic period or later ( CCCA 2.131.432) depicts a number of characters, some of whom at least must be associated with Trophonios. See Volume 2.129-130 for a description and discussion. 1 Pausanias 9.39.4. 2 Pausanias 9.39.3-4. Trophonios and healing: see above, Section 1. 3 See ZEUS (LEBADEIA). The inscription Feyel, CEB 79.2, which M. Feyel attributed to the Basileia and dated in the first century B.C., has now been shown by D. Knoepfler, Comptes et inventaires dans la cité grecque (Neuchatel/Geneva 1988) 263-294 (SEG 38.380) to belong to the first or second century A.D. and to be concerned with the Pamboiotia. See ADDENDA: ATHENA (KORONEIA). 4 Wrestling and pankration: ¡Del 1957 = Hesperia 4 (1935) 81.38 (ca. 150/130); boxing: IG 7.47 (? 196-86). The inscription Hesperia 15 (1946) 222.51, of the first century B.C., although restored [Tpo^cópila, could as easily have referred to the Basileia. Didymos, Schmidt 219F12, lists Basileia, Amphiaraia, the Delia at Delion, and Trophoneia at Lebadeia, which is fine, but not informative, except insofar as it suggests that both the Delia and Trophoneia were less important than the others. 5 First century A.D.: IG 2^.3158 (herald or encomiograph at Lebadeia) Second century A.D.: ADelt 25 (1970 [1971]) A.58.6 and 62.11; IDel 2152 (agon unspecified, but line 12 definitely refers to an agon by the banks of the Herkyna, and lines 3-4 may be restored similarly, while line 3 has been restored to read [fiárnoç 'Aorflaç ixfriúbeoç eïkov ¿^[úpa]); a reference in Pollux 1.37.

In Plutarch, De Dęfectu Oraculorum 38 (431 C-D), Lamprias claims that he and his colleagues were terribly busy Sta tò navreiav eivou, koìì Ovai av. It is idle to speculate about the nature of these rites beyond the fact that they were, at least in Plutarch's time, celebrated at the same time as the oracle was operating, and could have been connected with the Trophoneia. 7) Other Activities A few manumission decrees survive sworn before Trophonios and Zeus Basileus, but these are limited to a brief period in the second century B.C. See Appendix 2. One of the latest documents concerning the cult is the inscription IG 7.3426 at Chaironeia on the base of a statue of one Flavia Lanica, who had been archpriestess for life of the koinon of Boiotoi of Itonia Athena and the koinon of the Phokian ethnos, and the 'Ofióvoia tô&gt;v 'EKkývuv rapa rą Tpo^œviy, and hieraphoros of Isis, and priestess for life of Isis Aposeirias. Her son, Gn. Curtius Dexippos, who set up the statue, was curator rei publicae at Chaironeia, archpriest for life of the Sebastoi, and a Boiotarch too. This is the only reference to an Homonoia of the Hellenes at the Trophonion. Could there have been some rivalry between the Homonoia of the Hellenes at Plataia - under Athenian influence at the time - and the "Boiotoi"? Flavia Lanica herself turns up in an inscription from Elateia1 . See also SACRED CITY (LEBADEIA). ♦ Appendix 1: IG 7.3055 The stone is lost. The text depends entirely on copies made by Leake and Pococke. In IG 7, Ditten- berger produced a reconstruction based on the two transcriptions, and another was made by C. Vatin, in Fr. Salviat &amp; CI. Vatin, Inscriptions de Grèce centrale (Paris 1971) 81-94. The version given below is based on the latter, but differs from it slightly. What the stone gives us is a regulation of the polis in two parts, first that those who descend to Trophonios are to pay a fee of ten drachmas and ten eilytai^, and second, that any who have given more than that amount are to have their names inscribed on the stele. There then follow the names of those who descended, the first being Amyntas son of Perdikkas, note). 1 IG 9.1.147. For another third century Boiotarch, see IG 9.1.218 and Praktika 1909 (1910) 130 (Amphikleia). D. Knoepfler, Chiron 22 (1992) 497.174, referring to IG 7.3426, suggests that the deities are to be grouped thus: on the one hand, Athena Itonia goddess of the Boiotians and Phokians, on the other Trophonios and Homonoia. The gods especially worshipped at the Phokikon (Pausanias 10.5.2) were Zeus, Hera, and Athena, and it seems that there was, during the Imperial period, a more or less indiscriminate blending of national deities: Zeus Basileus and Hera Henioche/Basilis were worshipped at Lebadeia, and Athena was the ethnic goddess of the Phokians as she was of the Boiotians. 2 C. Vatin, p. 94, equates the eiXvraç with TeXavóç, a cash payment rather than an offering in kind. For the TreXavóç as a cash payment, see P.

Appendix 2 : Trophonios and Zeus There is no consistency, especially on the part of local as opposed to outside authorities. The con- nection, confusion, and occasional identification can only have been caused by the physical collocation of the sanctuaries of Trophonios and Zeus Basileus towards the end of the third century B.C. Trophonios alone: possibly ADelt 3 (1917) 421 note 2.4 (K]a^£i&lt;roôórco lapà Tpi&lt;/&gt;&lt;jûpei[ù): a manumitted slave, perhaps of the one, but perhaps also of both; for the vowels et &lt; t, t&lt;e, see W.

The earliest inscription ( IG 7.2733) records a dedication by Kriton and Theios- dotos roî Ai TÒxopeì. The epithet Oporeus is associated with òirúpa, the (latter part of) summer, and the god identified as guardian of fruitfulness2. It is a suitable one for Zeus, the bringer of rain and fertility to farmers, and eminently appropriate for archaic Akraiphia, a large part of whose prosperity must have depended on farming in the bay of Akraiphia, which was walled off from the Kopais by a dam3. Two inscriptions ~ at least one of which is a boundary stone -record the exist- ence of a sanctuary of Zeus Keraios, and in a decree of Haliartos of the eighth decade of the third century B.C. reference is made to a temenos of Zeus Karaios and Athena Itonia, which was probably in Akraiphia4.

The cult of Zeus Karaios/Keraios in particular is found in several Boiotian poleis. It is possible that there was a temenos of one or both of these gods in each of these places, and that they served as the training grounds for the military contingents which competed every year at the Pamboiotia. Evidence for Zeus with the epithet Soter appears at Akraiphia about the middle of the second century B.C., and continues to be attested until the second half of the first century A.D. The evidence for Zeus Soter is as follows: SEG 15.332, dated by M. Feyel in the middle of the second century B.C., is on a cylindrical altar (with boukrania) and reads á xóXiç ' Aicpr¡&lt;l&gt;iéo)p arò tûp [ye]i&gt;oßev(j)v Tspiaáuiv ļ xPei/tť*TÚ5,'&gt; àyoivoOsríouToç MsyaKXsioç râ&gt; KaXXi/cXeÍoç ¡ Au Scorêpt àvéOeinev1 . As M. Feyel remarked, this attests not only the existence of the agon Soteria (see below), but also a healthy financial situation. The epithet Soter might also reflect the same happy state of affairs, for its institution could have com- memorated some fortunate occurrence. A hint is provided by the inscription SEG 15.331, dated by Feyel 171-167 B.C., and incised on a statue base: á xóXiç 'AKpii&lt;f&gt;isío3P àpéOeiKS HóttXíop ' KoppřjÁiop Asvkíw oviòu Kévrókov ļ tòp avaavrâç ao)Tsîpa kt¡ svep ļ yérap tvç Oivç. It is interesting to note the survival of the dialect here, as at Thespiai, for some years beyond the dissolution of the koinon. Lentulus was in Boiotia in 171 B.C., having been sent there by the Senate with 300 soldiers.2. Feyel suggested that Lentulus was honoured by the town of Akraiphia for having protected it either against his fellow Romans, or against the designs of its own neighbours. It is not unlikely that the local Soteria were established to celebrate the deliverance for which Lentulus was responsible. The agon was trieteric, with thymelic/dramatic and athletic competitions, to judge from the parts of two victors' lists which survive.

The sanctuary stood in the agora, and included a cult image and at least one altar. It was here that important documents were posted3. In the first century A.D., when times were hard, and nobody could be found to carry the burdens of the office, the eponymous archonship was held by Zeus Soter for at least three successive years4.

Lykouri-Tolia, ADelt 41 (1986 [1991]) A. 401-424, identifies Zeus Meilichios on a fragment of a marble lekane (dated in the middle of the fourth century B.C.) found at the akropolis of Anthedon. The surviving section depicts a seated female holding a sceptre in her right hand, and ears of corn and a poppy head in her left. To her right, facing right, is a snake (which the author takes to be Zeus Meilichios, the female being Demeter Eleusinia, the object having come probably from a sanctuary of Demeter and Kore on the akropolis). Above the two figures, on the rim of the vessel, are some let- ters, transcribed by the author as '0NOlEN. To judge from the illustration, the traces of the first let- ter might belong to an alpha or lambda, the iota seems to be separated from the letters preceding and following, the epsilon is not certain, while the final letter might have been either a nu, as transcribed, or a mu. I can say nothing intelligent about the inscription. As for the snake, it might indeed represent Zeus Meilichios; on the other hand, it could be connected with Triptolemos, who was not unknown to Boiotian artists: compare the red-figure skyphos (end of the fifth century B.C.) in Berlin, showing Triptolemos between Demeter and Kore: L1MCAA (Zurich and Munich 1988) 874.372. 96</page><page sequence="99">ZEUS (ANTHEDON) Two inscriptions of the second century B.C. deal with an association devoted to Zeus Karaios and Anthas.

There are at least two points of interest about these documents. The first has to do with their connection with the local gymnasion. This calls to mind the temenos of Athena Itonia and Zeus Karaios at Akraiphia, and suggests that, in the time of the hellenistic koinon at least, several Boiotian poleis had such a place for the purpose of training their contingents in the federal army, such training to be controlled in the competitions at the annual Pamboiotia. The documents from Anthedon post-date the dissolution of the koinon, and accordingly, Zeus Keraios is transformed into a patron of the gymnasion. It is not surprising to find a local hero ~ in this case the eponym Anthas ~ also connected with the gymnasion: compare the precinct of Akademos out- side the walls of Athens, and the Iolaeion outside the walls of Thebes3. The other interesting thing about these two documents is that they prove that the Boiotians called the god Karaios or Keraios without discrimination, and that the actual sound is neither [a] nor [e], but a less determinate [a], so that not only "Karaios" and "Keraios" are to be considered as equivalents, but also "Akraios". From the second and third centuries A.D. comes a list of apxoPTUP OTs4&gt;av[i)4&gt;óp&lt;jìP ], among whom Zeus (no epithet) figures five times4. This is a sign of financial stringency, as at Akraiphia in the first century A.D. It can also be assumed that here, as at Akraiphia, this Zeus was based in the agora.

Two attempts have been made to transpose it, one to just before (instead of just after) the sentence about Pentheus and Oidipous, the other to 9.2.51.

Agave and Kadmos, followed by Kadmos, go to the mountain, where Kadmos sacrifices to Zeus and the Hadryades svicepay icapà (97) in Zeus' s grove (95-102). The question of whether Nonnos is based on fact or fancy is another thing altogether. However, when all is said and done, there is no good reason why there should not have been some sanctuary - an altar would have sufficed - of Zeus on the top of Mount Kithairon3. The summit of Mount Kithairon was of course the site of the holocaust which ended the Daidala (Pausanias 9.3.7): see HERA (PLATAIA). 1 See Hitzig's apparatus and C. N. Edmonson, Hermes 92 (1964) 502-505. Edmonson rejects the idea of a gloss because it is not a gloss on the text (but see below), and because the phrasing is "character- istic of Pausanias" (if only one could be so certain what was "characteristic", or what, indeed, was "Pausanias" in any given passage). Edmonson suggests a transposition to 9.2.5 to fill a gap as follows: ov Troppo) òè à irò rov koivov t&amp;v 'EXkrjvup Atóç toriv 'E XevOepíov ßcofiög &lt; Kal ayaXfio r earrjice ò'èmavOa Kal áyaXfxa KiOaipóòvoç, &gt; lo òè Kídatpòjp rò opoç Atòç ìepòv KiOaipwvíov èarív *1 rovrov fièv òri xorXicoD, roD Atòç òè TÓv re ßoüßov Kal rò àyáXfJLa èiroírjaap Xsvkov Xídov. This version is accepted in the Teubner edition of M. H. Rocha-Pereira. Aside from the fact that it brings in a statue of Kithairon which is otherwise unattested, the conjec- ture does not take account of kolpov (Hitzig had emended to rov koipov rûv 'EXkrjpojv &lt; ļivrjļiarog &gt; on the basis of "EWqai ļirijļia koivóv just before), or of the fact that the altar belonged not only to Zeus Eleutherios but also to the Homonoia of the Hellenes (BCH 99 [1975] 51-75, but naturally Edmonson knew nothing about this). The passage is incorrigible (for a half-hearted attempt to do something with it, see Volume 2.115 and notes 4-5). The term koivòv r&amp;v 'EXkrjvuv is applied to the body sponsoring the Eleutheria in an inscription of about 20 B.C. (L.

At Koroneia Zeus went by the epithets Laphystios and probably Karaios/ Akraios; at Lebadeia he was called Basileus. On the mountain itself he bore three epithets: Laphystios (descriptive of his nature), Akraios/Karaios (descriptive of 1 For full bibliography, see Volume 1.117. 2 Laphystion in the territory of Orchomenos: so one can deduce from the legends which connect the house of Athamas with the Zeus of the mountain.

See ZEUS (LAPHYSTIOS). 104</page><page sequence="107">ZEUS (KORONEIA) his connection with mountain tops), and Basileus (descriptive of his polpa, his sphere of influence)1. Of these epithets, that which was least bound to a specific place was Karaios/Akraios, and it is under this epithet that Zeus was most widely worshipped in Boiotia, as one of the two gods of the Boiotian ethnos, the other being Athena Itonia2. The god is attested at Koroneia from the middle of the sixth century B.C., on the mountain probably from the second half of the fifth century, at Lebadeia from the fourth century. Elsewhere, the earliest known theophoric name derived from Karaios is dated at the beginning of the fifth century3, while the thunderbolt of Zeus appears on coins of Lebadeia and Mykalessos dated to the period 387-364 B.C.4 * In the temple of Athena Itonia, Pausanias saw bronze cult images of Athena Itonia and Zeus, created by Agorakritos, a disciple of Pheidias (9.34.1). According to Strabo, the god whose image stood beside Athena was Hades5. If, as is likely, the two authors are referring to the same pair of images, then this Zeus ought to have been of the "chthonic" variety. An earlier, non-anthropomorphic, version of him can be seen in the snake on a pedestal - obviously representing a cult image ~ towards whom and Athena a sacrificial procession is directed, on the mid-sixth century Boiotian black- figure lekanis B80 in the British Museum. Another vase from Boiotia, dated to about the same period, depicts the warrior Athena addressing Hermes. All along both sides of her body or robe are the gaping heads of serpents. These too, it has been sug- gested, may refer to this Zeus6. See ATHENA (KORONEIA). Athena Itonia and Zeus Karaios shared a temenos at Akraiphia: see ZEUS (AKRAIPHIA), and I think it is probable that Zeus bore the same or a related epithet at Koroneia, where he shared not only the sanctuary but the status of pan-Boiotian ethnic god. It is probably this god who appears on the Boiotian coins listed above7. The inscription Schwyzer, DGE 503a, of around 175-165 BC, is one of a series of manumission decrees sworn before Herakles Charops8.

The editor of the CVA volume, A. Waiblinger, proposes a connection with Zeus Meilichios. 7 The alleged hierosylia committed by Zeuxippos (Polybios 22.4.7) ~ stripping the silver plating off the table of Zeus - could have happened at Koroneia or Lebadeia, where there were temples, rather than at Plataia, where there was probably only an altar. ° On these inscriptions and their dating see Volume 2.7 note 3. 105</page><page sequence="108">ZEUS (KORONEIA) involved, Akraìa and Panamia: both may be official Boiotian festivals, since they seem to include a procession along rctv òòòv ràv Boiwnaí'1 . The Panamia clearly took place during the month of Panamos, and might therefore be none other than the Basileia, which were celebrated during that month2. The Basileia honoured Zeus Basileus. I would suggest that the Akraia also honoured Zeus, specifically the Zeus at Koroneia. The name "Akraia" would then be a festival of Zeus Akraios, which is the name of the Zeus on the top of Mount Pelion3, who shared his temenos with an underground hero, Chiron, in much the same way as the Zeus Laphystios on Mount Laphystion above Koroneia shared his temenos with Herakles Charops: see HERAKLES (KORONEIA). The epithets Akraios, Karaios, and Keraios, are varia- tions of the same name: see ZEUS (ANTHEDON). As for the Akraia, we know nothing about the ritual: there may have been a mountain-top ceremony as at Mount Pelion, in which case it would have happened in mid-summer, or it may have been part of the celebrations surrounding the Pamboiotia: see AKRAIA (KORONEIA). The epithet Enaisimos4 might be interpreted in one of two ways, either of which would be appropriate to Zeus as he was worshipped at the Itoneion: (a) as an equi- valent to fieiXíxioç, or (b) as a corruption of ëpaifioç5, referring in this case to his close relationship in the cult to Athena. The first is more likely, although I would not unhesitatingly reject the second. The joint temenos of Zeus Laphystios and Herakles Charops was not, apparently, on the mountain top, and is not to be confused with the altar used as a point of reference to fix the boundary in SEG 23.2976. That it was within Koroneian territory is clear from one of the manumission decrees sworn before Herakles Charops, whose sanctuary was not only above the temenos of Zeus Laphystios, but clearly belonged to Koroneia7. 1 Perhaps a processional route between the Alalkomeneion, at the eastern edge of the x^pa of Koroneia, and the Itoneion, just outside the city walls, or one leading from the city to the altar of Zeus on the top of Mount Laphystion between the territories of Koroneia and Lebadeia. See ZEUS (LAPHYSTION) for a suggestion to restore the epithet Akraios rather than Laphystios on the inscrip- tion SEG 23.297, which refers to this altar. 2 See ZEUS (LEBADEIA).

Laphystios Inscription SEG 23.297 Literature (Aristophanes, Birds 568-569) Pausarias 1.24.2; 9.34.5 Just twenty stades from Koroneia was Mount Laphystion and the temenos of Zeus Laphystios (with a stone cult image). Above it was Herakles Charops: there, according to Boiotian tradition, Herakles had come back up with the hound of Hades. So says Pausanias (9.34.5). From this we can determine two things: first, the temenos of Zeus Laphystios was not on the mountain top, but lower down than the sanctuary of Herakles Charops. Second, the latter must have included a hole or cave which could have given rise to the story about the hound of Hades. Similar collocations of Zeus and a hero are found elsewhere: on the top of Mount Hymettos, Zeus and a hero or Herakles were worshipped near each other1 ; on Mount Lykaion, Zeus was worshipped near the mountain top, Pan at a grotto2. Per- haps too on Mount Geraneia near Megara3, at Oros on Aigina4, on Mount Oche on Euboia5. There are no doubt others which would repay closer examination6. However, the most interesting parallel for us is the sanctuary of Zeus Akraios/ Aktaios on Mount Pelion, traces of which may have been found7.

It was at Halos that there was a sanctuary of Zeus Laphystios, where, according to Herodotos (7.197), Athamas son of Aiolos plotted with Ino to kill Phrixos, as a result of which the eldest male member of the family was barred from the council chamber on pain of death. This fate had befallen the descendants of Kytissoros son of Phrixos, who had returned from Kolchis and saved Athamas from being sacrificed. Xerxes - to whom the story was told - heard this when he had come near the â'&lt;roç, and thereupon he kept himself and his army away from it, tûv ts 'A0á/*a vroç àicoyóvuv rf¡v oíkít¡v bpoiwę Kai tò réfisvoç easßsro. On Mount Laphystion in Boiotia we appear to have a combination of the two Thessalian sanctuaries: a joint temenos of Zeus and a hero (in a cave), as on Mount Pelion, and the story of Athamas and Zeus Laphystios as at Halos2. It is also possible that Zeus was worshipped on Mount Laphystion as Akraios, and that he had an altar on top of the mountain distinct from the temenos he shared with Herakles. The inscription which determines the boundary between Lebadeia and Koroneia places an altar of Zeus at the top of the mountain. It is possible to restore the god's epithet as Akraios, rather than Laphystios, as earlier editors have done3. See AKRAIA, ZEUS (KORONEIA). For the possibility that Aristophanes, Birds 568-569, refers to Zeus Basileus on Mount Laphystion, see ZEUS (LEBADEIA). Logic suggests that the cult of Zeus Laphystios came down to southwest Boiotia from Thessaly; on the other hand, the epithet Laphystios must have travelled in the opposite direction, because it is attached to a mountain which is one of three or pos- sibly four - the others being Thourion, Ptoion, and possibly Phikion ~ on the edges of the Kopais, which all bear frightening, or at least anti-social, names. 1 A. Philippson - E. Kirsten, Die Griechischen Landschaften 1.1 (Frankfurt/Main 1950) sites nos. 147 (sanctuary of Zeus), 134 (Iolkos), 112 (Thebes), 100 (sanctuary at Iton), 111 (Halos). 2 It is impossible to tell whether oIkíi¡¡&gt; in Herodotos 9.197 means "family" or "house". Either is pos- sible; if the latter, then we might imagine a combination similar to that at Laphystion and Pelion, namely a temenos of Zeus which included a structure devoted to another. 3 SEG 23.297 (text as established by P.

If my suggestion for the last line is correct, the boundary line would have run straight up the hill from the warm springs in the direction of the altar of Zeus Akraios at the top of the mountain. 108</page><page sequence="111">ZEUS (LEBADEIA) ZEUS (LEBADEIA) Epithets: Basileus (Boulaios) Hyetios Milichios Trophonios Agon: Basileia Site1 AAA 2 (1969) 230 note l2 ADelt 1 (1915) n«p. 423; 22 (1967 [1968]) B.1.244 Inscriptions ADelt 2 (1916) 218.A0'; 3 (1917) 421 note 2.2 &amp; 2.5; 26 (1971 [1973]) A.34-40 AM 22 (1897) 179ff.

I take this pas- sage to be a reference to the same incident; moreover, I take it as evidence that Zeus on Laphystion was called Basileus just as he was at Lebadeia2. The epithet "Basileus" used in formal cult is more widely attested in the Aegean and Ionia than in Greece proper, apart from Boiotia3. The use of the epithet in Boiotia may have been a result of the influence of Hesiod, who is the first to refer to Zeus as king of gods and men4, and through him could have originated in Asia Minor. The epithet is reflected also in coins of Lebadeia and Mykalessos, from the period of the Peace of Antalkidas, which bear a thunderbolt on their reverse5. How the epithet came to be attached specifically to Boiotia should become clear from what follows. 2) Zeus Basileus and the Basileia Before the battle of Leuktra, a number of omens favourable to the Thebans and their allies were, apparently, fabricated by Epameinondas. Among them6, according to Diodoros of Sicily 15.53, was an injunction from Trophonios: irpoaéra^sv ó Oeòç avTÓiç, ot ap sv AsÓKTpoiç vinrjowoip, àyûva riOévai Ail BaaiXeî OTeýavírqť à&lt;f&gt;'ov òri B oioìTÓi Totvrriv toiovoip tt)v ravrjyvpiv èv Asß aòsíçp. One may have doubts about the veracity of the oracular response, but there is independent evidence that an agon called Basileia was being celebrated during the fourth century B.C.

Obviously I do not agree with H. Schwabl, RE Supplement 15 (1978) sv "Zeus" (Nachträge) 1446, who takes Birds 568 as referring to a general sacrifice to Zeus, rather than to a specific cult. I wonder what it was that prompted the dedication on the Athenian akropolis of a group depicting Phrixos watching the sacrificial burning of the thighs of the ram which had brought him to Kolchis: Paus ani as 1.24.2. 3 H.

Lebadeia is not mentioned, but the absence of the name may mean only that there were no other agons called Basileia at that time: in any case any Boiotian would presumably have known which Basileia were in question2. Another inscription of about the middle of the fourth century B.C. from Delphi has been restored as referring to a victory at the Basileia, a probable but not certain suggestion3. It is easy to guess why the Boiotians - that is to say, the Thebans ~ chose to hold this agon at Lebadeia rather than either nearer the battlefield of Leuktra or at the Itonion. I take it that one purpose of staging an agon to celebrate the victory over Sparta was to show the world what Thebes had done. For this purpose, the battlefield itself was less suitable than Lebadeia, as well as being in the xúp&lt;* °f Thespiai and adjoining that of Plataia, both of which were unfriendly to Thebes. Lebadeia, on the other hand, was not only along the main east-west land route to and from Delphi, but was also fairly well-known to non-Boiotians as the site of the oracle of Trophonios. This might explain why Lebadeia was chosen over the nearby Itonion. Another reason may have been to "show the flag", a Theban one in this case, in the face of Orchomenos, a hostile but for the time being powerless defector from the Boiotian line. Although inside Boiotia the most popular epithet of the pan-Boiotian Zeus was Karaios or a variation of it, outside Boiotia it was Zeus Basileus who represented the Boiotoi4. Presumably this was because of the renown of the Basileia, so it can be said that the original intention of those who organized the sanctuary and the agon was real- ized. The sanctuary of Zeus Basileus is located on the hill now called Profitis Elias, just where one would expect it to be from reading Pausanias5.

It is suggested that the two statues date from before 335 B.C., and were re- erected late in the fourth century on the one base. This seems reasonable. 2 Compare later attempts to make certain: IG 7.1711 (second century B.C.?), BacrtXeta [r]à [èv ¡ A]flpç([Í£tçí]; IG 9.2.614a (probably first century B.C., see below), ó irap"EpKvli&gt;' v]çi BaoiXrjuoç (sc. oréfatvoç); IMagn. 116.132a (ca. beginning of the first century B.C.), [rà BJaatXcta | [r]à è/t Bouirróiç. 3 SEG 23.332.

One might add shortage of money to the list of causes. Most of what we know about this temple comes from a collection of inscriptions dealing with the letting of contracts for the building of its various parts4. G. Roux has estimated that, given the sequence in which Greek architects are thought to have worked, the building was fairly well advanced when these contracts were drawn up5.

A federal archon Andronikós occurs on IG 7,214 at Aigosthena, at about 220 B.C.7. It would seem, therefore, that building was already well under way by the late 220's, and that the commonly accepted date of 175-171 B.C. for the dos- sier is to be abandoned8. R. Etienne and D.

They and P. Roesch differ from Holleaux in taking Kallikleides to have been an official representative of the koinon. I have published a different interpretation, in which both questions and responses are shown to be closely linked to each other1. The gist is that at about the same time, Akraiphia and Lebadeia began to canvass support for major projects, the re-organization of the Ptoia and the construction of a temple for Zeus Basileus, respectively. In order to settle the matter of which project should be given priority by the koinon, it was decided - for reasons of tact as much as anything else - to turn the problem over to a neutral arbiter, Trophonios, who was, furthermore, to be approached by a Lokrian from Opous rather than a Boiotian2. The solution brought back by Kallikleidas was to grant neither party priority, or presumably, funding, but to allow each the right to canvass for funds and, probably, share the amount col- lected. The agon, Ptoia, was furthermore accorded the status of àyiop iepóç, while whoever undertook to direct the construction of the temple of Zeus was to be awarded a crown. On this reading, construction could very well have begun some time before the federal government took a hand3. Shortage of funds would have led to the canvass, the disappointing results of which would have led ultimately to the assumption of the project by the koinon. The koinon set up a college of Naopoioi on the model of the Delphic body4. Even they, however, could not complete the task. Since their work was never completed, the group was never formally dissolved, and after the dissolu- tion of the koinon5, it remained as virtually the only legally constituted pan-Boiotian organism available to direct any undertaking involving the Boiotian eOvoç. The col- lege was obviously self-perpetuating, so that there was never any dearth of members. It was they, therefore, who organized both the Basileia and the Pamboiotia, the latter well into the first century A.D. or even later6. We know a certain amount about the actual cult of Zeus Basileus. Priests are referred to in manumission decrees sworn before Trophonios and Zeus Basileus, and one must assume that at least one of these was priest of Zeus Basileus7. Two statue bases are inscribed with dedications by one Menandios, who had been priest for a pentaeteris. One of the two statues is dedicated to Zeus Basileus and the polis, and was probably of Menandros himself; the other was of his wife, a priestess, and is 1 AJPhil 105 (1984) 258-267 = SEG 34.352 = Chiron 22 (1992) 479.128. 2 The choice of Trophonios rather than Apollo Ptoios suggests that the koinon, being an interested party, was reluctant to use its official oracular mouthpiece. They could have turned to Delphi, but did not, perhaps because Delphi had already pronounced on the Ptoia (/G 7.4135). 3 Perhaps even early in the third century? see J. A.

I do not know if the fact that the two offices were held by man and wife is especially significant2. He served for a pentaeteris, which could have some bearing on the frequency of the Basileia at the time (see below). The polis of Lebadeia as the joint recipient of both statues must be taken as the official body operating the cult. The polis also had a hand with the naopoioi and the koinon in directing the agon. So much can be deduced from the fact that, on the death of an agonothete-elect, a Thespian, that polis, having appointed his son as successor, sent the information to the polis of Lebadeia3. The Basileia included not only an agon but also a religious element (Ovaia/ 1), referred to in the apologia of the agonothete Xenarchos4. Plutarch, in Amatoriae Narrationes 1 (77 IF) alludes to a Kavr¡&lt;1&gt;opía for Zeus Basileus. I do not think that the Basileia were still being celebrated in Plutarch's day (see below). Agonothetes of the Basileia were in the habit of dedicating, with some of the income from the agon, a phiale to Zeus Basileus. We have a reference to one such act, and part of an inventory of these vessels5. After Plutarch - and it must be remembered that his reference is embedded in a story - the only certain sign of cult activity involving Zeus Basileus is the sacrifice made jointly to him, Kronos, and Hera Henioche by the intending consultant of Trophonios (Pausanias 9.34.5). Presumably, however, something went on in the temple containing the cult images of the three (9.39.4). For the relationship between Zeus Basileus and Trophonios, see TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA), Appendix 2.

A complication arises with inscriptions of the third century B.C., when there is evidence for the celebration of Basileia in honour of living monarchs in Egypt, Macedonia, Asia, and perhaps in Euboia3. But in these cases the description of the agon is expanded to include its locale: indeed, in one case -- IG 22.3779 (of the middle of the third century B.C. - three agons called Basileia are listed, one in Macedonia, another at Alexandria, the third undefined. The last is in all likelihood the Lebadeian agon4. Most of the evidence for the Basileia deals with gymnic or hippie competitions5, but there is also evidence for the existence of at least a small musical component6. The agon was well known and attracted competitors from all parts. Diodoros's claim that it was established as an agon stephanites may be an exaggeration, but it was certainly true by the third century B.C.7. The evidence for the celebration of the Basileia falls into four chronological groups: first, in the fourth century B.C., between the battles of Leuktra and Chaironeia8; second, from 281/280 to ca. 172, that is, most of the lifetime of the hel- lenistic koinon9; third, in the second half of the second century B.C. and early in the first10; fourth, after the Mithridatic War up to the middle of the first century B.C.11. 1 SEG 25.90; IG 7.1711; IG 9.2.614a; IMagn. 116.132a. 2 Although IG 7.530 could be about the Eleutheria.

When the agon was revived in the third century B.C., it was by the hellenistic koinon1. The apparent revival of the Basileia in the second half of the second century B.C. is paralleled by revivals of the Ptoia and Mouseia2; the agonistic revival in Boiotia which followed the Third Mithridatic War was much more widespread, but not of long duration except in a few cases3. The final revivals were organized under the auspices of the new Boiotian koinon, which existed solely for cultural purposes. The Basileia were directed jointly by the college of naopoioi and the polis of Lebadeia. By a happy accident, parts of two agonothetes' apologiai have survived from the last period4. The expenses of the agon were officially borne by the member towns, whose contributions were supplemented by income from the rental of the property used for the agon; indeed, there is one example of the agonothete's having paid the entire cost himself5. Two inscriptions, one of the first century A.D. (IG 2^.3158), the other of the first or second A.D. ( IDelos 2552), refer to victories "at Lebadeia". Since the only agon at Lebadeia named on imperial inscriptions is the Trophoneia, I should think that these belonged there. See TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA). For the inscriptions IG 7.1764 and 2871, which M. Feyel attributed, not to the Erotideia and Pam- boiotia respectively but to the Basileia, see ATHENA (KORONEIA) (Volume 1.125-126: both belong to the Pamboiotia), and Chiron 22 (1992) 498.176. 1 Perhaps the Athenian inscription SEG 25.90 refers to this revival. 2 See APOLLO (PTOION), MUSES (THESPIAI). The Erotideia may have begun at this time too: see EROS (THESPIAI). 3 See A. G. Gossage, BSA 70 (1975) 115-134, especially the chart on pg. 116. To this group belongs the inscription published by V.

The victors' list of side A ends with a victory by a chariot entered by King Ptolemy Philopator. He was identified by M. Holleaux as either Ptolemy IX Neos Philopator (121-116 B.C.) or Ptolemy XII Neos Dionysos Philopator or Philadelphos (ca. 80 B.C.): see NChoix 22. A. G. Gossage, BSA 75 (1970) 124 accepts Ptolemy XII. L. Moretti, IAG pp. 105-106, had previously opted for Ptolemy XII (80-51 B.C.). W. Peremans and E. Van't Dack, Prosopographica Ptolemaica 6 (Louvain 1968) also identify the Ptolemy at Lebadeia (their no. 17235) with Ptolemy XII (no. 14558: Neos Dionysos Philopator Philadelphos = Auletes [reigned June/ July 80 to September 58 and April 55 to Febru- ary/March 51 B.C.]. R. Étienne and D. Knoepfler, BCH Supplément 3 (1976) 246-249, who also make use of the prosopography of Hyettos and the presence of Larymna and Anthedon among the list of cities sending delegates, bring the date down to 58 or 57 B.C. This is some twenty years later than Gossage' s dating, based on prosopographical grounds. Étienne and Knoepfler, it should be noted, suppose that Ptolemy was present at Lebadeia at the time, which is not necessary: see Bull, épigr. 77.218. However, an earlier date within Ptolemy XII's reign is possible.

IG 7.3097 (and 3096) were dedicated by a man who had been priest of Zeus Basileus for a pentaeteris, but this is not conclusive1. At all events, the agon was celebrated during the Boiotian month Panamos2. During the interval between the second and third periods of the Basileia, the polis of Lebadeia produced its own agon, the Trophoneia, which were resumed later under the Empire after the Basileia had ceased: see TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA). I would assume that, given the increasingly hard times in Boiotia, the koinon was no longer able to maintain two pan-Boiotian agons, and concentrated its resources on the Pamboiotia. It is interesting to note that the Pamboiotia of the Roman era resembled more closely a standard athletic and hippie agon than the hellenistic version, which had a relatively serious military purpose: see Volume 1.124-126. 3) (Zeus Boulaios) This depends on Dodwell's reading Zsvç BovXcâoç of an inscription which seems to have been published later as IG 7.3108, EvßoiiXov. 4) Zeus Hyetios In the sanctuary of Trophonios there was Zsvç 'Tenoç èv vraíOpq (Pausanias 9.39.4). See TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA). chos was obliged (side C) to fine Platon son of Aristokrātes of Thebes, who preceded him in the office: Platon' s heirs avoided having to pay by finally submitting Platon' s apologia. Types of income (all from IG 7.3078 +): tax from poleis (A.23-24, waived); donations from poleis (C. 66-67); rental of lands on which the competitions were held (A.21-22, 31-36, C. 66-67); personal contribution by agonothete (A. 24-28). The amount of money collected was 260 drachmai in bronze and 198 drachmai in Attic coinage (see the commentary in N Choix 22). Although this is considerably less than the amounts of money spent on the Sarapieia at Tanagra at roughly the same time - SEG 19.335: 1161 + , 1386+ and 1135+ drachmai for the second, third, and fourth years of the pentaeteris (RA [1966] 312-313) - it must be remembered that it does not include the ela&lt;jx&gt;pa from the poleis, which Xenarchos waived and presumably paid for out of his own resources. On the other hand, it may suggest that the Basileia were celebrated more frequently that the Sarapieia, perhaps annually or every other year. 1 See the preceding note for the possibility that the agon was celebrated more frequently. N. G. Pappadakis, who originally published SEG 3.367, had suggested that the Basileia were held annually: ADelt 8 (1923) 248. This was contested by P. Roussel, Bull.épigr. 39.369.

Picard, RHR 126 (1943) 100, suggests that the stones might have originated at the ancient cemetery of the town, with Zeus Meilichios being patron of cemeteries, as he was else- where (compare p. 118). It should be pointed out that the monuments, which were found built into what seems to have been a defensive wall thrown up hastily in the Byzantine era (fifth century or later), also included material concerning the temples of Zeus Basileus ( BCH 64/65 [1940/1941] 37.1.23), Meter Megale (40-48), Artemis (54-55), Apollo (55), the Emperors Trajan and Hadrian (55-58), and one or possibly two tombstones (58-59). In short, the materials used for the wall came from anywhere and everywhere within the limits of ancient Lebadeia. 2 BCH 64/65 (1940/1941) 50.11.16: KaXoicXtôaç | Ail MiXi|xw. 3 The others are BCH 64/65 (1940/1941) 49.11.17 (pyramidal cippus, omphalos above: 'Ep/xcûoç 'ApicrroicXta | A rļļion | MciXtxtu), 49.11.12 (similar, with phallos in relief below the inscription: I A rjļwv[iļ I MctXixv); 49.11.15 (similar, with hole on top and phallos in relief below the inscription: Morr[po] | &lt;f&gt;ávetç | MctXi|xtot).

If the thunderbolt on these coins, and on those of Lebadeia, has any meaning, it should refer to the Boiotian Zeus. The fact that Mykalessos was able to issue its own coinage in the fourth century suggests that the massacre of its inhabitants in 413 B.C.1 did not wipe the town out. This is confirmed at the cemetery of Rhitsona - probably belonging to Mykalessos - where there is no sign of any interruption between 424 and 338 B.C. * * * ZEUS (ORCHOMENOS) Epithets: ?Homoloios Karaios Laphystios Meilichios Soter Teleios ?Agon: Homoloia Inscriptions Chiron 6 (1976) 47.582 IGT Ai; 3169; 3196; 3197; 3206; 3208; 3217 Literature Aristodemos, FGrH 383F5b (Schol.

This is probably not a coincidence, for the Magnesian Mount Homole and the town Homoloion on its northern slopes abut on Perrhaibia. At Homoloion, inside the akropolis, and near an apsidal temple, were found fragments of the foot of a colossal clay statue, on the sandal of which was stamped a thunderbolt: this has been taken as a reference to Zeus Homoloios1. The cult probably came down to Boiotia2 from Thessaly, but it is not possible to say how widespread it was in Boiotia: the theophoric names could have been derived as easily from the month as from the epithet3. The evidence for Orchomenos, for example, is not at all straightforward. We have two victors' lists of a choral-dramatic agon called the Homoloia, and a fragmentary inscription which seems to be part of a federal tripod dedication to . . ]ohi&gt;, which has been restored as 'OpoXlwiv or [Aù 'O/ioXJojiv4. As I noted in Volume 1.143, it is not impossible that the agon Homoloia was named after the month rather than a deity. There are in any event an embarrass- ment of deities with similar epithets: not only Zeus Homoloios, but also Athena Homolois and Demeter Homoloia ~ see ATHENA and DEMETER (THEBES) - as well as the hero Homolôos5. A *Dionysos Homoloios has also been proposed, because it is clear from the content of the victors' lists that the agon Homoloia was an ultimate descendant of the agon of Dionysos following which the choregic monuments were dedicated6. The festival (èoprrj) Homoloia was the subject of a work by the historian Aiistodemos (second century B.C.)7. Aristodemos, although he wrote so much about Thebes that he was called 0tj/3oûoç, may have been an Alexandrian scholar8, and his 1 A. S.

And, since the only Homoloia we can place were those celebrated at Orchomenos, he may actually have been referring to this agon. Furthermore, the hero Homolôos - if he existed - might have been an Orchomenian too (see my comments in the notes on SEG 26.585 and 588). The Homoloia might have been held in his honour. The agon is described in the victors' lists as pefii¡TÓg, a term for which no satis- factory explanation has been given1. The expression does not seem to fit the normal usage of véfieiv and its derivatives2. There is another possibility, that it is a local usage. Here we can turn to a local author, Plutarch, for support. At Cato Minor 26. 1 (77 ID) he refers to rov . . . àvépriTov öxXov, that is, the multitude which does not have its share (of property or resources). His use of the term in this sense seems to be a hapax. If, then, àvéfirfToç means "lacking a share", then vep-qTÓç could mean "shar- ing", which would accurately describe an agon which shared the time, space, some of the competitors, perhaps even some of the competitions, and the administration of the Charitesia3. There is one other reference to Homoloia. It is on an inscription of the second century B.C. at Megara, in a list of victories by a boxer/pankratist: this particular vic- tory was in boxing4. Although no place is named, there is no reason a priori not to attribute it to Orchomenos. The Charitesia, incidentally, also had an athletic com- penent5. 2) Zeus Kar aios The inscription, which is dated at the beginning of the fourth century B.C. is on a small column, and has been restored to read [Au] Kapaiói ¡ [ - - apxioproç K'í,0dí&gt;«iA 1 IG 7.3196-3197. 1 am far from happy with my own attempt at Volume 1 .143. 2 The best discussion is by A. Wilhelm, Urkunden dramatischer Aufführungen in Athen (Vienna 1906) 46-47, who concludes that "der Anmeldung der Teilnahme und einer Prüfung ihrer Leistungen und ihrer Vorbereitung folgte die Zuweisung, die Bestellung für einen bestimmten Agon". 3 There is a good comparison of the two agons by P. Amand ry and Th. G. Spyropoulos, BCH 98 (1974) 225-228. Note that the competition èirivÍKict, which ended the Charitesia in IG 7.3195, comes at the end of the joint list - that is, under the Homoloia - on 3196 and 3197. As for the nature of the èirivíiaa, I suspect I was wrong about this too in Volume 1.142-143 (although not about the èinvÍKioç of the Sarapieia). I now think that it may have been similar to the evayyékta of the Amphiaraia and Romaia -- see ROME (OROPOS) - which appears in two victors' lists after the Third Mithridatic War, and probably commemorated Sulla's victory. The Orchomenian inscriptions are placed by A. G. Gossage, BSA 75 (1970) 116, within a limited span of about ten years after the war. This might explain both the competition, and the fact that the agons shared the same resources (it being, one presumes, a period of some economic hardship). 4 IG 7.48. 5 IG 22.3160 (second or first century B.C.). 6 IG 7.3208.

The epithets Soter and Saotes are applied to Zeus in several Boiotian poleis, always - wherever it can be determined ~ in a military context; the sanctuaries were also probably all situated in the agoras of their respective towns. 6) Zeus Teleios This inscription (IG 7.3217) was found on a marble plaque in the tholos tomb (Treasury of Minyas), and is restored, plausibly enough [. . .

This is the so-called "Covenant of Plataia". Modern opinion is divided broadly into two camps4, of which one accepts the covenant as in essence genuine5, while the other takes it to be a later concoction6. Both seem to agree that, while details may be of dubious origin, there is an element of historical fact in the tradition and there was an agreement of some kind among the victorious Greeks after the battle7. Of the ancient sources, the earliest inscriptions come from the third century B.C., two centuries after the battle. The literary evidence - if one excepts the verses attributed to Simonides8 - begins with Herodotos and Thucydides, and we can accept what they report as being valid for their time. The same can be said for the writers of the fourth century who mention the battle and its aftermath. It is the later writers, such as Diodoros and Plutarch, who pose the greatest problem. They were writing history, about events that were already in the distant past. How reliable are they as witnesses for that past?

Thus we are told that Diodoros depended entirely on Ephoros, and Plutarch either on some unknown fourth century source or on local traditions (whatever that would mean)1. The best we can do to control the veracity of these and other later writers is to com- pare what they say with what we know from other sources whose reliability is less questionable, that is, the literary sources of the fifth, fourth, and third centuries B.C., and the evidence of inscriptions. My procedure therefore is to survey the evidence chronologically to find out the first dateable testimony for each facet of the cult com- plex. The only secure evidence from the fifth century is provided by Herodotos and Thucydides. Herodotos 9.85.1-3 describes how the Greeks had buried their dead in separate tombs: the Spartans (in a cluster of three), Tegeans, Athenians, Megarians, and Phliasians. These tombs he accepts as genuine, but others were, according to his researches, empty mounds put up by states which had not participated in the battle, but caused them to be raised in order to gain undeserved glory tûjp èmyivofiévœv sípsksp àvOpéiciûv. We can deduce from Herodotos that by his day the site was at the very least a kind of tourist attraction, from which the absence of a tomb of its heroic dead might be embarrassing to a polis. The presence of tombs, whether real or false, is therefore attested for the middle or third quarter of the fifth century B.C.2. However, it would be unwise to infer from Herodotos that people came regularly to Plataia to pay formal homage to the dead in fixed ceremonies on specified occasions. Thucydides, writing about events leading up to the destruction of Plataia in 427 B.C., puts the following information in the mouths of the Plataians, who were petitioning the Spartans for help: (1) after the battle, the Spartan general Pausanias offered sacrifice to Zeus Eleutherios in the agora of Plataia (2.71.2-4, see 3.58.5); (2) at that time, Pausanias called upon the allies to keep Plataia inviolate, an oath which the Plataians were now urging Sparta to honour (2.71.2-4, see 3.59.2); (3) every year the Plataians would honour3 the tombs of the fallen òrifioaíçc saOrjfiaoi re Kai rolę ãkXoLç vofiífioiç, oca re i) yr¡ i)(iû v àpsòíòov ùpaïa, rávruv àrapxàç siri 4&gt;époprsç, svvoL ļihv SK &lt;t&gt; iXíaç xápaç, |ú¿t/xaxoi Ss ófiaíxfioiç tots yspofiépoiç (3.58.4)4. The way in which the sacrifice to Zeus Eleutherios is described suggests that it was a casual sacrifice, and that the god was invoked as such on this one occasion only. There is nothing here about the establishment of an official cult, of which no more is 1 Diodoros: on his sources, see, for example, R.

The only testimony which might support an early establishment of a formal cult is a reference by the comic poet Poseidippos, who was active in the first half of the third century1, to tò Zijpaußov kKsoç. There are two serious candidates for Serambos2: 1) An Aiginetan sculptor, who created a statue at Olympia of Agiadas of Elis, vic- torious boy boxer (Pausanias 6.10.9). This athlete is dated early in the fifth century B.C., largely because the Aiginetan school of sculpture declined after Aigina lost its independence in 458 B.C.3. A fragmentary inscription from Olympia, of the first half or middle of the fifth century, has been restored as a dedication by Agiadas, but the restoration is not generally accepted4. If this Serambos did operate early in the fifth century, the kásoç of Serambos to which Poseidippos refers would have been a statue, perhaps even of Zeus, and it would be necessary to posit some kind of formal activity soon after the battle. However, even if the passage does refer to a sculptor, there is in fact no reason why he could not have been an Aiginetan of a later period, since Aigina was restored in 405/404 B.C., and Aiginetans reappeared internationally named as such5, so that a statue made in the second half of the fourth century B.C. would not have been impossible. 2) Plato, Górgias 518b, mentions Eápa/i/9oç ó /cáxrjXoç, who has been identified with the Lrjpafißoq of Poseidippos6. This would place him late in the fifth century, possibly a Plataian. This certainly suits the context of the passage better than a sculptor of whatever date. On balance I would conclude that the passage by Poseidippos cannot be used as evidence for the establishment of a formal cult of Zeus Eleutherios at Plataia soon after the battle. See below. To return to the fifth century: it would also appear that an undertaking had been made to preserve Plataia from harm. It was, in a sense, holy ground, as here the Greeks had united - however temporarily - under the aigis of their gods (see Thucydides 3.58.5) to free Greece from the barbarian. This motif is repeated by Isok- rates 14.60, writing of a similar crisis in the life of Plataia in the fourth century. This part of the covenant, therefore, has a basis, if not in fact, then at least in a tradition already current in the second half of the fifth century. However, it is clear from later events that, even if there was a panhellenic agreement to keep Plataia inviolate, it was broken on at least two occasions, in 427 by the Spartans and in 373 by Thebes.

It is possible that the Karaywyiov built next door to the Heraion after the destruc- tion of Plataia in 427 B.C., and consecrated to the goddess, may have been intended for use, not only in the worship of Hera, but also on the occasion of the annual rites, for otherwise, there would have been no place to house visiting delegates, or in fact anybody who might have come to view the battlefield and pay their respects to the dead1. In much the same way, the annual sacrifices at the tombs of the fallen underwent changes over the years. Thucydides's description (of which an echo is found in Isok- rates 14.602) gives the impression that the rite was performed during or just after the harvest season (oaa re r¡ yfj i)1iúv àveòíòov ú paca , xavrcov àirapxàç 8Tci&lt;1&gt;épovT8ç)3 . The rite at the tombs as described by Plutarch, Aristeides 21 (331F-332C) (and see De Herodoti Malignitate 42 [872E]), took place, in his day, at the beginning of winter: see below Section 5c. We therefore have to postulate a break in the tradition here too, and a revival in later antiquity. In fact, in later times, the Plataians did perform a rite on the anniversary of the battle, but this was a sacrifice to Zeus Eleutherios on the occasion of the annual meeting of the kocvòv avvéhpcov tCdv 'Ekkrjvtav: see below, Section 5a. There is also some evidence of another stage in the history of the tomb rite. The inscription honouring Glaukon son of Eteokles and brother of Chremonides (BCH 99 [1975] 51-75, from about the middle of the third century B.C.) states quite clearly that the agon - known from other sources as the Eleutheria ~ was at that time regarded as being celebrated ¿xi toïç cxvSpáaiv to tç àyaOóiç Kai àyœvioafiévocç Tpòç tovç ßa pßapovg vxèp rijç tû&gt;v 'EXXtjíw eksvOspíaç 4. It seems from this that the annual rites celebrated by the Plataians had been taken over by the koivòv tûv 'EXXrjvœv and transformed into a pentaeteric agon. On a later occasion the annual rite at the tomb would have been revived by the Plataians, its date changed in order to avoid conflict with other, "panhellenic", ceremonies, that is, the pentaeteric Eleutheria and other annual rites conducted on the anniversary of the battle (see below). The earliest definite reference to the Eleutheria is in the passage to which I have already referred, by Poseidippos, PCG 7F31, who describes Plataia as vaoì òvsiaì 1 Thucydides 3.68.3. The desolate state of Plataia, which possessed only two temples, a stoa, its name, a bath, and an inn, and became a polis only for the Eleutheria, was mocked by Poseidippos, PCG 7F31 (29 Edm.): see below. See too HERA (PLATAIA), and note that communal dining was obviously an essential feature of the worship of Hera Kithaironia: SEG 24.361, HERA (CHORSIAI) and ADDENDA, sv. 2 B. D. Meritt, H. T. Wade-Gery, M. F. McGregor, The Athenian Tribute Lists 3 (Princeton 1950) 101. 3 The battle itself was fought late in the summer or early in the autumn: see, for example, E. Kirsten, RE 20 (1950) 2295. 4 The authors of BCH 99 (1975) 63 are wrong in separating the agon from the commemoration of the dead, to which they attribute the sacrifice. The only sacrifice mentioned in the inscription is for Zeus Eleutherios and Homonoia; the fallen heroes are mentioned only in connection with the agon. 129</page><page sequence="132">ZEUS (PLATAIA) Koti crroà Kai rovpoļia ' Kai tò ßa'apsiop noil rò Lripänßov ichéoç, ¡ rò ttoXì) fiep aurą, rolę 6"Ehev0epíoiç tóXiç. This passage implies the existence of an official cult with all the administrative trappings. Since there is no clear evidence for such a thing in the fifth and fourth century sources, it would appear that the cult and agon were instituted between the destruction of Plataia in 373 B.C. (Isokrates) and the time of Poseidippos, presumably after another restoration of the town1. For the Eleutheria, see below, Section 5d. Philip II of Macedón is said to have promised the restoration of Plataia (and Orchomenos) after the battle of Chaironeia in 338 B.C.2. Another move in this direc- tion after the destruction of Thebes in 335 B.C. is reported by Arrian 1.9.10. In 331 B.C., according to Plutarch, Alexander 34 (685B), Alexander the Great, after being proclaimed ßa oiXsvç rtjç 'Aaíaç, &lt;f&gt;iKonnov1iepoç ôè xpòç rovç "EXXrçmç, syparpe ràç rvpappíòaç iráaaç KaraXvOrjpai Kai toXltsíisip avTovoļiovg, iòíçt òè Hkaraievoi tt¡ v tÔXip àpoiKohoyLsiVy on lij v xúpap oi rarépeç avrœp èpaywpíoaoQai rolę "EXXrjaip vncep ríjç èXevOepíaç tapéoxov.

This gives a terminus post quem for the restoration of Plataia and a suitable pretext for the organization of a "panhellenic" cult and agon, namely the commemoration of another victory of Greeks over barbarians. What better place to celebrate this achieve- ment than the site of the great battle of 479 B.C.? and indeed, the political and psychological advantage of the location of Plataia, near both Athens and Thebes, must have been attractive too3. It is also about this time that inscriptions begin to appear. What may be the earliest - perhaps of the fourth century B.C. - is a boundary stone from Plataia inscribed 1 Thus R. Étienne and M. Piérart, BCH 99 (1975) 68: "On imagine . . .très bien que les Platéens, revenus sur leurs terres et redressant leurs murs grâce à l'appui d'Alexandre, aient instituté à ce moment un concours en l'honneur des héros de la bataille de 479, dont la tradition affirmait qu'il avait été créé par la Ligue des Hellènes au lendemain des guerres médiques. L'occasion semble favorable alors: Philippe et Alexandre se présentent en champions de la liberté des Grecs, donnent à la Grèce dans la Ligue de Corinthe son premier embryon d'institution panhellénique et songent à reprendre au nom de tous les Grecs la lutte contre le Barbare". Further on the same page they suggest that in the last third of the fourth century the League of Corinth, probably at the request of the Plataians and perhaps with royal support, organized the pentaeteric agon. Then later, when the league ceased to meet at Corinth, Plataia continued to celebrate the Eleutheria, and those who gathered at Plataia "prétendirent perpétuer la tradition du koivòv avvéòpiov T&amp;v 'EXX^cwc.

These will be considered separately below. In the second half of the third century B.C., the Boiotian confederacy dedicated one or more tripods to Zeus Eleutherios. With this we may compare Plutarch's reference to tripods at Plataia in De Herodoti Malignitate 43 (874A)3. In summary, the earlier history of the cults could have gone as follows: 1) a sacrifice to Zeus as Eleutherios at Plataia after the battle in 479; 2) the raising of tombs and/or monuments to the fallen, soon afterwards; 3) regular ceremonies at the tombs during the fifth century B.C. conducted by the city of Plataia, but suspended at or before its destruction in 427 B.C.; 4) raising of one or more trophies, possibly after the restoration of Plataia about 386 B.C.; 5) the establishment late in the fourth century B.C. of a full-scale official cult by the Hellenes united under a Macedonian hegemony, in which were included: a) a sanctuary of Zeus Eleutherios, b) joint worship of Zeus and Homonoia, c) the athletic agon Eleutheria, instituted by the Koinon in memory of the fallen (this being substituted for the annual rites earlier conducted by Plataia), 1 Or 'E X(Xi}wi&gt;)? See AE (1917) 160.7. 2 He was the brother of Chremonides, and pursued an active career both in Athens and in the service of Ptolemy II. See BCH 99 (1975) 56ff. In the year 255-254 B.C., Glaukon was priest of Alexander, perhaps another link between him and the Plataian cult: BCH 58. 3 IG 7.1672: dated ca. 240-237 B.C. - see P. Roesch, Thespies et la confédération béotienne (Paris 1965) 88 (the federal archon in question is dated ca. 240 B.C. by R. Étienne and D. Knoepfler, BCH Supplément 3 [1976] 350); IG 7.1673-1674 are fragments of apparently similar dedications, and AE (1917) 159.4 is a fragmentary list of names, one of which appears on IG 7.1672, another on IG 7.1673.

Unless and until additional contemporary evidence proves otherwise, this is as far as we can go in tracing the origins and early development of the cults surrounding the commemoration of the battle of 479 B.C. lb) Administration of the Cult(s) Insofar as there was cult activity in the fifth century and the first part of the fourth, it was concerned with honouring the fallen at their tombs and was conducted solely by Plataia. The inscription BCH 99 (1975) 51-75 makes no direct mention of the Plataians. The directing body is tò koivòv avvébpiop twv 'EXXijeo»' (lines 25-26) The inscrip- tion is dated [¿0'] ispéoiç NckokXsîôov tov Xaipéov, àyoiPoOsrovPToç 'A pxskáov rov 'ABrļvaiov, and the decree is proposed by EvfiovXoç Havapļioarov Boiwnoę. The absence of ethnika for the priest (presumably of Zeus and Homonoia) and agonothete suggests that these men were Plataians, and that, therefore, the day-to-day operation of cult and agon were in the hands of that polis. The Koinon as such probably pos- sessed no political powers: Plataia never became a political centre, and the very fact that the Koinon and agon underwent successive revivals suggests that any significance they had was symbolic. The next we hear of the Koinon is in an epigram from Athens (considered below), which refers to iraíòeç ¿&gt;"EX[Xrji&gt;]a»'. This belongs to the last third of the second century B.C.2. From the end of the second comes another Athenian inscription on which the Koinon figures3, and which seems to mention the sending of theoriai4, with which compare Plutarch, Aristeides 21 (331E-F)5. From the first century B.C. there are two references. Diodoros 11.29.1, in writing of events preceding the battle, refers to a decree as eôoije rotę ovvéòpoiç rû? 'E Wrjvwv. This is probably an anachronism, although it might refer to the ovfißaxoi temporarily allied for the purposes of the battle. There is also the question of how much of this is Diodoros and how much his source, and who his source was. An undoubted reference is on the inscription L. Robert, Hellenica 7 (1949) 117-125, of ca. 20 B.C. from Miletos, where mention is made twice of 'Ekevdépia rà sv IlXaraïaîç rà ri0ép.8pa virò tov koivov tûp 'EKKifPuv, and twice of honours bes- towed úxò tov koivov tûp 'EK'r¡p&lt;j)p.

There is, finally, the single word ovvéhpiov in an Athenian inscription of the sec- ond or third century A.D., which refers also to a priest of Homonoia and Zeus Eleutherios (IG 22. 1 352) . Of these sources, four may be regarded as official documents: BCH 99 (1975) 51- 75 (ca. mid-third century B.C.), IG 22.1990 (61/62 A.D.), IG 7.2509 (first or second century A.D.), and SEG 22.467 (125 A.D.).

The expression oi eiç ÛXaraiàç ovviòvTeç, found under the Empire, may have no special significance, but on the other hand might reflect a re-organization of the Koinon under a slightly different name. As we have seen, following the (re-)organization of the cult structure late in the fourth or early in the third century B.C., the cults of Zeus Eleutherios and Homonoia, and the agon Eleutheria, were under the direction of a body called the Koinon of the Hellenes3. It is impossible to say how closely this control was exercised. It has been suggested that BCH 99 (1975) 51-75 shows signs that the polis of Plataia was offi- cially involved in the cult. In later years the priesthood of Zeus Eleutherios was held by at least one Plataian4, but also by men from elsewhere5. Of the latter all but one 1 IG 22.1990. See below, Section 4, for Nero and other emperors. 2 BCH 31 (1913) 240.47. For the date see L.

From the evidence we have, therefore, it would appear that in the Imperial period at least, the important offices of the cult were held by nominees of the Koinon. Plataia, on the other hand, was responsible for two important annual functions: 1) at the time of the annual meeting of the Koinon on the anniversary of the battle, the Plataians sacrificed to Zeus Eleutherios vxèp rqç píkiiç (Plutarch, Aristeides 19 [330F-331A]): see below, Section 5a; 2) at the beginning of winter, the Plataians offered sacrifices at the tombs of the fallen, a revival, it may be, of the fifth century ritual alluded to by Thucydides (Plutarch, Aristeides 21 [331F-332A] and De Herodoti Malignitate 42 [872E]): see below, Section 5c. 2) Zeus Eleutherios and/or the Homonoia of the Hellenes Excavations (monumental altar east of ancient town) Th.

There, in addition to the joint sanctuary and joint altar1 , mention is made of a joint sacrifice to Zeus and Homonoia2. The context suggests that this sacrifice was distinct from the Eleutheria. It could have occurred at the same time as the agon, but the occasion could also have been the regular - probably annual ~ meetings of the Koinon on the anniversary of the battle (see below). I have already referred to priests of Zeus Eleutherios, and Zeus Eleutherios and Homonoia of the Hellenes (see above). These are on inscriptions of the Imperial period. The latest known reference to the joint cult is IG 7.2510, from the beginning of the third century A.D.; the latest to Homonoia is TAPA 103 (1972) 158. e, from the second half of the third century A.D. Homonoia is, furthermore, mentioned by Diodoros 11.29.2 and Aristeides 13.148 (Dindorf 1 p. 240) in contexts which suggest that this cult was in the minds of the authors, or of their sources. 3) The Fallen Testimonia See below, 5c The earliest regular activity conducted in this cult was in honour of those who fell at the battle of 479 B.C. We know that these rites were conducted in the fifth and possibly early in the fourth centuries B.C. In the next century the fallen were com- memorated by the agon - known either then or later as the Eleutheria ~ and in Plutarch's day Plataia held an annual ceremony which he describes in detail (see below). The sources (that is, Thucydides, Isokrates, Plutarch) make it clear that these rites were performed by Plataia during their own lifetimes. How long after Plutarch's day the rite continued to be celebrated we do not know. Pausanias does not mention it, but since by this time they would have been celebrated at the beginning of winter, he is unlikely to have been there to take note of it. 4) Emperors /G22.1990 IG 7.1675; (2505); (2509); (2713) SEG 22.467 (5y//3. 1066)3 1 Compare Plutarch, De Herodoti Malignitate 43 (874A) (ßw/ioi ita pà rolę Oeóiç); IG 7.2510 (beginning of the third century A.D., a dedication by Plataia of a statue of L.

Syll.* 1066 from Kos, of the time of Augustus, may refer to the agon as 'E'£i&gt;[0epi]a rà Kai Kai aápr¡a. To date this appearance of the name is unique, but there is other evidence for emperor worship at Plataia.

Later, in 125 A.D., the Koinon dedicated an altar at Delphi to Hadrian (SEG 22.467). In the same year, the polis of Lebadeia dedi- cated a statue of Hadrian at Plataia3.

Robertson has analyzed the documents concerning this event, and I follow his principal conclusions (which are, it should be noted, valid for a period reaching from late in the second century B.C. to the end of the second century A.D.): 1) the Eleutheria were celebrated every fourth year; 2) in Metageitnion of the year mid-way between celebrations, the General Council of the Hellenes, meeting at Plataia, heard the rival claims of Athens and Sparta to lead the procession at the next celebration of the Eleutheria. The prize was the xpoTo/txei a, and the event became known as ó SiáXoyoç, "the arbitration"3. 5c) Commemorative Rites at the Tombs of the Fallen Herodotos 9,85.1-3 Isokrates 14.60; 14.61 Plutarch, Aristeides 21 (331F-332C); De Herodoti Malignitate 42 (872E) Thucydides 3.58.4 In the fifth century B.C., and perhaps in the fourth, if Isokrates bears good wit- ness, the Plataians carried out annual rituals in honour of the fallen: Thucydides 3.58.4, Isokrates 14.61. I have already suggested that these rites may have taken place in the summer (see above also on their possible suspension and temporary replacement by the Eleutheria in the third century B.C.). In Plutarch's day, a similar rite was performed, also by the Plataians, but at the beginning of winter, on the 16th of Alalkomenios. This was the last month of the Boiotian calendar, and was the time when outgoing magistrates handed over to their successors. It was also the occasion for the celebration - at Thebes ~ of the Herakleia, which began their existence as funerary games in honour of fallen heroes. See HERAKLES (THEBES). One can readily imagine why the polis of Plataia elected to perform the rites at this time. 1 See N.

There are relatively few references to the actual competitions, there being only one or two fragmentary victors' lists definitely attributable to the Eleutheria, but from them and the documents honouring victors in the Eleutheria it can be deduced that the range of competitions was not unusual, with one or two exceptions2.

The earliest reference to the Manápuv vrļoot, is by the historian Armenidas, of late in the fifth century B.C., who is quoted as having written that the akiopolis of Thebes was formerly called Ma nápwv injaoi Ç FGrH 378F5). This is connected with the story of Rhadamanthys and Alkmene, who were said, after Alkmene's death, to have dwelt in the Isles of the Blest. The story is usually located in the Haliartia: see [RHADAMANTHYS (HALIARTIA)]. Its location - or perhaps relocation - at Thebes may be connected with attempts by the Thebans in the second half of the fifth century B.C. to take over and assert their leadership of Boiotia2. Part of this involved 1 Maicápup ríjaoi: Lykophron, Alexandra 1189-1213; Schol. Lykophron, Alexandra 1194; 1204.

An essen- tial feature of owning a god was to claim possession of his birthplace1 . The Boiotian Zeus' s "official" birthplace was probably at Chaironeia, first point of entry of the Boiotoi2: here Rhea was said to have concealed the infant Zeus, and handed Kronos the stone wrapped in swaddling clothes3. The act was depicted on a statue by Praxiteles just inside the entrance to the Heraion at Plataia4. What may therefore have happened at Thebes was a conscious attempt to relocate the birth of Zeus, chief god of the Boiotoi, there, to join the already generally accepted traditions of the births of Dionysos and Herakles at Thebes. After the reconstruction of Thebes, the name Ma tcápwv urjooi was given to the place where the "bones of Hektor" were relocated, near the fountain Oidipodeia, which is usually identified with the fountain of Agioi Theodoři below and north-east of the Kadmeia5. There was, it would follow, no ancient tradition which actually linked any part of Thebes with the birth of Zeus. On Hektor, see HEKTOR (THEBES). Zeus Agoraios Below and west of the Kadmeia, probably on the site of a suburban agora, a sanctuary of Zeus Agoraios with a stone cult image. See THEMIS (THEBES)6. Zeus Ammon Pausanias, after writing about the statues of Pronomos and Epameinondas on the Kadmeia, continues: ov TÓppo) hé san vaòç "Apfiupoç, Kai tò ãyaXfia àpéOijics p.sv Hívòapoç, KaX áfiiòoç òé kariv epyov. After this comes the place called the óiuvooKO-Keiov of Teiresias, and near it a sanctuary of Tyche7. It is generally accepted that this Ammon was the Libyan god identified with Zeus by Pindar8, and to judge from what Pausanias says, his informants at Thebes were of the same mind. Modern scholarship also almost unanimously accepts the attribution of 1 Thus, for example, Athena Alalkomeneïs/Itonia was said to have been born at the river Triton, a name conveniently given to a torrent by the Alalkomeneion: Pausanias 9.33.7. 2 Plutarch, Kimon 1 (478E-F).

But how likely is the story to be true? It is hard to credit that, after all the disasters suffered by Thebes, a temple with a cult image dedicated by Pindar would have remained intact, particularly in the face of a complete lack of other evidence2. It is more likely that local antiquarians identified the statue with the Ammon mentioned in one of Pindar's works. Where would this leave us? Obviously there was a temple, with a statue in it. That it was by Kalamis we can accept: Pausanias doubts it not, and he was a capable judge. We can also accept that the statue was of a male horned deity3. Another candidate has been proposed in the person of the Boiotian ethnic god, Zeus Karaios/Keraios: the epithet, whatever its real meaning, could have given the artist a clue as to how to pro- ceed in producing a cult image4. On the whole, I think it is probable that this cult image did represent Zeus Karaios/Keraios. Zeus Elieus The gloss simply identities Elieus as Zeus at Thebes5. K. Latte, in the apparatus criticus of his edition of Hesychios, notes that Wilamowitz compared Plutarch, Quaestiones Graecae 40 (300D): Eunostos (a Tanagran hero) was son of Elieus, son of Kephisos and Skia s. The whole story told by Plutarch is attributed by him in the * The only exception seems to be U .

For a fìlli discussion of the work by Kalamis, see J. Dörig, "Kalamis-Studien", Jdl 80 (1965) 200-201, who bases his dating of the statue (in the forties of the fifth century) on the authority of the tradition. But against this see M. Vickers, NChron 145 (1985) 29 note 226: "Much has been written about Calamis, but since most of it is in the tradition established by F. Studniczka ( Kalamis , ein Beitrag zur griechis- chen Kunstgeschichte y Leipzig, 1907) it is of little value". 2 See Classen, cited above, 350 note 9. 3 Ammon with horns: C.

What I am suggesting of course is not that Zeus Karaios was Zeus Ammon, but that the Theban Zeus "Ammon" was really the Boiotian Zeus Karaios, and was mis-identified by later Thebans. The epithet Karaios/Keraios, of which another variant is Akraios, has to do with mountain tops. See ZEUS (KORONEIA), ad init. For another example of artists producing a cult image of a local god in the persona of a panhellenic deity because of shared characteristics and/or appurtenances, see TROPHONIOS (LEBADEIA). Then, of course, there are the Theban Kabiroi, who were identified with various gods depending on which of their aspects was of greatest interest to a particular worshipper.

H. Schwabl, RE 15 (1978) sv "Zeus" 1454, derives the name from sXoç. A name associated with marshes would be suitable for any son of Kephisos. Elieus may have been connected with Eleon, which lay in the borderland between Thebes and Tanagra1, or even the unlocated town of Eilesion2. I suppose that a connection with the person Elieus is possible for the Theban Zeus, although it is more likely to have been with a dependent settlement such as Eleon or Eilesion. Zeus of the Marsh-land would not be out of place for a farmer's god. Even today there is marshy land both to the west and the north of Thebes. Zeus Homoloios The inscription - on a small column ~ is a dedication of a tithe, of the sixth or fifth century B.C. and confirms the testimony of the later literary sources. It is pos- sible that there was an agon called Homoloia in Thebes, although the only epigraphi- cal evidence which can be placed geographically is for the agon at Orchomenos. See ZEUS (ORCHOMENOS)3.

Nilsson (AM) with Meilichios and Philios. See below. Zeus Meilichios There are four inscriptions2. One (BCH no. 43) records a dedication by (their) priest to Zeus Milichios and Milichia; another (BCH no. 44) a similar dedication to Zeus Milichios; a third (IG 7.1814) a dedication to Zeus Milichios and Milicha. The fourth (SEG) is a rental contract, one of whose landmarks is the sanctuary of [Zeus] Meilichios, which, was therefore, in the Thespian xcópa. A relief found in the territory of Thespiai depicts worshippers leading a beast to an altar standing beside a tree or column, around which a snake has wound itself: this looks like Zeus Ktesios or Zeus Meilichios; the rustic setting might symbolize the rural sanctuary of (Zeus) Meilichios, which might have been near the find-spot of the stone.

Zeus Saotes The epithet is attached to Dionysos in the Argolid4, to Zeus at Thebes, and pos- sibly to Zeus at Epidauros5. The aition for the bronze cult image at Thespiai follows familiar lines6: a monster besets the town, "the god" (Apollo, no doubt) ordains that an ephebe be chosen by lot every year to be given to the beast; the lover of one of them devises a trick to kill the monster, and in recognition of his sacrifice Zeus is given the epithet Saotes. The names of the two ephebes (Kleostratos, Menestratos), and the very fact that they were ephebes, suggest that the cult may have its origin in military training7.

This Zeus was one of the two chief gods of the Boiotian ethnos, the other being Athena Alalkomeneïs/Itonia. He is more closely asso- ciated with the Minyans than the Boiotoi proper, and the evidence for the combination of the worship of Zeus and Athena at Koroneia in the middle of the sixth century B.C. probably reflects a political rapprochement, forced or otherwise. The epithet, which would seem in origin to have been topographical ~ Zeus of the summits ~ eventually became descriptive, as images appear with punning references to a "homed" Zeus: see ZEUS (THEBES, THESPIAI).

The despatch of tripods to Dodona is attested by Pindar, Fragment 59, who seems to have written about a rite originating at Thebes.

It is possible that the rite began from a different sanctuary on each occasion and was con- ducted by the Boiotoi as opposed to the Thebans alone. This would help to explain why the dedication was made to Zeus, who was one of the two gods of the Boiotian ethnos. The choice of Dodona would then have been dictated by its proximity to the legendary ancestral homeland of the Boiotoi7. The rite was an old one, going back to that stage in the development of the oracle at Dodona when the entire ritual was con- ducted by men, for so I interpret the story about the custom whereby the Boiotoi con- tinued to have their responses given them by men8. It is difficult to assign a date to the beginning of the custom, since the Boiotoi are known as such from as early as the 1 C. Austin, ed., Nova Fragmenta Euripidea (Berlin 1968) 31. 2 H. J.

The contexts of 57 and 60 are impossible to recover; 58 deals with the story of the two doves which flew from Egyptian Thebes (compare Herodotos 2.54-55), one to Libya and Ammon, the other to Dodona. Fragment 59, on the other hand, is clearly related to the ritual of the tripodophoria: see lines 4 (¿opr[á]), 6 (j/Lay[T]rfiop), 1 (tctvxì Toļiņpov), 8 (-]ç àfierépaç Ó7r[o), 11 (evßev yity [ | rjpt? róòeççí re Kal Ovaíaiç); and the marginal note to line 12: àpx ( )énrò ôîj0[ûj&gt;].

Ephoros writes that the tripod was taken at night, as if by stealth, wrapped in himatia, and borne off to Dodona. A similar tale of false theft is told by Proklos. If this is what did happen, the purpose may have been to avoid punishment from the god from whose sanctuary the tripod was taken. On the other hand, it may simply mean, first, that the rite began at night ~ that is, at the beginning of the day ~ and that the tripod was wrapped up in order to protect it on its journey. Euripides, Herakleides Pontikos, Ephoros, and Proklos report that the use of male prophets arose from a murder committed by a Theban/Boiotian consultant, who threw one of the three prophetesses into a cauldron of boiling water. The sending of the tripods is loosely attached to this version. It is suspect: one has but to consider the probable date of Euripides's Erechtheus - 423 B.C.1 - to find a good Athenian motive for imputing impiety to their neighbours, namely their behaviour the year before at Delion2. 1 See Austin and Mette. 2 Perhaps an allusion to the Xc0ijç used by the Boiotians at the battle of Delion: Thucydides 4.100.2? 155</page><page sequence="158">CULTS OF DEITIES UNSPECIFIED BY NAME UNSPECIFIED (AIGOSTHENA) IG 7.209, 216, 217, 218: Lists of ephebes from the period of Aigosthena's member- ship in the Boiotian Koinon1 , each ending with the name of the victor in the hoplite race.

The location of Aspledon was obviously unknown to the later Greeks. The best that Strabo - or rather his probable source, Apollodoros of Athens - can do is to identify it with a site called Evòsískoç twenty stades from Orchomenos on the other side of the river Melas.

The list is headed by the names of the archon, hierarch, and secre- tary, and so, if from a state-run sanctuary, probably not the Kabirion (for then there would have been kabiriarchs rather than hierarchs). Th. Reinach, REG 12 (1899) 65, reprints the text with restorations based on Side B of REG 12 (1899) 53-115, a list of dedications of clothing by women on the obverse side of the stone bearing the decrees regarding the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Tanagra (Reinach's text is on page 65, note 3). The similarity is striking, as 181</page><page sequence="184">UNSPECIFIED (THEBES) Reinach remarks, but since the Theban document is headed by a single hierarch, while the Tanagran one has two in each of the three years covered by the list, he preferred ultimately to take IG 7.2421 as Theban. However, since 1899 enough new data have appeared to show that the number of hierarchs could vary within the same polis, the fluctuation probably being due to variations in the amount and nature of work to be done in this sector within a given year1. I therefore see no reason not to attribute this inscription to Tanagra, and to the same sanctuary as the Tanagran list, which I assign, not to the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore, but to the Tanagran sanctuary of Artemis.

Immediately preceding this is a payment of 7.5 drachmas to Asopodoros for a stele (probably the one on which this document was inscribed).
