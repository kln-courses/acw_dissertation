<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV.-PHILOSOPHY IN ITS NATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS. BY PROFESSOR KNIGHT. THE Philosophy of the World is an organic whole, which has moved forward in uninterrupted continuity,-although not al- ways at the same speed, or on the same lines,-from the first to the last stage of its evolution. What has occasionally seemed to the casual observer to be a break in its development, owing to the absence of visible links, has afterwards-when the missing links have been discovered-become part of a chainl of evidence, demonstrating the unity of the whole process. The theory of a continuous mundane development, creating by slow evolution those products, which are themselves des- tined to be superseded .by new ones-in other words, the theory of "a perpetual becoming"-has grown in scientific clearness from the days of Heraclitus to our own; and is now accepted, with few dissentient voices, by those who have been initiated in Philosophy. But this doctrine of becoming is the theoretic interpretation of only one aspect of the universe. If " all things are double one against another," what endures is as important as that which changes; and the Eleatic Philosophy is as true as the Heraclitic. Unity and variety together constitute the totality of existence; and each is necessary to the other. Para- doxical as it may seem, permanence lies at the background of every change; while perpetual change is the conditio stne qua non of all endurance. To apply this generalisation at once to the subject to be discussed. In a certain sense, the whole Philosophy of the World is radically one. Being the outcome of a continuous cosmic process, operating in all lands, its problems are fundamentally the same; but, within each country, they differentiate them- selves in detail. The surface variety has been necessary to exhibit the underlying unity, while the latter has been equally needed to unite the miscellaneous fragments in a single whole. The truth embodied in the law of Evolution has proved, to</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY IN ITS NATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS. 61 most thoughtful persons, that the numerous phases of opinion and belief, as well as the manifold types of national character which have arisen in the course of History, have in no single instance been matter of accident or chance. They have been due to radical, if not to racial, characteristics of Human Nature; and they are therefore likely to be as persistent as any of the types of organic structure, which the sciences disclose. The bent, or national tendency, of every people is due to myriad influences, which have played 'upon it from the dawn of time. These influences which have, in a subtle way, differentiated it from all others, are often occult, and underworking. They are not always known by those who inherit them from within, or receive them from without; and they are seldom visible to others. What becomes apparent in the recorded history of a nation is but a fragment of that which has gone to the formation of the national character. The latter has been due to the joint operation of causes both external and internal, and of forces which have worked beneath as well as above the stream of development. This principle applies to all the elements which go to con- stitute the life of mankind. Like every other product, the Philosophy of the World has passed through multitudinous phases; widely different each from each in the amount of insight they have shewn, but all of them of value to the race at large. If the Literature, the Art, the Politics, the Social Life, and the Religion of the world together constitute a vital and organic whole-which differentiates itself here and there, because of the localities in which it works-its Philosophy is certainly no exception to this law of development. While there has been an organic unity operating underneath all change,-and even guiding apparent anomalies of form,-variety of aspect has been equally necessary; and the expansion of Philosophy throughout the ages has been due to the joint influence of them both. If, however, the historian of Philosophy attempted to trace its developments from a cosmopolitan point of view, ignoring the differences of race and nationality, he would pass from country to country in a somewhat bewildering fashion. Organic dif- ferences would baffle him, in any attempt to trace the underlying unity, with a steady hand. It is therefore necessary not only to recognise, but to emphasise, the differences which now exist; and to trace them carefully in detail, while indicating their common origin. The old historians of Philosophy were, for the most part, mere chroniclers. They put down in their books a series of statements, more or less accurate, as to what this or that philosopher thought, or " held," or taught. These</page><page sequence="3">62 PROFESSOR KNIGHT: recorded opinions were mere isolated dicta, chronicled in an irregular manner, with no attempt to trace their origin, their connection, or their influence. Others, since the time of Ritter, have tried to exhibit the course of Philosophy as one of organic growth; and all the numerous and noteworthy histories of it, which have been written in Germany, France, and England since Ritter's time-although their interpretations and criti- cisms may have been coloured by the particular school of thought to which the writer belonged-have adopted, more or less, the guiding principle of his book. It has now become so obvious as to amount almost to a commonplace, that an adequate history of Philosophy can be constructed, only when the thought of the world is regarded as an organic whole; and when every phase of it-including those which to us of the 19th century may be grotesque, or even repulsive-receives its due, as the passing aspect of an underlying tendency. But, while every link in the chain is seen to be a real element in the cosmos-and some of the things which a mature civilization considers " least honourable " are nevertheless recognised as having contributed to the final result-it is absolutely necessary for the historian to take up nation after nation, seriatim; to deal with each of them in- dividually, tracing those collateral influences which have come into it from abroad, as well as those which have reached it by direct inheritance within its own area. It is easy to over-magnify the local influences which have shaped the Philosophy of a particular people; while the wider racial ones, underlying all provincial tendencies, are ignored. But, while many histories of Philosophy, since Ritter's time, have been compiled with the view of exhibiting the " increasing purpose" of the whole, few historians have tried to unfold the characteristics of each race, as an organic growth within its own domain, or province. I therefore think that it should be the aim of future historians to shew the fundamlental differences inherent in each race-and thus to explain the local phases and peculiarities of developmnent-rather than to emphasise the underlying unity of the thought of the world. That there is a distinctive national colour, in all the great philosophies, cannot be denied by any competently informed person; nor can it be ignored in any adequate historical treat- ment of them. It is also important to note that a scientific examination of the provincial aspects of Philosophy is, on the whole, a return to precision, from the vagueness which a sense of the unity of the thought of the world is apt to engender. If we start with the cosmopolitan idea, and with the two main "streams of tendency "-the real and the ideal-and traverse</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY IN ITS NATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS. 63 the centuries with their aid, setting down so much as due to idealism and so much to realism, we do not achieve much in the way of explanation, and we are apt to become nebulous and hazy. Nowadays, when every one in the world is a sort of "next door neighbour "-when we have "thrown a girdle round the earth " in less than " forty seconds," and may soon be able to telephone to the very ends of the world-we are probably inclined to over-estimate the unity of the race. But there is no evidence to shew that acquaintance with other communities, and a knowledge of their distinctive features-knowledge which grows so rapidly in an age of scientific progress-will tend to produce greater uniformity of type, will lessen the differences which exist, or minimise the distinctive features of each man, woman, or child. Besides, the abolition of its differences would be a serious loss to the world at large. Even were it possible, it would be a prodigious mistake to attempt to reduce the races of mankind to a dead level of uniformity, to europeanise the Indian, to asiaticise the African, to americanise the Polynesian, and so on. It would not only be a very wasteful policy to each of them while it lasted, but it would involve a serious loss to the world, were it even partially successful. What we need is the removal of every obstacle to individual and national develop- ment. Each race demands the freest possible evolution of opinion, character, belief, and action in all directions; " live and let live" being the law of the house, alike in individual families, and in mixed commnunities of men. Every extreme corrects, if it does not neutralise, the rest; and if the differen- tiation of the race be carried much further in the future, its unity instead of disappearing will become more and more apparent. Within each nation, however, normal development proceeds from within outwards, not from without inwards. The higher culture must not be superimposed ab extra, it must be evolved ab intra. It must be reached by the slow processes of interior growth, and subsequent expansion. We cannot raise a people low in civilization up to a higher level, by thrusting upon it an alien type of life and culture, still less by making use of compulsion. We may graft, with the utmost skill, a new branch on the old stem; but, even in that case, the old will dominate the new, not the new the old. A conviction which is to last, and to bear fruit, must invariably proceed from within. If it is to endure, it must be educed; and that in- volves a long, and often a tedious, historic process. The result is very seldom accomplished by argument. It is much more</page><page sequence="5">64 PROFESSOR KNIGHT: largely due to unconscious agencies than to conscious forces, It would seem to be the case that there must be a concurrent development of the physical frame and the animal functions, with an increase of brain-power, and a refinement of feeling; in other words, a growth of " the senses and the intellect " on the one hand, of "the emotions and the will" on the other, before any radically new manifestation of Human Nature can take place. Another point of importance is this. The time during which the several races of mankind have already lasted has some bearing on the question of their probable duration. If the lower types began their career much further back, and have therefore a greater ancestry than the higher ones, it may be asked 'Have they none of the prescriptive rights of primogeniture?' In the physical cosmos outside of man we find organisms persistent for millions of years, and doing great service to the world; and it is most natural to ask why all the lower types of Human Nature should be uprooted, to make room for what we call (and rightly call) the higher ones; while every type is relative to a zero-point, from which they all have started, which gives us a standard for comparison, and by which the excellence of each may be appraised? We may surely ask, why all the lower races should be sacrificed for the good of the higher ones? And we may answer the question in the same way in which most humane persons object to the unlimited vivisection of our canine friends, for a remote possible benefit to the human race. Then, have we not found historically that the higher races have occasionally (and most righteously) been superseded by the lower ones, although only for a time? More important it is to note that many persons who forsake a lower for a higher creed bring with them, and cannot help bringing, much that passed current in the lower; while the two cannot amalgamate. Many who abandon the customs of their country, who give up-it may be on conviction, or it may be through bribery-the faith of their ancestors, adopting a new cult, and becoming 'proselytes of the gate' at the instigation of the missionary, develop sundry vices in the course of the process. Any one who, on a suidden, accepts- ideas which are not native to him, and practices which are not hereditary, becomes unnatural. He loses, rather than gains, by the process. Contact with the higher types of civilization has not always elevated the lower. It is so much easier for the latter to assimilate the vices, than to imitate the virtues of the former; and the healthy relation between the two, when they happen to be brought into contact; is not that the higher should force</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHY IN ITS NATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS. 65 its customs or practices, its Religion, or Government, or Phi- losophy upon the lower-still less that the lower should try to extinguish the higher-but that each should tolerate the other, and gain from contact with it, as much as it can healthily assimilate. It follows that it is not only a weakness, it is practical folly for the votaries of any one type of civilization to act upon the principle " this is the best for all mankind." A system of belief or practice which is not indigenous-even although it is the outcome of a higher civilization, developing itself elsewhere-if transplanted to a foreign soil, is doomed to failure ab initio. If it seems to succeed for a time, its success is always more apparent than real; and in a vast number of instances, the reactions are stupendous. The reason is that the old currents of belief and practice, which were hereditary race-elements, continue to operate silently, underneath the new "stream of tendency." Differentiation is of course incessantly at work, never ceasing for a moment of time amongst any people: but the healthful changes are always slow and gradual ones, which do not record themselves at once. If written at the time, it is by a sort of invisible ink, which only becomes apparent after being subjected to the fire. If, on this matter, we appeal to history-wisely recorded and interpreted-we find that, although it has been possible to force new laws, manners and customs, even a new Language, Philosophy, and Religion, on a conquered people, the success of the victor has been a deceptive triumph. The conquered people are crushed for a time. They are humiliated, perhaps made sullen by defeat; but they are usually ready for a fresh trial of strength, at the earliest possible opportunity. By the curious glamour of reaction from antiquated habit, what has been artificially introduced, even by conquest, may be welcomed for a time; and it is almost certain to be hailed by those who appreciate novelty; but the superior race, thrusting its latest ideals on one with which they have no constitutional affinity, may-by its sudden dominancy-destroy the native bloom of character and habit in the inferior people; while a subsequent reaction may drive the latter race to a lower level than that from which it was apparently but artificially raised. It must be admitted that some crude developments, or diseased products, of our humanity may be dealt with at once by drastic processes; that is to say, by the rapid incoming of new, and at times of militant influence. Such an advent of beneficent power may legitimately extinguish, by its strong hand, the excesses of a rudimentary civilization; and humanity at large is the gainer by such a process of physical and moral M. 5</page><page sequence="7">66 PROFESSOR KNIGHT: surgery combined'. Nevertheless, in all cases of one civilization appealing to another, the transitions should be as gradual as it is possible to make them. Even were it possible artificially to combine two races (a higher and a lower), as provinces can be territorially annexed, this would not prove either, first, that all the members of the lower were able to receive the higher type of thought, feeling and action; or secondly, that the higher might not be injured by receiving and assimilating the practice of the lower. If a higher race caiinot intermarry with a lower. and have a progeny that is healthful, it is surely worse than useless to attempt a forcible intermarriage of ideas. But what is often aimed at is not the intermarriage of ideas, but the complete substitution of one set for another. It is the inoculation of the lower races, by the opinions of the higher; and the superimposition of the latter on the former, so as to raise them to a new level, by external means. This applies not only to the African, the American, and some of the Asiatic races, but also to several European ones. Contact with the people of a different race amongst ourselves in the West, has often hindered rather than helped their development. The prejudices and the vices of the new race have been transmitted, and even intensified, more quickly than its virtues; while some of the dormant excellencies of the inferior people have died away in the process. On the other hand, there can be little doubt that the introduction of a new type of civilization in the midst of an old one has at times touched the latter in its deepest parts. It has occasionally quickened the development of powers, which have been lying latent for centuries. What has at first seemed a disaster to a nation, which has lived for generations in a particular groove, and been there under the influence of a few provincial ideas, has afterwards led to more than a renewal of its youth. The introduction of elements, which have coa- lesced naturally with those which were verging to decay, has given a fresh lease of life to such a people; and here we reach the sole ground on which the work of the missionary of another creed who aims at being the pioneer of a new civilization can be defended. There is no limit to the influence which may be exercised by the higher races over the lower, if such influence be exerted naturally, -and by wise methods. Turning now from these semi-anthropological considerations, I reach the more strictly philosophical problem of the relation 1 For example, infanticide, slave-dealing, the burning of suspected witches, cruelty to all who differ from you, etc. etc. might be dealt with, as every civilized people now deal with cannibalism.</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY IN ITS NATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS. 67 in which the race stands to the individual, and the individual to the race-or of the many to the one, and the one to the many-in the matter of intellectual system-building. There is no doubt that the two factors in the historic evolution of the human race have been the power of the individual in leading the masses, and the power of the masses in controlling the individual. These two are complementary forces, centrifugal and centripetal. The power of the individual in determining a new forward movement amongst the mass of his contermn poraries is quite as great as any power they can exert in restraining him from a too rapid, it may be a meteoric progress. When a community has sunk into a somewhat monotonous uniformity-whether of belief or of practice-when it has been working steadily on in the grooves of tradition, a longing, half understood at first, begins to arise within it for the appearance of a new Leader, for the guidance of an Individual, for the " Coming Man," who will be able to focus contemporary wants, and to interpret them. In every corporate body-whether it be a State, or a Church, or a Philosophical School-there must be Leaders; and it is by the commanding force of its greater minds and wills, by their individuality and their special power, that all re-formations of opinion and practice are wrought out. The stronger have always given the law to the weaker- although it is also true, as a poet puts it, that " strongest minds are those of whorn this noisy world hears least ": but to suppose that the great movements of History, and the formation of its chief Philosophies, or Social Institutions, have been due to the unconscious working of blind forces is as great a mistake as it is to ignore or undervalue the latter. The brain power of the individual has been a potent factor in the formation of every philosophical system, and it comes out in many ways. It is needed 1st adequately to understand the spirit of the age, 2nd to divine its latent tendencies, and appraise its underworking currents, 3rd to guide it onwards in a wise and fruitful manner, 4th to reconstruct and reinterpret ancient' theories, by%bringing them into vital relation with the present age, and 5th to sow the seeds of future development in a natural manner. These-, and many other points, might now be considered in detail; but as the aim of this paper is rather to urge the importance of the opposite and balancing truth of the influence of Race and Nationality in determining the great systems of opinion, an illustration of this thesis-founded on the contrast between Greek Philosophy, and its Oriental types-may be more appropriate. Greece was the land of the ideal, in every sense of the 5-2</page><page sequence="9">68 PROFESSOR KNIGHT: word; and there it was that the ideal was first made real to the human consciousness. The fascination which the race inhabiting that little promontory of the AEgean has exercised over the thought and the art of the world-over its letters, its science, and its politics-has had no parallel in subsequent history. While each nation has contributed its own share to the progress of humanity-and we may say in general that from the Semitic races we have inherited our Religion, from Greece our Philosophy and Art combined, and from Italy our Law-the Hellenic spirit has ruled the world in a manner altogether unique. This has been due to many concurrent causes. Perhaps the most remarkable feature, in the Greek world taken as a whole, is its manifoldness, and its manifold completeness; in other words the rapid development of the human intellect and genius, in many different directions simultaneously, and its perfection in each; so that the productions of Greece remain to this hour, the admiration and the despair of the world. No subsequent type of civilization has transcended it, so that the great Helleinic achievements remiain in the very forefront of the world's development, even while an "increasing purpose" has been running through the subsequent ages. In the'department of Philosophy, while the speculative thought of the world has of necessity changed, we find in Greece the germns of every subsequent theory; and, what is perhaps of still greater con- sequence, we find the later opinion of the world continually reverting to the positions taken up in the earliest Greek schools. There we find the teachings of Philosophy expressed with the greatest clearness and vigour, as well as subtlety, and we find its distinctive types more sharply defined, than anywhere else, until we reach the Philosophy of the last two centuries. Another general feature in the Philosophy of Greece is the singularly rapid development and succession of its schools, produced, by the active movements of thought within them. One system led on, swiftly and inevitably, to another, the existence of the latter being due to the very completeness which char'acterised its predecessor. This rapid succession of systems was not a symptom of intellectual decay, but of vitality. The quick absorption and assimilation of the elements which nourish the intellectual life of a people is a sign of sustained national vigour. And so, in marked contrast to the uniformity an4d stagnation whichi characterised the brooding East, Greece presents the spectacle of ceaseless activity, and incessant change. This was doubtless due to the manifoldness of the life of the nation, as much as to anything else; and, (to what has been already mentioned) the intellectual reciprocity, or indebtedness of its Philosophy to its Art,,of its Art to its Politics, and its</page><page sequence="10">PHILOSOPHY IN ITS NATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS. 69 Politics to its Religion. Out of the friction of old ideas, and their incessant commingling, inew ones emerged. In contrast with this, in the East where tradition for the most part ruled the national mind, it at the same time repressed and fettered it. There was no free play of thought, to break up the routine of the past, and to interfere with the monotony of precedent. If it was reverence that kept the Semitic mind perennially loyal to a few leading ideas, a certain intellectual timorousness with languor, and love of ease, and other causes, due to climate, race, and temperanment-kept the Eastern mind moving sedately, and at times austerely, along the lines of immemorial tradition. There was no desire for change, no thirst for progress, no demand for liberty, such as we find in the West. Hence the uniformity which characterises the Mythology, the Art, and Government of the East, as well as its Philosophy. We find vastness, rigidity, and sameness. Where there is not repression, there is barbaric glitter, and monotonous splendour. The type of mental and moral character ainong all the Eastern peoples is for the most part the same. It is like the tropical vegetation, of more uniform feature than that which has been developed in the temperate zone. As some one-was it Hegel ?-well re- marked, the jungle is the physical type of the initellectual and moral life of the East; and it was the want of intellect-with its freedom and movement, its endless bright developments- that kept the East so stationary in Philosophy and Religion, as well as in Government and Art, and prevented the rise of the Sciences. A cumbrous and elaborate ritual overlaid the life of the people, with precepts and practices that fettered it. In contrast with this, it was perhaps due to the inherent vigour of the primitive settlers on the rocky peninsula of Hellas, and to the rapid mingling of diverse races-as wave after wave of emigration and of conquest swept westwards, and turned south- wards, from the primitive Aryan home, wherever it was-that the world owes the singular union of flexibility and strength, of force, freedom and pliancy, characteristic of the Greek mind. In Greece, as in the East, climatic causes co-operated with racial tendency; and the physical features of the land-with their variety, and compact beauty-aided the development of national character. Greece was not the land in which Nature could subdue man, or dominate over him. It was pre-emrinently the country in which man would become the interpreter of Nature; in which also he would be able to manipulate her forms, and be a deft and cunning workman in the idealization of them. It was not a land in which a doctrine of nirvana could possibly arise, or be appreciated. The active and subtle intellect of the people, and its aesthetic and athletic spirit combined, prevented this.</page><page sequence="11">70 PROF. KNIGHT: PHILOSOPHY IN ITS NATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS. Thas, from the very first, the philosophy and the mythology of Greece differed from that of the East, and reflected the free creative intelligence of the people. Another feature which characterised the literature and life of the Hellenic race, as well as its Philosophy, was its love of directness, its going straight to the mark, without intricacy, obscurity or twist. Abundant evidence of this is seen in the evolution of its philosophical schools. Its early infantile curiosity, and its subsequent youthful boldness, (often amounting to rashness), are evident; but intellectual thoroughness, and clear-eyed direct intelligence, are dominant throughout. Many of its early thinkers imagined that they had found a single key by which they could unlock the mystery of the universe at large; but, in these early schools, as well as in the later ones, we find an effort to pierce-by the sheer force of thought, as far as thought could carry-beneath the symbols that obscured it, and the metaphors that entangled it. Metaphoric conceptions ruled the East. They ruled the Semitic mind, and coloured the whole religious literature of the Jews, where anthropomorphic ideas had the upper hand. In Greece, on the contrary, from the very first, speculative minds sought to reach the shrine of pure Being, by the avenue of pure Thought. Vagueness, and even mystery, were abhorrent to them. The blue heaven above, and the bright sea around, suggested clearness, as well as depth; and depth without clearness was not esteemed in Greece. Hence vague suggestions were tracked, if possible, to their root; and were analysed, with a view to the removal of the vagueness, by a process of verification. The Greek did not naturally care for, or believe in, vague impulses which he could not name. Distrusting dim monitors within, the Hellenic mind wished that they should all be brought out of their lurking- places into the light, and that they should answer for themselves in the court of logical appeal. In this there was an element of weakness, as well as of strength; but the historical fact to be noted is that in the whole national life of Greece, we see a striving after clear conviction; and this love of light, and perpetual coming to the light,' may be said to have given rise to the long succession of its schools of Philosophy. An equally significant illustration of the influience of Race and Nationality in determirning the characteristics of philo- sophical thought, is to be seen in the modern German " stream of tendency," as compared with the French, and in the British stream, as compared with them both: but, as this may, be discussed,' if not in subsequent articles, in forthcoming books, it is for the present postponed.</page></plain_text>
