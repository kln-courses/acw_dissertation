<plain_text><page sequence="1">MEN, GODS AND POWERS IN THE VEDIC OUTLOOK By KAREL WERNER In the last century the Vedic pantheon served as the best illustration of the theory that the gods of primitive and archaic religions were personifications of natural phenomena. The gods of the Vedas were seen as more recognisably such than, for example, the Greek gods, who had acquired more elaborate anthropomorphic features through Homer's poetic skill, so that their supposed nature-substratum was hardly or not at all detectable. In India the matter seemed clear. Thus Oldenberg believed that the Vedic gods were predominantly deified Naturwesen, agents behind the great happenings and processes of nature. Moreover, he maintained that different gods in the Vedas had reached different stages of anthropomorphism and independence from their nature basis and he made much of the job of determining this degree in individual cases.1 In Britain the main protagonist of a similar view was Macdonell, for whom the fact that the Vedic gods were characterised by "indefiniteness of outline and lack of individuality" was due to their being "nearer to the physical phenom ena which they represented than the gods of any other Indo-European people".2 Following in his footsteps Keith wrote earlier in this century that "unlike the Greek deities it is seldom difficult to doubt that the anthropomorphic forms but faintly veil phenomena of nature".3 Despite the consensus, the Vedic deities refused to fit neatly into the confines of this theory and various difficulties had to be overcome. Numerous gods who clearly could not have had a mture-substratum were explained by a later devel opment of religious creativity, often regardless of their true antiquity. Thus we have inherited classifications such as "agent" gods (e.g. Dhatr and Tvastr), gods "originating in compound epithets" (e.g. Visvakarman or Prajapati) and deifi cations of "abstract nouns" (e.g. Manyu, Sraddha or Kama). According to Macdonell they all were to be explained by the "growth of speculation which is so plainly traceable in the course of the Vedic age".4 Keith also adhered to this view, though he felt somewhat uneasy, as is shown by his remark: ". . . to call them abstract is perhaps misleading; it is not to be supposed that in the period of their creation they were felt to be other than real powers." And he admits that their creation may go back to Indo-Iranian times5 which obviously undermines Macdonell's "growth of Vedic speculation" theory. While Keith was working on his book, The religion and philosophy of the Veda and the Upanishads, Rudolf Otto had already published his masterpiece on The idea of the holy which came out in English translation two years before Keith's own work.6 Otto's work is rightly regarded by many as a turning point in the history of religions, and it has important implications for our understanding of the Vedic tradition, although they have taken a long time to</page><page sequence="2">MEN, GODS AND POWERS IN THE VEDIC OUTLOOK 15 seep through, and have not yet in fact been fully worked out. Otto well knew the naturalistic theories about the origin of religions and had already subjected them to penetrating and critical analysis.7 Now he set against them the power of the "numinous": that which is not apprehended through the mediation of sensory impressions ? however powerful ? and which cannot be purely a rational deduction from them, a result of inference. The experience of the numinous, argues Otto, issues from the fundus animae, from the depth of our consciousness, and sensory data and empirical material of the natural world are only stimuli which provide the occasion for the numinous experience "to become astir". Adopting this approach to the Vedic religion in his work on the Deity and deities of the Aryans,8 Otto maintained that the Vedic gods could not be products of the impact which mere natural phenomena made on human minds. Rather natural phenomena and mental forces bring about the oppor tunity for man to apprehend the presence of the hidden power, the numinous, which may then be personalized into a divine figure. Otto may not have succeeded in his attempt to demonstrate his theory on individual Vedic gods, and his use of the etymological method may be open to criticism; but his general point is clear enough, and deserves to be fully appreciated by Indologists and historians of religions when interpreting Vedic mythology. This is not yet the case, however. The principle of using the phenom ena and processes of nature as a basis for the explanation of the character of some Vedic gods, and particularly of the meaning of mythological events in which they are involved, is still firmly established in some general works on the history of religions. To quote just one recent example, here is Ninian Smart's comment on one of the Vedic hymns referring to the mythical combat in which Indra slew the dragon Vrtra: "Here then is Indra, the mighty storm deity, battling against the serpent Vritra with lightning and thunder. This mythological conflict expresses and explains the drama of the monsoon. Against the moun tains the clouds are piled serpentlike, and Indra releases from them the life-giving waters which flow down to the ocean, enriching the land on their way."9 This simplistic way of interpreting Vedic myths, which goes back to Olden berg (and Sayana), is now totally outdated. Jan Gonda gave a general charac teristic of the Vedic myth when he described it as representing an eternal truth which is repeatedly re-enacted in ritual and in nature.10 But already Norman W. Brown has stressed the cosmogonic significance of the Indra-Vrtra myth11 which will occupy us further below. Mircea Eliade also touched upon this theme. He recognised this myth as being "multivalent": that is to say, possessing simul taneously cosmogonic, naturalistic and historical "valences".12 Thereby he apparently means to say that it is valid or conveys a certain message simul taneously on several levels. Returning to the nature of the Vedic gods, we must record what Gonda had to say about it. The aspect of power behind the Vedic gods was recognised</page><page sequence="3">16 MEN, GODS AND POWERS IN THE VEDIC OUTLOOK right from the start of Vedic studies, but this power was put down merely to natural forces. Gonda goes beyond this crude supposition and suspects subtler forces at play. Vedic gods and demons are to him archetypes or prototypes (Urbilder), hypostases, or representations, of forces, phenomena and influences with which man is confronted on different levels of his experience; they are numinous feelings and life experiences which took on the shape of figures; they are also complexes of factors and potences which are either active or latently present in the universe and in man (Gonda says: in the macro- and microcosmos) and which became symbols; they are structural manifestations of forces ("Totalitaten von Kraftmanifestationen") and they are ideas visible to the inner eye ("anschauliche Ideen") which formed themselves within the human mind; they serve the need for an explanation of cosmic events and help secure man's vital interests, and are therefore treated with purpose.13 In this firework of expressions, hardly translatable from German into English, we can detect echoes of Otto, Jungian depth psychology and modern structuralism. Whatever else we may take out of it, what is abundantly clear from Gonda's expose is the final burial of the theories of the Vedic gods as personifications of natural phenomena, compound epithets and abstract nouns. Perhaps what Gonda was getting at can be paraphrased in the following way: Vedic man experiences reality around and within himself as a structural and dynamic complex of meaningful processes which were mutually interdependent, and which provided the opportunity for numinous feelings to rise in him. These were accompanied by a sense of dependence on a higher power and a sense of mysterium tremendum as described by Otto. Vedic man gave expression to the experience of these processes in spontaneous, inspired creativity through the idiom of images, symbols and myths in which powerful deities performed deeds of archetypal, paradigmatic significance for the life of the Vedic man and his community. To balance out these powerful influences, which made themselves felt in his external life as well as inside him, he re-enacted their "epical" or dramatic dimension ? their meaning as it was expressed by the myths in bal anced, calculated and solemn procedures, that is, through recurring rituals. These periodic performances brought him into a state of relative harmony with himself, nature and his fellow men, thus securing also a measure of social stability. Gonda himself never tried to formulate a comprehensive theory about Vedic deities. His generalizations occur sporadically amidst descriptive passages, philological investigations and textual analyses; but they are important enough to be taken as starting-points for attempts to reassess and deepen our under standing of the nature of Vedic religion in general, and the Vedic gods in particular. On this theme he further says that very often it is the activity rather than the personality of the gods which comes to the forefront: "The poets have no</page><page sequence="4">MEN, GODS AND POWERS IN THE VEDIC OUTLOOK 17 intention of presenting a description of the substance and attributes of a divine figure, rather they wish to throw light on its power, function and beneficial activity". And he further observes that these can often appear independently as divine powers in their own right.14 As he says elsewhere, when it comes to the relation between the personal and impersonal element in the representation of a power, Indians "easily shift their ground, drawing no hard and fast line between both these aspects of the unseen".15 This statement would seem to call for deeper analysis of the philosophical basis of this Indian attitude towards the unseen, which can also be detected in most subsequent systems of Indian thought. But Gonda takes it merely as one of the features of a lower stage in the evolution of Indian thought: "... the ancient Indian did not yet (noch nicht) sharply distinguish between the mental and the material (Geist und Stoff), the living and the lifeless, person and non-person, abstracts and con cretes, substances and qualities attached to these, processes and states".16 We can see how Gonda wrestled with the fluidity of the nature of the Vedic gods, being caught in the age-old pattern of Western thought in terms of the substance and attributes once introduced by Aristotle's physics and dismissed only by physicists of this century. He also contradicts himself when he says, first, that the poets wanted to describe not the substance and attributes but the power and function of a god, and then, that they did not yet distinguish between these categories. Dealing with power as such, Gonda says that it can manifest itself in the Vedas in different ways and on different beings and things, but cannot be described by one word such as mana, because there are many powers in the Vedas (e.g. ojas, the creative, vital power, ayu, the life-core, amhas, tejas, mahas, sravas, tapas, etc.). But one power was already quite fundamental in the Rg Veda and that was brahman. It had a carrying and supportive function and could make grow, cause to be greater any god who was filled with it; it was the power inherent in mantras (the Vedic hymns) and in the Vedic rites, it healed diseases and could free from evil. As the basis and the support of the whole universe it was called skambha. Its universality as the essence, source and goal of all reality was fully spelt out in the Brahmanas.17 Gonda thus recognises a higher spiritual aspect in the Vedic search for a global power. Contrary to this Dandekar, leaning on anthropological theories, put forward a view that the Vedic gods were subservient to an all-pervading somatic magic potence, a kind of "soul-stuff" which "was common to the religious ideologies of many primitive peoples"; it was named by anthropologists orenda or mana and its Vedic name was asu. "This magic potence was shared by gods, human beings, animals, trees etc. ? of course in varying proportions. It was on account of this that the Vedic man made no sharp distinction between spirit and matter, living and lifeless, person and thing, abstract and concrete, substance and attri bute etc."18</page><page sequence="5">18 MEN, GODS AND POWERS IN THE VEDIC OUTLOOK Dandekar overestimates the significance of asu which merely means "vitality", the potency of life which of course is universal, having as its seat antariksan and in which individuals share, but which is overshadowed in importance by higher spiritual and mystical elements present even in the oldest strata of the Rg Veda which Dandekar ignores. He recognises a trend towards a kind of philosophical monism only in the last stages in the evolution of the Vedic religion.19 Earlier in his career Dandekar had been preoccupied with man and his under standing of himself in the Vedas, and had treated the theme in a monograph which has been undeservedly neglected.20 Man's position in the context of the Vedic world-view has usually been described rather superficially: man descended from the gods, and was dependent on them, but they needed him for sacri fices.21 Dandekar analysed the relevant passages of the Rgveda and Atharva-veda, and, while he formulated for the first time his theory of Vedic Orendism, he nevertheless showed that there was in the Vedas an essential unity of man and the cosmos, since everything was penetrated by the same life force, asu. Among creatures man occupied the central position, lower than the gods, but was elevated above other beings by his possession of the organ of thinking (manas); and he aspired even higher as he possessed also an organ of inner vision (dhTh), which some individuals (rsis) developed to a high degree. To come to an understanding of the outlook of Vedic man has so far proved an almost impossible task. For thousands of years the Vedas have been hailed as the divine source of wisdom in India and for more than a hundred years they have been regarded as evidence of a primitive, "pre-scientific" or simply lower stage in the evolution of Indian mentality by the criterion of European scholar ship. As mentioned above, Otto's investigations of the numinous, some insights of depth psychology, and better understanding, through the advance of the history of religions, of the idiom of symbolical messages, make all simple inter pretations of the Vedas look completely inadequate. This holds equally true for the nature of the Vedic gods. Their fluidity, indefinite position, and shifting sphere of influence ? combined with an elaborate symbolism accompanying them, and a vast mythological background which transpires through numerous hints without ever being really spelled out ? all this indicates a complex struc ture of beliefs, views, insights and experiences shared among different sections and communities of the Vedic population. Yet it was shared in an unequal way and on different levels of understanding, with perhaps only a small elite of true rsis who may have had a grasp of the meaning of the whole of the living Vedic tradition. Recognition of this complex situation has to be incorporated in the meth odical approach to the task of interpreting the Vedas, particularly with respect to the view which maintains that the rsis, the originators and composers of the hymns, had a grasp of the full meaning of their message, while the recipients had only partial understanding and interest in it. It has also to be assumed that</page><page sequence="6">MEN, GODS AND POWERS IN THE VEDIC OUTLOOK 19 the rsis were themselves aware of this fact; that they adjusted their hymns, and additional comments on them which they would from time to time have made - though none so old has been preserved - to the level of understanding of which the different groups or classes of recipients were capable. In other words the Vedas cannot be fully understood unless we learn to interpret them on several levels. The principle of multi-level interpretation of the Vedas was first recorded by Yaska (Nirukta, 7, 1-2), who mentioned three levels: (i) adhyatmika, relating to the essence, (ii) adhibhautika, relating to beings and elements, and (iii) adhidaivika, relating to gods. Without using Yaska's rather mechanical way of determining on which level a particular verse is to be interpreted, the principle itself and the three levels quoted may prove a very viable hermeneutic help. Some hymns, images or myths clearly have to be understood and interpreted on more than one level simultaneously (in Eliade's parlance: they are "multi valent" or have more "valences"). As to the terminology, only time will show how it is to develop if the multi-level principle of interpretation becomes an established method. The term adhyatmika clearly denotes the realm of meta physical meaning and numinous experience, adhibhautika points to cosmological and existential connotations and adhidaivika undoubtedly refers to the theological-liturgical context. It would be futile to attempt a far-reaching and detailed re-interpretation of the Vedic pantheon at this stage, but what I think can be done is to try to give an outline of some of its main figures and their possible meaning from the three vantage-points mentioned; utilising, of course, results and hints of previous research efforts even though they were not attuned to the method adopted in this paper. The most radical re-interpretation will occur, understandably, on the adhyatmika level. The term itself is, of course, Vedantic. But it is eminently suitable for this purpose, since it emphasises the point that some Vedic hymns contain the vision or experience of the essential unity of man and the world, in the inner, spiritual dimension of reality. This indicates that the Upanisadic brahman-atman doctrine was not a new discovery, but a rediscovery of an old experience. The expression of this experience in the Vedas often takes the form of a cosmogonic myth. The latter, however, does not refer only to a once-and for-all manifestation of the phenomenal world from the transcendental dimen sion, but it is felt to be a recurring event. It can even be viewed as enacted over and over again, almost from moment to moment. In that way the transcendent sustains the phenomenal. One of the main Vedic topics which lends itself to this interpretation is the Indra-Vrtra myth already noticed. Gonda gives a condensed recapitulation and makes some very useful observations, (i) The sunrise after the combat indicates a recreation of the world after Vrtra's rule over it. (ii) Vrtra had held captive and</page><page sequence="7">20 MEN, GODS AND POWERS IN THE VEDIC OUTLOOK completely filled all three worlds; Indra smote him from the earth and sky. (iii) Vrtra's rule actually represents universal disorder, (iv) His death leads to the establishment, that is separation, of heaven and earth.22 Further interpre tation of this myth from the view point of cosmogony was given by N. W. Brown and F. B. J. Kuiper. Brown describes how Vrtra held the cosmic waters, and how he was killed by Indra, who thus released the waters and made them preg nant, thereby initiating the world-creation. Then he says: "Thus by his great deed Indra separated the Sat from the Asat, the Existent from the Non-Existent, converted the Asat into Sat (6, 24 5)".23 The latest recapitulation of the myth is given by J. Miller, who suggests that Vrtra represents the "primeval chaos, inertia and darkness" and also tentatively identifies the waters with "primeval chaos holding all things in potentia", so that Vrtra and the cosmic waters are the same.24 The identification of the two is however unnecessary, and probably wrong. The waters, representing the harbouring quality of the pre-manifest (as well as the unconscious in man) are a link with the phenomenal world, which comes to be when they are made to reveal what they harbour. This is expressed in the myth by the statement that Vrtra (inertia) was their husband when he ruled, and Indra (the active principle) takes his place after the slaying.25 The symbol ism of the myth unveils itself step by step. Vrtra represents the cosmic night, the period of rest, the dimension of latency, the ground of being, the unmanifest timeless essence of reality. The waters represent the potentiality of manifes tation within the unmanifest, the "plenum" character of the pre-creational "void"; and therefore they are symbolised as wives. Indra, the creator of this universe,26 stands for the cosmic power of creation, the dynamism and intelli gence factor of the whole of reality (normally expressed in theistic terms as the divine will and wisdom). The overflowing of the inner dynamism of the un manifest into manifestation (the act of creation) is symbolized by Indra's piercing Vrtra with his sceptre or thunderbolt (vajra) ? which symbolizes the higher enlightening wisdom of the divine. As the new lord of the released cosmic waters, Indra impregnates them, and the first result is the birth of the sun, which symbolizes the presence of the divine wisdom in this world. It is an indication and promise of the possibility that man can see or arrive at truth from below. This cosmogonic myth, which bears all the signs of being pre-Vedic (that is to say, Indo-Aryan, or perhaps even Indo-European) expresses the same message as the Upanisadic teaching on brahman.27 It recurs over and over again in the Rgveda. One other version of it, which also has an Indo-European origin, is the separation of the original unity dydvdprthivi into heaven and earth. It is particu larly important, because it expresses well the notion that the primeval pre creational dimension (and ground of being) is not a chaotic disorder or a blind force, but a divine though unmanifest intelligence.28</page><page sequence="8">MEN, GODS AND POWERS IN THE VEDIC OUTLOOK 21 One of the least recognised versions of the cosmogonic myth in the Vedas is the one represented by Aditi. It was P. Deussen who first recognised in her at least a timid indication of the idea of the unity of the universe, subsequently fully developed in two rgvedic hymns (1, 164; 10, 129). Then, only Gonda pointed out that, besides other meanings, she is identified with the whole universe. But her true adhyatmika significance lies in her motherhood, when that is interpreted as the pregnant plenum-void of infinity. This precedes, and after wards lies hidden behind, the limitations imposed on reality, in its manifested aspects, by its phenomenal fragmentation ? into innumerable shapes and forms of things and beings of this world. Again, by being a goddess, and thus a person (albeit an infinite one), Aditi underlines the "intelligence" character of the pre manifest state; so emphasizing the "ground of being" which supports manifes tation and is identical with the fundus animae. This is borne out by Aditi's being not only mother and father, but also son and everything that ever has been and will be (RV 1, 89, 10). A clearer mythological anticipation of the brahman atman doctrine is hardly possible to imagine.29 In the well-known purusa sukta (RV 10, 90) the primeval "cosmic person", representing the premanifest cosmic intelligence, in the process of manifestation "ascended high" with three-fourths of himself, while "one quarter came to be again down here" (pado 'sya-iha-abhavat punah). "Again" (punah) indicates here the recurring nature of the process of world manifestation. The philosophi cal expression of this whole Vedic teaching on manifestation, using conceptual idiom rather than the previous language of symbolical and mythological imagery, is the often quoted nasadiya sukta (RV 10, 129), inaccurately known as the Creation hymn. Like the older cosmogonic myths, it is the outcome not of mere speculation, but of inner vision; a result of the seers' "searching in their hearts with wisdom". It thus represents their understanding of the origins and essence of the universe; of reality as a whole as well as of man him self.30 The term "That One" (tad ekam) for the unmanifest beyond being and non-being; as well as for the first stage of manifestation ? of being before its polarization and consequent division into multiplicitly ? expresses most clearly the basic unity of the manifest with the unmanifest. Another philosophical expression for this unity, which more clearly than tad ekam figures also as the inner essence of individual beings, is aja, "the unborn". This is called by the Vedas the force that supports the whole universe and that is also the inmost part of man.31 The fact that aja also means "goat" enabled that sense to be used in mythological contexts, so that the cosmic "one-legged goat" (aja ekapad) could be interpreted as a symbol of the "one quarter", i.e. the manifested part, of reality, as distinct from its three transcendent parts. (Cf. also the later expression of ekapad brahman used by Yajfiavalkya to refute inadequate defi nitions of brahman in BU 4, 1, 2-7). The above examples should suffice to show that from earliest times there</page><page sequence="9">22 MEN, GODS AND POWERS IN THE VEDIC OUTLOOK was in the Vedas a dynamic notion of a reality pulsating between the unmanifest and manifest in cosmogonic cycles; likewise between the numinous and phenom enal ? using that term in the sense of what is seen as totally and constantly dependent on the former for its sustenance. This notion of reality was so com prehensive that it combined in itself characteristics normally appearing mutually exclusive: that of a person (purusa); of a dual person (dydvdprthivT); of two opposing forces or persons (Indra-Vrtra); of a dynamic force beyond being and non-being, which is also a force that came to be (tad ekam)\ of a divine mother who is her own son (Aditi); and of an "unborn" base (aja) that is the support or axis (ekapdd) of the "born" world. Yet concern for the ultimate vision and understanding of reality was limited to a minority (as it is today and as it always has been). Far more interest was directed towards another side of manifestation: to the composition of the world and the place of its inhabitants in it, which can be regarded as the ddhibhautika level. Here the world was conceived as composed of an array of cosmic elements, or intelligences (devatds), which also constituted man, the sacrificial animals and, by implication, all other things. This correspondence on the phenomenal level between the cosmic and the individual, illustrated by the merging of the individual constituents of man in death with their cosmic counterparts,32 is the reflection of the ddhydtmika unity in the world of ddhibhautika diversity. But the correspondence goes deeper still. Even ddhibhautika understanding of a reality was remote from the grasp of ordinary minds. The imagination and emotions of the multitudes were better nourished by the poetic use of meta phors: by allegories disguising cosmic relationships or mystical insights as mytho logical events. In such narratives cosmic powers or intelligences, which consti tuted at the same time psychic forces in man, acted as fully-evolved personal gods. This is the adhidaivika level of apprehending reality, and its function was eminently practical. What the seer perceived as essential unity, and the philos opher understood as the cosmic law (which in India has always included what we call the moral law), the multitudes accepted as the will of the gods, expressed in their legendary actions, and reflected in the phenomena of nature. These events were then periodically re-enacted in the drama of ritual, which constantly renewed their impact on the mind and life of Vedic man. Thus was achieved the integration of man into a balanced social order, offering relative security in this life, and a prospect too for the hereafter. At no time, however, was the philosophical, and the ultimate mystical release entirely blocked, from the ritualistic and social cage which developed, and gradually ossified, in the hands of generations of priests. The very fluidity of the Vedic deities was irritating to early Indologists (educated as they were on the neat and artistically-designed Olympic pantheon). Yet it guaranteed to brighter Vedic minds the possibility of seeing through the obscurities, and of setting out to penetrate to the original unity.</page><page sequence="10">MEN, GODS AND POWERS IN THE VEDIC OUTLOOK 23 And so the lines of munis, sramanas, and parivrajakas33 never entirely faltered, leading eventually to new revelations in the Upanisadic gnosis, Jain release, and Buddhist enlightenment.
