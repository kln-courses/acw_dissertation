(All LH numbers refer to Henry Moore catalogue raisonn?.)</page><page sequence="2">Henry Moore and pre-Columbian art BARBARA BRAUN Among the many non-Western influences that Henry Moore assimilated, pre-Columbian sculpture stands out as seminal. Moore is also the modern artist most closely identified with it, having often extolled its "stoniness, truth to material and full three-dimensional conception of form." Although the comparison between his 1929 and 1930 Reclining Figures and the Toltec-Maya chacmool is familiar, his persistent reference to pre Columbian art is less well known. He first encountered it as a student in a provincial art school, almost immediately began using it as a model for his work, and continued to refer to it in every phase of his long and illustrious career as Britain's, and then the Western world's, premier modernist sculptor and monument maker. Today we can see that he used this alien tradition, especially highland Mexican plastic formulae, to popularize still another?modernism?which is defined here as the notion of artistic progress through formal and technical innovation informed by styles of the past (see Glaves-Smith 1981: 74-75). Moore emerged as a sculptor in the early 1920s at a time when the devastation of World War I and the eruption of the Russian Revolution had shattered the coherency of established sculptural tradition. In England, the pre-war experimentation of Jacob Epstein, Henry Gaudier Brzeska, and Constantin Brancusi had become available as a model for a new kind of sculpture. Perhaps even more important was a new theoretical basis for the modern practice of sculpture, articulated by Bloomsbury critics Roger Fry (Vision and Design, 1920) and Clive Bell (Art, 1914). Both these books were reprinted many times throughout the 1920s (Harrison 1981: 103). Fry's book?with its chapters on African, Ancient American, Bushman, and Mohammedan art, alongside those on Giotto, C?zanne, and Renoir?asserted that art all over the world could be scanned for authentic aesthetic experience, and that the classical Western art tradition was imbued with the conservativism of authority. Bell's concept of "significant form," stressing the autonomy and disinterestedness of art, reinforced this view by admitting a whole range of experiences into its practice?not only primitive, non-Western models, but also, say, a devotion to the memory of a Yorkshire landscape, an interest in the shapes of stones and bones, departures from anatomical accuracy, and finally, abstraction (Harrison 1981: 104). Here were the basic precepts for modernist sculpture: a commitment to the unity of all aesthetic experience, the notion ? advanced by Bell?that a work of art need only have sculptural meaning, and permission to range all over the world's sculpture in search of models, as Epstein, Gaudier Brzeska, and Brancusi had done. Moore, too, embraced these tenets at the outset of his career, having discovered Fry's Vision and Design while he was attending Leeds School of Art (1919 1921). "Once you'd read Roger Fry the whole thing was there," he declared, adding, "Fry opened the way to other books and to the realization of the British Museum" (Russell 1973: 23). It was all quite straightforward, he said. Even his working class origins meshed perfectly with modernism's implicit oppositional stance.1 As a scholarship student at the Royal College of Art, Moore accommodated to the demands of the very traditional coursework, such as modeling figures after casts, but pursued his real education elsewhere, in his search for alternatives to the classical humanist 1. He was born in 1898, seventh of eight children, in Castleford, a grim North of England industrial town just outside Leeds, and raised in an environment dominated by coal mines, chemical plants, and potteries. His coal miner father was a forceful and ambitious man with socialist convictions and intellectual interests, who managed (by dint of scholarships) to send three of his children, including Henry, to Castleford Secondary School ? intended for the children of the petit bourgeoisie?so that they could better themselves by becoming schoolteachers. Moore favored his gentler mother, who encouraged his artistic inclinations, which were further reinforced by his high school art teacher. Miss Alice Gostick took him under her wing until he enlisted in the army (1917), and saw to it that he studied sculpture on a veteran's grant-in-aid upon his return. As an older and more disciplined student, Moore flourished at Leeds School of Art, becoming the sole beneficiary of its new sculpture department (academically out of favor until this time), and carefully preparing for his next career move, a scholarship at London's Royal College of Art. At Leeds he connected with Sir Michael Sadler, then vice chancellor of the Leeds University, the first of many prominent, progressive cognoscenti who became his lifelong patrons?in the early years, providing opportunities for advancement and deflecting hostile criticism, and in later years, promoting him to national prominence. As an avid modern art enthusiast, Sadler collected paintings by Turner, Constable, C?zanne, van Gogh, Gauguin, Picasso, and Kandinsky, befriended important artists like Maillol, and even translated Kandinsky's Art of Spiritual Harmony (1914). Once Moore was ensconced at the Royal College of Art, its newly appointed principal, (later Sir) William Rothenstein (who had known Degas, Monet, and Rodin in Paris), became Moore's champion. He</page><page sequence="3">160 RES 17/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 tradition. "There was a period when I tried to avoid looking at Greek sculpture of any kind," he later recalled. "When I thought that the Greek and Renaissance were the enemy, and that one had to throw all that over and start again from the beginning of primitive art."2 Reading Fry had led Moore directly to the British Museum, a vast repository of centuries of colonial plunder, to find what he was looking for. Immediately, he began a dedicated study of archaic Greek, Egyptian, Cycladic, Austral islands, African, Sumerian, and, particularly, Mexican art on regular biweekly visits. "One room after another in the British Museum took my enthusiasm ... a new world at every turn. . . . And after the first excitement it was the art of ancient Mexico that spoke to me most, except perhaps* Romanesque or early Norman. And I admit clearly and frankly that early Mexican art formed my views of carving as much as anything I could do" (James 1966: 33). Ancient Mexican art was especially well represented in the British Museum, which had acquired its first pieces in the 1820s and gradually augmented its collection throughout the nineteenth century? depending mainly on the generosity of colonial officials, travelers, and explorers who brought curiosities home.3 The most notable pre-Columbian accessions were items collected by ethnologist Henry Christy during his Mexican travels in 1856-1857. During the first three decades of the twentieth century, Thomas Athol Joyce was the key figure in shaping and disseminating information about the British Museum's American Antiquities collection.4 In 1923 Joyce transferred eminent Maya epigrapher Alfred P. Maudslay's extraordinary collection of ancient Maya sculptures and casts from the basement of the Victoria and Albert Museum to the British Museum (which had originally declined to take it in 1893). He set it up with great fanfare in a "Maudslay Room"?the first time the museum had ever devoted an entire room to the activity of a living person ? and prepared for the occasion a Guide to the Maudslay Collection of Maya Sculptures from Central America (1923). Joyce's own archaeological excavations in British Honduras (1926 1931) and additional major purchases filled out the Maya collection, at the same time as the British Museum was acquiring extensive holdings of South American material, especially Peruvian pottery (Braunholtz 1970: 43-44). Even though many more of its specimens were in storage than on exhibit?then as now?the museum's ethnographic display still contained, in Moore's words, an "inexhaustible wealth and variety of sculptural achievement (Negro, Oceanic Islands, and North and South America), but overcrowded and jumbled together like junk in a marine store, so that after hundreds of visits I would still find carvings not discovered there before" (James 1966: 157).5 Outside the precincts of the British Museum, there was an equally intensive flurry of professional activity got Moore an appointment as a teacher at the college (1925-1929), and his brother, Charles Rutherston, began collecting Moore's sculpture as early as 1922. Another mentor of this period was Bradford printer and publisher E. C. Gregory, who, beginning in the late 1940s, published the five-volume catalogue raison?e of Moore's work which is known as Lund-Humphries. By the mid-1950s, Gregory, Moore, and Herbert Read were sitting on the same committee of the Institute of Contemporary Art, promoting public sculpture. Thus, from the start, Moore's course was remarkably smooth, combining exceptional talents, extraordinary dedication, and great good luck. From humble beginnings in the Yorkshire working class, he moved swiftly to embrace new ideas and establishment benefactors in his steady climb to success. 2. From an interview with Moore, Horizon, vol. 3, no. 2 (1960). 3. Among the earliest acquisitions were Aztec carvings that had been in the provocative 1825 Mexican exhibition staged by William Bullock in London's Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly. This first European view of large-scale Aztec sculpture included casts of such major monuments as the Calendar Stone (found in 1790 under the Mexico City Cathedral), Stone of Tizoc, and the terrifying Coatlicue, which Bullock had taken during his Mexican travels, alongside botanical specimens, stuffed birds, and ancient and modern artifacts. The collection was given further impetus by the publication of Lord Kingsborough's lavish nine-volume encyclopedia, Antiquities of Mexico (1831-1848)?for which he had commissioned copies of all the Mexican codices in Europe, in hopes of proving that Mexico had been colonized by the lost tribes of Israel. See Honour, p. 178. 4. Appointed curator in the ethnographic department in 1902, Joyce had by 1905 reinstalled the collection. His Short Guide to the American Antiquities in the British Museum (1912) was followed by several excellent unofficial publications based on a card index of some 30,000 museum specimens, including South American Archaeology (1912), Mexican Archaeology (1914), Central American and West Indian Archaeology (1916), and Maya and Mexican Art (1927)?all mainly illustrated with British Museum material. See J. H. Braunholtz, p. 42. Under Joyce's editorship, Man, journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, also became a quasi-official organ of the museum's ethnographic department. Joyce also wrote introductions to the catalogue of the Burlington Fine Arts Club's 1920 "Exhibition of Objects of Indigenous American Art"?an extensive display of ancient American objects from local private collections?and an illustrated edition of Prescott's popular Conquest of Mexico (1922). 5. The pre-Columbian material visible to Moore can be gleaned from a perusal of Joyce's various publications and their plates, as well as from the artist's own recollections and drawings.</page><page sequence="4">Braun: Henry Moore and pre-Columbian art 161 Figure 1.

Following up on Maudslay's Maya initiatives was Herbert Spinden, who, together with Gregory Mason, conducted a New York T/mes-financed archaeological expedition in a largely unmapped part of the Yucatan peninsula (Wauchope 1977: 241 ff.).6 At the same time, Sylvanus Morley, Frans Blom, and Thomas Gann explored the still partly unmapped Mexican, Guatemalan, and British Honduras (now Belize) rain forests and coastal areas in search of unreported Maya ruins, while Edward Thompson dredged the famous sacred well (cenote) at Chichen Itza for archaeological treasure?each one writing about their explorations in both popular and scholarly venues. Gann, a port doctor in Belize City and a fluent writer, was an inveterate bush traveler and explorer who wrote six popular books about his expeditions in Maya land, including Mystery Cities (London, 1925). His accounts also appeared on a regular basis in the weekly London Illustrated News, which beginning in 1923 gave extensive coverage to New World archaeological discoveries.7 This widespread English language coverage of American archaeology appealed to a public whose fascination with lost cities, unknown civilizations, and ancient origins rivals that of today. Moore was certainly not the first modern sculptor to look closely at pre-Columbian forms; Gauguin, Derain, and Brancusi had already paved the way before 1908. Derain's Crouching Figure of 1907 (fig. 1 ) is a rough 6. See also Gregory Mason, S/7ver Cities of Yucatan (New York, 1927). Spinden, a noted art specialist and epigrapher, also wrote A Study of Maya Art, Peabody Museum Memoirs, vol. 6 (Cambridge, 1913), and many articles on the Maya and New World origins. 7. In a May 19, 1923, article in the London Illustrated News on newly discovered Aztec mosaic masks in a Mexican cave, the running head was "The so-called New World has antiquities of no less interest than those of the Old World, and the American archeologists are busily opening up new fields of discovery in their own continent" (p. 864). In the space of two years (1923-1924) Gann wrote more than a half dozen articles on aspects of American archaeology, including reports of Mexican archaeologist Manuel Gamio's current excavations of pre-Aztec remains in the Pedregal</page><page sequence="5">162 RES 17/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 hewn, compact, orthogonal, stone image of a man hugging his doubled-up legs. It is clearly based on a standard type of Aztec lithic sculpture?a static, heiratic, blocky, bilaterally symmetrical seated male figure with flexed legs and crossed arms resting on knees (fig. 2).8 These figures, which have been found in great numbers, were set up in open air, household, and temple shrines throughout the Central Valley of Mexico, as well as in northern and central Veracruz (ca. A.D. 1450-1520). As if alive, they were offered prayers, food, and drink. Aztec sculptures retain a unitary, cubic shape?heightened in this pose by the framing arm position. The blocky mass is subdivided into large curving planes that subsume all unnecessary detail. Everything incidental?anatomical features, decoration, protruding parts?is eliminated or subordinated to the whole; symbolic information is conveyed through incision or low relief; chin, nose, eyes, ears, and hair are carved with little depth ? so as not to disturb the compact outline of the mass. The heavy, hard, solid character of the block of stone is a dominant feature of these sculptures, and it is heightened by the bareness of their either raw and textured, or smooth and highly polished, surfaces.9 Derain's Crouching Figure was exhibited at Kahnweiler's Gallery in 1907, and seen by Brancusi and other Parisian vanguard artists. Sydney Geist has demonstrated the impact of its vigorous carving, blocky proportions, symmetrical design, assertion of material, and retention of mass on Brancusi's 1907-1908 The Kiss (Beckett 1981: 54; Geist 1978: 30-32).10 Brancusi's stone seated female, "La Sagesse" (1908), although more smoothly finished and rounded, shares a similar posture, symmetricality, and compactness. Moore?from the start antagonistic to the classical ideal ? studied pre-Columbian art far more assiduously than did these pre-war modernists. He turned to it as a primary model, becoming something of a scholar of ancient Mexican sculpture (Hall 1965: 102). Fry's Vision and Design had sent him not only to museums, but also to books to study primitive and pre-Columbian material; as they had been for Gauguin, reproductions were an important resource.11 He fondly recalled the many evenings spent during his first year at the Royal College of Art, "when I could spread out the books I'd got out of the library and know that I had the chance of learning about all the sculptures that had ever been made in the world" (James 1966: 32). His notebook jottings further reveal the extent of these researches.12 What books on pre-Columbian art was Moore aware of in the 1920s? He was undoubtedly familiar with Fry's citations in his Vision and Design chapter on Ancient American Art, including Walter Lehmann's Altmexikanische Kunstgeschichte (1922)?from which he made drawings?and Thomas Joyce's above-noted three volumes on ancient Mexican, Central, and South American art. There also can be no question that he knew Joyce's Short Guide to the American Antiquities Collections in the British Museum. Moore also owned, and copied plates from, Lehmann's Kunstgeschichtes das Alten Peru (The Art of Old Peru) (1924), and Ernst Fuhrmann's Mexico III (1922) as well as his Reich der Inka (1922), which he bought in 1923.13 Another, section of Mexico city, the proto-Maya Tuxtla Statuette, his own excavations at Lubaantun and discovery of a Maya site on the Yucatan coast, which he called Chacmool, in honor of a giant statue inside one of its temples, and compared with that of Chichen Itza (in two different articles). 8. Unlike the Derain, Aztec figures don't normally have their heads buried in their arms, although similar ancient West Mexican ceramic and Costa Rican stone representations of males often do. Derain probably saw examples of all these sculptures in the Trocadero. 9. Westheim, 1963, pp. 14-18, first defined the architectonic nature of Aztec sculpture in these terms. 10. Geist suggests that Derain's sculpture was his response to the electrifying Salon d'Automne Gauguin retrospective in late 1906 ? a comprehensive display of the artist's paintings, wood and stone carvings, and ceramics. He characterizes it as a three-dimensional rendition of current Fauvist, especially Matissian, concerns, but skirts the question of pre-Columbian influence on both Derain and Brancusi: "Derain seems to have drawn heavily on an antecedent work [of his], itself the product of a series of influences." Ibid., p. 100, n. 22. Yet the conspicuous pre-Columbian influence on Gauguin's ceramics (see Braun 1986) would logically have pointed these artists toward that tradition. Moreover, certain features of Brancusi's early sculptures, such as his figures' striated hair, as well as some of his later sculptures, particularly The Gate of the Kiss (1938), strongly suggest that the artist had a firsthand awareness of ancient Mexican and Peruvian architectonic forms. 11. Until he could afford to buy many books, Moore was an inveterate library-goer. He explored the Leeds Public library?where he encountered Fry's book?and Rutherston's extensive art library in Bradford, and in London, haunted the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria &amp; Albert) library. 12. For example, the inside cover of notebook 6, 1926, which reads: "Go to V&amp;A Museum &amp; get out Chinese Sculpture by Osvald Siren Volume 4 ?

Both Fuhrmann books are inscribed: "Henry Spencer Moore 1923."</page><page sequence="6">Braun: Henry Moore and pre-Columbian art 163 slightly later, source of reproductions was L'Art Pr?columbien by A. Basier and E. Brummer (Paris 1928), which Moore purchased in 1928. It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of these publications to Moore's creation; in effect, they became sculptural pattern books providing him with a repertory of images during the formative decade of his art. Moore began drawing ideas for sculpture in 1921; by 1928 he had filled many loose sheets and at least six notebooks with hundreds of preparatory drawings for sculptures, as well as exercises that were not translated into sculpture, or were reserved for future use. Among them were many copies of pre-Columbian and primitive sculptures, mainly found in notebooks no. 3 of 1922 1924 and no. 6 of 1926, although notebooks nos. 2 (1921-1922) and 4 (1925) also contain examples. They provide an excellent index to the wide range of art that interested Moore during this formative period, as well as some clues to specific sources of his sculptures (see Wilkinson 1974; 1977).14 Moore later explained the necessity for all these drawings: "When one is young, one has lots of influences mixed up in one's mind so that drawing was a means of generating ideas and also of sorting them out" (Mitchinson 1976: xv). Moore also probably knew Herbert Kuhn's Die Kunst der Primitiven (1923), which contained pre-Columbian art, as well as the 1922 illustrated edition of Prescott's Conquest of Mexico, with an introduction by Joyce. 14. In his detailed examination of Moore's notebook drawings, Wilkinson reveals the comprehensiveness of Moore's art historical studies, ranging from paleolithic to post-impressionist periods, from painting to sculpture, but favoring especially Egyptian, Sumerian, Cycladic, archaic Greek, Etruscan, and African, as well as ancient Mexican sculpture. He points out several drawings of pre-Columbian objects that never got translated into sculptures, including two drawings of a whale (?) in notebook no. 4 derived from an Aztec carved bone illustrated in what he mistakenly identifies as pi. 99 of Ernst Fuhrmann's Mexiko III (1922) (there is no pi. 99 in Fuhrmann 1922); a drawing inscribed Head of Christ in Alabaster/Mexican from an unidentified source in notebook no. 6 (ibid., 1977, p. 150); and four sketches of Peruvian objects?three of which appear in notebook no. 3: a Chimu mosaic earspool with a reversible design of two birds with a common body from the British Museum, two bird studies from a Mochica pot from Chimb?te, and a large study of two heads taken from neck of a Mochica bottle from Trujillo, reproduced in Fuhrmann's Reich der Inka (1922), pi. 51, 15. In each case Moore isolated the figurative elements and ignored the pot. There is also a copy of an Inca silver llama in notebook no. 6 copied from Walter Lehmann's The Art of Old Peru (1924), pi. 109 (ibid., 1974, pp. 39 40). Wilkinson has ignored what is clearly another rendering of a pre Columbian object in notebook no. 2 (on the same page as the earliest sketches of the chacmool) from an unidentified source?a sketch of an ?guana or lizard scaling another object, which appears to be either an hacha or an alabaster vessel. Figure 4. Mezcala mask, Guerrero, Mexico, 1200-1521 (?) (Fuhrmann 1923). Concurrently with his notebook sketches, Moore continued his series of highly accomplished life drawings, which had started as an important part of his rigorous art school training?honing his skills in observing and rendering three-dimensional images on a flat surface?and which culminated in his remarkable World War II shelter drawings. This process of working from reproductions?which had also been Gauguin's practice?has affected Moore's sculpture in important ways, particularly in terms of its scale and unilateral view. When Gauguin used photos as models, he usually translated two dimensional ?mages of three-dimensional artifacts into a two-dimensional painting format, readjusting the scale of his depicted figure to the landscape or still life depicted. Moore, on the other hand, in translating reproductions into three-dimensional objects often failed to account for the immediate relation between their material presence and the human scale of the viewer. He frequently shifted from a monumental into a miniature format without adjustment, and even conceived of some of these large sculptures as capable of being held in the hand. Later on, he had no</page><page sequence="7">164 RES 17/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 /' / ?W / y \ / Figure 5.

The result is a frequently skewed scale.15 Moore's use of photos as sculptural models also seems to have affected the singular orientation of much of his work, so that it looks more like high relief than freestanding plastic form. Moore's first modernist carvings were executed between 1922 and 1924. In addition to the example of Derain and Brancusi, their major stimulus, undoubtedly, was what he later termed the "simple, monumental grandeur [and] . . . massive weightiness" of Aztec carvings (Moore 1981: 66), as well as other pre-Columbian sculptural styles?Olmec, Mezcala, Teotihuacan, Toltec, and Huastec?which have many of the same characteristics. His first fully three dimensional sculpture, the 1922 Mother and Child (fig. 3), combines an awareness of the Crouching Figure and the British Museum's Xochipili (fig. 2), or a similar seated Aztec figure.16 The choice of material (rough Portland stone), unfinished stone base, orthogonal projection of the cubic mass, severe full forms, emphatic hand gestures, and absence of anecdotal elements?except for the typically Aztec sandal fastening etched on the figure's ankles?point to the basalt Xochipili, patron deity of the cult of pleasure, as the major source. In preliterate ancient Mexico, such geometric simplification, muting of incidental detail, and overall formal clarity, in combination with precise symbols and broad hand gestures, was a major means of expressing a particular deity's identity. Certain crucial elements of Moore's sculpture deviate from this Aztec model. For one thing, the mother's face derives not from Aztec but from Mezcala style stone carving, product of an as yet little understood ancient 15. These ideas were suggested to me by a reading of Stewart 1984, pp. 89-92. 16. Reproduced, for example, in Joyce, Mexican Archaeology, pi. v, and Fuhrmann, Mexiko III, pi. 4. The most extensive treatment of Moore's pre-Columbian sources is Wilkinson 1977, 1979, 1981. His discussion is most useful in documenting some of the material available to Moore; however, he fails to recognize many of Moore's pre-Columbian sources.</page><page sequence="8">Braun: Henry Moore and pre-Columbian art 165 Mexican culture in Guerrero. Mezcala masks, made of hard, polished stone, typically have flat planes and schematic features indicated by raised welts, sharp edges, and concavities symmetrically distributed in a square or trapezoidal face. Moore probably found the source of the mother's face in Fuhrmann's Mexiko III, plate 10 (fig. 4), an alabaster head of a man in Vienna's natural history museum; there is a striking correspondence between their raised rectangular eyes, long, flattened noses, and straight mouths. A Moore drawing of a head in notebook 6 of 1926 inscribed Head of Christ in Alabaster Mexican (fig. 5b), which presumably postdates Mother and Child, resembles both the mother's and the Mezcala heads. In this earliest appropriation of pre-Columbian art, Moore has already established a working formula for the future. In the interest of a reductivist aesthetic, he has adapted the plastic conventions of Aztec figurai sculpture, as well as certain of its expressive traits: the head turned at an angle to the major axis (subtly altering the essential symmetry), gestural hands, attached base. At the same time, he has ignored their native meaning, most conspicuously by transforming the image's gender from male to female (although apart from the title, the baby, and a hint of breast, you wouldn't necessarily know it), and articulating a favorite personal theme: the protective mother with her child. And, by piecing together a mosaic of diverse sources (that he has experienced both first- and secondhand), he has arrived at his sculptural image?via a process of synthetic bricolage once more reminiscent of Gauguin.17 But because Mother and Child is an immature work, the composite image is still imperfectly fused, and the disparate sources can be readily identified. Another alien element involves the baby figure, whose peculiar configuration and conjunction with its mother was also inspired by (previously unidentified) pre-Columbian sources. In conforming his image to the lithic block, Moore has squeezed the baby between the mother's torso and flexed legs, so that its head and arms emerge from her side. In the Aztec canon, mother and child ?mages, serving domestic rather than public purposes, were commonly made of clay rather than stone, and usually show the mother stiffly clutching an inanimate, doll-like child. But an unusual aplite representation of Tlazolteotl, Aztec goddess of childbirth, confession, Figure 6. Tlazolteotl, Aztec, 1330-1521, Dumbarton Oaks Pre-Columbian Collection, Washington, D.C. and absolution, now at Dumbarton Oaks (fig. 6), probably inspired Moore's conceit. It shows her giving birth Indian style, delivering her baby in a squatting position.18 Moore might have seen a reproduction of this striking sculpture, which was published by E. T. Hamy in Paris (1906), or a replica of it in the Trocadero Museum, on his biannual Paris trips (beginning in 1922).19 He adapted this image of the emergent baby to the needs of his sculpture by shifting it to another part of the female anatomy and turning it on its side. Still another pre-Columbian model, visible in books Moore knew at this time, furnished the baby's head (fig. 7).20 Enigmatic infantile representations known as 17. For a documentation of this working method, see the discussion of Moore's creation of Locking Piece, based on an extended interview with the artist, in Hall, December 11, 1965. 18. Since its publication more than eighty years ago, this sculpture has captivated many people, including Diego Rivera, who pictured it in one of his murals. Yet several pre-Columbian experts have questioned its authenticity, citing the rarity of this pose in the stone medium ? it is most common in painted codices?and its unusual "cabinet" size and carving technique. 19. Moore has stated, "From 1922 on I went once or twice a year to Paris?until 1932 or 1933 I didn't miss a year." Cited in Wilkinson, 1977, p. 15. 20.

(Lehmann 1922). were-jaguar babies are a hallmark of the Olmec style that flourished on the Gulf Coast of Mexico in southern Veracruz and western Tabasco, ca. 1000-400 b.c. They were made of highly polished hard stone or ceramic, mostly on a small scale, sometimes in the form of votive axes, and are characterized by a pear shaped head, either bald or with a tight-fitting cap, a tall (cleft) forehead, a flat, snub nose, puffy cheeks, and, especially, by a peculiar mouth that seems to combine the attributes of a wailing baby and a snarling jaguar. All of these figures, even the smallest, give an impression of power and monumentality regardless of their size, because they are so self-contained. The most conspicuous instance of Moore's reliance on Olmec sculpture is his 1926 Baby's Head (LH 35),21 but in fact it is only one of several carvings of the 1920s reflecting this source. Although essentially resembling Aztec sculptures, Olmec figures are more robust, weighty, and imposing, yet at the same time, tauter and more animated, as if imploding with energy. Their proportions, internal spatial rhythms, and fragmentary state (reflecting great age and ancient mutilation) further differentiate them from the Aztec. Moore's 1924 Seated Figure (fig. 8), which appears monumental although it measures only ten inches high, resembles an Olmec monument from Misantla, and Olmecoid boulder and pedestal sculptures from Tiquisate, on the south coast of Guatemala (fig. 9). Two half-length mother and child carvings of 1924 (figs. 10 and 11) are also indebted to the same sources; their muscular physiques, smooth and slowly curving volumes, evoke, like Olmec monuments, a mythic race of giants. Maternity's close-fitting caplike hair clearly derives from the distinctive helmets worn by Olmec colossal heads and babies, which were illustrated in books Moore knew,22 and her dour, impersonal expression and thick elbow, wrist, and neck joints recall those of many Olmec figures. Moore once commented that these early carvings had no necks because he was afraid to weaken the stone by undercutting, but an equally plausible explanation is the neckless condition of his Olmec models. The peculiar half length, the manner in which mother holds child, and the unilateral conception of Maternity (fig. 10) suggest a derivation from either figurai reliefs on Olmec "altars" (fig. 12), which were reproduced in magazine articles announcing their discovery,23 or from smaller three-dimensional images of a figure holding a child ? such as an elegant Mezcala style specimen (fig. 13) illustrated in Lehmann (1922: fig. 16). While to us they recall Christian madonnas, such images probably had dynastic meaning, heralding the birth, confirmation, or presentation of the chief's heir. Mother and Child (fig. 11), the more compelling and larger of the two (22!/2" vs. 9" high) sculptures, was begun in 1924 and completed in 1925, after Moore returned from a trip to Italy. It reverses Moore's usual image of the enclosing mother by having, in turn, the child envelop the mother's head, and thereby recalls were-jaguar baby headdresses worn by Olmec figures. At the same time, it evokes totemic images from African and Northwest Coast Indian cultures,24 as well as 21.

Upon completing this Mother and Child, Moore abandoned the theme for five years. He took it up again in 1929, returning to the same Olmec models: the half-length Mother and Child (1930) (LH 82), for example, is remarkably close in pose to the lateral figures on La Venta altar 5 (fig. 12), while a succession of mothers and children with taut contours, repetitive curving internal planes, and glossy surfaces (fig. 14) seem kin to the Mezcala example (fig. 13). In 1925 Frans Blom and Oliver La Farge discovered a spectacular Olmec monolith (about 4!/2 ft. high) on the summit of a volcano in the Tuxtla mountains, representing a seated human figure wearing as a headdress a face of a were-jaguar baby. At the nearby site of La Venta they cleared and photographed another half-dozen Olmec monuments, including a colossal head and several so-called altars. Reports of new archaeological discoveries?the highly readable account of their expedition, Tribes and Temples, was published in 1926?public fascination with a mysterious culture that could produce such powerful Figure 8.

Nor was Moore the only English sculptor to be stimulated by Olmec monumental sculpture. Frank Dobson, twelve years Moore's senior and a cherished colleague, whom Bell, Fry, and other critics championed as bearer of Gaudier-Brzeska's torch and Epstein's rival, was also an avowed student of primitive art.26 His Baby's Head (1920), ManChild (1921), and Seated Torso (1923)?all exhibited between 1921 and 1924?show that he too was examining Olmec colossal heads, were-jaguar babies, and seated figures 25. For example, Joyce, on a visit to New York, saw a film on Maya ruins made by Blom at the Explorers Club. Blom in turn visited the British Museum Maudslay show in 1923 and was in contact with Maudslay. In England again in 1930, Blom visited Joyce, who was himself involved in the 1931 expedition to the Mexican Gulf Coast area, which he published in Man 1931. See Robert L. Brunhouse, Frans Blom, Maya Explorer (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, 1976). 26. Moore's respect for Dobson can be seen by the fact that he suggested him for the sculpture professorship at the Royal College of Art, which he himself was temporarily filling at this time.

Once again, Roger Fry, in his Vision and Design chapter extolling prehistoric cave painting, must have provided the initial impetus. More direct precedents included works by Brancusi, Gaudier Brzeska, and Moore's contemporary, Leon Underwood (1901-1975). One of Moore's earliest carvings, the marble Dog (1922) (fig. 15), is abstracted into a compact mass of uniformly smooth, rounded volumes and jagged planes?resembling both Gaudier's cubist vorticist animal sculptures (such as the Museum of Modern Art's Birds Erect (1914) and Underwood's Nucleus (1923), which treats mass as a complex series 27.

Gaudier and Underwood pointed the way, but Moore's own scrutiny of the Aztecs' synthetically simplified natural forms?stone representations of serpents, coyotes, dogs, and jaguars?provided the means. He appears to have been attracted to their tense poise and feral vitality, as his later comment about an Aztec rattlesnake in the British Museum makes clear: "Although the snake is coiled into a most solid form, it Figure 14. Moore, Mother and Child, 1932 [LH 73]. has a real air of menace, as if it could strike at any moment" (Strachan 1983: 24). He characteristically lifted certain features of these representations, mixing and matching them into his own composite figures. Dog's schematic, squared-off features, cubic shape, muscular curves, and crouching stance suggest a combination of the almost caricatural paws, eyes, and ears of a small onyx ocelot (reliquary) from Teotihuacan in the British Museum or of a similar huge stone Aztec jaguar (a container called a cuauxicalli for the deposit of sacrificed hearts (fig. 16) or the stylizations of an Aztec descending fire serpent in the British Museum and a Colima ceramic dog?respectively reproduced in Joyce (1912), Lehmann (1922), and Kuhn, Die Kunst der Primitiven (1923).

Moore, Dog, 1922 (Strachan 1983). pick up the notion of menacing nature by isolating the creature's blunt head and mouth.30 During these formative years, Moore exploited yet another category of ancient Mexican sculpture, carving more than a dozen masks and heads between 1921 and 1930. The rounded forms, highly polished surface, and unusual shape o? Moore's verde di prato Mask of 1924 derive from Mezcala style masks (fig. 20a, b). Most of them, however, are based on stone masks of the Teotihuacan and Aztec cultures. Like the latter, and primitive-inspired heads by Brancusi and Modigliani, Moore's masks are unindividuated?ageless, sexless, expressionless?never suggesting portraits. The form of the earliest work?preceded only by a slate relief of a head inspired by Gauguin carvings?a small alabaster head of 1923 (fig. 5a), mirrors the standard trapezoidal shape, broad face, flattened planes, half-opened thin lips, and horizontally truncated forehead of stone masks associated with classic period Teotihuacan styles (ca. 200 B.c.-A.D. 700) (fig. 21). The preeminent Mexican archaeologist Manuel Gamio's publication of his major excavations at Teotihuacan in 1922, La Poblaci?n del Valle de Teotihuacan, stimulated public interest in this material at precisely the time Moore began examining it. Toward the end of this period, between 1927 and 1930, Moore carved more than a half-dozen masks based mainly on Aztec models, which resemble earlier Valley of Mexico masks but are more realistic and rounded, less abstract and geometric in format. His sources were the usual British Museum pre-Columbian collection and book reproductions, particularly Joyce's 1927 Mexican and Maya Art and Basier and Brummer's L'Art pr?colombien (1928)?the fly leaf of his copy is inscribed "Henry Moore 1928"?which contained over thirty plates of ancient Mexican masks in the British Museum and Mus?e de l'Homme. A number of Moore's masks seem almost direct translations of images in these volumes, including these striking (but hardly exhaustive) correspondences: Mask of 1927 (fig. 22)?owned by his daughter Mary?which originally had inlaid eyes, and an obsidian "Aztec period" mask in the British Museum (fig. 23); Skull Mask (1928) (fig. 24) and the mask of Xipe Totee, Aztec god of spring renewal and grisly patron of human sacrifice by flaying (fig. 25a), as well as the Aztec mosaic-encrusted, stone, and rock crystal skulls, all in the British Museum. While experts have recently questioned the authenticity of several of these Xipe masks, as well as of the rock crystal skulls (Pasztory 1980), in the period under Figure 16. Giant jaguar, Aztec, ca. 1450-1521, Museo Nacional de Antropolog?a, Mexico City. 30. Possibly inspired by Moore's animal sculptures based on Aztec works, American sculptor John Flannagan in the 1920s and 1930s produced a distinctive series of stone animals, often embedded in rocks. They draw on the native American disposition to reveal the forms and forces inherent in nature by playing on an ambiguity between natural and cultural forms.</page><page sequence="14">Braun: Henry Moore and pre-Columbian art 171 %J Figure 17.

(Kuhn 1923). discussion they were esteemed as prize specimens of Aztec refinement and savagery. A few Masks of 1929 appear to be informed by similar Aztec models combined with still others. One such mask (LH 61) draws on aspects of the famous (severed) head of the Aztec goddess Coyolxauhqui ? which looks a lot like the Xipe masks, and was also reproduced in Basier and Brummer's book (p. 86)? and Olmecoid colossal heads. Perhaps the most striking example (fig. 25b), a mask in Sir Philip Hendy's collection, resembles both the Xipe Totee mask and Picasso heads of the late 1920s. Finally, two additional masks of 1929 and 1930 (LH 64 and 77) are apparently indebted to Teotihuacan masks reproduced in Basier and Brummer (pp. 43ff.). As will be seen below, a number of these heads are nearly identical to the heads of the reclining figures that Moore was developing at this time. For example, figure 22 correlates with the head of West Wind, and the Hendy Mask (fig. 25b) with that of the Leeds Reclining Figure. Moore's repertory of pre-Columbian models during the 1920s thus derived from an assortment of ancient Mexican cultures widely separated in time and space, yet it is as if Moore had perceived that the artistic production of these disparate cultures shares certain basic formal traits, which gives them a broad stylistic unity. As Paul Westheim (1963: 15-19) has suggested, they are characterized by an architectonic discipline and symmetrical order, and their mass enfolds as a cubic unity, subdivided into large planes that absorb all detail unnecessary to the effect of the whole. Even the symbol-laden imperial cult objects reserved for Tenochtitlan's sacred precinct (e.g., the terrifying colossal Coatlicue covered with skulls and extruded hearts, reproduced in Joyce (1912))?which never interested Moore?adhere to the shape of the closed stone block. The heavy, hard, solid character and masterful working of the (usually volcanic) stone material also unites these sculptures (Westheim op. cit.: 18). Thus, it can be seen that Moore's intensive eclecticism during the 1920s operated within certain well-defined stylistic parameters, insofar as his principal non-Western sources were concerned. This highland tradition, emphasizing sculptural</page><page sequence="16">Braun: Henry Moore and pre-Columbian art 173 stability, sturdiness, density, cohesion, restraint, planarity, angularity, and concision, stands apart from the lowland Maya tradition in Mesoamerica, which is marked by "a tendency to overelaboration," as the great Mayanist Maudslay himself put it (Joyce 1923: 54). Predominantly a narrative art of refinement and flamboyance, expressed in nuanced reliefs, carved in porous limestone or modeled in plaster, Maya monumental sculpture is altogether at odds with the highland norm of robust three-dimensionality, geometric stylization, self-containment, and hard stone materials. So, while Moore had equal access to Maya art?through the British Museum's newly installed Maudslay room and book and journal reproductions? and could hardly have failed to admire the technical skill of Maya stone carving so evident in the Museum's magnificent Yaxchil?n lintels, he did not emulate it; he saw it as visually far too similar to some of the forms favored by the discredited Western classical tradition. What was the special appeal of this ancient Mexican highland tradition to Moore? And what did it mean to him? Why, when other primitive or archaic carving traditions were equally available as models?Gaudier had looked to Easter Island, Epstein to Africa, Brancusi to Rumanian carving?did he turn to it so ? ii' rSmJ^TlMiT ?'"'ifii Figure 22.

Its stoniness, by which I mean its truth to material, its tremendous power without loss of sensitiveness, its astonishing variety and fertility of form invention and its approach to a full three-dimensional conception of form, make it unsurpassed, in my opinion, by any other period of stone sculpture. Sylvester 1957, xliv Much of this statement is self-explanatory: the ancient Mexican stone carving tradition was especially highly developed, exhibiting a surpassing formal vitality and plastic invention, and a greater variety of models than any other. Moreover, it struck a familiar chord, 31. At this time, all art outside the Western "great tradition" was perceived as part of the same primitive continuum. But Moore's reference to African, Cycladic, Egyptian, and archaic Greek sculpture was cursory as compared to pre-Columbian art. See Wilkinson 1984 for documentation of Moore's other non-Western sources.</page><page sequence="17">174 RES 17/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 Figure 23. Mask, Aztec, ca. 1200-1521, The British Museum, London (Joyce 1914). tapping, even validating, his youthful experiences in Yorkshire?and reconfirming Fry's and Bell's dicta that authentic aesthetic experience could be found anywhere. Less obvious, however, is Moore's statement concerning Mexican sculpture's "stoniness," "truth to material," and "power without loss of sensitiveness"; often reiterated, it provides a clue to his complex attitudes toward ancient Mexican art. By "stoniness," the single word he used most frequently to characterize Mexican art, he meant formal qualities of density, hardness, gravity: "[sculpture should be] hard and concentrated and should not be falsified to look like soft flesh [but] should keep its hard tense stoniness," he said in 1934 (Leeds City Art Galleries 1982: 23). "Stoniness" also referred to technical features. It implied a carver's keen understanding of, and intuitive response to, the inherent peculiarities and expressive possibilities of material: "Every material has its own individual qualities. It is only when the sculptor works direct, when there is an active relationship with his material, that the material can take its part in the Figure 24. Moore, Mask (skull), 1928 (Russell 1961). shaping of an idea," he continued (ibid.). "Stoniness" was thereby conflated with "truth to materials" and "direct carving." Moore's experimentation during the 1920s with a wide variety of stones?portland, mansfield, hornton, hoptonwood stone, alabaster, verde di prato, serpentine, African wonderstone, marble, slate, and so on?appears to have been an attempt to explore their special properties in these terms. Desire for direct engagement with material was a vestige of Arts and Crafts Movement theories about the expressive possibilities of each medium. Gauguin had insisted on making pottery as the ancient Peruvians made it, manipulating the clay without recourse to a mechanical (and hence somehow unnatural) wheel. In the early twentieth century, Brancusi was the chief exponent of direct carving, which was also championed by Gaudier, and later by Moore, Dobson, Underwood, and many of their contemporaries, becoming a sort of battle cry of modernism?a moral imperative to reject an "effete" nineteenth-century academic art practice. Technically, this also meant refusing to copy from a plaster model with a traditional "pointing machine or</page><page sequence="18">Braun: Henry Moore and pre-Columbian art 175 calipers"; aesthetically, it meant upholding a virtuous new kind of form determined by the creative process itself (Geist 1978: 5-6). But the ideology of direct carving was also tinged with romantic and condescending notions about the production of primitive art. Moore derived the linked notions of direct carving, truth to materials, and a return to the primitive from Gaudier, whose 1916 biography by Ezra Pound greatly influenced him.32 Gaudier had identified the modern sculptor as a man who considers "light voluptuous modeling" as insipid, whose "work is nothing more or less than the abstraction of his intense feeling . . . and has no relation to classic Greek, but... is continuing the tradition of the barbaric peoples of the earth (for whom we have sympathy and admiration)."33 As an instinctual expression of raw, unmediated feelings, barbaric art was, in this view, purificatory and revitalizing, a means of redeeming an overly rational, desiccated civilization. Primitive peoples, by implication, had no capacity for conceptual expression, since their art was not a result of conscious aesthetic decisions. Moore's comments about Mexican sculpture suggest that he embraced it in precisely these terms. In 1924, for example, he told Rothenstein that "Donatello was a modeller and it seems to me that [it is] modelling that has sapped the manhood out of Western sculpture" (James 1966: 37). In 1941 he wrote, "[Primitive art] makes a straightforward statement, its primary concern is with the elemental, and its simplicity comes from direct and strong feeling. . . . The most striking quality common to all primitive art is its intense vitality. It is something made by people with a direct and immediate response to life" (Sylvester, ed., 1957: xliii). To Moore, Mexican sculpture was an originary, primitive art. Its aggressive qualities?at various times he characterized this art as hard, strong, tough ? presented a manly aesthetic counter to a Western tradition gone effeminate and soft. Although Moore focused primarily on the formal and technical aspects of ancient Mexican art, his interest in it was by no means confined to these qualities, although the Moore literature insists that this was the case. His attentiveness to a number of the more grisly and macabre Aztec representations?deities embodying death, flaying, and decapitation ? suggests that he was interested in their content as well as form. The language he used to describe Mexican sculpture, e.g., "Mexican sculptures have a cruel hardness that is the opposite of other qualities I like in European art" (Strachan 1983: 16), and the models he chose to imitate?menacing Aztec animals, gruesome Xipe heads, Olmec were-jaguar babies?implicitly refer to its savage content. And it is his perceived Figure 25. (a) Mask of Xipe Totee, Aztec, ca. 1200-1521, The British Museum, London; (b) Moore, Mask, 1929, Leeds City Art Galleries. 32. "Another book [besides Fry] that I found a great help and an excitement was Ezra Pound's book on Gaudier-Brzeska," he said in 1961. 33. This was reprinted in Pound's Gaudier Brzeska A Memoir (London, 1916), pp. 13, 35, from his essay in Blast and a letter to the editor of the Egoist, both 1914.</page><page sequence="19">176 RES 17/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 correspondence of form and content that is, I believe, the key to his sustained attraction to pre-Columbian art. Another Englishman of similar background, D. H. Lawrence, shared this affinity for Mexico. Both were working-class sons of miners from Yorkshire and were highly emotional artists. Since Moore avowed that "it's been novelists if anything who have had the biggest influence on me ... in coloring one's outlook, one's growth" (James 1966: 50), and since he greatly admired Lawrence, I suspect that his notions about Mexico resembled, possibly even derived from, those of Lawrence. Lawrence was obsessed with Mexico as a counter to the sterile modern European industrial society alienated from its natural roots. "The Indian, the Aztec, old Mexico?all that fascinates me and has fascinated me for years," he wrote in a 1921 letter. "There is glamour and magic for me. Not Buddha ... so finished, per fected and fulfilled . . . and without possibilities . . ." (Moore, ed., 1932: 677). At first Lawrence turned to Italy and Sardinia, and then to Australia, to escape the Europe he despised. But it was in New Mexico and Mexico that he felt most at home and in touch with the primordial. "I like it here," he wrote after arriving in Mexico, "I don't know how, but it gives me strength, this black country. It is full of man's strength, perhaps not woman's strength, but it is good, like the old German beer-for-the heroes, for me" (ibid.: 763). As the subject of one of his novels, The Plumed Serpent, of a short story called The Woman Who Rode Away, of essays titled Mornings in Mexico, and of many letters, Mexico seemed both to fascinate and to repel him, representing a possibility of renewal, and at the same time a return to the savage, what he called the dark currents of the blood. Many of his Mexican period works focus on brutal Aztec sacrificial rites. The 1922 Taos poems are evocations of Mexican ferocity, associating the New Mexican eagle with Aztec heart sacrifice. The Plumed Serpent (1926) is about substituting an effete Christianity by a revivified ancient sacrificial cult of Quetzalcoatl ? an indigenous renaissance. The Woman Who Rode Away also invokes Aztec human sacrifice in sexual terms (as the phallic thrust of the sacrificial knife) (Keen 1971: 553-557; Honour 1975: 187). Lawrence's attitude toward Mexican Indians mirrors his ambivalent feelings toward women (he had been, like Moore, deeply attached to his mother): he both despised and idealized them, seeing them as embodiments of a primordial sensuousness tinged with sadomasochism. Embracing Edward Tylor's evolutionary (and racist) cultural scheme (from savage to barbaric to civilized social levels), he saw the Indians as "a black savage mass." "They are half civilized, half wild. If only they had a new faith they might be a new, young, beautiful people," he wrote in a 1923 letter (Moore, ed., 1932: 744). Although the indigenismo of the ongoing Mexican revolution clearly affected Lawrence by directing his attention to native forms, his attitude toward the revolution itself was negative. He embraced a fantasy, not a reality, of Mexico, which harked back both to romantic nineteenth-century notions of the noble savage and to colonial prejudices about "savagery." Lawrence responded to the relics of Mexico's past with the same mixed attraction and repulsion. In The Plumed Serpent he spoke of the "fascination . . . fear and repellence" of the "hard, four-square, sharpedged, cutting, zigzagging [carved mosaic facades of] Mitla, like continual blows of a stone ax. Without gentleness or grace or charm." In the same place, he described the stone serpents in the National Museum as "snakes coiled like excrement, snakes fanged and feathered beyond all dreams of dread," and those on the temple of Quetzalcoatl at Teotihuacan as "all-enwreathing dragon[s] of the horror of Mexico." The Aztec rattlesnake was for Lawrence a fitting emblem of the Mexican nation: "It's got a rattlesnake coiled in its heart, has this democracy of the New World. It's a dangerous animal, once it lifts its head again. Meanwhile, the dove still nests in the coils of the rattlesnake, the stone coiled rattlesnake of Aztec eternity."34 Compare this with Moore's notebook notation beside his drawing of an Aztec coiled serpent: "eternal grinding and interlacing of forms" (Wilkinson 1981: 266), and his references to menacing Aztec serpents. The point is that, although dissimilar in temperament, Moore and Lawrence shared many things, including outsider origins and modernist rebellion against established norms, together with their keen interest in Mexican forms. Lawrence was adventurous, restless, peripatetic, also violent, intractable, and antiformal ist; Moore, accommodating, gentle, insular, and focused on artistic form (Hall 1965: 102). Yet they gravitated to Mexican things at the same 34.

Moore, Reclining Woman, 1927 [LH 43]. they live in symbolic worlds of their own creation" (Carpenter 1978: intro.).35 Moore himself renounced "truth to materials" in the thirties, as his working methods plainly began to diverge from its imperatives: he penetrated the stone mass with deep holes and spaces; turned to bronze casting of plaster models; allowed his sculptures to be copied by others, and finally to be executed entirely from maquettes by assistants. "Nowadays I feel it is the artist's vision that matters more than the material used," he explained, adding, ". . . if the idea is good, it can actually be reproduced in many materials" (Moore 1981: 66). But as we have seen, even when he upheld those earlier notions, they never completely shaped his sculptural practice. Far from being an unmediated expression of his response to a particular material, his carving was from the beginning a highly calculated process, self consciously contrived through elaborate preparatory drawings and an eclectic assortment of pre-Columbian and primitive models. Whereas Lawrence knew Italy before seeking the primordial in Mexico, Moore came to Mexico and the primitive without direct experience of the classical tradition. Indeed, when the opportunity arose for him to travel to the heartland of this tradition, he resisted it? accepting a traveling fellowship to Italy only after time, finding in them rawness, ferocity, brutality, but also some sort of constructive virility, jagged energy, and concise clarity. Seen in this light, Moore's pronouncements about the stoniness, fertility of invention, plastic force, and cruel hardness of Mexican art take on new meaning, while his reference to its "power without loss of sensitiveness" seems to echo Lawrentian as well as late nineteenth-century characterizations of Aztec art as both savage and elegant. They suggest that, like Lawrence, he conceived of Mexico in a static state? originary, simple, timeless?locus of a barbarism still unpolluted by civilization, notwithstanding the enormous changes evidently taking place there. Also like Lawrence, Moore apparently believed that the inherent primordial vitality of Mexico's archaic forms could miraculously infuse new life into a cult of modern art. The ideology of "truth to materials" and "direct carving" has been thoroughly discredited. It is now clear that material properties influence an image's final form in only minor ways; that style is governed mainly by the attitude that the sculptor brings to the material, and that this in turn is conditioned by its economic, social, and political context. It is also recognized that, as Edmund Carpenter has noted, no matter how poor and naked a people's life is, "no one lives an 'elemental', 'simple', 'direct', 'immediate', life. People everywhere are pattern-makers and pattern perceivers; 35. In addition, the contradiction between the search for the primordial and its subsequent plugging into existing structures has been revealed as a new kind of eclecticism.</page><page sequence="21">178 RES 1 7/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 unsuccessfully trying to change the venue to Paris.36 In Italy in the spring of 1925 (visiting Paris and the Mus?es Guimet and Trocadero on both legs of his journey), he experienced a painful conflict between his convictions about primitive art and his new awareness of great proto-Renaissance masters, especially Giotto, Masaccio, and Giovanni Pisano. "It's dangerous for young people to stop doing their own work and concentrate for a long period on other people's. In Italy there was just too much richness, too much to sort out all at once. I knew even then that it had to be done. . . . But at that time ... it was an ordeal," he recalled in the late 1960s (Russell 1973: 40-41). For a time after his trip Moore was paralyzed by this crisis. Unable to reconcile the rigid dichotomy he had set up between the classical tradition and modeling, on one hand, and the primitive and direct carving, on the other hand, he pursued both tracks separately. In 1926-1927, Moore did a series of standing and reclining females in a traditional format that was then modish. An outstanding example is the naturalistic 1927 Reclining Woman (fig. 26) in cast concrete, a voluptuous and tranquil female. Around 1920, as part of a pervasive post-war retrospective tendency in painting and sculpture, Picasso initiated a vogue for neoclassical female nudes of Michelangelesque stature. They are characterized by huge thighs, thick torsos, round breasts, stocky necks, clumsy fingers, oval faces, and hair in a bun, and are usually reclining, propped on an elbow, or seated (Shone 1981: 83-84).37 Parisian sculptors who participated in this trend included Gaston Lachaise and Henri Laurens; while outside France, Aristide Maillol, the premier pre-war sculptural exponent of "ordered classicism" in female guise, was coming into his own ? in the estimation of both Clive Bell and Thomas Craven he was the greatest living sculptor. Perhaps not coincidentally, this fashion reasserting male patriarchy took shape at precisely the time when, as a result of their greater freedom of action during the war, middle-class women were challenging their traditional roles in favor of greater self-sufficiency ?the right to education, entry into the professions, and financial independence. The flapper image flaunting female rebellion was in full gear by 1922. In England, Bloomsbury circle painters Duncan Grant, Matthew Smith, Dod Proctor, and Vanessa Bell, rather than sculptors, expressed the neoclassical nude female theme first, inspired equally by the late Renoir and Picasso. Sculptors such as Dobson and Moore followed suit. It is likely, for example, that Moore saw Grant's 1919 painting Venus and Adonis, which was owned by Michael Sadler. Reflecting both neoclassical style and classic myth, it may well have set a precedent for his slightly later reclining women (ibid.: 85).38 Other English artists producing similar work at this juncture included Mark Gertler, J. D. Fergusson, Leon Underwood, Bernard Meninsky, and, a bit later, Stephen Tomlin. At the same time as he was carving neoclassical style reclining females, Moore resumed his primitivizing style, reaffirming the value of his pre-Columbian models, as his Olmec-, Teotihuacan-, Mezcala-, and Aztec-inspired Baby's Head (1926) (LH 35), animals (Duck and Serpent Head) (LH 44, 45), and masks (LH 41, 46) of 1926-1927 attest. In a similar vein are his 1928 Mask (LH 52), which recalls classic period Veracruz flat stone heads (hachas) associated with the pre-Columbian ball game, and Skull (fig. 24), which echoes Aztec stone and rock crystal death's heads. Both types of images were visible in books he owned and museums he frequented. The year 1928 marks a major turning point in Moore's work, bringing about a synthesis of these discrepant currents. While executing a commission for a relief figure of the West Wind (fig. 27) atop London's new Underground Headquarters office building, he developed his breakthrough Reclining Figure (1929), now in Leeds (fig. 28). As his first effort to make public art?to conceive a gigantic symbolic image in a prominent open air context?this commission spurred him to rethink the idea of a reclining nude in monumental terms, where previously his work was intimate and modest in size (even when taking his cue from pre-Columbian monoliths). The Underground building was intended to be a symbol of energetic optimism befitting a machine-age transport system, although its design mixes traditional 36. Expressly designed for the study of Italian old masters, the Royal College of Art scholarship required the recipient to return with copies of Italian art in hand. 37. Other popular themes of this ilk included Italian landscapes, mythological scenes, f?tes galantes, and commedia del arte figures. But the true distillation of these was the massive female inspired by Renoir's sensuous late Grandes Baigneuses, Picasso's meditations on motherhood, and Maillol's L'Action Encha?n?e. Shone, op. cit., suggests that they represented a wish to return to certitude, order, and spirituality after the war's convulsions. 38. According to Shone, p. 85, there are striking similarities in pose and style between some of Grant's drawings of sumptuous nudes, which appear more like sculptures than life drawings, and those of both Moore and Barbara Hepworth of this period.</page><page sequence="22">Braun: Henry Moore and pre-Columbian art 179 Figure 27.

The eight-foot-long figures are situated on the seventh story, eighty feet from the pavement, on a band of stone that girds the building to mark the setback of its wings; they are not very visible from below. Architect Charles Holden commissioned seven sculptors to carve decorations for this project. Eric Gill, the best known?except for Epstein, who did other sculpture for the building?was put in charge and given three figures to do, while the five others, including Moore, were each given one, so that each "wind" was represented twice.39 Moore set about his task by making hundreds of preparatory sketches, filling an entire "Underground Relief Sketchbook" in 1928. Drawings in the first pages 39. When Holden asked Moore to participate, at Epstein's urging, the thirty-year-old sculptor was initially reluctant. He was torn between satisfaction at receiving a substantial public commission and misgivings about "the humiliating subservience of the sculptor to the architect" (James 1966, p. 97). Moore had learned very well the modernist lesson of the artwork's autonomy, but he needed the work since it would provide considerable exposure and revenue. His chief</page><page sequence="23">180 RES 17/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 Figure 28. Moore, Reclining Figure, 1929, Leeds City Art Galleries. of the sketchbook show that his starting point for the project was the static pose and naturalistic demeanor of the previous year's Reclining Figure in concrete. But these soon gave way in his efforts to represent flying motion, flatten and monumentalize the figure, and relate it to its architectural setting (Wilkinson 1979: 76-77; Cork 1981: 97). It is not surprising, given Moore's orientation, that at a certain point in the figure's conception he turned to pre-Columbian sculpture for inspiration, focusing on the tenth-century Toltec-Maya chacmool from Chichen Itza (fig. 29)?a colossal recumbent figure associated with temple doorways and seats of authority, which was designed to be seen from a distance. This chacmool was once a conspicuous architectural ornamentation, found on a broad terrace at the top of the Temple of the Tables (now called Temple of the Warriors). For the first time, the function of a Moore figure and that of its ancient source were congruent: both were monumental reclining spirit personifications associated with the apex of imposing structures, and both in different ways proclaim the individual's prostration before authority. The Moore literature is unclear as to exactly how and when the artist first encountered the chacmool.40 The date must be at least as early as 1922, since there are two thumbnail sketches of what is undoubtedly the chacmool?a figure reclining on its back, head at right angle to body, legs drawn up, rectangular base?at the bottom of page 93 in notebook no. 2, dated 1921 ? 1922 (see Wilkinson 1981 : fig. 94) (on the same page as a drawing of what is surely another pre-Columbian object, resembling a classic Veracruz hacha carved in relief with a lizard, or perhaps an alabaster vessel with source of regular income was a teaching position, supplemented by the sale of his drawings, which until World War II outnumbered sculptures 20-1 (Wilkinson 1977, p. 17). As a sculptor he also faced economic constraints peculiar to his trade?the high cost of marble, stone, and seasoned wood (not to speak, for the moment, of bronze casting), as well as of handling, storing, and transporting bulky, heavy objects. (In 1925 Moore had joined the London Arts Association, which was founded as a self-help group to grapple with the financial, exhibition, and patronage problems confronting artists.) He seems, in fact, to have been entertaining the notion of architectural sculpture commissions since at least 1926, when he began to use reinforced concrete for sculptures. Once Moore was established as a bonafide art star in the 1940s, large-scale public commissions keyed to architecture increasingly became his mainstays (although mainly in the round with strong separate identities, rather than reliefs). 40. Moore's own accounts have varied. In 1946 (James op. cit., pp. 40, 42), he said it occurred in 1925, after his trip to Italy, as he was working his way out of the violent internal conflict Italy had engendered by returning to his earlier interests: "I came back to ancient Mexican art in the British Museum. I came across an illustration of the chacmool discovered in Chichen Itza in a German publication?and its curious reclining posture attracted me?not lying on its side, but on its back with its head twisted around. Herbert Read 1965, p. 72, corroborates the 1925 date, but makes the Trocadero cast the connecting link. But in a 1950 letter to Professor Michael Coe, he says he saw the chacmool figure "in a photo first in 1923." On another occasion he told David Sylvester that he saw an illustration of it in Lehmann's Altmexikanische Kunstgeschichte in 1927, and looked at the plaster cast at the Trocadero only after completing the Leeds figure in 1929. See Wilkinson 1979, pp. 39-40.</page><page sequence="24">Braun: Henry Moore and pre-Columbian art 181 a superimposed lizard).41 The most likely vehicle of transmission was a plaster cast in the Trocadero of the chacmool from Chichen Itza (original in Mexico), since from 1922 on Moore traveled regularly to Paris; a likely source for this first drawing of it was a plate in Lehmann's Altmexikanische Kunstgeschichte, which we know was in Moore's possession in 1922. Moore was also no doubt aware of the less prepossessing Aztec chacmool in the British Museum ethnographic collection (Moore 1981: pi., pp. 66-67). Nor was the chacmool an obscure object at the time. The French adventurer Augustus Le Plongeon originally brought it to light in 1884, giving it a Yucatec Maya name meaning "red or great jaguar paw," and weaving fantastical tales around it in his Sacred Mysteries Among the Mayas and Quiches (1886), Queen Moo and the Egyptian Sphinx (1896), and Queen Moo II (1900). The cast in the Trocadero was taken from the limestone sculpture he uncovered (fig. 29). Now located in the National Anthropology Museum in Mexico, this chacmool is mentioned and illustrated in nearly every early twentieth-century account of Mesoamerican art and archaeology. Journalistic coverage in the 1920s included features in the London Magazine (vol. 24, no. 140, pp. 123-132) and the London Illustrated News (November 1 and 29, 1924), which devoted two articles to Thomas Gann's discovery of a Yucate?an site, which he named Chacmool after he found a version of the Chichen figure there.42 Evidence of Moore's continuing interest in the chacmool after the initial sketches includes three studies of reclining figures on page 39 in notebook no. 3 (1922-1924).43 One wonders as well whether the unique Recumbent Male Figure that Moore carved out of mansfield stone in 1924 (LH 24)?since destroyed ? may have been based on the Mexican prototype. However, the artist's renewed interest in the chacmool at the time of his West Wind commission in 1928 may have been stimulated by the activity of his mentor, Figure 29. Chacmool, Toltec-Maya, Chichen Itza, ca. 900 1200, Museo Nacional de Antropolog?a, Mexico City. Leon Underwood, who had traveled extensively in Mexico during the previous year and also executed a painting called Chacmool's Destiny (Neve 1974: 107 108, pi. 63). The chacmool's distinctive horizontal posture is its salient characteristic. It is a male figure reclining flat on his back, body raised at either end by bent knees and elbows that support a slightly lifted torso?as in a classical yoga position of equilibrium. The symmetrical body has a single axis from neck to toes, the hands meet on the thorax and support a vessel resting on the stomach. The primary view is a relieflike profile, with the head rotated ninety degrees from the body axis to present a frontal face. The figure's proportions?an overly large head in relation to a short torso and elongated limbs?are markedly unnaturalistic. Its costume often includes a pillbox-style headdress with jutting square ear ornaments, an elaborate breast ornament or collar, a breechcloth, bracelets, armlets, sandals, and leg ornaments?but these elements are subsumed within a clearcut angular silhouette. Like most pre-Columbian highland art it is ponderous and austere, its expression solemn ? lacking lightness or humor. Yet its upraised head turned toward the viewer conveys an alert watchfulness, a tension between its parts. The point of the chacmool's interjection into the conceptual process occurs after many pages of preparatory sketches for West Wind, as the figure progressively stiffens, assuming a blocky, angular form, and is surrounded by stylized geometric notations of its 41. As pictured in Lehmann, 1922, pi. 19. 42. Since Le Plongeon's discovery, fourteen chacmools have been located at Chichen Itza, and twelve at Tula, a related, probably contemporaneous, Toltec center in northern Mexico. There have also been isolated, dispersed finds at Quirigua (by Maudslay), and other Maya area sites (in El Salvador, by Lehmann), even as far south as Costa Rica, as well as at later, Aztec-period sites, including Tenochtitlan, Tlaxcala, Michoacan, and Cempoala. 43. See Wilkinson 1979, p. 40. He also suggests that a naturalistic reclining nude on page 21 of notebook no. 5 (ca. 1925-1926), which foreshadows the Leeds Reclining Nude, may be derived in part from the chacmool.</page><page sequence="25">182 RES 17/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 Figure 30. Moore, Ideas for West Wind Relief, 1928, Art Gallery of Ontario, Canada. architectural context.44 At the bottom of this sheet (fig. 30), the chacmool's rectangular bent elbow and masklike face emerge. Moore's deep involvement with the project is clear from the pains he took to perfect both the conception and the execution of the image. For its complicated execution he was required to rough out the enormous three-piece portland stone figure in his Royal College of Art studio and finish it in situ on the building. The general stability and severity of West Wind's final form owes much to the chacmool: the figure's simultaneously volumetric and flattened character, blocky shape (sans wrists and ankles), bold formal simplification (the outline subsumes incised details), and rhythmic equilibrium of parts are particularly indebted to the ancient prototype, as is its twisted head. But its caplike hair, deeply shadowed eyes, and air of brooding seriousness reflect the typical traits and feature distortions of the Aztec-style masks Moore had studied previously. Its face, in fact, corresponds closely with his asymmetrical 1927 Mask (fig. 22), which is based on an Aztec obsidian head (as noted above). Toward the end of the "Underground Relief Sketchbook" there is a study for a reclining figure on the back of a garden bench relief which is the genesis of the Leeds piece. The figure reclines sideways, like West Wind, but the right angles formed at the elbow and raised knee link it even more closely to the chacmool. And in the definitive study for the Leeds carving?an enlarged version of a bench relief study? Moore has added three blocky protruberances beside the head that echo the rectangular ear ornaments of the Chichen chacmool (fig. 31) (Wilkinson 1979: 49-51). The raised legs of the chacmool, "coming down like columns," together with the "stillness and alertness, a sense of readiness, and the whole presence of it" are, Moore said, the features he most admired in the chacmool (ibid.: 52). The upright, vigilant head?with staring, widely separated eyes?juxtaposed with the reclining form at rest, the enclosing crooked elbow and raised knees, and the ear ornaments transformed into a cubic bun are features of the Leeds figure and hundreds of its successors. Another constant is the Mexican figure's massive, inert, blocklike character?underlined by an attached base whose coarse surface refers to the shape and texture of the stone from which it was carved ? and unnaturalistic figurai proportions. Besides the obvious sex change, however, the Leeds figure differs from the chacmool in important ways. By tilting the body on its side?shifting the weight, contrappostolike, from both hips to one45 (while maintaining a low center of gravity)? stacking and opening up an irregular space between the legs, and lifting and releasing the left arm from the block? 44. Cork 1985, pp. 169-174, and Wilkinson 1979, pp. 49-51, have traced the gradual evolution of the West Wind figure in Moore's series of preparatory sketches. 45. Sylvester, 1968, p. 6, suggests that Moore's figure resembles Michelangelo's Medici Chapel Dawn and that he may have unconsciously derived this contrapposto effect from it. Curiously, an anomalous chacmool from Chichen Itza, called the Swimmer chacmool, has legs that assume the same sideways position as that of the Leeds Reclining Figure.

Standard Bearer, Toltec-Maya, Chichen Itza, ca. 900-1200, Museo Nacional de Antropolog?a, Mexico City. Moore has made his figure more supple, asserting an asymmetry and contrast between the masses. The Ottawa Reclining Figure (fig. 32) of the following year is closer in pose to the chacmool, weight resting firmly on the buttocks, both bent knees upright, feet parallel, and both arms lowered. But its (less masklike) head, torso, and limbs are subtly twisted out of direct alignment with one another, each one operating independently and bringing about a looser and more complex interp?n?tration of volumes. By overriding the symmetricality of the chacmool, Moore achieved for the first time forms that "really existed and worked against each other and with each other rather than [being] one solid mass that was all crushed and stuck together," as he later noted (Janiou 1968: 28-29). As in his previous Mexican-inspired sculptures, Moore emphasized these figures' faces and hands, which he based on separate pre-Columbian prototypes. The face of the Leeds figure is primarily based on the round face, open mouth, and blank stare of a mask of Figure 34. Moore, Seated Figure, 1930, Art Gallery of Ontario, Canada. Xipe Totee (fig. 25a) that inspired one of a series of masks he produced in 1928-1929 (fig. 25b). Its cubistic flattened nose and broken plane from nose to chin may also contain a reference to Olmec or Veracruz dualistic heads.46 The clenched fist of the Ottawa figure echoes those of many Toltec and Aztec standard bearer and guardian figures (fig. 33)?once displayed on pyramid terraces ?which were intended for the insertion of banners. Moore used similar hands on a series of semiabstract 1928-1931 Seated Females with clasped hands (fig. 34) (others include LH 65 and 67), which in fact resemble these ancient standard bearers while also sharing the twisted head, contrapposto torso, and cubic bun of his contemporaneous reclining figures. The formal strategies evidenced in Moore's reclining figures and their relation to the chacmool and other 46.

IV.</page><page sequence="28">Braun: Henry Moore and pre-Columbian art 185 ancient prototypes are by now clear. But how has Moore responded to and transformed the chacmool's content? The cultural identification and significance of the chacmool in ancient America is clouded?although not for want of trying. It is generally regarded as Toltec in origin and as evidence of that culture's tenth-century penetration of the Maya area?although some experts argue the reverse. Its iconographie interpretation is still more problematic. Its common placement in or near temple entrances and its watchful, outwardly turned head suggest a guardian function, if not an identity. Aztec period examples are associated with the rain god ?they wear Tlaloc masks?and sacrifice: the vessel they hold is a container (cuauxicalli) for the hearts of sacrificial victims. However, the Toltec-Maya version, five centuries earlier, lacks the clear deity insignia of the Aztec. It is generally thought to be a fertility deity associated with the harvest and drunkenness-^its vessel accommodating an intoxicating drink?although Mary Miller has recently argued for its linkage with the Maya rain god (Chac), war, sacrifice, and captive imagery commemorating a defeated enemy.47 Moore was apparently unconcerned with the ancient meaning?the historical, cultural, and mythological underpinnings?of the icon. He converted the chacmool's gender from male to female, substituting, for a masculine guardian figure probably associated with warfare and conquest, a nude woman. In this sense, his reclining figure curiously echoes that of the first image of the "Indian savage" to enter the corpus of European art?the recumbent female personification of America adorning sixteenth-century maps as an allegory of one of the four continents. America is invariably a naked female, but her feathered headdress and bow and arrow are attributes of male warriors. Her other accoutrements are a severed head (a reference to cannibalism) or an alligator (denizen of a watery continent). And for the next two centuries she is frequently represented as such in European painting, sculpture, murals, and decorative arts (fig. 35) (Honour 1975: 84-117). From a feminist perspective, both the early allegorical and the Moore representations translate one "other" into another "other," constructing a telling equation between lesser race and lesser gender?and Figure 35. European painting of America, seventeenth century (Honour 1975). asserting that both are on a lower evolutionary rung than the colonizing white male. There existed no monumental tradition of a supine nude female in ancient America,48 but there was, as we have seen, a strong neoclassical one in Europe that had recently been revived. It is the old idealization of the female as a passive, available object of desire?fetishistic object of the determining male gaze (deployed as symbolic release for male desire, anxiety, and terror). This ?mage was probably reconstituted as a reassertion of female subjugation at a time when large numbers of middle class women were actively resisting their traditional role. More broadly, it may also have functioned as "cultural legitimation of social repression," as Benjamin Buchloh has suggested (1984: 121). Moore's reclining females appear to fit into this category, as noted, and the occasional eruptions of overt aggressivity toward the 47. See Joyce 1914, pp. 42, 138; Lehmann, The History of Ancient Mexican Art (New York, 1922), p. 27; Alfredo Cuellar, Tezcatzoncatl escult?rico: el Chac-Mool dios mesoamericana del vino (Mexico City, 1981); and Miller 1985, pp. 7-17. 48. There are a small number of representations of reclining females known from northern South America, particularly the Mochica culture in formative period Peru, but they are exceptional and confined to the ceramic medium. The Mochica version is a bowl at the bottom of which lies a supine female with a gaping vulva. Any fluid poured into the bowl runs down through the vulva and into a reservoir beneath it, so that when fluid is poured out the vulva serves as spout. These vessels are thought to have a possibly humorous connotation, but are devoid of any notions of availability, vulnerability, tranquility, inherent in reclining female nudes in the West. See Paul H. Gebhard, "Sexual Motifs in Prehistoric Peruvian Ceramics," in Theodore Bowie, et al., Studies in Erotic Art (New York, London, 1970), pp. 109-169 and fig. 54.</page><page sequence="29">186 RES 1 7/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 female in his work (see below) would seem to confirm this analysis. Moore further exalted women's biological role by encouraging a metaphorical reading of his recumbent females in geological terms, thus equating them with earth mother figures. At the artist's suggestion, the Ottawa figure was given the title Mountains, when it was published in R. H. Wilenski's Meaning of Modern Sculpture in 1932 (Wilkinson 1979: 55, n. 35). This accorded with a then fashionable surrealist penchant for animistic representations of the female as landscape, her rising and falling contours suggesting hills and valleys?as, for example, in the paintings of British surrealist Paul Nash. What distinguishes Moore's figures from similar conceptions by Nash, Dobson, and other contemporaries is their alert vigilance, epitomized by the upright twisted head, one of the chacmool's essential features, that nearly every one of his recurrent reclining figures shares. By comparison, Dobson's nudes in a similar pose are flaccid, evoking tranquility and repose; one reason is surely the absence of this jarring feature. In Moore, what remains of the ancient source is precisely an impression of the aggressive vitality that the artist saw in it. Quite literally, he has used the intrusive watchful head?together with the hard, rectangular propped elbow and overall blocky form ? as a means of infusing a primitive energy, breathing life into a Western art tradition gone soft. Where D. H. Lawrence wanted to primitivize Western culture, it could be said that Moore's instinct was to domesticate the primitive to Western culture by fusing its raw vitality, gravity, and mystery with familiar, acceptable content?such as the female figure?and conventional (sexist) attitudes toward it. In this sense, he appropriated what he deemed savage masculine power to construct a reassertion of male supremacy over claims to power from threatening new quarters, while denying the native culture its own meaning. In explicit terms, however, the conversion of the chacmool's gender was primarily a formal decision ? the female simply offered the best example of a well built form with which he could seek different plastic effects. He said the reclining female was important because it allowed him "to try out all kinds of formal ideas. . . . The subject matter is given. It's settled for you, and you know it and like it, so that within it, within the subject you've done a dozen times before, you are free to invent a completely new form-idea" (Russell 1973: 48). If pressed about meaning, he spoke vaguely about the female body as an expression of nature elevated to a symbol of universal order. By adapting the Mexican formula to a European format, Moore could skirt conventional realism, while still referring to the familiar, and at the same time call attention to the artist's formal gestures with his material. This idealization was based on a tension between the objective female form and primitivist-derived stylistic perceptions. In this way the chacmool became, in Moore's words, "undoubtedly the one sculpture which most influenced my early work" (Wilkinson 1979: 33). The creation of these first fully realized, large-scale, independent sculptures signaled an end to Moore's apprenticeship and the beginning of his self-sufficiency as an artist. Although still deeply dependent on ancient and modern models, his work now seemed formed of an independent consciousness, and he began to exert an influence on others. The Leeds figure had an immediate impact on Barbara Hepworth and other artists in his Hampstead circle, and there was even a curious correspondence between Epstein's and Moore's work?the older artist now turned to pre-Columbian models?suggesting a possible reversal in the direction of influence.49 Moore even began, like Epstein, to collect primitive art, including African and Mexican pieces (Hall 1965: 128). In the catalog of his highly successful, second individual show at Leicester Galleries in April 1931, Epstein hailed him as the future of English sculpture. New critics associated with abstraction and surrealism also took up his cause, including R. H. Wilenski and Herbert Read. From this point on, he was regarded as the central figure in the development of modern art in England. Since the late 1920s Moore had a continuing preoccupation with the theme of the reclining figure, which eventually encompassed two-thirds of his entire oeuvre. The prototype for every image is the chacmool derived conception of a stereometric horizontal volume with a low center of gravity enclosing a cavity at its center. He elaborated and refined this formula over the next fifty years ? variously, balancing masses and voids, stressing negative or positive spaces, and breaking, piercing, and eroding the solitary form into two, three, and four parts, when he became more involved with abstraction ? but nearly always retained some reference to the blocky enveloping form of a reclining human figure and an upright head that had originally been inspired by the chacmool. 49. See, for example, Epstein's Elemental, Woman Possessed, Chimera, Adam, and fcce Homo.</page><page sequence="30">Braun: Henry Moore and pre-Columbian art 187 Nothing in the way of pre-Columbian influences on Moore's work compares in importance to the chacmool. Nevertheless, noteworthy appropriations of prehispanic forms continue in his work of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s?although most critics contend that his more radical 1930s sculptures mark a break with Mexican models. Until 1932 he produced clearly recognizable figures in the semiabstract modernist style of the Leeds and Ottawa figures. But beginning with his Composition (1931) (LH 102) and for the next four years, he experimented with a more aggressively abstract modernist style, which was keyed to surrealist emphasis on the unconscious, and modeled on the expressive distortions of Picasso's bathers, Arp's biomorphic forms, and Giacometti's metaphorical "game board" pieces of the late 1920s and early 1930s. The most abstract works of this phase?representing a profound departure from prior efforts, which Moore would not pursue again for another twenty-five years? are an evocative, disquieting series of mothers and children and reclining females (1934-1935). Their dislocated or dismembered parts are linked together by a common rectangular base bridging the spaces between them. Outstanding examples include Head and Ball (LH 151), Composition, Reclining Figure in corsehill stone, and Four Piece Composition: Reclining Figure (fig. 36a,b,c). The grooved, hollowed out, and incised fragments provide clues to their anatomical identity through organic reference, as for example in Four Piece Composition: Reclining Figure, where a small ball signifies a navel. But, at the same time, they correspond to other natural shapes?pebbles, bones, stones, shells. Moore's use of such metaphorical analogies and biomorphic distortions shows him sharing the surrealists' preoccupation with the antirational and animistic. They also indicate a corresponding surrealist interest in the fantastic shapes and disjunctions of Oceanic art?so different from his monolithic, Mexican-inspired mode (see Greutzner 1981: 121ff.; Wilkinson 1981; 1984). Yet a previously unacknowledged (although possibly indirect) pre Columbian influence is also at work here. There can be no doubt that these abstract metaphorical pieces owe a special debt to Giacometti's innovative works of 1930-1933,50 such as Woman with her Throat Cut, Project for a Square, Head/Landscape, Circuit, and No More Play, which involve similar Figure 36.

(although more complex) formal and analogical strategies.51 As early as 1930 Giacometti was associated with a dissident surrealist group led by Georges Bataille. Its major vehicle was the journal Documents, which was committed to primitive and pre-Columbian 50. According to Mitchinson 1982, p. 36, Moore had met Giacometti by 1933. 51. Rosalind Krauss 1984, pp. 521-523, and pi. on pp. 513, 519, 529, suggests that the so-called gameboard pieces are especially radical because they decenter representation by conceiving of the work itself as a base that begins to fuse with its surroundings. The metaphoric nature of the forms also expands the work's spatial as well as temporal dimensions. She also sees the gameboard pieces as inextricably linked with Giacometti's primitivism.</page><page sequence="31">188 RES 17/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 Figure 37.

At the heart of Bataille's theory lay his appreciation of pre Columbian art, expressed in an essay called "L'Am?rique disparue" (1928), in which he wrote sympathetically of Maya self-mutilation, Aztec cannibalism and blood lust, and the sacrificial rites of the pre-Columbian ball game.52 According to Rosalind Krauss (op. cit., 1984: 512), the form and content of a number of Giacometti's pieces of the early 1930s parallel Bataille's notions.53 Even if Moore was aware through his association with Giacometti of Bataille's determinedly perverse celebration of Aztec sadism and ball game-related Figure 38. Moore, Mask, 1929 [LH 72]. sacrifice, it is unlikely, in view of the primacy of his formalist concerns and his commonsensical outlook, that he would have fully embraced this demonic interpretation of pre-Columbian culture. On the other hand, the uncharacteristically erotic, antirational, and abstract nature of his 1934-1935 production and its obvious dependence on Giacometti's works of the preceding years suggest that he may at this moment have been receptive to these extreme views. Be that as it may, there can be no doubt that Moore was aware of the pre-Columbian ball game and interested in its associated paraphernalia. Quite possibly he was acquainted with the surrealists' major source of information about it, Frans Blom's The Maya 52. It appeared in the catalog of the first major pre-Columbian art exhibition in Paris: Exposition de l'art de l'Am?rique; cat: Jean Babelon, L'Art pr?columbien (Paris, 1930). Krauss 1984, pp. 510 512. 53. Krauss maintains that the explicitly erotic and sadistic Suspended Ball?suggesting both cutting and caressing?has a wedge-shaped component recalling implements called palmas that are thought to have been worn by the players as protective devices. And the subsequent Point to the Eye, Circuit, and No More Play investigate sculpture itself as a ball court, or playing field or gameboard. She identifies Frans Blom's The Maya Ball Game Pok-Ta Pok, Middle American Papers (Tulane University, 1932) as a major source about the game at the time, noting that Blom gives dictionary definitions of the game that relate the game with death and emphasize the instrumentality of the players' naked buttocks in the game (the ball was kept aloft with their knees and buttocks) ? Nahuat ollama: to play ball with buttocks.</page><page sequence="32">Braun: Henry Moore and pre-Columbian art 189 Ball Game; Pok ta-pok. As early as 1928, and again in 1930, he used as models for his heads (LH 52, 72) the axe-shaped hachas (figs. 37, 38) associated with the players. One even seems equipped, like so many ball game associated heads, with a rear tenon. His use of the title Head and Ball (1934) for one of his works of this period may also allude to the ball game. Hachas' surfaces are activated through step forms, openwork breaks, and small holes. In the Guatemalan variant (fig. 39) a calculated use of perforations as both positive and negative space suggests a metamorphic shifting between human and animal image within the same form (see Braun 1977: 426-427). Moore might have found the examples of Guatemalan hachas in the British Museum collection particularly attractive when he was exploring notions of metamorphic expansion in a series of "transformation drawings" during the first half of the 1930s. In them he transformed found objects ? lobster claws, pieces of bone, pebbles?into drawings for sculptures of reclining figures and mothers and children for his Compositions and Square Forms. Moore himself once attributed the piercing of his sculptures of late 1930s to the Mexican stimulus, citing as inspiration a giant perforated parrot head, a ball court marker from Xochicalco, in which positive and negative spaces have equal value. Perforated and notched hachas clearly played a determining role in Figure 39. Hacha, Guatemala, ca. 300-900, The Philadelphia Museum of Art. Figure 40. Moore, Head with notch, 1937-1938, The Henry Moore Foundation. shaping images of flat, sharp-edged profile heads such as Square Form (1936), Head (1937) (fig. 40), and Head (1937-1938), which also mark a return to his blocky format. Through his involvement with surrealist notions of the transgressive nature of the unconscious, Moore pushed his previous assimilation of pre-Columbian models to another level ? involving analogical and abstract forms and also possibly an interest in specific pre-Columbian content relating to the ball game. His first drawings of figures in a landscape setting?during the second half of the 1930s?also seem to be an outgrowth of surrealist conceptions of ambient space. Their aura of eroded natural boulders or archaic monuments situated in remote, mysterious archaeological contexts (Sylvester 1957: pi. on p. 198) was probably also inspired by the surrealists' keen interest in archaeology, as for example in Max Ernst's 1934 painting Garden Airplane Trap, which is based on photos of Machu Picchu.54 They may also reflect 54. Moore exhibited with the surrealists during this period, participating in the International Surrealist Exhibition in London in</page><page sequence="33">190 RES 17/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 Figure 41. Moore, Family Group, 1947, terracotta maquette, Art Gallery of Ontario. Moore's awareness through photographs of pre Columbian monuments in situ. This placement of figures in a specific environment reaches maximum force in his 1940-1941 drawings of the London underground during the blitz, in which shrouded reclining figures are confined in cavernous dark spaces. Executed in his capacity as official war artist, they are among Moore's finest achievements. In them pre-Columbian, Renaissance, and modern models cohere with his experience of dramatic contemporary events into a deeply moving vision of human dignity in the face of fear and suffering. After the shelter drawings were exhibited in the National Gallery in the early 1940s, Moore achieved widescale public acceptance, and was the recipient of numerous official honors and commissions. Besides the famous Northampton Madonna, commissioned by the Reverend Walter Hussey for the Church of St. Matthew (1943-1944), there were further commissions from Figure 42. Moore, Family Group, 1947, Barclay School, Stevenage, Herts., England. institutions for which he turned out sculptures ratifying established values. These included a series of Family Groups?a theme Moore began to explore around the time of the birth of his daughter Mary. They consist of two adult figures holding one or, sometimes, two children, and suggest that he was turning both to Renaissance images of the Holy Family and to pre Columbian art for solutions to this new formal problem. In particular, the numerous small terracotta maquettes for these mother-father-child groups in the mid-1940s (fig. 41) point to ancient West Mexican (Nayarit, Jalisco, and Colima) ceramic representations as models. These Mexican terracottas were widely admired at this time, and many artists took their cue from Diego Rivera, who had amassed a huge collection of them, which he published in 1941.55 A comparison between, say, Family Group (1947) (fig. 42) and a Jalisco couple 1936, the year he met Ernst. For an illustration of Ernst's paintings, see John Russell, Max Ernst (New York, 1960), pi. 20. 55. See Gilbert Medioni, Art in Ancient Mexico (New York, 1941). The first major exhibition exclusively devoted to West Mexican art, based on Rivera's collection, was held in Mexico City in 1946.</page><page sequence="34">Braun: Henry Moore and pre-Columbian art 191 (fig. 43)?one of many similar ceramic sculptures in contemporary public and private European collections ? bears out some striking similarities in figurai proportions and attitudes. The exaggerated gestures, anatomical distortions, and reticent male-female interaction ? including the broad, flat, concave upper torsos, long tubular curving arms, truncated hands and feet, and blurred features?are especially revealing of this connection. The rhythmic alternation of masses and spaces, the smooth, highly burnished surfaces, and even specific details of Moore's figures, such as protruding vertebrae and slouching posture, are directly traceable to West Mexican models. Compare, for example, the male in the family group at Barclay School, Stevenage (1948), and a seated man from Colima (figs. 44, 45). Increasingly in the 1950s, Moore was asked to provide state or corporate symbols. One such occasion was his commission to make a carved Screen for the balustrade of the terrace of the Time-Life Building (1952-1953) on Bond Street, along with a Draped Reclining Figure for the terrace itself. As in his previous architectural sculpture commission for West Wind (1928-1929), also poised above the street on a corporate building, he turned to blocky pre-Columbian forms for inspiration in creating monumental imagery, Figure 43. Couple, terracotta, Jalisco, Mexico, ca. 300 b.c a.d. 300, Proctor Stafford Collection, Los Angeles County Museum. Figure 44. Moore, Family Group, Barclay School, Stevenage, rear view. but he shifted his attention from ancient Mexico to Peru. This was precisely the time when Peruvian antiquities, whose aesthetic appreciation had lagged behind those of Mesoamerica, were coming into their own in museum collections.56 On this occasion, however, without benefit of a given symbolic motif, Moore resorted to semiabstract figurative monoliths quite devoid of thematic content. He collaborated with architect Michael Rosenauer in conceiving of a massive stone Screen that would be pierced and carved on both sides and divided into four open panels, each containing a slightly projecting anthropomorphic upright figure continuous with the geometrical facade of the building (fig. 46). (Originally, he thought of them as 56. See Alan R. Sawyer, Mastercraftsmen of Ancient Peru (The Solomon Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1968), p. 12. In 1952, Sawyer points out, the Art Institute of Chicago exhibited an important Peruvian collection, well known from German publications, which became the basis of its Department of Primitive Art; in 1954, the Museum of Modern Art presented a traveling show called Ancient Arts of the Andes; and in 1955 Peru sent an exhibition of ancient, colonial, and modern Peruvian art to Mexico City and Toronto, followed by a larger show of the same type in Paris in 1957.</page><page sequence="35">192 RES 17/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 y*1 - ? tM Figure 46.

Their rectangular forms hark back to those of his blocky semiabstract carvings of heads and square forms of 1936-1937, which appear to refer to Mexican hachas and perhaps also to ancient Peruvian monoliths.57 Once again, as in his Family Groups, Moore was generating in miniature plaster maquettes forms that would be realized in monumental stone or bronze, and incorporating elements of small-scale pre Columbian sculptures into his imagery. Wilkinson (1981: 294-295) has plausibly suggested that the heads of both outer figures may be based on three-inch-high gold jaguar masks from the Mochica or Chimu culture, which were illustrated in Heinrich Ubbelohde Doering's UArt du vieux Peru (1952) (fig. 47). Shaped from hammered sheet gold to form a hollow square feline head with holes for attachment to a base (probably a woven headband or shirt), they embody the sophisticated metallurgical tradition that developed as early as 500 b.c. on the north coast of Peru. The jaguar was a primary motif of ancient Peruvian art, serving from the early period onward as an emblem of power. The right-angled channels comprising the feline's eyes and cheeks and the groove forming its mouth, and their proportional relation to the whole, seem to be echoed in Moore's heads. Another example of Moore's appropriation of ancient Peruvian imagery at this time is his bronze Mother and Child (1953) (fig. 48)?for which he made a preparatory drawing in 1951 and a maquette in 1952. As Wilkinson (1981: 292) has shown, its source is a relief on a Chimu pot (ca. a.d. 1000-1470) (fig. 49) illustrated in a book Moore owned, Ernst Fuhrmann's Peru II (1922).58 Distinguished by their black or red color, polished sheen, and stirrup spouts (appliqued with small animal figures), these mass-produced, mold made vessels?which Gauguin had already admired ? are decorated with mythological scenes in pressed Figure 45. Seated figure, Colima, Mexico, rear view, ca. 300 b.c.-a.D. 300, Proctor Stafford Collection, Los Angeles County Museum. relief. This one depicts a struggle between two fantastic beings, the deity Ai-Aipec in the guise of an anthropomorphic bird versus a sea monster. Moore focused on the latter figure, who clutches and threatens to devour Ai-Aipec's serpent belt, transforming it into a rather sinister version of the mother and child theme. The serpent head metamorphoses into a child with a gaping mouth straining toward the upright breast of its mother, whose serrated head, breast, and outstretched arm derive from the toothy open maw and the arm of the monster. Moore evidently had a special interest in this motif, since it reappears in two small bronzes of 1952, Mother and Child: Corner Sculpture, nos. 1 and 2 (LH 307-08).59 Moore's strange, angular, expressionistic image of a rapacious child assaulting its mother's breast makes overt the hidden content of some of his earliest images 57. Mother and Child, 1936 (LH 171), for example, resembles in its figurai proportions?large head in relation to squat body?and fusion of all parts into a single block any number of pan-Andean columnar or shaft figures representing warriors with shields dating from ca. 500 b.c. to a.D. 500. See B. Braun, "Sources of the Cotzumalhuapa Style," Baessler archiv, new series, vol. xxvi (1978), pp. 191-195, figs. 38, 39. Moore might have seen such figures in books about ancient Peruvian art which were published in the 1930s. 58. Moore had referred to ancient Peruvian metalwork once before in a drawing of an Inca llama appearing on p. 30 of notebook no. 6, 1926. See Wilkinson 1977, p. 150 and fig. 136. 59. See Moore 1965, pi. 36, 37, for illustrations. Other works of the late 1950s suggest that Moore was looking in the direction of ancient Peru for inspiration, particularly his "wall backgrounds" for bronze sculptures, whose unusually textured surfaces recall those of Inca stone masonry.</page><page sequence="37">194 RES 17/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 of infants aggressively sucking an isolated breast (1927, 1930). It also reminds us that his 1920s infants were often based on Olmec were-jaguar babies whose essential feature is a snarling mouth. Erich Neumann has interpreted it as "a picture of the Terrible Mother, of the primal relationship fixed forever in its negative aspect," embodying the child's frustration by the denying, restraining mother (1959: 117). As a unique rendition of a favorite theme, it thus suggests, in Freudian terms, the "return of the repressed" ? revealing Moore's mother-hating side, and, finally, unmasking a possible psychological motive for his attraction to the aggressive aspects of pre-Columbian art. In all his years of referring to pre-Columbian forms, Moore never once traveled to their place of origin. Apparently, his experience of these forms out of context, in museums and reproductions, was sufficient for his purposes. Finally, however, on being awarded the sculpture prize at the second Sao Paulo Biennale? one of dozens of international prizes that followed on the heels of his triumph at the 1948 Venice Biennale? Moore traveled to Brazil and Mexico in 1953-1954, visiting several pre-Columbian sites in Central Mexico and Yucatan. "When I went there I was tremendously impressed by the people," he commented in 1982. "It seemed to me that Mexican people lived on the ground, and I mean I saw them sitting there quite naturally, comfortably, all on the ground," he continued, linking this to his favorite theme of the reclining figure based on the chacmool.60 But it was too late for this visit to have any meaningful impact on Moore's work, since his innovative work now lay behind him. Although he continued to be productive for another thirty years? until his death in 1986 at age eighty-eight?it was mainly in his institutionalized role of modernist old master, recapitulating, with much assistance, old formulae with new materials, techniques, and textural effects (in increasingly bloated size and skewed scale). Indeed, in his transformation from exceptional outsider to establishment celebrity, from Yorkshire rebel to national hero, Moore came to exemplify the bourgeois concept of individualism and free enterprise, of the self-creating artist making a world all by himself ?with perhaps a little help from the third world.61 The 60. Interview with Moore by Luis Roberto Vera, September 1982, in Peter Briggs, ed., Maya Image in the Western World (University of New Mexico Art Museum, 1987), p. 41. In conjunction with this trip, a mural based on a Moore "project" "was realized by Mexican painter Alfonso Soto Soria at the El Eco Experimental Museum in Mexico City." It represents on a blank background a series of evenly spaced, frontal, monumental skeletal figures?typical of pre-Columbian and modern Mexican folk art? linked together by intersecting lines.

In an ironic twist, Moore's appropriation and translation of pre-Columbian sculpture has now come full circle as the basis of a reconstituted Eskimo carving style with a not-so-hidden Western identity.62 Figure 49. Bottle, redware pressed relief, Chimu, Peru, ca. 1100-1470, Museo Nacional de Antropolog?a, Lima. Moore, in becoming the Yorkshire lad who rose to talk with the prime minister in front of the fire, embodied the notion "that a man was what he made himself." For an alternative view, see also Griselda Pollock, "Art, Art School, Culture: Individualism After the Death of the Artist," Block, 11, no. 1 (1985/86), pp. 10-13. 62. Edmund Carpenter (1978, pp. 192-203) suggests that, following on the heels of a highly popular, romantic account of the Eskimo, Canadian authorities in the 1950s promoted, as a solution to native unemployment, an Inuit art geared to the tourist trade. Artist James Houston, representing, first, the Canadian Handicraft Guild, and later, the government, helped implement this government policy by training native artists. According to Carpenter, Houston should be credited with helping to create a new art bringing much-needed financial assistance to Eskimos, but these carvings should not be represented falsely as traditional. Houston was an admirer and student of Moore, and as a result, says Carpenter, this new Eskimo style bears a more than coincidental resemblance to Moore's art. See also Carpenter, Oh, What a Blow That Phantom Gave Me! (New York, 1973), pp. 103-105. For a different view, see Richard Anderson, Art in Primitive Societies (New Jersey, 1979), pp. 174-179. Traditional Inuit art consisted of wooden, bone, and ivory implements elaborated for social rituals, but the new souvenir art is carved out of stone and functions in a very different way. It is produced by competitive individuals for a cash economy, and its resemblance to Moore's sculptures is meant to enhance its mass marketability.</page><page sequence="39">196 RES 17/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY Basler, Adolf, and Ernst Brummer 1928 UArt pr?colombien (Paris).
