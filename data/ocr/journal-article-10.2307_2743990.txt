Martin Byers I direct this essay to vindicating the claim that the Middle- Upper Palaeolithic transition manifests the earliest emergence of human symboling. Confirming this claim has wide archaeologi- cal implications, since it requires accepting the conclusion that all the activities of a symboling population are rule-governed and all their material culture has rule-governed style. I begin by ad- dressing the methodological obstacles to identifying symboling in the Palaeolithic by critiquing the views that symboling hu- mans typically perform two radically different behaviours, end- goal-directed and rule-governed, and that the meaning of material cultural style is adequately characterized as rule-governed refer- ence. To undo the methodological damage of these views I pre- sent an action-constitutive theory of material culture usage that treats style as a pragmatic rule-governed mode by which symbol- ing humans constitute all their material activities as the types of actions they intend. I support the claim that the emergence of symboling accounts for the transition by developing the implica- tions of two recent empirical analyses aimed at understanding material cultural style-the analyses of the Mousterian as an end-goal technology and of Aurignacian decorative body artifacts as warrants of action. A. MARTIN BYERS teaches anthropology and humanities at Va- nier College (82i Blvd. Ste. Croix, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H4L 3X9). Born in I937, he was educated at McGill University (B.A., I966; M.A., i969) and at the State University of New York at Albany (Ph.D., i987). His research interests are interpretive ap- proaches to prehistoric archaeology. He has published "Structure, Meaning, Action, and Things: The Duality of Material Culture Meaning" (Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour 2I:I-30) and "The Action-Constitutive Theory of Monuments: A Strong Pragmatist Version" (Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour 22:403-46). The present paper was submitted in final form 23 XII 93. The Middle-Upper Palaeolithic transition is character- ized by a radical change in lithic morphology and an apparently simultaneous shift from archaic to fully mod- ern human anatomy-in the context of a largely un- changing natural environment.' Demonstrating a causal role for symboling in this transition has been under- mined by Chase's (i99i) recent theoretical work on style, signs, and symbols. He concludes that it will be impossible to discern the operation of rule-governed meaning in the archaeological record prior to the late Upper Palaeolithic. Wynn (i9i) takes a syntactical ap- proach to the same problem, arguing that since, ac- cording to his research, linguistic and nonlinguistic skills are based on different organic structures of the brain, the likelihood of directly discerning symboling in the lithics of the Palaeolithic is small. Establishing the role of symboling in the transition requires dissolving this methodological impasse. To this end, I will first give my reading of the current theoretical and method- ological issues. I will go on to develop the theory that the intentional use of material culture by symboling hu- mans is rule-governed (Byers I99I, i992). From this per- spective I will critique both Wynn's examination of the "syntax" of material production, showing that implicit in his characterization of this behaviour is the exercise of rules, and Chase's theory of sign as he applies it to elucidating the meaning of material culture. These theo- retical critiques will dissolve the methodological im- passe. I will support my argument by drawing out the implications of Dibble's (I989, 1991) insightful analysis of the Mousterian as an end-goal technology and White's (I989, i992) analysis of the Aurignacian "decorative" traditions as what I call iconic warrants of action. This will strengthen and vindicate Mellars's (I989a, b, i99i) interpretive claim that the transition involved changes that only symboling humans could generate. I present this essay as a theoretical contribution to the discipline in the spirit expressed by Chase (i99i:i96): While I have introduced and am introducing a num- ber of definitions, none of them is new; and if I have turned to definitions from outside the archaeological literature, I have done so only when articulating someone's analysis of ideas directly relevant to the issue at hand. I see no reason archaeologists should shun the ideas of those who have thought long and hard about issues that concern us. Theoretical and Methodological Issues Behaviour directed by end-goal intentions I will term end-goal behaviour. It contrasts with symboling behav- iour, which is defined as intentional behaviour sub- sumed under or Loverned by rule. When end-Loal behav- I.

Material behaviour that is rule-governed, that is, symboling material behaviour, I will call material action. Most archaeologists would agree that the forms of material items mediating mate- rial behaviour are completely determined by the end- goal-directed intentions they are designed to satisfy- form is made to fit function, to overcome the objective constraints that would otherwise frustrate the user's in- tentions. A stone tool that can be used for slicing and cutting behaviours might be quite adequately character- ized as a butchering knife. I will argue, however, that since the forms of material items used to mediate material actions have the end- goal-directed intentions subsumed under rules, both the material forms and the objective outcomes they mediate are rule-governed. For example, A and B are two observ- ably different stone tools in a single assemblage whose design features allow their use for slicing and cutting of the same range of materials (i.e., they manifest isochres- tic variation). In end-goal terms, both mediate the same material behaviours. The variation must be explained as the outcome of different rules. One form of knife may be used to constitute the material action of sacrifice and the other to constitute the material action of butchering. As both knives are rule-governed in form, they are sym- boling media generating different material actions that emerge from the same objective, end-goal-directed mate- rial behaviours. For symboling humans, all the forms of the material things that they use to mediate material actions are caught up in these rules. In fact, their forms as rule-governed/end-goal-directed styles (i.e., symbol- ing styles) are essential constituents of the symboling behaviours they mediate. The rules stipulate the mode of behavioural forms, including the tool forms, by which the end-goal must be achieved if the material behaviour is to be and be understood as the fully successful mate- rial action that its performer intends (Byers I99I, i992). This is not to say that symboling humans are chroni- cally irrational with respect to how they achieve the end-goal aspects of their material actions. It is simply to point out that the rules constituting the material actions stipulate the range of practical material modes through which the end-goal-directed intentions must be satisfied if the material behaviours are to be fully successful ma- terial actions. Non-symboling human populations perform only ma- terial behaviors, symboling human populations material actions. The causal factors underwriting the material cultural assemblages mediating material behaviours and material actions overlap but are not congruent. In both cases the aspect relevant to achieving end-goal-directed intentions is equally subject to the natural objective en- vironmental constraints and to the cognitive capacities and manipulative skills of the producer/users.2 For ma- terial action, however, rules are also among the causal factors. The exercise of rules always generates a surplus element, an overdetermination of form with respect to the end-goal requirements. The concatenation of these cultural rules and objective factors is responsible for the material cultural style of symboling humans. The same objective factors minus the overdetermining effect of rules are responsible for the material cultural style of non-symboling humans.3 The immediate methodological implication of these distinctions is that I can posit two contrasting types of intention-based assemblages: style-i assemblages, medi- ating material behaviours, and style-2 assemblages, me- diating material actions. If I were to compare two inde- pendent style-i assemblages produced by separate populations of the same non-symboling hominid type and governed in their form by equivalent end-goal- directed intentional behaviours adapted to the same ob- jective conditions, because of the absence of the overde- termination effect of rules it is logically consistent to predict that these would be indistinguishable (contra Sackett I982).4 It is only because of factors extraneous to the two assemblages, such as geographical distances separating them, that there would be grounds for assum- ing that they were mutually independent (Dibble I989, i99i). But because of the observable effect of the rules subsuming end-goal-directed intentions, if I were to compare two independent style-2 utilitarian assem- blages adapted to the same range of objective constraints as those to which the style-i assemblages were subject, they would look quite different from each other while differing equally from the style-i assemblages. The ob- servable differences that constitute this style-i/style-2 distinction could only be caused by the emergence and :peration of rules. According to the views I will develop here, this distinction will appear in the archaeological record as a characteristic rupture in formal continuity. [n my view Mellars has delineated the appearance of :ne such rupture in his summary characterization of the major attributes of the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic tran- sition as it appears in southwestern Europe (ig8ga:354). [There] would seem to be three aspects of technologi- cal change which largely defy explanation in simple functional terms: i. The rapid changes in tool mor- phology at frequent and closely spaced intervals throughout the Upper Palaeolithic sequence; 2. The equally complex patterning of Upper Palaeolithic 2. See Alexander (i989) for a summary of the quite extensive range of cognitive capacities involved and Wynn (I 99 I) for analyses of the range of skills that a study of the material culture of non-symboling hominids would probably reveal. 3. As will become apparent, this position accords neither with Sackett's notions of isochrestic variation, social tradition as dictat- ing isochrestic choice, the nature of style, etc. (i982, I985, i986a, b, I990), nor with Wiessner's (i983, I985, I990) referentialist em- blematic/assertive model. 4. Sackett's views entail the position that functional task always underdetermines utilitarian form and isochrestic "style" is the re- sult of social tradition's overdetermining form by fiat. In contrast, I argue that underdetermination applies only if end-goal-directed intentions are subsumed under rules that are part of the intentions of the producers. It will be seen that I take this to be the primary point of Dibble's notion of end-product as compared to end-use forms (Clark and Lindly I989; Chase i99i; Dibble I989, I99I).</page><page sequence="3">BYERS Symboling and the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic Transition I 37I tool forms in spatial and geographical terms; 3. The much more conspicuous element of "imposed form" and "morphological standardization" apparent in the majority of Upper Palaeolithic tool forms, in con- trast to the much more variable, relatively unstan- dardized forms characteristic of the majority of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic tools. It has been argued, however, that these aspects alone are inadequate empirical evidence to support the claim that rule-governed or symboling behaviour had a causal role to play in the transition. For example, Chase (i99i), following Sackett, also recognizes isochrestic variation as the result of overdetermination of end-goal form, but he treats it as the unintentional and ubiquitous result of all productive activity-whether carried out by sym- boling or by non-symboling humans. Therefore, it has a randomizing effect that masks the operation of rules and makes discerning symboling in the record impossible. In contrast, I will argue that, rather than isochrestic vari- ation's masking symboling, the conditions that make isochrestic variation possible constitute style 2, and, pace Sackett (i982, I985, i986a, b, i990), isochrestic variation is rule-governed form. However, there is a more serious problem. This is the claim that because it developed by largely imperceptible evolutionary steps (Clark and Lindly I989, Duff, Clark, and Chadderdon i992), the emergence of symboling could not possibly produce a rupture in the archaeological record. I consider this claim to be serious, for it rests on the theoretical assumption shared by many archaeologists that symbol- ing is a part-time and mentally effortful activity. The prevailing opinion seems to be that even for modern hu- mans symboling is a part-time activity and that for the most part humans can achieve their practical end-goals independently of rules, in fact often eschewing rules for efficiency's sake. Consequently, for prehistoric material tasks to be rule-governed either would require urgent reasons or the exercise of rules must have had such ma- jor adaptive advantages that the inefficiencies their use might manifestly generate would be overridden by their hidden benefits (Wiessner i983). Of course, as these ben- efits would be unknown to the actors, the contradictory conclusion is that prehistoric humans were acting ac- cording to rule-based intentions for reasons of which they were ignorant (for a strong antifunctionalist argu- ment, see Giddens I976, I979, i984). Chase's (i99i:2o9) paper reflects both the part-time-symboling and the isochrestic-masking-effect argument: [Style] and standardization constitute poor evi- dence-and the imposition of arbitrary form consti- tutes no evidence-for symboling. This does not mean that Lower or Middle Paleolithic style and standardization were never symbolic in nature. What it does mean is that they never had to be symbolic in nature, and therefore that symboling cannot be in- ferred from style or standardization alone . . . al- though it is quite possible that the capacity for sym- boling existed. The isochrestic argument underlies his claim that dem- onstrating style and standardization in the archaeologi- cal record is insufficient to substantiate claims of sym- boling, and his suggestion that "it is quite possible that the capacity for symboling existed" among archaic hu- man populations expresses the part-time-symboling ar- gument. If we accept this, then it will be impossible to identify symboling in the record prior to the late Upper Palaeolithic because it will be impossible to disprove that populations possessing the capacity for symboling chose not to exercise it or that they exercised it in ways that left no enduring record (Bednarik i992). Underlying these views is a complex reductionist view of biological evolution, mind, action, and meaning. According to it, just as the evolutionary transformation of brain structures involved growth and addition of new structures to the old, so the cognitive capacities of the language centre were developed in areas of the brain that were separate from and came after the areas underwrit- ing end-goal-directed intentional behaviour. This means that rule-governed behaviour such as speech and end- goal-directed behaviour such as hunting are normally performed independently of each other. This segregative model of the human mind promotes the view that we are justified in dividing human behaviours into two in- dependent spheres, symboling and non-symboling. The latter is treated as a natural human mental state, while the former is viewed as occurring only by our inten- tional exercise of will. It is this dualistic model that Wynn (i99i) espouses and that is implicitly assumed by Chase (i9i). Furthermore, although Sackett (I982, I985, i986a, b, I990) opposes the intentional "add-on" model of style that the segregative view encourages, his notion of isochrestic style and his debate with Wiessner (i985, i990) depend on the same separation of utilitarian and rule-governed expressive behaviours. For him (and to a lesser degree for Wiessner i982, i985), social tradi- tion enters the productive intentions of the artisans only if they make the special effort of acting according to rules. Otherwise it exists independently of their inten- tions while "dictating" their choices. Together these two arguments generate the conclusion that not only can we not count on identifying the emergence of sym- boling in the archaeological record but this "emergence" may never have occurred as an identifiable episode. I will develop a theoretical approach to mind, intention, meaning, and action that challenges these views and more adequately characterizes the way we-as symbol- ing animals-actually use material culture in mediating our symboling behaviour. In this way I will overcome the methodological impasse that the segregative and isochrestic arguments have produced. Reflexivity and Human Symboling Rather than focusing on material cultural objects as symbols, passive items that "bear" meaning, I will focus on how we use them as material constituents of our symboling material behaviour-our material action.</page><page sequence="4">3721 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 35, Number 4, August-October 1994 Human symboling behaviour is dependent on our ability to monitor our own monitoring, that is, reflexive moni- toring (or, more simply, reflexivity). In everyday activity we act and react in routine, taken-for-granted ways, sus- taining an implicit "keeping in touch" reflexivity with the world. Giddens (1979:44) calls this practical con- sciousness,5 and he contrasts it with what he calls dis- cursive consciousness. We most acutely experience dis- cursive reflexivity, for example, when we do something we know we ought not to and are caught doing it. We have a crisis of self-consciousness, feeling almost im- pelled to give an account of our actions. This crisis can be experienced as mild to acute embarrassment, extreme shame, or self-disgust (Harre I979). Human reflexivity is characterized by the ease with which we can mentally shift from practical to discursive reflexive monitoring. This effortless shifting I take to be the basis of what Fay (i987) has called wilfulness, the tendency of curious, intelligent, reflexive beings to modify their behaviour on the basis of their reflexive understanding of their own mental contents. I am inclined to the view that generat- ing and sustaining rule-governed behaviour requires this effortless reflexivity. Hence, the relevant contrast for symboling/non-symboling is not the presence/absence of reflexivity but the emergence of effortless reflexivity from a pre-existing state of effortful reflexivity. Since we have only our own species-specific experi- ence to draw on in order to model effortful reflexivity, possibly exploring the awareness that seems characteris- tic of very young children will be helpful. It is clear that they possess a form of reflexivity, for they must have this to learn a language. But as their reflexivity is not developed initially to the degree required to promote self-consciousness, it may be a reasonably good basis for modeling the effortful reflexivity I am positing for non-symboling humans. That is, to learn a very complex expressive skill without being self-conscious presup- poses a form of effortful rather than effortless reflexiv- ity-a practical attitude towards and use of conventions. When reflexivity is effortful, there are fewer occasions for wilful activity, since shifting to the discursive level of self-awareness will almost always be externally insti- gated and mentally laborious.6 Hence, both instigating and sustaining this state will require special, non- routine externally derived conditions that rupture the everyday flow of practical life. With the return to "nor- mality," practical consciousness will re-emerge and the force of routine will be reasserted. When disruptive cir- cumstances recur, past response behaviours will have been almost forgotten, requiring "reinvention" rather than reconstruction. This characterization of reflexivity contrasts with that presented by Davidson and Noble (i 989: I 3 2), who argue that reflexivity is learned through mimicry and depiction: "The effect of depiction, we hypothesize, is to transform communication from a system of context- dependent signals, howsoever elaborate and organized as to syntactic sequence, into a system of reference inde- pendent of context-that is, a system productive of re- flection and hence of narrative." Since reflexivity for them entails taking an "attitude of reference to the per- ceived world" (p. i25) and reference entails language, they appear to identify reflexivity and language as the simultaneous learning effect of mimicry and depiction. In my view reflexivity is not something that is learned. We can learn a language but not the reflexivity that makes it possible, and we can learn to depict absent objects only if we already have effortless reflexivity. Re- flexivity is a material precondition for learning such skills as speech, and effortless reflexivity is essential to all symboling activity. The perceptual/behavioural ex- periencing of symboling humans can be characterized as a constant, effortlessly reflexive pursuit of socio-organic life. My suggestion is that possessers of effortful reflexivity would be very effective learners of complex everyday end-goal-directed productive activities, and they would anproblematically pass these on, as non-rule-governed conventions, to the next generation as part of the social- ization embedded in daily routine. They would never (or at least would insufficiently) experience them as having rule force. These routines would be learned social prac- tices but nevertheless not moral, constitutive conven- tions. Only effortless reflexivity can sustain the level and intensity of self-awareness of others and their opin- ions of oneself that is required to transform everyday practical formulae and recipes into collective constitu- tive standards and moral ideals. Because abstraction re- 4uires discursive awareness of one's own mental states 'Bhaskar I979), I take reflexivity to be the cognitive pre- aondition for abstract thought-the mental ability to ex- perience objects (whether present or absent), behaviours, 3tates, and locales as having properties that are not im- mediately present to the senses. Low-level abstract thought is limited to the perception of dispositional properties, for example, "seeing" that a stone can be used to produce cutting tools by learning to note from its lustre and mass that it will fracture on impact into 3harp flakes. Effortless reflexivity includes and goes be- yond this, allowing or even entailing perceiving key fea- tures of objects and their contexts as being in "contact with" or are endowed with non-empirical properties, -.g., ownership, authority, or sacredness. These are vir- tual properties, existing outside of time and space. Their 5. "(People) pay attention to events going on around them in such a way as to relate their activity to those events . . . refers to the reflexive monitoring of conduct by human agents, largely in the sense of what I have called practical consciousness" (Giddens I979: 44). Practical consciousness or practical reflexivity must not be confused with "the unconscious" as a source of motivation or with unconsciousness. The former may have real motivating effect on our behaving, but for symboling humans this behaving must still be generated and assessed according to cultural rules. That is, just how to behave in response to the unconscious motive still requires having reflexive awareness of the rules that constitute the action. 6. The effort might be compared to learning how to drive while trying to get to one's home. The means keep getting "in the way," making focusing attention on achieving the home goal very ef- fortful. But even this example, involving a fully reflexive human, probably does not adequately characterize the discursive-awareness mode of the effortfully reflexive human. We "internalize" the rules as enabling mechanisms that structure our driving intentions and simply drive where we intend, often while chatting with a passen- ger.</page><page sequence="5">BYERS Symboling and the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic Transition | 373 reality may reside only in the collective behavioural/ perceptual experiencing of a population of effortlessly reflexive individuals.7 Effortless reflexivity not only allows this second-order abstract thinking but "virtually" entails it, and it be- comes a social tradition with conventional force-that is, moral-constitutive force. Effortful reflexivity, in con- trast, is not conducive to sustained discursive aware- ness, and therefore the behaviour motivated by even low-level abstract end-goals will not be underwritten by rule-governed social traditions. It will be manifested in the record as non-utilitarian forms of material expres- sion that are erratic in patterning or what Chase and Dibble (i992) might term "non-repetitive." The notion of effortful reflexivity may therefore account for many of the empirical data of the Palaeolithic that cannot be accounted for in terms of everyday end-goal-directed routines, most if not all of these apparently from Lower and Middle Palaeolithic contexts (Bednarik I992, Chase I99I, Chase and Dibble i992, Duff, Clark, and Chadder- don i992, Marshack I989a). The Action-Constitutive Theory of Material Cultural Meaning INTENTIONALITY AND MEANING I shall take an action-constitutive approach to the mean- ing of material culture use by symboling humans, ex- tending to all non-linguistic behaviour Searle's (I969, I979, I983) theory of Intentionality and his related the- ory of speech action. In linguistic terms, pragmatics ap- plies to the rules that govern the sign-user relation, and these are embedded in the grammatical rules, including syntax, upon which we draw by way of forming our lin- guistic utterances. In doing so we constitute them as our intended speech actions (or writings), thereby ful- filling our wants and (largely unintentionally) realizing and reproducing our beliefs and social structures (Bhaskar I 979). In Searle's theory of mind, Intentionality is our ability to attend to the world, a mental "direct- edness." Intentional states are always about something, whether we are treating of beliefs and thoughts, wants and desires, or intentions and perceptions. An intention or intentionality, in the lower-case sense, is the form of mental attentiveness that is particularly relevant to this paper, since it is that state of mind that usually requires some behavioural stream and its material outcome to be satisfied. To have the serious intention that can be expressed in the utterance "I promise to hoe the garden" entails performing a behaviour that will satisfy this ex- pressed intention. Because the behaviour is the condi- tion of satisfaction of the intention, it is an intentional 1~h'ih7irvin r irr if it iQ 3 11"-1 vc Tr1,fA h'hAviir 'ifln 'r- tion). The meaning of the behaviour, then, is determined by the nature of the intention that it is satisfying. The gardener, for example, may also intend to wash the clothes later. These two intentions require two different forms of behaviour because they have different contents. The content of one stipulates a set of conditions to be brought about that satisfies gardening intentions, the content of the other stipulates a set of conditions that satisfy clothes-washing intentions. Hence, the meaning of a behaviour is the content of the intention with which it is performed. In Searle's (i983:28) terms, "Meaning exists only where there is a distinction between Inten- tional content and the form of its externalization, and to ask for the meaning is to ask for an Intentional con- tent that goes with the form of externalization." I am simplifying, of course, in two ways. First, I am emphasizing only the intention-behaviour relation, but, given the effortless reflexivity of symboling humans, in- tention-behaviour relations are only analytically isola- ble moments of the ongoing behavioural/perceptual ex- periencing of the active, wilful human. Second, I am focusing on a single intention, whereas intentional be- haviour is usually only the most apparent aspect of a complex set of "prior intentions"-explicit and/or implicit plans, strategies, and goal pursuits. Any given behaviour implicates a network and background of Intentionality. Searle's claim is that every state of Inten- tionality has conceptual contents-representations. Representational contents of intention complexes could be referred to as action templates, the "models" of per- formance, including material outcomes, that the sub- jects must realize in behaviour to satisfy their intentions (Harre I979). Templates are not necessarily fixed, al- though this is probably one type-what Wynn (I99I) calls string-of-beads sequences. However, because inten- tions are always caught up in implicit and explicit plans and strategies, they are usually hierarchically structured constellations of representations, with certain key fea- tures of the end-goal template as the organizing factor. Wynn (I99I:I96-97) describes both sorts well: Constellations are not like string-of-beads sequences because they are not learned by rote memorization. Rather, they come into existence at the time of use. Their constituent elements are determined by the task at hand, especially by visual images which the artisan has of the goal.... [In trial-and-error behav- iour] the artisan envisions a goal, which calls up ap- propriate notions of tools, motor sequences, etc. He then proceeds until failure, revises his constellation, begins again, and so on. The dynamic interplay between goal and constellation takes place in ac- tion.... [In contingency planning] reversibility is a characteristic of thinking . . . where failures are an- ticipated and alternative procedures prepared ahead of time.... modern tool behaviour incorporates both. What he leaves out is that, in the terms described earlier, the content of these representational constellations will be infused with rule-based conventional power.

Of course, perceiving objects as mediating virtual (and therefore abstract) properties entails objectifying them so that they are taken by the perceiver to have these as natural properties. Only effort- lessly reflexive humans can constitute and experience a reified world, a world that exists only for and in their understanding (Gid- dens I976, I979, i984).</page><page sequence="6">374 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 35, Number 4, August-October I994 tne proctuctive constellations into rule-intusect represen- tations is effortless reflexivity, symboling humans are "fated" to transform their "emergent" templates into standards by which they assess their own behaviours and those of their neighbours as appropriate or inappro- priate, felicitous or infelicitous actions. Chase (I99I: 205) treats standardization as an average. In contrast, I am using the term in the conventional rule sense. I be- lieve this is also the sense Mellars (I989a:354) is using in characterizing the Upper Palaeolithic tools as having a "much more conspicuous element of 'imposed form' and 'morphological standardization."' For effortlessly reflexive humans, their standards are pragmatic rules, and, when realized in material culture, they constitute the material behaviours as rule-governed material ex- pressions of the intentions these behaviours satisfy, thereby transforming these behaviours into their in- tended material actions. Pragmatic templates as rules are constitutive in na- ture rather than referential. Constitutive rules can be expressed as "Doing X will count as a Y" or "Under condition A, doing X will be (count as) a Y" (Searle I969). Speech is the classic case of rule-governed behav- iour, but because we associate reference so closely with speech and I am arguing that material action is, in gen- eral, non-referential, games are a more useful illustra- tion. Also, games are almost always materially medi- ated. The intention to play football presupposes knowledge of the rules, and the actual playing entails drawing on these rules in constituting football inten- tions and behaving accordingly. Hence, "Doing X with the football (i.e., an object that must conform to the football rules that constitute it as a football) under con- ditions i, 2, and 3 will count as a score (Y)." Or, "In hockey, at the end of the fourth quarter (A), the team with the highest score (X) will count as and be the win- ner (Y)." These are pragmatic rules, and their full real- ization in behavioural forms transforms the particular complex of reciprocal material behaviours so that it is and counts as-is constituted as-the game X. Material things such as footballs and helmets are not used to refer to the football games they constitute. In- deed, they are not used to refer to anything at all (a point Searle [i969] makes in reference to chess pieces). They nevertheless have implicative meaning, invoking or calling into existence, that is, instantiating, a structure of rules that constitutes the football rule paradigm. This rule paradigm also implicates a history of games making up the standard body of knowledge that is required to be able to participate in the football culture. To pick up the football with the intention to play is to invoke and participate in reproducing/transforming this reality. This is itself situated as part of the society's whole sports paradigm, and so on. When it serves as the con- tent of sports intentions, it takes the form of normative standards stipulating the range of behaviours that will count as the intended activities (e.g., football) and how well/poorly one "plays the game." A serious mischaracterization of the rule-governed meaning of material culture is to confuse its action- constitutive nature with the referential meaning of words. This confusion rests on the simple analogy that just as words have meaning because they are used to speak about things, so material culture has meaning be- cause it makes reference to its users. What I call referen- tialism (Byers I99I, i992) is characterized by a dual re- duction. First, our speech activity is taken as the paradigm of symboling behaviour, and what we do in speaking is characterized as communicating informa- tion by making reference to things, states of affairs, and so on; second, rule-governed material culture use is modeled as a second-class form of "silent" referencing, usually self-referencing or social referencing. Hence ob- jects manifest "style" just so that their users can "speak about" their social identities (Wiessner I983). But games are not about anything at all, in the referential sense, and even performing acts of reference is not a necessary or essential part of playing football. Of course, it is done, and often in ways that are frowned upon. For example, it is not good sportsmanship to insult the opposite team. But this regulative rule is not a constitutive rule that makes football, say, different from hockey. Even speech acts as acts cannot be adequately characterized referen- tially. As Searle (I969) argues, acts of reference are al- ways part of full speech acts such as commands, prom- ises, reports, expressions, etc. But even speech acts are contingent on the material things they require as con- stituent elements. For example, uttering the words "I do" or "We are at peace" or "You're fired!" will be the fully felicitous acts they are intended to be only if their performances are mediated by particular sets of objects as stipulated by the constitutive rules of the oral "games" being played. Reference hinges on the sign-referent relation, which is a stands-for, rule-governed convention. The word X stands for, points to, or designates the object Y. X is always a rule-governed substitute of Y and can never be actually identical to it (except in the rare case of ono- matopoeia or the use of a word to refer to itself). Refer- ence reaches out and artificially makes its referents pres- ent. By substituting for the real thing, the referential media, words, actually reinforce the absence of and qual- itative differences they have from their referents-a per- ceptual/behavioural effect I will call distancing. But ex- pression hinges on the sign-concept relation, which is the "counts-as" relation formed by constitutive rules. The behaviour X, performed according to constitutive rules, has expressive meaning because it counts as and makes present the intentions of the subject performing the behaviour. Expression here is intensional, reaching "in" to make present the conceptual contents of the be- having subject. The nature of expression is well put by Taylor (i985:2i9): "Something is expressed when it is embodied in such a way as to be made manifest. If you have an expressive face, I can see your joy and sorrow in your face. There is no inference here. . . . Expres- sions ... make our feelings manifest; they put us in the presence of people's feelings." Rule-governed expression as intensional cannot be re- duced to rule-governed, extensional reference. Rather</page><page sequence="7">BYERS Symboling and the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic Transition | 375 reference is contingent on successful rule-governed "counts-as" expression, since part of the semantic rule that binds the word "cat" to its referent, an actual feline, is the "counts-as" rule that constitutes the word as ex- pressing the speaker's concept (cat) and, in the context of a speech expression, manifesting the speaker's inten- tion to refer to a particular cat. Whereas words, either spoken or written, have referential stands-for meaning, material culture, in general, has only constitutive mean- ing. Players manifest their playing intentions by using the football according to the constitutive football rules and simultaneously transforming these material inter- ventions so that they count as and are the football plays they intend. These plays also implicate and make pres- ent the total football paradigm, reproducing the social reality they invoke. The implicative, manifesting and expressive effect that constitutive rules make possible is critical to the action-constitutive role played by material things, and in my view it is this sense of material cultural meaning that the postprocessualists are really trying to express in characterizing the "active nature" of the meaning of material things. But they frustrate their own intentions by expressing this idea in designative or referential terms.8 Each object gains meaning by "referring to or signifying" another signifying object whose meaning is gained by "referring" to another in an endless chain of "signifiers and significations" (Hodder i982a, b, c, I985, I989). As the referential objects are social position and self, this merely distances the subjects' actions from their intentions and allows meaning as a mental prop- erty to be displaced from the responsible agents, thereby eliminating intention as a real cause of action. Postpro- cessual analysis, in general, fails to make its pragmatic commitment explicit, and its use of a semiological and referential view prevents it from explaining why archae- ologists should take seriously the claim that humans "negotiate" their power relations with style (Moore I990; Olsen I990; Shanks and Tilley I987, I990; Tilley I990). As a result, postprocessualists are ambivalent about what they mean by the "meaning of things." Is this a signifying property of the objects, an intentional state of the users, or simply an artifact of the archaeolo- gist's methodology? Of course, the meaning the material cultural record of a given prehistoric people holds for the archaeologist will not be congruent with the meaning it held for those people. They used it to reproduce their organic and re- constitute their social lives; archaeologists use it as evi- dence to support their claims about the producers. To make these claims credible, they must assume that among the abstract objects of their meanings is the collective intentionalist meaning (i.e., the action- constitutive meaning) that was the content of the inten- tionality with which these people produced and used their material things. As an internal property of the pro- ducer/users' intentions, the intentionalist meaning of things was a real causal factor in their production and use, and this meaning presupposes the simultaneous ex- istence of real emergent social structures that, like the football team and its positions, would be the socio- material conditions of their effective use (Bhaskar I978, I979; Giddens I976, I979, I98I, I984; Harre I979). SPEECH ACTS AND MATERIAL ACTS Although it might be conceded that referentialism is in- adequate in characterizing the meaning of material cul- ture, few would accept that it is equally inadequate to characterizing our linguistic behaviours as speech acts. But, applied to linguistic utterances, referentialism leads to the absurd conclusion that what we take to be prom- ises merely refer to promises and what we take to be commands merely refer to commands-hence, in speak- ing we never actually make promises or give orders but only speak about them. What is missing in referen- tialism is the rule-based pragmatic dimension that is basic to constituting all our actions. Speech-act theorists characterize the pragmatic rule aspects of speech as illo- cutionary and perlocutionary rules (Austin I962; Searle I969, I979). The illocutionary meaning of a speech act is what we do in saying. In contrast, the perlocutionary meaning is what we do by saying. In speech, we make promises, give orders, ask questions, etc.; by speech we convince others that we are, for example, committed (and thereby commit ourselves) to certain courses of ac- tion, attempt to persuade others to fulfil demands we make, and, in general, transform the conditions of our own and others' ongoing activities. Illocutionary rules govern the forms of our utterances so that they count as and, therefore, are our intended speech acts (commands, promises, etc.). Syntactical order, performative verbs ("I swear that . . . ," "I promise that . . ."), tonal stress, etc., are the rule-governed sound properties that constitute our utterances as the speech acts we intend. Hence, these sound properties are constituted as intrinsic ele- ments of the speech actions they mediate, making speech an emergent phenomenon. In the same way I will argue that the rules of style govern the forms of things so that they are intrinsic ele- ments of the material actions they mediate. Hence, style-2 forms as rule-governed are constituent elements of the material actions they mediate, and the continuity and variation in style 2 is the ongoing result of symbol- ing humans' forming their material behavioural streams so that they are and count as their intended socio- material actions. Symboling behaviours, whether lin- guistic or non-linguistic utterances, then, are emergent phenomena, and the style of material culture used by symboling humans has transformative powers of the same order as the illocutionary pragmatic devices of speech. Applying this to material behaviours, I shall call the conventions equivalent to illocutionary rules the 2ction-constitutive rules of style. 8. Hodder (I985, I989, iggoa, b, c, i992) is certainly committed to a pragmatic position when arguing that things are not used as passive media reflecting social reality, but he saddles this insight with the burden of referentialism by characterizing this active meaning role in referential terms.</page><page sequence="8">376 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 35, Number 4, August-October I994 Many of our material actions require no speech ac- companiment at all, but this is not to deny that they entail speech actions. In fact, I have argued elsewhere (Byers I99I, i992) that every material action is the ma- terial condition of satisfaction of some actual or possible prior speech act that would account for its performance. A corollary is that many of our speech acts commit us to or implicate one or another material action or series of material actions. But material actions and material culture as their constituent elements are not to be treated as parasitic on speech acts-indeed, just the op- posite is the case. Few if any speech acts can be felici- tously performed without some set of material items as essential illocutionary elements. Social positions are characterized by the range of social powers they have (Barnes I988; Giddens I976, I979, I984). For the speech utterances of those occupying given positions to count as and be their intended speech acts (declarations, com- mands, assertions, etc.), they must be seen by relevant others as exercising the virtual properties of office. Sumptuary rules are equally action-constitutive and il- locutionary rules, and this makes the material objects that realize sumptuary rules illocutionary pragmatic de- vices. The commands of a sheriff who is not wearing a badge or the demands of a bailiff who is not bearing a court warrant are to one degree or another defective speech acts. In keeping with the expressive approach I am taking (Taylor I985), the implicative meanings of material cul- ture items can be characterized as invoking, ascribing, endowing, or calling upon the virtual properties that they stipulate. It is, I suggest, not accidental that these terms are most familiarly used in religious contexts. Reading from sacred texts, recitation of creation myths, chanting of hymns, and burning of incense, when done in the appropriate (rule-governed) material contexts, can be described by the observer in referential terms, but their meaning for the subjects must be characterized in expressive-constitutive terms. In reciting the sacred texts they invoke powers which transform their kinesic and oral utterances into acts of prayer, worship, and spir- itual renewal. Similarly, in wearing their badges sheriffs invoke and endow themselves with the virtual authority of the state as grounded in the collective reflexive under- standing of the populations and simultaneously trans- form their behaviours into the legal actions they intend (Bourdieu I99I). When the warranting authority represented by a mate- rial object is based on some perceived (real or imagined) structural association between it and the power source it represents, the material thing can be called an iconic warrant. The primary action-constitutive force of mate- rial things in most preindustrial societies is their role as iconic warrants.9 Resemblance in appearance, of course, is only one possible form of rule-stipulated association between an object and the reality it invokes. Resem- blance can be mediated by material association; winter ice-hunting tools made of sea mammal bone and ivory and summer land-hunting tools made of caribou antler maintain a "resemblance" relation with the animals that were their raw-material sources (McGhee I977). White (i992) expresses the same view by using the no- tions of metaphor, synecdoche, and metonymy to char- acterize this invocative, implicative meaning of things. But this figurative form of speech retains the shortcom- ings of the referential perspective. As metaphor and me- tonymy are non-literal forms of referential expression, it suggests a non-serious or "pretend" expressive intention that not only generates the distancing effect characteris- tic of the substitutive nature of reference but aggravates this effect by implying that the object of this figurative reference as mediated by the iconic warrant, for exam- ple, sacred authority, does not even exist. Again, Tay- lor's (I985) explicit expressive theory of meaning is more useful here. Taylor argues that prior to the emer- gence of the scientific view, language was an expressive medium and reference was usually wedded to invoca- tion; uttering a person's name was a "literal" exercise of power over that person.'0 Material things as iconic warrants are therefore best understood as mediating nei- ther metaphorical references nor metaphorical invoca- tions but as seriously endowing their producer/users with "real" powers. Material Signs, Syntax, and Reference A CRITICAL EXAMINATION For Wynn (i9i), modern humans display two different forms of behaviour, symboling and non-symboling. Their productive behaviour, and especially their learn- ing of it, can be exhaustively characterized in non- conventional, end-goal-directed terms. Therefore, the in- creased standardization of the Palaeolithic lithics does not constitute evidence of the emergence of symboling (p. I98, emphasis added): Because the observable characteristics of language and tool behaviour are so different, it is difficult to accept that they belong to the same cognitive do- main. Moreover, the similarities are so general that even a non-modular theory of cognition would give 9. See Douglas's (i982) discussion of the use of primitive money as a form of licensing, which, when linked to her cosmological theory (I966, I970, I975), makes clear the way in which material things are used to invoke the powers in the cosmos and to impose these structures on the locales of everyday and not-so-everyday life. io. For Taylor, to speak of a "bull" in a prescientific culture and to understand this reference entails knowing the position of bulls in the religious beliefs of the people. In his discussion of Levi- Strauss's totemism, he argues (i985:288): "It may be that there is nothing significant about religiously important animals around them, no criteria of identification, no important discriminations of types, which does not have its basis in myth.... The salient features may be the object of an aetiological myth (why do pigs have curly tails, why do moose have huge antlers? etc.). The man- ner in which the people concerned observe, classify, perceive these animals may be very thoroughly connected with the way the ani- mals figure in myth; so that no important feature is without its mythical significance and aetiology."</page><page sequence="9">BYERS Symboling and the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic Transition 1 377 us few grounds for using artefacts as evidence for grammar. We cannot use stone tools or pots as evi- dence for grammatical rules of any kind. Assumed here is that the physical patterns of the neuro- logical structures of the brain isomorphically structure thinking processes. Since material behaviour and speech behaviour are so different in complexity and detail and similar in only the most general of ways, it is unlikely "that they belong to the same cognitive domain." Only if material behaviours can be shown to be as complex as linguistic behaviours can we conclude that material behaviour may be a form of symboling based on rules equivalent to those of linguistic behaviour. The action-constitutive theory of material culture meaning holds that both speech actions and material actions are more complex than Wynn allows. Presum- ably, the "linguistic cognitive domain" governs not only phonological and morphological patterning but also the generative patterning of full sentence structure, with the result that part of its content would be sentential syn- tactical rules. But syntactical rules always have an illo- cutionary aspect. Although Wynn's characterization of the end-goal-directed aspect of human behavioural/per- ceptual experiencing is apt (fully conforming to the the- ory of Intentionality outlined earlier), it is incomplete as a description of the way symboling humans behave. It systematically excludes the consequence of our ef- fortless reflexivity, which transforms the templates of productive intentions into normative standards as ideals and rules-non-referential conventions. An action-con- stitutive reading of this same behavioural description injects this reflexivity into the process, transforming the procedures into end-goal-directed behaviours subsumed under the normative standard aspect of the representa- tional content. Finally, Wynn is confusing levels of comparison. His argument for the unique nature of syntactical structur- ing operates at the sentence level, but his analysis of material action examines a productive episode. This is like comparing writing a sentence to writing a novel." Novel writing is learned laboriously, just as working on a fish trawler (his example) is learned laboriously. Both require a long period of apprenticeship, and both call for action-constitutive skills in conducting oneself, from willingly accepting directions of the master to observing sumptuary rules, rules of deference, and so on. SIGN MEANING AS REFERENTIALISM Using Peirce's sign theory, Chase (iI99) defines all sign meaning as referential and then distinguishes the modes of generating this referential meaning as (i) natural signs (indexes), (2) resemblance signs (icons), and (3) rule- governed signs (symbols). Since all meaning, whether secured by natural, resemblance, or rule-governed means, is referential, the only thing unique about a sym- bol is that its reference meaning is done exclusively by rule. Part of the problem with this is that it lends sup- port to the part-time-symboling thesis. Indexical and iconic signs have "natural" referential meaning, and even when humans do start making rule-governed refer- ence they can persist in non-symbolic activity. In any case, characterizing the rule-governed meaning of things in referential terms is woefully inadequate, since from the involved subjects' perspective things have constitu- tive, active use meaning. The meaning resides not in things as indexes, icons, or symbols but in the intention- ality of the users. Since the action-constitutive view of material culture meaning dissolves Chase's argument that demonstrating symboling in the archaeological rec- ord requires demonstrating the exercise of rule-governed reference, this leaves the much simpler task of merely demonstrating the emergence of patterning in the ar- chaeological record that could only be the result of the exercise of rule-governed/end-goal-directed intention- ality. To do this requires showing that the overdetermining of patterning on which Sackett (I982, I985ca, b, I986, I990) bases his notion of isochrestic variation must be the exercise of rules and not the blind and routine exer- cise of tradition as he claims. As Sackett points out, despite the broad range of isochrestic possibilities opened up by the underdetermining of form by end-goal- directed intentions, invariably formal patterning emerges that is recognizable to the archaeologist as style. He attributes this to ethnic or social tradition, and for him style is the unintentional result of social tradition impelling artisans in their end-goal-directed in- tentional production-unless this styling is purpose- fully (i.e., intentionally!) added. The logical consequence of this view is that somehow social tradition must al- ways be an external force surreptitiously imposing its constraints on the working producers. "The decisions artisans make among the isochrestic options potentially open to them are dictated in large part by the craft tradi- tions in which they have been enculturated as members of social groups" (Sackett I986a:63o, emphasis added). Chase (I99I) picks up on this and argues that the "arbi- trary" nature of isochrestic variation is actually the out- come of socially habitual or routine material production without any rules at all. This identification of habit or routine with the ab- sence of intention displays the lack of both an adequate theory of consciousness which allows for levels of awareness and a theory of Intentionality which can be used to treat cultural rules as action causes. For both Sackett and Chase, symboling has to be fully discursive productive behaviour. But, if routine is understood as rule-governed productive activity performed in the prac- tical mode of consciousness, then its status as inten- tional and rule-governed activity is ensured. In sitting down to produce arrows of the standard type (Wiessner i983), San male adult artisans routinely draw on their rule paradigms of material production to constitute rep- resentational content, and in realizing this in their ma- terial behaviours they routinely produce tools which ii. See Ricoeur (I976, I978) for a discussion of the structural differ ences between genres of expressive thought.</page><page sequence="10">37X8 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 35, Number 4, August-October I994 will make their material killing behaviours fully felici- tous material hunting actions. Because the artisans act in accordance with rule-structured intentions to pro- duce arrows as proper hunting warrants rather than to reproduce an arrow style as such, the aggregate conse- quence in the record which we recognize as style would not itself have been part of the content of their produc- tion intentions. For this reason the continuity of pat- terning that we recognize as style is correctly character- ized as largely unintentional (see Bhaskar I979). Perhaps this is what Sackett means by saying that the "isochres- tic options potentially open to them are dictated in large part by the craft traditions." But if so, the craft traditions must be rules, and they can "dictate" form only because they are the structural content of routine production in- tentions-in which case the isochrestic options would exist only in the understanding of the archaeologist and not in the understanding of the artisans. When Wiessner asked her San informants how they would react to finding an animal in their territory killed by a strange arrow, they responded that "they would be worried about the possibility that a stranger was nearby about whom they knew nothing at all. [They] said that if a man makes arrows in the same way [as they do], one could be fairly sure that he shares similar values around hunting, land rights, and general conduct (i983: 269, emphasis added). Their explanation fully realizes the action-constitutive view. People using strange arrows are not trustworthy, because the strange style implicates a lack of paradigmatic knowledge of the rules and conventions of hunting and "general conduct." It is clear that the San's concern embraces the totality of cultural rules and principles which situates the rules of hunting and which the latter implicate. Style is pro- duced not to communicate information about one's so- cial and personal identity but to constitute that identity. Style is necessary to endow oneself with the virtual properties of the social position one occupies so as to constitute one's material actions, discharge one's social duties, and realize oneself as the social person one be- lieves oneself to be and wishes to be taken for. End-Goal and End-Product Technologies Once the capacity for effortless reflexivity has become characteristic of the majority of the population, all be- havioural practice will be caught up in rule paradigms. Therefore the emergence of symboling will mark an identifiable episode in the archaeological record as a rup- ture resulting from the ongoing fulfilment of all the util- itarian end-goal-directed requirements of human organic life while manifesting a superfluity of patterning that cannot be analytically reduced to them. This is what I have called the style-i /style-2 distinction. Harrold's (i989) analysis of the formal relations between the Mousterian, Chatelperronian, and Aurignacian in south- western France nicely exemplifies this variation. The Chatelperronian and early Aurignacian style-2 assem- blages appear synchronously and largely sympatrically and share traits typical of the early Upper Palaeolithic blade industries. Each is more like the other than either is like the preceding Mousterian-although Harrold also concludes that the Chatelperronian is more closely re- lated to the Mousterian than is the Aurignacian. The abruptness of this rupture hinges on the emer- gence of blade industries and the end-product technolo- gies they manifest. Dibble (i989, i99i) argues that the shift in tool technology represented by the Middle- Upper Palaeolithic transition is the result of the replace- ment of end-goal technology by end-product technology. Focusing on the racloir (side scraper) category, he sug- gests that the highly variable range of "types" is best understood as the consequence of a systematic reduc- tion of flakes through various stages of tool use, each reduction stage being a different form of working edge. These different forms are the material outcome of ratio- nally maximizing the working edge of the stone, given objective conditions. None, in his estimation, consti- tutes a type, defined as an end-product form intended specifically to mediate different types of behaviours. "[Typological] variation among these tools . . . reflects continuous reduction of the pieces through resharpening and remodification until the eventual discard. In this case, the presence of such types would not be relevant to the recognition of symbolic thought" (Dibble i989:4I7).12 When Dibble uses the term "end-product type," he is referring to the form of the tool itself. When I speak about tools in end-goal terms, I am referring to the objec- tive material transformations their use is intended to bring about. When a utilitarian item like the racloir can be exhaustively analyzed in end-goal terms without being an end-product tool, it follows that it does not display the exercise of rules, end-goal-directed inten- tionality having fully determined its form. Dibble's dis- tinction between end-goal and end-product tools, then, highlights the conditions under which isochrestic varia- tion cannot emerge-when behaviour is directed by a relentless end-goal-directed intentionality. The absence of isochrestic variation that this form of intentionality entails is what I will call the affordance effect, and it is the outcome of subjects' producing and using material culture items in terms of their direct perception of the way in which the properties of objects will satisfy their end-goal-directed intentions. For example, the disposi- tional properties of chert and flint are directly perceived as affording the possibility of producing sharp flakes, and the sharpness of these flakes is directly perceived as af- fording the possibility of slicing and cutting. Stones whose properties do not directly signify that they are good for flaking may signify by their size that they are good for convenient grasping and by their mass and lus- trp that tlhev allnw the nnqqihilitv of crackinp bones. and i2. Also see Clark and Lindly (i989) for a brief discussion of other objective constraints that would account for the variation in the Mousterian.</page><page sequence="11">BYERS Symboling and the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic Transition 1 379 so on. I Accorling to Ulb5son II979; see also Hett i989) all active sentient beings directly perceive the affordan- ces of things and do so in the same way (Gibson I979: 38): Water causes the wetting of dry surfaces. It affords bathing and washing, to elephants as well as hu- mans. Streams of water can be dammed, by beavers as well as children and hydraulic engineers. Ditches can be dug and aqueducts built. Pots can be made to contain water, and then it affords pouring and spill- ing. Water, in short, has many kinds of meaning. According to Davidson and Noble (i989:I29), "A the- ory such as Gibson's is entirely adequate to the task of explaining how all organisms (including humans for much of their everyday lives) achieve this unself- conscious coherence with respect to their environ- ments." But in the action-constitutive view this theory encourages distancing human intention and meaning, for it promotes treating meaning as a property of things rather than as a mental property of intentional subjects. The pre-existing objective, invariant structures are meaning, and in directly perceiving or "picking up" these structures from the ambient array humans directly "pick up" the meaning that is "out there."''4 Hence, for Davidson and Noble, if reflexivity and mind are to have any ontological status they must be constituted through the construction of referential signs by humans directly perceiving that their gestures mimic the forms of ani- mals or that their depictions resemble animals of which they are depictions. Constructing things to resemble the directly perceived meaning that is in and of things con- structs that mental capacity to "make reference" from which emerges speech, language, and reflexivity. "It is the making of things to be similar to others that pro- vokes, or at least facilitates, the seeing of similarity be- tween those things, or naturally occurring environmen- tal features, and the things they resemble" (p. I30). I find ecological perception theory a mischaracteriza- tion of the way in which a symboling human perceives and acts in the world. It denies the interpretive role that the culture of a symboling human population must play in people's constituting of their behavioural/perceptual experiencing in and of the world. For this very reason, however, it is particularly apt for describing the "unme- diated" way in which a non-symboling human popula- tion would perceive and behave in its world. What it clearly highlights is the absence in their everyday rou- tine of abstract thought (Heft i989:i6): The illuminating quality of a flame emerges from in- tentions concerning the lighting of a setting; and its heating quality arises out of intentions such as to boil water. Both properties inhere in the object; a candle gives off both light and heat. Which one of these properties is functionally significant and is ex- perienced at a particular time depends on the inten- tional character of the perceiver's actions at that time. Heft is attempting to define meaning as both objective, that is, inhering in the object, and subjective, inhering in the intention of the agent and thereby in the relation that binds them. I think that Heft's attempt to introduce intentionality into direct perception theory fails, but what his description does illuminate is the low level and intensity of abstract thought that an effortfully reflexive human population would be able to sustain. This mind envisioned by ecological perception theory, then, is in- capable of routinely and effortlessly treating things as media for reaching beyond immediate appearances to ab- stract but real (or imagined) worlds. The affordance effect is the result of the relentless application of end-goal-directed intentionality to the production of material things. It is realized in the record as an end-goal technology, and it will generate non- isochrestic, style-i material cultural assemblages- varying according to the particular hominid species and its (non-symboling) capacities. When the same end-goal- directed intentionality is subsumed under rules, the whole of material production and action is rule- governed. This will result in end-product isochrestic technologies realized as style-2 assemblages-varying according to the particular rules of style characteristic of a historically situated population of symboling humans. Only with effortless reflexivity can this transformation occur, for only then can the overdetermination of form that I have identified as isochrestic variation emerge- and it does so as a result of the transformation of the socialization process itself as the received affordance know-how is transformed into normative standards, ide- als, and rules that govern the production of end-product technologies. End-scrapers may be the by-product of a rule-based need for producing blades as blanks to make knives, projectile points, etc., which implicate the cul- I3. This term "affordance" has been coined by Gibson (I979) to characterize what he takes to be the objective meaning that things have, and this meaning is and resides in the affordance properties. Another way of saying this is that the objective affordance proper- ties are the meaning, and the meaning is picked up from the ambi- ent array (of the light) by the active perceiver. "Once the control [of fire] is learned by the adult and the child, fire affords many benefits besides warmth and illumination. It allows the cooking of food substances and the boiling of water in pots. It permits the glazing of clay and the reduction of minerals to metals. Fire, like water, has many meanings, meaning uses, meaning values" (Gib- son I979:38-39). I4. In a recent paper, Noble (I994) has clearly rejected this empiri- cist treatment of meaning. Nevertheless he maintains that the term "meaning" is applicable only to the derived intentionality of speech: "Exceptionally, meaning may, from time to time, enter the picture as part of, and as (exclusively) due to, human discourse about what is perceived. If that argument can be sustained, then an issue to consider is how the capacity for such discursive (linguistic) activity might have arisen in human evolution.... [What] emerged in the course of human evolution was the capacity for making and exchanging signs which were themselves perceived as associated with what else could be perceived-a new sort of invariant. Only thereafter could 'meaning' emerge as a feature of this (linguistic) behaviour, as referential invariants became open to question" (p. 380). Here he rejects Gibson's objectification of meaning and relo- cates it where I believe it belongs, in the active subject. But, partly because of his commitment to referentialism, he holds to his view that reflexivity is a capacity emergent from language.</page><page sequence="12">380 I CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 35, Number 4, August-October I994 tural paradigms that only a full and reputable membe of the community would know. Once this larger en tailment emerges, the overdetermination of form be comes inevitable.'5 The earliest known full expression in the human ar chaeological record of symboling mediated by style-: material culture assemblages is the Middle-Uppe: Palaeolithic transition. The three characteristics of the transition that Mellars (I989a, I989b, 199I) specifies- (i) rapid and frequent morphological changes, (2) comr plex regional patterning, and (3) more conspicuous "im posed form" and "morphological standardization' (ig8ga:354)-are most reasonably interpreted as consti tuting and being constituted by the emergence of sym boling. This suggests for southwestern Europe a rathei abrupt emergence of effortless reflexivity. The precis( mechanisms undergirding this process will have to b( the subject of another essay, but if it occurred in situL it would mean that the pre-existing style-i Mousteriar traditions, until that moment realizing the efficient ap plication of end-goal rationality to overcome objective constraints (Binford i989), would be the "raw material' on which effortless reflexivity would work, trans forming it into rule-governed, end-product technology." Since effortless reflexivity overdetermines form, th( action-constitutive theory cannot be used to predict pre. cisely what material forms this symboling will take. It does, however, justify the claim that early symbolinE populations will necessarily generate style-2 assem. blages whereby, as iconic warrants, they can rationally and legitimately intervene behaviourally in the sacrec natural jurisdictions of the world (Douglas I966, I970 I975, I982). Therefore it can be used to warrant thai widely distributed material culture forms that are not accounted for in affordance terms are most coherently interpreted as iconic warrants. I consider this to be the case for the Aurignacian bead and pendant industry. Ac- cording to White (i989:385), It is clear . . . that the Aurignacian body ornamenta- tion explodes onto the scene in southwest France during the early Aurignacian.... It appears to have been complex conceptually, symbolically, techni- cally and logistically right from the very beginning. Thus, it is totally unreasonable to see Aurignacian body ornamentation as somehow formative of or transitional to a Magdalenian florescence. This sud- den, intrusive, and complex character of the earliest body ornamentation remains one of the greatest ex- planatory challenges in all of hominid evolution. White's (i982, i989, I992) careful study of the range of "decorative" body artifacts-beads and pendants fash- ioned from ivory, antler, shell, tooth, and bone- characteristic of the early Aurignacian in southwestern Europe is fully explicable in action-constitutive terms. Warranting is the action process and serious invocative, abstract rule-governed expression is the logic that con- stitutes the Intentionality and rational sensibility un- derwriting this transition. These "decorative" items were fully iconic warrants.17 Only a symboling human- ity could have generated such iconic warrants. There- fore, I consider White's work as empirically confirming the claim that the transition is the outcome and me- dium of the emergence of effortless reflexivity and its concomitant symboling. The Aurignacian solution to constituting and legitimating ongoing everyday life and its practices-using "decorative" artifacts as coupon and token warrants of action-may be particular to Europe (Clark and Lindly i989), but regionalization of forms of material symboling is characteristic of rule-governed processes. In summary, theoretical grounds have been estab- lished for the claim that all the behaviour of a symboling population, even the most utilitarian, is rule-governed. The segregative view of mind that brackets off symbol- ing behaviour from end-goal behaviour and requires a separate exercise of intention to combine the two cre- ates a methodological impasse. The emergent model of the mind, the notion of effortless reflexivity, and the action-constitutive theory dissolve this impasse and open the way for using the patterning and variation in I 5. I think that the action-constitutive view would fully conform to Alexander's (i989:469) claim that "the only plausible way to account for the striking departure of humans from their predeces- sors and all other species with respect to mental and social attri- butes is to assume that humans uniquely became their own hostile force of nature." This insight accords with the role that material things have for symboling humans in constituting their material practices. Only effortlessly reflexive humans could generate war spears and hunting spears, specialized end-product types having the same end-goal capacity and thereby producing two different material practices. One spear would warrant its users' killing but not eating other humans-those that have different war spears, constituting other groups as hostile "natural forces," enemies to be overcome; the other spear would warrant the killing of (specific) animal species, constituting them as sources of food given by a benevolent nature. i6. See Bhaskar (I979) for a characterization of social traditions as the "intangible" material causes of intentional action. In per- forming our activities we largely unintentionally reproduce/trans- form these traditions. In the same way, the Mousterian traditions would be the intangible material conditions, the "knowledgeable raw materials," that human populations with emerging effortless reflexivity would draw upon, transforming the routines into rules and fixating on different possibilities for use, thereby generating specific end-product tools. This also gives considerable support to Harrold's (i989) more specific hypotheses about the emergence of the Chatelperronian out of the pre-existing Mousterian as having been stimulated by Aurignacian acculturation (and possible gene flow). I7. This position contrasts with that of Duff, Clark, and Chadder- don (i992), who make an explicit referential claim that decorative elements cannot be used to demonstrate symboling because they do not indicate the exercise of abstract thought and self-reference: "Whatever these objects are . . ., they are non-representational in nature. Some of them, at least, are taken to be objects of personal adornment, elements of necklaces or bracelets (such as perforated teeth).... Adornment in and of itself, however, does not indicate symbolic expression, since there is no necessary link between adornment and an abstract referent. These objects would be con- sidered evidence of symbolic behaviour only if it could be shown that decoration was intended to signal such identity (p. 224, em- phasis added).</page><page sequence="13">BYERS Symboling and the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic Transition I 38I the empirical data to ground social and cultural struc- tural models of fully symboling humans-using not only the utilitarian artifactual material of the Upper Palaeolithic but also the more explicitly expressive iconic materials, from body ornamentation to the great cave depictions. Comments ROBERT G. BEDNARIK International Federation of Rock Art Organizations, P.O. Box 2I6, Caulfield South, Victoria 3I62, Australia. 4 Iv 94 Byers's paper is about "strengthening and vindicating" previous confirmationist interpretations of certain data. No attempt is made to render its propositions refutable, no evidence is offered or discussed, and the archaeologi- cal framework referred to remains obscure. Some refer- ence is made to the perceived transition between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic of southwestern Europe and its asserted significance to the question of early symbolic-behaviour traces. That "transition" is about as relevant to the subject at hand as the Australian transi- tion from the "Stone Age" to the "Steel Age" is to the question of metallurgical beginnings: "symbolic behav- iour" originated in southwestern Europe no more than metallurgy did in Australia. White's (I989:385; cf. I992, I993) belief, cited by By- ers, that "the Aurignacian body ornamentation explodes onto the scene" and "remains one of the greatest explan- atory challenges in all of hominid evolution" is a tapho- nomically illiterate confirmationist construct the expla- nation of which presents no great challenge (Bednarik I994a). Not only is there ample evidence of probable body ornamentation from the Middle Palaeolithic (in- cluding many small drilled objects, presumably beads or pendants) but most forms of body ornamentation are unlikely to be detected by archaeology (e.g., tattoos, body painting, cicatrices, infibulations, deformations, coiffures, most forms of decorative objects). We know that haematite and ochreous minerals were widely used in the Acheulian of three continents and occur as manu- ports reportedly up to goo,ooo years ago (Bednarik I994b); we have no evidence that they were not used for body painting or for any other "symbolic" behaviour involving the use of pigment. Petroglyphs were pro- duced in the Acheulian of at least one region (Bednarik I993), and much more recent rock art elsewhere has been direct-dated to over 45,000 years B.P. Middle Palaeolithic people crossed the open sea to reach the continent of Sahul more than 6o,ooo years ago. Even Noble and Davidson (I993) accept that these seafarers possessed symbolic capacities at least 30,000 years be- fore the disappearance of the French Neanderthals. Where, then, is this much-discussed transition located in time? And how is it supposed to relate to the advent of symboling or to the appearance of modern humans? The "shift from archaic to fully modern human anat- omy" did not coincide with Byers's transition in lithic typology; essentially modern humans existed perhaps 70,000 years before the demise of the French Neander- thals. The terms "Middle" and "Upper" Palaeolithic are themselves artifacts of archaeologists, as is the per- ceived transition. In most parts of the world there is no "abrupt" transition. The Howiesons Poort phase, with its geometric microliths and engraved ostrich eggshells, is hardly a typical Middle Palaeolithic assemblage, being over twice the age of Byers's transition, while essentially Middle Palaeolithic typologies continued into modern times in some parts of the world. Most known Palaeo- lithic beads (over I2,300) are from just three burials of the Streletsian (at Sungir), an industry of Middle Palaeo- lithic origin. Even in France, the evidence of ochre use is much more common in the Chatelperronian of the Neanderthals than in the contemporary Aurignacian (Harrold I989: table 33.8). Conversely, there is no evi- dence that all Middle Palaeolithic traditions are attribut- able to Neanderthals, not even in Europe. The conceptual dichotomies Byers creates on the basis of his archaeological bias (e.g., with his effortless vs. ef- fortful reflexivity) serve better to differentiate his "non- utilitarian forms of material expression that are erratic in patterning" from those attributable to his "symboling human populations." If these two reflexivities were mu- tually exclusive, which he insists they were, how does he propose to explain the advent of "effortlessly reflex- ive humans"? Byers is certainly on the right track when he postu- lates that meaning is not an inherent property of things but imposed on them by mental processes. Unfortu- nately, precisely the same applies to the "meanings" ar- chaeologists impose on their "data." Even if they are as eloquently articulated as Byers's social behaviourist contemplations they remain "fiction" (Bahn 1990) until we have learned to temper archaeological interpretation with taphonomic logic (Bednarik I994a). The "demon- stration" of patterning in the "archaeological record" that Byers advocates is not a recipe for such rigour in archaeological interpretation. His assumption that style is recognizable by the archaeologist speaks for itself (see Conkey and Hastorf I990, Lorblanchet and Bahn I993), and his definition of humans as "symboling animals" implies that he assumes all other species to be bereft of any symboling abilities. Before delving further into the role of "Aurignacian" beads as the first "fully iconic warrants," I think that Byers needs to reflect on how various symbolic capacities might relate to human ethology and evolution. A blanket definition of symbol- ing is of no avail here, because different expressions of such behaviour refer to different cognitive functions. Therefore this cannot be some human capacity that sud- denly appeared with the French Aurignacian-nor does the available archaeological or neurological record sup- port such a naive dichotomy (Bradshaw and Rogers 1993).</page><page sequence="14">382 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 35, Number 4, August-October I994 G. A. CLARK Department of Anthropology, Arizona State University, Tempe, Ariz. 852 87-2402, U.S.A. 5 IV 94 If I understand him correctly, Byers is arguing that ef- fortless reflexivity (abstraction) manifest as rule- governed behaviour marks the appearance of human symbolism and that it shows up for the first time archae- ologically in Aurignacian beads, stone tools, and bone/ antler artifacts. The implication is that the early Upper Paleolithic is characterized by rule-governed style, whereas the Middle Paleolithic is not. Although the ap- proach is not one with which I am familiar, I will con- cede for the sake of argument that it is logically coherent (although Byers's contention that effortless reflexivity implies the existence of virtual properties is certainly arguable). The main question has to do with empirical sufficiency-can we detect the appearance of rule- governed behaviour prior to the late Upper Paleolithic when everyone acknowledges that it was present? The answer depends entirely upon how pattern is perceived in Paleolithic material culture and how meaning is as- signed to pattern by archaeologists interested in the em- pirical referents of symbolic behaviour. Empirical support for Byers's argument rests on the notion, often associated with Paul Mellars (e.g., i989a), that Middle Paleolithic stone tools do not exhibit "im- posed form" and "morphological standardization" whereas Upper Paleolithic stone tools do. It is an old argument, one grounded in the strict empiricism domi- nant in the research traditions of Old World Paleolithic archaeology (Clark and Lindly I989, i99i; Clark I989, I993). It treats pattern in retouched stone tools as if it were objectively real and intrinsically meaningful and uses pattern to identify the boundaries and peregrina- tions of hypothetical identity-conscious social units analogous to those known from history (e.g., Aurigna- cians, Solutreans). This is naive. The typological filter determines our perceptions of pattern, and, since the Middle and Upper Paleolithic typologies are different, perceptions of marked differences on either side of the transition are inevitable. The notions of "imposed form" and "morphological standardization" are typological il- lusions. Exactly the same kinds of arguments about equifinality of form that Dibble (e.g., i987) has made so successfully in regard to Middle Paleolithic artifacts can be and have been made about Upper and Epipaleolithic artifacts (e.g., Neeley and Barton I 994, Barton, Olszewski, and Coinman I994). Byers mentions the beads only in invoking them (con- tra Duff, Clark, and Chadderdon I992) as evidence of abstract thought. But, as Marshack (e.g., I988, i989) has repeatedly demonstrated, "beads" go back a long way in the Middle Paleolithic, implying continuity in "ef- fortless reflexivity" if in fact they are taken to demon- strate symbolic behaviour. While their symbolic content is arguable, the real issue here is why they show up in quantity when and where they do. Along with Gamble (i982, I99I), Mithen (i99i), and a number of other workers, I think that the beads (and "art" in general) can best be explained from an information-exchange perspec- tive which holds that the manifestation of symbolic be- haviour is historically and situationally contextualized and that it fulfilled an adaptive function for those groups that engaged in it. That function was the transmittal of information about group affiliation, individual states, ownership, ecological knowledge, economy, and the so- cial context of production and use-in short, aspects of status. None of this has anything to do with emergent "modern" capacities, however defined (see Clark, Bar- ton, and Cohen I994, Barton, Clark, and Cohen I994 for expanded discussion of this approach). Upper Paleolithic art is a European phenomenon. From an adaptationist point of view, the challenge is to identify the conditions (almost certainly demographic) that would have selected for an increasing symbolic component to human behaviour at particular places and times and that-in the present case-would have made symbolism adaptively advantageous to humans in the increasingly crowded social environment of western Eu- rope. There is a lot of evidence (mainly from primate ethology) to suggest that the higher primates in general and hominids in particular have a genetic predisposition to incorporate increasing amounts of learning into the behavioural repertoire. Symbolism is an important kind of learned behaviour, but it did not just "happen" as those who equate its appearance with the Aurignacian or with "moderns" would have us believe. Symbolic be- haviour clearly had adaptive significance-it increased the inclusive fitness of those who engaged in it over the evolutionary long term-but it probably developed in contexts distinct from those in which it is manifest to- day. This means that we will only be able to detect it archaeologically long after it had become a significant part of the human behavioural repertoire. SOPHIE A. DE BEAUNE URA 275 du CNRS, 44 rue de 1'Amiral Mouchez, F-75OI4 Paris, France. 27 Iv 94 According to Byers, the transition that we observe be- tween the Middle Paleolithic and the Upper Paleolithic coincides with a radical change in behavior which mani- fests itself particularly in the emergence of symbolism. It is a commonplace to say that the first evidence of a certain symbolic activity appeared at the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, in particular with the first artistic manifestations-elements of ornamentation. If Byers stopped there we would say that he was flogging a dead horse, but he considers this change in behavior from an original angle, and not a very archaeological one at that. His reasoning, although quite interesting, seems to me to be very speculative and lacking a real link with the archaeological record itself. Byers discerns two types of behavior. The first, "end- goal behavior," is strictly "materialistic" and aims at satisfying immediate needs while taking into account environmental conditions. The material cultures of two populations of hominids possessing this type of behavior</page><page sequence="15">BYERS Symboling and the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic Transition 1 383 and living in equivalent conditions should not, then, be distinguishable. The second type of behavior also de- pends on environmental conditions but is in addition "rule-governed." It is this type of behavior that would supposedly appear at the beginning of the Upper Paleo- lithic and that presupposes symbolism. The proposition is not new. Leroi-Gourhan, of whose work Byers seems unaware, distinguished between the most common operative practices, executed "in a cre- puscular state of consciousness" close to the state in which animal operations take place, and "operative chains" requiring the intervention of choice. "This choice can only be made if a lucid consciousness, closely tied to language, intervenes. Freedom of behavior is, in effect, realizable only at the level of symbols" (i965:20, my translation).' The question is whether this emer- gence of consciousness and of symbolism indeed dates from the period of transition between the Middle and the Upper Paleolithic. Byers claims to show that all the activities of a popu- lation possessing symbolism are governed by rules and that their entire material culture has a style dictated by rules ("all the activities of a symboling population are rule-governed and all their material culture has rule- governed style"). This change of behavior would mani- fest itself archaeologically by a diversification of the lithic tool sets that one could not explain by the simple accommodation to function and to environmental con- ditions. The matter is not, however, so simple. The pos- sible causes of varying responses to a single technical demand are the constraints of the material used, the technical levels of manufacture attained, the personal skill of the artisan, distinct needs, and, finally, the aes- thetic demands of the ethnic group. The variants of the same tool are in fact "functional approximations" tend- ing "towards the goal of coincidence with the ideal func- tion" but undergoing the "contradictory demands of me- chanical satisfaction and of the imprinting of a group's interior milieu" (Leroi-Gourhan i965:i28-30, my trans- lation).2 Only an in-depth knowledge of the techniques of production and utilization of Paleolithic tool sets, supported by experimental reconstructions, can allow one to say whether there indeed exist variations specific to the group, independent of material conditions. The study of the different modes of lighting in the Upper Paleolithic has, for example, shown that the different types of lamps corresponded to different needs and not to different cultural traditions (de Beaune I987, de Beaune and White I993). It seems to me, therefore, a bit hasty to attribute the existence of different technical choices to the emergence of symbolism. If we follow the reasoning of Byers, we should then observe a split between, on the one hand, "purely tech- nical" tools determined solely by the "natural objec- tive environmental constraints" and the "manipulative skills of the producer/user" and, on the other hand, tools "overdetermined by the effect of rules." The former would be used by the "materialistic" populations of the Middle Paleolithic, the latter by the "symboling" popu- lations of the Upper Paleolithic. Now, we know that as early as the Mousterian flint knappers made certain technical choices. For example, the recent work of Eric Boeda on the different techniques of Mousterian debi- tage-Levallois, discoid, trifacial-reveals different con- cepts of debitage following precise technical rules (i99i, I993). Moreover, we find in the industries of the Upper Paleolithic tools that can be considered as belonging to both categories. Examples of the first category are "basic tools" common to the majority of Paleolithic popula- tions, several of which (e.g., anvils and hammers) appear even before the Upper Paleolithic; as tools of the second- ary category we can point to those having the same use but presenting morphological variations which we can impute to the effect of cultural constraints (among oth- ers, for example, grinders of very different forms and raw materials that were used on the same materials). Byers postulates a priori that the constraints observed have a social dimension. It is in fact possible that some of these constants were imposed by technical con- straints of which we are unaware, since, in many cases, the actual function of the tools is unknown. He goes on to wonder about the unintentional or unconscious character of these constants: is it a question of inten- tional social traditions conveyed by rules or, on the con- trary, of simple routine gestures which perpetuate them- selves unconsciously? It seems to me quite premature to ask this kind of question when the very nature of these constants is not yet defined with precision. We should keep in mind that what appears as a constant- for example, the same flint arrowhead found in different sites-may have been only one element of very different objects. The choice and the very definition of constants are therefore arbitrary and are the product of the prehis- torian, not of the prehistoric. The same holds for the notion of style, which for Byers establishes the identity of the group. If the definition is judicious, it is difficult to apply it to the data that we have for the Paleolithic, since there, too, we do not know what is attributable to technical contingencies, personal choice, the available materials, and, finally, social, tribal, or familial tradi- tions. Byers maintains that Middle Paleolithic humans did not possess "effortless reflexivity" and therefore had no consciousness of self or of others. They could not estab- lish social traditions, and under no cirumstances did they have sufficient capacity for abstraction for "moral ideals." If we admit, following Boeda, that the producers of the Mousterian were capable of making technical choices, and if we remember that they sometimes in- terred their dead, then only with difficulty can we imag- ine them without consciousness of self and others. i.

It is a question, in fact, of a period of transition, of progressive change especially noticeable with regard to techniques. Although the be- ginning of the Upper Paleolithic is indeed characterized by the appearance of certain technical and cultural inno- vations, we must not forget that some of these innova- tions are rooted in the Middle Paleolithic, where they already exist in an embryonic state (de Beaune I993). We can imagine that the same was true of notions of self-consciousness and moral ideals. The real break is probably situated much earlier, perhaps at the emer- gence of articulated language, somewhere in the course of the evolution of Homo erectus and in the transition towards the more evolved pre-Neandertal forms in Eu- rope and Pre-sapiens in eastern Africa. I share Coppens's (i992) view on this matter, according to which at one moment in our history a seesaw effect occurred when cultural evolution accelerated and overtook biological evolution, which was gradually slowing down. He situ- ates this moment at the beginning of the Middle Paleo- lithic, and in my opinion it could very well correspond to the moment of the emergence of language, reflection, and self-consciousness.3 ROM HARRE Department of Psychology, Georgetown University, 37th &amp; 0 Sts., Washington, D.C. 20057, U.S.A. I5 IV 94 It is remarkable how frequently and in what diverse con- texts the distinction between rule-following (new- paradigm) and causal (old-paradigm) explanations of some aspect of human conduct appears. In every case the distinction is implicated with the distinction between symbol-using, that is, rule-governed, and utilitarian or end-goal-directed activities. In social psychology the lines are drawn between those who hold that social in- teractions are mediated symbolically and so are norma- tively constrained and those who hold that they are me- diated causally and so constrained by whatever causal mechanisms are in place. The most sophisticated form of causal explanation draws on hierarchies of means/end pairs working something like a control system. Concep- tions of the relation of the person whose conduct we are trying to explain to the sources of that conduct are correspondingly different. In accordance with the new paradigm a person is an intentional agent, while the old- paradigm picture implicitly presents an actor as a mere spectator of the results of the working of diaphanous "mental mechanisms." It is fascinating to see how Byers exports the distinctions of new- and old-paradigm psy- chology to the Palaeolithic via the concept of style. The recent history of social and personality psychology shows how difficult it has been to persuade the main- stream to adopt rule citation as an explanatory mode for action patterns that are readily observed and indeed in which these very same mainstreamers themselves play their roles in everyday life. How much greater the diffi- culty of reconstructing the psychology of persons from a very distant past in rule-following terms by attending to ways of classifying a few stone tools! I take Byers's argument to turn on the thesis that if there are differences in the forms to be discemed in a range of artifacts created for the same practical purpose, those differences must be intended and have expressive implications. To intend an expressive difference re- quires a capacity to follow rules rather than to be the vehicle for the running of a means/end "program." There are two concepts buried in this summary which are worth further discussion. A closer look at the impli- cations of their implicit use in Byers's argument will suggest that there are yet more inferences to be made about the psychology of our Mousterian and Aurigna- cian forebears. The psychology based on rule-following explanations also makes use of a general distinction between practical and expressive social "orders," systems of normative concepts and rules. The practical order concerns the production of the material necessities of life, while the expressive order concerns the production of social hierarchy, with its status and role differences. In the expressive order worth is constituted. Because it is ma- terially abstract, it can only be expressed symbolically. A symbolizing culture is equipped to create the marks of social distinction. I am aware that Byers uses the term "expressive" for a related but different matter. It is a central part of Witt- genstein's view of the relation between thought and ac- tion that in important cases thought is not represented in action but expressed in it-or, to put it epigrammati- cally, action is part of what it is to be entertaining that thought, suffering that pain, and so on. Thus our Auri- gnacian stone flaker is not representing his thought in the artifact but expressing it. The artifact was thereby a part of the thought, and still is, and thus we have direct access to the mentation of folk whose culture has been gone for millennia. If this is the import of Byers's paper it strikes me as a profound insight, but it needs the au- thority of Wittgenstein to sustain it. The same thesis of direct access could also be defended, I believe, for expressive presentation of value, though the inference would be hazardous whereas the recognition of style is robust. A second implication of Byers's appropriating the rule-following explanatory mode is that with it he must be importing the distinction between what happens and what ought to happen. This distinction is at the heart of Wittgenstein's account of rule following. A rule does not cause the future to be so-and-so; rather, it fixes what was the correct thing to happen. A man hunkering down on the edge of a quarry and thinking in the rule- following mode is thereby engaged not just in getting any old edged tool-one that will just do-but in creat- ing one that is "correct" according to some standard 3. Translated by Henri Rozier.</page><page sequence="17">BYERS Symboling and the Middle--Upper Palaeolithic Transition 1 385 which I take it seems to emerge from a comparative study of the objects. This seems to be logically con- nected with the idea of "style." There remains one matter on which I believe Byers's account of rule following, symboling, and expressive ac- tivity is inadequate. He accepts Searle's treatment of the psychology of speech acts without reservation or quali- fication, that is, he takes it for granted that speaker in- tention constitutes an utterance as a speech act (Muhl- hausler and Harr6 i990). Austin himself insisted that a speech act existed only if the felicity conditions were met, in particular that there was an appropriate display of "uptake." In short, a speech action becomes a speech act only when it is confirmed as such by the interlocu- tor. You have not insulted me, whatever you intended, if I do not understand the sardonic implications of your sly remark. This point is tremendously important for Byers's thesis as I have understood it. As an expressive act in lithic form, an artifact is like a speech action; the intention of the maker (utterer) is present in it. But it becomes something which is analogous to a speech act, in which the intention of the maker is realized, only in the uptake of the other. That other is not an Aurignacian client of our tool maker but Byers and Dibble and White sorting out the flints. The rule-following community is therefore transtemporal. IAN HODDER Department of Archaeology, Cambridge University, Cambridge CB2 3RF, U.K. 7 IV 94 The attempt by Byers in this and other papers to develop an action-theory approach to material culture is wel- come, as is his application here of these ideas to the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic transition. He is surely right in arguing that much (although I would not say all) ma- terial culture meaning is constitutive and implicative rather than referential. He is right to focus on the prag- matic and active way in which material meanings de- velop and to argue that symboling behaviour is often emergent. It therefore seems curious that he has reached the conclusions described here. If symboling is socially constitutive and emergent in the practical contexts of daily life, and if we are to eschew any segregation of utilitarian (functional) and expressive (symbolic/stylis- tic) behaviour, would we not expect symboling to emerge gradually in specific arenas of action? Would we not expect reflexivity and abstract thought to emerge pragmatically as social structures become gradually more complex? Byers has perhaps come to the view that symboling appears suddenly at the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic tran- sition because of his reification of the nature of rules. Giddens too can be criticised for an incomplete discus- sion of the distinction between repeated practice and rule, and Byers does not clarify the contrast. He does make a distinction between (discursive) rules and (non- discursive, practical) conventions in that only the for- mer are described as having moral force or constitutive standards. Only the rules involve effortless reflexivity. But if practices are repeated so that they become passed on as conventions, are these conventions not constitu- tive standards or rules? Is not practical consciousness equally rule-bound, even if those rules are not discur- sively available? Practices are repeated because at some level and to someone they work. And for humans and all social be- ings this "working" involves a seamless web of utilitar- ian and social variables. Any material behavior, whether hunting, grooming, cleaning a stick to obtain ants, or making a stone tool, is embedded in a practical world which has social as well as utilitarian components. It is abundantly clear now, from a wide range of work, that non-human primates live in a complex social world in which there are rules of social organisation. Material actions in this world have social implications. For exam- ple, grooming involves deference, and access to the kill involves dominance. These practices (such as grooming and access to food) must themselves be involved in the constitution of social rules. It is quite wrong, therefore, to suppose that variation in side-scrapers, the result of an end-goal technology, does not display the exercise of rules. First, there clearly are rules in the way that the flakes are systematically reduced during use. Second, resharpening and remodifi- cation and discard of tools occur in a social context. Degrees of resharpening could well have had-one might even say must have had-social meaning. For ex- ample, side-scrapers close to discard may have had more or less or different value from side-scrapers at the begin- ning of their use life. Similarly, as their continuity and stability of form indicate, Lower and Middle Palaeolithic handaxes clearly were made using rules. Even if those who made them did not have fully modern thought, they undoubtedly lived in a social world in which issues such as status, display, dominance, and perhaps even owner- ship were integrated parts of daily life. Not everyone (perhaps not the very young) could make or use a hand- axe. The handaxe rules (or conventions) which created a continuity of form may have been largely end-goal- directed, but part of that end-goal would have been so- cial. It would seem likely that the handaxes were in- volved in more than the utilitarian realm-they were symbolic not only because rule-bound but also because implicated in the construction of society. It cannot be argued that the onset of symboling will be identifiable in the appearance of a superfluity of form beyond utilitarian end-goal-directed requirements of hu- man organic life. As much recent work on technology has demonstrated, even the most technical and mun- dane of acts implicates social aspects of life. In the ani- mal world the obtaining of and access to food and mates involve social rules of dominance; amongst non-human primates many aspects of mundane life involve the in- terplay between young and old, male and female, domi- nant and subordinate, and even the simplest tool manu- facture by pre-modern humans must have had social dimensions as skills were passed on from generation to generation, as the old and infirm became less adept at</page><page sequence="18">386 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 35, Number 4, August-October 1994 the techniques involved, or as access to sources of stone or hammer-stones became dependent on relations be- tween individuals or groups. It has been recognised since at least Pitt-Rivers in the late i9th century that practical consciousness is respon- sible for a large part of material culture patterning but that such patterning is rule-bound in some way. These rules are understood within practice and may not be dis- cursively available. The rules may "drift" through time as they are passed on, but the end result is a homogene- ity of patterning. The absence of erratic patterning in material styles cannot be taken as evidence for the im- position of reflexively conscious behaviour. Stylistic continuities often result from the repetition of practices that "work" at a non-discursive level. The behaviour of anatomically pre-modern humans was repetitive (and in that sense rule-bound), and it in- volved the social world beyond the material (and was in that sense symbolic). Certainly the degree of symboling and the definition and elaboration of rules dramatically increase at the Upper Palaeolithic transition as Mellars indicates, but this could be the result of an increase in social complexity at this time rather than the product of the sudden appearance of the ability to think reflexively. Indeed, it could be argued at an extreme that in the mod- ern and post-modern worlds of today self-reflexivity re- mains emergent. It would seem likely that reflexive self- consciousness emerged gradually in the Palaeolithic as a by-product of the manipulation of social symbols in an increasingly complex social world. Indeed, Byers's use of the terms "effortful" and "effortless" reflexivity hints at this underlying continuity. It would be possible to suggest, then, that the transition to the Upper Palaeo- lithic did indeed see an increase in reflexivity and sym- boling, but it would seem difficult to support the claim that reflexivity began at this point, still less that sym- boling began at this or any other point. Byers gives little consideration to the pragmatic social contexts within which symboling and reflexivity devel- oped. What aspects of life did they make "work" better? Much early symboling (well before the Upper Palaeo- lithic) may have developed as an extension of grooming, deference, and display behaviour, and the routinisation of these practices (to form apparent "rules") is under- standable in terms of the socialisation process. Greater social complexity was dependent on longer socialisa- tion, which allowed the imposition of routine "ways of doing things." Issues of authority and dominance would thus have increased, and symbolic "warranting" would have gained in importance. As symboling was increas- ingly used to "warrant" social behaviour, reflexivity may have been heightened in the context of the elabora- tion of social roles and in the objectification of those roles in material symbols. The justification and legiti- mation of domination increasingly would have involved the manipulation of symbols and thus reflexive probing of the relationship between subject and symbol. The ''warranting" could be questioned; status could become "just symbolic." Certainly social cunning and deceit are observed in non-human primates, but the constitution and objectification of society through material symbols encourages further reflection on the arbitrariness of power. Perhaps reflexivity follows from and undermines rather than underpins the human dependence on sym- bols. Certainly both symboling and reflexivity should be studied (perhaps decoupled) as emergent and active components within specific areas of social life. Byers has started us on the path, but there is a long way to go in understanding which early actions material culture constituted. ALEXANDER MARSHACK Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. 0213 8, U.S.A. 22 IV 94 Byers presents two arguments: one a philosophical- theoretical discussion of symboling and "non-symbol- ing," the other a discussion of artifact production by presumed symboling and "non-symboling" humans of the "Middle-Upper Paleolithic transition." He consid- ers the first argument to be validated by evidence of the second. I therefore address the second. It is apparent from his citations that he has no firsthand analytical knowledge of the traditions or materials in discussion. In addition, his generic argument is skewed by being Eurocentric and ethnocentric. Byers asserts, for instance, that "White's careful study of the range of 'decorative' body artifacts" (i.e., the beads of the Aurignacian) provides evidentiary support for his theoretical model. White's argument is that Aurignacian beads somehow represent a beginning of human self- awareness, social complexity, etc. I have indicated that in the European Upper Paleolithic personal decorations of perishable materials, including twined thongs, were perhaps as common as or more common than beads (Marshack iggia, b). These perishable materials were used to make hip belts, body belts, aprons, bracelets, armbands, headbands, anklets and collars, caps, stylized garments, etc. They are depicted on figurines and human representations, in contrast to beads, which are rarely if ever depicted. There is also a suggestion of body painting and the ritual wearing of perishable animal skins and parts as early as the Aurignacian. I have also docu- mented a use of feathers with painted motifs in the Up- per Paleolithic (Marshack I98I). This evidence of perishable symboling is important because there is no archeological evidence that anatomi- cally modern humans of Upper Paleolithic times in Af- rica, the Levant, Asia, or Australia produced a relevant bone-bead industry,' though we must presume that they i. Racemization dating indicates that ostrich eggshell beads were produced in Africa ca. 40,000-50,000 B.P. (Hare et al. I993, Pa- leoanthropologists i992). However, the sparsity of such evidence and the lack of comparable evidence in other areas where anatomi- cally modern humans lived indicates the fragility and unreliability of the early archeological record for attempts to formulate a chro-</page><page sequence="19">BYERS Symboling and the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic Transition | 387 had language, ritual, personal decoration, and social complexity. There is inferential evidence suggesting that personal decorations of perishable materials may also have been used in the Middle Paleolithic. Anatomi- cally modern humans inhabited the Levant from ca. IOO,000 B.P. on. For thousands of years Neanderthals in- habited the same territory. The two groups had Middle Paleolithic technologies and similar subsistence strate- gies; both hafted tools, worked skins and wood, and used ochre. Yet neither has left evidence for personal decora- tion. Should we assume that anatomically modern hu- mans in the Levant wore personal decorations of perish- able materials but their contemporary neighbors the Neanderthals did not? Or were both groups in the Le- vant "non-symboling humans"? There is microwear evi- dence that Neanderthals in the Middle Paleolithic of Eu- rope also hafted tools, worked skins and wood, and used ochre (Anderson-Gerfaud 1990, Beyries I987). A hafted tool requires mastic and thongs. If ochre was used, wood and skin were worked, and thongs were made in the Middle Paleolithic of both Europe and the Levant, why should we assume that personal decoration and self- awareness began with the bone beads of the Aurigna- cian? Simply because they are there? The late Neanderthals of Europe manufactured beads of animal bones and fossils at Arcy-sur-Cure during the Chatelperronian period (Leroi-Gourhan I963, Leroi- Gourhan and Leroi-Gourhan I965, Marshack i989b). Derived from the European Middle Paleolithic, the Cha- telperronian was in apparent contact with the newly ar- rived cultures of anatomically modern humans. What is significant is not the manufacture of beads but their production at times in a "style" that was not typically Aurignacian. Aurignacian beads were made by boring a hole while Chatelperronian beads were also made by incising a groove around the top (Leroi-Gourhan and Leroi-Gourhan I965 ). Tying rather than threading a bead derives easily from the Middle Paleolithic technology of hafting. The Neanderthals, therefore, could understand the concept, production, and use of a bead. Do we as- sume (a) that they had the capacity for personal decora- tion but did not use it in the Middle Paleolithic? (b) that they had the capacity but produced personal decorations in different materials or styles? or (c) that they were a "non-symboling" subspecies that lacked the capacity to invent personal decorations but was capable of imitating their use? I have for a decade argued that the evolved potentially variable human capacity is not the same as the regional, temporal, or contextual, cultural manifestation of that capacity (Marshack I985, I988, i989b). Ochre, for in- stance, was used in the Achueulian of Europe (Mar- shack i98i), in the Levant, and in the Middle Stone Age of Africa (Wreschner i980). It appears as striated ochre, ochre crayons, rubbing stones, and accumulations of ochre powder. At the Acheulian site of Terra Amata ochre crayons were carried from their source to a sea- sonal camp. Ochre was abundant in the Chatelperronian (Leroi-Gourhan I963, Harrold i989). These data do not evidence "style," structure, or form, but one must pre- sume that there was "style" and structure in their use at the proper time, for the proper purpose, in the proper context, and in the proper mode, whether for marking, for example, a face, an arm, a body, a corpse, a newborn infant, a male going hunting, a female about to deliver, or a youth undergoing initiation. The cultural use of ochre could not, almost by definition, have been haphaz- ard and random; it had to be "rule-governed," con- textually and "stylistically" meaningful, and probably regionally variable. From structured and contextual "rule-governed" use of ochre to the contextual use of manufactured personal decoration requires no great evo- lutionary or conceptual leap, merely a sequence of cul- tural and technological developments. I have recently confirmed the presence of exceedingly complex "rule-governed" symbolic engraving in the Le- vantine Middle Paleolithic (Marshack n.d.) from a level containing a tooth dated by electron spin resonance to ca. 54,000 B.P. This is some 2o,ooo years before the Cha- telperronian and the completion of the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic European "transition." This was the period in which Levantine Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans inhabited the same territory, used ochre, and practiced formal burial. Since there is no ar- chaeological evidence for bead manufacture, do we as- sume that both groups were "non-symboling" humans or had no self-awareness, or do we assume that the much discussed European Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic "tran- sition" has a limited regional and archeological rather than a generic evolutionary or "philosophical" validity? ELIZABETH PENTON MULLEN 6 Dorset Place, Durham, N.C. 27713, U.S.A. 22 IV 94 One of the most interesting aspects of Byers's concept of rule-governed behavior and effortless reflexivity in cognition is that it not only addresses the emergence of new tool forms and new standardizations but also may apply to artistic manifestations such as image making and body ornament. In the area of Upper Paleolithic im- agery studies, it is difficult to go about interpreting meaning without assuming that drawing, painting, and sculpture participated in a rich dialectical and holistic cultural context from the beginning-a context depen- dent on symboling capacities. The fact that image mak- ing arrived on the scene in such dramatic fashion, paral- leling the new lithic traditions, gives credence to his idea of a new intellectual force at work. One wonders what specific applications Byers would make in ex- nology or model of symbolic "origins." I have studied incised wood and bone from Border Cave, Africa, of approximately the same period. Such fortuitous evidence documents not the beginning of a symboling tradition but its relatively late manifestation on certain classes of material. My analysis of a carved "bone" plaque made by the Neanderthals from Tata, Hungary, in the Mousterian period at ca. IOO,000 B.P. presents the same problem.</page><page sequence="20">388 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 35, Number 4, August-October I994 plaining these image-making traditions in terms of ef- fortless reflexivity and patterning. The classic work of Leroi-Gourhan (I97Ia, I972a) in this area draws heavily on rule-based patterning and symboling. What is lacking in Byers's discourse is a clear explanation of what he means by symboling and what the relationships and dis- tinctions are between rule-based patterning and symbol- ing. We do see rules in human language and tool use, but defining characteristics for symboling elude us in the record of artifacts for the Middle-Upper Paleolithic transition. To my mind, why and how humans began to compre- hend "virtual properties" is fascinating to ponder, since this should be the basis of religious thought and behav- ior. But we have to ask ourselves, then, how instances of Neanderthal "signing" and (dare one suggest?) "sym- boling" such as at Regourdou and at Shanidar and La Ferrassie are not examples of effortless reflexivity. While I agree that symboling humans do not do so on a part-time basis, the creative capacities which allow such mental activities also permit escape from existing rule paradigms, making it impossible to classify all the material culture of a symboling people as rule-bound expression. The central problem with Byers's character- ization of the style-2 distinction lies in his assertion that these stone artifacts evidence rule patterns which rever- berate with constellations of cultural meaning, some- what like the example he cites of Wiessner's study of San projectile points. We in Upper Paleolithic studies must sooner or later admit that we can infer only so much about the Paleolithic mind by looking at tools. The important question may be what selective pres- sures allowed for such a development in cognitive abili- ties. Does this show support for a single-origin theory? Was language indeed the force which exercised a new brain structure and honed this effortless reflexivity and rule-based patterning? What kind of evolutionary con- text could produce such a change? Perhaps the leap was not so great after all-witness the innovative interpre- tive skills of the bonobo Kanzi under the supervision of Sue Savage-Rumbaugh at Emory University (and see Byers's n. I4). Concerning the idea that "symboling humans are 'fated' to transform their 'emergent' templates into stan- dards," one might see this process as the origin of typo- logical thinking and view it as a condition of the modern brain (structuralism) or, alternatively, as the intellectu- ally creative ability which makes possible escape from rule-bound categorizations, oppositions, and standard- izations, allowing us a new self-consciousness. Cer- tainly in our theories concerning the origins of art no- tions about creativity will have to take the forefront. Ultimately, we need to ask how the effortless reflexivity which provides the basis for symboling activities, per- ceptions of "virtual properties," and self-consciousness is categorically different from rule-based patterning. In his future endeavors, Byers might consider that a reading audience appreciates concrete examples when being introduced to difficult terminology. RICHARD J. PARMENTIER Department of Anthropology, Brandeis University, Waltham, Mass. 02254-9IIO, U.S.A. 22 III 94 I welcome this opportunity to respond to Byers's paper not because I have any expertise in palaeoanthropology or archaeology but because, as a semiotician concerned with the comparative study of material culture, I find many of the issues addressed critical for both prehistori- cal and historical disciplines. I must confess that I had difficulty following Byers's argument, even after multi- ple close readings and careful comparison with an earlier paper (Byers I99I) that makes many of the same points. My difficulty arises in part from my general lack of sym- pathy for talking about material objects as if they were Searle's constitutive speech acts-that is, the identifi- cation of the transformative potential of objects with the illocutionary force of utterances-and for conceptu- alizing meaning as residing in the "intentionality" of the users of objects and in part from my inability to translate all of Byers's innovative terminology into stan- dard semiotic usage. Space limitations preclude a detailed critique of these theoretical assumptions and terminological complexi- ties; instead I offer several brief comments about the state of the debate over symboling, style, and mate- rial objects currently engaging scholars such as Byers, Chase, Conkey, Sackett, White, Wiessner, and others. One image that comes to mind in reflecting on this de- bate is that of Palaeolithic hunters trying to accomplish tasks that exceed the precision of their lithic tool kit. Arguments about the "meaning" of materially mediated activity, about the most comprehensive definition of "style," or about the contrasting perspectives of users' versus analysts' "intentions" tend to come down to se- mantic quibbles because the participants are not op- erating with a delicate enough set of analytical concepts. And in cases where a more precise level of analysis is attempted, as in discussions of "arbitrariness," "indexi- cality," "isochrestic variation," and "constitutive rule," the discourse continues to be opaque because the discus- sants do not use these terms in the same senses. A symp- tom, I think, of this confusion is the proliferation of terminological oppositions created ad hoc for the sake of expressing a needed distinction, such as "material behavior" versus "material action," "style-i" versus "style-2," "end-goal-directed behavior" versus "rule- governed behavior," "effortless reflexivity" versus "ef- fortful reflexivity," "adjunctive mediation" versus "as- criptive mediation," and "action-constitutive meaning" versus ''referential meaning." This kind of disjunctive proliferation I take to be a clue that the underlying prin- ciples, axes, or regularities have yet to be uncovered. Perhaps even more troubling is the frequency of reifi- cation and essentialization of concepts that are more successfully viewed as relational or processual. Rather than speak about "the meaning" as residing in the inten- tionality of users or identifying the semiotic status of a certain kind of object as an "iconic warrant," I would</page><page sequence="21">BYERS Symboling and the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic Transition 1 389 suggest an approach that takes meaning to be a pattern of relations among signs, their objects, contexts, or refer- ents, and the interpreting cognitions or actions of people engaged in or by their operation in social life. Attempts to place certain objects in the baskets of "icon," "in- dex," and "symbol," similarly, miss the critical point that these Peircean terms are not types of signs but stages or moments in the hierarchical complexity of se- miotic functioning; a symbol necessarily embodies an index to specify the object being signified, and an index necessarily embodies an icon to indicate what informa- tion is being signified about that object (Parmentier I994). And arguments over the labeling of symboling phenomena as "representations," "warrants," or "con- stitutive" devices fail to separate semiotic organization from semiotic functioning, that is, a potentiality for meaningfulness from social activity occurring in real- time contexts for specific purposes entailing various consequences. Everything depends on our ability to de- scribe the processes of semiotic functioning, an area of data unfortunately almost always unavailable in the ar- chaeological record. Peirce's concepts of semiotic relations, cited wtih fre- quency in these debates, enable me to place most of the empirical observations about style in a convenient framework. The recent debate, however, does not realize the potential of this framework simply because of the obsession with only one of Peirce's divisions-icon, in- dex, symbol (that is, signs signifying their objects by resemblance, contiguity, or imposed convention). Pot- tery style rarely functions symbolically; rather, style is an indexical legisign embodying an iconic legisign, and a particular pot in that style is an indexical sinsign-a "replica," in fact, since it is generated from a template which it (trivially) indexes. To be sure, it is important to keep in mind that style frequently appears a matter of indexical signs, but the observation that stylized pot- tery can be employed by its users as marking group affil- iation or boundaries or to signal that the makers/users follow a pattern promulgated by a dominant regional center corresponds to Peirce's distinction between a "di- cent" indexical sinsign (a sign that is a particular thing functioning as an index being interpreted as functioning indexically) and a "rhematic" indexical sinsign (a sign that is a particular thing functioning as an index being interpreted as having some relevant qualitative fea- tures). A pot that depicts the deity associated with beer drinking could function, for its ritual users, as a rhe- matic symbol in that, while it represents the deity by a figural convention, there is no necessary assumption that the deity is made present in the act of drinking. On the other hand, a vessel made out of gold, a substance not just resembling the brightness of the sky god but partaking of that deity's being, functions, for worship- pers, as a dicent indexical sinsign embodying a rhematic iconic sinsign (the color being the ground of resem- blance). Pottery interpreted by an archaeologist using, for example, neutron-activation analysis or magnetic- intensity dating to establish absolute or relative chronol- ogy or spatial origination based on an analysis of the materiality of pot fragments is functioning as a dicent indexical legisign (a general pattern instanced by pots produced within contextual parameters interpreted as evidence for that locus), whereas a pottery style studied by an archaeologist as a sign of group identity or cultural influence functions as a rhematic indexical legisign. A sequence of pottery styles would function as a symbolic "argument," that is, a general regularity representing its object (which is itself a generality) by convention inter- preted as a convention, because the archaeologist is us- ing a diachronic pattern of pottery types to construct a representation of historical processes. The point of these examples is that the meaning of "style" can be specified only with reference to three in- terrelated questions: (i) What is the nature of the signi- fying material: a fragment, a decorative figure, a repre- sentation, a regional pattern, or a sequence of any of these? (2) What is the actual relationship between these various signifying forms and the surrounding cultural traditions, social boundaries, and (possible) embodied cosmological beings or powers? (3) How are these sign potentialities interpreted (not just by whom but for what purposes)? In some cases the producers' or users' inten- tion may even be the same as the archaeologists', al- though more usually these will diverge. There is no way to analyze the organization of signifying forms or the structure of meaningful codes fully without studying the functioning of signs in the contexts of their use-a principle that applies just as strictly to material objects as to linguistic signs. Communicating/expressing/de- marcating/embodying activity-that is, cultural semio- sis-can be seen as culturally mediated only on the con- dition that analysts construct a principled account of intentional goals, semiotic means, and surrounding con- textual features. For this reason, then, our understand- ing of "symboling" in prehistoric pottery after the Mid- dle-Upper Palaeolithic transition is, unhappily, less ade- quate than our grasp of earlier forms. And any attempt to describe this transition without taking into account the many layers of semiotic capacity, the multifunc- tional potentials of identical forms, and the critical role of interpretive stances is bound to be overly simplis- tic-a problem that, by the way, plagues the parallel debate over the contrasting linguistic abilities of apes and humans.

While we endorse much of what Byers has to say, we find it regrettable tha the attempt is only partly successful. In his substantive propositions he follows and expands a long-establishec distinction (e.g. Weber, Winch) between action and be haviour. Both of these can be end-goal-directed inten tions resulting in the production of material culture, bui only actions are rule-mediated-that is, symboling. In reminding us that all symboling activity is the product of a dialogue between self-consciousness (practical OI not) and knowledge of a system of rules and meanings, Byers is correct to stress that symboling is not a part- time or adjunct mechanism to be invoked only on spe- cial occasions. This brings us to the distinction between "symbol- ing" and "non-symboling" humans, considered as twc categories with equal status or claim for existence It seems to us that one of these-non-symboling-is clearly the negation of the other and furthermore tha no living example of it is available for empirical exami nation. A "human population performing only material behaviours" is difficult to conceive of, since we belonE to and have knowledge only of populations performinE "material actions." In other words, non-symboling hu- mans performing "material behaviour" are considered a category whether they exist or not. These same logical grounds apparently lead to the distinction betweer style-i and style-2 assemblages, the former merely the possible result of a behaviour performed by a speculative entity. These general comments notwithstanding, for Byers's distinction to be applicable to archaeological materials (in this case, the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic transition) it is necessary to find assemblages or material remains that can be said to be not rule-governed, that is, not showing any "superfluity of patterns that cannot be ana- lytically reduced to the utilitarian end-goal-directed requirements of organic human life." In our opinion, Middle Palaeolithic assemblages do not conform to this "non-symboling" expectation. Following Dibble, Byers argues that utilitarian items such as racloirs do not display the exercise of rules and that their form can be explained by end-goal-directed intentionality alone. It is certainly the case that many Middle Palaeolithic tools (just like Upper Palaeolithic ones) have been resharpened in the course of their use. However, very few scholars would agree that resharpen- ing alone is sufficient to explain the morphological and technological range of Mousterian tools-especially if we consider Quina scrapers or Mousterian handaxes. Moreover, the fact that these types seem to occur in non-random ways in otherwise broadly contemporane- ous archaeological layers does not favour the expecta- tion of indistinguishable assemblages (style i) produced by "non-symboling" humans. Much more important, eventual rules governing ma- terial actions will manifest themselves not simply ir the finished tool form (resharpened or not) but rather ir the whole process by which stone raw material is se- lected, transported, knapped, and used. In this respect, recent advances in the field of lithic technology (Boeda, Geneste, and Meignen I990, Pelegrin I990; see also Si- gaut i99i) make it clear on both experimental and ar- chaeological grounds that, far from being a simple mat- ter of perceiving "affordances" or exploiting pre-existing "dispositional properties" in the stone, the production of certain tools or blanks such as the Levallois requires highly elaborated procedures, skills, and know-how in which the structured and rule-govemed management of the core enables the production of a series of flakes of controlled shape and outline. As with tools, the Leval- lois is not ubiquitous throughout Mousterian assem- blages, and its occurrence cannot be simply related to raw-material availability or alleged "technological con- straints. " Following Byers, the morphologically modern humans who produced "typical" Mousterian assemblages in the Near East would have to be considered "non-symbol- ing," and assemblages such as the Chatelperronian, Uluzzian, and Szeletian, in all probability produced by later Neanderthals, show a level of standardisation which in Upper Palaeolithic assemblages would evi- dently be taken to indicate "symboling." More gener- ally, there is no doubt that a fuller assessment of sym- boling across the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic transition would have to take account of Neanderthal burials as well as various claims of cannibalism, the collection of minerals and fossils, the use of ochre, engravings or carv- ings on certain objects, and Chatelperronian beads. We are not convinced that Byers has "vindicated the claim that the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic transition manifests the earliest emergence and expression of hu- man symboling." When archaeological assemblages are studied in their totality and in technological terms and when other behavioural and palaeontological aspects are taken into account, it becomes clear that the distinc- tion between "symboling" and "non-symboling" proves rather more difficult to establish. Byers has, however, provided, from his standpoint in the social sciences, a pertinent critique of pervasive archaeological opinions. What is more, his appreciation of the socially generated and mediated nature of rules by which material actions are conducted, however routine or utilitarian, is cer- tainly welcome-and, we argue, equally applicable in principle to the Middle Palaeolithic. MICHAEL SHANKS Department of Archaeology, University of Wales, Lampeter, Dyfed SA48 7ED, Wales, U.K. 2I Iv 94 Byers's title and expressed subject concern the genera- tion and use of symbols in society, but his real topic is a sudden emergence of social order and the character of this order; indeed, he is writing of the origins of society and morality. This is, of course, a traditional interest of political philosophy, but while we here share a subject with Aristotle, Hobbes, Rousseau, and others Byers</page><page sequence="23">BYERS Symboling and the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic Transition | 39I claims support for his argument from the empirical sci- ence of archaeological change. I welcome this sophisti- cated discussion of some key concepts of social theory- notably action, rule, symbol, and meaning-directly tied to archaeological questions of human origins. As serious archaeologists, how can we omit careful scrutiny of con- ceptual apparatuses so central to our interests? This pa- per is a notable contribution to such scrutiny. I do, however, feel that in spite of the paper's strengths we end up with some old and dangerous myths which need challenging. Byers supports the argument for a radical evolutionary shift at the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic boundary; people began rule-governed action attested by symboling ac- tivity. He elaborates a series of dualisms. First there was function-oriented behaviour-focus upon material achievement via the unmediated natural affordances of things, a technical relation with things. Social life and production were formulaic. Then behaviour became goal-oriented and rule-governed-action. Society now had constitutive standards and moral ideals, rules gov- erning mediated action. Symbols and meanings ac- company social structure (a concept curiously absent here). People become "effortlessly reflexive." This is not a part-time thing, hence the sudden, all-or-nothing change, and it is visible in material cultural style. I am all for Byers's stress on understanding the mediated and reflexive character of social action, but I find the dual- isms disabling. There are problems with the concepts of meaning and intention which centre on the issue of interpretation. It is held that the "meaning" of a behaviour/action (if rule-governed) is determined by the nature of the inten- tion that it is satisfying-meaning is the content of the intention. But what of uncertainty, negotiation, and dis- tortion? Intentions, actions, and interests are forever in- terpretable. What of the pragmatics of rhetoric and dis- course, which seek to persuade the sense of one interest or intention over another? Intersubjectivity is missing here, and this is the importance of interpretation. We should ask whether making can ever be simply functional and formulaic. Affordance, too-how are they ever not interpretable but "direct"? Is a chimpan- zee looking for a tool to probe for ants not interpreting the affordances of different sticks? I am surprised by the absence of discussion of animal society and tool use; why should animals not be intentional beings? Nor do I understand how intention can explain the aesthetic of an artefact. What is a maker intending in an artefact with respect to the category of the aesthetic? Is cave art to be explained only as iconic warrant? This seems narrow and reductive, even functionalist. Effortless reflexivity, the condition of the evolution- ary change, is defined as the modification of behaviour on the basis of an understanding of the agent's own men- tal contents. What about animal reflexivity? In what ways is it so effortful? Byers defines effortful reflexivity as childlike, not wilful, externally instigated, mentally laborious, non-routine or not everyday, in contrast to an easy consciousness. Am I naive in asking about the difficulties of ideology and confusion (associated with interpretability)? Perhaps "effortless reflexivity" means the ability to discourse about confusion too, but the story of human reflexivity is surely one of enormous effort to overcome misrepresentation and the force of practical interest or habit. What I would argue is that there never is or was a generation of meaning simply from intention. Meaning and intention are always interpreted. To hold that arte- facts can be explained by their maker's intentions is to fall into the intentional fallacy so much criticised in recent cultural theory. Artefacts have an independence. A potter's skills of interpretation may or may not allow an apparent coincidence of intention and artefact. The designed piece is also open to all sorts of interpretations quite independent of the maker. On what grounds are these meanings less valid than the maker's? An artefact is designed and consumed; both are important. Byers distinguishes functions and affordances from goals and locates the distinction in an evolutionary change. I argue that attending to affordances or goals depends on the degree of anthropomorphism adopted in talking about artefacts. It is not an absolute distinction but generally depends on (interpretive) point of view. The dualisms with which he operates are argued a priori, and I think they are part of a metaphysics which aims to divide the intentional consciousness of people from animals and technical relations with things. People too are artefacts (sexually reproduced and sub- ject to socialisation), and artefacts can take the place of social agents (as Byers argues with his concept of iconic warrant). Against Byers I argue (with Bruno Latour) that it is better to have action not as a property of humans but as an association of agents who may be more or less anthropomorphic or "human." This does not presume radical distinctions between social people and non- people or animals. Artefacts are best seen not as ends or means but as mediators-connectors. Design is about poiesis wherein making is translation, establishing con- nections. The hominid cannot cut the animal skin ex- cept with the aid of a blade. The problem is translated through an artifact. Together -these social agents act. This is one purpose of the textual analogy found in post- processual and interpretive archaeology but criticised by Byers. The argument is for the importance of rela- tionality and interpretive context (Hodder's contextual archaeology), not for artefacts' "speaking of" or referring to social relations. Artefacts need to be considered in context, making connections, structuring and structured by social relations, constituting discourse. Should we not be a little more reflexive about our accounts of social origins? Such accounts are about building our own (concepts of) society, and here we see being built the old distinctions between those who are properly moral and those who are not. Children and ani- mals and others who are not effortlessly reflexive, whose cognitive processes can supposedly be treated via exter- nal forces or mechanically or black-boxed, are consid- ered inferior or of a prior evolutionary stage and removed from morality and society. The break to an imposition of</page><page sequence="24">392 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 35, Number 4, August-October I994 order through conscious planning and with "effortless" reflexivity is something of a masculine myth. With little imagination the consequences can be seen all around us, for who is to decide on which side some people fall? I see multiplicity and a continuum rather than a radical divide. In spite of a philosophical critique such as this, we are left with the explosion of artefact forms in the Upper Palaeolithic. What was it therefore all about? We can- not, I fear, rely on an argument such as that of Byers, because what is missing is history. We are presented with a story-for-all-time about the origins of morality, without any agency, without an answer to the question of why. I argue that it is the particular and historical character of artefact-person interactions which matters. Rather than specify origins and essences, we should seek to understand beginnings. LAWRENCE G. STRAUS Department of Anthropology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, N.M. 87I3 I, U.S.A. 20 III 94 Yet another Rubicon, or a marsh with a maze of dryland hillocks and ridges? Are we making too much of the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition? Certainly it has become a cottage industry for many paleoanthropolo- gists of every subdiscipline (archeological, paleontologi- cal, paleolinguistic, artistic, and now philosophical), but was it universal and real? I would merely like to com- ment upon some of the archeological assumptions that Byers makes in his interesting but highly complex ar- gument. Byers accepts a priori that there was a rupture in humankind's technological abilities and that it was correlated with the replacement of Homo sapiens nean- derthalensis by H. sapiens sapiens, notably in south- western Europe. He grossly oversimplifies the contrast between Middle Paleolithic and Upper Paleolithic tech- nologies by reducing it to a dichotomy between non- blade and blade industries. In so doing he ignores the long-known and increasingly well-documented exis- tence of blade-rich Mousterian (and Middle Stone Age) assemblages throughout Europe, the Near East, and both North and Sub-Saharan Africa (e.g., Conard 1990, Ronen i992, both with references). True, in some sites and in some regions there does seem to be a rather abrupt shift from flake-blank dominance to blade-blank dominance between the Middle and the Upper Paleolithic, but in others there are blade-rich assemblages that appear be- fore or interstratified with flake-rich assemblages (Pre- Aurignacian of the Levant and Libya, Howiesons Poort and Umguzan of Sub-Saharan Africa, Seclin, Rocourt, and other sites in northwestern Europe). And in other cases "Upper Paleolithic" typological characteristics are accompanied by "Middle Paleolithic" technological characteristics (i.e., dominant production of flakes); this is the case, for example, with the Chatelperronian and early Aurignacian of Cantabrian Spain (Straus and Heller i988). In our recent excavations of the classic site of le Trou Magrite in southern Belgium we have found a "typologically" Aurignacian (keeled and nosed endscrap- ers, burins, etc.) stratum (3) with very few blades (either as unretouched debitage or as tool blanks) dated to &gt;33,800 years b.p. (GX-i8539) and 4I,300 + I,700 years b.p. (CAMS-Io352) and lying above a Mousterian de- posit. Overlying Stratum 3 is a level (Stratum 2-dated to 34,200 + I,o900 years b.p. [GX-I8537I]) whose tool assemblage is typologically identical to that of Stratum 3 but rich in blades (as unretouched debitage and as tool blanks) (Otte and Straus n.d.). Where does the Middle-to- Upper Paleolithic transition lie in this cave? In both the Cantabrian and Belgian cases, lithic raw materials-not human capacities-play preponderant roles in the pro- duction of blades. Others would have the Rubicon at the appearance of worked bone (hence many polemical articles from the days of Henri-Martin to the present). Yet there are many temporally Upper Paleolithic contexts with few or no such objects. Likewise for personal ornaments and mobile art, rich and abundant early in certain sites and regions (e.g., southwestern Germany, southwestern France), poor or absent in others. In contrast to Byers, I would argue that the shift in tool technology was not necessarily and everywhere abrupt but rather sometimes and in some places gradual or at least mosaic in nature (Straus I990). As for the correlation between technology and human anatomy, one would have thought that Skh-ul and Qafzeh, on the one hand, and Saint-Cesaire, on the other, would have sufficed to urge caution. In- deed, recent developments in the dating of Aurignacian artifact assemblages from northern Spain by Bischoff (e.g., Bischoff et al. I994) indicate that further surprises could lie ahead (see reviews in Straus, Bischoff, and Car- bonell I993 and Straus I994, with references). We do not know who the makers of the 40,000-year-old Auri- gnacian were. If the overlaps in tool technologies that occur between some Middle and some Upper Paleolithic assemblages and industries are any indication, it is not clear why there should not have been overlaps in sym- boling capacities and behavior-differences more of de- gree perhaps than an absolute Rubicon. After all, the Neandertal cemetery at La Ferrassie did include a stone slab with a pattern of peck marks (Peyrony I934), and the recently excavated Mousterian site of Quneitra on the Golan Heights did yield a nodule of flint with an apparently engraved geometric motif (Goren-Inbar I990; A. Marshack, personal communication). All is not quite as black-and-white as Byers would have it. The record is more complex and suggests a fitful, staccato progression composed of elements of continuity and of change. THOMAS WYNN Department of Anthropology, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, Cobo. 80933-7I50, U.S.A. I8 IV 94 It is generally acknowledged by anthropologists that modern human action is immersed in symbols; unfortu-</page><page sequence="25">BYERS Symboling and the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic Transition 1 393 nately, the cognitive underpinnings of this immersion have not been clearly set out. Byers's emphasis on re- flexivity and especially the facility modern humans havc in shifting from practical to discursive reflective moni- toring is a useful way to describe this characteristic ol modern thinking. Moreover, it is one that fits nicely into more general theories of cognitive evolution thai emphasize the increasing "externalization" or "decen- tering" of mind over the course of hominid evolution (Donald I99I, Wynn I993). One of the themes of human cognitive evolution has been the development of abili- ties to divorce thinking from the direct perspective ol ego and to conceive of and coordinate external perspec- tives. Byers's effortless reflexivity is a logical extension; in discursive reflective monitoring an individual sub- mits his own actions and thoughts to a self-constructed external perspective. Action-constitutive theory also provides some impor- tant insights. Theories of material culture are poorly de- veloped in anthropology (Wynn I994). This has seriously impeded archaeologists attempting to understand early material culture, and this is nowhere more obvious than in discussions of meaning. I think most anthropologists and archaeologists would agree that human tool use does not have meaning in the same sense that a word or a sentence has meaning; on the other hand, tool use is clearly more than simple motor habit. Byers makes the excellent point that tool use can have meaning with- out being referential. I find the analogy to games espe- cially apt. Games are rule-governed, and the rules give the action meaning, but there is no reference. In the same way, the act of tool use can manifest meaning in the form of rules of action. It is very important, I think, to understand how tool use can have meaning in the absence of reference, because it allows us to avoid the simplistic analogy to language. However, after making this very strong point concern- ing meaning and material action, Byers muddies the wa- ter by trying to subsume tool use and speech acts under a single linguistically based theory of action. I find this part of his argument unconvincing and unnecessary. In arguing that "rules of style govern the forms of things" in the same way that "illocutionary rules govern the forms of our utterances," Byers has succumbed to the tyranny of the linguistic model. Our theories of language are well-developed and powerful; Searle's theory of speech acts is an especially forceful one. Our theories of material action (to use Byers's term) are tentative and weak in comparison. It is very easy simply to borrow the well-developed ideas of the former as a means of understanding the latter. However, doing so minimizes some very important differences between language, in- cluding pragmatics, and tool use. The most telling differ- ence is in the ways in which language and material ac- tion are learned. Children learn language effortlessly, without tutoring; they learn material action only through laborious effort and practice, which is why ap- prenticeship is essential for almost all skilled material action. Something very fundamental distinguishes lan- guage and material action. What we need are more so- phisticated theories of material action, not its incorpora- tion into linguistic models. Perhaps someday the two can be subsumed under a general theory of mind, but not yet. In tackling the European Upper Palaeolithic, Byers has chosen an easy task. Few would argue that Upper Palaeolithic people were not immersed in symbols, and it is unnecessary to invoke style in stone tools to make the case. I would like to challenge Byers to apply his ideas to a much knottier problem-the Acheulean bi- face. While some (e.g., Davidson and Noble I993) argue that the shapes of bifaces were unintended consequences of the end-goal (to use Byers's term) of producing flakes, most archaeologists see the extensive modifications and the regularity and redundancy of form as being "over- determined" and clearly an "end-product" (again, to use Byers's terms). Byers argues that end-products and "style-2" assemblages are evidence of effortless reflex- ivity. Did Acheulean stone knappers have effortless re- flexivity or not? Finally, since Byers has made effective use of an arti- cle of mine (Wynn i99I) as a straw man, I feel called upon to make some clarifications. First of all, I did not set out to describe "the way symboling humans be- have," so of course my description was incomplete. My intention was to counter naive attempts to use prehis- toric artifacts as evidence for grammar (Byers's argument is not naive). Second, I did not then nor do I now espouse a dualistic view of the human mind. I did describe two different ways humans generate sequential behavior (ut- terances and tool use), and I did discuss modular and unitary theories of mind, but I did not propose that there were only two ways in which the human mind worked! Third, Byers suggests that I confuse levels of compari- son. As I certainly addressed the question of levels of comparison in the article, it is more accurate to suggest that we may disagree. My analysis of material action clearly addressed two levels: sequential action (by the way, the term "string of beads" comes from the work of Gatewood [i9851), in which language and tool use clearly differ, and constellations of knowledge (borrowed from Dougherty and Keller i982), for which there may be parallels in language (but see the above reservations about the tyranny of the linguistic model). I must also add that writing novels is very unlike purse seining un- less, of course, the novelist simply assembles memo- rized sentences. Reply A. MARTIN BYERS Montreal, Quebec, Canada. I3 v 94 I wish to thank the commentators for the considerable time and effort that they have spent on this task and for their insightful remarks, which highlight a number of</page><page sequence="26">394 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 35, Number 4, August-October I994 points that I would like to clarify. Several comment on the lack of empirical illustration and analysis. My rea- son is straightforward; I relied on readers' drawing on their own familiarity with the literature for the simple reason that I am not an archaeologist of the Palaeolithic. Although I would prefer not working under this handi- cap, I do not think it is fatal, since the point of my essay was to break a methodological impasse in Palaeolithic studies resulting not from the limitations of the current empirical data (despite Clark's claims) but from the lim- itations of the theory being used. To this end, I addressed the following questions: Given what we know about ourselves as symboling humans, what is the nature of symboling, and what are the conditions of its existence? In answering these questions I hoped to outline a theory that not only would establish criteria for identifying pat- terning that could only be produced by symboling hu- man populations but also would offer reasons for claim- ing that the emergence of this behaviour would be detectable wherever and whenever it emerged. A number of commentators (Marshack, Bednarik, Clark, de Beaune, Straus) have demonstrated that our current functionalist and behaviouristic conceptualiza- tions of material culture and its use do not explain much of the variation in this archaeological record. Where I differ with some of them is in their view that my inter- pretation does little to improve the situation. This may be partly because we are using the same terms to talk past each other; for example, I believe that Wynn (i99i) and Chase (i99i) would agree with me that symboling is rule-governed behaviour, and given his comments, Wynn would also seem to recognize symboling as ac- tion-constitutive. To my knowledge Chase would not; defining symboling as rule-governed reference, he would deny the possibility of using the lithic data to discern the emergence of symboling. In contrast, Marshack (also see I990) appears to define symboling as any intentional non-utilitarian material expression, for example, the use of red ochre or the production of scratches and marks that can have no practical utility. Hodder goes further, simply dissolving the distinction and extending the no- tion of rules to include any practice that is learned. All this is not to say that uniformity in use of terms is to be desired, but different definitions of symboling necessarily stipulate different properties of the record that will count as symboling, producing different con- clusions about the historical and evolutionary processes leading to the emergence of modern humanity. For Straus, de Beaune, Clark, and Bednarik, this eliminates the possibility and for Hodder eliminates even the ne- cessity of identifying the moment of symboling's emer- gence. For Marshack, the only limiting factor seems to be durability; many material expressions may have been mediated through the use of non-durable resources, for example, skins and other biodegradable animal parts and personal tattooing (also see Bednarik). I maintain that there is a categorical difference between rule-governed or symboling and non-symboling practices and that un- derstanding this difference requires the notion of reflex- ivity, since one condition of rule-governed behaviour is .he ability of subjects to monitor their own states of 'keeping in touch" with the world. Bednarik recognizes the relevance of effortful and ef- :ortless reflexivity, for he claims that I wish to treat ;hese variable values of the same capacity as mutually -xclusive and, while acknowledging that the distinction night account for non-symboling material expression, wonders if it can be used to account for the emergence )f the effortless reflexivity that symboling entails. But I im talking not about the presence/absence of a genetic :apacity, reflexivity, but about different forms of the ;ame thing, the proportions of which in a population ,an be expected to vary in response to natural and social ;election processes. Thus the effortful/effortless distinc- ;ion is the condition of complex historical-evolutionary ;election. It allows for the possibility that reflexivity is such was characteristic of most hominid populations while the proportion of effortless reflexivity required to ;enerate and sustain symboling was characteristic of )nly a few. The critical condition for the emergence of ;ymboling, then, is sufficient density of effortless re- lexivity to ensure the occurrence of the communicative noment that Harre calls "uptake." Among the felicity ,onditions of a speech act is that part of the speaker's .ntention must be for those addressed to display the )roper "uptake" in response to her/his material expres- ,ion, that is, to express in behaviour their understanding Af her/his intention, for example, to give a command, -xpress a preference, make a promise, etc., and all such )ragmatic (action) expression is rule-governed. The ?oint at which the proportion of effortless to effortful reflexivity in a population is sufficient to sustain "up- ;ake" to support the process of transforming end-goal- lirected practice into rule-governed practice is the sym- )oling transition. The evolutionary history of reflexivity for any given ?opulation is probably highly complex. For example, mvhere the proportion of effortless to effortful reflexivity .s low, the adaptive benefits of effortless reflexivity will Elot be ensured, as it could just as easily generate social ,onflict as cooperation. Again, two populations with the ,ame proportions of effortful to effortless reflexivity liffer significantly in average age of maturation. In ,hort, these theoretical possibilities open up interpretive )aths for explaining a great deal of the variation in the Ealaeolithic record, and rather than creating a dead-end -he effortful/effortless distinction does the opposite. I agree with Marshack that material expressions of -he types he speaks about express abstract thought, but ather than demonstrating symboling, these data may .ndicate that Palaeolithic human populations realized ibstract thought in non-symboling behaviour-the very ,ircumstances that the model I have outlined would 'predict." These data, then, highlight the uniqueness of iominid evolution, for this may be the only species to have generated major non-symboling material expres- ,ion, thereby providing the raw material on which natu- ral selection could work to produce populations with high densities of effortless reflexivity. All this goes some listance toward countering the charge of Bednarik,</page><page sequence="27">BYERS Symboling and the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic Transition | 395 Clark, Straus, and Schlanger and d'Errico that positing rule-governed behaviour as full-time symboling cannot account for the variable appearance in the Palaeolithic record of such expressions of abstract thought as Mous- terian blade industries (Straus), geometric microliths and engraved ostrich eggshells (Bednarik), and Middle Palaeolithic beads (Clark) or for the fact that early ana- tomically modern humans in the Levant may not have produced style-2 assemblages. One reason I understressed the social conditions ol symboling was to avoid encouraging a slippage into char- acterizing the meaning of style 2 in referential terms. It is clear that I did not convince Clark, who strongly advocates an information-exchange -approach. As I em- phasized, referentialism assumes that the real reason for style 2 is that it allows users to point to their so- cial or self-identity. I consider this to be inadequate and misleading, and, when looked at from the action- constitutive perspective, referentialism suggests that we use style 2 to distance ourselves from responsibility for the very actions we use it to mediate. Style 2 as rule- governed expressive meaning is premised on the oppo- site effect, for we use it to make present our intentions, and this use in turn makes present the virtual properties that we culturally associate with it-sacredness, author- ity, esteem, etc. In this way we take moral and causal responsibility for our behaviours, thereby transforming them into our intended actions. Of course, if social con- text is a critical part of symboling, then all material ac- tion is communicative; but communication cannot be reduced to reference. Because symboling uptake entails social relationships, I can accept Parmentier's relational definition of rule- governed meaning-but, only if by this he takes meaning to be the content of the intentional state of mind of wilful subjects in their apprehending "a pattern of rela- tions among signs, their objects, contexts, or referents," with this apprehending moment actually constituting these objects and their spatial relations as "signs and their contexts or referents." I prefer his dynamic view, in contrast to Chase's (i990) static one, that things take on different meaning uses-indexical, iconic, and sign- ing-in different contexts, provided that it is grounded in expressive theory. But I have several reservations, for in both his examples and his definition of meaning he could be taken as treating things and their relations as intrinsically representing something else, and if this is so his semiotic approach is incompatible with my prag- matic one. Hodder attempts to dissolve my distinction between material behaviour and material action and therefore the style-I/style-2 distinction. He claims that I have reified "the nature of rules" and asks, "if practices are repeated so that they become passed on as conventions, are these conventions not constitutive standards or rules?" My answer is that if the learners lack sufficient effortless reflexivity and/or the contexts that will sustain regular uptake, then these practices will not be transformed into rule-governed behaviours. In my view the behaviour of non-reflexive animals is not the same as that of symbol- ing humans in the practical mode of reflexivity, even should these appear objectively to be similar. For exam- ple, the hierarchical order or non-hominid primates as displayed in grooming could appear similar to the domi- nance order of humans as displayed in the "grooming" interaction of barber and client (and even some elements of the two behaviours may appear similar), but this is only superficial. While it makes sense to ask what kind of behaviour on the part of the barber would transgress her/his client's rights (or vice versa), it does not make sense to ask what kind of behaviour on the part of chim- panzee A would transgress the rights of chimpanzee B (or vice versa). In the former case a transgression might lead to the client's suing or demanding that the police arrest the barber. Hence only if chimpanzee B could call on others to act against chimpanzee A according to ab- stract (virtual) social properties in order to rectify equally abstract damages could it be said that the domi- nance hierarchies of chimpanzees and humans were of the same order. Hodder's claim, then, may be a classic example of how symboling humans project virtual prop- erties onto the objects of their perception. In the social world of the barber and the client, trans- gressivity is the background condition of all social be- haviour. In behaving with respect to others people must transgress other norms in order to discharge their nor- mative duties. This is why warranting is necessary. The doctor is warranted by her/his position to transgress the somatic privacy of others; this position ensures that her/ his behaviours are transformed to count as and become professional acts, and part of this transformative process is possessing and skilfully using the material culture ele- ments that only a doctor knows and may use in that way. In these terms we can compare the subsistence practices of non-symboling and symboling hominid populations. The former pursues survival in a non- transgressive social world by killing small game and scavenging dead carcasses, while the latter pursues sur- vival and reputation in a transgressive social world by transforming the killing of game into warranted prac- tices of hunting and the scavenging of carcasses into the social practices of butchering. Both elements of the latter subsistence behaviour presuppose a world of shar- ing and reciprocity, rights and duties, and in such a world both the game and those not immediately pursu- ing subsistence have rights. In this context, tools must be material warrants of action. This transgressivity of the social world of symboling humans is the basis of style 2. Of course, I am aware that this gives consider- able support to elements of Binford's (i989b) scavenging model. Despite his reducing rule to learned end-goal-directed practice, Hodder wants to hold onto the notion of re- flexivity, but he does not treat this as a capacity that grounds the emergence of symboling. Rather, reflexivity emerges out of the increasing complexity of social rela- tions that call for symboling so that symboling is the precondition of reflexivity with the latter as the product of humans' "probing" the "arbitrariness of power." For him "reflexivity follows from and undermines rather</page><page sequence="28">396 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 35, Number 4, August-October I994 than underpins the human dependence on symbols." This direct reversal of my view begs the question, for how could persons have any symbolic states of mind to probe for greater understanding without first being effortlessly reflexive in social conditions promoting up- take? I would of course agree wholeheartedly that in a transgressive social world power is arbitrary-in the sense of rule-based. Social powers result from and are the realization of collective reflexive social understand- ings in action (Barnes i988). But if I am correct, then in pre-symboling hominid society, power is not arbitrary. The nonreflexive or at most limited effortful reflexiv- ity that underwrites hierarchical uptake is based on avoiding testing the physical powers of the dominant, whose expressions of anger are very material and may be physically painful. Schlanger and d'Errico suggest that because a non- symboling population is "difficult to conceive of" (I cer- tainly find it difficult to think about the material ways in which such a population would behave) my logical grounds for the style-i/style -2 distinction are suspect. Does this mean that objective reality is limited to what we are able to think about easily? Surely not. What I am doing is attempting to explain empirical patterning by positing a causal agent. This requires modelling such an agent-using whatever conceptual resources appear relevant, such as theories of mind, reflexivity, analogical subjects, etc.-and then using this model to account for the data (Bhaskar I978, I979; Harre and Madden I975). A number of commentators have taken my conclu- sions as specifically claiming that the Upper Palaeo- lithic in southwestern Europe is the first (and possibly only?) emergence of symboling. I did not make that claim. Rather, I said that style-2 utilitarian assemblages mediate symboling behaviour and, therefore, the style-i/ style-2 distinction is the result of and mediates the emergence of symboling in whatever region it occurs. In my view, when style 2 emerges it constitutes an iden- tifiable rupture in the archaeological record of the re- gion. Furthermore, the necessary material warranting will be realized in the lithics as the style-I/style-2 dis- tinction, and this means that the criterion for iden- tifying the emergence of symboling in a region is the occurrence of style-2 utilitarian assemblages, and the "surplus element" is the result of rules transforming these material culture types into different warrant cate- gories. If there are also widespread non-utilitarian mate- rial expressive data correlated with a style-2 utilitarian assemblage, then the action-constitutive theory justifies attributing iconic warranting status to them also and reinforces the identification of the utilitarian as style 2. As I made clear above, it does not follow, however, that non-utilitarian material expression by itself can be the criterion for symboling-unless the patterning can be demonstrated to be of the same nature as that embodied in the style-I/style-2 distinction. It happens that the clearest expression of the style-I/style-2 distinction that I know of is the patterning of the empirical data of southwestern Europe between 40,ooo and 30,000 B.C. This does not commit me to the claim that this transi- tion occurred for the first time in southwestern Europe. In fact, I hinted that because it was so abrupt it could well be that conditions both intrinsic and extrinsic to this region were causally responsible, for example, local archaic populations with a low proportion of effortless reflexivity being stimulated by migrating populations with a greater proportion of effortless reflexivity. Whereas the non-blade/blade shift is particularly charac- teristic of the southwestern European transition (Reyn- olds i990), it does not follow that this is the only possi- ble way in which a style-i assemblage can be transformed into a style-2 assemblage. The Howiesons Poort assemblages may well express an independent transition in South Africa (Parkington 1990). Clark wants to maintain that symboling will become identifiable in the archaeological record only "long after it had become a significant part of the human behav- ioural repertoire." Since he directly ties symboling to behaviour, he is committed to the part-time position. For him, because symboling humans can perform sym- boling and non-symboling behaviours in mutually ex- clusive ways, it follows that they will transform their non-symboling behaviours into actions in a piecemeal manner; for example, first utterance behaviours become speech acts, leaving no observable residue, and then somewhat later these language-using humans start per- forming some of their non-speech material behaviours according to rules in order to signal social information, and so on. But if this is the case, then it clearly under- mines Clark's claim. The piecemeal, part-time view can equally sustain a reverse scenario in which first symbol- ing tools emerge and only then do non-durable sym- boling activities (speech) emerge. My point has been, however, that symboling as rule-governed material behaviour entails that both our "practical" and "com- municative" behaviours are material acts, that is, rule- governed material interventions performed so as to make a difference in the world. This is why I am com- mitted to the full-time, holistic view which I use to jus- tify the principled claim that wherever and whenever symboling emerges it will be perceivable in the archaeo- logical record. Clark argues that the real question is not theoreti- cal but empirical; only the later Upper Palaeolithic has "empirical sufficiency" to ground the symboling claim and "everyone acknowledges that [rule-governed behav- iourl was present." He claims that any earlier patterning in the lithics that may be attributed to symboling is only an artifact of the typologies used to discern it. I can agree with him that typologies are among the constitutive content of our perceptions of the world but not that the "typological filter determines our perceptions of pat- tern." For example, if we were to use different typologies to order the same data set along the same axis, despite these typologies' having the same data as their percep- tual object they would constitute our perceptions of them as different. What is more important is that we normally can rank these different perceptual experi- ences of the same data in terms of their relative coher- ence, suggesting that the typology that generates the greatest intellectual coherence more adequately "fits" the empirical data than do the others. While Palaeolithic</page><page sequence="29">BYERS Symboling and the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic Transition 1 397 archaeology deals with a data set that is largely defined by possessing the same range of end-goal-directed prop- erties, it requires two different typologies to order it as perceptually coherent, and each typology seems equally inadequate to ordering the part of the data set that is ordered by the other. Now, in terms of relative coherence, Clark has a good point-that there is a problem in the typologies. But instead of leaving it there he should explore the non- empirical reasons for this inadequacy, namely, that the assumptions underlying the typologies are inadequate for characterizing the human meanings the patterns manifest (Reynolds i990). According to Dibble (I989, i99i), one of the guiding assumptions has been that the lithics of the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic are equally expressions of end-product technologies, and he has at- tempted to show that this is not the case. But a success- ful rejection of this assumption, along with the theoreti- cal kit it presupposes (e.g., that symboling humans regularly perform non-symboling behaviours indepen- dently of their symboling behaviours, etc.), requires a new and more accommodating general theory of mate- rial culture, action, and mind. This can be used to ground new typologies that start to order this large data set more coherently and comprehensively. This greater coherence will be not just an artifact of typology, as Clark seems to think, but a product of better theories, and these are better because they better fit the objective reality underwriting the archaeological data (Bhaskar I978, I979). Typologies are not tyrannies. Rather, they serve us well or poorly according to the adequacy of the theories that we implicitly or explicitly draw upon in generating them. Palaeolithic archaeology, in particular, has a great re- sponsibility, for in claiming a sort of scientific monop- oly on the evolutionary history of humanity it has willy nilly taken on the obligation of becoming familiar with what philosophy, anthropology, sociology, psychology, and the other human sciences have to say about the nature of humanity. To state the obvious, humans are animals, and as such we are subject to the same range of constraints in nature as are other animals. But we are not quite like any other animals, for as effortlessly reflexive beings we are responsible for the conditions of our life in ways that cannot be claimed for any other species we know.
