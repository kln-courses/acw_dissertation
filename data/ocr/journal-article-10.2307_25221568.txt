Gld. 3. This book is not merely a new translation of the Behist?n inscription : on the contrary the greater part of it is devoted to the relief. This has been examined most minutely, and as a result of his researches the author has been able to draw many surprising conclusions from his data. We learn that the figures on the relief were not hewn out of the rock, but that they were sculptured separately and then attached or</page><page sequence="2">654 REVIEWS of books inserted into the stone surface, and that the original monument consisted only of Darius with the captive kings as far as Arakha and the first three columns of the Persian inscription ; above these was the solar disc with wings but without the anthropomorphic figure of Ahura Mazda : this, we are told, was a later addition caused by the victory of the religion of Spitama. A table showing by what stages the monument was completed is given on p. 17. It will be noticed that the figure of Fr?da is a late addition, and this is borne out by the fact that, whereas in Col. Ill his capture is not mentioned, in Col. IV Darius speaks of having captured all the kings. These are but a few conclusions drawn from an examination of the relief. It must, however, be pointed out that since the author's research is based on photographs only, his conclusions must lose some of their validity. There follows an appendix on tho date of the Scythian campaign. Starting from tho one certain letter on the inscription the author arrives at the date 494/3, which may well come as a shock to classical scholars : but his argument deserves serious attention. On the religious side the author accepts the Zoroastrianism of Darius without question. In Col. IV he detects not only a state of weakness in the later years of Darius' reign, but the triumph of the reformed faith. His injunctions to posterity reflect the basic doctrine of Zoroastrian ethics?good thought, good words, good deeds, or rather the avoidance of their opposite. Yet it is doubtful whether the ingenuous reader will not still see in Col. IV a monarch seeking the perpetuation of his fame rather than a defender of a new faith. Nor can one be expected to accept the identification of the G?thic Vist?spa and the father of Darius without discussion ; even less the statement that " dieser Spantad?ta nahm nach seiner Kr?nung den Thronnamen D?rejaw?s an ". Perhaps Darius was Isfandiy?r, but one can scarcely accept it as a proved hypothesis. In the present state of our evidence we have no means of deciding.</page><page sequence="3">DIE METHODEN DES YOGA 655 To the translation there are copious notes, some of which read perhaps a shade too much into the text. The statement that Sparda is the Persian pronunciation of the Lydian capital is surprising. The book closes with a discussion of the metrics of the inscription. Unlike Friedrich, the author maintains that only parts are metrical ; and these he compares to trochaics in the Persae of iEschylus. Here again we are on very thin ice. But despite many controversial points, on which it is hopeless to expect general agreement, the book is valuable and stimulating. B. 93. R. C. Zaehner.</page></plain_text>
