Prehistoric settlement during the Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic in the harra and hamad areas of Jordan was vir- tually terra incognito until lately. Initial explorations by Field between 1925-1950 and Waechter and Seton in the late 1930s yielded a brief insight into the presence of these occupations, but it was only recently (beginning in the mid-1970s) that intensive investigations of the region be- came the standard with the work of Garrard and colleagues in the Azraq region. The work by Betts and colleagues reported in this volume expands this knowledge base for areas to the north and east of the Azraq oasis and is espe- cially valuable for its documentation of the extensive systems of hunting complexes ("kites"). The volume is intended principally as a detailed description of the Epi- palaeolithic and Neolithic sites located, with a focus on the research at the Neolithic site of Dhuweila. It offers an examination of the material remains from the sites and an assessment of how sites are positioned in the landscape, with a more complete analysis and interpretation promised for future publications. The volume comprises twelve chapters, including an introduction and conclusion. The introduction (A. V. G. Betts) sets the context for the research, briefly describing modern land use in the harra and hamad, the environ- ment, previous archaeological research in the area, and a summary of investigations in the Black Desert, research conducted primarily by Betts. A chapter on the Epipalae- olithic (A. V. G. Betts with A. N. Garrard) follows. Sum- maries of the sites, most of which are Late Natufian in age, are presented. Of special interest is the discussion of the excavations at Khallat CAnaza, a Late Natufian site with several structural remains including walls, paved ar- eas, and stone circles representing dwellings. Despite the relatively harsh climatic conditions of the Younger Dryas that characterized the Late Natufian, sites such as Khallat CAnaza provide evidence that activities and habitation in the harra were more substantial than might have been expected based on climatic evidence alone. The next seven chapters report on the studies done at Dhuweila, which was occupied during the Early and Late Neolithic. The chapter on the stratigraphy and construc- tion of the site's features and structures (A. V. G. Betts) discusses the context of the site, its various phases of con- struction, abandonment, and rebuilding, and the radiocar- bon chronology. Dhuweila is one of a series of sites in the region associated with extensive kite wall complexes; these features appear to be related to hunting techniques that capitalized on driving game into enclosed areas where they could be efficiently dispatched. Windbreak structures are typical during the first two phases of site use at Dhu- weila, while more substantial architecture begins to ap- pear during the third phase of Stage 1 (Early Neolithic). During Stage 2 (Late Neolithic), the existing structure is intermittently rebuilt, with internal partitioning a major at- tribute. Stage 3 represents deflated deposits that are post- Neolithic in age. Chapters on the chipped stone (C. McCartney and A. V. G. Betts), ground stone (K. Wright), and pottery and miscellaneous items (A. V. G. Betts with D. S. Reese, L. Cooke, and C. McClintock) detail the cultural artifacts recovered from Dhuweila. The technology of core reduc- tion and blank manufacture is thoroughly presented. Over time, there is a shift from an emphasis on naviform core technology and lamellar blanks characteristic of the later PPNB to a more flake-based technology, although the con- tinued presence of naviform cores in the sequence demon- strates that this technology of preparing cores did not become a lost art. Among the chipped stone tools, arrow- heads form an important component, as do burins. Both are suggestive of the importance of hunting at the site, with some forms of arrowheads (Badia points) indicat- ing wide-flung contacts across the steppic regions. Trends in the tool assemblages of Stages 1 and 2 also reflect widespread changes documented in several regions of the Levant. The treatment of the ground stone is similarly comprehensive and draws upon Wright's extensive re- search on this topic for sites in the Azraq and throughout the Levant. Of particular note is the general lack of diver- sity in the ground stone assemblage (specimens include primarily tools for grinding, pounding, and possible roof weights) and the small number of examples. This pattern is not unlike that seen elsewhere in the region. The pot- tery and miscellaneous finds are also few in number. As reported, these are exclusively beads (some of imported Dabba "marble") in Stage 1. The finds from Stage 2 are somewhat more varied, with beads, an animal figurine, bone points, a stone ring fragment, and potsherds. The beads include examples of shell (mostly Mediterranean in origin, but some from the Red Sea during Stage 2), bone, and stone. Fabric-impressed plaster with traces of fibers in- dicates cotton; radiocarbon dating of some of these fibers is Chalcolithic to Early Bronze in age. In the immediate vicinity of Dhuweila and other nearby sites, there are more than 80 rock carvings, which are described in the next chapter (A. V. G. Betts). Many depict animals, but some are anthropomorphic or abstract. A discussion of their context, significance, and dating is 79</page><page sequence="2">80 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 321 presented. Carvings such as these are found in other areas of the harra as well. In a few instances, these other carv- ings depict kites, suggesting that the kite sites such as those found near Dhuweila were used for hunting. The next two chapters discuss the animal bones (L. Mar- tin) and botanical remains (S. Colledge with J. Hather) from the occupations at Dhuweila. Faunal remains are quite numerous, with the majority of the mammals being gazelle; there are also a few specimens from equids, wild caprines, hares, canids, and so forth. Other remains include tortoise and several birds such as various sandgrouse, a bustard, a partridge, and a quail, among others. A detailed study of the animal parts, age, sex, and processing, particularly for the numerous gazelle, constitutes the majority of the de- scription. Also presented are an examination of views on the hunting of gazelle and gazelle behavior. The abun- dance of gazelle bone is seen as supporting evidence for the use of Dhuweila and its immediate environs for hunting ac- tivities. Plant remains document the probable use of wild cereals (wild einkorn and wild barley) at the site; there are also macrobotanical remains from wild grasses, Atriplex, legumes, and others, and charcoals tentatively identified as Cistance tubulosa, the root of which can be roasted and eaten. A survey of the area around Dhuweila constitutes the tenth chapter (A. V. G. Betts). A number of sites and kite systems were located, documenting an intensive use of the harra during the Neolithic period. The Neolithic hunting stations are positioned near water sources and are an inte- gral part of the complex of kites, often being constructed into kite walls. There is an extensive discussion about the function of the kite sites and quite interesting material presented from the ethnographic record. Following on this, the next chapter describes similar structures from the Aralo- Caspian area using information from a publication trans- lated from Russian (V. N. Yagodin). This chapter is a valuable contribution to a better understanding of hunting sites in steppic areas and documents landscape positioning of the sites, their chronology, and their functions. Animal behavior is also discussed. The final chapter summarizes the information about the harra, particularly about the site of Dhuweila and the kite complexes (A. V. G. Betts with W. Lancaster). It in- cludes a brief summary concerning the people who have used the Dhuweila area in the recent past, as well as those using it today. A reasonable synopsis of the site's context and function, aspects of seasonality, contact with other regions, and use of the kite complexes is also provided. Specialists, whether professionals or students, will be delighted with the copious details presented in this vol- ume. Each of the analytical chapters contributes thorough descriptions of the cultural materials (including many data tables), analyses of patterning in the materials, and brief comparisons to what is known for the Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic of the region, both locally in the harra and more widely in the Levant. Especially gratifying are the ex- tensive sets of illustrations ranging from site plan views and stratigraphy to lithic figures, ground stone, botanical remains, animal bone, beads, and so forth. The numerous rock carvings in the vicinity of Dhuweila are also amply recorded pictorially in the volume. The issue of desert hunting using the kite site complexes is well researched, drawing on local archaeological remains and ethnographic accounts from neighboring regions and from farther afield in Central Asia. There are occasional typographic errors, and not all map figures are easily deciphered even with the help of the keys, but these are minor inconveniences in what is overall an excellent presentation of baseline data often not available in other venues. One can but look for- ward to the more extensive history and prehistory discus- sion of the region intended for future publications. Deborah I. Olszewski Bernice P.
