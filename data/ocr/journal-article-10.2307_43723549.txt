Pp. 271. Paper N.P. In his superb programmatic essay "Anthropomorphic Cult Statuary in Iron Age Palestine and the Search for Yahweh's Cult Images" (pp. 97-155) Christoph Uehlinger states the central thesis of this excellent and important book: "Yahweh was wor- shipped in the form of an anthropomorphic cult statue both in the central state temples of Israel (Samaria) and Judah (Jerusalem)" (p. 153). This may surprise some who have not followed the lively debate on Israelite iconography in the last decade, but as this book makes clear, the burden of proof is now with those who deny that Yahweh was portrayed iconographically in the ancient Hebrew cults. That burden is taken up in this book by two authors. Tryggve N. D. Mettinger, in his spirited and closely reasoned essay "Israelite Aniconism: Developments and Origins" (pp. 173-204), makes a distinction between programmatic aniconism (such</page><page sequence="2">COLLECTED ESSAYS 207 as that of the Deuteronomistic theology) and de facto aniconism, which (in his view) was always present in ancient Israel, and from which programmatic aniconism de- veloped. This distinction is taken up by Ronald S. Hendel, "Aniconism and Anthro- pomorphism in Ancient Israel" (pp. 205-28), who explores theological and political aspects of de facto aniconism in ancient Israel. Authors of the other essays in the book illustrate and support the new status quo by addressing aspects of the discussion regarding iconography among the ancient Hebrews. Izak Cornelius, "The Many Faces of God: Divine Images and Symbols in Ancient Near Eastern Religions" (pp. 21-43), surveys and classifies the representa- tions of deities in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Urartu and Syria-Palestine; this study should be a point of departure for all future analyses. Angelika Berlejung, "Washing the Mouth: The Consecratioąof Divine Images in Mesopotamia" (pp. 45- 72), presents a detailed analysis of a Mesopotamian ritual often cited in the debate on iconography. Herbert Niehr, "In Search of YHWH's Cult Statue in the First Temple" (pp. 73-95), discusses the archaeological and biblical evidence for the first temple statue of Yahweh. Bob Becking, "Assyrian Evidence for Iconic Polytheism in Ancient Israel?" (pp. 157-71), analyzes evidence in Assyrian sources for iconic poly- theism in ancient Israel, concluding that it was a feature of state religion in Northern Israel. Finally, Karel van der Toorn, "The Iconic Book: Analogies between the Baby- lonian Cult of Images and the Veneration of the Torah" (pp. 229-48), explores the engaging notion that in Israel, the Torah was substituted for the icon of the deity. This clearly written, copiously illustrated, intelligent, and provocative book con- tains essays on important historical, archaeological, and theological issues. It accom- plishes two things: it provides a useful summary of the discussion to date, and it advances that discussion to a new plateau and point of departure. If one is able to read only one book on the new debate on the imago dei in ancient Israel, this should be it. Walter E.
