<plain_text><page sequence="1">A RESPONSE TO ARTHUR GREEN'S PAPER Howard Cooper* 'If you wish to know He-who-spoke-and-the-world-came-into-being, learn Aggadah; for through that you will come to know the Holy One blessed be He and cleave to his ways '(Sifre, Ekev) As I listened to this wonderful, humane, revelatory paper it was as if I was in a dream, not just any dream, but a collective dream, like the dreamers in the psalm - hay inu k'cholmim. As if our thinking, captive to old habits, trapped in traditional pieties and assumptions, was being released, liberated, and we were being returned to somewhere deep within ourselves, our homeland of the soul; as if we were being brought back to our true natures, alive to and part of the energy that animates the universe. I have been given the task of responding to this gift, this dream-work, and in starting in this personal way I am taking my cue from our speaker, who also began by opening out for us his own personal theological stance. It was, and is, the prism through which everything else is to be viewed. And because the light that he shone on to our theme was, and is, refracted through this personal prism, it deserves particular attention. It seems to me that this prism has several planes. First, 'there is a One within and behind the great diversity of life'; so we have here an image of the divine as immanent, suffusing creation with its presence. But whereas for the pantheist, like Spinoza, God is Nature, for the 'panentheist', the divine is thought of as, in Art Green's words, 'a Being or life-force' - and we note that slight ambivalence - 'that dwells within the universe and resides in all its forms'. And that, of course, includes us. According to Rabbi Louis Jacobs, 'panentheism' is a form of monotheism, inspired by Hasidism, in particular Chabad Hasidism, although our speaker today described his stance in a more radical way, as that of a non-theist, someone who believes, who knows, that Y-H-W-H not only underlies and unifies all evolving being, but 4s ... the evolutionary process' itself, 'about which or "whom"' - and again we hear the ambivalence hovering - we tell our sacred stories. So this is the first plane * Rabbi Howard Cooper, a graduate of Leo Baeck College, works as a psychoanalytic psychotherapist in private practice. He runs 'Exploring Spirituality' programmes at Finchley Reform Synagogue and is a writer and lecturer on Judaic, spiritual and psychological themes. 102 EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 39 No. 2 AUTUMN '06</page><page sequence="2">Howard Cooper of the prism: an energy, or Being, that animates the universe, rather than controlling it or overseeing it. Second plane: this One 'within and behind' all of life 'waits to be discovered'. So, it's not a neutral process that unfolds, in this view. It is 'purposeful'. This energy that animates the universe is 'aiming all along, however imperfectly and stumblingly, to bring about the emergence of a mind that can know it, articulate it ...' In other words, not only is humanity, human being, one aspect of the ongoing self-manifestation of divine Being, Y-H-W-H, but, like a Möbius strip, part of the aim or purpose of the divine unfolding is to be sought out and discovered by a part of its own unfolding, us. Its desire is to be desired, so to speak, to be known. This is the second plane of the prism: the evolutionary unfolding of Being has a purpose, a purpose intimately involving ourselves. But note that rather startling equivocation: the aim and purpose of this divine unfolding doesn't follow a smooth trajectory; it happens 'imperfectly and stumblingly'. These planes on the prism are not flat surfaces: they are bumpy, they have kinks, indentations, dislocations, aporia, discontinuities. Third plane of this personal theological prism. This immanent Being or evolving life-force, which lies within and behind all diversity of being, and seeks to be known by we who are party to this unfolding creative process, seeks to be known by minds, beings, who can then 'strive towards the life of complete awareness that will fulfil its purpose'. In other words, our abstract knowledge of this self-manifestation of Being is not the end point of the process; the destination of the process, its fulfilment, in this view, is not just reflection but action. An earlier draft of this paper that I was sent talked of this striving as being towards 'moral greatness'. Today, we heard that the striving is towards 'a life of complete awareness'. But these are back-to-back: a life of 'complete awareness' requires, calls forth from us, a synthesis of inwardness and outer action. So, this is the third plane of the prism: it adds an ethical dimension to the story. I think these three planes of Art Green's personal theological prism lie - and here I'm seeing them as analogous to the divine presence manifest within creation - they lie 'within and behind all the diverse forms' of thinking and reflection that flow through this rich and luminous paper. And, as with that divine presence, this presentation we've heard now calls out to you for a response. Ayekah - where are you? What thoughts have arisen in you? What feelings has it generated? What do you make of all this? In the unfolding process of this morning's session there is a mirroring, or an echo, of the process of divine unfolding that we have just heard about. The purpose of the presentation we heard was, and is, to draw forth a response from us. What is it? In both our inward listening and EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 39 No. 2 AUTUMN '06 103</page><page sequence="3">A Response to Arthur Green s Paper now our active responding we become co-creators of meaning, the meaning of what has been made present to us. Let me very briefly recall some of the other themes we've heard and that you may like to take up. You will remember that the call 'where are you?' can be responded to through reflection, deepening mental awareness, our thinking capacities; through feeling, the emotions, the heart, deepening emotional awareness; and through the human deed, action - this latter being 'the ultimate testing ground of our own religious consciousness'. These three responses are an imaginative opening-out of, and reworking of, the rabbinic statement that the world rests on three things: Torah, Avodah and Gemillut Hasadim. They exemplify what Arthur Green calls his 'midrashic method'. And this method, at once both playful and deeply committed, was something I think we saw manifested throughout his presentation. It's an approach congruent with a key sentiment that he just slipped, deftly but subversively, into his text: that 'religious truth belongs to the language of poetry, not discursive prose'. This then allows, for example, what he described as his 'universalising' of rabbinic teaching, so as to get at the core of the Judaic vision and message. I happen to think this 'universalising' is a crucial aspect of the evolution of Jewish consciousness for our times, and you may want to take up this theme as we proceed. You may want too to take up some of the tensions the paper articulated between, for example, traditional vertical metaphors (where God is up, or outside) and internal metaphors (where God or Torah is within us); or the questions of theodicy which emerge from the notion of an all-powerful God who has not sufficiently conquered the forces of chaos and darkness; or the way in which Judaism wrestled with God - Elohim - as a Being who contained within itself internal conflicts, just like us. All these themes touch on the ways in which in the evolution of human consciousness, we have projected on to God 'all our human-like images'. But if, as our consciousness evolves, we do withdraw our projections on to the Eyn Sof, the One without limit and beyond all images, the question is what do we have left? It was interesting to me that after acknowledging this central phenomenon of projection, which is about our psychological need, our speaker was very soon talking about God's loneliness, God's need (( à la Heschel) for relationship. If we do smash the idols we make of God, consciously and unconsciously, maybe it is we who will end up feeling lonely - and are we then, out of force of habit, going to project this loneliness back on to the divine and sneak our anthropomorphism in again through the back door? Just a question. 104 EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 39 No. 2 AUTUMN '06</page><page sequence="4">Howard Cooper Perhaps it is not surprising that it is the inward turn, the mystical turn, that is the culmination of the profound journey that this paper takes us on. We heard how the philosopher and the Kabbalist shared an understanding that 'the journey to God was one of inward human training, the struggle to purify the mind and spirit'. Both would maintain that intimacy with the divine was possible, whether it is through intellectual contemplation or mystical ' devekuť . But I think it is quite significant that both strands of Jewish piety required a borrowing 'from the outside', as it were. Whether in the past from Greek thought, or Neo-Platonism, or nowadays from Eastern thought, Jewish renewal seems to take place through a creative engagement with other modes of thinking, outside of our own particularistic orbit. To adapt an old image, we may have to make a journey to a distant land, following a dream, in search of a treasure, to discover only on arrival the secret of the dream: that the treasure is buried back in our own home. But without the journey out, into the world, and our creative interaction with that world, we would never find this out. And how impoverished we would remain. The journey and the return are One, echad. EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 39 No. 2 AUTUMN '06 105</page></plain_text>
