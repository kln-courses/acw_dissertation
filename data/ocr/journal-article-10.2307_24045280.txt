<plain_text><page sequence="1">Narrative and Topic Byron Almén Introduction CONSIDER THE FUNCTION of musical topic in three short examples. In example 1, a sixteenth-note ostinato figure appears, becoming the accompaniment to a lilting, dance-like melodic line. The undulating, tonally stable, and repetitive character of Chopin's ostinato figure evokes the gentle stasis-through-motion of the Romantic Spinnerlied, suggesting an atmosphere of rustic simplicity. It further recalls certain ubiquitous seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Figuren that appear in nature-pictorial movements and musically represent running water or gentle breezes. As a musical topic, we might describe the overall expressive effect as "harmony with-nature," nature being understood in its gentler aspect. If we trace this figure through the entire prelude, we see that it is employed continuously, undergoing occasional changes of harmony, until the final measures. There it is doubled by the right hand and subjected to fragmentation and a registral ascent prior to the two final tonic chords that signal the work's conclusion. Overall, one function of the topic "harmony-with-nature" in this piece is to provide a specific background environment within which the thematic material can move. In example 2, topic is employed in a very different manner. This excerpt contains the Golden Section point (m. 67) in Mozart's Fantasia in D Minor, K. 397. The first ten measures of the example feature the third and final appearance of a rhythmically hesitant opening theme, which has been engaged in busy dialogue with contrasting thematic material and unstable transitional passages since the beginning of the work. The musical topic up through measure 54 has been characteristically fantasia-like: frequent changes of tempo, a large number of contrasting motives, the alternation of harmonically stable and unstable passages, frequent chromaticism, a prevailing minor Much of the content of this article will also appear, in a slightly different form, in Byron Almén, A Theory of Musical Narrative (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, forthcoming).</page><page sequence="2">2 Indiana Theory Review Vol. 25 mode, and an absence of (perfect) authentic cadential confirmation of any primary key areas.

Further, the rapid registral ascent of the melodic line after measure 51 effects a stronger upward melodic thrust than was the case in this theme's earlier appearances. The rhythmic hesitancy of measures 45—51 is counteracted by the repeated figures in measures 51—52, and the cadential drive combines both the registral ascent of measure 5 3 and the beginning of an authentic cadence in measure 54. All of the musical features in this passage suggest that the long-delayed cadential arrival is at hand. While the subsequent measure does complete a dominant-to-tonic harmonic progression, the anticipated moment of closure fails to arrive—a failure that is effected by the most fundamental topical shift in the piece. Every musical parameter that was previously unstable and dysphoric now becomes graceful, euphoric, and free of formal-cadential cul-de-sacs. An entirely new theme appears, supported by the parallel major mode. The hesitancy of the opening theme is supplanted in the Allegretto by hypermetric predictability, balanced phrasing, increased regularity in rhythmic values, a clear tonal profile in the melody, and a conventional formal model with / leggiera mente ■*—*" mfm "ffrr^rr m m "frrrTrr &gt; #• m P 0 Fffrm 4 rf ^§g =Msst = * #"rrrrl^</page><page sequence="3">Almén, Narrative and Topic 3 immediate cadential confirmation. This theme combines the arpeggiated character of the piece's introduction (now in the major mode) with a motivic resemblance to the forceful contrasting theme in measure 20 (a resemblance conveyed via the repeated-note figure of m. 59). In this new "courtly dance" topical environment, the overall effect is one of assurance. This theme and its key are further confirmed in the remainder of the piece, and the sole intrusion of the fantasia topic—the cadenza in measure 86—is subsumed into a framework of stability represented by the allusion to the conclusion of a concerto.

Implicit in the above discussion is the assumption of a narrative trajectory, which will appear when a listener recognizes a fundamental opposition within a work and can observe its progress and, particularly, its outcome. In contrast to example 1, where a single topic provides a framework for the whole work (which may or may not contain the potential for a narrative trajectory to be perceived), example 2 illustrates the way in which a change of topic can reinforce, highlight, or even constitute the primary oppositions within a narrative trajectory.2 The third example shows the opening measures of the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in A-flat Major, op. 110. In this excerpt, several topics appear in succession. The gentle theme of the opening four bars is a hybrid of the sarabande and chorale. While the antecedent function of this phrase implies a consequent to follow, the unexpected recitative emerging from the fermata frustrates the theme's forward momentum. Rather than the foreshadowed consequent, what follows instead is a new theme (mm. 5—12), also displaying sarabande features (slow tempo, emphasis on the second beat), but with a "singing" topic in the melody and accompaniment. The passage sheds its chorale associations as it creates a more unalloyed dance-like environment, giving the impression that the initial theme was a false start. The new theme is then affirmed by a rhythmically active transition characterized by the "brilliant" style. This passage features rapid arpeggiations that first outline the tonic triad, then move away to prepare the subordinate key of B major, which arrives—after some digression—in measure 28. 'i am loosely following Robert Hatten's usage of the term "topical field," which he defines as "larger areas . . . that are supported by topical oppositions." See Robert S. Hatten, Musical Meaning in Beethoven: Maikedness, Correlation, and Interpretation (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994), 295. 2Topic also plays a role in delimiting smaller musical spans in this piece, but I will not elaborate on this aspect here.</page><page sequence="5">Almén, Narrative and Topic EXAMPLE 3.

In contrast to the simple opposition of the two main topical fields in example 2, this third example illustrates a more complex relationship between topics. Here the topics are more localized, serving to flesh out individual semantic units, or isotopies, as Eero Tarasti has labeled them.3 A narrative interpretation, if one is borne out by subsequent events, would involve the coordination of these isotopies into a global set of relationships that suggests a particular resolution to whatever conflict was developed. Topic, in this instance, influences narrative on a much different level than was the case with examples 1 and 2. The above examples reveal that while narrative and topic are both primary contributors to the creation and identification of musical expression, the relationship between them is variable and often complex.

Recently, however, some fruitful developments have made this issue less problematic. This paper takes at its point of departure the work of Robert Hatten on topic, as well as my own previous research on narrative. Starting from these strengthened theoretical foundations, the discussion below will suggest a classification of the various ways narrative and topic may interact in musical works. Topical Analysis Topic, as a conceptual and analytical tool, has found its way into discourse about music in the last generation or so after its prominent employment in Leonard Ratner's book Classic Music: Expression, Form and Style. The most thorough and exhaustive discussion of the concept of topic after Ratner, however, is likely to be found in the 1994 book Musical Meaning in Beethoven: Markedness, Correlation, and Interpretation by Robert Hatten.5 This discussion is part of a larger theory of expressive meaning that considers, among other aspects, how oppositions of musical elements give rise to expressive oppositions, how the juxtaposition of expressive types brings about new expressive interpretations, and how individual, piece-specific correlations Maus, "Music as Narrative," Indiana Theory Review 12 (1991): 1—34; Vera Micznik, "Music and Narrative Revisited: Degrees of Narrativity in Beethoven and Mahler," Journal of the Royal Musical Association 126, no. 2 (2001): 193—249; Raymond Monelle, Linguistics and Semiotics in Music (Philadelphia: Harwood Academic, 1992); Jean-Jacques Nattiez, "Can One Speak of Narrativity in Music?"

Most important for our context, however, is the way in which the implications of musical topic are developed. Using the music of Beethoven as a stylistic test case, Hatten starts with the premise that topics are, in the words of David Lidov, "richly coded style types which carry features linked to affect, class, and social occasion such as church styles, learned styles, and dance styles. In complex forms these topics mingle, providing a basis for musical allusion."6 Hatten employs topic in the traditional Ratnerian sense, understanding a particular configuration of musical characteristics as correlating with a specific expressive domain. This is in evidence when he highlights the employment of a "monumental" hymnic topic in the slow movement of the Hammerklavier, characterizing it as involving "primary diatonic triads, slow harmonic rhythm, and a slow tempo."7 As a further clarification he points out that Ratner's topics involve a mixing of categories such as style, word painting, motivic associations, social occasion, or level of discourse (high/middle/low).8 Hatten's first innovation is the recognition that all topics emerge from an "oppositional network of meanings," which is to say that they acquire meaning insofar as they differ from other possible configurations of musical elements that might be employed instead.9 This makes possible, on the one hand, a clear understanding of the ways expressive correlations are created (e.g., the particular impact of the Picardy third involves using a major triad instead of a minor triad as the goal of an authentic cadence in the minor mode); and on the other hand, a way of mapping expressive terrain using possible stylistic choices from a small number of parameters as coordinates (for instance, the combination of high/middle/low styles with major/minor modes). When employed over large musical spans, this latter approach identifies what Hatten calls topical fields, such as the pastoral or the buffa, which may or may not interact in a particular work to engender new hermeneutic interpretations.10 On the level of an entire piece or movement, the change of state from one topical field to another, or the employment of a single topical field to the exclusion of others, results in 6David Lidov, foreword to Musical Meaning in Beethoven by Hatten, x. 7Hatten, Musical Meaning in Beethoven, 14. 8Ibid., 74-75. 9Ibid., 80-81. 1 °Ibid., 295.</page><page sequence="9">Almén, Narrative and Topic 9 expressive genres that amount to large-scale paradigms in the sphere of expression analogous to formal schemes in the sphere of structure.11 Using Hatten's mode of interpretation, we might understand the Chopin prelude from example 1 as embodying a pastoral expressive genre, since this topical field pervades the entire piece. Likewise, the Mozart movement excerpted in example 2 can be interpreted as a tragic-to-triumphant expressive genre, in which one topical field gives way to another. I will argue below that Hatten's implicit recognition that topic can be used at different levels of magnification (local, sectional, global) is of great usefulness to a combined theory of topic and narrative. I will also suggest that expressive genres can be successfully integrated with a theory of narrative: they form a sub-class of possible narrative schemes in which topic (and not some other expressive phenomenon) plays a primary role in articulating either the overall narrative frame (as in example 1) or the conflict that embodies the primary narrative level (as in example 2). Narrative Analysis I have previously outlined a theory of musical narrative12 that relies on James Jakob Liszka's semiotics of mythic narrative and Northrop Frye's theory of archetypes.13 Liszka's understanding of narrative centers involves tracking the temporal course of a cultural hierarchy placed in crisis: Narration focuses on a set of rules from a certain domain or domains of cultural life which define a certain . . . hierarchy, and places them in a crisis. There is a disruption of the normative function of these rules—they are violated, there is some transgression. The narrative then unfolds a certain, somewhat ambivalent, resolution to this crisis, depending on the pragmatics of the tale: the disrupted hierarchy is restored or enhanced or, on the other hand, the hierarchy is destroyed, leading to social anomie, or terrible tragic consequences. . . . The ambivalence of the resolution reveals the presence of a certain tension which serves as the dynamic of the narration, the tension between an order or hierarchy, i.e., a set of rules which "Ibid., 290. "Almén, "Narrative Archetypes." 13James Jakob Liszka, The Semiotic of Myth: A Critical Study of the Symbol (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1989); Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1957).</page><page sequence="10">10 Indiana Theory Review Vol. 25 imposes an order on a culture, and the possibility of its transgression, i.e., the possibility of an alternative order.14 Since musical phenomena can be organized into explicit or implicit hierarchies in many ways, Liszka's model describes musical narrative as effectively as it does mythic narrative. To put this model into practice—to construct a musical narrative—the listener or analyst must recognize and coordinate three levels of operation (the labels for which are appropriated from Liszka's model):15 1. An agential level, in which musical-semantic units are identified, characterized and located in time. This level is analogous to Eero Tarasti's use of the Greimasian term isotopy, which is a unit that coheres via the "principles that articulate musical discourse into coherent sections."16 Using Hatten's terminology, we might also say that an analysis of this level involves the identification of those musical elements in an isotopy that are marked or unmarked with respect to each other or to an implicit model or ideal.17 2. An actantial level, in which the dynamic relationship between each isotopy in the piece is defined. Here each musical-semantic unit is understood to have one or more expressive functions with respect to the narrative trajectory; these functions will be coordinated through the articulation of a fundamental opposition at the narrative level. This will generally manifest itself as the increase or decrease of a certain expressive quality or characteristic in successive appearances of related isotopies, a modification that alters the relative status of one musical unit with respect to another. Again, we can appeal to Tarasti and Greimas for a model of actantial analysis through their concept of modality, through which the "activity" of isotopies is imbued with meaning by interpreting that activity in relation to an environment.18 This level breaks through the inherently bounded quality of units at the agential level (or of any expressive units per se, including individual topics) to reveal the dynamic interaction between units. l4Liszka, The Semiotic of Myth, 15. lsIbid., 121-40. 16Tarasti, A Theory of Musical Semiotics, 6—7. nHatten, Musical Meaning in Beethoven, 34—38. l8Tarasti, A Theory of Musical Semiotics, 38.</page><page sequence="11">Almén, Narrative and Topic 11 3. A narrative level, through which the interactions of the expressive units are understood in relation to the playing out of tensions between an order-imposing hierarchy and a transgression of that hierarchy. This conflict can be expressed in terms of a combination of two binary oppositions: order/transgression and victory/defeat. The four permutations of these oppositions collectively define four narrative archetypes. A romance narrative involves the victory of an order-imposing hierarchy over its transgression (victory + order); a tragic narrative involves the defeat of a transgression against an order-imposing hierarchy (defeat + transgression); an ironic narrative involves the defeat of an order-imposing hierarchy by a transgression (defeat + order); and a comic narrative involves the victory of a transgression over an order-imposing hierarchy (victory + transgression).19 The determination of a narrative archetype is not solely dependent on the musical data; it is crucially linked to the interpretive standpoint of the listener or analyst, who must determine what value to place on events (i.e., which pole of the opposition will elicit the participative sympathy of the listener or analyst). In counterbalance to the infinite variety of relationships that may be established in the first two levels, the narrative level identifies a small number of archetypes that describe the overall trend of the narrative. This level provides a standpoint through which the listener can interpret his or her narrative reading of a piece. The categories at this level are analogous to Hatten's expressive genres, although they are not limited in their derivation to topical fields or to a succession of topical fields. The archetypes coordinate the "bottom-up" contributions of the agential and actantial levels, articulating their narrative impact in relation to a culturally significant "top-down" classification scheme. The cultural significance of this third level—and of musical narrative in general—is not merely taxonomic; the archetypes provide a functional justification and explanation for narrative organization in temporal media. By tracking narrative trajectories in musical works, we are observing strategies that apply to any arena where divergent hierarchies are set against one 19Liszka, The Semiotic of Myth, 140. Liszka appropriates the four archetypes labels and their general features from Frye, Anatomy of Criticism.</page><page sequence="12">12 Indiana Theory Review Vol. 25 another, whether political, social, interpersonal, psychological, or ideological.20 Issues in the Integration of Topic and Narrative Given these definitions of topic and narrative, several other observations can be made. These five corollary statements are crucial to the project of integrating topical and narrative analysis, and I will discuss each in turn. First, as a locus for a network of correlations, topic is expressively static. By contrast, as a manifestation of the playing-out of a fundamental opposition, narrative is expressively dynamic. This is not to say that successive instances of a single topic cannot undergo change or development, but rather that the mechanisms through which individual topics interact are not specified by the definition of an individual topic per se. Likewise, while topics can certainly express activity—as, for example, with storm or battle topics—they are nevertheless expressing a state of activity, rather than a change of state. Consequently, topic theory requires supplementation in cases where multiple topics are present in a single work in order to account for the expressive implications of their juxtaposition. There are a number of ways to do this: Hatten's expressive genres and principle of troping are responses to this problem, as is Kofi Agawu's appropriation of Schenkerian temporality and beginning/middle/ending rhetorical gestures. These approaches are not mutually exclusive; they depend on what subset of the universe of meanings is being considered. Expressive genres, for example, are limited to conveying only the expressive effect derived from combining topical fields. Agawu's method does not explicitly uncover the expressive implications of grafting topical successions onto a Schenkerian graph; such implications are fleshed out by means of educated speculation after the analysis has been carried out. 20A more extensive treatment of these issues can be found in my forthcoming book, Theory of Musial Narrative. This work also treats a number of other narrative issues: the manifestations of narrative in different artistic media, a detailed account of Liszka's semiotics (focusing particularly on markedness, rank, and transvaluation), connections with other approaches to musical narrative, detailed analyses and explications of the four narrative archetypes, additional analytical lenses (archetypal subtypes, narrative phases, discursive strategies, rhetorical mode, Micznik's degrees of narrativity, topical classifications, primary narrative level), and the dependence of narrative interpretation on cultural considerations and the interpreter's standpoint.</page><page sequence="13">Almén, Narrative and Topic 13 One obvious strategy that has not been fully developed is the incorporation of topical data into a narrative analysis. This approach has the advantage of potentially allowing for other expressive mechanisms to be explored in tandem with topic (for instance, programmatic meanings, musical borrowings, or lower-level correlations such as the registral association of height and depth that do not cohere into topics); that is, the theory is not specifically topical in orientation. Further, the confluence of bottom-up and top-down approaches in narrative analysis allows the analyst to track the distinct contributions of each level: for example, broad similarities between two pieces on the narrative level might be combined with contrasting realizations on the actantial and/or agential level. Finally, a narrative analysis allows topical elements to play a role at multiple levels, and can specify the functions of the various elements at each level. With respect to the dynamic character of narrative, it is specifically the actantial and narrative levels that are concerned with the relationship between different isotopies. Narrative analyses are therefore not suitable for pieces in which change does not play an expressive role. Second, topic can exist in the absence of narrative, and narrative can exist in the absence of topic. Since topic and narrative have different relationships to temporality, the effect of various combinations of the two will be quite distinct. At one extreme would be a piece with a single topical field that did not evince narrative organization (either because significant oppositions or changes-of-state were minimized, or because the listener did not approach the work with a readiness to understand the piece in a narrative fashion, or both). In this instance, the work would have the effect of a character piece, a lyric piece, or a mood painting (the aural equivalent of a visual art form), where the primary impression is the establishment of a "spatial" expressive field. This extreme would be difficult to bring about in works employing functional tonality, since harmonic contrast and opposition are virtually impossible to avoid; but the state could be closely approached in pieces where such contrasts were minimized or deemphasized. At the other extreme would be a piece with narrative organization in which topic did not play a role. Again, this would be difficult to achieve using functional tonality, since almost any such musical succession would likely also capture some topical association. Since topics are generally complex combinations of musical events, however, it would be possible for a single parameter (harmony, for example) to manifest a significant opposition such that narrative dynamics were discernible without engaging topical</page><page sequence="14">14 Indiana Theory Review Vol. 25 associations. Between these two extremes are countless varieties of ways in which topic and narrative combine in a particular work. Indeed, topic can be active at one or more levels of magnification, while narrative potentially coordinates these levels to provide interpretive coherence. This aspect will be examined in more detail in the final section of the article. Third, a listener's perception of narrative requires both musical activity that supports a fundamental opposition and the listener's openness to recognize and interpret this activity as narrative. A familiar example of this situation is the interpretation of the conventional sonata structure. That music students today often need to be directed to listen for the essential stages of the sonata's narrative is clear indication that an aural predisposition to hear narrative is essential to its functioning. Narrative is not, therefore, an innate principle in music, although it can be more or less strongly embedded into a composition by a work's use of contrast and opposition. In the literature on musical narrative it has been claimed, by Anthony Newcomb and Carolyn Abbate among others,21 that narrative arises as a response to disruptions in traditional form, or appears when more common formal or structural explanations are not possible. Nevertheless, it would seem more likely that the sonata principle, in which contrasting keys and their associated theme groups are reconciled in the recapitulation, was at first a narrative scheme that achieved strong cultural sanction. That the very ubiquity of the paradigm strongly encourages the listener to follow the interplay of key and theme does not diminish the form's narrativity. The success of the sonata principle may lie, as Raymond Monelle has suggested, not only in the musical effectiveness of the formal design, but also in the suitability of the narrative—whereby the interplay of themes, motives, and tonal regions unfolds a hermeneutic reintegration of a transgressive element back into society.22 Recognition of musical topic also requires listener interpretation, although, by their very nature, topics are culturally coded so that those familiar with the contemporary or stylistic use of the musical language will be likely to recognize them. Topics also frequently involve correlations that are so strongly reinforced over time as to be nearly universal: the distinction between a euphoric major and a dysphoric minor mode, the association of 21Newcomb, "Narrative Archetypes," 19—20; Abbate, "What the Sorcerer Said," 229. 22Monelle, Linguistics and Semiotics in Music, 232.</page><page sequence="15">Almén, Narrative and Topic 15 register with direction, or of rhythmic activity with motion.23 Recognition will of course be more of a problem for listeners who approach the music as outsiders from a different culture or time period, but in general, since topics are simpler in constitution, they are less subject to varying interpretation than are narrative structures. Fourth, individual narratives can be simple or complex, depending on the number of distinct isotopies, the complexity of their ordering in the piece, and the nature of the relationships between them. Both the Mozart fantasy (example 2) and the first movement of Beethoven's Opus 110 (example 3) can be perceived as possessing narrative organization. Even from these brief excerpts, however, it should be clear that the two narratives are likely to differ in their complexity. Whatever the other details, if the Mozart example features a strong topical differentiation between the first and second parts of the piece, and if this dividing point is correlated with the fundamental opposition, then the narrative level, at least, will be easy to map. In the Beethoven example, however, there is no clear relationship between topic and the fundamental narrative opposition. Indeed, the multiple topics involved in this piece do not exhibit a clear-cut oppositional relationship; thus, the interpretation of the details, including the identification of narrative levels, will be relatively more complex. Fifth, the boundaries of what is and what is not a topic are dfficult to define with certainty. Certain expressive correlations seem to skirt the edges of the topical domain, while others are relatively distinct but intermingle with topic in musical works to the point where it is difficult to distinguish them. In the first category are correlations like those mentioned above, which are too subtle or pervasive to be considered a topic when taken alone. Examples include the correlation between dynamic change and change of intensity or expressive status, the correlation between registral change and motion in space, the correlation between tonal regions and notions of center and periphery, the correlation between rhythmic activity and motion, and the correlation between tempo and energy level. All of these correlations are extremely important in narrative analysis when determining the expressive characteristics of an isotopy or comparing the relative status of successive isotopies.24 23See Victor Zuckerkandl, Sound and Symbol: Music and the External World (New York: Pantheon Books, 1956). 24The most sensitive theoretical treatment of these issues in recent years appears in Tarasti's discussion of discursive categories (spatiality, temporality, and actoriality), domains</page><page sequence="16">16 Indiana Theory Review Vol. 25 In the second category are forms of musical expression that are clearly distinct from topic, such as certain types of programmatic associations, musical borrowing, or motivic or thematic intertextuality. In a more global sense, all these concepts, including topic, can be considered as examples of the semiotic process, since all involve a concept in one domain being made to stand for a concept in another. These issues are too complex to be addressed here in more detail; a fuller treatment of musical meaning that situates all possible contributions in a coherent framework remains to be accomplished. For our purposes, however, it is sufficient to say that these borderline or overlapping phenomena would function in a manner similar to topic with respect to its role in narrative processes. Indeed, one of the advantages of narrative theory is that the analyst may use virtually any method for identifying and characterizing isotopies and for determining their relationships, so long as these methods effectively account for different manifestations of musical expression. A Typology of Interactions between Narrative and Topic In the remaining pages of this article, I will illustrate a spectrum of nine possible intersections of narrative and topic, a spectrum articulated both with respect to these elements' presence or absence and by the use of topic at different levels of magnification within a narrative scheme (see table 1 ). These illustrations can serve as models for analytically recognizing and clarifying the relationship between narrative and topic.

Non-narrative piece with topic. As discussed above, it would be difficult in most styles to find a piece that had no contrasting musical elements of any kind. There are any number of pieces, however, that resist narrative interpretation because of the unlikelihood that a listener would recognize a fundamental opposition. Such is often, but not always, the case with short, strophic works intended primarily to convey the meaning of the text via word-painting, clarity of texture, and topical allusion. Schubert's "Wiegenlied" is representative of this category (see example 4, below). "Wiegenlied" is a lullaby comprising identical settings of three verses by Matthias Claudius that explore the metaphorical identity of sleep and death. In keeping with this theme, the musical material is simple and repetitive with respect to harmony, melodic contour, cadential design, and phrase length. Clearly the work makes use of the lullaby topic, one in which simplicity and a lack of musical tension are the primary characteristics. Also relevant is the rocking accompaniment figure in the piano part (appearing in mm. 1—4, 7—8, and in varied form in mm. 9—10). The harmonic progression alternates continuously and solely between tonic and dominant, an oscillation reinforced on the formal level by the alternation of half and perfect authentic cadences (mm. 2, 4, 6, and 8). Likewise, the melodic line centers around the pitches C5 and Bl&gt;4 (3 and 2), which take turns as structural pitch and neighbor note, twice resolving to Al&gt;4 (in mm. 4 and 8).

It would appear that narrative organization requires more significant motion toward a goal than is evident in this work. Using an analogy with literary narrative, if the protagonist is essentially unchanged, or easily achieves what is desired, then there is little reason to be interested in the story. Rather, the change or achievement should be hard-won and sufficiently complex to be worth the telling. As a narrative, then, "Wiegenlied" would not be worth the telling using any parameter or combination of parameters that one might wish. Even the most promising narrative element, the melodic resolution to A\&gt; in measures 4 and 8, is undermined by the ubiquity of the tonic triad (including the tonic pitch itself) in every measure, and by the simplicity and predictability of harmony and form. "Wiegenlied" derives its expressive interest, then, from other sources of musical meaning. First, its topical allusion to the lullaby brings about a specific set of associations and moods. Second, brief moments of word-painting—the gentle turn figure sung with the text "süsser" in measure 2, the repetition of the initial "Schlafe" motive as a soothing gesture—reinforce aspects of the text. Third, the text itself provides the primary expressive interest. The most striking aspect of "Wiegenlied" is the shock or moment of insight that occurs when, in verse 2, the listener realizes that the child being sung to is not asleep, but dead. The poignant grief that arises from hearing a mother continue a nightly ritual in the absence of its original purpose (perhaps as a way of comforting herself) grabs the listener in a manner that is only reinforced by the stubbornly gentle topical environment and the absence of any musical narrative trajectory. In this piece, then, musical narrative is absent; the work's meaning is negotiated between dynamic text and static topic. Type II. Narrative within a single, overarching topic. Here we return to the Chopin prelude discussed above with regard to topical environment (see example 1). Like the Schubert song, this work for piano uses topic primarily to create an overall mood or character—in this case, the "harmony-in-nature" first suggested by the hypnotic accompaniment figure that opens the piece. 2SDeborah Stein and Robert Spillman, Poetry into Song: Performance and Analysis of Lieder (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 111.</page><page sequence="20">20 Indiana Theory Review Vol. 25 Unlike the Schubert song, however, there is in the prelude some potential for a listener to perceive a narrative trajectory. One fundamental opposition to be exploited involves the contrast of registral space and directional contour embodied in the motives of the two opening subphrases (mm. 3—6). EXAMPLE 5. Chopin, Prelude in G Major, op. 28, no. 3: motives a (mm. 3-4) and b (mm. 4—6) jM A •? b -Sr. c cd -w . U r ' These motives are obviously related: both are harmonically stable, and, like the accompaniment figure underneath, they arpeggiate the tonic triad. Further, both contain short, dotted rhythmic cells that give them a lilting yet dignified quality and suggest a dance-like derivation. Despite these similarities, several musical aspects contribute to motivic contrast. The first motive, a, with its predominately half-note pulse and upward octave thrust in the piano's middle range, is more buoyant than the second. The second motive, b, reverses the upward directionality of a, is located an octave higher, and contains slower note values and a decreasing dynamic level. Thus, an element of "striving upward" in a is answered by the "yielding" descent of b, but in a higher register, suggestive of distance and a lack of energy. Like the accompaniment, the a motive's upward striving is self-contained and uncomplicated; largely arpeggiating the tonic triad, it results in an impression of assuredness rather than restlessness. Motive a's dynamic character is reinforced by its beginning on the fifth, rather than the root, of the tonic key. The persistence of the tonic key in motive b along with the termination of that motive on the tonic pitch seems to suggest an endorsement of as tonal and registral motion. The relationship between a and b, however, actually lies somewhere between oppositional and complementary. On the one hand, their registral separation implies a need for its removal to overcome a sense of motivic opposition. The oppositional aspect is further outlined by the contrast in directional contour, with the profile of b seeming to give way in the face of a's ascent. On the other hand, there are rhythmic similarities between a and b that suggest an echo effect between the two motives. The anacrusis-downbeat m</page><page sequence="21">Almén, Narrative and Topic 21 rhythm that concludes motive a in measures 3—4 is also used to initiate motive b in bars 4—5, giving the latter motive the character of a retrograde, continuation, or reprise of the first motive. In a certain sense, a and b can be considered two halves of a larger figure—note that b inverts the intervallic content of a. Their opposition therefore suggests a kind of inner narrative, in which two aspects of a single personality enter into dialogue. Three further, more hidden aspects seem to support this interpretation. The first is the continuity of the melodic line outlined by the combined motives, which (in mm. 3—5) describes a stepwise segment E—D—C—B that is hidden by the registral shift. The second aspect is the continuation of the registral ascent of motive a (D+ to B4 to Ds) up to the Bs in motive b (m. 5, b. 1). The third aspect is the resemblance of the entire melodic profile a+b to the notes of the accompaniment figure.26 The pitches in a+b (D—B—E—D—C— B—G) are found in exactly the same order in the accompaniment figure (notes 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13), and both contain the climactic neighbor-tone figure E—D. The narrative implication, borne out in later material, is that motives a and b constitute the primary oppositional elements. These motives possess some form of kinship, but are prevented from realizing this kinship by two factors: their registral separation and the directionality of their melodic contours. The narrative program in this case consists of various attempts to bring the two motives into a more harmonious relationship based on the removal of these two obstacles. (Note in particular the registral overlap of a fourth, B+—Es, between the upper voice of a and the lower voice of b that will play a role in the eventual resolution of this conflict.) Motives a and b are thus the piece's significant musical agents, interacting functionally under the aegis of a global narrative trajectory. The character of this trajectory is generated by the fluctuating nature of their relationship, which sets up a semiotic opposition between the potential for relatedness and the potential for separateness. The former is musically realized by the various similarities between motives a and b: their dotted rhythmic cells, their high degree of harmonic stability, their shared initial arpeggiation of the tonic triad, and their overlapping registral compasses (the span B4—Es is common to 26I consider the upper line to be the melodic line, although the right-hand material is actually in parallel thirds, lending a euphoric quality to the melody. In the subsequent discussion of the melodic line, the parallel voice will be considered with respect to issues of register.</page><page sequence="22">22 Indiana Theory Review Vol. 25 both). In addition, they combine to form a linear voice E—D—C—B at the middleground level, suggesting an organic connection through this hidden contiguity. The connection is reinforced by the continuation of the registral ascent of a into the beginning of motive b, preventing too great a disjunction between them. Finally, the two motives both partake of the character and shape of the accompanimental figure: apart from sharing its lilting, dignified, and dance-like quality, the composite contour of the right-hand phrase, with its staggered arch shape, is a reflection of the same shape found in the left hand part. By contrast, the potential for separation is also available to be exploited as the piece progresses. As mentioned above, this potential is primarily expressed through registral separation, contrasting directional contours, and differences in the respective sequences of rhythmic events. This conflict between two possible paths that the music might take— toward an apparently restored unity or toward a greater degree of distinctness—can be expressed in terms of an opposition between a narrative "order" and a narrative "transgression." The listener must then determine the standpoint from which this opposition will be interpreted. (Is the re establishment of "order" to be understood as desirable or undesirable? To the contrary, would a definitive departure from "order" be understood as desirable or undesirable?) In this case, the topical environment plays a significant role in suggesting narrative context. Given that the peaceful, pastoral accompanimental frame, the major tonality, and the leisurely tempo all suggest calm and avoidance of conflict, the listener is likely to look for a synthesis or mediation (a new "order") rather than a separation or "transgression." Thus, the narrative trajectory will involve the question of whether the centrifugal elements of the two motives will lead to fragmentation or synthesis. What the prelude in fact unfolds is a narrative romance, a reestablishment—through a registral and directional synthesis—of "order," of the kinship between motives a and b. Measures 7—12 contain a modified version of the primary melodic material, and serve to move away from relative stability and balance: the narrative action commences in an attempt to mediate between the contrasting elements of bars 3—6. The motive now in play (mm. 7—8, 9—10) is a variant of both a and b, and represents a first, unsuccessful attempt at mediation between them. Its rhythmic profile most resembles a, absent the first pitch, but the lengthened initial note and the high registral location (above the aforementioned overlapping region B+—E5)</page><page sequence="23">Almén, Narrative and Topic 23 suggests the less energetic b motive. The melodic profile still emphasizes an ascent, but one made less emphatic by the hesitancy of the initial appoggiatura Fl, and the motive ends on a melodically unresolved high A. The harmonic motion away from the tonic to a tonicization of the dominant further contributes to this motive's insufficiency as an effective mediation between a and b; its repetition, reintroducing the tonic key through the addition of a seventh to the final chord, has the effect of a half-hearted but unfruitful insistence. Leading into the second section, the repeated dotted anacruses of measure 11 present in succession the two as yet unconnected registral spans. An exact repetition of measures 3—6 occurs in bars 12—15, including a return to tonic—the obvious tonal location or goal for an attempt at mediation. Also recurring, however, is the original separation of melodic contour and register—the "transgression." The difference between this passage and its earlier appearance is that the listener has now experienced the intervening material, such that measures 12—15 are no longer an initial condition, but a retreat from experimentation and a return to the status quo. Measures 16—19 (see example 6, below) contain the first in a pair of phrases representing the expressive climax, phrases that together outline an octave descent from Gs to G4 (ending in m. 26). Instead of resolving the narrative conflict, the phrase intensifies it through a move to the subdominant and an emphasis on the chromatic F1! in measure 16. The qualities of each motive are present, but do not coexist peacefully. On the one hand, the rhythms of the melodic material derive from an almost obsessive repetition of the rhythms of the a motive, producing a sense of restless agitation. The directional profile of a, an assured arpeggiated ascent, has been replaced by a weaker reiterative figure that cannot rise higher than the F1! but descends inevitably to E in measure 18. On the other hand, the melody appears in the register of b and displays its characteristic descent, but without the intervallic and rhythmic contour of b. The second phrase of the pair (mm. 20—27) is the crucial section with respect to the narrative, as it features a resolution of the initial oppositions. This process is highlighted by a directed return to tonic (IV—V—I) that passes through the previously tonicized subdominant and dominant regions (the harmonic locations of earlier mediation attempts). In this section—the longest unbroken melodic span of the piece—the melodic descent combines the rhythmic profiles of a and b into a single, extended line.</page><page sequence="24">24 Indiana Theory Review Vol. 25 EXAMPLE 6.

These relationships are summarized in example 7. EXAMPLE 7. Motivic variants of a and b in the resolution passage (mm. 20—26) a' b' I 1 I 20 The final passage of the piece (mm. 28—33) features a repositioning of this accompaniment figure—the topical environment into the foreground. As this figure rises through the entire registral space of the piece, it effaces the narrative action, subordinating that action to the pastoral background and restoring a sense of wholeness. The motion to the extreme upper keyboard register lends a transcendent quality to the outcome, affirming the piece's synthesizing teleology. The final two chords abstractly present the combined registral space of the accompaniment figure and the a-b synthesis. The overall effect of the postlude is to universalize the narrative action by filling the registral space and to complete the pastoral frame. This interpretation is clearly not the only possible narrative analysis the piece could support. I have chosen to put forward an "internal" narrative of similarity and difference with respect to variations of a single, underlying motive, rather than a "relational" narrative of motive against motive. The above interpretation is effective insofar as it acknowledges the pivotal role of the overall topical environment in both setting up expectations (of a restful, non-tragic or non-ironic narrative) and reinforcing the resultant narrative trajectory. Type III. Narrative with two topical fields that constitute poles of the narrative opposition. This category is analogous to Hatten's expressive genre in that there are essentially only two isotopies that succeed one another at least once a' i 1 r 20 b^_ 24 I</page><page sequence="26">26 Indiana Theory Review Vol. 25 in the piece.27 For a piece to belong to this category, the primary responsibility for carrying the narrative opposition must fall on the contrasting topical fields, with no other significant topics active on other levels. In very large works, topics tend to operate on multiple levels—contributing to the characterization of musical agents, marking off other pivotal movements in the narrative trajectory, and so on—and belong more properly to Type VI, discussed below. In practice, then, the number of such pieces is limited, since these works must be modest enough in size and/or constitution that other contrasting features capable of supporting narrative oppositions do not arise. Certain Romantic character pieces and lieder are among the most suitable candidates, since they frequently involve large-scale interplay of topical fields and are, in a few instances, parametrically de-tensional enough to support such a one-dimensional narrative structure.28 A possible exemplar is Schubert's three-verse strophic song "An den Mond," D. 468, which consists of an eight-measure modulating period in A major followed by an eight-measure period (plus a two-measure postlude) in A minor. The two isotopies contain contrasting accompaniment figures and degrees of harmonic complexity (the former largely alternating between tonic and dominant, and the latter featuring tonicization of the relative major, several diminished sevenths, frequent employment of secondary dominants, and prominent chromaticism). They also support poetic lines of contrasting character—the former largely concerned with fond memories of natural settings and joyous meetings, the latter with themes of separation and loss— and the final revelation that the narrator-subject is singing from beyond the grave(!). In this piece, the fundamental oppositions exactly correlate with the two contrasting topical fields, and the resultant tragic narrative therefore takes its cue from this opposition. The initial "order" represented by the first isotopy is denied by the subsequent "transgression": the separation of the lovers by the subject's death in the second isotopy. This process plays out three times as the three verses are sung, with the final verse confirming the music's narrative by making the reason for separation explicit. In this piece, 27Strictly speaking, expressive genres can also function in a Type VI interaction, in which topics contribute to multiple aspects of narrative organization. 28Other pieces of smaller dimensions may be less suitable for one reason or another, although this does not rule out individual exceptions. Baroque dance movements, for example, tend to feature a single, characteristic topical field, while Classical dance movements often either do the same or make use of multiple topics of short duration.</page><page sequence="27">Almén, Narrative and Topic 27 topic, narrative, and text cooperate to present a clear picture of the change from joy to sorrow. Type IV. Narrative with topical fields not identical to the poles of the fundamental opposition (or to any musical agents), but serving to signal important moments in the narrative (arrival of important isotopy, point of greatest tension, etc.). In this category, topic and narrative are not so strongly correlated at the third, or narrative, level of analysis. Instead, topic is used as an articulation device on the second, or actantial, level; in other words, it marks significant points along the path of a narrative. The fundamental opposition involves non-topical elements, with topics illustrating the progress of this opposition. As an example of this type, consider the final movement of Haydn's String Quartet op. 33, no. 2. This movement can be read as an ironic narrative in which the formal paradigms of the Classical style itself are undermined. The "transgression" is the successful challenge to the hegemony of an accepted organizational pattern. The movement features an overly malleable initial theme, which undergoes fragmentation and change of formal function to the extent that the organizing rondo principle begins to fray internally. Indeed, Hans Keller has written that this piece is innovative precisely because it presents "the very first structuralization of the very opposite of structure—of a process of formal disintegration."29 The narrative itself is elaborate and complex, with narrative "order" represented by the rondo paradigm and the functional identity of the initial theme as a beginning gesture, and narrative "transgression" represented by instances of fragmentation, passages with chromatic inflections associated with contrasting motives, and the réévaluation of the initial material as closural. Space does not permit a full accounting of this narrative, which is given in more detail in a forthcoming publication.30 For the purposes of our consideration of the interface between narrative and topic, it is sufficient to discuss the surprising appearance of the Adagio (mm. 149—152) with respect to its topical characteristics and role in advancing the narrative. Haydn's choice of musical material and his formal deployment of that material up to the second return of A in measure 141 are characterized by conventionality and sameness, perhaps even banality. The movement is essentially monothematic, with each section's melodic material traceable to the opening theme. The formal scheme is a conventional five-part rondo 29Hans Keller, The Great Haydn Quartets: Their Interpretation (London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1986), 71. 30Almén, A Theory of Musical Narrative.</page><page sequence="28">28 Indiana Theory Review Vol. 25 (ABACA), the A sections are harmonically closed, and the B and C sections tonicize various keys before preparing the home key with dominant pedals. Indeed, the work's relatively uncomplicated harmonic vocabulary and thematic homogeneity provide very little apparent material for a narrative reading. A réévaluation becomes necessary, however, when the routine final return of the A material is abruptly interrupted in measure 149 (refer to example 8). EXAMPLE 8. Haydn, String Quartet op. 33, no. 2/Finale, mm. 145—172 f p f p</page><page sequence="29">Almén, Narrative and Topic 29 At the point when the digression of A's rounded binary theme (originally mm. 9—28) should return, a new passage appears. The tempo slows dramatically, the meter shifts from a compound to a simple duple pattern, and a pair of descending phrases, replete with Lombard rhythms and rests, pushes the melody into a lower register. As it possesses a choppy, fragmented quality expressed by frequent rests and uneven rhythmic activity, this passage seems to drain the momentum from the primary motives. On hearing this passage, the listener may recall certain moments earlier in the movement in which fragmentation and sudden pauses were characteristic. As shown in example 9, the first of these occurs in the cadential passage of the A section's digression (mm. 23—28), in which short melodic bursts ascend above a dominant pedal to A\&gt;s (4). In this earlier context, the effect is to build up anticipation for the return of the opening material. A similar moment appears in measures 133—140, coincident with the dominant pedal that closes the C section. While this passage is lengthier than the first, the effect is still that of a conventional heightening of anticipation for the delayed tonal and thematic return. With the appearance of the Adagio in measures 149—152, a motivic resemblance can be seen between this latter passage and the earlier dominant pedals: both are based on a short-long motive—the "long" in the earlier passages being the result of added rests between each motive. Rather than signaling a formal return, as did the earlier passages, the Adagio interrupts this return and creates instead a formal "roadblock." The effect of the Adagio is to initiate a situation in which the process of fragmentation itself becomes the primary "transgressive" element in the piece. Up to this point, there had been very little large-scale contrast, but the latent connections of the Adagio with earlier material indicate that this contrast was not entirely absent, but merely required sufficient emphasis. The A material returns again in measure 153, as if nothing unexpected had happened, as if the Adagio were an acceptable substitute for A's original digression. As we shall see, however, the fragmentation-as-narrative-transgression now infects even this opening material, which is broken up into four phrases separated by Grand Pauses (please refer back to example 8). These pauses force the fourth phrase to assume a new shape, since it was originally connected to the third phrase. This phrase, which initially contained a powerful ascending stepwise motive, now resembles the less active opening. The long Grand Pause in measures 166—169 seems to indicate the end of the piece, and the return of the opening phrase comes as a final surprise.</page><page sequence="30">30 Indiana Theory Review Vol. 25 EXAMPLE 9.

I IT" The pauses have disrupted the integrity of the opening passage, and the repetition of the opening phrase in measures 171—172 serves as a confirmation of this discontinuity. This event implies that a repetition of measures 153—166 is underway. Instead, this "opening" phrase concludes the work, a structural fact clarified only by a sufficient passage of time—and perhaps a cue from the performers. Thus, with the subsequent arrivals of the Adagio, the Grand Pauses, the longer Grand Pause, and the truncated reprise of the opening material in the final bars, the structure of the piece must be reinterpreted again and again. By the end of the piece, it becomes clear that the opening phrase is suitable not only as a beginning, but also as an ending; its melodic and harmonic stability allows it to function in both capacities. The disruption of the rondo structure therefore compels the listener to understand the opening phrase in a new light, one that is itself disruptive with respect to the motive's original function as the first phrase of the movement. The opening phrase was not supposed to be the ending phrase, and its appearance as such points to the multifaceted character of this motive, which has developed more fully at the expense of the rondo structure it initiates. Furthermore, because of its ascent to the fifth scale degree and the placement of the Et over a weak beat, this phrase does not really work as an ending, ffrp J—^ k. h'v 1 - 1—7. ^ &lt;0 lip |k J —' (&lt;&gt; 4J p '' ||r- ' r- • 4,J m ft ' m -f |cijcjr|r ^Ci</page><page sequence="31">Almén, Narrative and Topic 31 adding to the surprise when it actually serves as the concluding phrase. It is typical of the ironic archetype that it reveals the insufficiency of a particular hierarchical order, emphasizing instead aspects that have been repressed by that hierarchy. The principle of fragmentation, when placed in opposition to the motives of the A section, causes that section to break apart, resulting in a réévaluation of the opening motive. In this piece, the Adagio passage, with its completely distinct topical environment, is not identical to either pole of the narrative trajectory (which plays out in the areas of formal conformance versus fragmentation), nor does it correlate with individual theme-agents (since the motivic predecessors of the Adagio material were not similarly constituted). Rather, it functions to make evident the narrative conflict, which, until that moment, had been merely latent in the earlier material. In this Finale, then, the change of topic is active on the actantial (second) level of the narrative, helping to articulate one of the significant moments in its unfolding. Type V. Narrative with topics used primarily to define musical agents. Into this category fall pieces in which topic is employed on the agential (first) level, as a means of distinguishing and characterizing those musical elements that will be counterpoised in a narrative analysis. As we have seen in the Haydn analysis above, it is possible to perceive narrative organization without thematic or motivic agency, but these phenomena bring music closer to literature in its narrative structure, and are therefore powerful mechanisms for shaping ■ 31 music. The opening movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata in A-flat Major, op. 110 (refer back to example 3) is an example of a piece in which topic delineates musical "characters" that interact within a narrative.32 Although space limitations do not permit a full explication of the particular narrative trajectory in this movement, the general approach to this piece as a narrative should be clear from the brief analysis of the opening themes above. 31Almén, "Narrative Archetypes in Music," provides an early discussion of the relationship—including commonalities and divergences—between musical and literary narrative. 32The character-based category of narrative is disproportionately emphasized in the musical narrative literature. This is perhaps due to the influence of Romantic critics like Schumann (who so often embodied their narratives in anthropomorphic theme-actors) or to Wagnerian scholarship (in which leitmotivic patterns predispose the scholar to associate musical events with ideas, persons, or actions). As the above spectrum of types should make clear, such an approach is but one of several possible ways to organize music as narrative.</page><page sequence="32">32 Indiana Theory Review Vol. 25 Characterized through specific topical correlations, the expressive hesitancy of the opening theme (IP, mm. 1—4-) gives way to a transgressive theme with greater narrative status (2P, mm. 5—12) in lieu of presenting the expected consequent phrase. This theme is subsequently affirmed and reinforced by a passage replete with arpeggiations characterized by a saturation of the registral space in measures 12—19. Analogous to a scene change in a drama, this passage modulates to a new tonal region, allowing other agents to contribute to the plot. A lengthy preparation for the arrival of El» major ensues in measures 20— 31, coinciding with the arrival of an extremely energetic S theme (mm. 28— 31), which ascends rapidly from G+ to C7 accompanied by a percussive ostinato and a forte dynamic level. There are now two transgressive themes (2P, S) challenging the primary status of IP, which now seems inadequate to the task. Furthering this impression, the remainder of the second theme group in measures 31—4-0 (motivically related to mm. 1-4) takes on a plaintive character, as if IP were being forced to yield to the more dominant S theme. The development, however, sets in motion a reversal of the narrative trends of the exposition. Material from IP appears numerous times in sequential fragments, improving the status of the opening material. When this theme returns it appears in a much stronger position, having acquired the accompaniment figure from the "scene change" that had previously confirmed 2P. Furthermore, the recapitulation of 2P is mitigated by its relegation to the relatively distant keys of the subdominant and the flat submediant, rather than a more expected return in the tonic. When the "scene change" music returns, it is separated from 2P by an interpolated recitative, and thus no longer appears to affirm that theme. The return of the S theme, too, is expressively weakened by a sudden shift to V7/V in measure 97, suggesting that it is now functioning in support of the subsequent material. This subsequent material—the coda—reprises the chorale topic of IP. This topic had disappeared during the development and the beginning of the recapitulation in favor of a dance-like melody-accompaniment topic. At this juncture, however, the chorale topic takes a leading role, returning the tonality once again to the tonic. The arpeggiated music returns, this time in support of IP, and 2P is completely absent. A cadential passage resembling the yielding response to S bypasses the S theme as well. By the end of the coda, all of the transgressive elements have been purged, leaving IP alone on the stage. In this piece, topic and theme-character go hand-in-hand, and the interplay of thematic elements with respect to each other and to their tonal</page><page sequence="33">Almén, Narrative and Topic 33 environments gives rise to a romance narrative; the hierarchically weak theme-subject recovers the preeminent position from melodically distinct and tonally contrasting themes that had usurped its place.33 Type VI. Narrative with topic playing a variety of roles (see types II— V). Most potentially narrative pieces, especially those of sufficient length, belong to this category. Given that there are multiple ways that topic can inflect narrative organization, it is not unusual to find that several strategies are used within a single piece. In example 2, I considered the role of topic in highlighting the fundamental opposition in Mozart's Fantasia in D Minor, K. 397. Here, a new—D major—theme appears in measures 55—70 and supplants the original theme (mm. 12—19) in narrative status. Unlike the Beethoven example discussed previously, this piece does not present the original theme as having regained its preeminence. Two rival interpretations of this narrative trajectory suggest themselves, distinguished by the listener's hermeneutic assessment of these events. The first is a comic reading, in which the arrival of the major mode signals a desired overturning of the old thematic hierarchy in favor of a new one. Here, the large-scale modal contrast of the two topical fields (minor, then major) is a primary determinant in the reading: the tortured rhetoric of the first half of the piece repels the listener while the arrival of the D major theme comes as a relief. A second (ironic) reading might focus on the apparent lack of motivation of the D major arrival and interpret that event as lacking in the transgressive validity or force that it attempts to proclaim. Here, the narrative hinges on the flippant denial of the theme-actors' sufferings by the major mode material, which "solves the problem" of the work in a manner analogous to a deus ex machina. In this reading, the hierarchical oppositions within the minor-mode region are set aside, having been overtaken by a dismissive or illusory new hierarchy. The disintegration of the original hierarchy in favor of an undesired transgression places this second reading in the framework of an ironic narrative archetype. The fundamental opposition of two large topical fields in the fantasia evokes the similar strategy employed in Schubert's "An den Mond." The fantasia, however, has a more complicated compositional design, with more 33One might expect that such a narrative archetype would be the same for any piece utilizing the sonata principle, and indeed this is often the case (the social effectiveness of this solution is one reason for its appeal). Nevertheless, other factors may result in non romance sonatas, and topical depictions of the "tragic" or "ironic" might play an important role in bringing this about.</page><page sequence="34">34 Indiana Theory Review Vol. 25 than a dozen changes in isotopy in 107 measures. As a result, a multi dimensional approach to topic is used to support the broader narrative. The overall narrative trajectory involves thematic, registral, and cadential goals. For the sake of brevity, let us proceed according to the first (comic) reading outlined above. EXAMPLE 10. Mozart, Fantasia in D Minor, K. 397, mm. 12—28 Adagio. As shown in example 10, the opening theme (mm. 12—19) is characterized by motivic heterogeneity and rhythmic hesitancy and, like the Beethoven, is initially contrasted with a more forceful but abbreviated theme (mm. 20—22), in this case featuring a repeated eighth-note figure and a chromatic descent. The two themes also set up a conflict between high and low registers; the latter is prefigured in the work's introductory isotopy in measures 1—11, where arpeggiated figures marked this register for attention. Adagio.</page><page sequence="35">Almén, Narrative and Topic 35 Finally, as we have seen, the lack of cadential closure typical of a fantasia allows for the delayed perfect authentic cadence in the tonic key to act as a significant expressive arrival point. The work's tripartite narrative goal is reached in stages. The D major theme, whose eighth-note accompaniment figure links it with the theme from measure 20, and whose triadic character relates to the material of the introduction, supplants the original theme in measure 55, unfolding in graceful, balanced phrases. Cadential, thematic, and registral closure finally occurs in measures 98—107, when the theme returns in first the low and then the high register. The D major theme is thus like a character hidden in society whose reconciling nature is at first not known, but who is able, in the course of the narrative, to achieve a synthesis of elements (thematic, registral, cadential) in a new society represented by the new parallel mode of D major. Topical elements operate on all levels of this narrative. First, they are used to distinguish theme from theme. Second, they signal important moments in the narrative, as, for example, when the transitional passage foregrounds the registral conflict characteristic of the two initial themes (m. 44; see example 11 below). Finally, they effect the moment of reversal when a third theme supplants the old order (m. 55). This employment of topic on multiple levels contributes to narrative clarity and cogency over a large span of time. EXAMPLE 11. Mozart, Fantasia in D Minor, K. 397, m. 44 Presto. Type VII. Narrative with topics that do not contribute significantly to the narrative trajectory. Because narrative organization involves multiple levels of expressive correlation (thematic characterization, interaction modalities, large-scale narrative outcomes), it tends to act as a gravitational center for Presto.</page><page sequence="36">36 Indiana Theory Review Vol. 25 semantic elements, drawing any expressive events into its network. As a result, it is relatively unlikely that a topic that appeared in a particular piece would not play some role in whatever narrative unfolding was perceived. Nevertheless, the possibility exists and, for the sake of completeness, I include the relevant category here. This situation could arise, for example, in a piece in which a listener perceives a narrative interpretation in spite of a seemingly contradictory large-scale topical field (for example, a tragic narrative within a joyful, euphoric topical field). In these cases, a sort of meta-irony might still force a réévaluation of the relationship between topic and narrative, with the dissonance between readings playing the central role. If we were to accept the semantic contributions of the text, then a narrative reading of "Wiegenlied," discussed earlier in conjunction with Type I, might be understood in this light and would therefore belong to Type VII. Type VIII. Narrative with no topical elements. Determining the proportion of narrative pieces with to those without topical elements is dependent on a consensus concerning what should properly be considered a topic—and what should not. In particular, to what degree does topic depend on a certain level of conventional precedence? Must a set of expressive correlations be consistently grouped together in a reasonably large number of musical instances in order to be considered a topic? Or, conversely, is a single instance of a set of expressive correlations sufficient to define a topic? This distinction has been addressed by Hatten with respect to his type-versus-token dichotomy,34 but I do not believe that the issue has been resolved by the scholarly community. I have tended to take a rather broad view of what should be considered a topic, since almost any correlation tends to call up the memory of previous examples that are in some way similar. Nevertheless, certain borderline cases might be discussed with respect to this category. Consider, for example, Schoenberg's Sechs kleine Klavierstücke, op. 19, no. 2 (see example 12). Schoenberg's early atonal works are musically idiosyncratic in relation to anything else being written at the time; thus, there would appear to be little possibility of topic playing a major role here. Nevertheless, there are certain gestural features that evoke earlier music: the graceful, if exaggerated, Romantic line (mm. 2—3), the tonal allusions arising from the ubiquitous thirds, and an echo of the dominant-tonic relationship in the stepwise descent from G/B to C/E in the last three measures. If one chooses not to consider 34Hatten, Musical Meaning in Beethoven, 44—56.</page><page sequence="37">Almén, Narrative and Topic 37 this piece as containing topics, it might still be possible to construct a narrative around the issues of tonality versus atonality and melody versus accompaniment.

Such a narrative might proceed as follows: mm. 1-4: short melodic fragment embedded within a framing accompanimental pattern mm. 5-6: interruption of accompaniment figure by a "melody" that has taken over some of its characteristics mm. 7-9: absorption of melodic figure into the accompanimental texture</page><page sequence="38">38 Indiana Theory Review Vol. 25 Since narrative organization is able to make use of expressive mechanisms other than topic (including extramusical association, borrowing, basic expressive correlations, text, and program), it would be reasonable to expect that musical narrative can exist apart from topic in an individual piece. Type IX. Non-narrative, non-topical works. In this category would appear works without sufficient fundamental opposition and directedness to support a narrative reading, in conjunction with the absence of expressive correlations capable of assuming topical characteristics. Certain styles are more likely to fall into this category than others: minimalist styles frequently deemphasize contrasts (in the sense of topical or narrative oppositions), or at least render them non-teleological; and total serialist or chance works resist both association (except in relation to the compositional devices they share) and meaningful contrast as described above. This category invokes the question of the limits of narrative and its relation to particular styles, an inquiry that lies outside the boundaries of this article. Concluding Remarks The relationship between narrative and topic, as the above discussion indicates, is complex and multivalent, and has not received the attention it is due. It is complicated by the fact that topical considerations significantly constrain and influence narrative interpretations; in many cases, topical details appear to cue interpretation, much as the light and sound design of a film can influence the viewer's understanding of events. Indeed, the potency of topical material may give rise to a suspicion that narrative interpretation is merely a retrospectively temporalized confirmation of topical significations. Despite a certain additional degree of definitional overlap (tragic topic vs. tragic narrative, for example), narrative and topic are distinct significatory domains. This article has clarified the conceptual boundaries and intersections of the two domains in order to dispel some of the confusion of categories and to suggest the multiplicity of ways that narrative coordinates topical events. Now that sufficiently detailed treatments of both expressive mechanisms are available, it is hoped that scholars will be able to reveal the undiscovered areas of the terra incognita, since it holds the promise of enriching our understanding of the way music carries particular meanings. Although there has not been occasion in this discussion to provide detailed analyses beyond that necessary for explication of necessary concepts, the general lines of such an approach should now be clear.</page></plain_text>
