Some problems in chronology This paper underlines the necessity for employing a broad and integrated approach to the con- struction of chronologies. Simple local archaeological sequences are not sufficient by themselves, nor can they be completely satisfactory even when combined with relative chronologies mechani- cally arrived at by distribution studies of inadequate data. General interregional co-ordination in historical terms is essential to the reconstruction of culture history. Batteries of techniques derived from different disciplines must complement and control each other if an adequate synthesis is to be achieved. Some cautions are raised in regard to the use of radiocarbon deter- mination, now the direct and indirect foundation of most chronometric dating. Ralph, E. K. and Han, M. C. Potential of thermoluminescence in supplementing radiocarbon dating Thermoluminescence in pottery is due to the fact that radiations from the traces of radioactive elements in pottery bombard the other constituents of the clays and raise electrons to meta- stable levels. The pottery may be thought of as a semi-conductor. Electrons do not have complete freedom of movement as they do in conductors, but with an extra boost such as a push from an alpha particle, they can move into excited or metastable levels. As the name implies, the electrons are not stable in these new positions, so that when the pottery is heated, such as in firing, each electron falls back to a stable position and, as it does so, it emits a photon of light. On being re-heated at a later time (in the laboratory) the amount of thermoluminescence observed is, therefore, representative of the accumulated collection of metastable electrons as a result of radiation damage and hence of the time elapsed since the original firing of the pottery. The amount of light detected (or number of protons emitted) depends upon both the time which has elapsed since the original firing of the pottery (presumably above 400? C) and the rate of bom- bardment from traces of radioactivity. The work done in thermoluminescence at the Penn- sylvania University Museum, Philadelphia, involving pottery of known age, is discussed. Evans, J. G. Land and freshwater Mollusca in archaeology: chronological aspects The theoretical background to the use of land and freshwater Mollusca in establishing a chrono- logical framework for archaeological deposits is discussed. Certain deficiencies in earlier studies KA</page><page sequence="2"></page><page sequence="3">Abstracts 285 are reviewed. Details of the stratigraphy of a site and of the modern ecological tolerances of Mollusca are two of the most important factors for any proper understanding of the significance of Mollusca for chronological work. Because of the way in which shells are incorporated into deposits, local environmental influences are difficult to separate from those of climatic origin. With careful work, however, this can be done, as is shown by the pattern of faunal change in southern England since the Last Glaciation. Work in four other areas, Central Europe, North America, the Near East and Africa, is briefly reviewed. Shawcross, F. W. Archaeology with a short, isolated time-scale: New Zealand In many respects New Zealand presents an excellent situation for the study of cultural processes in prehistory. However, difficulties are experienced over measuring the age of archaeological evidence, due to absence of precise methods of dating. It must be recognized that available methods are incapable of indicating exact events, but should be treated as variable quantities. This is illustrated for the estimation of the age of settlement from traditional genealogies. When radiocarbon is examined it is found that an additional factor of variation must be taken into account: the divergence of radiocarbon from true ages, observed by a number of laboratories in measurements of tree rings. The New Zealand run appears to diverge from those made in the northern hemisphere. When allowance for the degree of variation between the two methods is made, and after examination of the questions of population and site increase, it is seen that the radiocarbon ages for the beginning of a number of early settlements falls within the range of the most acceptable traditions. This suggests a hypothesis for New Zealand prehistory: that the so- called 'Moa-Hunter' sites, previously associated with 'pre-fleet' (and therefore questionable) traditions, may in fact be the evidence for the first major settlement of the country. At the same time, the mathematical generalizations involved in such calculations make it impossible to treat these separate lines of evidence as conclusively referring to the same event. Dolley, R. H. M. Medieval British and Irish coins as dating evidence for the archaeologist The value of coins as dating evidence to the medieval archaeologist in Great Britain and Ireland has increased with recent discoveries. In assessing the value, for this purpose, of individual coin issues, the author discusses the monetary policies of successive Anglo-Saxon and post-Conquest kings. England, Scotland and Ireland are considered in turn, with comments on current research in each. The need for close liaison between the archaeologist and the numismatist is stressed. Biddle, M. and Kjolbye-Biddle, B. Metres, areas and robbing The use of the metric system on English sites has brought with it advantages in the control and planning of open-area excavations, the applications of which are discussed against the background of experience in Winchester. The same background provides the basis for a discussion of the excavation and interpretation of robbed structures. Barker, P. Some aspects of the excavation of timber buildings At two excavations, Hen Domen (medieval) and Wroxeter (Roman), vestigial remains of final- period timber structures have been identified in the upper layers of the sites. The author</page><page sequence="4"></page><page sequence="5">Abstracts 287 discusses the variety of evidence encountered, the techniques employed to recover the plans of the buildings, and the possible development of such techniques in the future. Mate, M. S. Building in ancient India Archaeological excavations during the last decade have revealed various facets of the art of building as practised in ancient and Early Historic India. Several varieties of structures, hitherto unknown in such contexts, such as huge ramparts and embankments, auditoria and beautifully- designed tanks, have come to light. Very little of town-planning, however, is visible. Investiga- tions in Harappan remains add additional emphasis to the concept of Harappan urban architec- ture as a rigorously standardized mode. The period that intervenes between the two civilizations is shown to have been characterized by a slow and tedious progress from bamboo-and-mud to mud-brick structures. Fleming, A. The myth of the mother-goddess The megalithic tombs of western Europe have been supposed traditionally to have been con- nected with the worship of an east Mediterranean mother-goddess, largely on the basis of parietal art, grave goods and some possibly contemporary statue-menhirs. As a result, exag- gerated claims have been made for the anthropomorphic and specifically female character of the art, its religious meaning and possible international comparisons. But much megalithic art should be classified on a purely local basis. Positive evidence for a mother-goddess is confined to France, and can be dated at present no earlier than the late third millennium B.C. All French art should be considered separately from the art of Ireland and western Iberia, which is similar enough to allow the identification of an Atlantic art province, possibly connected with sun- worship and also relatively late. The beliefs of the earliest megalith builders remain a subject for future work. Ucko, P. 7. Ethnography and archaeological interpretation of funerary remains Archaeological funerary remains are discussed in the light of ethnographic funerary practices. It is argued that only with the widest possible approach to the archaeological material is it possible to appreciate the full significance of excavated remains. Not all burials reflect a deep concern with an afterworld or ancestor cult, and not all burial offerings need have been placed in the grave for the use of the deceased. Different burial practices may be adopted for particular categories of the population within a culture, and it is argued that the relative proportions of different burial forms may be more diagnostic of a culture than one type of funerary practice. Examples are discussed where the number of funerary offerings may not reflect the wealth of the deceased, and where the large and expensive tomb may not be the prerogative of a ruling class, or noble lineage. Variety and variability is a feature of the ethnographic funerary record which contrasts strangely with some of the archaeological assumptions about burial practices.</page></plain_text>
