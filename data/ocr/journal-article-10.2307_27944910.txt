<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mahler's Farewell or The Earth's Song? Death, Orientalism and 'Der Abschied' ANDREW DERUCHIE University of Ottawa The story will be well known to readers familiar with Gustav Mahler's biography: in July 1907, a doctor summoned to tend to his ailing wife also examined the composer and discovered the fatal heart condition that would kill him less than four years later. The distraught Mahler sought solace in Die chinesische Fl?te [The Chinese Flute, 1907], a volume of Chinese poems paraphrased in German by Hans Bethge, and the result was the song-symphony Das Lied von der Erde [The Song of the Earth, 1908-09]. Composed in the shadow of this terrifying blow, the work sounds a valedictory tone, 'permeated with the bitter taste of mortality', as Deryck Cooke observes.1 Stephen Hefling has noted that four of its six movements (numbers 1, 2, 5, and 6) deal explicitly with the theme of death.2 The colossal finale, 'Der Abschied' [The Farewell], with its dirge-like passages, central funeral-march episode, and dark C-minor tonality ? the key of the Eroica Symphony's famous funeral march, of Siegfried's funeral music from the third act of Wagner's G?tterd?mmerung [Twilight of the Gods] and of the 'Todtenfeier' [Funeral Rites] movement of Mahler's own Second Symphony ? has long been understood as a more or less autobiographical farewell to life, the 'gesture of a man ceremonially robing himself for the stately ritual of death', as Egon Gartenberg has put it.3 For virtually all writers who have cast a hermeneutic eye on the movement, its final section musically depicts the 'crossing of the doorstep to the beyond' (in Gartenberg's words) or the dissolution of the 'boundaries [...] between the living and the dead' (in Stuart Feder's).4 Certain commentators, including Cooke and Constantin Floros, maintain that a sense of tragedy and loss continues to haunt here.5 But the majority of recent critics take Mahler's finale to follow the trajectory from suffering to affirmation that had become virtually axiomatic for the symphonic genre in the nineteenth century: towards the conclusion, a radiant C-major tonality and a soaring, rapturous aria-like 1 Deryck Cooke, Gustav Mahler.

The final section, this interpretation holds, thereby expresses a vision of an exalted, ecstatic death, one that conforms squarely with the great romantic ethos epitomized by the conclusion of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde ? and several critics have indeed posited rhetorical parallels between Mahler's radiant C-major passage and Isolde's famous 'Verkl?rung' [Transfiguration].6 Hefling, Hermann Danuser, Donald Mitchell and Francesca Draughon have offered sustained readings along these lines.7 Though the details of their accounts vary, they agree in their broad lines of argument. Mahler's music and the story line of the text are understood to unfold a drama of farewell and death rooted in western culture's archetypal plot of 'subjective becoming'. The final, glowing C-major aria here becomes the reunification or transfiguration of an ego fragmented by the gravest of existential crises and the subject's attainment of a transcendental state: death is conquered ? 'death shall be no more; death thou shalt die', as Mitchell puts it ? and this triumph marks the climax of the drama and the apotheosis of the subject.8 In what follows, I will propose that 'Der Abschied' is more concerned with the very epistemology of death than it is with enacting the death of the protagonist of its story line or expressing any individual's struggle with and triumph over an immanent demise. The piece, I hold, seeks an alternative to the attitudes toward death that prevailed in turn-of-the-century Europe, and it does so by appealing to the mythology of the ancient Chinese culture in which its texts originated, and which its celebrated musical exoticism invokes. The epistemology of death that the work projects, we shall see, is ideologically antithetical to the archetypal plot Hefling, Mitchell, Draughon and others have taken it to articulate. For it is one in which individual identity recedes into an all-encompassing totality of nature. The piece is not ultimately a drama of the subject's transfiguration or transcendence; indeed, it is not a drama of the subject at all. 'Der Abschied' in this respect prefigures Mahler's purely instrumental Ninth Symphony (composed a year after Das Lied), which, as Julian Johnson has elegantly shown, 'is not about the journey of any specific subject, but explores the conditions of subjectivity sui generis9.9 In Johnson's 6 See, for example, Hefling, Mahler.

The piece (especially its first and last movements) unfolds instead as a perpetual cycle: identities (themes, keys, and so on), temporary and fragile, are continually wrested from raw unstructured energies (which Johnson likens to the Nietzschean category of the Dionysian and Kristeva's 'semiotic chora'), which soon reclaim them. Although 'Der Abschied' retains the affirmative, teleological cast of the nineteenth-century symphony, central to the work's affiliation with Eastern thought, we shall see, is that Mahler's musico-poetic apparatus reconfigures the telos as the liquidation of the very notion of subjectivity. Moreover, and related to this, the work comes to subsume the individual subject's 'journey' ? and death ? within a broader rhythm of decay and regeneration that it identifies with eternal nature. This rhythm is embodied by a cyclical dimension in the piece's form, which coexists with the linear element and is perhaps even more pronounced here than in the outer movements of the Ninth. Although it seems evident that Das Lied was bound up in the events of Mahler's life ? he famously claimed of the work 'ich glaube, da? es wohl das Pers?nlichste ist, was ich bis jetzt gemacht habe' [I believe that it is the most personal thing I have yet created] ? critics have perhaps kept the context too narrow by positioning the work primarily against its composer's biography.11 Mahler's particular response to the crushing revelation that his days were numbered would also have reflected the social and cultural conditions of its historical moment. We shall therefore begin our account of'Der Abschied' by taking a tour of the anthropological and cultural history of death in the century preceding its composition, highlighting that by the early twentieth century the act of dying had become alienating in ways it had not been just a few decades earlier. As a result, we shall see, the comforting romantic notions of ecstatic death that have featured so centrally in the reception of 'Der Abschied' came to seem like hopelessly lost ideals. And it was these new challenges to European attitudes and values that mandated Mahler's turn to the East and the thought of ancient China for a new way of coming to terms with death. The influential historian of death Philippe Ari?s calls the first two thirds of the nineteenth century 'The Age of the Beautiful Death'.12 Although the attitudes, beliefs, and rituals surrounding death varied somewhat according to 10 For Adorno's analysis of late Mahler, see his chapter 'The Long Gaze', in Mahler.

Europeans commonly viewed dying as an awesome, transcendental and even sublime act. The prevailing mythology held, as it had for centuries, that death offered repose and a desirable refuge from worldly turmoil. However, new notions of 'fraternal reunion' became folded into traditional Christian eschatology, and these made death a time for sincere happiness and even joy. To die was to enter, in Vladimir Jank?l?vitch's felicitous formulation, an 'anthropomorphic paradise'.13 Death in the romantic era, Ari?s elaborates, was characteristically viewed as a prelude to a great 'reunion [...] of all those who loved each other on earth, so that they prolong their earthly affections for eternity' in the beyond.14 The 'Liebestod' [love-death] union of Tristan and Isolde offers a paradigmatic example, and Emily Bront? also articulates this new idea in Wuthering Heights (1847). Just before Edgar Linton dies 'blissfully', he kisses his daughter's cheek and recalls his deceased wife: am going to see her'. He even adds 'and you, darling child, shall come to us!'.15 The allure of an 'anthropomorphic paradise' was evidently powerful enough that a father might fantasize about his daughter's death. Ari?s finds remarkably similar sentiments recorded in the memoir of a cosmopolitan family of French aristocrats, seemingly a world away from the Brontes' rural, Protestant Yorkshire. 'She stopped breathing at eight thirty', wrote the family matron in an 1848 letter reporting her daughter's death with great care and in great detail: 'What an angel! She was reunited forever with her Albert [the daughter's husband], with all our dear saints [other deceased family members]'.16 A European's relationship with death at this time was relatively uncomplicated. When you became ill, nature would simply take its course: you would either recover or die, although you assumed the former until it became clear that your time had come. A person's final days and hours were typically a deeply dignified time of great intimacy with family, friends and even strangers. In bourgeois and noble circles the deathbed ritual became an elaborate affair, and the dying person typically presided over the whole scene as a figure of authority: he or she received loved ones to bid them farewell, distribute prized possessions, forgive transgressions, dispense wisdom and so on. Death in these circumstances resembled a beautiful production in which the dying man or woman played the roles of the director and the star. As a corollary to these attitudes, death was often characterized as physically beautiful. An excerpt of the memoir cited above recounts in a fashion typical of the era the final hours and death of another young family member in 1843: '[a] radiant expression triumphed over the terrifying alteration of her features. She panted, but like 13 Vladimir Jank?l?vitch, La Mort (Paris, 1966), pp. 380-82. 14 Ari?s, The Hour of Our Death, p. 446. 15 Quoted ibid., p. 436. 16 Ibid., p. 428.</page><page sequence="5">Death, Orientalism and Mahler's 'Der Abschied' 79 somebody who is winning a race.' After the woman expired, her beauty only grew: '[t]he most consoling transformation had taken place. All traces of the malady had disappeared. The room had become a chapel in which our angel lay sleeping [...] more beautiful than I had ever seen her in life.'17 Reunion in the beyond, intimacy, awesome spectacle and beauty: the confluence of these ideas and practices characterized death for a great many nineteenth-century Europeans. As Ari?s summarizes: Since death is not the end of the loved one [...] death is neither ugly nor fearful. On the contrary, death is beautiful, as the dead body is beautiful. Presence at the deathbed in the nineteenth century is more than a customary participation in a social ritual; it is an opportunity to witness a spectacle that is both comforting and exalting. A visit to the house in which someone has died is a little like a visit to a museum. How beautiful he is! In [...] the most ordinary middle-class western homes, death has come to coincide with beauty.18 However, Ari?s, Vladimir Jank?l?vitch, P?ter Han?k and others agree that later in the century attitudes towards death changed dramatically, and at a disorienting pace. As hygiene and cleanliness increasingly became bourgeois values, the sight of soiled sheets and the odours of sweat, urine, faeces and gangrene became repugnant, and dying became dirty, revolting and even indecent.19 Flaubert's merciless depiction of Emma Bovary 's death ? in 1856, a portent of an attitude that would solidify by the century's end ? contrasts sharply with the romantic account cited above: [E]lle devenait plus p?le que le drap o? s'enfon?aient ses doigts crisp?s. [...] Des gouttes suintaient sur sa figure bleu?tre [...]. Ses dents claquaient, ses yeux agrandis regardaient vaguement autour d'elle [...]. Peu ? peu ses g?missements furent plus forts. Un hurlement sourd lui ?chappa [...]. Elle ne tarda pas ? vomir du sang. Ses l?vres se serr?rent davantage. Elle avait les membres crisp?s, le corps couvert de taches brunes [...]. Puis elle se mettait ? crier, horriblement. [...] Emma, le menton contre sa poitrine, ouvrait d?mesur?ment les paupi?res; et ses pauvres mains se tra?naient sur les draps, avec ce geste hideux et doux des agonisants qui semblent vouloir d?j? se recouvrir du suaire. [...] Sa poitrine aussit?t se mit ? haleter rapidement. La langue tout enti?re lui sortit hors de la bouche; ses yeux, en roulant, p?lissaient comme deux globes de lampe qui s'?teignent.20 [She became paler than the sheet into which she was digging her clenched fingers. Beads of sweat oozed from her bluish face, her teeth chattered, her wide eyes stared vacuously into space. Little by little her groans became louder. A muffled scream escaped her.

Then she began to scream horribly. Emma, her chin against her chest, opened her eyes very wide, and her poor hands grasped at the sheets with that hideous and pathetic gesture of the dying, who seem to want to wrap themselves already in their shrouds. Her chest began to heave rapidly. Her entire tongue protruded from her mouth; her rolling eyes grew as dim as two lamp globes being extinguished.] Urbanization in the late nineteenth century made life increasingly private. The dead consequently were no longer mourned by the whole community, as they had been for centuries, but only by family and friends.21 The anonymity of the modern metropolis, moreover, inverted the relationship between the dying and these potential mourners. It brought increased intensity and exclusivity to personal relationships, and as an upshot it became imperative to shield terminally ill loved ones from the true gravity of their condition. To this end speaking to the dying about death became taboo. A dying person, of course, was typically cognizant of his or her condition, but was forced to adhere to the taboo, lest he or she be treated as an invalid and obliged to behave like one. As Ari?s points out, dying thus became bound up in a lie: 'The dying person and those around him continue to play a comedy in which "nothing has changed", "life goes on as usual", and "anything is still possible"/22 Tolstoy vividly captured just how alienating this could be in The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886): The worst torment was the lie, this lie that for some reason was accepted by everyone, that he [Ivan] was only sick, and not dying [...]. This lie tormented him. He suffered because no one was willing to admit what everyone, including himself, could see very clearly. He suffered because they lied and forced him to take part in this deception. [...] This lie that degraded the formidable and solemn act of his death [...] had become horribly painful to Ivan Ilyich.23 Where earlier in the century the dying man directed and starred in a beautiful production, by the 18 80s he was divested of such authority, rendered powerless by and captive to an alienating 'comedy*. As Han?k shows, creeping bureaucracy also sapped dignity from death. In the Austro-Hungarian Empire, for example, death had to be certified by qualified personnel before burial could take place, and mourning rituals, funeral rites, burial practices and even cemetery etiquette were increasingly subjected to regulation.24 All of these, moreover, became the commodities of a burgeoning, 21 P?ter Han?k, The Alienation of Death in Budapest and Vienna at the Turn of the Century', in The Garden and the Workshop.

Everything from the decoration of the dead person's house to funeral rites to the grave itself cost money (a lot of money), and such services were aggressively marketed. 'The body was hardly cold', writes Han?k, 'before sales representatives were calling on the bereaved family, and exploiting their sorrow by offering a wide variety of funeral arrangements'.25 Finally, by the 1880s death was becoming 'medicalized'. Doctors, of course, had long tended to the sick. In the late nineteenth century, however, a new scientific outlook came to characterize medical practice, and this fundamentally altered the patient's relationship to illness and death. No longer merely a collection of symptoms, sickness became a clinical 'case' with its own existence and a name. This is significant, for where in earlier times death simply was or was not in nature's course, the patient's destiny now depends on the diagnosis ? there are serious, incurable diseases and mild, treatable ones ? and his or her death is now mediated by the doctor and the technology of medicine.26 As a result of these new attitudes and dynamics, death ? for the first time ever ? became, as Allan Kellehear has put it, 'shameful' and divorced from life itself.27 'Modern urban civilization wrenched death out of the integral entity of daily life', summarizes Han?k. 'Death did not belong any more to the man [...]. Man became deprived of his own personal death.'28 25 Ibid., . . 26 See Ari?s, The Hour of Our Death, pp. 563-65, and Han?k, The Alienation of Death', pp. 103-04. 27 Allan Kellehear, A Social History of Dying (Cambridge, 2007). 28 Han?k, The Alienation of Death', p. 103.</page><page sequence="8">82 Andrew Deruchie These troubling new realities are naively latent in Figure i, an anonymous drawing that appeared in the Wiener Bilder the day before Mahler died in May 1911.29 Though the picture does not dwell on dirtiness or elicit disgust, the dying composer looks haggard, very sick and not the least radiant or sublime. But more revealing is that nobody pays him any attention. His wife Alma holds his hand but stares coldly out of the picture. Otherwise, all eyes are on the doctor, including Mahler's and even the nun's. The doctor, authoritatively occupying the foreground of the drawing, does not pay any attention to his patient either, but instead gazes grimly at a thermometer. Here, not only has death become alienated from the dying man, but it has become utterly de-humanized as a scientific instrument holds Mahler's sad fate. Han?k notes that the Viennese press 'often fulminated against "the outrages of the undertaker-hyenas" and "the depredations of the usurers of death" \3? Prominent intellectual figures were also troubled by the fact that death had become ugly, isolating and alienated from life. Rainer Maria Rilke numbered among the most vehement critics, once writing: 'Il y a de la mort dans la vie et cela m'?tonne qu'on pr?tende l'ignorer' [There is death in life, and it astonishes me that we claim not to know it].31 Elsewhere, he negatively contrasted modern, institutionalized death (Kellehear's 'shameful death') with older times: Jetzt wird in 559 Betten gestorben [at the H?tel-Dieu hospital in Paris]. Nat?rlich fabrikm??ig. Bei so enormer Produktion ist der einzelne Tod nicht so gut ausgef?hrt, aber darauf kommt es auch nicht an. Die Masse macht es. Wer giebt heute noch etwas f?r einen gut ausgearbeiteten Tod? Niemand. [...] Voil? votre mort, monsieur. Man stirbt den Tod, der zu der Krankheit geh?rt, die man hat (denn seit man alle Krankheiten kennt, wei? man auch, da? die verschiedenen letalen Abschl?sse zu den Krankheiten geh?ren und nicht zu den Menschen; und der Kranke hat sozusagen nichts zu tun). [...] Wenn ich nach Hause denke, wo nun niemand mehr ist, dann glaube ich, das mu? fr?her anders gewesen sein. Fr?her wu?te man (oder vielleicht man ahnte es), da? man den Tod in sich hatte wie die Frucht den Kern. [...] Die Frauen hatten ihn im Scho? und die M?nner in der Brust. Den hatte man, und das gab einem eine eigent?mliche W?rde und einen stillen Stolz. [They are dying there in 559 beds. Factory-like, of course. Where production is so enormous an individual death is not so nicely carried out but then that doesn't matter. It is quantity that counts. Who cares anything today for a finely-finished death?

When I think back to my home, where there is nobody left now, I imagine that formerly this must have been otherwise. Formerly one knew (or perhaps one guessed it) that one had one's death within one, as a fruit its kernel. [...] The women had it in their womb and the men in their breast. One had it, and that gave one a singular dignity and a quiet pride.]32 And shortly before Rilke himself succumbed to leukaemia, he further elabor ated his views on the individual's relationship with death: Der Tod ist die uns abgekehrte, von uns unbeschienene Seite des Lebens: wir m?ssen versuchen, das gr??este Bewu?tsein unseres Daseins zu leisten, das in beiden un abgegrenzten Bereichen zu Hause ist, aus beiden unersch?pflich gen?hrt ... Die wahre Lebensgestalt reicht durch beide Gebiete, das Blut des gr??esten Kreislaufs treibt durch beide: es gibt wederein Diesseits noch Jenseits, sondern die gro?e Einheit. [Death is the side of life which is turned away from us, and upon which we shed no light. We must try to widen our consciousness of existence so that it is at home in both spheres, with no dividing-line between them, so that we may draw endless sustenance from both. The true way of life leads through both kingdoms, the great circulation of the blood passes through both: there is neither a here nor a hereafter but a single great unity.]33 Mahler's 'Der Abschied', as we shall see in the remainder of this essay, seeks to reclaim death's lost beauty by articulating something like the 'great unity' Rilke imagined. It does so, as I have suggested, by drawing upon the ancient Chinese thought that had begun to circulate in the German-speaking world. In this respect, the work represents an early episode in an important Viennese, and more broadly Germanic, intellectual movement that would flourish over several decades to come. As the cultural scholar Susanne Kelley has recently shown, in the early twentieth century Viennese artists and writers increasingly responded to the challenges posed by encroaching modernity by seeking 'philosophical answers to fundamental questions of human existence' in what they viewed as the timeless wisdom of ancient China and Japan. Hofmannsthal, for example, turned to Chinese philosophy (primarily in his speeches and essays, though also in certain literary and dramatic works, notably the fragment Die beiden G?tter [The Two Gods]) for both a political model that could unify a fragmented Europe and a set of values that would foster spiritual growth in individuals. And Klimt partook in the crucial project of re-defining gender 32 Rainer Maria Rilke, Die Aufzeichnungen des Malte Laurids Brigge, quoted from Werke.

These included the research of professional sinologists and orientalists, such as Victor von Strau?, Max M?ller and Mahler's friend Friedrich Hirth.35 Among the Viennese population at large, the World's Fair of 1873 had been an important stimulus of interest in East Asia, and from the 1890S newspapers and magazines regularly featured articles on Chinese culture and traditions.36 Around the same time there began to appear a series of translations and paraphrases (Nachdichtungen) of Tang-era Chinese poetry by literary sinophiles and poets, including Otto Julius (Ottju') Bierbaum, Richard Dehmel, Hans Heilmann, Otto Hauser, Klabund (Alfred Henscke) and Bethge.37 There were also periodicals dedicated to chinoiseries, such as the monthly Die Lotosbl?ten [The Lotus Blossom], founded by Franz Hartmann in 1896, which published translations of classic texts and articles on assorted aspects of culture and also familiarized German-speaking readers with important research by pioneering French and British sinologists. Among the branches of Chinese thought that found their way into Viennese consciousness was Taoism, a pillar of Chinese philosophy and religion (both broadly defined) that dates back to the fourth century bc and the writings of Laoz? and Zhu?ngz? (Pinyin Romanization). Early Taoist thinkers valued, among other things, absolute harmony and unity between humans and the natural world. A central problem that they felt compelled to confront, there fore, was the apparent incongruity between the transience of human life and the permanence of nature and the cosmos. The ancient Chinese pursued two solutions. One was alchemy, through which they hoped to extend human life indefinitely. The other (which prevailed when it became clear that alchemical concoctions were in fact killing those upon whom they were supposed to bestow immortality) was philosophical and stemmed from the observation that nature is essentially cyclical. Leaves fall from the trees in the autumn, only to grow anew in the spring. Life and death could be understood as a natural cycle, no different from the seasons, the waxing and waning of the moon, or the rising and setting of the sun: in death, human life was in unity with the earth and the cosmos after all. Taoist thought became an important ideological source for 34 Susanne Kelley, * "Der ungeheure Begriff Asien": China and Japan in Fin-de-Si?cle Literature, Art, and Culture* (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of California at Los Angeles, 2005), p. 98.

A month after his first wife succumbed to complications following childbirth, he wrote to his friend Walther Heinrich: W?re ich nicht ein J?nger des Tao (der einzigen Philosophie, die dem Menschen dieser Zeit etwas zu sagen h?tte: denn es ist eine lebendige Philosophie [...]), ich w?re l?ngst verzweifelt.

Let us now turn to 'Der Abschied', to see how Mahler's finale works through the classical Taoist solution. As Table shows, the piece comprises a series of recitatives and arias, and (following Stephen Hefling and others) may be parsed into two large parts, where Part II (introduced by a substantial funeral march) is a varied reprise of Part I.41 The text (shown in Table 2) is Mahler's conflation and liberal adaptation of two poems, 'In Erwartung des Freundes' [Awaiting the Friend] and 'Der Abschied des Freundes' [The Friend's Farewell], which furnish the texts for Parts I and II respectively.42 These appear on facing pages in Bethge's volume, and their interrelated 'farewell' story-line makes them a natural pair: in the former, the lonely protagonist awaits the arrival of a friend; in the latter, the awaited friend arrives, the final farewell is exchanged and the protagonist departs to await his 'heart's hour'.43 The point where the two poems meet in Mahler's conflation, however, is a moment of striking disjunction. Throughout Part I, the protagonist speaks (sings) in the first person ( feel a soft wind blowing'; stand here and await my friend, I await him for a final farewell', and so on). As the underlinings in Table 2 show, however, the point of view abruptly shifts to the third person at the beginning of Part II: 'He [the awaited friend who now arrives] alighted from his horse and offered him [the protagonist] | the draught of farewell. He [the arriving friend] asked him [the protagonist] where | He was bound and why it had to be'. Mahler's text implies that, halfway through, 'Der Abschied' becomes a narrative, in Carolyn Abbate's restrictive usage of that term (derived from Paul Ricoeur and structuralist narratology as practised by Gerald Genette and others). That is, it becomes a discourse formulated by a narrator, who relates the remainder of the farewell story from a detached and temporally distanced position.44 The implications of this shift command attention: in Part 40 Hamao Fusako has painstakingly traced the genesis of Mahler's texts through their layers of translation and paraphrase back to their eighth-century originals. See Fusako, 'The Sources of the Texts in Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde\ 19th-Century Music, 19 (1995), 83-95. 41 Hefling, Mahler. Das Lied, pp. 88-91. 42 On Mahler's adaptations of Bethge's texts, see Arthur Wenk, 'The Composer as Poet in Das Lied von derErde\ 19th-Century Music, 1 (1977), 33-47, and Mitchell, Songs and Symphonies, pp. 420-25 and passim. The text and English translation in Table 2 are drawn from the widely available 1988 Dover (New York) full-score edition of Das Lied, the punctuation of the German slightly altered to accommodate inconsistencies between score and prefatory text. 43 According to Bethge, these poems were an epistolary exchange between M?ng H?or?n ('In Erwartung des Freundes') and Wang W?i ('Der Abschied des Freundes'). See Hans Bethge, Die chinesische Fl?te (Leipzig, 1926), p. 114. 44 Carolyn Abbate, Unsung Voices.

The music, one might say, no longer emanates from him; the protagonist has become an object, an Other to the narrator, who now treats the protagonist's final farewell and death as a topic. This peculiar structure has spawned a good deal of commentary, most of which attempts to explain it away. Mitchell argues at length that it must be ignored as a manifestation of Mahler's subconscious anxiety over his immanent death that caused him to bungle his conflation of Bethge's poems.45 Danuser insists that the music's formal continuity trumps grammatical disjunction in the text, and Draughon similarly argues that the appearance of a narrating voice is only apparent; she invokes the trope of the 'outside observer', a contrivance Mahler had first employed in a programme for the Second Symphony's scherzo movement, which tells of a lonely figure watching a festive waltz through a ballroom window, deaf to the music.46 These complicated (and in Mitchell's case questionable) arguments reflect high stakes. For if the music no longer emanates from the protagonist in Part II, the cherished notion that the piece's conclusion is a mimetic representation of his ecstatic and triumphant death becomes problematic. Indeed, the abrupt shift to narrative (with its characteristic temporal structure) implies that the protagonist has already died (offstage, so to speak) when the narrator first appears at the beginning of Recitative 3 (see again Tables 1 and 2), an issue to which we shall soon return. In short, if the structure of Mahler's text is read at face value, the hermeneutic core of 'Der Abschied' criticism crumbles. Yet Mahler ultimately gives us no reason not to take the text literally ? especially if we acknowledge that its peculiar structure was of his own, deliberate doing: the beginning of Bethge's 'Der Abschied des Freundes' reads 'Ich stieg vom Pferd und reichte ihm den Trunk | Des Abschieds dar. Ich fragte ihn, wohin I Und auch warum er reisen wolle' [I dismounted and offered him the farewell draught. I enquired of him where ? and indeed why ? he wished to travel]. Had Mahler wanted to retain the first-person perspective of Part I, he could simply have reversed the pronouns. This structure, moreover, is not merely a matter of grammar, but is also projected (pace Danuser) by Mahler's music. The structural voice-leading (the underlying counterpoint that supports the music's surface) in Part I is based on a 5-6 pattern, whereby the fifth of the triad moves up by step to produce a new chord as illustrated in Example 1a.47 This gesture factors substantially in much of Das Lied, but in 'Der Abschied' it derives from the neighbour-note 45 Mitchell, Songs and Symphonies, pp. 370-432 passim; see especially pp. 416-32. 46 Danuser, Gustav Mahler. Das Lied, p. 104; Draughon, 'Mahler and the Music of Fin de-Si?cle Identity', pp. 200-02. For another reading of the structure of Mahler's text, see Wenk, 'The Composer as Poet', pp. 33-47. 47 The 5-6 pattern is also an important contrapuntal device in Mahler's Ninth Symphony; on its role in that work see Christopher Orlo Lewis, Tonal Coherence in Mahler's Ninth Symphony (Ann Arbor, MI, 1984).</page><page sequence="16">Example ib: Neighbour-note motive in Introduction motive prominent at the outset (see Example ib), in which the neighbour notes are sometimes incomplete. The neighbour motive is prominent in recitative (Example ic), and forms the melodic basis of Aria (Example id). As an incom plete neighbour note, it subsequently becomes structural (that is, it passes from the music's surface to a deeper level of underlying counterpoint): as Example ie shows, at the beginning of Aria 2, G, the fifth degree of C, slides up to A, the sixth, to form an A-minor triad, and the same motive quickly converts A minor to F major. Within Aria 2, another 5?6 pattern produces a D-minor triad that launches a cadential progression in C. The relationship between F major and D minor that has been produced through this pattern is subsequently composed out (that is, this local event comes to structure a larger span of music): the conclusion of Aria 2 moves from F major to D minor, with A remaining in the bass. Recitative 2 seems to settle in A minor, but quickly returns to D minor (with A still in the bass); and the composing-out process is completed at the beginning of Aria 3, where the pedal on A resolves to D. D minor then gives way, once again via a 5-6 pattern, to B-flat major, the main key of the aria.</page><page sequence="17">Death, Orientalism and Mahler's 'Der Abschied' Example id: Neighbour-note motive in Aria (bars 30-38)</page><page sequence="18">92 Andrew Deruchie Intro/ R?cit. 1 Aria 1 Aria 2 Recit. 2 Aria 3 27 55 57 81 84 93 101 142 158 166 172 Example ie: Structural voice-leading in Part I The next projected tonal area would be G minor. As Example if shows, a bass pedal on G does appear at the end of Aria 3, but the structural harmony is an E-flat major triad (the subdominant of flat), and the music cuts to the C-minor tonality that initiates Part II without ever centring on G minor. The voice-leading that has underlain the middleground tonal structure of the piece up to this point thus breaks down at the end of Aria 3 ? that is, precisely where the protagonist's voice vanishes. And the ensuing funeral march, the initiating C-minor downbeat which Mahler labelled 'Grabgel?ute' [death knell] in his short score, reveals his fate: the protagonist does not die at the end of the piece (as the received interpretation has it) but before his funeral march. End of Aria 3 Partii 272 281 287 90 95 300 ,46 "?" ?fr+ 2 rv c Example if: end of Aria 3 Mahler's music also projects the appearance of the narrator, who subsequently recounts the protagonist's final farewell, after the fact and in the past tense. As soon as the protagonist's voice vanishes, an entirely new motive (Example 2a) materializes, and this event is conspicuous since the music has been dominated up to this point by a handful of motives that have all been introduced in the opening bars of the piece. As Example 2b shows, the ensuing funeral march is spun out of the new motive, as though this new presence ? the narrator ? were the mourner, the singer of the march. The new motive persists in the highly varied reprise of Aria 1, and material it previously generated here inflects the melody of the voice (compare, for example the cadential tag of Example 2b with Example 2c). In other words, the protagonist's music (that is, the original Aria 1) and the narrator's are here juxtaposed, and this juxtaposition of musical materials parallels the layering of narrative voices in the text: for here the narrator is quoting the protagonist.</page><page sequence="19">Death, Orientalism and Mahler's 'Der Abschied' v.c. v^?, , -rc?-i-;?Is -r 93 Example 2a: New motive (bars 310-11) Example 2b (above): New motive in march melody (bars 326-33 and 337-44) Example 2c (below): New Motive in Rep. of Aria 1 (bars 417-20) 'Der Abschied', to recapitulate, becomes a narrative halfway through; in the process, subject becomes object, and the protagonist's farewell and death become the narrator's topic. The conclusion of the piece takes a further step along this trajectory from drama of to discourse on death. The narrator concludes the farewell story in the reprise of Aria 2, by quoting the prota gonist's final words ('still ist mein Herz', etc.). The scene then dissolves in a wash of whole-tone sonority, out of which emerges the piece's famous climax: the soaring, ecstatic reprise of Aria 3, in the tonic major key. The text here ('Die liebe Erde', etc.) is purely lyrical, and this new discursive register and its contrast with the preceding narrative are reflected and underscored by the new orchestral colour of the music (featuring harps, and then mandolin and celesta) and floating quality lacking metre. The climax of the piece is thus not the climax of the farewell drama and the apotheosis of the subject (as Hefling, Mitchell and others would have it), but the narrator's meditation upon the tale he has just told (or at least completed). In other words, the climax of the piece is the moral of the story, which is none other than the classic Taoist worldview, where in death individual subjectivity is folded into nature's eternal cyclicism: just as spring follows winter, the narrator tells us, the earth blossoms anew after the protagonist's death.</page><page sequence="20">94 Andrew Deruchie It is not only through the words and ecstatic music of the narrator's final meditation that the piece celebrates death as natural beauty, but it also does so by way of a formal process that plays out over its entire span. As Wenk, Mitchell and others have noted, the text of Part I (see again Table 2) swings between more or less neutral descriptions of the protagonist's natural surroundings and his subjective reflections upon them.48 These segments of text correspond to the recitatives and arias respectively. In recitative 1, we hear about the setting sun, the mountainous background and so on. In the aria, the protagonist reflects on nature's beauty: the moon magically becomes a silver boat floating on a heavenly lake. Aria 2, where the sound of the stream becomes music, is a similar meditation on nature's beauty. Recitative 2 reverts to description (the protagonist tells us he awaits his friend amid the spruce trees), while in Aria 3 the protagonist literally proclaims the beauty of his surroundings: 'die Sch?nheit dieses Abends'. Part II maintains and substantially elaborates this rhythm of recitative and aria. Here, the formal labels, 'Reprise of Aria 1' and 'Reprise of Aria 2', are somewhat misleading in that they merely reflect the distribution of material, rather than musical texture as such. Indeed, the reprise of Aria 1, with its fragmentary juxtaposition of material from Aria 1 and the march, is distinctly declamatory and, as Mitchell notes, more closely resembles accompanied recitative than aria.49 The reprise of Aria 2 becomes slightly more songlike, but it is substantially shortened and its most impassioned passages are omitted. Arioso appropriately characterizes its texture. Mahler's procedure in Part II expresses a growth process, from recitative, through the more 'songful' ? but still declamatory ? gradients of accompanied recitative and arioso, which culminates in the dramatic reprise of Aria 3, where a true aria texture finally breaks through. The pairing of speech-like music with primarily neutral, descriptive text and aria with reflection and meditation also persists in Part II. But whereas in Part I the neutral segments of text were the protagonist's descriptions of nature, the neutral, descriptive member of the pair here becomes the narrative of the protagonist's final farewell. This substitution is significant: the structural parallel with Part I has brought the form of the piece to interpret human death as nature in Part II. Yet the sentiment expressed in the ensuing aria remains the same: the narrator finds his story as beautiful as the protagonist found the silvery moon, or the music of the stream. The form of the piece, in short, equates nature with beauty, insists that death is natural and concludes that it, too, is beautiful. Finally, 'Der Abschied' also embodies the Classical Chinese world-view ? which understands life and death as an eternal terrestrial cycle ? at a level that 48 Wenk, 'The Composer as Poet', pp. 41-43; Mitchell, Songs and Symphonies, pp. 370-73, and pp. 370-432 passim. 49 Mitchell, Songs and Symphonies, pp. 401-02.</page><page sequence="21">Death, Orientalism and Mahler's 'Der Abschied' 95 might be called 'programmatic', where the text simply circumscribes a field of meaning for an underlying formal procedure. The growth process we have just observed in Part II also operates in Part I. The opening of'Der Abschied' unfolds a creatio ex nihilo, where a fragmentary cluster of motives gradually coalesces into Recitative i. The process of generation and growth continues as the recitative blossoms into Aria i. And here it reaches its apex: chromaticism invades the C-major tonality, and the aria texture begins to decay, eventually dying away; Mahler marked the final measure of Aria 'morendo' ? into nothing. The process then recommences when the beginning of Aria 2 emerges tentatively from the silence. The texture becomes something like instrumental arioso, as a halting oboe solo sounds against static harmony, before the music flowers into a formally complex aria. Like Aria 1, Aria 2 then decays and dies away into silence, and the whole process ? which has now become a cycle ? begins yet again: Recitative 2 grows into Aria 3, which, like the first two, decays into nothing, and the ensuing march follows suit, emerging from, and retreating into, oblivion. With Recitative 3 the cycle begins yet again. And here again the process reaches an apex (the climactic reprise of Aria 3); a dissonance ? an added sixth ? initiates another disintegration of the texture, which evaporates into the final silence. Such iterative or paratactic formal patterns had become part of the classical and nineteenth-century symphonic vernacular long before Mahler composed 'Der Abschied'. As James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy have shown, 'rotational form' (whereby an ordered succession of thematic material repeats throughout a composition) is an important structuring principle in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries;50 Scott Burnham has elegantly argued that an ongoing rhythm of large-scale upbeats and downbeats is central to Beethoven's heroic-style works (the music builds to great climaxes or grinding impasses, momentarily relaxes and begins to build again);51 and one thinks of the great 'waves' that characterize the music of Bruckner, or certain of Mahler's own earlier works, particularly the first movement of the Fifth Symphony. But the cyclic rhythm we have observed in 'Der Abschied' differs from all of these in both quality and degree. Mahler's 'rotations' involve not themes or motives, but texture ? the material substance of music. And his 'waves' are more fully and consistently contoured than Beethoven's, Bruckner's or those of his own Fifth Symphony: like the moon, the piece's texture gradually waxes to fullness and wanes into nothingness, or like the development of a deciduous tree's foliage over the course of the seasons, it buds, grows, flourishes, dies off and buds again. Ultimately neither the idea of 'rotations' nor that of 'waves' adequately conveys Mahler's practice. 'Der Abschied' embodies ? indeed, its 50 James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy, Elements of Sonata Theory. Norms, Types, and Deformations in the Late-Eighteenth-Century Sonata (New York and Oxford, 2006), pp. 23-26, 47-50 and 60-84. 51 Scott Burnham, Beethoven Hero (Princeton, NJ, 1995).</page><page sequence="22">Andrew Deruchie Example 3: 5-6 Motion at Conclusion (bars 542-73)</page><page sequence="23">Death, Orientalism and Mahler's 'Der Abschied' 97 underlying form-building procedure is ? a perpetual cycle of musical death and regeneration, a cycle that, as we have seen, continues from the piece's start to its finish. Danuser, among others, has expounded at length upon the Open' quality of the conclusion of 'Der Abschied'.52 We might, however, linger on a detail that escapes his attention, which implies that although the piece (of course) ends, this cycle does not. The final sonority, the famous added-sixth chord (shown in Example 3), is particularly ingenious not only because it fuses the two principal keys of Das Lied (A minor and C major) or verticalizes the pentatonic scale, but also because it contains a seed of regeneration. For as the example shows, the 5?6 gesture that generates the harmonic structure of Part I reappears here and implies harmonic growth even as the music is dying into silence. And this gesture of re-beginning projects the cycle of musical death and regeneration ? let's call it The Song of the Earth ? beyond the end of the piece and into the indefinite future. 52 Danuser, Das Lied, pp. 107-11.</page></plain_text>
