<plain_text><page sequence="1">In Search of the New Criticism CLEANTH BROOKS lewis Carroll's snark, the New Criticism is not easy to describe or locate. Even when we feel that it is in our grasp, it usually turns out to be just another boojum. Carroll never told us what either a snark or a boojum was; no more circumstantial was the man who, more or less by accident, gave the New Criticism its name. In 1941 John Crowe Ransom, that marvelous poet and distinguished man of letters, published a book entitled The New Criticism. In it he discussed the critical aims and methods of Yvor Winters as the "logical" critic, T. S. Eliot as the "historical" critic, and Ivor A. Richards as the "psychological" critic. He mentions more briefly R. P. Blackmur, Wil- liam Empson, and a few others. Though Ransom treated all with respect, he put on record his reservations and disagreements. He neither defined an entity called the New Criticism nor did he attempt to promote it. In fact, his last chapter is entitled "Wanted: An Ontological Critic." Clearly, the ontological critic has not yet appeared, unless he was Ransom himself. When did the "New Critic" appear? None of those discussed in Ransom's book has ever called himself such, and my impression is that none of them is usually thought of today as a New Critic, except, just possibly, Empson. I, who am only incidentally mentioned, may be the exception. What in fact occurred is that people who had misread The New Criticism or had never read it at all (had just seen the movie) assumed that Ransom was the primal New Critic and that his former students and friends were the others; and of those few, I am usually chosen as the representative New Critic. It is not an enviable position, and I some- times feel like the man who has drawn the short straw or the child who, in the counting-out ritual, has been denominated "it." As quasi-repre- sentative, one has not only to answer for his own sins, but also to assume responsibility for the collective sins of a vague, undefined group. О CLEANTH BROOKS is Gray Professor of Rhetoric Emeritus at Yale University and the author of a number of books on literary criticism, among them, Modern Poetry and the Tradition and William Faulkner: The Yoknapatawpha Country. 41</page><page sequence="2">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR How did all this come about? Specifically, why did the epithet catch on so quickly? And how could it have done so unless the epithet had, after all, a measure of positive content? The last two questions interlock, and to answer the latter will provide an answer for the former. The one common element that I can discern among those loosely grouped together as New Critics was the special concern they exhibited for the rhetorical structure of the literary text. This emphasis was widely interpreted by traditional scholars and critics as a playing down, if not outright dismissal, of any regard for the author's biography and his place in the culture that nurtured him. It also implied, many felt, a disregard for the reader and the emo- tional impact of a given work on the reader's sensibility. Yet was not the reader's experience the real justification of literature? The charismatic professor who hoped to excite the interest of his class by conveying his own excitement felt that both he and his favorite author had been betrayed. All three critical emphases, let us grant, have their values and uses. Circumstances will determine which is the more pertinent to the case in hand. As far as the traditional emphasis on the writer and his background was concerned, every one of those of us who were tagged as New Critics had experienced such traditional training. Furthermore, all of us were avid readers and rejoiced in the intellectual-emotional experience of reading. Those of us who taught hoped to convey that delight to others. At any rate, rightly or wrongly, readers, and especially teachers, felt themselves threatened by this new phenomenon. The threat needed a name, and the "New Criticism" was there pat to the purpose. It came to stand for those who disparaged a study of the author and his times. I suspect that this bad reputation of the New Criticism was strengthened by the appearance of a little textbook that Robert Penn Warren and I published in 1938. We had planned to call it Reading Poetry, but the publishers insisted on a title that made a stronger claim, Understanding Poetry. Here I must go a little further into personal history. In the early 1930s I and, shortly afterward, Warren became members of the faculty of a rapidly expanding state university in the Deep South. Though we arrived with lively interests in literary criticism, especially that of Eliot, Richards, Ransom, and Santayana - the least of our concerns was to cram the heads of our undergraduates with literary theory. The fact was that we were faced with a practical problem. One of the courses we had to teach was a course designed to introduce students to literature. Our students were bright enough young men and women, but very few of them had the slightest conception of how to read a short story, let alone a poem. 42</page><page sequence="3">THE NEW CRITICISM Out of this urgent problem grew our first textbooks, for the current textbooks simply did not address themselves to the real issues. They printed the text, gave some brief account of the poeťs life, supplied notes for allusions or difficult words, and usually topped it all off with a dollop of impressionistic criticism. The following quotations from two popular textbooks of the 1930s will illustrate what we found useless and sought to replace. The song of the nightingale [in Keats's "Ode"] brings sadness and exhilara- tion to the poet and makes him long to be lifted up and away from the limitations of life. The seventh stanza is particularly beautiful. These lyrics ["Ode to the West Wind" and "To a Skylark"] are characterized by a freshness and spontaneity, beautiful figures of speech in abundance, melody, and an unusually skillful adaptation of the form and movement of the verse to the word and the idea. Their melodiousness is sometimes compared with that of Schubert's music. In lieu of an introduction to Understanding Poetry, we offered a "Letter to the Teacher," in which we stated our purpose as follows: This book has been conceived on the assumption that if poetry is worth teaching at all it is worth teaching as poetry. The temptation to make a substitute for the poem as the object of study is usually overpowering. The substitutes are various, but the most common ones are: 1. Paraphrase of logical and narrative content. 2. Study of biographical and historical materials. 3. Inspirational and didactic interpretation. Of course, paraphrase may be necessary as a preliminary step in the reading of a poem, and a study of the biographical and historical background may do much to clarify interpretation; but these things should be considered as means and not as ends. In the first edition of Understanding Poetry we deliberately left out most (though not all) biographical and historical material, for we were hard pressed for space and we believed that, since the graduate schools of the day taught little else, the average college instructor could and would supply any necessary biographical-historical material. When the outcry came, as it soon did, that we disparaged such helps, in later editions we supplied them in abundance. But it was too late. The dog had been given a bad name that he was never able to shake off. By the 1940s the belief in the anti-historical and anti-biographical bias of the New Criticism had fully developed. In any case, it must have been confirmed by my publication in 1947 of a book entitled The Well Wrought Urn. In it I discussed ten poems of different cultural periods to discover what, if anything, they had in common. The book apparently confirmed the notions generated by Understanding Poetry that the New 43</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR Criticism was fixated on "close reading" through "analyses" of poems, and it took no account of the biographical and historical matrix out of which every poem comes. So "close reading" was taken to be the hallmark of the New Criticism. But closeness is a relative matter: how close is close enough for an adequate appreciation of the work? In determining this matter, one has to take into account the difficulty of the text in question. Obviously, "Twinkle, twinkle, little star" requires less of the reader than Donne's "Goodfriday, 1613. Riding Westward." Another factor that one has to take into account is the ability of a particular reader to handle a particular text. Yet, analysis is not merely a teaching device. Unless two people, disagreeing about th« meaning and value of a particular poem, expect to end their debate in a shouting match, how can they hope to resolve the issue except through patiently showing what each makes of the disputed passages? On an earlier page I stated that a criticism focused on the writer's life and background, a criticism focused on the work that he wrote, and a criticism focused on the reader's response to that work are all legitimate modes of inquiry and are compatible with each other. But I want to add now that they have different degrees of authority when we come to interpret the text. I must, however, caution the present reader that the position I am to set forth is not necessarily that of others who have been labeled New Critics. The position to be outlined is my own, but it is not original. In arriving at it, I have been much aided by the writings of René Wellek and the late W. K. Wimsatt. Neither of these men, by the way, ever declared himself a New Critic. But then, as I have remarked earlier, who ever did? In 1942 Wellek published an essay entitled "The Mode of Existence of a Literary Work of Art." In the course of the essay, he wrote: The view that the genuine poem is to be found in the intentions of an author is widespread even though it is not always explicitly stated. It justifies much historical research and is at the bottom of many arguments in favor of specific interpretations. However, for most works of art we have no evidence to reconstruct the intentions of the author except the finished work itself. Even if we are in possession of contemporary evidence in the form of an explicit profession of intentions, such a profession need not be binding on a modern observer. In 1944 Monroe Beardsley and Wimsatt published an essay entitled "The Intentional Fallacy," followed in 1945 by "The Affective Fallacy." The former, perhaps because of what many considered to be its polemi- cal title, provoked a great deal of hostility. It was regarded as an attempt 44</page><page sequence="5">THE NEW CRITICISM to take the work away from the author, its rightful owner. I remember that one provoked reader called it little less than an act of kidnapping. Beardsley and Wimsatt, making their own approach and adding elaborate illustrations, came to much the same general position as Wellek's. In 1968 Wimsatt returned to the problem with an essay entitled "Genesis: An Argument Resumed." This essay presents his final clarified views on the subject. I recommend it to any reader who is seriously interested in the problem of the author's intentions. Let me try to put the case against "intentionalism" succinctly and in my own terms. The real issue is the evidential value of such intentions as the author has stated them in letters, diaries, and conversations about his work. The issue was never, as is commonly supposed, a denial that the author has any intentions; or the belief that he is "inspired" and, like Plato's Ion, writes in an irrational frenzy; or that what a work means is best left to the critic to say. The writer's conscious intentions and designs for his work do matter, but writers sometimes feel that the work has a direction of its own - an inner drive toward its own proper fulfillment that may resist the author's early plans for the work. The intentions that have evidential value for interpreting the work are those that are actually achieved in the work itself. As Wimsatt puts it in his "Genesis": "The intention [as declared by the author] is always subject to the corroboration of the poem itself." I grant that readers (including even distinguished critics) may fail to recognize fully realized intentions, or may misinterpret them, but so may the author. In a letter commenting on my account of The Waste Land, T. S. Eliot reminded me that he was now, as he looked back on the composition of his poem, simply another reader of it. The author may also sometimes fail to recognize the full import of what he has said in his work. Katherine Anne Porter, in a letter to Warren, wrote that she liked his account (in Understanding Fiction) of her "Old Mortality." But she went on to tell him that he had pointed out symbolism in her story that she was not at all conscious of having put into it. Nevertheless, she was now quite convinced that it was really there. Thus, some of our most distinguished poets and writers of fiction have not blenched at the implications of the position here set forth. D. H. Lawrence, in 1923, went so far as to admonish his readers thus: "Never trust the artist. Trust the tale. The proper function of a critic is to save the tale from the artist who created it." No New Critic ever went that far. In "Genesis" Wimsatt made an interesting and useful distinction between what a literary work can tell us about its author and what the author can tell us about his work. It is legitimate to move from the work back to the author, but not from the author to the work. Wimsatt goes on to choose an extreme case by which to illustrate this point, one in which 45</page><page sequence="6">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR the personality of the author closely resembles the personality of the protagonist of the poem. Now, we know from sound biographical evidence that Thomas Gray was a man of a rather grave, reserved, and even melancholy cast of mind. Such seems also the mind and personality of the pensive man who speaks an "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard." Indeed, writes Wimsatt, his poem "does seem to come out of the historic person Thomas Gray much more directly than many other poems come out of their authors. Nevertheless, the Elegy is not about the historic person Gray. The self-contemplative speaker [of the "Elegy"] remains anony- mous. The poem itself, if it were anonymous, would be intact." I would add that since it would be intact - all of it still there - even though completely detached from its author, it is fair also to call the poem autonomous. The navel string connecting it to its creator has been severed, and it now lives a life of its own. It is more than a mere extension of its author's mind and personality. I believe that I implied such a claim of autonomy not only for Gray's "Elegy" but for the other poems discussed in The Well Wrought Urn. But, of course, I am not using autonomy in any absolute sense. No one would deny that every literary work is the product of language, of history, and of a particular culture. Yet great literary works do seem to transcend the particular culture out of which they came and continue to speak to mankind at large. It would take me too far afield to discuss such interesting items as Elioťs celebrated (and I think badly misunderstood) assertion that poetry is not the expression of a poeťs personality but a "continual extinction of personality," or Richards's conception of the poetry of "inclusion," or Tate's claim that poetry provides the "complete" knowl- edge that science does not provide. Nor can I deal at length with "The Affective Fallacy," except to remark that the real issue in that essay is also that of evidential value - the value of the reader's expression of the ideas and emotions aroused in him by the work in question. Such excitement is natural and proper; but it tells us more about the reader than what he is reading. Even if we value the opinion of someone we regard as a fine critic, we may prefer to know why he likes the work. Although all these concepts have much influenced my own criticism, I am far from sure that they ever became common doctrine. The related concepts of paradox and irony, which occur often in my earlier criticism, did not become common doctrine either. These terms, too, have usually been misunderstood. What I was attempting to get at were rhetorical strategies that seem to me common to all poetry; even the simplest metaphor may be said to involve a paradox. For to assert that A is A ("A rose is a rose," etc.) is no metaphor, but to assert that 46</page><page sequence="7">THE NEW CRITICISM A is В ("My love is a rose") is to find sameness in difference. Irony has its twin in what most people see as its opposite: romantic wonder. Both irony and wonder arise out of a reversal of our expecta- tions. The poet is constantly discovering for us a pattern in what we had taken to be mere confusion, or something exciting in what we had thought banal, or the dark underside of what we had supposed to be innocent and smiling. Yet I am honestly trying to keep this little history of the New Criticism from degenerating into an apologia pro vita mea. I shall return to what I believe is the only common element among the critics I have been discussing: a special emphasis on the literary work as distin- guished from an emphasis on the writer or the reader. I believe that a concrete example will be the most useful way to reveal the relations of these three modes to one another. For the present reader's convenience, I have asked that my discus- sion of the poem be printed in ordinary roman type; that criticism mainly concerned with references to the author, along with the historical references in the poem and all other such discussion, be printed in italics; and that what has to do primarily with reader response, including what I am conscious of as my own more subjective responses, be printed in capitals and small caps. I have included in this last category little ramblings from the text as I follow some special interest. Critics are inclined to do this all the time. With some of our very newest critics it becomes almost a matter of principle. If any reader of this article would prefer to shift the categories a bit here and there, I shall not seriously object. Some contemporary critics will certainly argue that every word of this account should be printed in small caps, since it is wholly subjective, as every piece of criticism, they insist, must be; that, consequently, no "true" reading of any poem is possible, since language is by its very nature empty of all reference to reality. But this is a matter that lies quite outside the bounds of this essay. Channel Firing 47 Thomas Hardy That night your great guns, unawares, Shook all our coffins as we lay, And broke the chancel window-squares, We thought it was the Judgment-day And sat upright. While drearisome Arose the howl of wakened hounds:</page><page sequence="8">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR The mouse let fall the altar-crumb, The worms drew back into the mounds, The glebe cow drooled. Till God called, "No; Iťs gunnery practice out at sea Just as before you went below; The world is as it used to be: "All nations striving strong to make Red war yet redder. Mad as hatters They do no more for Christés sake Than you who are helpless in such matters. "That this is not the judgment-hour For some of them's a blessed thing, For if it were they'd have to scour Hell's floor for so much threatening. . . . "Ha, ha. It will be warmer when I blow the trumpet (if indeed I ever do; for you are men, And rest eternal sorely need)." So down we lay again. "I wonder, Will the world ever saner be," Said one, "than when He sent us under In our indifferent century!" And many a skeleton shook his head. "Instead of preaching forty year," My neighbour Parson Thirdly said, "I wish I had stuck to pipes and beer." Again the guns disturbed the hour, Roaring their readiness to avenge, As far inland as Stourton Tower, And Camelot, and starlit Stonehenge.* The British navy is at gunnery practice in the English Channel, and the sound carries inland past some little church near the coast. Mrs. Florence Hardy, the poet's second wife, has told us that Hardy had in mind a particular place, Stinsford Church, which is located not far from Portsmouth, an English naval base. The noise awakens the dead, some buried centuries before. They think that the Judgment Day has come. It is important to note that the whole poem is spoken by one of these dead men. A popular expression, still current, runs: "The noise was so loud that you would have thought it would wake the dead." So a well-worn expression is, along with the dead men themselves, waked into a grotesque but arresting life. Another threadbare expression comes to life in the description of *The Complete Poems of Thomas Hardy edited by James Gibson (New York: Macmillan, 1978). 48</page><page sequence="9">THE NEW CRITICISM other responses to the noise. We say "as poor as a church mouse," for most churches would yield precious little provender for a creature even so tiny. Hardy's little church evidently does have a resident mouse, one who has managed to find a crumb, but is so frightened that he lets it fall. The vicar of this church is evidently a very low churchman and careless to boot, if bits of the consecrated host lie on the floor. Why all this circumstantial detail about the reactions of the hounds, worms, the mouse, and the glebe cow? The demands of realism, for one thing. If we are to suppose for even a moment that the noise was such that the dead would be aroused, surely the living creatures would be roused. Hardy's anthropomorphic God does not speak in the language of the King James Version. His speech is colloquial and earthy as he voices his irritation at the doings of these incorrigible beings he has created. They are all as "Mad as hatters." Again, a well-worn simile, though most of THOSE WHO USE IT ARE PROBABLY UNAWARE OF HOW IT ORIGINATED. In AN earlier day, those who fashioned felt hats were exposed to mercury, which gave them the jerks and made them appear to be crazy. In Alice in Wonderland, the celebrated tea party includes a hatter and a march hare. hares were reported to go crazy in March, but to tell you why would be to ramble too far from my main subject. Jehovah has plenty of provocation for his anger. Man's propensity to threaten and roar his "readiness to avenge" is a direct usurpation of God's prerogative. In Holy Writ we read: "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord" (Romans, 12:19). In the sixth stanza God finally breaks out in a bitter laugh, "Ha, ha." In the earliest version of the poem (published in The Fortnightly Review for May 1914), God says, "No, no" Having him give a sarcastic laugh instead is a much bolder stroke. "Ha, ha" by the way, does occur in the Bible, but in only one place, and there it does not come from the mouth of Jehovah. It is tempting to speculate on how "Ha, ha" got into Hardy's poem. In Job 39:25 the war-horse "saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting." Did the thunder of the naval guns practicing for battle recall this passage to Hardy? And did he then decide to take the joyous laughter out of the mouth of the war-horse and assign it - though of course with a very different tonality - to Jehovah? However the poet came by it, "Ha, ha" is a great improvement over "No, no." It admirably fits the emerging tone of sarcasm. The idea for the concluding lines of this stanza, I suggest, was borrowed from Jonathan Swift's "The Day of Judgement." The first lines of the poem are spoken by Jove (here, of course, an eighteenth 49</page><page sequence="10">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR century euphemism for the God of the Christians; after all, Swift was an Anglican parson). "The World's mad Business now is o'er And I resent these Pranks no more. I to such Blockheads, set my wit! I damn such Fools? - Go, go, you're bit." The last clause may be translated into colloquial twentieth century American as "Come, come, you've been had.9' But whether or not Hardy is echoing Swift is not of much importance. The matter of great importance in Hardy's poem is the deity's shift from hot anger to pitying contempt. The poet has the dead men take their dismissal calmly. They lie down again, but like little children put to bed, they continue to talk awhile before they resume their everlasting sleep. One of them wonders whether the world will ever improve: apparently the dead man had entertained some vague hope that it might. In the last line of the seventh stanza, "indifferent" may need a gloss. In this context it would seem to mean "neither good nor bad; of neutral quality" (Oxford English Dictionary, 7). In short, the skeleton who speaks here believes that his century was neither better nor worse than any other. In the eighth stanza we are told that "Many a skeleton shook his head," which would seem to be a rather daring enterprise for a skeleton. But if we smile at the notion, it is not, I should think, BECAUSE OF ANY SLIP ON HaRDy's PART. He IS IN COMPLETE CONTROL: THE SKELETONS, SOMEWHAT AMUSINGLY, ARE SHAKING THEIR HEADS CARE- FULLY, ONE WOULD GUESS LIKE ELDER STATESMEN LAMENTING PAST POLICIES NOW REVEALED AS MISTAKEN. In this eighth stanza, the speaker is finally, after a fashion, identified: he is the neighbor of Parson Thirdly, lying in an adjoining grave. Not much of an identification, to be sure, but then, the poet does not want to particularize him. His chosen speaker is anonymous. He is any man, even Everyman. Parson Thirdly' s name is another matter. Professor J. O. Bailey has pointed out that a Parson Thirdly does occur in Hardy's novel Far from the Madding Crowd; but Bailey apparently has been unable to find any person with such a name in the parish records or other records of Dorsetshire, and in view of the thoroughness that he manifests through- out his book, if Prof essor Bailey could not find the name, nobody else is likely to do so. Вит I would think that Bailey has looked in the wrong place. surely, hardy gave his parson so curious a name because Thirdly was the old-fashioned parson who began the exposition of his text with "firstly," followed that up in due time 50</page><page sequence="11">THE NEW CRITICISM with "Secondly," went on to "Thirdly," and so on - ad infinitum, some of his parishioners may well have thought. Thirdly laments what he now considers a misspent life. But his list of sinful delights is a modest one. He does not mourn the fact that he did not lead a dashingly wicked life - no glamorous highwayman, no By- ronic lover. His needs would have been fully served by more tobacco and beer, fewer prayers and sermons. The poem ends as it began with another peal of thunder from the naval guns. But this time we are told that their reverberations carry far past the churchyard, miles inward. Bailey has calculated that Stourton Tower is twenty miles north of Portsmouth Harbor; South Cadbury, which he thinks is the most likely site for Camelot, is twenty-eight miles north of Portsmouth; and Stonehenge, forty-five miles northeast. This is all very interesting and possibly helpful. But for a full appreciation of the poem, it is more important for the reader to note that as the sound of the guns penetrates farther in space, the names of the places to which it penetrates take us back in time, deeper and deeper into British history. Stourton Tower is a memorial to King Alfred's victory over the Danes in 878; Camelot was the capital of the British Prince Arthur in the fifth century; and with Stonehenge, the great monoliths on Salisbury Plain, we have passed beyond the bounds of recorded history. Professor Bailey says that Stourton Tower, Camelot, and Stonehenge "represent civilizations that rose through battle and perished as dynas- ties." But this comment simply will not do. In the first place, it is at odds with history: for instance, what has Stonehenge to do with the rise of a civilization through battle? And how does Alfred fit into this scheme? He was a king who inherited a civilization and defended it successfully against invaders who meant to destroy it. Most of all, Bailey's remark seems at odds with the tone of the concluding stanza. The tone of this last stanza is not frenetic or bitterly satiric or pityingly contemptuous. The present incident is being seen against the backdrop of a remote time. The tone is not indignant or scornful, but brooding and tragic. Man apparently from the dawn of history has been a fighting animal, but some of his wars have been fought for better causes than mere loot, and some have involved noble spirits like the historic Alfred and the possibly fabulous Arthur. The adjective "starlit" makes its own contribution to the sense of grandeur. In choosing the adjective, Hardy may have had in mind the theory that Stonehenge had been designed as a prehistoric celestial observatory. In any case, the stars are associated with the remote and the eternal - entities utterly detached from the quotidian affairs of human- kind. 51</page><page sequence="12">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR Even the metrical variations of this last stanza are used to strengthen the effect of solemnity. Consider the last line. The poet has so cleverly managed matters that the reader has to stress every one of the last five syllables. (Read it aloud and see, or rather hear, for yourself.) Thus Hardy has ensured that in any natural reading the line has a slow and stately movement. Since the entire poem is imagined to have been spoken by the dead man who is Parson Thirdly's "neighbour," we learn, especially from this last stanza, something about what manner of man he was. Clearly, he was a person of imagination and some learning. He impresses me as wise, rather philosophical, and a profound observer of human nature. He may EVEN RESEMBLE AT POINTS HIS LITERARY PROGENITOR, THOMAS HaRDY HIMSELF. One must be grateful to Professor Bailey for having provided so many facts about Hardy and about Hardy's countryside. They are bound to be interesting to anyone who admires Hardy's poetry and fiction. Some of them may be necessary for a full understanding of Hardy's literary work, but biographical and historical facts as such are not to be confused with literary criticism. Even a worthless poem or a fourth-rate novel may generate its own spectrum of biographical and historical facts, facts that may go far to explain how the work came about. But our mastery of these facts will not necessarily change our views of its value as literature. Hardy dated the composition of "Channel Firing" April 1914 - it was published in May- and four months later the firing of the guns in World War I had begun. Did Hardy, then, prophesy the coming on ofthat great war? He has told us that he did not foresee it. What was his attitude toward that war? Evidently much like that of other Englishmen at the time: he was saddened, shocked, especially unhappy that the enemy was the German people, whom he regarded as a race akin to his own. But he wrote a number of war poems. They are not very good as poems go, but they are intensely patriotic and justify the British participation. Let me make it plain that I do not argue from Hardy's subsequent war poems that he repudiated the sentiments expressed in "Channel Fir- ing." Poets write out of different periods of their lives and out of different states of mind. Sometimes, like other men, they radically change their views. My point, however, is different. I argue that the evidence for believing that "Channel Firing" is not a simple anti-war poem is to be found in the poem itself. In order to make the point, one does not have to cite Hardy's subsequent poems defending Britain's entrance into the war. The attitude expressed in "Channel Firing" is complex, not focused on a single issue, not a special pleading for a particular cause. Because "Channel Firing" is more than propaganda for a par- 52</page><page sequence="13">THE NEW CRITICISM TICULAR IDEA, I DOUBT THAT IT HAS EVER BEEN READ BY A PACIFIST AT A PEACE RALLY. God's BITTER OUTBURST, ENDING IN A CONTEMPTUOUS DISMISSAL OF MANKIND, SCARCELY COMPORTS WITH A CALL TO PROTEST AGAINST OR TO RESIST THE WARLORDS. NOR DOES THE CONCLUDING STANZA, THE NOTE OF WHICH IS TRAGIC AS IF ONE WERE DEALING WITH PERMANENT AND IRREMEDIABLE THINGS. Yet what should the reader make of this fascinating poem? Even those of us who believe we have the answer will be chary of forcing it on the reader. For one thing, forcing will do no good. The reader will ultimately make his own judgment. Each reader will have to make up his own mind, but he might properly be asked at least to read the work with due attention; to consider the meanings of the words themselves; to treat the figurative language as also meaningful, not merely as idle embellishment; to note the tone established or modulated and shifted; and to consider that even the rhythms may support the total effect. Such, in sum, seems to me to be the burden of what the badly named New Critics have said. In that case, they would appear to be in fact not new at all, but among the most old- fashioned and practical critics that we have. 53</page></plain_text>
