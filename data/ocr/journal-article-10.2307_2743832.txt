By D. L. Cheney and R. M. Seyfarth. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990. 377 PP. $24.95 Cheney and Seyfarth's provocative subtitle, Inside the Mind of Another Species, has an almost 19th-century ring to it. The immediately post-Darwinian fascination with the possibility of such insights contrasts starkly with the attitude that came to dominate the behavioural sciences of the 20th century: that "mind" was not a proper object of scientific study. In recent years, "mind" has surfaced increasingly in the titles of new books, whether about humans or non-humans. How Monkeys See the World not only grapples with questions about other species' minds but devotes its longest chapter to evidence for monkeys' attribution of mental states to other monkeys. The way in which this is tackled, how- ever, is very far from that of the 19th century. Questions about animal mentality are here approached with the methodological sophistication imposed by the same critical onslaught that has held "mind" at arm's length in deference to one or another brand of behaviourism. Cheney and Seyfarth are well aware of the pitfalls of anthropomorphism and the parallel difficulties familiar to social anthropologists of translating the meanings of a communication system and society radically different to one's own. The result is an object lesson in how deep questions about minds possibly quite different to our own can be imaginatively and rigorously addressed. Dealing as it does with such fundamental issues as the evolution of mind, communicative meaning, mental attribution, and social knowledge, the book will be es- sential reading not only for biological and social anthro- pologists but also for psychologists, cognitive scientists, philosophers, and ethologists. Many scholars from these disciplines have already recognised the importance of developments in this branch of primatology, and several have become active in what is becoming a fertile area for cross-disciplinary exchange. The key developments in this line of research go back little more than a decade, to essays written by Alison Jolly (1966) and by Nicholas Humphrey (1976). In a nutshell, what they argued was that the evolution of primate intelligence has been shaped not by physical or technical selective forces but by the need to outmanoeuver competitors mentally in societies of unusual social complexity. Monkeys and apes, in other words, have evolved what Richard Byrne and I have called "Machiavellian intelligence." In the 1980s this and subsidiary hypotheses drove a growing body of empirical research on the social expertise of pri- mates. Cheney and Seyfarth have consistently been in the vanguard of this work, and major chapters in their book are devoted to its subcomponents, including deception, attribution (of mental states to others), and social versus non-social intelligence. Virtually all of the empirical findings presented on these topics have been published elsewhere, but even readers familiar with them will wel- come the integrative account. The authors leave few stones unturned in spelling out the implications of these findings for fundamental issues in sister disciplines. In- deed, one of the few very general criticisms I have of this book is that it tends to be overly didactic. To finish each chapter with a summary is fine, but some of these key conclusions are repeated in later chapters and then summarised in the final chapter and yet again in the summary of this summary chapter! To be more charita- ble, those of us who do research in this area know all too well that even repeated underlining of just what is being claimed for primate mentality may be misunder- stood. Cheney and Seyfarth obviously believe that one cannot be too careful. In the opening chapter, they set out their "modest" goals: "to document what monkeys seem to know, what they can do with this knowledge, and why they need this knowledge." How these aims relate to the history of the subject and to related preoccupations in philosophy, ethology, psychology, and anthropology is invitingly ex- plained. The following two chapters describe social behaviour and social knowledge in the vervet monkeys that the authors have studied in Kenya for over a decade. The first of these thus offers an ethologist's understanding of monkey society; the second aims at uncovering the monkeys' own understanding of their society and whether they carve it mentally at the same joints per- ceived by the ethologists. To test the latter, quantitative observations have been supplemented with an experi- mental method that the authors have used to great effect-playing back recorded monkey vocalisations from hidden loudspeakers in specified contexts. It was in one of the earliest of these experiments, in which infants' calls were played back, that an important fea- ture of monkeys' social knowledge first emerged: not only did a mother recognise her own infant's call, as expected, but also other mothers turned expectantly to watch her. Monkeys appear to know, then, not only about the status of their own relationships but about relationships between others. Cheney and Seyfarth pre- sent and review more recent data that lead them to con- clude that monkeys classify relationships between oth- ers according to abstract properties reflecting those used</page><page sequence="2">504 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY by ethologists, notably relative affiliation and domi- nance. The next two chapters tum to communication, partic- ularly vocalisations, and here the playback technique is used to probe the extent to which "vervetese" shares characteristics traditionally considered hallmarks of hu- man oral communication, particularly intentionality, meaning, and the importance of learning. Monkeys' vo- calisations certainly are not simply involuntary, inflex- ible expressions of emotional states. Already quite widely known are the authors' playback experiments showing that the different alarm calls given on sighting different predators (eagle, leopard, snake) carry sufficient information to allow others to take the appropriate eva- sive action. They do not appear to express different lev- els of fear but rather can be said to express meaning to the extent that each "refers to, or denotes, a particular type of predator." However, as the authors appreciate, this is far from saying that the leopard call means "leop- ard" to the vervet. In more recent experiments, this deeper level of mean- ing has been stalked by playing back a certain call re- peatedly in the wrong context so that hearers come to ignore it: the question then becomes whether habitua- tion will transfer to other calls that are physically differ- ent but to the observer appear to serve roughly the same function or have similar meaning. The answer is that, under certain circumstances, it does. Having become ha- bituated to a particular call (a "chutter") that is given on sighting another group, a vervet will tend also to ignore another quite different vocalisation (a trill) that is nor- mally used in the same context if it is given by the same individual. By contrast, it will not ignore calls of that individual that denote other referents, such as eagles. These experiments are not easy to conduct under field conditions, as a few wry comments by the authors sug- gest, and they have uncovered unsuspected layers of complexity and sophistication in monkey communica- tion systems. So far, however, they have not succeeded in isolating "meaning" to the same degree as the ape sign-language projects in which apes have proved able to sort plastic chips denoting particular objects (e.g., apple, wrench, hammer, orange) into classes such as "fruit" and "tools." It is unfortunate that these two lines of enquiry are not directly comparable-there are no mon- key sign-language projects, and nothing approaching the programme of vervet field experiments has been at- tempted for apes: otherwise, the convergence of findings would be powerful. In fact there is growing evidence that ape and monkey minds differ, and this is something which is discussed increasingly as Cheney and Seyfarth move on to chapters on deception and attribution of mental states. Chimpanzees seem to be offering evi- dence of superiority over the vervets in both respects. Most of the chapter on deception is concerned with spontaneous and often isolated episodes of deceit in monkeys and apes. A large class of these involves just the withholding of information, but cases of active falsi- fication are also described. The anecdotal nature of much of this type of evidence may be part of the phe- nomenon itself; given the intimacy and social alertness of anthropoid society, deceptive acts would not be ex- pected to be clumsily repeated or even commonplace. What impresses Cheney and Seyfarth, along with many field primatologists, is the number and variety of care- fully documented observations that can now be as- sembled. The big question remains the extent to which this behaviour involves intent to mislead, and this leads on to the chapter on attribution-whether monkeys are be- haviourists or mentalists. This is the most comprehen- sive review to date of the question of primate mind read- ing, and it incorporates the authors' pioneering attempts to test for monkey mind reading experimentally. Pre- mack and Woodruff's (I978) landmark contribution sug- gested that the chimpanzee has a theory of mind. Al- though it continues to be controversial, more recent experiments have lent some support to this conclusion. Ape mind-reading experiments have used human minds as the candidates to be read. In their experiments with vervet and macaque monkeys, Cheney and Seyfarth have opted for the technically more difficult paradigm in which both the potential mind reader and the object of its mind reading are monkeys. The results so far are basically negative: monkeys do not have a theory of mind. Cheney and Seyfarth are quick to emphasise that these results must be treated as tentative, as must the evidence that apes can do what monkeys cannot. It is always easy to offer justifications for a few negative re- sults: moreover, in one of the two principal experiments the results were ambiguous, with some supporting and some failing to support the existence of an ability to distinguish knowledge from ignorance in other mon- keys. The authors tend to dismiss the positive evidence here, suggesting that it could have been based upon ob- servations of behaviour. This is odd in that it seems to imply that this experiment was not able to discriminate mentalism from behaviourism in the first place. I feel that Cheney and Seyfarth may also have set their sights too high in pursuing the attribution of knowledge. Hu- man children are progressively able to attribute "deeper" mental states to others, and identification of epistemic states such as knowledge and (even more difficult) false belief is mastered quite late compared with identifica- tion of seeing, wanting, and intending. These latter may be more profitable objects of mind reading to investigate in monkeys. Attribution of knowledge is the highest level claimed by other researchers for chimpanzees. The evidence discussed by Cheney and Seyfarth is not limited to their experiments. It ranges over other obser-. vational and experimental evidence on informing others, deception, teaching, imitation, compassion, empathy, and self-awareness as possible indicators of a theory of mind. Even amongst primatologists, there will be few who will not learn something new here. The final substantive chapter addresses primates' so- cial and non-social intelligence. One variant of the hy- pothesis of social intelligence takes intelligence as some rather general ability and considers it to have been se-</page><page sequence="3">Volume 32, Number 4, August-October I99I1 1505 lected for particularly strongly by the complexity of anthropoid society rather than by aspects of physical ecology. Recent evidence in favour of this includes en- cephalisation's being more strongly correlated with sim- ple measures of sociality than with ecology. Another variant, the one that Cheney and Seyfarth tackle, seems to take a further evolutionary step to propose that under such selection pressures intelligence, or at least part of it, might take a form suited to dealing with social inter- action. Humphrey (I976) once suggested that local cog- nitive maladaptations might be the end result, citing, for example, the way in which we try to deal with physical difficulties by (inappropriately) personalising them. Cheney and Seyfarth note increasing evidence for domain-specific cognitive "modules" in studies of both animal and human cognition. Most of the data they dis- cuss are in fact about the extent of social versus non- social knowledge. Thus, they report that their vervets show surprise when the call of a specific neighbouring vervet is played from the "wrong" location but not when hippo calls are played from "wrong" (i.e., dry) locations. Of course, this distinction is really not very relevant to the monkeys, so it might be objected that the interesting social/non-social comparisons have yet to be made-for example, with the non-social being some aspect of food distribution. In fact, experiments were undertaken with highly relevant phenomena-signs indicative of the proximity of predators, such as python tracks and ante- lope carcases in trees-and, although it is difficult to make truly "matched" comparisons of social and non- social in this way, the vervet's lack of acumen with re- spect to these signs, compared with their knowledge about social relationships, is striking. In sum, this book thoughtfully examines an impres- sive research programme that advances the study of pri- mates' social cognition on several fronts. Many specific results and interpretations are debatable; one or two of these have been mentioned here. Indeed, the authors themselves are fairly zealous in enumerating the reasons certain results must be taken as tentative, and this, to- gether with variations in the recurrent summaries, may leave the reader wondering precisely what conclusions have finally been arrived at. Thus, for example, we have "monkeys seem unable to attribute mental states to oth- ers" (P. 3I2), "the ability to attribute mental states to each other is limited" (P. 300), and "chimpanzees do indeed seem more skilled than monkeys at attributing states of mind to others" (p. 252). The last two state- ments seem to hint that monkeys might perhaps mind read a bit! But, if so, what does this mean? "Inside the mind of another species" is, then, perhaps yet too confi- dent a claim, but Cheney and Seyfarth have shown us several ways in which to get one's foot in the door.
