<plain_text><page sequence="1">69 IS PLATO'S REPUBLIC A THEOCRACY ? Professor Popper's argument in his Open Society1 that Plato's 'poisonous writing '2 was ' political propaganda ',3 and that what Plato wanted was a state 'based on the most rigid class distinctions '4 and capable of 'keeping down its human sheep or its human cattle 5 has not, on the whole, been favourably received, and in particular has received very just criticism from Dr. G. J. de Vries.6 The very different suggestion that I have to offer- one much more in keeping with the traditional interpretation-is that the state described in the Republic approximates to a theocracy. A theocracy, we may say, is a state wherein the sanction of all law lies not in any man-made code, or even in the will or opinions of one or more human rulers, but in absolute standards revealed to man by divine agency, so that in theory at least the real ruler of the community is the divine agency that sets the standards, while the earthly 'rulers' are in the nature of High Priests whose task is to interpret and enforce them. The exact nature of the divine agency concerned is irrelevant to the definition; what matters is that the ultimate author of all law, whether written or unwritten, be said to be divine. Such was the case, of course, with the Jewish community at the time of Moses. We may now turn to Plato. It is evident, to begin with, that philosophy meant far more to Plato than it means to us-that for him it included much of what we should call religion; the 'defence ' passage of the Phaedo and the latter part of the Gorgias are alone sufficient to make this plain. Bearing this in mind, let us consider certain features of the Republic: (a) The sanction of the directions that the Guardians give is not mere class-prerogative, but the Good Itself; and the Good is not only their sanc- tion, but also their source. We need not here concern ourselves with the question whether the 'God' of the Republic is the Good, or Mind, or an indeterminate notion. In any case, it is clear that the Guardians are merely an executive : the legislative, so to speak, is the Good Itself, and they merely carry out its requirements. The Good is not merely a subjective notion, but an independently-existing, substantial reality that is the sanction of all knowledge and all being, as well as of moral values. In this way the Good, if not itself God,7 at any rate plays the part that the God of a theo- 1The Open Society and its Enemies, vol.

Levinson, In Defence of Plato, Harvard, 1953. 7It is perhaps worth pointing out that while Ross, for example (Plato's Theory of Ideas, p. 235), objects to the identification of the Good with God on the ground that</page><page sequence="2">70 R. S. BLUCK cracy does, and the Guardians correspond to the High Priests. 'They (i.e. the Guardians) must lift up the eye of the soul to gaze on that which sheds light on all things; and when they have seen the Good itself, take it as a pattern for the right ordering of the state and of the individual, themselves included.'8 (b) The Guardians' motive in promulgating what they divine to be in accordance with the Good is not self-interest (and there is no need to dis- believe Plato here); they do so under the constraint of fair-mindedness,9 'for their country's sake, not regarding it as a distinction, but as an un- avoidable task '10-through desire, in fact, to help other individuals and the State as a whole to spiritual betterment through conformity. (c) The enlightenment of the Guardians by the Good is spoken of in a way which suggests a beatific vision. The Good is the ' supreme splendour ' which, according to the Republic, irradiates all knowable reality, as the sun irradiates the objects of sense. The description of the ascent to the Beautiful in the Symposium, and of the realm of Forms in the Phaedrus, is again written in a deeply religious tone. (d) Though the Good may be described in terms of its image or 'off- spring', the sun, the Good itself is ineffable. (This is insisted upon again in the 'philosophical digression ' of the Seventh Letter.) This again suggests the religious vision of the High Priest or saint. A Christian can describe his beliefs, but not transmit by language his religious conviction. 'To one ', it has been said,1 ' who has never had " anything like " a direct experience of God, talk of it is as meaningful as the talk of proud mothers is to an adolescent'. But in Plato's view, of course, intellectual as well as moral training was necessary for the vision. (e) Although questions of ritual are left to Delphi,l2 the Guardians pronounce on what is right and what is wrong and make regulations as need arises; they are the arbiters in matters of moral education, taking upon themselves, because of their inspired knowledge, the duties normally left to parents ; and they are to act as censors in moral and religious matters such as questions of profanation in poetry. All that matters in religion, in fact, is in their hands. (f) Professor Popper speaksl3 of the Guardians as being 'not like other 'an Idea is a nature, not a being having a nature', Protag. 330 C sq. and Phaedo 100 C (' if there is anything else beautiful, besides the Beautiful itself . .') suggest, on the contrary, that a Platonic Form does have a nature. Cf. Jaeger, Paideia ii, p. 286. Prof. Hackforth has suggested (CR, Dec. 1948) that the conceptions of God and the Good may depend, respectively, upon 'the religious and the philosophical way of formulating the relation of the temporal to the eternal, the individual to the universe ' 8Rep. 540 A. 9520 E. The philosopher-Guardian who, 'in constant companionship with the divine order of the world, will reproduce that order in his soul, and, as far as may be, become godlike' (500 D), will at death depart to the Islands of the Blest. Such men 'the State will . . . honour as divinities . . . or at least as men blest with a godlike spirit ' (540 B-C). 10540 B (trans. Cornford). 1By P. A.

They belong to another world, they communicate with the divine. Thus the philosopher king seems to be, partly, a copy of a tribal priest-king '. In a note Dr. Popper refers to Timaeus 24 A, where an Egyptian is describing the division of labour in Egypt, and the rule of the priests, who 'take the place of the " philosophic race " of the Republic '. If we reject Dr. Popper's view that Plato's motives in prescribing a philosophical education for the rulers are 'purely political ', may we not take these indications at their face value, and admit that Plato's Guardians were indeed to be a kind of priests-not charlatans, but truly wise men fulfilling the role of the High Priests of a theocracy ? (g) At 389 B and 459 C, where it is said that the Guardians may use a kind of deception to bring about conformity with their vision of the ideal, and to ' produce such counterparts of temperance, justice and all the virtues as can exist in the ordinary man', their practice is likened to that of a physician administering medicine. Here again, if we refrain from speaking, with Popper, of 'medicine-men ',14 may we not believe that the Guardians are intended to be, through divine revelation, physicians of the soul ? Else- where15 Plato uses the image of an artist painting from a divine model, and clearly the point of the analogy is the divine inspiration. If the Guardians are comparable to the High Priests of a theocracy, then we can hardly accuse Plato of reaction, or of seeking the interests of one class to the exclusion of those of the rest of the population. If Plato has little to say in the Republic about the 'toiling masses ', that is not because he arrogantly despised them, but because their salvation, too, depended on the regime of philosopher-Guardians, and he wishes here to concentrate on that. So far from disregarding the masses, the Guardians will 'watch over and care for the other citizens ',16 and promote their happi- ness17; and if they are to impose allegorical stories and other 'medicine upon them in order to promote conformity to the divine scheme, the sole purpose will be to 'keep our flock at the highest pitch of excellence '.18 Virtue is Knowledge-knowledge of a spiritual kind; and if direct insight can be attained by only a few, it is incumbent on those few to help the rest as best they can: 'it is better for everyone to be governed by the divine and intelligent, preferably indwelling and his own, but in default of that imposed from without, in order that we all so far as possible may be akin and friendly because our governance and guidance are the same '.19 From this point of view a change in the regime would of course be undesirable, not for any insidious partisan reason, but for the sake of the moral and religious welfare of the community. Nor cap we, with Popper, blame Plato for not advocating egalitarianism; you cannot, in the nature of things, have an egalitarian theocracy. 14p. 130. 15500 E, cf. 540 A. 16520 A-B. 17420 B sq. ls459 D-E. 19590 D (trans.

BLUCK We may believe that the practical working out of such a scheme as that which Plato describes is beyond the capacity of human nature, that the Inquisition (or even the Calvinist Republic of Geneva) shows that power will corrupt. Plato thought so too : but that was no reason why he should refrain from depicting, for other purposes, his conception of the ideal.20 Lastly I must deal with a possible objection to the view that I have put forward. It is of course true that many Greeks, and particularly per- haps Athenians, believed that all laws were in a sense divine, and Mr. M. B. Foster, in an article ' On Plato's Conception of Justice in the Repub- lic ',21 has argued that Plato, while not perhaps believing in the gods of the Greek pantheon, nevertheless held the same view about the laws, because in contending that laws exist 'by nature ' he must have understood nature as divine: 'he had outgrown Greek polytheism, but not Greek nature- worship .22 If that were the end of the matter, there would be no more ground for calling the Republic polity a theocracy than for calling Athens itself one; but I do not think it is. Mr. Foster's article, valuable as it is, seems to contain a flaw at the start. Mr. Foster begins by assuming that the Republic sets out to prove 'that it pays a man to be just, i.e. to obey the laws of the state '.23 He finds this not proved by the proof at the end of Book iv that the man who has 'justice in the soul' is happy, and argues that 'since justice in the soul is by definition that order in the soul which man is designed by nature to have, it is almost a tautology to say that the soul which has this order will be happy. The thing which it is important to prove is something differ- ent, namely that the man who obeys the laws of the state attains by this obedience the right order in his soul, and therefore happiness .24 So far as the actual (as opposed to the ideal) state is concerned, he finds the solution to this contained in the description of the growth of the state at 369 A sq. : that growth is a natural development-and in Plato's view, according to Foster, nature is divine. Therefore, we have apparently to infer, conformity to the laws must bring happiness. But does Plato set out to prove that obeying the laws of the state brings happiness ? It is astonishing, if that is the case, that he should go on to argue, as Foster later admits,25 that all existing states are more or less corrupt, for in so far as they are corrupt the ground of obligation is presumably absent. And is justice really 'by definition' having the right order in the soul? Surely one of the main objects (if not the main object) of the Republic as a whole is to show that that is what constitutes justice in the individual, and that that is what makes for happiness; and the fact that it differs from 'conforming to the 20472 D. 21Phil.

Mr. Foster has to concede too many hostages for his thesis to be con- vincing as a complete account of the matter. To those who regard Plato's polity as totalitarian, he concedes that 420 B-421 C (the state compared to a work of art) and 462 A-C (the unity of the state conceived on the analogy of an organism) 'seem to be incompatible' with his interpretation. They are explained as 'an inconsistency in Plato himself '.26 Later, he admits that 500 E (the artist working on the state after the divine pattern) suggests that 'the scientist (or philosopher) has access by knowledge to an order of the natural universe which transcends the temporal order both in reality and in divinity'. This passage he admits is 'perhaps not wholly consistent ' with the idea, which he also finds in Plato, of a philosopher restoring the (divine) nature of a state that has become perverted27; and on Foster's view that the state itself has a divine nature, and that the justice of the state is ' an order internal to the state itself', this transcendental ' order of the universe' would indeed seem to be superfluous. (Even this passage Foster declares 'reflects the prevalent political faith of Greece. The Greek cities commonly attributed their constitutions to a legislator who either was himself semi-divine or acted under divine inspiration'. But this is very different from the idea of Guardians who are constantly in touch with the divine scheme, and speak and act always under divine inspiration.) Finally, Foster concedes that at 351 B (an aggressive state is necessarily unjust) ' Plato speaks of a state's justice as being exhibited in its conformity to a supra-national order '.28 These inconsistencies that Mr. Foster is forced to assume in Plato on his interpretation of the Republic disappear, I submit, on mine. The authori- tarianism of the first two passages and the 'transcendentalism' of the others is explicable if we recognize that Plato has in mind something more than the ordinary Greek view of the divinity of law, and something more than the 'political obedience of the actual Greek citizen '. In Plato's view the ideal state should acknowledge a divine force external to itself not only as the sanction of its laws, but also as the ever-present guide to inter- pretation of them, and its Guardians, having constant reference to it, should put these into effect: it should be, in fact, a theocracy.29 R. S. BLUCK Queen Mary College, London. 26p. 207. 27pp. 215-6. 28pp. 214-5. 29The fact that Plato does not directly speak of the Good as King may be due to a desire not to speak in anthropomorphic fashion (as I have inevitably done in admitting the use of the word 'guide '), or even to anxiety to avoid openly introducing a new deity. But we do read at 597 E of 'the King and the truth', and at Ep.II 312 E (if that be genuine) of ' the King of all '; and at Phil. 28 C of Reason as ' King of heaven and earth'. Nevertheless I would not claim that Plato himself must have recognized the position that he assigned to the Good as akin to that of a king-only that it was, and that we may recognize the fact,</page></plain_text>
