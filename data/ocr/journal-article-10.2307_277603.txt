<plain_text><page sequence="1">A PRELIMINARY STUDY OF SPACE AND TIME PERSPECTIVE IN NORTHERN COLOMBIA GERARDO REICHEL-DOLMATOFFW ALTHOUGH THE Republic of Colombia occupies a large area in northwestern South America and its geographical position makes it an important link between the basic components of nuclear America, our knowl- edge of Colombia's prehistoric cultures is still very scanty and sporadic. Practically no serious attempts have been made toward correlating its many different cultural manifestations in terms of temporal development or spatial dis- tribution. This has been due mainly to the lack of organized scientific archaeology and to * The author wishes to express his sincere gratitude to Dr. Irving Rouse of the Peabody Museum, Yale University for his valuable suggestions in preparing this paper. the romantic orientation most research had taken in Colombia, where archaeologists have concentrated upon the more spectacular cere- monial sites while ignoring almost completely the problems of chronology and cultural inter- relations. The considerable advance made during the last decade in the field of Venezuelan and Antillean archaeology, together with the many unsolved problems posed by Meso-American and South American relationships, has pressed the need for the establishment of an adequate chronological framework for the archaeological cultures of the north Colombian lowlands. The archaeological history of this area should be of great significance for the understanding of FIG. 93. Archaeological areas in northern Colombia. 352</page><page sequence="2">SPACE AND TIME PERSPECTIVE IN COLOMBIA cultural developments and relations, not only within the circum-Caribbean area but also in the neighboring regions. In recent years the writer has had the oppor- tunity of making a survey of the northern provinces of Colombia bordering the Caribbean seaboard and of investigating in some detail a number of archaeological sites, principally in the Department of Magdalena. This research has led to the tentative establishment of a general temporal framework. The present pa- per is intended to give a summary of the arch- aeological areas and cultural sequences as they have been postulated to date. It is necessary to state, however, that this research is still in its initial stages and that the validity of the provisional framework suggested here will nec- essarily have to be substantiated and the frame- work revised as field research advances. With the exception of J. Alden Mason's (1931, 1936, 1939) extensive field work in the Tairona area in 1922-23, no systematic archae- ological research had been accomplished in the Department of Magdalena nor in any other region of the Atlantic coast previous to 1946, when the writer and his wife began a survey followed by a series of excavations in selected sites (Reichel-Dolmatoff, 1951). Since 1950 this program has been continued in part by a small group of other Colombian archaeologists stationed in Barranquilla and Santa Marta. So far, the results of these investigations have been rather promising and have given an en- tirely new orientation to Colombian archaeol- ogy in general. Geographically the Department of Magda- lena can be subdivided into four major regions (Fig. 93): the arid coastal strip which extends west of the Guajira Peninsula, covering the flat country bordering the lower Rancheria River and parts of the coast to the south and east of the town of Santa Marta; the Sierra Nevada de, Santa Marta, an isolated mountain mass which occupies most of the northern portion of the Department; the semiaquatic and slight- ly undulating lowlands to the south af the Sierra Nevada, neighboring the Magdalena River and its tributary, the Cesar; and the western slopes of the Sierra de Perija, which in this part of the country forms the northern- most tip of the Andean system. All four re- gions are sharply differentiated by physio- graphic and climatic factors, offering habitats with distinctive ecological conditions which range from the sandy deserts of the Guajira Peninsula to the snow-capped peaks of the Sierra Nevada and the tropical jungle belt which surrounds the base of the Sierra. A con- siderable number of additional distinctive fea- tures might justify further subdivision into minor regions, but for the purpose of our cul- tural outline the four-fold division stated above can be considered fairly adequate. On the basis of the archaeological remains observed in the course of our investigations, we have come to distinguish five archaeological areas, which correspond in a certain degree to the geographical regions of Figure 93. These areas are: Rancheria River, Cesar River, Lower Magdalena River, Sierra Nevada, and Littoral. In the following pages I shall discuss briefly these areas, their cultural characteristics, time perspective, spatial aspects, and possible rela- tionships. Rancheria River. This area covers the flat and arid country of the Rancheria River, be- tween the northeastern foothills of the Sierra Nevada, the deserts of the Guajira Peninsula, and the western slopes of the Sierra de Perija. Our cultural material comes from 22 of the 36 open sites which we visited. Altogether, we dug 7 stratigraphic test trenches and made 18 surface collections. The total of sherds alone amounts to some 80,000. All trenches were dug in midden sites or other accumula- tions of occupational debris, none of them deeper than about 2 meters; in three of the trenches a stratification of occupational levels was observed. Chronological sequences were defined by superposition and, in some cases, by typological comparisons. To designate the sequences in this and other areas, the names of type sites have been used (Reichel-Dolmatoff and Dussan de Reichel, 1951). The earliest time level has been termed the Loma period. It is characterized by polychrome pottery and incised, smoked blackware, the outstanding decorative feature of which is the sigmoid scroll. There is also a white-slipped, rather coarse ware decorated with black or red designs similar to those observed in the poly- chrome ware. Culinary sherds are of a coarse brownish type. There is a considerable variety of rim forms, although vessel shapes seem to have been rather standardized. Annular bases and handles are absent. We obtained only a few nonceramic artifacts, such as fragments REICHEL-DOLMATOFF ] 353</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Fr., 94.

Overlying this culture is that of the Horno period, which has been subdivided into two developmental phases on typological grounds. The Horno period shows a further develop- ment of the Loma tradition, with a certain shift of emphasis from polychrome to bichrome types and new developments in the decorative features of the blackware. All types corre- spond closely to Loma wares, although the white-slipped type is missing here. In the upper levels the polychrome ware fades out while a new redware emerges from the basic culinary type. Annular bases and vertical strap handles are frequent in the upper levels. There is a great variety in rim types and consider- able experimenting in modeled decoration. Small female clay figurines, which were al- ready present during Loma times, develop fully in the Horno levels, which also contain a greater amount of nonceramic artifacts, such as small slate pendants, shell beads, and pot- tery discs. No burials were observed. As in the Loma period, the wide extension and thick- ness of the refuse deposits seem to indicate permanent settlements. While the Loma com- ponent is represented mainly by the type site, the Horno period is known from at least half a dozen sites spread over a considerable part of the valley. After the Horno period there seems to be a considerable cleavage between horizons. For typological reasons the writer is inclined to believe that this gap was at least partially filled by the Cocos period, represented in the Ran- cheria area only by the type site but probably forming a broader transitional development. It is difficult to place the Cocos site satisfactorily in the sequence but certain ceramic similarities lead us to assume that it represents a develop- ment from the Horno period. A new white- slipped ware with black parallel-line designs makes its appearance and is the most charac- teristic feature of this culture. Nonceramic artifacts are very scarce; no burials were ob- served. Following this level there appears an entirely new cultural tradition, represented by the Portacelli period (phases I and II). Although this may have certain ties with the Cocos period, it appears to form a well-defined new culture. Its most distinctive features are corru- gated ware, fine black-on-red painted ware with ornithomorphic designs, and quite a dif- ferent type of female figurines. Blackware is entirely missing and all incised decoration is confined to some rare specimens of the corru- gated ware. Among the nonceramic artifacts, a number of nose rings (?) of shell can be mentioned. The two phases of development were distinguished on the basis of stylistic analysis and the presence or absence of certain traits. Corrugated pottery appears only in the more recent phase and may represent a trade ware. Several primary burials of adults with undoubted Portacelli associations were observed in refuse deposits of the Horno period. A series of isolated cylindrical burial urns might also be associated, if we can judge by similarities in rim sherds and painted decoration. The Portacelli focus includes at least ten sites in the whole area, the contemporaneity of which ap- pears to be fairly certain. Its relatively recent chronological position, with regard to the Loma and Horno periods, seems to be proved beyond reasonable doubt by superposition. Cesar River. This area, situated south of the Rancheria, covers the upper drainage of the Cesar River (Fig. 93). The lower foothills of the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada and part of the western slopes of the neighboring Sierra de Perija probably should be included. The cultural material comes from five strati- graphical cuts, one burial cave, and three sur- face collections. The total of sherds is approxi- mately 25,000. The earliest, La Paz period has been postu- lated from the cultural remains observed in a burial cave, which contained some 120 cre- mated skeletons, a number of well-preserved pottery vessels, and a series of artifacts of stone, bone, and wood (Reichel-Dolmatoff, 1949). The dominant pottery is a white-on-red resist negative ware associated with stone palettes, spear throwers, and miscellaneous stone imple- ments of utilitarian character. From ceramic typology it may be suggested that this material forms part of an early horizon preceding the Loma-Horno sequence but this is, of course, open to verification by stratigraphic evidence. So far, we know of only one small La Paz-type sherd found in Loma association (Reichel- Dolmatoff and Dussan de Reichel, 1951, p. 91). The so-called Hatico period seems to cover a considerable time span and does not appear to have any relation to the preceding (?) La Paz material.

As a whole, this seems to be a local development derived from a southern tradition seen in the Saloa Incised wares of the Lower Magdalena area. Many decorative elements, such as the developing variants of the sigmoid scroll and the appearance of some sherds closely related to Horno painted wares, suggests contemporaneity of the Hatico and Loma-Horno sequences. Overlying the Hatico remains there appears modified Portacelli material, probably repre- senting a later development of the full Porta- celli II phase of the Rancheria River. Occa- sional trade sherds from the Saloa complex from the Lower Magdalena area are found here. Urn burial in plain, ovoid-shaped vessels was probably practised during the latter part of the Hatico period. The validity of the Cesar River area is evi- dently open to further verification and ulti- mately we might come to consider it as a pe- ripheral complex which combines character- istics of both the Rancheria and the Lower Magdalena areas. Although it forms in certain ways a unit apart, it is not quite a clear-cut cultural area. Lower Magdalena River. This area covers a very extensive region between the "panhandle" in the southern tip of the Department and the mouth of the Magdalena River (Fig. 93). Part of the lower Cesar River and the region bordering the Laguna de Zapatosa are included here. So far we know only a small section of the area, limited mainly to the southern por- tion of the Department, but sporadic finds indi- cate its wide range. There are at least 50 known sites in the southern part of the area. Our cultural material comes from three strati- graphic trenches, two extensive burial grounds, four surface collections, and a number of spor- adic finds. The total of sherds examined so far amounts to some 42,000. All accumula- tions of occupational debris were found to be very shallow, from 50 to 75 cm., although they are widespread and very rich in cultural re- mains. The chronological position of the differ- ent time levels was established by taking a Spanish-contact site as point of departure, by cross-dating, and by typology. The earliest period seems to be represented by a surface collection from a small island near the eastern shore of the Laguna de Zapa- tosa called Isla de los Indios, which lies below water level most of the year. It is characterized by thick-walled, straight-rimmed vessels with coarse sand temper, decorated by rocker-stamp- ing or broad, shallow incision. This would indicate a formative horizon, the nature and extent of which we still know very little. Nevertheless, there is some evidence, acquired during the course of our survey, which seems to indicate that it has a broad distribution in northern Colombia and which may ultimately lead to the definition of a rather homogeneous cultural horizon. In addition to the type site, similar materials were found in surface collec- tions from the eastern banks of the Magdalena River, some sites in the lowlands south of the Sierra Nevada, from the country surrounding Santa Marta, and from several sites near the mouth of the Magdalena River. This horizon is succeeded by a great time gap, from which we have at present only a few scattered finds of painted pottery. Follow- ing the gap is the Saloa I period, a quite recent time level just antedating the Spanish conquest. The main traits of this period are yellowish or reddish wares; deeply incised decoration with parallel-hatched or herringbone designs; com- binations of incised and punctate patterns; grater-bowls; a large variety of rim types; and a very characteristic decorative mode consisting of the application of small, flattened clay pellets, each provided with a diagonal notch which makes it appear like an "eye." Annular- based vessels are common. Only one ware, the least frequent, shows small, red-slipped cups with high annular bases, decorated with linear designs painted in black, and with modeled frog-motives near the rim. This ware seems to represent a final, clearly degenerative de- velopment of the Portacelli black-on-red cups with bird designs. The chronological contempo- raneity of urn burials was established through their association with Saloa I wares. Burial urns consist of large cylindrical containers pro- vided with a lid, upon which an anthropo- morphic bust is modeled. All urns were found in groups, in L-shaped tombs (Reichel-Dolma- toff and Dussan de Reichel, 1943). The Saloa II period is represented by a Spanish-contact site and surface collections from sites 50 kilometers south of the first. Some changes in form and decoration are readily discernible. Cylindrical carved stamps are fre- quent, as also are small clay spindle whorls REICIIEL-DOLMATIOFF j 359</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY I 0 XS0:d "ilfff f ".......: ..-. . ?..:;"-.. ... 5 f fS s; ffI 9 10 FIG. 98.

This area covers the isolated mountain mass situated in the northern portion of the Department of Magdalena (Fig. 93). It includes some of the beaches to the east and south of Santa Marta, but is otherwise limited to the foothills and mountain slopes, reaching occasionally up to more than 2,000 meters alti- tude above sea level. There are several hun- dred known sites, some of them of great exten- sion and covering many square kilometers of terrain. The cultural material which was used for typological and chronological analysis comes from some 30 house sites, 3 ceremonial house sites, 6 rock-crevices, 3 major burial grounds, and some 25 surface collections. Many sites contained well-preserved pottery; the sherd material reaches nearly 80,000 specimens. This area is by far the most complicated and problematic one. While the recent time levels are represented by a highly developed culture, the older levels seem to show a great cultural diversity. The establishment of an approximate time scale proved to be difficult because of the apparent lack of cultural deposits deep enough for stratigraphic analysis. As a matter of fact, the common house sites contain cultural strata of hardly more than 25 cm., while most refuse was thrown into deep and narrow crevices in the rocks, a practice which makes systematic excavation nearly impossible. A tentative chronological sequence was postulated by working back from Spanish-contact sites, by horizontal comparisons of typological series, and by occasional cross-dating. On the early time level, all data are highly speculative. A paleo-Indian horizon is sug- gested by some flint points found occasionally and without controlled associations. So far there is no evidence for a later pre- or non- ceramic horizon, and only little evidence for a formative stage, represented in this area by sporadic surface finds of a type similar to the Isla de los Indios material (see the Cesar River area, discussion). There exist several foci of cultural materials which could possibly be interpreted as archaic in type, preceding the formative, although the question whether we are dealing here with distinct cultures or only with limited ceramic complexes will be open to discussion until more work has been done in this area. The main characteristics are very crude, female clay figurines; clay pestles; coarse, sand-tempered redware; biomorphic lug-handles; and some objects of shell. As in the Lower Magdalena area, these materials seem to be separated from the recent cultural levels by a broad time span, bridged only by scattered finds of painted pottery. The discovery of a number of house sites containing Spanish contact material has served as a basis for the establishment of a typological series corresponding to the early (?) sixteenth cen- tury. By comparison of this series with the one obtained from noncontact sites and rock- crevices, it has been possible to establish an earlier time level and to suggest a tentative sequence of two periods. These have been termed Tairona I and II, after the sixteenth- century tribe which occupied part of the area. Tairona II is by no means degenerate but marks the cultural climax, while Tairona I can be distinguished as an earlier level. The main characteristics of Tairona II are megalithic domestic and ceremonial architecture, agri- cultural terraces, redware and smoked black- ware, the absence of all painted decoration and emphasis upon modeled biomorphic de- signs, tubular necklace beads of highly polished quartz, tetrapod vessels, monolithic axes, wing. shaped stone ornaments, ornaments of gold, gilded copper or "tumbaga," biomorphic clay whistles of excellent craftsmanship, etc. Tairona I is characterized by a far less de- veloped domestic architecture and a general lack of emphasis upon ceremonialism, the whole complex of monolithic axes, stone maces, and wing-shaped ornaments being absent. Although the basic red- and blackwares are already present, they differ in surface finish and an additional type is represented by brown- slipped storage vessels. Characteristic shapes include redware cups with inverted rims, con- cave-based blackware jars, ring-shaped vessels in form of coiled reptiles, and large shallow trays with loop handles. Short conical pestles of coarse clay occur frequently as do ladles with cylindrical handles, which are often bio- morphic. Among the distinctive minor traits are a modeled frog motive; round instead of coffee-bean eyes; and large, oval depressions covering the upper part of the red- and brown- ware storage vessels, at the base of the neck.

The identification of deeper levels which might link Tairona I with the earlier cultures is one of the main problems awaiting solution in this area. On the southern and eastern slopes a new focus was observed which typologically seems to be ancestral to Tairona I and which we have tentatively designated sub-Tairona. However, the chronological position of this focus is highly problematic. The presence of readily identifiable sherds of Portacelli II wares in the sites of this focus, and the intrusion of some sub-Tairona materials into the latest Portacelli developments of the Cesar area, indi- cate contemporaneity, and in addition, many characteristics of the suggested sub-Tairona period seem to be ancestral forms of Tairona I traits. Nevertheless, it is possible that this may instead be a local development parelleling to some degree the Tairona I and II phases. The postulated sub-Tairona period is charac- terized by urn burial in anthropomorphic, ovoid - shaped vessels with a human face modeled on the wall of the container; red-and- blackwares with poorly controlled firing; female figurines (one of them sitting upon a four- legged stool); pure, hammered gold ornaments; spindle whorls; and necklace beads, the latter of Tairona I or II type. Recent excavations in the Rio Seco drainage seem to make possible a subdivision of this period into smaller chronological units, based upon seriation of grave associations. Littoral. This area covers the narrow strip of arid coastal plains south of Santa Marta; the Costa de Salamanca, which separates the Cienaga Grande from the open sea; and some of the beaches and surrounding flat country east of Santa Marta (Fig. 93). There is some evidence of a possible extension onto the Guajira Peninsula and, towards the west, over the coastal plains of the Departments of Atlantico and Cordoba. There are some 30 open sites, mostly shell mounds and middens. All cultural materials considered here are those from surface collections. The total of sherds amounts to some 10,000. The main character- istics of this area are large accumulations of sea shells mixed with sherds and occasional arti- facts of bone, stone, and metal (copper and gold). There is no evidence of permanent village sites but rather of temporary fishing camps. Although Tairona I and II type pottery occurs frequently in association, the Littoral area is characterized by a different ceramic complex consisting of yellowish, rose-colored, or grayish wares, the occasional use of shell temper, and the considerable hardness of all wares as compared with the Sierra Nevada materials. Stonehammers and scrapers are common, as are also small necklace beads made from different-colored clay or from shell. It is apparent that some of these materials are contemporary with Tairona II, but on the other hand a considerable time depth is suggested by deep and extensive accumulations of refuse. A seriation of recent materials was established by cross-dating with the Tairona wares. CONCLUSIONS The five archaeological areas we have dealt with in the foregoing summary, can be partly correlated by overlapping horizons or cross- dating. An approximate correlation is outlined in Table 15 which shows the five corresponding columns with their proposed sequences. Be- ginning with the earliest time level and taking into account the sporadic data on flint imple- ments, it seems possible to suggest a paleo- Indian horizon common to all five areas. As far as truly archaic pottery is concerned, our data are just as scanty. On a formative level we have mentioned some materials from at least two areas (Lower Magdalena and Sierra Nevada). As to the earlier painted wares, represented by the Loma-Horno sequence in the Rancheria River area, the writer is inclined to believe that they once had a very considerable range and that they form a true horizon. From typological evidence derived from occasional finds, they spread over a wide region, possibly from Vene- zuela to Panama. In the Lower Magdalena area this horizon seems to be represented by the polychrome burial urns found in the vicinity of Mompos and by some superficial sherds from the region of Plato. In the Sierra Nevada they reached the area of Pueblo Bello on the south- ern slopes and in the arid country surrounding Santa Marta they may be identified with certain painted sherds from the region of Mamatoco. In the area of the Cesar River, closely similar materials come from a surface site in the western foothills of the Sierra de Perija, in the vicinity of the Laguna de Zapatosa. The second painted horizon (if one may call it so) is represented by the Cocos and Portacelli 364 [ 4, 1954</page><page sequence="14">SPACE AND TIME PERSPECTIVE IN COLOMBIA wares and also seems to have had a wide distri- bution, as far as we can judge from intrusive sherds found here and there in the neighboring areas. This horizon, it is felt, can be equated in time with another wide horizon of incised wares, both occupying a recent position. It is possible that certain types of burial urns might have a chronological significance and it is probable that the ovoid plain type and the anthropomorphic types are representa- tive of different time levels. The more realistic anthropomorphic urns seem to be quite recent and the writer is inclined to consider the so- called "Mosquito" urns, the Tamalameque urns, and the Sinu urns as belonging to one time level (cf. Bennett, 1944, pp. 78-9, 89-91, Table 9). It is tempting to try to suggest certain correla- tions with broader cultural configurations and to link our framework with some of the Vene- zuelan and Panamanian developments, but such an attempt would be very speculative in the present state of our knowledge of northern Colombian archaeology. So far, all investiga- tions have had mainly the character of a gen- eral survey and only the barest outline of cultural development can be presented here. The archaeological history of the interior provinces of Colombia is, of course, much too little known to permit any valid correlations or generalizations. However, it is probable that in the near future such a wider correlation might be attempted with a better claim for validity than can be done at the present.
