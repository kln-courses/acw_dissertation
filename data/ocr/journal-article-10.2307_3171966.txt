<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE STONE SCULPTURES OF THE UPPER GUINEA COAST* W. A. Hart University of Ulster Christopher Fyfe London The Upper Guinea Coast-the modem Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia-is one of the few parts of Africa where people have carved stone sculptures. The stone figures sculpted there, usually in soft steatite, or soap- stone, are generally called nomoli or pomta, depending on whether they have the standard features of figures found in southeastern Sierra Leone, or of those from the Kono and Kissi areas further north. There is a third group which con- sists mainly of sculpted heads on pedestal-like necks. They have been known to Europeans since at least the 1850s, and scholars have been publishing arti- cles about them since 1901. This paper is a critical review of these publica- tions. George Thompson (1852, 1858) The earliest definite reference to stone sculptures in Sierra Leone and neighboring countries is in Thompson in Africa, published in 1852 by the American missionary George Thompson. He described coming on "a nest of old broken graven images" in a destroyed town in Mendeland on 21 May 1850, and depicted one of them in an engraving under the title "The Stone God."' It is in the style typical of southeastern Sierra Leone. Illustrations of another four sculptures appeared in his The Palm Land of West Africa (1858).2 These were whole figures and heads, all carved from soapstone. He wrote that the Mende people denied having made them (he speculated that they must be the work of earlier Sherbro-i.e., Bullom-inhabitants), and that people dug them up, together with "old heavy brass and copper rings," when they were prepar- ing their farms and made offerings to them, trusting them to give protection, good luck, and good crops. He noted that they were found in Mendeland and that people living around the mission at Kawmendi on the Bum River near the Atlantic coast had never seen them. T. J. Alldridge (1901) T. J. Alldridge, who spent over thirty years in business and government service in the Sherbro country, mentioned that "steatite devils" were some- times dug up, and were greatly prized for their supposed supernatural powers. He commented that "as there are no native sculptors [in stone presumably], nor have been for many generations, it follows that they must either be of great antiquity, or the work of foreign artists."3 Fifteen years earlier he had History in Africa 20 (1993), 71-87.</page><page sequence="2">72 HART/FYFE given one such figure which had been dug up at Bendu on the mainland to the British Museum.4 L. Riitimeyer (1901, 1908) Riutimeyer's 1901 article was the first scholarly discussion of the stone sculptures.5 It gave photographs and verbal descriptions of a group of 17 of them in the University Museum in Basel, collected in the last decade of the nineteenth century by Swiss businessmen based on Sherbro Island.6 Riutimeyer recorded what the donors were able to tell him about them, some of which confirmed what Thompson had said. Like him, they reported that the present inhabitants denied having made them; that they found them buried in the ground in the course of preparing their farms; that they regarded them as made by God rather than men; and that in consequence they believed they would bring the owners good luck. Ruitimeyer therefore, like Thompson, con- cluded that they had been made by earlier inhabitants and were perhaps many centuries old. The article also included a brief summary of the results of a mineralogical analysis of the sculptures. Riutimeyer's Swiss informants were quite specific about the area in which sculptures were found-that they were discovered only between the Bum (Sewa) and Kittam (Waanje) Rivers, beginning at a point twenty kilometers from the coast, and turning up in greatest numbers some fifty or sixty kilome- ters inland. They also reported that the Africans from whom they obtained sculptures claimed that sometimes groups of as many as fifty were found buried together in mounds or tumuli. Their report that stone sculptures were discovered only some twenty or more kilometers inland between the Sewa and Waanje Rivers has not been picked up by later writers.7 It requires some qualification-later on, stone fig- ures were discovered in Kono district and in adjacent parts of Liberia and Guinea-but it echoed what Thompson had said, that they turned up only in certain parts of Mendeland and that they were not known on the coast or on Sherbro Island.8 And it is at least partly confirmed by the, admittedly very im- perfect, evidence that has come to light since ("imperfect" because so many figures in public and private collections lack provenance) that they are mainly concentrated in a comparatively narrow corridor whose western boundary is the Sewa river, and which runs from near the coast in a northerly or slightly northeasterly direction through Kono to the Kissi areas of Guinea. That they were sometimes found in mounds or tumuli in large caches has never been corroborated. Ruitimeyer was careful to report it as hearsay: none of his European informants had seen the mounds for themselves. G. D'Arcy Anderson, a District Commissioner (see Joyce below), argued that the sup- posed "mounds" were more probably collapsed remains of ancient steatite workings. He described coming across one such cave or chamber in Kunike Fulawusu Chiefdom, where a figure was attached to the rock face, together with a number of other half-finished figures or fragments, and suggested that the sculptures were executed in situ and only afterwards detached from the rock.9 Aldo Tagliaferri (see Tagliaferri below) has reported the recent discovery</page><page sequence="3">STONE SCULPTURES OF THE UPPER GUINEA COAST 73 of what may have been a similar underground passage.10 But figures still at- tached to the rock face have never again been recorded. Riutimeyer was cautious about saying when and by whom the sculptures were made. Their distinctively African facial features led him to think they were the work of indigenous African sculptors. Because they were found buried in the soil and the present Mende inhabitants did not know who had made them, he argued they must be several centuries old. He tentatively suggested ancient Egypt as a possible influence because, at the time when he was writ- ing, it was the only other region of Africa known to have a tradition of stonecarving. In a second article (1908) Riutimeyer reviewed the publications on stone sculpture from Sierra Leone which had appeared since 1901, also the growing body of evidence of stone sculpture elsewhere in Africa." He then described a further group of stone figures from Sierra Leone which had been donated to the Museum of the University of Basel. The most important new evidence brought forward was from an account by A. E. Greensmith, a Methodist mis- sionary in Sierra Leone, of stone figures found together with brass or other metal rings. Such figures were regarded by the local people with particular awe and respect, and were used, together with the rings, to swear witnesses in the chiefdom courts-hence the name they were known by, mahei-yafei (singular), mahei-nyafanga (plural), meaning "chief's devils."'2 This connection between figures and rings used for swearing had been noted by Thompson, and also by Schin in his Mende vocabulary (1884), which listed male-yafa [sic]," as an ob- ject of ancient worship discovered, as a brass ring or a stone image."'3 It should be noted that Greensmith described any stone sculpture found to- gether with a ring or rings as a mahei-yafei. He did not say that the name was applied to any one particular type of sculpture-for example, a pedestal head. Indeed, the figure Riitimeyer used to illustrate a mahei-yafei was an ordinary nomoli with a brass ring around its base. It was only later, as a result of Addison's article (see Addison below) that people began mistakenly (and, as we shall see, persistently) to identify nmahei-yafesia with pedestal heads. Riitimeyer's two articles are careful and scholarly-in contrast to some of the writings which followed. He set out what he learned from his sources clearly and sifted first-hand evidence from second-hand. When he went beyond the immediate evidence, as when he speculated about the age of the sculptures or about a possible Egyptian influence, he made it clear that these were only hypotheses. T. A. Joyce (1905, 1909) Joyce's two articles in Man described some stone sculptures recently ac- quired by the British Museum.'4 He also summarized Riitimeyer's articles for English readers, and gave additional unpublished information from English in- formants, including Anderson and Greensmith. By and large his sources con- firmed the area of provenance given by Thompson and the Swiss collectors. One of his informants, G. Hart, identified Bandajuma and Panguma Districts (inland southeast Sierra Leone) and the neighboring parts of Liberia as the</page><page sequence="4">74 HA R T/F YFE main areas where sculptures were found, and reported having also come across stone sculptures of a cruder sort in areas inhabited by the Kissi. Another, W.J. Bruce of the Sierra Leone Railway Survey, recorded the name nomori/nomoli.'5 The English sources generally gave more detailed informa- tion on how the Mende finders used them, and the beliefs and rituals associated with them-none of which, of course, has any necessary bearing on their orig- inal function and significance for those who made them. Joyce was skeptical about Riitimeyer's diffusionist speculations. The fa- cial traits depicted were, he argued, thoroughly "negroid" in character. They showed figures with typically African tattooing and ornaments, seated on stools of a type still common in the area (he was referring to the tripod kpakai chair found all over Sierra Leone). The material they were made of, soapstone, could be carved as easily, and with the same tools, as wood, and woodcarvings were found throughout sub-Saharan Africa. There was therefore no need to ex- plain them by referring to any outside influence. Joyce was also cautious about assuming that the sculptures were centuries old. Tribal migrations and the consequent extermination of populations were, he said, a feature of the history of the region, and could in a comparatively short time have obliterated the memory of the original makers. Here he went too far. Subsequent historical research has shown that this was not a country of constant migrations, where populations were exterminated.'6 Nevertheless, folk memory in the segmentary societies of the forest belt does tend to be short, indeed seldom extends beyond a few generations. Joyce also maintained that some of the stone figures were so close in style and execution to the woodcarvings still found in the area that they could be quite recent. But as he gave no examples, it is difficult to evaluate his claim. Our own view is that the style of most stone figures is markedly different from that of nineteenth- or twentieth- century woodcarving. H. Ne"el (1913) N6el's article was the first systematic discussion of stone sculpture from the Kissi areas of Guinea.17 It was based on more than eighty examples, some collected by himself, others in the Mus6e d'Ethnographie du Trocaddro (later Mus6e de l'Homme). He attempted to classify them into groups, depending on where they were found, the material they were made of, and their general ap- pearance. He also provided the first account of how they were used by the pre- sent-day Kissi, and he put forward the startling hypothesis that the original makers were not Africans but ancient Phoenicians. His reasons for this curious suggestion reflect the influence of diffusionist ideas in the early years of the century, as also the pervasive contemporary racial assumption that something sophisticated like sculpture in stone could not have developed independently in black Africa.'8 He pointed to the "phallic" appearance of many Kissi sculptures, which he associated with the eastern Mediterranean; to the "non-African" character of the "turbans" and round shields represented on certain sculptures; and to the allegedly "semitic" features of one sculpture in particular.19 He saw them as a possible vindication of sto-</page><page sequence="5">STONE SCULPTURES OF THE UPPER GUINEA COAST 75 ries that the Phoenicians, the great sailors of the ancient world, had established trading settlements on the west coast of Africa. Accordingly he was led to propose that the sculptures might date back before the Christian era. The greater part of his article was taken up with classifying the sculp- tures, most of which came from the Kissi region. He subdivided them into groups according to the material they were made of and their formal features, ranging from those he thought clearly phallic in character, with minimal, crudely-carved features, to elaborately-carved human figures. He suggested that the more rudimentary, "phallic"-type were originally associated with fertility cults, whereas the more carefully sculpted anthropomorphic figures were more likely to be ancestor figures. But he did not make it clear whether his sub- groupings corresponded to differences of function or age or simply in the skill of the individual sculptor. Nor did he say what grounds he had, other than the superficial appearance of the sculptures, for assigning them to either category. He also considered the use which present-day Kissi made of the figures they found in the soil in the course of their farm work. He noted that they dis- tinguished between the simple "phallic" carvings, which were objects of cu- riosity and no more, and the more detailed anthropomorphic figures, called pomdo, which they placed on the graves of their dead, believing them to be materializations of dead chiefs and intermediaries between the living and the dead. He described how they were also used as oracles in divination. His ac- count of Kissi practices was confirmed by Bogumil Holas20 and Denise Paulme (see Paulme below). This contrasts with those of the Mende, who used them for swearing and believed they brought good luck. W. Addison (1923, 1934) Addison's two short articles on the stone sculptures contributed little to the discussion, but his 1923 article was responsible for generating a mistake that has been repeated time after time in subsequent writings.21 He described two large pedestal heads which had been given him by a Paramount Chief in Moyamba District (Moyamba lies outside the areas where stone figures are usually found, and he did not specify whether they had been dug up there or brought from elsewhere). He said they were called mahen yafe (sic) or "chief' s devils." The term is obviously the same as mahei yafei used by Greensmith (see Rtitimeyer above) for stone sculptures found with metal rings, the usage already confirmed by Thompson and Sch6n. Addison also mentioned that the chief who had given him the heads had given him two metal bracelets which he said were usually found together with the sculptures, which explains why these pedestal heads came to be so de- scribed. Overlooking this, subsequent writers picked up the name mahen yafe, using the form Addison gave it (the more accurate rendering of the Mende ex- pression being mahei yafei) and applied it, not to figures that were found with metal rings, but to pedestal heads.</page><page sequence="6">76 HAR T/F YFE Denise Paulme (1954) Denise Paulme, working as an anthropologist, was primarily interested, in her Les Gens du riz,22 in how the Kissi people used pomdo (singular), pomta (plural).23 She identified two kinds of use-uncovered figures used on family cult altars and "dressed-up" figures (swathed in cloth, and carried about in cases) used in divination-but did not indicate any difference in sculptural style between them. Drawing by analogy on the customary belief that the nomoli found in Mende country were not made by the ancestors of the present inhabitants (with a reference to an article by Stanley Brown)24 she declared firmly, "les Kissi ne sont pas des sculpteurs."25 Uncertain how to date the fig- ures, she commented, as a possible guide, that some of them wore costumes that recalled to her those of the sixteenth-century Portuguese. At her request a geologist, E. J6r6mine, analyzed the types of stone found in the substantial collection of figures in the Mus6e de l'Homme, finding most were steatite. He added his own speculations on their origin, seeing in some a Cretan appearance, perhaps mediated at some remote period of time across the Sahara.26 William Fagg (1959, 1964) William Fagg of the British Museum tentatively pointed in 1959 to the similarity between the features depicted on some of the nomoli and those on some of the "Afro-Portuguese ivories," the ivory hunting horns, salts, and other objects carved by African artists in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century for the Portuguese.27 By 1964 he could write: "[i]t now seems certain that these soapstone nomoli were being made during the sixteenth century by the ancestors of the present Sherbro and (probably) Temne tribes."28 His inclu- sion of Temne he subsequently justified by querying "whether the Bulom were ever widespread enough to account for the finding of so many nomoli far into the Kono country. The Temne seem possible candidates on language grounds," but he agreed that "it would have been safer to say 'perhaps' than 'probably'." He had not at that time yet read Person's article on Kissi (see Person below).29 Fagg also commented gnomically that "the identity of style...between the nomoli and the majority of the Afro-Portuguese [ivories]...confirms our view that the nomoli forms lack stylistic qualities specially appropriate to stone- carving."30 He gave no further elucidation of this dictum. Yves Person (1961) The scope of Person's important contribution is far wider than a study of stone figures in Kissi country."3 It concerned all the related peoples of what he called "la civilisation forestibre."32 Using a combination of oral traditions, lin- guistic data, toponymy, and European written sources, Person reconstructed the early history of the region, relating it to the distribution of the figures. His own research was only in Guinea: for Sierra Leone and Liberia he relied on secondary sources. But this was no major disadvantage since the kind of</page><page sequence="7">STONE SCULPTURES OF THE UPPER GUINEA COAST 77 oral traditions reaching back in time which he was able to collect among the Sudanic peoples did not exist among those of the forest. He argued that, since figures were found only in areas previously occupied by peoples speaking Kissi or Bullom or related languages, there was a prima facie case for their being the work of ancestors of the present Kissi and Bullom. He noted that certain figures seemed to represent the practice of corpse interrogation (to discover the cause of death), a feature of forest culture unknown among the speakers of Sudanic (Mande) languages who subsequently infiltrated the region, but described by sixteenth-century Portuguese writers in some detail among the coastal peoples and still practiced, as Paulme found, by the Kissi. Person took issue with Paulme and those who said that because the Kissi did not sculpt in stone, and had no traditions of their ancestors sculpting, they could not have made the figures. He had himself discovered instances, admit- tedly rare, of Kissi sculpting in stone and, more significantly, that they had preserved a memory of initiands carving during the course of a now-extinct toma dugba initiation. This led him to speculate that the ancient figures had also been used in initiations. Person also insisted there was no need to invoke a non-African source for the features N6el had highlighted-the phallic character of some sculptures, the round shields and turbans, and the allegedly "semitic" features-pointing out that phallic cults exist everywhere, including Africa, that there were doc- umented examples of round shields in Africa, that what Ndel identified as a "turban" might well be something quite different, and that many Africans had what N6el chose to call "semitic" features. Person commented on the diversity of forms and the large number of fig- ures that have been found, and that though "thousands" (a figure he did not justify) had been taken away by Europeans, and several hundred of them acquired by museums in Europe, they were still being regularly dug up. Hence he concluded "qu'il s'agit d'un art ayant dur6 de longs siecles et en consequence ayant connu une 6volution complexe qui nous 6chappe."33 As the earliest possible date for their manufacture he suggested 500 AD, on the grounds that the figures were sometimes found with iron rings, and that this was the earliest ironworking date then identified for this part of West Africa. But, as Joyce had already suggested (see Joyce above) and Atherton was to confirm (see Atherton and Kalous below), soapstone can be carved with stone celts. So it is only those found with iron rings which must date from af- ter the introduction of ironworking. They must certainly date, Person argued, from before the arrival in the area of peoples speaking Mande languages, in particular the Kono and Mende, who now occupy the territory between the present Kissi and Bullom peoples where so many sculptures are found. Drawing on oral traditions and the evi- dence of sixteenth-century European visitors, he identified as a historical wa- tershed the "Mani" invasion of the mid-sixteenth century which led to an in- flux of peoples speaking Mande languages into eastern Sierra Leone, separat- ing the Kissi from the Bullom and, he claimed, destroying their "forest civi-</page><page sequence="8">78 HART/FYFE lization." Hence the mid-sixteenth century was the latest date at which the stone figures could have been produced in most of southeastern Sierra Leone, though they could have survived longer, perhaps several centuries longer, in the areas retained by the Kissi and Bullom. Person cited Paulme's view that some figures seem to be wearing European dress and must therefore date from after the initial contacts with the Portuguese in the mid-fifteenth century. Here we are skeptical. Our own judgment is that the alleged articles of European dress are unconvincingly European. The feature identified as a "ruff collar"-incidentally, a late six- teenth-century fashion-is more easily explained as a rolled, sausage-like col- lar of a type still found in traditional costume in the area. Nor can we identify in any figure what Paulme saw as "Portuguese armor," or indeed any other article of specifically European dress.1 Nor can we accept that the "Mani" invasion was the critical factor in bringing stone sculpture to an end. On Person's own evidence the Kono, a Mande people, were already in occupation of part of the original Kissi home- land some fifty years before the "Mani" arrived in the mid-sixteenth century. It is an area where stone sculptures have been discovered in great profusion, in- cluding some of the most interesting and elaborately carved. If they were made by the Kissi/Bullom predecessors of the Kono, then they must date from be- fore 1500.35 Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that the Kono, who are re- lated to the coastal Vai, were at one time directly linked to them, since the now extinct "Dama" language formerly spoken in the area between Kono and Vai country, seems to have been a closely-related Mande tongue.6 This raises the possibility that already by ca. 1500 the Kissi/Bullom had lost control of the main centers where sculptures were made. If so, it is unlikely that many sculptures were produced after that date.37 This could explain why Portuguese descriptions of Sierra Leone in the early 1500s, which have a lot to say about ivory carving and the carving of wooden statues by Temne and Bullom carvers, make no mention of carving in stone.38 However, since the Portuguese were writing mainly about the country round the Sierra Leone estuary and the Scarcies delta and do not appear to have visited the inland country east of the Sewa where sculptures are found, we dare not read too much into their silence. Person's article was pioneering in its use of detailed fieldwork combined with early Portuguese and Dutch sources. Although we cannot accept the cen- tral place he gave to the mid-sixteenth-century "Mani" invasion in ending the sculpting of stone figures in the region, his claim that the sculptures were produced by the ancestors of the present Kissi and Bullom, at a time before the arrival of peoples speaking Mande languages split them apart, seems to us by far the most convincing explanation of the geographical distribution of the figures. Paul Ozanne (1966) In 1966 the British archeologist Paul Ozanne paid a month's visit to Sierra Leone, and identified some pottery vessels in the Museum as belonging</page><page sequence="9">STONE SCULPTURES OF THE UPPER GUINEA COAST 79 to "a mediaeval culture complex" which he called "the Beaker Group," on the grounds that they resembled "those of the West European Beaker Culture of the late Neolithic and Bronze Ages." He went on to link these "beakers" with "the famous steatite figures, the nomoli"' though without explaining what the link was.39 This irresponsible thesis, a gift for diffusionists, was investigated by Matthew Hill, who had done systematic archeological work in Sierra Leone. He found no connection between the vessels and the nomoli---or indeed anything to suggest that there had ever been a "Beaker Group" culture complex in Sierra Leone.40 Kunz Dittmer (1967) Dittmer's article is easily the most ambitious discussion to have appeared on the stone figures.4' In it he comprehensively mastered Person's "evolution qui nous 6chappe," classifying them-partly by provenance, partly by stylistic analysis-arguing that they could be arranged in temporal sequence ("early style," "middle style," "late style") and that the dates of the successive phases could be roughly determined. He also sought to relate them to artistic tradi- tions elsewhere in West Africa. Working in the Germanic diffusionist (basically racialist) tradition, he traced them all back to the diffusion of ideas, techniques, and motifs from the ancient kingdom of Meroe and ultimately to Persia and India.42 Dittmer claimed to have identified a universal tendency within the art of black Africa (Negerkunst) towards increasing stylization (Geometrisierung, Schematisierung), such that wherever one found naturalistic forms they could be presumed to be earlier than the more stylized and schematic forms.43 Here he offered no independent historical evidence. Indeed, faced with archeological evidence that the Nok art style was earlier than the more naturalistic art style of Ife, he argued that the archeologists must be mistaken, and that despite the apparent evidence Nok must be later. Hence, since the Upper Guinea pedestal heads were more naturalistic in style than the nomoli, and displayed a "partly ethiopid racial type," they must be "early style." Similarly, the more anatomi- cally correct nomoli must be "middle style" and those with more exaggerated, even caricatured, racial features, "late style," in whose decadent phase the fig- ures showed increasing crudeness, and inattention to, or misunderstanding of, descriptive detail. He applied the same reasoning to periodize what he called the "Kisi" style, a sub-style of the pointa. Having classified his stylistic phases in order Dittmer went on to date them from historical evidence, using the apparent stylistic similarities be- tween the nomoli and the Afro-Portuguese ivories already noted by Fagg. He decided that the ivories displayed the characteristics of the late "middle style," and that the "middle style" must therefore date from before the period when the Portuguese reached Sierra Leone, with the "early style" probably thirteenth to fourteenth century or earlier. Dittmer also associated differences of style with ethnic differences. He ar- gued-solely on the basis of the differences between the simple column- shaped pomrnta and the more elaborate pomnta with their bared, "grinning" teeth,</page><page sequence="10">80 HA R T/FYFE hooked noses, weapons, and headgear-that the latter were not the work of the Kissi but of a warrior people whom he identified with the sixteenth-century "Mani."44 This seems gratuitous, given that the "Mani" are not known ever to have practiced stone sculpture or to have played any part in the history of Kissi or Kono. It would be more plausible therefore to suppose that the differ- ences indicated the locality where the different pomta came from, since the former are found in the Kissi area of Guinea, the latter (those that have definite provenance at all) in the Kono District of Sierra Leone. They are therefore likely to be regional sub-styles. On the same basis Dittmer attributed nomoli to the Bullom, and pomta to the Kissi. Here he was on stronger ground since such a hypothesis is sup- ported by the apparent geographical distribution of nomoli and pomta, but proving it demands giving the figures reliable provenances. This Dittmer ig- nored.45 Sometimes the captions to the figures he illustrated (many from pri- vate collections in Monrovia) do imply that their owners had collected them in situ, but for all we know they (or Dittmer) may simply have classified them as nomoli or pomdo on the basis of their appearance. How else can one ex- plain his listing one sculpture (Abb. 18) as a pomdo when the caption shows it was found in southern Sierra Leone? In practice he seems just to have as- sumed that figures in nomnoli style are found only in the south, those in pomta style only in the north. Dittmer scoured sixteenth-century Portuguese texts for clues to identify the makers of the figures and their possible significance, arguing persuasively that they represent chiefs and notables, but too often he made up his historical record as he went along. He dated the changeover from "early" to "middle" nomoli style to the establishment of a "loose sovereignty" of the Temne over the Bullom in the fifteenth century for which, like his "Mani" conquest of Kissi and Kono, there is no evidence. He described the "Mani" riding horses.46 He referred to the Portuguese having settled on Sherbro Island, and to their robbing the Temne and Bullom nobles of their golden nose- and earrings. All these are products of his imagination. For all its parade of scholarship, and the respect which it has been accorded, Dittmer's article seems to us thoroughly unreliable. Its conclusions should not be quoted unless they can be independently verified. Philip Allison (1968) Allison's African Stone Sculptures covered the whole African continent, including a section on "The nonmoli of Sierra Leone and the pomtan [sic] of Guinea."47 In his introduction he pointed out that stone has been sculpted in Africa only in a very few specific localities scattered over the whole continent and widely separated from one another, so that "any observable resemblances, and they are few, are almost certainly due to parallel evolution rather than cul- tural diffusion."48 His comment is a reminder that the sculptors who created the Upper Guinea Coast figures were creating artefacts that were not only orig- inal in style, but in the medium in which they chose to work, which they must have selected on their own initiative.</page><page sequence="11">STONE SCULPTURES OF THE UPPER GUINEA COAST 81 He included photographs of eighteen stone figures from museum collec- tions (British Museum, Mus6e de l'Homme, Pitt-Rivers Museum) labeled with the vague provenances the museum authorities had given them ("Kissi," "Temneland," "East Kono," "Sherbro," etc). He indicated features which seemed to distinguish them as pomta or nomoli or left them ambiguous-or even, in some cases, apparently unrelated stylistically. He also illustrated two pedestal heads (misnaming them mahen yafe ), commenting that "such natu- ralism of treatment is seen nowhere in Africa, except at Ife."49 In his discussion Allison followed the usual authorities, drawing particu- larly on Person's work (Dittmer he did not use). Three figures he saw as being similar to Dogon carving, but admitted that the Dogon country is six hundred miles from Kissi, and that there is no record of any connection between them. John H. Atherton/Milan Kalous (1970) Atherton and Kalous's article offered little that was new.5 It reviewed the existing literature rather uncritically. Kalous was a diffusionist admirer of Frobenius, so Dittmer was let off very lightly.5" They attributed nomoli and pomta to an "aboriginal race" whom they identified as the "Sapi," the name given by early Portuguese writers to the inhabitants of Sierra Leone, but without making it clear that these "Sapi" included peoples such as the Temne and Limba who live outside the area where stone sculptures have been found. Atherton is one of the few archeologists to have worked in Sierra Leone, but he worked in the north where there are no stone figures. The evidence he found there of seventh/eighth-century AD ironworking was irrelevant to the discussion, since (as he pointed out himself in a later article) the steatite fig- ures could have been carved with tools of harder stone.52 The authors referred to evidence of cultural communication between northern Sierra Leone and the western Sudan, but without being able to relate it to the production of stone figures, and added some information about present-day uses of stone figures by the Kono with a passing reference to the Temne custom of commemorating the dead by unsculpted stones (see Lamp below), but again without attempting seriously to relate it to the figures. Aldo Tagliaferri/Arno Hammacher (1974) The most valuable part of Tagliaferri and Hammacher's Fabulous Ancestors was Hammacher's dramatically presented photographs which showed a wider selection of sculptures than had been seen in any previous publication.3 Some had already been used by previous writers, but many were new. Like Atherton and Kalous, they suggested the figures were made by "Sapi," and followed Person in assuming that carving was brought to an end by the "Mani" invasion of the "Sapi" country. Much of their discussion was simply lifted uncritically from Dittmer. However, they did reject his hypothe- sis that figures in the so-called "grinning style" were produced by the "Mani." Drawing more carefully and systematically on the same Portuguese texts as</page><page sequence="12">82 HA R T/F YFE Dittmer, they showed it was the "Sapi" who filed their teeth, as shown on the sculptures, not the "Mani," and so for other features he had claimed as "Mani." Like Dittmer, Tagliaferri and Hammacher used the terms nomoli and pomta inconsistently, maintaining at one point that the names derive from the peoples (Mende and Kissi) who mainly find them, and therefore indicate only where, or by whom, they were found, and yet labeling sculptures as nomoli or pomdo whose provenance was unknown, and which can only have been so classified on the grounds that they resembled sculptures from the two groups. There is even a figure collected in Kissidugu in Guinea labelled nomoli, notwithstanding its apparent provenance. Frederick Lamp (1983, 1990) In his 1983 article Lamp drew on a wider range of literary and oral sources than previous writers, and took further the iconographic analysis of the sculp- tures themselves." He used the contemporary Portuguese and English reports on the "Sapi" and "Mani" to argue that the figures have "Sapi" rather than "Mani" characteristics, following Dittmer in claiming that the more elaborate sculptures represented members of a "Sapi" elite. Lamp had worked extensively among the Temne, who, with the Bullom and Kissi, were among the so-called "Sapi" peoples. In his article he claimed for them a more central role in producing the sculptures than anyone had pre- viously contemplated. He suggested that they too frequently find figures, and argued that they had formerly occupied the southeast corner of Sierra Leone, where sculptures are found in greatest numbers. Thus he could maintain that it was the Temne who were responsible for them, and that therefore Temne burial rituals uniquely hold the key to understanding their meaning and func- tion. His claim that stone sculptures are frequently found in Temne country is simply not true in our experience. Farmers in the Temne homelands in north- ern Sierra Leone rarely find them, nor are they the focus of any special rituals or beliefs, as they are among the Kissi, Kono, and Mende. The famous sculp- ture in the Pitt-Rivers Museum which Lamp illustrated was found in Kunike, on the border between Temne and Kono country, and stylistically as well as geographically belongs with the sculptures found in Kono.55 Lamp's argument that the Temne formerly occupied the southeast corner of Sierra Leone is tenuous, based on the evidence of a few place names, the similarity between some Temne words and words in the extinct language of Dama (which, however, David Dalby has shown to be a Mande language, re- lated to Vai and Kono)," and an oral tradition that Kasi on the Vai-Mende bor- der was originally a Temne town." We cannot find such evidence convincing, nor feel they justify Lamp's supposing that Temne produced the sculptures. It could nevertheless be true that Temne burial rituals might be traced back to burial rituals of the ancient "Sapi" peoples, and that (as Lamp con- tended) the Temne practice of commemorating dead chiefs by placing a stone in the Boro ma-sar or "house of stones" (a village shrine containing stones which collectively represent the ancestors of the village) might be related to a</page><page sequence="13">STONE SCULPTURES OF THE UPPER GUINEA COAST 83 notional "Sapi" custom of commemorating chiefs by means of sculptured stone figures. But this is pure hypothesis, and cannot be taken to justify the claim that Temne produced stone figures. In his 1990 article Lamp described a number of recently discovered and much eroded wood figures from Sierra Leone, carved in a style similar to that of the stone figures.8 One had been carbon-dated with a high degree of proba- bility to a period between 1200 and 1400, the earliest date ever obtained for sculpture in Sierra Leone. But although this indicates some antiquity for a carving tradition common to wood and stone, it does not help us to date the stone sculptures. Kathy Curnow (1983) Kathy Curnow's doctoral thesis was an impressive, detailed study of the Afro-Portuguese ivories.59 Like Fagg and Allison she noted the close stylistic affinities between them and the stone sculptures, drawing the very plausible conclusion that they were made by the same artists working in different media. But sustaining this conclusion was less easy. Curnow claimed that the nomoli and pomta are quite different, that there are "no stylistic links" between them, so that pomta could be dismissed as "outside the realm of [her] work." Yet what she identified as typical nornoli attributes, such as exaggerated features, protruding eyes, etc., are found in both, and the "archaic smile" (specifically mentioned) is more a pomta than a nomoli attribute. Having got rid of the pomta, Curnow indicated on a map where nomoli have allegedly been found. It shaded in the entire Sierra Leone coastline from Scarcies to Mano, including the Scarcies delta and the lands around the Sierra Leone peninsula where the Afro-Portuguese ivories appear to have originated, but where as yet stone sculptures have never been discovered. This misled her into bracketing the Temne with the Bullom as creators of the nomnoli and also (without any further justification) of the pedestal heads (miscalled, as usual, mahen yafe), identifying both peoples with Ozanne's imaginary "Beaker Group" (see Ozanne above). So, however plausible may be the stylistic affinities between the stone and ivory carvings, the actual connection between them has been in no way plausibly worked out. Aldo Tagliaferri (1989) Tagliaferri returned to the stone sculptures in Stili del Potere/ Styles of Power, reproducing photographs of many hitherto unpublished examples in Italian collections.6? He reviewed publications which had appeared since 1974, including Atherton/Kalous and Lamp, and tried to reformulate his views of the "Mani invasion" in the light of Hair's criticisms.61 Most of the weaknesses noted in the earlier book persisted. Dittmer con- tinued to be a baneful influence, particularly in Tagliaferri's casual categoriza- tion of figures as "early" and "late," depending on the extent to which they di- verged from descriptive naturalism. He still referred confidently to sculptures from the Republic of Guinea depicting figures in "Portuguese clothing and</page><page sequence="14">84 HA R T/F YFE armor of the Renaissance and baroque [sic] eras." The problem of obtaining reliable provenances was still not faced-though he dropped a hint, for which we would like to learn the evidence, that the "classic" "mahen yafe" (i.e., pedestal heads) are found "especially in the area that lies between Sefadu and Kenema." Following the pattern set by Fagg, Dittmer, and Lamp, Tagliaferri gave the Temne major credit for having produced the sculptures.62 Tagliaferri's attempt to incorporate Hair's views on the "Mani invasion" resulted in an uneasy compromise and the loss of what sharpness of outline there had been in his earlier version. For the sudden "disappearance" of stone sculpture he substituted its slow "decline." Moreover, instead of blaming the "Mani" exclusively for this decline, he invoked other heterogeneous causes- internal strife, the slave trade, and the pressure of Christian and Muslim mis- sionaries-though how the latter, who were not significant in southern Sierra Leone before the nineteenth, or, more realistically, twentieth century, could have helped on the decline of stone sculpture in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and why only of stone sculpture, he did not explain. What after all these years of scholarly (and less than scholarly) investiga- tion can we confidently say we know about the stone sculptures? First we can say that the area where they were produced was far more geographically re- stricted than many have supposed and, crucially, that it did not include the country round the Sierra Leone estuary or the Scarcies delta. Secondly, that they were made in large numbers, and that their area of provenance points to their having been made by ancestors of the present Kissi and Bullom peoples. Thirdly, that although the ending of stone sculpture was associated with the movement of Mande peoples to the coast, production must have ceased in at least one major center, Kono, fifty years or more before the "Mani" invasion; nor is there any evidence whatever that stone carving was still going on when the invasion occurred. Fourthly, in the light of the above it is hard to see how there can be the direct connection between the stone carvings and the Afro- Portuguese ivories which Fagg and others inferred from their stylistic affini- ties, although both clearly emerged from a common carving tradition which had considerable antiquity. Lastly, there is no other stone-carving tradition to which this tradition can plausibly be related. It is a meager harvest, but we hope there are at last fewer tares among the wheat.63 Notes * Joseph Opala originally suggested to us the need for an paper of this kind.

But counting the 300 reported by Jeremine in the Musee de l'Homme in 1945; 200 or so which ought to be in the Sierra Leone Museum; those in museums in Liberia, Guinea, and Senegal; over 80 in the Museum of Mankind; 41 in Bern; 38 reported by Ritimeyer in Basel; and those in other museums in Europe and the United States-not to mention large private collections, such as those published by Tagliaferri (see below)-the figure is certainly above a thousand and "thousands" is possible. But as we have no idea how many sculptors were working at any given time, any estimate of the time span of sculpting based on numbers alone, such as Person's "longs siecles," is dangerous. 34. Person also cited a reference by Malfante to "idols of wood and stone" being worshipped by Africans south of Cape Verde. Since Malfante was writing in 1447, before the</page><page sequence="16">86 HAR T/FYFE Portuguese had reached Sierra Leone, this cannot refer to sculptures there, if indeed it refers to anything specific, given that idolators worshipping sticks and stones is a familiar formula from the Old Testament. 35. In a footnote ("Statuettes," 45n3) Person suggested that there had been a similar "bouleversement" in the Kono country ("Le processus fut sans doute analogue en pays kono"), without reflecting that this undermined his case for singling out the "Mani" invasion as the event that brought stone sculpture in the region to an end. 36. Adam Jones, "Who were the Vai?" JAH 22(1981), 171-74 37. If, as Dittmer has persuasively argued (see below), the figures represented members of a ruling elite, and were linked to their rituals, the sculpture tradition is likely to have ended with the ending of their rule. It is worth noting (although it does not affect our immediate argument about the end of stone sculpting in Kono country), that Person's theory that the "Mani" invasion brought about a cultural "bouleversement" in the coastal country, taken up by Walter Rodney, A History of the Upper Guinea Coast, 1545-1800 (Oxford, 1970), has been discredited by Hair, "Ethnolinguistic Inventory," and idem., "From Language to Culture" in R. P. Moss and R. J. A. R. Rathbone, eds., The Population Factor in African Studies (London, 1975), as well as by Jones "Vai," 159-78. 38. According to Valentim Fernandes the peoples south of Cape Verde made idols of wood and stone. But in his very detailed section on Sierra Leone he mentioned only idols of wood and clay. So his "idols of wood and stone" may again be no more than the familiar Old Testament reference (see note 34). (Valentim Fernandes, Description de la Cate d'Afrique, ed. Th. Monod, A. Teixeira da Mota, and R. Mauny [Bissau, 1951], 75, 82-91). A French text of the 1570s described a "likeness of a toad or frog, in the very heart or center of a stone which was split and broken by the savages of [Sierra Leone]." (Andre Thevet in P. E. H. Hair, "Some French Sources on Upper Guinea, 1540-1575," BIFAN 21B [1969], 1032). This has been taken to be a description of a nomoli but might equally refer to a fossil, or some natural trompe d'oeil. There remains a single passage in Manuel Alvares, writing in the early seventeenth century: "There is such a collection of these images that they have to be seen to be believed. Some are hewed out of blocks of wood with skill, and show the face and other features; others are only hacked out of similar blocks in a single blow. Some are sculpted on small stones or on rocks' (Manuel Alvares, "Ethiopia Minor, and a Geographical Account of the Province of Sierra Leone (1615)," translated P. E. H. Hair, Department of History, University of Liverpool, 1990, f. 64v). But it is only of the wooden images that we are told they showed the face and other features. The stone "images" may simply have been scratched or inscribed. 39. Paul Ozanne, "A Preliminary Archaeological Survey of Sierra Leone," West African Archaeological Newsletter 5(1966), 33. 40.

We can trace no other writer who has noted this alleged "universal tendency" (and are extremely grateful to Jiirgen Zwernemann and to Adam Jones for helping us in our search). Neither Frobenius nor his contemporary Fritz Graebner mention it.

We think such defeatism premature until a systematic search of museum collections has been made: some early museum collections are much better in this respect. A start might be made in the Sierra Leone Museum, where a high proportion of figures have provenances, some of them quite detailed, which no one has bothered to use. For example, 62. 6. 7 Found Moinde Valley, 1/4 mile south of Sukudu Town, 20 feet deep; 62. 13. 32 Found near</page><page sequence="17">STONE SCULPTURES OF THE UPPER GUINEA COAST 87 Gbanankava stream, 1 1/2 miles north of Tumbodu, Kamara Chiefdom, less than 2 feet from the surface; 64. 29. 7 Found in gravel, depth of 4 feet, Nyandehun village, Nimi Koro Chiefdom, about 3 miles SE of Jaiama Town; and so on. 46.

He also supposed them to have "exercised influence over the Bullom" and to have confined them today to part of Turner's Peninsula, a positively Dittmeresque piece of fantasy. 63. We think it likely that the stone figures still hold surprises in store. One of us (WAH) remembers being shown in Freetown in 1970 a sculpture that was clearly genuine and did not fit into any of the existing stylistic categories. It was carved in an extremely hard, rough-surfaced, brown stone. The figure was about six inches tall, almost two dimensional, and had a round moon-face with little projections, like rays, around the edge.</page></plain_text>
