<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Meaning David Campbell Nietzsche writes more or less unsystematically on many subjects, includ ing morality, art, religion, and politics. In this article I explore the pos sibility that enquiry into meaning unites his thought, so far as anything does. This topic is wide, but I focus on the suggestion in The Genealogy of Morality, The Birth of Tragedy,1 and less systematic works of a theory of interpretation that explains how terms such as "knowledge," "being," and "truth" come to have their meaning and, in cases such as Plato's, as he believes, to lack mean ing. Commentators often take Nietzsche's notion of meaning for granted; in attempting a sustained account, I look at Heidegger both as indebted to him and as responding critically. Thus I do not simply interpret their writings but treat them as a starting point for analysis and systematic reflection, consis tently with what they say. The first part of the article considers critically the suggestion in these works of a virtue ethics, based on self-interpretation, and also of a wider theory of interpretative meaning. The second part examines Heidegger's comments. Nietzsche The second section of the Preface to GM declares that "the subject of the present work" is "the provenance of our moral prejudices." Nietzsche's ques tion here, then, is the origin of morality.2 Previously, however, in the first sec tion, he had asked how we are to understand ourselves. "We ask . . . 'Who are we, really?'. . . The sad truth is that we don't understand our own sub stance" (Preface, ?1). This anticipates his answer to the question of the ori gin of morality: it originates in us. He goes on to indicate that our "substance" is in his view "will" or agency. The self is not simply a mirror to the world, passively undergoing experiences and reproducing them symbolically in judg ments, but engages actively and in some ways creatively in experience. His starting point is therefore the autonomous agent. He emphasizes this again at the end of the work: Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Issue 26, 2003 Copyright ? 2003 The Friedrich Nietzsche Society. 25</page><page sequence="2">26 David Campbell Until the advent of the ascetic ideal, man, the animal man, had no meaning at all on this earth ... the ascetic ideal... is and remains a will. Let me repeat, now that I have reached the end, what I said at the beginning: man would sooner have the void for his purpose than be void of purpose. (Ill, ?XXVIII) Nietzsche suggests, rather than states, a theory of self-interpretation. One understands oneself as interpreting felt concerns and related abilities in terms of chosen, "willed" projects, particularly one's role. In this way, one's life as agent has meaning both as felt or qualitative and as structured, and moral terms acquire both their sense and efficacy. He introduces this theory by assuming that there can be natural aristocrats and imagining that they inter pret their "noble" and "high-minded" qualities and "mighty" abilities in terms of the "highly placed" role of ruler: It was the "good" themselves, that is to say the noble, mighty, highly placed and high-minded who decreed themselves and their actions to be good ... in contradistinction to all that was base, low-minded and plebeian. . . . The ori gin of the opposites good and bad is to be found in . . . the dominant temper of a higher, ruling class in relation to a lower, dependent one. (I, ?11) The meaning of the terms "good" and "bad" is determined "not for a time only . . . but permanently" by the ruler's "decree." In this way there comes about a common currency of values and social cohesion. This decree is not arbitrary, but a "quick jetting forth" from his character. The source of "supreme" value judgments is, then, the agent, somewhat as water under pres sure jets out a fountain. To find the origin of moral terms we need to look back, so to speak, to character, not ahead to consequences or "utility." Nietzsche dismisses the "lukewarmness which every scheming prudence, every utili tarian calculus presupposes." He further highlights impassioned agency by castigating its opposite, the "slave ethics" of the "low-minded," as merely passive and reactive rather than active and creative. "Slave ethics requires ... an outside stimulus in order to act at all; all its action is reaction" (I, ?X). Nietzsche speaks of the ruler's "triumphant self-affirmation" (I, ?X), sug gesting that his will would be ascendant in its own terms only, if the cir cumstance of a "pathos of distance" between a natural ruler and "plebeians" did not dictate his ascendancy over them. The feelings one interprets have a bodily basis, in what Nietzsche calls one's "physiology": in other words, perhaps, one's physical type. His dis cussion of "priests" is further evidence that he operates a theory of self-inter pretation. Their "morbidity and neurasthenia" explain their turning away from "action," their self-disgust and consequent asceticism, and hence the moral terms they typically deploy such as "pure" and "impure," and their idea of God as "nothingness." Their self-understanding as priests depends on their interpreting morbid feelings, and these on physical debility:</page><page sequence="3">Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Meaning 27 Granting that political supremacy always gives rise to notions of spiritual supremacy ... the ruling caste is also the priestly caste and elects to charac terize itself by a term which reminds us of its priestly function. In this con text we encounter for the first time the concepts pure and impure. . . . The desire for a mystical union with God is nothing other than the Buddhist's desire to sink himself in nirvana . . . here has the human mind grown both profound and evil. (I, ?VI) "Evil" here therefore means ascetic; "profound" means reflective, implying the use of linguistic symbols (I, ? VI). Together, these characteristics produce the "will to truth," that is, a tendency to affirm an independent reality sym bolized in judgments that can be tested against it for truth and falsity, and thus to deny a role for the self in knowledge. Nietzsche admires this tendency for its part in forming Western culture (III, ?XXIVff.), but nonetheless he attacks it for enabling those with morbid, feeble will to claim moral author ity and hence political power. His account of moral concepts thus includes a "genealogy of . . . democratic prejudice" (I.IV). Those with feeble passions are herdlike and servile, resent their weakness and their rulers' strength, and pity each other. "With the eyes of a thief [such a type] looks at everything splendid, with the greed of hunger it sizes up those who have much to eat; and always it sneaks around the table of those who give."3 The uncreative majority, however, is supreme when united and, assisted by priests, codifies and institutionalizes compassion and altruism. In this way the term "good" comes to mean "bad" and vice versa, and their original senses are forgotten. Natural rulers acquire a bad conscience, inappropriately feel ing ashamed of their superior qualities and repressing them. Democrats are convinced that their creed has objective natural or divine authority, but such a "spirit of seriousness" is merely the fug of stifled passion. Altruism is a "sublimate" from this noxious source, like alcohol, for instance, when freed from water. "The vermin 4man' occupies the entire stage . . . tame, hopelessly mediocre, and savourless, he considers himself the apex of historical evolu tion" (I, ?XI). Eventually altruism evaporates into nihilism, that is, loss or denial of mean ing and value. Nietzsche speaks of the "death of God" and predicts social fragmentation, with dire political consequences. He does not try to reinstate altruism on a sound footing, however, but answers the nihilistic resentment of the weak with the joyful passion of the strong for life. Such proud defi ance alone creates meaning. The self-characterization of rulers and priests and reaction of "plebeians" or "slaves" explains only one aspect of moral talk. Nietzsche goes on to gen eralize this type of explanation, describing any autonomous agent as self characterized; on this basis he explains "values" such as promise-keeping. Thus he envisages a type of individual who, far from being "neurasthenic" and self-denying, characterizes himself independently":</page><page sequence="4">28 David Campbell The ripest fruit is the sovereign individual, like only to himself, liberated again from the morality of custom, autonomous and supramoral ... the man who has his own independent, protracted will and the right to make promises? and in him a proud consciousness, a sensation of mankind come to comple tion ... his measure lies in his own demands on himself ... he becomes authentically moral. ... He determines himself not according to consequences . . . but from his beginning. (II, ?11) One does not acquire good character and a sense of oneself by first taking goals and rules for granted. Instead, one first identifies whatever matters or makes a difference to oneself in particular, and then interprets this "passion" in terms of a role. Somewhat similarly, if one cares about fine art or fishing, for instance, one may interpret oneself as a budding artist or angler. Nietzsche, however, is concerned with role choice as determining where one's values lie, not where one's talents lie. In fulfilling one's passion one makes explicit the values it implies; a self-interpretation is not derived from preconceived values, but forms a background against which one conceives values. As a "jetting forth" of value judgments from one's character, this process is largely emotional and inarticulate rather than calculated and conscious. Values then depend on singling oneself out as author of one's biography, so to speak, not, for instance, on doing distinctively human things such as talking, tickling, or driving fast cars. Goals, rules, and values depend in this sense on choice. For Nietzsche, however, choice is responsible not only as liable to praise or blame but also as a settled response to feelings; it implies that one knows oneself and accepts its costs and benefits. Thus the metaphor of "jetting forth" does not imply that one's choice is simply voluntarist, like playing the lottery and winning the jackpot: good character is a prize hard won, commanding a high price and a cause for pride (I, ?VIII). By so interpreting felt concerns in terms of one's role, one also "creates" oneself: Nietzsche's theory has implications for the nature of the self and its realization, as he notes in GM. One's life gains an aim and narrative struc ture, and one acquires a sense of oneself as of a piece, enduring through time, and bearing rights and obligations. One makes the sense one does of one's life from this first-person stance. There cannot in general be a self that does not make sense to itself, more or less, and one interprets oneself and one's values together. What it is to be a self thus depends on will, exercised in self interpretation. Nietzsche also explains terms such as "responsibility" and "conscience," together with obligations such as promise-keeping, as expressions of virtu ous, "aristocratic" character: "Those who promise [are] like sovereigns . . . whose promises are binding because they know that they will make them good. . . . His proud awareness of the extraordinary privilege responsibility confers has penetrated deeply and become a dominant instinct.. . . Surely he will call it his conscience (II, ?11). Nietzsche calls this method of explaining</page><page sequence="5">Nietzsche. Heidegger, and Meaning 29 moral concepts "etymological": understandably, given his philological train ing. But his "etymology" is also a "genealogy," attempting to show that values originate in character, and that this is a matter of choice or self characterization. Yet this is only one application of his etymological method; it also applies generally to "the objective areas of natural science and phys iology." He excuses himself from showing how, saying, "I cannot enlarge upon the question now" (I, ?IV), but adds in parenthesis that "[t]he lordly right of bestowing names is such that one would almost be justified in see ing the origin of language itself as an expression of the rulers' power. They say, 'This is this or that' ; they seal off each thing and action with a sound and thereby take symbolic possession of it" (I, ?11). Such lordly "naming" is not a matter of picking out and labeling mean ings we perceive as though already formed independently of us. Nietzsche's methods include challenging such assumptions, but it does not follow that linguistic terms have in his view only rhetorical meaning. Instead, he seems to mean that we "bestow names" in the sense of stipulating meanings: words mean what we conventionally want them to mean. Perhaps we can concoct a nonmoral example by adapting his metaphor of the "aristocrat." In this fan ciful example, the term "forest" can be understood by recognizing connota tions with stag-hunting and the like in the minds of "nobles" who reserve their woods for such purposes. Just as we have to dig into "etymology" to rediscover that "pure" meant originally "inactive," so we ordinarily "forget" that the term "forest" was originally interpreted as "hunting ground" and sup pose that it simply means something like "woodland." Thus, to extrapolate from Nietzsche's brief discussion, a "name" does not mean just what the namer wants it to mean, somewhat as words have meaning for Humpty Dumpty. Instead, a "name" initially expresses various connotations in the minds of whoever does the "naming," and so comes to denote convention ally whatever conjures up these connotations, though many are subsequently lost or "forgotten." "Naming" consists neither in labeling preexisting mean ings nor in arbitrarily allocating a denoting use and specific sort of reference to a verbal sign that then over time accrues connotations; instead, denotation presupposes interpretation of objects in terms of interests. In this way, his account of the meaning of moral terms, based on self-interpretation, gener alizes to a theory of semantic meaning based on interpretation of objects. If for present purposes we can call self-interpretation "existential" as concerned with personal existence, and interpretation of objects also "existential" as concerned with what it is to be an object to which we refer, Nietzsche can be said to connect existential and semantic meaning. The background to this theory is Nietzsche's attack on cognitivist meta physics. He describes the metaphysics of his "great teacher" Schopenhauer as noncognitivist (Preface, ?V). "'Amidst the furious torments of this world, the individual sits tranquilly' [while doubting! the cognitive mode of expe</page><page sequence="6">30 David Campbell rience" (TBT, ?1, p. 22). There is no ultimate, metaphysical truth or reality that could be a foundation for knowledge, but only a disorderly cosmic will or striving; human beings can do little but observe events, renounce self, and pity each other. Nietzsche agrees that there is only a "will to power," as he calls it, which is inherently unstructured and indifferent to us. There is no given, preconceived end or telos that could remove the contingency of "exis tence" and redeem tragedy or justify its pain. But he questions his mentor's view of "the value of ethics" (GM, 153), denying that we need to resign our selves to impotent passivity. Rather, will to power manifests itself in us as interpretation of "passion" or emotion strong enough not to end futility and disorder but, on the contrary, to overcome them by willing their "eternal" recurrence. Empiricists also, among others, deny the possibility of metaphysical cog nition; but Nietzsche maintains that all cognitive assumptions need to be explained, while they exempt sensory cognition. For empiricists, further, "ideas" and their relationships in thinking derive from sensory experience, where for Nietzsche they derive from will to power. Unlike them, also, he uses an aphoristic, epigrammatic writing style to exhibit a poetic mode of thinking that does not rely on explicit deductive argument, and to thwart an argued account of his thought. The present article nonetheless tries to see whether such an account is feasible. In general terms, will to power is a commanding drive to use whatever is available as a means to itself: there is in the end only a circle of control and consumption. The term "power" is here an intensifier and does not indicate an external telos or aim of "will." Metaphysically, this inherently undiffer entiated process manifests itself as spatiotemporal, causally related natural units; conversely, since everything is a means to control, the process has no internal structure of means and ends. For any thing or object, to be is then not only to manifest will to power but also to be reducible to it. Nietzsche's doctrine of the eternal recurrence of every state of the universe reflects this circularity, and in this respect is also a metaphysical doctrine. Ethically, virtue answers nihilistic resignation and not only expresses felt control or will to power but also reduces to it. Epistemologically, one is constrained by a need for order and meaning to interpret the world in ways that others may share. Truth as the adequacy of statements to represent facts can then be reduced to interpretation in response to constraints. Any number of such interpreta tions or "perspectives" is possible. Here will to power is a nihilistic circle of interpretation that continuously consumes and overcomes itself. The doctrine of eternal recurrence reflects this circularity also. Nietzsche's epistemologi ca! particularism means that talk of knowledge and its objects expresses some perspective or other, which in turn manifests will to power. In emphasizing passion and control, Nietzsche hopes to avoid metaphys ical commitment. One reason he attacks Christianity is that he assumes that</page><page sequence="7">Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Meaning 31 it claims metaphysical knowledge. His objection is not to the idea of tran scendence, since his "superman" is transcendent in a sense, as the name implies. Rather, he rejects transcendental arguments such as that there must be objects outside experience to be mirrored or symbolized within it. At most, these arguments establish that we must believe that there are such objects, not that they exist, and he explains this belief by our need for order and mean ing. Thus he questions two assumptions: that there are transcendent objects, and that knowledge is merely representation. These assumptions leave unex plained both the notion of an object, as preconceived, and the notion of knowl edge, as reproducing something preconceived. He proposes to resolve this problem by explaining both knowledge and its objects as manifestations in us of will to power. In effect he distinguishes a judgment as representing fact and as a mental act expressing interest or power. Nietzsche's assumption that any metaphysics must be transcendental and cognitivist may seem unduly narrow; perhaps indeed he himself might be said to hold a metaphysics of will or agency. His attack on Christianity is then curious given that will, along with intellect, is for Christians fundamental to the nature of both God and human beings. A metaphysics of sheer will is hard to swallow, however, so far as the world is not only a sort of event or manifestation of agency but also there.4 Consonantly with his emphasis on will, moreover, Nietzsche thinks of human beings primarily as agents. One difficulty with this is that we are onlookers as well as agents, and interpre tation is an occurrence as much as a willed action; hence we can consider things as instruments to ends other than control. For Nietzsche, however, at least after Thus Spake Zarathustra, will to power is our fundamental drive. He calls it "the emotion of command";5 thus it is a "passion" rather than a psychological faculty. It has a bodily basis, and is stronger in some individuals than others. Will to power manifests itself as felt ability in doing and making, as distinct from a sense of achievement in completing an activity or product. The term "power" does not here indicate an object of will such as power over others; as an intensifier, it implies that one copes well. Hence will to power in human beings is a passion concerned with coping and control, and will in the sense of agency is the basis for choice. Such "choice" implies voluntary, intentional action, not free will: Nietzsche's theory of motivation is deterministic, though he is interested in feeling not simply as a causal antecedent of choice but as embodied and expressed in it. At the same time, such a notion of choice is not voluntarist in the sense that flipping a coin decides an outcome without effort, but is made amid struggle and strife. Twilight of the Idols (IX.38), for instance, describes choice or "freedom" as "measured ... by the resistance which has to be overcome, by the effort it costs." Will to power in us is opposed to a spectator's passivity, sustains a feeling of life, and gives rise to virtue. Nietzsche is immor?list in some modes, but in others, and perhaps in the round, he suggests a virtue ethics.6 In his ver</page><page sequence="8">32 David Campbell sion, enhanced vitality overflows into particular virtues: "[a] heart [which] flows full and broad like a river ... wants to overflow, so that the waters may flow golden from him and bear the reflection of your joy over all the world."7 If we are to act virtuously, we must have this feeling, and promote values that sustain it. "Morality grows out of triumphant self-affirmation . . . spontaneously" (GM 1, ?10). "The worth of an action depends on who does it. . . . It is no longer the consequences but the origin of action which deter mines its value" (BGE, Part Two, ?32). A heightened feeling of life, that is, "strong" will to power, brims over into particular virtues, as opposed to either lacking or bottling up strong passion. One is then socially engaged, congen ial, honest, proud (megalopsychos), courageous, generous, just, courteous, exuberant, and playful; and one has presence, energy, sensibility, self-disci pline, and self-sufficiency (?284).8 In the case of generosity, for example, "The noble human being aids the unfortunate but not, or almost not, from pity, but more from a superfluity of power" (?260). Well-being pours over into well-doing: one undertakes obligations voluntarily from virtue, and one is accountable to others for discharging obligations only as having under taken them. A difficulty for this theory is that filial obligations, for instance, do not depend in this way on undertakings. For Nietzsche, however, what gives meaning and value to one's life is a feeling of vitality both strong enough to meet its contingency, disorder, and pain and stable enough to persist if it recurred numberless times.9 Affirming eternal recurrence therefore stabilizes strong feeling. On this basis one makes the sense one does of one's life. Emotional debility, by contrast, manifests itself as incoherent self-interpre tation: one's will devises ways of defeating itself, and a vicious life is a botched expression of "weak," resentful feeling. Will to power is controlling, and so also therefore is virtue as manifesting it. Presumably we can cultivate or neglect virtue, but Nietzsche does not mean that we control our character in the sense that choosing and acting are said to be under our control or "free"; his view of character is determinist. For Hume also the final term in moral explanation is emotion; but unlike Nietzsche, the moral standpoint is in his view universal. Moral judgments express "sentiments in which [a man] expects all his audience are to concur with him. He must here, therefore, depart from his private and particular sit uation . . . [to] some universal principle."10 For Nietzsche, however, one is virtuous so far as one expresses feeling particular to oneself. Such an ethic is particularist in holding that moral obligations, commendations, and so on are products of virtuous feeling, not simply of "mechanical" universalizing or deduction from preconceived rules. We grade such feeling on a scale from, say, "excellent" to "poor" or, as Nietzsche says, from "strong" to "weak," not simply judging the actions "right" or "wrong" by universal rules. In a broadly similar sense, there is no "right" or "wrong" literary essay. Thus virtues such as courage, generosity, and courtesy are analogous to one another and form</page><page sequence="9">Nietzsche. Heidegger, and Meaning 33 a class in that each is in its own way an expression of "strength," that is, heightened vitality in exercising coping skills. Aristotle also is particularist in holding that a virtue such as courage depends on feeling particular to oneself, at a mean between excess and defect that implies the thinking (logos) of the practically wise; a courageous act is not simply a reflexive, automatic deduction from a preconceived rule (though Aristotle seems to take for granted rules prohibiting murder, adultery, and so on). The end (telos) of "happiness" consists in so acting, at least for those incapable of intellectual wisdom. Thus his ethics is self-regarding like Nietzsche's, though for Aristotle, unlike Nietzsche, one's interests include those of family, friends, and fellow-citizens. His account, however, is more structured than Nietzsche's, since his virtues are analogous as lying at their respective means. He also tabulates an analogy between vices as each in its own way an excess or defect, where Nietzsche has a catchall characteriza tion of vices as "weak," resentful, and self-defeating. But Nietzsche agrees that ethics has no metaphysical telos as its foundation, somewhat as Aristotle rejected Plato's foundationalism. Nietzsche's imperative is to "choose solitude": he associates the univer salist ethics of Utilitarianism and Kant with what is commonly called "moral ity," which he believes his ethic "overcomes." Utilitarians say that actions are right if they produce the best results for the majority regardless of feel ings particular to oneself; Nietzsche would protest that generosity, for instance, is not merely calculated giving, and one ought to keep a promise even if no one benefits. Kant held that one ought to act from regard for duty, not sim ply from feeling; a duty in one situation is a duty in every similar situation, and thus objective relatively to us. For Nietzsche this takes a third-person, onlooker's view of action. One's motive then has no meaning of its own that could explain why one would want to act in this way. One ought to honor one's promise, for instance, because this obligation matters to oneself in par ticular, not simply for the reason that anyone ought to do so. Virtue for Nietzsche thus depends on the irreducible first-person stance of felt meaning. According to Nagel, we need to distinguish knowledge that a bat navigates by echo location, for instance, from knowing what it is like to be a bat.11 For Nietzsche, one could do what one ought for the reason that one ought without being moral, if the actions lack significance or importance for oneself in particular. This is not a matter of suiting one's narrowly per sonal interest. A virtuous person in a situation requiring her to do something rather than nothing typically asks what she ought to do given how she in par ticular feels, not simply what anyone, in the third person, ought to do regard less of such feelings. Thus she keeps a promise because fulfilling such an obligation matters to her even if she does not benefit and if, when called on to fulfill it, she is disinclined, through weariness, for example. To suppose that what Nietzsche calls "passion" is merely such capricious inclination</page><page sequence="10">34 David Campbell would imply a contradiction. Thus to say that his ethics is narrowly egoistic rather than more broadly self-regarding, if such a distinction may be admit ted for present purposes, would be too simple. In some ways, Nietzsche's theory resembles intuitionism. The word "red," for instance, is descriptive, but a person blind from birth could not appro priately request an account either of its content or of why it must apply to red things. Somewhat similarly, one simply sees that one ought to keep one's promise, for example. What is particular to oneself on this theory is an intel lectual as opposed to a sensory perception. For Nietzsche, however, ont feels that this obligation matters. Intuitionists fail to explain why one would want to act on one's moral knowledge, but if, as for Nietzsche, one cares about one's obligations, such caring explains one's subsequent actions. Nietzsche often contrasted his position with Christianity yet ignored, or failed to spot, an affinity between his view that joyful passion for life over comes its inherent senselessness and the Christian view that we can be grate ful for life despite evil. He enlivens his account of emotional "health" by opposing it to religious feeling, which he misrepresents as typically feeble and morbid. He would have been more accurate if he had said that Christianity is in his terms "healthy," the highest expression of will to power. Natural feel ings are for Christianity occasions for rejoicing so far as they are consistent with respecting persons, that is, they avoid malice, lust, envy, and so on; we can be glad for life though we tend to feel these things and, in addition, suf fer pain and tragedy. Somewhat as for Nietzsche, one welcomes the eternal recurrence of one's life, such gratitude is a comprehensive felt intention, not simply a particular natural feeling; though it is also a kind of gift, not sim ply chosen, whereas for Nietzsche good character requires heroic effort as well as choice. The grace of gratitude is also particular to oneself from the first-person standpoint, where Nietzsche wrongly assumed that Christianity imposes a universal altruistic ethic regardless of perspective. Nietzsche calls himself "antichrist" because he believes, to this extent wrongly, that he opposes Christianity. He further misrepresents Christians not only as debilitated but also as compensating for their debility by conceiving of moral rules as pro hibitions in order to repress passion. In fact, however, moral rules on their view mark the frontiers of regard for persons, and forgiving others restores the equality disturbed by trespass. Hence this notion of the person is not milk and water, as Nietzsche alleges, but offers a means of making sense of moral rules, and of uniting them under one concept: a unity that is not available to his theory that recognition of any such rule is simply a voluntary undertak ing. It also provides a more successful test of what is to count as a virtue if we suppose, contrary to his self-regarding theory, that virtue at least in part concerns one's bearing toward others, and thus presupposes relationship with them. In these respects his ethical theory is then deficient. One might also question whether virtue must depend on feeling, as virtue</page><page sequence="11">Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Meaning 35 ethicists maintain. Pride and humility, for instance, seem to be matters of judgment concerning one's abilities, whether or not one also swells with a feeling of pride or shrinks with a feeling of humility. As a virtue ethicist, Nietzsche could reply that pride and humility are tied to what matters or makes a difference to oneself, and character is in this sense a question of feel ing; we are deceived if we suppose that we act on judgment alone. An altru ist may believe that she acts on a judgment that the person has inherent value as an end, not simply from felt interest or inclination to which persons are mere means, and so monitors her feelings for traces of self-regard; but in so denying herself she in fact acts from a warped, ascetic kind of self-interested feeling. His point is not simply that she is deceived or muddled about her motives, but that judgment, unlike feeling, cannot of itself lead to action. The reason why altruism is illusion is that, as Aristotle and Hume put it, "intel lect" or "reason" alone cannot motivate us to act. A problem for Nietzsche, however, is that while such a judgment is plainly not a feeling, it is nonethe less typically accompanied by feeling. The Good Samaritan need not have felt compassion for the mugged Levite he assisted, but such feeling would clearly have been appropriate. Indeed, Nietzsche believes that the "noble" aid the unfortunate not from altruistic "pity" but "more from a superfluity of power," and such lack of sympathy is from an altruistic stance small-minded in a sense, contrary to his intention. This argument cannot be explored ade quately here, but it would follow that Nietzsche's weakness is not that he is a self-regarding virtue ethicist, but that he is a virtue ethicist at all. If virtu ous social feeling presupposes the judgment that the person has inherent worth, morality is not simply an expression of felt meaning or derived from it, as Nietzsche assumes. The notion of meaning is therefore less inclusive than he supposes. A wider question concerning the relation between judgment and feeling, which lies beyond the scope of this article is whether interpretation articu lates and shapes prior formless, "raw" emotion, or whether what we feel can not be separated in this way from what we think we feel, expect to feel, and so on. Nietzsche's other systematic work, The Birth of Tragedy, can like GM be regarded as offering a noncognitivist account of meaning; here he calls such an account "aesthetic." This work is the starting point for his perspectivism. When it was first published, Nietzsche held that an elite generates an inter pretation of the world that is then accepted universally. The world is, as he later described it, a seething, formless will to power. Only great artists such as the classical tragedians endure the threat of disorder and, without guide lines, create myths that provide a monolithic order. Their orgiastic "Dionysian" energy and formalizing "Apollinian" principle are at odds except when achiev ing order in an artwork. This process is emotional and hence inexplicable. For the slavish majority, meaning depends on making this aesthetic standard</page><page sequence="12">36 David Campbell its own.12 In this way, artists redeem our existence from its "terror and hor ror" and provide a socially unifying system of values (TBT, 1872). The aim is not beauty but coping, through pleasure in the harmony of beauty. Art does not represent an unintended underlying reality but provides a feeling of order that we regard as objective once we forget its origin. Art is therefore what Nietzsche calls a "metaphysical supplement" that "overcomes" nature and "justifies existence." Thus he reduces belief in an objective order to a need for control. However, in his introduction to the later, 1883 edition of The Birth of Tragedy, headed "Towards Self-Criticism," Nietzsche rejects his earlier view that values are universal. There are instead various particular "perspectives" (?452). Previously he held that the process of artistic creation is inexplica ble; now an artist's ability is no more miraculous than that of an inventor, scholar, or tactician (HH, ?163). The source of value is therefore not the artist but his work, whose perspective requires us to rethink our lives. Art does not make a universal ideal of the best in us: rather, we interpret our best accord ing to our perspective. Anyone may contribute to the perspective of some tra dition or other, and realize "the hero concealed within" (JW, ?78). Nietzsche therefore first supposed that artists supply a framework of order and meaning that is objective relatively to the majority in the sense of being originally unified rather than particular to individuals. But he later supposed instead that anyone can contribute to our interpretation, and it is now partic ular to individuals and their traditions, even when it seems unified. Whether such perspectives are "strong" or excellent, or "weak" and poor, is not deter mined simply by arbitrary choice on voluntarist lines, as though Jack's hill could be Jill's pail, or murder wrong for Jack but right for Jill. A perspective is not merely tied to the individual's need for meaning but takes the form of a tradition or convention to which one contributes. Its criteria of meaning and value are not independent of individuals, yet are objective relatively to them as a tradition is public relatively to its contributors. In a similar way, moral motivation is particular to individuals yet connects with moral judg ment as general in form, and Nietzsche shows how these apparently opposed particular and universal standpoints can be reconciled. BT and GM together reveal an approach that leads to perspectivism. The term "perspective" has an optical sense, but Nietzsche does not mean that there is a world independent of us that is somehow ambiguous, or indeci pherable, or that all see differently, as a house can be viewed from different sides. He means rather that each has a different notion of "the world," a nar rative beguiling enough to be mistaken for truth. These perspectives may be both incommensurable and compatible, but their fundamental concepts, such the category of "thing," evidently converge. Nietzsche's emphasis on per spectival diversity and self-directing control makes him more liberal politi cally than in other modes, but his wider point is nonpolitical: each individual</page><page sequence="13">Nietzsche. Heidegger, and Meaning 37 relates to his world from within, not as a neutral observer with a 'View from nowhere." At the same time, Nietzsche is not a relativist who claims that sen tences are true or false only in relation to the parochial perspective they express. Thus any perspective can be criticized from another perspective, so long as doing so is not "offensive" (JW, ?335). But no perspective can be criticized from a supposedly "objective" standpoint that is above criticism rather than perspectival: there is no such Archimedean view. This has particularist ethical implications. Previously the artist was free to do as he likes: now all are free where justice is done by recognizing their par ticular contributions (HH, ?300). Once artists gave universal meaning, and justice was equity: now justice is "love with open eyes," giving each his due from his own perspective. This means treating contributors justly, not per sons equally: Nietzsche consistently rejects such equality. We need this sense of justice to grow in everyone and the instinct for violence to weaken. Further, justice is tied to self-realization, which can take heroic effort, so that a judg ment is an exercise of power, and true if it fits a living perspective; hence tra ditions no longer become ossified, but ideas can be reviewed and invented (GM, ?155). This view of justice, as regard for each perspective according to its "strength," suggests an interplay between liberty and equality that partly subsumes, rather than fully supplants, Nietzsche's earlier view that a vision ary elite determines the rules of justice. Strength now lies in autonomy as well as passion. Autonomy consists in freely choosing a personal "style" that integrates conflicting feelings into "an artistic plan," that is, a sustainable order of pleasures (JW, ?290). One's choice cannot be justified safely in advance, for instance by preconceived rules; it involves risk and self-overcoming, as distinct from self-preservation. Since one shapes one's narrative, it is an artwork; values such as honesty and integrity are aesthetic, not moral or religious. One develops a life-enhancing structure of satisfactions by doing what one in particular cares about. Gifted, proud, integrated, and resolute, one's sustained joy in living is attractive. One does not thwart felt concerns and desires but interprets them so as to "become what you are," that is, authentic or "strong" (D, ?448). Autonomous respon sibility is also solitary, unlike the relational responsibility of a master or slave, for instance; Thus Spake Zarathrustra speaks of a solitary rambler on icy peaks. One detaches oneself from sociocultural forms and ties, including the language in which one expresses oneself and the criteria of concepts in it, in order to determine what one's own passions are and express them in a proj ect. Autonomy does not imply independence from such forms, since passions do not arise in a vacuum and projects involve direct or indirect relationships. Somewhat similarly, a passion for football, for instance, implies teamwork and rules; a researcher relies on professional controls, the contributions of other scholars and a shared specialized vocabulary, and asks others to trust him.13 Virtue then concerns an individual's relation to herself as self-deter</page><page sequence="14">38 David Campbell mining, true to herself, and so on, not her relation to others; but while self interpretation plays a central role in Nietzsche's account of virtue, this does not entail that she can just choose either herself or her character: not only is good character won by long hard labor, as noted earlier, but she also does not just choose the ethical language in which she expresses herself and the cri teria of concepts in it, as for Humpty Dumpty words mean just what he wants them to mean. Although Nietzsche takes an aesthetic rather than a religious view of val ues, his shift from a universal to a particularist stance has a religious ana logue. The medieval world picture was transmitted downward to the majority by a priestly hierarchy, and claimed a universality that ruled out dissent; later the priesthood embraced all believers, whatever their particular experience and point of view. Nietzsche somewhat similarly argues that an elite, unified sense of the world leads to social instability and mediocrity; excellence or virtue and social harmony depend on perspectival diversity. This analogy is confirmed by his evoking medieval practices such as self-flagellation to attack altruism as ascetic, though weakened by the fact that both earlier and later religious doctrines demand self-denying altruism. Previously, Nietzsche had asserted that culture depends on slavery. He does not now do so, not simply because he wants individuals to be treated justly but also because he no longer assumes uniform standards and needs the mas ter-slave distinction to explain them. His target is still the "objectivist," cog nitivist theory that moral judgments are true if they fit "moral facts" such as that lying, stealing, and killing are wrong. He rejects the theory that these are facts, as distinct from the nontheoretical belief that the actions are wrong: we can attach no sense to the notion of such a nonsensory "fact" or knowl edge of it. Indeed objectivists themselves differ in what they call right or good, reflecting different agendas. The source of difficulty is the assumption that knowledge claims in general, not only claims concerning ethics and the self, fit preconceived facts. Will to power is fundamentally a matter of physics and biology, but here, at the level of human motivation, it concerns knowl edge. Human beings feel a need for stable meaning and control and, to meet this need, create the "fiction" of things or natural units; thus knowledge claims reduce to interpretations of experience: "I set apart with high reverence the name of Heraclitus. When the rest of the philosopher crowd rejected the evi dence of the senses because these showed plurality and change, he rejected their evidence because they showed things as if they possessed duration and unity. . . . [He] will always be right in this, that being is an empty fiction."14 "The most dangerous of all errors," Nietzsche says in the Preface to Beyond Good and Evil, is "denying perspective." A piece of knowledge does not sim ply fit fact, but serves powers or interests, that is, will to power. "There are no things (?they are fictions invented by us)."15 The notion of an occurrent object presupposes its interpretation as an instrument that, according to GM,</page><page sequence="15">Nietzsche. Heidegger, and Meaning 39 we subsequently "name." For instance, what it is for a tree to be is explained by potentialities for, say, food, shelter, and fuel. We give meaning to judg ments about an actual tree by interpreting such potentialities as a group; it is not as though we could first reproduce the fact of there being a tree symbol ically in a judgment such as "This is a tree" and then investigate the predi cates. This direction of explanation also means that we first understand any object in relational terms: for example, wood is first serviceable, then cellu lar. Judgments ascribing physical properties depend for their meaning on cer tain sorts of relational judgments, and these in turn depend for their meaning on interpretative coping skills. The same statement may then both correspond with fact and provide an adequate interpretation, and the questions what the thing also is "in itself," and whether it also exists "in itself," apart from inter pretation, are misleading. Hence talk of "things" is "fictional" or conven tional. A routine objection to what we may here loosely call linguistic conventionalism is that while it may purport to explain the variability of con cepts such as "east" or "work," it fails to explain the invariability of logical, mathematical, and categorial concepts. Nietzsche could possibly reply on perspectivist lines that such a dichotomy need not be exhaustive: there can be indefinitely many incommensurable but compatible kinds of linguistic convention, each with its own cluster of public criteria and type and degree of rigidity or flexibility. This reply fails, however, so far as invariability is not a type or degree of rigidity. Nietzsche claimed to have "abolished Being." He does not mean that noth ing exists: will to power exists, and is finally all that there is. He is not an idealist who believes that the mind creates a world from nothing, so to speak; yet it is down to us that things are serviceable, and thus that they are as they are. To this extent his view is both controlling and nonvoluntarist at the same time; in parallel fashion, he holds that words mean what we want them to mean conventionally rather than voluntaristically. We ordinarily speak of "existence" in connection with spatiotemporal, causally related objects, how ever, not with their prior conditions such as will to power. Thus to say that an object exists is not to indicate its independence but to express in conven tional form our intention to speak of unity, causality, and so on. In this way, Nietzsche defends ordinary talk of real things against doctrines such as Plato's concerning an unintended metaphysical reality. The theory of will to power both explains such ordinary talk in the sense of supporting it as useful illu sion, and at the same time explains such metaphysics in the contrary sense of undermining pernicious illusion. Nietzsche's aim, however, is not merely to distinguish useful and pernicious illusions. Even while vindicating ordi nary talk, he does not leave it undisturbed, but finally reduces it to a mani festation of will to power. Like "metaphysics," it attempts to control knowledge and truth by conceiving of things as existing independently. He therefore replaces both ordinary and metaphysical ontological assumptions with an</page><page sequence="16">40 David Campbell account of their origin, namely, the attempt to objectify Being "anthropo morphically."16 "We can say nothing about the thing itself.... A quality exists for us. . . . Knowing is nothing but working with the favourite metaphors. But in this case first nature and then the concept are anthropomorphic. . . . We produce beings (Wesen)."11 Hence any belief that Being, knowledge, and truth are independent of art, that is, the art of interpretation, is illusion.18 To say that there are things with properties and so on makes sense only as mean ing that it is as (/"there are such things.19 Talk of things is metaphorical, not as hinting at their independence, but in conveying the intention to talk in this way. Nietzsche therefore explains such talk by its force or "will to power." This is not to say that linguistic meaning reduces to rhetoric, but that it is a matter of conventional "naming," as he calls it in GM. Since there is in the end only will to power, it is in this sense impossible to speak with a straight face about knowledge of "Being" or objective truth and reality. Nietzsche's defense of ordinary talk of things might appear to contradict his view that these are fictions; further, he might be supposed to offer a the ory of truth that tries but fails to resolve this contradiction. But there is no such contradiction if we assume that he aims at a theory of meaning, not of truth. For he can then be said to take the coherent line that truth is a product of interpretation, useful for ordinary talk but, philosophically, a fiction rather than a subject matter to which one could refer literally, or about which one could intelligibly theorize. "Metaphysicians" suppose that knowledge is con tingent on a foundation of truth; but truth is on the contrary a contingent, not foundational, notion. The notion of an unintended reality is a perspective, but one that lacks meaning: a fiction in the sense of a lie. There could be infinitely many such interpretations of experience: Plato, Locke, and Kant, for example, all in their different ways assert an unintended reality. Nietzsche thus "abolishes" the notion of reality as the subject matter of metaphysics in Plato's mode of read ing off, and recasts it as an expression of perspective without the imprimatur of fixed and final "truth." His suggestion is then that the criteria of knowl edge are aesthetic in that a perception is objective, not illusory, for instance, if it meets its implicit public criteria, somewhat as we are not misled about whether a certain painting by Rembrandt really is a work of art. A problem with the theory so expressed is that it fails to explain the difference between saying that the painting really is a work of art, not kitsch, for instance, and that it really is a painting, not, for instance, an illusion or hallucination. Nietzsche would reply, however, that this distinction has no systematic appli cation; it concerns only specific cases of deception, and any perspective can be criticized from the standpoint of another. Nagel points to a parallel contrast between "a sense that what you are doing is . . . important to you . . . [and that it is] important in a larger sense: impor tant, period."20 Such a "larger" meaning is not only synoptic and final, as</page><page sequence="17">Nietzsche. Heidegger, and Meaning 41 Nagel indicates: it seems also to have dramatic unity and heightening or ten sion, together with qualitative or emotional richness and depth. Thus for a romantic or pantheist, a landscape, for instance, can seem to convey a mes sage that does not quite form itself into words, having what might be called a quasi-literal symbolic meaning somewhat like a printed page, as distinct from metaphorical meaning whether as frost patterns look like leaves, for instance, or as when we say it is "as if the landscape has meaning. For Nietzsche, on the other hand, the world is a disorderly will that surges up in us as a superabundant energy and feeling of health or wholeness. The narra tives we subsequently invent have internal unity and give a deceptive sense of truth but, as merely perspectival, have no systematic application. Heidegger, unlike Nietzsche, connects such a feeling of wholeness with intimations of universal rather than perspectival significance. At the same time, he followed Nietzsche's noncognitivism; whether such meaning should instead be under stood cognitively, as romantics, for instance, assume, is a wider question that cannot be investigated here. Will to power, then, is "meaning" for Nietzsche not only in this specialized sense but also in the senses in which we speak variously of the "meaning" of art, religion, science, politics, morality, and the self, as well as of knowledge, language, being or objectivity, and truth. Heidegger The theory of meaning that we have attributed to Nietzsche was made more explicit by Heidegger. We need not, however, examine his debt or expound his theory in more detail than is required to show where his view of tech nology diverges in general from Nietzsche's theory of will to power, as the background to his more specific criticisms. According to Heidegger, I lack reason to exist in the sense of actualizing a preconceived end, yet try to meet such contingency by actualizing 'one' (das Man), that is, by acting as anyone would in my circumstances; however, I am authentic or genuinely myself only so far as I interpret and choose pos sibilities particular to myself. So far he and Nietzsche agree, but where Nietzsche demands solitude, Heidegger assumes social interaction. I cannot perceive my possibilities except against a background of universal everyday concerns, so that I have little option but to remain mostly inauthentic. He ties this notion of self-interpretation to interpretation in general.21 To exist as a thing is to stand out or emerge into disclosure, through interpretation; to exist as a human being is to stand out from oneself as interpreter to receive and express the existence of particular things. Man is 'being-in-the-world' since subject and object are united in him before they are distinguished (BT, 33). Heidegger's metaphor for the mind is a forest clearing, where light enters</page><page sequence="18">42 David Campbell unhindered and surrounding trees and other objects are disclosed; the dis closure of things, and of man to whom they are disclosed, are co-original. Self-interpretation is thus tied to interpretation of things as instruments to felt concerns; Heidegger calls concern in general 'care' (Sorge). Aristotle attributed Being only by analogy in the various categories of thing, relation, and so forth,22 but care lets us make a project of ourselves in which every thing has its meaning, so unifying the meaning of Being. We cannot be said simply to believe (or desire, think, and so on) but must, logically, believe something or other; hence phenomena can have no under lying unintended reality. Objects are in the first instance available or handy for projects (zuhanden), not simply occurrent (vorhanden): judgments ascrib ing physical properties depend for their meaning on certain sorts of relational judgments, and these on interpretative coping skills, that is, on "technology." The term "technology" might suggest only bridges, computers, and so on, but Heidegger has in mind techne in general, that is, art or skill as a form of knowing. Here knowing is not conceived simply as an act of reading off that is complete at any moment, but as implying a degree of understanding that can be greater or less, depending as it does on a dynamic process of first interpreting potentialities instrumentally, then interpreting these instruments as having their own potentialities for further uses, and so on in a kind of pro gressive loop. Experience has a fivefold structure that depends on art and thus on technology (BT, 97-104). Tools form a context, such as a factory, to which products give unity; nature yields material and power that are "before" us in leading to their uses; science aims at a theoretical understanding of material objects; and intersubjectivity, that is, the social organization of labor, means that there is always someone who knows what a particular tool is for. This structure concerns production and utility, and lets us cope by distin guishing what is and is not serviceable, and the human from the nonhuman or natural. Thus it provides a spatiotemporal context: objects are "near" if available and serviceable, "distant" if not; they have a "past" as already mat tering to us, a "future" as ahead of us in roles, and are "present" as disclosed in tasks. What is initially indeterminate is assigned a role: how things such as leather or shoes are depends on our interest in there being such things, that is, as Heidegger says, on the meaning of their Being. Technology "lets things be" as instruments, much as will to power does for Nietzsche; but for Heidegger, unlike Nietzsche, things are not reducible to instrumentality. Our tendency to reduce things to mere means is itself an expression of will to power, and we need to rescue a sense of the being of things from this tendency. For instance, most of us do not know how com puters work, and so we have power without relating to them as objects over against us. The premodern view, derived from Aristotle, was less subject to this tendency. Artifacts such as tools were only means to ends determined independently; for instance, money has no value inherently but only as a</page><page sequence="19">Nietzsche Heidegger, and Meaning 43 means to other goods.23 Thus preindustrial technology could reveal the struc ture of means and ends. The danger is now that the distinction between means and ends disappears in technological systems.24 Technology has become self referential, having a role only for rational organization, so that ends are sub sumed to means and instrumentality. The problem is control with a view not to utility but to power. Nietzsche failed to see that such control presents a problem. Technology "enframes" or gathers together and arranges nature while rejecting the deviant and recalcitrant. This involves a will to mastery that thwarts and conceals rather than discloses the Being of things and of human beings (QT, 300ff.): "Everywhere everything is ordered to stand by [as] standing-reserve [and] no longer stands over against us as an object [but] disappears into objectlessness" (QT, 298-300). For example, the system of air travel is from the technological standpoint a process of control. Aircraft are not objects in their own right; similarly, the passengers merely so to speak fuel the system and are not subjects in their own right. One may perhaps enjoy the sort of happiness that consumption and control can yield, but one has no basis for a goal or narrative that could give a sense of oneself. Technological control is, in other words, overbearing. We are at our most vul nerable nowadays, encountering ourselves as essentially meaningless and merely anxious about what we are. "Nowhere does man today any longer encounter himself, that is, his essence" (QT, Krell, 308). Yet this anxiety is our "saving power" since it indicates our plight, and we can counteract will to mastery by reflecting on our role in technology. We are not mere means within a technological process but have a hand in it; conversely, we can inter pret wood, for instance, as supplying cellulose to make paper (299-300), yet it is not down to us that wood has this potentiality. Further, it is not simply down to us if we interpret nature for our purposes, but also a potentiality in us to do so. Thus we can be open to the meaning of things and of human exis tence, which are then illuminated and articulated, and we are enlightened. The problem with technology is psychological, and only indirectly philo sophical, in that we are disposed by the history of Western philosophy since Socrates to think of things simply as instruments (QT; also OWA, 162-66). Plato explained changeable ordinary things as copying their eternally pres ent Forms; for an object to be depends on an unintended realm of Being. This tendency to objectify Being as inert "presence" was modified by Descartes so that for something to be means for it to be present to the human subject.25 For scientists, the role of the human subject was then to extend knowledge in order to win benign control of nature. In this way we come to reduce Being and knowledge to instrumentality; Plato's defense of Being led to its aboli tion. Heidegger thinks that Nietzsche is right to see Western philosophy as finally nihilistic, but wrong to see Plato's aim of defending Being as mis guided.26 Nietzsche's perspectives merely express psychological attitudes, whether concerning worldviews (Weltanschauungen) such as a particular</page><page sequence="20">44 David Campbell Dasein might assume, or systems of particular historical epochs such as Platonism, Aristotelianism, Cartesianism, and so forth. That is, philosophi cal systems as perspectives are what Heidegger calls "ontic," not as Nietzsche supposes ontologies to which his reduction could apply. We escape Nietzsche's nihilism by providing an alternative foundational account of Being to Plato's,27 namely, that technology provides not only control but also truth in the sense of phenomenological disclosure of Being (aletheia). Thus, for instance, water is experienced as wet, even though this experience is inseparable from its instrumentality as thirst-quenching, lubricating, and so forth. Such a notion of truth as disclosure contrasts with truth as independ ent of the human subject.28 We saw that for Nietzsche will to power and eternal recurrence have no telos, but subsume ends as mere means, and are in this nihilistic sense cir cular. Yet willing eternal recurrence makes truthfulness or integrity, creativ ity and joy, possible, and thus the annihilation of nihilism. If his theory of will to power is applied consistently, however, these ends also are subsumed as mere means, and in this respect their claim to "overcome" such nihilism is not sustained. Heidegger's reading therefore fits better than Nietzsche's insistence on integrity and creativity might seem to suggest. Heidegger agrees that things are means, but not that they are mere means. Nietzsche reduces talk of the Being of things to instrumentality, but we cannot talk about a world at all, even to say as Nietzsche does that it is metaphor and illusion, without an interpretative structure of ends, and in general of things, in so to speak their own right. Nietzsche does not reduce Being and truth to interpreted meaning but to meaninglessness. Five detailed comments on Nietzsche arise from Heidegger's discussion of technology. These concern truth, the categories, existence, and choice. First, the process of interpretation connects us to things as intentional objects and lets us say what it means for them and us to exist. For both writers, such a process implies 'Becoming' as distinct from 'Being.' But for Nietzsche, Becoming is prior to Being: the process of interpretation makes talk of objects provisionally possible, but finally impossible. For Heidegger, on the other hand, the process of Becoming does not make Being only provisionally pos sible, but lets beings or things finally be. In Aristotle's terminology, but revers ing his direction of explanation, the potentiality to be a thing makes its actualization possible. Nietzsche tried to reduce Being-talk to a mythopoeic psychological and physiological process; but if each particular thing is merely a phase, so to speak, in a process of control, nothing can be said to exist in its own right, and true-or-false judgments about things are impossible. Thus will to mastery has no grasp of Being or truth. What Nietzsche thinks is mere talk formed by felt interests, for Heidegger concerns what there is, namely, the Being of objects disclosed in a world not simply of our making. Mind and world clarify each other in a "hermeneutic circle" of what he calls "objec</page><page sequence="21">Nietzsche Heidegger, and Meaning 45 tive subjectivity."29 For instance, it is not down to us that a stone is service able as a makeshift hammer, though it is not a hammer unless we so inter pret it. How we read the world is not how it is, like interpreting a Rorschach inkblot. Tautologically, the hammer cannot be said to exist as a hammer before it so exists; yet we do not bring hammers and computers into existence out of nothing. Thus Heidegger is not an idealist who holds that to be is to be perceived, and that the notion or narrative of "the world" is simply a yarn spun as it were from nothing by the mind and wrongly credited with truth.30 There must be something to interpret prior to our interpreting, a potentiality not of our making and not fully under our control. Nietzsche fails to draw this distinction: will to power has two aspects at once, that which we inter pret and the activity of interpreting it. For Heidegger, on the other hand, we free something that is a potential tool to become an actual tool, and products, nature, theory, and social organization for their actualization. Up to a point, Heidegger's argument follows roughly Nietzschean lines. Aristotle held that the actuality of a thing is its end (telos), fulfilling and thus explaining the potentiality to be that thing. For Heidegger as for Nietzsche, the reverse is the case: potentiality, not actuality, explains the thing. We can understand things by means of the art (techne) of interpreting and so dis closing their "possibility" or potentiality. What it is for a tree to be is explained by potentialities for, say, food, shelter, and fuel; their actualization as fruit, planks, and firewood derives from these (speaking logically rather than causally). We do not first picture, as it were, or reproduce symbolically, the fact that this is a tree in the judgment, "This is a tree," and then investigate the potentialities for fruit and so on. Rather, by interpreting a certain set of potentialities as instrumental we give meaning to judgments concerning the actual tree. Hence producing meaning is prior to reproducing facts in judg ments. For Heidegger, however, such an account leads to a notion of irre ducible truth, whereas Nietzsche understands truth reductively and finally eliminates it; thus his theory is incomplete. Indeed any argument that mean ing is prior to truth has to fail, since these are equiprimordial. In other words, even if Nietzsche explains the sense in which a particular hammer, for instance, might really be an artwork in some genre, this is not what is meant by say ing that it really is an object as distinct from an illusion. Heidegger in effect escapes this sort of charge since, on his view, how a stone can be a hammer for certain purposes is not as for Nietzsche simply down to us but, as he puts it, "withdrawn" from us. Similarly, Heidegger broadly agrees that truth in the case of occurrent mate rial objects is a property of judgments that correspond with fact. For this test to apply, such judgments must already have a meaning, disclosed in under standing objects as available. For instance, I do not need to thematize a cer tain hammer as an object unless it breaks and needs to be repaired. Its felt meaning, as meeting needs, is a prior condition of rational assumptions and</page><page sequence="22">46 David Campbell procedures concerning the fit of judgments about it with fact. 'The pointing out which assertion does is performed on the basis of what has already been disclosed" (BT, 199). This is not to say that the reverse does not hold in an oblique way: if we are to understand p, for instance, the statement "This is a hammer," there must be a degree of agreement as to whether is true. (Wittgenstein makes this sort of point in Philosophical Investigations, 2A?-A2.) But the same statement may then function both as a judgment and as an inter pretation, and it is misleading to ask what the thing is "in itself," and whether it also exists "in itself," aside from appearances.31 But Heidegger goes on to maintain in effect that Nietzsche wrongly confuses the question of how a judgment such as "This coat is yellow" is formed, that is, of the conditions of its having meaning, with the question whether it is true or false. Nietzsche's reductive theory implies that the perception of color, for instance, is illusory because it relies on interpretation, and the distinction between truth and illu sion applies to specific cases, not systematically. Heidegger contends in reply that the fact that I can experience an illusion, such that it is false to say that I see a yellow coat, does not mean that it is ultimately false, a fiction or mere convention to speak of yellow coats, or generally of colored three-dimen sional objects. The second comment concerns categorial structure. For Nietzsche, will to power is inherently undifferentiated, and objects as natural units derive from it, just as they reduce to it. A difficulty he faces is that unity or self identity seems to be underived and irreducible. As Heidegger puts it, "Over against appearance being is the enduring . . . the always identical" (IM, 202). On Heidegger's theory, by contrast, interpretation discloses the mean ing of an orange, say, as a natural unit that is also edible, but does not make it either edible or a unit. Thus the unity is underived, and interpretation lets us understand the underived identity of individual things. In Heidegger's terms, the categories of availability and occurrence are equiprimordial with such identity, so that it is interdependent with but not derived from them. Heidegger therefore explains the structure that experience must have if it is to be intelligible, in accordance with the categories of "thing," "prop erty," "relation" and so on. As he says, "The goal of all ontology is a doc trine of categories" (IM, 187). He does not aim to provide a complete list of categories, but simply to establish an irreducible categorial structure. Nietzsche, on the other hand, explains categorial structure provisionally but finally undermines it. Third, one could also extrapolate from Heidegger's theory to reply in a similar way to Nietzsche's treatment of existence or Being. Nietzsche explains the existence of things by their origin in the process of 'Becoming,' that is, will to power. A difficulty is that existence seems underived and irreducible. In Heidegger's words, "Over against becoming being is permanence ... the already-there" (IM, 202). This problem is compounded for Nietzsche if he</page><page sequence="23">Nietzsche. Heidegger, and Meaning 47 assumes that the process of will to power exists, since its 'being' is then log ically prior to its 'becoming' : "Art as will to semblance is the supreme con figuration of will to power. But the latter, as the basic character of beings, as the essence of reality, is in itself that Being which wills itself to be Becoming."32 Thus Nietzsche's account of things as "fictions" may or may not tell us some thing about what is meant by saying that things exist, but it fails to explain what it is for them to exist, so far as that concerns what we must necessar ily, not simply conventionally, say if we are to say anything at all. Heidegger makes these points concerning truth, the categories, and exis tence without offering extended supporting argument, at least in their imme diate context. One might wonder whether in that case his own doctrine of unified meaning escapes Nietzsche's reduction. Further, Nietzsche replaces a nihilistic response to contingency with an affirmative response, so sus taining his reduction. Thus his strategy for dealing with a nihilistic attitude is also an attitude, that is, the same kind of thing, on the principle that it takes a thief to catch one, so to speak. In these terms, Heidegger's strategy seems less effective: he adds a different sort of thing, namely, a doctrine of cate gories, in order to avoid Nietzsche's reduction (on the ground that we can not conceive of a world, even as contingent, without them). If all of this suggests a standoff, however, the dispute does not quite end here: there are also doubts about the reductive form of Nietzsche's argument. For Nietzsche, our ascribing objective authority to morality is caused by debil ity; hence any such authority is illusory. Similarly, the belief that things are independent of us is an illusion explained by our need for order and control. These claims assume that a causal explanation for a belief invalidates it by reducing the explanandum to the explanans. In some such way, a man's claim that whisky is good for him might be redefined as no more than an expres sion of his desire to drink, that is, as an oblique comment on himself, not the comment on whisky it might seem. But a difficulty with this is that a correct causal explanation need not either invalidate or validate a belief; in that case, there is no ground for reducing the belief to its explanation. Being motivated by a desire to drink does not make a man's belief that whisky is good for him either fanciful, if, for example, alcohol assists tired heart muscles, or alter natively true, if, for instance, he is an alcoholic. Indeed reductionism as a form of argument is self-defeating, since eliminating the explanandum also by implication eliminates the explanans, there being nothing then that does any explaining. Whether or not these objections are conclusive, there does seem to be a residual problem between Nietzsche and Heidegger that is wider than their stated arguments. We conclude with the fourth comment, which concerns choice. Disclosure depends on intentional acts, and Heidegger seems to have inferred wrongly in Being and Time that this involves the will or choice. He went on to regard</page><page sequence="24">48 David Campbell disclosure as instead an event or occurrence (Ereignis), unlike an action that is willed or chosen.33 His account of meaning here is often described as "non voluntarist," but Heidegger does not mean that choice determines character without labor so much as that choice is now uncontrolling. We do not "seize" the meaning of Being and "wrest" it from everyday prattle as in Being and Time; instead, we "wait" with docility and "listen" attentively to Being. His declaration that "Only a god can save us" is not religious but metaphorical: in some such way, Plato did not will his profound effect but was inspired.34 Heidegger concludes that "Man is not the lord of beings. Man is the shep herd of Being" (LH, 221). We can become less controlling by using the pre Socratics and poets such as H?lderlin to illuminate the world and bring the meaning of Being into resolution (Entschlossenheit) in the sense perhaps of optical focus; though the fine arts and similar activities are "marginal" and cannot easily become the focus of attention in a technological age. Thus Heidegger distanced himself further from the controlling will to power that he found in Nietzsche. Heidegger assumed that his general theory is connected somehow with his social and political beliefs, and some commentators look between the lines throughout his writings for the National Socialist agenda that is explicit in places (such as IM, 42, 50). We need now to look at these beliefs as the back ground to his 'turn' (Kehre) toward an uncontrolling account of technology. One early anxiety about technology was that factory workers were in effect an extension of machines; today employees are often defined as "human resources," for instance, and thus by implication treated like resources such as raw materials and equipment. Heidegger thought that in such ways our humanity or, as he said, our spirituality is distorted, marginalized, and ignored. A fuller discussion of his view might well consider whether there is one prob lem here or various sorts of problems, some perhaps more theoretical than others. Some questions might well be political, concerning pay and condi tions of work, for instance, or the right not to be dismissed unfairly; others managerial, concerning, for instance, damage to an employee in her relations with colleagues and clients by arbitrarily changing her role. Heidegger, how ever, assumed that there is one general kind of problem and, initially, that it is political, though having to do with what we now call moral education rather than with rights and the like in employment. He upheld the folk values of crafted implements and rustic cosiness (Gem?tlichkeit), suggesting that indus trial rationalization destroys the sense of an enduring community and place with a common language and history.35 He meant that "ethnic" Germans could lead mankind back to true spirituality. (Ironically, this folksy reaction soon found itself industrializing ways of killing people, in battle and "camps") Human meaning is in any case essentially historical, not Archimedean; accord ingly, a certain nostalgia is true to civilized values and conserves the best in us. Indeed in harking back to the pre-Socratics he went beyond nostalgia;</page><page sequence="25">Nietzsche Heidegger, and Meaning 49 and his attempts to ground such meaning historically in language were often weakened by overstretched "etymology," as he liked to call it. National Socialism replaced the conservative aim of humanity with the reactionary means of a deceptively comforting, in fact heartless, nostalgia for "German" values. But having sought a "third way" (or Third Reich) between the technological cultures of capitalism and communism (37-39, 45-46), Heidegger distanced himself from this project. It is not clear whether he did so because it brought out the least truthful and worst in many people, contrary to his intention. In any event, he now wrote about bridges, for exam ple, without bias either against the motorway sort or in favor of the rustic sort (BDT, 330). Technological progress cannot be undone, and improves the human lot in many ways. He accepted also that folk values are not easily recovered, given the dominance of economic thinking, with its lucrative will to mastery. (Even nostalgia is now sold as "heritage") If high-rise flats delete a sense of place and community, the Black Forest farmhouse was not a suit able model for postwar reconstruction, and he focused on the "homelessness" not of Germans but of man as interpreter standing out from things in the world (339). The problem of sustaining our humanity in the face of technol ogy now had an apolitical, uncontrolling solution. Heidegger might seem ambivalent in favoring first preindustrial but later industrial technology, and first a political but later an apolitical solution. He remains unequivocal, however, in believing, like Nietzsche, that technolog ical interests, powers, and processes are fundamental to knowledge, and, unlike Nietzsche, that what is known on this basis cannot be reduced to them. His attempt to reaffirm the unity of interpretative meaning included, for a time at least, a reaction against cultural diversity in line with National Socialist repression of dissent, which contrasts with Nietzsche's perspectivism; at the same time, if we assume that National Socialism assimilates truth to politi cal power, Heidegger could not have supported this movement consistently with denying in this way (as I suggest he did) that truth is in general reducible to power. For present purposes therefore, I shall assume that his political tastes and character do not ultimately affect his general theory, while recog nizing that this is disputed.36 Being and Time distinguished five elements in experience that give it an instrumental structure: tools, products, nature, theory, and intersubjectivity. Heidegger's later work, however, speaks of a noninstrumental "fourfold" structure.37 The formal art of engineering, for instance, lets us build a bridge as a means to cross a river, but also points to the informal arts by which we set up the bridge as a landmark. As Heidegger says, the bridge "gathers" places in a "region," so disclosing the surrounding world in which we find our orientation. This "gathering" explains the unity implied in the notion of a world, not simply the metric separation and layout of objects. He describes these four "corners" poetically: the bridge gathers together the river's banks;</page><page sequence="26">50 David Campbell "the heavens" from which the water comes; men to whom it gives passage; and "gods," sometimes supposedly "there in effigy," for instance, at a road side calvary (323ff.). These four elements indicate related foci of meaning that concern us aside from consumption and control. The bridge also has a role more fundamental than to mark a point in geometric space, namely, as a landmark that "opens" a place and apportions space by orientation to var ious ends that are not merely quantitative (143ff.). Indeed space, as mere geo metric extension, "contains no spaces and no places. We never find in it any locations, that is, things of the kind the bridge is" (333). The fourfold does not simply supersede the fivefold: Heidegger does not now deny a role for instrumental thinking. But our relation to the world is primarily a matter of what he calls "dwelling." Knowing is the art by which one orientates oneself, and this was a matter in Being and Time of interpret ing instruments, but now of "dwelling" (OWA, 162-66). Such dwelling, or sense of place, is an event of 'opening' (Ereignis); a 'free gift,' not an aim of action, regulatory ideal, reward, or seal of approval. Here meaning is not willed and controlling, but "thinking is thanking": we can be grateful for our potentiality for interpreting things and for their potential for interpretation, not merely active in so interpreting them as Nietzsche supposes. A sense of place depends on art but lacks the will to mastery that accompanies arts. Dwelling cannot be reduced to the function of buildings within, say, a com mercial framework, or to architectural styles or other cultural forms. Rather, it involves various sorts of interest or end: social and economic ends such as accommodation; topography, which determines, for instance, where a bridge is to cross a river; historical community, to which the universal notion of "man" is now central, not simply the local and ethnic "nation"; and religion, even when unspecific, or "pushed wholly aside" (331). An account of such religion would require further discussion, but Heidegger evidently has in mind some notion of divinity, that is, something more specif ically religious than, say, contemplation of nature. This divinity could not be equated with Being as a sort of general, immaterial object, a notion that he rejects. For those who believe that man is God's image, however, his account of the human subject as tied intentionally to objects, rather than detached from them on Cartesian lines, is perhaps a guide. A sense of place thus implies a single environment linking physical, social, historical, and religious concerns, aside from control and consumption. Such holism does not make Heidegger totalitarian since it concerns dwelling, not control in the context of either political dissent or moral responsibility. Heidegger's point is rather that we have one world and relate to it from within; like Nietzsche, he believes that we are not neutral observers with a "view from nowhere." In addition, however, the interests that so tie us to the world are not reducible to control. Thus Heidegger's nonvoluntarism does not mean that our concept of the world is no longer tied to interest, but that he rein</page><page sequence="27">Nietzsche. Heidegger, and Meaning 51 terprets interest so as to siphon off that element of control that, he thinks, persisted within the doctrine of Being and Time. The language appropriate to this later account of being-in-the-world is more poetic than philosophical. Heidegger's writing can be lyrical when describ ing a bridge or farmhouse, for instance, a Greek temple (OWA, 168-70), or peasant life (162-64). Such poetic thinking is not aconceptual in the way that musical thinking and feeling, for example, cannot be put into words. But poetic notions do not here simply convey the intention to talk in this way, as for Nietzsche talk of Being is metaphorical. For while such poetic talk cannot be analyzed philosophically like talk of material objects, it is no less literal in the sense of being objectivist, underived, and, as Heidegger would say, pri mordial rather than secondary.38 Hence we should perhaps say that these ends indicate the structure of noninstrumental meaning quasi-metaphorically. Heidegger holds that whatever exists "unfolds itself to language," and "man brings it to language," contrary to the linguistic conventionalism that we have attributed to Nietzsche (LH: Krell, 239^0). This linguistic "unfolding" might seem to present a problem since some ways of knowing are aconceptual, as we have just noted, while philosophy cannot be articulated except in words. Thus technological disclosure seems to be preconceptual where in their different ways the fine arts and philosophy are not. Further, as quasi-metaphorical his "fourfold" is not susceptible of conceptual analysis. For Heidegger, however, "language" need not be verbal only, and he cites semaphore as an instance. Heidegger speaks of "the holy." This is not anything narrowly religious: he glosses it as the "hale," implying a sense of wholeness or health, remi niscent in some ways of Nietzsche's "will to power." He hints at the arcadian sense the peasant's world can make, however, bleak, for instance, "when she takes off her shoes late in the evening" in what he insensitively calls "deep but healthy fatigue" (BDT, 163). He also claims that "as soon as man gives thought to his homelessness, it is a misery no longer" (339), presumably because reflection on our role in technology clarifies the limitations of will, so that "thinking is thanking" and so on. Perhaps indeed we sense such whole ness rarely, and more in promise than attainment or, in view of natural and moral evil, as simply missing.39 However that may be, Heidegger seems to mean that one senses wholeness not only qualitatively or emotionally, as, for instance, rich or bleak, but also as a necessary structured unity, where for Nietzsche a sense of health is simply a manifestation of an ultimately undif ferentiated will to power. Thus for Nietzsche, one creates nonutilitarian goals through enhanced vitality and makes sense of one's life as something brought under one's control. Felt meaning is fundamental and comprehensive. A prob lem he faces is that, as we saw earlier, felt meaning alone does not explain morality, for instance, contrary to his belief that he has explained morality away. Heidegger's argument that meaning is not only felt, as Nietzsche sup poses, but also is necessarily structured, lets him escape this sort of charge.</page><page sequence="28">52 David Campbell Meaning in life depends not simply on control but also on the irreducible context of "the meaning of Being"; we are not finally subject to power in nature and politics as for Nietzsche, but are above all answerable to truth. Nietzsche and Heidegger seem to agree, then, that Being and truth meet our need for order and meaning, and that the process of interpreting felt con cerns makes talk of objects possible. But for Nietzsche, such talk expresses the particular perspectives of a f?ssiparous will to power that, directly or indi rectly, subsumes objects to instrumentality and reduces our intentions to con sumption and control. Heidegger instead reaffirms Being and truth: the process of interpreting instruments for control discloses a unified categorial structure that is not reducible to this process, and gives us a sense of ourselves in a common environment with a shared history and a religious interest.40 University of Glasgow Notes 1.

I suggest that this problem is resolved if he is taken to offer a theory of meaning rather than of truth. 20. Thomas Nagel, What Does It All Mean? (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987), 101. Nagel analyzes what he calls "larger" meaning first as concerned with God, for instance, but then, confusingly, as a self-concerned "tendency to take ourselves too seriously." He con cludes that "life may be not only meaningless, but absurd"; but this is also confusing since say ing that life is absurd implies that the question whether life has a meaning itself has meaning, and is therefore to be taken seriously after all. Unlike Nietzsche and Heidegger, he does not con nect what he calls "meaning" with interpretation in general. 21. Martin Heidegger, Being and Time [BT], trans.

Heidegger assumed that he had distanced himself from Plato's alleged decline into par ticularism. Richard Rorty challenges this view of his relation to Plato: Heidegger's comments on "prattle" mean that he believed wrongly that he had attained a world-historical, Archimedean view in place of the "Western," Platonic view that knowledge is embedded in common linguis tic practices and related world-pictures (Richard Rorty, Essays on Heidegger and Others [vol. 2 of Philosophical Papers] [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991 ], part 1). David Hoy seems nearer the mark: on Heidegger's theory of Interpretation (Interpretieren), the notion of complete knowledge is incoherent (BT, sec. 31) (David Couzens Hoy, in Charles Guignon, ed., Companion to Heidegger [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993], esp. 174-77). In that case, Heidegger's objectivism could not have been Archimedean; he rejected the possibility of a "view from nowhere."</page><page sequence="30">54 David Campbell 28. Dick White holds that Heidegger opposes "thinking" and "willing" ("Heidegger on Nietzsche: The Question of Value," in Hugh J. Silverman and Donn Welton, ed., Postmodernism and Continental Philosophy [Albany: State University of New York, 1988], 116). This fails to take account of the complexity of a relationship in which "thinking" about objects is connected with but not reducible to "willing" instrumentality. White also points out that will to power is not the same in master and slave, and concludes that it is not one thing as Heidegger supposes. This ignores the congruence of the master's "strength" and the slave's "will to possess power," both of which White notes. 29. In "Letter on Humanism," Heidegger emphasizes that "'world' does not at all signify beings or any realm of beings but the openness of being" (Krell, 228). 30. William D. Blattner argues in Heidegger's Temporal Idealism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999) that in Being and Time Heidegger is a transcendental idealist about being as distinct from entities (253), but that by the time he wrote Contributions he had abandoned even this position (309). 31.

These structures are not categories in the sense of things and qualities. Heidegger dis tinguishes beings, that is, things or entities, as "ontic" from Being as "ontological" (BT, ? 1). To conceive of a thing as ontic is to think of it a priori as having a certain character such as its quantity or quality. Being is neither an entity nor the highest ontological category in the sense of everything in general, but the foundation of beings. To have an ontological interest in any thing is to think of it in relation to its Being, that is, as something disclosed rather than noth ing. On Heidegger's theory of interpretation, this disclosure concerns man as being-in-the-world. Thus as ontological, the five- and fourfold structures are a priori characteristics of man (BT, 49-55). In his ontological aspect, man is transcendent in regard to things, and a free agent (BT, ??3 and 4). 38.
