<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAINT CHRISTOPHER, PATRON SAINT OF THE MOTOR-CAR DRIVERS. by Marie Bonaparte I had long been wondering why St. Christopher had become the patron saint of motor-car drivers. The small medals which, in almost every car, pictured the athletic looking saint, carrying on his shoulders the infant saviour of the world, each time my eyes gazed on them whilst driv ing along in one car or another, each time questioned my fancy; but I could find no answer to satisfy my curiosity. If I mentioned this little problem to any one else, the people addressed generally rebuked my question rather impatiently. "Why, said they, St. Christopher passed the infant Jesus over the foaming waters. No wonder he is considered a protector, warding off dangers of the road." Or more simply still people answered that St. Christopher had been chosen as any other saint might have been. There was no problem there! This last answer reminded me of the explanation many people give of our nightmares. "Why, you have eaten something difficult to digest . . .". As this last explana tion does not account for the content of each particular nightmare, so the answer after which any saint might have been elected as patron saint of the motor-car drivers did not account for the election, as such, of St. Christopher in particular. * * â€¢ One day, in Athens, I was invited to visit the Museum of popular Byzantine art. We were led through the dif ferent rooms, admired the icons brought there from the chapels from the different isles or villages from the con tinent or the islands, and finally arrived in the room where the most popular pictures of saints were exposed. They were roughly painted pictures, often resembling the figura tions drawn or painted by children. And suddenly I was confronted by two or three small painted wood panels, from the island of Crete. They represented a sort of giant,</page><page sequence="2">50 MARIE BONAPARTE towering above the meadows, fields, mountains, whose head, curiously enough, was that of a big dog. I asked who he was. They told me he was St. Christopher, and that in the Orient, such were the first figuratives of this saint. No little Jesus on his back! No crossing of foaming torrents; only this gigantic stature and this dog's head. And suddenly the understanding of St. Chrisopher, patron saint of the motor-car drivers, flashed through my head. The Christian saint must have been some new edi tion of the Egyptian jackal headed god Anubis. But other occupations prevented at that time the pursuit of my re searches. And the second world war soon broke out, and it is only now, in the relative quietness of our Cape resi dence, that I was able to resume this little mythological research. * m * In the Dictionary of Christian Biography (1), which I was able to consult at the Cape Municipal Library, the Christopher article reads as follows : Christopher, St. (Christopherus, Christoforus, Christo ferus, Christofanus, etc., Christobal, Christophle, Kester, Kitt, Chrisdaphor). A martyr of universal fame. He was baptized by St. Babylas, the martyr-bishop of Antioch, and about the year 250 suffered under Decius in Lycia.

London John Murray, Albemarle Street 1877</page><page sequence="3">SAINT CHRISTOPHER, PATRON 51 trustworthy character of some popular stories related to him has been declared. Usuard (A.D. 876) thus commem orated him (25th July) after St. James, according to the common Western use (b), in his Martyrologium. "At Samos in Licia. After he had been scourged with iron rods, and then delivered from the boiling flames by the virtue of Christ, his head was at last severed from his body, which had fallen full of arrow-wounds, and the martyr's witness was complete. In the Greek Church, St. Christopher is commemorated 9th May (in company with the prophet Isaiah, who is called Theophoros, by Theodoret IY, 968), with this troparion (4th tone) in the Uniate New Anthology of Arcudius, "With the head of a dog, noble in faith, and fervent in prayer, as a soldier of Christ thou didst endure torments; at thee the powers of heaven were astonished, thee the King of idols wounded, Christopher of golden name, wherefore solemnly entreat the Lord for us." The saint's cynocephalism however, had been repudi ated long before in the Menology of Basil II (A.D. 984). "Some marvellous and miraculous relations concerning this saint are current in some quarters; as that he was a dog-headed man-eater, until he was metamorphosed at his conversion. This is not the fact, only some supposed him such because he was a heathen wild and grim. Howbeit he lived in the reign of Decius; and being taken in battle by the Comes, he was not able to speak Greek; he prayed to God, and an angel was sent unto him, saying: "Play the man"; and he touched his lips, and gave him power to speak Greek. So he entered into the city and began to preach Christ. And when soldiers are sent out to take him, and his staff put forth buds, they believed Christ, and are baptized with him at Antioch by St. Babylas, at which (b) There was a monastery and basilica dedicated in his name on the bank of the Guadalquivir, standing in A.D. 852 (St. Eulogius, Mem. Sane. II, IV, XI).</page><page sequence="4">52 MARIE BONAPARTE time he received his name Christopher. Afterward, being brought before the Emperor, he was first tried with diverse torments, and at the last beheaded." In a Latin poem, Gualt Spirensis, subdeacon, gives the Western version of the same date ("983, vel paullo ser ius"). He devotes five books out of six, and a correspond ing prose narrative, to his arts: dwelling upon his miraculous baptism by a cloud after a catechetical instruc tion from heaven, attested by the budding of his club. His Gentile name Reprobus, Canaanitish origin, conversion of multitudes and of the harlots, Nicea or Galonica, and Aquilina, sent to tempt him in prison by the blustering tyrant Dagnus, the great iron chair, the arrows, and axe of martyrdom, and the healing of his persecutor's sight are detailed. The story of his dog's head is apologised for, but there is not the slightest allusion to the beautiful modern legend, which is ignored (though he could hardly have been ignorant of it), by Surius, as late as 1573. The Mozarabic Missal and Breviary (Saech. YII-XYI) represent the opinion of Toledo, where his relics once rest ed, in a very simple form. The hymn and the missal speak of Decius Imperator trying to secure the strong man for his army; of Christopher's mouth being miraculously opened; of his providing food for the soldiers (in later times developed into a miracle) who cast in their lot with him. His name was given him at baptism "quia Christum indutus." The missal alludes also to his being tempted (but see Aquilina), and mentions the amelioration of his visage after baptism. The legend is found in a similar short form in the 33rd sermon of St. Peter Damian (on the fes tival of the saint), A.D. 1072, and in England as late as the 12th century, Ms. Passionales (where, however, Dagnus, Nicea, and Aquilina, appear) ; but in the following century there are traces of the adoption as history of what art devised as allegory, and what was explained allegorically by Vida, bishop of Alba, in the 16th century. An 11th cen tury column, capito, preserved in the Campo Santo at Pisa,</page><page sequence="5">SAINT CHRISTOPHER, PATRON ... 53 and a 12th century window in the south transept of Stras burg Cathedral are mentioned by Guenebault as represent ing St. Christopher, and very early in the 14th century Simon Mennini, of Sienna, painted in a series of saints, a figure holding a flowering staff, walking in, or on, water between two rocks, and bearing the Holy Child astride his neck ; a head in one corner may be intended to foreshadow his decollation. Before that time James de Voragine, bishop of Genua, when compiling his Legenda Aurea, found "in quibusdam gestis", in addition to a development of the earlier history, an allegorical tale of the heathen giant Reprobus (d) in a Search after the Stronger-than-he, quitting the service of the King of Canaan, who feared the name of Satan, of Satan who feared the Cross, and taking up with a hermit who taught him to serve the Strongest in the charitable work of fording wayfarers across the water, for the giant had neither the gift of fasting nor the conception of prayer. One night a child insisted on being carried over, and in mid-water Reprobus felt his strong knees failing beneath the weight of Him by whom all things were made. By-and bv he apprehends the precious yoke, and finds the burden light. At dawn he has the. token of his staff budding, wan ders to "Samos of Licea", Dagnus, and so on with the older legend. It is easy now to recognise in this a sort of rebus on the saint's name. The etymological note stating that he was called Christopher because he carried Christ in four ways, "in humeris per traductionem, in corpore per macerationem, in mente per devotionem, in oteper pro fessionem sive predicationem" not found in a Ms. of the 123 legends written in 1299, a year after the compiler's death, occurs (as does the Missal extract (Ambrosius in Prefatione), in later MSS and printed editions, with the 177 legends. (d) Adocimus', alias 'Onuphrius', 'Onuferus', and even the perver sely ingenious 'Oferus'.</page><page sequence="6">54 MARIE BONAPARTE From this period the cultur of the saint was yet more popular than before, not only in Spain and Italy, but in France. A colossal wooden figure, erected in Notre Dame by Antoine des Csars in 1413, and destroyed in 1785, is mentioned by Sir T. Browne; the pictures by Memling (1487) and Durer (1521) are noteworthy. In Western art the van Eyck's great Adoration of the Immaculate Lamb (1432) is almost alone in representing St. Christo pher without our Lord on his shoulders, but the simplicity and general intention of the picture would here have been marred by the more popular treatment. The Roman ser vice books provide a proper collect of lauds only, the rest from the common of martyrs. The Parisian particular ise a little moreâ€”an alternative ninth lesson, merely men tioning a church and convent of his dedication. His popularity must have been increased by the superstition which is to be found expressed, e. g. on the much-vexed Spencer print of (or copied from some work of art of) 1423. "Cristofori faciem die quacunque tueris Ilia nempe die morte mala non morieris." In many English churches painted windows and wall paintings are preserved; a colossal pulpit in Salisbury museum. Chaucer's yeoman wore a silver medal of the saint, whose aid was commonly invoked here against storms (Horn. On Peril of Idolatry, III A.D. 1562-3). In the Sarum use he is commemorated (with Lucufas on St. James's day) by a special memorial at 1st vespers, matins, and mass, and his name in the litany on Fridays in Lent. In 1492 and later editions of the missal a supplemental mass is printed, con taining a reference to the latter legend. Hone (Every-day book) mentions that the flower Actaea spicata is dedicated to him, and called Herb Christo pher. A synagogue of Jews at Valencia told Vincent Fer rier (A.D. 1357-1413) that they had been converted by a vision of St. Christopher on July 10, and observed that day in his honour (Moreri).</page><page sequence="7">SAINT CHRISTOPHER, PATRON ... 55 Christopherus (Christigerulus, not a Christogestu) probably became a baptismal name very early. It was a title for Christians with such idea as St. Matt. XI, 29, 30; 2 Corr. IY. 10, VI. 16; and with a special reference to Communion. Suicer refers to Phileas ap. Euscb. H. E. VIII, 10, 3 ; and passages in Chrysostom, comparing the name of Ignatius. We may add that in one place (Martyrium Tgn. v. Ruinart, pp. 13, 705), that apostolic martyr is actually called Christopher instead of the com moner Deifer. (1)â€” Usuardi Martyrologium, In Baring Gould's Lives of the Saints, (2) I could find this summary of the oriental version of the Christopher legend : St. Christopher M. (3d Cent.). The following story seems to be destitute of every element of truth ; though it is possible that there may have been a martyr of the name of Christopher. The statement that he suffered under Decius, and had been baptized by S. Babylas at Antioch, made in the Greek Menqea and Menelogy is perhaps founded on a more trustworthy tra dition than the fabulous Acts; but the Menology of Basil says:- "Many monstrous and paradoxical things are re lated of this saintâ€”that he had a dog's head, and ate men; but that when he believed in Christ, he was transformed; "â€”so that a version of the fabulous Acts existed in the time of Basil II. The story has the appearance of a clumsy and stupid compilation of incidents from Holy Writâ€”Dagon falling before the Arch, Ahab's soldiers sent to take Elijah, Samson, etc. and the Egyptian figures of Anubis. Some of the pagan romancists, Heliodo....us and Achilles Tatius, for instance, became Christians, and bishops, and may have exercised their pens in the composition of Chris tian romances or novelettes, and may have taken real martyrs as their heroes, though altering the facts, and thus (1) For an extensive bibliography cf. loc. cit. (2) Baring Gould's Lives of the Saints, London 1882, John Hodges.</page><page sequence="8">56 MARIE BONAPARTE have originated such tales as the Acts of St. Margaret, S. Procopius. S. Christina and S. George. But other stories were of heroes as purely imaginary as Theagenes and Chitophon, Anthia and Leucippe, of late Greek profane romance. To this latter class there is strong probability that S. Christopher belongs. The story shall speak for itself. In the days of King Dagon, who ruled in Samos, there was a man of the Cynocephali, who was instructed out of heaven in the faith, and a cloud came down out of the sky and baptized him, a voice from heaven uttering the neces sary sacramental words. Then this man went into Syria, to Samos, and stood with an iron staff in his hand at the entrance of the city. Now a certain woman came out to adore her idols, when seeing a man with a dog's head, she ran back and told the people to come and see the mar velâ€”for, as has been said, Christopher belonged to the race of the Cynocephali, or dog-headed men (1). And when a crowd was assembled round him, Christopher prayed that a sign might be given to convert the people, and he planted his iron staff in the ground, and forthwith it put forth leaves and bloomed. Then one thousand and eighteen persons believed and were forthwith baptized. On hearing this, King Dagon sent two hundred sol diers to take the dog-headed man. But the soldiers did not like the looks of him, so they ran away. Then Dagon sent two hundred others, more valiant than the first, and they saw Christopher standing and praying, so they stood still, and began to pray also. And when he had done praying, the soldiers said: "Sir, the King desires to see you". Christopher answered: "If I choose I will go. If I don't choose, I will not go. However I will accompany you." Now when he was brought into the hall of Dagon, the King tumbled out of his chair with fright, for Christo (1) "Videns ipsum sanctum contremuit: videns corpus hominis, caput autem canis."</page><page sequence="9">SAINT CHRISTOPHER, PATRON ... 57 pher was a giant, and his features were, to say the least, of an unusual type. But after a while, finding his position somewhat undignified, the King scrambled on his legs again, mounted his throne, and plucking up an appearance of courage, asked: "What is your name?" "My name", said the saint, "was Reprobate, but at my baptism I was called Christopher". "You dog," said Dagon, "Adore my gods." S. Christopher replied, "You are rightly called Dagon; (2) whose lot is death and hell, for you are a fool to worship such gods." Then Dagon ordered four hundred soldiers to bind him and take him to prison. But lo! all the four hundred believed and were baptized on the spot, and were martyred. Then Dagon said within himself, "What shall I do with this fellow, bred among wild beasts?" And he bribed two women, Nicaea and Calinice (3) (Aquilina) to lead him into idolatry. But the two women saw his face as a flame of fire, and they fell down and lay on the ground from the third to the sixth hour. Then Christopher said: "Get up and do not be frightened." And he preached the truth to them and they believed, and were baptized. And Dagon ordered a. red hot pot to be put on Chris topher 's head ; then said three of his consuls, ' ' It were well, 0 King, had you not been born." For saying which they were executed with the sword. Then Dagon ordered S. Christopher to be measured for a seat on which to be tortured, all the benches available being of far too contracted dimensions to accommodate his capacious body, and his measure for a seat was twelve cubits. Then, when suitable accommodation had been made, (2) "Vere bene vocatus es Dagnus; quia tu es pars mortis et conjus patris tui diaboli." What does this mean? Dagon is identical with Minos, a judge in Hell, see Hitzig: Urgeschichte us Mythologie der Philister, p. 212. (3) Commemorated in the Romans Martyrology on July 24th.</page><page sequence="10">58 MARIE BONAPARTE a fire was put under the iron chair, and four hundred pitchers of oil poured over the Saint. "I am not afraid of your torments!" said S. Christo pher, and lo ! the iron chair gave way under his ponderous weight, dissolving like wax. Christopher started up so as not to fall in a sitting posture in the flames, and began to pray. Then his face became "as a new rose", and seeing this amazing transformation, and the failure of his iron chair, the King tumbled out of his throne once more, and lay on the ground from the fifth to the ninth hour. After that, he got up on his legs again, and said to S. Christopher, "You bad beast (1), are you bent on draw ing away all my people after you?" Then he ordered him to be bound to a great post, of suitable height, and that his soldiers should shoot at him. And they shot off their arrows from the first to the twelfth hour. Then the King thought that such a host of arrows must have made his body like that of a porcupine. But what was his amaze ment to see all the arrows hanging in the air, without fall ing, and none had reached the martyr. Then one of the arrows turned round in the air and rushed to the King, and put out one of his eyes. Thereupon S. Christopher said, "I tell thee, King Dagon, that tomorrow I shall gain my crown; and the Christians will take my body, and will put it in the place where they pray. Then do thou make clay with my blood, and apply it to thy blind eye, and it will recover sight." And he prayed, "Grant that where my body is laid, no hail may fall, no fire may break out, there may not be famine, nor mortality; and in that city, evil workers and demoniacs who come and pray with all their hearts, and invoke my name in their prayers, may be saved". Then there fell a voice from heaven, "It shall be as thou hast prayed not only where thy body is, but also where it is not." And S. Christopher also prayed "Lord, grant to those who write and those who read my passion, a good reward. Amen." And when Christopher (1) "Fera mala."</page><page sequence="11">SAINT CHRISTOPHER, PATRON ... 59 had completed his martyrdom, Dagon anointed his eye with the blood, and saw; and he also believed, and pub lished a decree, "to all nations and languages, that all who should blaspheme the God of the Christians should be slain with the sword". Such are these absurd and worthless acts. Western legend has added to them .... " * * * The western version of the Christopher myth is best quoted from Jacobus de Voragine Legenda Aurea. (1) "Christopher before his baptism was named Reprobus, but afterwards he was named Christopher, which is as much to say as bearing Christ, of that that he bare Christ in four manners. He bare him on his shoulders by convey ing and leading, in his body by making it lean, in mind by devotion, and in his mouth by confession and predica tion. Christopher was of the lineage of the Canaanites, and he was of a right great stature, and had a terrible and fearful cheer and countenance. And he was twelve cubits of length, and as it is read in some histories that, when he served and dwelled with the king of Canaan, it came in his mind that he would seek the greatest prince that was in the world, and him would he serve and obey. And so far he went that he came to a right great king, of whom the renomee generally was that he was the greatest of the world. And when the king saw him, he received him into his service, and made him to dwell in his court. Upon a time a minstrel sang tofore him a song in which he named oft the devil, and the king, which was a christian man, when he heard him name the devil, made anon the sign of the cross in his visage. And when Christopher saw that, he had great marvel what sign it was, and wherefore the king made it, and he demanded of him. And because (1) The Golden Legend or Lives of the Saints as Englished by William Caxton, vol. four, MDCCCC, published by J. M. Dent &amp; Co., Aldine House, London, W.C.</page><page sequence="12">60 MARIE BONAPARTE the king would not say, he said: If thou tell me not, I shall no longer dwell with thee, and then the king told to him, saying: Always when I hear the devil named, I fear that he should have power over me, and I garnish me with this sign that he grieve not he annoy me. Then Christopher said to him: Doubtest thou the devil that he hurt thee not? Then is the devil more mightly and greater than thou art. I am then deceived of my hope and pur pose, for I had supposed I had found the most mighty and the most greatest Lord of the world, but I commend thee to God, for I will go seek him for to be my Lord, and I his servant. And then departed from this king, and hasted him for to seek the devil. And as he went by a great desert, he saw a great company of knights, of which a knight cruel and horrible came to him and demanded whither he went, and Christopher answered to him and said: I go seek the devil for to be my master. And he said: I am he that thou seekest. And then Christopher was glad, and bound him to be his servant perpetual, and took him for his master and Lord. And as they went to gether by a common way, they found there a cross, erect and standing. And anon as the devil saw the cross he was afeard and fled, and left the right way, and brought Chris topher about by a sharp desert. And after, when they were past the cross, he brought him to the highway that they had left. And when Christopher saw that, he mar velled, and demanded whereof he doubted, and had left the high and fair way, and had gone so far about by so aspre a desert. And the devil would not tell him in no wise. Then Christopher said to him: If thou wilt not tell me, I shall anon depart from thee, and shall serve thee no more. Wherefor the devil was constrained to tell him, and said : There was a man called Christ which was hanged on the cross, and when I see his sign I am sore afraid, and flee from it wheresoever I see it. To whom Christopher said: Then he is greater, and more mightier than thou, when thou art afraid of his sign, and I see well that I have</page><page sequence="13">SAINT CHRISTOPHER, PATRON 61 laboured in vain, when I have not founden the greatest Lord of the world. And I will serve thee no longer, go thy way then, for I will go seek Christ. And when he had long sought and demanded where he should find Christ, at last he came into a great desert, to an hermit that dwelt there, and this hermit preached to him of Jesu Christ and informed him in the faith diligently, and said to him: This king whom thou desirest to serve, requireth the ser vice that thou must oft fast. And Christopher said to him : Require of me some other thing, and I shall do it, for that which thou requirest I may not do. And the hermit said: Thou must then wake and make many prayers. And Christopher said to him: I wot not what it is; I may do no such thing. And then the hermit said to him: Know est thou such a river, in which many be perished and lost? To whom Christopher said: I know it well. Then said the hermit, Because thou art noble and high of stature and strong in thy members, thou shalt be resident by that river, and thou shalt bear over all them that shall pass there, which shall be a thing right convenable to our Lord Jesu Christ whom thou desirest to serve, and I hope he shall show himself to thee. Then said Christopher: Certes, this service may I well do, and I promise to him for to do it. Then went Christopher to this river, and made there his habitacle for him, and bare a great pole in his hand instead of a staff, by which he sustained him in the water, and bare over all manner of people without ceasing. And there he abode, thus doing, many days. And in a time, as he slept in his lodge, he heard the voice of a child which called him and said: Christopher, come out and bear me over. Then he awoke and went out, but he found no man. And when he was again in his house, he heard the same voice and he ran out and found nobody. The third time he was called and came thither, and found a child beside the rivage of the river, which prayed him goodly to bear him over the water. And then Christopher lift up the child on his shoulders, and took his staff, and entered into</page><page sequence="14">62 MARIE BONAPARTE the river for to pass. And the water of the river arose and swelled more and more: and the child was heavy as lead, and alway as he went farther the water increased and grew more, and the child more and more waxed heavy, insomuch that Christopher had great anguish and was afeard to be drowned. And when he was escaped with great pain, and passed the water, and set the child aground, he said to the child : Child, thou hast put me in great peril ; thou weighest almost as I had all the world upon me, I might bear no greater burden. And the child answered: Chris topher, marvel thee nothing, for thou hast not only borne all the world upon thee, but thou hast borne him that created and made all the world, upon thy shoulders. I am Jesu Christ the king, to whom thou servest in this work. And because that thou know that 1 say to be the truth, set thy staff in the earth by thy house, and thou shalt see to morn that it shall bear flowers and fruit, and anon he vanished from his eyes. And then Christopher set his staff in the earth, and when he arose on the morn, he found his staff like a palmier bearing flowers, leaves and dates. And then Christopher went into the city of Lycia, and understood not their language. Then he prayed our Lord that he might understand them, and so he did. And as he was in this prayer, the judges supposed that he had been a fool, and left him there. And then when Christo pher understood the language, he covered his visage and went to the place where they martyred christian men, and comforted them in our Lord. And then the judges smote him in the face, and Christopher said to them: If I were not christian I should avenge mine injury. And then Christopher pitched his rod in the earth, and prayed to our Lord that for to convert the people it might bear flowers and fruit, and anon it did so. And then he con verted eight thousand men. And then the king sent two knights for to fetch him to the king, and they found him praying, and durst not tell to him so. And anon after,</page><page sequence="15">SAINT CHRISTOPHER, PATRON 63 the king sent as many more, and they anon set them down for to pray with him. And when Christopher arose, he said to them: What seek ye? And when they saw him in the visage they said to him: The king hath sent us, that we should lead thee bound unto him. And Christopher said to them: If I would, ye should not lead me to him, bound ne unbound. And they said to him: If thou wilt go thy way, go quit, where thou wilt. And we shall say to the king that we have not found thee. It shall not be so, said he, but I shall go with you. And then he converted them in the faith, and commanded them that they should bind his hands behind his back, and lead him so bound to the king. And when the king saw him he was afeard and fell down off the seat, and his servants lifted him up and releved him again. And then the king inquired his name and his country; and Christopher said to him: Tofore or I was baptized I was named Reprobus, and after, I am Christopher; tofore baptism, a Canaanite, now, a christian man. To whom the king said: Thou hast a foolish name, that is to wit of Christ crucified, which could not help himself, ne may not profit to thee. How therefore, thou cursed Canaanite, why wilt thou not do sacrifice to our gods? To whom Christopher said: Thou are rightfully called Dagnus, for thou are the death of the world, and fellow of the devil, and thy gods be made with the hands of men. And the king said to him : Thou wert nourished among wild beasts, and therefore thou mayst not say but wild language, and words unknown to men. And if thou wilt now do sacrifice to the gods I shall give to thee great gifts and great honours, and if not, I shall destroy thee and consume thee by great pains and torments. But, for all this, he would in no wise do sacrifice, wherefore he was sent in to prison, and the king did do behead the other knights that he had sent for him, whom he had converted. And after this he sent in to the prison to S. Christopher two fair women, of whom that one was named Nicaea and that other Aquilina, and promised to them many great gifts</page><page sequence="16">64 MARIE BONAPARTE if they could draw Christopher to sin with them. And when Christopher saw that, he set him down in prayer, and when he was constrained by them that embraced him to move, he arose and said : What seek ye ? For what cause be ye come hither? And they, which were afraid of his cheer and clearness of his visage, said : Holy saint of God, have pity of us so that we may believe in that God that thou preachest. And when the king heard that, he com manded that they should be let out and brought tofore him. To whom he said: Ye be deceived, but I swear to you by my god that, if ye do no sacrifice to my gods, ye shall anon perish by evil death. And they said to him: If thou wilt that we shall do sacrifice, command that the places may be made clean, and that all the people may assemble at the temple. And when this was done they entered in to the temple, and took their girdles, and put them about the necks of their gods, and drew them to the earth and brake them all in pieces, and said to them that were there : Go and call physicians and leeches for to heal your gods. And then, by the commandment of the king, Aquilina was hanged, and a right great and heavy stone was hanged at her feet, so that her members were much despitously broken. And when she was dead, and passed to our Lord, her sister Nicaea was cast into a great fire, but she issued out without harm all whole, and then he made to smite off her head, and so suffered death. After this Christopher was brought tofore the king, and the king commanded that he should be beaten with rods of iron, and that there should be set upon his head a cross of iron red hot and burning, and then after, he did do make a siege or a stool of iron, and made Christopher to be bounden thereon, and after, to set fire under it, and cast therein pitch. But the siege or settle melted like wax, and Christopher issued out without any harm or hurt. And when the king saw that, he commanded that he should be bound to a strong stake, and that he should be through shotten with arrows with forty nights archers. But none</page><page sequence="17">SAINT CHRISTOPHER, PATRON 65 of the knights might attain him, for the arrows hung in the air about, nigh him, without touching. Then the king weened that he had been through-shotten with the arrows of the knights, and addressed him for to go to him. And one of the arrows returned suddenly from the air and smote him in the eye, and blinded him. To whom Christopher said: Tyrant, I shall die to-morn, make a little clay, with my blood tempered, and anoint therewith thine eye, and thou shalt receive health. Then by the commandment of the king he was led for to be beheaded, and then, there made he his orison, and his head was smitten off, and so suffered martyrdom. And the king then took a little of his blood and laid it on his eye, and said: In the name of God and of S. Christopher! and was anon healed. Then the king believed in God, and gave commandment that if any person blamed God or S. Christopher, he should anon be slain with the sword. Ambrose saith in his preface thus, of this holy martyr: Lord, thou hast given to Christopher so great plenty of virtues, and such grace of doctrine, that he called from the error of paynims forty-eight thousand men, to the honour of christian faith, by his shining miracles. And Nicaea and Aquilina, which long had been common at the bordel, under the stench of lechery, he called and made them serve in the habit of chastity, and enseigned them to a like crown of martyrdom. And with this, he being strained and bounden in a seat of iron and great fire put under, doubted nothing the heat. And all a whole day during, stood bounden to a stake, yet might not be through pierced with arrows of all the knights. And with that, one of the arrows smote out the eye of the tyrant, to whom the blood of the holy martyr re-established his sight, and enlumined him in taking away the blindness of his body, and gat of the christian mind and pardon, and he also gat of thee by prayer power to put away sickness and sores from them that remember his passions and figure. Then let us pray to S. Christopher that he pray for us, etc."</page><page sequence="18">66 MARIE BONAPARTE On the testimony of these documents we can gather a central fact: the mythical personality of St. Christopher consists in the juxtaposition of two main mythical com plexes. Firstly, the oriental one, where he appears as a heathen dog-headed giant, whom every one fears, who is converted, then suffers martyrdom, at the order of a vicious tyrant, and from then on, protects humanity from diverse calamities. Secondly, the western complex : Saint Christo pher, though remaining here at first a heathen giant, but who has lost his dog's head, is converted, and, being rather simple minded in spite of his great physical strength, de votes himself to fording travellers over a furious stream, and amongst these, one day, the infant Jesus. After which, he also suffers martyrdom at the hands of the tyrant. He then became the patron saint of many activities and pro fessions and protected men in general against diverse calamities. So he was patron saint of porters (in Paris, in the Middle Ages) of ferrymen, mariners, sailors, of travellers in general, of treasure seekers; of gardeners and book binders too, of fullers, of husbandmen, we are told. We understand that Christopher be the patron of porters (did he not bear the most precious of burdens?) of ferrymen (did he not like them pass travellers over streams?) of mariners, sailors, travellers and treasure seekers, of all these adventurers, by extension; we understand here why he specially protected gardeners and husbandmen, unless he was to protect husbandmen and gardeners against thunder, storms, hail, which are real dangers to crops as well as to men. Still more mysterious is the special pro tection extended to fullers or bookbinders, perhaps was this apotropaic saint to protect bookbinders against the evil influence suffered to emanate from certain books, the written word they cannot decipher seeming magically dangerous to the illiterate? But this is only a frail hypothesis. What is certain is that Christopher protected man</page><page sequence="19">SAINT CHRISTOPHEÃŸ, PATRON ... 67 kind at large against dangers, and that his image or statue, therefore, was painted or erected at the entrance of many houses, bridges or churches, often in colossal dimensions. Did Christopher not arrest the dangers by water (floods or ice jams), by fire, by storms, thunder, lightning, hail? Was he not said to protect against famine, plague, epilepsy, even falling or fainting, these apparent equivalents of sudden death? Christophori Sancti speciem quicumque tuetur Illo namque die nullo languore tenetur. (Whoever shall behold the image of Saint Christopher shall not faint or fall on that day... Christofori faciem die quacunque tueris Ilia nempe die morte mala non morieris. (He who looks on the face of Christopher will not meet bad (sudden) death on that day.) * # * Now let us revert to our original question: how is it that Saint Christopher became the special protector of motor-car driversâ€”and aviators, let us now addâ€”against fatal accidents bringing about sudden death? What rela tion between the mythical giant wading across a furious stream and a modern and prosaic motor car driver or aviator in his machine? We cannot understand this relation without bringing together the two separate types of our Saint, the early oriental one and the later western one. Let us not forget that, at first, in the earlier oriental versions of the legend, the saint was to begin with a heathen giant with a dog's head. He thus seems issued from some heathen pantheon, from the Egyptian pantheon in particular, with whose jackal-headed god Anubis he bears that likeness which struck me so vividly in the Athen 's Byzantine Museum, and had struck others before me, though they did not follow up the consequences there from. Two more traits identify the primeval heathen giant,</page><page sequence="20">68 MARIE BONAPARTE which was to become the saintly man Christopher, with a former heathen god in general and with the Egyptian Anubis in particular. Is he not in almost every version, even in the western onesâ€”called at first Reprobus, which suggests reproved? And we know from the comparative studies of religions that the gods of the former and van quished ones tend to become the demons of the later and triumphant onesâ€”this until these last ones manage to absorb and fuse at least part of them in new godly figures. But the second trait attributed to the heathen giant Reprobatus identifies him more closely to the particular Egyptian god Anubis. He is described as a dog-headed man eater, a cannibal. And such a carcass, corpse devourer is the jackal, haunter of carrion and cemeteries, a habit of his which accounts for his having given his head to Anubis, god of the Sarcophagi, the Dead, the Underworld. So the heathen giant, the dog-headed Reprobatusâ€” Christopher, appears to be most really a christianed Anubis, as Saint Barbaraâ€”to quote only one further exampleâ€” was a christianised Bellona or armed Pallas, and thus be came the patroness of artillery men. # * * Let us further ask now: how did this new Christian oriental figuration of Anubis, god of the Dead, come to be transformed into the western bearer of Christ over the waters ? How did the dog-headed giant lose his animal head and become the great Christ-bearer of so many statues, paintings, amulets and medals? We can ascertain itâ€”it is because St. Christopher was originally Anubis, god of the Dead, that he became the crosser of the stream. How often, on the engravings and paintings that adorn the Egyptian tombs, do we not behold the boat of Osiris, with Anubis standing erect near Osiris's coffin, whilst the funeral vessel is supposed to glide over these waters the Deceased have to traverse in order to travel from this world into the next one? This idea of a stream to cross before men can enter the world beyond</page><page sequence="21">SAINT CHRISTOPHER, PATRON 69 the tomb was familiar to many a religion: let us only mention in this context the Hellenic Styx with its mythical ferryman Charon (which, by the way, has remained until this day for the modern Greek folklore the figuration of Death itself). So Christopher, the passer of the furious stream, seems to syncretise in his new Christian shape the heathen pass ers of the Dead, to be some replica of the Anubis and Charon of the former pagan creeds. And the stream he crosses must be, in the deep unconscious imagination of the folk, a kind of christian Styx. Therefore, when the Bearer has thus complained: "Child, thou hast put me in great peril; thou weighest almost as I had all the world upon me, I might bear no greater burden", can the Divine child thus answer: "Christopher, marvel thee nothing, for thou hast not only borne all the world upon thee, but thou hast borne him that created and made all the world, upon thy shoulders ..." And, in the numerous figurations of the Christopher myth which, through the centuries, have inspired so many artists, we behold the Infant Jesus carrying in his small hand the globe. For, like Anubis's or Charo's boat, the Bearer wading across the stream carries in fact a most heavy burden ! Is it not the whole weight of poor Humanity fall ing, generation after generation, a prey to almighty Death ? If the Creator and Saviour of Humanity is at the same time supposed to be borne with those he saved, there may be there an allusion to the fact that Christ himself passed the shores of Death. But there may be a more hopeful allusion contained in the beautiful legend: the Saviour of Humanity accompanies Men on their Death journey, saves them from hell, brings them to heaven. The oriental Christopher himself, before dying, had prayed God in these terms: "Grant that where my body is laid, no hail shall fall, no fire may break out, there may be no famine, no mortality ; and in that city, evil workers and demoniacs who come and pray with all their hearts, and invoke my</page><page sequence="22">70 MARIE BONAPARTE name in their prayers, may be saved." And God answers: "It shall be as thou hast prayed not only where thy body is, but also where it is not." So the Bearer of the Dead, when Death prevails, preserves men from hell, carries them on to the right shore. The Christians, in the Middle Ages, feared sudden death as the worst form of death, as it exposed them to die without repentence, without confes sion, in a state of mortal sin, dooming them thus to hell. Later on, as the fear of hell has more and more receded and followed the waning of the belief in the Devil which precedes everywhere the waning of the belief in God, that fear of sudden death, of which Christopher must preserve us, has acquired a much more earthly tinge. It is death as such that must be averted, that the old protector from sudden death, Christopher, must keep away from us. And so Christopher, after having been for centuries invoking against floods, fires, earthquakes, storms, famine, plague and epilepsy, could, in modern times, also be invoked against the new dangers threatening men with sudden death and which arise from these new instruments of travel devised by men: motor-cars and aeroplanes. As a claim that it was already from ever dreaded death itself that the former Anubis-Christopher saved men is given in the episode of the flowering rod, testimony of Christ's power. Is the withered but all the same flowering rod not a classical symbol of resurrection, of the denial of death? Ego sum resurrectio et vita. The same death denying symbolism which created Heaven incites us, even today, to bequeath wreaths of flowers on the dead, on coffins and tombs. But this is the religious celestial denial of Death, and Christopher, patron of motor-car drivers and airmen, is now asked to save men from earthly real death. # # # When motor-car drivers and airmen, in this much more materialistic way, hope to be saved from death through the magical power of the Christopher medals adorning their motors or their planes, it may seem strange, in re</page><page sequence="23">SAINT CHRISTOPHER, PATRON ... 71 membrance of the fact that Christopher is a personification of Death, that they should invoke Death itself against death. But this apparent incongruity fades away if we stress the fact that Death, in such a case, is so to say the anthropomorphic god or angel of Death. Many fateful in carnations of Evil were, in all religions, thus implored to spare men their fateful activities. Did not the bravest of all Greeks, the Lacedomonians, erect a chapel unto Fear? But this no doubt in order to ask this incarnation of Fear not to send them fear in the combats. In this way the implorations of men to an avatar of Death can be understood. The living enamoured with Life implore the Angel of Death not to take them yet, to refrain from his fateful activities against them. To the Bearer who crosses the lethal stream men address a supplication: "Not yet! Leave us a little while still on this earthly shore!" They thus pray to him as they would to some fateful real human messenger come to bear them away from all that they love, from that land to which, in spite of its hardships, they desperately cling, which even the majority of the pious seem to prefer to the other unknown one. And so we come to understand what the millions of Christopher medals nailed into motor-cars, or now even planes, mean to their drivers. Each time they enter the car or the plane, they more or less behold the medal. And the magico-religious effect of this beholding works : like their middle age forefathers, they feel protected, at least for this day, from sudden death. It is as if they had im plored: "Passer of the Dead, do not pass us yet!" and as if the fateful Passer, having heard their prayer, had in fact consented to leave them, at least for this day, linger on the earthly shore. Let us add that the benefit of having a Christopher medal in one's car or in one's plane is not only mythical but is also real, in giving to the driver, more or less consciously, a feeling of security, of self-confidence which permits of a drive or a flight both surer and bolder.</page><page sequence="24">72 MARIE BONAPARTE The theme of the Passer of Christ over a dangerous stream appears sometimes in other connections than with Reprobatusâ€”Christopher. Let us only mention and briefly review here La legende de Stint Julien l'hospitalier by Gustave Flaubert. But, in this case, other themes have been fused with it, which we do not find in the Christopher myth. In 1872, Flaubert, then past fifty years of age, had lost his mother, and three years later, his fortune. He was very depressed, and in order to try and recover, he retired to Concarneau in Bretagne. There, interrupting his other literary labours (he had inbetween achieved La tentation de Saint Antone and gone on assembling documentation for Bouvard et Gecuchet), he soon began writing the Legend. (To Mme Roger des Genettes he had formerly writ ten: "Je ne pense plus qup'aux jours Ã©coulÃ©s et aux gens qui ne peuvent revenir. Signe de vieillesse et de dÃ©cadence ... je vais me mettre Ã  Ã©crire La LÃ©gende de Saint Julien l'Hospitalier, uniquement pour m'occuper Ã  quelque chose." [Correspondance, ....ome IV.] and to George Sand he was to write: "Vous savez que j'ai quittÃ© mon grand roman" (Bouvard et PÃ©cuchet)" pour Ã©crire une petite bÃªtise mogenageuse qui n'aura pas plus de 30 pages. Cela me met dans un milieu plus propre que le monde moderne et me fait du bien." [Correspondance, ....ome IV.]) In thus explaining why he took up writing the Legend, Flaubert was minimizing the urge thereto. It is not "merely in order to have something to do" that he took up this work, and the Legend was not "a little trifle about the Middle Ages". If he chose this subject, it was in deep connection with this that he was "only thinking of the bygone days and of the people who cannot come back" and had to find some sort of "catharsis" that would help him, as he actually says the Legend did. Julien is born in some opulent middle age castle, the son of noble and wealthy parents. A supernatural her</page><page sequence="25">SAINT CHRISTOPHER, PATRON 73 mit appears to his mother and predicts that he will be a saint. To his father, an uncanny gipsy announces that he will, amid much blood and glory, enter the family of an Emperor. We are then shown how Julien 's sadistic propensities develop ; he first kills with great lust a mouse in a church, then birds, and is then regularly taught as becomes his rank the art of hunting animals. And he is seized by the passion for murder and blood to such a degree that, day and night, he does nothing else than roam about the forest in search of kills. He lastly indulges, one day, in a magical hunt where he slaughters thousands of beasts, amongst them a whole herd of stags. And it is then that a huge black stag, which he kills after having murdered his fawn and his doe, curses Julian before expiring and predicts to this "ferocious beast" that he will one day murder father and mother! In order to escape this curse, Julien renounces hunting, flees from home and becomes a great general in the service of the Emperor of Occitania. In reward for the victories he wins, the Emperor gives him his beautiful daughter. And Julien, in a magnificent palace, leads a gorgeously splendid life next to his beloved wife. But he remains haunted by his former sadistic hunt ing memories, and one night, in spite of his vows, he goes out in the forest with his bow and arrows. And the magic pursuit by his former victims then begins. His power to kill appears broken, no arrow, no spear prevails, and all the animals, with sparkling eyes dotting the branches of the trees or the undergrowth, fol low him and make fun of him. The day at last breaks, Julien returns home. In between, his old parents, who for years had wan dered in search of him, had arrived at his castle, been received and fed by his wife, and put to bed in her own bed. When Julien re-enters his room in the castle, in the dim light of dawn, and wants to kiss his wife lying in the</page><page sequence="26">74 MARIE BONAPARTE bed, he discovers two bodies lying there, of which one is a man's, with a long beard: Mad with jealousy, he stabs both bodies, and thus accomplishes the great stag's prophesy. To late, he understands his mistake, and flees again from home. And this time goes about the world as a poor beggar, until he arrives near a furious and dangerous stream. He repairs an old boat that he finds abandoned there, and decides to devote the end of his tragic life in helping travellers to cross this dangerous stream. So Julien the ferryman one dark and stormy night hears a plaintive voice calling for him from the other river bank and goes out. The traveller is a hideous leper, whose magical weight causes the little boat to sink deeply amid the furious waves. With pains and strife, Julien gets back to the shore with his weighty traveller, and there, the leper subjects him to a terrible trial. The leper first asks for food. Then for drink. Julien gives him all he has, then the leper complains of the cold and asks for Julien 's bed, and for his company in bed, and finally shivering more and more, bequests Julien to lie on top of him. Julien obeys. . . "Alors le LÃ©freux l'Ã©treignit; et ses yeus tout Ã  coup trirent une clartÃ© d'Ã©toiles; ses cheveux s'allongÃ¨rent comme les rais du soleil; le souffle de ses narines avait la douceur des roses; un nuage d'eneens s'Ã©leva du foyer, les flots chant descendais comme une inondation dans l'ame de Julien pamÃ©; et celui dont les bras le serraient toujours grandissait, grandissait, touchant de sa tÃªte et de ses pieds les deus murs de la cabane. Le toit s'envola, le firmament se dÃ©ployait;â€”et Julien monta vers les espaces bleus, face Ã  face avec Notre Seigneur YÃ©sus, qui l'empor tait dans le ciel." We find the Saint Hubert and Saint Eustace theme of the miraculous stag associated with some sort of Christopher myth. The above named Saints abstain from killing after the miraculous apparition, and from thence on, lead a saintly</page><page sequence="27">SAINT CHRISTOPHER, PATRON ... 75 life. With Julien, things are different, he kills father and mother after the viewing of the stag. The stag no doubt, in the Eustace and Hubert legends, are totemic figuration of the Father, from whose murder the son must abstain. In Julien 's legend, we thus find a return of the repressed theme, the real father is murdered first in his totemic and then in his human form, and only thereafter does the re pentant son become a saint. The mother is added to the massacre; but let us remember that Flaubert (who had lost his father as a young man), when he chose at fifty to write the Legend, had recently lost his mother, and thus repressed sadistic wishes towards the mother could be vented. Lastly, the ferryman Julien possesses some traits which differentiate him from the Passer Christopher. The pass ing of the dangerous stream may still, as in the unconscious of all men, represent the passing of the Stream from Life unto Death, and, in fact, it is after a last crossing that Julian ascends to heaven. But Julien, instead of being a typical avatar of the Death god, remains primarily both the author and the hero of the Legend himself: a son who gets absolved from the primeval parricide, and is then duly glorified. In ascending, "face to face" with Christ, to Heaven, he appears identified with the Son-god himself. # Â» â™¦ REFERENCES 1.

NOTE: In view of the scarcity of the sources available at the Cape, I had written to Dr. Martin Freud, in London, asking him to look for docu ments in the British Museum. This is what he answered, on the 23rd of March, 1942: Referring to the oriental sources I do not think that "II Menologio di Basilio II (Liturgies-Greek Rite) is the most useful one. It dates from between 1000 to 1025 and contains the legend as taken over from earlier sources with more or less alterations. In my opinion most useful for your studies would be the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum", compiled in Luxeuil 627/8. I have so far not been able yet to find an English translation of one of the oriental sources, but I hope I shall succeed. I did find the Latin Text of the "Passio" which in my opinion might be character istic for the oriental sources: It contains nothing about carrying the Christ-child or serving with the strongest of kings and the devil, but gives a very detailed description of his Martyrium. The Christopherus of the 'passio" is, what you surely know, an Antropophagan with a dog's head. The latin is of Merovingian style and absolutely sickening. In the following I will give you a short survey of the material I found about Christopherus, in the hope that one thing or the other might be helpful and lead to further inquiries from your side. I will also give you some titles of books dealing with the history of the Saint. In the orient we find the Saint first mentioned in May 450; the bishop of Caldecon, Eulalius started the building of a church, dedicated to St. Christopherus. The church was consecrated on the 22.9.452. It is believed this Saint of the Bithynian church has been a historical personality; identity of names might have led to the identification with the Saint of the Western church. In the occident the first mentioning occurs in a letter by the pope Gregor I (Nov./Dec. 598) addressed to bishop Secundinus in Taormina, Sicilia; the letter mentions "Monasterium Sancti Christophori" in Taormina.</page><page sequence="29">SAINT CHRISTOPHER, PATRON ... 77 For some time the cult of Christopherus was very widely spread. At the beginning of the 16th century he was called an universal patron. Luther in his sermons on the 10 commandments, 1516/7, says: tantum habet honoris, ut nullus apostolorum sit ei cenferendus. There was a certain hostility against him from the side of the church and during the reign of Maximilian I in Germany the Saint's name vanished from the prayer books. Many miracles were connected with his name: Those who looked upon his figure, trusting in God, the greatest strength of all, should not suffer sudden death and should be protected from all dangers. The Saint was: Patron Saint of Travellers, Patron of Treasure seekers, Patron of Autocars and airplanes. In France, Belgium and part of Bavaria cars and planes were decorated on his birthday (July 25th, May 9th eastern calender) with medals showing the picture of the Saint. You might find material: Waldemar Deonna, La celeste patronne des aviateurs, Bevue d'ethnographie 3, 1922 Page 251, 5, 1924 page 37 and following. There exist also 2 German monographies concerning the same theme, G. Schreiber, Duesseldorf 1930 and Alb. Becker. Christophorus, der Heilige des modernen Verkehrs. Patron of the L i f t he also was. Pope Pius XI is reported to have had a plaquette in his own lift, which plaquette he had consecrated himself. I mention some more authors on Christophorus: H. P. Huet, Soissons 1861, Chavanne, Roanne 1875, Adr. Peladon, Nimes 1880, T. Mainguet, 1891, G. Lambert, Genappe 1932 "Le grand patron de la route," M. A. Masseron, Paris 1933. There are quite a lot of German authors too. These take most interest in the German legend of the giant who carried the Christ Child; ancient German poems have been found older than the Legenda Aura and believed to have been the source from which J. de Voragine took his story." Most of these sources I did not consult, as they were not available at the Cape. I find A Dictionary of Christian Biography and Baring Gould's Lives of the Saints at the South African Library in Cape Town. Hie Golden Legend was graciously lent to me by the Rev.
