The Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. Bequest of Clara S. Peck, 1983. MS M.1044 (fol. 1v). Photograph by the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. The library writes: Hunting was an important part of medieval life; kings and noblemen were expected to excel and take pleasure in the pursuit Some famous hunters wrote books on the subject, whereas oth ers collected and commissioned them. Three of the most popular French treatises were written during the fourteenth century, but others were also written in Spanish, English, and German. Gaston III, Count of Foix (1331-1391), called Phoebus on account of his golden hair or hand some features, wrote his hunting book late in life (1387-89), sharing his knowledge in a field in which he claimed supremacy, unlike in his two other pleasures in life, arms and love. The work, dedicated to his fellow hunter and warrior Philip the Bold (1342-1404), Duke of Burgundy, com prises four books: On Gentle and Wild Beasts, On the Nature and Care of Dogs, On Instruc tions for Hunting with Dogs, and On Hunting with Traps, Snares, and Crossbow? The Morgan Phoebus, a book fit for a king, was given to Ferdinand and Isabella a few years be fore 1492, when they retook Granada and added the pomegranate (its symbol) to their coat of arms. As a sign of their ownership, they commis sioned a Castilian artist connected with Juan de Carrion to add this splendid ex libris to the manu script The emblems in the inner border reflect the monarchs' conjugal bond, for each used the one belonging to the initial of the other: Ferdinand, the yoke fiugo, the I) and Isabella, the arrow ffle cha, the F). The animals in the outer border offer a prelude to the manuscript, as they are quoted from its miniatures.

Metzl, and Priscilla Wald [ PMLA A Statement of Editorial Policy PMLA welcomes essays of interest to those concerned with the study of lan guage and literature. As the publication of a large and heterogeneous associa tion, the journal is receptive to a variety of topics, whether general or specific, and to all scholarly methods and theoretical perspectives. The ideal PMLA es say exemplifies the best of its kind, whatever the kind; addresses a significant problem; draws out clearly the implications of its findings; and engages the at tention of its audience through a concise, readable presentation. Manuscripts in languages other than English are accepted for review but must be accom panied by a detailed summary in English (generally of 1,000-1,500 words) and must be translated into English if they are recommended to the Edito rial Board. Articles of fewer than 2,500 words or more than 9,000 words are not considered for publication. The word count includes notes but excludes works-cited lists and translations, which should accompany foreign language quotations. The MLA urges its contributors to be sensitive to the social im plications of language and to seek wording free of discriminatory overtones. Only members of the association may submit articles to PMLA. For a collab oratively written essay to be eligible for submission, all coauthors must be mem bers of the MLA. PMLA does not publish book reviews, new works of fiction, or articles that were previously published in any language. Each article submitted is sent to two reviewers, usually one consultant reader and one member of the Advisory Committee. Articles recommended by these readers are then sent to the members of the Editorial Board, who meet periodically with the editor to make final decisions. Until a final decision is reached, the author's name is not made known to consultant readers, to members of the Advisory Committee and the Editorial Board, or to the editor. Because the submission of an article simultaneously to more than one refereed journal can result in duplication of the demanding task of reviewing the manuscript, it is PALLA's policy not to review articles that are under consideration by other journals. An article found to have been simultaneously submitted elsewhere will not be published in PMLA even if it has already been accepted for publication by the Editorial Board. Submissions, prepared according to the MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing, should be sent in duplicate as hard copy to the Managing Editor, PMLA, Modern Language Association, 26 Broadway, 3rd floor, New York, NY 10004-1789. With each submission please include a self-addressed envelope and enough postage for one copy to be returned. Authors' names should not appear on manuscripts; instead, a cover sheet, with the author's name and address and the title of the article, should accompany each manuscript. Authors should not refer to themselves in the first person in the submitted text or notes if such references would identify them; any necessary references to the author's previous work, for example, should be in the third person. If the contribution includes any materials (e.g., quotations that exceed fair use, illustrations, charts, other graphics) that have been taken from another source, the author must obtain written permission to reproduce them in print and electronic formats. 358</page><page sequence="9">12 4-2 ] Features in PMLA Manuscripts and correspondence related to the features described below should be sent to the Managing Editor, PMLA, Modern Language Associa tion, 26 Broadway, 3rd floor, New York, NY 10004-1789. Special Topic Articles on the general topic are invited; the subtopics listed are provided by way of example and suggestion only. Submissions to PMLA must meet the requirements given in the statement of editorial policy. Celebrity, Fame, Notoriety Deadline for submissions: 1 April 2009 Coordinators: Joseph A. Boone (Univ. of Southern California) and Nancy J. Vickers (Bryn Mawr Coll.) Napoleon said that "glory is fleeting, but obscurity is forever." PMLA invites analyses of lives, objects, and events that escaped obscurity?however tem porarily?and achieved the incandescence of fame. How have definitions of celebrity, fame, infamy, and notoriety changed from ancient to postmod ern times? Are there differences across cultures? Are there constants? Are there transformative moments? What are the roles of patronage, market ing, spectacle, and various media in the invention of celebrity? Is the price of acclaim most often ignominy? Who or what are celebrity's others? The Editorial Board invites essays on a wide range of topics throughout history, from criminal broadsides to the lives of martyrs and saints, from the self promotion of charlatans to the disclaimers of reluctant superstars, from the gossip of the literary salon to that of the online chat room. Criticism in Translation MLA members are invited to submit to the PMLA Editorial Board pro posals for translations. Articles, as well as chapters or sections of books that can function as independent units, will be considered. The originals may be in any language. Two types of proposals are welcome: (1) significant scholarship from earlier periods that has not lost its forcefulness and whose retrieval in English in PMLA would be a noteworthy event for a broad body of readers and (2) contemporary work of sufficient weight and potential influence to merit the attention of the field as a whole. A member who wishes to make a proposal should first ascertain that no previous English translation exists. The proposer should then provide the managing editor with the following materials: (1) a photocopy of the original essay, (2) an extended summary of the entire essay in English, (3) an introductory statement of approximately 1,000 words, prepared in accordance with MLA style, that will be published with the essay if the essay is accepted, (4) information on the copyright status of the original (if Forthcoming in PMLA In other issues Paul Benzon.

Lane Fox explores the trail left by these "travelling heroes" in fascinating detail, bringing a hitherto dark era brilliantly to life again, and in the process exposing the roots of much that would influence Greek thought and ideas in the great centuries to come.

In response to a question such as "Who sang the song?" English speakers can say "JOE sang the song", indicating the narrow focus of the answer by an accent on "Joe" and by the absence of accents on the following words. It has been claimed that in some Romance languages accent cannot be used to indicate focus in this way. Such languages choose instead to alter the grammatical structure of the response, for instance "The song, it was sung by Joe". In this case, "Joe" is moved to an accentual prominent position. Estebas-Vilaplana shows that in fact the "English-type" mechanism of achieving focus by re-structuring the prosody is fully available to a Central Catalan speaker and goes on to explore the details of its implementation. In doing this, she investigates quite a number of basic issues in the intonational analysis of Catalan within the Autosegmental-Metrical framework. She makes an interesting discovery that Central Catalan has a boundary tone aligned with the end of the word, and hence that a word level should be incorporated into the prosodic hierarchy. Eva Estebas-Vilaplana currently works at the Distance Learning University in Spain (UNED) as a lecturer in phonetics. She has published many papers on the intonation of Catalan and Spanish. She is the author of the book "Teach Yourself English Pronunciation". ISBN 978 3 89586 137 6. LINCOM Studies in Phonetics 03.247pp. USD 80.60.2009. La variation intonative dialectale en frangais Une approche phonologique Svetlana Kaminskaia, Universite de Waterloo Les etudes comparees de l'intonation francaise (FF) et quebecoise (FQ) decrivent la premiere comme etant moins modulee et ayant une etendue plus compacte par rapport a la seconde. Quels indices prosodiques creent ces effets? Nous supposons que les dialectes partagent la meme grammaire intonative et different dans les facons dont elle est realisee en surface. Pour tester cette hypothese, nous adoptons le cadre metrique autosegmental et analysons les realisations d'un contour de continuity bBH en parole spontanee sur deux niveaux prosodiques. En fonction du niveau, la realisation du contour est comparee a l'aide de la normalisation par cote-z et du transfert des courbes dans Prosogramme. Les differences suivantes sont revelees: les valeurs des tons b sont plus hautes et les valeurs des tons B sont plus basses en FQ par rapport au FF, ce qui donne des ecarts entre les tons plus grands en FQ. Ces ecarts ressortent comme marqueurs dialectaux. Les tons H ont des valeurs proches en FQ, alors qu'en FF, le ton H du groupe final est plus haut que les autres, ce qui produit des modulations plus regulieres en FQ. ISBN 978 3 89586 561 9.

The L1 in L2 learning Teachers' beliefs and practices Yanan Song &amp; Stephen Andrews, Shanghai International Studies University; The University of Hong Kong Opinions concerning the use of the LI in L2 learning and teaching have differed markedly over the years. For much of the past century, it has generally been asserted by theorists and methodologists that the LI has a largely negative influence on L2 learning and that its use should therefore be kept to an absolute minimum in L2 teaching. However, in recent years this position has been called into question, leading to the beginnings of a reassessment of previous orthodoxies. This book sets out to examine this controversial issue of the LI in L2 teaching and learning from the perspective of the practitioner rather than the theorist. Focusing on the cases of four L2 teachers, all of whom share the same LI as their students, this book investigates in depth the attitudes these four teachers hold towards the L1 in their L2 teaching, the extent to which their attitudes are reflected in their LI-related behaviours in class, and the factors they perceive as influences on their beliefs and behaviours. The book contributes to our understanding of teachers' perceptions of the L1 as a medium of instruction in L2 teaching and of their LI -related practices when faced with day-to-day classroom realities. It examines the potential implications of these enhanced understandings for teacher education. ISBN 978 389586 578 7.

Lemire convinces the reader that the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries witnessed an often shrill argument for intra-racial, as opposed to inter-racial, coupling in the northeastern United States.
