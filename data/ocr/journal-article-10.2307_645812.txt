<plain_text><page sequence="1">Being Changed: The Anthropology of Extraor- dinary Experience. DAVID E. YOUNG and JEAN-GUY GOULET, eds. Ontario, Canada: Broadview Press, 1994. 378 pp., tables, notes, references, index. JOHN C. MCCALL Southern Illinois University, Carbondale Despite a few well-crafted chapters, this book fails to live up to its title. A cogent examination of how anthropologists are practically and philosophi- cally challenged and transformed by the experience of long-term field research would be useful. If this examination had included the impact such transfor- mation of the subject has on the process and prod- uct of ethnographic representation, it could have been a timely statement on the current status of criti- cal reflexive anthropology. Instead, Being Changed is an uneven collection of personal accounts of spirit sightings, written by anthropologists and anthropol- ogy students. Throughout the book there is an un- derlying theme: that experiences of this sort are common among anthropologists but are suppressed for fear that such revelations would lead to profes- sional ostracism. This suggestion is belied by the fact that the authors have no trouble finding many published examples of such revelations, including those written by such notables as Evans-Pritchard. I contend that this putative fear of ostracism is a red herring that leads some of the authors to miscon- strue criticism regarding crucial methodological problems and theoretical issues. These issues are best illustrated by the positive example set by the few contributors who avoid these problems altogether and provide us with models for how such experiences can be produc- tively integrated into the ethnographic endeavor. Marie Francoise Gu6don and Edith Turner both succeed in this integration because they devote de- tailed attention to the ethnographic task. While the authors' visionary experiences are analytically im- portant, they are contextualized within a broader understanding of the societies in question. The final goal is always based on a studied commitment to understanding the culture in its own right. In his own chapter, Goulet gives a number of ex- amples of dream interpretation from the Guajiro in Colombia and the Cree and Dene in Canada. He discusses dreams and visions as products of cultur- ally specific symbolic systems and suggests that vi- sions have a symbolic structure in much the same way that our thoughts have a linguistic structure. Fi- nally, he examines ways in which his own visionary experiences have helped him to interpret events in his own life. The break between the ethnographic and the personal is rougher here: I am struck, for ex- ample, by the impersonal character of the Native American dream interpretations compared to the self-referential nature of the interpretations that Goulet and his Dene friend give to his own dreams. Some of the authors, such as Laughlin, are strik- ingly distrustful of indigenous theories while seek- ing validation for phenomena they have experi- enced. This is all the more curious because Laughlin's subject matter (techniques of Tibetan yoga) is the object of extensive indigenous exegetic scholarship. Instead, he resorts to something he calls biogenetic structuralism, through which he at- tempts to explain yogic experiences by reducing se- lected concepts from Hindu and Buddhist philoso- phy into what is essentially a neurological model. His methods, however, are phenomenological and revolve around something that he calls "psychic en- ergy" (p. 106), which is, in his construction, the stuff of perception. Somewhere in the midst of all this, I began to wonder where the monks with their bells and chants were. This, it appears, is a study of yoga without yogis-a fatal oversight, in my opinion, in any book on the anthropology of experience. This move away from the study of people and so- ciety and into the personal life, experience, and in- terpretations of the anthropologist leads several of the authors astray, the most troubling examples be- ing Rab Wilkie, who reveals in the final pages that his chapter is a total fabrication, and Yves Martin, who gives a shameless defense of Carlos Cas- taneda. In their concluding chapter the editors ask, "If other societies do not take for granted our West- ern notions of reality, is it analytically useful to draw a distinction between the real and the imagi- nary?" (pp. 309-310). They never get around to providing their answer to this question. It seems to me that, when members of those cultures that have traditionally been the objects of anthropological analysis come forward with cogent criticism of such personal representations as projections of Western imagination and bias, it is not only "analytically useful" but also analytically and ethically crucial to make such a distinction. Young and Goulet, how- ever, remain uncertain. For the most part, the other authors fail to bring the ethnographic component into clear view. They focus instead, to varying degrees, on personal quests to understand their own visionary experi- ences and to link these to a larger theory of such ex- periences. Some of the contributors emphasize the importance of "taking our informants seriously" (pp. 13, 195) but then treat the distinction between their informants' worldview and their own as un- problematic. Anthropologists since Malinowski have often championed the "native's view," and I have made similar statements in my own work, but with a caveat that seems to be largely missing here: namely, that questions of "belief," "validity," and a static conception of "truth" hold a specific position in a Western epistemology grounded simultane- ously in enlightenment rationalism and in Judeo- Christian tradition. When these assumptions are un- critically brought to bear upon practices and discourses with different historical grounding, prob- lems arise that are not always apparent to the true believer. This point is, in fact, made by Guedon, and others would gain by heeding her advice. Anthropology of Religion: A Handbook. STEPHEN D. GLAZIER, ed. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1997. viii + 542 pp., select topical bibliography, contributors, index. CHARLES STEWART University College London reviews 511</page><page sequence="2">This collection of 19 articles provides a welcome overview of anthropological studies of religion. The topics covered include the origin of religion (Guthrie); research on "great traditions" such as Buddhism (Lewis) and Islam (Starrett); the study of ritual in Africa (Guenther), Japan (Tucker), and In- dia (Claus) and among Native North Americans (Grim); and approaches to shamanism and altered states of consciousness (Townsend, Pandian, and Winkelman). Even more impressive than this topical breadth is the variety of methodologies illustrated: the reflexive ethnography of religious practice (Birckhead, Wagner); the neurophysiology and cog- nitive psychology of religious experiences (Winkel- man, Laughlin); the rationalist, philosophical analy- sis of beliefs (Lett, Brown, and Guthrie); and the use of textual historical sources (Starrett, Mahmood, and Lewis). Although some of the articles could be recommended to undergraduates, this is not in- tended as a textbook; it is, as the editor points out, more a reference book for professionals and gradu- ate students. In my view it is an excellent textbook for instructors of the anthropology of religion, and it comes just as the American Anthropological Asso- ciation has recognized the field through the crea- tion of the Anthropology of Religion section. What distinguishes the anthropological approach to religion from theological, historical, sociological, journalistic, or other approaches? This is a question that may potentially produce discomfort among an- thropologists of religion. No one wants to place rigid boundaries between anthropology and other disciplines, yet there must be some compelling rea- son why we call ourselves anthropologists. It used to be that anthropologists could be recognized by their focus on relatively small social groups in places such as Africa and Melanesia. But today plenty of anthropologists undertake research in North America, an issue that Wagner addresses in his essay on some of the problems (such as the in- creased possibility that observers may confuse the anthropologist with the faithful) posed by research at "home." Moreover, while it should not come as a surprise that Native American religions continue to receive anthropological attention, Grim shows us that the relevant approaches are changing. He up- dates us on current research into new trends such as the proliferation of recently reinvented traditions re- introduced to express identity in the inviting con- text of American multiculturalism. In addition, an apparent growth area in the anthropology of reli- gion in the United States, the study of minority relig- ions such as Santeria and Vodun is the subject of a chapter by Duntley. More attention, however, could usefully have been given to the popular fasci- nation in North America with New Age phenom- ena such as UFOs, Wicca, and channeling. In his account of his long-term study of Christian Appalachian snake handling, Birckhead presents a valuable case study exemplifying the salience of fieldwork in the anthropology of religion. Excerpts from his field notes give a picture of exhausting fieldwork: all-night truck rides crisscrossing Ap- palachia from one end to the other; little sleep in between (the heat is not even alluded to); and atten- dance at religious services in which poisonous snakes (precariously controlled by their handlers) were held a few inches away from him. Through prayer and "anointment" these handlers achieve "victory" over the serpents. As if the challenge of sustaining a snakebite were not enough, these same congregants sometimes drink strychnine or other poisons. Birckhead does not present a thorough so- ciological analysis of snake handling, nor does he systematically scrutinize the "beliefs" of the han- dlers, omissions that could form the basis for criti- cism of his article. In leaving these dimensions aside, however, he achieves greater narrative im- pact. His evocation of serpent handling possesses force and credibility. When one of his closest friends and key informants dies from a snakebite af- ter he has returned to graduate school in Canada, his immediate response is to catch the next plane back to Tennessee for the funeral. Birckhead's com- bination of ethnography and reflexivity exemplifies the anthropology of religion at its most distinctive. The anthropological study of "world religions" is a demanding area in which much comparative work remains to be done. In his consideration of anthropological studies of Islam from Malaysia to Morocco, Starrett raises the key question of how one "religion" can be localized and accommodated in so many different ways. Lewis considers similar issues with respect to Buddhism, again drawing on an extensive bibliography of work in this area. Mahmood uses her chapter on Hinduism to exam- ine Hindu representations of this religion as toler- ant. When asked, for example, how it is that Bud- dhism could arise on Indian soil and then almost completely disappear from it, India's first prime minister Nehru and countless others frequently have responded that Buddhism arose from Hindu- ism as a reform movement and disappeared once Hinduism had absorbed the reforms. Historical sources, however, record numerous episodes of In- dian kings destroying Buddhist shrines and killing thousands of lay Buddhists in Kashmir and other ar- eas. This is the (unmentionable) aggressive side of hierarchical encompassment, a volatile point to make in the wake of recent events at Amritsar and Ayodhya. Numerous authors address the nature and role of apparently irrational beliefs, and here some differ- ences of opinion are evident. Lett argues forcefully that propositions about the paranormal (a term he prefers to supernatural) are "propositionally mean- ingless" (pp. 110-11 1) and therefore fundamentally "irrational" (p. 111). He urges anthropologists not to allow their relativism to cloud their ability to dis- tinguish people's rights to their beliefs from the rightness of those beliefs. Brown points out that "magic" is probably not a universal category. Rather than isolating the irrationality of magical ideas and practices, one can see them as continuous with everyday practical activities. As it involves creative thinking, magic can be a first step toward practical innovation or even science. Winkelman's approach to the soul flight and spirit world of shamanism is to locate the source of these perceptions in the neurophysiology of the hu- man brain. Such ideas are produced cross-culturally by specific, biologically describable altered states of consciousness. Townsend agrees that altered states of consciousness are perhaps among the few 512 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="3">essential criteria definitive of shamanism, and Laughlin further points out that Euro-American so- cieties give credence only to experiences during normal waking phases of consciousness. Euro- Americans live in a relatively monophasic culture, while shamans operate in polyphasic cultures. For Pandian and Guthrie, gods and spirits are not to be dismissed, normalized, or seen as the inevita- ble effects of states of consciousness but are to be treated existentially as images that strengthen hu- man identity and understanding. Guthrie argues that these transcendent beings are almost always anthropomorphic because that is the way they originated. Early humans personified cosmic forces, much as chimpanzees can be seen to issue threats against thunderstorms that disturb them. The body and the human social world serve as obvious source domains for representing the unknown. Guthrie does not contend that this originary logic still governs our approach to transcendent beings. Indeed, he cautions against conflating origin and utility. Ideas about anthropomorphic transcendent beings may or may not be useful today, but they arose early and simply have not, as yet, been dis- lodged. Pandian views gods and spirits as "sacred others" (p. 506); priests communicate with them while shamans commune with them. These powers enable the formulation of coherent human selves at a cultural, semiotic level; they are not reducible to psychology. I hope that the above outline indicates the rich pickings to be found in this collection. The only weakness of the volume is that little effort was put into compiling a rigorous index, which would have enabled scholars to cross-reference key concepts and ideas. In all other respects this book is well con- ceived. There is wisdom in the diversity assembled here. Scope and variety, perhaps more than any- thing else, is what the anthropology of religion is about. Imagined Childhoods: Self and Society in Autobiographical Accounts. MARIANNE GULLESTAD, ed. Oslo: Scandinavian Univer- sity Press, 1996. viii + 244 pp., notes, refer- ences, contributors. RITTY A. LUKOSE University of Chicago Historians of Europe have pointed to the histori- cal specificity of conceptions of childhood. In the medieval era, the child was considered a miniature adult, hardly distinguishable in dress and activity from adult counterparts. Between the 15th and 18th centuries, with bourgeois notions of family and in- dividuality and with the separation of public and private, the modern conception of childhood emerged as a separate domain: a space of inno- cence and play radically different from the corrupt world of adults. This bourgeois ideal gradually per- meated society and moved beyond Europe through the medical, legal, and educational institutions of colonialism. In the United States we are witnessing a new moral panic about childhood, its "loss" and "end," as narratives of child abuse, violence by children, and the commodification of children's ac- tivities and bodies intensify. If the early modern pe- riod asserted a certainty about children as emphati- cally not adults, today the lines between childhood and adulthood are increasingly blurred. In her comprehensive introduction Gullestad situates Imagined Childhoods within this historical framework. This conference volume is generated from a renewed, interdisciplinary, and critical focus on constructions of childhood, sponsored by the Norwegian Centre for Child Research. The volume begins with the observation that all discourses of childhood are adult retrospective visions. Child- hoods are imagined and narrated; they are crucial, furthermore, for the production of "modern selves." The contributors to the volume examine the form and content of imagined childhoods through auto- biographies and elicited life stories. Thus the vol- ume is also an attempt to "redefine texts in relation to experiences, lives, and contexts without reduc- ing the texts to mere reflections of prior realities" (p. 14). While this interdisciplinary textual focus of the volume is generally engaging, it leads to some the- matic unevenness. Most of the contributors examine autobiographies, but some are more successful than others at linking the literary and the social. Olney examines the "writer's childhoods" of Richard Wright, Mary Mc- Carthy, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Wole Soyinka that thematize the discovery of the power of story- telling and the production of the authorial "I." Elbaz examines the postcolonial condition through the autobiographies of Elias Canetti, Albert Memmi, and Katia Rubinstein. These narratives of childhood situate the emergence of the young writer or poet in the interface between the colonized and the colo- nizer. This interface makes impossible the retrieval of any authentic "origin"; it is this that becomes the condition of possibility of the postcolonial text. Fabre and Koester also examine autobiographies but link them more directly to social and historical processes outside the text itself. Fabre examines 19th-century French narratives of "rustic childhoods" in the autobiographical writings of Lamartine, Chateaubriand, and Victor Hugo, among others. He deftly links their obsession with birds (bird catching, searching for birds' nests) not only to the production of a young masculinity intent on mas- tery over nature but also to the association of social change through schooling and literacy in 19th-cen- tury rural France. In an engaging essay Koester ex- amines the relationship between imagined child- hoods and imagined nations in Iceland. While examining specific autobiographies, he links them to a generalized practice of "life-historical writing" (p. 137) that he sees as a ubiquitous social practice, appearing in newspapers, weeklies, obituaries, and popular memorials. This writing forms a narrative of the nation as literacy, and the literary conventions of storytelling become part of the Icelandic national imaginary. Koester goes on to examine how inti- mate childhood memories are narrativized through the tropes of the Icelandic nation: farm life, the Ice- landic landscape, and images of motherly women in national dress. Most interesting, these narratives often include memories of reading to the family in the evening, which the Iceland independence reviews 513</page></plain_text>
