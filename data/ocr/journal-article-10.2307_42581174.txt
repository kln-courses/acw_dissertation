In the present century, this difficulty has grown so formid- able that some are inclined to doubt the possibility of giving an ordinary language interpretation to the contemporary vocabulary of mathematical signs. It is even held that the kind of understanding we might get from ordinary language is un- necessary now that physics has mastered the powerful language of mathematics - that the demand for translation of the analytical symbols may definitely hinder analytical thinking. It is difficult to translate from mathematics to words because words have not only conscious but unconscious meaning. Mathematics, on the other hand, as a logical, intellectual structure, has only conscious meaning. Thus, mathematics is free from those unconscious associations words have which may be detrimental to understanding the physical world. Consider the word "force" and the symbol F as it is used in Newton's * Department of Physics, Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee. 308</page><page sequence="2">Summer 1954 DISCUSSION Second Law: F ~ a (force is proportional to acceleration). "Force" is a term of aggression. When force is applied successfully between men, behavior will be altered in conformity with the will of the applier, presumably against the will of another. If the symbol F is to be translated into this anthropomorphic concept "force," it must follow, implicitly at least, that the interaction of objects is the application of the will of one over the will of the other suffering some change in its behavior.1 On the basis of these unconscious assumptions, one is likely to ask further questions. If an object is observed to be accelerating, and the F associated with the acceleration is translated into the common sense term "force" with its associated connotations, one is likely to ask, "Who is the master' of this object? What will' is determining the behavior of this 'weaker' thing, etc.?" If the object is attached to a string, one will look for the hand at the other end. But there may be no string. How then is the "will of the master" com- municated? In order for F to be identified with "force," there must be a medium through which the force is transmitted, and so to keep this identity in the case of non-contact forces (e.g., gravitation). Physicists were once persuaded to postulate an "ether," the universal medium over which forces were supposed to be transmitted and which in terms of more rigorous analysis turned out to have no meaning at all. Relativity changing its theory perspective finally from showed a dynamic the inequivalence to a geometric of frame F and of reference. force by changing its perspective from a dynamic to a geometric frame of reference. As a geometric theory, relativity can be more "accepting" of phenomena than dynamics, because relativity theory has no need of the concept "force." In translating newtonian mechanics into everyday language, it was natural to in- terpret the behavior of a body changing the direction of its motion as follows: the body "wants" to go in a straight line but is prevented from doing so by the force acting upon it, i.e., the straight line is the most preferred line of motion. Relativity theory, on the other hand, does not blame "forces" for frustrating the preferences of moving objects. It argues that the preferred path is a consequence of the geometry of the region in which the body finds itself and that this pre- ferred path is always chosen. Anthropomorphically speaking, relativity theory is more "permissive" than the newtonian. Relativity theory combines the three-dimensional space and the one-dimen- sional time of newtonian mechanics into a four-dimensional continuum, which is, moreover non-euclidean in the neighborhood of matter. This means that in the neighborhood of matter the preferred paths (which are always the shortest) are not straight lines. For example, near the earth's surface the path of a pro- jectile should be a parabola, because it is the shortest path in the space-time continuum, not because the earth's gravitational force "forces" the projectile to 1 For further discussion of this point, see Anatol Rapoporťs "Newtonian Physics and Aviation Cadets," ETC., I (1944), 154-164. 309</page><page sequence="3">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS vol. XI, NO. 4 depart from its preferred path, which is always a straight line.2 Calling non- euclidean space euclidean necessitated the symbol F and its identification with "force." The difficulty with the word "force" as a translation for F is inevitable, be- cause words express man's inner preferences, and one of these preferences seems to be for a space that is euclidan. While successful mathematical symbols may be abstracted from the verbal language (in the case of F, it is only partially successful), these symbols can transcend the limitations of the words from which they grew. In turn, new mathematical symbols are not wholly trans- latable into words and the extra intelligence which they contain cannot, in general, affect our essential prespectives. Thus the insights derived from rela- tivity theory (that space is non-euclidean, time non-transcendent, F only rela- tive) cannot be expected to be wholly adequate translations of the mathematical intelligence of this theory. Though these insights do indicate the errors of some of our inner preferences, they do not constitute a sufficient experience to alter our nature so that the concepts of non-euclidean space could satisfy us. WE are draw never the entirely conclusion translatable that because into words, the symbols as the of analysis mathematical becomes physics more are never entirely translatable into words, as the analysis becomes more penetrating and profound, the separation of words and symbols will increase. This means that inevitably the advancing analytical (mathematical) knowledge becomes less satisfying emotionally, for only words through their unconscious associations (absent from mathematics) can be psychologically satisfying. There is one situation in which spatial prejudice and reality will coincide, where the word-picture of three-dimensional space will be correct. In a space ship, far from the earth and other celestial bodies, space will be approximately euclidean. Here the preferred path of a projectile will be a straight line. A man in such a space ship should experience relief from the pretense that earth- bound space is euclidean. He would not have to defend his belief that space is euclidean by accusing gravitational force of interfering with his projectiles de- viating from their "natural" paths. At last achieving his ideal geometry, this man might be completely relaxed. It is possible, however, that the verbal language, which expresses not only man's preference for euclidean geometry but also makes provision for its de- fense (e.g., the word "force") might not quite be able at first to realize the new experience. How long it would take a man in a space ship to adjust would probably depend upon his naiveté; a relativist might have an easier time of it. But for any man some period of adjustment would be necessary. "The idea that force represents the discrepancy between the natural geometry of a coordinate system and the abstract geometry abritrarily ascribed to it is discussed by A. S. Eddington in The Mathematical Theory of Relativity (Cambridge: The University Press, 1924). 310</page><page sequence="4">Summer 1954 DISCUSSION It is further possible that the operations of the rocket may make too strong demand upon the man's earth-bound (gravitational) perspective. His bodily coordination, for one thing, would have to adapt itself to the non -gravitational experience. If he were to throw a tool to a companion, he would miss until he learned that the tool would fly in a straight line, not in a parabola. This non- gravitational experience will be accepted by him only when he learns that he need not here defend his belief that space is euclidean, and that his word-picture of space does correspond with the reality of his space. He [the student of politics] must also be on his guard against the old words, for the words persist when the reality that lay behind them has changed. It is inherent in our intellectual activity that we seek to imprison reality in our description of it. Soon, long before we realize it, it is we who become the prisoners of the description. From that point on, our ideas degenerate into a kind of folklore which we pass to each other, fondly thinking we are still talking of the reality around us. Thus we talk of free enterprise, of capitalist society, of the rights of free association, of parliamentary government, as though all of these words stand for the same things they formerly did. Social institutions are what they do, not necessarily what we say they do. It is the verb that matters, not the noun. If this is not understood, we become symbol worshipers. The categories we once evolved and which were the tools we used in our intercourse with reality become hopelessly blunted. In these circumstances the social and political realities we are supposed to be grappling with change and reshape themselves independently of the collective impact of our ideas. We become the creature and no longer the partner of social realities. As we fumble with outworn categories our political vitality is sucked away and we stumble from one situation to another, without chart, without compass, and with the steering-wheel lashed to a course we are no longer following. This is the real point of danger for a political party and for the leaders and thinkers who inspire it. For if they are out of touch with reality, the masses are not.
