<plain_text><page sequence="1">'You Devil, Go Away From Me!' Some Ethnographic Comments on Evil Diseases in a Ghanaian Village* Kodjo A. Senah University of Ghana, Legon Introduction In Ghana, discourses concerning evil forces are very topical and belief in such forces is pervasive. There are many Ghanaians today - literates as well as il literates - who can cite at least one instance when evil forces have attempted to wreck their lives or the lives of other relations. Perhaps, the popularity of newspapers and other forms of literature1 which focus on evil scenarios and the proliferation of spiritual churches, healing crusades, charismatic movements, free lance witch-hunters and fortune-tellers and their ever-growing clientele provide an index of the pervasiveness of belief in evil forces. For the ordinary Ghanaian, these forces are the causes of all human sufferings and misfortunes. Thus all kinds of measures, both defensive and offensive, are adopted to contain them.2 In a very popular local song called 'Ayen' (witchcraft or evil spirits), A.B. Crentsil, a popular local artiste has provided the germ of the Ghanaian's per ception and reaction to evil forces. In a song which indicts the Ghanaian or the African on his perpetual state of poverty and underdevelopment, Crentsil wonders why, unlike the whiteman, the blackman often uses his 'witchcraft' to destroy. Given the relevance of this song to the discussion, I have attempted below an English translation of its lyrics thus: If you have witchcraft, use it to develop your country; If you have witchcraft, don't use it to litigate; Obonsam (the evil monster) is very powerful; He has given us witchcraft to protect ourselves; Some use their witchcraft to cure disease; Kwasi Broni (the whiteman's) witchcraft is good; He has used it to build an aeroplane; When you sit in it you are happy; It takes you back and forth quickly; He has used it to build a train; When you sit in it you are happy; ETNOFOOR, V(l/2) 1992, pp. 129-145 129</page><page sequence="2">It takes you back and forth quickly; But the blackman uses his witchcraft for evil; When he sees his fellowman prospering; He will cause his downfall; He will make him cripple; He will make him blind; So that he will never prosper again; You, devil, go away from me! You, devil, go away from me! You, devil, go away from me! From this song, at least three main issues of common concern to the Ghanaian stand out: a) that evil forces exist; b) that such forces may be used positively or negatively and c) that destructive evil forces must be expunged from society (you devil, go away from me). Attempts to intellectualize the role of extrasensory forces (especially the ma lignant ones) in the affairs of men, have always been a favourite pass-time for a variety of social commentators - philosophers, papapsychologists, moralists, re ligionists and not the least sociologists and anthropologists. For the latter, the focus on the 'exotic', the 'other culture' is enough an attraction to turn atten tion to this phenomenon, especially as it is redramatised in so-called primitive cultural configurations. Yet, in spite of the vast scholarly works on the subject, its unabated topicality appears to be due, in part, to the fact that in spite of the great leaps in science and technology, scientific empiricism is yet to come to full terms with what I call man's 'sentimental substructure', that subjective feeling of powerlessness and insecurity in the face of the unexpected - sudden death, misfortune and illness of unknown and unexplainable aetiology. Clearly, these feelings are as relevant in so-called complex societies as they are in simple ones. Thus given this human mental frame, it may be hypothesised that paranormal forces will always remain a feature of all societies with level of technological development as an important differentiating factor. In Ghana, there seems to be very little work on evil per se; most of the relevant anthropological or sociological works have concentrated on witchcraft (see for in stance Tooth 1950; Christensen 1954; Ward 1956; Goody 1957; Debrunner 1959; Field 1960; McLeod 1966; Jahoda 1970 and Assimeng 1977). For the earlier (pre-1966) and foreign anthropologists, interest in witchcraft was not acciden tal: first it was exotic and second, especially in the colonial period, witchcraft activities tended to inhibit missionary proselytising and constituted a nuisance to the political dispensation. Thus as McLeod observed with regard to Abirewa, an anti-witchcraft movement in 1906, the missionary bodies then active in Asante saw this new 'religion' as a succesful rival to their own proselytising which was at that date making very slow headway. They exerted pressure on the Colonial Administration and produced reports of torture and extortion in cases where mutilated witches had their bodies thrown into shallow 130</page><page sequence="3">graves. The administration fearing that such a pan-Asante movement coming so soon after the Yaa Asantewa War might take on anti-white features, quickly suppressed the new cult and destroyed its paraphernalia and shrines (McLeod 1965:109). Although some of these foreign anthropologists have contributed significant in sights into the phenomenon of witchcraft, often their transitory experiences and lack of adequate understanding of the social structure of the societies they stud ied distorted their observations. For instance in an attempt tot explain the causes of witchcraft and to account for the perceived state of psychological insecurity among Ghanaians in the early 1960s, Field observed: 'Witchcraft exists only in fantasy, in the minds of certain mentally sick people, and is a bewilderment to others. It is therefore likely that if Depression were to die out, belief in witchcraft would die out also. . .' (Field 1960:38). The fallacy in this statement is clear to any student of the Ghanaian social structure. That in spite of the great social and technological advances, a good number of Ghanaians - literates as well as illiterates - still believe strongly in the powers of witchcraft and other evil forces, is certainly neither a sign of mental sickness nor is it an indication of a mass depressive state; it is a modus vivendi. Thus, Field's mono-causal and reductionistic interpretation of such a complex phenomenon is absurd. As Assimeng (1981) has forcefully argued in this regard, it is not appropiate to attempt an understanding of the structure, process and social organization of a society or of its institutional components such as religion and health or the interpretation of fortune and misfortune without a prior understanding of the society's beliefs and practices which afford a striking insight into their immemorial thoughts and craving as well as their morbid fears and wish-fulfilments. One of the methodological problems that has bedeviled witchcraft studies in Ghana is the absence or lack of an appropiate tool or technique for investigating the phenomenon. This problem is further compounded by the lack of definitional clarity and specificity as to who is a witch or what constitutes belief in witchcraft. Clearly, merely identifying a person as a witch or wizard or simply professing belief in manifestation of witchcraft activities is not enough to base any serious conclusions on. This is because witchcraft is a very delicate subject not many Ghanaians would like to discuss openly. Field's experience in Tema attests to this: 'witchcraft is a very difficult subject to investigate; the topic is shrouded in shame and attempts to discuss it often put an end to the conversation' (Field 1960:103). This is why Jahoda's open attempt, through questionnaire, to elicit responses on the direction of belief in witchcraft among university students in Ghana is open to criticism. Indeed, apart from the shame that characterises open discussion of the issue, there are several Ghanaians who unconsciously entertain belief in the phenomenon without being consciously aware of the direction of their belief. Under these circumstances it is not advisable to put much weight on the conclusions of such 'open' enquiries. As Assimeng (1977) suggests, a 131</page><page sequence="4">better approach in any such study should stress not belief or disbelief as such, but rather the attitude and behavioural patterns that men would be prepared to adopt in certain types of problem^olving situation. The manner in which this is actually operationalised in the ritual context has been aptly analysed by Geertz (1966) and the process has been vividly described in a number of ethnographic contexts, most notably by Turner (1967, 1969). In this paper, I have chosen to piece together some relevant ethnographic field notes in an attempt to answer in a system-specific way, how the people of Bor tianor Village perceive evil forces and how these influence their health conditions. The data for this paper were obtained from a wider study in pharmaceutical an thropology in which focused group discussions, gossip, interviews and participant observation featured prominently. As necessary background information to the understanding of the cosmology of the people, I now present a brief description of the social structure of the village. The village setting Bortianor is a Ga-speaking3 coastal village which lies 35 kilometres west of Accra, the capital city of Ghana. According to the 1984 census figures, this village had a population of 3,298 people and recorded an annual population growth rate of 4 percent. At present, its population is estimated to be about 5,000 making it the largest of a cluster of six villages with which it shares cultural and linguistic affinity. The predominant occupations here are subsistence farming and fishing. While fishing takes place throughout the year, farming is done twice a year, following the rainy seasons (April - June and August - October). The last farming season is always followed by a long period of hunger often accentuated by a long and dry harmattan period which incidently coincides with a lean-fish season. Fish and farm produce are generally sold in Accra, leaving very little for domestic consumption. The staple diet - corn meal - is high in carbohydrate content and low in protein and vitamin. As a result of years of chieftancy disputes coupled with grinding pauperism, the village has little or no basic social infrastructural facilities. Although the village is a few kilometres from Accra (and there is constant traffic between these two places) about 95 percent of all homes are built of mud and thatched with dried grass. The 6 kilometre laterite road which leads to the village takes about 30 minutes of motoring because of its very bad state. During the raining season, it is rendered impassable; it is punctuated with sharp edges of granite stones and bifurcated with gullies of running water. The village has no electricity supply, no market and no proper waste disposal sites; the beach and the surrounding vegetation are used for the disposal of human and other organic wastes which are fed on by wandering pigs, goats, sheep and fowls. Although the village has 132</page><page sequence="5">piped water supply this is limited to very few homes which can afford to pay the monthly water bill of 1,500 cedis (US$ 3.75). A few who cannot afford to pay this amount often buy water from such homes. For the majority however, the old unprotected spring water, whose discovery led to the founding of the village, is the main source of water supply. Although the Methodist Church introduced Christianity and western education into the village as far back as the early 1940s, there is very little to show for their effort: for the few Christians (about 5% of the population), Christianity remains, as Busia (1950) has observed elsewhere, a 'thin veneer' as evinced by their readiness to move between Christian and traditional religious practices. Also the few 'literates' have not gone beyond the primary school level. As may be appreciated therefore, Bortianor is a very traditional society in spite of its proximity to the city of Accra. The health status of the village cannot be measured by mortality and morbidity rates; nor can it be measured anthropometrically because there are no official vital statistics of any kind on the village. However, clinic attendance records obtained from the village clinic coupled with my own mortality records compiled over a two-year period give a fair indication of the poor health condition of the people. Children, especially, are most vulnerable in this regard: during the hunger season, especially, they die of diarrhoeal diseases, measles, malaria and whooping cough. The high infant-child mortality rate is reflected in my household interview with 365 adults in the village. This revealed that at least every one of these adults had lost at least a child in the five years preceding the interview. In the case of adults, the average life-span is generally low (about 40 years) and their physical appearance is a crude indicator of this. Poverty and the ruggedness of their occupations have telling effects on their physical structures. Thus among adults senescence creeps in very early in life: a 30 year old adult easily passes for a 40 year old, betrayed by wrinkled skin, several patches of old wounds and poor dentition. For women, senescence is much faster as childbirth begins early in life (normally under 14 years) and is prolific. There is no government health post in the village; nor is there any in the surrounding villages. However, the government offers the villagers a fortnight Primary Health Care (P.H.C.) outreach programme involving immunization of children, family planning services and ante- and post-natal care. It is clear, however, that the provision of these services is not effective: first, the service is not regular because of lack of logistics, especially transportation to convey health personnel to the village. Second, mothers do not patronise these services because children become sick afterwards requiring extra resources for medication. The absence of government health facilities is filled in by private entrepreneurs. There is one clinic run by a retired nurse. This is complemented by two private chemical shops manned by unqualified pharmacists. They also treat patients. In a networking fashion, there are a number of individuals who sell various phar maceuticals in their homes also. These range from analgesics to antibiotics. 133</page><page sequence="6">Below this level, there are two traditional birth attendants, about five tra ditional healers of various specialization, and seven spiritual healers of local 'wonder-working' churches. In situations where all these health facilities and folk medicine are found wanting people travel 35 kilometres to Accra and be yond in search of therapy. Although this is a relatively short distance, in prac tical terms it is not. As stated earlier, the road network linking the village to the city is in a very poor state. Thus transportation costs are relatively high (US$ 0.50 per person per trip) and the vehicles that ply the route are few and work only nine hours daily (6 am to 3 pm). Thus in cases of emergency when a village vehicle must be hired to carry the sick to a hospital in Accra, a driver may charge anything from the equivalence of ten to twenty US dollars which amount is often far beyond the means of most villagers. In such situations the sick may be attended to at home if he or his relatives cannot raise money for his transportation. In spite of the difficulties and hardships imposed by the absence or inadequacy of social infrastructural facilities, the villagers have a very vibrant social life. While the day is devoted to work, the evening is used for communal entertainment such as drumming and dancing or group drinking. On Tuesdays and Fridays, fishing and farming, respectively are tabooed.4 And these are the days often used for outdooring of the newly-born or for funerals. Most evenings are also characterised by long hours of religious sessions especially of the thaumaturgical or the wonder-working churches. These religious sects are heavily patronised, especially by women. A synopsis of the concept and manifestations of evil A discussion on the concept of evil invariably leads to a focus on the notions of morality, ethics and justice. Although African religions have been given extensive literature coverage, these notions except in a few cases (Idowu 1962; Ackah 1988) have not been fully studied. Thus this discussion is largely based on my own observations on and experience with the Ga culture and also on some of the ethnographic works that have made passing references to this issue. The Ga, like most ethnic groups in Ghana, see the universe as peopled with spirits of varying orientation - nature spirits and living-dead ancestors. At the head of this pantheon is God himself who is said to be the creator of all, including human beings. God is said to have put in each of his artifacts not only an essence (a spiritual force) but also the virtues of good and evil. Thus with this ambivalent disposition, a thing may be good and bad at different times depending on circumstances. For instance, although the living-dead ancestors are expected to guide and endow the living with the cherished desires of life-long life, fecundity and abundant food, they can take revenge or punish the living for neglect, disobedience, or inadequate post-mortuary rites. 134</page><page sequence="7">The Ga believe that there are people in the community who are capable of tapping the powers of the spiritual realm for good or for evil. Such persons include traditional healers, witches, sorcerers and magicians. Thus among the Ga these constitute the centre of evil. To them a mystical power is neither good or evil, per se: when used maliciously against the individual's and community interest, it is experienced as evil. Among the Ga, evil spirit is known generically as mumofon (bad spirit). In another context, mumofon may also be used to indicate bad or wicked character of a person without necessarily imputing any spiritual connection. Manoukian (1964) and Field (1960) who have studied this phenomenon among the Ga prefer the term abonsam. However, it appears that this term is very restrictive in its application. The word abonsam, though of local origin, is generally used in Christian circles to refer to the biblical fallen Lucifer and his associates. In daily parlance, however, mumofon has a wider currency than abonsam. In the Ga demonology, a distinction is often made between 'moral evil' and 'natural evil'. The former refers to interpersonal transgressions, breaches of the right conduct. Thus a man who engages in the sexual act with his neighbour's wife has done moral evil, the act offends the collective conscience. In this regard good character is 'good' because it does not offend the collective conscience. It appears reasonable therefore to suggest that the basis of the concept of moral good or bad is ultimately based on the nature of the conduct vis-a-vis societal norms and values. Natural evil on the other hand involves suffering, diseases, calamity, death, accidents and other forms of pain. Although these may be explained through 'natural' causes, within the context of the village, such events do not happen 'by accident'. In the search for the causes, a morally bankrupt person is often the target: his breach of the social morality is said to be the cause of the problem. Such a person may be a known witch, sorcerer, an aged or a wicked person. Indeed, the victim of natural evil may also be held responsible for his condition if he is known to have committed moral evil. For instance, a paturient with obstructed labour-complications may be said to be undergoing punishment for her infidelity. Given the nature of the people's demonology, evil forces are personified or have the potential to manifest themselves in a variety of entities. I have identified these as follows: a) human beings; b) humanlike beings; c) non-human objects; and d) spirits. Evil persons, or at least those with potential for evil include those perceived as wicked people or simply people with odd characteristics. Such persons may be known murderers or simply persons who commit very grievious offences. Also very old persons may be considered evil especially when they are known to have lived 'wicked' lives. Such murderers and old persons are called aye (witch or wizzard). In the case of old persons they may also be called suio (sorcerer). Indeed, in a number of cases, persons accused of being witches or wizards or 135</page><page sequence="8">sorcerers are old men and women from whom 'confessions' of witchery are often extracted. The Ga, like other ethnic groups in Ghana, believe that witchcraft, sorcery and magic may be bought, inherited or forcibly imposed on a person by a malicious parent or relative. Another class of human beings imputed to have evil powers include twins, the mentally-retarded, the hydrocephalous, the mongoloid, the precocious child, those with an improperly developed sixth finger or toe, those born breach (i.e. born legs-first) and those who survive after their mothers have experienced repeated still-births (gbobaloi).5 In all these cases, inherent good or evil may be given the vent depending on how they are treated. For instance, a parent who fails to perform the necessary rituals relating to twin births may either lose the twins or suffer any imaginable misfortune. Evil forces may also manifest themselves in anthropomorphic entities such as dwarfs (asamanukpa), mermaids (mamiwater) and even fish with human organs. In folklore, dwarfs are known to reward or punish people according to their deeds. Often celebrated healers and hunters claim to have perfected their arts through contacts with dwarfs. Dwarfs are said to be, among others, to be forest-dwellers, short, hairy and they have their feet turned in the opposite direction. They are also said to be capable of kidnapping and whipping wrong-doers. Such persons eventually die from their ordeal. Although every Ghanaian knows mamiwater, she does not seem to feature prominently in the villagers' demonology. The popular view about her is that those who go fishing on Tuesday are likely to meet her and such persons usually die soon after their encounter. Another fish said to have a human characteristic is the giant shark. The female shark is said to have two long breasts just as human females and it is said to be a bad omen if it is caught. Thus even when caught at sea, it is let back. How do evil forces manifest themselves in the third category of entities, the non-human natural objects? It must be explained that these entities include a wide range of natural phenomena - animals, reptiles, birds, rivers, hills, thunder and lightening, the sea, etc. For the Ga, all these phenomena have essence whose disposition can make or unmake society. They, therefore, must be 'bribed' with undue ritualism and sacrementalism for the promotion of societal welfare. Although these entities are thought to possess good and evil disposition, there are some which are evil ipso facto: the owl, the snake, black dogs, cats, sheep and goats are evil and are quickly done away with; in the latter, their black colour is supposed to make them evil. Indeed, in this village domestic fowls can be considered evil as in the case of the cock that crows at odd hours. Such a fowl may be given out in ritual sacrifice or sold. Of all these, however, the owl is the most feared. One afternoon while I was carrying out my study in the village I noticed that the entire village had gone hysterical because of an owl which emerged from nowhere. With the air filled with cries of 'aye 0000V (witch oooo!), men, women and children were running after an owl and throwing every conceivable missile at it. And whenever it landed on a tree close to a house, the 136</page><page sequence="9">occupants sensing imminent danger or calamity would become more hysterical and frantic. Finally, when the owl landed on a silk-cotton tree under which lay the shrine of Tono Buatsi, the guardian spirit of the village, it was brought down and killed with an unimagined degree of brutality and revenge, far greater than the physical size of the little bird would require. As to be imagined, the rest of the day was devoted to discussion on witchcraft and other forms of evil forces. However, the following day when an old lady died, it was openly said that the owl was the old lady! Spirits are also thought to have an ambivalent character as explained earlier. These are of two different types - human-based and non-human-based spirits. The former is made up of people who die naturally or violently. Those who die naturally become ghosts (sisa) and depending on the attitude of the living towards them, they may be benevolent or malevolent. However, those who die a violent death such as through a road-accident, drowning, child-birth compli cations, murder, etc. become evil spirits (otofo) and continue to frighten people until the necessary rituals are performed to placate their spirits. The non-human based spirits in this village include the two main commu nal gods: Solo, the goddess of the water-source and Tono Buatsi, the over-all guardian whose main duty is to detect witches and malevolents who enter the village. Beside these, every family has its own god (dzemawon) while some in dividuals possess personal gods (won) as well. The latter are often bought and made to serve personal gratifications - antisocial or pro-social. In a society as traditional as Bortianor, evil forces are capable of manifesting themselves in a variety of instances. However, the determination of which event is evil-induced depends on several antecedent factors including the quality of one's relationship with relations and neighbours, one's social position, when the event occurred and the social presentation of the event itself. As explained earlier, in this society, spiritual forces are capable of doing anything and everything: they can cause storm, draught, crop failure, diseases and sudden death, among others. However, in order to understand how these forces work against human beings, it is necessary to have an insight into the local dogma of human personality. The Ga believe that every human being is made up of three main elements: the gbomotso (the physical body), the susuma and the kla. The susuma is a spiritual element on which depends a person's individuality. It is volatile and is able to leave the body during dreams. Witches can cause a person's death simply by capturing his susuma; in the same way a person can suffer all kinds of harm from malevolents when the susuma is attacked spiritually. Kla corresponds to a person's destiny; it originates with creation. The Ga believe that during creation, God assigns every person a kla and charges this with specific tasks on earth. The kJa, like any human being, may be offended through a person's misbehaviour. It is not very clear whether a person's kla can be influenced by the activities of others - benevolent or malevolent. However, it is clear from discussions with the villagers that the kla, the susuma, and the 137</page><page sequence="10">gbomotso axe so interrelated that what affects one affects all. Thus, while the kla may be insulated from the direct attack of evil forces, it nonetheless suffers also when the susuma and the gbomotso are assailed by these forces. Health seeking behaviour Against the background of this demonology and human personality structure, the discussion may be contextualized with an examination of health conditions perceived as evil-induced and how such conditions are managed by the people. Generally, the Ga denote all forms of diseases and illnesses as heia. Heia, to them, is far more behavioural than biological. In other words, a person may be regarded sick simply by exhibiting a reduced level of social functioning (e.g. eating less than usual). Heia may be classified into four main types: (a) helafolo which are ordinary, common and non-spiritistic ailments (e.g. cold, catarrh, fever, etc.); (b) helafon which are serious non-spiritistic ailments (e.g. tuberculosis, jaundice, etc.); (c) suuhela which are illnesses resulting from sorcery, witchcraft and (d) mumonhela which are illnesses resulting from one's transgressions against the conduct-codes of the ancestors, the communal or personal gods. As experience has shown, these classes of health conditions are not mutually exclusive; in several instances they overlap, given the processual nature of illness. Thus as often happens, a simple case such as headache may easily degenerate to become helafon, suuhela and mumonhela depending on the circumstances, and the character of the person involved. Clearly, however, rare ailments such as leprosy, oedema, epilepsy, mental illness, blindness, infertility and those which occur suddenly and are incapacitating and fatal automatically qualify for the last three categorizations. As often occurs, in this village as soon as a person begins to feel unwell, his first action is to diagnose his problem as atridii (fever) and for which he pro cures a few antimalarial and analgesic tablets from the chemist. If this condition does not improve after three days, he may visit the village clinic or try herbal concoction. Generally, after this, it is expected that his condition will improve. However, if his condition degenerates instead and he becomes bed-ridden, then his condition may be redefined and the services of the traditional healer, diviner, the spiritualist or the main hospital in Accra, will be utilized alternatively or concurrently. Given this mode of health seeking, the process of illness may be seen in three zones: (a) white, (b) red and (c) black. The white represents the normal beginnings of a state of disease; the red represents a degenerated condi tion and the black a desperate situation. As to be expected, the red and black zones are the areas where evil forces are said to have entered the health drama and for which appropriate responses are provided. The cases below provide a real-life situation of the discussion so far. 138</page><page sequence="11">Case One Kai is a young lady of about 25 years. She is a non-Christian. As a prosperous drinking bar operator she looks much younger than her age. She is barely literate. She has borne 4 children but only 2 are alive. She is in her second marriage. Kai woke up in the morning feeling feverish; she initially attributed her con dition to the chilly weather. To keep herself warmer, she drank some akpeteshie (local rum), smeared some menthol ointment on her body and wore her 'sweater' (cardigan). Towards mid-day, however, she developed a high body temperature accompanied by a severe headache, vomiting and catarrh. 'Is it atridti (malaria)? But did I not purge last week?', she debated with herself. So she quickly sent her son to buy 100 cedis worth of 'malaria medicine' from the nearby drugstore. The boy soon returned with 4 chloroquine tablets all of which Kai swallowed at a go. She then closed her bar and retired to bed. The next day, she became oedematose; her face, stomach and limbs were all swollen and she was in intense pains. Again she sent for 2000 cedis worth of malaria medicine. This time, however, the chemical seller gave out a new pre scription after he had interviewed Kai's son. So the boy returned with 4 tablets of malarex, 4 tablets of paracetamol and 2 tablets of multivite; she took 2 each of all these. Soon after this she began to sweat and thought she was getting bet ter. However, towards the evening when she began to feel bad again she sent for dokita, the clinic attendant, who came and administered 2 shots of chloroquine and penicillin injections and gave out tablets of multivite, and B-complex all for a fee of 600 cedis ($2). The third day brought no respite; rather the swelling became worse. And so towards evening, a popular traditional healer was summoned to the house. His diagnosis was that the lady had been struck with tupke6 for refusing to sell her drinks on credit to a particular person. Surgery was scheduled for the morning of the next day. At about 8 am the fourth day, the healer arrived carrying a bag. He, the victim and her relatives retired to an inner room. Outside one could hear the moans and cries of the sick person as the surgery took place. After about two hours they all emerged with the sick person holding a cellophane wrapper containing the 'bullets' allegedly retrieved from her body. These included rusty nails, needles, fish bones, beads, pieces of broken bottles and snail shells. The healer advised Kai to have a ritual bath on the seventh day thence and asked her to buy blood tonic. The healer charged 3500 cedis ($10) for his services. Kai recovered after three weeks and swore to take revenge on her enemy. Case Two Akweley, a 25 year old farmer, trader and Christian, was married and had three children. She was a twin. One evening she complained of a mild headache and a feverish feeling and so before she retired to bed, her husband bought her some chloroquin tablets. Around midnight, however, she began to moan with 139</page><page sequence="12">severe pains in her chest and sides. By the break of day, her whole body - face, limbs and all - had swollen up. Given the rapid turn of events, the village chemist was invited who administered two shots of injections and dispensed some pharmaceuticals. After two days when no change was perceived, it was suggested that Akweley was suffering from suuhela (ailment resulting from sorcery). It was decided that a pastor of the local healing church be summoned at once. When he arrived, he smeared 'holy oil' on the body of Akweley, sprinkled 'holy water' in the room and lit a stick of incense. All these were done amid inaudible incantations often interspersed with J-e-e-e-s-u-s-s-!! At the end of the ritual the pastor proclaimed that he had 'banished the devil and tied it by the blood of Jesus' and that the sick person would recover 'tomorrow'. Indeed, the following day, Akweley appeared to be on the road to recovery as she ate solid food for the first time in several days. However, in the evening her position deteriorated again and once more the pastor was summoned who came to repeat the same rituals. But in the process of this, Akweley lost consciousness and would not speak anymore. Helplessly, the pastor left after having encouraged the family members present to have faith in Jesus. Soon after the pastor's departure, two fetish priestesses were summoned. In their state of possession, they explained that Akweley's susuma had bowed down its head as if in shame and would not speak. Under the circumstances, they proclaimed her spiritually dead; in fact she died a few hours later. In a later development, Akweley's death was attributed to her 'evil' mother who for several years was at loggerheads with her daughter and therefore failed to perform the rituals necessary for the well-being of twins. Case Three During the usual Sunday service at one of the local healing churches, the pastor in a state of trance, rushed through the congregation and with a loud yell of G-a-a-a-briel (Angel Gabriel?), placed his hands on the head of a pale and weak looking sixty year old lady. Then he said: 'Woman, you are sick; your soul has not rested because of the work of evil spirits. Your head and body are filled with water. You are poor because whatever money you acquire, these evil forces blow it away!' 'So what must I do?', asked the frightened old lady. In response the pastor said: 'Every evening light a stick of incense in your room; put a bible under your pillow and before you go to bed, sprinkle holy water in your room. Go to Accra sometime this week, and any first beggar you meet give him or her 100 cedis and one live fowl. I will continue to pray for you till all these wicked forces leave you in peace'. Later on the old lady intimated that she had been sick since the death of her husband some five years thence. She explained that her late husband's brother was the cause because she refused to marry him as custom demanded. She said she had tried all kinds of medical regimes without any success and therefore would give the pastor's prescription a trial. At the time of writing this paper 140</page><page sequence="13">not much progress has been made although the old lady appeared very opti mistic. In the same church that day, an old lady with a huge goitre was declared a witch by the pastor. Although the pastor pressed her to admit the offence she stood her ground and maintained her innocence. At the end of the service some church members argued that she was a witch. Their argument was that those who have a goitre have eaten human flesh, part of which invariably gets stuck in their throat! Case Four Armah, a non-Christian, had a violent dawn quarrel7 with his wife before joining his gang of five for the day's fishing. According to the narration, Armah, who often joined the rowing crew, chose to be the boatswain that day. However, when the day's fishing had been done, on their return journey, another boat collided with Armah's, killing the latter on the spot. He was the only casualty. During his funeral, his otofo (violent ghost) possessed one of his sisters and in trance she revealed that Armah's wife was the cause of their brother's death. The wife was said to have contacted a sorcerer to eliminate Armah because he was about to marry a second wife. After this revelation, pandemonium broke out. Armah's wife was charged upon, beaten up and driven away from the funeral ground. All her possessions were also thrown out of her husband's room amidst threats and curses. A year later, when I saw the lady, she had become insane; Armah was said to have exacted his vengeance. When I suggested that she be sent to the psychiatric hospital in Accra, it was explained that no amount of western medical treatment could cure her; she would regain her mind only after the susuma of Armah had been appeased! Case Five Auntie Ago, a forty year old kenkey seller is in her tenth year of marriage and yet she does not have any child.8 She has been to several healers, pastors and doctors across the length and breadth of Ghana, without scoring any success. However, a year ago when she gave up the hope of ever having a child of her own, she felt a 'child' in her stomach. She strongly believed her luck, not withstanding the fact that she menstruated every month. Recently, when she visited a spiritual healer in Accra, she was informed that witches have turned the baby into a stone and that certain rituals would have to be performed before the 'stone-child' could be removed. She has emphatically refused to go to the hospital because to her the problem is beyond the capability of the hospital; it is highly spiritual in content. My own observation told me that Ago was suffering from fibroid. Case Six One afternoon when I called at the home of one of the village traditional birth attendants (T.B.A.) for an interview, I met him with a very sick 4 year old 141</page><page sequence="14">daughter sitting on his lap. Although the little girl's age was put at 4, she looked so malnourished, emaciated and dimunitive that she could easily be taken for a 2 year old. She could hardly walk, having been sick for quite some time. According to the T.B.A. his daughter had never enjoyed good health since she was born; she had suffered from all kinds of afflictions. This time, however, she was said to be suffering from ntoblo (measles). In response to why the child had not been immunized, the T.B.A. said that since the daughter was always sick and since immunization always makes children sick, he decided not to immunize the child. As regards the child's treatment, the T.B.A. explained that he had admin istered enema of herbal concoction since the child had had no proper bowel movement. And to reduce the high body temperature he often gave her parac etamol syrup and since the measles 'are hidden in the child's stomach', he often administered ampicillin syrup 'to force out the measles'. He explained that the pharmaceuticals were recommended to him by one of the village chemical sellers. When I recommended that the child be sent to the children's hospital in Accra, the T.B.A. responded: 'Teacher (referring to me), I am a T.B.A. and a pastor. If I cure other people's children of their diseases, why can't I cure my own? Besides, if I should take the child to hospital, where is the money to pay? Even if I have the money to take her there are these not the very medicines that will be sold to me at a higher cost?' Two days later when I returned for a follow-up visit, I was informed the child died the day before. The T.B.A./pastor blamed 'people of the air' (witches) for the daughter's death. These cases are by no means exhaustive of evil situations that confront the villagers. In the health centre of the village, people report with all kinds of conditions which they believe must be attacked from a dualistic perspective - secular and spiritual. Thus most often in the health centre, patients expect their medicines to be properly wrapped so as to keep them away from 'evil eyes'. In the same way, people with open sores do all in their power to keep them concealed from these eyes. The health centre attendant, himself a dualist, often advises patients to reinforce their secular treatment with spiritual ones since evil forces are said to be capable of neutralising whatever treatment is given at the centre. Conclusion In describing the social structure of the village and the villagers' perception of evil forces and their manifestations with particular reference to diseases and ill health, I have attempted a caricature of the connecting link between the villagers and the forces over which they have little or no control. In line with the truism that a person's social position determines his level of consciousness, it appears that the villagers' constant struggle with the powers of darkness is meaningful 142</page><page sequence="15">against the backdrop of poverty and physical and mental insecurity in an envi ronment that is pregnant with infectious, environmental and parasitic diseases. Illness, both mental and physical - although based on universal psychobiological factors - is in its expression culturally patterned. The socio-cultural system of which the individual is a member, provides the stress that causes the illness, a theory of disease causation, the basis for mobilization of help for the patient and a cure. In Bortianor, blaming evil forces - in whatever form - for every misfor tune is not only a way of coping with stress and unfulfilled wishes but is also particularly valuable in facilitating a search for the psycho-social and environ mental origins of ill-health and providing the sick with answers to the inevitable questions of 'why me?' and 'why now?' Given the tenuous hold the villagers have over their individual and collective destinies, they will always expect miracles or positive divine intervention in their moments of misfortune. Thus containing the devil or keeping evil forces out of the society necessarily becomes a way of life devoid of a morbid mental state. As is often said, if people perceive situations as real, they are real in their consequences. Notes * This article is derived from data collected from an on-going field-study in pharma ceutical anthropology in a rural community in Ghana. The study is being funded by the Netherlands Foundation for the Advancement of Tropical Research (WOTRO). 1. In the urban areas of Ghana, the weekly newspaper Hope appears to have special ized in feeding the reading public with dramatic scenarios of people's encounters with evil spirits. The 2nd-8th July 1992 issue, for instance, has a front-page story entitled 'The Ordeal at Midnight', in which a young man recounts his midnight en counter with the devil and how he was rescued by Jesus. Besides Hope there is some Christian literature on evil forces; these pamphlets are widely read, especially by the Christian community. Two of such pamphlets are 'Witches' by Akin Omoyajawo and 'Delivered from the Powers of Darkness' by Emmanuel Eni. Both pamphlets focus on how the Christian must fight evil forces. 2. Ghanaians have devised several ways of containing malevolents and these may take many forms. Essentially, however, people may 'bribe' such forces by being over generous with gift-giving so as to make them a less likely target for these forces. Others may also protect themselves with amulets, rings, Christian effigies, or with special medicines rubbed into tiny incisions made on their skin. Yet others may engage in open combat with these forces. In a study on inscriptions on vehicles, Field (1960) and Van der Geest (n.d.) have observed how drivers and/or vehicle owners verbalise their defensive and offensive postures against witchcraft and other evil forces. To Van der Geest, such inscriptions as Wofa pa ye ('It is good to have a good uncle'), 'O' God help me', Aboa a onni dua (4An animal without a tail', which is an ellipsis for 'God cares for the tailless animal' i.e. those without any protection) are examples of a defensive posture. The offensive posture which is said to be more common may be seen in inscriptions such as Abusua, do funu ('The extended family loves corpse' i.e. relatives love you most when you are dead), Suro nea oben wo ('Fear the one very close to you, he may be your greatest enemy'). Indeed, such 143</page><page sequence="16">inscriptions are not restricted to motor vehicles; push-carts, wheel-chairs, bicycles, motorcycles, kiosks and canoes have their share of inscriptions. 3. The Ga are the indigenous inhabitants of Accra, the capital city and its immediate environs. Although the Ga speak the same language, there are subtle divisions among them, such divisions arising from differences in the sources of origin. The Ga territory stretches about 40 kilometers radius of Accra. Within this radius are located several Ga villages including Bortianor, whose inhabitants have kinship ties with sections of Accra. Linguistically and culturally, the Ga are related to the Adangme people in the east. The two ethnic groups constitute about 16% of the entire population of Ghana, making them the third largest ethnic group. 4. Fishing and farming communities in Ghana have special days on which fishing and farming are tabooed. For the fishing community, it is Tuesday; for the farming community it is either Thursday or Friday. These days are days of rest. Essentially, however, they are days set aside for the gods of the sea and of the land to engage in their respective activities. Thus, those who contravene this taboo are said to encounter all kinds of strange entities in the forest or at sea. After such encounters the transgressor (sometimes with his entire family) is said to suffer a series of mis fortunes including mysterious deaths. Bortianor, being both a fishing and farming community, observes Tuesday and Thursday as days of rest. Such days are thus used for celebrating social events such as births, marriages and funerals. 5. In all the ethnic groups in Ghana, whenever a woman experiences repeated still births or infant mortality, it is believed that a malevolent spirit-child is the cause of the misfortune. Among the traditionally-inclined, the corpse of such 'malevolent' children are often marked so that on their 'return' they would be identified. Iden tification can take many forms - cutting off a piece of the ear lobe, or the finger. The body may also be marked indelibly. When a Ga mother whose babies have died repeatedly gives birth to children who survive the seventh day, they are given special facial marks. In addition, they are given names quite uncharacteristic of the Ga. I know two of such persons in my area; one is called Ekwan da ho ('The exit is there, you may go (die) if you so wish') and the other is called Etonsoo ('My birth-canal is tired'). Such facial marks and strange names are purported to divert the attention of death from such children so that they can live to adulthood. When such children die young, they are hardly mourned; in a way it is expected that as 'sojourners' they would soon depart. The Ga refer to such children as gbobaloi (singular: gbolalo). 6. The Ga, like other ethnic groups in Ghana, believe that some people are capable of magically shooting foreign objects into the bodies of their enemies. Such objects are usually small and sharp. These include needles, pins, pieces of broken bottles, fish bones, beads, etc. There are healers with specialised skills for the removal of such objects. Among the Ga, such a phenomenon is known as tukpe. In Bortianor, tukpe is so frequent that for most people modesty is an important conduct-norm. 7. Dawn is a very special time in the life of a Ghanaian. For instance, at dawn chil dren are out-doored, quarrels are settled and parents admonish their wayward adult siblings. Indeed, it is said to be a time when the spirits are most active. Thus, what befalls a person at dawn is very crucial to determining his fate, subsequently. Hence at dawn quarrel portends a bad omen for those involved and is avoided as much as possible. 8. In Ghana, children are the bed-rock of every marriage. Children confer high status on parents. Besides, they are the medium through whom the dead ancestors are said to return to join the living. Childlessness is therefore considered to be one of the greatest tragedies that can befall the Ghanaian of child-bearing age. A childless 144</page><page sequence="17">marriage is enough ground for divorce. Thus a childless person, especially a woman, is looked upon not only with pity but also with malicious pity. In a way, he or she is said to be paying for his or her past misdeeds. Given this situation, every adult Ghanaian would want to beget at least one child within or outside marriage, but most preferably within the norms of marriage.
