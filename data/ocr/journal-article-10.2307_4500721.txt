Starting with an excellent introduction that provides the work much of its historical and analytical coherence, the collection of essays on anthropomorphism draws on a number of approaches - including history, literary studies, phil- osophy of science and media theory - to probe the manifold practices of projecting the human onto the animal. Taking in topics ranging from pet-keeping to conservation to the uses of animals in physiological research and advertising campaigns, the volume reaches well beyond the dilemma of whether such projections are scientifically or culturally defensible, aiming instead to shed light on what it is about humans and animals that makes the latter such constant mental company for the former. The book's four sections consider human-animal matters in, respectively, other times and places, evolutionary biology, film and daily life. Of particular note in the first section is co-editor Lorraine Daston's essay on medieval angelology and post-Darwinian comparative psychology, which reminds us that 'anthropomorphism was a theological sin long before it became a scientific one' (p. 39). Daston argues that in the latter half of the nineteenth century a new type of</page><page sequence="2">278 Book reviews anthropomorphism emerged by which researchers sought to understand animals not merely by analogy to humans, but by empathetically imagining the 'subjective experience of individuals' (p. 51). The same section also includes an essay by Paul White which, with its focus on Victorian laboratory animals, complements now classic cultural histories of animals in the British context by Keith Thomas and Harriet Ritvo, as well as earlier studies of vivisection by Richard French and James Turner. Wendy Doniger provides us with a longer and non-Western view by uncovering assumptions about gender and sexuality in the richly anthropomorphic and zo- omorphic content of ancient Sanskrit myths. She argues that projections between animals and humans in either direction aim 'to reduce the otherness between humans and animals' (p. 34). Here and elsewhere in the volume are inserted normative pronouncements about the ethical treatment of animals. While laudable in themselves, these sentiments are of course deeply anthropomorphic, and so can feel somewhat extraneous to much of the hard scholarly work the essays perform. At the very least, these ethical calls to arms need to become objects of further study and discussion. Contributions by philosophers of science Sandra Mitchell and Elliott Sober comprise the se- cond section, on evolutionary biology. Mitchell's piece examines recent experimental evidence (based largely on chimpanzee studies) and argues that anthropomorphic models of animal be- haviour 'must be substantiated by evidence that there are similar causal mechanisms responsible for generating the apparently similar behaviors that are observed' in animals and humans (p. 114). In his essay, Sober points to an asymmetry in comparative psychology's proscriptions against errors of anthropomorphism (overdoing it in ascribing human mental traits to animals) but not against those of 'anthropodenial' (overdoing it in failing to ascribe such traits to animals where appropriate). Drawing on an analysis of reasoning about similarity in cladistics, Sober argues that neither anthropomorphism nor anthropodenial is justifiable on evolutionary grounds. He concludes that there is no need in any case for a blanket methodological commandment and urges instead that 'the only prophylactic we need is empiricism' (p. 97). The essays of the third section turn to contemporary relations with animals. James Serpell's essay on pet-keeping examines the (often detrimental) roles animals are pressed into in the domestic context, as breeders select for ever more extreme morphologies in an effort to meet human social, emotional and aesthetic demands. Of all the volume's contributors, Serpell comes closest to a condemnation of anthropomorphic practice, placing pet-keeping on par with 'other ways of using animals for human ends, including farming and biomedical research' (p. 132). In the same section, Cheryce Kramer offers a fascinating account of how photographer Tim Flach's meticulously crafted photographs of animals are contributing to an ever more unified global visual landscape that is largely controlled by a few centralized image banks. 'Striking images of animals', the editors point out in their introduction, 'are in great demand by global advertisers because - in contrast to equally striking images of humans - age, race, class, and culture do not interfere with identification and the desire to acquire' (p. 6). Kramer's and Serpell's analyses look beyond the slaughterhouse-to-dinner-table narrative to reveal important alternative patterns of human consumption of animals. The film-oriented final section offers contributions by documentary filmmaker Sarita Siegel and co-editor Gregg Mitman. Like Kramer and to some extent Serpell, these authors focus on the visual aspects of anthropomorphism. Mitman shows how ethologists concerned with East Afri- ca's dwindling African elephant populations 'calibrated' their methods 'closely with the aes- thetics and conventions of fashion photography, television, and film' (p. 193). Here we learn how powerful visual material combined with longitudinal studies of individual animals to deliver what bare statistics had failed to deliver - the emotional connection to the animals that enabled them to be deemed worthy of protection. In what she describes as a 'close-up, personal look into the worlds of orangutans and natural-history filmmaking' (p. 197), Siegel also emphasizes the large</page><page sequence="3">Book reviews 279 potential impact of visual images that enlist the empathic faculties of audiences. She reflects on her own deliberate uses of 'anthropo{morphism ... as a tool of communication and comparison', while avoiding the making of 'explicit claims of dangerous and incorrect implications that the orangutan subjects are "just like us "' (p. 197). No single coherent voice on the nature of anthropomorphism emerges from this volume. But this absence is deliberate. Indeed, it is precisely as appreciations of the highly local and specific nature of anthropomorphic practice that each of these essays effectively contributes to the whole, whetting appetites for even more diversity in perspectives (in the form, perhaps, of more cross- cultural studies of anthropomorphism). Scholars interested in the animal-human boundary will find here much to satisfy their interests, and instructors of undergraduate and graduate courses should welcome these succinct, high-quality essays into their syllabi.
