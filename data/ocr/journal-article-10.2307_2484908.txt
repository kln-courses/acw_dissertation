Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission Scientific and Tech- nical Series Number 1. 1980. $4.50 (Paper- back). This is the first book to be published on the pteridophytes of Kentucky since William- son's in 1878. As is presently known, there are 69 species plus 10 hybrids of ferns (57 species and 7 hybrids) and fern allies (12 277 1981]</page><page sequence="2">278 BULLETIN OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL CLUB [VOL. 108 species and 3 hybrids) in Kentucky. A total of 29 genera and 17 families are repre- sented-25 genera and 14 families of ferns and three families and four genera of fern allies. By far the largest family, in terms of number of species, is the Aspleniaceae with 7 genera, 23 species and 6 hybrids. The other 16 families are represented by three species or less, and 11 of them by only one species. The author states that, "Extant stations for all species were located except for Adiantum capillus-veneris and Dryop- teris ludoviciana." After the book went to print, I was on a field trip with Mr. Cranfill when he found several small colonies of Adiantum capillus-veneris. Only taxa for which there are herbarium specimens are included in the treatment. Several species previously reported for the state, but for which the author could not locate speci- mens, are not included. The body of the text is divided into three sections. The first consists of an introduc- tion (which is really a preface), a summary of the history of fern collecting in Ken- tucky, and a very general discussion of the distribution and ecology of ferns in rela- tion to the physiography, vegetation, and climate of Kentucky. The latter "chapter" of this section includes a physiographic map of Kentucky and six black and white photographs purportedly illustrating the vegetation and topography of five of the state's eight physiographic regions. The photographs of the Inner Blue Grass and the Mississippian Plateau are unfortunately not well chosen and do not represent the general vegetative cover and topography of these regions. The author states that, "Each region has a characteristic geological setting, climate and thus a characteristic vegetation." How- ever, there is slight macroclimatic variation in Kentucky (see, for example, Thornthwaite 1931 and Sawyer and Lindsey 1963) and only two climax vegetative associations are generally recognized in Kentucky-the Mixed Mesophytic Forest in the Cumber- land and Allegheny Plateaus and the West- ern Mesophytic Forest covering the rest of the state (Braun 1950). It would thus seem that geological and topographic (via micro- climate) factors have been the major causes of any differences that may be observed in the vegetation of Kentucky. The last chapter of the first section re- views the life cycle of a "typical" (homo- sporous) fern as is diagramed in most gen- eral botany textbooks. A clear, concise discussion of heterospory and apogamy is also included. The second section of the book includes a discussion of identification of ferns, abbre- viations of words frequently used by plant taxonomists, and a summary of the genera and species of pteridophytes in Kentucky. It also includes keys to and descriptions of the families, genera and species of Kentucky pteridophytes. Keys to the genera using both sterile and fertile specimens are pro- vided, with keys to species under the appro- priate genera. Habit sketches, as well as en- larged drawings of certain parts of the plant (e.g., microphylls, sporophylls and spores in the fern allies and pinnae and sporangia in the ferns), are given for each fern and fern ally. A discussion of the stem anatomy, evolutionary relationships, and pertinent taxonomic literature is included under the family. Ecological and geographical notes and chromosome number (where known) are given for each species. The third section of the book includes a separate dot distribution map for each of the 69 species and 10 hybrids that make up the Kentucky fern flora, based on specimens in 15 herbaria and on literature citations. Three maps are included on a page, reduc- ing names of the counties to illegibility. However, a larger, legible county base map is provided for reference at the beginning of the section. The symbols for specimens cited from the literature and those in the University of Kentucky Herbarium are inter- changed; i.e., should be a closed circle for the UK Herbarium and closed triangle for literature citations. In the last paragraph of the introduction Mr. Cranfill indicates that, "not only can considerable progress be made by filling the maps of taxa already known from Kentucky, but the potential for discovery of additional taxa is still great." It appears from the dis- tribution maps that fern collecting in Ken- tucky has been more concentrated in and near such popular places as the Red River</page><page sequence="3">1981] TORREYA 279 Gorge, the Inner Blue Grass, Mammoth Cave National Park and the Cumberland Mountains, than elsewhere, almost to the exclusion of such areas as the counties of Bracken and Mason along the Ohio River. Following the section on distribution maps there is a very useful glossary, includ- ing 218 literature citations and an index to common and Latin names of Kentucky ferns. Two aspects of the writing style detract from the overall quality of this manual. Firstly, anthropomorphic statements are scattered throughout the textual material. Secondly, the author has the habit of using scientific slang. I found very few typograph- ical errors and mispellings. The book is printed by photo offset copying and is care- fully sewn and bound in a paper cover. It should hold up well with use in the field. The criticisms expressed above do not seriously detract from the usefulness of Ferns and Fern Allies of Kentucky as a manual of Kentucky's pteridophytes. The Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission, under the direction of Donald F. Harker, Jr., should be commended for publishing this flora. It is their first publication in what is proposed to be a series of scientific and technical papers, and, one hopes, more volumes dealing with the natural history of Kentucky will soon follow. The botanists at the Commission are making a substantial contribution to furthering our knowledge of the Kentucky flora.-JERRY M.
