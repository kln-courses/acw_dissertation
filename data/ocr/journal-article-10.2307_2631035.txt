BECKMANN? A theoretical model which estimates the probability of injury to occupants of vehicles in two-car collisions is presented and evaluated. This model is based on considerations of principles from mechanics and observations from biomechanics. It is evaluated using two-car accident injury data. The validity of the model structure is supported because the differences between estimated numbers of injuries and observed numbers of injuries in two-car accidents were statistically insignificant. In contrast, the predictive accuracy was found to be unacceptable for three regression models from the published literature which were arbitrarily specified. The parame- ter estimates developed for the model provide a basis for tentatively evaluating the effect of vehicle size on the probability of injury to drivers of cars in two-car collisions. (TRANSPORTATION/ROAD) 1. Introduction 1.1. Object Automobile occupant safety may be affected by reductions in sizes of future cars. A great deal of research has been done to identify factors which give rise to occupant injuries in automobile accidents. The objective of this research is to identify the role of vehicle size in determining the probability of occupant injury in two-vehicle collisions. 1.2. Background The literature on automobile accident injuries falls into three categories: analysis of field accident data, analysis of the mechanics of collisions and biomedical studies of injury tolerance.' The literature encompassing these subjects is immense. The object here is not to enumerate or summarize it, but to briefly provide background for the work to be presented in this report. Analyses of field accident injury data are primarily concerned with fitting arbitrary relationships between the occurrence of automobile occupant injuries and a number of observable characteristics of automobile accidents. For example, studies have reported the use of regression techniques to relate the probability of injury for vehicle occupants to vehicle weight [1], [2], closing speed [3] and driver age [4], [5]. Since empirical portions of those studies were based on accident data not segmented by vehicle model years, improvements in vehicle safety designs in newer vehicle models were not considered. In several cases, fitted regression is used to project the number of deaths and injuries when the number of small cars increases [1], [3], [5], [6]. Since the independent variables in these regression equations are usually specified arbitrarily, the validity of these projected numbers of injuries is questionable. Furthermore, these studies do not directly address the question of prediction accuracy, which involves *Accepted by Ambar G. Rao; received September 30, 1981.

S. KRISHNAN, J. V. CARNAHAN AND M. J. BECKMANN comparisons of predicted and actual numbers of injuries. Instead of presenting such comparisons, ranges of predictions corresponding to several possible future scenarios are usually provided. Analyses of the mechanics of collisions are focused on the physics of automobile collisions. These analyses range from basic momentum-energy considerations [7] to inclusion of certain structural characteristics [8]-[10] to computer simulation which reflects a great deal of structural detail [11], [12]. Often, the object of an engineering analysis is to characterize the motion of the occupant compartment of an automobile in a collision. This characterization may take the form of determining the acceleration pulse or the change in velocity of the vehicle center of mass or, possibly, the amount of deformation that occurred. The study of occupant motion and its potential for injury is generally in the realm of biomedical science. Since in biomechanical experiments humans are not deliberately subjected to motions which are likely to cause injury, a great deal of effort is expended upon the development, assessment and use of human surrogates. Anthropomorphic dummies are an important tool since they permit mea- surement of simulated occupant response to automobile crash conditions. An impor- tant area of research involves an effort to make dummies as human-like in their dynamic properties as possible [13]. Cadavers, both embalmed and unembalmed, are also used in occupant response experiments and are compared to dummies and humans, to the extent possible [14]-[17]. Biomechanical properties of the human body are studied [18], [19] so as to provide data required for dummy design and mathemati- cal modeling and simulation [20]. Animals are also used as human surrogates in studying physiological response to impact and acceleration [21]-[23]. Probabilistic aspects of injury potential are addressed in several studies [21], [24]. Such biomedical research has formed the basis for the occupant crash protection standards set forth in MVSS 208 and will likely influence the nature of future standards [25]. 2. Approach Field accident data can be subjected to rigorous statistical analysis to identify variables which are related to the occurrence of occupant injuries in actual automobile accidents [26]. Depending on the sampling scheme by which specific accidents are chosen for analysis, various subsets of real world experience are represented in terms of extent of occupant injury and crash configuration and severity. A difficulty in using such data lies in quantifying levels of occupant injury and recovering measures of crash severity from an accident report or description. The challenge lies in developing a model to predict the occurrence of occupant injury from some measure of crash severity. The modeling approach taken here follows the bioassay approach to biological experiments [27], [28] and is based on two concepts: crash severity and critical tolerance level. Crash severity denotes the nature of the acceleration experienced by an automobile occupant in an accident. In specific accident situations, crash severity is influenced by many factors such as the direction of impact force, impact speed, crush characteristics of the impact area, etc. For example, in a head-on collision between a small and a large car, the crash severity would, in general, be higher for the small car occupants than for the large car occupants. Ideally, crash severity should be specified to show difference in vehicle designs. However, data on such differences are lacking in field accident data. Since the empirical portion of the research reported herein is based on field accident data, effects of vehicle design changes are not explicitly taken into account. It is recognized that the use of vehicle mass to describe a vehicle's characteris- tics, as done in this research, does not capture differences in vehicle crush characteris- tics within the same vehicle weight class. An individual occupant's critical tolerance</page><page sequence="3">INJURY THRESHOLD MODEL FOR TWO-CAR COLLISIONS 911 level denotes the occupant's maximum ability to tolerate crash severity without incurring an injury of some specified level of severity. Such critical tolerance levels are distributed over the population. For example, the force required to fracture a bone varies among individuals, depending on their age and their bone size [29]. The basic idea behind the injury model presented here is straightforward: when the crash severity exceeds the occupant's critical tolerance level, an injury occurs. In a series of biological experiments with laboratory animals as subjects, Clark [30], Hemmingsen [31] and Bliss [32] observed that the subjects were immune to small doses of poison. However, as larger doses of poison were administered, they observed that increased number of the subjects were killed. From their experimental results, they hypothesized that subjects had thresholds which were their maximum tolerance to the intake of poison; these thresholds were random variables which were normally distributed. They also hypothesized that the response (i.e. death) was manifest when the logarithm of the stimulus (i.e., amount of poison administered) exceeded the threshold. Since a few subjects with extremely high thresholds can produce an extended "tail" on the distribution of thresholds, the logarithmic transformation is commonly used to reduce the skewness in this distribution [28]. If P is the probability of response, Y the threshold, and X the logarithm of the stimulus, then P =Prob(Y &lt; X) (1) = fz 1 exp(-y2/2) dy where z = (X - u)/a (2) -00 ;2-, where u and a are the mean and standard deviation of the threshold distribution. This formulation is called the probit model. Reviewing the results of Bliss and others, Finney [28] concluded that the probit model predicted response fairly accurately, especially when the logarithm of the stimulus was used. Finney also compared the probit model with other models using different threshold distributions and concluded that the predicted responses were not sensitive to similar classes of distributions. One such distribution which leads to mathematically simple calculations is the logistic distribution: P = {1I + exp[-(X- y)o}i(3) This is called the logit model and is used in this research. There are a number of considerations which indicate that a logit (or probit) approach to the analysis of injuries in automobile accidents would be fruitful. The general sigmoid shape of the cumulative distribution of tolerance (2) and (3) is eminently reasonable. For accidents of low severity, very few people are injured; then, as accidents become more severe, many more individuals are likely to succumb; finally, all individuals are likely to be injured in very severe accidents. Empirical evidence in support of this sigmoid shape has been given by Langweider [33] and Hartemann et al. [34] based on automobile accidents in Europe. Snyder [29] reports unpublished probit analysis of the impact tolerance of the human tibia. Ommaya et al. present a sigmoid curve for the probability of concussion in squirrel monkeys versus angular acceleration of the head [35]. Versace has suggested a logistic approach to expressing a tolerance limit for acceleration [36]. Lowne and Wall used probit analysis to estimate human tolerance to shoulder and lap belt tension [37]. 3. Injury Threshold Model In this section an injury threshold model for two-car collisions is presented and aspects of crash severity which are related to vehicle size are made explicit. A</page><page sequence="4">912 K. S. KRISHNAN, J. V. CARNAHAN AND M. J. BECKMANN particularly lucid exposition of the basic principles of the mechanics involved in two-car collisions is given by Marquardt [7] and is abstracted next. Suppose that two vehicles traveling with known velocities collide with each other. As a result of the collision, vehicles undergo changes in velocity, reach a common velocity, and finally separate with new velocities, eventually coming to rest due to friction. Energy is absorbed by the deformation of the bodies of the two vehicles; a small part of the energy so absorbed produces rebound which causes the vehicles to separate. During the period of deformation, rebound and subsequent motion, each occupant's velocity must change from its initial value before collision to the new velocity of the occupant compartment. This change in occupant velocity is caused by contact either with the vehicle interior or with a restraint system. The occurrence and nature of the injury sustained depends on the acceleration time history, the effective- ness of the restraint system (if used), the characteristics of the vehicle interior and other factors such as the occupant's ability to tolerate the forces which cause his motion relative to the occupant compartment. The Injury Threshold Model (ITM) proposed here is based on three postulates. One postulate concerns the measurement of crash severity; the other two postulates concern the occurrence of an injury. Postulate 1. The measure of crash severity (CS) depends upon the forces acting on the occupant during a collision. Postulate 2. If the measure of crash severity exceeds the critical level of tolerance (CL) for the occupant, an injury occurs. Postulate 3. The critical level of tolerance for an occupant is a random variable with a known probability distribution. It is assumed that the crush characteristics for a given pair of vehicles involved in a two vehicle collision are fixed. It is possible that as vehicle design changes, crush characteristics also change. Consequently, in certain vehicle accidents, changes in vehicle design could alter an occupant's relative motion due to impact. Information on the effects of vehicle design on occupant kinematics is currently available for only specific types of vehicle accidents under experimental conditions. Such experimental data are not directly relevant to the estimation of future fatalities under all types of vehicle accidents likely to occur in the future. The first postulate seems acceptable based on an inspection of the mechanics involved in collisions. The second and third postulates parallel the bioassay approach to the analysis of biological experiments involving toxins and laboratory animals. In addition, this approach has already found some limited uses in the analysis of injury data from experiments and accidents, as pointed out in the previous section. Since the acceleration of the occupant is the net force on the occupant per unit mass, the change in velocity, LAv (the integral of the acceleration pulse during the crushing phase of the accident2), is a measure of crash severity [38]. The quantity LAv is a vector whose direction is the same as the resultant force causing vehicle deformation. Here, only the magnitude of Avv will be used to measure crash severity; a more refined injury model could employ directional information from accident injury data records and the duration as well as the peak value of acceleration pulse. Other factors which influence the nature of the motion of an occupant are the use of a restraint system, the occupant seating position, the vehicle design and interior passenger room. From Postulate 1, the crash severity would be a function of Av, restraint usage and other influences which depend on the vehicle type or size. In the analyses to follow the 2The crushing phase of an accident is the period during which the vehicles are first brought from their original velocity to the common velocity.</page><page sequence="5">INJURY THRESHOLD MODEL FOR TWO-CAR COLLISIONS 913 occupant is restricted to be the driver, so seating position is held constant. If injuries to nondriver occupants are modeled, seating position can be accounted for in a way similar to restraint use. Let Ri denote the use of a restraint system in vehicle i and mi the mass of vehicle i (i = 1, 2). Ri is a dichotomous variable, taking on the value 0 or 1 depending upon whether the occupant of vehicle i uses a restraint system or not. From Postulate 1, the crash severity, CLi, for the occupant of vehicle i is a function of lAvi, mi and R: CSi = H(Avi^, mRi ) (4) where H( ) is a known mathematical function. Let Ii denote a dichotomous variable taking on the value 1 or 0 when the occupant of car i experiences a specified level of injury or not. From Postulate 2, letting CL denote the random variable representing the critical level of tolerance, Ii = 1, CSi &gt; CL, (5) = 0, otherwise. Since CL is a random variable (Postulate 3), the probability, P, of an injury to the occupant of vehicle i can be obtained from (5),- provided the probability distribution of CL is known. As suggested in the previous section, there are theoretical grounds and empirical evidence suggesting that the (cummulative) distribution function for CL can be logistic. That is, Prob(CL &lt; x) = [1+ exp(-x)]'. (6) From (5) and (6), the probability of injury to the occupant of vehicle i, P, is given by P = [ I + exp( - CSi) ] 1. (7) Note that CSi is an index of crash severity. Equation (7) states that when CSi has a large negative value, the probability of injury, P, is close to zero; when CSi has a large positive value, P is close to one; when CSi is zero, P is 0.5. Equation (7) can be rewritten as ln(1 /P - 1) =-CSi (8) where CSi is given by (4). In order to simplify the estimation problem, the function H( ) is taken to be of such a form that it is linear in the parameters to be estimated. For reasons mentioned earlier, the log transformation is used for each component of crash severity. The joint influence of the individual components is considered to be the sum of individual influences. This leads to the following expression for crash severity for the occupant of car 1 -CS, = a + b1lnml - b2ln(Avl)- b3R, + e, (9) where a, b1, b2 and b3 are unknown parameters to be estimated from accident injury data and e is an error term. From momentum considerations, Av1 can be expressed in terms of the closing speed (the magnitude of the vector difference in the impact velocities) and the vehicular mass ratio [7], IVI - V21 (10) wLVer + mp /m2 (10)</page><page sequence="6">914 K. S. KRISHNAN, J. V. CARNAHAN AND M. J. BECKMANN and IvI - v21 is the closing speed. From (8), (9) and (10), we get ln(l/P- 1) = a + bllnmr + b2[ln(1 + MI/M2)- lnlvl - v21] - b3R, + e. (11) Equation (11) is an injury threshold model specification for occupants in two-car collisions. However, when some variables specified in the equation are lacking from the accident data that is to be used to estimate parameters, the equation must be modified. The modifications that arise because of the limitations of police accident data from New York and North Carolina are discussed next. Closing speed is generally lacking from accident data, unless the data are collected by special teams of skilled accident investigators. If the closing speed is unknown, then - b2lnlvl - v21 is included in the error term and (11) becomes ln(l/P - 1) = a + bllnml + b2ln(l + mI/M2) -b3R, + e. (12) The difficulty with this specification is that parameter estimation may reflect the correlations of the remaining variables with IvI - v21. For example, if restraint system use is associated with cautious drivers who tend to be involved in accidents with lower closing speeds, the coefficient of RI will reflect the influence of both restraint use and closing speed. To pursue this point, consider the case where occupant restraint use in the "other" car, R2, is available from accident data. The probability of injury for the driver of car 1 seems unlikely to be related to the use of restraint system by the driver of car 2. Nevertheless, suppose the model is specified as ln(l/P - 1) = a + bllnml + b2ln(1 + m1/m2) -b3R1 + b4R2 + e (13) which contains terms representing the influence of restraint use in both cars on the probability of injury in car 1. It might be expected that estimation of parameters from accident injury data would result in b4 not being statistically significantly different from zero. However, as mentioned above, if restraint use is related to cautious driving and lower impact speeds, b4 could evidence correlation of R2 with Iv2 - vll. 4. Validation Method The ITM will be tested on the basis of five criteria: (i) Adequacy of the fit of the model to data; (ii) Algebraic signs of parameter estimates; (iii) Stability of parameter estimates; (iv) Predictive accuracy; (v) Overall adequacy. The descriptive measure used here to indicate how well a model fits a given data set is the multiple correlation coefficient, R2. The multiple correlation coefficient mea- sures the percentage of total variation in the dependent variable accounted for by the independent variables. R2 can vary from 0 to 1, and the higher the R 2, the better the fit. The estimates of the model parameters should have the correct algebraic signs to predict certain changes in injury probability realistically. Specifically, the model should predict a decrease in injury probability under any of the following conditions: -increase in the mass of car 1, -decrease in occupant deceleration, * increase in seat belt usage. These conditions require that the estimates of b,, b2 and b3 be nonnegative. The stability of the parameter estimates is analyzed by the addition and deletion of variables in the regression equation. This criterion is of particular interest in this</page><page sequence="7">INJURY THRESHOLD MODEL FOR TWO-CAR COLLISIONS 915 research since the lack of data requires that the effect of closing speed be absorbed in the error term in (12). Since restraint use could be correlated with impact speed,3 as conjectured earlier, it was used as a proxy variable to analyze the parameter estimates. Predictive accuracy refers to the magnitude of error in predictions. To test for predictive accuracy, two sets of data are required-one set for estimating parameters and the other for testing the predictions. A measure of accuracy in predictions is given by x2 which is defined as 2 (Predicted numbers of injuries - Observed numbers of injuries)2 Predicted numbers of injuries where the summation extends over all pairs of vehicle masses. Smaller values of x2 indicate better predictions. If the observed number of injuries are independent normal variates, then x2, given by (14), would be distributed as a chi-square random variable. The statistical significance of the calculated value of x2 will be decided from the chi-square distribution. Obviously, the two sets of data used for estimation and prediction must be comparable in order to assess the predictive accuracy of the model. If (12) is being used because the accident injury data do not provide closing speed, some attempt must be made to ensure that the distribution of closing speeds is the same for the two data sets. For example, one would not estimate parameters using accident injury data from a state characterized by a great deal of urban travel and predict numbers of injuries to be compared with accident injury data from a rural region. Finally, overall adequacy is tested by comparing (on the basis of criteria (i)-(iv)) the ITM with alternative injury models which violate some of the three postulates underlying ITM. In this research three alternative models of injury will be considered. The first model violates Postulate 1 by specifying arbitrarily that the crash severity is a function of vehicle masses and restraint use without regard for the effect of the mass ratio on the change in velocity. This model is entertained in order to determine the importance of the specification of crash severity. Alternative Models II and III violate all the three postulates by arbitrarily specifying that the proportions of occupants injured are functions of vehicle masses and restraint use in the form of power functions without any consideration for the bioassay approach to tolerance. Model II is similar to the injury model proposed by Preston [4] and Model III is the injury model proposed by Mela [1]. The three alternative models of injury probability can be written in additive forms as follows: Alternative Model I: ln(1/P -1) = a + bllnml - b2lnm2- b3R, + b4R2 + e; (15) Alternative Model II: lnP = a-bllnml + b2lnm2 +b3R1 + b4R2+ e; (16) Alternative Model III: lnP = a - bl(m1/1000) + b2(m2/1000) + b3R, + b4R2+ e.

In these states driver injuries are classified into five distinct classes according to a classification The authors are grateful to one of the referees who pointed out that such a correlation was observed in an empirical evaluation of seat belt effectiveness [42].</page><page sequence="8">916 K. S. KRISHNAN, J. V. CARNAHAN AND M. J. BECKMANN method from the National Safety Council [4]: 1. No injury. 2. "C" injury: nonvisible injury-a complaint of pain without visible signs of injury, or momentary unconsciousness. 3. "B" injury: minor visible injury-an abrasion, bruise, swelling, limping or obviously painful movement. 4. "A" injury: serious visible injury-a bleeding wound, distorted member, or any condition that requires the victim to be carried away from the scene of the accident. 5. "K" injury: fatal injury-an injury that results in death within 12 months of the accident. It should be noted that the above scale should be taken as only a rough measure of injury severity. For example, both data sources may contain some cases in which a driver is reported as having an "A" injury and dies later, but the coding is not changed. Since fatal and serious injuries are combined into one class in this report, errors of misclassification are likely to be small.4 The New York State Department of Motor Vehicles made a study of two-car collisions under contract to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The report describing the study [39] contains numerous tables of accident and injury data derived from the 1971 and 1972 Vehicle Safety Design Surveillance System data bank. The data are partitioned by such variables as seat belt use, vehicle weight, model year, driver age and area of impact. Numbers of accident and numbers of injuries are tabulated. Injuries are grouped into two classes: any injury (K + A + B + C) and fatal and serious injuries (A + K). Injury probabilities (percent of accidents in which injuries occur) are estimated by dividing the numbers of injuries by the numbers of accidents for each pair of vehicle masses and seat belt usages. Accident injury data for head-on collisions in North Carolina are given by O'Neill, Joksch and Haddon [2]; the original report issued by Campbell and Reinfurt [40] from the University of North Carolina provided smoothed data, so we did not use it in this study. The data pertain to all police-reported accidents that occurred in North Carolina in 1966 and 1968-71. Nearly all police agencies in North Carolina use the standard accident reporting form specified by the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles. Unfortunately, data have only been published for unbelted drivers, limiting their usefulness for this study. One of the vehicles in the collision was classified as a struck car and the other as the striking car. For a head-on collision it does not matter which is which, from the point of view of the mechanics involved. However the number of injuries in striking and struck cars provide the two compara- ble data sets required for estimation and prediction described in the validation approach section. 6. Analysis and Validation In this section, two sets of parameter estimates are presented; one set is based on North Carolina data and the other set based on New York data. The parameter estimates will be used along with the five criteria mentioned in the previous section to evaluate the injury threshold model.5 Neither data set provides closing speeds for vehicles involved in accidents; therefore, (12) and (13) are used in the data analysis. Stepwise regression is the technique used to obtain the parameter estimates. The results are presented, to the extent possible, in the order of the five criteria described in the validation approach section. 4The authors are grateful to the referee who provided us with details on errors in police coded injury information. sUls otherwise specified, all parameter estimates reported herein are statistically significant at 1% level.</page><page sequence="9">INJURY THRESHOLD MODEL FOR TWO-CAR COLLISIONS 917 TABLE 1 Estimated Coefficients of Injury Threshold Model Using North Carolina Data ln(l/P - 1) = a' + bllnml + b2ln(1 + ml/m2) + e a' - 6.89 b, 1.16 b2 0.23 R 2 0.61 6.1. North Carolina Data Analysis The North Carolina data contain only information on unbelted drivers, so (12) is used to estimate parameters. Since R1 is always one, the constant term is actually a - b3, which will be renamed a': ln(l/P- 1) = a' + bllnml + b2ln(1 Ml/M2)+ e. (18) Table 1 shows the estimates of a', b, and b2 in (18), and the value of R 2. Since R2 is 0.61, which is relatively high, we conclude that the ITM given by (18) fits North Carolina data well. The estimates of b1 and b2 satisfy the required nonnegativity condition. Table 2 shows similar estimates for the three alternative models of injury described in the validation section; the parameter estimates are obtained using the same North Carolina data. All three alternative models yield high values of R2 (approximately 0.60). The algebraic signs of the parameter estimates for alternative Models II and III satisfy the nonnegativity condition, although the estimates of b2 are not significantly different from zero. For alternative Model I, the estimate of b2 is negative, but again it is statistically insignificant at the 5% level. The parameter estimates for b2 for the alternative models suggest that the weight of car 2 in a two-car collision is not significantly related to injury probability in car 1. We find this result counterintuitive. Since the North Carolina data were limited to unbelted drivers, the assessment of the ITM with respect to criterion (iii) cannot be performed. This will be done in the next section using New York State data, which have belt use information. On the other hand, the North Carolina data are structured in such a way that they can be used to assess the predictive accuracy (criterion (iv)) of ITM. As mentioned earlier, the determination of predictive accuracy requires two sets of comparable accident injury data: one set to be used for estimating the parameters in the model and the other set for comparing model predictions with observed numbers of injuries.

The percent of accidents in which injuries befall striking and struck drivers can be calculated using the number of collisions involving pairs of cars of various weights. The parameters are estimated using only the calculated percentages for struck vehicles. Using these parameter estimates, numbers of injuries are then predicted for the striking vehicles. These predicted numbers are compared with observed numbers of injuries in striking vehicles to measure the predictive accuracy of ITM and the three alternative models. These injury data from head-on collisions in North Carolina are ideally suited for studying predictive accuracy since the impact forces experienced by occupants of both striking and struck vehicles can be modeled using (18), so prediction error is ascribed solely to the model. As explained in ?4, the predictive accuracy is measured in terms of a x2 value.

From Table 3 and Figures 1, 2 and 3, it appears that the predicted numbers of injuries using ITM are closer to the actual reported numbers of injuries than are the FIGURE 1.

This assessment is borne out by the x2 values at -the bottom of Table 3. Since the x2 value for the injury threshold model is statistically insignificant at the 5% level, it can be concluded that the model predictions are good. By contrast, the x2 values corresponding to the alternative models are well above the critical value leading one to conclude that their predictive capability is poor. Overall, ITM appears to be on a par with the three alternative models with respect to R2 and somewhat better with respect to the nonnegativity of the parameter estimates. In terms of predictive accuracy, it certainly has to be judged superior to the alternative models. This comparison is summarized in Table 4. 6.2. New York Data Analysis The parameters in (13) are estimated using New York accident injury data for two-car collisions. Two injury classifications were used: (a) fatal or serious injury (K + A) and (b) any injury (K + A + B + C).

The higher value of R 2 for fatal or serious injury suggests a better fit for more serious injury types. All parameters estimated from fatal or serious injury data were statistically significant except b4; the parameters b3 and b4 estimated from "any injury" data were not statistically significant. A careful examination of the raw "any injury" data [39] revealed that the number of injuries reported for the 3250-3999 lb. class of vehicles were abnormally high, considering the number of accidents reported. Since no reasonable explanation could be found for the abnormalities, even after discussions with the authors of the New York report, it was concluded that the number of injuries classed "any injury" could be in error. A recalibration of the "any injury" model, eliminating the suspect data, yielded an R2 value of 0.88, much higher than the previously obtained value of 0.54. Because of this anomaly in the "any injury" data further discussion will be confined to the fatal or serious injury data. It can be seen from Table 5 that the algebraic signs of bI, b2 and b3 satisfy the nonnegativity condition (criterion (ii)). The algebraic sign of b4 should be interpreted with caution because it is not clear that driver seat belt use in car 2 should be related in any way to injury likelihood in car 1. A possible explanation for the negative estimate of b4 was hinted at earlier; seat belt users may be more cautious drivers who tend to be involved in accidents with lower closing speeds. When lvI - v21 is not reported in the accident data, the significance of b4 could arise from correlation of R2 with lv - v21. The stability of parameter estimates (criterion (iii)) was examined by adding and deleting variables representing restraint use from the regression equation. Table 6 gives the results for five cases: case 1 includes a term R1R2 depicting an interaction between belt users; case 2 corresponds to b2 = 0; case 3 corresponds to b, = 0; case 4 corresponds to bI = b2= 0; case 5 corresponds to (13), added for the sake of compari- son. In addition to the parameter estimates, the table also provides the value of R 2 for the various cases. As expected, the value of R 2 generally decreases when variables are eliminated from (13) and increases when an additional term is included. For the five cases, R2 varied from 0.68 to 0.81, indicating a statistically good fit regardless of the number of variables specified. The parameter estimates appear stable as variables are deleted and added. The only instability is the change of the algebraic sign of b4 when the interaction term R1R2 is added (case 1). This means that the model does not capture, in a consistent way, the effect of driver seat belt use in car 2. As mentioned earlier, the nonavailability of closing speed information can give rise to spurious correlation of the</page><page sequence="14">922 K. S. KRISHNAN, J. V. CARNAHAN AND M. J.

We conjecture that the coefficient of R2 would be statistically insignificant if IvI - v21 could be measured and included in the regression equation.

The algebraic signs for the coefficients bl, b2 and b3 satisfy the nonnegativity condition (criterion (ii)). As in the case of ITM, the instability of b4 is probably related to the influence of Iv - v21 that is reflected by R2. 7. Discussion of Results Automobile accident injury occurs because of the occupant's inability to withstand the forces generated by a collision. The injury threshold model proposed here is based on three postulates concerning the crash severity, the tolerance level for an occupant, and the random nature of the tolerance level. Because, in theory, the forces acting during a collision can be calculated from known physical laws, crash severity can be quantified in a direct fashion. Less is known about human tolerance to these forces because experiments involving humans must remain in the noninjurious region; human surrogates are used to study tolerance to greater forces and severe accelera- tions. Automobile accidents can be regarded as a source of experimental data for the case when human injury tolerance is regularly exceeded. Crash severity, however, cannot be measured precisely from accident reports; in addition, injury information is trans- formed according to the injury classification scheme used and the uniformity with which it is applied. These are some difficulties which must be overcome when using accident injury data to investigate injury causation. The overall adequacy of the injury threshold model was examined using two-car accident data from police reports from the states of New York and North Carolina. The analysis with New York data indicates that the injury threshold model and the three alternative models are statistically good with respect to the adequacy of the fit to the data, the meaning of the algebraic signs of the coefficients and their stability. The analysis of North Carolina data indicates that the injury threshold model is definitely superior to the alternative models with respect to predictive accuracy. The accident injury data used here did not provide a measure of closing speed. Closing speed is needed to more completely describe crash severity. The statistically significant negative coefficient of the variable denoting seat belt usage in car 2 (the "other" car) suggests that the seat belt usage is perhaps correlated with cautious driving and thus lower closing speeds. Further research is needed to verify if this is indeed the case. At this time, it is inappropriate to compare actual magnitudes of the two sets of parameters estimated from New York and North Carolina data because the closing</page><page sequence="16">924 K. S. KRISHNAN, J. V. CARNAHAN AND M. J. BECKMANN speed was not available in either case. There is no reason to believe that the distribution of closing speeds would be similar for the two sets of accidents involving various car sizes. In this particular case, the distributions are surely different since the North Carolina data involved only head-on collisions. In order to compare parameters in a meaningful fashion, it would also be necessary to ensure that the police implement the injury scale in a consistent manner. The object of this research is to identify the role of vehicle size in determining injury probability. The injury threshold model indicates that there are effects due to both the mass (or size) of the injured occupant's vehicle and the mass ratio with the colliding car. Additionally, belt usage affects injury probability. Despite the current lack of closing speed data, the proposed model can be used to tentatively assess a number of policy alternatives, such as decreased numbers of large cars or increased seat belt usage in small cars. There are several avenues being pursued presently to obtain more useful accident data. New York data may be made available with the collision configuration specified; this would provide some information about the direction and potential magnitude of the closing speed. North Carolina data are available by collision configuration, but need to be categorized by restraint usage. A superior data set to either of these is the National Crash Severity Study (NCSS), presently being collected [38]. These data will provide injury information classified using the Abbreviated Injury Scale and will contain estimates of Av and the principal direction of force. The NCSS data have been collected by seven multi-disciplinary accident investigation teams according to a stratified sampling scheme designed to provide a nationally representative data base. In order to more confidently assess the importance of vehicle size in preventing occupant injuries, the injury threshold model should be refined to include other aspects of occupant dynamics. Another refinement of the model has to do with the distribution of the critical level of tolerance for human beings. It is possible that the distribution for older people differs vastly from the one for younger people [4]. This could be investigated by segmenting the accident injury data by occupant age, and then obtaining an injury threshold model for each age group. References 1. MELA, D.
