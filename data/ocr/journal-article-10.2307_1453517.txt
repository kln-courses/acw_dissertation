<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH KALAM By HARRY A. WOLFSON, Harvard University IN THEIR OWN LITERATURE, written in Hebrew or Aramaic or in a mixture of both, the Jews who came under Muslim rule in the seventh century had no philosophic works corres- ponding to the philosophic writings of the Church Fathers possessed by the Christians who came under Muslim rule at the same time. Toward the end of the ninth century, however, philosophic works in Arabic of a Jewish content began to appear among them, and such works continued to flow, both in the East and in Spain, until the end of the twelfth century, though isolated philosophical works occasionally appeared also after that time.' A general characterization of that Jewish philosophic literature in Arabic from its very beginning to his own time is given by Maimonides in his introductory remarks to his systematic presentation of the Kalam in his Moreh Nebukim. "As for the little bit of Kalam regarding the subject of the unity of God and whatever is dependent upon this subject, which you will find among the Geonim and the Karaites, it all consists of matters which they borrowed from the Muta- kallimuln of Islam." 2 He then goes on to say that, since among the Muslim Mutakallimuin the first sect to appear was that of the Mu'tazilites, "it was from them that our corre- ligionists borrowed whatever they borrowed and it was their method that they followed," 3 but, as for the new views which appeared later with the coming of the Ash'arites, "you will not find any of them among our correligionists, not because they judiciously chose the former view in preference I Cf.

First, the influence of the Mutakallimiun upon the speculative Jewish theologians of the East, namely, "the Geonim," that is, the Rabbanites, and their opponents, "the Karaites," is to be found only in their treatment of "the unity of God and whatever is dependent upon it." Second, with regard to "the unity of God and whatever is dependent upon it," both the Rabbanites and the Karaites of the East followed the Mu'tazilite Kalam, whereas the extant writings of the Jewish philosophers in Spain show no influence whatsoever of the Kalam. Third, the preference of the Geonim and the Karaites for the views of the Mu'tazilites was not the result of a deliberate choice but rather of the mere chance of their having become acquainted with the Mu'tazilite views first. Each of these statements calls for comment. The first statement was meant to exclude such character- istic views held by the Mutakallimuln as atomism and the 4 Ibid., 11. 6-9. 5 Ibid., 11. 9-I3. Cf. Moreh Nebukim I, Introduction, p. IO, 11. 26-27, where, after stating that his work deals with certain recondite topics, Maimonides adds: "on which no book has been composed by any one in our religious community during this length of captivity, in so far as their writings on such topics are extant among us." Cf. also Munk, Guide des Egares, I, 7I, p. 339, n. I. 35</page><page sequence="3">546 HARRY A. WOLFSON denial of causality. With regard to atomism, while it was folowed by "the Karaites" of the East, such as Joseph al-Basir and Jeshua ben Judah, who were presumably known to Mai- monides, it was not followed by "the Geonim" nor, it may be added, by later Karaites, such as his own contemporary Judah Hadassi 6 and probably also others,7 who were unknown to Maimonides. With regard to the denial of causality, it was definitely not followed by "the Geonim" and it is doubtful whether it was followed by "the Karaites" of the East. The second statement is subject to several qualifications. The expression "the unity of God and whatever is dependent upon it," judged by what we actually find in the writings of the Geonim and the Karaites which reflect a Kalam back- ground, includes not only discussions of the meaniing of the unity of God but also discussions of proofs for the existence and incorporeality of God, proofs for the denial of the reality of attributes, and proofs for the creation of the world and the freedom of the human will. Now it is true that in all these discussions both the Rabbanites of the East and the Karaites followed the methods of the Mu'tazilite Mutakallimuln, but still there were certain differences between them. Thus, while both Rabbanites and Karaites deny the reality of attributes, Joseph al-Basir, the Karaite, followed Abiu Hashim's theory of modes, whereas Saadia, the Rabbanite, expresses himself in a way which excludes the theory of modes, and so does also al-Mukammas. Similarly with regard to the proofs of the creation of the world, which serve also as proofs for the exist- ence of God, while both the Rabbanites of the East and the Karaites use arguments which are characterized by Mai- monides himself as those of the Kalam, the Karaites, who adopted the Kalam theory of atoms, use these arguments in their original Kalam form as based upon atomism, whereas 6 Eshhol ha-Kofer 28, p. i9c-d. 7 Cf. Aaron b. Elijah of Nicomedia, Es HIayyim 4, pp. I7-I8. Some of my general statements in this and the next two paragraphs are based upon discussions of the respective subjects in my forthcoming work The Philosophy of the Kalam.</page><page sequence="4">THE JEWISH KALAM 547 Saadia, rejecting atomism, uses the same arguments in a modified form, from which the theory of atoms was eliminated. So also, with reference to his statement on the difference between the spokesmen of Judaism in the East and those in Andalusia, while it is true that some of the Jewish philo- sophers in Spain abandoned the Kalam method of proving the creation of the world and the existence of God, two of them, Bah.ya ibn Pakuda and Joseph ibn Saddik, like Saadia of the East, used the modified form of the Kalam arguments for the creation of the world and hence also for the existence of God. Undoubtedly his generalization was meant to refer only to those whom he includes in what he describes as "their recent authors" and evidently Bahya ibn Pakuda and Joseph ibn Saddik were not included by him among them. With regard to the problem of attributes, though it would seem to be included in the subject of "the unity of God" and hence it would also seem to be included in his generalization about the difference between the spokesmen of Judaism in the East and those of Andalusia, it can be shown that it is really not in- cluded in that generalization, and this for two reasons. First, fundamental issue in the problem of attributes there was no difference between the Mu'tazilites and those whom Maimoni- des calls "the philosophers." Second, the generalization refers only to those topics which are dealt with in the subsequent chapters on the Kalam; the attributes are dealt with in earlier chapters. The third statement, implying that were it not for the fact that the Geonim and Karaites had committed themselves to the views of the Mu'tazilites before the rise of the Ash'arites they might have followed the latter, is somewhat puzzling. There is no difference between the Mu'tazilites and the Ash'arites in their methods of proving the creation of the world and the existence and unity and incorporeality of God. There is a difference between them only on such general religious questions as attributes and the freedom of the will, and also on such a purely Muslim question as the eternity of</page><page sequence="5">548 HARRY A. WOLFSON the Koran. When, therefore, Maimonides by implication, says that but for the prior appearance of the Mu'tazilites the Geonim and Karaites might have followed the Ash'arites, does he mean to say that they might have followed the Ash- 'arites in accepting their view on the reality of attributes and predestination ? But there is no ground for such an assumption. The belief in the reality of attributes and the belief in pre- destination did not originate with the Ash'arites. They had been well established in Islam even before the Muctazilites came into being. The controversy in Islam over both these doctrines was known to the Geonim and the Karaites, and still they aligned themselves with the Mu'tazil- ites in rejecting the orthodox Muslim position, later espoused by the Ash'arites, on both these doctrines. Moreover, while it is true that Ash'arl's views may not have been known to Saadia at the time he wrote his Emunot ve-De'ot in Baghdad during the year 933, though the orthodox preaching andwriting of Ash'ari took place during the years 9I2-935, the last of which years he spent in Baghdad, where he died, Joseph al-Basir, the Karaite, quotes the Ash'arites and refutes them. How, then, could Maimonides say that the agreement of the Geonim and the Karaites with the Mu'tazilites was due to the mere chance that the Ash'arites were unknown to them? Reference to Jewish followers of the Muslim Kalam, with the mention of only the Karaites, is to be found also in Judah Halevi's Cuzari. In one place of this work, just as Halevi was about to make the rabbi expound for the king the Neopla- tonized Aristotelian system of philosophy, he makes the rabbi say: "I will not make you travel the road of the Karaites who went up to theology without a flight of steps (daraj: madregah), but I will provide you with a clear outline, which will allow you to form a clear conception of matter and form, then of the elements, then of nature, then of the soul, then of the intellect, then of theology." 8 On the face of it the passage 8 Cuzari V, 2, p. 294, 1. I8-p. 296, 1. I; p. 295, 1. i8-p. 297, 1.2 (ed. Hirschfeld).</page><page sequence="6">THE JEWISH KALAM 549 would imply that what he objected to was the fact that the Karaites plunged right into theology without a preliminary study of physics.9 But this, if we take the works of Joseph al-Basir and Jeshua ben Judah as examples, is not an exact description of their method. They do not plunge right into a discussion of theology. They rather start with a discussion of the need of rational speculation in dealing with theological problems. They then go on with explanations of certain terms and concepts used in the physical sciences, in the course of which they discuss the proofs for the creation of the world. It is only then that they take up the discussion of theological problems, such as the existence, the unity, the incorporeality of God, and attributes. This indeed is the method of the Kalam, but it is this method that is also used by such non- Karaite Jewish philosophers as Saadia and Bahya. In explanation of Halevi's statement it may be suggested that the expression "without daraj," which for the time being I have translated literally by "without a flight of steps", does not mean that the Karaites plunge right into theology without prefacing it by a preliminary discussion of physical concepts; it rather means that the physical concepts which the Karaites discuss preliminary to their discussion of theology are not those of a graded order of beings in a process of successive emanation, such as he himself describes later in his exposition of the Neoplatonized Aristotelian system of emanation, where he speaks of "the knowledge... of the rank (martabah: madregah) of Intelligence in its relation to the Creator, the rank of soul in its relation to intelligence, the rank of nature in its relation to soul, and the rank of spheres and stars and generated things in their relation to matter and form." 10 The term daraj is thus used here as the equivalent of the term martabah in the sense of "rank," "order," "hierarchy." Both these terms, it will be noticed, are in the Hebrew version of the Cuzari translated by madregah. What Halevi means to 9 Cf. commentaries ad. loc. 10 Cuzctri V, 12, p. 316, 11. 15-24; p. 317, 11. 9-18.</page><page sequence="7">550 HARRY A. WOLFSON say here is that, unlike the Karaites, such as Joseph al-Basir and Jeshua ben Judah, who, as followers of the Kalam, preface their exposition of theology by a discussion of such concepts as thing, existent and nonexistent, eternal and created, atom and accident, motion and rest, I shall preface my exposition of theology with a discussion of concepts more fashionable in the current philosophy of emanation and shall begin with the lowest, matter, and go up step by step to form and element and nature and soul and intellect until I ultimately arrive at a discussion of theology. According to both Halevi and Maimonides, then, there were among Jews those who followed the Kalam. Halevi, confining his discussion in that place to purely philosophic problems, mentions only the Karaites; Maimonides dealing also with theological problems mentions both Rabbanites and Karaites, describing their writings on these problems as "a little bit of Kalam," by which he means that they are few in number, and characterizing them as belonging to the Mu'ta- zilite type of the Muslim Kalam, by which he means that they all maintain certain traditional Jewish views on the unity and incorporeality of God and on the freedom of the human will which agree with views which in Islam were maintained by the Mu'tazilites over against the Ash'arites, and that they all, in their attempts to support these Jewish traditional views, use arguments which they borrowed from the Mu'tazilites. But the few written works of the Geonim and the Karaites anonymously referred to by Maimonides, as well as those which are known to us and are still extant, are not to be taken as the measure by which we are to estimate the extent to which discussions of speculative theology were carried on among Jews in Arabic countries during the period that the Kalam flourished in Islam. That was an age when not all who discussed or even taught philosophy or theology and had something new to say on either of these subjects committed their thoughts to writing. In works of Muslim authors of that</page><page sequence="8">THE JEWISH KALAM 55I time we find references to Jewish philosophers and theologians, of whom some are known only through some casual quotations by other authors and some are mere names. Thus Mas'udi (d. ca. 956) refers to a certain Abiu Kathir Yahya al-Katib of Tiberias, whom he describes as a teacher of Saadia and as one with whom he "had many discussions in the lands of Palestine and the Jordan concerning the abrogation of the Law ( Torah), the difference between torah and 'abodaht (lalc), and other subjects." 11 Nothing is known about him from other sources, though some modern scholars try to identify him with a certain Karaite Hebrew gramma- rian.12 Mas'udi also mentions two people whom he did not know personally, Da'iud, surnamed al-Mukammas, who lived in Jerusalem, and Ibrahim al-Baghdadi.13 Of these two, the first is known as the author of a work of the Kalam type; the latter is a mere name. He then mentions that at Rakka in Irak 14 he discussed philosophy and medicine with a certain Yahuda ibn Yusflf, surnamed Ibn Abul al-Thana, who was a pupil of Thabit ibn Kurra al-STbi, and in the same city he held also discussions with Sacid ibn 'Ali, surnamed Ibn Ashlamia.15 Of these two the first is known only through a quotation in Kirkisani; 16 the latter is a mere name. Finally, he reports that he had discussions with "those of their [i.e., Jewish] Mutakallimuln whom we have met in Baghdad, such as Ya'kulb ibn Mardawalh and Yusulf ibn Kayyiima," con- cluding with the following statement: "The last one of them, whom we have seen from among those who came to visit us from Baghdad after the year 300 [-9I2], is Ibrahim al- Yahudi . . .

WOLFSON skillful in argumentation than all their Mutakallimiun in modern times."7 Nothing is known about any of these three names. Isa ibn Zur'a (943-IO09) mentions a certain Abul al-Hayr Dafld ibn Mulsaf, of whom he says that "he was one of the principal Mutakallimuin of the Jews and the foremost thinker among them." 18 Referred to as Abul al-Hayr al- Yahfidi, he is also mentioned by AbM Hayyan al-Tauhidi (d. IOO9) as a member of a group of philosophers in Baghdad formed around Abui Sulayman Muhammad ibn TThir al- SijistanI.'9 But there is no mention of him in Jewish literature. Moreover, Saadia himself discusses two views in connection with the doctrine of creation, of one of which he says that it has been reported to him of "certain persons of our own people" 20 and of the other that it is entertained "by one of our people whom I have known." 21 Neither of these views is traceable to any written work. Similarly toward the end of a Bodleian manuscript of the Arabic text of the first part of Maimonides Guide of the Perplexed there is a marginal note, purported to have been written by Maimonides himself, in which among well-known Jewish theologians and philosophers it mentions two unknown philosophers, one of whom has been identified as a contemporary of Saadia, who is mentioned in some other source, and the other is not mentioned any- where else.22 From all this we may gather that, besides those speculative theologians who have written books and whose books have come down to us, there were others who did not write books or whose books have not come down to us. We also gather that all those Jewish speculative theologians of that period, both the known and the unknown, were referred to as Mutakalli- muin. We have seen how Mas'uldi applies this term to those 17 Op. cit., p. II3, 1. i8-p. II4, 1. 4. 18 Quoted from a manuscript by Munk, Guide 1, 71 (p. 337, n.). 19 Cf.

We also find that Ibn Hazm applies the term Mutakallimuin to Saadia, Mukammas, Ibrahim al-Baghdadi, and Abul Kathir of Tiberias.23 And so also Moses ibn Ezra, writing in Arabic, speaks of "the most glorious Mutakallimuln, Rabbi Saadia and Rabbi Hai and others." 24 Knowing then as we do that, besides those glorious Jewish Mutakallimuln who speak to us from the pages of their writings, there was among the Jews during the period of the Muslim Kalam a host of mute Mutakallimuln unknown to glory, we should like to find out whether all those unknown Jewish Mutakallimuln, like those known to us through their writings, represented in Judaism a kind of Kalam which was like that of Mu'tazilism in Islam or whether among them there were also those who deviated from that standard type of the Jewish Kalam. Moreover, knowing as we also do that the later Jewish religious thinkers in Spain, who are described by Maimonides as philosophers, while differing from the earlier Jewish religious thinkers of the East in their method of demonstration, did not differ from them in their views on problems which in Islam were a matter of controversy between Mu'tazilites and orthodox, we should like to know more generally whether among Arabic-speaking Jews from the time of Saadia to that of Maimonides there were any groups of people or any individuals who deviated from the common pattern of views which we find in the works of Jewish religious thinkers of that period. That in general, corresponding to the influence of Mu'tazi- lism upon religious rationalization among Jews in Muslim countries, there was also an influence of Muslim orthodoxy upon those Jews who opposed religious rationalization may be gathered from the literature of the time. Early in the 23 Fisal III, p. I7I, 11. 23-24 (ed. Cairo, I317-27); cf. I.

WOLFSON tenth century, when religious rationalization had just made its appearance among Jews, Saadia tried to forestall oppo- sition to it by introducing a fictitious "some one", a Jew, who, he says, might question the advisability of probing rationally into matters religious on the ground that "there are people (al-nas: ha-(am) who disapprove of such an occu- pation, being of the opinion that speculation leads to unbelief and is conducive to heresy." 25 The term "people" here, as may be judged from Saadia's answer, refers to Muslims. What Saadia, therefore, does here is to make a Jew raise doubt concerning religious rationalization by citing against it the opinion of orthodox Muslims. In his answer, Saadia says: "Such an opinion is held only by the common people among them" 26_-that is, among the Muslims. Saadia then adds that, should that some one try to infer an objection to religious rationalization from a certain passage in the Talmud, he can be shown to be wrong.27 In his entire discussion of the problem, it will be noticed, Saadia never refers to the existence of actual opposition to religious rationalization among the Jews of his time. All he does is to set up a fictitious Jewish character who, having heard that among Muslims there were those who objected to religious rationalization, tried to find support for such objection in some rabbinic passage. A century later, however, perhaps as a result of the effect of religious rationalization upon certain Jews, we find among Arabic-speaking Jews outspoken opposition to it, reechoing sentiments like those heard among orthodox Muslims. Thus Ibn Janah, himself a physician, logician, and philologist, the author in Arabic of one of the most important Hebrew grammars and lexicons, commenting upon the verse, which he takes to mean "beware of the making of many books without end" (Eccl. I2: 12), says: "By this warning the sage prohibits only the preoccupation with the study of those books which, 25 Emunot, Introduction 6, p. 20, 11. i8, 20-21. 26 Ibid., p. 21, 1. 1. 27 Ibid., p. 2I, 11. 5 ff.</page><page sequence="12">THE JEWISH KALAM 555 according to the claim of those who have made a study of them, lead to a knowledge of the principles and the elements whereby one may investigate most thoroughly the nature of the upper world and the lower world, for that is a matter of which the real truth one cannot come to know and the end of which one cannot attain. Moreover, it injures religion and destroys faith and wearies the soul without any compensation and without any satisfaction, as the verse continues to say, 'and much study is a weariness to the flesh.' It is to this, too, that the sage makes allusion in his statement, 'all things are full of weariness: man cannot utter them' (Eccl. i: 8), that is to say, they are things which cause weariness because they are incomprehensible. According to the sage, therefore, the proper thing is to abandon oneself to God, to obey that which has been commanded in the Law, and resignedly to cleave to faith, as he says subsequently: 'the end of the matter, all having been heard: fear God, and keep His commandments; for this is the whole man' (Eccl. I2: I3)-and leave alone that the truth whereof is past comprehension." 28 But still we should like to know how far did that opposition go. Was it merely against the use of rational methods of demonstration of religious beliefs? or was it also against certain rationalized beliefs themselves? We would especially like to know whether among these Jews who opposed philo- sophic rationalization of religion there were any who, like the orthodox in Islam, openly advocated the reality of attributes and predestination or, like some orthodox in Islam, also advocated openly the corporeality of God. Let us examine these three questions one by one. With regard to the belief in the reality of attributes, there is nothing in the Jewish Scripture, as in fact there is nothing in the Muslim Koran, that could provoke the rise of such a 28 Kitab al-Lumcaz, ed. J. Derenbourg, Ch. XXIV, p. 267, 11. II-2I; Sefer ha-Rikmah, ed. M. Wilensky, Ch. XXIV (XXV), p. 282, 11. 9-I6; cf. S. Munk, "Notice sur Abou'l-Walid Merwan Ibn-Djana'h," Journal Asiatique, i6 (I850), pp. 45-46.</page><page sequence="13">556 HARRY A. WOLFSON belief spontaneously. Nor is there to be found among the Jews of that time the particular external circumstance, namely, the influence of Christianity, which caused the rise of the belief in the reality of attributes in Islam.29 Nor is there any reason to assume that any of the simple-minded pious Jews could have acquired such a belief by having merely heard orthodox Muslims utter it in the recitation of their creed.30 Still less is there reason to assume, without positive evidence, that any of the learned among Jews could have become persuaded by the arguments of orthodox Muslim theologians-arguments mainly defensive-to adopt a belief which constantly stood in need of defense. When, therefore, the spokesmen of Judaism of that time, in their published writings. with one voice reject the reality of attributes, we have reason to believe that no such belief found any followers in Judaism. The case of predestination is somewhat different. Though the Jewish Scripture is more explicit than the Koran in its assertion of free choice by man, still, like the Koran, it is just as emphatic in its assertion of the power and foreknow- ledge of God. Even among the rabbinic assertions of free will, there is one in which the expression "freedom of choice is given" is qualified by the statement that "everything is foreseen." 31 Moreover, in rabbinic literature, despite its many explicit assertions of free will, there are certain state- ments which would seem to imply predestination, such, for instance, as the one discussed by Maimonides himself, namely, that God predesignates "the daughter of so and so for so and so and the wealth of so and so for so and so." 32 In the case of 29 Cf. my paper "The Muslim Attributes and the Christian Trinity", Harvard Theological Review, 49 (I956), pp. i-i8. 30 Cf., e.g., the creed called Fikh Akbar (II) in Wensinck's Mutslim Creed, pp. I88-I89 (Arabic, p. 6, 1.

It happens, however, that among all the Jewish philosophers prior to Maimonides, who argue against predestination, or against those who believe in predestination, there is not a single one who suggests, however slightly, that those against whom he argues were Jews. Direct information with regard to the problem of predestin- ation and free will among Jews in Muslim countries may be gathered from statements in two works of Maimonides. In his Mishneh Torah, in the course of his expounding on the basis of scriptural and rabbinic passages the traditional Jewish view of free will. Maimonides urges the reader to pay no heed to "that which is said by the ignorant (voo) among the gentiles and most of the uninformed (911zl) among the Jews, to wit, that the Holy One decrees concerning man at the beginning of his formation [in his mother's womb] whether he should be righteous or wicked." 33 The Hebrew term tip peshim in the expression "the tippeshim among the gentiles," I take it, is used by him as the equivalent of the Arabic terms bulh and jdhilan or juhhl which are used by him in his Moreh Nebutkim in the sense of those who follow only tradition and are either ignorant of philosophy or are opposed to it. 34 In other words, the term tippeshim is used 33 Mishneh Torah, Maddac, Teshutbah V, 2. 34 Cf. the Arabic terms 4k and c~)&amp;L., or J as used in Morah I, 32, p. 47, 1.

It is thus clear that not even in Arabic-speaking countries, where belief in predestination dominated among non-Jews, was there open opposition to free will among Jews, though most of the ignorant among the Arabic-speaking Jews in those Arabic-speaking Muslim countries, while not openly denying free will, spoke like their non-Jewish neighbors of the extension of the power of God over the actions of man. So also is the case of the problem of the incorporeality of God. In the Jewish Scripture as in the Muslim Koran, while there are direct injunctions against likening God to any created beings, God is constantly described in anthropo- morphic terms. Similarly in the post-Biblical traditional Jewish literature, the rabbis, evidently in pursuance of their own principle that the scriptural anthropomorphisms should not be taken literally, allowed themselves to describe God in anthropomorphic terms, evidently expecting not to be taken literally. In this case, too, it would be reasonable to assume that when Arabic-speaking Jews became acquainted with Muslim discussions about the problem of the corporeality and incorporeality of God and got wind of how in Islam those who believed in the corporeality of God interpreted the Koranic verses prohibiting the likening of God with other beings, there would be some among them who came to believe 37Moreh III, 17, Fifth Theory, p. 338, 1. 30.</page><page sequence="17">560 HARRY A. WOLFSON in a similar view of the corporeality of God. But whether there actually were such believers and who they were is a subject which bears investigation. Let us then study and analyze certain passages which may have a baring on this question. The most promising passage is to be found in Saadia's Emunol ve-De(ot, written in Baghdad during the year 933. In the Introduction to this work, after intimating that his work was written for the benefit of both non-Jews, to whom he refers as "my species, the species of rational beings," and Jews, to whom he refers as "our people, the children of Israel," 38 he enumerates three types of people, evidently among both non-Jews and Jews, whom he envisaged as readers of his book: first, "many believers whose belief was not pure and whose creeds were not sound"; second, "many deniers of the faith who boast of their unbelief and look down upon men of truth, although they were themselves in error"; third, "men sunk, as it were, in seas of doubt and overwhelmed by waves of confusion." 39 Of these three types of readers envisaged by Saadia, only the first type may be assumed to include those who believed in the corporeality of God, and in fact there is one long passage which deals with this type of readers. We shall, therefore, have to find out whether that passage contains any reference to such believers among Jews. Now, the passage in question begins with a twofold division of those who believed in the corporeality of God: (I) "those who believe that they can picture God in their imagination as a body" and (2) "those who, without expressly attributing to Him corporeality, yet they arrogate for God quantity or quality or place or time or other such categories; however, when they make these arrogations, they really insist upon His being corporeal, for 38 Emunot, Introduction 2, p. 4, 11. 15-I6; cf.

Of course, there existed during the time of Saadia the arch-anthropomorphic work Shi(ur Komah, which both Karaite and Muslim writers held up as evidence of the Jewish belief in the corporeality of God. But this work does not preach the corporeality of God; it only describes God in corporeal terms, the like of which, though in a lesser degree, is to be found in certain passages of both the Bible and the Talmud, and Saadia is reported to have written a work, no longer extant, in which he maintains that, if that work is really of the authorship of Rabbi Ishmael, and not of that of some irresponsible person, who need not be paid attention to, then its corporeal descriptions of God should be interpreted figuratively in the same way as similar corporeal descriptions of God in Scripture are, according to Jewish tradition, to be interpreted figuratively.42 Thus, according to Saadia, in any work of a responsible author, the mere use of anthropomorphic descriptions of God is not to be taken as a belief in the corporeality of God and still less the advocacy of such a belief. Bahya, however, in his work Hobot ha-Lebabot, written in Saragossa during the latter part of the eleventh century, alludes to a type of pious man among Jews, who, because of his failure to comprehend the figurativeness of scriptural anthropomorphisms, unknowingly forms a corporeal con- ception of God. But the pious believer of this type is described 40 Ibid. II, Exordium, p. 76, 1. I9-p. 77, 1. 2. 41 Ibid.

WOLFSON by him as "ignorant and foolish" (al-jdhil al-ghabi: ha-kesil ha-peti), who, he says, is to be forgiven only when his ignorance is due to a lack of capacity to learn, but he is to be held responsible for his erroneous belief if he has the capacity to learn and to know better and fails to do so.43 Quite evidently what he means by this is that no learned Jew, not one learned in philosophy but one learned in Jewish lore, could believe in the corporeality of God. Similarly Abraham ibn Daud in his Emunah Ramahs, which appeared in Toledo in II68, says that "the belief of the common people, who are wont to follow the popular notion of God, is [that God is a body], for they think that whatever has no body has no existence. It is only when they are ad- monished [by citations from Scripture] that they come to believe in accordance with what has been transmitted by the teachings of the forbears and the rabbis. But still, if they are not guided [by philosophy], there will always stir in their minds doubts and confusing thoughts, and it is concerning such as these that Scripture says, "Forasmuch this people draw near, and with their mouth honor me, but have removed their heart from Me" (Isa. 29: I3).44 Here, again, the impli- cation is that the ordinary Jew would not openly profess the corporeality of God, even though, not being a philosopher, he cannot conceive of God as incorporeal. Twelve years later, in the Mishneh Torah composed in ii8o, Maimonides tries to establish two points with regard to the incorporeality of God. First, applying the scriptural rejection of any likeness between God and other beings (Isa. 40: 25) to the scriptural doctrine of the unity of God (Deut. 6:4 4), he shows that the mandatory belief that there 43 Hobot 1, IO, p. 74, 1.

This is undoubtedly due to the fact that no Jew, however ignorant and however unable to conceive of the existence of anything incorporeal, ever dared openly to assert that God was corporeal. From all this we may gather that by the time of the compo- sition of the Mishneh Torah in ii8o, there was none among Arabic-speaking Jews who openly advocated the corporeality of God and that even the common people, who may not have been able to conceive of the subtlety of an incorporeal exist- ence and may not also have been able to explain, or even to understand, the figurative interpretations of the scriptural anthropomorphisms, did not dare openly to profess a belief in the corporeality of God. A few years later, in his Moreh Nebukim, composed some- time between II85 and II90, 48 Maimonides refers to "people" who, because they "thought" that the term "form" in the verse (Gen. I: 26), "Let us make man in our form (selem), after our likeness (demut)," 49 iS to be taken literally, "came 45 Mishneh Torah, Madda', Yesode ha-Torah, I, 7-8. 46 CAbodah Zarah 26b; cf. op. cit., Yesode ha-Torah, I, 6. 47 Op. cit., Teshubah, III, 7. 48 See D. H. Baneth's comment in his edition of Iggerot ha-Rambam I, p. 2, on the date II85 given by Z. Diesendruck. 49 We may assume that, in the Arabic translation of the Pentateuch used by the people referred to here by Maimonides, the Hebrew selem,</page><page sequence="21">564 HARRY A. WOLFSON to believe that God has the form (sgrah) of man, that is to say, man's figure and shape,... maintaining that, if they did not conceive of God as a body possessed of a face and a hand similar to their own figure and shape, they would reduce Him to nonexistence. However, He is, in their opinion, the greatest and most splendid [of bodies] and also His matter is not flesh and blood." 50 After explaining how the term "form" (selem: sftyrah) is not to be take anthropomorphi- cally, Maimonides goes on to explain how also the term "likeness" (demut: shiibh) is not to be taken anthropomorphi- cally. Who were these "people"? Here are some texts which will help us to answer this question. Ibn Hazm, in his attempt to show that the Hebrew Bible has an anthropomorphic conception of God, quotes Genesis I: 26, which, in the Arabic version used by him, reads: "Let me make sons of Adam after our form (sfrah = selem), after our likeness (shibh = demut)." Commenting upon it, he says that, if only the phrase "after our form" were used, there would be justification for interpreting it figuratively. But the phrase "after our likeness," which immediately follows it, "shuts out interpretations, blocks up loopholes, cuts off roads, and of necessity and inevitably must the phrase be taken to attribute the likeness of Adam to God. The absurdity of this, however, is immediately perceived by the understanding, for shibh and mithl mean the same thing [namely, likeness], and far be it from God that He should have a mithl or shibh [that is, a likeness]." 51 The conclusion he wants us to draw here is that, inasmuch as the term "likeness" cannot be taken figuratively, the term "form" is also not to be taken figuratively. The reason why, in the "image," in Genesis I: 26 was translated siirah, "form," for so it is also translated by Saadia. 50 Moreh I, I, p. 14, II* 5-II. 51 Ibn Hazm, Fisal, I, p. II7, 1. 2I-p. iI8, 1. 4.</page><page sequence="22">THE JEWISH KALAM 565 midst of his trying to prove the anthropomorphism of the Bible, he goes out of his way to concede that the phrase "after our form" by itself could be interpreted figuratively, is to be found in the fact that two Jewish authors of works in Arabic, Saadia and Kirkisani, the former in his comment on the term selem in Genesis i: 27' which is only a repetition of Genesis I: 26, and the latter in his comment on the term selem both in Genesis I: 26 and in Genesis I: 27, interpret that term figuratively. 52 His certainty that the term shibh, "likeness," in Genesis I: 26, on account of its being synony- mous with the term mithl, cannot be taken figuratively but must be taken literally, is undoubtedly due to his belief that the Koranic verse (42: 9), "Nought is there like Him (ka- mithlihi)," was aimed at Genesis i: 26. Here then we have a Muslim who dismisses the attempt of two Jewish authors to interpret the term "form" (selem: sgyar) in Genesis I: 26 and I: 27 and, in opposition to them, insists that, like the term "likeness" (demut: shibh) in Genesis I: 26, the term "form" in the same verse, must be taken literally. Then there are passages from which it can be shown that the term selem in Genesis i: 27, which, as remarked before, is only a repetition of Genesis I: 26, was taken by certain Muslims in an anthropomorphic sense. Shahrastani in his Nihdyat reports that several subsects of the Shi'ites, among them the Hishamiyyah, as well as "the 52 Saadia, Emunot II, 9, p. 94, II. I4-I8: "by way of conferring honor (cald /arik al-tashryf)," which he goes on to explain as meaning that, although all forms are created by God, "He honored one of them by saying 'This is My form,' by way of conferring distinction ('ala sabil al-tahsis)." Kirkisani, Anwar II, 28, 12, p. 176, II. 7-8 (ed. Leon Nemoy): "by way of conferring distinction and honor (cala sabil a!-tahsis wa'l-tashrif)." Ibn HJazm, op. cit., p. 117, 1. 24-p. ii8, 1.

WOLFSON anthropomorphists among the Attributists," by which is meant a certain group of Sunnites, believed that "God has a form like the form of men," adding that this belief of theirs was based upon a statement attributed to Muhhammad, of which there were two readings: (i) "God created Adam in His form (sgyrah) ;" (2) "God created Adam in the form of the Merciful." 53 One of these unnamed "anthropomorphists among the Attributists" can be identified with Da'uid al- Jawarl, who is gnoted by Shahrastani in his Milal as saymg (i) that "God is a body and flesh and blood, who has limbs and organs," and (2) that the statement, "God created Adam in the form of the Merciful," which tradition attributes to Muhammad, is to be taken in a literal sense. 54 Now the statement attributed to Muhammad, in either of its readings, is not to be found in the Koran. It can be traced, however, in both its readings, to Genesis I: 27. In English, this verse in Genesis reads: "And God created man (ha-adam) in His image (selem), in the image of God created He him." Among the early Muslims, we may imagine, this verse, minus the last three words, which in Arabic would have been one word, was circulated orally in an Arabic version which read: "And God created Adam in His form (~s7rah), in the form of the Merciful." Thus also in Saadia's Arabic translation of the Pentateuch, the first part of the verse reads: "And God created Adam in His form." As for the substitution of "the Merciful" for "God" in the second part, it was quite natural for Muslims used to the language of the Koran. Then, we may further imagine, the verse, in its oral circulation, was broken up into two parts, (i) "God created Adam in His form;" (Z) "God created Adam in the form of the Merciful," and both these parts were attributed to Muhammad. Ghazali, commenting upon one of the readings of the statement traditionally attributed to Muhammad, says: 53 Nihdyat, p. I03, 1. I1-p. I04, 1. I. 54 Milal, p. 77, 11. 5-I8.</page><page sequence="24">THE JEWISH KALAM 567 "If [by the term form in] the Prophet's saying that 'God created Adam in His form' you understand the external form which is perceived by eye-sight, you will be an absolute anthropomorphist, as the one addressed in the saying, 'Be an out-and-out Jew, or else play not with the Torah;' but, if you understand by it the inner form, which is perceived by mental insight (basd'ir) and not by eye-sight (absdr), you will be one who keeps himself free from anthropomorphism in every respect and declares God to be holy-a perfect man, walking the straight way, for you are in the holy valley of Tuwwa [Surah 20:12] ."55 GhazMfi's quotation here of the saying with its warning not to play with the Torah means, I take it, that those who take the statement of Muhammad anthropo- morphically are like the Jews who take the corresponding statement in Genesis I: 27 anthropomorphically, thus re- flecting a contention like that of Ibn Hazm, or perhaps Ibn Hazm's very contention, that the "form of God" in the story of the creation of Adam as told in Genesis was meant to be taken by Jews in an anthropomorphic sense. Finally, the Hishamiyyah, of whom Shahrastani in his Nihdyat has reported that they took the "form of God" in the creation of Adam anthropomorphically, reports in his Milal of their founder Hisham b. al-Hakam that he said that "God is a body possessing parts and is of a certain size, but He is unlike any created thing and no created thing is like Him," 57 which means, as the same view is quoted by Ash'arl, again, in the name of the founder of the Hishamiyyah, Hisham b. al-Hakam, that "God is a body unlike other bodies." 57 Similarly al-Jawari, of whom Shahrastani has also reported that he took the "form of God" in the creation of Adam anthropoporphically, reports of him that he also said 55 Ihydi, XXXV: Kitab al-Tauhid wacl-Tawakkul, IV, p. 245, 11. 26-29 (ed. Cairo, I358/I939). 56 Milal, p. I4I, 11. 7-8. 57 Makalat, p. 33, 11. I0-II; p. 208, 1. I.</page><page sequence="25">568 HARRY A. WOLFSON that "God is a body unlike other bodies, flesh unlike other flesh, blood unlike other blood." 58 From these passages we gather that Ibn Hazm directly and GhazMfi indirectly contended that the term selem = sqrah "form," in Genesis I: 26 and I: 27 is to be taken in an anthro- pomorphic sense, and so does Ibn Hazm also contend with regard to the term demut = shibh, "likeness," in Genesis I: 26. Moreover, when a statement based upon Genesis I: 27 was attributed to Muhammad, some Muslims took the term "form" in it, which is the Hebrew selem, in an anthropo- morphic sense. Finally, those of them who took the term "form" anthropomorphically qualified their anthropomorphic conception of God by saying, in the words of one of them, that "God is a body unlike other bodies, flesh unlike other flesh, blood unlike other blood." In the light of all this, when Maimonides refers to "people who "thought" that the term "form" in the story of the crea- tion of Adam in Genesis i: 26 is to be taken anthropomorphi- cally, the people referred to are Muslims; when he also says that these people conceded that God is "the greatest and most splendid [of bodies] and also His matter is not flesh and blood," the reference is to the concession made by those Muslims who took the term "form" in the story of the creation of Adam anthropomorphically; and when he continues to argue that even the term demut = shibh ,"likeness," is not to be taken anthropomorphically, the argument is aimed at Ibn Hazm. No "people" who interpreted Genesis I: 26 anthropomorphically can be traced to Jewish sources. Nor are we to assume that such an interpretation of Genesis I: 26 was communicated to him orally by some Jews or were reported to him orally in the name of some Jews, for, whenever Maimonides deals with something that has been communicated to him orally, he usually says so. 59 58 Milal, P. 77, 1 i a9 59 See MorehlI, 2 beginning, and quotation at the next note below.</page><page sequence="26">THE JEWISH KALAM 569 Reference however, to certain individuals among Jews who either doubted or denied the incorporeality of God is to be found in his Ma'mar Tehiyyat ha-Metim, composed at about II90, in answer to certain critics of his Mishneh Torah. The passage in question reads as follows: "We have met some one who was looked upon as a learned Jewish scholar and, by the eternal God! he was familiar with the way of the traditional law and from his youth had participated, as he claimed, in disputes about the Law, and still he was in doubt whether God is a body, possessing eye, hand, foot, and entrails, as mentioned in some scriptural verses, or whether He is not a body. More- over, others from among the people of some countries whom I have met definitely decided that God is a body and declared anyone who disagreed with this to be an unbeliever, applying to him the various Hebrew terms for heretic, and took the anthropomorphic passages of the rabbis in their literal sense. Similar things I have heard about men whom I have not met." 60 In this passage, the hesitant opponent of the incorporeality of God, with whom are contrasted those "others from among the people of some countries," was undoubtedly a countryman of Maimonides, visiting him in Fostat from some other city in Egypt. The fact that Maimonides shows himself surprised that such a view should be held by one reputed to be versed in Jewish traditional law indicates that he suspected him to have fallen victim to some outside influence. We may simi- larly assume that the other opponents of incorporeality in this passage were also Jews from Muslim countries, though there is nothing to support this assumption except the fact that up to that time all opposition to Maimonides came from Jews in Muslim countries. That Jews in Muslim coun- tries were not altogether impervious to the influence of Islam in religious matters may be inferred from a responsum 60 Ma'amar Tehiyyat ha-Metim in Kobes II, p. 8a (ed. J. Finkel, ?? 3-4).</page><page sequence="27">570 HARRY A. WOLFSON by Maimonides himself addressed to Rabbi Phinehas b.

Maimonides refers to it only by saying "some people thought" or "we have already met some one who . .. was in doubt" or "others . . . whom I have met have definitely decided." Evidently no one, and certainly no man of stature dared, openly in writing, to oppose the belief in the incorporeality of God, and still less to advocate or even to condone the belief in God's corpo- reality. The first man of stature who dared, openly in writing, to oppose the belief in the incorporeality of God and to condone, if not directly to advocate, the belief in His corporeality was Rabbi Abraham ben David of Posquieres. In his splenetic attacks upon Maimonides' Mishlnehl Torah, the composition of which attacks is placed after II93,63 commenting upon Maimonides' inclusion in his list of heretics "anyone who says that God is one but is a body and possesses a figure," he ejac- ulates: "Why does he call such a person a heretic, when many people, greater and better than he, followed such a conception (mahashabah) of God on the ground of its being in accordance with what they had seen in the verses of Scripture and even more by reason of what they had seen in the words of those Agadot which set minds awondering ?" 64 61 Teshubot ha-Rambam I40 (Kobes I, p. 25b). 62 M.

And should we assume that the expression which I have translated "followed such a conception of God" was used by him advisedly in order to indicate that, while nobody in Judaism ever openly said that God is a body, still there were many who, not being philosophers like Maimonides, could not but conceive of God, in their mind, as a corporeal being, then what reason had he for assuming that Maimonides would attach heresy to one's mere conception of God as a body without his actually saying that God is a body? Did not Maimonides use the expression "anyone who says?" 65 In fact, as I have shown elsewhere, the more conception of God as corporeal by one who is, as described by Maimonides, incapable of conceiving of the existence of anything incor- poreal is not regarded by him as heresy. 66 And should it occur to us to assume that by "many people greater and better that he" he referred to some post-Talmudic authors and liturgists known to him who, following the example of Scripture and the Agadot of the Talmud, did not hesitate to use anthropomorphic descriptions of God, then what reason had he for assuming that such descriptions are an indication of a belief in the corporeality of God? Why did he not assume that those authors and liturgists, because they interpreted the anthropomorphisms of Scripture and the Agadot of the Talmud figuratively, did themselves also describe God anthropomorphically in a figurative sense? Did not Saadia say, as quoted in a work undoubtedly known to him, that the anthropomorphisms in the Talmud as well and wonder.

WOLFSON as in the Shicur Komah are to be taken figuratively, even as are those in Scripture? 67 If, again, the rabbi of Posquieres were challenged to tell whether he himself believed that God is a body, then perhaps, even without the prompting of the Christian Tertullian 68 or of Muslim Mutakallimun,69 he could by his own wit hit upon the sbtlety that on the mere showing of scriptural teaching the scriptural unlikeness of God only means that God is a body unlike other bodies.70 But here, again, what reason had he for assuming that Maimonides, who derived the incorporeality of God from the scriptural teaching of his unlikeness, would include among his five classes of heretics one who said that God is a body unlike other bodies? In fact, as I have shown elsewhere, no heresy is attached by Maimoni- des to the assertion that God is a body unlike other bodies; he only requires that the term "body" be used in an equivocal sense.71 It is more reasonable to assume, therefore, that, if he were so challenged, he would honestly and frankly admit that he did not believe that God is a body. Later, during the controversy over the Moreh Nebukim, none of the authori- tative spokesmen of Judaism advocated a belief in the corporeality of God-not even those who were opposed to Maimonides's philosophical interpretation of anthropomor- phisms in scriptural verses and talmudic lore.72 When rumors reached Nahmanides of French rabbis who objected to a certain anti-anthropomorphic statement of Maimonides, he gently reasoned with them, politely showing that they were wrong, and thereafter nothing was heard of their objection.

Solomon of Montpellier and his pupil David ben Saul, two philosophic innocents, who in the first flush of their opposition to Maimonides proclaimed their wholesale belief in the literalness of the Agadot of the Talmud, including the literalness of the corporeal terms used in the Agadic description of God,74 later recanted and openly protested that "far be it from them to conceive of God as having a likeness or form or a hand or a foot or any of the other limbs which happen to be mentioned in the text of Scripture; never had they uttered such a view nor had such a thought ever entered their mind." 75 And perhaps more loftily than they, but at the same time also more uprightly than they, would the rabbi of Posquieres have declared: "Many people, even as great and good as I, had oftentimes spoken hastily and said things which they later withdrew." 73Milhamot ha-Shem by Abraham Maimonides in Kobes III, pp. 17d-i8a. 74 Ketab Tamim in Osar Nehmad III, i86o, pp. 58 ff. 75 Ibid., p.
