<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Architecture and Organization of Kerala Style Hindu Temples William A. Noble Abstract. - As a basic guiding principle, some emphasis is given to a widespread belief among South A sians that existence is centered in creation, or god, or the gods, or nirvana, or any combination of these. The architectural response to centrality by Buddhists, Jainas, and Hindus exists at centers as widely separated in space as Takt-i-Bahi (in Pakistan), Martand, Girnar, Tanjore (in India), and Paharpur (in B angla Desk), and as widely separated in time as the stupa at Shah-Dheri (about 1st Cent. B. C.) and the presently used Hindu temples of Kerala State, India. In the Hindu temples of Kerala style, the principle of centrality was strongly adhered to and is architecturally reflected in the most basic, simple forms. - For Kerala style Hindu temples, the parts are first identified. These then are used, like building blocks, to reveal how well-established principles guided the construction of a spectrum of simple to complex temples. Always, in temple development, was there special attention payed to the centering of the deity's image, or the images of deities, in each temple. Introduction In 1972 Hiroshi Tanaka walked to the 88 Buddhist pilgrimage centers of Shikoku, Japan. His subsequent analysis focused upon the reality that "no two temple compounds are identical, but all include the same basic elements and share similar characteristics" (Tanaka 1977:111). If one deals with a William A. Noble, Ph. D., is Associate Professor at the University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri. - He has for over ten years been collecting data pertaining to sati in India. Noble's interest in South A sian folk architecture has continued for over fifteen years (cf., e.g., Anthropos 61. 1966: 727 ff.; 71. 1976: 90ff.). He is currently preparing a report on "Houses with Central Courtyards, in Kerala (South India)" He has also been studying South Indian Megalithic remains for a similar period of time.

Master craftsmen (mainly the A saris, members of the carpenter caste) have from generation to generation consistently adhered to basic principles of architecture and functional design. Thus any Hindu wor- shiper is assured of a worship microcosm in which the degree of expectancy is sufficiently met to put the mind at ease. A treatment of the basic features used to create a variant spectrum of the Kerala style Hindu temple will form the theme of my writing. Although we are dealing with a Hindu-related theme, it is worth noting that evidence indicates the existence for millennia of a basic guiding principle which has strongly influenced the architecture and organi- zation of many Buddhist, Jaina, and Hindu temples in South Asia. The Kerala style Hindu temples are mainly located in the southwestern- most state of India (Map 1), where a comparatively narrow strip of land stretches from the Arabian Sea up into the highest mountains in South India (Anaimudi, in Kerala, 2695 m, is the highest peak in South India). x Kerala State is the realm of Malayalee people who speak Malayalam. Present Kerala State was formed through the joining of the Kasaragod Taluk in South Kanara (Madras State), the Malabar District (Madras State), Cochin State, and Tra- vancore State (excluding the southern Tamilian region down to Cape Comorin, which was joined to Tamil Nadu). 1. The Basic Guiding Principle All men are pilgrims during their short life on earth. Sooner or later, in one form or another, they are forced to grapple with death and its relation- ship to ultimate reality. Any theorizing of ultimate reality will involve many questions pertaining to birth, the magnificent and miraculous processes of creation or preservation, and the climax of death. Brahma - The Creator, Vishnu - The Preserver, and Shiva - The Destroyer are a reflection of a Hindu effort to grapple with ultimate reality. Birth, death, and preservation are so intertwined that it is normal, for example, for Shiva to be associated with creation (epitomized by the Unga, or phallus). 1 These results are dedicated to Vasudeva Poduval and to P. Joseph John, a constant companion and enthusiastic worker during my stay in Kerala. It was primarily due to the efforts of Vasudeva Poduval, my guru and friend, that I was able to visit Hindu temples in Kerala. This gentleman was once the Director of the Archaeology Department, Travancore State. He was later a member of the Travancore Devaswom (Hindu Temple Trust) Board at Trivandrum, the capital of both Travancore and Kerala states. Following custom, I entered each temple as a barefooted pilgrim wearing a dhoti (cloth length wound around the waist) and no shirt - and, thus, also paid homage to the region of my birth and childhood. I am extremely grateful to Govindakutty Menon, Cochin Devaswom Commissioner, who facilitated expeditious visits to the main temples of the region once in Cochin State. To K. Narayana Pillai, Travancore Devaswom Commissioner, thanks are due for per- mission to enter specified temples supported by that board. To the Secretary to Govern- ment, Government of Kerala, who directed the Malabar Devaswom Board to render all possible assistance during my visits to Hindu temples in that region, thanks are also due.</page><page sequence="3">Kerala Style Hindu Temples 3 AFGHANISTAN Í^TX ^ S0UTH ASlA ■lk/u.n.¡p¿r TEMPLE SITES /-■'"' J P^Q^-^ PEOPLES' REPUBLIC V"-~ '■' ÈpSf^/f ( ( V'Ss'°F CHINA -^ - _ ^ ,.

If creation be considered in the universal context, the entire gamut of universal processes are controlled by the central essence (equated with Brahma). If there be but one god related to our earth, then this supreme deity is at the core of all earth-related processes. If there are gods who are facets of the godhead, in them all earth-related processes are centered. If there are separate deities, each a deity in his or her own right, the same holds true. If men think of nirvana, they may think in terms of oneness with creation,</page><page sequence="4">4 William A. Noble Anthropos 76. 1981 oneness with god, oneness with the gods, oneness with a blissful state, or perhaps a oneness with all of these combined (creation = god = gods = the blissful state). All are at the center of the pilgrim's quest. If we conceptualize in terms of each human being, existence is centered on creation, or god, or the gods, or nirvana. To grapple with any of these, man may inwardly meditate toward the core. We now turn to specific examples demonstrating responses to the basic guiding principle in South Asian temple architecture and organization. In Pakistan, northwestward from the new capital of Islamabad (Map 2), there are three Buddhist archaeological sites in which the response is dramatic. At Shah-Dheri, Taxila (Fig. 1A), the Buddhist temple constructed about 2000 years ago has a stupa centered in a courtyard (Cunningham 1875 : pl. 20 ; Fergusson, Burgess, and Spiers 1967/1 : 87). A series of vihars (monks' shelters) surround this courtyard. The focal point was the stupa at the center of the temple. Stupa cores originally held the Buddha's relics and later stupas with- out relics still correspondingly honored the Buddha. Monks and other wor- shipers at Shah-Dheri centered their worship on the revered core, related to the Buddha, he who revealed the eightfold path to nirvana as the ultimate reality. Man's focusing upon the ultimate reality, at the core of his temple, is also exhibited at the Buddhist temples of Jamal-Garhi and Takt-i-Bahi (Fig. IB and C). Because the Shah-Dheri temple was developed by Hinayana Buddhists, meditating monks who used the surrounding cells were able to focus upon what the central stupa stood for. Praying monks also circumambu- lated around the stupa. As it was Mahay ana Buddhists who later constructed the Jamal-Garhi and Takt-i-Bahi (or Bahai) temples, the surrounding cells were used to house subsidiary miniature stupas or Buddha images (Cunning- ham 1875: pls. 8, 15; Brown 1956: 41, 42, and pl. 33). These served to rein- force the most vital teachings related to each central stupa. The Jainas later developed this architectural and philosophical trend to its maximum degree. Jaina subsidiary images, repeated time and time again, help to retain the focus upon the particular Jina (or Tirthinkara) honored in the central structure. All out of a total of 24 Jinas revealed ways to reach nirvana. Mahavira, the last Jina who dwelt among men, lived at the same time as the Buddha. It is, therefore, not unusual that stupas were also related to early Jaina temples (Ghosh 1974/1 : 52-57, pl. 1-3). However, it is in western Indian Nagara (first related to the Caulukya or Solanki dynasty) temples of a later date that we find our clearest evidence for the Jainas following the basic guiding principle. The ideal temple type (Dhaky 1975 : 323-325) has these features: There is an upraised rectangular base (jagati). Access to the upper surface of this is made by a stairway centrally located at a shorter end (usually facing east). After surmounting the steps, a person walks into an entry hall (balanaka). The most sacred structure (mulaprasada) is centered on the base. Within this is the inner sanctum (garbhagriha or garbha) which houses the image of the Jina honored by the temple. Between the most sacred structure and the entry hall, in the same axis, there first is a walled hall (gudhamandapa) , then a pillared vestibule (mukhamandapa or trika), and a colonnaded hall (rangamandapa or nrtyamandapa) follows. From the front wall</page><page sequence="5">Kerala Style Hindu Temples 5 Shah-Dheri (TAXILA) About 1st cent. b.c. ^TTXTTT^ ■ Stupa ^^ A rtTTTTTTt ^^pn^ TAKT-I-BAHI .d'j*--**^wy^ About 2nd Cent* AD' ist c*nt. «.o. L i h i^^nn^^^^^n^^^^ Figure 1 of the entry hall, walls backing a series of cells jointly form a continuous wall around the top edge of the temple base. The cells (devakulikas), which face inward and almost surround the courtyard, hold similar or identical images of the Jinas. Fronting the cells is a cloister (bhramantika or pattasalika) running next to the courtyard, and it may extend from one side of the colonnaded hall to its opposite side. Moslems destroyed many Jaina temples, so the record for centuries is lost. The oldest extant temple of the type is the Vimala (a. d. 1032) temple at Mount Abu, in Rajasthan. In the same location and forming the Dilwada group, there are the Tejahpala (a. d. 1231) and Pittalhara (a. d. 1300s) temples (Volwahsen 1969: 134; Ghosh 1974/2: 301, 305, 362). AU three are representative jewels. The Neminatha temple (earlier A.D. 1200s?) at Girnar, in Gujarat, is another early example (Fergusson, Burgess, and Spiers</page><page sequence="6">6 William A. Noble Anthropos 76. 1981 1967/2: 32-33). Seth Hathisingh's temple (a. d. 1816) at Ahmedabad, in Gu- jarat, demonstrates a nearly eight century tradition in Jaina temple archi- tecture (Fergusson, Burgess, and Spiers 1967/2: 64-66). In another less common Jaina temple type, the central most sacred structure (catur [or cau] mukha mulaprasada) is squared and open sided. The quadruple image of the Jina honored can thus be seen when facing inward at each side. The upraised temple base is also squared, and there are four centrally located entranceways at each side. There are additions to features present in the simple temple type. Centrality is even more accentuated by featured rising in the vertical dimension to the climax of the tower (sikhara) above the central structure. The Adinatha or Rishaba temple (a. d. 1439) at Ranakpur or Ranpur, in Rajasthan, is the most perfect example of the type (Brown 1956: 165, pl. 123). The Hindu response to the basic guiding principle was probably as ancient as that among Buddhists and Jainas. It is in the Temple of the Sun (a. d. 700) at Martand, Kashmir, that we have an early example of a Hindu temple with outer wall and a cellular peristyle facing the courtyard (Brown 1956: 191-192, pl. 136). The most sacred structure is centered in the back portion of the courtyard (Rowland 1953:119). This has a pyramidal roof over squared walls with massive trefoil arches (note some parallel with the Jaina caturmukha mulaprasada). Within is a single inner sanctum with one entrance. The Avantisvami temple (a. d. 800s) at Avantipur in Kashmir is basically similar, with a 69 cells peristyle facing onto the courtyard (Brown 1956: 193-194, pl. 138). At a later date (a. d. 1268) and far to the south, a similar ground plan was used in the construction of the Keshava temple at Somnathpur, Karnataka (Volwahsen 1969:108, 133, 148-150; Brown 1956: pl. 125). Here, again, is a large entrance. Sixty-four cells face onto the court- yard, their backs forming the outer wall. A cloister runs in front of them. Centered in the courtyard is the main temple. This has three inner sanctums (garbhagrihas), one at the back and one to each side of the central hall. Each is related to an incarnation of Vishnu - Janardana, Krishna, and Keshava (at back). Eastward, at Kanchipuram (Conjeeveram), the ancient Paliava capital in Tamil Nadu, we have in the Kailasanatha temple an early example (ca. a. D. 700) of a Hindu temple with sanctuary centered in a courtyard about which there are cells before the enclosing wall (Brown 1956: 99-100, pl. 63; Fergusson, Burgess, and Spiers 1967/1:357-359). Also in Tamil Nadu, the magnificant temple at Tanjore was completed (ca. a. d. 1000) during the later Chola dynasty. A sanctuary dedicated to Shiva as Brihadevara is centered in the back portion of a large rectangular courtyard (Volwahsen 1969: 87). The tallest pyramidal vimana in India (close to 58 m high) rises above the sanctuary (Brown 1956: 103-104). A typical Tamilian gopura (constructed in the a. d. 1000s) rises above the single entrance. A cloister runs next to the courtyard. Behind it, and next to the enclosure wall, there are some separated cells with idols. Series of aligned lingas are arrayed between the cells, and they are associated with the renowned "Hall of One Thousand Lingas." In the Tanjore central sanctuary dedicated to Shiva and in the many lingas behind the court-</page><page sequence="7">Kerala Style Hindu Temples 7 yard we find, therefore, a distinctive Hindu parallel with the Mahayana Bud- dhist and Jaina systems of reinforcement. The great Paharpur temple (late A. D. 700s), constructed by Palas in the Rajshahi District of Bangla Desh, was originally a Hindu structure which paralleled the Jaina caturmukha mulaprasada temple. The courtyard was close to 250 meters square, and it was surrounded by 175 cells next to the enclosing wall (Rowland 1953: 153-155). Centrality was stressed in a manner rare to South Asia. The sanctuary centered in the courtyard, exceeding 30 meters in height, had arms shaped like a Maltese cross (about 110 m x 97 m). A presumed central sikhara rose above three tiered terraces. The squared core, with sikhara above, held a precious sacred object (related to Krishna?). To each side of it, within arms of the cross, there were four cells containing images (Brown 1956: 182, pl. 153). As this is the earliest known center of Krishna worship in eastern South Asia, each of these cells may have contained an image related to Vishnu. Buddhists later appropriated the site. It is noteworthy that the architecture and organization here may have provided the inspiration for such Southeast Asian structures as Borabadur in Java and Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The basic guiding principle related to divinity or path to nirvana at the core tended in Southeast Asia to be translated into a centered Mount Meru, the Abode of the Gods. It is my contention that a) the basic guiding principle has been strongly adhered to in the Hindu temples of Kerala (Map 3), and that b) it is in this part of India that one finds the whole conceptualization continued in its most basic form. A consideration of these temples requires the definition of the spe- cific temple components which are joined in varying wholes of increasing com- plexity. Then the spectrum from simplest to most complex temples will be analyzed. 2. Hindu Temple Components, Kerala To facilitate reference, the components are arranged in alphabetical order. 2.1 Anakottil The anakottil is an elephant shelter (PL la) sometimes used to house caparisoned elephants during ceremonials. Most of the time, however, it offers pilgrims shelter from the sun or rain. The structure has a rectilinear, crossed, or T-shaped base, and the roof is supported by a series of tall pillars. It is typically centered and placed at some distance from the front entrance to the temple (PL Id). 2.2 Belikkal The belikkal is a type of altar erected before a temple's main entrance (PL 16), but some front other entrances as well. Most belikkals are square- based structures standing in the open and ranging in height from about forty centimeters to three meters (PL 1/). Each is sculptured on the four sides. There is typically a flat, round, and somewhat raised portion on each top. When</page><page sequence="8">8 William A. Noble Anthropos 76. 1981 |MANGALORt KERALA '%' TEMPLE t°dhür?

Worshipers seldom place offerings. A bdïkkal thus mainly services as an embellishment. A belikkalpura is the room attached to the front of the temple (Pl.lc) . A belik- kal is often centrally positioned within the room. There are some specially de- signed belikkalpuras, however, in which the belikkal is centered in the open front.</page><page sequence="9">Kerala Style Hindu Temples 9 2.3 Dwarjasthambha A dwarjasthambha is the flagpole proudly raised to the sky (PL le), in alignment with and before the belikkal, or between a belikkal and anakottil. It is traditionally constructed with a single teak pole, considered to be living. If is such a pole to be destroyed, it should ritually be cremated - with honor akin to that bestowed upon deceased humans. The flagpole is set into the ground and a squared stone base above the surface. The stone base is usually capped with a bronze cover, and bronze is used in decorative devices within the zone where the flagpole meets the base. There may be a turtle bearer for the flag- pole. The inverted lotus and normal lotus rising motif is frequently used. A snake motif (with single- or triple-headed cobra) may be included. Next to the bottom of the flagpole's first sleeve there may be a series of images on an encircling flat base (PI. lg). The whole flagpole base is often surrounded by a protective squared fence made of latticed wood. Most of the flagpole is sheathed with copper sleaves (para) alternated with copper ribs (vendayam). At the top there are culminating bronze decorative devices. A squared portion extends outward, above which there may be a surmounting image. This is typically the vehicle related to the deity which the temple honors. A nandi (bull), for example, will face toward the inner sanctum where Shiva is believed to be. A short rod, decorated in bronze, extends outward from the lowest decorative device (usually the aforementioned lotus motif). This rod is anchored, at the middle, to one side of the extended square. A god flag is hung from the rod during an ultsava (great festival honoring the deity or deities). The flag is of anthropomorphic design, with four portions of the cloth cut out like limbs. Seen from a distance, such a flag flapped by the wind is reminiscent of a walking or running human (PI. lh). The intent of the whole flagpole com- plex is to proclaim to all that here is a microcosm where man may grapple with ultimate reality and find some measure of nirvana (quiescence) so different from the shakti (movement) related to one's daily preservation and self-realization. 2.4 Gopura The gopura of Kerala serves as a grand entrance structure centered on one side of a wall surrounding temple grounds (PI. 2a). Because few temple com- plexes are so large, gopuras are uncommon. There may be only one front gopura, or an additional gopura on each side as well, but in the completely developed complex a gopura is centered in each of the four sides. The practice in Tamil Nadu to the east is thus followed, but Kerala gopuras are very dif- ferent from the tall and rather even-sided, upward tapering multi-entranced gopuras in Tamil Nadu. There also is no counterpart in Kerala to the many rows of sculptured images which are commonplace on the sides of Tamil Nadu gopuras. What is most characteristic of the Kerala style gopuras is the hipped roof with semi-side-gabled extensions (PI. 2b). A rare type of gopura, existing at Nagerkovil (farther south, in Tamil Nadu, but once within the former Travancore State), has a tall entrance and a single upper structure with grilled wooden sides extending outward and upward to the typical roof (PI. 2c).</page><page sequence="10">10 William A. Noble Anthropos 76. 1981 The prevalent type of gopura has one or two hipped roofs below the cul- minating roof, and each roof down extends farther out from vertical walls farther out. The largest gopuras have similarly roofed projections to the back or front, or back and front. The resulting T-shaped or crossed ground plan has longer sides. The imposing front gopura at Chengannur is unusual in that two lower floors with identical outer dimensions are covered by one roof; then the next smaller floor is covered by the surmounting roof (PL 2d). A gopura typically has a roof for each floor. Because elephants must pass through, a gopura's entranceway is necessarily large - and the corresponding vertical dimension of the first floor is high. Each floor upward decreases in both its horizontal and vertical dimensions. This is a basic architectural principal which has also governed the construction of Tamil Nadu gopuras for centuries. 2.5 Kavu The kavu is a sacred grove most frequently located in the northwest sector of a temple ground enclosed by a wall. The grove is characteristically composed of indigenous trees and is often a forest remnant. Single sacred banyan {Ficus bengalensis L.) and pipai (Ficus religiosa L.) trees are also present on many temple grounds. Kavus and sacred trees cater to a Hindu respect for the snake deities and snakes - especially cobras. The cobra fre- quently enters into Hindu art and mythology (the painted blue-throated Shiva with cobra, for example). It symbolizes time's passage and is a fertility emblem in Kerala. Within kavus and at sacred trees there are naga (cobra) - deity images in stone or brass (PL 2e). These are usually located on a circular or squared platform either surrounding or to one side of a tree. Any cobra posing a threat to a person might be carefully removed to a wilder place. 2.6 Koothambalam A koothambalam is literally a temple (ambalam) in which koothu is per- formed. This encompasses the performance of dramas and the reading of sacred scriptures (pur anas, for example). Kathakali, the well-known dance drama of Kerala, is not performed in a koothambalam - and is always conducted apart from a regular temple. Because of high construction costs, only a few temples have koothambalams. Koothambalams generally have rectangular bases, but at Chengannur the ovoid base of an extremely rare type of kooth- ambalam still stands. Their hipped roofs rise to a short crest (PL 2/ and g). The roof may be covered with Mangalore tiles (invented in that place by Basel missionaries) or with copper tiles (probably invented after Westerners came to India). Kerala's copper roofing is unique enough to set this state apart from the rest of India. On the crest there are usually brass decorative devices (likely to be three thazhikakudams). Copper cobra heads may rise from each bottom corner. The sides in a koothambalam might be open, or there may instead be an enclosing wooden grille rising vertically or slanting outward and up. Interior supporting posts are skillfully placed so that views toward the stage are the least obstructed. Constructional techniques also contribute</page><page sequence="11">Kerala Style Hindu Temples 11 to subtle shadowing, so that no noticeable shadow from any object appears. Koothambalams are typically placed to the front left of the temple entrance, but at Angadipuram there is one exception located to the right front. 2.7 Mandapa The basic mandapa has a square base, varied combinations of roof supporting pillars, and a pyramidal roof (PL 2h). There are no steps up to the base, but persons can usually climb onto the mandapa without difficulty. The roof is covered with clay or copper tiles; a decoration (thazhikakudam) often rises above the peak, and rearing cobra heads may be emplaced at each corner. Some mandapas have wooden carvings. A popular theme is the navagraha (nine elements) sculptured into a square panel centered in the inner roof (PL 3a). On all four interior and adjacent sides there may be sculptured panels. Geometric patterns and themes from the Ramayana are the most common subjects (PL 36). A few mandapas have brightly colored designs painted onto wood (e. g., Krishna temple, Trichambaram). A mandapa is centered in the central courtyard, before the entrance to the srikovil. The base may be used for meditational ritual or reading by particularly devout worshipers, but most worshipers stand and pray between the mandapa and srikovil. All who worship face toward the lighted image of the deity within the srikovil. Variations in mandapas might include centered steps, enclosing wooden grille (e. g., Irinjalakudu), emplacement of objects on base (e. g., stone nandi)y and surmounting copper cobra heads (e. g., eight in a square at Tripparrappu, now in Tamil Nadu). Perhaps the most exceptional mandapa in Kerala is the beautiful round-based example at the Perumanam Erattayappan Siva temple. The mandapa standing as a separate entity is an interesting and diag- nostic feature of the Kerala style Hindu temples. In Tamil Nadu to the east, a separate mandapa formed part of the Shore temple at Mamallapuram (very late a. D. 600s). The archaeological evidence indicates that the Paliavas first used dressed stone in this complex (Brown 1956: 98-100, 102, pls. 63, 64, and 66). At the Kailasanatha temple completed slightly later (earliest years a. d. 700s) at Kanchiparam, a separate mandapa was also constructed - and it was probably not until the a. d. 1300s that a hall connecting it with the main sanctuary was built. By the time of the Cholas (ca. a. d. 900), mandapas were being attached to sanctuaries. Excepting in Kerala, this eventually became the standard practice in India. 2.8 Nalambalam A nalambalam is basically a divided passage which either encloses or partially encloses the two sides and back of a courtyard (PL 3c). A part of it may occasionally be double-floored. In positioning, a nalambalam parallels the earlier discussed Buddhist, Jaina, and Hindu features about a courtyard. To the left side of the front entrance there is typically a walled kitchen (tha- dapali) in which the deity's food (prasadam) is cooked. The well to the right may be within the nalambalam, or there may be a room with provision for</page><page sequence="12">12 William A. Noble Anthropos 76. 1981 storing water drawn from a well just outside. Water is an essential ingredient in ritual performed by any attendant Brahman priest. A walled and locked store for food and other supplies is typically located to the right. At large temples, ornaments used to bedeck elephants and their riders at festivals must later be carefully sorted and stored in a portion of the nalambalam. As one or more idols may be set up in a nalambalam, the functions of worship before them become a part of ongoing activities. The periodic feeding of Brahmans, more important in the past, would require a lot of space. It is in the nalambalam, too, that priests and those they permit to stay will chat, sleep, read the scriptures, or sing sacred songs of praise. 2.9 Srikovil A srikovil is a crowning jewel of any temple, for within - according to belief - resides a deity upon whom the devout focus their attention. Most srikovils are centered in the courtyard located in a temple's center. A srikovil is actually a microcosm unto itself. In the example used, the image of God Yudhishthira (not shown) is vertically located directly below the peak and is horizontally located in the exact middle of the srikovil (Fig. 2). From outside the worshiper may focus his or her gaze upon the deity's lighted image shining forth from the darkness within the garbhagriha (literally "womb house"). It is hard to imagine a more perfect architectural and organizational response to the basic guiding principle. The srikovil aids in the expression of belief related to the individual, the world, and the universe. As Hinduism is a religion in which more than one deity can be honored, it follows that in some larger Kerala temples there will be more than one srikovil (equidistantly spaced) within the central courtyard. In the largest temples, there are actually srikovils in the outer temple grounds - in addition to several srikovils within the central courtyard. In such examples, the crown- ing jewels related to different deities are placed within a cosmos extending to the outer temple walls. The srikovils thus become microcosms within a cosmos. Many srikovils are of the simplest design and are either round-based with a single conical roof or square-based with a single pyramidal roof. The wide- spread and typical round srikovils make Kerala unique. Sacred round structures, whether attached to a squared addition or not, are rare elsewhere in India and may be on archaeological sites. Most garbhagrihas, forming the wombs of srikovils, are squared in Kerala. Some circular srikovils, however, have round garbhagrihas - but garbhagrihas externally round are often squared on the inside (Sarkar 1971:273-275). The completely round or outside round and inside square garbhagrihas are also unique to Kerala. In the simple round or square srikovils, the inside garbhagriha often has its own roof (Fig. 3 and PL 3d), 2 The entire garbhagriha is constructed with stone, bricks, and/or latérite blocks. The exposed roof above will then have wooden rafters, framing, and protective 2 The precise location of the deity's image in this srikovil, located near Kottavattam, is shown in the floor plan. The corbeling within the inner roof and post, lintel, and thresh- old doors have been fundamental traits of Hindu architecture for over a millennium.</page><page sequence="13">Kerala Style Hindu Temples 13 Figure 2 covering of clay or copper tiles. The prevalence of a roof over a roof in one srikovil also sets Kerala apart. Although there are fewer of them, three other types of srikovils have been constructed in Kerala. Srikovils which are rectangular-based usually have a large semi-gabled front extending over a bottom hipped portion. The three other sides of the roof are plainly hipped. The remarkable gajaprishta (elephant rump) style is similar but has a rounded back. The use of a rounded back approaching the gajaprishta style is found in the only two extant free- standing Buddhist chaitya halls made of brick. These are located far apart at Ter (a. d. 400s) in Maharashtra and Chezarla (a. d. 400s) in Andhra Pra- desh (Brown 1956: 50, pls. 12, 16, 17, 41, 46; Fergusson, Burgess, and Spiers</page><page sequence="14">14 William A. Noble Anthropos 76. 1981 Figure 3 1967/1: 126-128). An early Hindu temple built at Aihole (ca. a. d. 500), Kar- nataka, was inspired by the Buddhist chatty a hall and has a round back - but not of the gajaprishta style. Thus we find evidence for a form which was cast and continued for long in a uniquely Kerala vogue. A third unusual type of srikovil, with a squared base, has the central altar and deity's image entirely</page><page sequence="15">Kerala Style Hindu Temples 15 exposed to the sky (PL 3e). Manifestations of the goddess Kali (usually Bhad- rakali) and god Shiva (usually Shasta = Aiyappan) are related to such sri- kovils. It is noteworthy that srikovils of this type appear to never be fronted by mandapas. Thus, one gains the impression that they relate to an ancient pve-mandapa period in which was established the conceptualism of deity and nature being inseparable. With the exception of the last-mentioned type of srikovil, which always has but one gabled roof surrounding the central exposed square, it becomes possible to add a second roof to all the other types of srikovils by upwardly extending the walls of the garbhagriha (in the case of some round temples, corbeling enables the conversion of a square wall to a circular wall). A rectan- gular or gajaprishta style temple with two roofs will typically have the large semi-gabled front on the top roof, and the bottom roof will then be hipped (PI. 3/ and g). In some square, rectangular, and gajaprishta srikovils there is a front extension of the lower floor and roof. This usually has a large semi- gabled front. There are a few srikovils with three tiered roofs. The Perumanam Erattayappan (Siva) temple is square-based, with two hipped roofs, and a unique crowning octagonal roof with eight rounded semi-gables (PI. 3Ã and PI. 'a and b). The sister Madhur and Adhur (farther east) temples, in Malabar, are of the gajaprishta type with three tiered roofs (PL Ac). The top roof has a large front semi-gable; the two lower roofs have front extensions with large front semi-gables. The lower roof is complicated toward the front by side- extended gabled roofing demarcating entrances. In the ornamentation of srikovils one sees the finest expressions of Kerala art. Some have walls composed of carved wooden panels (Pis. Ad and 8d). There may also be windows with screens intricately carved out of wood (e. g., Tali- paramba). Wooden braces carved into figures of demons, gods, and humans may serve as a series of roof supports at one or more levels (Pis. Ae and 8b). In large front semi-gables, Kerala craftsmen have displayed detailed artistry in the carving of wooden supports, gable edgings, and vertical panel backings (examples, Madhur and the small gajaprishta srikovil in the Vadakkumnatha complex at Trichur). A similar feature, but rounded, may front the lower roof extension of a square-based srikovil (e.g., Karakuttom, near Trivandrum). On the top pyramidal roof of some square-based srikovils there are similar but smaller semi-gables centered in each side (examples, Rama and Laksh- mana srikovils at Tiruvillwamala). The exceptional Perumanam temple, already mentioned, has eight of these features. Hard rocks (typically Precambrian gneisses or rocks of the Charnockite Suite) are usually sculptured into distinctive levels forming the exterior base of each srikovil. The water spouts through which ritual water flows from the garbhagrihas are also fashioned in stone. Some have monster heads out of whose mouths the water falls. Sculptured hard rock may also be utilized in walls and in the construction of some roofs. Because many srikovil walls are built with latérite blocks which are easily fashioned, there are walls which are intricately sculptured. Such sculpturing is then covered with stucco, which - through its method of application - enhances the decorative designs (PL 4/ and PL 5a).</page><page sequence="16">16 William A. Noble Anthropos 76. 1981 At the end, the stucco surface is whitewashed over. Many srikovils have a straight set of stone entrance steps with the sculptured tongue of a monster running from top to bottom on each side (P1.5&amp;). There may be complimentary sculpturing as well (perhaps the rest of the monster, as in the Pinarayi temple near Tellicherry). A woman performing a pot dance is one theme developed in this context (PL 5c). One of the earliest temple remnants in Kerala, at Trivik- ramangalam (close toTrivandrum), has a variant double-stepped system (steps up from each side) fronted by monster tongues going out and down at each front side. Two panels contain Paliava (between a. d. 600 and 900) sculp- turing of dancing women and attendant figures (PL 5d, e, and/). Although it is basically a Dravidian practice which Malayalee Hindus are content to be without, there are a few Kerala style temples with either wooden or stone dwarapalas - anthropomorphic temple guardians - to each side of the srikovil entrance (PL 8c). In the beautificiation of selected srikovils, artists painted both the woo- den and stucco portions. Sculptured wooden panels (e. g., Irinjalakudu) and braces are painted with a bright spectrum of colors (PL If). On horizontal wooden supports attached to the bottoms of rafters extended beyond walls there may be colored geometric patterns. As culminate efforts, Mahabharata scenes were painted onto the stucco sides of the round srikovil at Thrikoditha- nam. Large panels depicting varied scenes of the Ramayana were painted onto the stucco sides of the forward extension to the Sri Rama srikovil, within the courtyard of the Vadakkumnatha temple complex at Trichur. Painted Ramayana characters are also nestled between the sculptured and stucco covered wall portions surrounding this srikovil. Some of the latter are decorated with brightly colored geometric designs. Both the Tali temple at Kozhikode (PL 8a) and Thirunakarra temple at Kottayam demonstrate the height of achievement in decoration combining painting with stucco work over sculp- tured latérite. Some srikovils are roofed with clay tiles, but many are covered with copper tiles which add much to aesthetic appeal. Many srikovils are also surmounted by brass or bronze decorative devices (thazhikakudams) and, as in mandapas, rearing copper cobra heads at four corners are not uncommon. The summit may even be encircled with a special copper base to which copper cobra heads are affixed (PL 7g). 2.10 Valiambalam A valiambalam is the front enclosed section which one passes through before entering a temple's interior courtyard (PL 6a). In doing this a person is liable to pass through a passage with higher floor areas to each side. If there is a bilikkalpura, it will be passed through before the valiambalam is reached. Most valiambalams are single-floored, but some are double-floored - and may even have a portion of the second floor extended to the front, over the bilik- kalpura. Although valiambalam roofs may be simply hipped (PL 6d), there is a strong tendency to construct a semi-gabled extension to each side - and to the front as well, if there is a protruded front roof (PL 6c).

Valiambalams are covered with either clay or copper tiles. They are more freely used by temple visitors than nalambalams. People sit and rest in a valiambalam before worshiping and returning home. It is thus an ideal place for people to meet one another. If no koothambalam is present, a valiambalam will be used for koothu performances. In this section of the temple there might also be an idol requiring worship ritual each day. 2.11 Vilakku A vilakku is a lamp. Kerala is noteworthy for both its large number and distinctive types of lamps. Because lamps are so widely and frequently utilized in homes and temples, Kerala has been called the "Land of Lamps." A deity's image within a srikovil should always be illuminated by oil-burning lamps, never by electric bulbs. Only an officiating priest may enter a srikovil, and he will use a hand-held lamp during the performance of ritual before the image. A point also worth noting is that illumination from an electric bulb in any part of a temple's precincts is a vulgarity and a departure from the traditional which should not exist. The separate stambha vilakkus embellishing Hindu temples have a cen- tral vertical shaft (usually less than three meters high, but can exceed seven meters) and surrounding round oil containers (PI. 6/). These may be the same size from top to bottom, or they may become larger downward - and thus convey a pyramidal effect. A unique variant (PL 3e) has a top which is ob- viously a miniaturized replica of the pyramidal roof with four rounded and centered semi-gables capping some square srikovils. Stambha vilakkus may be sculptured in stone, or cast in brass or bronze. The rectangular base upon which a metal lamp stands is covered by similar metal, and there may be a cast turtle bearing the lamp (e. g., Haripad). As in the case of the dwarjast- hambha, also, a lamp may be surmounted by the vehicle related to a temple's deity (e. g., stylized peacock at a Subrahmanian temple). Stambha vilakkus are usually aligned before belikkals, or belikkalpuras, or anakottils (PL 6e). A climactic effect achieved through lamps is provided by vilakkumatams. These features have wooden frames on which are arrayed small metal lamps in series of five to nine rows (PL lb and c). There are basically three types of vilakkumatams in which 1) the wooden frame is attached to surrounding temple walls protected by roofs covering rooms (PL 6c), 2) the wooden frame stands apart and is protected by its own roof (PL 3e), and 3) the separate wooden frame is backed by a solid brick, stone, or latérite wall, and both wall and frame are covered by their own roof (PL 3A). In the third type, the wall will form an enclosure wall. This type, for example, surrounds some of the unusual srikovils with central square open to the sky. It may also be used in rectangular form to entirely surround a bilikkalpura, valiambalam, and nalambalam. The second type may be used in the same way. In contrast, the first type is usually directly attached to the outer walls of these structures, and a nalambalam will then surround the central courtyard on three sides. When the small brass Anthropos 76. 1981</page><page sequence="26">18 William A. Noble Anthropos 76. 1981 or bronze lamps attached to a vilakkumatam carry ignited wicks soaked in coconut oil, the twinkling of hundreds or even thousands of lamps at night is a magnificent spectacle (e. g., Haripad during an ultsava). An exceptional art treasure related to a vilakkumatam surrounds the Rama temple, within the Padmanabhapuram fort (established as his capital in a. d. 1744, by Martanda Varma, a famous Travancore ruler), now in Tamil Nadu. There is in the upper- most part of the vilakkumatam one continuous series of panels in which a depiction of the Ramayana story has been sculptured (PL 5g). 3. The Spectrum of Temples: Simple to Complex Upon visiting more and more Hindu temples in Kerala, one is struck by the element of predictability in their development. This does not mean that each temple site will not be unique in its own way, because some variation within a spectrum is desirable and always exists. The temple components just presented will now be used in varying combinations to demonstrate the creation of a spectrum ranging from the most simple, basic temple to the most highly developed temple complex. As lack of time and cultural restraints prevented the detailed plotting of more temple sites, some diagrammatic temple plans had to be utilized instead. The private Nambudri temple at Valiyamadom House, Kottavattam, has the most basic temple parts (Fig. 4). In the front there is a valiambalam with central passage and higher portions to each side. A wall surrounds much of the courtyard behind. There is a well to the right. The thadapali to the left serves for the cooking of prasadam, food for the goddess Bhadrakali. Note that the fireplace with three stones is representative of a common and most ancient type. A walk leads to the centered srikovil, which in this instance has an altar and image exposed to the sky (PL la). The inner roof's edge lies exactly above the altar's edge. The outer roof's edge extends beyond a walk surrounding the srikovil. The vilakkumatam has a wooden frame backed by a solid wall, and both support the aforementioned roof (gabled). Ashok (Saraca indica L.) trees often grow next to or on temple grounds in Kerala. The location of this one, in the courtyard itself, is unusual. The Kelamangalam Vishnu temple has the valiambalam followed by a walled courtyard (Fig. 4). 3 A water-yielding river is to the right. The store and thadapali are common features, but their location is unusual. A round srikovil with single conical roof is centered in the courtyard. Before it lies a separate square mandapa with pyramidal roof. As previously stated, this is one of the most diagnostic features of the Kerala style Hindu temple. Centered before the valiambalam is the belikkalpura, with a belikkal altar. 3 Raghavan Asari, who then worked for the Travancore Devaswom Board, gener- ously gave to me the plans for this and the Koduvila Mahadevar temples. Parts of the plan for the Koduvila Mahadevar temple were never implemented.</page><page sequence="27">Kerala Style Hindu Temples 19 Figure 4 The Koduvila Mahadevar temple has a centered srikovil (PI. 66) but no mandapa (Fig. 4). This is an indication of the non-essential nature of a mandapa (but, in any case, it is a feature which persists). There is a belikkcdpura with centered belikkal, and the two lie to the front of the valiambalam. The thadapali is to the left, store and well are to the right. Larger temples have nalambalatns which may or may not completely surround three sides of the interior courtyard (note that scales on the illus- trations continue to become smaller). In diagrammatic temple 1 there is a nalambalatn edging the courtyard on three sides (Fig. 5). In it are located a left side thadapali, a right side store through which there is access to a well, and two side passages leading into the courtyard. The centered srikovü with two tiered roofs is fronted by a mandapa. An outside belikkal and a dwajast- hatnbha are centered before the front entrance and passage leading through the valiambalam.</page><page sequence="28">20 William A. Noble Anthropos 76. 1981 Figure 5 In diagrammatic temple 2 the large square srikovil with two tiered roofs and a fronting mandapa are centered in the courtyard (Fig. 5). A valiambalam and nalambcdam surround the courtyard. The left side thadapali and right side well, well room, and store conform to the norm. A belikkalpura with belikkal altar is centered to the front of the valiambalam and a counterpart porch fronts the opposite nalambalam side. A vilakkumatam, attached to the outer walls, surrounds the porch, nalambalam, valiambalam, and belikkalpura. A dwajast- hambha is centered before the entrance to the belikkalpura. A sure indicator of a larger complex is the pradakshinavazhi - processional way - surrounding the temple. Most of these stone flagged walks are rectangular in shape. The anakottil centered to the front is another indicator of temple size. Because of the high cost of either renting or maintaining elephants for ceremonials, only the larger temples which are better endowed can support such use. The srikovil of diagrammatic temple 3 is of the gajaprishta type, and it has two tiered roofs (Fig. 6). Thè nalambalam does not go completely around the three sides. Instead, a rectangular vilakkumatam with wooden frame and its own roof completely surrounds the belikkalpura, valiambalam, and nalam- balam. The belikkalpura has a fully open front, and the belikkal altar is centered right at the front - where it is easily seen by worshipers approaching the tem- ple's single entrance. Other temple features lying within the enclosing pro- cessional way conform to the norm. The processional way is of an uncommon circular type. The anakottil is rectangular, and it also serves as a processional way leading from front entrance to the outer temple grounds. These are sur-</page><page sequence="29">Kerala Style Hindu Temples 21 Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 8</page><page sequence="30">22 William A. Noble Anthropos 76. 1981 rounded by a wall, and there are two gopuras dilineating two entranceways. The koothambalam is typically located on the temple grounds, to the outside left of the temple entrance. In the northwest quadrant there is a sacred kavu which conforms to the norm. The scattered sacred pipai trees have platforms about their bases, and on these are sacred objects. Diagrammatic temples 4 and 5 exhibit the developmental climax in Kerala (Figs. 7 and 8). Each has srikovils forming microcosms within a sacred cosmos separated by the outer walls from the secular, mundane world. Each cosmos is accessible through four gopuras. Simplicity still persists. Malayalee Hindus never took the next steps, the results of which are demonstrated by a few temples in adjacent Tamil Nadu. Examples are the Chidambaram, Mathurai, Rameswaram, Srirangam, Tiruvallur, and Tiruvannamalai temples (Brown 1956: 116-120, pls. 73-75; Rawlinson 1965: 184-185; Volwahsen 1969: 56). These very complex temples exhibit the manner in which enclosures were in turn enclosed, with corresponding multiplicity of gopuras (typically declin- ing in height with proximity to garbhagrihas) . They also possess pillared halls and colonnades of stone, the counterparts of which do not exist in the Kerala style Hindu temples. Neither in Kerala will one typically find the counterpart of the large pools so frequently constructed in Tamil Nadu temple complexes. Finally, massive walls with vertical red and white stripes - so indicative of many temple precincts in Tamil Nadu - are not a part of the norm in Kerala. Some diagrammatic temple 4 features (Fig. 7) are inspired by those in the great and beautiful Vadakkumnatha temple at Trichur, once a capital of Cochin. In overall achievement and ultimate complexity, I consider this to be the premier Kerala style Hindu temple. Diagrammatic temple 4 has gopuras with three tiered roofs to the west and south, and gopuras with two tiered roofs to the east and north. The temple grounds demonstrate the Hindu pro- vision for man to retain ties with animals and plants. These grounds are large enough to permit the presence of several kavus, each a wild life habitat. There are also scattered pipai trees and a banyan tree. Sacred objects are placed on the base platforms around the trees. There is no anakottil. The temple elephant is tethered in rotation at different places within the grounds. It reminds people of the wild elephants in forests nearly. In a land where tamed elephants aid man, an elephant's presence is appreciated. When taken to a park outside, the temple elephant gives pleasure to those who ride in turn on its back. Srikovils close to the rectangular processional way are easily accessible to worshipers. A square one has two tiered roofs, and there is a gajaprishta one with one roof. A third, dedicated to Krishna, has an abutting cattle shed. This srikovil and the cattle remind us that popular god Krishna was a Yaduvanshi, of the family of Yadavas - pastoral nomadic herders. The pastoral tradition has for millennia been honored and is strongly bound to Hinduism all over India. The koothambalam is emplaced where it should be (PL 76), but the mandapa fronting it is rare. Before each of the four entrances to the temple there is aligned a stambha vilakku and then a belikkal. The temple itself has a large valiambalam on the western side (a normal variant, with most temples facing toward the east). On the opposite side there</page><page sequence="31">Kerala Style Hindu Temples 23 is a counterpart structure. A nalambalam connects the two. Running around all is a vilakkumatam with wooden frame backed by a latente wall, both of which are covered by a roof. Centered in the large inner courtyard are three srikovils, each fronted by a mandapa. The largest round srikovil with single conical roof (PL 6g) has its western side dedicated to Shiva as Vadakkum- natha and eastern side dedicated to Parvati, Shiva's wife. The central round srikovil has two tiered roofs (PI. 7c) and is dedicated to Sankaranarayana. The remaining square srikovil (Pis. 4g, Id and e), dedicated to Rama, has two tiered roofs and a front extension with hipped roof. Each of the two srikovil roofs has copper cobras at the four corners, and rounded semi-gables are centered to each side of the top roof. Diagrammatic temple 5 (Fig. 8) serves to reveal some rare or further variant features. A few of these are at Changannur, another place to examine culminate features in the Kerala style Hindu temple. The large front gopura is inspired by the exceptionally large specimen at Chengannur, and here the other gopuras are smaller. A temple elephant is kept and, in contrast to the Vadakkumnatha temple, there are two anakottils. The base of an extremely rare koothambalam still stands at Chengannur. To better illustrate the spectrum of possibilities, features from elsewhere are included. Thus, in the inner court- yard there is a rectangular srikovil with two tiered roofs and a forward extension. The adjacent square srikovil with two tiered roofs is fronted by an extremely rare round mandapa (inspired by the one at Perumanam). A very small srikovil and fronting small mandapa lie close to the processional way. Conclusions When precepts of classification are used, the Hindu temples of Kerala are found to conform to a distinctive style. These temples are varied according to the combination of components. There are traditional principles, however, which govern the general manner in which the components are combined in a developmental spectrum from the most simple temple to the fully developed temple complex. Some similarities and variations between the Kerala style Hindu temples and Buddhist, Jaina, and Hindu temples elsewhere in South Asia have been identified. A widespread similarity results from men responding to a basic guiding principle, the principle of "centrality." Architectural and organiza- tional response to this principle has continued for over 2000 years. The response in Kerala is basic and consistent. This characteristic, combined with others, set the Kerala temples apart from those elsewhere in South Asia. The temples thus form a distinctive group.</page><page sequence="32">24 William A.
