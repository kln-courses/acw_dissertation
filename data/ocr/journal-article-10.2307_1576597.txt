<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Brief History of Japanese Robophilia Mark Gilson Abstract The author discusses the particular penchant towards robots exhibited by the Japanese and attempts to explain the origins of this phenomenon through an analysis of Japanese pop culture characters. There was a time when people believed that by 1998 the world would be overrun by robots, not unlike the classic 195os vision of the future wherein we all rode in flying cars to our cities in the skies, where our robot servants attended to our every need. In fact, the advancement of robots and robotics has been a rather quiet affair, outshined in recent years by cloned sheep and the like. In the age of the Internet, technology has become a provider of what is nowadays called content, and desktop computers are an important facet of mass media. The technological threat is gone, and with it the fear of the metal men. The word 'robot' has taken on a completely different meaning in the 1990S, and these days, everyone would rather have a node on the network than a robot butler. This is not a universal sentiment, however. One nation has slowly but surely been integrating robots into daily life, both in the open and behind the scenes. In contrast to the West, Japan has always exhibited a unique form of what can be described as robophilia. Japanese roboticist Ichiro Kato has enthusiastically stated that "Japanese robot technology will change the world" [1]. The roots of this robophilia are part of a larger philosophy in regard to technology that developed along with postwar Japan to make it the power it is today. In World War II, Japan experi- enced firsthand the devastating power of modern technology in the form of the atomic bomb. In postwar Japan, technology would become Japan's savior. The noted expert on Japanese cul- ture Karl Taro Greenfeld describes Tokyo as "a society in sym- biosis with the machine. Exactly where human beings end and machines begin can become confusing in a city that resembles more than any other city on the planet a neon-lit circuit board writ gigantic" [2]. Most people's imagery of robots comes from the world of fantasy. Ask some friends to draw their conception of a robot, and most will draw you the classic metal man, and not the industrial riveting arm from the Detroit auto factory. As of yet, our strongest images of robots are derived from these represen- tations. It should come as no surprise that with the birth of the Japanese comics industry in the 195os, the first hero it spawned was a robot. Mighty Atom [3] would later be known as Astroboy in the United States, while in Japan, his notoriety would gain his creator Osamu Tezuka the title of manga no kamisama; the god of comics. Atom's appeal lies in his humanity, even though he is a robot. In a way, his story is like that of Pinocchio, built to be a replacement for the son lost by his creator in a traffic accident. So right away, Japan's image of robots was a nurturing one. Atom was Japan's son. It's not unthinkable that many Japanese who lost sons to the war effort could relate very personally to the concept behind Atom. (As I write this, the verbal similarity in English between "Atom" and "Adam" also becomes appar- ent.) Tezuka was a medical student who originally intended for Atom to be a sort of parody, but he recalls that "publishers wanted me to stress a peaceful future, where Japanese science and technology were advanced, and nuclear power was used for peaceful purposes" [4]. Author Frederick Schodt, arguably the foremost expert on the topic of Japanese comics, notes that "over the years, Atom and robots became linked with a wonder- ful future that science and technology could provide" [5]. An important part of Atom's character development was his weaknesses. His powers were to some extent based on principles of hydraulics and electromagnetics.

As the father of Japanese comics, Tezuka set the trend that would be fol- lowed by many others. Tezuka's success was soon followed by the debut of Iron Man #28 [7], by artist Mitsuteru Yokoya- ma. Iron Man #28 occupies an interesting niche in the development of the Japanese fantasy robot. He was essentially a giant remote-controlled robot piloted by Shotaro Kinta against various nefarious types. Schodt makes the interesting obser- vation that "Atom and Iron Man are the ancestors of all subsequent Japanese fan- tasy robots, particularly two distinct gen- res seen today: truly autonomous robots and those that require human intervention for their operation" [8]. Could Iron Man #28 have influenced the Japanese pen- chant for gadgets? I wouldn't be sur- prised. It is also interesting to note that within the genres of comics and anima- tion, colossal super-robots such as Iron Man would soon become the norm. The next big robot icon to sweep Japan was Doraemon [9], created in 1970 by the team known as Fujiko Fujio. Doraemon is a robot cat sent from the future to watch over a boy named Nobi- ta. Doraemon worked on many subtle levels. Nobita is a classic slacker whose laziness winds up causing all sorts of trouble for his descendants. Doraemon was sent from the future to set him straight, as it were. The Japanese verb nobiru means to do things in a lackadaisi- cal manner. The past tense of this verb is nobita, the same as our protagonist's name. There is a distinct undercurrent visible in Doraemon: technology from the future comes back in time to ensure our hero's well-being- the idea of technolo- gy as savior. Another extremely important ingredi- ent of Doraemon's success was his char- acter design. He very well may have been the first character designed in a style that would come to be known in the genre as "super-deformed" or "SD." Doraemon has a perfectly round head disproportion- ately large in comparison to the rest of his small, soft-edged limbs and body. This is a formula that the Sanrio company would later turn into a literal merchandis- ing empire with the 1976 debut of the adorable iconic cat character Hello Kitty [lo]. The formula worked, and Doraemon is still an icon in Japan. It is interesting to consider how Dorae- mon's success came to be. He is called a robot cat but actually looks like neither robot nor cat- making him a universal, neutral icon. He has incredible powers, all based on technology from the future (most notably the doko de mo doa, a door- way that leads to anywhere you want to go). Whereas Atom is essentially a model superhuman, Doraemon is closer to a superpet, a cute bearer of the technologi- cal wonders of the future. In recent years, Japan (and later America) was swept with a fad known as the virtual pet. These small devices fall somewhere between a toy and a game and are about the size of a digital watch. Players "hatch" a sort of digital embryo (not unlike a tadpole) which they must then raise to adulthood and keep alive through functions such as cleaning, feeding, discipline, and play. The most famous of these virtual pets, the Bandai company's Tamagotchi (the name is a play on the Japanese tamago, meaning egg) was a phenomenal success and took many by surprise, so that sup- plies were quickly unable to meet demand. Looking at characters such as Doraemon, however, we can clearly see the roots of the Tamagotchi phe- nomenon. Japan has had an endearing attitude towards cute technological crea- tures for close to thirty years [11]. The 1970S also saw the birth of a completely new concept in fantasy robots pioneered by artists such as Go Nagai. Says Nagai, "I wanted to create some- thing different, and I thought it would be interesting to have a robot that you could drive, like a car" [12]. He did just that with the creation of Mazinger Z [13], a giant robot that was piloted by means of a small flying car and command center that docked inside the head. Nagai's cre- ations (most notably Mazinger Z) are today considered to be the classic Japanese super-robots. Rendered in bright primary colors, and styled somewhere between military equipment and samurai armor (to this day, almost all Japanese fantasy robots carry some kind of sword), Mazinger Z is an archetype for the fanta- sy robot. Nagai's creation subsequently touched on an issue that is still the sub- ject of research, the concept of the inter- face between robot and human. Schodt notes that Mazinger Z and its successors served to "solve an old problem in robot fiction, the problem of personifying the machine" [14]. Nagai's robots were successes in comic and later in animated form but went on to develop into a form that undoubtedly had a phenomenal impact on the youth of Japan: toys. With attributes such as fists that shot off and miniature ships that docked in the robots themselves, Nagai's creations translated perfectly into toys. In fact, at the request of toymakers, Nagai would later create Combattara [15], the first robot that was made of smaller com- ponent robots and the predecessor of all the transforming robot toys that swept through Japan and America in the 198os [16]. More importantly, Nagai's robots became not only heroes but playthings. A generation of Japanese children was liter- ally brought up playing with robots. The next development, and arguably the one with the most profound impact on the genre of Japanese fantasy robots, came in 1979 when Nippon Sunrise ani- mation aired "Mobile Suit Gundam" [17]. Gundam was the creation of Yoshiyuki Tomino, who took a radically different approach to the super-robot standard. Whereas in the "Mazinger Z" series the robot is the central focus of the story, Tomino placed his focus on characteriza- tion. As the name implies, the robots are in fact giant mobile suits of armor (like a humanoid tank), bearing only classifica- tions and not names. The focus was on the struggles between colonies in outer space. "Mobile Suit Gundam" was a war story, and it targeted the blurring of the lines between good and evil and the effects of war on the people who fight. Additionally, "Mobile Suit Gundam" takes place in deep space, allowing for fantastic epic battle scenes. Gundam's popularity and effect on robot ideology can not be stressed enough. The original show was a phe- nomenon in Japan, and spawned a fran- 368 Mark Gilson, A Brief History of Japanese Robophilia</page><page sequence="3">chise that is still going strong. What Star Wars is to American twentysomethings, Gundam is to Japanese of the same age, in popularity, impact on culture, and mer- chandising. It is considered one of the three greatest animated shows in Japanese history ("Space Cruiser Yamato" and "Neon Genesis Evangelion", the latter another program featuring robots, are the other two). In fact, Bandai, the company that owns the master license for Gundam merchandise, made so much money from it over the years that they actually pur- chased Nippon Sunrise animation outright and ensured that the Gundam franchise would continue for years to come. Today, Japan's robophilia has extended into multiple applications that technology has allowed for. There was the aforemen- tioned Tamagotchi craze, which, like transforming robots, was a hit in the United States. Then there are the new robots, telepresences like the virtual idol Kyoko Date [18]. Virtual idols have been a part of Japanese animation since at least 1986, which saw the introduction of the character of Eve in the original video ani- mation (OVA) Megagone 23, and Eve has since been followed by characters such as Sharon Apple from 1994's Macross Plus OVA. Curiously, both Eve and Sharon Apple's characters were idol singers, just like Kyoko Date. Modern young Japanese are growing up in an age in which cellular phones are considered a necessity and are surrounded with "tech-friendly" names such as Game Boy, DiscMan, and PlayStation. Even within the realm of consumer electronics, there is an almost anthropomorphic quality inherent in Japan's small, elegant gadgets. Looking at the history of Japanese fan- tasy robots, we can see where this sense of ease with technology has its roots. Robots were accepted in general as the tools to rebuild postwar Japan. Fantasy robots have served to represent technolo- gy in nearly every form in which it could present itself to Japan. Robots can be humanoid, like Atom, or a watchful superpet like Doraemon. Combattara and Mazinger Z represent components, expandability, and the user-machine inter- face. Gundam represents robots as weapons, and shows such as the popular "Evangelion" from 1996 have pushed the concept even further, as the robots from that particular series are hinted as having divine origins and are revealed to be bio- logically as well as mechanically derived. Where will the future concepts in robotics come from? Keep watching the cartoons. References and Notes 1. Frederick L.
