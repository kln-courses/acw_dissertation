<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bobcat Year . By Hope Ryden. (New York: The Viking Press, 1981. 211 pages, $15.95.) Nature writing as a literary genre has become increasingly popular as the public's environmental awareness has increased. Consequently, there have emerged a number of writers with the special combination of creative writing ability and scientific knowledge necessary for true nature writing. The combination of undistorted, unsentimentalized factual accuracy with vivid, evocative writing that creates an experience of nature in the imagina- tion of the reader makes special demands that not every writer can meet. Hope Ryden is one who has achieved that combination.</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 359 This is Ryden's seventh book about wild animals, three of those for children. Her others have dealt with wild horses, coyotes, and the Florida Key deer. She is an accomplished nature photographer as well as writer, and this book, like her others, presents a series of photographs to illustrate her text. This book, however, is different in approach. Her original plan had been to observe a captive bobcat family from the birth of a litter of kittens on through their growth and development. When her plans went irretriev- ably awry with the death of the litter, she was left with a variety of observa- tions of and experiences with bobcats in various parts of the West, but with no other unifying element than the species itself. Ryden solved her problems by writing a fictional narrative of a year in the lives of a population of bobcats in Idaho. Such an approach presents many dangers to the nature writer - anthropomorphism, sentimentality, excessive dramatization - but Ryden has avoided them all. Birth and sudden death, hunting and play, failure and success are all presented sim- ply as accepted elements in the life of a wild predator whose survival is always precarious. In such a presentation, she deals with behavioral patterns, including problem-solving techniques and motivation, but she carefully keeps these processes within the range of a bobcat's conscious awareness and instinctive response. She uses patterns she has actually observed in various contexts in various places, fitting them into her narrative framework in ways that seem acceptably probable. Ryden's style is clear, direct, and interesting without being overly dra- matic. Her sympathy for and interest in the wild animals of the West is clear without becoming sentimental. And her concern over the often unwit- ting human disturbance of the natural balances of western wildlands is made urgent without becoming apocalyptic. Hunters and trappers are the closest the book comes to villains, but their negative behavior is presented more as ignorance or heedlessness than as intentional evil. As we come to understand more fully the cyclical balances of natural systems - what Aldo Leopold presented metaphorically in his "Round River" myth - our traditional western hostility toward predators is being modified into an appreciation of their role in the scheme of things, and a respect for the effectiveness with which they play that role. Bobcat Year is a valuable contribution to that shift in attitude. It is a balanced, intelligent, interesting book that is well worth reading. PAUL T.
