<plain_text><page sequence="1">Iranian Studies, Volume Xi, 1978. Local Politics in Eastern Iran Under The Ghaznavids and Seljuks Richard W. Bulliet The political history of the Ghaznavid and Seljuk dynasties, which ruled much of Iran throughout the eleventh and twelfth centuries, is now fairly well known and recent- ly has been drawn together in the excellent narrative of Professor Bosworth in the Cambridge History of Iran. It is still quite imperfectly understood, however, and will prob- ably remain so for a good while yet to come. The old and serviceable schematization of the period based on the no- tion of a Sunni revival, keyed to the development of madrasa education and to the personality of Nizam al-Mulk, is still current despite increasing awkwardness in fitting the facts to it. It would be premature to attempt at this time an alternative schematization, and, indeed, such a schemati- zation, when it eventually appears, may well be not so much an alternative to the old one as an expansion in which the main features of the old one have a prominent place. It is not too soon, however, to start clearing the way for a new interpretation of this important period of Iranian history by illuminating some of the inadequacies of the old interpretation. In this paper, the particular empha- sis will be on reorienting the customary view of the power relationship between local and central or imperial politi- cal forces. Richard W. Bulliet is Associate Professor of History at Columbia University. 35</page><page sequence="2">The eleventh and twelfth centuries are customarily presented as a period in Iranian history when relatively uncivilized Turks from Central Asia conquered Iran and were, in turn, seduced and conquered by the great Iranian imperi- al tradition in its Islamic form. Calling themselves Sul- tan and even Shahanshah, the Ghaznavid and Seljuk rulers were autocrats with unchallenged--by anyone other than their own kin, that is--authority. They ruled large empires from a central court through a staff of able Persian administra- tors, embodying the ancient traditions of imperial Iranian rule. Furthermore, they were orthodox Sunni Muslims who fought to extend the domain of Islam in the East while gradually pushing back the heterodox Shicites in the West, who had encroached far on Sunni lands under the Fatimids and Buyids. The precise source of this view of the period would be hard to pin down, for it seems to be almost taken for granted in the primary sources from which the history of the period has been written. It may be presumed, however, that it corresponds fairly well to the view of the period that contemporary opinion molders at the courts in Ghazna and Isfahan either held themselves or wished others to hold. These men--sultans, nobles, administrators, and intellectu- als in residence--commissioned, wrote, and read the chroni- cles and secular literature of the period; and it would be naive to write history from these works without taking this clientele into account. Still, caution alone can do little to right a distorted viewpoint. An independent body of source material serving a different clientele is called for, and it is not obvious where it might come from. The contention of this essay is that such a body of source material does exist in the form of a local, urban historical tradition, but it must be admitted that there is an element of circularity in arguing thus. The differ- ent clientele posited for this independent historical tra- dition is the "patrician class," a restricted upper class, found in every Iranian city, made up of a small number of wealthy, interrelated families sharing an education in and concern for the further development of the Islamic reli- gious sciences. However, this group includes a large num- IRANIAN STUDIES 36</page><page sequence="3">ber of people holding appointments from the central govern- ment as qadis, khatlIbs, ra'l7s's, and so forth. Thus, it could be argued that the alleged separate clientele is actually only the local extension of the court clientele, and hence shares the same viewpoint. The best evidence that this is not the case comes from the form and content of the sources under considera- tion. The sources pertaining to the court milieu and cli- entele, from which the currently available histories of the period have largely been written, are either narrations of the deeds of the rulers in loose chronicle form, books proffering advice on the techniques of ruling, poetic eulo- gies, or potpourris of diverting information and anecdotes. The sources pertaining to the local, urban milieu and the patrician clientele are entirely different. Ignoring pure- ly religious works, two genres can be identified. One is the local biographical dictionary containing, in alpha- betical order, brief biographies of members of the local patriciate. The other is the local history containing similar information but arranged according to chronologi- cal periods and prominent families. The latter genre gives more space to the deeds of rulers than does the former, but neither affords very much. The focus is on the lives of locally prominent men and their families. Just as the court clientele read about themselves in the works proper to that milieu, the local patriciate read about itself in the works belonging to this local, urban historical tradi- tion. Even after identifying this local historical tradi- tion, however, it is no simple matter to reconstruct the history of the age from it. By its very nature broken up into the separate histories of many different cities, the tradition further suffers from the disappearance of many works over the years separating the twelfth century from our own. Ibn Funduq, for example, in the introduction to his history of Baihaq, lists in a special category some fifteen histories of Khurasanian cities, of which only two survive today. Moreover, such works as survive are dif- ficult to work with since they deal with many local per- sonalities about whom there is little corroborative in- 37 Vol. XI, 1978</page><page sequence="4">formation in other sources. Still, there are enough simi- larities between events in one city and events in others to indicate the general outline of local history, insofar as this history was common to Khurasanian cities in general. In the political field, the picture that emerges is of powerful nuclei of local political strength existing in a symbiotic relationship with the central, imperial power. From the local perspective, the central power is not the omnipotent authority suggested by the court literature. Rather, it is a paramount military and financial power whose patronage and support is useful in the quest for local political power, but which is equally, if not more, dependent on the support of the several local political powers for the maintenance of its position. Whereas local politicians deprived of imperial support could retire to their estates and wait for their political star to ascend once more, the Sultan deprived of the support of his forti- fied, tax-producing cities was in a much more parlous situ- ation. The absence in the court sources of much reference to this balance of power, and the resulting emphasis on the supreme power of the Sultan, is in large part ascrib- able to the emphasis on a religious dichotomy between the virtuous Sunnis and the nefarious Shicites. What is ob- scured by this misplaced emphasis is the fact that the real and meaningful religious quarrels under the Ghaznavids and early Seljuks were between various factions within the Sunni camp. The very bitterness of these intra-Sunni quar- rels may itself afford an explanation of the misplaced re- ligious emphasis of the court literature. The court could not allow local factionalism to flourish unchecked in its own precincts and may have exerted pressure to deemphasize it and sublimate it in a somewhat artificial emphasis on Sunni-Shicite rivalry. But whether this is the explana- tion or not, there is no question but that local religious- political factions of great importance are only dimly per- ceivable through court sources. The most complete statement of this situation in Khurasan and Transoxania is that of the great geographer IRANIA STUDIES 38</page><page sequence="5">al-Maqdisi, writing shortly before the coming to power of the Ghaznavids: In Khurasan there are Caqabiyat [factional quar- rels] between the western half of Nishapur in the northern part of the city called Manishak and the rest connected with Hira, wild Casabiyat not based on law schools. Only lately has it become between the Shica and the Karramiya. In Sistan there are Casabiyat between the Samakiya, who follow Abfu Han1fa, and the Sadaqiya, who are Shfic'ls. Blood is shed and power contested between them. In Sar- akhs it is between the cArusiya, who follow Abii Hanilfa, and the Ahliya, being partisans of ash- Shaficl. At Herat there are the cAmaliya and the Karramiya, at Marv the city people and the people of the old market. At Nisa there is Casabiya be- tween al-Khana and Ra's Siuq ["the head of the mar- ket"], at Ablvard between Kardarl and Ra's Balad ["the head of the city"]. At Balkh there are Casabiy3t irrespective of law school, and likewise in Samarqand and the rest of the cities, few of which are free from it. 1 The law schools of Khurasan are orthodox except that there are many Kharijites in Sistan and in Karakh and Astarbiyan, towns near Herat. In Nish- apur the MuCtazilis are apparent, but not dominant; and the Shicites and Karramis are clamorous. Over this entire area the followers of Abu Hanifa are dominant, except in the districts of Shash [Tash- kent], Ilaq, Ths, Nisa, Ablvard, Tardz, $anghdj, the countryside of Bukhara, Sinj, Dandanqan, Is- fara'in, and Juyan, all of which places are Shafil'. The administration in these places in according to their law school. They have a noisy clamor in Herat, Sistan, Sarakhs, and the two Marvs. There is no qadl who is not from one of the two factions. The khatibs of the places we have singled out and also of Nishapur are ShafiCis, as is one of the two congregational mosques at Marv, although the call 39 Vol. XI, 1978</page><page sequence="6">to prayer there and in Nishapur is double. The Karramiya make a racket in Herat and Gharj ash- Shar, and they have convents in Farghana, Khuttal and Ju-zjanan as well as Marv ar-Radh and Samar- qand.2 This maze of names and places is not terribly en- lightening without interpretation. What al-Maqdisi is saying is that on the eve of the Ghaznavid accession to power there existed in every city in Khurasan and Trans- oxania factions contesting for local power and struggling for control of key posts in the city. On occasion the ShiCites participate as a faction, but the dominant polar- ity is between the Hanafts and the Shaficis, two of the several "law schools" (madhhab) then accepted within Sunni Islam. The most recurrent third party is the Karramiya, a popular sect commonly accused of anthropomorphism and het- erodoxy. In addition, there are some places where the re- ligious affiliation, if any, of a faction is hidden beneath a neutral name, as well as places where a religious basis for factional fighting is specifically excluded. All that al-Maqdisi can report, of course, is what was immediately apparent to him as he passed briefly through these places and talked, perhaps, with local informants. Any suggestion of social forces underlying this urban un- rest cannot be expected to show up in his account, although the existence of some such underlying forces is strongly implied by his observations on religious cleavages in re- gions further west, where he found substantially less fac- tional violence. Elsewhere I have argued that factional development was rooted in differences in date of conversion to Islam with the descendants of early converts forming one faction and the descendants of later converts an opposing faction.3 Doctrinal positions, by this interpretation, could vary from place to place, but the underlying causes would remain the same. This assessment of the cause of factionalism does not fully explain, however, the peculiar intensity of violence that was reached in the cities of eastern Iran. IRANIAN STUDIES 40</page><page sequence="7">For this it may be necessary to look back upon the history of the area prior to the coming of Islam and the Arabs. Transoxania was neither a part of the Sassanian em- pire nor of any other contemporary empire. Its oasis cit- ies were ruled by local dynasties some of which, like the Bukhar Khudat of Bukhara, continued to be influential well into the Islamic period. Nor was the situation in Sassani- an Khurasan much different, despite the fact that it was a part of the empire. As a frontier area, it did not enjoy the stable, centralized government found in Fars or Iraq. Here, too, the titles of local city lords have been pre- served. Direct connections between this pre-Islamic situ- ation of localized power and that of Khurasanian and Trans- oxanian cities under the Ghaznavids and Seljuks are diffi- cult to trace, but such things as the astonishing prefer- ence for debased local coins over good silver caliphal coins in the Transoxanian cities4 strongly suggest that the sense of local autonomy and patriotic identification with a locale did not disappear from this area after the Arab conquest but continued for several centuries. Still, if the eastern Iranian tradition of independ- ent local powers helps explain the geographical concentra- tion of urban factional violence in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, it does not necessarily explain the violence it- self; for only rarely does conflict take an interurban rather than an intraurban form. At most, it emphasizes the fact that power was looked upon as something worth fighting for at a local level and not just at the imperial level. This would not be the case unless the cities felt them- selves to be independent and not merely population centers under the complete dominance of the imperial center. An analogy might be drawn to Italy under the Holy Roman Enpire. The parties of the Guelfs and the Ghibbelines were found competing throughout the empire, ostensibly for control of the empire. But in individual localities, these were sim- ply the names for local political forces competing for local power without too much regard for the imperial arena. The counterparts of the Guelfs and Ghibbelines under the Ghaznavids and Seljuks would be the Hanafi and Shafici law schools. They may not have been competing at all on an 41 Vol. XI, 1978</page><page sequence="8">imperial scale, but in almost every city they appear as competitors, concealing under.their rubrics various other social, religious, or political conflicts. At question here, however, is the relationship be- tween central power and local powers, not just the consti- tution of the local powers. Earl'ier, it was proposed that the two forces existed symbiotically. Since the nature of the sources and of the relationship itself militates against a general or comprehensive exposition of what is meant by symbiotic in this context, a number of illustrative cases will be presented instead in order to show at least the outlines of what is presumed here to have been a general phenomenon. First there are three incidents for which there is numismatic evidence. At the very beginning of the Ghazna- vid period, in the year 994, the Turkish general Sabuktakin and his son Mahmud, known to history as Mahmud of Ghazna, put down a rebellion against their Samanid overlord.5 They were rewarded for this service in several ways, Mahmud be- ing appointed governor of Nishapur in the place of the previous governor from the Slmjiirid family, who had been a leader of the rebellion. Once in office, Mahmud promptly dismissed local officials who had held office under the Slmjiirids, thus winning the support of the local party out of power. Since the Slmjfirids had been supporters of the Shafici law school, and in particular of the proponents of Ashcarite theology in that law school, Mahmud naturally found his allies among the Hanafis, in particular the Mu- ctazill-Hanafis, and the Karramis. This situation continued until 997, when both Sabuk- takin and his Samanid overlord died. Mahmud was in a touchy position. It was clear that he would have to take his army east in order to wrest succession rights from his brother, who also claimed them. Yet, at the same time, this would means abandoning Nishapur, a far richer and more important city than Ghazna, just at the moment when another succes- sion dispute in Bukhara was making his continuing governor- ship doubtful. Having no choice but to go off and fight his brother, he looked to the local political forces in IRANIAN STUDIES 42</page><page sequence="9">Nishapur to safeguard his position there. He did this by issuing a distinctive, large dirhem bearing a Qur'anic verse (III/17) which was recognized as supporting the Muctazili theology. Since coinage, along with the khutba, is recognized in Islam as an official indicator of political rule, and since the Qur'anic quotation on Islamic coins was almost invariable, the importance of this act cannot be mistook. It amounted to a promise on Mahmud's part that he would of- ficially support the Hanafl-MuctazilU faction on his return to power if that faction would apply itself to ensuring that return. The enemy he was obviously guarding against was the Slmj urid family, supporters of the Shafici-Ashcari faction, who were awaiting their opportunity to reclaim the governorship of the city. As it turned out, however, it was a Turkish general named Bektuzun who was appointed to the post by the new Samanid ruler; and since he had no support within the city, Mahmud had no trouble ousting him when he returned. Mahmud, however, was not the only ruler to make use of political-religious coin inscriptions to seek the alle- giance of local factions. In 1092 the third Seljuk sultan, Malikshah, died leaving the succession to the throne un- clear. His brother, Arslan Arghun, seized power in Khura- san and the Balkh area, but he did not enjoy the support of the cities of the area. Consequently, his hold on power was not very firm. His frustration at being locked out of the cities in the western parts of his territory prompted him to order the destruction of the fortifications at Nish- apur, Sabzavar, Marv, and Sarakhs. But in the eastern city of Balkh he tried another strategy to win local support and had issued in 1095 a coin with the famous "Throne Verse" of the Qur'an (II/256) as its inscription.6 Although the doctrinal interpretation of this verse at that time and place cannot be ascertain- ed, Arslan Arghun's action in choosing an aberrant coin legend is quite probably similar to that of Mahmud of Ghazna a century earlier. Possible confirmation of this interpretation is to be found in the issue of a coin with 43 Vol. XI, 1978</page><page sequence="10">the same inscription by Arslan Arghun's brother, Barkyaruq. The date and mint of this coin are obliterated, but since it came from the same horde as its mate, it may be assumed to have originated at roughly the same time and place. This means that it must have been issued at the time of Barkyaruq's Khurasanian expedition against his brother in 1096. It takes little imagination to see it as a bit of counterpropaganda directed at the same faction in Balkh that Arslan Arghun had been trying to woo. One other coin with this inscription was issued in Sarakhs by Muhammad b. Malikshah in 1116.7 Little informa- tion is available on the political situation inside Sarakhs, but Maqdisi's mention of strong factional division in that city and the fact that Muhammad's domain is usually thought of as being farther to the west suggests that he may have been trying to win local support in Sanjar's domain and thus encroach upon him. These examples of imperial rulers trading official recognition of religious positions for local support via coinage show only one aspect of the relationship between imperial and local power, however. While in most places the sultans had two or more factions in whose politics they could meddle, occasionally one local power would gain such supremacy that they became genuine city lords, like those of pre-Islamic days. The only difference is that their temporal power, rising from a welter of religious politics, had a religious veneer. The best example of this phenomenon is the dynasty known as the Al-i Burhan which ruled Bukhara from the late eleventh century until the early thirteenth.8 This family held the title of qadr, which was not an official title granted by the central power; but it also held the offices of ra'ls and khatl,b, which were. The fact that the rulers of the period dealt with these city lords on a basis of near equality shows, however, that these important offices were only nominally under the control of the central gov- ernment. IRMNIAN STUDIES 44</page><page sequence="11">Although the Al-i Burhan is the only successful dy- nasty of this sort thus far identified, it was not the only family to try to establish itself as city lords. The pa- triciate of Samarqand was particularly avid in seeking to preserve and extend the autonomy of the city against the Qarakhanids. After several earlier confrontations, in 1089 a Shaficite leader appealed to the Seljuk Sultan Malik- shah for support against the ruling Khan. With the active help of the citizens of the city and the apparent covert aid of a patrician helping to defend the citadel, Malik- shah took the city. The Khan was restored by the Seljuk some time later, but he was charged with heresy by the pa- tricians, tried before a religious court, found guilty, and strangled with a bow string in 1095. Barthold believes that "this event must be regarded as the greatest of the successes gained by the priesthood in alliance with the military classes over the government and the mass of citi- zens." Whether one agrees with Barthold's interpretation of the conflict as army and priesthood versus the government and the masses or not, one must concur with his identifica- tion of this event as the high point in a movement. Still, this need not have been the case had a power play by an- other patrician not misfired. The man was a descendant of CAli named Abu ar-Rida al-Athar al-Husaini al-Baghdadi, and what he attempted to do was precisely what the Burhan fam- ily succeeded in doing in Bukhara. He attempted to make himself the city lord of Samarqand. Although he is not mentioned in the court sources, his story is preserved in local biographical dictionaries of Nishapur and Samarqand. His father came from Baghdad and settled in Samarqand where he accumulated so much wealth in both real and movable property as to become the standard of comparison. Nevertheless, he was a diligent student of the traditions of the Prophet; and when he came to Nishapur, he was widely sought out as a teacher.10 Al-Athar himself may have been born in Samarqand, or he may have settled there with his father. He studied 45 Vol. XI, 1978</page><page sequence="12">some in Nishapur, probably at the time of his father's stay there. After his return to Samarqand according to his bio- graphy: He did not cease to raise and elevate his status until his rank reached that of king [malik]. He raised himself up against the Khan, and the demon of sovereign rule laid an egg in his head and hatched it. In his soul was a delusion of gran- deur which made it manifest that his soul would not be satisfied except by dominion [mulk]. I even heard that he ordered coins struck in his own name. He exercised the powers of government [lit., "he drew together and split apart"] until his time was ended and the measure of his days was filled. 11 Al-Athar was overthrown and executed in 1098, but more than that is not known, although he was in all prob- ability involved in the deposition and execution of Khan Ahmad in 1095 and in the taking of Samarqand in 1097 by the Seljuk Barkyaruq. It is interesting that parallel to this hostile biography, quoted from a biographical diction- ary of Nishapur, there is another, less complete, biography in a compilation from Samarqand in which al-Athar's exe- cution is referred to as a martyrdom.12 A similar episode took place in Herat in 1098.13 Sultan Bakyaruq put in charge of the city's defense and administration a group of officials who are reported by a hostile local chronicle to have been Shicites. In re- sponse, the local population revolted under the leadership of CAbd al-Hadi b. cAbd Allah al-Ansari, who was not only the son of the city's most famous religious figure but al- so held his father's position of Shaikh al-Islam, a non- governmental post similar to that of 5adr in Bukhara. The revolt, in which the city factions were deeply involved, was put down the following year, but here again the tend- ency toward urban independence under patrician leadership is clearly in evidence. IRANIAN STUDIES 46</page><page sequence="13">Perhaps other religious notables with ambitions to become city lords will be discovered, and perhaps more coins will be turned up bearing inscriptions alluding to imperial bids for local support; but these will always be simply the most graphic illustrations of a state of affairs which, in a less pronounced way, was exceedingly common. The central government never had firm control of the local factions. Patents of appointment issued for local posts, such as qadi, khatjb, and ra'ls, usually reflected not the choice of the central government but the choice, through election, heredity, or force, of the local factions, which choice they merely ratified. Sanj'ar's diploma investing Abu al-Barakat Muhammad as-Sacidi with the post of chief q5di of Nishapur,14 for example, makes it quite plain that that post was hereditary in the Sacidi family, which, in fact, is reputed to have produced no fewer than seventy q5dls.15 Another judge was called al-Qadi al-Mukhtar because he was elected to his post by the patriciate,16 apparently without even being a nominal appointee of the Sultan. In still another example, the office of khatlb was held at one point in Nishapur by a committee of the Hanafi faction among which it rotated.17 In short, the Sultan's government could do little but watch the bloody course of local politics and try to use it to their advantage whenever possible. This dilemma of the central government was particu- larly well recognized by the great vizier Nizam al-Mulk, as is shown by his own words. His remarks are contained in a letter he wrote in 1078 to Abu Ishaq ash-Shirazi, whom he had appointed to head the Niamiya madrasa in Baghdad. Writing on the subject of the disputes in that city be- tween the Hanbal is and the Ashcaris, he says: "There is no imperative either by the policy of the sultan or the judgment of equity to the effect that we should prefer in the matter of law schools one side rather than another."18 From this it is quite clear that Nizam al-Mulk realized the impossibility of being inflexibly partisan and inter- vening in the factional quarrels that wracked every city. 47 Vol. XI, 1978</page><page sequence="14">This point is further illustrated by an incident that took place during the reign of Sanjar. Sanjar was encamped near Nishapur when a riot broke out between the Hanafis and the Shaficis. After seventy deaths had been counted on the Hanaft side, he became incensed and decided that things had gone far enough. Accordingly, he ordered his chamberlain to ride into town and say to the ShaficI leader Abu Sacd Muhammad b. Yahya, the director of the Ni';miya: "Is this city yours or mine? If it's mine, get out! If it's yours, get ready to fight me for it!" The tactful chamberlain was not unaware of the broader political implications of what he was being asked to do, however; so in delivering the message, he so modi- fied it that it sounded very much like praise for Abu Sacd Muhammad. Then he rode back to the Sultan's camp where he discovered, as he had anticipated, that Sanjar had repent- ed his impolitic words uttered in anger. Needless to say, when he related to Sanjar the words he had actually spoken to the Shafici leader, the grateful Sultan showered him with new honors.19 As insuperable as this standoff between central and local power appears to have been, however, it would be wrong to assume that the central government did not look for ways of getting around it. During the period under consideration here, a workable solution was never found. The mere existence of a central authority with a superior army doubtless served in times of strength to prevent each city from going its own way entirely, but it could not pre- vent severe and recurrent intraurban, and occasionally in- terurban, rioting, or such things as the destruction of the city of Nishapur by its own factions in 1154, following the defeat of Sultan Sanjar by Ghuzz tribesmen and their sub- sequent sack of the city. Ravandi gives a graphic capsule account of this event, which demonstrates the heights that factional fighting could attain. After the Ghuzz had departed, there were among the people of the city old hatreds born of the differ- ence between the factions. Every night a faction IRANIAN STTUDIES 48</page><page sequence="15">from one quarter would assemble and would set fires in the quarter of their rivals until the ruins that remained from the Ghuzz became mere traces. Famine and cholera joined with the fac- tions so that whoever had escaped the sword and the rack necessarily died. A group of cAlids and the leaders of the rabble occupied the inner city [and] the fortress; and placing mangonels on the battlements, they gave refuge to the sur- viving remnant of the common people.20 Nishapur was subsequently rebuilt on a different site. The solution to the factional problem further west, where it was not so much tied to feelings of local autono- my, was worked out under the Mamliuks and the Ottomans and is outside the scope of the present discussion. But the attempts at a solution made under the Ghaznavids and Sel- juks are interesting as unsuccessful steps toward a genu- ine solution. One of these attempts has already been noted, namely the strictly local endorsement of one particular faction by means of the coinage of that particular mint. Yet this could not be applied in any general way because political situations in different cities would lead to inconsistent official endorsements. Another attempt that was made by Mahmud of Ghazna was an alliance with the lower class fac- tion, the Karramiya. 21 Sometime around 1010 he appointed the head of the Karrmlls in Nishapur to the office of ra 'Is. What he seems to have been trying to do is circumvent pa- trician politics altogether and find his supporters among a group that he had more hope of controlling. His plan miscarried, however, when his appointee initiated a witch hunt of alleged Shicis which got out of hand. Mahmud had to depose him and return the office to the patricians. Of more importance than these efforts, however, were two other attempts of a much broader and potentially more productive nature. These were devised by the two great viziers of the early Seljuks, cAmid al-Mulk al-Kun- duri and Nizam al-Mulk. 49 Vol. XI, 1978</page><page sequence="16">The policy of al-Kunduri had the advantage of sim- plicity. It consisted of officially condemning and anathe- matizing throughout Khurasan one of the two major factions. The one he chose, for rather involved reasons of personal politics, was the Sh&amp;fici-Ashcarl faction; but under dif- ferent circumstances he might just as well have chosen the Uanafis. There is no reason to believe that his choice was determined by the personal religious preference of Tughril Beg. Around 1048 he put his policy into effect by order- ing the condemnation of the AshCarns in the official Friday prayer and by barring them from all religious and educa- tional functions. In Nishapur, which is the only place in which the history of the persecution is known in detail, he followed this up several years later by ordering the arrest of the four leaders of the condemned fact'ion. One of the four, the famous Imam al-Haramain al-Juvaini, eluded cap- ture and joined a host of Khurasanian Ashcaris in exile. Another also escaped arrest and withdrew to his estates where he gathered a private force strong enough to free the remaining two from prison. Then these three also went into exile. Thus, in Nishapur the policy was fairly suc- cessful, and it probably was in lesser cities as well. Re- ligious offices that had been in dispute for decades now all fell to the Hanafis. A strong imperial hand had de- creed victory for one of the turbulent local factions and appeared willing and able to enforce its decree. Whether time would eventually have sanctioned and given permanence to al-Kunduri's autocratic solution is impossible to say. Al-Kunduri did not have much time left. In 1059, scarcely a decade later, Tughril Beg's brother Chaghri Beg died, and his son, Alp Arslan, who was to be the second great Seljuk sultan, became governor of Nisha- pur in his stead. Whereas Chaghri Beg had never displayed much interest in politics and had let al-Kunduri dictate policy in his territories, his son was different. More different still was his son's vizier, Nizam al-Mulk. If al-Kunduri's policies never had time to prove themselves, it is because they were not in accord with the policies of Nizam al-Mulk. IRANIAN STUDIES 50</page><page sequence="17">Little is known about the early career of Nizam al- Mulk. He came from the Khurasanian city of Tiis, entered Seljuk service in Balkh, and rose entirely within the court hierarchy. Unlike al-Kunduri, he does not seem to have been involved in local factional politics, although as a native of Khurasan and an intelligent man, he doubtless knew what it was all about. He must have come up at the very beginning of his period of power with the device that was to become the hallmark of his policy vis-a-vis local factions, the Nizamiya madrasa. Alp Arslan became governor of Nishapur in 1059, and the Nishapur Nizamiya was founded either that same year or the next year, five or six years before the famous estab- lishment of the same name in Baghdad. As its first direct- or, Nizam al-Mulk appointed Imam al-Haramain al-Juvaini, one of the exiled Shafici-Ashcarl leaders. His return marked the end of the persecution of the Ashcaris and the end of al-Kunduri's effort to make one branch of Sunnism orthodox through imperial patronage. To deduce from this that Nizam al-Mulk was simply attempting to substitute a Shaficl-Ashcari orthodoxy for a Hanafi one is unwarranted, however, just as it is equal- ly unwarranted to assume that his design in establishing Ni;dmiyas everywhere was to train officials for the central government hierarchy and thus foil the Shicite menace. There is no evidence that under the later Seljuks the bureaucracy was staffed by Nizamiya graduates, and speci- fic instances of Shicites reaching the top rungs of the hierarchy can be cited. Similarly, it can be shown that whenever the factions built toward the boiling point during Nizam al-Mulk's administration, he specifically did not act in the interest of the Shafici-Ashcarl faction despite the fact that the Nizamiyas were all established for its benefit. His letter of 1078, written in reaction to Ashcarl- Hanball rioting in Baghdad, in which he affirms the equal- ity of the various law schools, has been quoted earlier. On another occasion, in 1067, when a Shafic1 leader tried to discredit the popular and tumultuous leader of the Herat 51 Vol. XI, 1978</page><page sequence="18">Hanbalis, Shaikh al-Islam CAbd Allah al-Ansari, Nizam al- Mulk made a point of defusing the situation and placating al-Ansari.22 One final example, after restoring the Sha- fiCl-Ashcart faction in Nishapur, Nizam al-Mulk did not exact vengeance from the Hanafis who had been al-Kunduri's accomplices in the persecution. Instead, he saw to it that they retained a modicum of power and prestige in the city. If Nizam al-Mulk was not sufficiently committed to his chosen faction to fight for it, then, why did he spend so much money and effort on building a whole string of Nizamiyas? A definite answer to this question is not pos- sible, and the probability is that there were a number of overlapping motivations, including, perhaps, the desire to build an independent power base from which to make a bid for even greater authority in the empire. From the point of view of imperial policy toward local factional politics, however, the answer is probably this: While al-Kunduri wanted to declare the opinions of a single faction orthodox everywhere, Nizam al-Mulk was too sensitive to the tenor of local politics and the gov- ernment's need for local support to believe that such a policy would work. Instead, he bent before local sentiment and tried not to exacerbate already violent conflicts. Yet at the same time he tried to solve the entire problem in- stitutionally. One standardized instrument of religious patronage with outlets in every city in the empire would, ideally, bring the entire patrician class under some degree of central control. This was the purpose of the Nizamiyas, and within the Shafici law school they performed this func- tion quite adequately. They were not designed to recruit bureaucrats for the central government; they were designed to exert imperial influence on local religious politicians. The difficulty, of course, was that only one faction was effectively controlled in this way. Conceivably, other imperial patrons might eventually have established parallel madrasa systems to bring the other factions into line. That this did not happen, however, is not a fault that can be laid at Nizam al-Mulk's door. An institution cannot simply be created in a vacuum. It has to fit into the institu- IRANIAN STUDIES 52</page><page sequence="19">tional patterns already extant in the society. Unfortunate- ly, in the faction-ridden society of the eleventh century, there were no institutional patterns that were not part of the factional system. There were mosques, which were the- oretically open to all; but by this time they had become the property of one or another faction, as Maqdisi noted in Marv. In fact, Nizam al-Mulk did sponsor indirectly a Shafici congregational mosque in Nishapur to parallel the old Hanafi one. And then there were madrasas, which were also factional property. The only advantage to the mad- rasa was that its functions were much less fixed than those of a mosque, and hence it could be molded more easily to fit Nizam al-Mulk's needs. The third alternative, Sufism, was not sufficiently developed organizationally at that time to afford much promise. To declare the Ni;dmiya system a failure because it did not bring an end to factional politics under the Sel- juks, however, is to ignore the longer term perspective. By 1227 when the caliph al-Mustansir built his madrasa in Baghdad, it was possible to give all four current law schools room to teach in it. In general, the state-spon- sored madrasa developed as a key institution in the gradu- al absorption of the religious establishment into the central government hierarchy despite the fact that in its earliest days it had been too burdened by factional cleav- ages to function as planned. The end result arrived at under the Ottomans was the same as that visualized by al- Kunduri, dominance of a single law school under imperial auspices; but the means was gradual absorption through institutional change rather than autocratic fiat. This later evolution is far beyond the scope of this paper; and in terms of the subject under immediate discus- sion, it is misleading to dwell on it. The end result was never realized in Khurasan and Transoxania. The original premise that there is something special about the cities of that area, a feeling of autonomy with roots going back into the pre-Islamic period, is not belied by the later development of the madrasa and the law schools; for that development took place in different cities further west. The particular importance of Khurasan and Transoxania was 53 Vol. XI, 1978</page><page sequence="20">to set the problem of central power versus local political- religious factions in the clearest possible way. The Ghaz- navid and Seljuk sultans who ruled the area and, more im- portant, their Khurasanian administrators knew this problem at firsthand. The fact that the solutions to it that they attempted loom large in the development of Sunni Islam as a whole in later centuries is not germane to Khurasan and Transoxania. The turbulent years of the Mongols and Timu- rids followed by the emergence of Shicism as the Iranian state religion put the area outside the mainstream of Sunni Islamic development. The political-religious solutions of later Sunni Islam were never tested in the crucible of Khur- asanian local politics that brought them into being. NOTES 1.
