<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sinai and Olympus: A Comparative Study, by Joseph P. Scholtz and Lois Spatz. Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1 995. 790 pp. $75.50. This is truly an ambitious work, the most comprehensive and systematic scholarly comparison of Greek and Hebraic thought, so far as this reviewer knows, that has ever been undertaken. It divides the topic into ten parts: the nature of the sources, written and oral; creation, cosmogony as theology ; the origin of evil; cosmic order and theodicy ; paradigms of heroism; patterns of prophetic, charismatic, wisdom, and intellectual piety ; patterns of public worship, sacred people and sacred space; law and the state; concepts and methods of historiography; and the afterlife and apocalypses. In each case the procedure is to present first the Hebraic view, then the Greek view, and finally conclusions and comparisons. While there is relatively very little that is new, the authors are well acquainted with the major and most of the minor primary sources, as well as with an impressive portion of the secondary literature. They are well aware of the pitfalls in any such comparison and, to their great credit, avoid oversimplification. They are particularly to be commended for noting changes that occurred through the centuries in both the Greek and Hebraic views. The authors convincingly suggest (p. 69) that the impetus for the development of Greek science in the sixth century B.C.E. came from closer contacts with the East and note that it is precisely in Asia Minor, which is closer to the Near East, that these seminal thinkers originated. But we may well ask, if the impetus came from the Near East, why it did not come earlier, even much earlier, especially since we now have much archaeological evidence of contact with the Near East at an earlier point, particularly in the eighth century B.C.E. , when Greece and especially Asia Minor experienced a renaissance. Indeed, if, as there is good reason to believe, the Greeks acquired the alphabet from the Phoenicians not in the eighth century B.C.E. but as early as 1 100 B.C.E., we may postulate significant cultural contact at a much earlier point. The view established by Milman Parry that Homer, in the eighth century B.C.E., was an illiterate oral poet has increasingly been challenged by scholars, since his poems have much more in common with the epics of Mesopotamia, all of which were written. As for Hesiod, Homer's younger contemporary, he has even more in common with the Near East, not only in descriptive details but also in his view of</page><page sequence="2">144 SHOFAR Spring 1997 Vol. 15, No. 3 theodicy. As for the Bible, the name " Japheth," the ancestor of the Greeks, is tantalizingly close to Iapetos, the father of Prometheus; and Japheth' s son Javan, in its consonantal form Y VN, is tantalizingly close to Ion, the ancestor of the Ionians. In seeking to explain how the Greeks came to rely on their own powers of reason and judgment (p. 320), the authors stress the role of the Greek assemblies in debating issues, a practice which, they say, was not found in Israel. In this matter they might have noted what must have been the disillusionment of Greeks with the Delphic Oracle, the single most important unifying religious force among the Greeks, after the Oracle had, for once without ambiguity, advised the Greeks to submit to the Persian King Xerxes. If the Delphic Oracle could no longer be relied upon to give sound advice, at least in the political realm, the Greeks had to turn to themselves and to their own thinkers. On the other hand, as for the alleged lack in Israel of debates on issues, while it is true that there is no debate in an assembly of citizens there is debate in the Sanhédrin and in the academies (though, admittedly, there is dispute as to how far back such debates go and whether methodologi- cally they may not have been influenced by the Greeks), so much so that in no fewer than 319 instances debates in the Talmud are left undecided. As for the contrast, which the authors note (p. 491), between the covenanted community of the Hebrews and the human community of the Greeks, the fact, which, to be sure, they cite (p. 309), that in the debate between the first-century Rabbi Eliezer and the other sages (. Baba Metzia 59b) reason prevails over miracle, so that G-d himself is outvoted, since the Torah itself is said to require majority rule, would seem to diminish the distinction in such matters between the Greek and Hebraic approach. At one point (p. 442) the authors try to explain why Athens produced professional speechwriters and rhetoricians rather than lawyers and jurisconsults, as did the Romans, or rabbis, as did the Jews. They conclude that this was because its democracy empowered ordinary citizens to govern, legislate, and judge their fellow citizens. But, we may reply, this was also true in Rome, with its assemblies and courts, certainly in the period of the Republic. As for the Jews, while it is true that they did not have assemblies, they did have a procedure whereby, regardless of background or wealth, one could become a member of the supreme court, the Sanhédrin. In a number of places the authors raise the question as to why the Greek religion left thought so free. One answer is that it did not have a hereditary priesthood. Another answer that we may suggest is precisely because it was anthropomorphic and hence admitted of plastic remodeling, and hence the lack of a creed (the word dogma in Greek simply means "opinion," and the word hairesis , whence our word "heresy," refers to a philosophic, not a religious sect) and the possibility of diverse interpretations of the myths in the Greek tragedies and of criticism generally.</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 1 45 All in all, the authors are to be congratulated on their carefully researched, well balanced, fair-minded interpretation.
