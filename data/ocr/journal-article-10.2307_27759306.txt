<plain_text><page sequence="1">Behavior and Phibsophy, Spring/Summer 1994, Volume 22, No. 1 DENNETT'S CONCEPTUAL REFORM Don Ross University of Ottawa Five or so years ago it was often said, in tones of regretful challenge, that the empirical psychology of conscious agents was conducted precisely as if its subjects were not conscious. Now, such a short time later, the bookshelves and the journals are crowded with speculative and experimental investigations of consciousness. It is not, I think, surprising that attention has been shifted so quickly and dramatically. Once it became respectable to study consciousness, the subject was bound to have tremendous attraction for researchers, because consciousness is more fun than nervous reflexes and automatic sub-personal cognitive mechanics. If there is anyone who doubts this, then Daniel Dennett's already famous book Consciousness Explained (Dennett 1991a) should convince them, for there is no recent work of either philosophy or psychology that has provided more evident fun for both its author and its readers. At campuses everywhere in the fall of 1992, graduate seminars were rocking. But fun, as we all know, often leaves us feeling cranky and embarrassed later on. Sure enough, symptoms of a hangover are appearing with the sober reviews. (See, for example, the papers in the forthcoming issue of Philosophical Topics devoted to Dennett, and those in Inquiry 36:1/2. I do not intend here to gesture toward the papers in Dahlbom (1993), most of whose authors are still having a good time.) Critics worry that Dennett's extraordinary skill with thought experiments and analogies disguises a confused analytical framework and a distracting campaign against an assortment of straw men (most of them named Descartes). The heralds of the morning after sort themselves into two broad classes, according to disciplinary affiliation. Psychologists are troubled by Dennett's Rylean levelling of what have seemed to them to be substantive issues of interpretation concerning experiments with blindsight patients, metacontrast effects, color phi phenomena, and so on. With respect to these phenomena, whose common feature is behaviorally relevant cognitive access without, or with inaccurate, phenomenal access, Dennett accuses psychologists of lining up behind two kinds of interpretation, which he dubs the "Stalinesque" and the "Orwellian."1 He devotes considerable space to arguing that there is no fact of the matter at stake between Stalinesque and Orwellian interpretations, because no empirical findings could ever legislate between them. The way with psychological debates is, as he himself unapologetically recognizes, broadly verificationist; and academic psychology has been too badly and too recently bruised by an overly trusting attitude toward philosophical verificationism to be easily wooed by the charm of Dennett's metaphor-pair. Philosophers fear a different sort of seduction, worrying AUTHOR'S NOTE.

Thus, for example, Ned Block (1993) identifies three different concepts of consciousness, accuses Dennett of muddling them together, and charges that since Dennett doesn't consistently distinguish between (first-order) phenomenal consciousness, (second-order) self-consciousness and the cognitive phenomena associated with conscious access and control, his so called theory of consciousness can only be charitably understood as a "theory of the whole mind"?of which, Block makes clear, he thinks that we should be very skeptical. Against these killjoys, I will be arguing in favour of keeping the party going.2 Only some of the fun in Dennett's book derives from his rhetorical skill and confidence; the rest is a manifestation of the appropriate excitement that accompanies a significant re-working of our conceptual space. I cannot, in this short discussion, attempt an entire defense of Consciousness Explained. Metaphorically, the book is huge, and by philosophical standards, not very disciplined; as a result, there is more happening in it than anyone (including, I dare say, Dennett himself) can now fathom. In what follows, I wish to demonstrate just this much: We risk missing the point of Dennett's work if we climb into the trenches with critics such as Block without first recognizing that Dennett's main aim is to significantly change the conceptual framework within which we begin to investigate consciousness. Dennett would indeed collapse some hoary distinctions; but this is not regressive if those distinctions have led us into false dilemmas, as he contends. Furthermore, other distinctions are sharpened by Dennett to do some of the work for which the banished ones were intended. My method here simply involves reading Consciousness Explained in the context of Dennett's other works, particularly his work on intentionality (encapsulated in Dennett 1987) and his recent outline of his general epistemological and metaphysical views (Dennett 1991b). I will not explicitly summarize the positive model outlined in Consciousness Explained for the benefit of those who have not yet read the book. Instead, I will say just enough about the model as I go to defend its importance, all in the hopes of reassuring the book's established fans, giving pause to its established foes, and motivating others to read it. A theorist inevitably risks charges of straw homicide in attacking a disembodied 'tradition' rather than specific opponents. Nevertheless, there are conceptual traditions, the power of these traditions is often immense (even while their precise content is usually vague), and the most important sort of progress in science does frequently consist of recognizing and undermining them. Fomenting such a revolution is Dennett's ambition with respect to some central concepts of the mind.3 For the moment, let us put aside questions about who, if anyone, actually embodies the ancien regime, and just try to describe its characteristics. What Dennett calls "Cartesianism" (in both its dualist and materialist forms) consists mainly, I will urge, of a certain sort of conceptual association between agency, consciousness and selfhood. Dennett provides a host of vivid metaphors in his descriptions of the opposition, which helps us to see what it is that many positions on consciousness in the history of philosophy and psychology, despite their important differences, have in common. Dualist stories, 'flowchart' theories that make consciousness a functional part of the mind, 'Cartesian materialist' views that hold consciousness to be the 42</page><page sequence="3">DENNETT'S CONCEPTUAL REFORM capacity and purpose of certain regions of the brain?all of these types of accounts, whatever subtleties they invoke and whatever virtues they variously have in competition with one another, arise in an intellectual tradition that assumes that consciousness is the seat of agency. A theory of consciousness, according to this tradition, should explain the distinctive features of a 'fully human' life4 by showing how some part or ftinctional aspect of the mind/brain interacts with other parts or functional aspects of the mind/brain to produce the distinctive features of behavior and experience which are taken to be criterial for agency. This is not what Dennett's model does. Instead, it describes (at a very abstract level) the mechanisms by which members of a certain class of agents?the class that we pretheoretically distinguish by means of the concept of consciousness, but which we then often confuse with the entire class of agents due to the fact that we treat the same instances, adult humans, as the paradigms of both classes?achieve surprising feats of behavioral flexibility and representational abstraction. One of these feats is often the creation of a self, another concept that gets badly entangled with that of agency because, again, of shared paradigm cases. Let us begin with the first link in this structure, the relationship between agency and consciousness. The traditional association here is certainly not one of conceptual identification. Both philosophers and psychologists have, for the most part, conceived of agents as those unified loci of causal potential whose patterns of behavior are often best explained by appeal to reasons.5 This partial definition of agency makes no reference to consciousness, about which there has not been any similar analytic consensus. However, concepts in the neighborhood of consciousness become relevant as soon as one asks, with respect to the partial definition, "Whose reasons?" Do the reasons that explain an agent's actions have to be the agent's own reasons for action? Few contemporary theorists give a straightforward "Yes" in answer to this question, for to do so would be to embrace an extreme and flat-footed version of what Ruth Millikan (1984, 1993) has called "meaning rationalism," the view that the semantic characterization of a given purposive action must be determined by reference to deliberate plans and goals actually (consciously?) entertained by the agent whose action it is. But beyond this point of negative agreement, philosophers begin splitting hairs and psychologists retreat back to the lab in annoyance or boredom. The problem is that the other straightforward answer to the question above?"No"?leaves mysterious our robust pre-theoretic intuition that typical adult human beings are certainly agents, that chimpanzees might be, that cats probably aren't, and that cars certainly aren't, and that, furthermore, this continuum of agency is relevant to the domain of psychology. It is almost irresistible to begin to defend these intuitions by noting that adult human beings can entertain their reasons for their actions, that chimps can perhaps entertain their reasons in a dim way, that cats probably can't entertain their reasons at all, and that cars certainly can't (which, then, implies that their reasons aren't really "theirs" in the first place). The idea is readily encouraged that certain actors?e.g., cats?cannot be agents because they lack crucial aspects of "full" consciousness in not having the capacity to consciously deliberate. Anyone who has gone this far with the "traditional" conception will likely turn to the study of consciousness with the notion that consciousness is the name for a set of capacities, principally, perhaps, the capacities 43</page><page sequence="4">ROSS to'deliberate and to notice qualia. Of course, "deliberate" here must not mean "compute," but, instead, something like "direct and attend to one's own computations;" and about this, as with "noticing qualia," there is an air of paradox and circularity. The murkiness of the traditional association between agency and consciousness contributes to confusion in a further way. While consciousness is held to be part of the basis for agency in constituting the perspective from which the agent acts, it is also taken to be the fundamental relation between agents and the objects of their actions, and this inspires epistemic worries about how to gain scientific access to the systematic features of the "contents" of consciousness. One doesn't get a theory out of all this muddle; what one gets is a set of puzzles and conundrums. We should note as well some conceptual complexities that are internal to the notion of consciousness as it figures in the above characterization. Why should the capacity to deliberate and the capacity to notice qualia, which seem on the surface to be very different kinds of capacities, have been roped together under one concept in the first place? The answer presumably has to do with the fact that sensitivity to qualitatively transmitted information, like the capacity to deliberate, is clearly for the sake of controlling behavior and equilibrating it with fluctuating environmental circumstances. Equating the concept of consciousness with that of the body's ultimate control center is an important aspect of the conflation of consciousness and agency. This, in turn, implicates a third concept in the mix, that of the self, which serves as the enduring, identity-conferring site of the deliberations and sensations that are taken to be constitutive of consciousness and agency. But now, of course, one wants to ask whether the self is the conscious agent, or whether it is instead some sort of enabling possibility for consciousness and agency. Philosophers, trying to answer such questions, have generated a dense thicket of problems. Non-philosophers find it preferable to just put up with the imprecision and slight conceptual tension of supposing that consciousness, self and agency are all "more or less the same thing." These options do poor service for psychologists, who can neither rest with vagueness nor wait on the progress of metaphysics. Their resulting tactic of employing shifting operational definitions under the traditional conceptual labels as the need for them arises is born of necessity rather than desirability; it permits getting on with the job of empirical investigation, but in the meantime contributes to the reigning conceptual chaos. If one recognizes an influential intellectual legacy in this account, then one can hardly deny the desirability of achieving a clearer conceptual picture. Reminded of the value of the goal, then, let us examine some of what Dennett has to offer. It is not possible to do this here by means of a comprehensive summary; a lengthy treatise would be required to outline Dennett's rich network of theses about agency, consciousness and selfhood. I will instead attempt a shortcut by indicating a couple of the most surprising things that he has said about them, and showing how his conceptual reforms make these eyebrow-raising claims at least reasonable. First, then, on agency: Dennett claims that evolution is an agent, with a full set of intentions. Indeed, he claims that evolution's intentions are the basic source of all the other intentionality around; and, in Dennett (1987), he dramatizes this by referring to evolution using its anthropomorphic label, "Mother Nature." This way of talking will strike many ears as unscientific and gratuitously provocative. As we 44</page><page sequence="5">DENNETT'S CONCEPTUAL REFORM will see shortly, the point of the provocative language is not merely to provoke; but, first, let us find a way of stating the claim in terms that invite no images of goddesses. This will require a brief tour through some of Dennett's general views on both intentionality and epistemology. For Dennett, there is nothing to a system's having intentionality over and above the fact that its behavior is best predicted and systematized by characterizing it according to our network of intentional (roughly, folk psychological) concepts, that is (in standard Dennettian parlance) by taking "the intentional stance" toward it. Famously, this leads him to suppose that a thermostat could be said to have intentions, in the event that its behavior could not be better or equally well tracked by attending only to its physical description. This is the part of Dennett's philosophy which will likely be familiar to most readers. One can see already at this point that intentionality and consciousness have been pried apart in Dennett's conception, for he certainly does not imagine that a thermostat is conscious in any sense. But most commentators on the methodology of the intentional stance have supposed that this forces him to either adopt a degree of instrumentalism that undermines psychology's ambition to discover truths, or to agree that thermostats (and fish, and chess-playing computers, and so on) have merely "as-if' intentionality, that is, that the assignment of intentional states to non-agents is simply a matter of extending for practical purposes the model of explanation that is derived in the first place from our way of conceiving pre-theoretically identified cases of agency. Dennett has repeatedly denied that he is stuck in this cul-de-sac, but to many this denial has seemed to take the form of his asking to be called a realist (about intentional states) without being held responsible for the substance of realism; he has sometimes appeared to be a "realist" only in the sense that People's Democratic Republics were democratic and popular (See Dennett 1981.). Recently, however (Dennett 1991b), he has outlined plausible epistemological and metaphysical foundations for a non-instrumentalist understanding of his use of the intentional stance. Dennett rejects traditional atomistic reductionism of the sort which holds that there is some special, basic sense of existence in which all that exists are physical particulars. What science and careful everyday reasoning provide epistemic access to are, Dennett argues, "Real Patterns." To be a Real Pattern is to be a type of relatively stable, enduring structure that encodes information in a compressed form about other types of structures such that that information can be registered by some physically possible perceiver. More succinctly, what makes something real is its stability over time under a perspective, in conjunction with its utility as a carrier of information. Two aspects of this position prevent it from sliding into instrumentalism or constructivism: (1) what determines the range of physically possible perceivers is itself the non-constructed, mind independent structure of the world; and (2) questions about which structures encode information about which others, and about whether a given encoding is more compressed than a bit-map representation and, hence, epistemically useful in Dennett's required sense, can be investigated by the usual objective methods of science.6 The intentional stance, then, is the perspective which tracks intentionality as a Real Pattern. What makes a system whose behavior is best tracked from the intentional stance really intentional is not that intentional structures are isomorphic 45</page><page sequence="6">ROSS to, or supervene on, some special set of aspects of the system's physical microstructure, but that it instantiates the pattern under the stance. We can now gloss Dennett's claim about evolution's agency in non anthropomorphic, but still Dennettian, terms. Natural, fundamental intentional relations, according to the argument given in Dennett (1987) are the Real Patterns that are tracked under adaptationist construals of evolution.7 The idea is this: To explain an adaptation is to understand the role it plays in the functional design of the class of organisms whose adaptation it is. We gain such understanding by considering the design engineering problems faced by evolution, in the context of its working constraints.8 To conceive of evolution as a problem-solver is to assume the intentional stance toward it. To assume the intentional stance toward a system, under circumstances where assuming the intentional stance is the only or best way of understanding the output of the system, is to track it under a perspective which finds it to be a manifestation of an important Real Pattern, viz., intentionality. Therefore, to adopt an adaptationist perspective in biology is not merely to treat evolution as if it were an (extremely stupid but infinitely patient) agent. Rather, if we discover that our scientific ambitions compel us to adopt an adaptationist perspective, then this will amount to discovering that evolution is an agent.9 This is the point behind the "provocative talk" to which I alluded earlier. To regard Mother Nature as an agent, to speak of seeking biological explanations and generalizations by "reading her mind," is not just to resort to a set of colorful metaphors. Dennett's defense of the Panglossian paradigm in ethology is developed in the context of his theory of intentionality, rather than of consciousness. Its relevance to his account of consciousness, however, lies in the extent to which it undermines the idea that consciousness of any degree is necessary for agency. Nothing could be less conscious than evolution. To miss this would be to miss the fundamental character of Darwin's revolution, which involves the recognition that a process that once seemed almost analytically to involve agency?selection?need not be consciously directed.10 In arguing that Mother Nature's utter unconsciousness is compatible with her full agency, Dennett, we might say, shows how we have heretofore failed to be consistently Darwinian in our appreciation of the relationship between these concepts. It is important to bear in mind that the Darwinian insight doesn't just avoid supernatural causes in biology; it partly rests on and exploits the positive evidence against such causes that lies in the kludginess of biological design. As Dawkins (1986) has forcefully reminded us, the deepest disanalogy between the designer suggested by the actual biological evidence and the designer whose existence, prior to Darwin, was supposed to be established by the argument from design, is that the former, but not (hypothetically) the latter, is wholly unaware of what her designs are for. The everyday lexicon supplies a host of adjectives for characterizing this designer; she is, we say, blind, inflexible, sleepwalking? unconscious. We may pass lightly over this concept of an unconscious designer if, as Dawkins seems to, we treat it simply as a good metaphor. The Dennettian perspective that has us take the conception of evolution as a designer literally, however, focuses our attention on the nature of the difference between this designer and her pre-Darwinian counterpart. Two aspects of this difference are (1) that God, 46</page><page sequence="7">DENNETT'S CONCEPTUAL REFORM unlike Mother Nature, is supposed to be "aware" of the process under his control, and (2) that the former supposedly can, whereas the latter cannot, coordinate responses and strategies to achieve global optima by way of efficient paths. Now, if you suppose that distinction (1) could be significant independently of distinction, (2) then your intuitions diverge sharply from Dennett's. As Dennett sees it, the sort of awareness referred to in (1) would, by itself, be causally otiose, and therefore explanatively idle, in the absence of the flexible control mechanisms referred to by (2). To this extent, the traditional conceptual picture of consciousness is right to associate it with a certain sort of control structure. But the kind of control structure in question supports capacities that go well beyond mere agency. Conscious control structures are those that partly guide the behavior of the systems they direct by integrating diverse channels of information into representations that, tracked from the intentional stance, show up as goals and beliefs of the systems in question that refer to other states of the systems themselves. Human minds are such control structures; thus, (typical) humans have consciousness. God's mind was supposed to be such a control structure; so, before Darwin, speciation was thought to be guided by a conscious agent. Mother Nature's mechanism of control, natural selection, lacks the features of a conscious control structure; so she is an unconscious agent. The moral of these reflections will be drawn following consideration of the second surprising claim that I promised to discuss. Dennett maintains that if one built a robot that displayed roughly the degree of behavioral flexibility that is characteristic of people, and took no special steps to build consciousness into it (in the sense that one did not work up a theory of what properties a system must have in order to be conscious, and then try to instantiate those properties in the robot), one's robot would nevertheless almost certainly be conscious, in the full sense of the word. The defense of this claim undermines the traditional functionalist disassociation between phenomenal consciousness and cognitive consciousness,11 and this, in turn, has far reaching implications for our reflections on the kind of phenomenon that consciousness is. Most of Turing's functionalist descendants (though not, perhaps, Turing himself) have been inclined to admit the in-principle possibility of "zombies"?simulations of organisms that lack phenomenal consciousness but are otherwise indistinguishable from the organisms they simulate. When functionalism was chronologically and conceptually closer to the spirit of behaviorism than it is today, it was natural to appeal to the unimportance of zombiehood, and hence to the unimportance of consciousness, in defense of the fact that AI research did not (and still, for the most part, does not) seek to directly simulate phenomenal consciousness. Today, amidst the renaissance of consciousness, this can readily appear to cast AI against the side of the angels.12 Indeed, so much of the philosophical literature on the foundations of AI has been directed to solving the problems raised by the possibility of zombiehood that to announce its impossibility, while still maintaining confidence in AI and in functionalism, counts as revolutionary. While not claiming that zombies are logically impossible, Dennett indeed explicitly denies that zombies are possible in the interesting, empirical sense that is relevant to the debates over AI (1991, p. 282; p. 309-311; p. 405-406); and this denial, I maintain, is justified as a consequence of his disentanglement of agency and consciousness. 47</page><page sequence="8">ROSS To see this, consider how various possible task descriptions for AI look under Dennett's conceptual reformation. The task of simply building an agent is not a terribly interesting one, since Dennett's requirements on agency are so modest. Given that we can best track the behavior of a chess-playing computer by assuming the intentional stance toward it (Dennett 1978, p. 4-6), and given that it has well defined interests (if it doesn't play tolerably good chess, we'll scrap it), we already have scads of artificial agents on the shelf. The task of building a conscious agent is more interesting. I suggested above, in connection with Dennett's proposed "Darwinian revolution" in the study of consciousness, that for Dennett consciousness just is the concept of the kind of control structure that is empirically necessary for guiding the behavior of those agents who flexibly represent their goals to themselves.13 Now, it is easy enough to design control architectures that employ metarepresentations; but the organization of the description of an architecture by the concept of consciousness only has a point if the functioning of the architecture in question is better explained and predicted by treating some of the metarepresented contents as goals that admit of different but conceptually related interpretations under different environmental settings. (Let it be explicit here that consciousness, like intentionality, is a Real Pattern.) Since, according to this view, a system's consciousness is instantiated by properties of its control architecture but cannot be guaranteed by the system's falling under any particular projectible architectural classification recognized by control and systems theory, it is a pressing question as to what theoretical perspective could guide an attempt at artificial consciousness. The only evident procedure is to try to build a system which (1) requires description under the intentional stance, (2) is assigned goals under that stance which impact on one another in complex and unpredictable ways under different environmental circumstances, and (3) must realize some of these goals under time pressures that prohibit its trying to achieve them either by random induction over the whole solution space or by deployment of rigid routines under constant environmental cues. Why hope that this is the right methodological route to artificial consciousness? There is only one answer: Neither nature nor human speculation has yet produced a single example, or (detailed) imagination, of a system that satisfies (l)-(3) and is not conscious. The sound basis for ignoring the possibility of zombies is that no one can describe, in any satisfying detail, how a zombie might work. What do these claims?about Mother Nature's agency, about the basis for calling her unconscious, and about the impossibility of artificially intelligent zombies?suggest, when taken together, about the relationship between agency and consciousness? A contradiction might seem to loom: If Mother Nature is an unconscious agent, then isn't Mother Nature a zombie? Dennett's answer here would be that she is not a zombie in any sense that has mattered to philosophers. A philosopher's zombies are not merely unconscious agents; they are unconscious agents whose behavior would lead us to attribute consciousness to them. This is simply incoherent, according to Dennett; but it will look coherent if one slides from a behavioral warrant for attributing agency to a license for attributing consciousness. Now, if consciousness is merely a Real Pattern in cognition that shows up under certain intentional-stance perspectives, then it might appear that Dennett himself cannot avoid this slide. For Dennett, agency is indeed a necessary condition for 48</page><page sequence="9">DENNETT'S CONCEPTUAL REFORM consciousness: Since consciousness is the manifestation of a highly complex form of intentionality, one could never be licensed in attributing it to any system with respect to which one is not motivated to take the intentional stance. Furthermore, since he holds that there is no further particular property beyond a certain sort of complexity in intentional stance descriptions of behavior that constitutes consciousness or licenses its accreditation, it seems that agency of a certain kind, at least, must be sufficient for consciousness. Dennett could concede this second point without encouraging traditional puzzles, however, because his perspective allows us to partition the conscious from the unconscious agents, to as sharp a degree as is possible, without essential reference to the phenomenal aspects of conscious capacities. The attribution of consciousness to an agent is justified at the point where explanations of its behavior from the intentional stance begin moving assignments of behavioral cues inward from the external environment. Now, since "the point" just referred to is highly indefinite, and often shifts with changes in our explanatory perspective, there is no neat line of demarcation between the unconscious agents and the conscious ones. Dennett has often emphasized, however, that the absence of such lines anywhere in the biological sciences should surprise no post-Darwinian. We understand the concept of consciousness, even if we cannot yet describe its exact neurological enabling conditions, once we see that the evolutionary advantage gained by shifting behavioral cues inward is the enhanced flexibility that comes with the ability to re-classify environmental stimuli. Since increased representational power most clearly expresses itself in behavior as foresight, the need to attribute foresight in intentional stance explanations is our best evidential warrant for the attribution of consciousness. (This should not be taken to imply that the cognitive routines that implement foresight are constitutive of consciousness; according to Dennett's general epistemology as outlined earlier, nothing strictly internal to a system is literally constitutive of any Real Pattern which it instantiates.) Those who find these claims implausible are most likely to do so, I suspect, because Dennett seems to downplay altogether the epistemic importance of our first person sense of the unity of consciousness. Both agency and consciousness appear to have been deflated: Surely we mean more in attributing agency than that a system's responses are usefully given a teleological spin, and surely there is more to consciousness than representational mechanisms for allowing cross-environmental behavioral flexibility. Dennett's answer to these concerns is that the best way of honoring the intuitions behind them is not by preserving inflated concepts of agency and consciousness when the price for this is papering over important distinctions. For we have another concept?that of the self?by means of which we can articulate the intuitions in question, just so long as we prevent that concept from blurring with that of its traditional cognates. The self, for Dennett, is a further structure arising out of the same evolutionary pressures that led some agents to develop consciousness. An agent massively increases its flexibility across environments by developing a conscious control structure, though there is no privileged threshold here and what counts as a conscious control structure is a matter of degree. Similarly, a second order-of-magnitude increase in flexibility can be attained by conscious agents who evolve the proclivity and the capacity for constructing selves, that is, for structuring some of their representations into narratives that must satisfy standards of semantic 49</page><page sequence="10">ROSS coherence. Again, "selfiness" is an attribute of degree which vanishes incrementally as one works down the phylogenetic scale. (See Dennett 1991a, pp. 412-430, for the full story.) Selves, for Dennett, are tools used by a small class of agents?in fact, the most powerful tools devised by any agents that we know of, and in this sense well deserving of the importance that we attach to them both in our individual lives and in our intellectual traditions. Taking selfhood seriously entails precisely the opposite of mixing it up with its more generic conceptual brethren, agency and consciousness. Let us now return to Dennett's critics. Block's complaint that Dennett's war on the "Cartesian theater" is a campaign against straw men stems, I suspect, from his underestimating the generality of the conceptual mistake for which Dennett assigns Descartes symbolic responsibility. Dennett offers a host of metaphors to characterize this mistake: Consciousness, he tells us, is not a finish-line across which certain contents successfully race, nor a box in which privileged contents are stored, nor a "mind-pearl," nor a screening-room in which a stream of representations is displayed for the benefit of an executive homunculus. Critics express doubt that these metaphors do justice to the positions of any interesting opponents. Taken individually, of course, they don't; they're metaphors. No interesting psychological theory has ever consisted in the proposition that consciousness is the pearl in the mental oyster, or even, literally, in the proposition that consciousness is the representation of content to an internal homunculus. Consciousness Explained is not best read, however, as an intended refutation of any special theory of consciousness. Nor does it offer a special theory of its own, despite Dennett's careless use of the word "theory" in calling his "Multiple Drafts Model"?the positive aspect of the view for which his book argues?a theory of consciousness.14 Though it is (crucially) well informed by empirical psychology, and though its arguments are important to empirical psychology, this is philosophy. That is, it is conceptual work, a sustained demonstration of the utility of thinking about consciousness in a certain novel way, in contrast to the ways in which it has traditionally been entertained. Block is right to claim that, to the extent that one sees Dennett as giving us a (very general, very abstract, very rough) theory, it is more like a theory of the whole mind than of consciousness. The Multiple Drafts Model is, indeed, a profile of the radically decentralized (whole) mind with whose conception we must learn to be comfortable if we see fit to discard the more familiar "bureaucratic" model of cognitive control that seeks a common central locus of agency, consciousness and self. This breadth of scope is precisely what makes Consciousness Explained an important and exciting book. Finally, appreciation of the fact that Dennett's ambitions are mainly conceptual should help psychologists to avoid the worry that he is legislating the outcomes of their empirical disputes. There are contrasting processing models that differently explain color phi phenomena, blindsight and so on. These models may indeed differ in their accounts of where and how informational conflicts are resolved in the brain, and the issues between them are surely subject to empirical investigation. As I understand him, Dennett does not deny any of this. His claim is that these disputes will beget confusion instead of progress if they are understood as arguments about which contents get "into" consciousness, because the concept of 50</page><page sequence="11">DENNETT'S CONCEPTUAL REFORM consciousness expressed by the spatial metaphor is deeply confused.15 Dennett's alternative conception doubtless harbours some confusions of its own, and I expect that psychologists will play a larger role than philosophers in bringing these to light. They will do this not through tenacious defense of the old metaphors, but through determined experimental use of the new ones.16 REFERENCES Block, N. (1993).

A Stalinesque understanding of a cognitive phenomenon holds that a certain stimulus does its causal work pre-consciously, and then has a false account of itself read into consciousness by internal censor mechanisms responsible for narrative coherence. One would explain a phenomenon in an Orwellian way if one supposed instead that a stimulus is accurately read into the conscious record and then subsequently falsified in memory. 2. This is despite the fact that I do think that the area of philosophy bordering on biology, anthropology and empirical psychology is lately afflicted with an unhealthy level of what Wayne Norman calls "Penguin syndrome"?the desire to do work that can be published in Penguins?and that the popular success of Consciousness Explained has encouraged this. 3.1 will put aside altogether questions about whose revolution this properly is. Caveats about standing on the shoulders of giants are always in order, and thus are uninteresting except in detail. In the case at hand, Ryle's shoulders are most obviously bearing some weight, and Dennett himself says that he rests on Wittgenstein's (Dennett 1991a, p. 462-463). 4.1 do not mean to imply by this phrase that the Cartesian, in the broad sense relevant here, is committed to the claim that no non-humans are conscious. But for all Cartesians, adult human consciousness, in what are taken to be its distinctively human aspects, serves as the organizing paradigm for inquiry. 5. This was even true, though inadvertently, of behaviorists. Though they tried to get by without appealing to reasons in their explanations of behavioral facts, without the pre-theoretic concept of an agent there could have been no independently specifiable set of "behavioral facts" for them to seek to explain. I think that the eclipse of behaviorism is best understood as resulting from the recognition of this fact. Its application in the special case of linguistic behavior is the basic insight of Chomsky's famous critique of Skinner. 6. Information theory and, ultimately, abstract thermodynamics are the relevant investigative perspectives here. This metaphysic is ontologically liberal?the world teems with Real Patterns, from military strategies to rates of inflation?but the objectively determinate constraints on something's being a Real Pattern prevent Dennett from being in violation of Ockham's principle. 51</page><page sequence="12">ROSS 7. There is some controversy about whether Dennett's defense of adaptationism is consistent with his other views. Ringen (1993) associates genuine adaptationism, of the sort whose legitimacy is disputed by Gould and Lewontin (1979), with belief in causally effective teleology, and then wonders how Dennett can simultaneously defend adaptationism in ethology, oppose the demand of Dretske (1985) and others that reasons be causally efficacious in intentional explanations of behavior, and maintain that adaptationism in biology and intentional ism in psychology are two sound applications of one explanatory strategy. This objection misses the point that the distinction between causally effective reasons and reasons as explanatory posits under the intentional stance is an expression of precisely the conceptual picture that Dennett seeks to overthrow. 8. These include, most importantly, evolution's inability to render a class of organisms temporarily less fit in the interest of ultimate improvements. 9. This conditional way of putting the claim enables us to avoid, in the present context, the vexed question of whether adaptationism (in Dennett's sense, rather than that of Ringen [see note 7, above]) really is justified as the leading research program in biology. Of course, to the extent that selection for adaptations is a subsidiary or unimportant factor in evolution, Dennett's thesis becomes much less interesting. Millikan (1993, 41-50) directly takes up this challenge on behalf of the uses of adaptationism that she shares with Dennett. 10. Adam Smith had the same insight in another context, with equally impressive consequences. 11. Expansion of this point would be the basis for a detailed defense of Dennett against Block, which it is not my present purpose to undertake. For the moment, my point is just that Dennett does not ignore and confuse the distinction in question, as Block seems to suggest; it is a deliberate and important part of Dennett's project to destabilize the distinction. 12. Searle, for example, regularly exploits this association. With Dennett (1993), I would argue that he exploits it shamelessly. 13. Two points are worth stressing here. First, the relevant degree of flexibility can be very low by human cognitive standards. Second, this conceptual identification does not assimilate consciousness and self consciousness. The representations in question are what turn up when the intentional stance is assumed toward the system; and only a tiny minority of conscious systems can assume the intentional stance toward themselves. 14. This point has been impressed on me by Bjorn Ramberg. 15. Again, I owe this point to Bj0rn Ramberg. 16. I would like to thank Andy Brook and Wayne Norman for their very helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper. I am also grateful for the financial assistance of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (grant #410-91-1876). 52</page></plain_text>
