<plain_text><page sequence="1">"HOW DOES THE COGNITIVE SCIENCE OF RELIGION STACK UP AS A BIG THEORY, À LA HUME?'" Theodore Vial I. Good Big Theories of Religion David Hume wrote to a friend that as a young man his thinking about religion had begun "with an anxious Search after arguments, to confirm the common opinion." Finding no arguments to support faith, he aban doned his, and then found it curious that "any human, two-legged creature could ever embrace such principles" (cited in Smith 1947: 7, II, 41). Thus the Enlightenment project of explaining religion begins with the principle that religion requires explaining because it is an odd ity, somehow unnatural. It is no coincidence that Hume creates what many consider the first complete naturalistic theory of religion (Preus 1987: xiv). Hume and a handful of other towering theorists continue to provide guideposts in the study of religions for many reasons, one of which is that the theories they propose are comprehensive and coher ent. It is worth asking then if a recent big theory, the cognitive science of religion will prove to be equally fruitful, and to approach this question by asking if it is comprehensive and coherent. By comprehensive and coherent I do not have in mind any formal theoretical principles from the philosophy of science. But in working with and teaching theories and methods in religious studies it has become clear that influential big theories do share certain formal or structural qualities. (Van Harvey suggests creating such a classificatory scheme in order to compare logical or formal features of theories in his marvelous book on Feuerbach [Harvey 1995: 234-36].) Others in the pantheon of good big theorists in the naturalistic paradigm include Durkheim 1 I want to thank Greg Alies, Catherine Bell, Laurie Patton, Jeff Ruff, Robert Yelle, and audience participants for a fun and probing discussion on the panel where this paper was originally presented.

Their theories, too, could be placed easily and fruitfully into the schema I propose, and I have found this fruitful for purposes of comparison. For the sake of brevity I will mostly take Flume as an exemplar. Without making any claims about the ontological status of these categories, or to the categories' necessity and sufficiency, I have found it quite useful to compare the formal features of theories using seven basic categories or tasks that good big theories do. By compre hensive, I mean theories that handle each of these tasks well, and by coherent, I mean that the principles underlying or consequences result ing from each task do not come into conflict with each other. By way of illustration I sketch in features of Hume's theory. Comprehensive theories include at least the following seven characteristics: 1. A definition. When Hume asks what is the origin of religion in human nature, he equates religion with "[t]he belief of invisible, intelligent power" (Hume 1956: 21). 2. An epistemology. Hume is an empiricist, arguing that all "percep tions of the mind" can be classified either as ideas or impressions (that is, sensory experiences); and further, that ideas are copies of impressions (Hume 1977: 10-11). Given his definition of religion, his question about the origin of religion in human nature can thus be restated: What impression is it that gives rise to the idea of invis ible intelligent power? 3. An anthropology (in the sense this word is used in theology: an account of human nature—what are people like, why do they act the way they do?). Hume, raised a Scottish Calvinist, thinks that all actions are initiated by our sentiments and passions rather than rea son. We are driven by our passions, which are primarily self-love and pleasure (Hume 1983: 15). And yet, for Hume, leader of the Scottish Enlightenment, there is among our sentiments a small meas ure of pure benevolence. True, benevolence is useful to us (Hume 1983: 18). But he also gives examples of benevolence that please us but which cannot be useful to us personally. He concludes, "If usefulness, therefore, be a source of moral sentiment, and if this use fulness be not always considered with a reference to the self; it follows, that every thing, which contributes to the happiness of society, recommends itself directly to our approbation and good will" (Hume 1983: 43). 4. A description of the circumstances or occasion that gives rise to religion. Any event with an unseen cause can give rise to the idea of intelligent power, but given Hume's anthropology we are "much</page><page sequence="3">COGNITIVE SCIENCE, BIG THEORY, AND HUME 353 oftener thrown on [our] knees" by fear than hope. And humans had much to fear from accidents, nature, war "before the institu tion of order and good government" (Hume 1956: 31, 30). 5. A description of the human mechanism or feature that creates reli gion on this occasion. Hume believes that humans are natural anthro pomoiphizers. "There is a universal tendency among mankind to conceive all beings like themselves" (Hume 1956: 29). 6. An account of the facts of religion (how do we get from the start ing point to the wide array of religious phenomena now present). The idea of intelligent powers arises from the impressions of dan gerous accidents with unknown causes, creating polytheism as the first form of religion. We then flatter our gods into monotheism. "(H]is votaries will endeavor, by every art, to insinuate themselves into his favor; and supposing him to be pleased, like themselves, with praise and flattery, there is no eulogy or exaggeration, which will be spared in their addresses to him" (Hume 1956: 43). It is worth noting here that Hume includes no real theory of ritual in his theory of religion. This intellectualist slant is typical of the Enlightenment. Were he to account for ritual it would likely have to be at this point, as a form of exaggerated praise. 7. An interpretive strategy (if religious phenomena are not to be taken at face value, what do they really mean, to what do they really refer back?). For Hume the strategy is to trace the religious idea back through the chain of flattery to the original idea, and show what impression this idea copies. I do not know anyone who claims to be a Humean in the study of religion. Yet his theory remains an influential touchstone, in part because it is comprehensive and coherent. (There are, of course, still Durkheimians and Freudians.) Some aspects of his theory are stronger than others. While strict empiricists are few and far between these days, a good deal of Hume's justified fame as a philosopher is based on his episte mology. Similarly his anthropology, given depth by its Calvinist Augustinian roots, carries a great deal of weight. Placing the weight of diverse religious beliefs and practices on the human tendency to flatter is much thinner and less satisfactory. Aside from the theory's intrinsic merits, Hume gets credit for constructing the first modern naturalistic theory. How does the cognitive science of religions stack up against a good big theory like Hume's?</page><page sequence="4">354 THEODORE VIAL 2. A Recent Big Theory of Religion To lay my cards on the table, I think that the cognitive science of reli gions does a comparably good job with some of the categories described above, but falls short in a couple of others. After providing a basic ori entation to the field (section 2), I will then cover the aspects included in comprehensive and coherent theories (section III). I will not spend much ink on the theory's strengths, but will focus on the two cate gories where further work is needed to make the approach compre hensive: #3 (anthropology) and #6 (accounting for the facts). One further caveat about this presentation: when talking about the cognitive science of religions we are talking about not a single author but a collection of people pursuing related but different research agendas, who do not always agree among themselves. So I have first to construct a theory out of diverse sources, then praise and criticize my own construction. Since I am sympathetic with the general approach, I hope I can be trusted to do so fairly. One appeal of the cognitive approach is the way it deals with "cul ture." Culture has a great influence on how we think and act, but when we try to analyze it we often have the experience described by Bruce Lincoln: "whenever I have tried to think through exacdy what [culture] means or why we all use it, the exercise has proved both bewildering and frustrating" (Lincoln 2000). Culture by definition seems bigger than any individual, and external to individuals. For that rea son newcomers to a community must be acculturated. If that is the case, where and what is it? If we define culture as similar ideas and practices shared by or dis persed across a group of people, the cognitive answer to the question of Where is culture? is that it is located in individual minds. Ideas and actions will be shaped in part by the way our minds work. One ances tor, then, of this approach is Kant. The cognitive story is that the cre ation, memory, and transmission of ideas and practices, including the ideas and practices of religion, are shaped by the cognitive hardware with which humans have evolved. Culture is not beyond individuals, but is the patterns shared by individuals, and they are shared because minds share certain universal features that shape the ideas and actions of individuals in constant and predictable ways. Religion piggy-backs on everyday cognitive processes. A more proximate debt is owed here to Chomsky than to Kant. Chomsky argued that out of the indefinitely large number of utterances children encounter, many broken or incomplete, they can infer a well</page><page sequence="5">COGNITIVE SCIENCE, BIG THEORY, AND HUME 355 structured grammar. This allows them to produce new sentences, and to judge the correctness of sentences they have never before encoun tered. They can do this because of an innate language competence (see, among others, Chomsky 1965). While specific languages are different, these languages will share a deep grammar because language compe tence is a universal part of normal human mental structure. One appeal of the cognitive science of religions is that it provides a good theoret ical foundation for comparative religions. While specific claims and practices of religions differ in the details, they share certain features. The similarities of these features can be accounted for by our mental hardware. Just as Chomsky is not a hermeneut interpreting the meaning of sentences, so " [t] he content claims of religious systems are peripheral to the actual object of study in the cognitive science of religion. We are more interested in the operations of the cognitive mechanisms that produce, constrain, and transmit religious representations than in whether those representations refer to external realities" (Slone 2004: 47). Note already one sea change in the naturalistic paradigm cemented by Hume. One of the first moves of the cognitive sciences is to show that, far from being a puzzling oddity, somehow unnatural, religion tends to be the natural state of humans. What requires more explain ing is the puzzled atheism of the Humes, Freuds, and Durkheims of the world (Barrett 2004: 122). To date there have been two trajectories in the cognitive science of religions, one beginning with religious ideas (Guthrie 1993, Sperber 1996, Boyer 2001, Barrett 2004), another with ritual (Lawson &amp; McCauley 1990, McCauley and Lawson 2002, Whitehouse 1995 and 2004). I am not sure that the scholars whose work I will sketch would see them selves as being on one trajectory or the other, and they often end up collaborating on projects and at conferences. They see themselves as part of a community that is constructing a comprehensive theory. Nonetheless, each trajectory does have an independent historical ori gin, and the collaborators continue to have an informal division of labor. Some of the tensions in the cognitive science of religions comes from trying to fuse the two trajectories. I want to sketch some of the achievements of each in turn. Religious Ideas If we begin by defining culture as the ideas shared by individual minds, we must then ask why so many minds have such similar ideas. One proposal is that of Richard Dawkins, that mental units or memes are</page><page sequence="6">356 THEODORE VIAL simply copied from one mind to another. Dawkins's model is based on the metaphor of genes replicating themselves through the reproduction of organisms. It has proved more fruitful, however, to adopt another biological metaphor, what Dan Sperber has called the epidemiological model. In contrast to genetic reproduction in which mutation is the exception rather than the rule, in the world of communication it is quite rare that an idea is copied perfectly from one mind to another. This is obvious to any professor grading exams. But we do share many ideas, and we do so because "transformations tend to be biased in the direction of attractor positions in the space of possibilities" (Sperber 1996: 108). The ideas that are the easiest to produce, remember, and transmit will be selected for. Our cognitive structure will create certain attractor positions around which the majority of ideas that survive tend to cluster. Barrett encourages us to think of the mind not as a tool but as a rack of tools, each evolved in some adaptive way over the course of hominid evolution (Barrett 2004: 3). Pascal Boyer compares the mind to an English estate described in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The guests upstairs (our conscious thoughts) rely on a largely invisible staff downstairs (pre-conscious mental processes) to take care of all their needs. This downstairs staff is large, their tasks are specialized (the maid who cleans the floor will not cook your breakfast), and has a chain of command. While this arrangement is efficient, it is also inflexible (Boyer 2001: 93-94). If you set out your boots at night they will be shined for you by morning. But to get your boots shined in the afternoon will be near impossible, because the servant responsible will be busy with other tasks in his regular routine. What are some of the tools, or the invis ible downstairs staff of the mind? There are several on which the cog nitive science of religions has focused. Stewart Guthrie has argued that humans have a tendency to over detect agency in their environment (Guthrie 1993). If you are hiking in the woods and see a large brown shape out of the corner of your eye you are better off assuming (or, you are better off if your down stairs staff assumes) that it is a bear rather than a boulder. If you think it is a bear and are wrong there are no great negative consequences. But if you assume it is a boulder and are wrong the consequences could be grave indeed. We are biased to attribute noises we hear in the night to agents (burglars) because this bias is selected for through survival and reproduction. Barrett calls this the hypersensitive agency detection device (HADD). One could further argue that survival is best served in this evolutionary Pascal's wager by attributing the most</page><page sequence="7">COGNITIVE SCIENCE, BIG THEORY, AND HUME 357 powerful type of agency possible to the unknown causes that produce such effects. Humans have historically had more to fear from other humans than from bears. Thus, there may be a bias to attribute human like agency to events observed in our world (Guthrie 1993: 45). The selective advantage such a device would bestow on a human ancestor who was both potentially predator and prey is obvious. There are more tools in our cognitive rack. Fairly early on human children develop an intuitive physics (Boyer 2001: 98-99; Barrett 2004: 4). At a young age they act on the assumption that non-living objects are bounded, cannot pass through other solid objects, move only when moved by external force, etc. It is cognitively cheap to place all objects in this template of assumptions, rather than having to learn and store this oft repeated information about each object encountered (Boyer 2001: 40-45). Children also have an intuitive psychology (Boyer 2001: 100). They develop a theory of mind at a young age. Objects that are self moving are assumed to have "desires that motivate actions, thoughts and beliefs that guide actions, memory for storing percepts and thoughts, and so forth" (Barrett 2004: 5). At age four most children have a hard time seeing that other people may hold false beliefs. By age five most children understand that people can hold false beliefs. In one ingenious experiment researchers showed three-year old children a cracker box, and asked them what was inside. The children answered, "crackers." The researcher then opened the box and showed them that there were rocks inside. When the children were then asked what their moms would think was in the box if they came into the room, three year olds answered, "rocks." By age five most children understood that their mothers might hold false beliefs about the content of the box (Barrett 2004: 78). In other words, children make use of the theory of mind to understand the beliefs and actions of other humans. Interestingly, in a cross cultural study, five and six year old children asserted that, while their mothers would think that there were crackers in the box, God (or the culturally appropriate equivalent) would know that there were rocks in the box. It is apparently not the case, as Hume argued, that we begin with anthropomorphism and then flatter our gods into omnis cience (Hume 1956: 29-30, 43). Rather, we begin with an omniscient theory of mind, and then scale down our expectations of humans as we gain more experience of them (Barrett 2004: 79). Thus, the cogni tivists argue, we have evolved to attribute powerful, human-like, inten tional agency to events in the world. Some of the most potentially fruitful research in the cognitive sci ence of religion investigates what kinds of ideas, once generated and</page><page sequence="8">358 THEODORE VIAL communicated, tend to be remembered. Easily remembered concepts would seem to be "fitter" candidates for cultural survival across a group of people. In a series of experiments Justin Barrett has shown that sto ries that involve what he calls minimally counter intuitive (MCI) ideas are more likely to be recalled. MCI ideas are ideas of agents or objects that violate one assumption of our intuitive physics, or psychology, or biology. A violation can be either a contradiction of the category (a solid object that passes through other objects, like a ghost) or a trans fer of characteristics from one domain to another (a statue that listens to prayers is an object with one characteristic taken from biology). Stories involving merely bizarre ideas (a table made of cheese) are not more likely to be recalled. The theory to account for this is that com pletely intuitive ideas, while cognitively cheap, do not attract much attention. Maximally counter intuitive ideas carry too high a cognitive load to be easily remembered (invisible tables made of cheese that lis ten to prayers and can eat and die) (Barrett 1998 and 1999). MCI ideas both attract attention and dovetail with the routine of our down stairs staff enough so as not to be too cognitively costly. Because MCI ideas are easier to remember than others, they are selected for mnemonic survival, and are more likely to be the ideas we hold in common. This explains why people naturally tend to hold reli gious ideas. (I will return later to the question of how much overlap there is between MCI ideas and typical religious concepts.) It also explains people's tendency to anthropomorphize, a tendency endlessly frustrating to trained theologians who argue for ideas that are often maximally counter intuitive. Here then is a cognitive account of how our mental equipment pre disposes us to detect agency where there is none, and how some of these ideas of agents are more likely than others to be remembered and passed on. I turn now to the other track in the cognitive science of religion, the track that begins with ritual. Religious Actions The trajectory in cognitive science has focused on religious ritual orig inated in the work of E. Thomas Lawson and Robert McCauley. In precisely the same way that Chomsky's generative grammar focuses on the competence of speakers to master specific languages, Lawson and McCauley argue that humans represent actions mentally in a cognitively structured way (Lawson and McCauley 1990, McCauley and Lawson 2002). Lawson and McCauley argue that humans plug items from their</page><page sequence="9">COGNITIVE SCIENCE, BIG THEORY, AND HUME 359 cultural lexicon into a schema (called the action representation system) of agents, actions and patients. This is true for all representations of actions. What distinguishes representations of religious ritual from representations of other actions is that at some point a culturally pos tulated superhuman agent (CPA) will be implicated in one of these slots. A baptism, for example, is legitimate or felicitous if performed by an ordained priest. A priest's ordination is legitimate because the ordi nation was performed by a legitimate bishop, and so on. The chain of cause and effect is not an infinite regress as with non-religious action, but comes to a definite stopping (or starting) place, the action of a CPA, in this case the foundation of the church by Jesus ("Go there fore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit," (Matt. 28:19). Like grammar, the rules of which most people would have trouble stating explicitly, but which all competent speakers of any dialect call on to recognize correctly formed utterances, the action representation system will shape participants' judgments of correctly performed rituals, even if they are unable to state explicitly the rules for a ritual one would find in a liturgy. In other words, Lawson and McCauley have a the ory of ritual competence, not ritual performance. Lawson and McCauley argue that the slot in which one finds the CPA, and the number of embedded rituals it takes to get to the CPA, will have important ramifications for ritual. The fewer embedded actions it takes to reach the CPA, the more central a ritual will be to a given religious system. For Christian traditions with a doctrine of the real presence, communion is one of the most important rituals (for exam ple the Catholic Mass, in which the most proximate CPA is the host blessed by the priest). If the CPA is implicated in the action or patient slot, the ritual will be relatively low pageantry, repeatable, and non reversible (again, Mass is an example). If a ritual is what they call a special agent ritual (the CPA in the agent slot), it will have high pageantry, be non-repeatable, and be reversible. In baptism, for exam ple, the CPA is implicated in the agent slot (it is the legitimately ordained priest who performs the action on a patient). Specialists in various reli gious traditions could test these claims empirically. Another important contribution to the cognitive science of religion that begins with ritual comes from Harvey Whitehouse. He observed (as have many before him) that some religious rituals are performed very infrequently but sensationally (as for example in Papua New Guinea, where he did his field work and where initiation rites occur every ten to twenty years, and have been called rites of terror), other rituals</page><page sequence="10">360 THEODORE VIAL extremely frequently but far more sedately (Whitehouse 1995). Whitehouse, like Lawson and McCauley, argues that this pattern is accounted for on cognitive grounds. But the specific grounds he focuses on differ, at least initially, from the mental representations discussed in Lawson and McCauley. Lawson and McCauley were first influenced by Chomsky, Whitehouse by research into human memory. For religious traditions to survive (or, to be selected for), members of those traditions must (a) remember their tradition and (b) be motivated to pass it on. The patterns noted by Whitehouse rely on different mnemonic strategies to ensure the tradition is remembered. Human mnemonic strategies create basins of attraction around which the transmission of ideas and practices cluster or coalesce. Sensational events are stored as a specific type of long-term memory psychologists call flashbulb memory. The high pageantry of infrequent rituals seems designed to create the conditions that trigger flashbulb memory. Whitehouse calls this sensational ritual pattern the imagistic mode of religiosity. Frequendy occurring events are stored as scripts in semantic memory. These scripts are cognitively efficient, since each specific occurrence need not be recalled. If you ask an Anglican what happened in a church service last year, she will be able to say in general what happened, because that is what happens every week. But she will only be able to recall exactly who was there or what was said if something extraordinary occurred during the service. Whitehouse calls this the doctrinal mode. These mnemonic supports allow traditions to survive that pass along maximally, rather than minimally counter-intuitive (MCI) ideas (think of the Jesus of Chalcedon). The doctrinal mode is easily verbalized and is very portable. It tends to form large anonymous communities (the Anglican Church, for example). Its Achilles' heel is the tedium that can set in with frequent repetition. The imagistic mode tends to form small very tighdy cohesive groups. It is not easily verbalized, and cannot be transported easily. The implications for the influence of religious mode on the political history of humankind are powerful and intriguing. 3. Is It a Good Big Theory ? Circling back to the characteristics of past good big theories, how does the cognitive science of religions stack up? First, the definition of reli gion. The idea trajectory of scholarship has tended to assume, implic itly or explicitly, an intellectualist definition. Religion is belief in MCI beings. Other aspects of religions are treated as afterthoughts. The titles</page><page sequence="11">COGNITIVE SCIENCE, BIG THEORY, AND HUME 361 In Gods We Trust (Scott Atran), Why Would Anyone Believe in God? (Justin Barrett), and Theological Incorrectness: Why Religious People Believe What They Shouldn't (Jason Slone) accurately reflect the contents of the books. Pascal Boyer's book is called Religion Explained, but ritual gets just one chap ter out of nine (and it is the least satisfying chapter, a discussion to which I will return below). The book's subtitle is, accurately enough, The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought. This trajectory is much closer to Hume's definition than it is to Durkheim's ("A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them" [Durkheim 1995: 44]). Furthermore, no real effort is made to distinguish between witches, ghosts, and gods. One could of course include any or none of these in a definition of religion, but it is impor tant to do so explicitly and for theoretically justifiable reasons. Whitehouse (Whitehouse 2004: 1-4) and Lawson and McCauley (McCauley and Lawson 2002: 8-10), who begin with ritual, are far more careful in their definitions. In part this is because Whitehouse is concerned to distinguish between everyday beliefs in things like ghosts and witches, which can be accounted for along the lines of Barrett's and Boyer's MCI concepts, and more maximally counter intuitive ideas and practices, which seem to require mnemonic and institutional support (provided by the modes of religiosity). Lawson and McCauley are clear that they do not propose a theory of religion, but of religious ritual, and that furthermore the rituals they focus on are those with agents, actions and patients (like baptism or communion), not those with only agents and actions but no patients (like meditation). Behind the work of these theorists one can detect the very careful work of the anthro pologist Benson Saler, whom I commend to all cognitivists (Saler 2000). Second, epistemology. The cognitive science of religions is a subset of the academic branch of research most actively examining this ques tion. Like Hume in his day, they are on the cutting edge of today's epistemology. I am not competent to judge what researchers in other branches of cognitive science would make of the cognitive science of religions. I will leave anthropology (#3) and accounting for the facts (#6) for the end. The cognitivists have a very plausible and rich account of the circumstances that give rise to religion (category #4). It is part of a larger story of hominid evolution, the result of which has been certain cognitive tools that are fertile for religion. One's orientation to social sciences in general and to naturalistic explanations in religious studies</page><page sequence="12">362 THEODORE VIAL will in large part determine whether or not one takes these accounts to be an instance of reverse engineering (a legitimate scientific enter prise) or of just so stories (a legitimate fictional enterprise). The human mechanism (category #5), at least insofar as we concern ourselves with the mental tools that account for religion, is a strong suit of this approach. Our preconscious tools naturally throw up religious ideas that are then selected for, again for cognitive reasons, for cultural survival. The inter pretive strategy (category #7) is a bit of a misnomer, since the field is guided by an effort to stop interpreting the meanings of religions. Nevertheless, the strategy is to trace religious phenomena back to the characteristics shared by human minds, and ultimately back to the evo lutionary process that produced these minds. I turn now to the areas which seem to me to be most in need for further reflection and research (what a colleague of mine refers to as growth edges): the ability to account for the diverse range of religious phenomena (#6) and anthropology (#3). When reading in the relatively new field of the cognitive science of religions one can get both the feel ing of excitement, and of disappointment. The approach is promising and indeed has already yielded significant insights. But parts are unsat isfying, and in its self-promotion, perhaps necessary in the cacophonous field of religious studies, it sometimes seems to promise more than has been delivered. Has religion really been explained? For Hume, Durkheim, and Freud, the answer is yes, even if one does not buy their explana tions. For the cognitive science of religions, the answer is no, even if one is sympathetic with the approach. Accounting for religious phenomena (category #6). Having found a starting place for religion, can the theory show how other religious phe nomena develop in all their richness? There are two gaps in the cog nitive theory here. (1.) One looks in vain in Boyer, Atran, and Barrett, who among the religious concept trajectory have offered the most com prehensive accounts of religion, to see how one gets from MCI ideas thrown up by our HADD to the maximally counter-intuitive ideas found in many religions. (2.) And once one begins by showing that religion throws up MCI ideas that human memory and communication select for, it is apparently very difficult to show why religious people do the rituals they do. I will take up each of these issues in turn. (la.) There are two stages unaccounted for in the path from MCI agents thrown up by the HADD to the typically more maximally counter intuitive superhuman agents present in religions as typically defined. First, having argued that our minds are geared to detect agency, it is</page><page sequence="13">COGNITIVE SCIENCE, BIG THEORY, AND HUME 363 then simply assumed that these detected agents hang around to become grist for the cognitive "gadgets" or inferential systems we all share. But this process is never explained, nor is there any account of why we (or our ancestors) cling to certain MCI agents and discard others. Bears and burglars are completely intuitive, gods are not. Most fake positives are quickly recognized as such (it really is a boulder, not a bear). Why were others not discarded, and how did they develop from generic agency to specific, named, agents (Ra, Yahweh)? Hume's explanation that the process is one of flattery is not very satisfying, but at least he has one. Certainly one sees nothing in the cognitive sciences of reli gion comparable to chapters eight and nine of Durkheim's Elementally Forms. There, having argued that the origin of religious belief is mana or the totemic principle, he very carefully traces the development of this principle into the ideas of souls, spirits, and gods (Durkheim 1995: 242-99). (lb.) Then there is the matter of belief. (Atran refers to this as the "Mickey Mouse problem" [Atran 2002: x].) This problem has not been solved. One can find MCI agents in many cultures that, in their vio lation of intuitive categories, resemble formally the objects of that cul ture's religions, and yet they remain parts not of religion but of fantasy or play or campfire stories. So there must obviously be more to the cognitive story than the formal properties of MCI agents. This part of the story is not yet told. The cognitive theorists are aware of the belief problem, and have tried to provide part of an answer. A principle of cognitive science, according to Barrett, is that "the more mental tools with which an idea fits, the more likely it is to become a belief' (Barrett 2004: 50). MCI agents are not created as a means of explanation, but once present they are relevant to many mental systems, they "'excite' more infer ence systems, fit more easily into their expectations, and trigger richer inferences" (Boyer 2001: 264). Here Boyer focuses on the moral intu itions and "social gadgets" that have evolved as humans have coordi nated actions over generations. Our moral and social interactions and reflections rely on what Boyer calls "strategic information": "the sub set of all the information currently available (to a particular agent, about a particular situation) that activates the mental systems that regulate social interaction" (Boyer 2001: 152). Strategic information includes the topics that fuel gossip: survival, status, reproduction. And the gods that matter most to religious systems have a lot of strategic information. They are full access agents (Boyer 2001: 158).</page><page sequence="14">364 THEODORE VIAL Furthermore, while Boyer argues that it is not the case that people create gods to explain misfortune, it does seem to be the case that mis fortune tends to activate social interaction systems. Though perfecdy aware of mechanical rational causes of unfortunate events, these expla nations cannot answer the questions Why me? Why now? (Boyer 2001: 196-97). Misfortune gets construed as "an effect of violations of social exchange," and again, as participants in social exchange the gods have more strategic information and tend to have more power. They gain salience as a by-product of social interaction. But there are MCI agents with strategic information that are not objects of religious thought or practice. Cognitivists have done a pretty good job of explaining why gods in general are remembered, but a very poor job of explaining why people believe in specific gods. Santa Claus, for example, has lots of strategic information. He knows if you've been good or bad. Perhaps this is less a Mickey Mouse problem (part of his charm is his lack of strategy) and more a Dumbledore problem, who seems to possess exactly the kinds of information those around him care most about. Of course, ideas and practices dealing with Santa Claus occur within a frame of "children's game," Dumbledore a frame of "fiction." Neither is the object of a serious cult. But to point this out is simply to point out the need to flesh out more of the story, since it cannot rely exclusively on the interaction of formal characteristics of agents with the cognitive gadgets we have seen described so far. Games, fiction, and religion are more than social, they are institutional and they are historical. I have often presented Buddha to introductory reli gious studies classes as neither a game nor a fiction but as an agent taken seriously by large numbers of people. But this did not occasion the spread of Buddhism on my campus the way missionaries spread Christianity in Korea. A full account would have to give enough insti tutional history, and explain the interaction of institutions with minds, to differentiate Santa from Jesus, or the medieval from the modern cel ebration of Halloween. (A narrow ethnography, but an extremely impor tant first step in the direction of accounting for institutional roles within the cognitive sciences of religion, is Malley 2004.) Atran adds to the list of characteristics necessary to successful MCI concepts that they be emotionally provocative (Atran 2002: 97). Surely he is right about this, and if the characteristics that stimulate emotion in MCI agents could be defined, this might better distinguish gods from MCI agents, though it would not entirely solve the problem of why some gods become the object of serious cults and others do not. Memory and belief are linked, but not identical.</page><page sequence="15">COGNITIVE SCIENCE, BIG THEORY, AND HUME 365 Assuming that these issues of belief in MCI agents could be sorted out, the other major lacuna in accounting for the diverse facts of reli gious phenomena is the problem of accounting for ritual. This is an ironic problem for a field that was initiated by Lawson and McCauley's Rethinking Religion, which is dedicated to a competence theory of ritual. But the fact of the matter is that those on the religious idea trajectory have a very hard time fitting ritual into their theories, and those on the ritual track have no good way to connect the ideas described by the idea trajectory into their theories. Justin Barrett, refreshingly, is very up front about the limited nature of his claims about ritual. "I am not attempting to explain why people begin performing religious rituals in the first place. Rather, once rituals and other religious actions have started, they have consequences for encouraging religious belief..." (Barrett 2004: 73 n. 1). Rituals encourage belief because in rituals people not only state what they believe but act as though they believe. They walk the walk as well as talk the talk. Rituals create social pressure to believe, and reinforce one's own belief (if I am acting this way, it must be important). Finally, rituals that do not attempt to influence nature but rather make social or religious changes, work. This shows belief to be effective (Barrett 2004: 62, 69, 70-71). Like the others on this trajectory, Barrett spends a fair portion of his efforts to account for ritual in describing the work of Lawson and McCauley and Whitehouse. There is an implied division of labor here. Scott Atran, similarly, claims to have a complete theory of religion, and similarly has very little to say about ritual (Atran 2002). He argues that the coordinated movement of rituals encourages social cohesion, as do the costly signs of mutual commitment (Atran 2002: 170). Despite Atran's dismissal of functionalism (Atran 2002: 207-210), this thin section on ritual appears to veer dangerously close to it. Of those on this trajectory, Pascal Boyer has the most to say about ritual. He identifies three properties of ritual that can lead to an expla nation: rituals combine work (they do something) and play (the connection between the actions taken and their effects is not obvious) with a sense of urgency; rituals have social effects (creating women out of girls, couples out of individuals); and in many rituals supernatural agents get involved (Boyer 2001: 235-36). He then offers a cognitive account of each of these three properties. The urgency of ritual, and its preoccupation with boundaries and with purity and pollution, show a connection with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Boyer does not argue that religious ritual is neurotic</page><page sequence="16">366 THEODORE VIAL (nor does Freud, despite popular misreadings). Rather, he argues that both stem from the normal cognitive contagion system that causes us to take special precautions against undetectable hazards (Boyer 2001: 240). OCD is a "slight distortion of normal brain functioning" in which the contagion system, which causes revulsion in normal people (of corpses, certain fluids, etc.), causes direct motor behavior in OCD sufferers (Boyer 2001: 239). Ritual cues this contagion system, which makes it highly attention grabbing, and therefore fit for cultural survival. Second, rituals are easier to understand when one pays attention to their effects on social relations. The official justification for many tribal initiation rites is to pass on secret knowledge to boys as they become men. But the information is often vacuous or paradoxical. Rites actually do, however, trigger mental systems for coalitional behavior in groups whose success depends on cooperative action, where defection threatens the group, and where it is difficult to punish defectors (Boyer 2001: 244-45). Many rituals accompany processes that would occur anyway (puberty, creating reproductive units). But these rituals have profound social effects (adding and subtracting from the pool of reproductive partners available to others, for example). Rituals head off certain prob lems by digitally marking a specific point in time that relations, which are part of a gradual analogical process, change (Boyer 2001: 248). Boyer argues that the social inference systems of our "downstairs" mental staff are a far more efficient way of dealing with complex processes than rational reflection. Who could calculate all the variables that go into choosing an appropriate mate? Better to rely on "chem istry." But the fact that we do not have conscious access to our social inference systems gives social processes a magical quality. We are sub ject to important forces, the causality of which is real but unseen. "Rituals do not create social effects but only the illusion that they do. When people perform rituals, they combine some ritual gadget—easily acquired because it activates our precaution-contagion system—and a particular social effect—for which they have intuitions but no good concepts—in single package" (Boyer 2001: 255). Finally, the magical aspect of social transformation creates "empty slots" (Boyer 2001: 258). Important changes occur, no one is quite sure how. "Now, an empty slot like that can also be filled by whatever rep resentation you have that could be connected in some relevant way to the unexplained effect. This is why concepts of gods and spirits and ancestors are often activated in such contexts" (Boyer 2001: 258). In other words, our contagion system throws up rituals, which we then</page><page sequence="17">COGNITIVE SCIENCE, BIG THEORY, AND HUME 367 use to mark important social changes. Because the causes of these changes are mysterious, we plug in concepts of gods, which are hang ing around anyway (because of our HADD, see above). As an aside at the end of his chapter on ritual, Boyer warns that this account is speculative, and that there has not yet been enough experimental work done on how people represent gods and what role they play in ritual. I would argue that it is not only speculative, but ad hoc, and that more careful thought is required alongside more exper imental work. The whole chapter has the feel of a Kraft recipe: boil noodles (contagion system generates anxious repetitive action); add but ter and milk (social processes seem mysterious); finally add cheese packet (sprinkle on gods who are hanging around). While it is possible that the fastidiousness and anxiety about correct performance that is associated with much ritual could be related to a cognitive device that protects us against contagious hazards, this is an awfully shaky scaffolding on which to support the massive weight of human ritual practice. More troubling is the difficulty these theorists have in accounting for why superhuman agents are present in ritual. Ritual begins to appear as a kind of add-on to the true core of reli gion, which is ideas. My own hunch is closer to that of Roy Rappaport's, that it is more likely that ritual predates and may be the cause of much religious belief (Rappaport 1999). Certainly ritual's widespread existence in the animal world indicates that it is not implausible that ancestors of humans were performing rituals before they were communicating religious ideas. None of these writers would deny that. Yet having begun with religious ideas, they do not have a satisfactory way of explaining how rituals are related to these ideas. The issue goes deeper than merely trying to bring together MCI agents with ritual action. The concept of agency underlying Boyer's theories will make it difficult ever to connect concepts and actions. I will return to this argument in my discussion of anthropology (#3) below. There is a similar split between ritual and ideas in McCauley and Lawson. One cannot, however, fault them for this. Their theory begins with the fact of action and its mental representations, and shows what happens to representations of actions if superhuman agents appear in them. Though they cite the research about MCI ideas, how these ideas arise or find their way into the "religious conceptual scheme" (agents and actions available to the action representation system, analogous to a lexicon) and from there into ritual is not a part of their formal the ory. This is to say that they do not pretend to have a big theory of</page><page sequence="18">368 THEODORE VIAL religion. Rather, they carefully delineate a sub-set of what generally falls under that category, and take theoretical aim at this subset. Whitehouse comes closest to a full theory that accounts for all the facts of religion. Though he does not say how we get from MCI agents to maximally counter-intuitive agents, his theory at least takes this distinction into account. The two modes of religiosity provide the institutional support necessary for memory of and motivation to trans mit complex concepts that do in fact commonly show up in what we call religion. The origins of ritual are not explained, but once taken as a given Whitehouse explains why they take the shape they do. Furthermore, Whitehouse is able to link the two modes of religion to the organization of religious institutions (hierarchical or not), forms of leadership and authority, types of concepts and their exegesis, and the relation of all this to the structure of the political community. There are some technical challenges to Whitehouse's use of semantic and flashbulb memory (Atran 2002: 159-64; McCauley and Lawson 2002; 48-64). These are serious since his entire theory rests on the founda tion of these two mnemonic processes. Nonetheless Whitehouse accounts for many of the facts of religion that others either do not or do not do successfully. The great lacuna in the modes theory is a description of the many ways the modes interact. Whitehouse has isolated one pat tern of interaction in his brilliant ethnography Inside the Cult (Whitehouse 1995). Many religions do not, however, fit this pattern, and in his attempt to construe them as following this pattern, he is sometimes led into historical misconstruals. I have written more about this elsewhere (Vial 2004). The greater cognitive enterprise, then, has more work to do in accounting for the range of superhuman agents found in reli gions, and in accounting for religious ritual in all its diversity. Anthropology (category #3). At the root of the unsatisfactory accounts of the wider range of religious phenomena is a thin and unreflective anthropology, another of the categories handled well by past good big theories. More specifically, while cognitivists receive high marks for epis temology, they have not spent as much time as did Hume, Durkheim, and Freud considering more broadly human nature, human motiva tion, and human agency. This shortcoming has wide ramifications. As Lawson and McCauley write, "[s]ince all rituals are actions and only agents act, our command of the category of agency (and the inferences that accompany it) is the single most important piece of ordinary cog nitive equipment deployed in the representation of religious rituals. The notion 'agent' is fundamental in any theory of religious ritual, because it drives our most basic expectations about the form of any action" (McCauley and Lawson 2002: 23). Children recognize agents at a young</page><page sequence="19">COGNITIVE SCIENCE, BIG THEORY, AND HUME 369 age, adults detect agency where there is none, the presence or absence of a superhuman agent in the agent slot of ritual action determines many ritual features and even the balance of a religious system. And yet there is a gap between the importance of agency to the cognitive science of religions and any serious consideration of the tremendous work in our understanding of human agency across many fields in recent decades. (For example, see in philosophy Taylor 1989; in soci ology Joas 1996; in anthropology Flumphrey and Laidlaw 1994.) In the absence of a fuller explicit discussion, the clues scattered about the cog nitive literature point to a kind of default Cartesian dualism. I do not think that the people under consideration here would defend a Cartesian model of human agency, but exactly this model underlies much of their work. When humans act, do they always first formulate a mental repre sentation, and then will to bring this representation into action? Though Barrett acknowledges that sometimes action precedes thought (Barrett 2004: 62-63), he makes this point only in passing in order to account for ritual—if I'm actually doing something about this idea, then the idea must be fairly important. The difficulty that Barrett and Boyer run into accounting for ritual is a by-product of their focus on religious ideas. But it is difficult to see how certain religious actions follow from religious ideas. This dualism comes to the fore in many passages in Jason Slone's Theological Incorrectness, a kind of summaiy of the field (with applications) (Slone 2004). Slone writes about "belief and its corresponding behaviors" (viii). "'Cultural' ideas have causal powers only insofar as ideas are cognitive representations and cognitive representations, because they have physical properties, cause behavior" (4). Human action, however, is best understood if we do not separate act and intention so absolutely. Our intentions often become clear only because we act, our ideas are often products of our acts and not vice versa, the two seem to inhere in each other (Taylor 1975 and 1989). Charles Taylor calls this model of human action "directed" or "qual itative," as opposed to the Cartesian model (Taylor 1985). Our minds are not ghosts in the machine. Our downstairs staff, so critical in the cognitive account of the shaping of our ideas, seems to go on leave in their account when it comes time to account for agency. Feuerbach (another good big theorist) understands better the ramifications of the fact of human embodiment (Harvey 1995: 141-47), as well as the com plex interaction of human thought, feeling, and emotion in human behavior. Note that I am not making an argument against the com petence approach to understanding religious ritual. That process of</page><page sequence="20">370 THEODORE VIAL abstraction has proved invaluable. But one cannot infer from Chomsky's work, for example, that because our language performance depends on a language competence, that therefore the best model for understanding utterances is that we formulate representations of sentences and then use our will to make them public. And a full theory of language must complement Chomsky's generative theory with an account of the situ ation in which we speak and the meaning of utterances. Often we blurt things out. It is usually in the attempt to express in thought or writ ing that the ideas we are trying to bring out are clarified and shaped. Language competence is stored in individual minds, but language is irreducibly social. I am arguing that our gain in knowledge by abstract ing ritual competence from ritual performance does not justify the assumption that in action, including ritual action, what happens is that people read off their representations as blueprints that their actions put into play. Human agency requires more than competence. It is important to recall how young the cognitive science of religion is. It was launched in 1990 by Lawson and McCauley's book on ritual. Much of the empirical cognitive basis has been driven by the work of Justin Barrett, a psychologist, whose work only began to appear in 1996. It may, then, simply be too early for this approach to attempt a comprehensive theory of religion. That does not stop it from claiming to have done so (see Pascal Boyer's Religion Explained). Some of the grander claims for its achievements may be in danger of crowding out honest and hard reflections on the comprehensiveness of what has been done so far, reflections that will be the stimulus to further success.
