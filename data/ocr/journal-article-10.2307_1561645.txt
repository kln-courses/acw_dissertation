<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS IN THE DISSOI LOGOI Deborah Levine Gera Recent scholarship has stressed that it is not useful to speak of Greek scientific experimentation in sweeping fashion. The Greeks did perform scientific experiments, but the quantity, quality, and areas ex- plored varied over different periods. Thus, while at certain times such testing procedures flourished, at other times very few actual experi? ments were performed. So, too, certain fields were more fruitful or feasible for experimentation than others.1 Those who tend to play down the quantity and quality of Greek scientific experimentation usually point to the Greeks' preference for speculation and theory over obser? vation and performance of manual tasks.2 Thought experiments allow the mind to range freely without leaving one's armchair or getting one's hands dirty, and that may be why such mental tests were favored by Greek thinkers, from Xenophanes onward. My purpose here is to study two thought experiments found in the Dissoi Logoi in conjunction with several related trials found in Herodotus, Xenophon, Plato, and Xe? nophanes. All these thought experiments make use of hypothetical hu? man beings and deal with educational and ethical matters. Generally speaking, these hypothetical tests contrast two types of people, either individuals or larger groups, in an attempt to determine the roles played by heredity and environment in the acquisition of knowledge and moral values. It is notoriously difficult to arrive at a precise definition of thought experiments,3 and the following is meant to be no more than a working definition. Thought experiments are, first of all, experiments.4 In ancient !See G. E. R. Lloyd 1991; von Staden 1975. 2See, e.g., J. O. Thomson, quoted in G. E. R. Lloyd 1991, 75. 3Note, e.g., the wide variety of approaches found in the various essays in Horowitz and Massey 1991, and see too Souder 1998, 3-4, and the further references there. 4For thought experiments as a subset of the larger category of ordinary experi? ments see Sorensen 1992, ch. 9 and passim.

In a thought experiment these steps are carried out in thought, in the laboratory of the mind.7 The thought experimenter visualizes a situation, mentally carries out an operation, and then sees, in the mind's eye, the results. A Gedankenexperiment is not actually performed, either because there is no need to do so?common sense, intuition, or experience is sufficient to supply the results of the procedure?or because the test is one that cannot, in fact, be executed in the real world. Such experiments are not intended to prove fanciful, unlikely theories, nor are they meant to yield results which are intrinsically implausible. Generally, thought ex? periments are carefully imagined scenarios, which are convincing both because they have some basis in empirical observation and because they use specific details, often colorful ones, to appeal to the audience's intuition.8 These well-conceived tests teach us new things, even though their execution does not supply us with new empirical data of any kind. Let us begin by looking at one such hypothetical trial in the Dissoi Logoi, an anonymous sophistic composition, written mainly in Doric, which is generally dated to the beginning of the fourth century.9 This 5See G. E. R. Lloyd (1991, 71): "The role of the data obtained from many tests is not so much to decide between theories judged antecedently to be of equal standing, as either to corroborate the author's own view or to refute that of an opponent" (italics his). He is describing here experiments actually performed by the Greeks, but his words apply to Greek thought experiments as weil. 6Cf. Sorensen 1992, 211: "Experiments are procedures. Procedures must have a number of steps." 7The phrase is that of Brown (1991). This is not to say that thought experiments cannot be executed at other times?see below, discussion connected with notes 29-31. 8See Norton 1991 on such particulars as comprising one of the main characteristics of thought experiments. 9This date is not without its problems: see Conley 1985 and cf. Robinson 1979, 34- 41, which includes a useful survey of earlier scholarship on the Dissoi Logoi.</page><page sequence="3">TWO THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS IN THE DISSOI LOGOI 23 brief work is comprised of nine chapters, often presented in the form of double (or opposing) arguments, on subjects such as good and evil, jus? tice and injustice, truth and falsehood, etc. Of these, chapter 6 discusses whether wisdom and virtue can be taught, and here the anonymous au? thor touches upon the acquisition of language, while contrasting sys- tematic teaching with informal instruction. He argues that we learn lan? guage and are not born knowing it, and offers an imaginary skeptical opponent the following proof of his claim (ai 6e xooi \ir\ moxov eoxi... yvcbxco ex x(ov6e, 6.12): if one were to send a newborn Greek infant off to Persia and raise him there, without his hearing Greek, he would speak Persian; and if one were to bring a Persian baby to Greece, he would speak Greek (ai xig ei*8i*g yevo^ievov jtaidiov eg ITeQoag &amp;Jto- jte^iipai xai xr]vet xqcc(J)oi, x&lt;D(j)6v eEXkaboq (jxDvag, JteQOi^oi xa* al' xig XT]v68ev xfji5e xo^ii^ai, eXXavi^oi xa, 6.12). Brief as it is, this test points to the various stages of a thought ex- periment. After stating his initial thesis?that language is acquired, not innate?the author imagines a hypothetical situation in which a Greek child is transported immediately (ei*8i*g) after birth to Persia. The next stage involves raising this infant. The hypothetical child is to be brought up in Persian-speaking surroundings, with the added proviso?a con? trol for the experiment?that he hear no Greek speech (xo)(j)6v cEXka- 5og (jxDvdg). The original thesis can now be put to the test, by deter- mining which language the child uses. The result, states the writer, is clear: the Greek-born child will speak Persian. Interestingly, our author includes an additional control: a second experiment precisely parallel and complementary to the first, in which a Persian baby is to be sent to Greece and will then end up speaking Greek. Each of these two experi? ments acts as a check for the other, strengthening and confirming the results of the parallel trial. It is also worth noting that the experiment can be performed by anyone (xig) and, we might add, at any time on any random, hypothetical child, male or female. Such randomness and repeatability is a sine qua non of a thought experiment and of actual, scientific experiments as weil. The experiment is phrased as a less vivid future condition, with ei and the optative in the protasis, and the optative and xa (the Doric dv) in the apodosis (ai xig ... djtojt8|iii"ai xai... xqcc(()ol ... JteQai^oi xa* al' xig ... xofxi^ai, eXkxvi^oi xa), and this is the syntax regularly used in thought experiments. While the test is clearly meant to be hypothetical and our author is not suggesting that babies actually be sent off to for? eign environments, the experiment could, in fact, be performed. This is</page><page sequence="4">24 DEBORAH LEVINE GERA an instance of a test which need not be carried out in actuality. Thinking about it is enough. This experiment yields even richer results than those noted by the author himself. His immediate purpose is destructive, for he uses the ex? periment to refute the contention that words are innate (cf. emoxa^ievcoc; a^ia ytveoBai, 6.12), but the actual test proves a great deal more and leads to constructive results as well.10 Thus the experiment demonstrates that the language one speaks has nothing to do with race or blood, for speech is acquired from one's surroundings: changing a child's environ- ment will lead to a change in his native speech.11 Language does not arise from within, nor is it taught by a specific teacher; it is imparted by the surrounding community as a whole. Indeed, as the author notes, it is impossible to single out specific teachers of speech (xcbg didaoxccXcog ovk loafxeg). The Dissoi Logoi betrays the influence of various fifth-century au? thors and sophists of the first generation. Scholars are generally agreed that Protagoras influenced this sophistic work both in structure?that is, in the use of opposing, antithetical arguments?and in content.12 There are also several specific resemblances, including verbal echoes, between this section (chapter 6) of the Dissoi Logoi, which deals with the teach- ability of virtue, and Protagoras' views as presented in Plato's Protago? ras. In fact, the argument that we learn language without knowing who our teachers are is used by the sophist in that dialogue. Protagoras points to the analogy between learning political virtue and learning Greek: both are acquired from the community at large (Prot. 327e).13 The echoes of Plato's Protagoras found in the (presumably) earlier Dissoi Logoi would seem to indicate that Plato's sophist is expressing the views of the actual Protagoras, who influenced our anonymous author.14 Could our 10In the terminology used by Brown (1991, 33-34, 43-45) it is a "platonic" thought experiment, simultaneously destructive and constructive. 11 See Desbordes 1987, 35-36. ?See Gomperz 1912, ch. 8, for a detailed discussion, and compare Guthrie 1969, 316-19; Robinson 1979, 54-59. Kerferd (1981, 54, 84-85) argues that the technique of op? posed arguments was part of the general sophistic movement and not confined to Pro? tagoras, so that there need not be a direct link between Protagoras and the Dissoi Logoi. BSee Robinson 1979, 57, 216 (ad Diss. Log. 6.11), on the verbal echoes between Pl. Prot. 327b-328d and Diss. Log. 6.11-12: both use the words eiK|yur|g, eXXavi^eiv, ixavog. There are parallels between Diss. Log. ch. 6 and Plato's Meno as well: see Taylor 1911, 114-19. 14See Guthrie 1969, 64 with n. 1.</page><page sequence="5">TWO THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS IN THE DISSOI LOGOI 25 thought experiment derive from Protagoras as well? It is tempting to think so, but there is no hard evidence to support this supposition. In any event, the Platonic Alcibiades draws a similar parallel between learning language and learning justice. He states that from earliest child- hood onward he learned to speak Greek just as he learned of justice and injustice, from the many. He, too, cannot point to any one person as be? ing his teacher of language (Alc. LllOd-llla). A particularly interesting influence on our thought experiment is an experiment reported by Herodotus (2.2): the notorious attempt by the Egyptian king Psammetichus to determine humankind's first lan? guage. Psammetichus handed over to a shepherd two newly born chil? dren, chosen at random (jtai6icc bvo veoyva dvBQaxrtoov xcov emxuxov- xo)v, 2.2.2).15 The herdsman was ordered to raise them by themselves, in an isolated hut (ev oxeytl $? ?QWT\ &amp;&amp;' ecouxcov, 2.2.2), bringing in goats to supply them with milk and otherwise tending to their needs. No one was to utter a sound in their presence. Psammetichus wished to know which language the children would first speak, once they had done with incoherent babblings (xwv dofmwv xvu^rpdxwv, 2.2.3). When two years had gone by, the shepherd opened the door of the hut one day, and both the children greeted him with outstretched arms, uttering the word bekos (ftexog). Psammetichus discovered that bekos was the Phrygian word for "bread," and consequently he and his fellow Egyptians con- cluded on the basis of this trial (cf. xoioikcp oxcc9|iriod|ievoi JiQ\\y\kaTi, 2.2.5) that the Phrygians were the oldest people. The supposition underlying the Egyptian king's experiment is that language is innate.16 More specifically, Psammetichus seems to have thought that the first or earliest language is innate in children and would be spoken by them when they were placed in the same conditions as those of the earliest people. This first language then points to the oldest people: the most ancient language is spoken by the most ancient people. The anonymous author of the Dissoi Logoi clearly disagrees with Psam? metichus' assumption that language is innate and argues that children ^Salmon (1956, 321-22 n. 3) rightly remarks on the consistent use of the neuter xd Jtcuoia to describe the children?their gender is random as weil. This is also true in the Dissoi Logoi experiment. 16Robinson 1979, 217 (ad Diss. Log. 6.12), calls it "the clearest extant example of an 'innateness' theory of this sort." Compare Borst 1957, 39-40, and see Benardete 1969, 32-35, for an interesting analysis of the various assumptions behind Psammetichus' ex? periment.</page><page sequence="6">26 DEBORAH LEVINE GERA learn their speech from their surroundings. His thought experiment seems to be a reaction, in part, to the Egyptian's test,17 which?whatever its historicity or credibility?is presented by Herodotus as an actual, exe- cuted experiment. In almost every respect, our author's thought experiment is the more satisfying of the two trials. For one thing, the results of his experi? ment are far more convincing than Psammetichus' problematic findings. It is highly unlikely that two children placed in such conditions would ac? tually have learned to speak.18 Ancient authors had already noted the possibility that the sound bek was the result of the children's attempt to imitate the bleating of the goats, who supplied them with milk.19 Per? haps that is why other versions of the experiment do not include goats but state instead that the children were fed by women who attended to them in silence.20 Modern scholars point to a further difficulty in Psam? metichus' results. The word bekos can be taken for an Egyptian word,21 and the king would presumably have been more than happy to fasten upon such a resemblance in order to prove the primacy of the Egyptians. Our author's thought experiment not only achieves more plausi? ble results than Psammetichus' actual test, it is also more elegant and more humane, precisely because it does not have to be executed in re- 17The author of the Dissoi Logoi does not refute Psammetichus' experiment di? rectly but rather argues against the idea of language being innate. If the author were to perform the king's trial in thought, he would, I think, contend that if the children heard no language they would not learn to speak, whereas being exposed to goats would lead them to bleat. 18Crystal (1997, 291) lists nearly fifty recorded cases of children of the wild, who were isolated from social contact, and notes that normally such children did not learn to speak. Several more recent inquisitive monarchs are said to have conducted experiments similar to that of Psammetichus. In the trial conducted by Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (13th cent.) the children died; the infants put to the test by Akbar the Great of India (16th cent.) remained mute; in the case of James IV of Scotland (15th-16th cent.) the children were reported by some to have spoken good Hebrew! See, e.g., Sulek 1989, 647-48; Crys- tal 1997, 230, 290. 19Suda (3 229 s.v. PexeaeToive; schol. Tzetz. Ar. Nub. 398a; schol. ad Apoll. Rhod. 4.257-62c. Salmon (1956, 326) notes that even in Herodotus' version the goats are very much present. The historian tells us that they were brought into the children's hut (2.2), which makes us wonder why they were not milked outside, with the youngsters then drinking their milk from a cup. 20See below, discussion leading to note 25. 21 A. B. Lloyd 1976, 10 (ad Hdt. 2.2), refers to one of the Egyptian names for Egypt and the Egyptian word for bread. See also Salmon 1956, 323, and compare Hipponax fr. 125 West.</page><page sequence="7">TWO THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS IN THE DISSOI LOGOI 27 ality.22 A few minutes of thought, based perhaps on an actual acquain- tance with children of foreigners who had learned to speak Greek as their native tongue,23 suffice to undermine the purported results of a trial which is said to have lasted two years or more.24 No real-life infants are torn away from their mothers to be raised in silence and solitude by a shepherd; the young children are simply dispatched to faraway places in our thoughts. All the various versions of Psammetichus' experiment involve cruelty of one form or another. Herodotus himself mentions an alternate account according to which the children were cared for by women whose tongues were cut out: both the caretakers and the young children were damaged by Psammetichus' curiosity. Elsewhere, in other variants, goats are said to have suckled and raised the children, which means that the children had no human contact whatsoever. In another variation, just a single child is brought up in speechless solitude, with? out the solace of the company of another human being. Even the most humane account, according to which the infants' mothers were the ones to raise them, but were ordered to do so in silence, entails mental an- guish for the mothers and deprivation for the children.25 A thought ex- 22It is intriguing to note how closely the Dissoi Logoi trial is echoed in a recent study of modern linguistic thought experiments, in a very similar context. Thomason (1991, 248-49) first mentions Psammetichus' experiment and the ethical problems raised by the king's test and then goes on to suggest a thought experiment which could be used by a linguist to test the theory that children are genetically predisposed to learn a specific language, not just language in general: "Take an infant born to parents of completely ho- mogeneous monolingual linguistic background going back, say, ten generations; remove the child at birth and place him/her with adoptive parents whose own language, and that of the entire surrounding community, is (as far as linguists can tell) completely unrelated to the language of the child's biological parents and ancestors. Linguists will predict that the child will learn the language of his/her adoptive community as fast and as easily as s/he would have learned the language of the biological parents." 231 owe this suggestion to the editor of this Journal, who also notes Herodotus' ob? servation at 2.104.4 in this context. 24In some accounts the experiment is said to have lasted even longer, with the chil? dren first pronouncing the word bekos at the age of three or even four: schol.

The king, we are told, sent Egyptian chil? dren to his Ionian and Carian mercenaries in order to have them learn Greek. This was the origin of the Egyptian class of translators (2.154.2). Psammetichus is of a scientific, inquiring bent, and we hear in Herodotus' History of another experiment conducted by him, an at? tempt to sound the depths of the springs of the Nile.27 He is said to have fashioned a rope thousands of fathoms long, but his sounding line did not reach bottom, leading him to conclude that the springs were bot- tomless (2.28). Herodotus doubts that this experiment actually took place, but he points out that powerful whirlpools and eddies could have prevented the line from reaching bottom. Here, too, the Egyptian king performs an open-ended experiment in order to satisfy his curiosity, but the inference he draws from the experiment's results is again un- convincing. Interestingly, this experiment by Psammetichus can be contrasted with a similar but more successful experiment suggested by Herodotus himself.28 When discussing silt deposited by the Nile, the historian notes that a sounding line let down one day's sail from land will draw up mud at a depth of eleven fathoms. Herodotus' wording here, his use of the generalizing second-person singular and the future indicative, "if you sail... and let down a line, you will draw up mud" (jtQoajtXecov... djtexcov ... xaxeig xaxajteiQTixriQiriv nr\kov xe dvoiaeig, 2.5.2), does not allow us to determine whether such a trial was in fact undertaken. He may simply be reporting a hypothetical test that might be carried out.29 26Cf. Tzetzes (schol. Tzetz. Ar. Nub. 398a), who calls the tongue-cutting version in- human (ov utjv EyXcoaaoTojinaE xa8' Hqo&amp;otov ajtavOoamov y&amp;Q totjto), and compare schol. rec. Ar. Nub. 398e totjto xai 8r]Qi6)&amp;eg. 27Herodotus uses what seems to be a technical word for experiment, didjtEioa, when describing Psammetichus' two trials (2.28.4, 2.15.2); see Christ 1994, 182 with n. 40. Benardete (1969, 41) sees both experiments as an attempt to go back to beginnings. 28Christ (1994, esp. 172, 183) compares the inquiring historian and the experiment- ing king. He discusses at length the love of experiment demonstrated by Herodotean kings; see also Flory 1987, 78, 174 n. 34. 29See Christ (1994, 183 with n. 42), who terms the experiment "hypothetical." He compares two further experiments conceived by Herodotus, thought experiments which could never actually be executed: the diversion of the Nile into the Red Sea (2.11.4) and the reversal of the position of the north and south winds (2.26). The first thought experi? ment has earned Herodotus high marks from modern commentators: see Gould 1989,</page><page sequence="9">TWO THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS IN THE DISSOI LOGOI 29 Actual Greek scientific experiments were often phrased as future con- ditions, taking the form "If conditions of type A are realized, then an event of sort B will occur."30 While such future conditionals were per? haps the normal means used by Greek scientists to design or record their experiments, the conditionals also leave open the possibility that some trials were hypothetical and the experiments recorded were not actually executed. In other words, the same language and syntax could be used by Greek writers for three different kinds of tests: (1) actual, executed experiments, (2) thought experiments, and (3) proposals in? volving a concrete test which has not yet been performed. Such a pro? cedure, if performed, would (unlike a thought experiment) yield new, empirical results. The identical syntax used for all three kinds of exper? iments means that seemingly scientific experiments recorded in Greek writings may simply be hypothetical suggestions.31 At the same time, it seems clear that at least some scientific experiments were performed in the late fifth century and early fourth, the traditional date of the Dissoi Logoi?2 Returning to Psammetichus' linguistic experiment, it is worth not- ing that Herodotus' tale is a study in contrasts: the king's trial and re? sults are incredible, but his methodology is scientific and serious.33 He 86-87, and Heidel 1933,161 (attributing the passage to Hecataeus of Miletus). The second thought experiment, while a vivid analogy, has found much less favor: see Heidel, 160, and cf. Gould, 90. 30Thus von Staden (1975,186), who notes the use of three different kinds of future conditions in the experiments he discusses: (1) the protasis has et with the optative, and the apodosis the future indicative; (2) the protasis has el with the optative, and the apo- dosis the optative with dv; (3) the protasis has Edv with the subjunctive, and the apodosis the optative with dv. 31 See, e.g., the experiment described by the author of Sacred Disease (11.4 Grense- mann; ch. 14 Loeb edition), on performing a postmortem on a goat: "If you cut open the head, you will find that the brain is wet" (f]v oiaxotp'nc; tt]v x?(j)aA,r)v, ?TjQr)oeig tov eyxE- &lt;(&gt;ak)v tjyqov Eovra). G. E. R. Lloyd (1979, 23-24) points out that it is not certain that the writer actually carried out this procedure. Even in more recent times it is not always easy to distinguish proposed experiments from executed ones. Some of Galileo's experiments are interesting cases in point; see Naylor 1989. 32See Ar. Clouds 148ff. and Dover 1968, xl-xli. Compare too the Hippocratic Airs Waters Places (ch. 8). G. E. R. Lloyd (1979, 27 n. 91) dates both AWP and Sacred Disease (above, note 31) to "within about 20 years of the turn of the fifth and fourth centuries." 33This contrast has led (e.g.) Salmon (1956) to argue that the scientific aura sur? rounding Psammetichus is intended to make the king look ridiculous.</page><page sequence="10">30 DEBORAH LEVINE GERA attempts to answer a complex question scientifically, by conducting a controlled, open-ended experiment. He does not know which language the children will speak, and when the youngsters unexpectedly end up talking Phrygian, the king immediately accepts the results of the experi? ment and relinquishes all claims to Egyptian primacy "under the influ? ence of a single empirical counter argument."34 The king's linguistic trial?however unfounded the assumptions behind it, and however un- likely the reported results?is arranged with the utmost care. When performing his test, Psammetichus uses a series of controls, choosing the two children at random, taking them away at a very young age, and carefully isolating them from the sound of speech.35 The author of the Dissoi Logoi makes use of these very same factors in his thought ex? periment, for he too (mentally) removes two infants from their natural habitat, places them in an artificial environment, and isolates them from the sound of certain types of speech, that is, Greek and Persian respec- tively. At the same time, the two experiments make use of the two chil? dren in quite different ways. In Psammetichus' trial, the youngsters are raised together and are presumably meant to stir one another to speech, whereas in the Dissoi Logoi they are sent to separate destinations and each serves to prove one-half of the complementary two-part thesis. Even in Psammetichus' experiment the two children do not, in fact, be? gin to speak by communicating with one another but turn to the shep? herd instead. In other, non-Herodotean versions of the trial, the chil? dren first speak when they address a special emissary sent by the king, after having been kept in isolation for years. The emissary is ordered to enter their hut and observe them silently?yet another careful control. Indeed, in some accounts of the experiment the king isolates only one child, and this does not affect the end result. (Nor should it, if language is thought to be innate.)36 34Sulek (1989, 650), who admires the Egyptian king's astounding intellectual honesty. 35See Salmon 1956, 326; A. B.

One child: see above, note 25. Contrast the use the eighteenth-century linguistic thinker Condillac makes of two such hypothetical isolated children (in part 2 of his Essai sur Vorigine des connoissances hu- maines), to demonstrate how the two children, left to their own devices, might gradually have developed a language; see Stam 1976, 45-50; Harris and Taylor 1989, ch. 10, esp. 125-28.</page><page sequence="11">TWO THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS IN THE DISSOI LOGOI 31 Whereas the two children in Psammetichus' experiment were raised together, and the two children in the Dissoi Logoi are to be raised in distinctly opposite but complementary ways, Xenophon, in another thought experiment, suggests that two youngsters be raised together, but according to very different principles, in order to train them for two con- trasting lifestyles (Mem. 2.1.1-7). Xenophon's Socrates wishes to demon? strate that Aristippus' self-indulgent lifestyle categorizes him as some? one who is fit to be ruled submissively by others, rather than be a leader. The philosopher devises an armchair experiment such that he and Aris? tippus are to train two hypothetical young men, one of whom must be capable of ruling, while the other is to be a willing subject. Socrates runs through a series of qualities involving endurance and self-control and in each case elicits Aristippus' agreement that of the two youngsters it is the prospective ruler who should be trained in these traits. Here, too, an alleged actual experiment may be lurking in the background. The Spartan leader Lycurgus is said to have raised two pups from the same litter to lead two very different kinds of lives, spoil- ing the one and training the other to hunt. He then called together the Spartans and used the puppies in a live demonstration to show how training and discipline form character. When he put a dish of food and a hare in front of the two dogs, the spoiled one ate from the dish, while the trained dog chased after the hare.37 Just as Xenophon uses the two hypothetical young men to bring Aristippus to think about his own way of life, Lycurgus made use of a vivid physical trial to stimulate the Spar? tans to deliberate about their own practices.38 Such use of visual pre? sentation is thought to be a particularly Spartan characteristic.39 He? rodotus' tale (9.82) of Pausanias' ordering that a Persian meal and a Spartan one be placed side by side, after the Greek victory at Plataea, is another such graphic demonstration of two contrasting ways of life: the two meals do not actually constitute an experiment, but Cyrus the Great, who has had the Persians work all of one day and then feast the 37See Nicolaus of Damascus FGrH 90 F56; Plut.

Nicolaus, our earliest source on Lycurgus' trial, is of course much later than Xenophon. 38Interestingly, Lycurgus used two dogs from the same litter in his trial (Nicolaus of Damascus FGrH 90 F56.3; Plut. Mor. 3a-b; compare Mor. 226a) to stress the effect of training versus nature, whereas Xenophon does not stipulate that the imaginary two young men be brothers. 39See Powell 1988; Flory 1987, 105-6.</page><page sequence="12">32 DEBORAH LEVINE GERA next, in order to see if they are willing to revolt against the Medes (1.125-26), is conducting a trial of sorts.40 Such colorful, concrete dem- onstrations of two ways of life are perhaps more compelling than Xeno? phon's theoretical trial, but another thought experiment on the same theme, that of Gyges' ring, indicates that hypothetical trials can be quite memorable as well. The experiment involving Gyges' ring, formulated by Glaucon in Plato's Republic (359b6-362c8; cf. 612b), is one of the most famous ethi? cal thought experiments of antiquity and presents another interesting instance of the relation between an alleged actual experiment and a hy? pothetical trial. Glaucon contends that men are just only unwillingly, simply because they are unable to get away with being unjust. He tells Socrates that the truth of his claim will be more easily perceived if they perform the following actions in their imagination (\iaXioxa av aioBoi- jieGa, ei xoiovSe jtoir)oai|iev xfj Siavoia, 359b6-cl). He suggests grant? ing a just and an unjust man complete freedom to do as they like and then following them to see where desire leads them. Each of the two men, states Glaucon, will be caught red-handed proceeding in the same way, in his own self-interest.41 At this stage of the experiment, the ob- servers, Socrates and Glaucon, are unseen, so to speak, while the just and unjust man perform their actions openly. Glaucon then proposes refining the trial, allowing the just and un? just men complete license by granting each one a magic ring which will make him invisible, a ring akin to Gyges'. Glaucon tells the story of Gy? ges' discovery and use of his magic ring at considerable length, present- ing the shepherd as an investigator and experimenter in his own right.42 After Gyges finds the ring on a larger-than-life corpse, he discovers its magic powers by accident, noting that he disappears when he turns the ring inward and reappears when he turns the ring outward. He then carefully tests the power of the ring (xai tovto evvorioavxa ajtojteiQao- 8ca xov SaxruXiou ei xavxr\v exoi xfiv Sijvajiiv, 360a4-5), experiment- ing by trial and error as he repeatedly turns the ring in and out to be? come visible and invisible by turns. Once he has established to his satis- 40Flory (1987, 174 n. 34) sees this as an instance of the Herodotean motif of the "king's research": see above, note 28. 41 The experiment is set up as a less vivid future condition with ei and the optative in the protasis, and the optative and dv in the apodosis, and conditional sentences of this form recur throughout the passage. 42Cf.

Glaucon stresses Gyges' role as an inquisitive experimenter, perhaps because he is about to suggest to Socrates that they continue their trial and turn the ring round, so to speak. When Glaucon now grants his hypothetical just man and unjust man their magic rings, they are permitted to wander around invisible, while the observers, Glaucon and Socrates, turn visible, as it were, and watch the two figures. What will be the result of this armchair trial? Both the just and the unjust man, Glaucon argues, will behave equally badly, stealing, murdering, and so on. Glaucon's use of magic rings here adds color and life to his hypo? thetical trial and makes it all the more memorable.43 We are struck not only by the ruthless and immoral behavior of the two men, but by their magic invisibility, which allows them to behave in this fashion. Such pic- turesque, telling details which linger in the mind are part and parcel of the more stimulating thought experiments, even if such colorful bits are not necessarily an essential part of the actual trial. So, in modern thought experiments, for example, we remember Maxwell's demon, Schrodinger's cat, Judith Thomson's unconscious violinist, John Searle's Chinese room, etc.44 Glaucon will continue to contrast and compare the just and unjust man, investigating the two opposing ways of life in their purest form, but his further remarks lack the vivacity and immediacy of Gyges' experiment. Glaucon next asks Socrates to imagine two men: one completely just but with a bad name, and another unjust with a good reputation. The just man, he says, will end up tortured and reviled, while the unjust one will have wealth, influence, and power (360e- 362c). Socrates laughs at Glaucon for devising the hypothetical circum? stances so deliberately, polishing and purifying each of the imaginary men as carefully as if they were statues (361d4-6). Although the cre? ation of such a contrived starting point is an important element in set? ting up a thought experiment, Glaucon does not go beyond this initial stage here. Each of his two men is simply assigned a certain way of life with its concomitant qualities and then allotted the fate which logically results from that lifestyle. The two men do not of themselves do any- 43Wilkes (1988, 11) argues against the validity of Glaucon's thought experiment and claims that not enough information is supplied. She asks, for instance, whether the ring makes the men intangible as well as invisible. 44See Sorensen 1992 passim for details of these experiments. Norton (1991) points out that these particulars are not really essential.</page><page sequence="14">34 DEBORAH LEVINE GERA thing, and it is up to the reader to project the intermediate stages of this thought experiment.45 Both the Gyges thought experiment and Xenophon's hypothetical education of two young men are presented in dialogues, so that in each instance the experimenter is outlining his trial to an actual audience. In the Republic Socrates simply listens to Glaucon describing Gyges' test, but in the Memorabilia Aristippus joins Socrates in executing the thought experiment firsthand, agreeing as to the manner in which a fu? ture ruler should be trained. Thought experiments can be performed at any time, by anyone who is willing to use his powers of reflection and imagination, and often an audience is addressed?either implicitly or explicitly?by the person who formulates such a test. The linguistic ex? periment in the Dissoi Logoi, for instance, is phrased as a response to a hypothetical doubter who is virtually invited to think for himself what the result would be if someone were to send a young child abroad (cf. ai 5e xooi [ii] jtioxov eoxi xd ovupaxa pavGdveiv dpe ... yvcbxoo ex xarv&amp;e, 6.12). We often find an appeal to the reader or listener?who is ad? dressed, at times, in the second person?to play a part and collaborate in the experiment.46 "Thought experiments are intended to persuade by reflection on the experimental plan,"47 and contrivers of such trials fre- quently use rhetorical means to convince their audience. We have al? ready noted the similarity, in presentation and syntax, between thought experiments and the scientific experiments recorded in early Hippo? cratic works, and the latter include persuasive addresses to an audience as well. An early experiment on freezing water in Airs Waters Places (ch. 8) is introduced in a fashion similar to our experiment in the Dissoi Logoi, with the reader gently bidden to try things for himself (yvoirjg 5' dv d)5e- ei ydp fJouXei... ey^eag v&amp;wq Getvai... ejteixa ... eoevey- xcbv ... dvapexQeeiv ... ei)QT|oeig ... xoDxo xexpr|Qiov oxi.. .).48 45For this section of Glaucon's exposition (Pl. Rep. 360e-362c) as a thought experi? ment see, e.g., Williams 1993, 98-101; Sansone 1996, 53-55. The latter argues that Glau? con's picture here is inspired, in part, by Euripides' Helen, in which the real Helen lives virtuously in Egypt, maintaining her chastity and uprightness but nonetheless earning a disgraceful reputation. Euripides' play, Sansone claims, serves as a model, a "real-life" experiment, as it were, underlying Glaucon's hypothetical scenario. 46See Souder (1998) on the use of the second person in philosophical thought ex? periments as an invitation to the reader to step into someone else's shoes. He contends that examples framed in the third person also implicitly ask the audience to assume a role. 47Sorensen 1992, 225. 48Cf.

This experi? ment features in the second chapter, which presents the contrasting views held on the seemly (xo xataW) and the unseemly (xo aio^Qov). Our author outlines the experiment twice: once when arguing that aia- Xq6v and xakyv are relative terms (2.18), and a second time when refuting the contention that the two qualities are identical (2.26-28). The thought experiment is first mentioned in an ethnographical context: when attempting to demonstrate that seemliness and unseemliness are relative concepts, the writer describes a series of practices which are thought honorable by one ethnic group and disgraceful by another. Thus, for example, Persians are said to consider incest seemly, while Greeks find such behavior shameful and unlawful (2.15). The author then suggests a hypothetical trial to demonstrate the variety and relativ- ity of values: suppose someone were to order all of mankind to bring to? gether into a single heap what each thinks shameful (ai xig xa aia^Qa eg ev xeXeuoi auvevetxai Jtdvxag dvGQcbjtoog a exaaxoi vo^ovxi) and then to have them take away from this same collection what each con? siders seemly (xai jtd^iv e^ dGrjooov xouxoov xd naka tax|3ev, a exaaxoi dyrivxai); not even one thing, he says, would be left (ovbe ev xa xa^- ^ei&lt;j)9fj^iev). All would divide up everything, he concludes, for not ev? eryone holds the same views (dXka Jtdvxag Jtdvxa 6iatax|3ev. ov ydQ Jtdvxeg xafjxd vo^ovxi, 2.18). As with the previous thought experiment in the Dissoi Logoi, this trial is phrased as a less vivid future condition, with ei and the optative in the protasis, and the optative and xa in the apodosis: al' xig... xe- ^ei3oi auvevetxai... xai Jtd^iv ... tax|3ev ... ot)6e ev xa xaMei(j)9fj^ev (2.18). Here too we find that the author first contrives an initial hypo? thetical situation, next suggests a further action to be undertaken which affects the original circumstances, and then turns to examine whether the result of this action, that is, the result of the experiment, confirms his original thesis. Thus we are first asked to imagine that each and every individual is commanded to bring to a common pile those quali? ties personally considered to be most shameful. Next, in the second stage of the experiment, each is asked to take away from the newly formed pile qualities which are personally regarded as seemly. We can now test the hypothesis that moral judgments are not absolute by ex- experiments in the laboratory, by providing detailed written descriptions of his equipment and procedures; see Cantor 1989, 163.</page><page sequence="16">36 DEBORAH LEVINE GERA amining our hypothetical heap to see if any qualities have been left be? hind. Will there be any unsavory practice which no one on earth consid? ers positive and wishes to take away? The answer, states our author, is no, for every conceivable form of behavior has its supporters. This thought experiment, unlike the earlier linguistic one, must re? main a hypothetical trial conducted in the laboratory of the mind and cannot be executed in reality. Even if everyone in the world could be gathered together in one spot,49 those gathered would not be able to place intangible qualities?their ideas of what constitutes a shameful act?into a heap. Yet there is something colorful and vivid in this image of people first piling up their incorporeal "wares" at a common market or bartering place, with each person then carefully examining the mer- chandise before choosing the new commodity to take away from the stockpile. We can readily visualize, for instance, a Greek first depositing incest in the pile, only to be followed by a Persian who finds the prac? tice seemly and bears it away. The notion of displaying qualities, customs, or lifestyles as goods to be chosen in a marketplace appears in other, nonexperimental con? texts as well. One instance is Plato's myth of Er,50 in which souls of the dead are given lots in the otherworld and are then, each in turn as the lots are drawn, allowed to choose for themselves new lives from the "marketplace" of various types of lifestyles (Rep. 617e). The origins of such heaps of intangible qualities may well be the famous image of the two urns of Zeus described in the Iliad (24.527-33). There it is Zeus, rather than human beings, who draws good and evil fates, and he draws from two jars.51 Here, rather than jars, we have one heap which con? tains at one and the same time both good and bad qualities?which is, in fact, the point of the experiment: each quality considered bad by one person is considered good by someone else. The thesis behind this trial, that vopoi are relative, can be traced back to Pindar (aXka 5' aXkoioiv vopipa, otyexegav 8' aivet 8ixav dvdQOov exaoxog, fr. 215 = P. Oxy. 49 In the second version of the experiment, only a limited number of people collect attitudes from the various nations all over the world (ex toov eOvecov jtdvToOEv, Diss. Log. 2.26). 5?See Immerwahr 1966, 320-21 with n. 37. 51 For the ancient debate as to whether Zeus has two jars (one evil, one good) or three (two evil, one good) see Richardson's commentary ad loc. (1993, 330-31). Pandora's notorious jar (Hes. W&amp;D 90-104) should also be noted in this context.</page><page sequence="17">TWO THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS IN THE DISSOI LOGOI 37 2448) and was perhaps a commonplace by the time that the Dissoi Lo? goi was written.52 Yet at the same time, here too Herodotus casts his shadow. The context in which this thought experiment is introduced in the Dissoi Logoi certainly seems Herodotean. We have seen that the experiment follows upon descriptions of a series of unusual non-Greek customs (2.9-17). Many of these practices are mentioned in Herodotus' His? tory,53 and it is possible that the historian was also the inspiration for the theoretical trial found in our sophistic text.54 Indeed, Herodotus de? scribes a similar hypothetical situation of men who are commanded to choose for themselves the finest customs, from a collection of all the world's practices (v6|ioug xoijg xaMiaxoug ex xarv jtdvxoov v6|i(ov, Hdt. 3.38.1). The historian concludes that all men, after careful reflection, will choose their own (6iaaxeipd|ievoi av e^oiaxo exaaxoi xoijg earuxarv), for everyone thinks his own nomoi superior by far. Herodotus' test, pre? sented in the form of a future-less-vivid condition (ei ydQ xig JtQoGeir] ... ex^e^aaGai xe^euoov ... dv e^oiaxo), is a compressed thought ex? periment, with the different stages?collecting the customs, examining them, then choosing one?sketched in outline. His thesis is also some? what simpler than that found in the Dissoi Logoi, for he simply contends that each man will think his own nomoi best. He does not stress the rela- tivity of values, where one man's most distasteful nomos might be an? other man's favorite. (And note that all of the world's customs are col? lected, not just the unseemly ones.) Immediately afterward, however, he tells of Darius' famous comparison of the different burial practices of Indians and Greeks, which is an exceptionally vivid demonstration that very different kinds of nomoi are practiced and respected by different peoples (3.38). The context of the hypothetical trials in the Dissoi Logoi and in Herodotus is, then, virtually identical. Darius' flamboyant pre? sentation of the different nomoi practiced by Indians and Greeks fright- 52See Guthrie 1969,131-34; cf. Heinimann 1945, 71-72, 78-89. 53Compare Diss.

Conley (1985, 60, 64 n. 10), who points out that the parallels between the two texts are not always exact; Robinson (1979, 165-66 ad 2.9), who is skeptical about Herod? otus' being a direct source for the ethnological lore of Diss. Log. 2.9-17. 54Gomperz (1912, 163-64) suggests that both the Dissoi Logoi passage and the Herodotus parallels stem from Protagoras; see also Heinimann 1945, 80-81.</page><page sequence="18">38 DEBORAH LEVINE GERA ens his Indian subjects, and perhaps both our anonymous author and the historian were influenced by the Persian king's autocratic behavior when formulating their hypothetical trials. Both imagine mankind being com? manded or bidden to choose the favored customs and qualities.55 We also find in Herodotus' History two actual communal heaps created at the behest of a king. The Scythian ruler Ariantas commands each of his subjects, on pain of death, to bring him a bronze arrowhead (for census purposes); then he transforms the arrowheads into a huge bronze bowl which serves as a monument to himself (Hdt. 4.81). When Darius leads his army against Scythia, he orders each soldier to place a stone near the river Artescus and then leaves the great piles of stones behind (4.92); the stones could then have been used to count the Per? sian host, but Darius already knows their number (4.87) and the collec? tion simply serves as a monument to him and his great army.56 Perhaps these actual, physical heaps, formed from the contributions of one and all, lie behind the abstract, imaginary ones. In any event, Herodotus elsewhere (7.152.2) mentions yet another hypothetical trial which in- volves the communal collection of incorporeal qualities, and in this case his language is similar to that used by the author of the Dissoi Logoi.57 The historian imagines all men depositing their misdeeds (xaxd)58 into a common pile, with the intention of then exchanging them with those of their neighbors. Each man, states Herodotus, will happily carry back his own transgressions, after taking a close look (eyxvipavxeg) at his neighbor's wrongs. Interestingly, in the Platonic tale of a marketplace of lives mentioned above, Er similarly notes that at the marketplace of lifestyles, the souls generally chose lives in accordance with their previ? ous existence (Rep. 620a). The souls, too, prefer the familiar and known. 55Hdt. 3.38.1, ei yao xig JtooOein Jt&amp;ai dvOoamoiai... xe^eixov, and Diss. Log. 2.18, ai' xig... xe^eijoi... Jtdvxag dvOoameog.

In his language experiment, the anonymous writer suggests sending a Persian child to Greece, in addition to dis- patching a Greek child to Persia, as a parallel and complementary step. Each half of the two-part experiment then serves to reaffirm and re- inforce the other. In the thought experiment on unseemly customs the author could have easily devised a similar companion piece to investi- gate the converse, that is, by having everyone bring honorable qualities to a joint pile and then take away dishonorable characteristics, again leaving no qualities behind on the heap. He does not do so, and the ex? periment thus has no control. And it lacks not only a control, but any sense of rigorousness or any means to prove?or disprove?the "re? sults." While the trial is a lively and colorful presentation of the author's thesis, its outcome is neither wholly intuitive nor demonstrably true. In fact, the author subsequently attempts to overturn these results by out- lining the experiment a second time, in order to argue for an outcome which is the very reverse. The Dissoi Logoi contains a whole series of double or twofold arguments, presenting both sides of various theses, and the author feels free to include the other side, as it were, of this thought experiment as well. When he tries to refute the first results, he does not argue against the original contention behind the trial, that aio- Xq6v and xa^ov are relative terms which vary according to the context, so that what is unseemly for one person may well be seemly for an? other. Instead, wittingly or unwittingly, he substitutes a different thesis to be refuted, namely that aio^QOv and xa^ov are one and the same thing, and then counters this revised argument by stating that the two qualities are distinct opposites.59 In this second account of the thought experiment, he first de? scribes the original test as being presented by others (^eyovxi 5e, dbg al' xiveg xd aio^Qa ... ouveveixaiev, 2.26; compare oipm 5', al' xig xd aio- XQa eg ev xe^evoi ouveveixai, 2.18) and then argues against its supposed results. This time we are asked to imagine several people gathering to? gether unseemly qualities from all nations, and then bidding each per? son to take away what is seemly. The author now argues that people would not take away shameful qualities from such a heap, because 59On this argumentation see Robinson 1979, 172 ad 2.21 (cf. 149-51, 162-63) and compare Barnes 1982, 519-22.</page><page sequence="20">40 DEBORAH LEVINE GERA shameful matters cannot be transformed or transmuted into seemly ones simply as a result of being placed on a pile. He "proves" this con- tention, that what is unseemly or ugly will not turn beautiful, by using a series of hypothetical concrete instances. If people had brought horses, sheep, goats, or other people to such a collective heap, they would not have taken away something else in their stead. Nor would they have taken brass instead of gold, or lead instead of silver. Come now (&lt;j&gt;eQe 5r|, 2.28), he chides his reader, if someone had brought an ugly man, would he then take him away again beautiful?60 If the linguistic experi? ment proposed in the sixth chapter of the Dissoi Logoi elegantly dis- credits an actual experiment performed by Psammetichus, here we find the reverse situation: concrete counterexamples are used as a control, as it were, to gainsay or refute the results of a thought experiment. Al? though these counterarguments refer to actual, material objects?cor- poreal animals, metals, and men?which can, in fact, be brought to a communal pile, unlike the aia^Qd, the intangible, unseemly qualities in the thought experiment, these tests are nonetheless phrased as unreal, counterfactual conditions (e.g., ai yoi3v iJtJtoog r\ (3oog f\ oig r\ dvGQcbjtoog dyayov, ovk aXko xi xa djtayov, 2.27). These concrete counterinstances are, it seems, even further removed from actual execution than the thought experiment, which is expressed as a hypothetical future con? dition. The relation between armchair trials and actual, performed ex? periments is complex. At times, thought experiments lead to real-life tests, while on other occasions, actual investigations inspire thought ex? periments.61 An interesting instance of the dependence of a hypotheti? cal test upon actual experience can perhaps be reconstructed from frag? ments of the works of the poet-philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon, a pioneer in the use of thought experiments.62 Xenophanes objects to anthropomorphic divine beings. He does not like the thieving, adultery, and deceptions which Homer and Hesiod ascribe to the gods (DK 21 Bll; cf. B12), and he criticizes the belief that gods were born or wear clothing or have a voice and shape like humans (B14). In addition, he notes that Ethiopians say that their gods are black and snub-nosed, 60My translation and interpretation of Diss. Log. 2.26-28 is based on that of Rob? inson (1979,113-15, 174-76). 6iSee Souder 1998, 5; Sorensen 1992,11-12, 192-97; Naylor 1989. 62See Lesher (1992, 75-77), who includes DK 21 B2.15-19, B15, B30, B34, and B38 in this category.</page><page sequence="21">TWO THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS IN THE DISSOI LOGOI 41 while Thracians see the gods as blue-eyed and red-haired. He uses this fact to demonstrate that representations of gods are not only anthropo- morphic but ethnomorphic, varying according to the different kinds of worshipers (B16). Having moved from mankind in general to the dif? ferent races, such as Ethiopians and Thracians, he apparently takes his argument one step further, to various species of the animal kingdom. Here he can no longer point to tangible evidence such as poetry or plas- tic art,63 and he turns to an imaginary test, a proto-thought experi? ment,64 to back up his claim that all species portray their gods in their own image (B15). He first establishes a hypothetical situation: we are asked to imagine that cows, horses, and lions have hands and are capa? ble of drawing with them. These imaginary animals can also make the things that men make (xai epya xeXeiv diteQ dv6Qec;) and so presum? ably can create representations of the gods. We now perform our ex- perimental test and investigate how each animal species would portray its gods. Xenophanes replies that horses would draw the forms of the gods like horses, and cows like cows, with bodies similar to their own: animals, too, would portray gods in their own image. Xenophanes' test has all the virtues of a well-conceived thought experiment. His vivid image of cows, horses, and lions drawing the gods with their hands pulls us into his imaginary world and convinces by its very singularity. The use of three different types of animals, where in fact one would have sufficed to prove the point that even nonhuman species would create gods resembling themselves, serves as a control. Each of the three animal species behaves in precisely the same way, thus demonstrating Xenophanes' thesis three times over. At the same time, the diverse shapes of the animals' gods remind us of the tremen- dous variety of deities fashioned by humans. We may laugh at first at the idea of a leonine, equine, or bovine god, but we then realize that the cows, horses, and lions are the precise counterpart of Xenophanes' Ethiopians and Thracians. These imaginary animals are good to think with, for they teach us about ourselves, humans. 63Clement (Strom. 7.22), the source for Diels's reconstruction of Xenophanes' re? marks on the Ethiopians and the Thracians (DK 21 B16), refers to their painting (cf. 6ia- ?a)YQacj)oiJai) the gods in their own image. For Xenophanes' likely acquaintance with Ethiopian mores see Snowden 1970, 104 (with notes, 281-82). 64Xenophanes' statement about animals' drawing gods in their image is not quite a thought experiment according to the criteria outlined above, because it is phrased as an unreal past condition, rather than a future hypothetical one.</page><page sequence="22">42 DEBORAH LEVINE GERA Another fragment from Xenophanes similarly demonstrates rea? soning which is both colorful and hypothetical. If the gods had not made honey, the poet-philosopher states, people would consider figs far sweeter (DK 21 B38). This statement, phrased as an unreal condi? tion, could easily have been east in the form of an imaginary trial, with the inhabitants of a honeyless world first declaring figs to be the sweet- est food and then changing their minds after being asked to taste honey for the first time. Another early philosopher, Heraclitus, supplies sev? eral other instances of hypothetical arguments framed in this man? ner, and these arguments point the way to full-fledged thought experi? ments.65 Xenophanes' skill in formulating armchair trials is not surpris- ing, for elsewhere he shows a genuinely scientific bent, arguing on the basis of the physical evidence of shells and fossils that long ago every? thing was covered with mud (DK 21 A33). Xenophanes was among the first to use thought experiments, but the presence of two such tests in the Dissoi Logoi points to the wide? spread use of these trials by the beginning of the fourth century b.c. The two experiments found there illustrate both the best and the worst fea? tures of thought experiments. The linguistic test in chapter 6 is weil con- ceived and carefully formulated, with a companion piece that serves as a control. It shrewdly casts doubt on the results supposedly obtained in an actual experiment, while at the same time illuminating the process by which children learn to speak a language. The second experiment we have considered, that of the heaps of unseemly qualities (in chapter 2), lends the sophist's argument color and immediacy but exposes the Achilles' heel of thought experiments: their lack of rigor and absence of concrete findings. One cannot, of course, easily overturn the results of an actual experiment, but our author has no difficulty in reversing the outcome of his hypothetical experiment. Indeed he may have deliber? ately constructed a test which was less than rigorous precisely because he wanted to argue both sides of a question. Since thought experiments do not provide tangible, empirical results, they are particularly suscepti- 65See G. E. R. Lloyd (1979, 68-69), who refers to Heraclitus frr. 7, 23, 99; one should, perhaps, add to this list as well Heraclitus' famous complaint against Xenophanes (DK 22 B40), that much learning does not teach intelligence; see also Lesher 1992, 75 n. 2. Rescher (1991) includes all of these instances (and more) in his discussion of the Pre- socratics and thought experiments, but his definition of thought experiments is quite broad and encompasses virtually any kind of hypothetical reasoning.

Irvine 1991, esp. 153-56.</page><page sequence="23">TWO THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS IN THE DISSOI LOGOI 43 ble to the sophistic stratagems favored by our writer, who frequently and blithely changes arguments midstream. Most interesting of all, per? haps, is that he finds thought experiments such a useful means of argu? ment. These hypothetical tests are clearly one of the tools of the soph- ist's trade, an instrument he readily deploys. Scholars are agreed that the anonymous author of the Dissoi Lo? goi is not an original thinker but rather a compiler who summarizes the debates and controversies of the first generation of sophists. It seems likely that his use of thought experiments comes from them as well.66 The thought experiments he presents?whatever their sources?and the analogous trials found in Herodotus, Xenophon, and Plato indicate that in the realms of education, psychology, and ethics, thought experi? ments were a popular means of argument in classical Greece.67 Hebrew University of Jerusalem e-mail: Gera@h2.hum.huji.ac.il BIBLIOGRAPHY Barnes, J. 1982.
