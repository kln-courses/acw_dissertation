The great project of a scholarly, annotated English translation of the complete History of al-Tabari in almost 40 volumes is quickly nearing completion. The initiators of the ambitious project, especially Ehsan Yarshater, are to be congratulated. The voluminous translation work will make this vital history of the background, rise and early development of Islam widely available to non-Arabist historians and scholars and, by its annotation will certainly, gready facilitate its use also by historians reading Arabic. As is to be expected in a collective work, the volumes are not entirely equal in reaching the best standards of scholarly achievement to be hoped for. The differences are not wholly due to the individual translators. They also reflect the quite different problems posed by various parts of al-Tabari's history for translation and analytical annotation. Altogether, however, the volumes make a substantial contribution to historical scholarship. Volume VIII deals with Muhammad's career approximately from the Battle of the Trench to the Conquest of Mecca. Michael Fishbein offers a substantial and informative Foreword, careful translation and perceptive, adequate annotation. Al-Tabari relies here mainly on Ibn Ishaq and al-Waqidi, evidendy the best sources for the period available to him. Fishbein points out (p. xxi) that al-Tabari uses al-Waqidi cautiously and rarely quotes him fully. An English translation of al-Waqidi's Kitab al MaghazT thus remains desirable to complement Ibn Ishaq's and al-Tabari's history of this period which has otherwise been relatively well studied. P. 25,1. 16: [b. Hisham] should read [b. cAmr].</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 443 Volume XVI, dealing with the beginnings of ?AlT's caliphate and the Batde of the Camel, is one of the most problematical sections of al-Tabari's History. Al-Tabari relies here largely, though not exclusively, on a highly controversial source, Sayf b. cUmar. Sayf's Arabic is irregular, difficult and at times obscure. Prym's edition of the text was based on a single manuscript, and various scholars have endeavoured to emend it here and there. Sayf s account of the history of this period is frequently in sharp conflict with the main historical tradition, which is quoted by al-Tabari only sparingly, and his bias and outright fiction-writing are here more pronounced than in the previous sections because of the emotionally charged disagreement among Muslims in judging the first inter-Muslim war. This should have been discussed in a proper introduction and in the annotation by drawing attention to the accounts of the main tradition. Adrian Brockett offers only a one-page Foreword in which Sayf b. TJmar is not mentioned. The reader may be referred to the introductions of volumes X and XI by F. Donner and K. Y. Blankinship for an assessment of Sayf's history. For a most recent, highly critical note on him see P. Crone in JRAS (1996), pp. 237-40. In spite of Brockett's efforts to establish the most reasonable readings of the Arabic text, his translation is often doubtful or incorrect. The annotation is also in quite a few places erroneous or inadequate. Only a few instances can be noted here. P. 4, n. 30: The al-Zuhri from whom Yiinus b. Yazid al-AylT transmitted is the famous Ibn Shihab, not eUbayd Allah b. Sa?id, a direct informant of al-Tabari. P. 6, 11. 12-14: "Zayd b. Thabit ... twice called out, 'Ansar! Be helpers of Allah!" The correct translation is "Zayd b. Thabit... said: 'Ansar, be helpers of God twice.'" Zayd meant that the Ansar, who had been helpers of God in the time of the Prophet, should now be so again in support of the caliph eUthman. P. 24,1. 12: arib bi l-harb does not mean "warmonger", but skilful, cunning in war. P. 32, 1. 12, p. 129, 1. 15: sdca in early Arabic often means a moment, or a short while, rather than "an hour." P. 49,11. 6?7: "we did not want to destroy that tradition." The correct translation is: "we did not want the reign (=the caliphate, hadha l-amr) to be lost." P. 52, n. 356: The transmitter from TJmar b. Sacd was not al-Husayn [b. Nasr], but his father Nasr b. Muzahim. P. 81, n. 542: cAwn was, as correctly noted by Prym in his footnote to the text, the brother of Muhammad b. Jacfar, not his uncle. P. 90, 1. 6: "was all she was ordered." In the text the word amarat is correctly vocalized as active: "All she ordered was ..." P. 157, n. 1012: Not Muhammad b. Abi Bakr, but ?A'isha was being sarcastic. P. 177, n. 1084: The nisba of Sahl b. Sacd was al-Sa?idi, not al-Shahrazuri. Volume XXXIX, containing biographical notes on Companions of Muhammad and their Successors, is a supplement, not a part, of al-Tabari's History. Only excerpts of the original are extant. They may well have been compiled by a Shi?ite, as indicated by the occasional curse on Mu'awiya (p. 63), Shi?ite formula of blessings for Fatima (p. 80), and some distincdy Shi?ite traditions (e.g. pp. 99, 146, 155). If these were part of al-Tabari's Supplement, it would signify a substantial shift from his strongly anti-Shi ?ite position in the History. Ella Landau-Tasseron offers a good discussion of the contents and purpose of al-Tabari's Supplement in her Foreword. Her translation is generally smooth and accurate, although there are occasional slips. The annotation of this part, requiring the identification of an immense number of individuals, was evidently a daunting task. Whenever possible, Landau-Tasseron provides a few biographical notes with references to other sources. Here, too, there are some lapses in reliability. Only a few notes can be given here. P. 4, n. 6: Jacfar b. Abi Talib was a cousin of Muhammad, not his uncle. P. 28 and n. 126: L. states here that al-Zubayr and Talha, according to the prevailing versions, were killed after the Batde of the Camel by ? All's supporters and adds in her translation to al-Tabari's statement that they were killed in the batde: [in the aftermath of]. This is erroneous on both counts. According to the common account, al-Zubayr left the battle at the beginning of it and was killed near Basra by a man of the Mujashi? of Tarnim, who had left the town because they were neutral between the camps. Talha was murdered, when the side of ?Ali were gaining the upper hand, by an arrow-shot of the Umayyad</page><page sequence="3">444 Reviews of Books Marwan b. al-Hakam fighting on the same side as he. The fact of this act of vengeance for Talha's involvement with the murderers of the caliph 'Uthman was confirmed by later Marwanid propaganda. It is noteworthy that al-Tabari here supports the common account stating that Talha was killed by Marwan, while his main source in his History, Sayf b. ?Umar, tried to hide the fact, claiming that Talha was killed by a stray arrow. P. 104, n. 498: That Ya'la b. Umayya (or Munya), after serving the first three caliphs, "joined 'AlT", is not well attested. It is certain that he was one of the leaders of the Meccan revolt against 'All and that he financed the campaign to Basra with money he had collected as governor of the Yemen. According to a late source, he died fighting on All's side at SiffTn against Mu'awiya. This is not entirely unreasonable since he had at the beginning of the Meccan revolt accused Mu'awiya in a poem of having failed to aid 'Uthman and of aspiring to the caliphate, warning Talha and al-Zubayr against joining him (see Sayf b. 'Umar, K. al-Ridda ..., ed. Qasim al Samarrai, Leiden 1995, pp. 268?70). Ya'la was, however, definitely not killed at SiffTn as the source has it (followed by Brockett, p. 29, no. 183, who correctly mentions Ya'la's fighting on the side of 'A'isha in the Battle for the Camel). See Ibn Hajar, al-Isaba, s.v. Ya'la b. Umayya. P. 148, 1. 11: ft ahsani sura should not be translated "in the most wonderful way", but "in the most beautiful shape." The text quoted is a well-known hadith often adduced by the defenders of an anthropomorphic concept of God. Pp. 182?4 and 304: The name Juwayriyah, diminutive of Jariya, should not be spelled Juwayriyyah. P. 193 and n. 841: Sa'Td b. al-'As was not governor of Medina during the first fitna. The report quoted confuses Sa'Td b. al-'As with his son 'Amr al-Ashdaq, who was governor of Medina at the beginning of the second fitna in the years 60-61/680-1. The report is by Hisham b. 'Urwa about ^ari) Asma?, not by her, as the translation suggests. The valiant mother of the rebel 'Abd Allah b. al-Zubayr, blind in her old age, hid the dagger under her pillow in order to protect herself from Syrian soldiers breaking into her house. P. 225 and n. 978: The translation of jityan as "people belonging to the futuwwah orders" is anachronistic. Such orders did not exist in the time of al-Hasan al-Basri. At most one could think of unorganized individuals with futuwwah ideals. P. 232, n. 1007: 'AlT b. 'Abd Allah was not "head of the 'Abbasid movement." That movement was initiated only by his son Muhammad, as correctly stated p. 235, n. 1023. P. 234, 1. 21: "'AlT b. Zayd": the text has correctly Zayd b. 'AlT. P. 286, n. 1302: The 'Abd al-Ashhal were not a KhazrajT clan, but belonged to the Aws, as correcdy stated p. 302, n. 1369. Wilferd Madelung</page></plain_text>
