<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Meaning and Significance of the Human Analogy in Francesco di Giorgio's Trattato LAWRENCE LOWIC Washington University, St. Louis This paper examines Francesco di Giorgio's use of the human analogy to explain the values and objectives of architectural design. It traces the changing significance of the analogy and its treatment in the diferent versions of his treatise. In the process it evaluates the influence of Vitruvius and other possible sources in the shaping of his thought. By placing Francesco's use of the analogy in the context of a continuing tradition of speculative thought and the intellectual climate of his own day, it seeks to demonstrate more fully the meaning and function of the human analogy in his architectural theory. IN THE DIFFERENT versions of his architectural treatise, be- ginning with the earliest complete manuscript, Saluzziano 148 (before 1486), and concluding with the substantially revised Magliabechiano ii.I.z41 (after 1493), Francesco di Giorgio Martini often employs the human analogy to explain the principles and design methods of the building art.' To date, most studies of Francesco's writings have assumed that his use of the human analogy was largely dependent on the example set by Vitruvius and was motivated by a desire to formulate a contemporary architectural theory based primarily on all'antica principles. Ob- vious discrepancies with Vitruvius' text in Francesco's treatment of the human analogy, particularly in his discussion of the or- ders, have been taken as evidence for the conclusion that his aspirations far exceeded his actual capacity to understand or interpret adequately his Roman mentor.2 Such appraisals, based on narrow standards of correctness that might be expected of an antiquarian, tend to obscure the originality of Francesco's thought and the wider range of implications and meanings which the human analogy had in his treatises. Consequently, they also have failed to recognize the influence that other textual sources may have had on his interpretation of the analogy as well as his particular reading of Vitruvius. The Human Analogy and the City Throughout Saluzziano 148, Francesco's acknowledged au- thority concerning architectural principles and the human anal- ogy is Vitruvius. In Chapter I, he cites Vitruvius, the example of the ancients, and nature as justification, when he likens a fort to the head and the city to the body of a human figure. Francesco further generalizes the analogy, citing the Vitruvian example of Dinocrates' reshaping of Mt. Athos into a human figure, I am particularly indebted to Professors George Hersey and Richard Betts for their criticism of earlier versions of this paper. i. Saluzziano i48, Biblioteca Reale, Turin, with its variants in Ash- burnhamiano 361, Biblioteca Laurenziana, Florence, and a collated version of Francesco's revised text consisting of S.Iv.4, Biblioteca Communale, Siena, and Magliabechiano 11.1.141, Biblioteca Nationale, Florence, have been published in Francesco di Giorgio Martini, Trattati di architettura, ingegneria e arte militare, ed. Corrado Maltese, 2 vols., Milan, 1967 (here- after cited as Trattati). The precise dating and attribution of these two major versions of Francesco's treatise still remain a matter of some debate. On these questions see Maltese's "Introduzione" to the Trattati; Gustina Scaglia, review of the Trattati in the Art Bulletin, LII, 1970, 439-442; Richard J. Betts, "On the Chronology of Francesco di Gior- gio's Treatises: New Evidence from an Unpublished Manuscript,"JSAH, xxxvi, 1977, 3-14; F.

Pietro Marani, 2 vols., Flor- ence, 1979. Note too that the authorship of the illustrations to Fran- cesco's treatises recently have been called into question. On this point see Gustina Scaglia, "Autour de Francesco di Giorgio Martini ingenieur et dessinateur," Revue de l'Art, XLVII, 198o, 7-25, with earlier bibliog- raphy. 2. Several studies have assessed the value of Francesco's use of the human analogy as an instrument of design. See Henry Millon, "The Architectural Theory of Francesco di Giorgio," Art Bulletin, XL, 1958, 257-261; Richard J. Betts, "The Architectural Theories of Francesco di Giorgio," Ph.D. diss., Princeton University, 1971, 51-99; J. Eisler, "Re- marks on Some Aspects of Francesco di Giorgio's Trattato," Acta historiae artium academiaescientiarum hungaricae, xvII, 1972, 193-231. Betts, "Chro- nology," 6-12, feels that Francesco had only a limited understanding of Vitruvius in Saluzziano 148, while Howard Burns, "Quattrocento architecture and the antique: some problems," Classical Influences in European Culture A.D. 500-i500, ed. R. R. Bolgar, Cambridge, 1971, 269-287, extends this judgment to include Magliabechiano 11.1.141. But in the same volume T. Buddensieg, "Criticism and praise of the Pan- theon in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance," 259-267, has under- scored the consciously critical spirit in which Francesco approached the study of antique monuments. Paolo Marconi, "Teorici d'architettura del Rinascimento: traduzione medievale e traduzione Vitruviana," La cittd come cittd simbolica, ed. Paolo Marconi, Rome, 1973, 51-122, has suggested a rich set of cosmological associations in the human analogy specific to western speculative thought, while Giorgio Muratore, La cittd rinascimentale: tipi e modelli attroverso i trattati, Milan, 1975, esp. 99- i27, 197-229, has drawn attention to the interesting similarities between a variety of oriental texts and their illustrations and Francesco's treatise. However, both these studies fail to assess the meaning and significance of the human analogy specific to Francesco's architectural theory. 360</page><page sequence="2">LOWIC: HUMAN ANALOGY IN FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO'S TRATTATO 361 4? . ? ?? :.-F f:.i-~-.tJlhfl I;.b.l!~P1 ii-bf i ~, .?i;nkli- n\riJ:,ri~r. ja?irfrxrr "ILWllrhr X,:rrlr*?.~f;rp ti ,., t?-a i?I ~b~;;*iGilrS Q%: E.~:::'~`:"it~-i:i .?^*`II ??;- .;;~'- ?'~-?~I, fi'l'l4L ~?i(~~l: ?il' i,.li; r* S, t.hl*iU F~L~X:UX~ t~fit, ?;;"??r~ ;^-- p-,.~ .~,,Xki~: I;: Jsu+v t~~ ~w*blr ?I-a,,, F:~j~- d~~a: ?fx~~~ ?~p.

He begins by citing the well known proposition, taken from Vitruvius' discussion of symmetry in temple design, that the human body in an extended position, depending on the dis- position of its limbs, describes in space either a circle or a square. Unlike Vitruvius, however, Francesco uses this idea as justifi- cation for employing these perfect geometric figures as the basis of his city plans. He thus advances his interpretation of the analogy beyond the principle of simple mimesis he employed in Chapter I to include far more abstract forms of comparison in which particular geometric figures are understood to embody the principles of arrangement and measurement generic to the human body (Fig. 2).4 The order and arrangements in the city plans which Francesco describes are also necessary to their proper functioning.

Indeed, he repeatedly stressed the rela- tionship of architecture to nature, drawing on various interpre- tations of the commonplace, including that of the imitation of nature, to support his own design precepts.8 However, as in most other ancient and modern sources, both the meaning of imitation and its objects in nature were variable in his text. For the most part, Vitruvius used the human analogy to explain and justify the aesthetic value of symmetry, a salient feature of the classical style that is fundamentally associated in his analysis of architectural principles with the column and with peripteral temples. Even generalized to include all columnar architecture, his use of the analogy provided no precedent for attaining the social and functional ends posited for the city by Francesco.9 It seems probable that the social and functional implications of the human analogy, as imperatives of city design, were sug- gested to Francesco less by Vitruvius than by a rich tradition of political and philosophical literature which had consistently found correspondences between animal or human bodies and the state. Ancient writers such as Plato and Cicero described the human body as if it were a fortified city,10 while Aristotle compared the order and proportion of the state to an organic or animal body." In a Christian context, Augustine and later authors like Thomas Aquinas felt that the original unity of mankind and the ideal of social harmony were most appropri- ately symbolized by Adam. And human nature has nothing more appropriate, either for the prevention of discord, or for the healing of it, where it exists, than the remembrance of that first parent of us all, whom God was pleased to create alone, that all men might be derived from one, and that they might thus be admonished to preserve unity among their whole multitude.12 These and other variants of the idea appeared throughout a long speculative tradition extending down to Francesco's time in which man, regarded as a microcosm, was associated with dis- cussions concerning the nature of the state. Within this tradition the common property of the state, cosmos, and microcosmos was order. Their relationship to one another was sometimes characterized as that of similitudine, a term which, like Fran- cesco's use of the vernacular guisa, designated a likeness or sim- ilarity ranging from the most abstract and indirect to near literal correspondence.'3 Starting with John of Salisbury, the state was often conceived of specifically as a human body.14 In the i5th century this an- 5. Trattati, I, 20, lines 13-20. In reality Francesco goes on to rec- ommend simple geometric figures such as the pentagon for his plans, I, 20, lines 21-29, lines 1-27, which he feels will generate designs that simulate the order and proportional relationships of the body: ". . . tutti con ordine e conseguenzia proporzionatamente corrispondano." 6. Trattati, I, 21, lines 27-31, which conclude: "... cosi come sono le partizioni drento e fuore del corpo necessario compartire ciascun membro della citti al supprimento, venusti e governo d'essa." 7. See Vitruvius, 1.5-7, who stresses that cities should be laid out in circular forms. 8. For example, it is often noted that art imitated nature in terms of functions, processes, or appearances; that it ministered to, comple- mented, or perfected nature; that it used nature's materials; and that nature was an artist. Concerning these ideas see Anthony J. Close, "Commonplace Theories of Art and Nature in Classical Antiquity and in the Renaissance," The Journal of the History of Ideas, xxx, 1969, 567- 586; "Philosophical Theories of Art and Nature in Classical Antiquity," The Journal of the History of Ideas, xxxII, 1971, 163-184. Vitruvius states that art imitates nature in the design of temples, ii.i; in the orders, Iv.2.6; in public buildings, v.5; Introduction and v.ii; in theaters, v.2.8; in making machines, x.i.4. He also suggests that nature is an architect, IX.I.2; that art takes its materials from nature, IIn..9ff; and that art perfects nature, VI.2. 9. Vitruvius' different approaches to the imitation of nature is evident in his use of the human analogy for temple design, 111.1.1-9, as contrasted to his use of the revolutions of the heavens as a model for machines, x.I.4.

Discussing the relationship of secular and religious authority within the state, he compared the priesthood to the soul of the body, with various parts of the ecclesiastical hierarchy corre- sponding to members of the body, the pope as the head and the rural clergy as the feet. In a similar fashion he likened civil authorities to the body's tissues such as the bones, nerves, and flesh, with the emperor as its corporal rather than spiritual head.15 This method of analyzing institutional relationships per- sisted well into the i6th century in a political literature which often expressed ideological preferences through the particular location assigned to the heads of church and state.'6 To these sources which assuredly influenced Francesco's use of the human analogy as a model of formal and functional order, one must add others that provided ample testimony, beyond Vitruvius' account, concerning the physical perfection and beau- ty of the human body. For instance, Augustine had found in the structure of man's body a conjunction of the functional and the beautiful that led him to speculate which had been given primacy in its creation.17 He finally decided the question in favor of beauty, a point of view congenial to Francesco's generation, some of whom increasingly interpreted Genesis 1:26 to mean that man was created in God's image and likeness as the apex of physical creation. Of the 15th-century humanists who con- sidered the dignity of man and who took this view, Giannozzo Manetti was among the strongest in praising man's physical form. Pondering the venerable image of man as a microcosm, Giannozzo concluded it was self-evident that the external fea- tures of man's body, as a divine fabrication, comprised the most beautiful and admirable form in creation.'8 In the final analysis, Francesco's application of the human analogy to the end of achieving social order, utility, and beauty in city plans was predicated on a long and continuing tradition of received opinion. In this context, he sought to use Vitruvius' text, the sole ancient authority specifically devoted to architec- ture available in the i5th century, as a means of more appro- priately justifying the analogy within its new speculative setting of architectural theory, rather than within that of political or philosophical discourse. The Design of Churches and Columns In Saluzziano 148 nearly half of Francesco's chapter on churches is taken up with a paraphrase of Vitruvius which conflates his definitions of architectural norms with his classification of tem- ple forms. Francesco omits from this overdrawn rehearsal the portion of Vitruvius' text which dealt with the application of the human analogy to ancient temple design.19 Nevertheless, he begins his own discussion of modern church types by as- serting that basilican plans should have the form and measure of the human body. He extends the analogy to include cruciform plans, but suggests simple geometric figures such as the circle and square for central plans. Where he applies the analogy, individual parts of the church are literally understood as iso- morphic to parts of the human body. He also describes and illustrates how lines should be drawn from the sense organs of the head in the plan to surrounding chapels in the choir, and from the fingers of the hand to radiating chapels at the ends of each transept (Fig. 3).20 Francesco's application of the human analogy to church de- sign was limited and owed surprisingly little directly to Vitru- vius. It was undoubtedly dictated by an exegetical tradition which had associated the analogy specifically with basilican and cruciform churches. Originating with Paul (I Corinthians 12:12- 14), the church as a community was conceived of as an organic body, a similitude of the mystic body of Christ. By the 12th century, the term Corpus Christi mysticum was extended beyond its original reference to the Eucharist and was applied to the idea of the church as a temporal institution. It was argued that the church was supreme among bodies politic and no less con- crete than these bodies on the political and social level. In this context, writers such as Aquinas, for instance, referred to the corporate body of the church as a likeness (similitudine) of the human body.21 Moreover, an architectural locus for this notion had emerged from the exegesis of Noah's ark (Genesis 6:I5-22). Within this 15. For Cusanus' use of the human analogy see Morimichi Watanabe, The Political Ideas of Nicholas of Cusa with Special Reference to his De Concordantia Catholica, Geneva, 1963, i8off. 16.

He excludes here III.I, symmetry in temples and in the human body. 20. Trattati, 1, 45, lines 8-30: "... .

De Docta Ignorantia, Nicholas Cusanus had already added to the idea of man as a microcosm the assertion that Christ was its necessary and ideal realization.24 Taken together with patristic and humanist glorifications of man's physical form, these ideas associated with the ark con- stituted the rationale for the application of the human analogy in the design of basilican and cruciform churches. These were two important contemporary types which Francesco alone among 22. Starting with the allegorical exegesis of Philo, the ark's propor- tions were often compared to those of the human body. On this tradition see Jack P. Lewis, A Study of the Interpretation of Noah and the Flood in Jewish and Christian Literature, Leiden, 1968, 156-167. Augustine, The City of God, xv.26, carried the idea further, associating them with those specifically assumed by Christ in his carnal form. Even more literal Christological interpretations were elaborated in the Glossa Ordinaria, as cited by R. L. Milburn, "The 'Peoples Bible': Artists and Commen- tators," The Cambridge History of the Bible, 3 vols., Cambridge, 1969, 11, 280-308. Comparisons between the ark and the human body were still being made by such late scholastic commentators as Henry of Langen- stein. For instance, see Nicholas Steneck, Science and Creation in the Middle Ages: Henry of Langenstein (d. 1397) on Genesis, Notre Dame and London, 1976, 127. 23. On this description see Torgil Magnuson, Studies in Roman Quat- trocento Architecture, Rome, 1958, 206-208, and the Appendix, 360; Car- roll Westfall, In This Most Perfect Paradise: Alberti, Nicholas V, and the Invention of Conscious Urban Planning in Rome 1447-55, University Park and London, 1974, 120-124; Arnoldo Bruschi, "Introduzione," Scritti rinascimentali di architettura, Milan, 1978, XLIV-XLVI. As both Westfall and Bruschi point out, Manetti makes clear that an exact imitation of the ark's proportions was not possible in the new basilica, but it was nevertheless a likeness (similitudine) of the ark and the human body. 24. See Nicholas Cusanus, OfLearned Ignorance, trans. G. Heron, New Haven, 1954, "'.3-5; Allers, "Microcosmus," 379-383. He concluded that only in the incarnation of Christ could there have occurred the maximum spiritual and physical perfection necessary to the idea of man as a microcosm raised to the maximum level of perfection.</page><page sequence="6">LOWIC: HUMAN ANALOGY IN FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO'S TRATTATO 365 41--- A ~,.~ t.~ ~., ?. i?~ !?.rl~?,? ? ;I- ? :': r?-(-p- 1P i???(?? 4 1 -44 ;; '???~C 71??L- ir~(- fi. ???-f,?l. ~?r ?ns;~ r; ilor-" r??I~~' ? 1????~?'?: (r?i r r;?? ??~?? ?

All this was also compatible with Vi- truvius' treatment of the human analogy in ancient temple de- sign.

His use of the microcosm also undoubtedly suggested some of the spiritual implications that both Filarete and Manetti, each in his own way, had previously ascribed to man's projection of himself onto the cities and buildings that he created.27 25. In contrast to Francesco's inclusive coverage of all contemporary church types, Alberti prescribed the central plan as the only acceptable type for modern practice, while the principal churches of Filarete's ideal city of Sforzinda were likewise central, Greek cross plans. For Alberti's preference for the central plan, see Rudolf Wittkower, Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism, New York, 1965, 3-10. For Filarete see John Spenser, "Filarete and Central Plan Architecture,"JSAH, xvin, 1958, io-i8; Peter Tigler, Die Architekturtheorie des Filarete, Berlin, 1963, 75-80; L. Grassi, "Introduzione," in Antonio Averlino detto Filarete, Trattato di architettura, eds. A. M. Finoli and L. Grasi, 2 vols., Milan, 1972, lxxvii-lxxx. 26. Francesco's figure of a man with lines extending from the sense organs and hands is a variant of well known illustrations of the micro- cosm. Initially, he may have encountered this type of image in the notebooks of Mariano Taccola early in his career. There he would have discovered a proto-Vitruvian image of man inscribed in a complex framework of regular geometric figures which was clearly associated with the idea of the microcosm. See Frank Prager and Gustina Scaglia, Mariano Taccola and His Book 'De Ingeneis', Cambridge, 1972, 167-169 and Fig. 9. For visual representations of the microcosm see Harry Bober, "The Zodiacal Miniature of the Trbs Riches Heures of the Duke of Berry: Its Sources and Meanings," Journal of the Warburg and Courtald Institutes, xI, 1948, 1-34. 27. Trinkaus, In Our Image, 246, points out that man's beauty seems to imply for Manetti the possession of an awareness of beauty which is projected into his works, just as man was regarded as a projection of divine beauty. Filarete, Trattato, I, 26, lines 21-24, feels that man, made in God's image, participates in God by making something in his own</page><page sequence="7">366 JSAH, XLII:4, DECEMBER 1983 Something of the same play between ancient precedent and contemporary ideas even informs Francesco's treatment of the column in Saluzziano 148. Although he begins his chapter on the column by recounting in rather crude form Vitruvius' ex- planation of their origins in emulation of distinct hyman types, his primary focus is really the process of discovery and imitation based on nature's principles.28 Most of this chapter actually ex- amines contemporary column and pilaster types. Francesco points out that imitation has extended beyond the proportions and general correspondence of parts abstracted from the human body to include the literal imitation of animal bodies and even trees as appropriate models for the ornamentation of contemporary column shafts and capitals (Fig. 4).29 In his chapter on materials and dwellings Francesco provides still further arguments for the use of the human analogy which augment those already posited in his discussions of column forms, churches, and cities. He loosely paraphrases Vitruvius' expla- nation of the origins of the first dwellings, to which he adds his description of the body's proportions and the derivation of units of measure and perfect numbers from its parts. In the course of this exposition Francesco notes the role that the discovery of nature's principles, invention, and imagination played in bring- ing the art of building to perfection by endowing it with beauty, grace, and proper measure. Francesco concludes by asserting that the primary exemplar of these characteristics is the human body; moreover, he maintains that all buildings should emulate the human body in their design.3o However, the only further demonstration of this general prescription beyond those already discussed is the application of the analogy to the design of a church facade and an entablature, neither of which add appre- ciably to his argument (Figs. 5-6).31 In the final analysis, then, most of this imaginative collection of passages drawn from Vitruvius is clearly intended to provide an ultimate justification for the human analogy that locates its use in the origins and historical development of architecture itself. As such it is a pendant, in the realm of practice, to the theoretical and speculative arguments concerning the relation- ship of art and nature that informed his use of the human analogy, as well as his interpretation of Vitruvius, throughout the other chapters of Saluzziano 148. Francesco and Aristotle In the last known version of his treatise, Magliabechiano 11.I. I14, Francesco significantly reduces his reliance on Vitruvius as a justification for his ideas and further circumscribes his use of the human analogy. While he now makes explicit many of the speculative ideas that had implicitly shaped his earlier reading of Vitruvius and his interpretation of the human analogy, all of these ideas are integrated with, and modified by, a larger spec- ulative framework based on an essentially Christian interpre- tation of the teachings of Aristotle and his followers. The result is a treatment of architecture that is more consistent and illu- minating than that of Saluzziano 148.32 It is the Aristotelian approach to the analysis of art, nature, and their relationship to one another that Francesco adopts in Magliabechiano II.I.141 which is ultimately responsible for the changes brought about in his use and justification of the human analogy. His analysis of architecture is guided by a consideration of its material, efficient, formal, and final causes: ... because each agent or maker only works for attaining some good end, as testifies Aristotle in the second book of his Physics, similarly it is necessary that the architect is moved to build or work only for that which results in some utility or glory to man.33 image. By this he really means that all measures and proportions were drawn from man, but not as in Francesco's case that plans and elevations of buildings correspond exactly to the forms and proportions of the human figure. On this point see Grassi, "Introduzione," LV-LVII; Tigler, Architekturtheorie, 46-68. 28. Trattati, I, 56-60. Cf. Vitruvius, Iv.X. Francesco begins his ac- count by stating: "E da sapere in che modo l'origine e ragione delle collone prima trovato fu." In recounting how the proportions of the original Doric and Ionic columns were derived from distinct human types, Vitruvius made clear that judgment, taste, and imagination had led to further modifications over time and also had given rise to new types such as the Corinthian. He concludes his brief discussion of the origins of ornament, IV.2.6, noting: "For in all their works they pro- ceeded on definite principles of fitness and in ways derived from the truth of nature." 29. Trattati, I, 61-66: "... Quelli che a corpo di vaso cosi sono da fare con ornati e stretti voluti, dalfine, spiritelli, animali e simili, in modo che quantunqu'el vaso netto ed espidito sia, questi tali ornamenti oltre alla venustrai sostegno fanno.... E le colonne che a guisa di due tortuosi e connessi arbori si fanno, lomache chiamate sono, le quali li antichi finsero arboro che d'alcuna radice e rami generati el pie d'esso circulando andasse, e le foglie sue ornando copre. E massime dagli Egizi molto esercitata fu." 30. Trattati, I, 67-69, lines 1-24. See esp. 68, lines 1-3, where he concludes his discussion of origins by stressing the process of discovery and refinement: "Dipoi per continuamente frequentare, pih si sono assottigliati, in tal modo che perfettamente l'arte dello edificare con belti, gentilezza e misura trovata s'e." He then goes on to discuss the derivation of measures and perfect numbers from the body ending with the suggestion that these same measures be used in all building, 69, lines 21-24: " . . che dell gionture dell'omo el numaro trovato sia de'membri separati a tutta la belleza del corpo con rata parte di pro- porzione e misura. Resta che noi pigliamo le medesime nelle compo- sizioni di tutti li edifici." Cf. Vitruvius, II.i and III.1.2, 5-9. Francesco omits 111.1.3, the renowned passage on man inscribed in a circle and square. 31. Trattati, , 90o, lines 5-32-91, lines 1-26. 32. In the preamble Francesco acknowledges a continuing debt to Vitruvius, but delimits his principal obligation to columns, bases, corn- ices, and some proportions of temples and palaces, Trattati, H, 297, lines 5-12. 33. Trattati, 11, 301, lines 4-8: " ... perch6 ciascuno agente o fattore solo opera per consequire qualche bono fine, come testifica Aristotele nel secondo della sua Fisica, similmente e necessario che lo architettore si mova ad edificare overo operare solo per qualche utilita o gloria all'omo consequire." Francesco also refers to Physics, I, i84a, in asserting that inquiry must proceed from the general to the particular, Trattati,</page><page sequence="8">LOWIC: HUMAN ANALOGY IN FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO'S TRATTATO 367 This approach takes as its point of departure the nature of man. It is man who is the efficient cause of architecture, human nature the determinant of its final cause, and both together, in keeping with the teachings of Aristotle, are primary factors relating to the character of its formal cause.34 Throughout the prologues to individual chapters of his trea- tise, Francesco develops cumulatively a description of man that combines Christian and Aristotelian elements and ultimately influences his use of the human analogy as he relates it to his analysis of causes. Francesco's characterization of human nature takes as its fundamental premise the 15th-century humanist and Christian theme from Genesis that man was created in the image and likeness of God. As a temporal being he is the most noble and learned of corporeal creatures, unique among them in living by art and reason.35 He claims that as a microcosm, constituted of the mineral, vegetable, animal, and spiritual elements of the universe, man contains within himself the general perfection of the world. Although created naked, without protective cov- ering, and lacking natural defensive weapons possessed by other creatures, he nevertheless is able with his intellect, reason, and his hand, a unique organ, to provide for himself all of his needs. Indeed, having to perform more tasks than other creatures, his body exhibits more specialized organs and is more symmetrical than theirs.36 But most importantly, man is unique in the great chain of being in possessing an immortal soul which links him in a particular way to his Creator.37 To all of these attributes of man Francesco adds the power of invention that his mind possesses. It is an attribute especially critical to his analysis of causes and, consequently, to his delin- eation of ends and means in architectural design. Francesco argues that man is superior to other creatures as a builder because of his limitless capacity for invention.38 He also points out again and again that the human mind, through its faculty of imagi- nation, gives man the ability to envision the infinite aspects of a design even though these are only partially conveyed to him through his senses by means of the limited mechanisms of draw- ings or words.39 Moreover, through the faculty of imagination man is able to conceive countless variations of any design. Imag- ination thus extends rational thought towards the infinite and gives the mind access to it.40 Almost unique among x5th-century writings on the visual arts, Francesco's assessment of the mind's power of invention views this power as a function of the spiritual nature of man, of his reason and soul, that links him directly to God. Inherent in this conception is the transcendence of nature through the exercise of man's creative imagination: ... in the power of his mind, which his arts and tools almost infinitely varied demonstrate to us, and the speculative sciences it considers, certainly it is judged to be above all the corporeal natures general and corruptible....41 11, 299, lines 3-7. The Physics is one of the principal works in which Aristotle explains that knowledge of nature is derived from an under- standing of its causes: material, efficient, formal, and final. See Aristotle, Physics, trans. R. Hope, Lincoln, i961, nI, I94a-95b, 98a-200oob. For Aristotle, art, including the practical art of building, imitates or com- pletes nature's work. See Close, "Philosophical Theories," 170-175. 34. On the interrelationship of causes in Aristotle, and the primary importance of final cause, see W. D. Ross, Aristotle, New York, 1959, 74-78; John Herman Randall, Jr., Aristotle, New York, i960, 123-133, 178-181, 227-229; Abraham Edel, Aristotle and His Philosophy, Chapel Hill, 1982, 65. This type of approach left open the possibility that differing definitions of final cause for individual building types might lead to entirely different criteria by which their formal cause might be formulated and judged. Thus, for instance, the Vitruvian norms of propriety and economy, Vitruvius, 1.2.5-9, might be prerequisites for the design of dwellings, as indeed they appear to be in Francesco's treatment of them, Trattati, 1, 369-413. 35. Trattati, 11, 414, lines 6-II, which begin: "La umana natura, a similitudine et immagine del fattore suo produtta.... " 36. These points are extracted and re-ordered from the first section of the prologue to Francesco's chapter on the city, Trattati, n, 360-36i, lines 1-31. Most of these ideas have their origin in Aristotle. The notion of man including within his own nature the lower natures, as a micro- cosm, may ultimately derive from the De Anima, 1I, 413a-4i5b. See Allers, "Microcosmus," 347. That man lives by reason, and art, Fran- cesco derives from the Metaphysics, see trans. R. Hope, New York, 1953, I, 98ob. As Edel, Aristotle, 64, points out in Parts of Animals, 687a-b, Aristotle argues that because of his intelligence man alone among all animals has hands. Aristotle also praises the hand as the tool of tools in the De Anima, trans. W. S. Hett, Cambridge and London, 1957, 11i, 432a. See also on this section of Francesco's treatise David Summers, Michelangelo and the Language of Art, Princeton, 1981, 294-296, who recognizes its importance within the tradition of art theory in the late i5th century. 37. Trattati, 11, 369-371, lines I-12: In these passages Francesco once again uses the image of man as a microcosm, but this time not only to demonstrate his dignity, but most importantly as part of the argument supporting the immortality of his soul and thus, in a Christian context, his uniqueness and special relationship to God; 370, lines 21-33: "Onde per conclusione tiene s&amp; essere uno piccolo mondo, perche allo essare con le cose inanimate, ha el nutrirsi e cresciare e generare con le piante, ha el sentire con li bruti et ultimatamente la ragione e l'intelletto con li spiriti, intanto che dalli Greci e chiamato Microcosmos, cioe piccolo mondo. Cosi adunque presupponendo l'intelletto umano essare incorrut- tibile, come afferma Cicerone nelle Tuscolane, Platone in piui luoghi e spezialmente nel suo Timeo, et Aristotile nel terzo dell'Anima, si vede essar partecipe di vita sempiterna e vera beatitudine, et oltre a questo s&amp; essere stato produtto come tutte le altre nature da una prima invariabile e perfettissima causa, peroch6 altrementi affermando saria uno processo in infinito; la qual cosa Aristotele nella Metafisica sua demostra essere impossibile." 38. Trattati, HI, 482, lines 26-31-483, lines i-II; 505-506, lines 1-9. Kemp, "From Mimesis to Fantasia," 353-355, first pointed out the novelty of Francesco's conception. 39. Trattati, n, 483, lines 27-31-484, lines i-16; 489, lines 4-29-490, lines '-7; 505, lines 23-31-506, lines, i-9. 40. Francesco clearly makes this point in praising the mind's capac- ities, Trattati, 482, lines 26-31: "La mente de' mortali come perpetua et incorruttibile, in alcuno modo demostra avere in s&amp; virti% infinita, pe- roch6 appetisce essere per tempo infinito, considera al tempo infinito immagina numero infinito in modo che a ogni numero fa addizione, apprende infinite figure, come infiniti possono essere li anguli, contem- pla uno corpo e magnitudine infinita ... ."

For instance, in his Idiota de Mente we learn that the divine mind is the eternal and infinite art which created the universe and is the exemplar for all human making and industry. The human mind reflects this creativity in its active and productive knowing; like the divine mind it is spiritual, immortal, and in its own way infi- nite.42 For Nicholas knowledge is established through likeness: "All things are in God, but there as exemplars of things; all things are in the mind, but there as likenesses of things."43 It is through the soul's use of the senses, imagination, and reason that the mind excercises its assimilating capacities to form and distinguish true likenesses ranging from images of sensible ob- jects to the most abstract forms and logical conjectures.44 Finally, Nicholas observes, using the example of artisan production, that the mind, given its innate God-given powers, sometimes creates independently of any model in nature.45 It is this image of man and his creative powers, composed of both ancient and modern ideas, that guides Francesco's use of the human analogy as he defines the ends and means of archi- tecture as an art in Magliabechiano 11.1.141. In its preamble he claims that the city and its indivual building types evolved his- torically to satisfy needs which were a direct function of man's nature and the ends which human existence seeks. Men first constructed dwellings out of necessity and later, being social in nature,joined together in cities to satisfy further needs including worship, defense, and the economy of labor.46 In the prologue to his chapter on the city he further elaborates on this theme in formulating an essentially Aristotelian definition of the city. He concludes his analysis by asserting that the city serves for its inhabitants the ends of "dignity, utility, and comfort," that is, it should be a united, well ordered, and hierarchically ar- ranged community that will best serve the physical and social needs that human nature demands.47 Having defined the final cause of the city as the satisfaction of man's temporal needs, a function of his physical and social nature, Francesco finds the human body to be the most apt model for the physical arrangement of the city, its formal cause. But now, rather than by recourse to Vitruvius, as in Saluzziano i48, he primarily justifies the use of the human analogy by referring to man's physical perfection as a microcosm and the functional symmetry of his specialized organs. Here, as throughout the Magliabechiano 11.1.141, Francesco uses the term similitudine to indicate a wide range of correspondences or degrees of imitation existing between architectural forms and the human body.48 In infinito, e le scienzie speculative delle quali considera, certamente gui- dica s&amp; essere sopra a tutte le nature corporee generabili e corruttibili ...." Kemp, "From Mimesis to Fantasia," 353-355, locates the origins of Francesco's ideas in Aristotle's doctrine of the intellect. Close, "Phil- osophical Theories," 18o-181, points out that Plotinus' Enneads estab- lishes a precedent for the argument that human creation can perfect or excel nature in Neoplatonic thought. Among the early church fathers Theodore of Mopsuestia maintained, in his commentary on Genesis, that man alone was in God's image and likeness because he shares in the divine power to create by devising new combinations, as constructing a ship, a house or a town; see Beryl Smalley, The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages, Notre Dame, 1964 (reprint of the ist ed., Oxford, 1952), 15. In the i5th century Giannozzo Manetti elaborates on this theme: "After the first new and rude creation of the world, everything seems to have been discovered, constructed and completed by us out of some singular and outstanding acuteness of the human mind. For those things are ours, that is they are human, which are produced by men: all homes, all towns, all cities, finally all buildings. . . . Ours are the paintings, ours the sculptures, ours the arts, ours the sciences..."; cited and translated in Trinkaus, In Our Image, 247. Cf. Augustine, The City of God, XXII.24, who also praises the capacities of the human mind in terms similar to Manetti's. 42. See Nicholas Cusanus, Idiota de Mente, The Laymen: About Mind, trans. and intro. C. L. Miller, New York, 1979, 111.13. See also the introduction, 20-28. 43. Ibid., 111.3. Nicholas uses the term similtudine for likeness and throughout his text the verb assimilare (to liken, to make or become like or similar) as a description of human knowing. On this latter term see the introduction, 22-27. 44. Ibid., 111.7-8. 45. Ibid., ui1.2: "Outside of our mental concept the spoon has no other model. For even if the sculptor or painter takes his models from the things he wants to depict, I do not do so when I shape spoons from wood and bowls and jars from clay. For in this I do not imitate the shape of any natural thing." 46. Trattati, H, 299, lines 8-21-300, lines 1-6: "Dopo questo, perche il primo edificio che all'omo sia bisognodi fare e la casa overo abitazione sua, el sicondo trattato debba dichiarare le parti che alle comode e convenienti abitazione dalle case e palazzi si ricerca, essendo l'omo animale sociabile ne possendo seperato comodamente vivare. El terzo dimostrare debba li concedenti ornamenti de' castelli e citti. E perche l'omo naturalmente e per rivelazione si cognosce fattura della prima cagione, agente et ultimo fine, e con lui avere similitudine, a gloria sua, poi alla congregazione, debba edificare uno tempio et a lui dedican- do .. . .9 47. Trattati, II, 360, lines 21-33, concluding with the statement: "Onde dopo le precedenti norme pare necessario dichiarare quali parti a quelle si ricerchino per decoro, utilita e commodita delli abitanti." Absent from these ends is any overt mention of beauty, a goal which figured in Francesco's earlier writings. See above note 6. Francesco's explanation of city formation as the coming together of families within a single wall as a unified community to establish an economy of labor is ulti- mately Aristotelian in origin. See Aristotle, Politics, I, i252a-I253b; VII, 1328a-I33ib. In the prologue to his chapter on fortifications Francesco gives an extended argument for social hierarchy and unity based on order, Trattati, II, 414, lines 12-26-417, lines 1-5. Among other points he suggests that such a society is by similitude a sign of the ultimate first cause, in the Aristotelian sense the divine power that created the universe. Likewise, he notes that by reason of order the universe is perfect and united. Close, "Philosophical Theories," x68, 174, claims that following the lead of Plato in the Laws, Aristotle alleges in the Protrepticus that the speculative arts of philosophy and legislation copy laws of justice from observation of their eternal paradigms in nature. Aristotle also argues that nature is the cause of order, Physics, VIII, 252a. 48. Trattati, 361, lines 27-33-362, lines x-i8, which follow the pas- sages cited above, note 36: "Onde congrande ragione lo artifice umano debba qualunque suo artificiato da quello come da suo esemplo pigliare la forma in quelle cose che a lui in alcuna parte si possono assimilare.... Ogni volta adonque che aluna parte principale delle citti o altri edifici</page><page sequence="10">LOWIC: HUMAN ANALOGY IN FRANCESCO DI GIORGIO'S TRATTATO 369 the case of the city he compares its principal square, located at its center, to the navel of the body and, alternatively, to the center of a circle.49 For Francesco the final cause of the church is the imperative placed on man, unique in possessing an immortal soul, to pursue spiritual things before all else in life. This he accomplishes through a variety of actions, including the construction of churches, that express devotion and praise of God.50 He leaves no doubt that the church should be the most beautiful building that man constructs in order to serve this end. In his discussion of its formal cause, however, he relies on patterns of mathe- matical relationships for his plans and elevations that are largely independent of the human analogy as he had used it in Saluz- ziano 148. He now reduces all churches to three general cate- gories, based on central, rectilinear, and composite plans. He treats basilican and cruciform plans, with their anthropomorphic associations, simply as special cases of these categories which he adapts to a system of design based principally on the circle and the square. His justification for doing so rests on the epis- temological value of the mathematical sciences, the symbolic meanings they convey, and the alternative definitions of beauty, divorced from any immediate prototype in nature, that his Ar- istotelian analysis makes possible.6Y Moreover, this mathemat- ically based system of design precepts, organized within general categories, is ideally suited to serve the powers of invention possessed by the human mind. It produces diagrams that provide a stimulus for imagining countless numbers of particularized variations of each church type in plan and elevation.52 Unlike Saluzziano r48, where the orders were treated in a separate chapter, in Magliabechiano 11.I.I4I they are made an integral part of Francesco's discussion of church design. He stresses this connection by again constructing out of the his- torical materials found in Vitruvius a narrative that links the temple and column with the origins of architecture. He begins by rehearsing Vitruvius' account of the origins of dwellings, to which he adds that of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian columns and their respective temple types. In reality, all of this is arranged so as to conform with the evolution of building types sketched in the preamble to Magliabechiano II.I.I4I.53 In his detailed dis- cussion of the parts of columns that follows this introductory history, he many times offers substitute rules for those of the Vitruvian orders. These rules of his own invention are gener- alized from a single ideal human type and follow, as Francesco himself indicates, the shop practices of the painter in establishing the proportions of the human figure. By following these stan- dardized rules Francesco is able to simplify the complexities involved in the particularities of the Vitruvian orders and also to achieve something of the same level of generality he attains in his treatment of church plans and elevations.i4 Likewise, he establishes a general pattern for the design of columns from which any number of particularized designs may be devised, whether imitative of antiquity, contemporary types, or personal inventions.55 si possono adattare ad alcuno membro dell'omo, debba avere la medesma proporzione alla citta tutta, come quello membro a similitudine del quale quello e stato guidicato." While Francesco again cites the story of Dinocrates, here, unlike Salluzziano 148, he uses it as an example of similitude and not as a justification for the human analogy. It is also noteworthy that Francesco uses the verb assimilare to describe the process he is suggesting. Along with his use of the noun similitudine, this in- dicates at least an affinity of his views with those of Nicholas Cusanus. See above note 43. 49. Trattati, 11, 363, lines 2-x6. Interestingly, Francesco justifies the human analogy by reason of similitude (cagione della similitudine) because the navel is the site of nutrition and perfection, but claims that the analogy with the circle is the more immediate natural reason (ragione naturale) since all portions of the city should be equally accessible to its main square. 50. Trattati, 1n, 371, lines 27-35, which follow his discussion of the immortality of the soul, cited above note 37. 51. Trattati, 11, 394, lines 30-34-405, lines 1-15. Francesco makes clear the relative status of the human analogy, based on the imitation of nature, in his comments following some purely geometric formu- lations for church designs, 402, lines 24-29-403, lines x-4: ". . . e perch6 e sono molti varie opinioni donde tal partimento abbi avuto origine e principio, e da considerare che molti solerti e speculativi ingegni si sieno affaticati imitare la natura in tutti li esercizi, e da quella hanno tratto le ragioni si come i partimenti e membri del corpo umano.... E trovando molte varie opinioni imparare esso corpo, ho determinato alcuna breve- mente dimostrare." See L. Lowic, "Francesco di Giorgio on the Design of Churches: The Use and Significance of Mathematics in the Trattato, " Architectura, XII, 1982, 151-163, for a discussion of Francesco's mathe- matical treatment of the church and its implications. 52. An idea clearly implict in Francesco's introduction to church types, Trattati, 11, 372, lines Io-i3: "Tre sono le principali spezie di templi, quanto alla sua forma e figura, alle quali infinite particulari figure si possono redurre, secondo infinite invenzioni che nella mente dell'architetto possono occorrere."

In the preamble, 299, lines 8-20, Francesco indicates that the first edifices were dwellings, followed in order by the city and then churches. This represents a decided change from his earlier treatment of origins in Saluzziano 148 where he used the same point of departure, the dwelling, but appended passages on the human figure instead. See above note 30. 54. Trattati, n, 378, lines 1-27-390, lines 1-25. In reality Francesco here offers what amounts to a commentary on Vitruvius, III.3.ii-i2; 111.5.1-i4; Iv.3, which includes many rules of Francesco's own invention or are based on his study of ancient monuments. Burns, "Quattrocento architecture," 275, cites Francesco's treatment of the Doric and Ionic capitals as an instance of his incomplete understanding of Vitruvius. Yet, it is clear from the entire tone of this section that Francesco was not simply intent on transmitting Vitruvius' canon of the orders. Vi- truvius himself could be inconsistent. For instance, his instructions for the Ionic, 111.3, use individual elements that form a sequential chain of ratios, while those for the Doric, Iv.3, use a single module to determine the proportions of all elements. See J. J. Coulton, Ancient Greek Architects at Work, Ithaca, NY, 1977, 65-66. Francesco's rules based on a single ideal figure generalize and simplify this system somewhat. See Trattati, n, 38i, lines 9-23, for a capital; 390, lines i-16, for an entablature; 394, lines 1-7, for facade proportions based on those of an imaginary column. 55. Francesco several times stresses his own inventions for column parts, Trattati, n, 382, lines i4-i9; 386, lines 20-22; 389, lines 23-26.</page><page sequence="11">370 JSAH, XLII:4, DECEMBER 1983 Conclusion Placed within the intellectual climate of his day, both Fran- cesco's interpretation of the human analogy and his use of Vi- truvius appear far less naive and uninformed than is sometimes supposed by students of his architectural treatises. In both Sa- luzziano 148 and Magliabechiano H.I.141, Francesco assumes as a basic postulate of architectural theory and practice the ancient and Renaissance commonplace that art and nature are related. In Saluzziano 148 he interprets this commonplace to mean that in many instances architecture literally imitates nature's forms-- in particular, its most perfect form, the human body. He con- sistently employed Vitruvius' text to support this idea, often joining separate passages from his source in new combinations or placing them in different contexts that extended their range of meaning and application. In doing so Francesco was influ- enced by other ancient and modern speculative sources that also employed the human analogy to explain such things as the nature of the city or the church. In Magliabechiano II.I.141, heavily influenced by the teachings of Aristotle, Francesco's interpretation of the relationship be- tween art and nature is based on the idea that art imitates nature as a process rather than simply seeking as an end the imitation of nature's forms. He now formulates an explanation of archi- tecture through an analysis of ends and means based on the nature of man. From this new viewpoint he emphasizes original creation in architectural design as much as the discovery of nature's principles or the emulation of nature's forms. In this context Francesco uses the teachings of Vitruvius and the human analogy, where appropriate, to delineate means that serve the design goals which his new theory now defines.</page></plain_text>
