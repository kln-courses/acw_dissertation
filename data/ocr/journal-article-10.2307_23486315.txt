<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES THE MATERIALITY OF SIGNS: ENCHAINMENT AND ANIMACY IN WOODLAND SOUTHEASTERN NORTH AMERICAN POTTERY Neill J. Wallis Archaeological examinations of symbolic meaning often have been hampered by the Saussurean concept of signs as coded messages of preexisting meanings. The arbitrary and imprecise manner by which meaning is represented in material cul ture according to Saussure tends to stymie archaeological investigations of symbolism. Ai an alternative, archaeologists recently have drawn on Peirce's semiotic to investigate how materiality is bound to the creation of meanings through the process of signification. This study examines how the symbolism expressed in pottery of the Middle Woodland period south eastern United States, Swift Creek Complicated Stamped and Weeden Island effigy vessels, might be better explained as icons and indexes that were enlisted to have particular social effects. Examining the semiotic potentials of these objects helps explain their apparent uses and the significance of alternative representations of the same subjects. En repetidas ocasiones los estudios arqueológicos sobre el significado de símbolos han sido obstaculizados por el concepto Saussureano que define los signos como mensajes codificados con un significado preexistente. De acuerdo con Saussure, la manera arbitraria e imprecisa por la cual cierto significado se encuentra representado en la cultura material tiende a blo quear las investigaciones arqueológicas que estudian objetos simbólicos. Como alternativa los arqueólogos han comenzado a basarse en la semiótica de Peirce, con el fin de investigar de qué manera la materialidad está ligada a la creación de sig nificados a través del proceso de creación de signos o significación. En este estudio se examinaron piezas de alfarería del sur oriente de los Estados Unidos, provenientes del periodo medio Woodland, de los complejos estampados Swift Creek y esfin ges representadas en vasijas Weeden Island. El objetivo es demostrar que los símbolos expresados en dichas piezas podrían ser interpretados como iconos e índices que fueron establecidos para efectos sociales particulares. Por medio de la investi gación del potencial semiótico de estos especímenes es posible explicar sus presuntos usos, así como la significación de repre sentaciones alternativas de los mismos objetos.

Weeden Island Incised jar, mound near Shoemaker Landing: left, low-relief face and incised body; right, drawing of incising (Moore 1907:439-441). have three-dimensional effigy heads that are affixed to otherwise conventional vessel forms. Finally, there are three-dimensional effigies in which the entire vessel takes the form of an ani mal rather than conforming to the usual shape of a bowl and jar. These categories are merely arbi trary points along a continuum. For instance, some vessels show only partial alteration of traditional jar forms to vaguely approximate the shape of an animal or human body (Figure 6). This continuum reveals the logic of Weeden Island iconography and its connection to Swift Creek Complicated Stamped designs. We see in this continuum the process by which earthenware vessels become agentive subjects—in this case animals and persons—through a limited reper toire of iconic imagery. In the first instance, heads and other body parts are figuratively wrapped around the vessel through split representation; in the second instance, a three-dimensional head or body is affixed onto a vessel; and in the third case, a fully three-dimensional anatomically "correct" body emerges. In all cases, these signs constituted beings rather than merely representing pictures of them. Taking the most common theme of birds, the icons on the vessels signify a bird regardless of whether the vessel takes the form of a bird or merely has a bird head affixed or incised on it. They are all equivalent in terms of constituting birds through synecdoche, indexing a whole being with just one part. Taking account of the continuum of represen tation in Weeden Island art described above, there are perhaps more similarities to Swift Creek Com plicated Stamped designs than is commonly assumed. Comparison of the three most common representations shared by both traditions should suffice to demonstrate the common themes and explore their semiotic divergences. These three themes are the so-called cosmological designs (Snow 1998), whole bodies or heads of animals or humans, and animal or human faces. Beginning with the simplest and most obvious parallel, one type of Weeden Island series vessel not normally considered an "effigy" includes mul tiple compartment trays that frequently contain a central compartment and four lobes or conjoined bowls (Figure 7). Paralleling the symmetry of these vessels are Swift Creek carvings that show four nearly identical elements, often ovals, which surround a central element that is usually circu lar. These "cosmological designs," which Snow (1998) argues may denote the four directions of native cosmologies, are arguably two-dimensional versions of three-dimensional Weeden Island mul ticompartment vessels and vice versa. The Swift Creek renditions can be seen essentially as plan views of the three-dimensional Weeden Island vessels. Supporting this idea are Weeden Island Incised and the closely related Crystal River Zoned Red vessels that show the same technique, but in incising (Figure 8). The second common theme includes animal and human bodies or heads. As noted previously, the spectrum of continuity among Weeden Island effigy vessels, between heads affixed to other wise simple bowls and vessels whose form is entirely dictated by the shape of those organisms, seems to show that they are all equivalent. In fact, a simple head adorno is a synecdoche. No matter the number of body parts depicted, each vessel was transformed into that animal or person rather than merely representing a picture of one. Repre sentations of whole bodies and only the heads of organisms both have their counterparts in Swift Creek designs (Figure 9). For example, there are several instances of whole bodies of birds found in the impressions of Swift Creek carvings and frequent depictions of bird heads. Notably, bird heads (and in some cases, bodies) nearly always appear paired, likely because they are rendered by split representation, in which both sides of the head are displayed at once. Paired bird heads also seem to represent the eyes of Swift Creek "mask" designs, implicating them in complex métonymie</page><page sequence="12">218 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 78, No. 2, 2013 Figure 7.

When bird heads are not fully three-dimensional but, instead, "flattened" onto the surface of ves sels, they are nearly always paired, just like the incised and complicated stamped designs. As Gell (1998:192) has shown in Marquesan art, this sem blance of duplication is actually a method of low relief carving that renders the subject "backless," so that both sides are represented at once. Two bird heads on a single Weeden Island vessel achieve this effect, and they occur most often in low relief. Fully three-dimensional forms, in which the ves sel shape mimics the form of an animal, almost always have a clearly defined head and tail. One rare exception, two bird heads sharing a single body, may prove the rule—this remains a back less design in which both sides of the bird may be viewed at once (Figure 11). Finally, the third major common category includes the faces of animals and humans. In Wee den Island effigies we may be able to distinguish between faces and heads. Heads tend to be fully three-dimensional and typically more generic than faces, which are comparatively low-relief but exhibit more details of expression and identity. Interestingly, detailed faces are fairly rare in Wee den Island iconography and mostly occur in human form (Figure 12). More common in Wee Figure 10. Split representation and bird head tropes. Bird heads as eyes of "masks": (a) Swift Creek, Lower Ocmulgee Valley (Snow 1998:63); (b) Weeden Island Incised, mound near Green Point (Moore 1902:255). Bird heads: (c) Weeden Island Incised, mound near Crooked Island (Moore 1918:551); (d-e) Swift Creek, Lower Ocmulgee Valley (Snow 1998:68). den Island effigies are whole bodies of animals or humans that do not emphasize the particular char acter of faces. In keeping with the iconic empha sis of Weeden Island effigies, detailed faces can be positively identified as humans and are almost always attached to a human body, unlike the very common Swift Creek "mask" designs that depict animallike and humanlike faces that may be tran sitional forms. In sum, many Weeden Island effigy vessels seem to be the three-dimensional versions of many of the same subjects depicted in two-dimensional Swift Creek designs. The Swift Creek renditions of all of these themes are more "stylized" than their Weeden Island counterparts, but similarities in the structures of "transitional" forms indicate their general equivalence. The play of tropes evi dent in Swift Creek forms may depict transfor mations not shown in most Weeden Island vessels, and this is part of their power as signs, as icons of transformation.

In contrast, Weeden Island effigies elided these organic village connections and cir cumscribed indexical connections so that they were limited to pottery specialists and major cer emonial centers. Furthermore, effigies empha sized the iconic as part of dramatic religious performances that were clearly divorced from daily life. This segregation of "sacred" and "sec ular" realms may correspond with other attempts to ease the growing tensions of increasing social complexity (Pluckhahn 2010). This analysis has not addressed directly the question of why particular animals or persons were chosen as the objects of signs—for exam ple, why did vultures or ducks become symbols in mortuary contexts? Such questions often have been tackled in archaeology by drawing on struc tural, symbolic, and cognitive anthropologies that are founded upon Saussurean semiology. In tak ing on the codes and rules of symbolic (i.e., con ventional) meaning that are seen as inherent to material culture, these approaches have failed to address social practice (Preucel 2006:3). While we should not ignore symbol and metaphor, an alter native to the investigation of meaning begins with the premise that signs are created through people's engagement with each other and the object world. Using Peirce's concepts of icon, index, and sym bol, we can investigate the historical processes by which meaning is continually created. A semiotic approach therefore succeeds where purely sym bolic approaches fail, by interrogating the per formative contexts in which the meaning of iconography is constituted. Ideology and sym bolism undoubtedly were implicated in major changes in Woodland period Southeastern North America, such as increasingly large and aggre gated villages, the proliferation of burial mound ceremonialism and long-distance exchange, and escalating social and political inequality (Ander son and Mainfort 2002). By interrogating the semiotic potentials of material objects and asso ciated social practices, this study moves toward a more precise understanding of what things were enlisted to do and how they became significant.
