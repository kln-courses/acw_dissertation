<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EVOLUTION OF THE USE OF TOOLS BY FEEDING ANIMALS JOHN ALCOCK Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195 Received October 8, 1971 The purpose of this paper is to examine cases of tool-using behavior by animals feeding under natural conditions and to dis- cuss the origin, transmission, and subse- quent evolution of this behavior. Hall's important paper (1963) on this subject dealt largely with weapon using by animal species. Van Lawick-Goodall's broad rang- ing review (1970) is devoted entirely to birds and mammals with heavy emphasis on the chimpanzee. I wish to focus atten- tion on feeding tools and to examine these cases from an evolutionary perspective. In addition, I plan to explore the signifi- cance of tool-using behavior by lower ani- mals for an understanding of the evolution of this trait by humans. Hall's central purpose was to debunk the idea that all examples of tool-using are in some way homologous. He was especially successful in demonstrating the illogic of the belief that because humans are intelligent, adapt- able tool-users therefore other species which happen to use tools must also possess spe- cial intelligence and adaptability. How- ever, Hall, perhaps in reaction to the many ludicrously anthropomorphic misconcep- tions surrounding the topic, argues that non-human tool-using behavior is virtually irrelevant for an understanding of human evolution. I hope to make a modest case for the opposite position. A DEFINITION Students of tool-using have had a great deal of difficulty deciding just what should be included in this category. Hall's paper (1963) is based on a definition which em- braces such things as the use of other ani- mals to obtain a goal. Givens (1963) ob- jects, properly I think, that this definition embraces almost all social behavior. Gruber (1969) feels that the use of natural objects "as if they were tools" does not constitute true tool-using which he would restrict en- tirely to humans because only this species skillfully and habitually alters objects for use as tools. This seems unnecessarily anthropocentric. Just when object manipu- lation by primates in agonistic displays becomes tool-using has been hotly debated by Washburn and Jay (1967) and Kort- landt (1967). Finally such diverse be- havior as string-pulling by birds (Thorpe, 1963), nest building by primates and birds (Lancaster, 1968), and web building and net making by spiders and caddis fly larvae as well as case construction by caddis fly larvae (Wheeler, 1930) have been offered as potential candidates for the tool-using category. Van Lawick-Goodall (1970) notes that string-pulling and the like are really only skillful manipulation of objects and materials and not tool-using. Recognizing then that any definition of tool-using behavior is unlikely to satisfy everyone, I prefer one similar to that of Millikan and Bowman (1965) and van Lawick-Goodall (1970). Tool-using in- volves the manipulation of an inanimate ob- ject, not internally manufactured, with the effect of improving the animal's efficiency in altering the position or form of some separate object. This definition would ex- clude all aspects of social behavior and such things as the construction of spider webs. The list of tool-using species which fol- lows is meant to be exhaustive although I recognize the possibility that I have over- looked some rare cases of tool-using be- havior. EVOLUTION 26:464-473. September 1972 464</page><page sequence="2">EVOLUTION OF TOOL USE 465 ANIMAL SPECIES WHICH USE TOOLS WHILE FEEDING UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS Myrmeleon spp. (ant-lions, Neuroptera). Lampromyia spp., Vermilio spp. (worm- lions, Diptera), Wheeler (1930). Sand particles are showered on prey walk- ing by or at the top of a small sand pit constructed by a larva which resides at the bottom of the pit. The sand is propelled by a head throwing movement and has the effect of knocking prey to the bottom of the pit. Toxotes jaculatrix (and other members of the genus?, archer fish), Luling (1958, 1963). Water droplets are shot at terrestrial prey from the mouth of the fish knocking insects and spiders off vegetation onto the surface of the water where they can be easily cap- tured. Cactospiza pallida (woodpecker finch), Lack (1947), Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1961). Cactospiza heliobates (mangrove finch), Curio and Kramer (1964). Certhidea olivacea (warbler finch), Hundley (1963). Geospiza sp.? (ground finch), Hundley (1963). Twigs, cactus spines, and petioles are used to dislodge prey hidden in crevices and cavities of dead and decaying trees. The trait is performed frequently by C. pallida, occasionally by C. heliobates, and very in- frequently by the other two species. Hamirostra melanosterna (black-breasted buzzard), Chisholm (1954). There are several reports of this hawk car- rying rocks and dirt lumps into the air and dropping them onto eggs, especially of the ground nesting emu. The birds feed on opened eggs. Neophron percnopterus (Egyptian vul- ture), van Lawick-Goodall and van Lawick (1966). Some vultures have been seen and photo- graphed taking rocks in their beaks and hurling them onto ostrich eggs. They then feed upon the broken eggs. Sitta pusilla (brown-headed nuthatch), Morse (1968). This bird has been observed on several oc- casions to use a piece of pine bark to dis- lodge other pieces of bark from trees and to feed upon insects uncovered by this ac- tion. Enhydra lutris (sea otter), Kenyon (1959), Hall and Schaller (1964). Stones and shells are collected from the ocean floor, carried to the surface, placed on the animal's chest while it floats on its back, and used as an anvil to crack open mussels and other hard shelled molluscs. Macaca fascicularis (crab-eating ma- caque), Chiang (1967). These animals sometimes use leaves to wipe the surface of potential food items remov- ing sticky or noxious substances. Saimiri sciureus (squirrel monkey), Kort- landt and Kooij (1963). This species was once seen using a stick to dislodge ants from some fruit. Pongo pygmaeus (orang-utan), Kort- landt and Kooij (1963). Gorilla gorilla (gorilla), Kortlandt and Kooij (1963). These species have been seen once or twice using a branch to rake in fruit they could not easily reach. Cebus sp.? (cebus monkey), Thorington (1968), in Lancaster. Cercocebus sp.? (mangabey), Kortlandt and Kooij (1963). Colobus sp.? (colobus monkey), Kort- landt and Kooij (1963). Papio? sp.? (baboon), Kortlandt and Kooij (1963). Pan troglo,dytes (chimpanzees), Suzuki (1966), van Lawick-Goodall (1968, 1970), Jones and Pi (1969). Individuals of all these species have been observed using pieces of wood, twigs, or</page><page sequence="3">466 J. ALCOCK branches as probes usually at ant or ter- mite nests. However, with the exception of the chimpanzee, reports of this behavior are very brief and involve only one or two animals. In the case of the chimpanzee, tool-using is not exceptional. Animals in several widely dispersed populations are known to use fairly large sticks to probe ant, termite and bee nests. Those insects or the honey that clings to the tools are eaten. In addition, the chimps studied by van Lawick-Goodall also use fine grass stems and twigs which they insert into the tunnels of the nests of some termite spe- cies. In fact, they may on occasion actu- ally modify a grass stem or twig construct- ing a more efficient tool for collecting termites. Van Lawick-Goodall (1970) describes these activities in more detail and provides a few other possible cases of tool-using by feeding wild animals. DISCUSSION Preadaptations for Tool-Using Those animals which use tools seem pre- adapted for this behavior. For example, many primates have grasping hands, be- havior patterns which involve object ma- nipulation, a high level of exploratory and learning abilities all of which may be seen in various ways as a foundation for tool- using behavior (Hall, 1963; Washburn, 1963; Goodall, 1964; van Lawick-Goodall, 1968; Jay, 1968). The sea otter's habit of feeding on its back provides it with a flat surface for rock pounding (Hall and Schal- ler, 1964). Egyptian vultures perform egg- throwing movements with eggs of suitable sizes, movements which are very similar to those employed in rock throwing (van Lawick-Goodall and van Lawick, 1966; Brown and Urban, 1969). Darwin's finches collect and manipulate small twigs in con- structing a nest (Lack, 1947). Finally ant- lions and worm-lions perform head tossing movements to throw out sand in the forma- tion and maintenance of their pit traps (Wheeler, 1930). These examples should be sufficient to illustrate a variety of pos- sible preadaptations possessed by tool-us- ing species. However, many other animals have similar adaptations or other traits which could conceivably be utilized in the manipulation of objects as tools. The ques- tion is, how can one plausibly account for the origin of tool-using behavior in the very few species which actually practice it? The Origins of Tool-Using The evolution of tool-using behavior can be divided into three stages: (1) the initial appearance of the trait in a population of animals, (2) the initial transmission of the trait through the population, and (3) the subsequent evolution of the behavior over time. Hei e I shall argue that most examples of the use of tools could have had their origin in the novel use of a pre-existing behavior pattern. These behavior patterns may have been performed in a way that more or less accidentally involved the use of objects as tools in special situations. What follows is acknowledged to be highly speculative. Ant-lions and worm-lions.-The larvae of these species remove sand from their prey traps in sand dunes and other areas with a stereotyped head tossing movement. They also periodically remove sand which has blown into their traps (Wheeler, 1930). All that would be required for the origin of sand throwing at prey is an individual with a low threshold for the performance of the action. A passing prey or a struggling one which dislodged some sand grains might trigger sand throwing, be struck by some particles, and be captured by the pioneer tool-users in ant-lion and worm-lion popu- lations. Archer fish.-This fish produces a jet of water droplets simply by rapidly closing its gill covers, an action which mechanically forces the water in its gill chambers through a narrow channel between the tongue and the roof of the mouth. To capture prey on vegetation overhanging the water, the fish maneuvers into position very close to the water's surface, assumes an almost per-</page><page sequence="4">EVOLUTION OF TOOL USE 467 pendicular pose, and then contracts its muscles shutting its gill covers forcefully. Adult fish can accurately strike objects three or four feet above the water (Luling, 1963). It is difficult to imagine what the initial form of such a highly specialized trait might be. However, Luling notes that the fish leap out of the water on occasion in pursuit of insects on vegetation close to the surface. Leaping must be preceded by closing the gill covers. If an individual fish had an innately high threshold for leaping, it might orient toward an insect, pull its gill covers shut, but fail to jump after the insect. Nevertheless, the preparatory move- ments would produce a stream of water if the tongue and roof of the mouth were preadapted to form a channel of some sort. (Luling describes an incident in which a fish repeatedly shot water at a sunken mealworm. Aerial water shooting might be a secondary adaptation based on struc- tural characters which had evolved for underwater spitting-a behavior which stirred up underwater debris uncovering hidden food.) It may be argued that, even if this scenario is correct, the initial water spitter would have produced such a feeble jet that it would have been ineffective in striking and knocking an insect off a leaf. However, if the prey were only a few inches from the surface then the original weak spitting fish might occasionally have been successful while avoiding the energetic expense of jumping out of the water. The fact that juvenile archer fish also water shoot even though they can fire only a few inches (Luling, 1963) suggests that streams of water of this length may sometimes be effective. Otherwise selection should have acted to favor individuals which did not water shoot until they were large enough to produce a longer stream (because such individuals would have conserved the time and energy costs of ineffective water shooting). The woodpecker finch and other Dar- win's finches.-Elsewhere I have suggested (Alcock, 1970) that tool-using by the woodpecker finch stems from conflict be- havior. Finches unable to secure insect larvae and adults which they could see but not reach in crevices in wood may have per- formed displacement nest material gather- ing in the breeding season. Reattracted to to the crevice while still carrying a col- lected twig, a bird might jab beak and, inadvertently, twig into the space acci- dently dislodging the insect. A bird might in this way learn to associate twig use with food reinforcement and habitually use tools in this situation. It is possible that the other finches which have been observed using twig tools ac- quired the trait independently in a fashion similar to the woodpecker finch. However, it may be that tool-using by these species stems from observation of the woodpecker finch. (Interspecific observational learning would be unusual but given the great simi- larity between the different species of finches it is at least possible.) A discussion of the role of observation in the transmis- sion of a trait follows later in the paper. Egyptian vulture.-The vulture's ability to open ostrich eggs may well also have its origin in conflict behavior. A bird attracted to a clutch of eggs but unable to pick one up to throw might redirect its egg throwing movements to a rock lying nearby. These movements, which successfully open those eggs the birds can pick up, consist of lifting the object and then swinging the head down while releasing it. A bird engaged in this behavior with a rock substitute but oriented toward the highly attractive os- trich eggs could accidentally strike an egg and open it. In this way rock-throwing could be reinforced leading to learned per- formance of the behavior (van Lawick- Goodall, 1970; Alcock, 1970). Black-breasted buzzard.-Very similarly the hawk's habit of dropping rocks and lumps of dirt onto emu eggs which it is un- able to carry off because of their size may have its origin in redirected egg carrying behavior. The bird is known to transport smaller eggs to its nest (Chisholm, 1954).</page><page sequence="5">468 J. ALCOCK A bird which attempted to lift an emu egg but failed might fly up with substitute ob- jects, such as rocks. If these were dropped as the bird was reattracted to the real eggs an egg might be accidentally broken. With food reinforcement the hawk could be con- ditioned to repeat its behavior. Brown-headed nuthatch.-Morse (1968) has suggested that these birds learn to use bark flakes as tools when they accidentally chip off pieces of bark while hammering open pine seeds placed in bark crevices. Small insects are sometimes exposed when this occurs thus reinforcing the use of ob- jects as wedges and levers. Morse does not explain how the switch from pine seeds to bark tools might take place but possibly this happens when a piece of bark is only partially displaced by a pine seed wedge. If the bark were pulled off and no prey found underneath the bird might carry the bark bit to the next hammering site in- stead of selecting a new pine seed. Sea otter.-The use of rocks as tools by sea otters may well have occurred initially in situations when an animal was thwarted in attempts to open a hard shelled mollusc. Such an animal might strike one mollusc against another or against a rock attached to some shellfish retrieved from the bottom. Fisher (1939) and Kenyon (1959) have observed Californian and Alaskan sea otters using shells as tools. If an action originally taken in a conflict situation should happen to open a prey a sea otter might readily learn to repeat its behavior. Primates.-Inasmuch as the primates using tools in feeding situations have been seen doing so only once or twice (with the exception of the chimpanzee) it does not seem useful to speculate on the origin of each case. It might be worth noting how- ever that the reported cases all deal with potential conflict situations-attractive food covered with unpleasant substances or ants, fruits which were out of reach, or ants and termites which might be observed in tun- nels or known from past experience to be in a nest where they cannot be secured with the animal's fingers. Hungry animals con- fronted with these situations in which they were thwarted by the nature of the food or its location may have sometimes engaged in conflict behavior involving leaf gathering or twig or branch manipulation. These activi- ties could be reinforcing in some cases and so learned. For example, a chimpanzee frus- trated by a hidden or inaccessible termite could have performed displacement nest material gathering, food collecting or even perhaps displacement threat display with branches. If these objects happened to be thrust into termite tunnels the chimp might be rewarded by the capture of some insects and be conditioned to use tools. However, it may be more likely, as van Lawick-Goodall (1968) suggests for the chimpanzee, that the use of sticks, twigs and leaf stem probes may be the outcome of essentially random exploratory manipu- lations of these objects at ant and termite nests. In summary, it is clear that one need not invoke insight behavior by an animal to provide a possible explanation for the origin of tool-using in the cases discussed. Indeed, it seems probable that most examples origi- nated as a result of fortuitous accidents in- volving the performance of a pre-existing behavior pattern in a slightly altered way in a novel situation. In particular, as Hall (1963) pointed out largely on the basis of tool-using by primates in aggressive situa- tions, conflict behavior may have played a key role in the origin of the use of tools. Animals thwarted while attempting to feed on food items they could see but not cap- ture or consume may have performed dis- placement or redirection activities with naturally occurring objects, activities which proved to be rewarding. It should be noted however that in some cases conflict be- havior is an unlikely candidate for the foundation of tool-using behavior (e.g., brown-headed nuthatch, ant-lions). No single explanation can account for the origin of all examples of tool-using by feeding animals.</page><page sequence="6">EVOLUTION OF TOOL USE 469 The Initial Spread of Tool-Using Behavior in a Population Although it is possible that the increase in the frequency of tool-using in some spe- cies required a long period of evolution, in other species it may have spread rapidly. First, a favorable set of environmental con- ditions may have resulted in the indepen- dent discovery of tools by a large number of individuals over a short period of time. Second, observation of an experienced con- specific may have facilitated the spread of the trait in a variety of ways (van Lawick- Goodall, 1970). Theoretically this could occur in much the same way that other novel behavior patterns, such as milk bottle opening by European titmice and other species (Hinde and Fisher, 1952) and po- tato washing by macaques (Kawamura, 1959), have occurred. Just as milk bottle opening and potato washing are limited to some populations of titmice and macaques, so tool-using is often restricted to one or a few populations or is distinctively different from population to population within a tool-using species (e.g., Egyptian vultures, nuthatches, sea otters, chimpanzees). Again an observer animal need not dis- play insight in order to benefit from obser- vation of a companion (Thorpe, 1963; Alcock, 1969a, b). It is often enough that an animal merely attend to the activities of another and in so doing have its attention directed to some object or part of the en- vironment that it would otherwise have ig- nored. Then through trial and error the observer can learn for itself what is signifi- cant about the object or part of its environ- ment. The fact that most species which learn to use feeding tools are social animals and/ or have a period of close parent-offspring relationship would facilitate learning from observation. All tool-using birds and pri- mates feed in groups. The performance of a tool-using activity may release this be- havior in an observer animal in much the same way that satiated chickens are stimu- lated to peck at food by watching hungry chickens do so. Socially facilitated be- havior could provide the basis for learned tool-use. For example, a naive Egyptian vulture, stimulated to throw rocks by a companion might learn to associate the be- havior with food even if it was actually the companion's rock which opened an ostrich egg (Alcock, 1970). Even more important perhaps, young animals which have been subject to selec- tion pressure to learn a variety of things directly or indirectly from their parents may be especially likely to acquire tool- using behavior as a result of watching others. The sea otter and the chimpanzee have particularly close and prolonged ties between adults and their progeny. But even young birds are often fed for weeks after fledging and may accompany their parents in loose groups for still longer periods of time. Thus young tool-using birds, otters, and primates have ample opportunity to observe experienced tool- users and to manipulate objects their par- ents have been using. Van Lawick-Goodall (1968, p. 209) provides examples of chim- panzees doing exactly this. In summary, tool-using behavior, once fortuitously discovered, may have spread rapidly through some populations of birds and mammals as a result of socially facili- tated learning. The Subsequent Evolution of Tool-Using Behavior The selective advantage enjoyed by the original tool-users in any population may be great enough to set in motion a chain of evolutionary events which can affect the frequency of the trait in a population and a complex of factors underlying the be- havior. However, it should be stressed that for many species tool-using is a rare event which probably is simply the by-product of selection for certain general abilities which underlie many different behavior patterns. One questions whether the use of feeding tools can provide even a minor focal point for selection in the case of the</page><page sequence="7">470 J. ALCOCK nuthatch, Darwin's finches other than the woodpecker finch, the buzzard, and most primates. For other species tools may be effectively used more often permitting a significant expansion of exploitable food resources. Sand-throwing by ant- and worm-lions seems highly adaptive. For these species, in which the behavior may have originated simply because some individuals possessed unique thresholds for a particular behavior pattern, selection appears to have shifted the threshold for sand-tossing downward for entire populations. Luling (1963) argues that water shooting by the archer fish can be of no significance because the fish spends much of its life at sea. Nevertheless the ability to capture prey with reduced energy expenditure (as- suming that leaping from the water is energetically expensive) is surely advan- tageous even if only practiced for that por- tion of the animal's life spent in mangrove swamps. Thus in the archer fish selection may have first effected a shift in the threshold of a behavior pattern for an en- tire population. Individuals which tended to close the gill covers but not leap from the water would become the norm. Given the present very stereotyped nature of the behavior it would appear that there is one best way to water shoot most accu- rately and effectively. Selection has evi- dently acted to perfect and stereotype the relationship between what has become a fixed action pattern and a set of releasing stimuli. Of course correlated with these behavioral changes has been the remark- able specialization of mouth morphology to enhance the spitting ability of the fish (Luling, 1958). In contrast to the fish and insects, learn- ing may be a much more important com- ponent of tool-using by some birds and mammals. When learning plays a role in the development of the trait, selection can operate in several ways to increase the probability that animals will learn quickly to use tools skillfully. (1) Selection for specific play and ex- ploratory behavior patterns.-Since it has long been realized that facility in the use of sticks as tools by captive apes depends on their having had opportunities to ma- nipulate and play with sticks (Kohler, 1927), selection may favor the develop- ment of specific kinds of manipulatory play and exploratory behavior (Jay, 1968). The sea otter is known to be an exception- ally playful animal (Kenyon, 1959) as is the chimpanzee. It would be intriguing to observe fledgling and juvenile woodpecker finches in the wild. Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1967) has observed captive finches playing with tools when satiated. (2) Selection for specific conflict be- havior in conflict situations.-When con- flict behavior of a certain sort is the key to tool-using it is reasonable to assume that selection will favor those individuals which perform that kind of behavior most readily in the appropriate situations. It may be that selection of this sort is occurring now in some populations of Egyptian vultures. Woodpecker finches may have been under selection to gather twigs when thwarted by visible but unreachable prey. Millikan and Bowman (1967) note that twig manipula- tion occurs as a displacement activity very frequently suggesting that this behavior pattern has a low threshold in conflict situ- ations. It is conceivable in the case of the finch that selection has acted to "ritualize" conflict behavior in tool-using situations by standardizing the behavior pattern, the releasing situation, and by divorcing the behavior from its original motivational state. (3) Selection for attentiveness to parents and/or companions.-If acquisition of tool- using is aided by or dependent upon obser- vation of other tool-users, selection should favor those individuals which are especially attentive to the activities of companions or parents. Moreover, there may be an addi- tional advantage for those animals with a tendency to perform actions similar to those they observe. An isolated woodpecker finch failed to learn to manipulate twig</page><page sequence="8">EVOLUTION OF TOOL USE 471 tools, even when eventually permitted to watch others when older (Millikan and Bowman, 1967). If this case is truly repre- sentative of the species, not only is tool- using linked to observation of others but there is a critical period for learning to take place. As previously noted, sea otters stay with their mothers for many months and van Lawick-Goodall (1968) has seen young chimps watching adults carefully and du- plicating their behavior. (4) Selection for ease of conditioning in tool-using situations.-Finally, when a learned behavior pattern is of real impor- tance to an animal there is substantial evi- dence that selection can lead to the evolu- tion of animals with a highly specific ability to learn that behavior pattern easily (Tinbergen, 1951; Lorenz, 1970). It seems probable that woodpecker finches and sea otters in particular, and also chimpanzees and Egyptian vultures (from tool-using populations) can learn to use their tools much more readily than other species, even closely related ones. However, Millikan and Bowman (1967) argue that the wood- pecker finches' use of tools stems from purely ecological factors (an abundance of wood-dwelling larvae and the absence of woodpeckers on the Galapagos) and not genetic ones. They cite as evidence the fact that the finches proved no more adept at learning to pull a string to retrieve a prey tied at the end than such birds as tit- mice which do not use tools naturally. This argument ignores the specificity of se- lection which has surely been directed at favoring finches able to learn to manipu- late sticks and thorns skillfully with their beaks. Finches capable of coordinating movements of their beaks and feet in string pulling exercises probably have not enjoyed any particular selective advantage. The Significance of Tool-Using Behavior by "Lower" Animals For an Understanding of Human Evolution Thinking about human tool-using ap- pears to have passed through a number of stages. It was first thought that only humans used tools and that the pioneer tool- users must have been individuals of excep- tional intellect. Subsequently it was real- ized that other animals used tools. This was then taken to indicate that these spe- cies were extraordinarily intelligent ones, forerunners in the animal kingdom of hu- man intelligence. It is now recognized that simply because some animals use tools does not mean that these species have anything essential in common with humans. Tool- using has obviously evolved independently many times with many different underlying mechanisms (Hall, 1963). Is then the fact that other animals use tools basically ir- relevant for an understanding of human evolution? I think not, for the study of other animals suggests that: (1) The origin of tool-using in the hu- man evolutionary line need not have in- volved a high level of conceptual ability on the part of the pioneer individuals. In all likelihood protohumans began using tools accidentally when certain conflict and/or exploratory behavior patterns involving object manipulation happened to be rein- forcing. (2) The initial transfer of the trait from individual to individual likewise could have occurred without insightful behavior on the part of the observer. This might have hap- pened simply because protohumans tended to watch what others did and to investigate the properties of objects used by their com- panions or parents. It may well be that the selective advantage of tool-using by our ancestors stemmed in large measure from the fact that not only the innovator but also his offspring and relatives were likely to acquire the trait and the improved effi- ciency in food gathering it permitted. (3) Once tool-using originated much of its peculiar importance to protohumans lay in the fact that it provided access to a sub- stantial food resource, mammalian prey, previously unavailable for the most part to members of the species. The use of feeding tools by chimpanzees is significant to the extent that it indicates a potential for the behavior in the human evolutionary line.</page><page sequence="9">472 J. ALCOCK But the animals which are most revealing from a comparative standpoint are not our primate relatives but unrelated species sub- ject to ecological pressures broadly similar to those operating on our human ancestors. It is surely significant that the major tool- using species, sea otters, woodpecker finches, and humans, have all invaded niches that are not at all characteristic of their phylogenetic groups. The sea otter is the only otter to have entered the marine environment. It did so rather recently and thus faced competition from many other established marine mammals. The wood- pecker finch is in all likelihood one of the most recently evolved Darwin's finch and the only one which specializes in the un- finch-like habit of removing larvae from decaying wood. Competition from the many other existing species of the Geospiz- inae has almost certainly been critical in its evolution (Lack, 1947). Humans and their immediate ancestors are the only primates to feed on other mammals to a significant degree. This niche was invaded recently at a time when there were many other ac- complished savannah-dwelling predators to compete with protohumans for mammalian prey. In each case tool-using compensates for the finch, otter, and protohumans' lack of biological equipment for the exploitation of wood-dwelling larvae, hard shelled mol- luscs, and moderately large mammals re- spectively. Thus the use of tools may have been a key adaptation permitting coexis- tence between these species and potential competitors already present in their en- vironments. When tool-using behavior achieves this importance it can create selec- tion pressures which have the manifold effects outlined in the previous section. In the case of humans, the structure of the hand, the neurophysiology of the brain, the kinds of play, exploratory, and conflict behaviors, the attentiveness to and appar- ent imitation of others, and specific learn- ing abilities have surely been affected by selective forces associated with tool-using (Washburn, 1959; Campbell, 1966). Thus although the simple fact that other animals use tools may be relatively insig- nificant, comparative studies of tool-using behavior can illuminate aspects of the evo- lutionary process which apply equally to woodpecker finches and human beings. SUMMARY This paper reviews the known cases of the use of tools by animals feeding under natural conditions and discusses the pos- sible origins, transmission, and subsequent evolution of this behavior. It seems prob- able that the pioneer tool-users of various species were simply using pre-existing be- havior patterns in a way which accidentally involved the use of an object as a tool. The transmission of the trait in some popula- tions of birds and mammals may have taken place fairly rapidly if inexperienced ani- mals could benefit from observation of tool- using parents or companions. In the rela- tively few cases where the use of tools makes a substantial contribution to the food economy of a species selection for fa- cility in tool-using may be evident. This may have taken the form of shifts in thresholds for selected behavior patterns in the insect and fish tool-users or it may have led to special learning abilities in the bird and mammal tool-users. Comparative stud- ies of this behavioral trait may contribute to an understanding of human evolution. Sea otters, woodpecker finches, and humans may be especially proficient in the use of feeding tools because all have invaded un- usual niches for their phylogenetic groups and have faced potentially severe competi- tion from species well established in their environments. Under these circumstances selection may operate at a variety of levels to improve the tool-using abilities of popu- lations of animals.
