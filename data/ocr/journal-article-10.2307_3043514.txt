<plain_text><page sequence="1">Browning's "Karshish" and St. Paul " An Epistle . . . of Karshish " is one of five poems which, though there is no evidence that Browning intended them to form a sequence, in effect trace the history of man's groping progress toward a realiza- tion of the Christian God. In the first of the series, Caliban's momen- tary fantasy of a serene deity high above Setebos suggests that even when man's religious ideas are dominated by anthropomorphism and " natural theology," a certain irrepressible yearning, indeed necessity, leads him to postulate the existence of The Quiet. In the last of the series, " A Death in the Desert," the dying St. John, the last survivor of those who saw Jesus plain, foresees the coming of an age in which the proofs of a loving God, contained in the New Testament, are thrown into doubt. Of the intervening poems, " Saul " describes the ecstatic experience by which David is led to understand that (to borrow Karshish's words) " the all-Great " deity of the Hebrews is "the All- Loving too"; and "An Epistle . . . of Karshish " and "Cleon" deplore the blindness of intellectually complacent men who fail to accept the assurances both desire the one by looking upon the miracle of Lazarus from the fatally circumscribed viewpoint of the scientist, the other by assuming, without even bothering to investigate, that the doctrine of Paul and Christ " could be held by no sane man." Like " Caliban " and " Cleon," "K arshish " can and should be read in two ways: as Browning's reconstruction of a significant, albeit imaginary, event in the history of religion, and as a satiric commentary on the intellectual and theological forces aligned against traditional Christianity in the nineteenth century. When we read it on the former-literal-level, the poem acquires extra edge if we detect the hovering presence of St. Paul. The use of " Epistle " in the title, and the twenty-line ceremonious opening, so strongly suggestive of the " long prolusion and display " which are characteristic of Paul's own epistles, are good initial evidence of an implicit reference to the apostle. Some readers, too, may be struck by the sound-resemblance between "Karshish " and " Tarsus," but this point need not be insisted upon. Note the similarities between the careers of Karshish and Paul, who, we must remind ourselves, were contemporaries. Both were healers. Karshish is identified in the poem's subtitle as a "physician," and many passages in his epistle reflect his specifically medical interests. Paul, after his conversion, healed a cripple at Lystra (Acts 14: 8-10) and other sufferers (Acts 28: 8-9). Both were travelers. Karshish 494 Modern Language Notes</page><page sequence="2">spoke of himself as a " vagrant Scholar," and we can assume that the journey during which the present epistle, the twenty-second in a series, was written was but one of many expeditions in search of scientific knowledge. Paul was probably the most footloose of the apostles, but it was missionary zeal, not desire to collect " learning's crumbs," that impelled him. And both, in their respective roles, encountered hos- tility. Karshish was twice stripped and beaten by robbers, and on another occasion on the same journey was declared a spy. Paul was persecuted, imprisoned in Rome, and perhaps eventually martyred. These parallels, however, merely highlight the several ironic con- trasts between the two men and their careers. The whole significance of the Karshish-Paul similarities resides in the fact that, in crucial respects, Karshish was not like St. Paul. For one thing, Paul per- ceived truth not through the senses and the intellect, but through iintuitive experience marked, we are told, by a lifelong series of ecstatic visions (Galatians 2: 2; 2 Corinthians 12: 1-9; Acts 16: 9 ff.). His knowledge of the divinity of Christ and of all that that implies was gainied by means which Karshish, committed to the supremacy of the reason, was unable, or at least refused, to avail himself of. In terms of Browning's constant exaltation of the lessons of the soul over those of the mind, where Paul was strong, Karshish was weak. Since the central problem of Karshish's report to Abib is the in- credible experience of Lazarus, it is ironic, too, that Paul, like Christ, the learned leech " of Karshish's account, had the power to raise men "from the dead." When he was in Macedonia, "a certain young man " fell asleep during Paul's preaching " and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead " (i. e., as if dead). Paul however cried, " Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him," and so it proved (Acts 20: 9-12). A power which Karshish marveled over, and in which he all but refused to believe, his fellow-healer, Paul, possessed. Browning did not preface " Karshish " with an epigraplh, as he did "Caliban " and " Cleon." One is tempted to remedy his omission by borrowing from the words of Paul himself, who on several occasions speaks of men very like Karshish: ""Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? " (1 Corinthians 1: 20) Or again and even better: " But the natural man [an admirable description of Karshish] receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually dis- cerned " (1 Corinthians 2: 14). VOL. LXXII, November 1957 495</page><page sequence="3">In Browning's poem, Karshish, like Paul on a crucial occasioln, is seen in the midst of a journey; the poem, like so many others among Browning's best dramatic monologues, focuses on the Great Moment, the supreme crossroad, in a man's life. Paul, an unbeliever, was journeying toward Damascus; and in an instant, through the agency of God, " there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized " (Acts 9: 18). Karshish, an unbeliever, was journeying toward Jerusalem (the symbolism im- plicit in Browning's choice of a destination for him should not be overlooked). But the crowning difference between the two episodes is that, faced with a divine revelation almost as plain as that which visited Paul, Karshish, the stubborn empiricist, refused to accept it. The scales did not fall from his eyes-at least within the period covered by the poem; for Browning, with characteristic ambiguity, leaves un- resolved the question of whether they were about to do so. Karshish, like Paul, was at a fork in the spiritual road. The full drama of the situation-the poignancy of his dilemma, the enormous stakes that hang on his choice, and the handicaps imposed upon men's souls by too rigid adherence to " scientific " modes of thought-is better realized when we compare it, element by element, with the story of St. Paul's coniversion.
