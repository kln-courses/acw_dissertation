Skuas are predatory sea birds of the north and south polar regions. They resemble their close relatives the gulls, except that they have incongruous-looking claws on their webbed feet and sharply hooked, hawk-like beaks. Skuas subsist variously as hunters, fishers, scaven- gers, and thieves. The three smaller species have a circumpolar breed- ing range and are called jaegers in North America. The three larger skua species are restricted to the southern hemisphere, with the exception of the Great Skua, which breeds in scattered areas throughout the North Sea. Although skuas show an overall similarity in fundamental design, they also exhibit remarkable differences both between and within species. Variations on the common theme are evident in morphology, plumage colours, food preferences, feeding behaviour, migration cor- ridors, breeding strategy, and displays. This kind of variability is grist to an evolutionary biologist's mill by providing raw material with which evolutionary explanations can be tested. For example, if two closely related species differ slightly in expression of a character such as territory size, one can reasonably attribute the differences to differ- ing environmental influences rather than to evolutionary history. Robert W. Furness is an evolutionary biologist who has been study- ing skuas since 197 1 , primarily the Great Skua on the Shetland Islands, but also other species as far away as the sub- Antarctic. In The Skuas, he uses his own research and that of his students and other workers to derive tantalizing insights into the process of evolutionary change. The book begins with background information on classification, status,</page><page sequence="2">322 / REVIEWS distribution, and migration. Skua taxonomy is traced from present times back through the early 17th-century ornithologists to Aristotle. The expansion in numbers and range of Great Skuas, or "Bonxies" as they are known in the Shetlands, is chronicled through surprisingly detailed historical accounts from their original colonization of Iceland in the 16th century to their expansion throughout the North Atlantic within the past 100 years. The bulk of the book treats the evolutionary adaptations and ecologi- cal relationships of skuas. The puzzling phenomenon of "reversed sexual dimorphism" (female larger than male), found in almost all predatory birds, is discussed in some detail. Because skuas are more closely related to gulls than to raptors, they clearly evolved reversed sexual dimorphism separately from raptors but presumably as a response to the same selective pressures. Furness concludes that female defense of the young is the principal reason for evolution of larger females in skuas and, by extrapolation, perhaps in other predatory birds. Furness discusses implications of differences in the "Long-Call" display to skua systematics and the reasons for the evolution of persis- tent dive-bombing nest defense familiar to all northern travellers. Considerable attention is given to documenting diet differences and similarities, and relating these to aspects of behaviour and distribution. Factors influencing the evolution of kleptoparasitism (stealing from other birds) and plumage polymorphism are treated in detail. The book ends with practical discussions of pollution, human-skua conflict, and conservation. Predators accumulate pollutants concen- trated through the food chain and consequently are sensitive indicators of environmental pollution. Furness presents data showing that DDE levels in skua tissue have been declining since 1970 but that PCBs have remained constant. Attitudes of the Shetland sheepherders (crofters) have changed over the past 200 years. In the late 1700s, Great Skuas were protected by law because they drove off Sea Eagles, which might prey on lambs. With the extinction of eagles around 1900, this role was terminated and attitudes toward skuas changed to annoyance or antipa- thy resulting from dive-bombing, some limited pr√©dation on livestock, and chasing of sheep and dogs. Furness presents a reasoned approach to solution of these problems. The book lacks the dryness one fears from technical treatises. Through- out there are sensitive pencil drawings by John Busby. Chapters are headed with obscure and quirky quotes, such as: There is a fowl called Scutiallan, of a black colour and as big as a Wild Duck, which doth live upon the Vomit and Excrements of other Fowls, whome they pursue and having apprehended them they cause them to vomit up what they have lately taken, not yet digested: the Lord's Works both of Nature and of Grace are wonderful, all speaking forth his Glorious Goodness, Wisdom and Power. Rev. John Brand (1701) Furness harbours no romantic illusions about his subject animals and expresses this in refreshing forthrightness. Lack of coordination in Great Skua nest defense "leads the anthropomorphic observer to think of them as being exceptionally stupid birds." Great Skua feeding behaviour leads Furness to conclude that "the bird is unusually lazy. " He treats conservation problems with pragmatism unlikely to endear him to preservation-style conservationists. He argues that the best long-term conservation strategy is to minimize human-skua conflict by shooting a small number of skuas from specific situations. The book's production is immaculate. The photographs are crisp and I was able to locate only one editing error. This is a worthy addi- tion to T &amp; AD Poyser's ornithology list, a series that is setting the modern standard for technical works in natural history. The Skuas is recommended to anyone interested in avian behaviour, ecology, and evolution. Christopher C.
