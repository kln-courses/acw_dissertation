<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PLACE OF GENERAL IDEAS AS CONTROLLING FACTORS. No MATTER what ideal be used as determining the choice of educational material for children's school work, it is certain that the use scientifically of the opportunities presented by that material must be determined by the scientific concepts in the teacher's mind. Such fundamental ideas as are summed up in what is called the law of the conservation of energy - of the various forms of reversible and irreversible transformations of energy, in the concepts of mass, motion, and momentum-are necessarily most fundamental. Biologically speaking, the sum- ming up of the effect of the action of the natural forces involved in the concept of evolution occupies a similar determining posi- tion, if one understands by that term both the advance made since the earliest epochs of time by all forms of life in the utilization of their natural environment, and the advance made in the life of each organism. In the proper understanding of the growth of the mind as a part of this same evolutionary development comes the freedom from tradition per se in education.' The teacher must be capable of looking at any process going on as a result of interaction of forces which can be controlled by analysis, which are subject to the same laws, no matter how out- wardly unlike they appear to be in manifestation. To illustrate the advantage gained through the use of some such concepts, we begin with that force first used by men, and perhaps because it is so continually and everywhere acting that its very familiarity has bred contempt --the force of gravitation. This same con-. tempt has brought about an ignoring of its possibilities education- ally as a means of introducing the child in a natural way to that concept of force which he must possess in order to have made the advance in intelligence which is his birth-right in this twenti- eth century. The idea underlying the familiar process of weigh- ing as the process in measuring the pull of the earth; the 1 YOUNG, Scientific Method in Education, pp. 4, 5. 377</page><page sequence="2">378 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER connection of this notion, which the child already possesses, that this pull or force is acting upon him in common with all other things, with the notion of controlling and measuring it, can be begun in the very earliest years. The association of weight with only such objects as can be grasped and carried should be extended as soon as possible into the general idea that this measurable property belongs to all things, even to the intangible air. If in the very beginning the introduction of anthroporporphic reasons for the changes which the child sees going on about him be scrupulously avoided, and the reasons for such changes be stated in terms of such forces or motions as the child already under- stands, or not stated at all where such an explanation seems impossible, the first step toward a scientific attitude is. made. While this does not bar the legitimate use of the myth and story, or the child's natural personification of forces, it does limit such forms of expression as a means of introducing phenomena to the child's attention. The growth of that attitude of mind which is recognized in the vernacular as belonging to the possessor of " common-sense " must be continuous, hence enter into the sim- plest process a child can manage. When in his first cooking he finds out through his quantita- tive work with the various cereals that bulk and weight are not synonymous terms, that to find the amount of water needed weight is the only standard, he makes a great advance. When he carries over this idea of the particular advantage of the use of weight into, its use as a universal measure, he is also ready to gain some conception of the adaptation of this force to man's use in most primitive applications, such as water-power and falling weights; also to translate what he sees going on about him in the falling range, in the grinding rocks rolled along by the spring floods as they tear away the land, in the pounding of the waves on the shore, destroying the block - all simply other manifesta- tions of this same force. When he can carry over such illustra- tions as the making of wave-motions in a small pond, where he directly controls the direction and amount, into the understanding of the wave-motion in lake or ocean, he is also ready, though it may be in the form of but a dim feeling, to realize the motion of</page><page sequence="3">GENERAL IDEAS AS CONTROLLING FACTORS 379 the earth as it sweeps him past the sun and stars by day and night. He can then intelligibly carry his notion of day and night, and the revolution of the moon about the earth, over into a com- prehension of the yearly journey of the earth about the sun, and to seize with delight the notion of the circling planets as they accompany the earth. The whirling top, the swinging pendulum, and the sling-shot will then all carry with them such association as will gradually build up a usable concept of force and motion. We find children of eight able to develop, through this notion of mass and bulk, a rational system of weights and measures. Chil- dren of nine can carry farther the same idea through some appli- cation of the principle of specific gravity. The best point of attack has been found to be throtugh the discovery of the fact that a floating body displaces its own weight of liquid, and that this method is the most practical one of finding the volume of an *irregular solid; and with this experimental method of approach the child can experience the joy which made Archimedes's "Eureka" ring. The historical evolution of the sciences indicates, among many other usable points, either the order in which the concept has developed, or even the practical problems which have caused the change of some simpler concept into its more scientific form. The notion of the force gained as proportional to the velocity of a moving mass comes practically very early in the experience of a running boy; and it would seem possible, with proper appara- tus, early to gain some notion of this force of impact as dependent upon velocity. Each child's experience contains vivid images of force embodied in a rapidly moving train, or a body falling from a great height, with a vague idea that the force possessed of this body is related to the height from which it has fallen or the rate of the train. The incontestable interest in the locomotive of the child of nine or ten can readily be turned into forming experimentally some idea of the relation of the mechanical energy obtained to the chemical energy stored up in the fuel used, and back again to the source of that energy in the plants which form the coal. To allow the interest of a child to expend itself in merely running</page><page sequence="4">380 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER his toy engine, or in merely constructing a tram of cars, without making such activities the center of experiments necessitating the control of the ideas of utilization of the coal's energy by the child, is an inexcusable waste of opportunity. On the biological side, the effect of the force of gravity on plants and animals should begin in the kindergarten. The geo- tropism of roots, stems, and leaves is an especially good point for experimentation with five-, six-, and seven-year-old children, and helps the child to a correct conception of the plant as a living thing, moving and growing under the same conditions as itself. Here such experiments as are often given later should be tried, showing the lifting power of germinating seed and the strength of the growing stem and shoot. The very definite response of some of the lower forms of animals to position with reference to, the force of gravitation would be one of the earliest ways of making the child discriminate, in his observation of lower forms of life, between the apparently voluntary and the involuntary motions of animals. The relating of this to the familiar motion of the moth to the flame, and back again to the motions of the plants, will strengthen his ideas of unity of nature much more than the rolling sphere of the kindergarten gifts. It may not be out of place here to remark that the biological scientists of the new school declare that the anthropomorphic attitude of mind to which men are accustomed from their earliest childhood is one of the greatest obstacles to scientific thinking, and one which, in their opinion, is the easiest to, eradicate in youth. In later physiological work in the human body some analysis of the more ordinary muscular movements, so as to bring out the principle of the force involved through the use of some anal- ysis of locomotion to show that it is a continuous forward fall, and that the attitude of greatest security involves a principle of placing the center of gravity with reference to the base of support, involve illustrations of the way in which a child can consciously connect in a new form his notion of the action of the force of gravity with a felt or muscular force. The continual repetition, year by year, of experiments show- ing the dependence of animal life upon vegetable, and vegetable</page><page sequence="5">GENERAL IDEAS AS CONTROLLING FACTORS 381 life upon inorganic material, as engines utilizing energy derived from the sun, brings out in more detail this fundamental concep- tion of life, and should involve more and more analysis of the forces concerned. The necessity for recognizing that the scientific development of the nineteenth century found its origin in the intelligent con- trol of processes of manufacture gives a clue for the educational use of industrial processes. The truth that these processes must never center in themselves scientifically, if their use is to be really educational must, however, never be lost sight of by the teacher. It is too easy to be satisfied with the logical use and con- trol by the child of the particular process he is carrying on, with- out seeing that he makes the widest possible application of the principle worked out to the greatest natural forces which his tiny process in any way parallels. With the growth of his ability to liken causes, to trace their effects (though Protean in form) as like in that nature which is essential to his desired end, the child will come naturally into the possession of that scientific method which is the key to intellectual power in any field of knowledge. He will do this without divorcing the play of emo- tion, and color of feeling, from his thinking; a divorcement that leads to the sterile intellectualism which, sufficient in itself, does not find its final satisfaction in expression in activity of worth to man.
