<plain_text><page sequence="1">Soft Cradles of the Central Plains by Candace Greene ABSTRACT Soft cradles as distinct from cradleboards are defined and described as an artifact type commonly used on the Central Plains in historic times, primarily by the Cheyenne and Sioux. The characteristics of construction and decoration of cradles from these tribes are presented and their history and relationship to Arapaho interior frame cradles is discussed. An analysis of symbolism associated with soft cradles reveals that decorative elements gain meaning from their position on an object rather than from their specific form. INTRODUCTION Baby carriers and cradles were an esteemed artifact form among many historic Plains Indian groups. Adorned with lavish beadwork or quill ing, their production was the province of women. Such decorative craftwork was a visible symbol of female industry and achievement, and cradles were marked with special respect within the repertory of objects produced. Among the Sioux and Cheyenne, where women's craft societies were formalized and the recognition accorded to the production of various objects was systematized along the same lines as "coup counting" among men, cradles reckoned as sig nificant "counts" (Grinnell 1972: 161; Hassrick 1964: 272; Marriott 1956). Cradles were commonly given as gifts from the father's kin to the expectant mother and child some time before birth. For the Cheyenne, Sioux, Arapaho, and Gros Ventres it is reported that the cradle was made by the father's sister (Grinnell 1972: 107; Hassrick 1964: 271; Kroeber 1902: 16; Flannery 1953: 141) or other female relative (Hilger 1952: 35).1 The presen tation of a cradle by the father's kindred was a token of respect and support for the mother. It was also the first symbolic link in the complex web of social relationships into which a child was born. Cradle-giving was intended to confer intan gible benefits as well as provide for the child's physical support and protection. For the Arapaho, "the cradle was to bring blessings upon the child" (Hilger 1952:30). In addition to such spiritual benefits, the receipt of cradles marked the social position of the child and sug gested the level and sources of familial support he or she might expect in life. A child with a large or affluent family might receive many cradles. "The more cradles, the greater the respect, and in turn the greater the prestige..." (Hassrick 1964: 272). Cradles were sufficiently prestigious to be used as formal presentation items outside the context of childbirth and family gift giving. A remarkable cradle with pictographic beadwork in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History (50.1/1269) is accompanied by the following documentation: This carrier is fully beaded and was made by the orders of Red Cloud to commemorate the peace of 1868 when all the bands of Sioux sur rendered and came under the American flag. It was given by Red Cloud to Black Coal, Chief of the Northern Arapaho, as a visiting present... SOFT CRADLES Cradleboards with lavishly beaded or quilled covers and large wooden frames have continued to hold a respected position as pres tige items in contexts of contemporary Native use as well as in public and private collections of historic Indian artifacts. Soft cradles or baby carriers have received less attention and are sel dom illustrated or exhibited, although they are 95</page><page sequence="2">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. 37, No. 139,1992 common in museum collections and continue to be produced and used on a modest scale. This type of cradle is not mentioned in either of the two survey works on Indian cradles that have been published (Farabee 1920; Mason 1889), al though a number of specimens of this type were in the collection of the Smithsonian at the time Mason prepared his study. This lack of attention may be the result of poor understanding of their proper configura tion. These soft carriers gain shape only when wrapped around a bundled baby and little of their form or beauty can be appreciated when they are flattened or folded. Further, many specimens are now missing the lower wrapper and they are frequently misidentified as hoods or bonnets or listed as incomplete or unfinished cradleboards. A systematic examination of over 150 baby carriers in museum collections and associated notes and photographs has served to better define this artifact type. It is clear that these cradles were ordinarily used without a rigid frame as a soft protective wrapping for infants, convenient for carrying a child in the arms or securing the baby around home.2 Historic photographs and surviving miniature cradles containing dolls show how the carrier was wrapped and tied around a child (Fig. 1). CHEYENNE TRIANGULAR AND SIOUX RECTANGULAR CRADLES The majority of Plains soft cradles can be divided into two categories that appear superfi cially similar, but differ in construction and design. One category is based upon a triangular hood shape. The other is built upon a rectan gular form. In the triangular form of carrier (Fig. 2), the hood is made of a truncated triangle of tanned hide to which a rectangular cloth wrapper is sewn. The wrapper may be cut to fit the shape of the hood or the upper corners may simply be folded in to achieve a triangular form. The hood is often lined with cloth. At the peak of the hood is a stiff tab approximately 3" square formed by the projecting end of a tapering strip of rawhide inserted into the seam joining the wrapper and the hood. When the cradle was in use, the tab would have been held upright by the pressure of the child's head against the portion inside the wrapper. Tabs are always decorated, usually with solid beading, and are often further adorned with a small fringe of bead strands on the back and beaded trifurcated pendants at the corners. Figure 3 provides a front and back schematic drawing of a completed carrier, as well as the basic pattern pieces required for its construction. The bottom of the wrapper was folded up over the baby's lower body, the sides folded in to overlap in front, and a separate thong or strip of cloth was used to tie the carrier snugly around the child. The stiff hood arched around the child's face to protect it from sun or weather. The triangular hooded baby carrier is close ly associated with the Southern Cheyenne. All documented specimens located in the course of this study were collected among the Cheyenne in Oklahoma with two exceptions, which may represent trade pieces. One was secured in Ok lahoma (then Indian Territory) in 1899 by Alfred Kroeber and was recorded as being Southern Arapaho (AMNH 50/303). According to his correspondence with Alfred Kroeber (n.d., AMNH accession file 1899-45), Kroeber was having difficulty securing the services of an interpreter and establishing contacts with in formants at the time this specimen was col lected. It is possible that he did not fully understand the tribal identity of the person from whom he obtained the carrier or that he was un able to determine its source of manufacture. The second exception to Southern Cheyenne origin is a triangular hooded specimen that was collected among the Northern Arapaho by Wil liam Wildschut (MAI 12/2150). It has an interior U-shaped frame of Northern Arapaho type that fits poorly and does not appear to be original. This item may also have been received through trade and modified by the recipients to better conform to their standards for cradle configura tion. Undocumented specimens with triangular hoods have been cataloged with a wide variety of tribal attributions, but their frequency in col lections from Oklahoma further supports their identification as southern in origin. I have clas sified the triangular form of baby carrier as 96</page><page sequence="3">Candace Greene] PLAINS SOFT CRADLES ^^^^^^^^ V; ^ . ^^^^^^^^ ^ ^^^^^^^^^^^ " ^ ^ ^^^^^^ ^^^^ Figure 1.

Southern Cheyenne-type, which does not preclude the possibility that it was occasionally produced or used by other associated groups, such as the Southern Arapaho, with whom there was a significant level of marriage and social in teraction. The second form of soft cradle (Fig. 4, 5) is based upon a rectangular pattern for all com ponents, as is illustrated in Figure 6. Most specimens have a separate panel in the back, but a few represent a variant form joined with a central back seam. Some carriers are made com pletely of hide while others have cloth wrappers attached to skin hoods of varying lengths. A cloth lining is optional. Tabs are larger than on triangular hooded cradles, usually about 5" square, and are more variable in form. Some tabs are of rawhide designed to stand upright while others are of soft tanned skin and hang pendant. Upright tabs are stitched to a rawhide extension inside the carrier, which provides leverage to help hold them in a vertical position, although not as firmly as the single rawhide strip of Cheyenne-type cradles. Many quilled cradles have tabs made of quill- wrapped rawhide slats similar to those used on the bottom of pipe bags (Fig. 7). A few cradles have heavy, bead wrapped slats. All forms of tab typically ter minate in long buckskin fringe. A series of thongs to tie the cradle together are attached in pairs along facing front edges. The schematic drawing in Figure 6 shows a carrier laid out in the same shape as the trian gular cradle illustrated in Figure 3 to facilitate comparison. While the completed carriers ap pear superficially similar, the patterns are quite different. This drawing represents a carrier made completely of hide, but square or rectan gular cloth wrappers were often added to both long and short hoods. The wrappers, now often missing, were folded around the child as pre viously described for the triangular cradle. Documented specimens of the rectangular form of cradle are widespread in origin, col 98</page><page sequence="5">Candace Greene] PLAINS SOFT CRADLES CHEYENNE-TYPE SOFT CRADLE A front view back view COMPONENT PARTS j?| &gt;-v tab r^s hood / /' \^ Z_y f_I I_^ back - cut edge . seam . fold Figure 3.

Specimens are recorded from Santee, Yankton-Yanktonai, and Teton sources, and were collected at Ft. Buford, Ft. Rice, Ft. Totten, Devil's Lake, Standing Rock, Cheyenne River, Pine Ridge, and Rosebud reservations. Based on documented specimens, this rectan gular form of cradle may be designated as Sioux type. There is only a single documented specimen collected among the Sisseton (NMNH L-78). Without specific information on its manufac ture, this seems insufficient evidence to establish the production of soft cradles among the Santee, or Eastern Sioux. I have found only a few cradles documented to Yankton-Yanktonai sources. While the number is too few to make a definite statement, it appears that a soft trapezoidal tab, wider at the bottom edge than at the point of at tachment, characterizes cradles from this source. The majority of identified Sioux cradles are from Teton, or Lakota, sources. There are two documented rectangular soft cradles collected from non-Sioux sources that should be considered in defining the range of this cradle type. One at the Museum of the 99</page><page sequence="6">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. 37, No. 139,1992 Figure 4. Front view of undocumented Sioux-type rectangular soft cradle with short beaded hide hood, long cloth wrapper, and pendant tab (LE/54-5/1/9, Courtesy of Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, University of Oklahoma). American Indian (MAI 5/7473) is recorded as collected by M.R. Harrington among the Southern Cheyenne. However, its exquisite floral quillwork clearly indicates a more north ern origin for the specimen. The second specimen, a beaded cradle hood (NMNH 153,573) donated to the Smithsonian by Capt. (later General) Richard H. Pratt and identified by him as "Apache," is more problematic, with its non-Apachean form and Northern Plains floral overlay beadwork. Pratt, the founder of Carlisle Indian School, had a close association with many Plains people during his military career and subsequent activities in Indian education (Pratt 1964). He personally provided the designation of Apache for this specimen, but no data on its collecting was recorded. The design layout of Cheyenne and Sioux cradles also differs, frequently allowing iden tification at a glance even when construction cannot be observed. The Cheyenne-type carrier design is closely tied to the triangular form of the hood. Most have a series of wide alternating dark and light transverse stripes. These are broken at the center by a slightly converging band extending from rim to tab. Small geometric motifs such as crosses, diamonds, or stepped tri angles may appear in the central or side fields (Fig. 2). Most cradle hoods are solidly beaded in lazy* stitch and the lanes are often wider than is usual in Cheyenne beadwork on other types of objects. A few hoods are not beaded but are decorated in transverse stripes composed of rows of cowrie shells, ribbon applique, or se quins. Tabs are always decorated, usually with solid beading, and are often further adorned with a small fringe of bead strands on the back and trifurcate pendants at the corners. Only one quilled Cheyenne-type carrier was found in the course of this study (MAI 1/2%). It consists of only the triangular hide hood without wrapper or tab and is adorned with narrow transverse stripes and a central rosette quilled in faded yel low, red, and purple accented with red feather 100</page><page sequence="7">Candace Greene] PLAINS SOFT CRADLES / X / v \ Figure 5. Back view of cradle illustrated in Figure 4. tufts. The catalog lists it as Crow collected by F.M. Covert, but there is no recorded documen tation and George Heye, who cataloged all the material coming into the museum at that time, was notoriously cavalier in his identifications. While its origin cannot be established with cer tainty, the design, materials, and colors make a Southern Cheyenne origin unlikely for this trian gular hood, thus suggesting the possibility of a broader range for this cradle type. Sioux-type cradles are more variable in design just as they are in construction. Beaded cradles generally have a solid field of white on which large geometric figures are evenly spaced with one centered at the top of the hood (Fig. 4). In some instances a central band runs from rim to tab as in Cheyenne-type cradles, but it is wider in order to match the tab width. Quilled cradles typically have a series of spaced stripes or nar row bands parallel to the edge of the carrier. The stripes are broken on the top of the hood by the placement of other design motifs or a large sec tion of solid figured quillwork, broader than the central band of its beaded counterpart. Zoomorphic representations are fairly common on cradle hoods. Of all tabbed cradles, only eight examples of the Sioux-type have been found attached to wooden frames. Four are on lattice frames con structed similarly to Sioux and Cheyenne cradle board frames but of narrower, lighter weight slats with forked rather than pointed tips. They also differ in method of attachment. While cradleboard sacks are usually tightly lashed to the frames along their length, these tabbed cradles are tied only at top and bottom and could easily be removed. Two additional specimens are attached to single narrow boards with a decorated projection at the top. The two final specimens are carelessly tied to lattice frames that are the wrong size and probably were added by collectors who believed that cradles belonged on frames and sought to correct this presumed omission. In fact, frames appear to have been an 101</page><page sequence="8">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. 37, No. 139,1992 SIOUX-TYPE SOFT CRADLE \ / - v % f-^ '' : : ^ front view back view COMPONENT PARTS / hood \ \ L- /_._&gt; ? ?I back | j tab - cut edge interior tab . seam extension . fold Figure 6.

No Cheyenne-type triangular hood cradles have been found with frames. HISTORICAL CONNECTIONS: THE T-SEAM CRADLE While the triangular Cheyenne-type and rectangular Sioux- type of soft cradle were clearly the common forms during the reserva tion period when most specimens now in museums were collected, some other forms of construction have been preserved. There are four early cradles in the collec tion of the Smithsonian that closely resemble the later Southern Cheyenne carriers in the decora tive field but differ in material and construction. Three (NMNH 8855, 8856, &amp; 8868) were col lected in Kansas in the 1860's by G.M. Sternberg and identified as Cheyenne by the collector; another (NMNH 1958; Fig. 8) was collected on the Upper Missouri River in the 1850's by G.K. Warren and identified (apparently by him) as Sioux.4 Each of these cradles was cut from a single piece of buffalo hide with the hair on, folded skin side out, and stitched with a T shaped seam on the top of the hood (Fig. 9). The 102</page><page sequence="9">Candace Greene] PLAINS SOFT CRADLES Figure 7. Sioux-type rectangular quilled hide cradle with cloth lining but no wrapper. The tab is composed of quill-wrapped slats. (358,023, Courtesy of National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution). decorated field on each is triangular and con sists of a series of transverse stripes interrupted at the center by two converging lines running from rim to peak, essentially the same design configuration as later Cheyenne cradles. The triangular fields of the three Cheyenne specimens are worked with seed beads in solid lazy stitch. Two have broad transverse bands in blue and white broken at the center by narrower bands of blue and dark red with black edging; the third has bands of green and yellow broken by narrower bands of pink and dark red edged in black. The central bands are echoed by short sections of the same colors and composition defining the outer edges of each triangular field. The specimen collected by Warren is quilled with a series of spaced transverse stripes worked in a two-thread technique. The quills are predominately orange with narrow sections of blue edged with black inserted to form a pattern of two lines converging from rim to peak, with similar blue sections defining the outer edges of the triangular field. Tufts of blue yarn further emphasize the blue quilled sections. None of these cradles has a tab at the top although all have a squared peak. The three specimens iden tified as Cheyenne are unstitched at the top, sug gesting that previous tabs may have been lost. The Warren specimen is securely stitched and the seam covered with a short section of lazy stitch done in pony beads. It was clearly made without a tab. Beaded trifurcate pendants at the top corners of the hoods identical to the ones on later Cheyenne specimens have survived on all of these cradles except one. The T-seamed carrier can logically be es tablished as the historical antecedent of the tri angular Southern Cheyenne form. The change in construction from a single folded piece to separately cut hood and wrapper can be linked to the shift from cradles made entirely of hide to the use of a skin hood attached to a cloth wrap per. The triangular decorative field established in the T-seam cradle remained the same and 103</page><page sequence="10">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. 37, No. 139,1992 ^^^^^^^^ Figure 8. T-seam buffalo hide soft cradle ornamented with porcupine quill embroidery, yarn tufts, and pony bead edging. Collected on the Upper Missouri by G. K. Warren in the 1850s. (1958, Courtesy of National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution). defined the size and shape of the much smaller hide piece required for the hood of the modified cradle form. Only two Cheyenne carriers from the reservation period made entirely of hide were located in the course of this study (OMNH E/45-6/2/4; NMNH 152,804). Both are con structed with upright tabs and the T-seam top, further supporting this historical connection. In terestingly, both are decorated with dyed grass or "corn husk" embroidery, a Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho craft specialty, in addi tion to beadwork. An increasing scarcity of hides large enough to make an entire cradle may have motivated the change in form. The wrappers on both of the reservation specimens cited above had to be pieced to achieve the necessary size. Ewers (1980: 78) has noted a similar modification in women's dress styles on the Southern Plains due to a scarcity of hides during the reservation period. A canvas or muslin wrapper may also have had advantages of comfort during the long period of hot weather each year in Oklahoma. The historical development of the soft cradle among the Sioux is less clear. The T-seam form appears to have been widespread at one time on the Central Plains and may have been produced by Sioux people based on the Warren specimen previously described. In addition to this large cradle, he acquired a small model or doll cradle (NMNH 1959) similar in appearance with a triangular decorative field worked in pony beads. It has a series of narrow blue transverse stripes, each broken at the center by a section of white and blue arranged to form two convergent lines from rim to peak, with similar white beads defining the outer edges of the triangular field. Like the larger specimen, it has two pendants at the tabless top and a line of lazy stitch over the top seam. In spite of these many similarities, however, it has the rectangular construction pat tern of later Sioux specimens, demonstrating 104</page><page sequence="11">Candace Greene] PLAINS SOFT CRADLES T-SEAM SOFT CRADLE / : N / f?- V. / \ front view back view COMPONENT PARTS i ^?i n \ / s N / one piece ' N optional tab hood and back y - cut edge . seam L-1 . fold Figure 9.

Both the pony beaded model and the larger quilled cradle have spaced stripes of decoration like later Sioux type specimens rather than the solid striping of the Cheyenne examples. Several undocumented doll-sized cradles of the T-seam type with triangular design field ap pear in collections variously attributed to the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho. It is notable that there are more miniature T-seam cradles than there are full- size examples. The form may have persisted in miniature after it became rare in full-size since only a small scrap of hide was re quired for its construction, while sufficient material for a large cradle was hard to come by. ARAPAHO INTERIOR FRAME CRADLES Although not technically a soft cradle be cause of the addition of a rigid support system, the interior frame cradles of the Northern Arapaho are clearly related to the other Central Plains forms here discussed. These Arapaho cradles are also of T-seam construction, al though cut to produce a more steeply peaked hood (Fig. 10). Their form and construction is well described in a publication of the Denver Art 105</page><page sequence="12">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. 37, No. 139,1992 Museum (Douglas 1969: 72-79), although Plate I (p. 78) misrepresents the layout of the skin covering, which actually more nearly ap proximates that shown here in Figure 9. The primary decorative scheme of most Arapaho cradles differs significantly from the Cheyenne and Sioux forms previously discussed. Rather than the large triangular or rectangular field, a single round or oblong quilled or beaded orna ment is sewn to the top of the hood. Additional ornamentation on this type of cradle includes two strips joined by quill wrapped slats around the opening, quill wrapped fringe with small hoof rattles at the peak of the hood, four similar pairs of loop rattles spaced around the opening, and quilled thongs to bind the infant in place. These cradles have no tabs or trifurcate pen dants. While most Arapaho specimens that have been preserved or published conform to this type, another decorative scheme much more closely related to the Cheyenne and Sioux forms was once produced. These were decorated with closely spaced stripes on both hood and wrap per. Unlike Sioux striped cradles, however, the stripes were not continuous. One set of stripes parallel to the opening of the carrier defined a triangular field on the hood while additional sets of stripes perpendicular to the opening ap peared on the body of the cradle. Thus while Sioux cradles have vertical stripes on the wrap per, these Arapaho cradle wrappers were orna mented with horizontal stripes. Arapaho striped cradles are known from two documented specimens and the un published field notes of Cleaver Warden preserved in the archives of the Field Museum of Natural History (Al-#l/8). In the Smith sonian is an Arapaho striped T-seam hide baby carrier (NMNH 165,774; Fig. 11), which was col lected by H.W. Voth, a Mennonite missionary, among the Southern Arapaho in Indian Ter ritory between 1882 and 1892. The hood has a triangular field embroidered with a series of spaced transverse stripes worked in colored plant fiber in a two-thread technique with smaller sections of porcupine quills. A conver gent band on the top of the hood is formed of colored sections inserted in the stripes and is delineated with yarn tufts which also appear along the outer edges of the triangular field. There are trifurcate pendants from the squared tabless peak of the hood. Stripes of similar embroidery are placed on the body of the wrap per at right angles to the triangular field on the hood. A series of loose thongs along the back of the carrier suggest that it was intended to be secured to a frame, probably a U-shaped inte rior frame of the type used among the Northern Arapaho. Very similar to this Southern Arapaho specimen is an interior frame cradle (FMNH 61,384) in the collection of the Field Museum of Natural History that was collected in 1900 among the Northern Arapaho by Cleaver War den, an Arapaho employed by George Dorsey. The hide cover is cut to the T-seam pattern and the hood section has a triangular decorative field composed of a series of spaced transverse stripes beaded in lazy stitch. The beads are predominantly yellow with sections of red in serted in the center to create a converging band of color edged with blue and white beads. The converging lines are emphasized with red yarn tufts as are the outer edges of the triangular field. Trifurcate pendants are attached at the peak of the hood. The body of the wrapper has a series of similar stripes at right angles to the field on the hood. In addition to acquiring specimens, Warden collected ethnographic data among both the Northern and Southern Arapaho, which formed the basis for a monograph on the Arapaho as sembled by Dorsey (n.d.) but never published. Both the manuscript and Warden's field notes (n.d.) are preserved in the archives at the Field Museum. Included with Warden's notes are sketches he made of five additional striped cradles, each conforming to the basic design of the collected specimens but with differing color. Warden reported that the striped style was adopted from the Cheyenne, who, however, filled in the space between the stripes (p.35). The striped cradles of the Arapaho bear a marked similarity to the previously described cradle (NMNH 1958) collected by G.K. Warren in the 1850's. They share T-seam construction, a triangular hood design composed of spaced transverse stripes with a central convergent 106</page><page sequence="13">Candace Greene] PLAINS SOFT CRADLES ^M^^^M, JI%tHB %Smn *Bf BSBIBIfc K '-- \ ^BBBBHhllfllBHMM w - * - &gt;v ' &lt; ? ~ * Figure 10.

The Warren cradle differs in lacking stripes on the body of the wrapper and shows no evidence of an internal frame. CRADLE SYMBOLISM The literature holds rich information on cradle symbolism for the Arapaho, limited infor mation for the Cheyenne, and almost nothing relating to the Sioux. It is clear in all instances, however, that designs were not related to the gender of the child as cradles were usually made before birth. Information on Arapaho cradle symbolism was recorded by Alfred Kroeber (1900a, 1900b, 1901, 1902), George Dorsey (n.d.), Cleaver Warden (n.d.), and Inez Hilger (1952). Kroeber's published work on Arapaho sym bolism is the best known source, and deals ex clusively with the type of cradle with a single applied ornament on the top of the hood. He noted that there were "two chief lines of sym bolism connected with this ornamentation. Ac cording to one interpretation, the various ornaments represent the child that is in the cradle. According to the other interpretation, these ornaments represent parts of the tent" (1902: 66). When viewed anthropomorphically, the ornament on the hood represented the child's skull, the quilled slats around the open ing were the child's hair, and the lashings were the ribs and legs. The same ornaments took on different meaning when the cradle was con sidered to represent a tent. In the simplest inter 107</page><page sequence="14">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST [Vol. 37, No. 139,1992 Figure 11. Southern Arapaho T-seam cradle ornamented with dyed corn husk embroidery, yarn tufts, and seed bead edging. Collected in Indian Territory by H. W. Voth in the 1880s. (165,774, Courtesy of National Museum of Natural History, Smith sonian Institution). pretation the cradle as a whole was likened to a tipi door. In more complex interpretations the top ornament was compared to a tent ornament, the fringe to the rattle fringe over the tipi door, and the lashings to pegs securing the tipi cover. Kroeber noted that similar or identical orna ments were in fact used in tipi decoration. He made no mention of the striped style of cradle, but continued with a rather vague discussion of camp circle symbolism associated with a beaded soft cradle, which he noted bore a remarkable resemblance to a Sioux cradle in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History (1902: 69). Arapaho informants consulted some years later by Sister Inez Hilger were insistent that the beaded cradles to which he referred were not Arapaho but had been made by Sioux and come into Arapaho possession through gift exchange. The Arapaho later sold these items to White collectors, thus accounting for their misidentification as Arapaho (Hilger 1952: 30), and for Kroeber's difficulty in securing informa tion from the Arapaho on their meaning. Manuscript material by Cleaver Warden (n.d.) and George Dorsey (n.d.) provides infor mation for 26 specific cradles in minute detail. (For comparative purposes only the broader levels of interpretation will be discussed here.) Their information expands upon Kroeber's anthropomorphic symbolism for the cradle but does not provide further information on the tipi imagery. According to their sources the central disk is variously interpreted as the whorl on the crown of the child's head, its brain, its intel ligence or instinct, the whirlwind, or the sun. The first four concepts are syntagmatically linked, while the fifth appears to be discrete. The quill wrapped slats around the cradle opening are the child's hair or its years of life. The bindings which are seven in number are its ribs or the seven periods since creation. The rattle fringe at the top of the cradle represents the child's ears or hearing. It may also be seen as the whirlwind 108</page><page sequence="15">Candace Greene] PLAINS SOFT CRADLES which represents the child's thoughts and ac tions; as raindrops, which represent visions of heaven; or as representations of the sun's power to develop life and vigor in the child. Four addi tional pendants attached to the sides of the cradle may represent the eyes and ears of the child, the four periods of life, the four corners of the earth, or the Four Old Men of the Arapaho cosmos. Symbolism of the striped cradles more closely follows the sun imagery than the anthropomorphic imagery of the disk cradles. The convergent band on the center of the hood is consistently reported as the path of the sun, while the transverse stripes represent thoughts directed toward the sun. The alternating colors around the edge of the hood represent the horizon. Those with four sets of colors stand for the Four Old Men while those with two refer to the heaven and the earth, also known as the Father and the Mother. There are no bindings and the stripes on the body of the wrapper are interpreted in the same way as those on the hood, although they may also refer to years of life. A pair of trifurcate pendants representing the child's instinct appear at the peak of the hood in place of the rattle fringe. A series of five pairs of loops or "buttons" down the front edge of the cradle is said to represent pulse points, fingers/toes, or sunbeams shining upon the baby. Information on Cheyenne cradle symbolism is not so extensively recorded with the only published reference appearing in P. Ehrenreich (1899:2), an English version of which is available in Boas's Primitive Art (1955: 91-93). The sym bolic interpretation of the cradle appears to be focused on the child and contains anthropomor phic elements as well as references to the course of life. According to Ehrenreich's informants, the converging central band on the hood repre sents the path of life of the child, alternating colors on the edge of the hood represent the child's age, and the figure in the center of the front of the tab is the child's heart. The trifurcate pendants on each side of the tab are the child's ears and the bead fringe in the back is the hair. Information on Sioux cradles is even more limited than that available for the Cheyenne. The only specific reference to cradles is Wissler's (1905:243) note that red stripes on ar ticles associated with women, including cradles, symbolized a life span. His information was ap parently based on a quilled soft cradle (AMNH 50/3115) collected at Pine Ridge in 1902 to which is attached a tag in his handwriting read ing, "red quilled line = span of life." This specimen is illustrated as Figure 79 in Wissler's "Decorative Art of the Sioux Indians" (1905). Given the morphological similarity of Cheyenne and Sioux cradles it might be tempt ing to extrapolate symbolic interpretation from one to the other. For example, as trifurcate pen dants on Cheyenne cradles symbolize ears, the same meaning might be assumed for similar pen dants on Sioux cradles. The detail of information available on Arapaho cradles, however, demonstrates that the attribution of meaning on the basis of similarity in form is hazardous. Com mon themes may run through the symbolic inter pretation of cradles among these three groups just as there are common decorative elements among the three cradle types, but the linkage of element and meaning is complex. It is evident that multiple interpretations are possible for the same cradle. For the Arapaho at least, cradles were multivalent sym bols operating at both syntagmatic and para digmatic levels. An individual element such as the disk ornament might carry a range of related meanings such as the whorl of hair, brain, or in telligence of the child. Multiple discrete sym bolic schemes encompassing all cradle parts may also be operating simultaneously. The cradle as a whole might be interpreted as a tipi, as an anthropomorphic representation of the child, or as a representation of the cosmos. Con versely, the same interpretation may be applied to cradles that are very different in appearance. Cosmological interpretations including the sun, its life-giving light, and the Four Old Men are provided for both disk and stripe style cradles of the Arapaho. In Table 1, Cheyenne, Sioux, and com parable anthropomorphic elements of Arapaho cradle symbolism are presented in relation to the decorative element to which they are at tached and to its position on the cradle.

Examination of particular cradle elements reveals that they gain their meaning primarily from their position on the cradle and the overall interpretive scheme that is being applied rather than from their specific form. Thus a variety of disks and oblongs on the hoods of Arapaho cradles are all interpreted as relating to the brain or to mental processes. Similarly the convergent band on the hood of the Cheyenne cradle continued to represent the "path of life" regardless of its internal decora tive elaboration. The meager cross-cultural data available similarly indicates a complex relationship of form and meaning. Identical cradle elements may be interpreted differently by two groups. The trifurcate pendants at the cradle peak are identified by the Cheyenne as representing hear ing, while the Arapaho associate them with in stinct. The convergent band on the hood, which was the "path of life" for the Cheyenne, was the path of the sun for the Arapaho. The Arapaho stripe style cradle may have been acquired from the Cheyenne, but it was firmly incorporated into Arapaho symbolic systems. The cradle symbolism of the Cheyenne and Arapaho are not, however, unrelated. Both share an anthropomorphic interpretation for the cradle, although different cradle and body parts are linked. Hair, for example, is associated with the beaded fringe on the tab of the Cheyenne cradle while for the Arapaho it is as sociated with the quilled slats surrounding the cradle opening. Reference to years, span, or path of life also recurs linked to various elements for the Cheyenne and Arapaho, and is the only information known for the Sioux. While certain decorative elements are specific to cradles, stripes are a motif appearing on many Central Plains objects, and are often associated with the invocation of blessings. A substantial amount of attention was devoted to the study of symbolism in Plains art in the early years of this century, largely under the direction of Franz Boas. Excited by the quantity of data Kroeber received from the Arapaho, he encouraged Wissler to seek similar information from the Sioux. While this has resulted in a substantial body of data available for study, the studies themselves were rather un successful in revealing much about the concep tual domain of those producing the symbols. In an effort to capsulize meanings and develop a lexicon of motifs, elements were often isolated and removed from context (for example, Wissler 1907). Information that has been preserved about cradle symbolism, however, demonstrates that elements gain meaning from their place ment within the context of an object rather than from their form alone and that multiple mean ings may co-exist without contradiction. CONCLUSION Detailed cross-cultural examination of Plains Indian soft cradles has contributed to a better understanding of the configuration and construction of this artifact type. It has been es tablished that soft cradles were a well developed Plains artifact form and were typically used without a board support. From the study of documented specimens, distinct cradle types associated with the Southern Cheyenne and the Sioux can be estab lished and recognized as related to Arapaho in terior frame cradles. In the definition of these types, features of construction were found to be more diagnostic than features of decorative design. This typology must, however, remain open ended regarding the distribution of cradle types among cultural groups and over time. Types are tightly but not necessarily exclusively linked with tribal groups. Additionally, the tem poral dimension is shallow. Almost all specimens are from the decades of the 1880's into the early twentieth century. There is not suf ficient data to reliably trace their development over time, but identification of the T-seam cradle provides a link between the Cheyenne tri angular hood cradle and the Arapaho interior frame cradle. The study of symbolism associated with soft cradles has also suggested avenues for broader investigations in the field of symbolic meaning in Plains art. Cradle elements appear to gain meaning primarily from their position within the overall composition rather than as isolated fea tures.

NOTES 1. Considering the nature of Plains concepts of artis tic authorship, the kinswoman who "made" the cradle may either have produced it with her own hands or sponsored its production by a noted craftworker (often herself a relative). 2. Lessard (1990) in a study confined to Lakota cradles concurs that carriers were intended primarily for use without rigid frames and that soft cradles were actually the common Lakota type. Her suggestion that rigid frame cradles were a rare form of limited distribution ("Influence of the Cheyennes who intermarried with the Oglala may have caused production of some Oglala cradles with at tached frames on the Pine Ridge Reservation..." p. 50) seems overstated given the number of well- documented cradleboards from a variety of Teton and Yankton Yanktonai sources. 3. Confusion between the people of origin and the point of collection troubled many collectors and Kroeber was not immune to this error. Even with greater experience among the Northern Arapaho, Kroeber (1902:69) collected and published a beaded cradle (AMNH 50/930) that Arapaho informants later identified as a gift from the Sioux (Hilger 1952: 30). 4. Hanson (1986) has sought to establish that Warren collected this material from the Ash Hollow battlefield and that it is specifically Brule.
