<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mark Glouberman "And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water" An Introduction to the Bible for Philosophers Tertullian's Question and Mine "Quid ergo Athenis et Hierosolymis." So asks the early church father Tertullian. 'What does Athens have to do with Jerusalem?' Taking a leaf from an even better-known Gospel-associated questioner, Pontius Pilate, Tertullian does not wait for an answer. For he asks the question rhetorically. 'In regard to the ultimate purpose and destiny of men and women, what in heaven's name could Athens have to do with Jerusalem?' "What is truth?" From the earliest days of methodical reflective intellection, this question, Pilate's question, has extended an RSVP to those schooled in the activity. In the pages following I argue that by studying what Jerusalem has to say about the truth we can learn something of the sort for instruction on which we look to philosophy but which for reasons having to do with the foundations of the discipline escapes inheritors of the Athenian legacy. In denying that Athens, the philosophical city, the city of reason, can instruct Jerusalem, the devotional city, the city of faith, Tertullian is not counseling irrationality. The claim is only that reason cannot take the full measure of (as Tertullian identifies them) the alephs and the tavs. In effect, Tertullian is maintaining that those who trumpet reason as authoritative across the gamut of truth thereby imperil their souls. They close themselves off from a region whose content is vital to the understanding of what their lives are all about. What belongs - differentially belongs - to Jerusalem? Like Tertullian, I hold that Athenian rationality, though valid in its sphere, suffers from a genuine limitation, and that Jerusalem makes good the lack. And like Tertullian, I hold that what Jerusalem, not Athens, is equipped to deal with bears on the reality of men and women.</page><page sequence="2">4 Mark Glouberman Let me rephrase the preceding question and my answer to it in a way that will put the reader into a frame of mind suited to the sequel. What is the style of thinking about things exemplified in the Bible? What does its difference from the Athenian style imply for philosophy? There is, I will argue, a distinctively biblical way of packaging reality, a way that the Bible underscores at the very start, in its account of the creation of men and women in the opening chapters of Genesis. The effect of the unavailability to adherents of Athens of this way comes out most clearly (as this implies) in the human sector. Though the preceding assertions resonate with Tertullian's brief for Jerusalem, I am not writing as an apologist of any creed. The issue has more to do with the sort of thing to which Book Z of Aristotle's Metaphysics is given over than with the contents of the Book of Revelation. From the standpoint of what I have to say, it is only therefore in Socrates's sense that I say of whole-hearted devotees of Athens that they put their souls at risk. Single-minded devotion to reason as a conduit to the truth leaves them with a flawed knowledge; flawed, especially, in regard to themselves. So far as my argument goes, this is so irrespective of whether men and women are part of a higher plan. I also hold, therefore, that by focusing on what Athens the philosophical can learn from Jerusalem the biblical, men and women for whom the Bible is Holy Writ are put into a position to see that at the heart of the biblical way is something that isn't a matter of religiosity at all. 'What', I anticipate the reader asking, 'about God? Isn't the character named "God" of Jerusalem's essence qua Jerusalem? And isn't this character the aleph of religiosity?' It is indeed through the character named 'God' that Jerusalem's distinctiveness is conveyed in the text that transmits Jerusalemite wisdom. It is not at all obvious, however, that the distinctiveness requires a transcendent deity. 'Transcendent of reason' does not, that is, automatically convert to 'transcendent' simpliciter. The Bible without God, I am therefore claiming, is not Hamlet without the Prince. I've used the phrase 'Athens the philosophical'. Philosophy is a large tent. But what I shall say in criticism of Athens the philosophical is not based on a tendentious constriction of philosophy's ambit. At the end of the discussion I will show that the relevant surplus of biblical Jerusalem over philosophical Athens emerges in quite central areas of mainstream philosophy: in ethics; in political philosophy; in the philosophy of mind; even in logic.</page><page sequence="3">"And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water" 5 Thaies and the Genesis of Philosophy In Plato's dialogue Protagoras (342e-343b), Socrates lists the seven wise men of antiquity. Thales of Miletus is identified as one. About several of the septet we know next to nothing. Thales lives on as more than just a name. Philosophy - etymologically, the love of wisdom - is said to be his baby. Over in Jerusalem, a paragon of wisdom is present too. King Solomon is indeed not just another sage. Since his portion of wisdom (epitomized in a story about a baby) is represented in Scripture as God-given, not as gained by personal toil and sweat, he is a sage of higher order. It is standard for historians of philosophy to describe Thales as 'the father' of the discipline. Solomon, for his part, is intimately associated with the Bible and its formation. Three magnificent biblical books, Song of Songs, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes, are attributed to him. These two brains of yore therefore divine for us the wellsprings both of Athens the philosophical and of Jerusalem the biblical. As we shall see, the difference between Athens and Jerusalem can be capsuled in terms of claims that are attributed to the pair. Thales is associated with a number of antique happenings. Herodotus informs us of one of these and of Thales's connection to it. Thales (so the father of history reports in Histories I) foretold an eclipse of the sun that occurred in his part of the sky on, in our reckoning, 28 May 585 BCE. Thales's prediction and his philosophical paternity go hand in hand. To appreciate the bond, it suffices to look beyond what Thales reputedly did to how he did it. The prediction of the eclipse is an epitome of a new way of looking at the world. To have figured out that the lunar body would pass in front of the solar one on precisely that day in precisely that location, Thales had had painstakingly to plot movements that were recognized on a gross level as having some regularity to them, and then he had had to extrapolate from the results. To have succeeded in the effort is to have confirmed the capacity of human reason by its unaided powers to deliver the goods with respect to the goings on on high. Here is a distillate of what Thales did (Barnes 1987, 16): the Presocratics ... hit upon that special way of looking at the world which is the scientific or rational way. They saw the world as something ordered and intelligible, its history following an explicable course and its different parts arranged in some comprehensible system. The world was not a random collection of bits, its history was not an arbitrary series of events.</page><page sequence="4">6 Mark Glouberman Still less was it a series of events determined by the will - or the caprice - of the gods. Observe that Barnes's short description contains several words expressive of the characteristics that draw Tertullian's criticism of Athens: 'rational'; 'ordered and intelligible'; 'explicable'; 'comprehensible'. This will become important presently. If the Presocratics 'hit upon' this way of looking at the world, their predecessors, it may be inferred, saw things differently. Since Barnes's view is that the Presocratics were iconoclasts, boldly going where pre-Presocratics treads never trod, it seems proper to characterize the content of their perception by negating the listed terms. May we not then say that for those who came before Thales the world was lacking in order and intelligibility; that for them the world was inexplicable; that to them the world was not comprehensible? Though we may say these things, we should not. It's not just that the members of a living culture would never characterize the culture's grasp of the world as globally deficient in any of these ways. For instance: prior to the seventeenth century, no man or woman in Europe would have said that his or her understanding was non-scientific, much less conceded that it was faulty as a consequence. But although such an unfavourable assessment would never in fact be delivered from a standpoint that isn't displaced in cultural time and/or in cultural space, what is being said may yet be true. Wasn't medieval understanding non-scientific? The problem with the characterizations is that the negations, because they are unqualified, can easily generate falsehoods. The most that can safely be said of the medieval Europeans is that they did not understand the world in the scientific way. Just so, the most that can safely be said is that those who came before Thales did not see the world as ordered in the way that Thales did, and so forth. This is far different from saying that they saw the world as disordered simpliciter. Barnes does not in fact speak only in negative terms. For the pre-Thalean men and women, the world is, he states (1987, 17), a field in which 'the will - or caprices - of the gods' come to visible expression. The pre-Thaleans were - so Barnes is conveying through his phraseology - superstitious. But, on reflection, how is speaking of divine caprice more than a colourful way of speaking of phenomena lacking in enough regularity to support the confident making of predictions? If it is no more, we too are subject to Barnes's</page><page sequence="5">"And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water" 7 strictures, since irregularity, and hence unpredictability, are common in our experience. Not that the world was to the pre-Thaleans a blooming, buzzing, confusion. Who doesn't know that the phases of the moon follow a regular and predictable pattern - a fact that explains the use of the lunar calendar in so many temporally and spatially unconnected cultures? Usually (to extend this example), our (solar) calendars note the phases of the moon. This, no doubt, is because, the etymology of 'month' not withstanding, a month by these calendars is disconnected from 'the lesser light that rules the night' (Genesis 1:14). (Unless otherwise indicated, all quotations from the Bible are drawn from the New Revised Standard Version [NRSV].) In this part of the world, any July day is with rare exceptions fairer than any day in January. But while it would therefore be foolish to schedule the company picnic in January, the July date comes without guarantees of warm breezes. Suppose that the day in July chosen for the picnic turns out to be stormy. 'That', we would say, 'is bad luck'. When we say this, does it indicate devotion on our part to Tyche, and hence mark us as irrational? Barnes's assertion that the Presocratics 'hit upon' the new way of looking at the world seesaws between two grades of novelty. (1) Low-grade novelty: Thales &amp; Co. cultivated what was already present in germinal form. (2) High-grade novelty: Thales &amp; Co. came up with something unprecedented. Barnes's talk of gods and their caprices tilts the discussion towards (2). But (1), I submit, is closer to the mark. The fact that Thales emerged in Greece is (as will become clearer once we move on to Jerusalem, where the closest counterpart to Thales is the tales, the prayer shawl) is confirming evidence of my submission. Was the cultural ground only fertile for the Presocratics, or did their move also supply the humus? Barnes's mention of the gods suggests that Thales performed a great escape from a culture of fuddlement. In actuality he took a ride on what was extant, using the borrowed momentum to go farther. Grant that the whims of the gods were cited to explain certain events. This, as I just said, means that such events were experienced as having too much irregularity to support predictions. And this means that an increase in predictability would have been welcomed, since unpredictability in dealings with the (natural) world is always inflected negatively. The men and the women at the time looked to soothsayers and haruspicators. But that is because they were unable (as Thales proved able) to figure it out for themselves.</page><page sequence="6">8 Mark Glouberman There is a sense, then, in which science and philosophy are Athens's natural destination. (More accurately put: the exploration of science and philosophy as approaches to the world is a natural destination. These ways might after all have disappointed. My thesis is that with respect to the essence of human reality they do come a cropper.) Unlike Abraham, Thales did not have to leave his father's house and depart his native land in order to reach his Promised Land. To the best of our knowledge, Miletus, Thales's home town, remained his home base. In a manner that confirms this contrast with the biblical case, Barnes in a later phase of discussion of Thales mentions the cultural colossi Homer and Hesiod, to whom the Greeks will have looked for an understanding of themselves and of their world just as Jerusalemites look to the Bible. "All this," Barnes writes (1987, 56), "is myth; but it is, as it were, scientific myth." In effect, if Thales is rational, then Thales's predecessors were not irrational; they were proto-rational. The pre-Presocratics were proto-Presocratics. It is worth pausing here to draw slightly more concretely an initial contrast with Jerusalem. Consider the myth that 'explains' the change of seasons: Hades of the dark underworld takes forcible possession of Proserpine from her mother Demeter, the harvest deity, for half the year. One searches in vain for such myths in Genesis. To be sure, in the biblical field God is behind the workings of nature, and is frequently depicted as employing nature to encourage and to admonish. But to speak of a deity as controlling and making use of nature is quite different from speaking of a deity as expressing itself through nature. Only in the latter case does the appeal to the gods and their doings qualify as explanatory of the relevant phenomena. Let me couch this in typological terms. Greek religion is pagan in character: nature-based and nature-focused. The first generation deities are identifiable with the most general natural features, Ouranos with the heavens, Gaia with the earth. The chief Olympians, though they parcel out sovereignty over nature in a more granular way, are also identifiable with nature: Zeus reigns over the sky; Poseidon dominates the waters; Hades rules in the nether region. The early natural speculators in Greece did not so much exorcize the gods as sanitize them. By dint of the slant of the culture these speculators were primed to take that step. Science is in effect paganism cleansed of its superficial anthropomorphism. Scientists are pagans minus the superstition. They are pagans gone rational. It is not therefore at all surprising to find latter-day scientists of an indeterministic persuasion using</page><page sequence="7">"And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water" 9 the word 'tychistic' to describe the world. In using such a term, they are drawing on the verbal resources of their juvenility. None of these features is present on the biblical side. God's use of nature is a motif in the Bible. By contrast with Zeus, Poseidon, Apollo, and so forth, God does not express his own nature through nature. Qua ontologically independent of the natural world, God could not express his nature through nature. To understand God's nature, the biblical thinkers would have said, it is of no use to study nature. This brings us to two other features of Thales's thought. The first is Thales's proposition that water is the principle (arche) of all things. The second is his proposition that all things are full of gods. (Aristotle reports, and conjecturally glosses, the two claims, the first in Metaphysics 1.983b20, the second in On the Soul 1.411a9-10.) Both continue to be picked over by the scholars. But the general tendency of the propositions is clear once we factor in the subsequent tradition that extended what Thales initiated. The claim about water is the claim that at the base of nature there is a single natural element, the choice of water as basis being natural (though not obligatory) because water is the sole substance encountered in all three physical forms. The idea would be that further rarefaction of vapor will generate the yet more ethereal fire, and further condensation of ice, still heavier things like stone. And the claim about gods is the claim that the principle of life, of animation, is present in matter, so that men and women have a nature that is natural. In effect, we have here a mixture of ontological naturalism and reductionism with respect to human reality, both of which have not only survived into present-day philosophy, but are also dominant role players. Thales redux! The Road Forks With the discussion in its present state we find ourselves at a parting of the ways. In one direction the road leads to Athens; in the other, to Jerusalem. Though I shall not go beyond the mention of the fact in this paragraph, the fork is also a point of leave taking between two sides of Greek culture, the philosophical side and a non-philosophical one. I quoted a claim of Barnes's about Homer and Hesiod. What he states is, I am sure, a serious misunderstanding. Pace Barnes, Hesiod and Homer were not using (or tailoring and/or making) myth</page><page sequence="8">10 Mark Glouberman by way of expressing (pre-Thalean) claims about the unpredictability, the disorderliness, or the irrationality of the natural world. The subject matter of science wasn't their concern. Distinctively human reality was their concern. Consider now the idea of caprice. We all would agree that the ascription of flightiness to nature is anthropomorphic. But as applied to men and women, there is nothing figurative about such talk. La donna e mobile. So sings the Duke of Mantua in Rigoletto. 'Anthropomorphic', if one applied the adjective to the Duke's description of the woman as fickle, would be a wisecrack. In other words, the attribution of capriciousness to men and women, by contrast with its attribution to the (weather) god, is not a negative. To be sure, unpredictability in the realm of human affairs is often unwelcome. But a lament, if it comes, will be accompanied with a resigned Horatian sigh of 'Eheu' or one of its many counterparts, e.g., the Yiddish 'Oy vey'. Inconstancy is accepted as an ineluctable fact about men and women; and accepted, when it doesn't cause pain, or upon reflection after the pain abates, as one of the constitutive features of our journey through the human realm. Only if the principle of human reality is taken to be the same as that of extra human nature could the two sorts of unpredictability be run together. The point of importance, then, has to do with the status of men and women. Are they, so to speak, versions of the gods, or do they have a different character? The basic trend of Greek philosophical thinking is in the direction of the first disjunct. Accordingly, in the Athenian context, whatever has not yielded to rationalization, whatever comes over as lacking in intelligibility, whatever is affected by disorderliness, is stamped 'problematic'. Thus the constant complaint from the philosophical side against the representation of the gods as bickering among themselves. In his discussions of Homer, Plato never tires of pressing this complaint against the poet. And the rising scientific way of thinking is designed to solve that problem. Thus the Greek conception of the world as a kosmos - an orderly, even aesthetically pleasing, whole. But this, as I pointed out just above, has implications for human reality. Monotheism Speaking conceptually, I said that Thales did not have to leave the land of his nativity to make the contribution for which history plumes him. His home environment was receptive to, even to some degree prepared for, what</page><page sequence="9">"And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water" 11 he did. In the biblical narrative, Abraham does leave his father's house. In having him make that passage from the place of his nativity and formative acculturation, the Bible is dramatizing the point that Abraham's novelty is, in effect, a break or rupture. From what is Abraham taking leave? The goal is to found a new faith, one whose (sole) deity is God. Thus God's summons in Genesis 12:1: "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you." But it is more informative to say that Abraham is breaking with paganism than to characterize him as departing a creedal worldview that accepts a pantheon. In fact, as I shall explain, 'polytheism', though the standard label for what Abraham opposes, is a misleading label whose continued use perpetuates deep misunderstandings. Leaving Babylon is in the respect that is relevant in the Bible like leaving Greece. The Bible would have been as critical of Greece as it is of Babylon. For Babylon too is, on the creedal side, pagan. Early philosophy (as represented by Thales) and biblical thought may seem to have a common strain. Both take aim at pagan thinking. The appearance of a meeting of minds, we now understand, is illusory. Athenian opposition to paganism is internal. Athens wants to patch up pagan thinking. Jerusalemite opposition is external. Jerusalem is hell bent on junking paganism. As Elijah later says to the Israelites assembled on Mount Carmel: "IftheLordis God,follow him; butifBaal,then follow him"(l Kings 18:21). It's Either/Or. I will now show how very different in character is the drive to unity central to the Bible ('monotheism') from the corresponding drive ('kosmos', 'monism') in Athens. I proceed by offering a criticism of the view of a biblical commentator on the Bible's major novelty. The commentator's view, we shall see, does not justify the representation of Abraham as departing his native land. The received label for the biblical revolution is 'monotheism'. The ancien regime is, then, polytheism. Why should the cardinality of the set of deities be of such moment? If in creating the world and running it Yahweh had had "a helper as his partner" (Genesis 2:18), what else would have had to change in the text besides the grammatical number of the relevant subject terms (from singular to plural) and, correspondingly, the verbs? True, no polytheistic creed could consistently enjoin the worship of only one deity. But is this anything over and above a simple entailment of the general principle 'n gods,</page><page sequence="10">12 Mark Glouberman n objects of worship', monotheism being the case for n = 1; atheism, for n = 0? What polytheistic creed, however, encourages cold-blooded murder or holds theft up as a virtue? In what polytheistic creed is disrespect for parents tolerated, let alone commanded? In respect of the biblical ordinances and statutes that specifically constrain and shape everyday relations between people, creeds that accept a multiplicity of higher beings do not seem to line up on the side of what the Bible designates as vice. As to the multiplicity of higher beings itself: assuming that the horses do not pull in entirely different directions, a troika can deliver the rider to Canaan from Haran just as can a cabriolet. Even in a polytheistic position as raucous as the Olympian, the different agendas usually resolve to a single direction of movement. For that matter, in the Bible with its single deity there is quite a lot of backing and forthing. Functionally, isn't a deity who changes his or her mind equivalent to a number of deities who are differently minded? The scholars are adamant that monotheism, the Bible's novelty, is the core of a radical explosion. I am of the same view. But, as the following sample from the professional literature illustrates, at least one scholar has trouble explaining satisfactorily how the novelty is more than cosmetic. In his introduction to the Anchor Bible installment on Genesis, E. A. Speiser writes as follows: "the genesis of the biblical process is bound up with the beginnings of the monotheistic concept; both converge in the age, and presumably also the person, of Abraham" (Speiser 1964, xlix). And again (ibid.): "The history of the biblical process is ultimately the story of the monotheistic ideal in its gradual evolution." At the start of his Homeric career, Achilles is appealed to by Hera and Athena. 'Obey us both' says the gray eyed goddess to the Abraham of the piece, staying the warrior's hand as he is about to kill Agamemnon. Suppose that Abraham's theophany had also featured a set of deities. Or, alternatively, imagine that the Ten Commandments had opened with 'We are your gods. Have no other gods before us'. In each instance, need anything besides the grammar of the text have changed? Given the importance that Speiser attaches to monotheism, it is more than just mildly surprising to find that his overall treatment does not supply an affirmative answer. Making reference to (polytheistic) Babylon, Speiser (1964, xlviii) motivates the reduction in the cardinality of deities by speaking of an inversely proportional increase in clarity.</page><page sequence="11">"And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water" 13 In Mesopotamia, the very tenets that stimulated the social growth of the country proved to be a source of weakness in its spiritual progress. The terrestrial state was non-autocratic because man took his cue from the gods; and in the celestial state no one god was a law unto himself, not even the head of the pantheon. All major decisions in heaven required approval by the corporate body of the gods. And since nothing was valid for all time, the upshot was chronic indecision in heaven and consequent insecurity on earth [about spiritual destiny]. But the reduction to one deity comes across along these lines only as desirable, not as theoretically mandatory, and the contrast between a single deity and a plurality of deities comes across only as a weak contrast between positions on a continuum. Moreover, as I pointed out a few paragraphs back, (the uncontested) God in the Bible is often of more than one mind, so that in the matter of the categorical nature of divine decision there is functionally no difference between the biblical arrangement and the Babylonian one. At the end of the day, Speiser's discussion leaves the impression that while the monotheistic declaration, historically speaking, precipitated the new position and supplied the rallying cry for the crusading enthusiasts of a new faith, it was but a catalyst for changes that could have come to pass in other ways. To sustain his claims about monotheism, Speiser, it therefore appears, needs something deeper than the numerical distinction between one and many. A more historical way of putting this critical interrogation of Speiser is available. Hammurabi's Code dated to the 18th century BCE, roughly the time of Abraham's (conjectural) departure from the lower Euphrates. The Code has elements in common with the biblical position. Notably, it contains the lex talionis: 'An eye for an eye'. Some scholars see a real world link with (the historical correlate of the Bible's) Abraham, who is called by God out of Hammurabi's Mesopotamia. The intriguing idea is that Abraham's departure from that part of the world is precipitated by a desire to ground the newly encoded moral precepts in less contested soil. A similar historical story can be told about Israel's other exodus, from Egypt. There we have Akhenaten, whose dates correspond to the conjectural date of the departure from the land of the pharaohs, and who figures in Sigmund Freud's imaginative take, in the book Moses and Monotheism, on Moses and what he wrought.1 1 The name 'Moses' is of Egyptian character, as are 'Miriam', 'Phineas', and 'Hofni', the names of Moses's sister and of his brother Aaron's grandsons. As far as the link between Akhenaten and the new monotheistic faith is concerned, the experts</page><page sequence="12">14 Mark Glouberman Speiser would find the idea hard to swallow. If a functionally monotheistic view arose within a pagan environment, one would suspect that the environment was receptive. If so, Genesis's advertising agents and publicists are, knowingly or not, exaggerating the Bible's iconoclasm. This has to be a real source of worry for those of Speiser's persuasion, since, as I just showed, Speiser's reading of monotheism does not in the first place make the 'one deity' creed so very different from the alternative. These dialectical considerations are void of probative force. Perhaps monotheism isn't in fact all that different. It could be that though appreciably different from what is creedally on offer, monotheism did in fact get a foothold in a hostile context. The cultures could have been smorgasbords. But it would be most satisfying if (as Speiser himself believes) monotheism did have a different root meaning, and that this meaning was for some principled reason unavailable on the alternatives. I will now show that monotheism does have such a meaning. Let me set the issue up by propounding a condition whose satisfaction on the part of an interpretation of the Bible would ceteris paribus elect that interpretation over others. Earlier I asked the following question. 'If the Ten Commandments had opened with "We are your gods. Have no other gods before us," need anything besides the grammar of the text have changed?' However the Bible is read, it must be read so that the members of the audience who take on its creedal commitments are primed to adhere to the Decalogue. A proper reading of the Bible should therefore identify some fairly plausible internal link between the specific injunctions and ordinances promulgated therein and the mentioned commitments. The more plausible the link that a reading presents, the higher the reading will be rated, all other things being equal. Moreover, and despite what I said earlier about polytheism and virtuous conduct, the internal connection should be absent from the competing belief systems against which the Bible rails. The Bible, I repeat, does come with commitments. To deny that the Bible is a religious text is not to say otherwise. Nor, unless we define clarity of thought in terms of their acceptance, is it to are divided. James P. Allen (1989, 89) approvingly quotes a claim by Jan Assman: "We stand here at the origin less of the monotheistic world religions than of natural philosophy. If [Akhenaten's] religion had succeeded, we should have expected it to produce a Thales rather than a Moses."</page><page sequence="13">"And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water" 15 say that any clear thinker would accept the commitments. Again, it is only to say that the commitments are not ones that men and women who characterize themselves as religious claim to see there and to make their own. Likeness and Dominion Thales said that all things are full of gods. The Bible contains a similar sounding assertion: all men and women are made in God's image and likeness. But, of course, the two assertions are entirely different. The one applies to everything; the other, only to one sector of things. The first chapters of Genesis tell two stories of the creation. It is generally recognized that the second account is centred on human reality. Though the human centring does not evade notice, what the second account brings distinctively with it has however evaded understanding. Both in Genesis 1 and in Genesis 2 men and women are described as occupying a distinctive position. Obviously, the writers of the text are interested in playing up the specialness of men and women among creatures. In the Genesis 1 account, men and women come into being on the afternoon of the sixth and last day of creation: as near to the end, given how the creative span is divided up, as possible. To be sure, in a finite (and non-circular) series, something's got to be last. But men and women are distinguished in Genesis 1 by more than being last. God makes everything (except perhaps the initial chaos). Of men and women alone is it stated that God makes them "in [his] image, according to [his] likeness" (26). We do not know what God is like. Since we can look at one another, we know quite well however what men and women are like. So the meaning of the 'image-and-likeness'-claim (hereafter, 'the likeness-claim') is obscure. The same verse does however offer, or seem to offer, something clearer: God's assertion that men and women are to have 'dominion' (ibid.) over the other creatures ('the dominion-claim'). The dominion-claim is usually misunderstood, though I would say that the misunderstanding is due as much to the influence of distinctively modern (e.g., ecological) preoccupations as it is to the obscurity of what the Bible has in mind. Often, the dominion-claim is construed as the claim that men and women have the right to control ('to dominate') nature. But God does not first create men and women in his image and likeness, and only afterwards, as an added</page><page sequence="14">16 Mark Glouberman boon, bestow upon them what 'dominion' purports. The dominion-claim and the likeness-claim are not loose and separate from one another. To be like God is (=) to have dominion. The Bible's point is that men and women stand in a relation to nature - 'having dominion' - which is like God's relation to the world. Why do they stand to the world in that relation? They do, because they are like God. To have dominion is what being Godlike entails. It is not an add-on to Godlikeness. What, then, is dominion? The Hebrew word translated as 'have dominion' is a form of a verb uses of which can have a harsh sense. Understandably, this has led readers of verse 26 to think of the dominators as trampling on and subduing the sub-human, a thought that plays right into the hands of ecologically-minded critics of the Bible. But a more nuanced reading is possible. At the core of the idea of dominating is the topological notion of standing above. To dominate in the sense of standing above is not necessarily to trample. In Leviticus 25:43, it is said that Hebrews who due to reversals of fortune have put themselves in servitude are not to be "ruled over ... in harshness." If 'ruled over' carried the sense of 'harsh', the adverbial phrase would not have been necessary. I suggest that the (neutral) topological connotations are the relevant ones. To say that men 'dominate' is to say that they are 'above'. And that is what God ('Dominus' in Latin) is, though 'outside' would be better for eliminating the evaluative residues that adhere to 'above' and 'below'. (Indeed, 'outside' is even better, since talk of being outside is often talk of disadvantage, and the Bible is far from seeing the extra-natural condition of men and women as an unmixed blessing. Consider the tribulations of the man and the woman after they leave the Garden, a leave-taking that is a model of their general condition upon forcibly exiting the womb. For the Bible, the 'outsideness' constitutes the distinctive predicament of men and women among created things.) Men and women are in some sense external to nature. Their native condition is the condition of the stranger, the alien, the foreigner. They are not parts of nature in the way that the other elements of creation are. In this regard, they exemplify the chief characteristic of the biblical deity, viz., extra-natural status, a characteristic that pagan gods, being of nature, in principle do not have. Along with this gain in understanding - 'having dominion over nature' means 'standing outside of nature' - there is, regrettably, a loss in clarity. I said that while the likeness-claim is obscure (we do not know what God is</page><page sequence="15">"And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water" 17 like), the dominion-claim is clear (we know that men and women to some extent control nature). But on the preceding gloss of 'having dominion over' the latter clarity has been lost. Nonetheless, we do appreciate that in linking the dominion-claim internally with the likeness-claim, the Bible is expressly saying that to understand the nature of men and women one cannot say that they are on top of the food chain, or that they come late, or come last, in the evolutionary process. The separateness is of a different, and stronger, character. Compatibly with the stronger form of separateness, men and women could be in the middle of the food chain, and they could have emerged anywhere in the species-generative process. To appreciate that this is the case, consider the following. Men and women come into being last in the creation as described in Genesis 1. This is seen even by secular readers as more or less true to the facts. But even if it is true that men and women are the latest (if not necessarily the final) mammals, how do the writers know it to be true? Their knowledge of the animal world was not very extensive. My point is that since what the Bible says accords with a view (probably false) that the readers themselves accept, it doesn't occur to them to ask why the Bible writers say it. They simply assume that the Bible writers say it for the same reason that they do. Of course, the Bible writers do not know any such thing, and it would in any case be foolish to ascribe to them knowledge that we have (or think that we have) due to what we have learned (or think that we have learned) some two millennia later. By placing the creation of men and women in the afternoon of the sixth day the writers are not making a point of the sort that naturalists would advance or reject on the strength of fossils, skeletal remains, etc. They are saying that men and women (though part of the natural world) are different. God is first: God is before the natural creation. Men and women are last: they are after the natural creation. Situated at the opposite ends, both, then, are not entirely part of the natural creation. The truth of 'not entirely part' is quite compatible in logic with men and women emerging on Tuesday afternoon, or on Thursday morning. That clear, we can appreciate, pace the Bible's many detractors from the ecological flank, that the outsideness of men and women is compatible with their lacking control. The two claims, of outsideness with regard to nature and of control over nature, are unrelated. We today may praise ourselves for the achievement over the elements of a mastery that would have left our forbears gape-mouthed. We are wise to restrain the self-congratulation, as</page><page sequence="16">18 Mark Glouberman we soon enough learn as (to give a recent instance) a small volcanic eruption in Iceland paralyses air travel in the west for weeks and has tens of thousands sleeping on terminal floors. The point of Genesis 1 is, then, that men and women are not part of the system that is nature. (This identifies a second reason that the Bible has for delaying the appearance of men and women. The Bible wants the system to be completed independently of them. The want is more clearly catered for by having men and women appear after nature is up and running.) This much is a declaration of independence from paganism. But only in Genesis 2 do we get the vital part of the story, a part that really is missing from Genesis 1. The Apple's Corps Genesis 2, by contrast with Genesis 1, represents the natural world as a backdrop for men and women. It is in Genesis 2 that God fashions the first man, and then from his rib fashions the first woman. And it is in the sequel to Genesis 2 that we get the transgression and the expulsion. (The first man is usually called 'Adam' by us. For this there is no textual justification, only an excuse; though, as will emerge, the use of the proper name is appropriate from a theoretical or conceptual standpoint. The first woman is called 'Eve', but only after the expulsion. What we are introduced to are referred to as 'the man' and 'the woman'.) In Genesis 1, men and women alone among creatures are fashioned in God's image and likeness. The difference in Genesis 2 is that the man (and through him the rest of humankind) is inspired with God's breath of life. Here is verse 7. Then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being. The reader might not see the distinction drawn in Genesis 1 between humankind and the rest of the creatures as very different from the distinction of Genesis 2. In both cases, men and women, and only men and women, have an affinity for God. But this is a very bad mistake. The verse set out just above is drawn from the NRSV. But the Hebrew does not have what the NRSV gives as 'formed man'. An accurate rendering would be: 'formed the man'. The definite article 'the' is affixed to both</page><page sequence="17">"And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water" 19 occurrences of the noun 'man', the second of which the NRSV itself gives as 'the man'. In the event, the inconstancy of translation is fully explained if we assume that the translators regard the distinction of Genesis 2 between men and women and the other creatures as not very different from the distinction of Genesis 1. Under such conditions, the dropping of 'the' would not be unreasonable. The first use of 'man' in verse 7 would hark back to (what is rendered as) 'humankind' in Genesis 1. Whatever the explanation, the translators elide the key difference between the two chapters.2 We are in contact here with the dead centre of the Bible's primeval story insofar as it bears on you and on me. The breath-of-life-claim is a claim that is not made, as is the likeness-claim, of the group. It is made of the numerically first man. Genesis 1 presents God creating 'humankind'. The pronouns are plural. Here is the whole of verse 27. So God created humankind in his image in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. The use of the plural forms continues systematically through the rest of the verses. In Genesis 2 the talk is all in the singular. This clarifies the breath-of life-assertion; more, it makes clear the link between that assertion and monotheism. The Bible's ontological point is that the elements of what is essentially a system lack strong individuality. ('Strong individuality' I will henceforth call 'particularity'. Strong individuals I will label 'particulars'.) The elements of a system are, like the Cheshire Cat's smile, separate only by courtesy. Often, the courtesy is extended by language, language supplying the wherewithal for nominalizing any descriptive word. 'Nadia's agility is astonishing'. 'The blue of the sky is soothing'. Nature, as even a modicum of serious thought brings out, is a system of exchanges: a cycling affair. When a spider traps a fly in its web, that is describable only anthropomorphically, hence distortively, as bad for the fly, or as good for the spider. For the 2 In fairness to those behind the NRSV I should say that the rendering of the first occurrence of 'ha-adam' in verse 7 as 'man' is widespread. The King James does the same. Speiser's translation (1964, 14) gives both occurrences of 'ha-adam' in verse 7 as 'man'. But then, in verse 8, the same Hebrew is rendered as 'the man'. This, in reverse, elides the theoretical/conceptual difference between Genesis 2 and Genesis 1.</page><page sequence="18">20 Mark Glouberman spider and its web are aspects of a wider whole that includes the fly. Each member of the system needs the other. To consider one aspect of the whole in isolation ('happy spider', 'poor fly') is to falsify. It makes perfect sense, then, that 'good' is the sole adjective used in Genesis 1. Whatever happens in the system is as it should be. The binary good-and-bad has no application. It is (only) in Genesis 2 that 'bad' comes into play. This is as it should be, and is not basically a moral business. It is also in Genesis 2 that death makes its first appearance. For death, the end of something's existence, does not apply within a system. Within a system, all we get is recycling. A reader who asked whether Genesis 1 isn't too rosy, nature being red in tooth and claw, now has an answer, one that indicates the Bible's conceptual acuity. In (sub-human) nature there is no death, just reorganization. 'What about the following assertion (Genesis 2:19) that God makes?' out of [the ground] you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return. 'Don't sub-human animals and plants also return to dust?' Unquestionably, the Bible intends a difference. In fact, the difference it has in mind is quite simple. Sub-human things do not return to dust. They do not return to it because they never leave it. In their regard, what we have, again, is reorganization. But when a man dies, that is a real end. Augustine, who straddles Jerusalem and Athens, gets this point exactly right, though he states it from the other end: "And so to provide [a] beginning, a man was created" (1984,502). That is, God created a man in order that the world should contain beginnings. In the human world alone, then, death has dominion. Why then is God separate from nature? This is not the religious believer's point. Not primarily, anyway. Primarily, it is the ontologist's point that particularity is unavailable within the natural realm. For the natural realm is essentially a system. Particularity is therefore unavailable to paganism; if particularity is found in the thought and talk of pagans, that is a sign of objectionable anthropomorphizing. The crucial point now is this. If particularity is unavailable on the pagan basis, then if the creation includes particulars, their character must be explicable in (partly) extra-natural terms. If so, they are, in the sense specified earlier, dominators: they are (in part) outside. So monotheism - in one narrative guise a departure from Mesopotamia in response to God's call to start a new enterprise, in a second, the exodus from</page><page sequence="19">"And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water" 21 Egypt engineered by God to receive his word at Mount Sinai - is a rejection of the pagan view that men and women are just parts of the system. The national liberation of the Israelites is built upon the liberation from nature of each man and each woman. The departure is an ontological departure. The point, again, is one of general ontology. I said: God uses nature. God does not express his own nature through nature. Indeed, qua ontologically independent of the natural world, God could not express his nature through nature. But God does express his nature in the world. He expresses it in men and women, who share God's character. But they are, then, not natural. Two archai Thus sayeth the Proverbist (Proverbs 30:18-19): Three things are too wonderful for me; four I do not understand: the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a girl. The distinction between three and four (between, that is, the first three things listed, on the one hand, and the fourth thing, on the other) is the distinction that I have been drawing. It is the distinction between nature, or what is a system, and particulars. In the case of each of the three, we have two items: &lt;thing, location for thing&gt;. In the case of four, we do not have a location, only &lt;thing, thing&gt;. The relations between particulars, the man and the girl (the implicit reference is to Genesis 2, to the man and the woman in the Garden of Eden), are not the systemic relations of Genesis 1. Particulars have a character that resists the scientific attitude, the attitude that comes to expression as wonder about things and their ways. That is what Solomon is saying. Human reality, Jerusalem's concern, is fundamentally different. Each man and each woman is inspired with God's breath of life. Each man and each woman, and nothing else, has the kind of being that God (the monotheistic deity) has: the being of a particular. Men and women, and men and women alone, are particulars. Solomon is agreeing with Athens on the items that make up three. While we may, if we are in the least curious, find the mentioned phenomena strange</page><page sequence="20">22 Mark Glouberman ('wonderful'), reason has the power to explain them. With regard to four, the strangeness is, as it were, terminal. This is the view of Jerusalem. The view is visible in Genesis 1. On the first three days God creates locations, and on days four to six he creates the things that occupy the locations. Obviously, it is not an accident that the locations suit the occupants or that the occupants fit the locations. The point is not that God creates the locations with an eye on what is to take up occupancy, though that is how it can seem on a careless reading. The point, compatible with Darwin, is that the sub-human world is a system, hence a whole whose parts mesh. The items of the pair are, in effect, not independent of one another - as if God could have created on the fourth day fish to fill the skies! In effect, the six days come en bloc. The story of men and women in Genesis 1 is slightly different from the story of the other elements of creation. The text wants it to be clear that like sub-human things men and women are parts of the natural system. Men and women are biological entities like fish and fowl. But the text also wants to acknowledge some non-negotiable difference. In Genesis 2 the difference is made fully apparent. It is however prefigured in Genesis 1. The likeness claim and the dominion-claim we have examined. Also, there is the fact that humankind is brought into being on the afternoon of the sixth day; brought into being, that is, when the sub-human realm is complete. More subtly, there is God's claim in the final verse of the first chapter that the creation, now including humankind, is "very good" (31). The notion that good comes in degrees directly implies that some things are less good than others; and hence opens up the possibility that some things are not good at all. This looks forward to Genesis 2, where we encounter 'bad' for the first time. 'Very good', then, makes very good sense providing that men and women are understood to stand in a skewed relation to the rest. When (in Genesis 2) the first woman is created, she is expressly acknowledged to stand as an equal to the first man, from whom she emerges. She is "bone of [his] bones" and "flesh of [his] flesh" (23). We have two separate entities, one person and another person. We do not have two members of a larger class, humankind. This isn't a differenceless distinction. With respect to humankind, it does not matter which comes first, any more than it matters which car part comes off the assembly line before any others. But the Genesis 2 story starts with a very specific entity, the man. The Bible is primarily the biography of that man and his progeny. That man and his</page><page sequence="21">"And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water" 23 progeny have no status in the species, homo sapiens sapiens, that is the subject matter of Darwin &amp; Co. Early on, I said that the difference between Athens and Jerusalem can be capsuled in terms of what the representative wise men of the cultures say. Here is the capsule. For Thales, water is the principle. For Solomon, God's spirit is the principle. Thales's is the principle, the arche, of generality; Solomon's, the principle, the arche, of particularity. In Genesis 1, at the very start, we have a verse containing both. Here is my translation of the last part of 1:2. And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water. This can be seen as a version of the (onto)logical claim that particularity is governed by a principle that is external to the principle of generality. The latter does not contain the former. God is not the principle of being; God is the principle of particular being. I listed the three works that Solomon is said by the tradition to have written. Each of them, as it happens, is a particularly intense exploration of particularity. The Song of Songs explores love, which is the paradigm particular-requiring emotion (love objects cannot be fungibles, as I shall explain in the coming section). Proverbs offers advice for men and women; advice that has nothing to do with entities whose behaviour can be predicted. Ecclesiastes focuses with an almost unbearable intensity on what makes us non-systematic: our deaths. It touches on the being of entities of this sort who are located within the eternal cycle of nature. Neo-Leibnizeanism By going over several sample cases from the relatively recent philosophical literature, the latest word out of Athens, I will show that Athens needs the Jerusalemite arc he. The movement from abstract discussion to concrete cases will therefore at the same time clarify the significance of the Bible's proprietary ontological principle, the principle of particularity that is reposed, theologically, in the figure of God. The sample cases fall into two groups. In some cases the need for the Jerusalemite principle is at some level felt by the philosopher, so that the account offered is palpably unsatisfactory relative to the philosopher's aims and intentions. In some cases the need for particularity is felt by the reader. That is, the philosophical position comes</page><page sequence="22">24 Mark Glouberman across as signaling some numbness on the propounder's part to the subject matter. (In some cases we get a bit of both.) The ontological position is this: without particulars, all we have are individuals. Individuals are fully accounted for in terms of (a) general, shareable, characteristics or properties, and (b) spatiotemporal positioning. The view that all we have are individuals I call 'Neo-Leibnizeanism'. Let me explain. Leibniz advanced a principle known as the Identity of Indiscernibles (PII). If 01 and 02 have all the same properties, if, that is, (F) (F01 &lt;-» F02), then 01 = 02. Now it is certainly not correct to say that two different things cannot have the same suite of characteristics. As unlikely as it is that such a pair can be found in the real world, the idea of two (or more) different things being the same solo numero is perfectly intelligible. On this ground, PII is usually rejected as false. (Leibniz is not a fool. His metaphysical position is that space and time are not basic determinations. Those who agree that PII is 'certainly not correct' should try to reformulate it while explicitly abjuring locational characteristics.) But there is a weaker notion that can capture the essence (as I see the essence) of PII. This is (as I call it) the Principle of Interchangeability of Functional Identicals (PIFI). If two things are indistinguishable solo numero, then the replacement of one by the other makes no difference whatever. This weaker position is one to which P. F. Strawson is committed. If two things differ only in spatial location and/or temporal positioning; if they are two peas in a pod, then the substitution of one for the other would make no (discernible) difference. A person unaware of the substitution would not, that epistemic lacuna apart, be in any different position than one who knows of it. This, nearly enough, is tantamount to PII. If the property ascriptions true of object 01 are the same as the property ascriptions true of 02, then it makes no difference which of Ol and 02 one has. That is why we do not care which piece of currency the ATM machine at the bank spits out, or which car part is supplied from the supplier. Just imagine a person who does care about which $10 bill he or she is given. To make sense of this, assuming that we are not speaking of lunatics, the circumstances have to be very special indeed. (The reader will now understand why love does not apply to fungibles, which is not to say that love is constant.) So long as the relevant characteristics are had, any one that has them will do fine. In effect: PIFI.</page><page sequence="23">"And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water" 25 Strawson presents himself in the book Individuals (Strawson 1959) as a critic of Leibniz. Like Kant, Strawson rejects PII. But at a deeper level Strawson and Leibniz are indistinguishable. For Strawson cannot avoid PIFI. (Kant, by contrast, can. He can, as he has an ontology that is much fuller than Strawson's, an ontology that Strawson explicitly guts in his interpretation of Kant's doctrine of transcendental idealism in The Bounds of Sense (Strawson 1966). To deny that Kant is a philosopher would be scandalous. Nonetheless, Kant is in many ways a biblical-type thinker. I will mention Kant again below. In each of the contexts of mention, Kant stands in an uneasy relation to mainstream philosophy. And in each context the difference concerns particularity.) Consider Strawson's account in Individuals of persons. The difference between persons and (other) material objects is that (what Strawson dubs) P-predicates apply to the former but not to the latter. But if the category of persons is distinguished only by virtue of sustaining certain ascriptions, then persons too are fungibles. That is, while Strawson has a distinction between persons and (other) material objects, he lacks a basis for denying of persons the fungibility that his account accords to (other) material objects. The claim that persons are fungibles is something that we would all agree is simply false. If an ontological analysis cannot handle this agreement, then that analysis should at minimum be questioned. The idea of functional indistinguishability only applies in the arena of persons if we are thinking of persons as function fillers in the usual sense: clerks, mechanics, bank managers, bellhops, etc. But if we are thinking of the men and women who fulfill the functions, of Carl the clerk, Mona the mechanic, etc., it is not true. (Observe that it would be felt to be a mistake to take 'husband' or 'wife' as entirely functional terms. When Eve introduces Adam as her husband, this effectively means: 'the particular man with whom I make up a married couple'.) Strawson, who one feels wants to take a biblical-type position, does not have the metaphysical resources to capture the particularity of persons. He has only general predications (understood along Frege's lines as functions!) and spatiotemporal position. The category of particular is either absent from his resources, or else he believes (mistakenly) that it is reducible to resources that he does have. What Strawson writes could be taken as an epitome of the constraining effects of the Athenian mindset on thinkers whose tendencies are non</page><page sequence="24">26 Mark Glouberman Thalean but who operate in philosophy. One gets to (and hence understands) the things that have the properties only through the properties; only from the outside. This, we shall see when we come presently to an issue of philosophical logic between Strawson and W. V. Quine, makes it impossible for Strawson to say what he wants to say; or, if he manages somehow to say it, makes it impossible for him to rationalize the saying. Persons are particulars. As far as I can tell, persons are the only particulars in the creation. That, certainly, is the Bible's view, since only the man created in Genesis 2, and through him other men and women, are inspired with God's (sc., the principle of particularity's) kind of existence: particular existence. To be sure, we treat many other things as particulars. But this, as in the case of pets, is sentimentality of one stripe or other. A neighbor of mine is onto her fourth dog (named) Brownie. Not a very sentimental person, this neighbor. Henry IV does not stand to the first English king who bore the name 'Henry' as Brownie IV does to Brownie I. Strawson's predicative approach to distinction operates on the level of types, and cannot get beneath that level. It gives us classes, not particulars. That is, any non-general thing is always picked out from a class of things that are indistinguishable save solo numero. Strawson's word for non-general thing is 'individual'. But the principle of space and time is only a principle of localization or referentiality. It is not a principle of particularity.3 To cater for particularity one must, it appears, start, as the Bible does in Genesis 2, with a particular: the man. And to start with the particular is to accept a principle that is alien to Athens. In Genesis 2, the lump of clay, which is certainly only an individual (God could have started with any quantity of the stuff), is made a person by receiving God's breath of life. As this again indicates, monotheism, though enunciated as the theological position that there is only one deity, is at base the view that men and women are particulars. The deity is not just a god who is unchallenged. The deity is a particular having the character of a person. (If Zeus were the only Olympian, Olympian religion would not be monotheistic.) From a reflective and 3 Observe that a general thing can be localized: 'Red[ness] is found here'. Strawson explores this idea by advancing the notion of 'feature-placing'; see "Particular and General" (Strawson 1971:21^10). That he would explore it with the aim of analysing our ordinary referential claims (that is what he claims to be doing) proves that he lacks a proper sense of the particular. At any rate, he is prepared to negotiate with respect to the idea.</page><page sequence="25">"And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water" 27 non-religious viewpoint, monotheism is then the anti-philosophical view that persons are particulars. Those who, like Philo of Alexandria, identify the biblical God with the Platonic principle of being are confusing the Acropolis with Sinai, the Garden of Academus with the Garden of Eden. The absence of the category of the particular from Strawson's metaphysical resources has several other reflections in his wider oeuvre, resulting in an overall position that suffers from a kind of schizophrenia. In the paper "Freedom and Resentment," his foray into moral philosophy, Strawson (1974, 1-25) ties the idea of a moral agent to the appropriateness of certain attitudes. One can't resent or feel hard done by with regard to an avalanche for causing death and destruction. But one can resent a person who causes one harm. An attitude like resentment makes sense only for a person. In respect of non-persons, one's attitudes are objective, not reactive. (Observe that this is exactly Solomon's distinction between three and four.) But why? People are different from avalanches. But it must be that to sustain the different attitude people are more different from avalanches than avalanches are different from other natural things. Otherwise, it could have been said in exactly the same tone of voice that avalanches are different from people. How, then, are people more different? They are more different because each person is a particular, not just an individual. Since all that Strawson relevantly has, metaphysically, are individuals, he is incapable of saying this. Restricted as he is to Athenian resources, Strawson proceeds instead to do the best he can by his intuition. He closely examines our practices and indicates, essentially, how tight (and wide) a system they comprise. In effect, he offers us a system that is as rich as the scientific system, hence a system rich enough to make its proponents confident enough to stand up to the reductionists and eliminationists from the scientific side. About the key item, the ontological specialness of the men and women who engage in these practices, he says nothing. Strawson wants to distinguish people from (mere) individuals. Though he does make a distinction, what his manner of distinction ('P-predicates apply solely to the former') gives us is too weak. The resulting distinction is no different in character than the distinction between, say, material objects and numbers ('Locational predicates apply to material things, not to numbers'). It is, that is, a distinction between two classes or types of individuals. One keenly feels, then, the justice of Judah Halevy's warning against the wisdom</page><page sequence="26">28 Mark Glouberman of the Greeks "which has only flowers and produces no fruit." Individuals, in effect, but no particulars. The same metaphysical lack comes out in Strawson's informal logic. Back in the sixties, Strawson vigorously opposed Quine on the elimination of (singular) subject terms. As part of the regimentation along logical lines of everyday language, Quine (the key text here is Quine 1960) was willing and eager to recast a proper name like 'Socrates' as a predicate: 'Socratizes'. This is the predicate that applies exclusively to the person we know by the name. The recasting is fine for Quine, whose commitments are fully to science, and whose concerns are with the internal structure of logic and hence with systemic features such as economy and elegance. Quine is a full blown modern Thalean. Philosophy for him, as he frequently states, is a handmaiden to science.4 But it is not fine for Strawson. Lacking the idea of particularity, Strawson has however no way to back up his disapproval of Quine's position. Students at the time (of which I was one) would have to be excused for having scratched their heads at the amount of energy that Strawson devoted to opposing Quine. It really was not at all clear. Diagnostically speaking, this, then, is a highly revealing dispute. Quine's uniquely applying predicate (the class of objects that fall under it has only one member) is exactly tailored to his metaphysical position. The only difference among objects all of which are fungibles is in the size of the class to which they belong. So if 'Socratize' has only one instance, what need of the proper name? It may seem heartless for Quine to suck the particularity out of his loved ones, and supply them only with a surrogate sort of particularity: unique membership in a class. If however we are dealing with objects that are fungibles (any number can in principle satisfy the same predicates), then the feeling of heartlessness is (merely) sentimental. When we grow up logically, we should put away childish thinking. So why not eliminate childish names in favour of adult bound variables of quantification? As I mentioned, Strawson resisted the move. But unless particulars and individuals are distinguished, the opposition is impossible to understand save as some kind of misplaced allegiance to vulgar patterns of speech. And when the opposition is properly understood, we appreciate that the issue is 4 Here is a well-known claim of Quine's (1960, 3): "Science is just self-conscious common sense." The dogmatism is patent. Solomon is self-conscious. He is anti scientific.</page><page sequence="27">"And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water" 29 not a logical one. (Just ask a monotheist whether the theological position is that only one deity Godizes!) When the principle of particularity is explicitly absent (as it is in much philosophy) this can result in the defence of positions that we feel in our bones to be mistaken. A position in ethics like Utilitarianism recommends maximizing some quality such as happiness or pleasure. This is like an economist's recommending maximizing wealth in a society without caring that 5% of the populace has 90% of it. The simple point for here is that in the absence of particulars the attempt to introduce distributive principles (an attempt that many utilitarians, whose bones feel what our bones feel) makes no sense. Utilitarianism is an ecological-type view. It belongs to the conceptual field of Genesis 1. Morality, an egological-type view, requires the resources of Genesis 2. Kant, we know, gives us the latter; but to give it to us he has to travel into the noumenal realm to find something more than (in effect) individuals. At least Kant feels that such obscurities are essential; so much so that their obscurity doesn't deter him from transcending the bounds of sense. One philosopher has no qualms about any of this. Plato is the arch system thinker. In taking such a line he is entirely consistent with the Thalean basis of philosophical thinking, though his (so to speak) ecology is rational rather than natural. Readers of the Republic (and not just beginning readers) have a very hard time dealing with Plato's arguments. The arguments initially come across like parodies; the dialogue as a whole, as a Hellenic 1984, a satire on an unpalatable way of arranging politics. The appearance, though misleading, since Plato is quite serious, has an easy explanation. Plato utterly rejects the principle of particularity. Thus, for Plato, justice is defined not (as it would be for us) as having one's own, but as doing one's own. A just society is a society in which each man and each woman fulfills the (social) function that is his or hers. Justice requires that the cobbler cobble, that the joiner join, that the ruler rule, and so forth. This strikes us as virtually incomprehensible. And in our (biblical) terms, it is incomprehensible, for 'one's own' in Plato's 'doing one's own' means 'what one does for the whole and in the frame of the whole'. For the whole, the fly is caught and eaten by the spider. We employ the phrase 'doing your own thing'. The phrase means 'doing what you choose to do'. Here is a telling passage from the Republic (I quote from Plato 1992). Plato is discussing the life of a typical denizen of his ideal city, a carpenter.</page><page sequence="28">30 Mark Glouberman When a carpenter is ill, he asks his doctor to give him an emetic or a purge to expel the trouble, or to rid him of it by cautery or the knife. But if he is advised to take a long course of treatment, to keep his head wrapped up, and all that sort of thing, he soon replies that he has not time to be ill and it is not worth his while to live in that way, thinking of nothing but his illness and neglecting his proper work. And so he bids good-bye to that kind of doctor and goes back to his ordinary way of life. Then he either regains his health and lives to go about his proper business, or, if his body is not equal to the strain, gets rid of all his troubles by dying. (406d^K)7a) If we substitute a car part such as a tire, uncontroversially a fungible, for the carpenter, what is written makes sense. Either the tire can be repaired, or else it goes on the scrap heap. But when it comes to particulars, Plato's claim sounds like Stalin, or Hitler: if the sick person cannot be healed, then he or she should be liquidated - reunited with Thales's water. Plato does not however accept particulars. His ontological analysis involves (the system of) Forms and reflections of Forms in space and time ('the Receptacle'). It involves no more. Within Plato's ontological framework (to take another to-us-unseemly feature of the Republic) the disruption of the family, sc., the treatment of 'husband' and 'wife' as purely functional terms, makes sense. Our attitudes Plato would dismiss as sentimental, like the attitude of a bald tire that resisted removal from the rim. Earlier I approvingly quoted Augustine. At one point Augustine opined that Plato might have "learnt [from Jeremiah] by word of mouth ... the contents of the Scriptures" (Augustine 1984, 314). About his linkage of the philosopher and the Bible my judgment is less favourable. Perhaps Augustine has Christian Holy Writ in mind. But, of course, to the Gospels neither the prophet nor the philosopher could have had access. Aristotle is frequently raked over the coals for having defended slavery. In the frame of a way of thinking that has no non-fungibles, slavery can easily seem less abhorrent than it does to us. I need hardly remind readers that a constant motif in the Bible is the need constantly to remind ourselves of the slavery in Egypt. So, as I said at the outset, the absence of the Jerusalemite principle has effects in logic, in ethics, in morals, in politics. And my small set of examples opens the floodgates into action theory, the area of mind, etc. I will end by keeping my word about the Ten Commandments. Both enunciations of the Commandments begin with "I am the Lord your God." In his recent bestseller god is not Great, Christopher Hitchens (2007, 99)</page><page sequence="29">"And the spirit of God hovered on the face of the water " 31 dismisses the declaration as "throat-clearing," and proceeds to the oft-heard claim that God is a bully, threatening punishment for non-compliance. But all of this is dreadfully wrong headed. God is the principle of particularity. Without such a principle, moral behaviour does not make proper sense. I already said that pagan systems, systems that the Bible is trying to supersede, can endorse principles of moral-type behaviour: truth-telling, marital fidelity, parental respect, etc. For such systems, such principles are, however, like rules of the road. They enable men and women to get along without too much friction. Though not a nugatory basis for behaving morally, that is not a moral basis for behaving.
