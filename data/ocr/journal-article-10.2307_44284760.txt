<plain_text><page sequence="1">Unamuno 's En torno al casticismo as Nation-Making Ibón Izurieta University of Colorado at Denver The invention of Spain as an imaginary community1 owes much to Miguel de Unamuno's vision. Unamuno's life-time project of regenerating Spain started with En torno al casticismo , a histori- cal analysis that would identify the problems of the past and point the direction towards a better future. Unamuno's analysis of the past and the future followed the model set by liberal historiography through capturing the essence of the Spanish soul in the concept of casticismo and presenting nimbo (the organicist ideal of unity)2 as the ideal for the future. In casticismo , Unamuno included lib- eral metanarratives such as the legendary central role of Castile in the construction of Spain as a nation and the characteristic recal- citrant Castilian soul divided into extremes. Casticismo for Unamuno also included the representation of the soul of Spain in a literary history based on the canon, an inheritance from Menendez Pidal and other liberal intellectuals.3 As an improvement on the negative aspects of casticismo , En torno al casticismo presents a blueprint for national regeneration through the idealized, Roman- tic concepts of nimbo , and intrahistoria. These concepts are Unamuno's building-blocks of a liberal model of nation-making which was winning wars against the increasingly weaker traditional, pre-capitalist society. The analysis of the present study proposes a deconstruction of liberal concepts such as a nation, a national soul, and a national literature based on a critical analysis that reveals those concepts as abstract theorizations at the service of a capital- ist economic system struggling for domination. 91</page><page sequence="2">92 Hispanic Journal En torno al casticismo is a collection of five essays published as a book. Despite each of the essays first being published sepa- rately in 1895, En torno al casticismo was published as a collection in 1902. The meaning of the central concept of the essays is diffi- cult to translate but in the 1991 edition, Gonzalez Egido 's intro- duction offers one possibility: Este libro trata de España, de su conformación histórica y de los elementos fundamentales de su caracterización, lo que con más transparencia racional [...] expresaba el título de la traducción francesa de Marcel Bataillon, L'essence de l'Espagne (París, Plon, 1923), que serviría también para la traducción italiana L'esenza della Spagna (Milán, Antonioli, 1945) de Carlo Bo (9). Casticismo therefore could be translated into English as the "essence of Spain,* to follow a literal translation of the French and Italian titles, although I would argue that it would be more accu- rate to translate the title as the "essence of Spanish identity" or the "essence of Spanishness." En torno al casticismo was written during the aftermath of the last Guerra Carlista ("Carlist Wars") in which a liberal model of nation building was becoming dominant through the military vic- tories of the liberals over the traditionalists or so-called Carlists.4 The Carlists favored an absolutist monarchy, Catholic and tradi- tionalist. The wars over Spain's future had clear implications about the type of economic system that would exist: either capitalism or a more traditional economy typical of the absolutist monarchies of the seventeenth century in Europe (which existed well into the nine- teenth century in certain parts of Spain). Simultaneously, Spain lost its last colonies as a result of its defeat in the Spanish-Ameri- can War forcing Spain to finally accept that it was no longer the most powerful country in the world. This historical event defined the group of writers known as "the Generation of 98" to which Unamuno belonged. As a response to Spain's decline, which reached its lowest level after the Spanish-American War, the writers of the "Generation of 98" presented different plans for the regeneration of Spain. En torno al casticismo is one such book which analyzed the problems of the past and suggested ways to improve the future. Unamuno fully supported a Spain that would defeat Carlism, adopt liberalism and embrace capitalism as the hope for a modern na- tion. Liberal historiography was simply an intellectual tool used to</page><page sequence="3">Ibón Izurieta 93 further this cause. It used organicism and essentialist concepts of nation, tradition and histoiy to buttress the process that would strengthen the hold of capitalism and make the liberal model of nation hegemonic. According to the values that liberal political philosophy espoused, Spain was a backward country that needed modernization. The first essay of En torno al casticismo : " La tradición eterna " discusses tradition and its variations in meaning such as a na- tional definition versus a more universal sense of tradition as an essential human element. The second essay is: "La casta histórica de Castilla ." The historical role of Castile in the construction of the modern nation of Spain is the focus of this essay. Unamuno re- examined Castile's leadership role as the legendary seed of modern Spain. Essays three and four analyze Spain's literary history: "El espíritu castellano" and "De mística y humanismo . " Finally, the fifth essay "Sobre el marasmo actual de España as a conclusion, is a general discussion of all of Unamuno's previous topics. History, of course, is central to En torno al casticismo and to any analysis of the "essence of Spanishness." Spanish identity, as Unamuno presents it, is based on identifying the common charac- teristics of a people, recognizing how a common geography has aided in the creation of common patterns of behavior and even on creating common personality traits. Part of that essence of Span- ish identity is a common culture that is recognized as possessing a shared history and a tradition of similar practices that have also existed through time, throughout history. Together these strands constitute a community that recognizes itself as a nation. All of these components, however, are relative, and the recog- nition of the conditional nature of all those principles is unfortu- nately absent in Unamuno's rather ambitious attempt at defining "the essence of Spanish identity." Any statement regarding the constitution of nations should be treated with great skepticism because the veiy concept of nation is itself an abstraction - a theoiy and not a tangible object. The question then arises, was Unamuno's attempt at regenerating Spain too dogmatic? Did he inherit his unquestioned version of Spain's future from Spanish liberal histo- riography? I argue, "yes" on both counts. Unamuno's study of a common Spanish tradition begins with the concepts of casticismo and intrahistoria. Intrahistoria is intro- duced in his first essay "La tradición eterna " as: "el sedimento de las verdades eternas de la eterna esencia" (48-9). Intrahistoria there- fore is the almost physical body that derives its materialness from</page><page sequence="4">94 Hispanic Journal understanding eternal truths as an eternal essence. It is defined in material words such as "sediment" and "essence" which create a physical presence for spiritual or ethereal concepts. In the essay, Unamuno employs organic and anthropomorphic metaphors when discussing the historic present which, for him, contains intrahistoria: "Esta es la manera de concebirla en vivo, como la sustancia de la historia, como su sedimento, como la revelación de lo intrahistórico, de lo inconsciente en la historia" (49). Intrahistoria for Unamuno is then almost a material body of tradition, the sediment of human customs that persist unconsciously throughout history as a pseudo- biological organism. It is clearly an essentialist understanding of a spiritual or ethereal concept, an organic version of an abstraction. Current literary theory, though, would qualify that the concept of tradition actually changes according to each different historical moment.5 For instance, the meaning of a summer break from school began as a need to accommodate harvesting and the necessity for children to help their parents. Nowadays, it has completely changed to "vacation." Summer break is a tradition that we identify as the same event throughout history even though its functions and mean- ings have changed throughout time. Other critics, however, allow for a more practical definition of nation-building which is less poetic than Unamuno's. Benedict Anderson in his Imagined Communities carries out a very persua- sive historical study of the creation of nations and how the concept of "nation" in fact is directly related to the invention of the printing press, the rise of the bourgeoisie, the use of the vernacular as le- gitimate literary language in printed periodicals, and the generali- zation of education (particularly the spread of literacy among the bourgeoisie). Not only Anderson but also Inman Fox connects the emergence of the concept of nation, the increasing power of the bourgeoisie and liberal ideology in the particular context of Span- ish liberal historiography. Inman Fox studies the historical pro- cess that produced a written record of events that were identified as common Spanish traditions. In Inman Fox's study of the origins and philosophy of Spanish liberal historiography, he establishes a link between the German philosophers Herder and the Schlegel brothers and the conservative Spanish Romantics between 1820 and 1830 who supported the existence of a "national soul" and the notion that literature is an expression of "national beliefs, feelings and values." The proposal of a "national soul" is personifying a very abstract and theoretical term. I see the same pattern in as- signing beliefs, feelings and values to a nation and in describing a</page><page sequence="5">Ibón Izurieta 95 national literature as an expression of those sentiments. The logic of assigning to abstract concepts anthropomorphic properties is to relate new ideas to human experience. Unamuno inherits the same methodology of visualizing ethereal concepts like nation /national literature and presenting them to his readers following the organi- cist model of the Romantics that was adopted by the liberal histo- riography in Spain. The alternative to this view is Anderson's men- tioned historical analysis -a much more practical process than the theatrical and poetic model of the Romantics and Unamuno. Unamuno's interest in personifying abstract concepts in or- der to make them more understandable is not merely an intellec- tual strategy for better comprehension but part of a political effort to shape societies according to a political philosophy. Fox says that: "La sensibilidad romántica hacia la historia fue influida y realzada por la perspectiva de la nueva realidad socio-política traída por el liberalismo" (36) and part of that new socio-political reality of the increasing influence of liberalism was: "las dimensiones nacionalistas de la historiografía española de la segunda mitad del siglo XIX" (36). In other words, Unamuno 's study of Spain's past and his road-map for a better future for the nation should not be taken as scientific conclusions but rather as evaluations that be- long to a political perspective which colors his observations. One of the central concerns of the Generation of 98 when recommending how to re-make a nation was to solve perceived prob- lems that hindered the successful development of Spain's past. A significant perceived problem was the incomplete nature of the pro- cess of unification of the Nation-State (Fox, 40). In this vain, Span- ish liberal historiography praises the role of the Reyes Católicos in moving towards unification as a catholic country after the expul- sion of the Moors and the Jews. Despite the creation of the Inqui- sition, the main error committed by the Reyes Católicos according to liberal historiography is that they never fully accomplished the task of unifying the country and instead left Spain mired in the chaos of conflicting laws (Fox, 42). Ortega y Gasset discusses this problem in his essay "La España invertebrada ." Unamuno also re- fers to it in En torno al casticismo (66). Unamuno presents Rousseau's theory of the social pact, but admits: aSe podrá decir que hay verdadera patria española cuando sea libertad en nosotros la necesidad de ser españoles [...] Hasta llegar a este término de libertad del que aún, no valen ilusiones, estamos lejos, la historia va haciendo a los pueblos" (64). Unamuno recognizes that the pro- cess of unification of Spain is incomplete again later in that essay</page><page sequence="6">96 Hispanic Journal and in doing so, highlights the importance that this factor held in the minds of the writers of the Generation of 98. Another impediment toward unification, besides the unsuc- cessful efforts of the Reyes Católicos, was the historical role of Castile. Fox identifies this version of histoiy as "castellanofilia" (45 and passim). Unamuno expresses it as follows: "Castilla es la verdadera foijadora de la unidad y la monarquía españolas* (66). The role of Castile, although viewed as positive, was not always reasonable according to present views of appropriate worldly, dip- lomatic conduct among nations or regions. The positive evaluation of a rather violent past comes from a possible Nieztschean under- standing of the role of the "Übermensch" as a beneficial influence (La Rubia Prado, 101). In any case, Unamuno presents it as fol- lows: ...Castilla paralizó los centros reguladores de los demás pueblos españoles, inhibióles la conciencia histórica en gran parte, les echó en ella su idea, la idea del unitarismo conquistador, de la catolización del mundo, y esta idea se desarrolló y siguió su trayectoria castellanizándose. Y de los demás pueblos españoles brotaron espíritus hondamente castellanos, castizamente castellanos, de entre los cuales citaré como ejemplo a Iñigo de Loyola, un vasco. (69) Other examples of the violent leadership carried out by Castile are: "[Castilla] se echó a salvar almas por esos mundos de Dios, y a saquear América para los flamencos" (69). Another description of the "Castilian spirif is described as: "que produjo tantos misioneros de la palabra y la espada" (70). Castile's bloody leadership, how- ever, as already mentioned, is not seen in a negative light at all by Unamuno: Cuando lo que hacía falta era una fuerte unidad central, tenía que predominar el más unitario; cuando se necesitaba una vigorosa acción hacia el exterior, el de instinto más conquistador e imperativo. Castilla, en su exclusivismo, era menos exclusiva que los pueblos que, encerrados en sí se dedicaban a su fomento interior. (68) Castile's inclination towards imposing its leadership willingly or unwillingly was seen by Unamuno as the real leadership of a kingdom that was sorely needed in a chaotic conglomeration of passive and inward looking kingdoms. Castile's "vision" for a uni-</page><page sequence="7">Ibón Izurieta 97 tary existence of Spain, might be seen as a power-hungry coloniz- ing military power happy to occupy territory that did not belong to her, but Unamuno did not see it in that manner. Fox's historical analysis identifies Castile's foundational role in creating Spain as a liberal metanarrative and links it to Unamuno (Fox, 45, 52). Another aspect of "Spanishness" to Unamuno is the charac- ter of the Castilian people. Unamuno speaks of a representative Castilian peasant (el labriego) who personifies intrahistoria (tradi- tion) by appearing as an amalgam of extremes. Unamuno is both condescending to and simultaneously in a melancholic sense, en- deared by an attachment to the peasant that might be comparable to the one that exists between an owner and a pet. The following passage appears in "La casta histórica de Castilla" in En torno al casticismo : Diríase que es en él largo lo que llaman los psicofisiólogos el tiempo de reacción, que necesita de bastante rato para darse cuenta de una impresión o una idea, y que una vez que la agarra no la suelta a primeras, no la suelta mientras otra no la empuje y expulse. Así es que sus impresiones parece son lentas y tenaces, faltándoles el nimbo que las circunda y une como materia conjuntiva [...] Estos hombres tienen un alma viva y en ella el alma de sus antepasados, adormecida tal vez [...] pero viva siempre. (79, 81) For Unamuno the dissociative and polarizing tendency of casticismo's contraries is the root of Spain's national malaise. His healing alternative is nimbo . In the example of the peasant we have a superficial manifestation of dissociation but an internal soul of unity and intrahistoria . The dissociative tendencies are also recognized in Nature, in the climate of Castile: nueve meses de invierno y tres de infierno [...] En este clima extremado por ambos extremos, donde tan violentamente se pasa del calor al frío y de la sequía al aguaducho ha inventado el hombre en la capa, que le aisla del ambiente, una atmósfera personal, regularmente constante en medio de las oscilaciones exteriores. (74) Despite the extremes of the weather and the apparent dissociative personality of the people of Castile, Unamuno sees in them a deep treasure of unity or nimbo . Unamuno presents his theory: among</page><page sequence="8">98 Hispanic Journal differences and extremes one should always look for the profound and most important latent unity. In Unamuno's words: El hombre, de lo que se da cuenta es del contraste [...] pero tal distinción no podría darse sin una analogía profunda sobre que reposara; la diferencia sólo se reconoce sobre un fondo de semejanza. En la sucesión de impresiones discretas hay un fondo de continuidad, un nimbo que envuelve a lo precedente con lo subsiguiente. (82) In the introduction, I defined nimbo as an organicist ideal of unity. When in the third essay, uEl espíritu castellano," Unamuno is criti- cizing Calderóni dissociative casticismo , he uses both terms re- lated to each other ("organic nimbo") when discussing the ideal and positive alternative to Calderoni extremes: "Calderón se esforzaba por revestir huesos de carne y sacaba momias, mientras que en el proceso vivo brota el organismo todo de un óvulo fecundado, surge del protoplasma del nimbo orgánico dibujándose un dentro y un fuera , un endodermo y un ectodermo." ( En torno al casticismo , 93) Once again, Unamuno's perceptions as to whether Castilian people exhibit extreme division in their conduct and whether or not Castilian weather is so extreme, should be taken as personal ob- servations. What is most important is his political philosophy. En torno al casticismo cannot be properly read if we are not willing to deconstruct his liberal ideology. Unamuno, above all, tries to find unity in chaos: Spain's past, in particular: Spain's defeat in the Spanish-American War, Spain's fratricidal wars in the Carlist Wars, Spain's perceived dissociative soul, Spain's atrophied and mummi- fied literature, etc. I contend that Nimbo and Intrahistoria are not but a desire to escape the fragmented reality in which he lives. To establish essentialist categories like "the sediment of the tradition of the peoples" as intrahistoria and the organic unity of nimbo as the pattern for a new future, is simply an intellectual and futile effort at adding flesh to dead bones (to use his own image when describing Calderon 's plays) or at least adding flesh to ethereal con- cepts that escape our comprehension unless we create them in our own image. The theoretical leap that I propose links liberal political phi- losophy and liberal economic theoiy with capitalism as the driving material force of the former fields of thought. Unamuno's ideology</page><page sequence="9">Ibón Izurieta 99 as a liberal thinker was directly connected to the imposition of capi- talism as the hegemonic economic system in Spain through the influence of En torno al casticismo . All of the associated concepts and intellectual fields and pursuits such as liberal historiography and its fundamental organicist values of the soul of nations and the representation of a nation's spirit in Literature are ideological constructs with capitalism being its driving force.6 An alternative view to the humanist/ idealist view of liberalism would state that the process of transition between the European economies of the XVII century and the economies of the XIX (pre-capitalism to capi- talism) created the need for centralized markets that would cen- tralize currency, centralize measuring and weighing scales and phase out local, regional and city duties for commerce. The eco- nomic need for larger, homogenized markets created nations, not pseudo-organic national souls represented in national literatures. In other words, the existence of a "national character" is fictitious and only an imagined consequence (constructed by liberalism) of a very material need for the expansion of capitalism. Unamuno, in fact, was not altogether unaware of the role of the economy on all the problems that Spain was experiencing at the end of the XIX century: Vivimos en un país pobre, y donde no hay harina todo es mohína. La pobreza económica explica nuestra anemia mental; las fuerzas más frescas y juveniles se agotan en establecerse , en la lucha por el destino. Pocas verdades más hondas que la de que en la jerarquía de los fenómenos sociales los económicos son los primeros principios, los elementos. (156) Indeed Unamuno recognizes the role that commerce through Castile had in centralizing trade routes and unifying the several regions of Spain by the criss-cross of communications and trade through the center, Castile: En España llevó a cabo la unificación Castilla, que ocupa el centro de la Península, la región en que se cruzaban las comunicaciones de sus distintos pueblos, centro de más valor que ahora entonces, que en la crisis de la pubertad nacional las funciones de nutrición predominaban [...] Castilla era un emporio del comercio español de granos y verdadero centro natural (italics in the original) de España. (68)</page><page sequence="10">100 Hispanic Journal The impetus for the creation of a centralized Spain with Castile in the center had much to do with the unification of the markets and the circulation of trade from the north to the center. This is indeed the theory that a Marxist critic, Nicos Poulantzas (95), fa- vors regarding the historical process that created nations. It is not so much an essentialized form of a national soul but the consolida- tion of markets in the process of the imposition of capitalism. In conclusion, En torno al casticismo is a well-meaning at- tempt at offering a hopeful alternative to the crisis that Spain was going through in the second half of the XIX century. Notwith- standing its good intentions, I propose the deconstruction of con- cepts such as casticismo, intrahistoria and nimbo as foundations of the liberal ideology that Unamuno inherited from Spain's liberal intelligentsia. Casticismo is a reconstruction of history based on imagined and ideological concepts that were foundational build- ing-blocks of liberal historiography. Some of those concepts are: nation; a linear, chronological, unitary concept of history; organi- cist versions of terms such as soul and character applied to imag- ined communities as the mirror concepts applied to individuals (another ideological concept); and liberal/ humanist concepts of Lit- erature related to Romantic notions of art and aesthetics. Unamuno's casticismo as a historical reconstruction of the divisive character of the Spanish population is a highly personal view of very diverse phenomena. Unamuno's view of Castile's historical role is also colored by liberal historiography and very pro-Castile, as Fox's adjective of castellanófilo indicates. Unamuno's hurt at seeing a fragmented and fractured reality (civil wars in Spain: the Carlist Wars, the defeat of the Spanish- American War, the per- ceived backwardness of the country, the loss of the colonies, the nostalgic feeling for a strong Spain as it existed in the XV centuiy and others circumstances that frustrated Unamuno's hope for a better Spain) created the need to find an alternative. Related to the perceived problems of the above factors in the creation of Spain as a nation, intrahistoria and nimbo could be theorized as being the products of Unamuno's frustrated desire for a better future for Spain.7 Nimbo is itself related to the increasing importance of capi- talism through its organicism and as a central concept of Romantic aestheticism.8 En torno al casticismo embodies each of the above mentioned strands that makes the combination of cultural and economic changes that took place in the XIX centuiy in Spain such a decisive and long enduring transformation and a consequence of the expansion of capitalism.</page><page sequence="11">Ibón Izurieta 101 notes 1 1 am using Inman Fox's and Benedict Anderson's concepts 2 See La Rubia Prado, 15 and Derek Flitter, passim. 3 See Inman Fox, 97-109. 4 The Carlist side took its name from Carlos, Ferdinand VII's brother who was a pretender to the Spanish throne disputing his brother's designation of his daughter Isabel as the queen of Spain despite a law that prohibited women from inheriting the throne ("La ley Sálica*). 5 Belsey, Jameson also post-structuralist thinkers like Foucault and others. 6 See Jameson and his The Political Unconscious. Obviously the link between liberal historiography and capitalism needn't be a conscious fact in anyone's mental awareness as Jameson's title points to. Among the ideological concepts related to the imposition of capitalism as a hegemonic economic system we need to include the concepts: "progress" (See Larrain), the organicist view of the universe as a defining understanding of Romantic philosophy and literaiy criticism (see Eagleton), Romantic aesthetics (see Jameson, Eagleton), the novel as a literaiy genre and obviously the conversion of the book to an article of mass reproduction (see Anderson) among other concepts. 7 See the role that according to Jameson desire plays in the psycho- biographic formation of the bourgeois subject in capitalism (The Political Unconscious , 66). 8 See Eagleton, 103.
