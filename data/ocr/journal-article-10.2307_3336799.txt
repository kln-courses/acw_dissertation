<plain_text><page sequence="1">Woodcarving of the Limba of Sierra Leone S W.A. HART n 1971 the Sierra Leonean artist Olayinka Burney-Nicol gave a public lecture at Fourah Bay College in the Uni- versity of Sierra Leone on the subject of traditional art in Africa. In the course of her talk she drew a contrast between an "art of the forest," which for her was characterized by soft, rounded forms, highly polished surfaces, and minutely executed detail, and an "art of the open savanna or grasslands," which she spoke of as angular and abstract, de- pending for its effect on bold contrasts and strong, simple lines. To illustrate the ABOVE. 1. FACE MASK, KUTHOMBO (?), NORTHERN SIERRA LEONE. 2. LIMBA FIGURE (DETAIL), NORTHERN SIERRA LEONE. 74cm. PRIVATE COLLECTION. 44</page><page sequence="2">LEFT: 3.

"forest" style she used a number of fig- ures and masks from her own collection of Mende art.' The "grasslands" style was exemplified by a mask from north- ern Sierra Leone (Fig. 1). Olayinka selected the pieces, no doubt, because they were conveniently to hand; but I thought then and have often thought since that Sierra Leone, by its geography as much as by its art, is particularly well suited to illustrate the kinds of contrasts she had in mind. A glance at a map of the present-day vegetation of Sierra Leone bears this out. An area of grasslands, woodland savanna, and derived savanna stretches across the northern region from Kambia in the west to just north of Kailahun in the east, with a dip southward in the center of the country that takes in Taiama. This coincides with areas pre- dominantly inhabited by the northern Temne, Limba, Loko, and Kuranko peoples. And while tropical rain forest is now largely confined to a few pockets in the south and east toward the Liberian border, it is clear that in the nineteenth century and earlier the area of dense forest was far more extensive, stretching from Liberia across the whole of south- ern Sierra Leone with the exception of the coastal strip. A combination of com- mercial logging by Europeans and more intensive subsistence farming by the in- digenous population has reduced this forest to a fraction of its former extent. Sierra Leone is best known in African art circles for the work of its "forest" peoples - the Mende, Vai, and Bullom who inhabit the coastal strip and inland areas in the south and southeast where tropical rain forest once flourished. What is usually thought of as the Mende style is in fact a southern regional style shared by a number of different ethnic groups of which the Mende are by far the largest and most influential. Anyone who was lucky enough to have seen the "Art of the Mende" exhibition in Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery in 1980 will have a good idea of the range and quality of work produced by southern woodcar- vers (Gower 1980).2 There were, how- ever, two masks in the exhibition that stood out from the rest. They were not Mende work and they were not from the south. They were Temne. One was a Bemba ("ancestor") mask. The other was the mask a-Rong a-Thoma. 3 Together they were mute witnesses to there being another tradition of woodcarving in Sierra Leone, one that is inspired - to judge from its products - by a very dif- ferent aesthetic from that which seems to prevail in the south. It is this northern, "grasslands," style of woodcarving (to use Olayinka's term) that I want to describe in this article. Since examples in this style have rarely been illustrated in books on African art, it will also introduce the art traditions of northern Sierra Leone to a wider public. However, in order to draw the contrast with the southern style in the most dra- matic way possible, I have chosen to concentrate on woodcarving of the Limba people rather than that of the Temne. The Temne are the largest ethnic group in the northern province, but their territory is by no means confined to the north, and particularly at the margins they have influenced, and been influ- 45</page><page sequence="3">6.

Temne woodcarving, there- fore, is by no means homogeneous. For example, the wooden helmet masks of the women's society Bondo, the Temne equivalent of Sande, owe a great deal to Mende models. It is among the Limba - so it seems to me - that the "northern" style is to be found in its purest and most uncompromising form. The Limba live in a comparatively re- mote area. Until the 1980s there were no tarmac roads anywhere in the Limba homelands, and even today most vil- lages can only be reached on foot. The soil is poor and supports traditional forms of subsistence farming: mainly rice, sweet cassava, millet, and groundnuts. There has been little evi- dence of mineral wealth in the ground to attract immigrants from elsewhere in Sierra Leone or investment from abroad. In consequence the Limba have probably had less contact with outsiders than any other ethnic group. A further isolating factor has been their language, which is not readily understood by non-Limbas. Until fairly recently neither Islam nor Christianity had made serious inroads into Limba traditional practices and cul- ture. Their woodcarving, which of course is intimately connected with these other aspects of Limba life, is still relatively vigorous. But it remains a local tradition, or perhaps more accurately a series of local traditions, not much af- fected by what goes on elsewhere. Before I begin describing the wood- carving, let me make two points. First, I don't mean to suggest that there is a Limba style as such. The practice of dis- tinguishing between different styles of woodcarving by the use of ethnic labels has been roundly criticized recently (e.g., Vansina 1984). I agree with the points raised in general, and they seem to me to have an obvious application in the case of traditional art in Sierra Leone. Indeed, that is why I prefer to speak of broad regional differences between a southern style of woodcarving and a northern style. The sense in which the various carved wooden objects I shall be discussing and illustrating in this article are Limba is straightforward enough: with a couple of exceptions (Figs. 1, 11) I know them to have been carved and used by native Limba speakers in the Limba homelands. However, my present interest in them is as examples of a northern style. It is found among the Limba par excellence, I should argue, but many features of it are shared by the wood sculptures of other northern peoples, notably the Loko and the Temne. 46</page><page sequence="4">Secondly, I am conscious that any talk of stylistic traditions inevitably involves a certain amount of selectiveness. "Atyp- ical" works abound, and in choosing a limited number of examples to illustrate the points I am making I have had to be fairly ruthless. Inevitably my selection is weighted towards pieces that, in my judgment, have recognizable character and style and are not nondescript. Read- ers can judge for themselves whether they seem to have anything interesting in common, from the point of view of style, and the extent to which they con- trast with the better-known sculptures from the south of the country. But they will just have to take on trust that they are representative of northern carving as a whole, or - since mere statistical rep- resentativeness is not the issue - of what is most distinctive of the northern carving tradition. What, then, are the main characteris- tics of Limba woodcarving that distin- guish it from "Mende" or southern carv- ing? In the case of figure sculpture the most obvious distinguishing feature is the thick or strong neck (Figs. 2,6). In most southern female figures the slen- derness of the neck is emphasized. There is accentuation, too, of the lines or creases around the neck that are a sign of beauty to the Mende and other peoples in West Africa;4 hence the neck "rings" by which Mende figures are often iden- tified. By contrast Limba figures charac- teristically lack these rings. In many cases there is a pronounced bulge or swelling to the front of the neck, like an overprominent Adam's apple (hubeko in Limba; which is how, indeed, many Limba whom I asked about this charac- teristic described it). Limba and non- Limba informants were readily able to identify the strong neck as a distinguish- ing feature, and they were inclined to explain it in terms of the Limbas' reputa- tion for being sturdy and hard-working.5 Southern figures and masks are also conspicuous for their elaborate repre- sentation of the different braided hairstyles favored by southern women now and in the past. (A particularly well-known style shows the hair braided in patterns around the side of the head with a kind of cockscomb of raised ridges running front to back on the top.) This feature gives the skilled carver consider- able scope for the expression of exuber- ance and virtuosity in his command of fine detail. On Limba figures, on the other hand, hair is rendered in a severely simplified fashion. In most cases it is rep- resented by a series of roughly parallel ridges, or even by no more than parallel incised lines, running from the forehead to the nape of the neck (Figs. 4,6, 7,12). In other sculptures the hair is blocked out roughly (and, one might say, impres- sionistically) (Fig. 2). There is no attempt to copy actual braiding patterns. I have not noticed that Limba women are less careful of their appearance or spend less time dressing each other's hair than their Mende counterparts, but it is clearly not a major preoccupation of their artists. It is rare to find on Limba figures and masks the kind of smooth finish, the glossy surface, that is so often a feature of southern carving. Mende woodcar- vers seem to go to considerable trouble with sandpaper or emery paper or abra- sive leaves to achieve a smooth, unbro- ken surface. And they frequently use a mixture of black stain and palm oil, paint, or even black lacquer to create a shiny ebony-like effect. Limba woodcar- vers seldom attempt to get rid of or con- ceal the marks of the adze. When 7. GBANGBANI TRUMPET, SAFROKO LIMBA CHIEFDOM. 87cm. PRIVATE COLLECTION. 47</page><page sequence="5">by the men's Gbangbani society, which I will discuss later in this article. And this is a development one can see spreading. The representation of scarification marks, such as those one still sees on the face, neck, and torso of women in Sierra Leone, is common to Limba and Mende figure sculpture. In the case of southern figures, however, they are characteristi- cally idealized in the form of tiny, com- plex, neatly executed patterns, in which the southern woodcarver's penchant for fine detail is particularly apparent. On Limba figures the representation tends to be rougher and at the same time more naturalistic. It generally takes the form of a row of nicks or gashes in the wood (Fig. 3). In addition, however, Limba sculp- ture sometimes exhibits a form of surface decoration that is a feature of the carving of a number of ethnic groups in the Western Sahel (e.g., the Bamana and the Mossi). It involves a shallow scoring of the flat surfaces of the sculpture in long, examined closely their carvings will often be found to have hundreds of tiny surfaces, instead of a continuous plane, that catch the light at different angles. It is as if the Limba artist does not like the way too smooth a surface would hide the work that has gone into the carving and the qualities of the wood. It is certainly not a question of incompetence or slo- venly workmanship. Adze marks are clearly visible on sculptures that are in other respects highly accomplished. In other cases, where some attempt has been made to smooth the surface of the wood, a mat finish seems to be preferred to a glossy one. It is common enough for the wood to be left without any kind of staining or painting. In some cases fig- ures are covered with a kind of chalk or whitewash (kuwoso). Where color has been applied to older figures and masks, they are invariably stained rather than painted or lacquered, using black or reddish-brown dyes derived from local sources - a measure, no doubt, of the Limbas' attachment to, or dependence on, traditional techniques. Things, how- ever, are changing. Imported paints are beginning to be used to decorate the an- thropomorphic wooden trumpets used 8 KONTHOING SLIT DRUMS. SAFROKO LIMBA CHIEFDOM 9 KONTHOING.

They don't appear to rep- resent actual patterns of bodily mark- ings. Rather they act as a kind of decora- tive hatching to soften the stark lines and planes of the carving without interrupt- ing them. A similar scoring technique using the point of a knife can be seen in the patterns decorating the fronts of large wooden storage boxes in northern Limba chiefdoms (Fig. 15). There are parallels also with the patterns to be found on leatherwork all over the West- ern Sudan. 48</page><page sequence="6">Limba carvers make considerable use of pyrographic techniques in their sculp- ture. In some cases a heated knife or gouge is used to assist in the actual sculpting of a figure, for example in piercing a space in the figure between arm and body, which can then be en- larged using a penknife. However, pokerwork techniques are also used for decorative purposes, the darker scorched surfaces contrasting sharply with the untreated lighter wood to create areas of dark and light (Fig. 3). A scorched surface also acquires by this means a kind of rudimentary patina. Southern woodcarvers may make use of pyrographic methods for certain pur- poses - for example, the holes made i around the rim of masks for the attach- ment of a raffia fringe are almost invari- ably made with a hot poker or spoke - but I cannot recall ever seeing a southern woodcarving in which the marks of scorching or burning were preserved for decorative effect. In general, while Mende and Bullom carving tends toward a qualified naturalism, albeit with certain well- defined conventions of its own, Limba woodcarving, both masks and figures, tends to be more abstract, even cubist, in character. A good example of this is a female sculpture from Safroko Limba Chiefdom in which the main parts of the figure - head, neck, and trunk - are conceived of as cylinders standing one on top of the other (Fig. 4). The carver has carried through the distortion in- volved in such a conception by placing the ears at the very base of the head. Whereas Mende carvers can be almost pedantic in the attention they give to the detail of facial features such as eyebrows, eyelids, and nostrils, in Limba carving the reverse is true. The face is often re- duced to its barest elements: forehead, eyes, nose, and mouth, presented in the most schematic way possible. Eyes ap- pear as the merest slits, hardly to be dis- tinguished from the scarification marks on the face. A vertical ridge suffices for the nose. The hair is a few lines scratched on the surface of the head. A typical Limba treatment of the face is interesting because it reverses what has often been thought a distinctively Mende concept of beauty. Instead of there being a high domed forehead with eyes, nose, and mouth compressed together into a small triangle in the bottom third of the face, some Limba sculptures concentrate those features in the upper half of the face. There is no forehead to speak of. The eyes and the nose are placed high up on the head with the mouth immediately r, underneath; and below this is large space left blank like a huge chin (Fig. 1). It 11 FEMALE FIGURE 1 LOKO, MAKARI-GBANTI CHIEFDOM</page><page sequence="7">is a configuration that recalls masks of the Toma people in southeastern Guinea. The pose of Limba figure sculptures is often "stiff," with the back held straight and the legs slightly flexed at the knees. As a rule arms are held out at the sides and either link up with the hips or are held in the front, resting on the belly. In some pieces a slight but - I would hazard a guess - deliberate asymmetry in the positioning of the limbs gives a noticeable vitality to the carving (Fig. 5). But there is nothing here to distinguish Limba figure sculpture from southern work, which tends to be stiff and frontal in the same way. So far I have talked about Limba woodcarvings in terms of their general characteristics. I now want to list the main kinds of objects that Limba artists sculpt from wood and to give some ac- count of how they are used and what special meaning, if any, they carry. The most striking works are the an- thropomorphic wooden trumpets or megaphones of the men's society known as Gbangbani. Gbangbani is to be found all over northern Sierra Leone - among the Kuranko (who call it Gbangbe) and the Loko as well as among the Limba, with whom it is particularly associated. It is, at one level, a sort of men's club to which all, or virtually all, adult male Limbas belong. But it is also a witch- finding cult, the custodian of "medicines" of unique power in combat- ing witchcraft and the forces of evil that witchcraft unleashes on the world. In this latter guise it seems to attract to itself much of the dread and foreboding that witchcraft itself arouses. Gbangbani, Limbas will tell you, is nothing to joke about. And, indeed, such is the secrecy by which it is surrounded that you will rarely find a Limba prepared even to talk about it. Gbangbani trumpets (also called thayenki, sing. huyenki) are the central cult object of each Gbangbani group. They are each carved from a single piece of hollowed-out wood that is sculpted in the form of a woman with head, breasts, and arms (Figs. 6,7). In some cases, perhaps in most, the female form is in- corporated in the body of the trumpet and the figure's arms have the additional function of handles when the instrument is being "played." I have seen examples, however, where the female figure is carved in the round, standing on top of the trumpet section or sitting astride it. When it is standing upright on the ground or on a base made specially for it, it is easy to mistake a Gbangbani trumpet for a solid wooden sculpture. (In one vil- lage the keeper of the huyenki collected what seemed to be a two-legged stool or stand from the roof of the blacksmith's forge. He set this down in an open space in the bush and then fetched the trum- pet, which he stood upright on top of the stand. The two fitted neatly into one another. And there, before my eyes, was a carved female figure complete with legs and feet!) The mouthpiece is gener- ally a hole some 5 centimeters in diame- ter in the back and about two thirds of the way up. It connects directly with the hollowed-out barrel of the instrument. Trumpets do not vary much in size. The smallest I have seen was about 60 cen- timeters high, the largest a little over 100 centimeters. Many examples are crude work in which the female characteristics have been superimposed upon the basic trumpet shape in a comparatively unim- aginative way. But in others the tension between carving something that can function as a trumpet and carving a sculpturally satisfying female icon has been overcome with resounding success (Fig. 7). Strictly speaking the Gbangbani trumpet is not a musical instrument but a megaphone that amplifies and disguises the sound of the human voice. What the listener comes to recognize as the voice of the Gbangbani "devil" is produced by the player or operator putting his lips to the mouthpiece and making a nasal droning sound. At certain times it is used antiphonally, with the operator singing the words of a song - again in a heavily nasalized fashion - that the other society members take up and re- peat, and so on alternately. In the course of this the trumpet may be held vertically by the two arms, but apparently the pre- ferred method of carrying it seems to be to hold it in front of one's body at an angle, with one hand underneath sup- porting the rim and the other gripping the neck or an arm. By opening and clos- ing the lower hand over the mouth of the trumpet the player can cause the sound to be magnified or muted.6 As a rule Gbangbani trumpets are kept in the society "bush," an area of virgin forest adjoining the village where only members are allowed to go. In the rainy season they may be brought secretly to a hut in the village itself. The very exis- tence of such an object is a closely guarded secret. It is never referred to di- rectly in conversation, and on the occa- sions when it is brought out - which, in effect, is any occasion involving Gbangbani - the strictest precautions are taken to ensure that it is not seen by twomen and nonmembers. The latter, in- deed, are required to stay indoors with windows and shutters closed whenever the society is performing. In one village, I remember, where the night-long sing- ing and dancing of the society had con- tinued beyond daybreak, women who had to be on the road early were led out of the village by their husbands with their heads and faces covered by a cloth. 12.

There must be a great many such trumpets in regular use in the Limba areas in north and northwest Sierra Leone. However, the secrecy surround- ing them has meant that old and dam- aged examples tend to be retained in the Gbangbani bush instead of being sold off to traders. (In one place I saw one black- ened and broken stump of an ancient trumpet that had become a cult object in its own right and was continually re- newed by having palm oil poured over it.) As a result, very few have found their way into museums or private collections in Europe and America. Indeed, so far as I am aware, the National Museum of Af- rican Art in Washington, D.C., is the only public museum outside Sierra Leone to possess an example. (There are a dozen or more in private hands.) Gbangbani trumpets are the most ob- vious and distinctive examples of Limba woodcarving. However, it is also worth mentioning the wooden slit gongs that the Limba call konthoing (sing. kontho). Konthoing are used to call members of Gbangbani together, and they are also a signal for nonmembers to take cover. When struck with a stick on the side they make a sharp sound that carries a long way in the tropical night. Together with the slit drums nkali they provide a per- cussive accompaniment to the "singing" of the Gbangbani "devil." When not in use they are typically left lying beside the blacksmith's forge - which for the Limba is a site of great potency - or be- side the path leading to the society bush (Fig. 8). In the latter case they are a warn- ing to the unwary not to proceed further. Konthoing are the visible sign of Gbangbani, and it is rare to walk through a Limba village without coming across several of them lying together. Konthoing are a combination of slit gong and rhythm pounder. They have a single wide slit running the length of the barrel of the instrument, which itself is roughly hollowed out; there is a projec- tion at one end by which they can be held upright and lifted when Gbangbani is processioning through a village; and a much broader, heavier projection at the lower end where the kontho rests on the ground. It is this broad, flattened end of the kontho that is used to beat out the rhythm of the dance on the earth. Most slit gongs are between 90 and 120 cen- timeters long and between 10 and 20 cen- timeters across. The weight varies with the size, but some are extremely heavy. If we imagine a number of them pounding away in unison, it would explain the comment one Limba made to me - which at the time I did not take too seri- ously - that when Gbangbani is abroad, the earth shakes. Many Limba slit gongs are carved in a very rough and ready fashion without any sculptural pretensions. The projec- tion at the top is a plain wooden spike or "handle." But in a great many konthoing the handle is a neck terminating in a carved human head (Fig. 9). The concep- tion is similar to that of the Gbangbani trumpet. In both cases the body of the instrument corresponds to the body (lit- erally) of a carved figure. In the slit gongs, however, I have never known the notion to extend beyond the carving of a head at one end. And even that, while recognizably in the northern style, is not usually very elaborate. In addition to the full-sized konthoing there are much smaller slit gongs that seem to be intended to be held in one hand. One example I photographed in Paki-Masabong Chiefdom in 1986 was about 30 centimeters long and 7.5 cen- timeters across, but in other respects it was exactly like its larger counterpart. I assume that the English traveler Migeod was referring to hand gongs of this kind when he spoke of having come across "wooden dolls" in the course of his trek through Limba country in the 1920s: "At one place on the road where a path branched off, I saw four wooden dolls about fifteen inches long lying by the road. Only the head was indicated, but all were hollow and resounded when struck" (Migeod 1926: 41-42). I remarked earlier that konthoing are typically left lying by the path to the Gbangbani bush where they can be seen by passersby. It seems likely, then, that Migeod's "wooden dolls" were marking where the "path branched off" to the Gbangbani bush. Aside from the carved wooden trum- pets and slit gongs of the Gbangbani so- ciety, the Limba carve numerous female sculptures - some quite small, others 60 centimeters tall or more. (The largest Limba sculpture I have seen was 137 cen- timeters tall.) They are used for a variety of purposes, and in my experience there is nothing in the carving itself - not even the size - that identifies the pur- pose for which a particular sculpture was intended. Unless, therefore, a figure sculpture has been collected in situ and there is some reliable information about how it was used, it is pointless trying to be more specific. However, I will men- tion certain contexts in which I have seen figure sculptures being used in Limba areas. The Limba, like the Temne and many other ethnic groups in West Africa, carve wooden "twin" figures to take the place of an actual twin child who has died. They are washed and oiled and dressed and even offered food at the same time as the surviving twin so that the dead child's spirit will not be jealous of the lat- ter and bring him or her harm.7 The Temne tend to call all wooden figure sculptures ta-bari (sing. ka-bari), the Temne word for "the twins." Limbas do not.use their word for "twin" (batima) 51</page><page sequence="9">when referring to sculptures; instead they employ the more neutral word dega (pl. degeng), which simply means "statue" or "image." Nevertheless, many of their figures are twin figures in the strict sense. They are mostly small, between 15 and 36 centimeters high; a few are taller. They will generally be kept by the twins' mother to begin with, and thereafter by the surviving child. Since in the normal order of things a little girl may be given her "twin" to play with, it is not always easy in practice to draw a sharp line between a twin figure and a child's doll. There is one puzzling feature of twin figures for which I have no ready expla- nation. Without exception those that have been described to me as such have been female. Male twins are, I would guess, as common and as prone to die in infancy as female twins, but they seem not to be represented as male in sculp- ture. Male figure sculptures of any kind are extremely rare indeed in northern Sierra Leone. Twin figures belong within the wider category of sculptures that are objects of private cults. Some of these have been inherited by their owners from their par- ents and grandparents and may origi- nally have been twin figures, but if so, that aspect of them has been forgotten. I can remember one such carving attached to a woven basket that the owner, a man in his fifties, kept on a small platform or "shrine" just outside the door of his house (Fig. 10).8 In other cases the cult figure is one that the owner has had made for him or has carved for himself. Those prominent in cult associations, male and female, are often credited with having figure sculptures, as have those who administer "swears." The presence of "medicine packages" - bundles of natural materials wrapped in (usually) 16 WOODEN CHEST KASUNKO CHIEFDOM red cloth and with cowrie shells attached - on the head of a figure may be an indi- cation that it has been used for swearing purposes.9 The Limba do not usually leave their figure sculptures out in full view of pas- sersby. Occasionally, however, one finds a figure that seems to have a public pur- pose. I came across an example of this, a carving standing by the side of a path into a village (Fig. 11). It marked, I dis- covered later, the entrance to the local Gbangbani bush and was meant, like the konthoing I described earlier, as a warn- ing to strangers. This was in a Loko vil- lage, albeit one much influenced by its Limba neighbors, and it may be that Lokos are more given to using figure carvings in this more public way. In at least one Loko village of my acquain- tance, the guardian spirit of the place is represented by a large wooden carving that stands beneath the sacred cotton tree at the center of the village. In some parts of Safroko and Paki- Masabong it seems to be the custom for figure sculptures to be carved for boys who are proceeding through Bure ba, the male initiation. According to one ac- count I heard, the figures are retained in the society bush and are sometimes brought out and displayed. One man, a schoolteacher, spoke of having seen many such carvings at his own initiation. The custom does not seem to be wide- spread, but I have had confirmation of its existence from a number of independent sources, and in one Limba village I was even shown a small, rather nondescript sculpture that the owner, unprompted by me, said had been carved for his son's initiation some twenty-five years earlier. Such figures, I was told, are taken to rep- resent the initiate himself, and one would therefore expect them to be male. (The example in question was neither clearly one thing nor the other.) How- ever, Limba male figure sculptures, as I have already said, are few and far be- tween. There is a certain overlap between fig- ure sculptures and carved wooden staves or walking sticks that are com- monly found in Limba areas. Indeed, walking sticks often incorporate a carved human head or figure, or even two such figures standing one on top of the other. Snakes, too, either running along the length of the stick or winding around it, are a common motif. So far as I could dis- cover, these sticks have no ritual signifi- cance, and the sculptural elements - human figures, snakes, and the like - are decoration and nothing more. Carved wooden swords may well be another matter. I have come across a couple of examples, but because I have never seen them used in the ceremonies of cult associations I cannot speak with confidence here. What is undoubtedly true is that real metal swords of the sort used in the nineteenth century form a familiar part of the paraphernalia of the cult associations, specialists in 15. WOODEN CHEST KASUNKO CHIEFDOM. 52</page><page sequence="10">"medicines," and masked "devils." They are, for example, carried by the Sampa dancers of the women's Bondo associa- tion. Informants will tell you that these swords, relics of the precolonial period, are carried as protection against witch- craft; and a carved wooden "witch" sword seems a natural enough extension of that idea. In the example illustrated the carver has ingeniously translated the pommel and guard of the sword into a woman's head and breasts (Fig. 12). It is a particularly striking illustration of the Limba penchant for simplification. There are a number of different Limba masquerades, for example, Matoma and Gbendekolo (see Hart 1988), but only one involves the use of a carved wooden mask. Called Kuthombo, it is worn by a masker during the male initiation Bure ba. In the period when the initiates are secluded in the bush or initiation enclo- sure, Kuthombo acts as the intermediary between them and the village. With his attendants he visits the various households in the village to collect food and other articles needed by the chil- dren. In the event of a child dying during the Bure, he announces the death to the family. Finally, at the conclusion of the initiation, when the circumcision wounds are healed and the initiates have proved their manhood in a series of ordeals, Kuthombo leads them back in their new robes to the village. A similar role is played in Temne initiation by the maskers ka-Tumla and ka-Bemba, and the Kuthombo mask has much in common with the Bemba mask (see Hart 1987). The face tends to be larger than life-size and has an overhanging forehead and prom- inent nose. The mask that Olayinka used -to illustrate the grasslands style of wood- carving (Fig. 1), although without docu- mentation in this respect, has the ap- pearance of a typical Kuthombo mask (Fig. 13). Such masks usually have holes bored around the rim for the attachment of a grass cape of fringe that covers the head and upper body of the wearer. Apart from this, however, there does not seem to be a serious attempt to conceal the human identity of the masker. Some are obviously meant to be held in front of the face rather than worn. Kuthombo masks can be very different one from another. For example, contrast the Olayinka mask with another from Kasunko Chiefdom (Fig. 14). The latter is no more than a shallow dome of wood like an upturned bowl, with two eyeholes and the faintest suggestion of a nose on one side and a short curtain of grass, like a neckguard, hanging from the other. The reduction of head and face to their basic elements could hardly be taken further. The Limba and other groups in Sierra Leone make large storage boxes or chests of wood that they keep either on the front veranda of their houses or in one of the inner rooms. In the northern Limba chiefdoms (Wara Wara Bafodea, Wara Wara Yagala, and Kasunko) the fronts of these boxes are often decorated with abstract patterns.'0 On the examples I saw, these patterns had been produced by different means. On some they had been made by someone scoring the sur- face of the wood with a sharp instru- ment, possibly the point of a knife. On other boxes the patterns were obtained by first staining the wood surface and then scraping or cutting it away in places so as to reveal the white of the wood un- derneath (Figs. 15,16). Others again had been decorated using pokerwork tech- niques such as one also finds on Limba sculptures. (There are parallels, I be- lieve, in the techniques used to decorate these boxes and those used to decorate leatherwork.) The actual patterns them- selves varied a good deal. Some showed little evidence of overall organization and the different parts seemed to have been filled in rather haphazardly, almost as if the carver had been doodling. In others there was a definite structure and symmetry in the way the various ele- ments of the design were put together. All these patterns were made up of lines, triangles, squares, and other such motifs in a variety of combinations. Their abstract nature may indicate Muslim in- fluence. As for the storage boxes, so far as I could determine they have no ritual significance of any kind. They are utilita- rian objects in everyday use, though of course the more elaborately decorated ones also serve as markers of social pres- tige for their owners. Among the Limba, as among other Af- rican peoples, many items of everyday use are carved from wood: mortars for pounding rice, wooden spoons or spatulas, combs, and boards for the game of bangkang or warri. I might also include here one-legged stools or seats. These are T-shaped with the cross-piece usually slightly bowed - lower in the middle and higher at the sides. These are always made from two pieces of wood joined together by a nail in the middle. The flat cross-section is sometimes deco- rated with patterns made by scoring the wood. However, the upright, or "leg," offers scope for more elaborate carving, and I have known faces and even a com- plete human figure to be carved on the latter. These stools are found among the Loko as well as the Limba. The most common form of Limba seat(hu-yensi) is three-legged, consisting of a natural tripod formed by the branches of a tree. A cross-bar is secured between two of the branches about 12 centimeters above the ground, and the third branch acts as a support at the back. The wood is stripped of bark and is not usually carved, but I have seen one such seat in which the wood where the three branches came together had been carved into a rough likeness of a human figure (Fig. 17). Three-legged seats of this kind are found all over Sierra Leone and must have been in use for several centuries, since they are clearly represented in pre- historic soapstone carvings (nomoli) from southern Sierra Leone and also on the lid of a sixteenth-century Afro-Portuguese ivory saltcellar." The more utilitarian carvings of the Limba do not seem to be carved with much care or attention to style. It is ex- ceedingly rare to come across examples of what we might call "prestige" objects - highly ornamented wooden combs or snuffboxes - of the sort that nineteenth-century southern woodcar- vers seemed to have carved in abun- dance.12 A final point. I have hinted here and there in describing Limba woodcarving that it shares features with woodcarving of other ethnic groups that, like the Limba, live at some distance from the coast: the Kuranko, the Toma, the Bamana, the Mossi. I have no ready ex- planation for these similarities. But I wonder whether traditions of woodcarv- ing and religious practice with many shared features might not once have stretched right across the western Sahel and the neighboring savanna areas; perhaps the spread of Islam, by sub- merging the traditions of the intervening peoples, has left these to survive in more or less isolated pockets. It is as part of this larger world that I think the wood- carving tradition of northern Sierra Leone, exemplified here in the work of Limba carvers, is best understood. O Notes, page 103 17.

BIRIWA CHIEFDOM. 53</page><page sequence="11">HARJT Notes, from page 53 My research on Limba woodcarving was supported by grants from the British Academy and the University of Ulster. Joseph Opala of the Institute of African Studies, Fourah Bay College, made very helpful comments on an earlier draft of this article. I owe a special debt of gratitude to Bockari Ban- gura and Chernoh Njai who accompanied me on my trips through Limba areas. 1. Olayinka had built up her collection over a number of years, and so far as I am aware, it was the only major private collection of indigenous art owned by a Sierra Leonean. It was stolen in the mid-1970s while its owner was on a trip overseas. 2. Guy Massie-Taylor spent seven years in Sierra Leone in the 1950s as an Education Officer responsible for art in the curriculum. He began collecting traditional art in order to provide his students with indigenous models for their own creative work. He had the artist's eye for a fine piece, and over his years in Sierra Leone he put together what is perhaps the finest collection of Sierra Leone artifacts in existence. After his death in 1985 it was purchased by Glasgow Mu- seums and Art Galleries. 3. For Bemba masks see Hart (1987). The a-Rong a-Thoma is described in the catalogue of the exhibition as Araung Etoma. 4. The point is made by both Lamp (1985) and Phillips (1979). 5. Similar necks can be seen on other figure sculptures from the Western Sudan (e.g., Malinke and Bamana figurines). 6. Anthropomorphic wooden trumpets or megaphones have been reported among the Bembe and related peoples on the Congo side of the Congo-Zaire border (see Lehuard 1973). There are also carved wooden trumpets used by the Dyo soci- ety among the Bamana of southern Mali. The latter, however, are much smaller and lighter than Limba examples (cf. Im- perato 1983). 7. The Limba consider all twins to have "four eyes" (thaya thanang), special powers of insight into and control over spiritual powers at work in the world. An aggrieved twin is therefore a dangerous being. 8. From what I could see, the basket in question contained a number of small polished pebbles. Such collections of polished stones have long been known to commemorate dead ancestors. 9. For an account of the use of "swears" by the Limba, see Finnegan (1964). 10. In some places they are apparently made by Fula blacksmiths; the abstract patterns may reflect Fula - and Muslim - influence rather than anything characteristically Limba. 11. The saltcellar in question is in the Seattle Art Museum, Washington, and was formerly part of the Heeramaneck Col- lection. The museum catalogue number is 68.31. 12. However, the most elaborately carved gameboard in the Massie-Taylor Collection is recorded as a Limba piece. References cited Finnegan, R.H. 1965. A Survey of the Limba People of Sierra Leone.
