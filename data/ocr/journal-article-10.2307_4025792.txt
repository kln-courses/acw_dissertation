<plain_text><page sequence="1">Folia Baeriana I. Compiled by M. Valt and T. Ilomets, and edited by V. Kaavere and T. Sutt. Tallinn: Valgus, I975. Pp. i8i. i.i6 roubles. Karl Ernst von Baer was born near Jerwen in Estonia on 28 February 1792 and died in Dorpat (now Tartu), Estonia on 28 November I876. The i8oth anniversary of his birth was commemorated at the Institute for Zoology and Botany in Tartu. Folia Baeriana I is a slim volume of seven papers that were delivered on that occasion. The centenary of his death has since been celebrated with a number of publications, including Folia Baeriana II, and a translation into Estonian of von Baer's Morbis inter Esthonos endemicis. Karl von Baer is today remembered all over the scientific world as the most illustrious of the founders of descriptive embryology. But, in addition, his name has become associated with Charles Darwin, with the biogenetic law of Ernst Haeckel and with German Naturphilosophie. The essay by Dr K. P6ldvere on the fundamental problems of embryology confirms his pre-eminence as the father of embryology. The essays on his philosophical outlook by Drs M. and L. Valt, on his teleology by Dr T. Sutt, and on the evolutionary implications of type theory by Dr M. Valt clarify his position in relation to nineteenth-century biological philosophy. Karl Ernst was one of ten children of a small landowner Magnus Johann von Baer and his cousin Juliana Louise. Karl Ernst spent his early childhood with his paternal uncle and aunt who, being childless, shared Magnus Johann's family responsibilities. Dr T. Ilomets traces the genealogy of the von Baer family back to Prussia, to a Heinrich von Baer who died about I597. This extends the family history back a further thirty years from Andreas Baer, the great-grandson of this Heinrich, who left Prussia for Reval in Livonia. From 1708 until 192I, when Karl Ernst's two great-great-grandsons were born, the family tree is complete, compiled from the Baltic States Genealogical Handbook and the von Baer family Geheimbuch which has been preserved in the Estonian State Archives. Once settled in Estonia the family seems to have remained there and remained a close group. At the age of eighteen Karl Ernst was matriculated as a medical student at the new university of Dorpat (Tartu). After four years, in i814, he gained his MD. Some of the questions and some of the answers and short essays written by Karl Ernst are reproduced. Some questions at the time were in German and some were in Latin. We find him being examined in zoology, mathematics,</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 295 physiology, pathology, forensic medicine and maternity, for example. He was rated very good in forensic medicine and physiology but only moderately good in maternity. Questions ranged from the differences in the physiology of plants and animals to an account of puerperal fever and the uses of Salix in medicine. Records from the science library of the university for I 812 and 1813 have been analysed by Dr E. Kudu. They show that Karl Ernst worked there and borrowed books. On 7 February I8I2 he took out a book on medical science written by one of his professors Dr Karl Friedrich Burdach. From Dorpat Karl Ernst von Baer went to Wiirzburg to complete his anatomical studies under the great nineteenth-century teacher Ignaz Dollinger. Dr P6ldvere rightly stresses the importance of this encounter. Dollinger taught that theory and philosophy should be supported by positive facts; study should consist of close observation of material and of independent investigation on the part of the student. This approach suited von Baer. Dollinger encouraged initiative and self-sufficiency; he encouraged his pupils to develop their own capabilities, and as a result, he won their lasting affection and respect. Long afterwards, von Baer wrote that his life's ambition was to pay honour and respect to D6llinger. As Dr P6ldvere writes, many science teachers today could take a lesson from D6llinger. Despite pressure from Dollinger von Baer did not stay in Wiirzburg, but went to Vienna and Berlin; then in i8 I7 he was invited by Burdach to go to Konigsberg as Professor of Anatomy. K6nigsberg at this time was one of the great centres of anatomy and physiology. Kirchhoff had worked out the system of catalysis in carbohydrates, Burdach was teaching there, and von Baer was to be succeeded by Martin Heinrich Rathke. von Baer's great friend and source of inspiration was Heinrich Christian Pander who had stayed on at Wurzburg to work on the development of the chick egg. It was he who encouraged von Baer to work along the same lines once he had established himself at Konigsberg. He and Dollinger both impres- sed on von Baer the need to look down the microscope and to employ a pro- fessional to make drawings of what was seen. To theorize was not enough. In I817, Pander brought out the first great book on embryology which, with the earlier work on microscopical observation by Swammerdam, formed the starting point for von Baer. As Dr P6ldvere writes, von Baer described Swam- merdam as tempting him like a will o' the wisp. He considered Swammerdam the founder of developmental theory, the destroyer of old myths and the first observer of developmental change. It is interesting to learn of this devotion to Swammerdam and to learn that von Baer could always be persuaded to take time off from his research and his teaching duties to give lectures about Swam- merdam and microscopy. From I8I9 to I834, von Baer made most of his well-known discoveries. After he left K6nigsberg for a chair at St Petersburg in I834, his work on embryology was at an end. He remained at St Petersburg for the rest of his working life, contributing to anthropology and archaeology. Folia Baeriana I is not concerned with this later period of his life. While still at Konigsberg, von Baer discovered the notochord, the neural folds, the embryonic membranes all of which led to the enunciation and extension of the germ-layer theory which had started with the observations of Wolff and Pander. von Baer realized, again following Wolff, that development was epigenetic and that there were no preformed homunculi in eggs. At the time, the discovery which created the greatest effect on the scientific world was that of the mammalian ovum. von Baer opened the Graafian follicles which had been supposed to be the ova and found a yellowish point floating freely in the</page><page sequence="3">296 Book Reviews fluid: the real mammalian ovum, equivalent to the tiny specks that floated down the oviducts. 'Omnia viva ex ovo' was finally confirmed. More important for biological theory was his discovery that in development the general develops before the special: a vertebrate is a vertebrate from the beginning and only later a bird or a mammal. Dr P6ldvere gives an excellent account of von Baer's embryological work showing how his observations led to his theories. von Baer looked for symmetry, for observer though he was, he was strongly influenced by Naturphilosophie. Drs M. and L. Valt reappraise von Baer's philosophy showing how it is naive to dismiss him as a docile follower of Naturphilosophie. Really, they write, von Baer was trying to unify the idealist dialectic of Naturphilosophie with mechanist materialism; in other words, aiming for and nearly achieving a dialectical materialist philosophy. Dr Sutt takes the analysis a step further in reviewing von Baer's teleological philosophy. As he writes, von Baer has been criticized for being too mechanistic on the one hand and too anthropomorphic and teleological on the other. There is no doubt that von Baer believed that the struggle towards a goal was a general property of the developmental process, but what caused the struggle to start, and what was the meaning of the directed- ness, remained problems. They were problems that von Baer avoided. As Dr Sutt observes, this was probably because of his idealistic outlook, his adherence to type theory, and his refusal to accept the principle of natural selection. Type theory is considered by Dr M. Valt. Deriving from the comparative anatomy of Cuvier and comparative embryology of von Baer it divided the living world up into a few distinct types between which there were no inter- mediates. von Baer did not accept transformism and was totally opposed to the recapitulation theory that the Darwinians based on his observations. The embryo of higher animals does not pass through the adult forms of lower animals: the embryo develops from the general to the particular. And there is an unbridgeable gap between higher taxa, a gap which becomes more notice- able as development proceeds. Man stands on one side of one of these gaps; other mammals on the other side. This is an interesting collection of Baeriana and one which should be more widely available to historians of science. Some of the articles are in German but most are in Estonian. Not many of us can read Estonian and the short German summaries do not do justice to these articles. A full German or English translation would be a useful contribution to the study of nineteenth-century science. WILMA GEORGE Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford</page></plain_text>
