<plain_text><page sequence="1">Free spirit by Norma S. Steinberg Wanda Gag: A Catalogue Raisonn? of the Prints, by Audur H. Winnan. Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1993, 310 pp., $75.00 hardcover. THIS ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUE of Amer- ican printmaker and illustrator Wanda Gaig's graphic output also contains a biographical essay and selected excerpts from her diaries and letters. Bom in 1893, Gag studied life drawing and, we read in the biographical essay, drew credible caricatures of her fellow students at the Minneapolis School of Art and New York's Art Students League (to both of which she won scholar- ships), but rarely portrayed the human figure in her published work. She came of age in the 1920s, the era of the "New Woman," and shared the convic- tion of many contemporary women profes- sionals that career and sexual fulfillment were not mutually exclusive. She became known both as a commercial and a fine artist whose work was carried at the prestigious Weyhe Gallery in New York, and whose drawings were published in The New York Times, The Liberator and, in 1926, in the first issue of New Masses. Her lithograph, "Elevated Station, 1926," was selected as one of the "Fifty Prints of the Year" by the American Institute of Graphic Arts. The excerpts here from Gaig's diaries and letters provide welcome insights into the mind of the artist both as artist and sexual being. "1 had told him [Dr. Hugh Darby] that the right kind of love-affairs helped me draw, and I told him he might consider himself responsible for some of the results in my ABC book," she noted on May 25, 1933. Reveling in an open relationship, she was describing an inter- lude during a declared "vacation" from Earle Humphreys, her long-time companion. Titillating disclosures are sprinkled through- out her excerpted diaries, although some- times in code-a "treetop" is sexual inter- course, for instance. Gag took as her right the same access to human sexuality that society had always granted to male artists for whom the duality of sexuality and artistic creation was understood. G?g's diaries also outline her social and professional activities: a week at Lake George with Alfred Stieglitz and Georgia O'Keeffe, dancing at a charity ball with Rockwell Kent, meetings with her printer George Miller, viewing the photographic records of Diego Rivera's Radio City mural with Rivera, art juries for the American Ar- tists Congress (1936) and the World's Fair (1939), art exhibitions and rendezvous with suitor Carl Zigrosser (and others), difficulties with her publishers, and outlines of her read- ing. The G?g Collection at the University of Pennsylvania comprises over one hundred volumes and must provide a revealing docu- ment of the period. Audur Winnan includes excerpts from "A Hotbed of Feminists," an article that G?g wrote for The Nation. She was one of seven- teen "modern women" requested to write anonymously on the subjects of men, mar- riage, children and jobs. (The essays ap- peared from 1926 to 1927, G?g's on June 22, 1927.) Some of the women had careers in public life, some were writers and others were revolutionary feminists. At 34 years of age, G?g was among the youngest of the women selected and, given her accomplish- ments in both the commercial and fine arts worlds, she represented a specific category to the managing editor, Freda Kirchwey (her- self a "New Woman"). In her essay Gag relates the story (with names changed) of her impoverished child- hood, as the eldest of seven children of an artist who painted houses for a living and died when she was fifteen. She and her sib- lings "drew as soon as they could hold a pencil," but it was Wanda who promised to fulfill her father's dream. When her mother died nine years later, she made arrangements for the family and went to New York to complete her education and earn money. She then began her first serious romance (with Adolph Dehn, called Homer in the essay), and came to some difficult conclusions about marriage, children and art, deciding that she was more interested in "creating aesthetically than physically."' Like nineteenth-century feminists who saw career and marriage as mutually ex- clusive, Gag chose to forswear marriage be- cause it meant having children. On the other hand, like the modem women of The Nation who mostly believed in having both a career and marriage (and children), G?g would not eschew physical relations with men. Because she did not intend to have children, she saw no requirement for marriage, although she did, in fact, marry Earle Humphreys just a few years before she died in 1946 at the age of 53 (of lung cancer). The marriage osten- sibly took place only to prevent Humphreys from being fired on the basis of their "im- moral" living arrangements. On the subject of feminism Winnan is surprisingly silent. She quotes G?g on her belief that flirtations and sexual escapades helped her drawing-"The aesthetic value of sin is not to be sneezed at," "a new love affair can rejuvenate one"-but she does not ex- amine G?g's acceptance of the injustice of having to choose between being a mother and a professional artist. Winnan makes no at- tempt to relate G?g's ideas to the social con- text of "new womanhood," and eliminated from her book the second half of Gag's essay, which included the phrase about aesthetic creation quoted above. G_ AG'S PRINTS ARE IDIOSYNCRATIC,. con- centrating on the crowded comers of everyday life where spinning-wheel, bookcase, firehose, chest of drawers, fire- place, or napping cats signify the human presence. Her other major subject was trees. In this she was influenced by Van Gogh, whose ideas and imagery seemed especially congenial, according to diary entries. (She also read Delacroix, C?zanne, Gauguin and Roger Fry.) She would not portray a fantasy life, whether via the female nude or com- plaisant office girl, unblemished rural com- munity or sterile smokestacks. G?g's was a homely world sufficient in its details. Her anthropomorphic forms, composed of supercharged, wavy lines and a texture of thousands of tiny strokes, appear ready for metamorphosis to another life state. Long shadows, often from a kerosene lamp, pro- duce enigmatic forms and impenetrable spaces in spirited but airtight interiors. The subjects are engaging and mysterious at the same time. She was successful in developing an in- dividualistic style that did not quite belong within either Social Realism or American Scene, major American art movements of the early twentieth century. Her creation of a philosophy of coordinating force-lines is ex- plained in diary excerpts, which become, the key to understanding her air-locked spaces. Explaining the field she creates around and between each concrete object, she wrote, "1 "lMacy's Stalrway"1 Lithograph, 1940-41.

Woodcut, 1927. From Wanda G?g. am just as eager as nature to fill a vacuum with something...a tiny rhythm of its own, that is a rhythm created by its surrounding forms." Winnan seems to accept the hierarchy of values in traditional art history that under- rates the so-called minor arts, including printmaking. This was one "rule" Gag her- self was unable to defy; her personal com- ments clearly indicate her preference for the graphic arts, and yet she attempted all her life to paint in oil. In this book devoted to the artist as a printmaker in black and white, Winnan inexplicably incorporates a group of eight full-page, full-color examples of G?g's work in watercolor. These illustrations manifest Gag's linearpower and density, but do little to prove her strength as a painter or printmaker. Those of us who enjoyed Millions of Cats (1928), G?g's illustrated children's story, would have been pleased to see illustrations from that book. A financial and critical suc- cess, Millions of Cats and the more than fif- teen illustrated children's books that fol- lowed provided her with the economic freedom to pursue art without the worry of everyday survival (or dependence on men). The catalogue does include the thirty illustra- tions she produced in the form of lithographs for TheABCBunny (1933), but because those for Millions of Cats had been reproduced commercially, Winan chose not to include them. The scope of this catalogue raisonne, al- though restricted to G?g's 122 limited-edi- tion, original prints, is otherwise comprehen- sive in its ambition. Winnan includes pre- liminary drawings, states, editions, printers, the location of prints and printing matrices. For the serious art historian or print collector, she also includes a concordance with the ear- lier catalogue produced by Weyhe, a biblio- graphy (where a book devoted to the illustra- tions is indeed listed) and, most important, clear photographs of all the images. One small error, however: G?g was not the only artist to have printed using a sandpaper matrix, as Winnan suggests. This method seems to have had some currency among printmakers in the 1920s; William Gropper, an artist-friend, had more than twenty in his oeuvre. Aware of her intelligence and artistic competence, Wanda G?g believed in herself as a creative person. She expected to be eco- nomically and sexually independent, honest and free in her relationships, and she suc- ceeded. She was well regarded as an artist and illustrator by her peers and by contem- porary collectors. She has been overlooked in art histories then and now, however, because her style could not be ca tegori zed and be - cause realism of any stamp was eclipsed by abstraction. This book gives both an intro- duction to her life and shape to her printed work. Not only Gag's creations but the whole seemingly arcane world of prints will be opened to a broader public thirough this noteworthy book. 4. 1 Wanda Gag, "A Hotbed of Feminists," in These Modern Women, edited by Elaine Showalter (Old Westbury, NY: The Femi- nist Press, 1978, 1989), p.l313.
