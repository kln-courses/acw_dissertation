<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE EXPLANATION OF RELIGION* by MARTIN PROZESKY Philosophy is just as relevant to the work of analysing the meaning of religion in a secular, culturally pluralist age as it was to the constructing of classical theology in previous periods of history in the west, but in a much changed way. My purpose in this paper is to describe three such areas of contemporary philosophical relevance. These three areas are the theory of explanation, and what I have taken to calling philosophical cosmology and philosophical anthropology, respectively, terms whose meaning I shall elucidate later. They impinge on the work of the philosopher of religion as resources for constructing rigorous explanations of religious phenomena modelled on explanatory procedures developed in the natural and human sciences and extensively analysed by philosophers of science and of history (cf Hempel 1970, Hesse 1980, Popper 1968; Dray 1957). Thus my contentions in this paper presuppose the feasibility of giving explanations of religion, though I do not here defend my belief in that feasibility. It must suffice in the present context for me to say that there is nothing self-evidently inappropriate for a thinker who examines religious beliefs and practices to ask why they are held or undertaken, why they take their particular forms, or why religion appeared in human cultures and has remained there with such apparent tenacity. These are essentially explanation-seeking questions, and in looking for an answer to them it is natural to consider using methods of explaining that have worked well in other fields. Since these constitute an important modern section of epistemology, the theory or philosophy of explanation is an important new resource for the philosopher of religion. My examination of it has yielded the explanatory strategy that is summarized in section II of this paper, but before it can be presented meaningfully, it is necessary to deal first with the domain of the explicandum - the religious data that need explaining. I THE EXPLICANDUM : ESSENTIALS OF RELIGION It is perfectly possible to confine one's interest to restricted aspects of religion on earth, for example hymn-singing or belief in the existence of the human soul, and seek explanations for them. My * This paper was originally presented at the 1985 Congress of the Association for the Study of Religion (Southern Africa) at the University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg.</page><page sequence="2">30 THEORIA own interest, however, is very much broader, and concerns certain widely recurring patterns that scholars have documented wherever people practise a religion; in fact the detection of these recurrent patterns of belief and custom is our main reason for speaking generally about religion at all. And among those recurrent patterns I am particularly interested in a set which has some right to be regarded as definitive in view of its prevalance and fundamental importance. There are five elements in the set, and I shall briefly identify them. (A detailed and somewhat longer set including these five is given in Prozesky 1984, 15ff.) Religious believers everywhere show a strong and even dominant concern with what might, for want of a better term, be called benefit: for divine help with their problems, for a comforting sense of meaning and purpose in their lives, for certainty in the face of insecurity, for healing, enlightenment, salvation and many other forms of relief from whatever distresses them and for which no other remedy is thought to be available. Data from all the main forms of religion leave no doubt at all on this score. At its most ambitious, this concern issues in the promise that a given faith will provide believers with total well-being in the form of an ultimate overcoming of all that menaces their existence, such as salvation from eternal damnation in the doctrines of Christianity, or from a meaningless infinity of rebirths in Hindu teaching. The exact nature of the benefit varies considerably, but in some form or other it is always present. Two aspects of it call for emphasis: often the problem for which relief is sought is one for which little or no other recourse is thought to be available by the believers in question, so that their religion functions as an avenue of assistance when all else has failed or lost credibility, while secondly there is in the so-called world religions a desire for a perfect and final solution to one's difficulties. Religions can thus be seen as instruments for coping with the acutest of human afflictions, whatever these may be from person to person or group to group. Believers speak of their sense of the presence of invisible, highly effective powers at work in human experience and in nature. Nearly always they conceive of these powers as spiritual beings of varying degrees of importance, from lowly spirits to the towering majesties of the great monotheistic gods. The investigator may have personal doubts whether these spiritual beings exist objectively, but there can be no doubt that believers in all ages and regions find them utterly real, to the point of reporting detailed conversations with them which purportedly channel special religious knowledge or revelations into human consciousness. This last point is conspicuously the case with the founders of the main monotheistic traditions.</page><page sequence="3">THE EXPLANATION OF RELIGION 31 Religious consciousness is further characterized for many people by a fundamental sense that we humans and our world are far surpassed by another order of reality, more powerful, worthy and durable than mundane existence, a reality of which glimpses are possible but which otherwise remains mysterious. Typically, this sense of a reality greater than anything else, and thus transcending all else - perhaps to the point of being of a radically different kind, as in the dualistic religions - fuses with the believer's conviction that there are around us invisible beings, so that those beings are thought of as occupying an inherently higher rung on the ladder of existence than we do. But a sense of transcendence can also take the form of belief in an undifferentiated order of reality entirely free of any individuation, and hence of all the distressing complexities that are possible or even inevitable in a relational universe. In response to the felt presence of what is taken to be this higher world of invisible spiritual realities, the people in question manifest a powerful re-organization of their lives and a striking dedication of them, for which the word faith is commonly used. The articulated content of that faith varies greatly, but it is always something deeply held, exhibiting prime importance for the believer and evoking a willingness to restructure ideas and lifestyles to conform to its perceived character. In this sense, faith is indeed a planetary reality (Smith 1979) and becomes religious in the popular sense of the word when related to the conviction that we humans are subject to the will and visitations of invisible, transcendent, spiritual beings, or are capable of reaching an undifferentiated, spiritual order of reality. The global picture of religion shows us that the characteristics just listed, while recurringly evident, are embodied always in the idiom and other expressive media of whatever culture a given believer lives in, and that these always differ in point of detail. Nearly all religions evince a belief in spirits, but no two are identical in their conceptions of those spirits. The term 'cumulative traditions' has been helpfully coined as a label for this fifth basic fact about religion (Smith 1978). There is more to religion, of course, than this, but my intentions in the present discussion can be met by confining matters to the five characteristics just identified. With them in mind we can now return to the question of explaining religion. In doing so the investigator steps back, as it were, from a study of religious data and the descriptive generalizations to which they give rise, and asks why people all over the earth and in every known period of history should exhibit this kind of belief and behaviour. It is here that philosophy offers significant resources, starting with the problem of explanatory method.</page><page sequence="4">32 THEORIA II ON EXPLANATION Philosophers of the physical and human sciences have performed an invaluable service by helping us to establish what would constitute an adequate explanation of a problem and by clarifying the logical structure of the most successful methods of explanation that have been developed in those sciences. My purposes here do not require that these matters be stated in detail, so I shall give no more than a summary of them. This can be done by means of three points. Firstly, to explain something or identify its explicans is, in this context, to identify what causes it. Secondly, a proposed cause, or set of causes, must have the nature, power, and duration that would produce the effect whose explanation is being sought. In the physical sciences this second stipulation is generally held to be most effective in the form of an appeal to one or more laws of nature, like explaining why Humpty Dumpty fell by citing the law of gravity, and by specifying the exact circumstances or initial conditions in which the laws concerned come into effect, for example that Humpty Dumpty leaned over too far backwards. In the human sciences, where laws of nature have not been identified in the same way, the analogous move is an appeal to pervasive, fundamental human dispositions, such as the need to satisfy material needs according to some forms of Marxian social science. Either way, one explains particular problems by subsuming them under whatever causal factors will most plausibly account for them in the specific circumstances of their occurrence. This is also true in many of the day-to-day explanations we give or accept in the course of our ordinary activities, as I shall show later by means of an illustration. Thirdly, the resultant complex of causal factors must cohere with the larger corpus of accepted knowledge and exhibit its own internal coherence. Logical consistency is thereby ensured. This usually means the development of a systematic explanatory theory combining all the elements of the explanation, particularly in connection with complicated problems. In relation to human behaviour, an illustration might be helpful. Suppose that Jones, while strolling down Main Street in conversation with us, suddenly darts off into a florist and returns with a carnation in his lapel. Surprised by his behaviour, we ask him why he acted thus. He replies by saying he can never resist carnations, and we are satisfied, knowing him to be a lover of fine things. What has happened here is the identification of a fact of his character; something that is true of him always and everywhere, and powerful enough to make him do certain things in appropriate circumstances. It therefore eliminates our sense of surprise, so</page><page sequence="5">THE EXPLANATION OF RELIGION 33 gaining acceptance as an adequate explanation. And if Jones always and everywhere responds to the allure of carnations unless prevented by a more powerful obstacle, we could logically, though not conventionally, think of this as a law of the Jonesian nature, because laws of nature are precisely such invariant regularities as this. It is also illuminating to reflect on the kind of reply by Jones that would not satisfy us; for example, had he said that he bought the carnation because there are precisely twelve moons in the Jovian system (as there evidently are), or because he at that precise moment felt hungry (as he did), or because he mildly dislikes having spare cash on him (as indeed he does). All of these replies are true but none of them works as an explanation, either through lacking causal affinity with the explicandum, or through lacking causal efficacy sufficient to produce the behaviour in question, as in the third reply. For an explanation to work it must identify appropriate, verified causes, the appropriateness being ensured basically by the possession of sufficient power or efficacy to produce the effects in question, by an affinity of natures between explicans and explicandum, and by superiority in these respects over rival explanatory hypotheses. In short, it must be such that in the absence of the alleged causes of the phenomenon in question, the phenomenon itself would not exist or behave as it does. These requirements encourage an analogous approach to the explanation of religious belief and behaviour as identified in the five-part descriptive generalization given earlier. It alerts the investigator to the possibility that there are in human beings and in the cosmos at large (understood as the enveloping external world of all that is the case, whatever its nature might be), factors of such pervasiveness, power and nature as to induce in people, in given conditions, the typical characteristics of religion. Are there any powerful, fundamental, widespread and enduring human properties and environmental forces (in the broadest, least theory- laden sense) such that in the appropriate circumstances, which would of course also have to be identified and verified, people would evince the characteristics of religious belief and behaviour mentioned above, as well as variations and evolutions of them? If so, the explanation of religion would consist in a modified form of what I shall call soft covering law explanation. The attraction of such a possibility is that it is a rigorous and maximally comprehensive form of explanation, because its logical form corresponds to the strictest kind of inference available in connection with statements about human behaviour, namely the most highly probable inductive inferences. No other strategy provides as much explanatory potential. Until it has been shown to be unworkable, as it most certainly has not, the search for the best</page><page sequence="6">34 THEORIA possible understanding of religion must therefore make use of it. The next step in this exercise is to seek the necessary causal factors, and these, as indicated previously, must be sought in human nature on the one hand and in the external world or cosmos on the other. And this leads me to the two remaining areas where philosophy is relevant to the analysis of religion, which I shall discuss in the next section. Ill PHILOSOPHICAL ANTHROPOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOLOGY These terms signify a philosophical analysis of the fundamental conditions and structures of human existence in the cosmos, of a kind broadly like the analyses given by thinkers such as Heidegger, Jaspers and other existentialists, though not tied to their ideas. In fact it strikes me as essential to develop fresh ideas in this field to overcome important limitations and negativities in the existentialists' understanding of human existence, especially in relation to religion. It is also clear to me that axiology or the theory of values is highly relevant to the philosophy of religion in this anthropological context. The question here is as follows: mindful of the basic characteristics of religion as stated above, and of the quest for its possible causes in our make-up as persons and in the workings of the cosmos, are there any generic human qualities and environmental or cosmic forces (in an open sense of those words), which might be those causes? My answer is that there are indeed, and that there are four of them: our finitude, sentience, creativity and contextuality or Umweltlichkeit , the property of being involved in an environing cosmos. Let me enlarge on each of these four qualities. The fact of our finitude needs no justification since it is evident to and accepted by all, but its implications bear comment. To be finite means always to be in some measure ignorant about ourselves and the wider world of other selves and non-human entities, no matter how much we enlarge our knowledge. In particular it means that the full picture of things, the ultimate truth about reality as a whole, is not and may never be known to us, in the strict sense of knowledge as intersubjectively justified true belief. This in turn implies that there is for us a permanent element of mystery about things, for although much that was mysterious to earlier generations or to ourselves in the past is now well understood, there are still other matters which remain entirely obscure. And concerning the nature of reality as a whole, our cognitive limitations indicate that the obscurity will remain, as western philosophy since Kant appears to confirm. Finitude also means that there are limitations to what we</page><page sequence="7">THE EXPLANATION OF RELIGION 35 can do, partly because of our restricted knowledge but also because our human capacity to act has its own obvious limits. Yet despite this we experience a never-ending desire for more than we have at any given time. Human curiosity does not cease because we know we do not know everything but goads us to discover more, just as the shortcomings of our physical achievements themselves act as a spur to further efforts at obtaining what we want. It appears that we are constituted to strive endlessly against our own finitude, a fact of the utmost importance for the genesis of religion. At least since Aristotle, our capacity to feel pain and pleasure has been recognized as a most important fact in the determination of our behaviour and in the formation of our values, for we clearly prize or value that which satisfies us or gives us happiness, and assign a negative value to whatever does the opposite, taking endless pains to organize our lives accordingly. I have argued elsewhere that this fact of human life is the mainspring not only of the emergence of religion but of all culture, defined as the totality of human contrivance and transmitted by non-biological means, so I shall not repeat that argument here. (Prozesky 1984: 99ff). Instead, I wish to draw attention to the massive motivational power of our sentience, as shown, for example, by the enormous energy we devote to the treatment of disease and the alleviation of pain, or to the satisfaction of sexual desire. Adding the present point about sentience to the previous one about finitude yields a picture of human existence as involving a powerful but ever fallible drive to shape our lives for as much satisfaction and as little discomfort as possible. And this in turn means that a centrally important concern for all humans at all times is to identify the sources of satisfaction and discomfort as accurately as possible, so that we can relate fruitfully to them. But our very finitude means that this pressing imperative can never be perfectly enacted within our cognitive and behavioural means, so conferring on us a permanent vulnerability. But vulnerability is not something we welcome, so its permanence engenders an equivalent uneasiness or anxiety to which modern homo sapiens is notably prone. It may be that we shall just have to live with this reality, but in ages past the typical human response to it has evidently been to search for ways of overcoming it too - for ways of overcoming the root problem of finite sentience. Thus the converse reality is a creative capacity to struggle against and partially reduce the conditions that promote experiences of dissatisfaction and misery. It happens in every sector of our lives: the detection of life-enhancing values, the discovery of knowledge, the invention of concepts or their deconstruction and replacement, and all the myriad products which have sprung from our efforts at betterment and the reduction of suffering in ourselves and those whom we value.</page><page sequence="8">36 THEORIA Let me enlarge on one aspect of this creativity, namely the discovery of knowledge. The issue here is how we acquire the concepts in terms of which to articulate our discoveries and thus constitute them as items of knowledge, particularly in view of the general movement of human cognition from ignorance to knowledge, which clearly makes it impossible to point solely to the use of existing concepts. In such a movement, those concepts must be found afresh; they must be invented, but how? The answer appears to lie in part at least in a ubiquitous feature of the learning process, namely the use of the known as a model for the unknown. Coupled with the projective tendency of the mind, this means that an inevitable device in the process of learning to understand whatever is strange to us is anthropomorphism. People will picture the unknown by means of human and social or other familiar models, until the inherent limitations of this device set in motion a desire for superior cognitive structures. The old are then modified, enlarged or replaced. At this point new initiatives in the philosophy of culture seem especially relevant, for instance the ideas of Derrida and Foucault (Novitz 1985, Sheridan 1981). In combination with the two previous facts of human existence, the present one yields a further picture of humanity as constituted by its creative struggle to promote conditions in which misery is reduced and satisfaction enhanced, but always within the limitations of available knowledge, productive effort, ability to endure suffering, and realism in the assignment of values to things. I would argue that this is a basic fact about the way we are as persons and not merely a contingency of this or that society, class or historical period, and I name it a drive to maximise well-being, a drive whose expressions are permanently restricted by our human finitude, but also permanently fuelled by the discontent it engenders. The search for an explanation of religion is largely a search for an adequate explicans, and I know of none more suitable on factual and logical grounds than this drive, though other factors are also involved, to which I now turn. Human life is inherently involved in an environment constituted firstly by other humans but also by the wider context of nature, and perhaps in some degree by everything that exists. It is important that I state quite clearly that I use the phrase 'everything that exists' in an open way, without smuggling into it the pre-suppositions of either the idealists and supernaturalists or the materialists. In fact I am not particularly interested in ontological categories at all, but in the dynamics or functions of reality at large, and in the fact that our lives are inherently involved with them. To be human is thus to belong to a power-filled but always imperfectly grasped Umwelt or context and to be affected by it at the very depths of our being. According to Strawson, one would not even form a self-conception</page><page sequence="9">THE EXPLANATION OF RELIGION 37 as a person without other persons around one (Strawson 1959), and we obviously cannot exist without the physical resources of the world around us. Thus human existence emerges and unfolds as part of a wider, anterior reality or cosmos with its myriad interacting forces, from the force of gravity to the power of an ambition, phobia or ideal, part of which is invisible to us and may forever elude our desire to comprehend it, especially its ultimate character; but which nonetheless ceaselessly affects us though our sentience and dependence on it, producing in us now discomfort and now happiness in an uncertain, unpredictable and uncontrollable succession of events and experiences. The growth of human knowledge and technology from near total ignorance and incompetence to their present level has been spectacular, but in no way changes this fundamental fact about our existence. What is ultimately the case, what could be the case and what affects us most are always matters which surpass our knowledge and competence at any given time. In philosophical terms, the class of possible propositions and the class of true propositions are always larger than the class of known propositions. We are not even in a position to establish by how much the former exceed the latter. But vulnerable, sentient beings will necessarily experience this state of affairs, once an awareness of it has formed, with profound disquiet because it means that our fear of pain and our desire for well-being are in the end not matters we control, and neither can we with our own resources establish what does control them. Yet given our creative resources, it follows that at least some people will seek ways of reducing this difficulty by means of a creative engagement with it at that frontier of vulnerability and ignorance. Thus the point of interaction between a mysterious cosmos which both menaces and benefits us, and our own attempt to stretch ourselves beyond existing limits of mind and skill constitutes a distinct arena of human creativity and experience. And since the Umwelt is never identical from person to person and especially from locality to locality and at different historical periods, the ensuing creativity will necessarily exhibit a resultant differentiation, just as hunger in Iceland is met by a different diet to that which obtains in the tropics or the desert. The result, I contend, is religion. IV EXPLAINING RELIGION A general explanatory theory of religion must be very complex indeed. In the present context I shall attempt no more than the barest outlines but it will be enough to indicate something of its essentials. I shall confine myself to an elucidation of the five</page><page sequence="10">38 THEORIA characteristics of religion set forth earlier in this paper, but without detailed treatment. It should be clear that nothing is more natural than that cognitively finite beings should encounter the Umwelt as a mystérium transcendens or surpassing mystery; as having about it a dimension of irreducible and surpassing mystery, in being endlessly greater, more durable and powerful than they themselves. By the same token, the cosmos itself inevitably presses upon human consciousness a vivid sense of its dynamic nature, of the many forces at work in it and profoundly affecting us. Our sentient, vulnerable, dependent nature will oblige us to pay special attention to the powers of life itself, of birth, food supply, enemies and death. Nor is it at all strange, in view of the epistemological principles set forth earlier, that our distant forebears should have visualized those powers sub specie humanitatis , in the form and likeness of human beings, but much more imposing and powerful, or that they should have sought relationships with them that would encourage their favour and turn aside their wrath or ill will. Nothing could be more normal and natural than the advent, through an engagement of human creativity with the powers of an environing, largely mysterious cosmos, of a fundamentally personal world-view, of a cosmos in which invisible, conscious beings are believed to control the levers of power or well-being. In fact the use of anthropomorphism is especially likely in any attempt to comprehend the mysterious cosmos, precisely because direct identification is impossible and conjecture inevitable. And given the different faces of the Umwelt from place to place and time to time, it is just as inevitable that the resultant complex of mythology and ritual should be diverse rather than uniform, that Egyptians but not Eskimos should believe in and worship sun-gods, or the Southern San be persuaded that their deity loves the eland, a fondness not reported of the Zulu high god or of any other whose existence was not bound up with the antelope species of southern Africa. Finally, in view of the immense importance of the issues at stake here, namely our well-being and sense of meaning in life, it is scarcely surprising that people should exhibit the dedication and seriousness of purpose that characterize religious faith, with accompanying re-organizations of their lives to conform to the perceived will of the gods. * * * The full theory that I have evolved is very much more elaborate than this. But even the above selection of ideas from it should be quite enough to show why I feel constrained by the evidence and arguments at my disposal to formulate the following concluding hypothesis concerning religion on earth: that what we already know</page><page sequence="11">THE EXPLANATION OF RELIGION 39 about ourselves and our cosmos is sufficient to provide us with the explanation of religion in all its basic characteristics and forms. In human nature and the natural cosmos we can find enough in the way of causal factors with the necessary affinity, efficacy, scope and duration to engender the typical phenomena of religion in specified circumstances, though I have not here attempted to identify the latter. In short: the religious phenomena summarized in my five- part characterization will have evolved on this planet even if there are no supernatural entities of the kinds in which religionists believe. Such a hypothesis is not, of course, the same as an endorsement of materialism. In fact my approach shows that sophisticated, non-dogmatic forms of supernaturalism can claim as much (or as little) rational justification as their contraries. The ultimate mystery of being removes from the sphere of rational thought any final or certain verdict either way. This hypothesis has, of course, some extremely important implications of its own. The main ones, so far as I can see, are as follows. Religion, it would follow, is our creation, therefore it is freely criticizable. If defective, as all our other creations to some extent are, it can be changed or relinquished. Thus explanation creates scope for transformation, and a serious problem of much western thought hitherto would, it seems, at least be lessened: namely the separation of matters of fact from matters of values, of theory from praxis. We might even find in the explanation of religion the real presupposition of the criticism and transformation of society. University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg. REFERENCES W.H. Dray, 1957.
