<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GRAMMAR OF THE GITA- A VINDICATION BY B. N. KRISHNAMURTI S ARM A In the course of an article contributed by him to the Bhandarkar Commemoration Volume 1917, Prof. V. K Raj wade, a scholar of some repute, had unsparingly criticised the Bhagavad-Gltã, and opined that it could not be regarded as one of the best poems in the world. He also pointed it out to be full of grammatical absurdities and defects of diction and added that it " offends against the economy of words by most egregi- ously interspersing expletives like % tt^ e#, §, 33, f and ether meaningless singl# words plentifully and by using expressions that in no way add to or emphasise the meaning." ( p. 330. ), that " tho ' lavish of expletives the Gita does not mind lacu- nae" (p. 332), and that " we should expect the Gita to be honey- combed with purple passages if it were a poem and a poem worthy of being placed in the highest class of poetry." (p. 332). The whole criticism is directed from two standpoints, the aesthetic and the grammatical. The critic at the outset begins with an elaborate citation of the definitions of poetry given by prominent literary critics Indian as well as European. Mam- matta and Jagannãtha are cited. A host of English poets and literary critics are approvingly quoted : Puttenham, Dryden, Wordsworth, Coleridge, De Quincey, Hudson, Herbert Spencer, - in the light of whose theories of poetry and its foundations the art and diction of the Gita is pronounced to be poor and clumsy. Taking his stand upon the Sütras of Panini and Classical Sanskrit, the critic proceeds to show that the Gita "abounds in slovenly unclassical Sanskrit and mistakes of grammar. " The Gîta, as every body knows, is a part and an important part of the Mahãbhãrata. It shares the oddities of Epic style even as any other portion of the Epic. Indeed, the Epic period is recognised to be a distinctive epoch in the development of the Sanskrit language and the Rãmãyana and the Mahãbhãrata as works belonging to this period are far earlier in date of composition if not of final redaction than the Sütra Period. Pânini's Sutras do not affect the language of the Mahãbhãrata anymore than they do the language of the Vedas or Upaniaads*</page><page sequence="2">The Grammar of the Gîta- A Vindication 285 No one should therefore presume to iudge either from the vantage of Pãninian grammar. The rules of Panini do not and cannot apply to the Epic. It does not also apply to the Gïtâ which forms part of the Epic. I shall presently show that the Gïtâ does share the oddities of Epic style and that its language is closely akin to that of the Epic. It is even possible to point out parallel passages, lines and phrases, from all other portions of the Epic to those of the Gîta. The entire criticism becomes groundless when it is re- membered that no claim is or has ever been made on behalf of the Gita that it is the beau ideal of Sanskrit poetry ! Hindu tradition has not cared to attribute false perfection of any kind to it. The entire attitude which seeks to make it conform to classical definitions of Kãvya given from the latest works of Alamkära and requires the author of the Gltä-whoever he be, to embellish his verses with all the niceties of literary fiat is wrong lock stock and barrel. The author of the Gïtâ is no laureate writing to win a smile from patronising lips or winks of approbation and nods of assent from gullible admirers. He is in a word not a dilettante of poetry and the fine arts, but a moralist and a philosopher. His words are addressed to the earnest seeker who asks for the redeeming truth and not to him who asks for purple patches of poetry wherewith to amuse his leisure hours. Far from being claimed as one of the best poems of the world the Gita is always claimed to be and spoken of as an Upanisad' It is what it claims to be - a Yoga Sastra and an Upanisad. It is a gross pei version of facts and a misnomer to call it a Kãvya and then seriously proceed to adjudge its merits as one. The critic picks out grammatical mistakes which range from indiscriminate use of Ãtmanêpada and Parasmaipada in place of each other, absence of regular Samdhi and loose usage of case-endings to clumsy and intricate constructions and shifting of compounds. These errors of commission and omission are too trivial to be taken into account. Everything is explained when we remember that we are dealing with Epic and not Classical Sanskrit. One feature of Epic and Purãnic Sanskrit is that forms have not yet become stereotyped. Samdhi was a matter of convenience in poetry. Indiscriminate use of Parasmaipada</page><page sequence="3">m Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute and Ätmanepada is very common. But still there are other oases in which the padas are used scrupulously. In these and in many other particulars the Gita follows the Mahãbhãrata. Let us see how.

It is part and parcel of the Epic. It errs with the Epic and rises with it. The critic makes the greatest mistake when he utterly overlooks the indigenous commentaries on the Gïtâ which satisfactorily explain many of his 'puzzles.' He thinks that the author of the Gïtâ has used ïtïïï#ïïÎ for ïTS^rïïf ( ch. 18. 5 ) for 3Rjč^( 13. 11 ).* But this is clearly a misapprehension. The term *r%fr has been actually used in the text twice as also its synonyms and Î^rsTïï. Thus the author of the Gita speaks throughout of " wise men " as oppos- ed to mere " men." is said to be " careless Sanskrit." But a little consideration would show that it is not the mistake of the author of the Gitä. The prose-order and explanation as given by Rãghavendra Svãmin runs: - çRtgjb gřň sttčW. m- The critio has mis- read the words and played tricks with evidence. The use of expletives is not always without reason. Nor are they mere "stop-gaps " and " fillers" as the critic thinks. Our commentators have always drawn attention to the exple- tives and explained their force. Students of Indian Philosophy are well aware of the value of such expletives in Indian pole- mical literature. In the case of ( 3. 20 ) in which the critic wrongly renders as " preservation of Society," both the axpletives sriq and tt^ are necessary. In his own * The critic's reference is incorrect for ( 13. 12 ). Elsewhere therç are three more incorrect references.</page><page sequence="6">The Grammar of the Gitã-A Vindication 289 masterly way Rãghavèadra Svãmin explains them : - ŠPERPR?- 3CT?rí sfrati íí^KT^n^Hííi^i^: i i^RT^íçfêg ST% ' The critic patronisingly remarks, " It is doubtful if it has any meaning in čiř^Rifa: ( 2. 16 ) and in g 3Í|Kg ( 2. 17 )." The author of Bhãsyotkarsa-Dlpikã and Rãghavendra agree that g implies emphatic iteration : ¿H4'-WR: ISW=nW% l 3T1W% 3 I%rWr H The critic unnecessarily confuses the whole issue by introducing a fanci- ful distinction between a "popular and a philosophical notion." To say ( as he does ) that " in the popular view only one thing has an end while according to the philosophical view both have an end " and so on ( p. 330 ) is fantastic nonsense. The next complaint is that sometimes two words meaning the same thing are used to " fill up gaps. " It is a pity that he forgets that no two synonyms are ever exactly synony- mous. There is bound to be some slight shade of difference between the two. He points out that ^r| and 3fl%çï ( 4. 33 ), mé and ^ ( 12. 3 ), gp; čm, sní spreto ( 6-9 ) pairs meaning the same thing are used side by side " without any difference in sense being implied. " Here again his lack of acquaintance with Sanskrit commentaries is responsible for this hasty criticism. With regard to Samkara says STSfrpng Sfttw f%¡3 ^trs#ïïr%*5 (ânandagiri.)

" The difficulty again is due to sorupulous non- cooperation with original texts and commentaries. Samkara does not feel it hard to "construe and interpret" ! +i$i«i I Madhva finds it easier still : - %T% I fal% ( Jayatlrtha. ) 12</page><page sequence="7">290 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute " Sometimes the stop-gaps arid fillers spoil the sense as in STTfá ŠIFČŘH UTÈtìt ^ ( 3. 39 ) as though Fire would envelop but not burn knowledge I" ( p. 331 ). This is clearly disingenous. In the first place the word in the text does not mean Fire. It is too commonplace. As facetiously remarks : g I Samkara himself gives a different interpreta- tion : which gains ground under 3TO- ^Tïï. Vivrti runs : ^ çR fomite ^r^N^TR'ïïT I 3R&amp;T ?T T%fàs?5 gjfr rH I íf^T ''Prepositions are promiscuously used without any apparent alteration in meaning." Then follows a list of such forms. But it has to be suggested in reply that prepositional forms besides usually indicating different and varying shades of meanings are also used for the sake of style and in other cases are to be attributed to the idiosyncrasies of authors. Here again the critic's list of forms is only partially. correct. Thus indicates the buoyancy of Krsna and Arjuna as soon as they entered the field - 'a fact intended to be contrast- ed with the gloom of the opposite party. "In spite of the thundrous noise of the trumpets, blow of conches etc., from the enemy's ranks, Mãdhava and Arjuna blew their conches louder still not in the least disheartened or perturbed by the clamour of the opposite rank.''

U Samkara takes it tó mean 'srgf^fër. Another commentary remarks ( II</page><page sequence="8">The Grammar of the Gitar A Vindication 291 "sicsNte is the oppoiste of and not the same as ( 11-32)" (p 332. ) I I wonder what is the point after all in this sapient comment. If the critic means that it is misused he is sadly- mistaken. The reference here is not merely to one army but to both, orili atffà 3Rï ( Samkara ). Madhva writes - g i I f ČT 3ÏÏ5 ^nSFTOTSfq ( Jayatïrtha ) without a preposition tho' unusual is excusable on Epic grounds: Ů 1. 44. 32. The' omission of srfà after 3TRRïïfèR: and fègq: etc,, of stRt before can as well be supplied from the context and hence do not count as serious errors. On p. 335 the critic remarks " No one can trace the source of his ( Krsna's ) statement that the is the first of com- pounds. " Krsna however does not say it is the first but " best " of compounds and the reason is not far to seek : 3WR5PÏM: ( Madhusüdana Sarasvati. cf, also Bhattoji ) WAŠ in ' číIr ilt ' is deemed unnecessary because it would " make the Ätman an agent in company with certain other factors." But there is no need for such nervousness if we understand as constituting the very reason of the soul's inactivity. ( Samkara. ) But it remains to be seen whether the Gita is pledged to this theory of the soul's inactivity. All that the verse means to tell us is that the individual is not an absolu- tely free and independent agent. The trend of the Gita is far from supporting any theory of the inactivity of the soul . The verse in question simply warns us against arrogating to ourselves the initiative and conduct of affairs. Rãghavendra sums up the whole : &lt;T5T T%T fenfRïïRîîH WïïK *RTcí ' In either case the word is not with- out a purpose and significance and we shall leave it at that. Our critic is at a loss to understand how and why certain things mentioned in Chapter X as specially significant or best of their kind are really so ! But his ignorance only heightens his audacity and he burst forth into facetious humour: "Some no doubt are good and grand examples of divine greatness as the Himalayas, the ocean and the Ganges ; some splendid such as the Sun, the Moon; some powerful as the wind, the fire and the lion etc. But by which of these qualities shall we charac-</page><page sequence="9">292 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute terise the Sãma Veda, Brhaspati, Bhrgu and Narada? They are simply best of their kind !" ( p. 334 ). A reference to the commentaries at once clarifies the issue ! Just see: - qfÍR ^F^'ïïr ïïrW^TÎcTCïT^: wfàff (Nîlatantha, Madhu- sudana. ) ( Srïdhara. ) ( Madhusödana. ) The story of Bhrgu's mys- terious third eye in virtue of which he roamed about the three worlds to decide who was the best of the gods is current in the Padma-Purâna. The cause of his greatness is given in the text itself ^rr ^ 3THT$rci ( Šamkara, Srïdhara Madhusüdana ). ' and elude the critic. "What sort of greatness do these possess and what sort of pride or pleasure can Krsna or for the matter of that any one feel in calling himself 'gambling* which is simply a civilised form of filching ?" (p.335) ^ is not the dry disputation of two extinct volcanoes. Samkara brings out the innate dignity of Vada. I WT I ( Anandagiri and Madhusùdana. ) The critic makes a colossal mistake when he thinks that the so many things referred to by Krsna are In fact his own alter-egos or that any identification between them is meant! The aim of Krsna's illustrations is to impress upon Arjuna the fact that He is the Ruler of All, who empowers the mightiest and sustains tha weakest. His hand is felt not merely in things great and good but in things small or repellent ( 3^- ^TT ). But nothing is repellent to him. He is equal- ly present in all : in the learned Brahman, the elephant, the cow, the dog and the Candäla. In fact he is in all - high and low, great and small, good and bad. The warrior's might is due to Him and the gambler's cunning is due to Him. Nothing exists then which is not ultimately deiived from Him and which does not in ever so small or great a degree call up his prowess and presence. There is nothing inherently shocking if the Gita fearlessly attributes gambling as an art to the divine presence. The Lord himself is going to speak of him- self as the merciless slayer of all men. It is, however, a false notion that God resides only in good things. He lives in Heaven and Hell, suffers the play of good and evil but is not in turn affected by them. ( í| ^ I ) In fact standards</page><page sequence="10">The Grammar of the Gitã-A Vindication S93 of anthropomorphism do not apply to Him. In his lectures on the Gïtâ, Babu Aurobindo Qhose clearly brings out the thoroughness of the Hindu conception of God. The critic further deplores that '¿ft etc. are considered best among women because they happen to be feminine in speech. But the heroines and noble ladies of our Epics-a mere utterance of whose names soon after waking in the early morning is deemed auspicious (as if the critic does believe in such rank superstition. )- Sita, Tãrã, Anasüyä, Mandõdari, Sâvitrï, Damayantl and Tãrãmatí of blessed memory.... SarasvatI the goddess of speech have all been forgotten " ( p.334 ). A reference to the commentaries again clarifies the issue. Madhusüdana explains : ^ ílfàíNr ç#[- 3řw#&gt;n =rraí 3m: The " noble ladies " are not forgotten. 1 According to another view the seven terms respectively denote seven ladies each famous in a particular respect. Elsewhere he remarks, " It is doubtful whether biffili: in sTKI'Wffi ( 17. 23 ) refers to the caste or the Brähmana portion of the Vedas. In the latter case it ought to be s(l4JIJllfa. If it were the caste there is no reason why it should precede the Vedas and sacrifices " ( p. 327 ). But the commentators are sure that only the caste is meant. And the critie's puzzle why it should precede the Vedas and sacrifices is thus clearly explained by Madhusüdana. mfíTT I aiï^imr: ^T: sRITfà W- 1 is not wrong as is made out.

For an intel- ligible construction we have to alter the forms of certain wcrds as well as supply certain links " ( p. 328. ) But the verse is sufficiently intelligible as it is. Nilakantha has a very simple and catching interpretation. f| IWctoMRÍ řtRíl 5T|iï ^;ï% I The Vi vrti suggests a more definite and direct con- struction. Some more verses are pronounced to be clumsy in a footnote. But a reference to any recognised commentary would set at nought all doubts and difficulties. Intricacy there is none to speak of. Mr. Gandhi once declared the language of the Gîta to be " incredibly simple. " The critic declares that srft $1504 ( 4. 17 ) really means ^ ft But this is a needless emendation. He will do well to understand after every one of the three genitives. Samkara actually adopts the same procedure. I Nilakantha and Srïdhara suggest a similar procedure. Räghavendra offers a different solution. ( Then comes a sententious remark. " It is rather strange that Krsna, Arjuna and Vyäsa so intimately connected with the story of the Mahãbhãrata and the Gita should be men- tioned as the best of their clans, family or cías?. Can they be so detached from self and so impartial as to look upon them- selves in that light? " ( p. 335 ) This is simply a mischiev- ous stunt the only fitting answer to which is given by Sri Krsna himself in 7. 19, 24, 25. " Another source of filling out is a host of vocatives 99 ( p. 331. ) In the first place it should be remembered that the use of vocatives is a very common feature of Epic style. The Mahãbhãrata, the Rãmãyana and the Purãnãs abound in voca- tives. This should not be condemned as unnatural because primitive poetry has an irrepressible tendency toward vocative address. There is nothing incompatible therefore if the Gitä too is given to the use of vocatives in a large measure. It is a defect ( if you please ) which it shares in common with the rest of the Epic. But not all of them cm be declared to be meaningless. Most of them are quite contestual and signi- ficant. They contain so many hidden allusions, and sly hits. The great commentators do not notice the vocatives. 5[ ^Tct I The Bhâsyotkarsa</page><page sequence="12">The Grammar of the Gita~A Vindication 295 -Dîpikâ a commentary of the Advaita school makes a consist- ent and almost astonishing attempt to explain the import of everyone of the vocatives occurring throughout the Gita. The success with which the feat; is carried out is simply pheno- menal. No other commentary so far as I am aware has at- tempted anything like it with such wonderful capacity and ingenuity, The critic's list of some twenty-four vocatives in all ( said to be meaningless ) vanishes into nothingness before the myriads of instances selected and commented upon by the author of the Bhäsyotkarsa-Dipikä. Madhusüdana Sarasvati also notices some vocatives and explains their significance. I have taken great pains to determine the variety and fre- quency of such vocatives and trace out the explanations there- on offered by the author of Bhäsyotkarsa-Dipikä] in particular and other commentators in general. 1-36.

An approach to rhyme is almost in evidence in the series irò fiten (XII-14-17), which recalls the famous čt^T JTRRÍ series in Ädiparva or the equally memorable in which the same refrain is kept up throughout a whole chapter ( Udyoga parva 46. ) An earnest scholar may as well collect together many stanzas with an aphoristic flavor.

" A philosophical poem is a misnomer if the philosophy is not allegorised. The Gita has not the slightest pretensions to allegory " (p. 332 ). This is entirely wrong. Ignorance of the nature of the contents of the Gita cannot go further. Our ancient commentators have clearly drawn attention to many allegories in the Gita and even third rate modern writers and booksellers of the Gita wax eloquent over the profound allegories of the Gita and dwell upon the mysterious divisions of the Mahäbhärata into eighteen books, the dura- tion of the fight for eighteen days and of the division of 13</page><page sequence="15">298 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute the Gita into eighteen chapters.

M. &amp; S. in his, "Bhagavad Gita- A Psycho- Analysis " (Tarporewala &amp; Sons, Hornby Road, Bombay ), has endeavoured to show that the Gita besides embodying the theory and practice of psychology indicates the method of analysing, synthesising and re-educating different phases of the mind of an individual on the border- land of mental derangement. Arjuna on the eve of the battle grew definitely psychotic. Krsna was an expert psycho-analyst and he subjected him to a process of psycho-analysis and pointed out that his doubts and difficulties, moral misgivings and mental musings were all due to a proper lack of harmony. Krsna sets to work to restore that harmony. Elsewhere Mr. Rele repre- sents the human nervous system as the famous Asvattha tree. Whatever may be said of Rele's theories, XV Chapter, dealing with the Asvattha tree turned topsy turvy is an alle- gory. Madhusüdana says : "í^IFfTŤfi íWRWF^WfT spfara II The conception of the World- Cycle (^pt^B ) in the III Adhyãya which for sometime even Mr. Gandhi was trying to identify with his national panacea of the spinning wheel (charkha).is an allegory far ahead of any -Miltonic, Shakespearean or Kalidasian ! Elsewhere the critic remarks, "the way in which the artist deals with these topios would show his mettle. Even Kãlidãsa, Bhavabhüti, Bãn»,</page><page sequence="16">The Grammar of the Gita- A Vindication ' 299 Shakespeare, Milton or Shelley would have been on ¡their trial and yet there is no doubt that they would have acquitted them- selves worthily." ( p. 333.) Indian poets have never claimed precedence over the authors of the Rãmãyana and the Mahã- bhãrata. They have all recognised their unchallengeable superiority. Bãna himself bows down to Vyãsa in an intro- ductory verse of the Harsacarita. It is mischievously out of place to pit against each other the author of the Gitã and Milton, Shelley or Shakespeare. They are not in pari materia. They have no common ground. Lastly, the chapter of the Universal "Vision in which is seen the whole Cosmos, the fight of the Kurufesëtra, the ßight of the armies being devoured by the awful jaws of the Great One is an allegory akin to, the one presented in the Purusa Sùkta with an immediate coloring. The essence of that allegory notwithstanding disorderly groupings which the critic points out, is contained in two verses which emphasise the highest doctrine of the Gïtâ-the Immanence of God in all things, that He is the sole Ruler and [the One Independent Reality, that the whole scheme of organic and inorganic life derives its support from Him. sqtoffàrfàr fi i ht i i%T ifi TO II This grand truth of things is the peculiar pride of the Gitã. No world-poet save the author of the Gitã has ever declared so solemn a truth in so impressive a manner. Not Kãlidãsa» not Bhavabhüti not Shakespeare not Shelley not e ?en Milton has approached to anything like a glimpse of it. And as against this a mendacious list of misused words, misplaced compounds, irregular forms, archaisms, absence of samdhi etc., weighs nowhere. The author of the Gita himself is not likely to be perturbed by such puerilities. His is the vantage of an overflowing philosophical lay the burden of which would run : - " " ( IL 46 ) And this is bound to be the motto of his countless followers still in the land of Bhãrata Varsa.</page></plain_text>
