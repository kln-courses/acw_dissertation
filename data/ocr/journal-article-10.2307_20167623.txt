<plain_text><page sequence="1">Demystifying the late preclassic Izapan-style stela-altar "cult" JULIA GUERNSEY KAPPELMAN Introduction Izapa is situated on the slope above the Pacific coastal plain of modern Chiapas, Mexico, in a region known as the Soconusco (fig. 1). During the Late Preclassic period (300 b.c-a.d. 200), this Soconusco region represented a corridor of communication between Mixe-Zoquean speakers to the west, and Mayan to the east. The site of Izapa, strategically located at the heart of this cultural crossroads, is defined by large plazas bound by pyramidal mounds that contained elaborate sculptural programs. The carved monuments of Izapa typify a unique, Late Preclassic sculptural florescence that is commonly referred to as the "Izapan style," and which is characterized by dense, figurai compositions contained within the fluid contours of low-relief carved stelae and altars.1 The term "Izapan-style," which has been a convention in the literature since Stirling's (1943) visit to Izapa, also applies to contemporaneous stone carvings from sites located throughout the Highlands and coastal piedmont of Chiapas and Guatemala, along the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and in the valleys of central Veracruz. Sites possessing Izapan-style monuments include, among others, Kaminaljuyu and Abaj Takalik in Guatemala, and La Mojarra in Veracruz, Mexico. Although consistently grouped under the rubric "Izapan style," the monuments from these various sites display a range of formal variation that includes differences in carving style, execution of line and relief planes, and compositional organization (Parsons 1967, 1986; Prater 1989; Smith 1984). In fact, the term inaccurately suggests a static point of origin for the Izapan style and its broad manifestation, which is better understood as the result of a dynamic, Late Preclassic interaction sphere in which formal vocabularies and stylistic canons were shared and modified by participating sites. Further complicating an understanding of the Izapan style phenomenon is the obvious iconographie debt to earlier Olmec art and a continuity with the narratives and symbolic repertoire of later Classic Maya works. Accordingly, numerous scholars characterized Izapan style monuments as formal and iconographie intermediaries between Olmec art and that of the Classic Maya.2 In doing so, many neglected discussion of their unique vocabulary and syntax of iconographie forms that testify to their participation in a pan-regional Late Preclassic communication nexus. The path of discussion taken here, in which the content and context of several carved monuments at the site of Izapa and their relationship to monuments from other sites is analyzed, represents one possible means of attempting to better understand the nature of this Izapan-style phenomenon. The monuments that punctuate the plaza spaces at Izapa are typically stela-altar combinations that pair erect, carved stone stelae with low, carved stone altars (see Lowe et al. 1982: figs. 2.7, 6.7).3 In fact, the site of Izapa has been credited with the origin of the stela-altar cult, a term which refers to this convention of arranging monuments. However, the convention of stela-altar pairs has not been carefully considered as an overtly political device within the creation of a sacred landscape during the Late Preclassic period. The pairing of carved stelae with zoomorphic altars, in particular, appears to have functioned as a powerful tool for expressing?in sculptural form?the performative aspects of rulership. As will be discussed, the juxtaposition of stela and altar?in which the stela appeared to literally emerge from the altar below it? 1. A version of this paper was presented as part of the University of Texas Department of Art and Art History Faculty Lecture Series in the fall of 2001, and I wish to thank my colleagues in the department for their encouragement and constructive comments. I am particularly grateful to Marion Popenoe de Hatch and Christa Schieber de Lavarreda for their crucial assistance and permission to incorporate the Abaj Takalik material, as well as Fred Bove, who facilitated communications throughout the process. Thanks also go to John Clark, for permission to use the new drawings of the Izapa monuments, to Terry Kaufman for his linguistic advice, to Mike McBride for his suggestions, to Francesco Pellizzi and two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments, and to Nuit Banai, Assistant Editor, for her editorial suggestions. All errors, in spite of this generous help, are, of course, my own. 2. See, for example, Proskouriakoff (1950, 1968, 1971), Covarrubias (1957), Coe (1962, 1965), Kubier (1962), Parsons (1967), Bernai (1969), Norman (1976). Others, such as Quirarte (1973, 1976, 1977), Lowe et al. (1982), and Smith (1984), questioned this characterization. 3. Although this study only considers carved stelae and altars, it is important to note that plain, uncarved stelae and altars comprise a considerable percentage of the sculptural assemblages at most sites, including Izapa, during the Late Preclassic period. As Parsons (1986:63-64) asserted, there is some evidence that Late Preclassic uncarved stelae may have been painted at one time in the distant past.</page><page sequence="2">100 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Pacific Ocean ^^^^r ^^^^^^^^^^^^H Aba^HmjmH Figure 1. Map of Mexico and Guatemala showing locations of sites mentioned in text. created a dynamic sculptural tableau in which ritual was made permanently visible on the stage of the sacred landscape.4 Indeed, the paired stela-altar format represents a conceptually unified ideological vehicle that was used to transmit powerful messages concerning Late Preclassic rulership and the nature of its performance.5 In order to pursue these notions, I begin with a brief summary of the stela-altar tradition at Izapa, continue with a more detailed examination of the recurring motif of bird-costumed performers on Late Preclassic Izapan-style stelae, and conclude with a discussion of associated altars and their possible significance at the site of Izapa. The emergence of the stela-altar tradition at Izapa The stela-altar format made its first appearance at Izapa during the Middle to Late Preclassic transition (Lowe et al. 1982). Izapa Miscellaneous Monument 2 (see Norman 1973: plate 64) appears to represent an evolving stela form that developed out of the niche figure tradition that characterized Olmec monuments like San Lorenzo Monument 14, La Venta Stela 1, and La Venta Altar 4.6 Other sculptures at Izapa, such as Stela 4 (fig. 2a), are much less three-dimensionally rendered, yet retain their irregular contours and are carved only on a single side. As Clancy (1990) observed, Late Preclassic stelae may be derived from Middle Preclassic boulder monuments, such as La Venta Stela 2 or Stone 1 from Pijijiapan, Chiapas, which contained multi-figured, narrative scenes. However, what develops most fully at Izapa is the framing device, generally in the form of basal and celestial bands, which defines and delimits the narrative imagery of the stelae (fig. 2a) (cf. Miles 1965; Quirarte 1976). These framing bands also occur with frequency on Late Preclassic monuments found throughout the Izapan-style communication sphere, from El Baul, Guatemala, to La Mojarra, Veracruz. On a very basic level, these bands denoted where the imagery began and where it ended. On a more connotative level, they differentiated between simple rock surface and sacred space, and framed an inviolable location that was defined as separate from the viewer's space.7 Furthermore, as Clancy (1990) observed, the framed fields were ideally suited to the presentation and visual accessibility of complex narrative imagery on a single plane. The stelae were thus a potent medium 4. Stuart's (1996) discussion of stelae as "'participants' in ancient Maya ritual and historical narrative" provides the conceptual basis for this exploration of Late Preclassic sculptural assemblages. 5. See Guernsey (1995) and Kappelman (1997, 2001). 6. While Ekholm (1969:100) and Parsons (1986:19) suggested that Miscellaneous Monument 2 dated to the late Middle Preclassic period (c. 700-500 b.c.), Lowe et al. (1982:196-199) offered a date between 500 and 250 b.c. based on the archaeological context of the monument in Group B in front of Mound 30i. 7.

The placement of these stelae in ceremonial centers further evidenced, as Reilly (1994) noted for the Middle Preclassic, the adoption and manipulation of the stela format by the elite. As he observed, the stela format was an effective and essential tool for creating a permanent record not only of a ruler's ritual performances, but also the political and cosmological ideologies that underpinned his authority. Moreover, as its florescence throughout the expansive late Middle Preclassic Olmec and Late Preclassic Izapan-style regions suggests, the stela format may have arisen, at least in part, as the propagandiste tool and response of early states to the external pressures and culturally diverse communication and trade networks that were in place across Mesoamerica by at least 600 B.c. The predominance of low-relief carved Izapan-style stelae at Izapa, Abaj Takalik, El Baul, and Kaminaljuyu, for instance, can thus be understood as symptomatic of the amalgamation and centralization of power at selected Late Preclassic sites (Parsons 1988:7). What, then, was the message of these ideologically charged Late Preclassic stelae at Izapa? Avian transformation imagery One of the central motifs of the corpus of stelae from Izapa is the winged flying figure. On Izapa Stela 4 (fig. 2a), two winged figures appear, one firmly planted on the basal band, and the other hovering head down in the air above. The lower figure carries an axe-like object in his left hand and another object in his right. From his forearms dangle long feathers attached with a large knot to his wrists. He also wears a long-beaked headdress that is distinctly bird-like. The upper figure descends from the celestial band, wings spread in flight, wearing a beaked headdress very similar to that of the individual below. Likewise on Izapa Stelae 60 (fig. 3), a figure whose wings are outspread kneels in profile along a</page><page sequence="5">Kappelman: Demystifying the Late Preclassic Izapan-style stela-altar "cult" 103 basal band.8 Close examination of all three of these winged figures reveals that they are clearly human beings, with anthropomorphic torsos and legs, garbed in elaborate bird costumes. As will be discussed, they are depictions?or ritual moments rendered in stone?of Izapan rulers participating in performances that were memorialized in the form of a monumental sculptural program. There are obvious Middle Preclassic precedents for the depiction of rulers in bird costumes. For example, scholars (Grove 1970; Grove and Gillespie 1992; Reilly 1994) have discussed the imagery of Oxtotitl?n Mural 1 and La Venta Altar 4 as scenes of ritual transformation in which a ruler engaged in a journey to the cosmic realm. Painted on the cliff face above a cave in Guerrero, Mexico, Oxtotitl?n Mural 1 depicts a ruler in-an elaborate bird costume seated upon a zoomorphic throne (fig. 4a). As Grove (1970) observed, during the rainy season the cave beneath the painting overflowed with water that cascaded into the fields below. When considered contextual ly, the composition portrayed the ruler as the individual who controlled not only access to the supernatural realm?symbolized by the cave?but to the source of agricultural fertility. Although the ruler on Oxtotitl?n Mural 1 wears an avian mask, the profile of his face is still visible beneath it. As Reilly (1994) noted, the transparency of the mask allowed the ruler beneath to be seen so that the image could be understood as that of a human garbed as a bird rather than a zoomorphic supernatural. An avian headdress is also worn by the ruler on La Venta Altar 4 (fig. 4b) (Grove 1973). With the ruler seated inside a portal and the enormous maw above him symbolizing his zoomorphic throne, La Venta Altar 4 represents a Middle Preclassic cosmogram that envisioned a ruler's transformation and supernatural journey (Reilly 1994). Thus during the Middle Preclassic, the ideological complex of transformation provided one of the conceptual foundations for rulership, and was expressed through a variety of forms that included avian costuming, thrones, and cosmic portals. To return to the Late Preclassic, it is important to note that there is archaeological evidence for bird costuming during this period. The Tomb II Late Preclassic royal burial in Kaminaljuyu Mound E-lll-3 included a mask that had been assembled from thirty-one greenstone pieces that were attached to an organic backing of some sort (fig. 5) (Shook and Kidder 1952:115). It had apparently fallen from a litter that held the skeleton of the principal occupant of the tomb, probably a ruler.9 The mask contains a prominent, hooked beak element at its base. Also associated with the burial was an assemblage of four quartz crystal fragments, six porcupine fish teeth, and a pair of biconcave bone objects that constituted the remains of a bundle or pouch of perishable material.10 Such objects imply a context of supernatural communication, as they recall both modern Yucatecan shamans use of clear "stones of light" for their divination rituals (Freidel et al. 1993:126), and Bishop Diego de Landa's Conquest-period description of shamans' implements carried in bundles: ... the physicians and sorcerers assembled in one of their houses. . . they opened the bundles of their medicine, in which they kept many little trifles... as well as some small stones, called am, of the kind which they used for casting lots (Tozzer 1941:154). The implements of Tomb II together with the decidedly avian hooked beak mask suggest that the entire assemblage may have been utilized during conjuring rituals or performances of supernatural contact in which an individual was costumed as a bird. The imagery of Late Preclassic Kaminaljuyu Stela 11 (fig. 2b), in which a ruler communes with a winged deity above him, appears to corroborate this.11 On this monument the individual wears a bird mask that contains a hooked beak and curling eyebrow elements that compare to those of the mask from the Tomb II burial. The image also confirms that such richly fashioned masks were not solely burial costumes, but actually were worn by rulers during ritual spectacles. Moreover, Stela 11 suggests that, as during the Middle Preclassic, demonstration of the ruler's ability to communicate with the supernatural was central to the display and legitimation of rulership, and one of the primary metaphors for expressing this communication was flight. Imagery like that of Stela 11 was not merely a 8. The original context of Izapa Stela 60 is unknown; it was removed from its original location anciently and relocated to Group F, a later ceremonial precinct at the site that dates to the Early Classic period (Lowe et al. 1982:225-231). 9. See Shook and Kidder (1952:64-65). Shook and Hatch (1999:304) suggested that the primary occupant of this tomb was a ruler; also see Vald?s and Rodriguez (1999:145). 10. See Shook and Kidder (1952:117-118; fig. 15, nos. 154-156). 11. Kaminaljuyu Stela 11 was discovered by Edwin Shook beneath a floor in the level terrain between Mounds D-lll-10 and D-IV-2 where it could be dated securely to the Late Formative period (Coe 1965:772; Miles 1965:255; Parsons 1986:65-66).</page><page sequence="6">104 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Figure 4. a.

It was visual testimony to an important ideological foundation for ancient Mesoamerica rulership, which rested on a ruler's ability to communicate with the supernatural realm. Similar ideological foundations for rulership characterized Classic Maya kingship, which was also grounded, in part, on the manifestation of supernatural power as the basis for political control.12 Throughout the corpus of Classic Maya art, kings communicate with the Otherworld and conjure supernatural beings that emerge through vision serpents; the king was literally the conduit through which communication with the spiritual world occurred. Also critical to the success of Classic Maya rulership, as well as that of the Middle and Late Preclassic periods, was the charismatic nature of the ruler. A ruler not only needed to engage and hold the 12. See, for instance, Demarest (1992), Freidel and Schele (1988), Freidel et al.

To illustrate, on Izapa Stela 4 (fig. 2a) a figure stands on a basal band whose form corresponds exactly to the epi-Olmec na glyph that functions iconically as "earth."14 The basal band thus Figure 6. Abaj Takalik Altar 30. Field sketch by Ayax Moreno, courtesy of the New World Archaeological Foundation and the Proyecto Abaj Takalik. functions as a marker of the earthly realm and contrasts with the horizontal band at the top of the stela, which corresponds to a well-established Preclassic tradition of celestial iconography.15 The figure's stance, anchored to the terrestrial band, and his dynamic pose suggest some sort of performance in the earthly realm. His costume, which consists of an elaborate beaked headdress and numerous dangling feathers, compares closely to that of the Principal Bird Deity. This avian deity was a mythological denizen of the supernatural realm who played an important role in the Maya creation story and who is associated throughout the Classic period with magic and rulership.16 Importantly, the second figure on the stela, who descends from the celestial band, wears an almost identical costume. Yet this inverted figure bears both anthropomorphic and avian traits: while his 13. Models such as these, which explore supernatural communication as one important ideological foundation for rulership in Precolumbian Mesoamerica, have come under attack recently. For example, Klein et al. (2002) argued that such theories denied the existence of other bases for political power, such as economic control of trade and exchange. Quite to the contrary, these models and the one offered here willingly acknowledge that ancient Mesoamerican rulership was predicated upon an intimate web of economic, political, ideological, and social forces. Nonetheless, in many cases, as at Late Preclassic Izapa, the imagery particularly invites exploration of the more conceptual foundations of Late Preclassic rulership, especially the depictions of performances of supernatural communication, which served to publicly assert and validate a multifaceted voice of authority. 14. For a discussion of this interpretation, see Anderson (1993), Justeson and Kaufman (1993), and Stross and Reilly (1991). 15. For analyses of this celestial band and its appearance in Middle and Late Preclassic iconography see Coe (1977), Kappelman and Reilly (2001:40-41), Norman (1976:23), Reilly (1995), and Taube (1995:91). 16. Bardawil (1976) first coined the term "Principal Bird Deity" to distinguish this particular bird from the plethora of avians in Maya art. He identified the Preclassic prototype for the Classic-period avian deity at the site of Izapa and noted its significance in the display of rulership (cf. Schele 1974). Cortez (1986) also examined the Principal Bird Deity in Preclassic and Early Classic Maya art, while Kappelman (1997; n.d.) focused on representations of the bird in Late Preclassic Izapan-style imagery; a summary of the lengthy research surrounding the Principal Bird Deity is also included here. See Freidel et al. (1993) for an analysis of the bird's iconography and symbolic significance during the Classic Maya period, and Tedlock (1985) for a discussion of the bird's mythological role in the K'iche' Maya Popol Vuh creation saga.</page><page sequence="8">106 RES 45 SPRING 2004 face and torso are distinctly human, his toes curl into talons. Based on the organization of the picture plane and its distinctly narrative imagery, it seems reasonable to suggest that Izapa Stela 4 represents a scene of ritual transformation expressed as a simultaneous vision: below, the ruler performs in the costume of the Principal Bird Deity in the earthly realm, while above he is envisioned as the transformed avian deity engaged in a cosmic flight. Late Preclassic Kaminaljuyu Stela 11 (fig. 2b) bears striking affinities with Izapa Stela 4. Here, however, it is actually the Principal Bird Deity that hovers above the ruler, its curved beak pointing downward and wings spread out to either side as if sanctioning the presence of the ruler below (Cortez 1986:95; cf. Parsons 1983:154). The ruler is also wearing the costume of the avian deity, replete with curved beak. In contrast to Izapa Stela 4, the imagery of Kaminaljuyu Stela 11 is much more iconic; the ruler is not portrayed in the dynamic pose of his counterpart on Stela 4. It is not an image of active transformation in which the ruler appears in both his human and transformed state. Instead, Kaminaljuyu Stela 11 appears to subtly allude to the ruler's inherent capacity to transform into the avian deity and communicate with the supernatural realm in the persona of the bird. Izapa Stela 60 (fig. 3) provides another piece to this narrative puzzle. A composite human-bird figure, which compares closely to the individual at the top of Izapa Stela 4, kneels below while above him two other figures appear to interact with each other.17 Importantly, marking the base of the composition is a band that recalls the celestial framing device on Izapa Stela 4. This inversion of the celestial band?placed beneath the scene on Stela 60?denotes a celestial rather than terrestrial context. Based on this, the celestial scene may represent a supernatural one, in which the ruler has transformed into the bird and undertaken a cosmic journey. It may thus provide a counterpart to Stela 4: while Stela 4 depicts the transformation of the ruler in the earthly realm, Stela 60 documents his flight into the celestial realm of the Otherworld. Another composite individual who possesses both avian and human characteristics and is dressed in the costume of the Principal Bird Deity with arms raised as if in dance or performance appears on recently discovered Abaj Takalik Altar 30 (also known as the "Santa Margarita Throne") (Vinicio Garcia 1997:169) (fig. 6). Based on its composition and form, Christa Schieber de Lavarreda (personal communication via Marion Popenoe de Hatch, 2002) suggested that the monument, which dates stylistically to the Late Preclassic period, had originally been a stela (cf. Orrego and Schieber 2001:923). At some point in the ancient past it was modified into a throne (with legs) and then ultimately set into the steps of the access to Terrace 3, in the southern part of the Central Group at Abaj Takalik. Although it is difficult to date with any exactitude the period during which the monument was used as a throne, the conceptual relationship between the performance of this avian transformation and the office of rulership, expressed through the vehicle of the throne, is undoubtedly significant. In fact, it is tempting to consider the possibility that a bird-costumed Abaj Takalik ruler actually occupied this throne for publicly staged demonstrations of his power both in this world and the other during the Late Preclassic period.18 This avian imagery was not limited during the Late Preclassic period to southeastern Mesoamerica, but also appears in the Gulf Coast region, recalling earlier Middle Formative traditions at La Venta and Oxtotitl?n. La Mojarra Stela 1 (fig. 7) depicts a ruler garbed in an elaborate bird costume that consists of a beaked headdress much like those worn by the figures on the monuments from Izapa and Kaminaljuyu; it appears to represent the Veracruz equivalent of the avian deity costume.19 This identification of the costume as that of the avian deity is substantiated by the object that floats in front of the figure's face (fig. 8a), and which corresponds to the article clasped in his hands. A very 17. The top figure at the left of the composition wears celts strapped to his shins, a Late Preclassic convention that, according to Taube (1996:50), anticipates the mirrors or "god-markings" worn by Classic Maya deities as symbols of their divine nature. 18. The side of Abaj Takalik Stela 5, which carries a Long Count date that corresponds to the year a.d. 125 (John Justeson, personal communication 2002), depicts a throne that compares to Abaj Takalik Altar 30. Likewise, as Kaplan (1995) observed, similar thrones that date to the Late Preclassic period have been found at Izapa and Kaminaljuyu. It is also worth noting with regards to Abaj Takalik Altar 30 that the relationship between the avian-costumed individual and the form of the throne itself compares to a scene on an Early Classic (Aztan phase) mosaic-decorated plaque from the site of Zaculeu, Guatemala (Woodbury and Trik 1953:fig. 131). The plaque depicts an enthroned ruler with an anthropomorphic torso, legs, and hands, who wears the personified wings and floral headdress associated with the Principal Bird Deity. This imagery of an enthroned, avian-costumed ruler also recalls Middle Preclassic Oxtotitl?n Mural 1 (Grove 1970; Reilly 1995:40). 19. La Mojarra Stela 1, which dates to approximately a.d. 156, was found in the Acula River midway between Cerro de las Mesas and Tres Zapotes in Veracruz.</page><page sequence="9">Kappelman: Demystifying the Late Preclassic Izapan-style stela-altar "cult" 107 Figure 7.

After Robertson (1985:fig. 30). similar cartouche appears on the back of the head of a three-dimensional sculpture of the Principal Bird Deity from the site of Palo Gordo, in Suchitepequez, along the Pacific Coast (fig. 8b). The motif also appears on the back of an Early Classic Maya version of the Principal Bird Deity perched on a double cylinder vase (fig. 8c). The similarity of these cartouches, and their consistent association with the Principal Bird Deity, lends support to the suggestion that the protagonist on La Mojarra Stela 1 is dressed in the bird's costume. The motif also compares to floral forms depicted on the Early Classic Delataille vessel (fig. 8d) and on House E at Palenque (fig. 8e). As Houston and Taube (2000) recently demonstrated, there is a very close association between breath, souls, and flowers in Mesoamerican art, which may explain the positioning of the cartouche in front of the La Mojarra ruler's face, as if a symbol for breath.20 Houston and Taube (?bid.:271) also noted a belief among several Mesoamerican groups in a supernatural floral realm. Such associations between floral forms and supernatural locales match well with the mythological role of the Principal Bird Deity as a denizen of the Otherworld. Beyond these iconographie parallels, the lengthy hieroglyphic inscription on La Mojarra Stela 1 may also provide insight into the significance of Late Formative avian transformation rituals.21 For example, scholars (Anderson 1993; Kaufman, personal communication 1995) noted that the wings of the flying figures on Izapa Stelae 4 and 60 were tagged with hieroglyphic elements that resemble a glyph in the epi-Olmec script on La Mojarra Stela 1 that has been read as 'owa, or "macaw," by Justeson and Kaufman (fig. 9) (1993, 1996; Kaufman and Justeson 2001). Based on this relationship, the 20. Also see Kappelman (1997:159-169) for an analysis of the formal relationship between these floral forms and mirrors, especially as they relate to the iconography of the Principal Bird Deity. 21. The epi-Olmec script tradition on La Mojarra Stela 1 flourished in the Olmec heartland between c. 150 b.c. and a.d. 450, and is referred to as epi-Olmec because the archaeological culture descended from the earlier (1200 to 300 B.c.) Olmec culture Gusteson and Kaufman 1993:1 703). The pre-proto-Zoquean language of La Mojarra Stela 1 is also the ancestor of modern languages spoken in Veracruz, Tabasco, Chiapas, and Oaxaca, Mexico.</page><page sequence="11">Kappelman: Demystifying the Late Preclassic Izapan-style stela-altar "cult" 109 Figure 9.

Drawing by the author. costumes of the figures on Izapa Stelae 4 and 60 may have been deliberately labeled as "macaws."22 This tentative macaw identification correlates with the suggestion that the costumes represent that of the Principal Bird Deity, who appears to have been the Classic period counterpart to the deity known as Seven Macaw in the K'iche' Maya Popol Vuh creation story.23 As translated by Justeson and Kaufman, the lengthy text of La Mojarra Stela 1 describes, among other things, a series of ritual activities and battles associated with astronomical events and calendrical anniversaries, provides an elaborate account of an accession ceremony and, most importantly to this discussion, narrates a ruler's charismatic performance and "taken/received" [6^j ?ma^onr?

This information raises an obvious, and intriguing, question: Could there be a correlation between the imagery of the Izapa monuments and the narrative of La Mojarra Stela 1 ? One passage in the inscription of La Mojarra Stela 1 describes a ritual in which certain objects were "taken" by the ruler "in plain sight" or, by extension, "in public" (Kaufman and Justeson 2001:51 ). The inclusion of the modifier ken-e, "seen, visible, in plain sight," suggests that this ritual was part of a staged, public performance. Significantly, one of the objects taken by the ruler during this public spectacle was a "macaw lashing" (ibid.:50). This macaw "lashing" or bundle on La Mojarra Stela 1 is described with a glyph that compares closely to that on the wings of the flying figures at Izapa (fig. 10a). The text thus implies that an important part of a ceremony at La Mojarra involved the presentation of a macaw bundle to the ruler, and the acceptance of this macaw bundle was central to the public display of rulership. Fortunately, the significance of the expression "taking the macaw bundle" is clarified later in the narrative of La Mojarra Stela 1 when it states that the ruler was "bedecked as a macaw," owa wu-tzuk (Kaufman and 22. The glyph-like element on the wings of the flying figures at Izapa takes several different forms, and appears to have some variable components, as can be seen by comparing those that appear on Stelae 4 and 60 to similar versions on the wings of the figure on Stela 25. Slight variations of the sign in the text of La Mojarra Stela 1 that Justeson and Kaufman read phonetically as 'owa (macaw) also occur (see Kaufman and Justeson 2001:7, 50, and 60). Despite the variability in these signs at Izapa and their resemblance to the ubiquitous crossed-band motif that typically carries celestial associations during both the Formative and Classic periods (Coe 1965, 1977; Taube 1987:2), it is at least worth considering the suggestion that they may have specifically signified "macaw" in this context. 23. There is a long history for this identification of the Classic Maya Principal Bird Deity as the antecedent to Seven Macaw of the Popol Vuh. For a summary, see Kappelman (1997:1 7-19). Although recently Bassie-Sweet (n.d.) questioned the macaw identity of the Principal Bird Deity during the Classic period, evidence from the Late Preclassic period strongly supports its identification as a macaw at that time (see Kappelman n.d.).</page><page sequence="12">110 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Figure 11. Early Classic stuccoed vessel from Kaminaljuyu. After Kidder, Jennings, and Shook (1946:fig. 207e). Justeson 2001:60).24 The verb wu-tzuk ("to adorn, array, or bedeck") probably refers to the donning of the macaw costume, while the glyph that describes this macaw costume once again corresponds to those on the wings of the Izapa flying figures (fig. 10b). This passage then culminates by stating that the ruler?arrayed as the macaw?addressed his audience and announced his status as ruler (Kaufman and Justeson 2001:62). In other words, this portion of the La Mojarra narrative tells us that the ruler's performance culminated in his public declaration of rulership only after he donned the macaw costume. According to the analysis by Justeson and Kaufman, the text of La Mojarra Stela 1 presents the avian costuming by the ruler as the climax of a public performance in which he declared his kingly authority. Moreover, there appears to be a close correspondence between the proposed narrative of La Mojarra Stela 1 and the imagery at Izapa that depicts individuals actually engaged in rituals costumed as birds. The possibility of such correspondences between the Izapan style imagery and the hieroglyphic inscription of La Mojarra Stela 1 is important to consider, despite ongoing decipherment of the inscription.25 Moreover, while the inscription provides a potentially important analogy for the Izapan-style imagery, in addition to the more obvious iconographie relationships, the interpretation of the scenes on the Izapan-style monuments offered here by no means hinges on the proposed reading of the La Mojarra text. When considered together, the monuments with avian imagery and the archaeological remains of bird costuming provide compelling evidence that the performance of rulers in the persona of the Principal Bird Deity was critical to rituals of rulership during the Late Preclassic period. Furthermore, imagery from sites like Izapa, Kaminaljuyu, Abaj Takalik, and La Mojarra implies that these rituals were performed from the Highlands of Guatemala to the Soconusco region of coastal Chiapas and the Gulf Coast of Veracruz. The mythological foundations for this ideology, however, must also be explored. The mythological underpinnings of avian transformation The Principal Bird Deity has been identified as the way, or companion spirit, of the primordial shaman and primary creator deity of the Maya, Itzamnaaj, during the Classic Maya period.26 An Early Classic stuccoed vessel 24. As Justeson and Kaufman (1993: 1710 n. 2) noted, the sign u represents "a high, central-back unrounded vowel, like the u o? put and bush, . . . and o? justas in just now," and is written in the practical, Spanish-based orthography employed by Justeson and Kaufman (1997: 210 n. 7). 25. In addition to Justeson and Kaufman (1993, 1996, 1997) and Kaufman and Justeson (2001 ), see alternative analyses of the La Mojarra inscription in Anderson (1993) and M?luzin (1995), and a critical evaluation of the translation in Houston (2000:131). 26. Taube (in Houston and Stuart 1989:n. 7) first specifically identified the Principal Bird Deity as the way of Itzamnaaj, although both Bardawil (1976) and Hellmuth (1986, 1987) had earlier noted the reciprocal relationship between the two deities. Also see Schele (1992:128) and Freidel et al. (1993:412 n. 19). See Houston and Stuart (1989) and Grube and Nahm (1994) for investigations of the concept</page><page sequence="13">Kappelman: Demystifying the Late Preclassic Izapan-style stela-altar "cult" 111 from Kaminaljuyu (fig. 11) appears to depict Itzamnaaj transforming into his avian counterpart, the Principal Bird Deity (Kidder, Jennings, and Shook 1946:fig. 207e; Kappelman 2001:92). Three of the four figures wear the flower headband associated with the bird, while all four wear the personified wings.27 Although the features of only two of the figures are preserved with any detail, they transform dramatically from more anthropomorphic (as on the figure at the left) to more avian, replete with hooked beak (as on the adjacent figure to the right). Importantly, this transformation from human to bird appears to occur within the context of a dance or choreographed performance. A related dance is performed by an unusual, avian transformed version of Itzamnaaj on the Early Classic Delataille vessel (fig. 12) (cf. Hellmuth 1988).28 In this imagery, Itzamnaaj appears in an inverted position, legs askew, wearing the beaded, floral headdress associated with the bird. Around him float the floral cartouches that bear such close resemblance to the object hovering in front of the face of the ruler on La Mojarra Stela 1. Their placement here, clearly within an otherworldly context, recalls the suggestion by Houston and Taube (2000:271) that such forms may reference a supernatural floral realm. Imagery like this further emphasizes the significance that performances or dances by Itzamnaaj, at times in the guise or persona of his companion spirit the Principal Bird Deity, carried during the Late Preclassic and Early Classic periods. The Principal Bird Deity also figures prominently into the creation story of the Maya. For example, the death or destruction of the Principal Bird Deity at the hands of one of the Hero Twins is a well-known theme within the corpus of Classic Maya art, as on the famous "BlowgunnerVase" (fig. 13). As Freidel et al. (1993) noted, this event was one of a series that set the new era into motion. Even more importantly for this discussion, the narrative of the confrontation between the bird and the Hero Twin figures prominently into the corpus of Late Preclassic Izapa monuments. Lowe et al. (1982) and Cortez (1986) identified the bird in the tree on Figure 12. Detail of zoomorphic Itzamnaaj from the Early Classic Delataille Vessel. After roll-out drawing by Lin Crocker in Hellmuth (1988:fig. 4.2). Izapa Stela 25 (fig. 14a) as the Late Preclassic prototype of both the Classic-period Principal Bird Deity and Seven Macaw of the K'iche' Maya Popol Vu h creation story.29 Lowe et al. (1982:19), Cortez (1986), and Barba (1990) also related the bleeding arm of the standing figure on Izapa Stela 25 to the Popol Vuh narrative in which the Hero Twin loses his arm in a skirmish with the bird: And when Seven Macaw arrived, perching over his meal, the nance, it was then that he was shot by Hunahpu. The blowgun shot went right to his jaw, breaking his mouth. Then he went up over the tree and fell flat on the ground. Suddenly Hunahpu appeared, running. He set out to grab him, but actually it was the arm of Hunahpu that was seized by Seven Macaw. He yanked it straight back, he bent it back at the shoulder. Then Seven Macaw tore it right out of Hunahpu (Tedlock 1985: 91-92). This same mythic passage is featured elsewhere, as on the Early Classic double cylinder vase in which the Hero Twin takes aim of the impressive bird perched across from him (see Coe 1989:fig. 14). It also appears in the sculptural program of the ballcourt at the Classic Maya site of Copan, as well as on a stucco from the site of Tonina, which not only depicts the battle between the bird and the Hero Twin but explicitly describes it in the of way, or a companion spirit, in Classic Maya art and hieroglyphic writing. 27. See Bardawil (1976:198) and Freidel et al. (1993:412 n. 19) for discussions of the flower (or phonetic itz) headband as a diagnostic attribute of both the Principal Bird Deity and Itzamnaaj, as well as Kappelman (1997:71-75) for a summary of the diagnostic attributes of the bird during the Classic period. 28. For a more detailed presentation of the arguments identifying this zoomorphic figure as Itzamnaaj, see Kappelman (1997:165-178). 29. I would like to thank an anonymous reviewer who remarked that Karl Taube had first noted the correlations between the imagery at Izapa and the Popol Vuh narrative in an unpublished undergraduate thesis.</page><page sequence="14">112 RES 45 SPRING 2004 Figure 13. Classic Maya "Blowgunner Vase." Drawing by Linda Schele, courtesy of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc. accompanying hieroglyphic inscription as k'ak u k'ab "chopped off his arm" (Schele and Looper 1996:20).30 This confrontation between the Hero Twins and a mythic creature is not unique to the Maya creation saga, but appears in Mixe mythology as well. This is especially significant, given Izapa's strategic location along a corridor of communication between Mayan and Mixe-Zoquean speakers. A legend recorded by Lipp (1991:75) recounts the exploits of twins, a boy and a girl. After being refused shelter in a village, the twins are carried off in the night by a giant animal: When they woke up the next morning, they did not know where they were. . . . The girl, who was more alert, saw the giant animal who had carried them off sleeping in a large tree. The children then cut sticks and picked up points to make arrows, six arrows for each twin. The girl went first to shoot but was unable to hit the beast. When only two arrows were left, the boy took the arrows and shot at the animal, which fell off the mountain and landed with a resounding echo below. The correlations between the Mixe legend and the Maya Popol Vuh story are evident. First, although the "giant animal" in the Mixe legend is not identified specifically as a bird, its perch in a tree is suggestive of such. Second, its defeat by the twin as the result of a successful shot closely parallels the Popol Vuh story. These analogies might, in fact, evidence an ancient, shared creation narrative whose roots can be traced back into the Preclassic period. Although the narrative of Stela 25 (fig. 14a) clearly references the confrontation between the Hero Twin and the Principal Bird Deity, or prototypical Seven Macaw, it does not explicitly depict the shooting of the bird, nor the bird's defeat and death. In fact, the bird is regally depicted, perched at the top of the staff held by the Hero Twin. Perhaps this apparent departure from the narrative can be resolved when the allusion to the bird's defeat is understood as part of a ritual cycle in which the death of the bird was a catalyst for the ensuing events of creation. It also foreshadows the story of the Maize God, whose own death was a necessary component in an on-going cycle of sacrifice and rebirth (Quenon and Le Fort 1997; Taube 1985, 1992).31 The demise of the bird also figuratively removes it from the ordinary world, thereby relegating its identity to the supernatural or celestial Otherworld. This conceptual location of the bird is visually reinforced through the imagery of Izapa Stela 25, which depicts the bird perched in glory on top of the staff, adjacent to the crocodilian version of the World Tree, or axis mundi.32 30. Regarding the Copan ballcourt, see Fash (1991, 1998:230-232) and Kowalski and Fash (1991). At Tonina, the bird on this stucco carries the appellation Chan Mo' Nal, or "Four Macaw," which suggests that the bird could carry different titles and names, or that there may have been more than one version of the Principal Bird Deity during the Classic period (Marc Zender, personal communication 2002; also see Bassie-Sweet n.d., as in footnote 23, for similar arguments regarding the bird's Classic period identity). 31. Miller and Samayoa (1998:64) commented on the references to the Principal Bird Deity that can appear within depictions of the Maize God's death and resurrection. Both narratives, that of the Principal Bird Deity and the Maize God, were part of a larger creation story filled with imbricating cycles of death and renewal. 32. As Schele (1992) first demonstrated, the narrative of creation was visually played out each night in the movement of the constellations, planets, and Milky Way, which was understood as the</page><page sequence="15">Kappelman: Demystifying the Late Preclassic Izapan-style stela-altar "cult" 113 Figure 14. a. Izapa Stela 25. Drawing by Ayax Moreno, courtesy of the New World Archaeological Foundation. b. Izapa Stela 2. Drawing by Ayax Moreno, courtesy of the New World Archaeological Foundation. As if to reinforce its role as a conduit of communication to the Otherworld, the bird disseminates a serpent cord that entwines the staff and encircles the World Tree, functioning as a metaphorical umbilicus that connects the natural world to the supernatural sphere.33 Interestingly, Akkeren (1999: 293-294) noted the formal and conceptual parallels between the death of the bird, as depicted on the Blowgunner Pot and referenced on Izapa Stela 25, and passages from the K'iche' Rab'inal Achi. This dance drama describes the death of a victim by arrow sacrifice that was performed in conjunction with the investment of a new ruler, the commemoration of a founding war, or the rise to power of a specific lineage.34 He suggested that future research should consider the parallels between these two narratives, and "concentrate on the eschatological role of the victim: in what respect is his death and blood indispensable for the accession of a new king or a new ruling lineage?" Likewise, continuing research by Akkeren has linked acts of arrow sacrifice to the rituals of nose-piercing that accommodated investment into office for many Mesoamerican rulers.35 The act of nose piercing symbolically "killed" an individual who was then "reborn" as ruler, much as the bird's "death" at Izapa established its glorified role in the supernatural realm. Such research confirms a fundamental belief throughout ancient Mesoamerica in inherent cycles of sacrifice, death, and ritual rebirth, which may be related to the seemingly contradictory role of the Principal Bird Deity as both victim and god. In this context, it is intriguing to think about the possible functions of this narrative in which the Principal Bird Deity is confronted by a Hero Twin as on Izapa Stela 25, or the deeper political significance of the numerous Late Preclassic giant World Tree or axis mundi. Ted lock (1985: 360) reported that his informant had identified the Big Dipper as the astronomical counterpart of the Principal Bird Deity, while Schele (1992:138) and Freidel et al. (1993:fig. 2.24) correlated this astronomical identification of the bird with its representation in the corpus of Late Preclassic and Classic art and in particular to Izapa Stela 25, which they asserted depicts the drama in both narrative and astronomical terms. 33. For a discussion of the metaphorical symbolism of serpent cords and umbilici see Miller (1974), Freidel et al. (1993), Taube (1994), Kappelman (1997), and Looper and Kappelman (2001). 34. Recall that the Mixe version of the myth recorded by Lipp (1991:75) accorded the defeat of the Mixean counterpart to the Principal Bird Deity to a successful arrow shot. 35. This topic was the focus of a session directed by Akkeren at the March 2002 Maya Meetings at Texas, which included contributions on the performative nature of these myths by Ann Wright.

Were these Late Preclassic monuments part of a very specific vocabulary of power that not only addressed the abilities of Late Preclassic rulers to communicate with the supernatural realm, but also signaled specific events within their reigns, such as accession, victory, or death? While not answerable at this time, such lines of inquiry point at least to the very powerful political function that certain narratives featured on Late Preclassic stelae must have played within the Mesoamerican landscape.36 Izapa Stela 2 (fig. 14b) depicts a scene of ritual transformation inspired by a passage from this same mythic cycle. However, instead of including the Principal Bird Deity as the protagonist, Stela 2 substitutes the image of an Izapa ruler who, transformed into the bird, reenacts the events of creation. The stela depicts a winged figure with a clearly human face descending into the parted branches of a fruit-laden tree. The winged figure is wearing the costume of the Principal Bird Deity identified on Izapa Stelae 4 and 60, and is another version of the ruler transformed into this avian deity. Like the costumes on Stelae 4 and 60, the personified wings on Stela 2 bear a sign that compares to the epi-Olmec glyph for "macaw." On either side of the branches float two small anthropomorphic figures who gesture towards the descending winged creature. Their configuration, flanking the tree, foreshadows the imagery of the Blom Plate (Hellmuth 1987:fig. 425), where the Hero Twins aim their blowguns on either side of the bird (Cortez 1986). By cleverly inserting the ruler into the creation narrative on Stela 2, however, it is the ruler who performs and facilitates the events of creation, thereby correlating his journey to that of the bird. Even more importantly, the ruler's actions become conceptually equivalent to those of Itzamnaaj, the creator deity and primordial shaman who first transformed into his companion spirit, the Principal Bird Deity. Stelae-altar pairs: the performance of rulership The prevalence of bird transformation imagery in the corpus of Late Preclassic Izapan-style monuments attests to a ruler's role as the conduit to the supernatural realm. Rulers transformed into the Principal Bird Deity as a validation of their abilities to contact the Otherworld. While these avian rituals were critical to the display and legitimation of rulership during the Late Preclassic period, they also enabled a ruler to frame these performances within a mythological vocabulary that explicitly referenced the creative acts of Itzamnaaj and the Principal Bird Deity. In other words, the transformation of rulers into birds was structurally parallel to the greater myth of the relationship between Itzamnaaj and the Principal Bird Deity. Monuments that highlighted the ability of a ruler to transform into the bird demonstrated his legacy as the natural analog to the primordial ruler Itzamnaaj, who first possessed the ability to transform into his avian counterpart and perform the cosmic journey. Transformation lay at the heart of the myth, as well as at the heart of Late Preclassic rulership. Significantly, stela monuments at sites like Izapa were the means through which these events of creation?and the ruler's role within them?were visualized and made tangible. They punctuated the Late Preclassic sacred landscape with their visions of cosmic journeys, in silent testimony to a ruler's hegemony in both this world and the other. However, the stelae must also be understood as monuments whose imagery was brought to life through ritual performance by the ruler. As Stuart (1996) astutely observed, stelae were not just a medium through which royal deeds were commemorated, but actually played direct and active roles in the ritual life of the community. In a sense, stelae were more than just permanent records of ceremonial activity; they were surrogate ritual performers, analogous in their upright form to the ruler who undoubtedly moved throughout their midst within the ceremonial landscape (cf. Newsome 1998). But what of the altars that typically accompanied these stelae? How did they fit into this theoretical framework? It is important to note that the two Izapa stelae that depict rulers engaged in avian transformation are not accompanied by altars. Izapa Stela 4 was mounted at the apex of a low terrace in front of Mound 56, which formed the northern boundary of Group A's quadrilateral plaza (fig. 15).37The other stelae erected 36. For example, see Coe (1989:161-162) for a discussion of a sixteenth-century performance by the K'ekchi' Maya held in conjunction with the founding of a new village and the assertion of authority by the local cacique, which included the re-enactment of stories from the Popul Vuh (as described in Estrada Monroy 1979:168-174). 37. Norman (1976:243) suggested that Stela 4 may have originally been paired with Altar 3, which was placed by Lowe et al. (1982:fig 8.1 ) in front of adjacent Stela 7 (see fig. 15). Altar 3 was not discovered immediately in front of either stela, although Stirling (1943:65) suggested, based on its position at the time of his investigations, that it was more closely associated with Stela 7.</page><page sequence="17">Kappelman: Demystifying the Late Preclassic Izapan-style stela-altar "cult" 115 Figure 15.

Drawing by Ramiro Jim?nez Pozo, courtesy of the New World Archaeological Foundation. on this platform were paired with altars, as was Stela 6, which was placed directly in line with Stela 4 just below the low terrace. Likewise, at the southern end of Group A in front of Mound 58, Stela 2 stood alone without an accompanying altar. It was flanked, however, by Stelae 1 and 3, each of which was paired with a zoomorphic toad altar. It is these toad altars, like those that accompanied Stelae 1 and 3 at Izapa, which may provide a clue about the symbolic role of these altars within the typical stela altar dyad. The site of Izapa contains at least four reptilian or "toad" altars?Altars 1, 2, 53 and 54? although Altars 53 and 54 were relocated anciently (fig. 16) (Norman 1976:240-248). Their presence is not unique to Izapa, as they also appear at sites such as Abaj Takalik and Kaminaljuyu, among others (see Orrego 1990:54; Parsons 1986:figs. 129-132). As noted elsewhere (Kappelman 2000), the word for "toad" or "frog" is nakak in Mixe-Zoquean languages. Strikingly similar to this is the word na'ka, which appears in Lowland Mixe languages and Oluta Popoluca and signifies "flat object, table, slab of flat stone, or stage" (Wichmann 1995:396). By extension, the toads that were frequently paired with Late Preclassic stelae may have been understood, through this wordplay, as stages that provided a platform for performance in which the stelae themselves were featured as the "performer." The toad altars, perhaps, were analogous to dance platforms, while the stelae were conceptually equivalent to the protagonists who performed upon these stages.38 This interpretation is confirmed by several stela ?mages at Izapa. Stela 11 (fig. 17a) depicts an individual emerging from the maw of a reptilian creature that represents a personified version of one of these toad altars.39 The toad depicted on the stela, like its three dimensional counterparts in Group A, bears pitted parotid glands that identify it as a Bufo marinus toad. On Stela 11, the toad altar is a dynamic participant in the ritual depicted, and literally signifies the platform? or in this case portal?from which the ruler emerges. This imagery also provides a formal parallel to the sculptural format favored at Izapa: stelae rose above the toad altars at their feet just as rulers were "reborn" from the altars at their feet. The imagery of Izapa Stela 6 (fig. 17b) echoes these same notions. Here, a vision is born from the maw of another personified Bufo marinus toad altar. As with Stela 11, the personified toad altar on Stela 6 is an active participant in?or one of the vehicles through which?the ritual was manifested. Even more importantly, Stela 6 stood directly in front of Stela 4, at the base of the low platform upon which the other stelae in front of Mound 56 were placed. Given this location, its imagery appears to operate at two different levels. First, it connotes the hallucinogenic properties of the Bufo marinus venom, which may have been used by ancient Mesoamericans to facilitate an altered state of consciousness (F?rst 1981; Reilly 1989), and which may well have been ingested during an avian performance like that portrayed on Stela 4.40 Second, through its Norman's arguments, which were reiterated by Lowe et al. (1982:173), are based on the stylistic similarities between Altar 3 and Stela 4, both of which depict avian characters and both of which incorporate an in turning ground line. However, the parallel relationship between Stela 4 and Stela 2, which face each other across the Group A plaza and do not have associated altars, suggests that Stirling's original suggestion has more merit, and that Altar 3 should, indeed, be placed with Stela 7 rather than Stela 4. Nonetheless, as Lowe et al. (ibid.) cautioned, the possibility will always exist that the toad altars (Altars 53 and 54) relocated to Group F during the Early Classic period may have originally been associated with one or more of the stelae without altars in Group A. 38. This wordplay, as well as the stelae imagery discussed below, suggests that Izapa altars in general, toad or otherwise, were understood as "stages" that featured the "performance" of the stela above. 39. Izapa Stela 11 was located in Group B at the base of Mound 47 (Lowe et al. 1982:fig. 9.1). 40. There is ongoing debate concerning the use and psychoactive properties of bufotenine. Davis and Weil (1992) argued that bufotenine is not psychoactive, does not cross the blood-brain barrier effectively, and contains toxic agents too dangerous for human consumption. However, more recent research by McBride (2000) argues that bufotenine is indeed psychoactive in the brain and can cross the human blood-brain barrier when combined with a high concentration of epinephrine (as contained in the venom of Bufo marinus), which</page><page sequence="19">Kappelman: Demystifying the Late Preclassic Izapan-style stela-altar "cult" 11 7 Figure 17. a.

Drawing by Ayax Moreno, courtesy of the New World Archaeological Foundation. personification of an altar or performance venue that was charged with energy, it also may have connoted the open platform space at the feet of Stela 4, which would have provided an ideal location for the performance of avian rituals. In effect, Stelae 4 and 6 worked in tandem, referencing the dynamic duo of stela and altar, which gave sculptural form to the performances of rulers on the sacred altars at their feet. At the opposite end of the Group A plaza, Stela 2 depicted another bird dance, yet lacked an altar at its base as well. However, on either side of it were two three-dimensional representations of Bufo marinus toads (see figs. 15 and 16).41 Again, the sculptural renditions of these toads may have alluded to the space provided between them and in front of Stela 2, which was another likely spot for the performance of Late Preclassic rulers. In fact, the entire plaza space of Group A was undoubtedly the place in which these avian performances were choreographed (Kappelman 2001). Accordingly, these toad altars appear to have been active participants within the stela-altar dyad, which spoke directly to the performative nature of this sculptural convention that echoed?and monumentalized?the very rituals that were staged within their midst. Final thoughts This essay focuses on the recurring narrative of avian transformation featured on Izapan style stelae, and its significance within a specific sculptural assemblage at the site of Izapa that featured stela-altar pairs. Despite its tentative nature, the argument attempts to re-evaluate these monuments as powerful sculptural vehicles that transmitted highly charged ideological messages concerning the nature of rulership throughout a broad geographic region during the Late Preclassic period. In their upright state, Late Preclassic stelae were analogous to rulers, engaged in dances in which they communed increases the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Ongoing research by McBride explores the biotransformation of the toxic components in the Bufo marinus venom during fermentation processes, which may render it less noxious and more tolerable (McBride, personal communication 2002). Also see Ott (2001) for further evidence of bufotenine's psychoactivity as well as its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. 41. Altar 2 (fig. 18) accompanied Stela 3 at the base of Mound 58 in Group A at Izapa. Toad Altar 1 was found in association with Stela 1, also at the base of Mound 58.</page><page sequence="20">118 RES 45 SPRING 2004 with the supernatural realm and validated their claims to authority in this world (cf. Stuart 1996). The altars at the feet of the stelae referenced the stages upon which these rituals?made permanent and timeless through the medium of stone?were performed. In effect, the stela altar format embodied the very essence of Late Preclassic ritual. While avian transformation monuments are but one example of the kinds of Late Preclassic narratives that were monumentalized in the sculptural record, they provide especially evocative insight into how messages of rulership were ideally suited to the stela form, which itself connoted both power and performance. In fact, this marriage between form and content?in which the stela became the dominant vehicle for the presentation of themes of authority in tandem with the carved altars at their feet? characterized many sites during the Late Preclassic period, and would continue to flourish throughout the Classic period.
