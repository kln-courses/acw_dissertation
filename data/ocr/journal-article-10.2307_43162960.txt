Changes in the behavior of mammals, birds, insects, and plants, and cloud and wind in- dicators are discussed. Although the lore would fascinate many people, treatment of the scientific concepts focuses major use of the book on upper elementary and middle school grades. Air pressure, relative humidity, and tempera- ture are major topics, but relationships between them are not properly identified.

Other minor drawbacks are anthropomorphic ref- erences to fish and birds "knowing" about weather factors, presentation of several folk say- ings which are more complex than the accom- panying explanatory discussion, and the inter- changeable way in which saturation point and dew point are used without proper identification. However, the book is well-suited to the con- crete thinking process of students in middle school. It would be a useful and popular book in middle and junior high school libraries.
