<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NEW PSALTER: ITS ORIGIN AND SPIRIT Augustine Bea Translated by Augustine Wand On the vigil of Palm Sunday our Holy Father, Pope Pius* XII, with his Motu Proprio, In cotidianis precibus (March 24, 1945), gave to priests and to all who are obliged to recite the Canonical Hours daily, the right to use, if they so choose, the new translation of the Psalter both in the private and the public recitation of the Office.1 This version was made at the Pontiff's behest by a commission of professors of the Pon- tifical Biblical Institute and was in the making upward of four years, having come to an end during these last days and been published by the Institute.2 There is a very legitimate desire to know a little more in detail the manner of preparing this new translation and what were the principles which guided the work of the translators. In the following we shall first give a few details about the preparatory work for the New Psalter and then explain at greater length than was possible in the Pro- legomena to the Liber Psalmorum (pp. xxiii-xxviii) what principles and criteria were followed by the translators in their work.3 A. - Organization of the Work The task of preparing a new translation of the Psalms was assigned to the Biblical Institute by the Supreme Pontiff on the 19 January, 1941. The program was clearly traced from the beginning by the Supreme Pontiff himself. In his Motu Proprio he describes it in these terms: "We gave orders that a new Latin translation of the Psalms be made which should combine both a faithful rendering of the original texts and a careful regard, as far as feasible, both for the venerable Vulgate and for the other ancient versions : the various readings to be sifted accord- ing to the principles of sound criticism."4 In accordance with these orders, a commission was at once formed consisting of six professors of the Institute, who were experts in the more important branches of biblical science which had a bearing upon the diffi- 1 Act.

The purpose of this commission was as follows: to determine more precisely the norms ac- cording to which the new translation was to be made, to prepare for each psalm the scheme of translation, to discuss these schemes in the plenary sessions, to revise and correct them in accordance with the remarks made during the discussions, to discuss them again, so that after three, four, and even five discussions they might appear to correspond to the directions given and to the purpose held in view for this new translation. After a labor of three and one-half years the manuscript of the new version could be consigned to the Supreme Pontiff in August 1944. During the whole time the Holy Father had shown a lively interest in the progress of the discussions and in the results obtained. On the following eighth of September the Holy Father gave orders for the printing of both of the Liber Psalmorum and of the liturgical edition, which had likewise been prepared during this period; in this, the text of the new version is distributed according to the single offices of the Psalterium and of the Commune Sanctorum. B. - The Critical Revision of the Text The command given by the Supreme Pontiff had clearly decided one question regarding which many had been in doubt. This was whether an entirely new translation was to be made from the original texts or whether it was rather to be a revision of the Psalter of the Vulgate (the Psalterium Gallicanum) with the aid of the original texts. Attentive readers of the encyclical Divino Afflante Spiritu were by no means sur- prised by the decision which was made. In this, Pius XII had already said: "Vulgatae in rebus doctrinae auctoritas minime vetat - immo id hodie fere postulat - quominus eadem haec doctrina ex primogeniis etiam textibus comprobetur et confirmetur, atque etiam quominus passim in auxilium iidem textus vocentur, quibus recta Sacrarum Litterarum significado ubique magis in dies patefiat atque explanetur." In this same encyclical the ultimate theological reason was also given : "Primo- genium ilium textum explanari oportet, qui ab ipso sacro auctore con- scriptus maiorem auctoritatem maiusque pondus habet, quam quaelibet, utut optima, si ve antiqua si ve recentior conversio."5 As this fundamental norm was fixed by the supreme authority of the Pontiff there could be no hesitation for the translators about the way of proceeding. Given the special purpose of the new translation desired by 5 Cf. Encyclical, Divino Afflante Spiritu, Act . Apost . Sed., Vol. 35 (1943), pp. 309, 307.</page><page sequence="3">6 The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit the Holy Father, it was quite evident that there could not be question of adapting or of perfecting one of the existing Latin translations of the Psalms, however perfect these might be. In our case there was question of a translation whose one purpose was that of faithfully rendering the sense of the original text , without being preoccupied about other ques- tions, such as language, rhythm and similar matters; at the same time the new version must serve the purposes of the liturgy ; in language and style it must suit ecclesiastical tradition. At the same time, the new translation, though made from the original Hebrew text, could not neg- lect the ancient translations existing in the Church and, even though the Holy Father had not so expressly desired this, it had to pay careful attention to the ancient and venerable Vulgate, both in matters of text and language. 1. - The first task, therefore, of the translators was to fix by a process of sober and careful textual criticism the original text which was to be translated. That the Massoretic Hebrew text, which is preserved in codices not older than the ninth century A.D.6 stands in need of critical revision is now conceded by all the exegetes.7 The path to follow, there- fore, could be none other than that indicated by the Motu Proprio, to wit, to compare the present Hebrew text "with the other texts which have been bequeathed to us by antiquity, in order to find the most exact and correct reading." This is the way followed by St. Jerome, who, in addi- tion to the Hebrew text furnished to him by a Hebrew,8 consulted also the Septuagint and the translations made by Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion.9 In our days this is a more complicated task, as the number of ancient witnesses has notably increased and the method of textual criticism has been greatly developed. On the other hand, after the much solid critical work done on the text of the Psalms, this labor has today become much easier. No longer is it, as in the case of St. Jerome, a work of pioneering but that of making a judicious study of suggestions made by competent critics and exegetes of these last centuries. Given the special character of the edition to be made by the translators, namely, rather that of a summing up, the task was, for the most part, that of choosing from a multitude those critical revisions which were the most 6 Some fragments discovered within the last decades are older (6th-9th Cent.).

In our days the art of textual criticism "has reached such a degree of fixity and sureness of norms" says Pius XII in his Encyclical Divino Afflante Spiritu, "that it has become a wonderful tool for propagating the word of God in the most exact and pure manner."10 On the other hand, there exist in our day critical editions of most of the ancient versions which deserve attention for the reconstruction of the text. Such editions, in most cases, have been made according to the standards of present-day textual criticism.11 Much critical material has already been assembled in some of the recent commentaries, notably in the commentary of Briggs (1906; 3d. ed., 1916) as also in the Biblia Hebraica of Kittel (3d. edition by Kittel-Kahle), where Frantz Buhl has given a very full critical ap- paratus comprising the variants of the ancient versions and a collection of the most important conjectures proposed by modern critics. From a scientific standpoint, therefore, there existed the essential conditions for the fixing of a critical text of the Psalms, which, while perhaps not that which flowed from the pen of the Psalmists, is certainly much older than the Massoretic text and essentially represents the reading of the second or third century before Christ. May we have hopes of finding Hebrew texts even older than that? Such a happy find could not be pronounced impossible, but past experiences in the field of Pales- tinian archaeology unfortunately give little ground of hope for such a happy event. To hold off the new translation of the Psalms in expecta- tion of such an event would be to postpone it "ad kalendas graecas." 2. - Of the text established by the translators, as the basis for the new version, an account is given in the critical apparatus which follows each psalm in the Liber Psalmorum . Whoever will carefully examine that collection of variant readings will notice that in many cases preference is given over the Massoretic text to the Greek Septuagint translation, 10 Divino Afflante Spiritu, 1. c., p. 308; Italian version, p. 12 (Rome: 1943, Tipogr. Poligl. Vaticana). 11 It would have been advantageous to have had a critical edition of the Gallican (Vulgate) Psalter like that of Jerome's Psalter iuxta Hebraeos ed. by J. N. Har- den (London: 1922). Unfortunately, however, the unremitting labors of the learned monks of the distinguished Abbey of St. Jerome in Rome have not as yet been completed ; and we fear that the edition of the Psalms which, according to the original program, was to appear in 1952 (Cf. P. Salmon, La Revision de la Vul- gate ; Citta del Vaticano: 1937, p. 9) has been notably retarded by the sad events of the last years. Nevertheless, since not a revision of the Vulgate but a new translation of the original Hebrew was in question, the translators did not abso- lutely need a critical edition of the Gallican Psalter.</page><page sequence="5">8 The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit be it that it stands by itself or that it agrees with the reading of other ancient texts, such as the Peshitto, St. Jerome, or the Targum. For this reason the new translation in many cases agrees, either entirely or with slight emendations, with the Vulgate against the Hebrew text of the Massoretes. Substantially the Vulgate text is merely a Latin trans- lation, often a slavish one, of the Septuagint, and on this account the new translation preserves a part of the ancient tradition, which according to the principles of textual criticism represents a form of text better estab- lished than the present Hebrew text. We can excuse ourselves from giving particular examples of such preferences given to readings of the old translation over the Hebrew Massoretic text ; the experts in this matter will easily discover these and will divine the reasons for them. Only two cases will be mentioned especially, as these illustrate in a marked way the principles which guided the work and have some doctrinal importance, as there is question of messianic psalms. In Psalm 21 (22) :1 7, the translation has, like the Vulgate: "Foderunt manus meas et pedes meos." The current Hebrew text has kâ'arî, "sicut leo"; this reading is unsatisfactory also for in- trinsic reasons and without support from any ancient translation, all of which read the third person plural of a verbal form vvhich, with a slight emendation, can be reconstructed as kä'am or kâriï, from a verb kûr, "perfodit," or "circumligavit" instead of kďarí. The objections which are raised against this critical emendation, which was adopted in the new translation, do not undermine its authority.12 The third verse of Psalm 109 (110) is more difficult and more hotly debated. The Massoretic text may be rendered : "Populus tuus promp- tissimus est die fortitudinis tuae in ornatibus sacris; ex utero aurorae (est) tibi ros adulescentiate tuae." However, this rendering presents several difficulties, both real and grammatical. Besides, all the ancient translations read a text differing from this both in vocalization and in the consonants. The suggestions for reconstruction are almost as nu- merous as the commentators and the last word in the matter under discus- sion will probably never be said.13 The translation of the Liber 12Herkene, Das Buch der Psalmen (Bonn: 1936), p. 110: " . . . ka'ru, was eigentlich 'ausgraben' 'aushöhlen' bedeutet, z.B., eine Grube, einen Brunnen aus- graben (also Löcher in Hände und Füsse graben) und darum [sie!] als adäquater Ausdruck für 'durchbohren' zweifelhaft ist." The Peshitto in our text reads bassa'w , a term by which it renders naqab of the Hebrew text in 4 Kings 18:21. Other suggestions of critics, such as ka ' abu, grieve, have but little probability. See, also, König, Die Psalmen (Gütersloh: 1927), p. 515 ff. 13 Cf. J. Coppens, "Le Psaume CIX (CX) v. 3" in Eph. Lov., Vol. 7 (1930), p. 292 ff ; Herkenne, "Psalm 110 (109), 'Dixit Dominus Domino meo' in neuer text-</page><page sequence="6">The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit 9 Psalmorum (p. 233 ff.) substantially presupposes the text of the Septua- gint: "Tecum principium die ortus tui in splendore sanctitatis: ante luciferum, tamquam rorem, genui te." This interpretation, therefore, differs little from the traditional one of the Vulgate; instead of the mērēhem of the Hebrew text (Greek, Ik yaarpós) it reads be térem (pre- supposing a confusion of Hebrew letters as happens also elsewhere) and instead of Vkã tal , which is missing in G but is presupposed in S, it reads ketal. It is admitted freely that even these emendations do not remove all difficulties but, having the support of the ancient translations, of palaeography and of the context, they are undoubtedly a brave attempt to clear up this obscure text and are much less radical than those which other exegetes have proposed. In the case of a text of a certain doctrinal importance, the translators preferred the safer way, that is, of preserving substantially that meaning which had been accepted in the Church for so many centuries and which is supported, besides, by solid critical reasons. 3. - These examples make it clear that the critical evaluation of the ancient variant readings is at times a very delicate matter and calls for a dispassionate and circumspect consideration of all the elements which have a bearing on them. This task is still more delicate when the He- brew text by critical standards gives rise to the suspicion that a cor- ruption has occurred and still no variant is found in the ancient versions. Thus, for example, in Psalm 40 (41) :9, the Hebrew text, as also the versions, read "one word" (or "one thing") of Belial (i.e., wicked) op- presses him"; the Vulgate translates: "Verbum iniquum constituerunt adver sum me." Now the Hebrew dãbãr, "word" "thing," with a simple change of vowels, becomes deber, i.e., "pestilence"14 and this meaning fits splendidly into the context, where there is question of the Psalmist being seriously ill. It is well known that till the time of St. Jerome the biblical texts were written without vowels; the three consonants dbr could well have been read either dãbãr or dèber .13 kritischer Beleuchtung," Biblica , Vol. 11 (1930), pp. 450-457; J.

Zorell, Psalterium ex Hebraeo Latinum, ed. 2da (Rome: 1939), p. 419. 15 Jerome cites the very same word to show that the three consonants may- be read in different ways : "Verbum Hebraicum quod tribus litteris scribitur, Daleth, Beth, Res (vocales enim in medio non habent) pro consequentia et legends arbitrio si legatur DABAR sermonem significai; si DEBER, mortem; si DABBER, loquere."

The Vulgate reads rather enigmatically: "Quoniam cogi- talo hominis confitebitur tibi et reliquiae cogitationis diem festum agent tibi." The translation substantially implies the present Massoretic text, which might be given more exactly in this way : "Nam furor hominum celebrabit te, et superstites furoris tibi facies cincturam," or with G : "tibi festum agent."16 It is at once clear that this unintelligible text must have been corrupted in some manner. The context suggests an emendation which involves no consonantal change : in place of 'ādām we may read ' Edõm and in place of ķēmot read Hamāt. In this manner we arrive at a limpidly clear text: "Nam furor Edom glorificabit te, et superstites Emath festum agent tibi." The divine judge who "confregit fulmina arcus, scutum et gladium et arma" (v. 4) has brought low the two neighboring kingdoms, Edom on the south and Hamath on the north (cp. 2 Sam. 8:9, 13) and now both are praising the Lord and are numbered among those who "in circuitu munus ferunt Terribili, ei qui cohibet spiritum principům, qui terribilis est regibus terrae" (w. 12 ff).17 In other instances a change of vowels is suggested by parallelism. This basic rule of Hebrew poetry, which, as it were, divides the idea into two parts, placing the first in the first stich and the synonymous or op- posed one in the second, affords an excellent help for restoring the word in one stich by means of the one in the corresponding stich, whenever it has been lost or corrupted through some accident. One example will be sufficient. In Psalm 28 (29) :9, the Vulgate with the Massoretic text says: "Vox Domini praeparantis cervos (' ayyãlôt ) et revelabit condensa." "Condensa" ("woods," "forest" ) shows that there is ques- tion of a bolt of lightning which blasts the woods; instead of ' ayyãlôt , "cervae," which makes no sense in the context, we would expect another word, and we at once hit upon another with the same consonants Jê(y)lôt, "quercus," giving at once the translation : "Dominus contorquet quercus et decorticat silvas," a reading which brings back to the text all its primitive poetic vigor. The cases in which a different vocalization imparts a sense more in 16 G's ¿opravě t &lt;tol (festum agent tibi) presupposes precisely ťhaggeka, instead of the Massoretic tehgor. 17 This felicitous emendation seems to have been proposed first by E. König, Die Psalmen (Gütersloh: 19 27), p. 422; it was accepted by H. Schmidt, Die Psalmen (Tübingen: 1934), p. 145 and by J. Cales, Le livre des Psaumes (Paris: 1936), Vol. II, p. 26 ff.</page><page sequence="8">The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit 11 harmony with the context than the Massoretic are not rare.18 In other cases the same result is obtained by a change in pointing,19 or by com- bining the consonants in two words in a way differing from that of the Massoretes. We read, for example, in the Vulgate: "Quam bonus Israel Deus, his qui recto sunt corde" (Ps. 72 [73] :1). This psalm does not deal with the people of Israel, but is individual; besides, the sapiential psalms, to which this one belongs, are wont to treat of man in general, not of the Israelites; and, in fine, in the second stich of the verse there is question of those who "puro sunt corde," for which reason parallelism requires a synonymous expression. This is attained if the same consonants y s r are read, not yisra, but with different vowels yãsâr and if the second part 'ēl is placed separately. The sense resulting is : "Quam bònus rectis20 est Deus, Dominus eis qui puro sunt corde." - In Psalm 73 (74) :14, the Vulgate has: "Dedisti eum (i.e., Levia- than, that is the army of the Egyptians) escam populis Aethiopum" ;21 the present Hebrew text ( lefām l'siyyîm) might be rendered: "to the people of the beasts of the desert." But retaining the same consonants and making two words of them, we might read (/" ami9 sê (y) yam) "to the marine monsters" (deriving 'aml'se(y) from 'amias, "squalus marinus").22 It would lead too far to explain all the cases in which an emenda- tion is suggested by the context and even, at times, made certain by philological and palaeographic considerations. Of this type are changes in text caused by letters of similar form23 or during dictation by the con- fusion of letters of similar sound, more particularly gutturals or laryn- 18 An instance of a vocalization differing from that of MT occurs in Ps. 75 :3 VG: "factus est in pace " (G [cv] flpr1vr¡ = b'shālom instead of b'shālēm (MT). 19 The Vulgate, also, not infrequently supposes a pointing different from that of MT; thus in Ps. 16 (17) :3; 21 (22) :32; 76 (77) :6; 83 (84) :11 ; on the other hand, in other cases it agrees, against the parallelism, with MT, e.g., Ps. 86 (87) :1. 20 "rectis" : the singular yashar is a singular of category (cf. Joüon, Gram. Hebr., 1 35c). In the same Psalm, MT (v. 4) has L'motham, whereas the context re- quires Lamo tam, "(their body) is sound for them." 21 The translation, Aaol? rotę AiQlo'¡/iv (G) seems to be simply an exegetical conjecture. F. Wutz, Die Psalmen textkritisch untersucht (Munich: 1925), p. 195, conjectures that G may have read çiyyim = o-eei/ji or c r€tc¿/x deriving it from ąahim = aXOoirts (the shining, sparkling), which then became Ai&amp;Weç. 22 According to a happy conjecture of Imm. Low, cf. Perles, in Monatsschr. für Gesch. u. Wissensch, des Judent., Vol. 68 (1923), p. 160 ff; L.

In other cases copyists who were exhausted by long and trying labor passed over one or several words, their eyes passing from one word to another identical with it (haplography),24 and, for similar reasons, they repeated words or letters (dittography).23 A sane and circumspect method of criticism will avail itself of all of these possibilities of emendation, not arbitrarily or from an itch for innovations, but from a desire of employing all possible scientific means for arriving at a truly intelligible text. In such wise the true and primi- tive reading of the Hebrew text may often be found, even though no variant in the ancient translations contains it. It is clear that all these proceedings present the danger of subjectivism and that, therefore, here more than ever, there is need of careful consideration. A look at the critical apparatus of the Liber Psalmorum will convince the reader that, in comparison with corrections based on ancient texts, those made ac- cording to these critical processes, without the support of ancient readings, are comparatively rare. This is even more evident when they are com- pared with the critical apparatus of the Biblia Hebraica of Kittel where such corrections are much more frequent and more daring. The trans- lators were persuaded that in this matter they must show great reserve, though they could not exclude entirely corrections of this type, espe- cially as a great number of them are admitted by nearly all exegetes. However, all corrections were barred which depended on certain metri- cal systems, such as have been proposed and defended by some specialists, not because they are unwarranted but because none of them is at present generally admitted. It seemed undesirable to introduce into a translation which was meant for liturgical use in the Church any particular theory not accepted by all. The text which is presupposed for the new Latin translation can, therefore, be easily described : it is the Massoretic text such as it is found in recent editions of the Biblia Hebraica , excepting where the critical apparatus of the Liber Psalmorum gives a variant reading. This text is, 24 Thus in MT of Ps. 45 (46) :4, the refrain, "Dominus exercituum . . . Deus Jacob," is omitted; in Ps. 144 (145), which is an acrostic, the stich which com- mences with Nun is lacking (still preserved in G S Jer.). One of the most striking cases of haplography is found in the Canticle of Judith (16:19 V) : "qui autem timent te, magni sunt apud te per omnia." Here the eye of the copyist seems to have leaped from &lt;j&gt;oßov1xevos of v. 15c (G) to &lt;/&gt;o/3oÚ/acvoç of v. 16c (G), omitting a very important clause: "Qui autem timent te, tu es propitius eis, quia parvum est omne sacrificium in odorem suavitatis, et minimum omne pinque in holo- caustům tibi; sed qui timet [Dominum, erit undique magnus]." In the Liber Psalmorum the text has been fully restored. 23 E.g., Ps. 44 (45) :5, wahadar'ka ; Ps. 118 (119) :48, ãser ' ahabtî.</page><page sequence="10">The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit 13 for the most part, clear and intelligible, except for one or other verse or stich which the translators themselves characterized as unclear or corrupted in the exegetical notes of the Liber Psalmorum.26 In these cases, which would have called for more energetic remedies to remedy the difficulty, the translators for the most part restricted themselves to the most necessary changes, lest too much of the subjective element enter into a translation which is meant for liturgical use. It is left "for future investigations to shed more light on these points by means of suitable remedies."27 It is evident that in the reconstruction of every text a certain amount of subjectivism has its place : not even the selection from the variants contained in the ancient documents can be made without a personal evaluation, in which there will always be a certain element of subjectivism. But this holds for every reconstruction of an ancient text and, more particularly, for every biblical text, even that of the New Testament, as can be seen in any critical edition. Not even the text which St. Jerome translated was exempt from this subjective element, and this is much more the case with the Massoretic text, which itself is merely a reconstruction of the text made by learned men on the basis of a particular tradition and in conformity with their interpretation. What- ever may be the reconstruction of the text either of the Psalms or of other books of the Bible in the future, it will ever be impossible to elim- inate the subjective element entirely. The important thing is that this be not exaggerated or without objective basis.28 For the rest, the cases in which the reading is still uncertain amount to very few, when com- pared with the entire text and, in the main, have little doctrinal value. Without presumption, it may be stated that the text resulting from this textual criticism is superior both to the Massoretic and to the Septuagint. Only the course of time will show whether, with further studies and new discoveries, it will be possible to arrive at a text more akin to that of the sacred authors themselves. C. - The Translation: Principles and Methods 1. The primary care of the translators had to be and, in fact, was to translate as faithfully as possible the critically established original text. This fidelity, in addition to more general matters, had to extend to such 26 E.g., Liber Psalmorum , p. 107, Ps. 57 (58) :8b, 10; p. 117, Ps. 63 (64) :7 ; p. 127, Ps. 67 (68) :14 ; p. 296, Ps. 140 (141) :6, 7; p. 333, Cant, of Ezechias (Is! 38:10-22) ; p. 343, Cant, of Hab. (3:2-19). 27 In cot id. prccibus , I. c.; Ital. Trans., p. 6. 28 On this point see the judicious remarks of J. Coppens, in Biblica Vol 25 (1944), p. 46 ff.</page><page sequence="11">14 The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit details as the coloring of phrases, the choice of characteristic words, comparisons and metaphors, to the rhythm, to all that gave a special flavor to the sacred text, so that the translation might be a faithful ren- dering of the original text as far as the diversity of the Hebrew and Latin idioms allows. (a) The Septuàgint, and as a result also the ancient Latin translations, did not have the same concept regarding faithfulness to the original text which we moderns have. Thus, for example, the anthropomorphisms with which the original text spoke of God did not prove sympathetic to the Hellenistic taste, and so the Greek translators often substituted weaker expressions. Thus, for example, in Psalm 17 (18) :2, we read in the Vulgate: "Diligam te, Domine, fortitudo mea. Dominus firmamentům meum et refugium meum et liberator meus; Deus meus, adiutor meus, et sperabo in eum; protector meus et cornu salutis meae et susceptor meus." Firmamentům, adiutor, protector, susceptor are all words which have lost their color and are almost abstract. The He- brew, painting in vivid colors, says: petra, arx, rupes, clipeus, praesid- ium . Hence we read : "Diligo te, Domine, fortitudo mea, Domine, petra mea, arx mea, liberator meus, Deus meus, rupes mea, in quam confugio, clipeus meus, cornu salutis meae, praesidium meum." This series of titles, all drawn from real life, is much better suited to the veteran hero David, who in this Psalm is recounting his hard-fought battles and the victories granted him by the God of hosts. - In like manner, in Psalm 3 :4, instead of "Tu autem, Domine, susceptor meus es," the Psalmist, being pursued by many enemies, says: "Tu autem, Domine, clipeus meus es" ; in verse 8 of the same Psalm for the colorless expression "tu percussisti omnes adversaries mihi" the Hebrew text has: ((maxillam percussisti omnium adversantium mihi." - In Psalm 23 (24) :4, the Vul- gate says : "Attollite portas, principes, vestras, et elevamini, portae aeter- nales," whilst the original text addresses, not the "principes," but the gates themselves with strong and vigorous language: "Attolite vos, fores antiquae, et ingrediatur rex gloriae" : the king of glory is so ma- jestic that the gates are too low and must raise their frontais, must be- come higher. With daring anthropomorphism the Psalmist thus pictures the boundless greatness of God, for whom all gates are too low, whatever their height. Here, as in so many other cases, all that is needed to re- store to the text its strength and freshness is to translate faithfully. Of this type are also some texts in which the Psalmist gives ex- pression to his hope and certainty of "seeing the face of God," as in 10 (11) :8 [7] : "recti videbunt faciem eius;" 16 (17) :15: "ego in iustitia videbo faciem tuam ;" 62 (63) :3 : "sic in sanctuario contemplor te." To the</page><page sequence="12">The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit 15 Greek translators the "seeing of the face of God" appeared to be too daring an anthropomorphism; they may also have recalled the pagan custom of showing the statues of their gods at their feasts and proces- sions. At any rate, they changed the relation: it is God who looks at man, no more man who sees God.29 It is evident that a faithful transla- tion must keep to the original text in these and similar cases.29* (b) Again, in not a few cases the Septuagint, and as a result also the Vulgate, have rendered the sense obscure by translating the Hebrew proper names. So, e.g., we read in Psalm 119 (120) :5: "Heu mihi, quia incolatus meus prolongatus est;" the Hebrew says: "Hei mihi, quod dego in Mosoch, habito in tentoriis Cedar," thus expressing real- istically that the Psalmist, pursued by wicked and cruel foes, is like those unfortunate exiles who dwell at a distance from the Holy Land in the far north, Mosoch, Mesek being a district near the Black Sea (cf. Gen. 10:2; Ez. 27:13) or in the desolate Syro-Arabian desert, where dwelt the nomadic Cedarenes. - In Psalm 94 (95) :9 we read with the Vulgate: "Nolite obdurare corda vestra sicut in irritatione (or with the old Latin version: sicut in exacerbatione) secundum diem tentationis in deserto;" the Hebrew text in a more concrete way calls to mind two historical facts: the discontent of the people of Israel with God and with Moses in the desert at Meriba and at Massa: "Nolite obdurare corda vestra ut in Meriba, ut die Massa in deserto." - The exiled Levite in Psalm 41 (42) :7 is not sojourning in "monte modico," but at the northern confines of the Promised Land, at the foot of Mt. Hermon, where still in our days the name Zâfôrâ(h ) recalls the ancient Mis'ār :30 the translation is therefore : "Recordor tui ex terra Iordanis et Hermon, ex monte Misar." In Psalm 21 (22), the Psalmist, in a manner much more concrete than the "tauri pingues" of the Graeco-Latin translators, com- plains of being surrounded by "tauri Basan," which are the most savage 29 For this reason the Vulgate translates 10 (11) :8[7] : "Aequitatem vidit vul- tus eius" ; Ps. 16 (17) : 15 : "ego autem . . . apparebo conspectui tuo" ; Ps. 62 (63) :3 : "sic in sancto apparui tibi." Cf. F. Nötscher, Das Angesicht Gottes schauen (Würzburg: 1924), p. 90 ff. 29aLess clear is the rendering of elohim by ayyeÀoi in Pss. 8:6; 96 (97) :7 ; 137 (138) :1, since elohim denotes not only God Himself but also the spiritual beings who, as it were, form His court. In Ps. 8 the sense is doubtful. Jerome (as also Aq., Sym., Theod. : irapa ôeóv ) translates, "a Deo"; on the other hand, G S Targ. have, "the angels" (Cf. D. Cales, Le livre des Psaumes , I, p. 144). In Ps. 137 (138) the meaning, "angels," seems more probable. Other explanations given by some moderns are less satisfying. In Ps. 96 (97) :7 the context rather suggests the sense, "gods." 30 Cf. G. Dalman, "Zu Psalm 42:7, 8," Pal.-JaJirb. (1909), pp. 101-103.</page><page sequence="13">16 The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit breed of bulls then known in Palestine, being raised on the fertile pas- tures of Basan in the Transjordan. This habit of translating proper names and of avoiding reference of a more definite nature to institutions and customs of the people of Israel, to facts and figures of sacred history, is intelligible and, in a certain measure, allowable when there is question of a translation meant for popular use, as it must be at the same time an interpretation and there- fore avoid expressions and words which are not familiar to the un- lettered. However, in a translation destined for priests who are ac- quainted with sacred history and with the customs and usages of the ancient Israelites this would not be right. For them, it would appear, there is need of exhibiting the Psalms as in their genuine form, thus restoring to them the beauty willed by the Holy Spirit, who inspired the Psalmist and designed the sacred songs to be full of life, bound up with the sacred history of the Old Testament, with the religious notions of the chosen people, and with the land which was the scene of the great miracles of God. Fidelity towards the Holy Spirit, who inspired these sacred pages, makes it a duty for the translator, if he really wishes to be such and not a "traditor," to use the words of St. Jerome, to preserve jealously these treasures of life and poetry. (c) This faithfulness in translating the original text at once does away with a good number of so-called biblical absurdities and of barely in- telligible texts of the Vulgate. "Cum sancto sanctus eris ... et cum perverso perverteris" (Ps. 17 [18] :26 ff) now is: "Erga virum pium ostendis te pium, ergàjntegrum integre agis, erga purum te monstras purum, erga versutum te praebes prudentem," words which describe God's way of dealing with man according to his own way of acting. - "Dixi, nunc coepi: haec mutatio dextrae excelsi" (Ps. 76 [77] :1 1 ) : in the new translation, following all the old versions, except G, the reading is: "Et dico: Hic est dolor meus, quod mutata est dextera Altissimi," i.e., the Psalmist, reflecting on the glorious past and seeing the great evils of the present, is grievously afflicted by the thought that the Lord no longer deals with His people with His pristine benevolence. - In place of "Omnis gloria eius filiae regis ab intus" (Ps. 44 [45] : 14), words which have so often been used by preachers in a sense differing from that of the sacred text, we now say: "Tota decora ingreditur filia regis it is a description of the bridal procession as the bride is conducted in her splendid attire to the palace of the royal bride-groom. - The cele- brated verse: "Accedet homo ad cor altum, et exaltabitur Deus" (Ps. 63 [64] :7 ff) now has lost its puzzling character: the Psalmist is speaking about the enemies who "excogitant nefaria, occultant cogita-</page><page sequence="14">The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit 17 tiones excogitatas et mens cuiusque et cor sunt profunda ; sed Deus ferit eos sagittis." We should not come to an end if we were to enumerate all the texts which are clarified and made intelligible. Even in case the new translation achieved nothing else than to do away with these riddles which interfered so much with the intelligent recitation of the Breviary, the labor of the translators would have a proper reward. 2. - To translate is a difficult and delicate task. A good translator must be well versed both in the original language and in that of the translation. Regarding the Hebrew language it may be said without presumption that great strides have been made during the last century, particularly in the knowledge of Hebrew syntax. St. Jerome, indeed, was great also as a Hebraist and had the help of Hebrew rabbis in his work;31 but we must not forget that in his time scientific Semitic philology had not yet begun, Arabic was as yet hardly known,32 Accadian was unknown; there were no dictionaries, no grammars, no concordances. The work of the learned monk of Bethlehem stands as a grand monument of his linguistic knowledge; yet, like any other human undertaking, it can be improved and has been improved by recent studies of the Hebrew language and of Semitic philology. Many linguistic peculiarities are much better understood today than in the times of St. Jerome. Such is, e.g., the syntax of the tenses of the Hebrew verb. (a) One of the greatest difficulties of the Vulgate is the lack of under- standing of the sense of the tenses in the Hebrew differing, as they do, so completely from those of the Greek and Latin verb. The Seventy translated mechanically, Hebrew Perfect by Greek Perfect, Imperfect or Future in Hebrew by Imperfect or Future in Greek, and were fol- lowed slavishly by the Vulgate. As example we may take the ending of Psalm 64 (65). The Vulgate begins correctly with Perfects : "Visitasti terram et inebriasti earn, multi- plicasti locupletare earn. Flumen Dei repletum est aquis ; parasti cibum illorum; quoniam ita est praeparatio eius." But now follow two Im- peratives, due to a false interpretation of two absolute infinitives: 31 In Ep. 125, 12, PML 22, 1079, he narrates : "cuidam fratri, qui e Hebraeis crediderat, me in disciplinam dedi" ; in Praef. in I. lob , PML 28, 1081 he mentions, "Lyddaeum quendam praeceptorem qui apud Hebraeos primus haberi putabatur"; frequently, also, he commemorates in his Comm. in Ecclen a Hebrew with whom he had read the book, PML 23, 1038, 1048, 1062, etc. ; in his Praef. in l. Paralipģ, PML 29, 402, he recounts: "De Tiberiade Legis quendam doctorem assumpsi, et contuli cum eo a vertice, ut aiunt, lisque ad extremum unquem." 32 In the Praef. in l. lob , PML 28, 1081, Jerome says that he interpreted the book "ex ipso hebraico arabicoque sermone, et interdum syro." On the words peculiar to the Book of Job, whose roots are found in Arabic, cf. Dhorme, Le livre de lob (Paris: 1926), p. cxli.</page><page sequence="15">18 The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit "Rivos eius inebria, multiplica genimina eius." Then, as in the Hebrew, there follows the Future: "in stillicidiis eius laetabitur germinans," so also in w. 12 and 13. Verse 14 returns with the Hebrew to the Perfect : "induti sunt arietes ovium," continuing, for the same reason, in the Future: "et valles abundabunt frumento." It is quite clear that this translation can give us no proper idea of the true sense of the strophe : it does not appear whether we have to do with prayer or prophecy or thanksgiving. The new translation, taking account of the syntax of the verbal tenses, translates as follows: "Visitasti terram et irrigasti earn, multum locupletasti earn. Rivus Dei repletus est aquifc, parasti frumentum eorum; ita enim parasti earn: Sulcos eius irrigasti, complanasti glaebas eius Imbribus earn mollisti, benedixisti germini eius. Coronasti annum benignitate tua, et semitae tuae pinguedinem stillant. Stillant pascua deserti, et colles exultatione se cingunt. Vestiuntur gregibus arva, et valles operiuntur frumento: acclamant et cantant." In this translation the Latin Perfects ("visitasti" etc.) express a series of past actions of the divine generosity, whilst the Presents ("stillant," "acclamant," etc.) express the enduring effects, in accordance with the syntax of the Hebrew tenses. It is evident, therefore, that this splendid poem is a chant of thanksgiving, and not a prayer or even a prophecy. (b) Besides this special sense of the verbal tenses, there are also a goodly number of other Semitisms or Hebraisms in the Psalms which interfere with the understanding of the text or change its sense, either because of an imperfect knowledge of the language or because the trans- lation was made too slavishly. These errors then passed over into the Vulgate. In the Vulgate we read (Ps. SS [56] :5) : "In Deo laudabo sermones meos ... (v. 5). In Deo laudabo verbum; in Domino laudabo sermonem, in Deo speravi" (v. 11). In this Psalm the Psalmist is giving expression to his confidence amid his afflictions and trials, and, therefore, we find it difficult to understand how he could speak of the praise of his words. The difficulty is easily solved if we look upon the</page><page sequence="16">The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit 19 words "laudare sermonem" as a relative asyndetic expression, such as often occurs in the most elegant prose :33 "In Deo, cuius, celebro verbum (promissum) in Deo confido, non timebo: quid faciet mihi homo?" We may pass over other cases of the same kind, since they are well known to all who have occupied themselves with the latinity o£ the Vulgate: such, e.g., are the double expression of the relative, the prep- ositions a or ex in place of the comparative, the feminine relative instead of the neuter, the preposition in employed to express instrument. A translator from the Hebrew in our days would not think of imitating such constructions and expressions. Yet St. Jerome, whose fine linguistic sense certainly sensed the incongruity of such expressions and, at least partially, avoided them in his Psalterium iuxta Hebraeos, preserved them conscientiously in the Gallicanum. It will surprise no one that they have disappeared in the new translation. 3. - It is well known to all that St. Jerome knew the Latin language well, as a simple reading of his letters will show, and that he sought ele- gance of style and beauty of language in his writings, brought up as he had been in the school of the foremost Latin writers. "Eadem interpre- tandi sequenda est regula," says he, "ut ubi non sit damnum in sensu linguae, in quam transferimus, euphonia et proprietas conservetur." And elsewhere : "Et nos hoc sequimur, ut ubi nulla est de sensu mutatio, Latini sermonis elegantiam conservemus."34 It would, therefore, be presumptuous to aim at outdoing the Holy Doctor in the Latin language and style. But it must be borne in mind that St. Jerome was not at full liberty to follow his linguistic and rhetorical bent in his translation of the Sacred Scriptures. This was particularly true in the case of the Psalms, whose text was so familiar to the faithful of the Latin tongue that, the translator had perforce to forego making too many changes and to rest satisfied with retaining much .of the Old Latin version then in use. He says himself : "Et nos emendantes olim Psalterium, ubi sensus idem est, veterum interpretům consuetudinem mutare noluimus, ne nimia novitāte lectoris studium terreremus."35 Two examples will be sufficient to illustrate his mode of procedure in the translation of the Psalms. In the other books of the Old Testa- ment he replaced "hereditäre" and "hereditas" of the Old Latin version by "possidere," "possessio," which are better suited to the sense of the 33 Cf. Joiion, Gramm. Hebr., 158 a, b. 34 Ep. 106 ad Sunniam et Fretelam, nn. 55, 54, PML 22, 857, 856 ; cf. F. Cavai - lera, Saint Jerome ( Louvain- Paris : 1921), Vol. I, 1, pp. 6-10; A. Vaccari, S.

In the Psalms, however, he kept "hereditäre" and "hered- itas," as he did also the word "salutaris" in place of "salvator" in the New Testament.36 This shows that the criteria of the Saint were not entirely linguistic but considerations of a practical nature. These were then of great weight, as numerous criticisms and attacks made on him show, but are today of no importance.30* The translators were, there- fore, obliged to face the problem of the Latin to be used in a modern translation of the Psalms, despite the well-known and undoubted lin- guistic ability of St. Jerome. (a) The opinions expressed during the last decades had been quite diverse. Some pleaded zealously for the ecclesiastical Latin, among them Herkenne,37 who, for historical reasons, was for the vulgar Latin employed by the Christians of the first centuries. Coppens was of the same mind, saying: "Fidelity to the Graeco-Latin text which we rec- ommend will keep us from introducing into the Psalter corrections of vocabulary, of grammar and of style which would have no other aim than to clothe the Psalms in a purer Latin language, so as to bring them closer to the classical models, be these of the ancients or of the human- ists."38 Others, however, were inclined towards a more choice and classical latinity.39 This view certainly recommends itself for prac- tical purposes: during their years of study our future priests master the Latin of the authors of the last century before Christ and the first two after the birth of the Savior. A Latin translation of the Psalms which, barring certain strictly ecclesiastical expressions, would keep to the vocabulary, the grammar and the style of the better period of the Latin language would surely be better understood and valued than another which has many elements of the vulgar and later Latin. Nor is it strictly correct that the Church has a preference for the vulgar Latin. Those parts of the Vulgate which St. Jerome has translated more care- fully from the Hebrew, such as Genesis, are clothed in a latinity which 36 Cf. W. Matzkow, De vocabulis quibusdam Italae et Vulgatae christianis (Berolini : 1933), pp. 45 ff ; 18-25. 3®a Cf. Cavallera, Saint Jerome ( Louvain- Paris : 1922), Vol. I, 2, pp. 103-113. On this point his controversy with St. Augustine is characteristic {Id., op. cit., I, 1, pp. 297-306; J. Schmid, SS. Eus. Hieronymi et Aur.

That the language of the Psalms of the Vulgate differs so much from this model is by no means a thing to be prized; St. Jerome did not look upon it as such. It is rather a defect kept in the Gallican Psalter for practical reasons, flow- ing partly from an excessively slavish translation of the Greek and partly from the ecclesiastical conditions of the first centuries, which were any- thing but literary. There is no apparent reason, therefore, when con- ditions have completely changed, for preserving such an idiom at the price of clarity and intelligibility. A few examples will make this clear. Ps. 95 (96) :6 of the Vulgate says : "Confessio et pulchritudo in conspectu eius, sanctimonia et mag- nificentia in sanctificatione eius." The word confessio will be treated later. Sanctimonia is a Ciceronian word but is rare and does not give accurately the Hebrew 'õz "force," "power sanctificatio in the context must mean sanctuary, thus being entirely different from the word which signifies the action of sanctifying. Three words, therefore, in Latin hinder the understanding of this short verse in the Hebrew text. We would, therefore, be called upon to preserve so faulty a translation, merely for some historical reason, in spite of the fact that the true sense can be given in a transparently clear Latin : "Maiestas et decor praece- dunt eum ; potentia et splendor sunt in sede sancta eius." We may call to mind such words as the following : subsannare, a word of the vulgar Latin and rarely used before the time of St. Jerome for irridere; 40 abusio, i.e., contemptus (30 [31] :19) ;41 assnmptio = protectio (in Hebrew "clip- eus," 88 [89] :19) ; susceptio capitis = galea, 107 (108) :9; in the cor- responding text 59 (60) the Gallican has fortitudo ; signi ficatio (59 [60] :6) = signum, vexilliim; singularis ferus,42 79 (80) :14, to render the Hebrew ziz, animal, bestia; sanctitudo for sanctitas or sanctuarium; salutare instead of salus; salutaris instead of salvator; praeparatio 40 Jerome seems to have a certain predilection for subsannare and subsannatio, which he uses even where they do not occur in the most ancient Psalters. Cf. A. Vaccari, "Senecia" in Arch. Lat. Med. Aevi , Vol. 16 (1941), p. 159; A. Allgeier, Die altlateinischen Psalterien (Freiburg: 1928), p. 181. 41 Cf. A. Allgeier, "In superbia et abusione," Biblica , Vol. 15 (1934), pp. 185-212. 42 "Singularis" is a literal translation of the Greek /xoVtoç (solitary, savage) found in G. The word, which in this text occurs in all the ancient Latin versions (Cf. Allgeier, Die altlat. Psalt, p. 180) has passed from the vulgar Latin into Italian (cinghiale) and French (sanglier). Cf. Du Cange, Glossarium , s.v.; Arch . glottoL ital., Vol. 13 (1892-1894), p. 121.</page><page sequence="19">22 The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit (sedis) = fundamentum (throni) (88 [89] :15) ; other cases are very numerous in which St. Jerome made his choice, not to give expression to any particular nuance of a Hebrew word, but for reasons entirely independent of the sacred text.43 Should we interfere with under- standing prayer by such words and expressions without any compen- sating profit ? (b) For the rest, this new translation was not meant to serve the interests of science in the first place, but rather was intended, primarily, for practical use by priests. For this reason it had to express the mean- ing of the original text in smooth, clear and correct Latin, as far as a translation would permit. It is, indeed, true that the latinity of a translation can never aspire to the perfection and purity which belongs to original compositions. It is, no doubt, true, as St. Jerome writes: "Non debemus impolita nos verborum interpretatione torquere, cum damnum non sit in sensibus, quia unaquaeque lingua . . . suis proprie- tatibus loquitur."44 On the other hand, it is equally true what the same holy Doctor says: "Difficile est, alienas lineas insequentem non alicubi excidere; arduum ut, quae in aliena lingua bene dicta sunt, eundem decorem in translatione conservent moreover, a translation by Cicero himself, according to St. Jerome, is such, "ut qui interpretata nesciant, a Cicerone dicta non credant."45 And now, when there is question, as in the present case, not of a book of any type, but of an inspired book, the prayer book of the Church, then there are some additional consid- erations which we cannot overlook. Here there is call for a simple and easy style, one suited to the tradition of Church language, one fitted to express exactly the doctrine and the religious notions of the inspired book änd at the same time suited for fluent recitation in choir. Hence the task was to harmonize different viewpoints and to discover a latinity which would conform to the best periods of that language and at the same time would not be out of harmony with the liturgical books of the Church. (c) Relying on these principles, the translators, without being too rigorous when there was questions of words that were hard to replace in their context,46 omitted a number of words which do not occur in 43 A great number of these words is common to all the ancient versions ; hence they have been preserved rather than chosen by Jerome. Cf. the relevant vocab- ulary composed by Allgeier, Die altlat . Psalt., pp. 137-187. 44 Ep. 106, ad Sunniam et Fretelam , n. 30, PML 22, 847. 45 S. Hier . Praef. in Chron. Euseb., PML 27, 34 ff. 46 E.g., the word, "tribulatio," which Jerome uses almost invariably to render the Hebrew, $ar or fctrah, in many cases has been replaced by "angustia (e) " ; in</page><page sequence="20">The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit 23 authors of the last centuries before Christ and first two after His birth ; the same is true of words used in a sense differing from that of later times, or of foreign, especially Greek, words. For such reasons such words as the following are absent: abyssus, aeternalis, amodo, beneplacitum, confiteor and confessio (in the sense of thanking or praising), convallis, directum (in the sense of planus), ecclesia (coetus, conventus), elevo and elevatio, elong o , episcopatus (munus), er emus, eructo (effundo, eloquor), evangelizo (annuntio), exalto , extermino (deleo, destruo), fumigo, glorifico, honorífico, hu - milio, illuminatio (sc. vultus), incolatns, iubilare, iubilatio and iubilum, iustificatio (= praeceptum, lex), luminare (lumen, sidus), memoriale, mirifico, morticinium, mortifico, numquid, oper or (iniqua, miracula, etc.), organum, plasma, prosperor, quoadusque, rhamnus, sanctificatio and sanctificium, subsannatio and subsanno, topazion, unicornis, usque - quo, vivifico, etc. To replace these and other similar words and expressions choice was made preferably of such as occurred in other books of the Old and New Testaments as also in the liturgical books of the Church. Thus m Ps. 26 (27) :1 the obscure "Dominus illuminatio mea " is replaced by "Dominus lux mea," an exact translation of the Hebrew 'ort which brings to mind that the Lord is " lux vera quae illuminât omnem horninám" (John 1:9). In Ps. 66 (67) :2, where the Vulgate has: "illuminet vultum suum super nos," the reading now is: "serenum praebeat nobis vultum suum," thus alluding to the Canon of the Mass : "Supra quae sereno vultu respicere digneris" (cf. 79:4; 118:135). For the word vivificare, which seems to have come into the ecclesiastical lan- guage from the popular Latin, there is substituted, according as the con- text calls for, "vitam dare" (tribuerç, largiri, reddere) (118 [119] :25, 37, 40, 50, 93, 149, 154, 156; 1 Sam. 2:6) ; "vitam servare" (40 [41] :2; 79 [80] :19; 118 [119] :88, 107, 159; 137 [138] :7; 142 [143] :11 ; Is. 38:16) ; "vitam restituere" (84 [85] :7). So also in the New Testament the Savior promises: "Ego vitam aeternam dabo eis" (John 10:28; Acts 17:25; 1 John 5:11). - In conformity with these criteria also the word confiteri, which is found about 65 times in the Psalms, five times in Isaias and five times in the New Testament with the meaning praise, celebrate, other instances, however, in which the tribulations were not primarily material but rather spiritual, the word "tribulatio," was retained; the verb, "tríbulo" was kept much more rarely, since the idea can be expressed easily by other words. Often also the word, "eloquium" was preserved in the sense of "word" "revelation," be- cause it expresses better the notion of God manifesting Himself in speech to men than the simple terms, "sermo" or "verbum."</page><page sequence="21">24 The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit render thanks , as also the corresponding noun confessio (eight times in the Pss.), has been replaced. There is question here of a Greek ex- pression which is the result of too literal a translation of the Greek èÇofiokoytîaôai of the Septaugint ; this is a rather unhappy translation of the Hebrew hôdã(h) which has the meanings "confiteri" (v.g. sins), "celebrare," "gratias referre." "Confiteri" in the sense "celebrate," "thank" never became fully domesticated in Church Latin except in strictly biblical texts. St. Auugstine complains repeatedly that the people on hearing the word confiteri , thought instantly of the confession of sins : "Continuo iam consuetudine sic intellegendi (sc., of the confession of sins) manus currunt ad pectus tundendum; usque adeo non soient homines intellegere confessionem nisi peccatorum."47 Also the diction- aries of medieval Latin make it clear that this word, in the sense of "praising," never came into popular use. The word, therefore, in this meaning had not become naturalized in Church Latin and was elim- inated after mature reflection and deliberation. In its place came "cele- brare" which occurs several times in the Old Testament with the sense "praise" and is found also in the liturgy (cf. "Te, Ioseph, celebrent . . ."). In other Psalms, where the sense and context demand it, the expression "gratias agere" is employed, which is often used in the letters of St. Paul and is familiar to all because of the liturgy. Hence Psalm 117 (118) "Confitemini Domino" now begins : "Gratias agite Domino, quia bonus est." Also in the matter of syntax the translators preferred the better pe- riods of latinity. So, for example, it is said more correctly: " Hie est dies, quem fecit Dominus (117 [118] :24) ; "conteret die irae suae . . (109 [110] :5) ; "benedico Domino" (IS [16] :7, etc.). Instead of the negative imperative (Vulgate : "ne facias") the ne with subjunctive of the Perfect is regularly used ("ne feceris") or noli with the infinitive ("noli facere"). - Doubt might arise respecting the prepositions de- pending on the verba sentiendi et dicendi ; almost regularly in the Psalms and the other books the Vulgate has the particles quod , quia , quoniam; rarely, indeed, is the accusative with infinitive found (e.g., Lk. 24:23; "dicunt eum vivere;" Acts 14:18 "aestimantes eum mortuum esse;" 27:13: "astimantes propositum se tenere;" cf. Rom. 2:19; Phil. 3:13; Deut. 4:26). It might, therefore, seem that we were dealing with a construction proper to the ecclesiastical Latin. However, this is not the case. Till the time of St. Augustine the accusative with the infinitive was the most common construction; even Tertullian, has a great pref- 47 In Ps. 137, n. 2, PML 37, 1774 ; cf.

It is quite significant that in nearly all the cases where the accusative with infinitive is found in the Vulgate also the Greek text has an infinitive. In the ecclesiastical writers the quod, quia, quoniam are most common in their quotations of biblical texts, less so in their own compositions.49 There exists no special reason, therefore, to maintain the use of quod, quia, quoniam in a new translation, and the translators follow the better tradition of ecclesiastical authors in preferring the accusative with the infinitive: they say "Credo visurum me bona Domini in terra viventium" (Ps. 26 [27] :13) ; they say in the Canticle of Moses (Deut. 32:36) : "Quando videbit lassari manus et deficere servos et liberos," in place of "Videbo quod infirmata sit manus" as St. Jerome did.50 What has been said above about translating the Hebrew hõdâh (Vulg., "confiteri") sometimes as "celebrare," sometimes as "gratias agere," makes clear that the translators do not keep to the inflexible rule of rendering the same Hebrew word in all cases with the identical Latin word; rather they follow the rule of St. Jerome of translating "non verba, sed sententias."51 As the same Hebrew word might have different shades of meaning in different contexts, it is the task of translators to make choice of that precise Latin word which suits the context best. The Hebrew word hèsed, which in the Vulgate is consistently rendered by "misericordia," may mean "misericordia," "gratia," "caritas," "benignitas." For this reason we say in Psalm 102 (103) :4: "qui coronat te gratia et miserai ione but in v. 11 "praevalet misericordia eius," where there is question of the forgiveness of sins; Ps. 88 (89) :1 : "Gratias Domini in aeternum cantabo," the Psalm being a proclamation 48 Cf. Thes. Ling. Lat. s.v. "dico," III C 2; F. Kaulen, Geschichte der Vulgata (Mainz: 1868), p. 139. In Tertullian, outside of biblical texts, the particles quod , quia , quoniam are found 74 times, the acc. with the inf. 2500 times; in Cyprian: the particles 66 times, the accus, w. the inf. 638 times (Cf. J. Bonaccorsi, .Psalterium Latinum , I, Flor.: 1914, p. 38). Accordingly, an increasing preference for the particles is discernible, i.e., an ever greater influence of the vulgar Latin, which ultimately prevailed altogether, as is shown by the neo-Latin languages. 49 Thus, e.g., Tertullian in his biblical citations uses the acc. w. the inf. only 44 times, the particles quod and quia 61 times. Cf. Bonaccorsi, /. c. 50 In some cases the use of the acc. w. the inf. would have resulted in a some- what heavy and complicated sentence; hence a paratactic construction was pre- ferred, e.g., Ps. 118 ( 119) :159 : "Vide, praecepta tua diligo, Domine"; Ps. 134 (135) :5: "Novi equidem hoc: magnus est Dominus." 51 Ep. 57 Ad Pammachitim ("De optimo genere interpretanda'), n. 6: "Hoc tantum probare voluerim me semper ab adolescentia non verba sed sententias trans- tulisse."

The word yësa(, from the root yãsa', is rendered not merely as "salus," but fol- lowing the context, also as "auxilium" or "victoria." When, however, no special reasons due to context are found, the same word is commonly translated in an identical manner. The Hebrew rďsď, "malefactor," "impious" is translated in the Vulgate 66 times by "pec- cator," fifteen times by "impius," whilst hattď, "sinner," is translated three times as "peccator" and twice as "impius." In the new transla- tion, keeping close to the root signification of the Hebrew, räsä' is ordi- narily translated by "impius," hattď by "peccator," barring the cases where the context requires other words. Here, therefore, the trans- lators observe a rule of translation of modern times which is the opposite of that followed by St. Jerome. In order to satisfy the demands of the rhetoric of his times he changed expressions as much as possible instead of giving the meaning of a word in its context as accurately as possible. So, for example, the name 'êdâ(h) "congregatio" in Num. 16, where it occurs twelve times, is translated by synagoga, multitudo, concilium, populus, frequentia populi, globus, congregatio, universus populus, turba*2 The new translation, contrary to the rules of ancient and modern style, uses the word "pauper" three times in Ps. 71 (12) :12 ff : "Etenim liberabit pauperem invocantenvet miserum, cui non est adiutor. Mis- erebitur inopis et pauperis, et vitam pauperum salvabit." This happens because the original text, certainly not without a purpose, has the word 'ebybn three times. For the same cause the Hebrew w ' (et) is nearly always translated by the particle et, whereas in a work composed origi- nally in Latin a proper variation should be observed by employing also the particles ac, atque, que, and other suitable constructions. 4. - The inclination to come as near as possible to the classical ideal still had to be checked by certain bounds which could not be crossed, unless the work in hand was td suffer damage. (a) First of all, it had to be borne in mind that the Christian revela- tion had many concepts and matters peculiar to itself, for which no ade- quate expressions are found in the Latin language, being foreign to the thought and the life of Pagan Rome. We may not agree with St. Gregory when he says : "Indignum vehementer existimo, ut verba caelestis oraculi restringam sub regulis Donati" ;52a but still what St. Jerome wrote to Pope Damasus remains true: "In ecclesiasticis rebus non quaerantur 52 Cf.

Moreover, even strict upholders of classical Latin are forced to concede that also such words must be acknowledged as "classical" which express ideas for which no term existed during the classical period. "We judge," say the editors of the Antibarbarus, "that, when there is question of distinctly Christian ideas of the Sacred Scriptures, the terms coined for them by the Vulgate and by the Fathers of the western Church must be looked upon as classical."58 Also the Fathers of the Latin Church lay stress on this, even though they themselves attended the schools of the grammarians and rhetoricians and they themselves are distinguished for the greatest purity of language and style. So St. Augustine notes with the greatest acuteness in regard to the non- classical Salvator : "Salvator: hoc enim latine est Iesus. Nec quaerant grammatici quam sit latinům, sed Christiani quam verum. Salus enim latinům nomen est. Salvare et salvator: non fuerunt haec latina, ante- quam veniret Salvator : - quando ad latinos venit, et haec latina fecit."54 The word düectio, which is often used by St. Jerome in his translation both of the Old and of the New Testament and in our days is indispens- able in Christian terminology, came into the Latin language only when the one had come who gave to love of the neighbor a new standard and the most sublime dignity by His statement: "No one has greater love than that he lay down his life for his friends" (Jo. IS :13).55 Outside of biblical texts, it is found first in Tertullian, who, likewise, wishing to express the idea of a hope which gives itself up entirely to the goodness and fidelity of God, employes the expression : " sperare ( fidere ) in Dom- inum"** So also the word gratia takes on its proper meaning of a 52b Ep. 21 ad Damasum, n. 42, PML 22, 94. 53 Krebs-Schmalz, Antibarbarus der lat.

In the classics the verb diligo is used less frequently than its synonym amo ; in Tertullian diligo predominates notably ( amo 13 times, diligo 85 times) as well as in the Vulgate ( amo 49, diligo 339). In classic latinity amare is stronger than diligere ; quite the contrary is true of ecclesiastical Latin. Cf. Thes. ling, lat., V, 1, 1176 ff, s.v., "diligo." In the new version diligo, which is found 40 times in the Vulgate Psalter, has been retained except in seven instances. 86 Contra Marc., 2, 19, PML 2, 334.</page><page sequence="25">28 The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit favor of God to men in the Christian Latin of the Old Latin translation and in that of the ecclesiastical writers since Tertullian.57 It would be a mistaken idea to exclude from the Latin text of the Psalms these and similar words, simply because they are not Ciceronian; this would deprive the translation of that religious character which is the most sublime and most precious element of the sacred poetry of the Old Testament. (b) No less grave were the reasons for keeping in the Psalms, also in this new translation, its character of Oriental and Semitic poetry, that Semitic coloring which sets it off from Greek, Latin and modern poetic compositions. It was explained above (p. 21 f) how certain Hebraisms and Semitisms were avoided which, being too far removed from our present mode of expression, would render the understanding of the text difficult. But there are others which are readily understood and are entirely familiar, be it from the liturgy or from the New Testament. There is no difficulty in grasping the meaning of "Deus iustitiae," "Deus salutis meae," "ambulare in via Domini;" even such an expression as "cornu sąlutis" presents no excessive difficulty, once the meaning of the Hebrew qèren, &lt;łcornu" has been explained. Even the absolute infini- tive with a verb of the same stem, which is often employed in Hebrew in order to express an emphatic statement or a shade of meaning which implies that a certain thing should or might be done, could be rendered in Latin by means of properly chosen adverbs. So the qawwô(h) qiwwîtî of Psalm 39:2(40) (Vulgate: "exspectans exspectavi") could properly be translated : "firmiter speravi." But the translators preferred to say : "sper- avi, speravi in Domino," imitating in a degree the Hebraism ; similarly in Psalm 117 (118) : "Castigavit, castigavit me Dominus" (v. 18), pulsus, impulsus sum ut caderem" (v. 13) ; in Psalm 125 (126) :6, the "euntes eunt" and "venientes venient" of St. Jerome are retained, being so well fitted to the idea the Psalmist expressed that they wept as they went and rejoiced as they returned. By means of such Semitisms and the careful preservation of the metaphors and figures characteristic of Hebrew poetry, it is hoped that, together with the smooth and simple Latin which conforms to the simple character of the original Hebrew, the new translation will retain that coloring which the Psalms have received from their native land and from that people which the divine wisdom had chosen to be the medium of divine revelation for the world and the pro- genitor of the Redeemer. 5. - All are in agreement, be they Catholic or non-Catholic, Hebrews 57 Thes. ling, lat., Vol. VI, 2, 2, pp. 2226-2232, s.v., "gratia" (Pars II, "gratia apud Christianos" I).</page><page sequence="26">The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit 29 or pagans, in extolling the poetic beauty and the artistic worth of the Psalms. Here we have a perfection which the Holy Spirit, who is the source of all created beauty, has willed to bestow on the religious songs of the Old Testament by choosing as instruments such outstanding poets as David and the other authors of the Psalms. A faithful translation, therefore, has the task to show forth properly also these poetic treasures, such as poetical metaphors, stichs, strophes, refrains, and other devices, no less than the poetic and exalted language of the sacred text. (a) Of the extraneous elements the most evident and common, one almost characteristic, is the so-called parallelism, of which mention was made before. The new edition of the Psalter has not merely emphasized this by the stichic arrangement in the printing but on many occasions has restored it where textual corruption or a faulty tradition had ob- scured it. So in Psalm 21 (22) :11 ff, the Vulgate says: "In te proiectus sum ex utero; de ventre matris meae Deus meus es tu: Ne discesseris a me quoniam tribulatio próxima est, quoniam non est qui adiuvet." In the new translation we read instead: "Tibi traditus sum inde ab ortu, ab utero matris meae Deus meus es tu. Ne longe steteris a me, quoniam tribulor; prope asto, quia non est adiutor." The com- plete parallelism was achieved by a simple change of the Massoretic punctuation and by taking the form q'rôbâ(h) as an imperative with paragogic Hč.57a Just as parallelism divides the verse into two stichs, so also, as a rule, an entire composition in Hebrew poetry is separated into strophes . Much has been written about the laws of Hebrew strophic structure but up to the present no theory so far proposed has been generally accepted. Leaving the decision regarding the value of these theories for another occasion, the translators have, in the main, kept to the criterion which by general consent is conceded to be the surest in this connection, that of the meaning. In many Psalms this leads to most assured results. So in Psalm 2, where the change in persons clearly divides it into four strophes, and in Psalm 22 (23) where the situation is radically different in w. 1-4 and 5-6. Even the difficult Psalm 67 (68) is divided into clearly marked strophes which, lacking a strictly logical nexus, still ex- hibit the various phases of the triumphal procession of the Lord, as it were, in animated pictures. At other times the strophic construction manifests itself by unmistakable extrinsic criteria, as is the case with the repetition in Psalm 45 (46), where every strophe ends with the words: "Dominus exercituum nobiscum; praesidium nobis est Deus Iacob" ; "a Q'robah, is a pausai form for qörbah (Cf. Ps. 68 [69] :19). Cf. Bauer-Le- ander, Hist. Gramm, d. ìtebr. Sprache (Halle: 1916), 41, n. o.</page><page sequence="27">30 The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit or in the Psalm 76 (77) : "Deus, restitue nos, et serenum praebe vultum tuum, ut salvi simus."58 Manifestly, there can not be certainty in all cases in distinguishing the strophes, and the translators admit quite freely that here and there other divisions than the one chosen could be proposed. But not even in these cases of doubt dici they wish to forego the strophic arrangement which, at the very least, is always an excellent means for grasping the sense of the Psalms better as well as the progress of ideas.69 There remain certain other elements proper to Hebrew poetry, as al- phabetic structure, anaphora and epiphora, repetition, etc. The Liber Psalmorum has exhibited also these, either by its arrangement in the printing or by a translation which carefully reproduces the impression made by the original text. It was particularly the figure of anaphora which required particular attention on not a few occasions. Thus in Psalm 12 (13) :2, 3, it strongly expresses the thoughts of the Psalmist, who, tormented by his foes, cries out with sobs to the Lord, who appears to have forgotten him; four times he repeats the sonorous 'ad-ânâ(h), "quousque." The Vulgate translates the third 'ad-ânâ(h) with "quam- diu," the other three with "usquequo," thus losing much of the empha- sis. The new translation carefully follows the Hebrew when it says: " Quousque , Domine? oblivisceris me omnino? quousque abscondes faciem tuam a me? Quousque volvam dolores in anima mea, maerorem in corde meo cotidie? Quousque se extollet inimicus meus super me? respice, exaudi me, Domine, Deus meus." In a splendid manner Psalm 92 (93) :3,4, paints with the same poetic figure the mighty waves of the sea which break in greatest tumult on the shore: nase'û nekārot Yahwe(h) nās'u n'hārot qôlãm, yis'û n'hārot dokyãm. Here also the new translation tries to reproduce the impressive onomatopoea of the original: "Extollunt flumina, Domine, extollunt ilumina vocem suam, extollunt flumina fragorem suum." (b) More important than these external matters are the power and 58 The refrain also divides the first part of Ps. 106 (107) :4-32 into four strophes, which are of unequal length. In each strophe the description of misfor- tune is followed by the refrain: "Et clamaverunt ad Dominum in angustiis suis; a tribulationibus eorum eripuit eos." After one verse (in the fourth strophe, after two), which recounts the deliverance, the second part of the refrain is added: "Gratias agant Domino pro misericordia eius et pro mirabilibus erga filios hominum." In the Psalter of 1911, the Psalm is divided less felicitously, because its structure was not taken into account. 59 The division into strophes is an excellent means to understand the sense and structure of a psalm ; hence even in the liturgical edition strophes are distinguished from one another by the addition of a small line ( - ) .</page><page sequence="28">The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit 31 the sublimity of poetic language itself, the beauty of the figures and metaphors, which are characteristic of Hebrew poetry and give it that great poetic value which has been admired and praised by all and at all times. The translators had a rather difficult objective and task before them, and one that involved considerable labor. They sought to pre- serve for the Psalms also in their Latin dress the noble quality which has been described and give a suitable and adequate idea of it, at the same time not failing in absolute faithfulness to the text itself and not gliding into a pretentious poetic style which would smack more of the profane than of the ecclesiastic and sacred. There were so many splen- did passages which, as it were, urged them on to an elevated poetical translation. Thus, for example, when the people of Israel, meditating upon the past, describes the trials which it has undergone (Ps. 128 [129] : 1-4) : "Multum oppugnaverunt me a iuventute mea, dicat nunc Israel : Multum oppugnaverunt me a iuventute mea, sed non devicerunt me. Supra dorsum meum araverunt aratores, longos duxerunt sulcos suos. Dom- inus autem iustus concidit funes impiorum." Again, when in Psalm 129 (130) that patient hope of the people of the Lord is described: "Spero in Dominum, sperat anima mea in verbum eius ; Exspectat anima mea Dominum, magis quam custodes auroram. Magis quam custodes auroram, exspectet Israel Dominum, quia penes Dominum misericordia et copiosa penes eum redemptio." More impressive are the frequent descriptions of the apparitions of God, more especially of God showing himself in the wonderful phe- nomena of nature. An example occurs in the terrifying storm described in Psalm 28 (29) where the word qôl, "vox," repeated seven times, is like a peal of thunder, falling with tremendous power upon the ears of terrified man. The scene of the theophany of Psalm 17 (18) :8-16 is almost breath-taking with its overwhelming power and its violence; however the scene changes in a surprising way and we behold God on high stretching forth His almighty right hand in order to draw back the Psalmist from the abyss which was about to engulf him (w. 17-20). The description of the grandeur and the terrifying majesty of the divine judge as given in the Canticle of Habacuc (3:3-15) is even more sub- lime. Faced by such poetry, the translator becomes discouraged and is apprehensive lest he diminish its sublimity and its beauty, not to speak of the hope of rendering it perceptible in a Latin translation. Still he is filled with the wish and feels the duty of disclosing these treasures of beauty to the many who daily recite these Psalms and seek in them not alone devotion and consolation, but also the spiritual joy which the</page><page sequence="29">32 The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit Holy Spirit wishes to impart to men through this sublime poetry. It will be the task of others to judge how far the new translation has succeeded in interpreting this poetic beauty, which in the translation of the Vulgate is often buried under the debris of misunderstanding and of highly un- suited words. From what has been said it becomes clear that the trans- lators were at least aware of their great undertaking and had a mind to accomplish it : "in magnis et voluisse sat est." % * * * * What has so far been explained will give some idea of the various factors which have to be considered by any one who sets about making a new translation of the Psalms for liturgical use. Likewise, it will show how complicated the work is, particularly when different criteria inter- fere with each other. At first sight, it might appear that much of the an- cient Vulgate could have been retained altogether, in a much greater measure than has actually been done. But, when setting about their labors, the translators soon were made aware that when one stone was removed in a verse, the whole house soon began to give way : you change the tense of a verb and the rhythm of the whole verse is destroyed, so that it cannot be restored except by changing this, that, and the other ex- pression or by inverting the order of the words. Even though there were no other fact of experience than this one, we would have enough to show how difficult, nay impossible, it would be in practice to carry out the suggestion made by not a few merely to touch up the Vulgate, making corrections where needed and retaining the rest. The outcome would have been a text which was neither that of the ancient Vulgate nor a faithful translation of the original text. With regard to this latter point, it must not be forgotten, as was remarked judiciously in the Motu Proprio, In cotidianis precibus, that, though St. Jerome had "nothing more in mind than to improve the Latin text (of the Old Latin version then in use) according to the more correct Greek codices," still "he did not succeed in finding a remedy for all the obscurities and defects of that Latin version." Merely to have retouched the Vulgate might have done away with a certain number of less accurate expressions or even such as were erroneous, but would not have brought out clearly the mean- ing of the original text, such as it was willed and expressed by the Holy Spirit. Much less would it have expressed the shades of meaning in the phrases, the vigor and power of diction, the artistic beauty of the poetic language. Neither would it have been a satisfactory solution to touch up the 59a/w cotidianis precibus , I. c.</page><page sequence="30">The New Psalter: Its Origin and Spirit 33 Psalterium iuxta Hebraeos of St. Jerome, as others suggested. The pur- pose which actuated the great monk of Bethlehem when he made that translation differed entirely from the desires expressed in recent times. He had in view, first of all, to furnish the Church with a text that would serve the needs of apologists in their controversies with the Hebrews. The text, therefore, must, above all, not differ essentially from the He- brew text as it was then used by the rabbinical doctors. The other as- pects of the question did not claim his interest in any marked way and many of the imperfections of the Vulgate remain also in the translation iuxta Hebraeos™ For this reason this version, in spite of its supreme importance for textual criticism and for the history of the Hebrew lan- guage, even though it were retouched and corrected, would certainly not satisfy the needs of our times.61 The needs of the priests of our times called for a Latin text of the Psalms which would not make the understanding of the meaning diffi- cult and would serve for devout prayer. For this there was need of a new translation made in conformity with the true conditions of our knowl- edge of the Hebrew language, according to textual criticism and the laws which govern the art of ancient Semitic poetry, and according to the prin- ciples of the modern technique of translation. The only way of solving the problem, which had been pressing for centuries and had been felt most keenly by priests of our time, was to follow along the path out- lined. This problem arose from the fact that in the daily recitation of the Breviary priests were obliged to employ a text which was so very often obscure and frequently unintelligible, whilst lay people had the advantage, for their devout reading and meditation of the Psalms, of being able to use translations in their native language. "From these," says Pius XII, "it becomes every day more evident what great clearness of expression, beauty of poetry, depth of doctrine these poems display in their native language."62 It is not surprising, therefore, that precisely in these last decades the voices calling for a new Latin translation of the Psalms became ever more numerous and more insistent.63 60 Cf. S. Hieron. Praefatio in I. Psalmorum iuxta hebraicam veritatem, PML 28, 1124 ff. An accurate comparison between the two versions has been made by J. Ecker, Psalterium iuxta Hebraeos Hieronymi in seinem Verhältniss su M as ora, Septuaginta, Vulgata (Trier: 1906), pp. 446-490. 61 Cf. H. Herkenne, Bonner Zeitschrift f. Theol. u.

Furthermore, the undertaking of translating the Psalms from the original Hebrew was a step of exceptional signifi- cance. It was an innovation such as no one in the Church had ventured to put his hands to since the time of St. Jerome and to which many objections could be raised, as actually did happen. It is intelligible, therefore, that, as always is the case in important undertakings, the Church did not move until after prolonged and mature deliberation. The Supreme Pontiff himself refers to the "difficulty of the matter" and to the objection "that the Vulgate is most intimately bound up with the writings of the Holy Fathers and with the comments of the Doctors, as well as that, because of its prolonged use in the Church, it is possessed of the highest authority." "Still," the Motu Proprio continues, "we have, nonetheless, decided to satisfy these pious desires" of those who had expressed the "wish to have for the daily recitation of the Psalms a Latin translation in which the meaning intended by the Holy Spirit would be more clearly manifest, the sentiments of the Psalmist would be more fully expressed, and the artistic beauty and the force of the words would be brought out more fully."64 The pastoral solicitude of the Vicar of Christ and his fatherly charity towards priests and all persons con- secrated to God decided the question. The Vicar of Christ, in virtue of his supreme authority, has taken the step which had been desired by so many and which, without doubt, will prove to be one of the most mem- orable events connected with the Sacred Scriptures.

May the Lord grant that the hopes of the Vicar of Christ may be fulfilled and that "from now on all may ever draw more abundant light, grace and consolation from the recitation of the Divine Office so that they may infuse into them light and strength for the better imitation ... of the models of holiness which shine forth in the Psalms and that they may feel impelled to nourish and stir up within themselves those emotions of divine love, courageous fortitude, and pious penance which the Holy Spirit enkindles within us during the reading of the Psalms."66 65 Praef. in 4 Evang., ad Dam., PML 29, 526. 66 In cotidianis precibus, /. c., pģ 67.</page></plain_text>
