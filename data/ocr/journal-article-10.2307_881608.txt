<plain_text><page sequence="1">An illustrated 'Apocalypse' manuscript at Longleat House BY MICHAEL A. MICHAEL THE library at Longleat House contains one of the finest and most understudied private collections of illuminated manu- scripts in the British Isles. Two of the most lavishly illumi- nated of the manuscripts at Longleat, a Psalter and a Breviary, both of the fourteenth century, have recently been published and the history of the library itself has also been briefly described.' The catalogue of the library's contents made in the nineteenth century has not, however, been published and many of the library's treasures remain unknown to scholars.2 One such manuscript is the copy of the Apocalypse with com- mentary of Berengaudus, Longleat House MS 2. It has been noticed as a manuscript of the period c. 1100 by Neil Ker,3 but the fact that it contains a unique prefatory illustration by an Anglo-Norman artist has gone unnoticed until very recently (Fig.25).4 The manuscript contains 128 leaves and measures 213 mm by 119 mm with a text area (including top line) of 172 mm by 82..mm; the pricking for forty lines to a page survives on the right hand side of many folios. There is no indication of early ownership, but a thirteenth-century note on fol.127v indicates that it once belonged to the Benedictines of St Benet Holme Norfolk.5 The script is in an Anglo-Norman hand of the later eleventh or early twelfth centuries and is embellished with red and green two- and three-line initials. A distinction is made in the initials between the text of the Apocalypse, which begins on fol. v, and the commentary by Berengaudus, which begins on fol.3 and is thereafter placed at the end of each of the seven 'Visions' of St John. This is done by the marking of a new book of Revelation with a two- or three-line red or green initial and by marking the beginning of a new sentence in the commentary with red: something which is not done in the Apocalypse text itself. In addition to these initials the opening of the Apocalypse is marked by a large anthropomorphic initial 'A' of a man wrestling with a dragon against a purple background (Fig.26). The opening miniature (Fig.25) precedes the beginning of the Apocalypse text, which starts on its verso, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was ever part of a larger cycle of images. The miniature is divided into an upper and lower compartment. The upper part depicts Christ enthroned, bles- sing, surrounded by the evangelist symbols, and with the lamb and the dove placed before him on a blank scroll. The lower part serves the dual function of author portrait and illustration to the text of the Apocalypse. The representation of St John on I should like to thank Dr. J. J. G. Alexander for his help in the writing of this note 1 Ms. 11, a Psalter, has been published by B.

Several features of the style of the illumination point to the manuscript having been executed in England; the use of green wash which fades to show the parchment below as a highlight is a characteristically Anglo-Saxon method of painting, and the drapery style displays agitated ruffles of cloth which have their antecedents in pre-conquest illumination. The use of a purple wash as a background colour and the construction of the anthropomorphic initial 'A' which opens the text can be compared with books illuminated at Canterbury in the first quarter of the twelfth century (e.g. a copy of St Anselm's works at Oxford, Bodleian Library MD Bodley 271).6 The type of Christ in the Longleat Apocalypse, with large head and small eyes, can be compared with the work of the Norman illuminator Robert Benjamin, who signed a volume of St Augustine on the Psalms (Durham, Cathedral Library Ms. B II 4), made for Bishop William of St Carilef probably while he was in exile (1088-91), but the monumentality of the figures and the sureness of the drawing found in the Longleat Apocalypse is unlike Benjamin's work and makes any attribu- tion questionable.' The iconography of the Christ in Majesty supports the stylistic comparisons with Anglo-Saxon work; firstly, in the representation of the dove, which is characteristi- cally large and nimbed and, secondly, in its connection with Anglo-Saxon representations of the divine and human nature of Christ (e.g. The Arenberg Gospels, New York, Pierpont Morgan Library Ms. M869 and London, B. L. Harley Ms. 603).8 The fact that this Apocalypse was written as a text separate from the Bible, with the commentary of Berengaudus planned as part of the book from the outset, is of particular interest, since the emergence of illustrated Apocalypse manuscripts, often containing this commentary, has been much discussed as a thirteenth-century development in England.9 Moreover, the use of a two-tier format similar to that used in the Longleat Apocalypse, combined with the use of scrolls within the picture frame is a significant feature of M. R. James's 'First Family' of Anglo-Norman Apocalypses of the thirteenth century.10 Further study of both the iconography and style of the miniature in the Longleat Apocalypse is required, but its survival must indicate that the existence of a native tradition of Anglo-Norman Apocalypse illustration, coming between the surviving ninth- century Carolingian and thirteenth-century English examples, is not impossible." 6 See c.
