<plain_text><page sequence="1">cultural geographies 2009 16: 329-349 Beware the Elephant in the Bush: myths, memory and indigenous traditional knowledge in north- eastern Namibia1 Lorraine Moore Manchester University This article draws on a case study exploring the value of elephant wisdom and myths in managing human-elephant conflict in Caprivi (Namibia). It does so to highlight that Indigenous Traditional Knowledge (ITK) is more flexible than recent concerns suggest. This is because ITK transforms in response to changes in both the biophysical and wider socio-political setting of people's environment. The article demonstrates the transformative nature of ITK by applying the findings of the case study to the literature associated with myths, truth claims and collective memory to argue that ITK has a strong social and cultural element. As such, ITK can be viewed as cultural knowledge which is essential to people's adaptation to their social and biophysical environment. Therefore, ITK will evolve to combine traditional forms of knowledge with new knowledge as the needs of society change, whether this is due to changes in the biophysical, socio-political or both environments. This finding provides valuable insight into the dynamic nature of ITK; it also offers new perspectives on culture and cultural memory in making sense of the world. Keywords: elephants • indigenous traditional knowledge • memory • Namibia • political ecology 6 I Ąach culture has a system by which knowledge is obtained/2 The knowledge which rural I ^African people have obtained of their environment, referred to as Indigenous Traditional Knowledge (ITK) has a complex status. Historically, there has been considerable reluctance to ascribe any value to this knowledge. This is due to Africa's colonial legacy where such knowledge was associated with a primitivist discourse.3 However, the status of both ITK and its holders is just as complex in the post colonial era, despite the fact that the value of ITK is increasingly rec- ognized. Recent concerns associated with ITK include the abuse of trade in intellectual property rights4 and the loss of ITK.5 It is the latter of these themes - concerns associated with the loss of ITK as its custodians either pass away or change lifestyle - that this paper contributes to. Advances in technological knowledge and changes in market preferences have been presented as key causal factors in the loss of ITK; these changes render practices based on such knowledge inefficient. As a result, ITK is marginalized, so that it only exists as 'pockets of memories.,6 Nazarea uses her research investigating the impacts of the green revolution on farmers' knowledge of cultivation in the Philippines to argue that there is an urgent need for people's knowledge of © 2009 SAGE Publications 10.1 177/1474474009105051</page><page sequence="2">cultural geographies 16(3) crops to be recorded. She makes the case that memory-banking should take place alongside gene-banking to ensure that the various uses of different gene varieties remain known. Nazarea' s concern regarding the loss of ITK extends to calls for preventing (or at least modifying) the implementation of development models that have the potential to threaten existing pockets of memories people have of different crops.7 This article will add to the existing concerns associated with the use and loss of ITK in a modernizing world by investigating the impacts of a changing bio-physical and socio-political environment on ITK held by ethnic groups. It will do so by drawing on a case study that investi- gates both the usefulness and transformation of myths and knowledge of elephant behaviour. This knowledge is primarily drawn from interviews undertaken with the Khwe, but also the Mafwe and Subyia, which are three ethnic groups inhabiting the Caprivi strip in Namibia. In particular, the article draws on a range of material including interviews conducted by the author, plus elephant myths and descriptions of elephant behaviour as narrated to the author by interviewees. The article will also make use of pictures drawn by schoöl children which provide a window into the knowledge children have of elephants. This material is used to demonstrate two key findings. The first of these findings is that Khwe myths still have potential in assisting the mitigation of human-elephant conflict in Caprivi, and second that ITK is flexible and transformative as it responds to changes in both the biophysical and wider socio-political setting of rural people's environment. In particular, the pictures drawn by Mafwe and Subyia children demonstrate how the observational skills of children could assist in the revival and reformulation of latent knowledge in response to the changing needs of the social group. Although this paper does not seek to undermine concerns associated with the loss of ITK, it applies the case study findings to the literature associated with myths, truth claims and collective memory to argue that indigenous traditional knowledge is more resistant than recent concerns suggest. This is because ITK has a strong social and cultural element. Indeed, ITK is often viewed as cultural knowledge, or 'repositories of coded information essential to adaptation and survival.'8 Myths and stories form just one part of this repository. However, these repositories are also impacted by social memory, which is dialectic; memories can only be made sense of in the current socio-political and biophysical environment.9 As such, this article views culture as a process rather than a thing that can be possessed.10 ITK can be viewed as fluid and dynamic, responding to changes in both the biophysical and social environments. These conclusions raise interesting questions regarding the vigour of ITK, such as: can lost knowledge be revived if it is needed again? Can we relearn what has once been forgotten? Investigating the prevalence of Khwe myths and knowledge of elephant behaviour allows this paper to illuminate the transformative nature of ITK for two main reasons. First, there are high incidences of human-elephant conflict in the Caprivi, to the extent that the Ministry of Environment and Tourism argues that such conflict can seriously threaten the long-term conservation of the elephant.11 In addition to this, the Khwe and their biophysical and socio- political environment has been impacted by a series of historical events including colonization, but more importantly military conflict during Namibia's War of Independence, decolonization and the current Government of Namibia's policy of nation building. Each of these events has not only created significant opportunities for the creation of new memories and disturbance of older memories; they have also had a significant impact on the biophysical environment, or more specifically, the elephant population in Caprivi. 330</page><page sequence="3">Moore : Beware the Elephant in the Bush Indeed, Caprivi's fluctuating elephant population has impacted the need of knowledge that will assist people living in the area to avoid confrontation with elephants (the need for this knowledge has declined and increased throughout history). Such an approach will produce findings that could be applicable to other forms of research. This is because many authors have highlighted that there is limited research that investigates aural media of memory12 or analyzes children's knowledge of their environment in the natural setting.13 The Caprivi Strip and the Khwe The Caprivi is home to many different ethnic groups, with the Fwe and the Subyia being the most dominant. The Fwe dominate west Caprivi and were originally part of the Lozi Kingdom from Zambia. The Subyia, on the other hand, dominate east Caprivi and originate from Botswana. Interviews with the Subyia were undertaken in Kasika Conservancy, which is located within the Subyia Traditional Authority, whereas interviews with the Fwe were undertaken in Kwando Conservancy, which is located in the Mafwe Traditional Authority. The Khwe, a member of the KhoeSan, are the most marginalized group in Caprivi. As indicated in the introduction, the majority of the material informing this article was gathered from interviews undertaken with and stories narrated by the Khwe. This is because the Khwe, specifically the older generations, held a wealth of knowledge regarding how best to behave around elephants. This was a unique finding compared to other areas of Caprivi where research had also been conducted. For example, interviews conducted with the Subyia in Kasika Conservancy and the Mafwe in Kwando Conservancy did not reveal the same level of knowledge regarding elephant behaviour where NGO organized training courses and environmental awareness meetings appeared to fill this void. Although, the residents of Kasika are reported to have detailed knowledge of the elephant's seasonal movements and of the impact they have had on the vegetation in Kasika Conservancy,14 many interviewees said they did not know any stories associated with elephants. A few interviewees from Kwando could narrate elephant stories, but these were of a very similar nature to those told by the Khwe and could be the result of Kwando's close proximity to West Caprivi Game Park and the Khwe (as demonstrated in the map below). As such, this section of the article will focus more on the socio-political development of the Khwe and West Caprivi.15 The Khwe are the smallest of the San groups in Namibia and are e. . .scattered over 10 villages along the Okavango River on the northern border and in the Angolan enclave of Cabinda'.16 There are three homophonous nouns describing the majority of the San in West Caprivi: Khwe, Khoe and Kxoe.17 This article will retain the form Khwe throughout. Kilian-Hatz argues that the Khwe belong to the KhoeSan family.18 The majority of the Khwe inhabit West Caprivi (approxi- mately 8000 in 1997), although smaller populations can also be found in Angola, Botswana and Smithsdrift in South Africa.19 This article focuses on the Khwe in West Caprivi, particularly the villages of Chetto, Mashambo and Omega III. How the Khwe came to form a permanent settlement in West Caprivi is related to Namibia's War for Independence with South Africa. South Africa had been administering Namibia as South West Africa since 1920 as a League of Nations (and later United Nations) Mandate and had been trying to incorporate South West Africa into the Union of South Africa despite UN calls to withdraw.20 Caprivi became one of South Africa's staging points to maintain its administration 331</page><page sequence="4">cultural geographies 16(3) Map displaying the study sites in the Caprivi Strip, Namibia (created by Steven Pickering, 2008).

This resulted in the Caprivi becoming a heavily militarized and restricted zone.21 Because of this South Africa's actions in the Caprivi strip had a dramatic impact on the conservation in Caprivi as a whole, but this article will focus on the implications for the West Caprivi Game park, the Khwe and the elephant population.22 The West Caprivi Game Park (West Caprivi Nature Park until 1968) was proclaimed in 1963 shortly before Caprivi became a restricted zone and the park itself a military zone, circa 1974-75. These interventions prevented the park from being managed as a protected area until Namibia's independence because personnel from the Directorate of Nature Conservation could not enter the area.23 The militarization of West Caprivi resulted in two significant outcomes for the analysis of this article. First, an environment was created whereby vast amounts of contraband ivory could be smuggled out of the region, which had a dramatic impact on the size of the elephant population. Second, South African military presence resulted in the controlled movement of West Caprivi's occupants, particularly the Khwe.24 The Khwe were recruited by the South African Defense Force (SADF) and became permanently stationed in forts (for example Doppies and Bagani) constructed within the Game Park. Today the Khwe have a complex status in Namibia, which in part is a result of them having fought alongside the SADF.25 However, it is also because the Khwe are in the unique position of residing in a national park, which impacts their access to land and natural resources. 332</page><page sequence="5">Moore : beware the Elephant in the bush Human-elephant conflict in Caprivi: the need for ITK Human-elephant conflict in Caprivi is a concern for the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET). In fact, the MET cite human-elephant conflict and loss of habitat as two of the most significant factors affecting the long-term conservation of elephants in Namibia.26 These are problems because the Caprivi is a very thin strip of land which contains Namibia's highest human- elephant ratio. As such, the movement of both people and elephants is restricted which results in heightened conflict.27 The problems this situatiòn causes for the people who inhabit the Caprivi and the MET are exacerbated by the fact that Caprivi's elephant population has experienced a period of rapid flux. This involved an interval of decline, followed by rapid growth.28 As such, there are many people now residing in Caprivi who are not used to living with this number of elephants and consequendy do not have the skills to avoid conflict with them. Interviewees from the policy and practitioner level explained that Caprivi's fluctuating ele- phant population can in part be attributed to Namibia's Liberation War from South Africa. This is because the military events in Caprivi resulted in a dramatic decrease in the elephant population due to organized poaching activities for ivory.29 However, the end of the liberation war and Namibian independence was followed by a rapid increase in the elephant population.30 This increase was attributed to the cessation of hostilities in Caprivi. An interviewee from Caprivi's MET office explained that elephants would avoid parts of their migration routes if they were going to be threatened. Therefore the end of Namibia's war with South Africa and the stabilization of Caprivi resulted in elephants resuming the use of old migration routes in the area. This resulted in an influx of elephants from Botswana (which has a very large elephant population) and Angola (where it was explained that elephants were escaping hostilities associated with the Civil War).31 The MET is managing the issue of an increasing elephant population and human-elephant conflict through community based natural resource management (CBNRM) models and sustain- able utilisation. Sustainable utilisation, as applied in this context, is informed by the belief that people will have a higher regard for wildlife (or tolerate the problems that high densities of wild- life can bring) if they receive benefits from this wildlife.32 Therefore the rationale of elephant management based on sustainable utilisation is that it will assist the mitigation of human-elephant conflict. This is significant for elephant conservation in Caprivi because human-elephant conflict can have negative implications for people's livelihoods, which in the long-term could result in negative ramifications for the elephant population in Caprivi if acts of revenge shootings are carried out.33 Sustainable utilization in Namibia is applied within national parks, and at the commercial and communal level through conservancies. These conservancies are created through the pooling of natural resources. The members of the conservancy attain conditional use rights over wildlife and other natural resources when government recognition of the conservancy has been achieved. Commercial conservancies date back to 1968, 34 whereas communal conservancies, created on communal land, were permitted to be established in 1996 through the amendment of the Nature Conservation Ordinance (4 of 1975). 35 Because West Caprivi is occupied by people, the gov- ernment has had to create special conditions so that the occupants can partake in sustainable utilisation. The amendment to the Nature Conservation Ordinance allowing the establishment of communal conservancies in Namibia does not account for situations in which people are residing in a national park, which is state land. Therefore the Khwe are not permitted to form 333</page><page sequence="6">cultural geographies 16(3) a conservancy. As such the Khwe formed a trust (the Kyaramacan Trust) which received MET recognition in 2006.36 Consequendy, there is room, if not a need, for ITK that assists rural people living in elephant range to avoid confrontation with elephants. Indeed, such knowledge would enhance the govern- ment's current policy of utilization based approaches to elephant management which assist in mitigating human-elephant conflict where conservancies have been established. Knowledge of elephant behaviour, on the other hand, would assist in avoiding conflict with elephants before mitigation of conflict is required. Such knowledge would also enhance conservationists' understanding of human-elephant conflict, which would further assist in reducing conflict. An entomologist from the National Museum of Namibia (R54) regarded this as essential.37 Methodology: seeking knowledge of elephant behaviour Information regarding the knowledge of elephants held by the Khwe and members of Kasika and Kwando Conservancies was obtained by a variety of methods. These included formal and informal interviews, story telling, life histories and picture drawing, which were all undertaken by the author. The portion of research that this article is informed by draws from a five month period of fieldwork conducted in Namibia, investigating the impacts of CITES38 norms and Appendices on elephant management. This paper specifically draws on 47 (of 110) interviews with Government officials, international and national conservation NGOs in Windhoek and the people who share elephant range in the Captivi region of Namibia (particularly the Khwe). I spent two months in the Caprivi region gathering information from Kasika and Kwando Conservancies, plus the villages of Chetto, Mashambo and Omega III in West Caprivi. Interview length ranged from one to three hours, but repeat interviews were conducted over a number of days. Informal conversations and life histories were also made use of. Interviews and informal conversations were undertaken with both males and females and incorporated people from a diversity of ages including children, young adults, middle aged adults and elders. The research undertaken in Caprivi was complemented by participant observation which involved me partaking in story-telling in West Caprivi. Picture drawing was undertaken in Kasika and Kwando Conservancies where children were asked to draw what they thought elephants did. A total of nine stories were narrated and 30 pictures were drawn and discussed. This research undertaken in the rural areas of the Caprivi made use of a translator who was local to the area. It was preferable to use a locally-based translator as opposed to an outsider due to the sensitive nature of the socio-political environment in Caprivi; an insider reduced the potential for suspicion among interviewees. The information gathered from the rural areas in Caprivi has been supplemented by interviews undertaken with NGO and government officials in Windhoek and Katima Muliło (in Caprivi) to ensure the analysis is placed in the wider historical and socio-political context. This is important because regional government officials have an awareness of policy, land and natural resource use change (particularly changes in the elephant population) across the region. In order to protect people's identities all interviewees have been anonymized. Distinction between interviewees is made through category of employment and a respondent (R) number. 334</page><page sequence="7">Moore : beware the Elephant in the Bush The nature of Khwe myths Khwe myths are notoriously complex.39 Therefore before this paper can analyse the potential conservation value of Khwe stories and elephant wisdom, it is necessary to provide contextual information regarding the nature of these myths. Kilian-Hatz provides the most authoritative and systematically recorded compilation of tales of the Khwe to date in Volktales of the Kxoe in West Coprivi. Within this text, Kilian-Hatz argues that Khwe tales can be divided into two broad categories: stories that are true and stories that are not true. True stories' are described as those which provide guidance through instruction, especially to the young. Stories that are not true, on the other hand, are set in 'mythic time' or how people used to live.40 Both 'true' and 'not true' stories will be referred to in this paper. True stories are the stories I have referred to as elephant wisdom, because they provide guidance and instructions of how to avoid negative encounters with elephants. Folk tales (stories that are not true) were also narrated during my period of fieldwork, usually depicting the origin of the elephant (creation myths) and the elephants relations with other animals (fables). Kilian-Hatz argues that both creation myths and fables not only provide instructions for social behaviour, especially in dangerous situations, but also that these stories ('social creation myths') locate the rise of rules for social behaviour, which did not exist in mythic time.41 Biesele explores similar themes in relation to the stories of the !Kung San, arguing that 'folklore and other oral genres are integral parts of these people's communication systems'.42 Tell me about elephants: Khwe elephant wisdom and myths Farmers in West Caprivi imparted very detailed knowledge of elephant behaviour during general conversations about elephants. For example, a farmer from Mashambo told me how elephants give birth in response to the question: 'can you tell me about elephants?'43 However, the majority of the information imparted by interviewees provided cautionary warnings, which included danger signs, plus how human behaviour should be adapted in order to avoid confrontation (which could possibly end in serious injury or death). For example, when asked the very general question; 'does the elephant have any special meaning?' two farmers from Chetto explained the different sounds that elephants could make and what these sounds meant, so that people could distinguish between an elephant that is grazing, angry, chasing or intending to kill: this was followed by one of the farmers demonstrating some of these sounds for me.44 Another farmer from Chetto narrated a story detailing how tourists were killed by an elephant. He explained that before the elephant charged the tourists, it made a warning sound twice: two white people went hunting and the elephant made this sound, then one white man jumped out of the vehicle to make a picture, then the elephant made the sound again and he killed him . . . When an elephant sees a human he makes a certain sound and then he is busy chasing.45 The Khwe's cautionary knowledge also detailed the ways that elephant behaviour can be observed (if by chance you did not happen to hear their warning sounds). A Community Field Ranger from Chetto (R100) said that 'you have to watch wisely when seeing the big animal... For example, if it is in the bush when you go for hunting and you see an elephant under a 335</page><page sequence="8">cultural geographies 16(3) tree, you pay respect and face the other way: it will see you but not charge because you are respecting it. The elephant is afraid of us too, we give each other problems.'46 Other advice imparted by interviewees included: accompanying a pregnant wife in the bush, avoiding lone female elephants that have gone to the bush to give birth (especially if she is burying her calf), and to avoid resting elephants and elephants that are drinking in a group from the pan. In fact, R100 explained that: 'the elephants will remind you that they are present and do not want to be disturbed when resting. They react to the stink of humans.' The nature and detail of this know- ledge highlights the difference between interviewees from West Caprivi and those of Kasika and Kwando Conservancies. Although interviewees from Kasika and Kwando would say that it would be foolish to approach a feeding herd or an elephant giving birth, they would not provide instructions of what to do in such a situation. For example, a farmer from Kwando conservancy explained the difficulty she faced when she came across an elephant in her field: ťI was trying to find an escape route and then I got to a path where I escaped. I was very frightened, I didn't know what to do!'47 These stories fall into Kilian-Hatz's category of stories that are true. They also demonstrate Biesele's observation that many of these stories are important forms of communication because they assist group survival through the avoidance of conflict with elephants.48 If people understand the sounds and signs elephants make then they reduce the risk of negative encounters and conflict with them because they have the opportunity to withdraw from the situation (if the elephant has not already done so). As such these stories have conservation value because they seek to inform people how to read elephant behaviour. However, stories that are not ťtrue', particularly creation stories and fables, were also imparted by the interviewees of West Caprivi. These stories assist in further demonstrating the Khwe's knowledge of elephant behaviour, although through mythical accounts. In addition to this, the stories that are not true also provide an insight into the cultural significance of the elephants to the Khwe. Both of these themes of knowledge and culture are important to conservation. This is because knowledge will assist the Khwe in avoiding negative encounters with the elephants, whereas the cultural heritage the Khwe associate with elephant presence will assist in the preservation of the species. To begin with analysing the stories that are clearly untrue but provide useful guidance, a farmer from Chetto narrated a story whereby a crocodile made an elephant angry by pulling at his nose (thereby developing the long trunk). The story goes that since this time the elephant has been very angry, which is 'why elephants now damage everything.'49 Although it is unlikely that the elephant developed a trunk due to the actions of a crocodile (in spite of Rudyard Kipling's concordance with this story), this story does attempt to explain the elephant's destructive capacity. In fact, this story does provide the listener with two cautionary warnings. The first is to beware of crocodiles in watering holes (because they can be very dangerous). The second is that elephants can also be dangerous if aggravated. In terms of cultural value, the elephant was given high status in the stories narrated by the Khwe, being referred to as king of the animals by a farmer from Chetto.50 Indeed, Kilian-Hatz explains that the main role ascribed to the elephant in Khwe stories is that of chief or policemen. This is because the elephant is considered to be the 'strongest animal on earth'. As such, the elephant inspires fear and respect.51 The stories narrated to me by the Khwe also drew on the elephant's strength as demonstrated within the hare, hippo and elephant tale narrated by one of the headmen of Omega III: 336</page><page sequence="9">Moore : Beware the Elephant in the bush There was a hare, a hippo and an elephant. There was a competition between the hare and the hippo - they were pulling a rope. Hippo says he will win but hare does not accept. The clever hare made an appointment with elephant by saying there is a competition between hippo and elephant. Elephant is the biggest and strongest and pulls hippo out of the river.52 The importance of the elephant in Khwe culture is also demonstrated through the fact that the Khwe have a story detailing the origin of elephants. This story is highly anthropomorphic, which is a key theme that Kilian-Hatz ascribes to Khwe folk tales. A farmer's tale of how the elephant came into being begins with the sentence: 'first time in the past elephant was a human being.'53 In this and three similar tales narrated to me, the human became an elephant by assuming everyday objects that the Khwe and other ethnic groups used. For example, baskets came to symbolize the elephant's feet, floor mats their ears and a pestle their trunk. Although the same depth of 'knowledge' or 'tradition' appeared to be absent from the other areas of Caprivi studied, two interviewees (R110 and R112) from Kwando Conservancy did narrate a very similar story describing the origin of elephants. This, in part, I attribute to the proximity of Kwando to West Caprivi Game Park. Mythed? The conservation value of myths and ITK Whether they are considered to be true or not, the exploration of these myths, narratives and cautionary tales is important as they demonstrate the awareness people have of their environ- ment. There is much debate within the wider literature regarding the role of myths and truth in conservation. If we were to trace the history and development of conservation policy as imple- mented by colonial powers in Africa, one would think that myths and narratives play a very negative role. This is due to the power of the primitivist discourse implemented by the colonial administration.54 Many academics argue that conservation policy in Africa today is informed by received wisdoms from the colonial era. This is problematic because the majority of these policies sought to exclude rural African people from their environment.55 The prevalence of colonial- informed approaches to conservation in Africa can be summed up in Adams' observation that in many instances colonial thought has 'been built into the structure of established institutions, from national parks to soil conservation programmes.'56 This is further developed by Leach and Mearns who argue that colonial science has become received wisdom.57 Under this scenario, myths and narratives have become accepted and uncontested truth claims; we see them as the truth. However, the important noun within this analysis is 'science.' To extend the quotation from Sutton and Andersen that this article opened with, 'each culture has a system by which knowledge is obtained, that is, a science.'58 Most of us are more familiar with western notions of science, or empirical science, that produce knowledge that is testable and verifiable. However, Sutton and Anderson also highlight that many cultures also draw on non-empirical science which is not objective, verifiable or can be experimented on. ITK or non- empirical science, on the other hand, is expressed and encoded in other forms which include religious rituals, myths, songs, art and dances, which traditionally would not be considered to be science. 337</page><page sequence="10">cultural geographies 16(3) Through exploring Khwe 'elephant myths,' this article has thus far demonstrated that myths do have 'truth' value, in that their central message can assist in governing social interactions with the environment. In order to demonstrate how myths can come to be seen as useful, or even the truth, it is necessary to explore the derivation of the word ťmyth' Myth is derived from the Greek mythos , which the Oxford dictionary of clasńcal myth and religion highlights as originally meaning: 'word, speech, message,' which evolved in the 5th century BC to mean an 'entertaining, if not necessarily trustworthy, tale.'59 Therefore, it appears that our understanding of the word myth not only developed very early on, but that its current meaning is a clear departure from the original. At face value a myth is now usually taken to be something that is false, although occasionally acknowledged to contain a grain of truth. There is a very fine line between what is considered to be a myth and what is considered the truth. The relationship between myth and truth is a theme that both Forsyth and Chapman and Driver have explored closely.60 In order to illuminate the truth telling power of myths, Forsyth draws on Cyrano de Bergerac: 'call it a lie, if you like, but a lie is a sort of myth and a myth is a sort of truth' as a 'myth need not only refer to information that is "false," but also to systems of knowledge and belief that are seen essentially as true.'61 Chapman and Driver, on the other hand, draw on stories of creation, which they argue are the most ancient of these myths. For example, they claim that '[m]ost of these stories are in a modern scientific sense objectively wrong - though nearly all contain some surprising aspects "of the truth", which hint at a deeper understanding of the world than is apparent at first sight'.62 These stories and 'wrong truths' become so deeply entrenched within the social-cultural systems they originate in that Chapman and Driver argue they form the unacknowledged basis for social values and attitudes as opposed to a scientific (verifiable) 'new truth'. These truths are, of course, social constructions. The extent to which they reflect reality cannot be known. Despite this, Chapman and Driver further argue that these narratives have a significant role to play in the way we construct our environment. This is because much of our (human) understanding of the environment, and indeed the world, is communicated through stories; people do not have the ability to comprehend the 'intellectually long time perspective' required to understand the vast timescales of the earth's history. As such, the argument made by Chapman and Driver demonstrates the human need of myths to make sense of our surroundings, in which collective memory and culture play an important role. It is because we can only know the environment through cultural constructions and collective memory that different societies develop different systems of knowledge. As a result, different societies also develop different ideas of the environment, how it should be managed and how it should look. There may not be as much difference between these environmental constructions as there once would have been, for example during the colonial era, because of time-space com- pression and increasing communication throughout the world. However, as this article has high- lighted, these differences in knowledge still exist in some areas and they still have value because they have adapted to serve needs in a specific area. On the other hand, it is important to bear in mind that there are dangers in over-romanticizing what 'communities' (or groups of rural people) can themselves achieve. While Khwe elephant myths do clearly have conservation value, it is very unlikely that these myths, or the Khwe themselves, could manage human-elephant conflict in Caprivi alone. This is due to two main factors. First, the elephant is considered to be an inter- nationally endangered species and as such the government of Namibia has a responsibility to ensure their conservation for wider society. In addition to this, both the Khwe's socio-political 338</page><page sequence="11">Moore : Beware the 'Elephant in the Bush and biophysical environments have gone through many transformations since the Khwe relied on ITK to manage human-elephant conflict. Changing environments: transformation and new memories The majority of elephant wisdom was passed on to me through the older generations of the Khwe. This itself is not unusual because it is usually the elders of any ethnic group who are referred to as being the carriers and custodians of traditional knowledge.63 However, I was actively told by many of the interviewees in West Caprivi that if I wanted to know of elephants and elephant related stories, I had to speak to the old men. When I asked why this was the case, I was told that only the old men knew of such stories. For example, R30 said 'it is only the old people that are knowing, even me myself I do not know.'64 The potential reasons for this are complex. It is possible that there is a cultural tradition for the ťold men' to narrate such stories; however, I argue that there is an apparent loss of knowledge among the younger generations. I have arrived at this conclusion because when discussing the material use of elephants (such as hunting and the use of ivory) I found that although the interviewees did know that hunting took place in West Caprivi (by their forefathers) they no longer had the skill to carry the hunt out themselves. For example, a farmer from Omega III said 'I have never hunted elephants, I do not know how. I have heard a story from the forefathers - if you ever want to hunt elephants you dig a hole and put sharp objects in it, whenever the elephant comes in that hole he will be killed.65 This is a theme I found that applied to all study areas in the Caprivi. The apparent loss of knowledge is related to the events leading up to and directly proceeding Namibia's War of Inde- pendence with South Africa outlined on p.331. Indeed, interviews undertaken in both Caprivi and Windhoek revealed that the Khwe's knowledge of elephant behaviour has been affected by Caprivi's complex socio-political history, which impacted on the movement of people (particularly the Khwe) and the numbers of elephants inhabiting the Caprivi Strip. This is significant because restricting and enforcing the movement of people would have affected the passage of Khwe myths and knowledge of elephants to the next generation, while a fluctuating elephant population (particularly an elephant population in decline) would affect the need of this knowledge. The combination of these two factors has impacted Khwe knowledge of the elephants because the majority of the Khwe today have grown up in an environment where elephant densities were low (the elephants had either been poached for ivory or they moved out to safer areas). Therefore, the Khwe do not have the experience of living with the elephant densities that they are experiencing today. In addition to this, a significant portion of the Khwe population (particularly young-mature males who were recruited by the SADF) were moved; as such they were not present to either acquire or pass on ITK associated with elephants. Both of these reasons could account for the reason why I had to speak to the older generations in order to access knowledge of elephants. An interview conducted with an employee of a humanitarian organization in Windhoek (R22) revealed that the events that had taken place in Caprivi over the past 20 years has resulted in the spatial displacement and geographic dispersal of many of the San. R22 also said that the Khwe community has been torn apart in every way because of events that had taken place in Caprivi over the last 20 years, which must have had a significant impact on their traditional knowledge.66 339</page><page sequence="12">cultural geographies 16(3) This is because not only were the Khwe moved during the Liberation War, but all those who fought for the SADF were given the option of migrating to Kimberley (South Africa) as refugees when Namibia achieved independence. R22 was of the opinion that this alone must have resulted in the removal of a significant proportion of the population as it may have been perceived to be the safer option amongst the Khwe. Independence certainly has brought challenges for the Khwe. For example, the Khwe's marginalized status has prevented them from attaining secure access and use rights to the land they occupy, until the recent formation of the Kyaramacan Trust. This is due to the length of time (16 years) it has taken for the government to formally recognize the Kyaramacan Trust and grant 'use rights' to the Khwe. This delay of 16 years had a dramatic impact on people's access to their environment: in effect, they were excluded from such access.67 This again would have had implications for the Khwe's knowledge of elephants and their environment in general because they were excluded from taking part in environmental management. In fact, an interviewee from a conservation organization argued that the San, except for in the conservancies such as Nyae Nyae (in former Bushmanland, Otjozondjupa Region) have very little access to the environment.68 This was reiterated by R22 who said 'that Nyae Nyae is the only place in Namibia where the San have genuine control over wildlife.' Interviewees also highlighted other changes which occurred with independence that would have impacted the passage of wisdom associated with elephant behaviour. These changes include the use of the English language and imposing western forms of education. For example, R54 explained that 'when you start teaching people with a Western-style education they start to forget their own culture and lores. This may result in people undertaking certain forms of land use without knowing the underlying reason for them because this knowledge has been forgotten over time.' R54 also explained that this is exacerbated in situations where the children are fortunate enough to receive schooling, but do so far away from their home. As a result, the children are not growing up within a traditional setting and they are not present for lore and stories to be passed on until they return for the holidays. Therefore, interviewees attributed the combined effects of restricted access to the environ- ment and imposed movement of the people as the main reason why stories and lore associated with elephant behaviour appear to be disappearing in Captivi. However, restricted and regulated access still carries over today through conservation informed by CBNRM and sustainable util- isation principles. This is because people occupying communal and state protected land must attain formal recognition from the government through a conservancy or trust before they can gain use rights to their environment. As has been seen through the case of the Kyaramacan Trust, this can take a long time. In addition to this, elephants are a Specially Protected Species in Namibia. As such they are state owned and use of them is regulated through quotas awarded by the MET. This has acted to perpetuate a situation whereby people either genuinely do not know the traditional ways of engaging with and managing elephants incidences, or still do carry out such practices without knowing why. As people are not permitted to undertake traditional hunting practices, it is to be expected that they will not remember these techniques. R54 explained that this itself had acted to cause conflicts within San communities. This is because 'it is the hunters are the experts in animal behaviour, but they have been excluded because hunting contravenes conservancy conservation regulations [as imposed by the government]'.69 As such, there is the possibility that the Khwe's knowledge (and the knowledge of other ethnic groups in Namibia) 340</page><page sequence="13">Moore: Beware the Elephant in the Bush has not been forgotten at all, but that people are just reluctant to talk about it because it is seen as undesirable or wrong. The uncertainty regarding the status of Khwe elephant stories in relation to whether people will remember them when their current custodians pass away logically leads to questioning the conservation value of these stories. Furthermore, answering this question leads to a more im- portant question regarding the nature of ITK. Certainly there is evidence to suggest that these stories have and are being changed by socio-political and biophysical factors. But should this be surprising? This paper has already established that we can only know the environment through cultural constructions and that collective memory plays an important role in this. As such, it is to be expected that collective memory will change in response to evolving socio-political and biophysical surroundings. Sutton and Anderson highlight that it is through transformations in culture and cultural systems (political, economic and technological) that people respond to an adapting environment. This is because change in cultural practices is far more malleable to us than biological processes.70 However, it also needs to be considered that people will also respond to changes in the wider socio-political setting, whether as individuals or part of wider collectivities. Therefore cultural practices such as story telling will change to reflect changing needs. For example, Biesele argues that stories are dialectical and as such their meaning can only be interpreted in the current social situation.71 If a situation arose in which elephant numbers had declined and people no longer need to be guided to avoid dangerous elephant incidents, it may be reasonable to assume that the lores associated with elephant behaviour will be interpreted in different ways or even forgotten. As such, it is also reasonable to conclude that such lores have been forgotten if the carriers and custodians of the knowledge have been moved. However, this is to assume that knowledge is lost. In order to consider what happens to culture and collective memory when wider circumstances change, we need to consider what memory is and the potential impacts of new memories; while it is possible to forget things when they are no longer needed or challenged, these challenges can also result in people striving to keep hold of memories. Johnson defines memory as 'neither something pre-existent and dormant in the past nor a projection from the present, but a potential for collaboration between present consciousness and the experience and expression of the past.'72 In this sense, memory can be seen as an interchange between past and present experiences. However, Johnson also highlights the power of new memories (particularly those associated with nation building) to initiate a collective amnesia.73 As this article has demonstrated, the Khwe have been exposed to both occupier and independent state attempts to create new memories of the kind Johnson highlights. In these new memories the Khwe have been cast as both executor and villain of the state respectively. Each role has posed challenges to the prevalence of the Khwe's collective memory associated with elephants and their behaviour. It would therefore appear that these new memories of occupier and state have resulted in collective amnesia setting in (which are exacerbated by changing rules governing access to the environment and educational systems). However, this does assume that there is no potential for remembering or relearning knowledge. Towards the end of Johnson's discussion of public memory, she makes the case that memories are recollections that are anchored in 'places, past and visualized in masonry and bronze, as well as in song and sound.74 It is this recording of collective memories which means that there must be scope for recall. The Khwe's knowledge of elephant behaviour is anchored in their myths. 341</page><page sequence="14">cultural geographies 16(3) A picture says a thousand words: recalling or re-learning knowledge? Fieldwork conducted with children in Kasika and Kwando Conservancies demonstrated that there is potential for knowledge to be remembered or re-learned as a result of changes in the bio- physical environment. This was demonstrated through the act of asking children to draw pictures of what they think elephants do (the results of which are shown below). Unfortunately this was an activity that was difficult to carry out in West Caprivi due to the children's shyness. However, parents of Khwe children believed that their children were more observant of elephant presence then they themselves were. This was indicated during a group interview where two farmers confirmed that their children had alerted them to elephant presence before they themselves detected them. For example R30 said 'I was walking with my boy and he said to me, 'look, there is an elephant', it was really close but I had not seen it.'75 This, I argue, is due to the fact that these children are growing up in an environment in which elephant density is higher than that of their parents' youth, due to the poaching activities that took place during the War for Independence. These pictures demonstrate that children too are very observant of elephants. They largely depict the undesirable activities that elephants engage in or are imagined to engage in, such as chasing people, biting people, plus eating crops and vegetation. To a certain extent, focusing on (and even dramatizing) these negative aspects is to be expected with children: elephants are very large and frightening in comparison, and they can interfere with their daily activities and livelihoods. High densities of elephants in any one area may result in children not being able to go to school and the elephants can cause a lot of damage by eating the crops in their parents' fields. However, discussions undertaken with children regarding how they felt about elephants FIGURE 1 The elephant is chasing a person.

Picture drawn by school child from Kwando Conservancy. revealed that they have conflicting emotions. While they are frightened of them and do not like it when they hear stories that the elephants had damaged their parents' crops, they like to see the elephants running and making a noise; this is exciting to the children. A child from Kwando said that 'the elephant is destroying my mother's field. But I like them when I see them walking around, but my most biggest problem is my mother's maize meal has been eaten and destroyed - even the young ones.'76 The fear the children have of elephants can be demonstrated through the following quotation: T am scared of elephants because they can kill. I was chased by an elephant, I thought that day was going to be my last day, that is why I am so scared.'77 These discussions also reflect the conflicting emotions that the children's parents have of elephants. Panelli and Robertson have also found that ťyoung people are competent knowledge pro- ducers with varying experiences and understandings'78 through analysing pictures children have drawn of the Taieri River. In particular, they argue that the pictures the children have produced demonstrate that they are 'active observers in their environment.' They further explain how the pictures form a window into 'young people's constructed knowledge of their environment. They represent both directly experienced physical knowledge and the socio-cultural understandings young people are building about the river in their lives and in the lives of their families, friends or wider society.'79 Therefore, pictures children produce of their environment contain important information regarding the drawer's socio-cultural and biophysical knowledge of their environment. It is because of this acute awareness children have in both developing and developed countries that Panelli and Robertson argue there is a growing call for 'young people's inclusion in all forms of planning and environmental management.'80 Indeed, the awareness children have of elephants as indicated by their parents and the pictures they have drawn suggests that knowledge of elephant behaviour can be remembered or re-learnt. 344</page><page sequence="17">Moore: Beware the Elephant in the Bush Furthermore, I argue that this re-creation of knowledge is taking place due to the fact that these children are growing up in an environment where elephant presence is more prevalent. The fact that these pictures were drawn by school children from Kasika and Kwando Conservancies adds weight to this argument because as stated at the outset of this article, their parents could recall very little knowledge of elephants. This knowledge will, however, be hybridized with ťnew memories' associated with the government's policies of sustainable utilization and CBNRM where such models are implemented, plus the knowledge children gain from attending schools outside of West Caprivi. As Katz points out, ťa key practice of social reproduction is the socialization and education of children.'81 Therefore, children's knowledge will be a combination of what they learn from observations at home and at school. The fact that knowledge can be recalled or re-learnt suggest that ITK can make a return from the margins. It is, however, unlikely to return in its original form. If we are to accept that people's knowledge, or the stories they tell about the environment are socially constructed, then both the stories and their meaning cannot stay the same; societies and the environment change. If these stories are to remain useful then they will also have to change. This does not mean that the Khwe's knowledge will be remembered forever; nor does it mean that it will all be lost. This group of people have certainly been and continue to be presented with challenges which have had a dramatic impact on their knowledge of elephants and probably the rest of their environment. However, this article has demonstrated that it is not as fragile as first thought. The future of the Khwe's knowledge of elephants will very much depend on how their current relations with the government of Namibia develop (especially in regard to access to their environment) and the choices available to their children. Conclusion Through analysing Khwe elephant wisdom and myths, this paper has demonstrated two main findings. The first of these findings is that despite its complex status, ITK has a lot to offer con- servation in the modern world. Second, frameworks that seek to measure the presence or loss of ITK are unhelpful because of the transformative nature of ITK. People's knowledge of their environment is based on their individual perceptions and social- ized cultural constructions. As such, in order for knowledge to remain useful to us it will need to change in response to our evolving socio-political and biophysical surroundings. But as this article has highlighted, this does not necessarily mean that old knowledge is lost. For example, data presented in this article argued that the Khwe have useful knowledge of how to avoid conflict with elephants, encoded through 'stories that are true' and mythical tales. Further discussion of who the custodians of this knowledge were revealed that, on the surface, this knowledge may be in danger of being lost, as it is confined to the older generations of the Khwe. This was attributed to key events in the socio-political history of Caprivi that had a direct impact on both the movement of elephants and people in the Caprivi, and therefore on both the need of this knowledge and the opportunity to pass it on. However, the fieldwork undertaken with children and their parents revealed that children are observant of their environment. I argued that this is because they are growing up in an environ- ment where elephants are prevalent which creates a need for people to be aware of elephant 345</page><page sequence="18">cultural geographies 16(3) presence and to avoid potential conflict with them. This does indicate that ITK can indeed be recalled or re-learnt. Whether we can say for sure that knowledge of elephant behaviour has either been recalled or learned is difficult. Johnson's analysis of public memory indicates that memory is an interchange between past and present experiences. In addition to this, Johnson suggests that accessing the past is undertaken through the media in which the past has become anchored, including places, monuments 'as well as in song and sound.'82 The Khwe's knowledge of elephants has been anchored in myths and as R54 postulates, land use patterns. An increasing elephant population spurring a greater need for knowledge of their behaviour to avoid confrontation with them may be all that is needed to assist people's recall of the reasons why they carry out cer- tain land use activities. However, it is also possible that the children's keen observation of their environment, which is a combination of new and socialized knowledge, will assist in preventing the existing and more traditional forms of elephant knowledge being lost. It is likely, however, that the Khwe's knowledge of elephant behaviour will now take on a hybrid form as ťolď traditions and memories merge with the younger generation's observations of their environment and new experiences associated with an independent Namibia. The gov- ernment's policy of sustainable utilization and CBNRM, in addition to the rising international environmental consciousness will be important within this. In particular, trying to revive more traditional forms of elephant knowledge in the current socio-political environment may be of little use to the Khwe. This is because both the Captivi and the Khwe have undergone significant transformation since the time in which the Khwe would have been depending on this knowledge to avoid confrontation with elephants. In particular, the rules and regulations associated with access to the environment have changed too much. This is especially the case with elephant con- servation: because of its endangered species status, Namibia has a responsibility to safeguard the elephant for the international community. As such, this paper has demonstrated that culture is a process that adapts in response to biophysical and socio-political change. This finding has valuable insight into the dynamic nature of culture and cultural memory in making new sense of the world. It reformulates the notion of ťloss of culture', instead presenting a perspective of adaptation and hybridization as people's needs and wider circumstances change.
