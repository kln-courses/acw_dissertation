<plain_text><page sequence="1">DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES A Bibliography of Aesthetics and of the Philosophy of the Fine Arts from 1900 to 1932. Compiled and edited by WILLIAM A. HAMMOND. Published as a supplement to the May, I933, issue of the Philosophical Review. Revised and enlarged edition. New York, Longmans, Green, and Company. 1934. Pp. X, 205. The first edition of this useful volume has already been reviewed in this journal (XLIII, 78). The new edition adds one hundred and eighty-eight titles "mainly in the literature of experimental psychology and in the scientific interpretation and history of art". These include "a few titles printed since the first edition was issued . . . but no complete survey of the literature of I933 has been attempted". In a field as wide-ranging as aesthetics it is virtually impossible to in- clude every book and article which the aesthetician might find significant, and the compiler has quite properly disclaimed any intention to prepare an exhaustive index. If, however, the second edition had been delayed until interested readers of the first had been given an opportunity to submit ad- ditional titles for the editor's consideration, the list could, no doubt, have been longer. As it stands, the book will certainly be of great service to all scholars working in the field of general aesthetics. R. M. OGDEN CORNELL UNIVERSITY The Elder Henry James. By AUSTIN WARREN. New York, The Macmillan Company, I934. Pp. XViii, 270. The portrait that emerges from this book is that of a prophet rather than a philosopher. Although there are many passages in it that will be of interest to philosophers and men of letters, it is essentially, or ought to be, a clergyman's book. James had firm hold of the truth, strangely fallen into neglect in these days which need it, that economic regeneration, if it is to be successful, must rest upon spiritual regeneration. If, as Whitehead has recently asserted, the new reformation lies largely with the leaders of the Protestant clergy, the future would be a little brighter than it is if those leaders would betake themselves to the vision of Christian brother- hood (arrived at via Swedenberg and Fourier) so vigorously and, despite certain aberrations, I think soundly, promulgated by the elder James. M. 0. PERCIVAL THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY Max Schelers phdnomenologische Systematik. VON GERHARD KRAENZLIN. Leipzig, S. Hirzel, I934. PP. xiv, I04. This study of the development of Scheler's system as a phenomenological metaphysics very ably meets the need for a clear delineation of his major contributions to contemporary metaphysics. Like the entire contemporary phenomenological movement, Scheler begins with the assertion of an in- herent interrelation of the essence of the object with the essence of inten- tional experience. His unique contribution' is his interpretation of being as value and of emotional experience, especially love, as the basic law of being. 403</page><page sequence="2">404 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIV. Kraenzlin's study is finally critical, accusing Scheler, together with the other phenomenologists, of "dogmatic historicism". The appended com- plete bibliography of Scheler's writings, as well as of the Scheler litera- ture up to I932, will be invaluable to all students of the subject. PAUL ARTHUR SCHILPP Los ANGELES, CALIFORNIA Phdnomenologie und Metaphysik. Das Problem des Relativismus und seiner Uberwindung. Von ARNOLD METZGER. Halle (Saale), Max Niemeyer, I933. PP. xvi, 270. The author stands upon the position of Neo-Idealism. Metaphysics, for him, "is the doctrine concerning reality. Its subjective element is the 'eternal' Truth. Its object is infinite Being. . . . Its foundation is the historic hap- pening" (232). To doubt the certainty contained in the cogito of the transcendent subject marks, for Metzger, the beginning of the breakdown not only of metaphysics but of philosophy itself; it is the road to relativism. No relativistic position can afford any answer to ontological questions. Phe- nomenology is used to show the "horrible" (?) ends to which all rela- tivistic philosophies inevitably lead. The study is acutely analytical and critical and certainly worthy of attention, even though non-idealistic phi- losophers, unable to share the writer's idealistic preconceptions, are bound to find it unconvincing. PAUL ARTHUR SCHILPP Los ANGELES, CALIFORNIA Carlyle and German Thought, i8i9-i834. By CHARLES FREDERICK HARROLD. New Haven, Yale University Press, I934. PP. xii, 346. Professor Harrold surveys the German origin of Carlyle's thought, which, he insists, draws sustenance from many other sources. "The quiet, vigilant, clear-sighted" Kant frees Carlyle from the unwelcome domination of the English and Scottish thinkers. Thereupon Carlyle's positive development is enriched by contact with such writers as Schiller, Goethe, Fichte, and Jean Paul. Carlyle reads an almost Berkeleyan idealism into Kant and Fichte and into Goethe's Der Gottheit lebendiges Kleid. But his Puritan rigor finds happy expression in the moral doctrines of the Kantians; and his individualism, in the German theories of heroic genius. Perhaps the author oversteps himself in seeking German sources for Carlyle's doctrine of silence (230 ff.). This doctrine, expressed in one form or another, is a permanent possession of most people of mystical inclination. NEWTON P. STALLKNECHT BOWDOI N COLLEGE Mind and Nature. By HERMANN WEYL. Philadelphia, University of Penn- sylvania Press, 1934. PP. IOO. This book treats especially of relativity-theory and quantum-mechanics and uses these and other scientific theories to illustrate and support certain philosophical theories concerning sense-perception, consciousness, and the constructive character of scientific concepts. The great merit of the book is that it ties up important philosophical issues with technical and verifiable scientific theories and exhibits the metaphysical insight necessary to pre-</page><page sequence="3">No. 4.] DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 405 pare the contemporary philosophical mind for the new standpoint which positive knowledge necessitates. F. S. C. NORTHROP YALE UNIVERSITY Einleitung in die Philosophie. Von THEODOR Lirr. Leipzig und Berlin, B. G. Teubner, I933. PP. Viii, 338. Professor Litt believes that an introduction to philosophy should not be a vehicle for introducing the reader to the author's own philosophy, nor should it be a mere review of various philosophic systems. He feels that an introduction should initiate the reader into the thought-process itself. In his Einleitung, therefore, he makes much of gegenstiindliches and re- flektierendes thinking and their objects. Although such is his purpose the discussion assumes a systematic aspect and presents, so the author be- lieves, something of a system. The book contains four parts: Selbstbesin- nung des Denkens; Erkennen und sein Gegenstand; Erleben und seine Welt; Philosophie und Weltanschauung. The book deserves careful reading. ADAM ALLES ST. JOHN'S COLLEGE, ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND A Philosophic Approach to Communism. By THEODORE B. H. BRAMELD. Chicago, The University of Chicago Press, I933. PP. xiv, 242. Dr. Brameld raises again in this analysis of communism the much-de- bated question whether Marx as a theorist of social evolution is com- patible with Marx as the leader of an effort to change the course of events by political action. More generally he distinguishes two moral attitudes, called respectively acquiescence and activity; the one is marked by sub- missiveness and a belief in the realization of values by inevitable cosmic processes, the other by analysis, criticism, and the effort to control. Dr. Brameld divides his exposition of communism into two main parts, ac- cording as it exemplifies the one attitude or the other. In each part he examines carefully the statements of Marx, Engels, and Lenin about the in- dividual and the order of nature and society. His conclusion is not only that communists have stressed both attitudes, which is obvious, but that communism is notable for preserving an accurate balance between the two. Psychologically and ethically Dr. Brameld finds no incompatibility be- tween the two attitudes; at the very least the myth that nature is a fit subject for acquiescence has to be kept up for the sake of activity itself. Whether philosophical systems congenial to both can be made logically compatible he does not decide. GEORGE H. SABINE CORNELL UNIVERSITY A Bibliography of George Berkeley. With an inventory of Berkeley's Manuscript remains by A. A. LucE. By T. E. JESSOP. New York, Oxford University Press, I934. PP. xvi, I00. No philosopher in the English tradition, not even Locke, has called forth a more widespread and continuous stream of criticism and comment than George Berkeley. Professor Jessop threads his way through this complex</page><page sequence="4">406 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIV. and polylingual maze with a sure and skillful hand. His work definitely supersedes H. R. Mead's Bibliography, and is now indispensable to anyone engaged in a serious study of Berkeley. Canon Luce's authoritative in- ventory of the autograph letters and manuscript remains is especially valuable. The book as a whole is admirably organized, and a comprehensive index is provided. Professor Jessop has succeeded in compressing a truly vast amount of information into an articulate and convenient handbook. JOHN WILD HARVARD UNIVERSITY Zweierlei Wissen. Zur Lebenskrise durch die Entfesselung des Verstandes. Von Orro BRVIHLMANN. Mfinchen, Ernst Reinhardt, I933. PP. 52. Fortified by his studies in physics, conscious of social and political tur- moil, Briihlmann seeks to undermine the modern tyranny of intellect and to open the way for faith and passion. Head and heart, thought and feeling, share in judgment-making and in the examination of truth-"whatever brightens life and causes us to go forward courageously". As understanding is the conscience (Gewissen) of feeling, so is the heart or the disposition the conscience of thought. Briihlmann is a modern mystic, disciplined by facts, affirming that clear, deep, ordered knowledge leads to faith, and faith becomes knowledge; seeking to destroy the delusion that faith and insight, religion and world-view, need not coincide; anticipating a new philosopher-at once artist, saint, and thinker. NORBORNE H. CROWELL POTSDAM, NEW YORK Die Seele des Menschen. Versuch einer verstehenden Psiychologie. Von ALEXANDER PFXNDER. Halle, Max Niemeyer, I933. PP. viii, 4i6. The mind finds its own body and the outer world as the means of its unfolding development. The essence of the mind resides in an impulse (Urtrieb) towards enrichment and fulfillment. This essential impulse ex- presses itself in five special impulses which may be classified as transitive and reflexive. The first are the five ways of understanding the outer world, and the second are the five ways of understanding the mind itself. The first transitive impulse is to have and refuse, the second to achieve, the third to act and effect, the fourth to control, and the fifth to engage in the outer world. Similarly, the same impulses are reflectively employed to cul- tivate subjective values, achievements, activities, powers, and enrichments. These pursuits of the mind are not directed upon atoms, electrons, or sen- sations, but upon an endless domain of objects of quite different character, namely, objects of such kind and character as will satisfy the exploratory Urtriel and its specialized demands as above listed. The essay has no in- dex nor any references to other writers. R. M. OGDEN CORNELL UNIVERSITY Spinoza and Buddha. Visions of a Dead God. By S. M. MELAMED. Chicago, The University of Chicago Press. I933..Pp. xii, 392. The author's thesis is that the philosophy of Spinoza is usually pre- sented in a paradoxical manner. His thinking is traced to that of Descartes,</page><page sequence="5">No. 4.3 DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 407 Bruno, Maimonides, etc., yet he is regarded as a unique and isolated figure. Rather, we should think of him as a typical expression of certain motives which are universal in the attitudes of the human race as it faces the interpretation of life: universalism, asceticism, pessimism, salvationism, and serenity of mind. Many expressions of these are cited from the lit- erature and philosophy of Europe after Spinoza. And the same motives are discovered in India in general and in Buddhism in particular. No clear distinction is made between an argument from similarity and the tracing of historical, causal connections. ALBERT E. AvEY THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam. By MOHAMMED IQBAL. New York, Oxford University Press, I934. Pp. viii, 192. Islam is a doctrine of deeds rather than of thought. Even in its most mystical schools it has not developed an interpretation of religious experi- ence readily accommodated to modern scientific theories. The writer under- takes in this series of lectures, at the request of the Madras Muslim As- sociation, to reconstruct Muslim religious philosophy with due regard to the traditions of Islam and the more recent developments in various domains of human knowledge. Beginning with the problem of knowledge and of religious experience, which lies at the heart of Islam because the founder himself sought an understanding of man's relation to God, he works through the consideration of revelation, prayer, immortality, and the spirit of Is- lam, to a better sense of the inevitable demand of religious experience for a feeling of the quality of the Real. ALBERT E. AvEY THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY Self, Thought, and Reality. By A. C. MUKERJI. Allahabad, The Juvenile Press, 1933. PP. xiv, 4IO. This book is a study in the ultimate principles of knowledge and exist- ence, predominantly epistemological in character. It aims to evolve a new standpoint which will reconcile idealism and realism, the coherence and correspondence theories, being and becoming. It strives to remove some of the obstacles which stand in the way of recognizing the ultimate prin- ciples of knowledge that must be the common platform for competing theories. An attempt is made to see the problems from the standpoints of both East and West, India and Greece. Starting from the self as the supreme problem in both philosophies, it passes to a critical estimate of the realism of Hume, the conflict of idealism with realism, then the positions of Green and other- nineteenth-century idealists. After a criticism of Brad- ley and Bosanquet and of the correspondence theory, the author proceeds to his own theory of the real as knowable though not known. Kant's ap- proach to the problem is regarded as essentially correct. His doctrine of the categories aimed to establish the correlativity of thought and thing. Categories are not psychological habits nor anthropomorphic tendencies; they are modes of thought seeking to satisfy its nisus to systematic unity, expressing themselves in both science and philosophy. But, as is shown in</page><page sequence="6">408 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIV. the Vedanta Philosophy of Shankara, the object of consciousness must be different from consciousness itself; consciousness cannot create its own objects any more than fire can burn itself. While approaching objec- tive idealism from the standpoint of the Vedantism of Shankara, the author finds it necessary to avoid certain paradoxes involved in his presentation. ALBERT E. AVEY THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY Religion and Ethics. An Essay in English Philosophy. Thesis presented to the University of Pennsylvania by WILBUR SPENCER SHERIFF. Phila- delphia, 1933. Pp. 76. Ethics may need religion as its rational basis; religion may be the cope- stone of an ethical system, or more practically it may fortify ethics with a rationale of reward and punishment. This essay sketches roughly these relationships as they appear in the philosophies of such Englishmen as Hobbes, Culverwell, Martineau, and Green; Cudworth and Clarke; Henry More, Law, and others. The critical summary leaves these and other related problems open. The relationships are not clarified by permitting the term 'religion' to be used to designate almost anything from the recognition of a metaphysical First Cause to the consciousness of Eternal moral values. PHILIP STANLEY UNION COLLEGE The Pursuit of Death. A study of Shelley's Poetry. By BENJAMIN P. KuRTZ. New York, Oxford University Press, I933. PP. xx, 340. Taking as central Shelley's ideas about death, and relating thereto his ethical and social views, Kurtz traces a history of the poet's mind. A sense of "invisibles" was native to Shelley; but under the guidance of Godwin or Lucretius, he rejected the belief in a personal immortality. In his Pla- tonic period, however, death is said to lift the veil of appearances, and, presumably, to disclose man's true relation to the absolute. Finally, in Adonais, by a mystical synthesis, the result of reading Spinoza, Shelley regards life and death as phases of one "substance". Kurtz excels in a sympathetic interpretation of the successive poems and in exhibiting Shel- ley's peculiarly passionate apprehension of his ideas. A simpler style would have made this study more readable. JAMES HUTTON CORNELL UNIVERSITY Dante: De la monarchie. Introduction et traduction par B. LANDRY. Paris, F. Alcan, I933. PP. viii, I96. This volume belongs to the "Textes et traductions pour servir a l'histoire de la pensee moderne", edited by Professor Abel Rey. It includes a trans- lation of Wittes' text of Dante's De monarchia and a rather lengthy intro- duction by the translator. The introduction is written from a Roman Catho- lic point of view and perhaps stresses unduly the importance of the Aris- totelian form in which Dante cast his argument. GEORGE H. SABINE CORNELL UNIVERSITY</page><page sequence="7">No. 4.] DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 409 Orthodoxy in Massachusetts, i630-i650. A Genetic Study. By PERRY MiuLX,. Cambridge, Harvard University Press, I933. PP. xiv, 354. This book is a lucid and lively account of the founding of the Massa- chusetts theocracy. Its specific contribution lies in tracing the peculiar po- litical theories of the early Massachusetts leaders to the school of "Non- Separatist Congregationalism" represented by William Ames. The author thereby succeeds in vindicating the Puritan Fathers from the charge of hypocrisy in their professions of allegiance to the Church of England and in rendering them consistent in their persecuting activities. The sec- tions dealing with the first twenty years of the history of Massachusetts Congregationalism bring into clear relief the problems which beset the the- ocratic government throughout its existence and finally effected its over- throw: in general terms, the problem of adapting Congregationalism with its Independent and democratic views to its function as a state-church, and the need to preserve a practical freedom from English interference. BERTRAND M. WAINGER UNION COLLEGE The Nature of Religion. By GEORG WOBBERMIN. New York, Thomas Y. Crowell Company, I933. PP. xvi, 380. Students of the psychology and philosophy of religion will be glad to find this standard treatise on the subject available in an English translation. Professor Wobbermin's motto in the quest for an understanding of re- ligion is "Back to Schleiermacher and forward from Schleiermacher", and his interpretation of Schleiermacher's theory of religion will be found illuminating and suggestive. To the latter's famous portrayal of the essen- tial root of religion as the feeling of absolute dependence he wishes to add the feeling of security in that dependence and a feeling of eager yearning for the object on which one is dependent. Thus "for us the nature of re- ligion is the relationship of man to an over-world in which he believes and of which he has intimations in his faith, on which he feels himself to be dependent, in whose shelter he knows himself to be secure, and which is the goal of his heart's most ardent yearning" (i8i). The tone of the discussion is somewhat apologetic throughout, and this circumstance unfortunately is reflected even in the author's conception of sound methodology in the psychology of religion. After a fine discussion of the methodological difficulties in this field (28 ff.), he chooses a method which inevitably lifts to a determining position his own subjec- tive prejudices arising from personal religious experience, with all the nar- rowness and distortion which such a procedure naturally involves. One familiar with the history of religions, as the subject presents itself to an anthropologist, finds this methodology rather astonishing. Surely no one would adopt it in dealing with any other subject than religion. E. A. BURTr CORNELL UNIVERSITY</page><page sequence="8">410 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIV. Die Aristoteleskommentare des Simon von Faversham (3o6). By MARTIN GRABMANN. (Sitzungsberichte der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissen- schaften, Phil.-Hist. Abt., I933, Heft. 3.) Mfinchen, I933. PP. 40. The published reports of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences frequently contain short studies of particular interest to those engaged in research in mediaeval philosophy. Dr. Martin Grabmann reports to the Academy from time to time occasional minor discoveries which he makes in his regular studies of manuscripts of philosophical and theological works of the Middle Ages. The present little work is a contribution to the establish- ment of a catalogue of the writings of Simon of Faversham, Chancellor of the University of Oxford in the early fourteenth century. Fabricius, Powicke, Ottaviano, and Pelster have each made valuable discoveries in this special field. Grabmann adds further information to that already possessed, by a study of a number of manuscript copies of Simon of Faversham's commentaries on Aristotle, which were either quite unknown or insufficiently studied by previous writers on the problem. The author also throws fresh light upon Simon's interpretation of Aristotle's thought by a close study of some of the hitherto unpublished portions of Faversham's works. The report of this piece of work is made with the thoroughness for which Dr. Martin Grabmann is justly noted. GERALD B. PHELAN THE INSTITUTE OF MEDIAEVAL STUDIES, ST.. MICHAEL'S COLLEGE, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO Scripps College Papers. Lectures on The Meaning of God in Modern Life. Number Five. Delivered in Janet Jacks Balch Hall, March, I933. Clare- mont, Scripps College, I933. PP. 72. This little volume contains four lectures dealing with different aspects of the "God-concept" and the "God-experience". The first of the four, by Professor J. W. Darr, which is entitled "The Meaning of God For An Average Man", begins by sketching current attitudes towards the belief in God, and ends up with a plea for the belief in a Creative Power, re- vealed in man no less than in the physical universe, which is determined to achieve some noble, altruistic goal. The tone of the second lecture, entitled "The Idea of God in Modern Politics", is very different. Here Professor Story, of Pomona College, cleverly but cynically points out the expediency of religious verbiage when one desires to achieve political success or when one is anxious to divert public attention from one's own nefarious ends. The cleverness of the paper is unquestionable, but so is also, alas, its superficiality. Professor Story does, indeed, understand his politicians, too well for their good, but his understanding of religion seems to be virtually nil. Professor Soares, in the third lecture, "The Ethical Significance of the God-Experience", finds this experience to be one of a morally significant world, holding within itself the possibility of purifica- tion, expansion of valuational apprehension, and a sense of cosmic com- panionship. The last of the papers, Professor H. B. Alexander's lecture on "God and Philosophical Thinking", is a defence of the validity of the religious experience against criticisms based on the seeming inconsequence of man, the apparent superfluousness of God in a scientifically conceived universe, or the apparent victories of evil both in human life and in nature</page><page sequence="9">No. 4.1 DESCRIPTIVE NOTICES 411 at large.

SVEN NILSON MINNEAPOLIS La nature de la connaissance et l'erreur initiate des theories. Par HENRY LEENHARDr. Paris, Felix Alcan, I934. PP. 352. This is a genetic account of knowledge, passing from noetic reactions of primitive organisms to conceptual knowledge. Noetic reactions involving an animal-spontaneity irreducible to inorganic causation occur even in the lowest animals. All concepts and categories arise empirically during the development of the organism interacting with its environment. Non-genetic epistemologies err by over-emphasizing one or other of the terms of the knowing relation: empiricism omits the conscious self; idealism, stressing the "I" and calling its content "idea", destroys the independence of the not-self. Such one-sidedness and the error that knowing involves con- sciousness result from studying adult human knowing, and can be avoided only by a genetic approach. The treatment of mathematics and logic sug- gests little acquaintance with modern logistic, and is not as strong as the up-to-date, positivistic discussion of scientific knowledge; though the latter is somewhat marred by the introduction of "animal-spontaneity", which no, tion, unless carefully explicated and empirically established, not only has no explanatory value but tends to conceal an hiatus in our knowledge. EVERETr J. NELSON UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON Essais d'esthetique, de philosoplhie et de litte'rature. Par VICTOR BASCH. Paris, Felix Alcan, I934. PP. viii, 4I4. To honor Professor Basch upon retirement from the Sorbonne his stu- dents and colleagues have collected from various reviews these essays of his. In those on aesthetics and philosophy he shows his grateful indebtedness to Kant and Hegel. In elegant essays on Renan, Kierkegaard, Brunetiere, and one on Ibsen and George Sand, Professor Basch sympathizes with the aristocratic aloofness of individualism, but hopes that civilization will some day make true aristocrats of all men (267). He values feeling, and ap- preciates the aesthetic results of its most irrational excesses, but prefers to trust reason and science in dealing with social questions (377). VAN METER AMES UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI An Introduction to Logic and Scientific Method. By MORRIS R. COHEN and ERNEST NAGEL. New York, Harcourt, Brace and Company, I934. PP. xii, 468. This volume includes the customary content of logic-books-terms, propositions, syllogisms, and allied forms of inference, scientific method, probability, fallacies. The treatment of these topics, however, exhibits some- what more penetration and mathematical rigor than is usual in elementary texts. Thus the authors give a careful analysis of the existential import of categorical propositions; a very satisfactory brief account of the "truth-</page><page sequence="10">412 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL.

There would seem, indeed, to be some danger lest the discussion become a little too intricate in places to be followed readily by some of the readers for whom the book appears to be intended. RAY H.
