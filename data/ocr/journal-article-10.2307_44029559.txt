<plain_text><page sequence="1">Green Cultural Studies: An Introductory Critique of an Emerging Discipline JHAN HOCHMAN A trial in satellite the Revolution Romantic topography might climes, of show the as English nature a religious literary as a spiritual-imaginative or tradition scientific since object the Indus- object in the trial Revolution might show nature as a spiritual-imaginative object in the Romantic climes, as a religious or scientific object in the Victorian domain, and as a symbolic/formal object in the Modern realm. In the territory of Postmodernity, nature, probably due to its rapid decimation, emerges as a politico-cultural object, one which is no longer restricted to literature, "fine" art, and formalist cinema and video, but also has starring roles in commercials, photos, and movies, and is at the center of heated public debates about "ecocide," "ecoterrorism," "ecopornography," "greenwash- ing" and "animal rights." Responding to these concerns, academia has itself developed a variety of subdisciplines - "ecopsychology," "ecological econom- ics," "ecofeminism," "ecosophy" - as well as the many orientations named by adding the adjective environmental : science, law, ethics, history. In the humanities, the academic response has primarily taken the form of "eco- criticism," a literature-based approach within a still loosely federated but emerging field generally designated as "green cultural studies." As the term suggests, green cultural studies has major affinities with cultural studies, whose prevalent concern has been the impact that texts and social practices have upon ethnicity/color, gender, sexuality, economic class, and age (particularly youth subcultures). The origins of green cultural stud- ies could in this sense be located in the admission of a newcomer into this nexus of concerns: namely, nature (plants, animals, elements, or what I have frequently called "worldnature" or the "fifth world"). In our time, probably the first to link nature with issues of race, class, and gender was Donna Haraway with her 1984 essay entitled "Teddy Bear Patriarchy," a critique of Carl Akeley's hunting expeditions carried out for the collection of animal corpses to be used in the dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History. More recently, in his 1991 Introduction to Strange Weather , Andrew Mosaic 30/1 0027-1 276-96/08 1 0 1 6$0 1 ,50Â©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">82 Mosaic 30/1 (March 1997) Ross called for a "green cultural criticism" (6), or what has increasingly become identified as "green cultural studies," a title that more effectively ties green concerns to the politico-ethical core of cultural studies. Within this context, therefore, the project of green cultural studies is the examina- tion of nature through words, image, and model for the purpose of foregrounding potential effects representation might have on cultural attitudes and social practices which, in turn, affect nature itself. What this also means, however, is that green cultural studies must be equally cautious of the impact that it - like other forms of representation - can have on nature. What is needed at this time, therefore, is a much more precise mapping of the emergence of this new discipline than the "satellite topography" with which I began. In my following survey of green cultural studies, accord- ingly, I first trace the long green line running through the history of a Marxist-based cultural studies; second, I pinpoint criticisms which cultural studies levels at the lexical derivatives of the word, nature , likely deriving from the Naturalist traditions of Zola, Norris, and Steinbeck; third, I raise objections to several configurations of nature advanced by critics like Haraway and Ross; and finally, I sketch some alternative mappings which green cultural studies might take in the future. Cultural cording rary Cultural studies, to Stuart Studies while Hall, rooted in former Birmingham, in Director Marxism, of the the also works Centre began of for the in Contempo- green. Frankfurt Ac- cording to Stuart Hall, former Director of the Centre for Contempo- rary Cultural Studies in Birmingham, the works of the Frankfurt School must be regarded among the movement's Ur-texts. The chief spokes- men here were Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, who as early as 1944 theorized that alienation from, and Baconian "blind domination" of nature were central failings of the Enlightenment (42). They thought that if the Enlightenment could be turned against itself, or if culture's grounding in nature could be recalled, the "truth" of culture might emerge: "By virtue of this remembrance of nature in the subject, in whose fulfillment the unac- knowledged truth of all culture lies hidden, enlightenment is universally opposed to domination" (40). Hyperbole notwithstanding, Horkheimer's and Adorno's assertion is crucial for cultural studies in three ways: first, because culture can be inferred to grow out of, without being determined by, nature. Culture is neither self-generating nor wholly self-perpetuating but is embed- ded in and dependent upon nature. Second (following from the first), "re- membrance" of nature propels one toward grounding and critiquing culture and - especially pertinent for cultural studies - toward theorizing ways out of avoidable dominations. Third and most important, in Horkheimer and Adorno the seeds of a poststructuralist blurring of nature and culture are</page><page sequence="3">Jhan Hochman 83 sown. The two men notice and critique the condition of "reification" or "naturalization," wherein culture has replaced Nature as the realm of the Given and Determining. Horkheimer and Adorno find fault with the way that nature has become alienated from human experience, become unusual, a realm unnatural to humans. The important thing to notice here is that Horkheimer and Adorno reveal how culture gets confused with nature and make this problem central to their cultural critique. Consistent with the Frankfurt School's critique, Jennifer Daryl Slack and Laurie Anne Whitt have recently argued that cultural studies has a two- pronged front: "The project of cultural studies is grounded on a moral and political critique of late capitalism, and more generally of oppressive cul- tural and social formations" (572). Following Slack and Whitt, I would argue first, that there is nothing so routinely subjugated and destroyed by late capitalism (but also by the Marxist/communist campaigns to industrial- ize as a necessary step for proletarian liberation) as the multiplicity of corpora and phenomena grouped together by the term nature (again, plants, animals, and elements or that complex that constitutes "worldnature" or the "fifth world"). Second - and herein lies the crucial rationale for green cul- tural studies - I would argue that the capitalist/communist flattening of worldnature informs and has been informed by artifactual depictions of nature, which flatten it into a two-dimensional backdrop for the human drama. Material and representational domination is thus reciprocal and double. Each stands to aggravate, or potentiate, the other, reifying nature as a realm fit primarily for multiple manipulations and annihilations. Three more recent patriarchs of cultural studies proper, Raymond Will- iams, Richard Hoggart, and E. R Thompson, make the case for a genuine working-class culture and history against royal or bourgeois histories. In general terms, they conceive of workers as the locus of instrumentalism and deculturation, not only by Althusserian Repressive (e.g., police) and Ideo- logical (e.g., schools) State Apparatuses, but additionally by the spread of popular or mass culture (127-86). If the study of workers and working-class culture became the first sprouts of nascent cultural study, its roots go back to Marx. Despite Marx's blinkered view of nature as matter, raw material, and a "tool house" (283-85), nature was for him the foundation of culture, of labor - a necessary factor for cultural theorization. Despite the deadness of Marxian nature, it remains, even if backgrounded and underfoot, the foundation of cultural work and study. The notion of an oppressed working class became a basis by which other objects came within the cultural studies' compass, an understandable inclu- sion in that youth, peoples of color, and women were and are subjugated in the workplace. Race, gender, and age thus became wedded to class, and</page><page sequence="4">84 Mosaic 30/1 (March 1997) domination became multi-pronged: a relatively small group making wage slaves of, commodifying, and manipulating a much larger "group" by justi- fications based on race, gender, age, and class. These larger groups were burdened with adjectives of "brute-ishness," "brute-ality," "coarseness," "wildness," "innocence," "ignorance," or verbs of "massing," "spreading," and "swarming," words indicating a need for surveillance, control, and checking (in the double sense of both inspection and preventative measures). Putting aside cultural studies disagreements about the degree to which individuals are entirely and inescapably dominated from above (interpellation), or accept, consent to, or struggle within a dominating framework (generally speaking, hegemony), cultural studies posits, at bottom, political and social power aimed at a vast group of raced, classed, gendered, sexualized and aged people(s) by a small, traditionally unmarked group, increasingly recognized as wealthy, Western, white, heterosexual, adult males. Yet what cultural studies seems not to recognize is the overclass's characterization of subal- terns in terms also used to anathematize nature. It could even be argued that designations like poverty, femaleness, youth, or rich melanin content be- come problems primarily through traditional linkage with reified negative nature: living "close to nature" as abject poverty; nature as punishing mother goddess or innocent child; youth as wild or nature as the past or immaturity of culture. In her study of imperialism, Hannah Arendt spoke of such nega- tive uses of nature in the context of early white racist psychology: What made them [Africans] different from other human beings was not at all the color of their skin but the fact that they behaved like a part of nature, that they treated nature as their undisputed master, that they had not created a human world, a human reality, and that therefore nature had remained, in all its majesty, the only overwhelming reality - compared to which they appeared to be phantoms, unreal and ghostlike. They were, as it were, "natural" human beings who lacked the specifically human character, the specifically human reality, so that when European men massacred them they somehow were not aware that they had committed murder. (72) Because nature is routinely and reductively construed as unconscious, as raw material, any entity associated with nature stands to lose rights to ethical culture. People of color, women, the lower classes and youth, all reduced to labor power, gain admittance into culture predominately as means to another's profit or leisure, or as suffering objects that must be saved for culture's redemption, a ritual compensation (salvation) for lifeways and professions daily degrading indirectly those we want to save directly. (I have left sexu- ality out of the race-class-gender-age "string" because gays, lesbians, bi- sexuals, etc., are often castigated as "wnnatural" even as they are reduced to</page><page sequence="5">Jhan Hochman 85 objects in similar ways as the "naturally" raced, classed, and gendered. Some have responded with the claim that a homosexual is born, not bred). These connections make nature's inclusion in cultural studies - in the form of green cultural studies - reciprocally important: since people and nature are made abject in similar terms and by similar practices, attention to the way nature is treated (actually and in terms of its representations) provides insights into overarching theories and strategies of power which impact on persons; conversely, green cultural studies has the potential to rediscover a nature that is still essentialized as mere matter - a continuum from dead to not fully "present" - and reconfigure it as essential, a fifth world that matters. In this way, nature gains potential for increased theoreti- cal and geographical space in, and despite, cultural practice. Nature, however, is up against fierce antagonism, not just from the Right, but from the Left's suspicion of environmentalism's whiteness (in the U.S., at least) and alleged callousness toward people. Another problem pertains to the very word nature , which Williams calls "perhaps the most complex word in the language" (Keywords 219). Fredric Jameson, however, is unsqueamish about using the "n"-word: "Postmodernism is what you have when the modernization process is complete and nature is gone for good" (ix). In- ferred here is not only late capitalism's/postmodernity's decimation of worldnature, but also the disappearance in some postmodernisms (i.e., cul- tural studies) of nature as conceptual and linguistic referent. Herein is a coincidence: so often when the subaltern becomes a trenchant problem for those on top, the urge to heal real division is attempted by waving away so- called "divisive" categories (race, class, gender, etc.) as mere "construc- tions" having no basis in "reality." African-Americans are asked to repress concerns with race or ethnicity because of "the basic fact that all human beings - though far from being alike - are similar at least insofar as they are human" (Sollors 299). While this is true, indeed, another "basic fact" of the socio-culturescape would appear to be that racism, sexism, etc., are chronic. In the case of nature, now that its advocates have become a problem for culture-in-general, a similar tactic might be seen to operate: the tendency suddenly to conjure up a Utopian oneness or singular nature and culture, a nature subsumable under culture or a culture naturalizing itself as Nature or nature, culture giving itself powers previously attributed to Nature. This "Hey, we are you, you are us" seems a rather facile attempt to expiate cultural guilt by erasing the difference culture has worked so hard to manu- facture and maintain. Perhaps "theorists of erasure" are saying what most of us who feel threatened by environmental critiques want to hear: that it is possible to shunt or repress the culture-nature division and the witting and unwitting</page><page sequence="6">86 Mosaic 30/1 (March 1997) decimation of worldnature perpetrated out of, and for the sake of, difference elevated to superiority. Yet no more should an "enlightened" white hand expect a forgiving clasp by an understandably indignant black hand, than should we expect that minimizing a distance of difference between nature and culture is a solution to the nature-culture problem. Far better for critics to admit and theorize the intensity of culture's manufactured distance from and gridification of worldnature before too easily getting the idea we are nature, know Nature, or that nature is us. Otherwise, it is likely that similar cultural obscenities will be reproduced in subtler, more incorrigible forms. To cast this argument as an aphorism: waving away a conflict is not waving goodbye to it. Within the larger centrist political backlash against "environmentalist extremists" and a Leftist castigation of environmentalism on the basis of its whiteness and its "privileging" of nonhuman victims, nature faces more specific representational/rhetorical hazards when referred to or included in cultural studies. First, in cultural studies the terms "natural," "naturalness," and "naturalized" tend to be synonyms for "reified" and "essentialized," a terminology which, contrary to the marketplace use of nature and natural to confer positive values on products, associates nature with the inescapable cage of "natural determinism": "Cultural studies defines itself in part... through its ability to explode the category of 'the natural' - revealing the history behind those social relations we see as the products of a neutral evolutionary process. It is understandably worried at the prospect of becoming a 'natural' discipline itself' (Turner 6). By reason of cultural studies' disparagement of natural by reason of the way that it replaces nature or natural with the more humanly alterable history or cultural construction , worldnature risks vilifi- cation as an external straitjacket or internal tether; it becomes the kind of nature opposed to a culture over-optimistically referred to as "nurture." The cultural-studies baggage of an outwardly and inwardly determining negative Nature might, in part, issue from Zola's Naturalism, the determin- istic "surroundings" he describes in The Experimental Novel : "it will only be necessary to work upon. ..the surroundings if we wish to find the best social condition. In this way we shall construct a practical sociology and our work will be a help to political and economical sciences" (26). While Zola's surroundings are primarily urban, 20th-century American Naturalists, Steinbeck and Norris, relocate them in nature - for example, the Oklahoma dustbowl at the opening of The Grapes of Wrath and Norris's Death Valley at the closing of McTeague. Reading nature as determining enemy in these two novels becomes rather easy, despite Steinbeck's depiction of the dustbowl as prima- rily a culturally-caused calamity, and Norris's depiction of McTeague's and Marcus's aridity of values as being more a product of culture than of nature.</page><page sequence="7">Jhan Hochman 87 In addition to the role that Zola assigns to "surroundings," in his "Pref- ace" to ThÃ©rÃ¨se Raquin , he also points to the determining innards of flesh: I chose to portray individuals existing under the sovereign dominion of their nerves and their blood, devoid of free will and drawn into every act of their lives by inescapable promptings of their flesh. ThÃ©rÃ¨se and Laurent are human beasts, nothing more. In these beasts I set out to trace, step by step, the hidden workings of the passions, the urges of instinct, and the derangements of the brain which follow on from a nervous crisis. (2) With Naturalism's outer and inner determinations, the individual is reduced to both laboratory animal and abject beast. Moreover, while culture and nature are both capable of being the disease, only culture is posited as the cure: surroundings must be corrected to mitigate internal nature's constant supply of abjection. Before Zola, nature was Hobbes's "natural state of war," where without a political commonwealth "the life of man [is] solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short" (I: 13). Presently such a view is found in Andrew Ross who feels that environmentalism, like Nature, is a politics of restriction: "Green poli- tics has this unfortunate reputation of being the politics that says 'No,' or at least 'No more'; there's this very strong strain of asceticism that runs through the house style of environmental writing. Culture critics don't find narratives of restraint to be very sexy" ("Interview" 58). Ross could also - but thankfully does not - make similar remarks about an advocacy of iden- tity politics, or multiculturalism: i.e., that such advocacy could also be called an unsexy, ascetic program of restraint, which in saying "No more" to the pleasurable indulgence in manipulation, discrimination, gatekeeping, scapegoating, and generalized self-aggrandizement, thereby breeds frustra- tion on the part of racists, sexists, and homophobes. Ross, instead of "asceti- cism," favors a democratization of cultural affluence, a post-scarcity politics that might seem to square with exclusively human social politics but not, unfortunately, with an ever-exterminated worldnature. Nature also faces a second hazard when it attempts to enter cultural studies: the poststructuralist-deconstructionist blurring of the nature/culture boundary, a blurring having the unfortunate result of impacting not just on conceptions about nature, but on worldnature. In the extremes of poststructuralist thought, worldnature, not just nature as concept or de-referentialized signifier or sign, itself becomes, to some, "culturally constructed." In physics, there is what Timothy Ferris - in his review of Murray Gell-Mann's The Quark and the Jaguar - calls the "Copenhagen interpretation" which he translates as, "no observer means no phenomena," a cousin of the poststructural "no culture means no nature" or "no sign means no referent." As Ferris notes,</page><page sequence="8">88 Mosaic 30/1 (March 1997) Geli-Mann calls the Copenhagen interpretation "stupid" (43), and Gell- Mann's comment could also be applied to the poststructural argument for this reason: a worldnature conceived as culturally constructed is a looking- glass nature, a nature that is sensorially abstract, but cognitively or sign- ificantly concrete. What seems to have been overlooked or ignored is that to assert an ontological worldnature is not necessarily to claim an epistemological Na- ture as the realm of Truth or knowable referent(s) recognized through the heroism of Human Thought. Cannot one aver nature's existence without claiming to know the particular Framework to which that existence must conform? While existence and essence may not be ultimately separate at thought's vanishing point, distinguishing them is hardly avoidable. It is, of course, paramount to cultivate suspicion of claims of "common sense," "common knowledge," and of Truth, but it seems puerile centrism or regres- sive religiosity (ourselves as gods) to render all existence dependent on human senses, language, culture. Even in the Fichtean apogee of German Idealism - denial of the thing-in- itself and affirmation of a pure, transcendental ego which produces the world - there is no consciousness, language, or culture without the pure, transcendental ego planting within human egos (loosely, "culture") the non- ego (nature, reality). In Fichte, culture does not construct (here, a synonym for produce) nature and reality so much as does pure, transcendental ego through the vehicles of human egos (Coppleston 40-46). While still making nature dependent upon the higher and anthropomorphic power of pure, transcendental ego, not even Fichte had the hubris to claim that human consciousness, language, or culture alone produces the world (nature). Perhaps the confusion about the cultural construction of nature is the word, construction : to construct a house, an artifact, means "to cause to exist," as well as "to fashion." The cultural construction of nature, however, must clearly be restricted to the latter sense, if not to sound like nonsense. Conversely, that culture fashions and manipulates worldnature, that it has invented the word nature with its multiple meanings, hardly needs arguing. One could, perhaps, optimistically argue that worldnature has not yet been swallowed up by culture, or that the trend of nature's destruction by intellectual and industrial culture is reversing since nature is now dubbed - supposedly indicating a new awareness of nature - environment. This term, however, runs another risk related to chronic, excessive anthropocentrism. Environment is not inclusive of all plants, animals, and elements, and fur- thermore the term has increasingly come to mean a nature tangibly important only to human health or livelihood. We thereby cease to pay as much atten- tion when nature is destroyed by manipulation, development, consumerism,</page><page sequence="9">Jhan Hochman 89 and dumping as long as our environment stays intact. This merely anthropo- centric brand of environmentalism would be fine if nature were not simul- taneously precluded as important in itself, for itself, outside human considerations. More shrapnel against nature issues from an unrestrained blurring of the nature/culture boundary: the idea that technology is nature, is an aid to "reinventing" nature. Here, I have Donna Haraway in mind, formidable critic of the biological sciences but problematic advocate of nature: In the belly of the local/global monster in which I am gestating, often called the postmodern world, global technology appears to denature everything, to make everything a malleable matter of strategic decisions and mobile production and reproduction processes. Technological decontextualization is ordinary experience for hundreds of millions if not billions of human beings, as well as other organisms. I suggest that this is not a denaturing so much as a particular production of nature. ("Promises" 297) Unlike the previous instance of boundary blurring, where concrete nature was vulnerable to absorption by culture, Haraway's suggestion that technol- ogy is a "particular production of nature" is a sub-set of the argument that everything, including culture and technology, is n/Nature. The contention that everything is nature is surely difficult to dispute. But what might result from such a statement? Haraway's suggestion seems already to have been co-opted by developers, scientists, and technophiles who argue that they and their products are part of nature. Already we have a car commercial in which a slowly panning shot of a dashboard in close-up reveals its gradual metamorphosis into a rocky landscape. Other commer- cials portray cars as revered hunting animals, superior to wolves who admire and envy the particular car's speed and traction. Haraway's assertion that technology is nature also seems to be a veiled attempt to call upon nature to justify technology, to naturalize technology as intrinsic to humanity, as good. As cultural studies has long noted, the naturalization argument is extremely faulty and dangerous: by such reasoning, for example, circumci- sion and clitoridectomy can also be called natural - not a genital mutilation which "denatures" the human body as much as a "particular production" of nature, producing merely "altered" or "fixed" bodies (terms already used to refer to the mutilated bodies of pets). If one employs even some amateur psychology it is not too difficult to see why technoculture gets naturalized, even promoted, by the environmentally-minded: technology's out-of-sight and out-of-mind processes of extraction, production, consumption and dis- posal make damage to nature seem non-existent or minimal. Even dropping</page><page sequence="10">90 Mosaic 30/1 (March 1997) bombs on unseen "targets" better connects cause to effect. Maintaining that technology is a particular production of nature is prob- ably one thing Haraway meant by The Reinvention of Nature, the subtitle of her Simians , Cyborgs , and Women (presumably she means the concept of nature or the cultural construction of nature, not worldnature itself). Yet Haraway should have been more careful with the phrase, "reinvention of nature," and more attentive to the consequences of not putting "nature" within quotation marks. Imagine the indignation if heterosexuals, men, and whites called for the reinvention of gays and lesbians, women, people of color, respectively. Would it not be more accurate to call for the "reinvention of culture," or even the less catchy and dramatic, "reinvention of cultural concepts of nature"? One such possible re-invention is of culture as a technological weapon of mass destruction unleashed on nature. So that nature does not disappear into culture, and culture does not authorize and naturalize itself as nature or Nature, closer scrutiny is called for when mussing up the boundary between nature and culture, of wielding the word, nature , with too broad a stroke. Scrutiny is employed by Alexander Wilson in his far-ranging (Dollywood to outer space) and potentially far- reaching (readable) The Culture of Nature. While Wilson argues against border reification, he does so without sanctioning cultural acts as part of nature, as natural, and without viewing nature as a mere construction or extension of culture. Even when describing Disney's staged nature films, Wilson is - unlike theorists milking the drama of the counterintuitive - careful with casting nature as mere appendage of culture: "Nature is in part a human construction after all" (124; emphasis mine). Moreover, though Wilson is obsessed in seeing the separation of nature and culture as the cause of the degradation of nature and the impoverishment of culture, his plans for a physical breaking down of the radical distance between culture and nature call for an expansion of wilderness and undomesticated nature, and a limit to urban, suburban, or exurban culture. Wilson runs into problems, relative to a larger scheme of things, only with his overly-optimistic notion of "ecological restoration": ...some landscape work is able to galvanize both communities and professions. A promising example is ecological restoration, an emerging discipline - and movement - dedicated to restoring the Earth to health. Restoration is the literal reconstruction of natural and historic landscapes. It can mean fixing degraded river banks, replanting urban forests, creating bogs and marshes or taking streams out of culverts. (113) The problem with Wilson's notion that humans can "restore" nature to "health" lies in the way that it sounds similar to ideologies of ethnic "pu-</page><page sequence="11">Jhan Hochman 91 rity," "health," and "cleanliness" applied to the "improvement" of human populations whose individuals or minorities must be moved or killed for a greater "good." The restoration model thus still entails manipulation and objectification, even if for the presumed good of the subject and object (which is, admittedly, a step above instrumentalism merely for the subject). Nature restoration, furthermore, is based on a presumption that humans know, to an egregious and positivist extent, what restored nature looks and acts like, know what is "healthy" for plants, animals, habitat or, more scientifically, the "bioregion" or "ecosystem." The drive toward restoration can also indicate an impatience with "natural" time, and a failure to consider that on their own, plantlands, grasslands, forests and wetlands might flourish if people radically lessened their impact on them. My point is not that restoration should never be performed, only that the practice is highly problematic. Instead of trying to restore nature, a better strategy might be for the too-scientific and too-instrumental ego to back off in order that plants, animals and land can restore themselves and benefit from more observation and protection than manipulation. Backing off might be reproached as an example of separating ourselves from nature or praised because it allows nature to "take its course," but whatever the case I would argue that fixating on the merging of nature and culture as the solution, and their separation as the problem, is a dedication to overcoming binary ideology that stumbles back into it: namely, privileging unity over difference. A kind of postmodern- ism - notwithstanding Jameson's negative characterization of postmodernity as a state where "nature is gone for good" - might be an antidote: fusing and separating might be seen as alternating strategies, both of which, ethico- political exigencies depending, can be engaged. Finally, I want to address what I hope is not a tired issue when it comes to green concerns - that of who speaks for nature. Leftist cultural theorists seem especially wary of environmentalists and animal-rights advocates who, Andrew Ross says, act as "ventriloquists": As for the question of who speaks for the victims, I think there are already too many ventriloquists around speaking in the name of nature, advocating this or that drastic course of Malthusian action. The debate about overpopulation is a case in point - Murray Bookchin once said that as far as the Nazis were concerned, if one Jew remained in the world it would be overpopulated. ("Interview" 58) While I agree that population is a lesser problem than socio-economic structure and practice, what I wish to address are the implications of the phrase, "speaking in the name of nature" accompanied by the word, "ven- triloquism." First, however, I want to consider Haraway's complaint against</page><page sequence="12">92 Mosaic 30/1 (March 1997) speaking for nature, a complaint that she also voices in terms of the environ- mentalist as "ventriloquist" ("Promises" 313). Haraway is irritated by the question, "Who speaks for the jaguar?" asked by Joe Kane in his review of Susanna HechÅ¥s The Fate of the Forest (26). Why? Because, Haraway says, the question "was precisely like that asked by some pro-life groups in the abortion debates: Who speaks for the fetus?" (311). Both questions irritate Haraway because they complicate her resolute pro-choice position. Though I do not doubt Haraway's "care about the survival of the jaguar," I believe that she tries to disembowel a difficult environmental issue by relying too comfortably on a more easily discredited abortion argument. I believe or at least hope that most environmentalists and animal-rights advocates - and this brings us back to Ross's criticism - do not think of themselves as ventriloquists putting words into the mouths of (dumb) ani- mals. Environmentalists and animal-rights advocates might be better charac- terized as representing jaguars or speaking, as Ross says, in the name of jaguars; for this, as I see it, means speaking for the survival and the contin- ued well-being of the jaguar, which, with or without a jaguar's sanction, is less problematic than not representing them at all. For instance, in June 1994, a U.S. federal appeals court ruled that those who denounce laboratory torture of birds and rodents were not legal plaintiffs (Burd A29). Legal plaintiffs would only be animals who spoke out for themselves! Increas- ingly, however, not even human plaintiffs speak out for themselves. Their lawyers do. Yet what is so interesting about this criticism of "ventriloquism" by those like Haraway and Ross who seek a blurred line between nature and culture is a call for separation of animal and human, nature and culture when it comes to speaking (out) for animals. If, as Haraway mentions, there is no longer any convincing boundary between human and animals, why should animals not be represented by people, just as people are represented by people. It could even be convincingly argued that animals, like people who cannot or do not represent themselves, are the ones most in need of repre- sentation. Yet Haraway, and most assuredly Ross, would still complain about the phrase, "speaking in the name of," since it addresses jaguars as if they were not connected to the larger picture of forests with indigenous peoples, just as speaking for fetuses seems to imply that they are not connected to the larger picture, mothers ("Promises" 312). Though these connections of indi- vidual with environment are different, Haraway's complaint is worth enter- taining. It is part and parcel of that more quotidian argument that demanding the preservation of nature usually involves callousness toward people. This argument resembles one conservative response to identity politics: that</page><page sequence="13">Jhan Hochman 93 marginalized groups "singled out" for what some cultural conservatives call "special treatment" will lead to conservatives, themselves, being marginalized by "reverse discrimination," that attention to the rights of women, people of color, gays and lesbians will turn white heterosexual men into the Other. When it comes to the rights of nature, even a certain Leftist element boards this "special treatment" bandwagon, claiming that focus on nature hurts jobs, ignores third and fourth-world peoples, is anti-human. Within the ranks of environmentalists, some Earth-First members and deep ecologists maintain that animal rights calls for the special treatment of animals. By and large, these are flawed arguments; "special treatment" is much more about getting decent, equal, or appropriate treatment, about avoiding the worse kinds of treatment. The problem, then, is this: how can plants, animals, and elements, even disparaged people, gain decent, equal treatment, within and outside cultural studies? The recourse to the argument that "we're all connected, people to people and people to nature," is of too limited appeal for the following reason: mother and fetus can be disconnected; people's bodies are increas- ingly disconnected from each other; animals (even those with emotions and intelligence) are routinely sacrificed; plants (even those with value when alive) are cut down without a second thought. In cases like these, a plea to "only connect" appears futile. "Connection," regretfully, is ignored or scoffed at by people increasingly cut off from each other and nature. Besides, why should connection be a precondition for care? Can care not be directed at those deemed different or unconnected? Maybe it is time to argue for life and liberty without the tedious rationales of difference or similarity, rationales often rooted in intelligence or consciousness. One could argue that Deleuze and Guattari - though far more concerned with breaking down than reasserting the culture/nature, animal/human bound- ary - offer a more promising scenario than either Haraway or Wilson, one dialectically careful not to abandon the advantages accruing to borders and boundaries, to separations in terms of "molar individuals" and "subjects" on "planes of organization." Their view of "becoming-in-the-world" (in con- trast to a more fixed, being-in-the-world) incorporates structuralism (bound- aries, limits, identities) with post-structuralism (transgressions, joyous confusions, protean fluctuations) into a shape-shifting multiplicitous postmodernism. After pages of lexical spawning, of darting and diving in fluid non-separation - where "molecular multiplicities" are "haeccities" "deterritorializing," "involuting," becoming "bodies without organs" on a "plane of consistency," in short, where the human can, at least, "become- animal" - Deleuze and Guattari slow down to counsel sobriety:</page><page sequence="14">94 Mosaic 30/1 (March 1997) But once again so much caution is needed to prevent the plane of consistency from becoming a pure plane of abolition or death, to prevent the involution from turning into a regression to the undifferentiated. Is it not necessary to retain a minimum of strata, a minimum of forms and functions, a minimal subject from which to extract materials, affects, and assemblages? (278) And when or where are these minimal strata, subjects, etc., to be retained, even if temporarily? Their answer is, in the realm of politics: It is, of course, indispensable for women to conduct a molar politics, with a view to winning back their own organism, their own history, their own subjectivity: "we as women..." makes its appearance as a subject of enunciation. But it is dangerous to confine oneself to such a subject, which does not function without drying up a spring or stopping a flow.. ..It is thus necessary to conceive of a molecular women's politics that slips into molar confrontations, and passes under or through them. (276) Deleuze and Guattari's sense of movement is their strength: first, their advocacy of "becoming-other" along a "plane of consistency" (an improve- ment over "imitation" or "identification"); and second, their move from the plane of consistency - where no impervious boundaries exist between nature and culture, animal and human, that plane of temporary and strategic becomings - to a "plane of organization," that realm of subjects and indi- viduals, of temporary and strategic fixities. If green cultural studies is to be an effective politico-cultural tool in the service of nature and culture, it will need to study not only how to "become" nature, how to attempt a merging with the real or imagined subjectivity of a plant, animal, or mineral, of air, water, earth and fire; it will also need to pull back and grant these beings and entities unromanticized difference, an autonomy apart from humans, a kind of privacy and regard heretofore granted almost exclusively only to those considered human. Nature and culture cannot be willed together by glibly naturalizing culture, by culture simplistically proclaiming itself part of nature, or by stupidly making worldnature into an appendage of culture, worldnature into a culturally constructed product. Any substantial (reciprocal) merging of nature and culture will take generations of internal cultural struggle. Green cultural studies and human culture would do well to ensure that plants and animals are granted separateness, independence, and liberation (an apartness distinct from excusing and advocating separation because of superiority) before mucking about too much with forced fusions and coalescences. Otherwise it is nature who/that will suffer most by this shotgun marriage with culture(s) made monstrous by thousands of years of naturalized atrocities against plants, animals, and elements.</page><page sequence="15">Jhan Hochman 95 WORKS CITED Althusser, Louis.
