<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ADENA ENGRAVED TABLETS: A STUDY OF ART PREHISTORY David W. Penney ABSTRACT Thirteen of the known Adena engraved tablets were recovered during primarily amateur mound excavations in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A provenance is established for each tablet through published accounts of their discoveries. The internal characteristics of the tablets and their designs exhibit strong correspondences. Their size, shape, material, design structure, compositional mode, stylistic attributes, motifs, and subject matter all indicate a comprehensive artistic tradition governing the production of the tablets. The idea that the tablets were used for printing is supported by certain compositional eccentricities, and by the fact that some of the tablets are stained with pigment. A comparative analysis of the tablets suggests a variety of printing techniques and pigments. Grooves on the reverse faces of some of the tablets seem to have been made by the grinding of pigments. There are three geographically localized substyles with uniform iconographie emphases that indicate some sort of social or religious development coalescing the regional manifestations of Adena culture. The appearance of the raptorial bird symbol, and possibly a horned effigy figure, suggest a relationship with the wider sphere of Middle Woodland period iconography. Introduction Artifacts that may be classified as art objects present an unusual opportunity for studying the material remains of extinct cultures. Art may pertain to ritual, symbolize status and role, represent wealth, result from an aesthetic love of decorative form, or serve two or more of these functions simultaneously. The art of the Adena people has always been enigmatic. Since the first engraved tablets were found in nineteenth-century Ohio and were suspected of bearing hieroglyphics, people have speculated about their meaning. Adena art is not represented by many examples. However, several objects of an artistic nature have been found since those first discoveries, and these may reflect various functional categories.

Penney than establishing a general aesthetic appreciation of Adena art (see, for example, Myron 1953), this study will focus upon the engraved tablets alone in order to perceive their nature and purpose, and perhaps to ascertain the social institutions that prompted their creation. One of the first questions which must be dealt with is: Do the tablets make up a functional set? Were all the tablets produced for the same reason and used in the same way? In this analysis it is assumed that the tablets were made under the auspices of a single institution within the Adena tradition. Changes may have occurred in the precise mode of expression through time or geographic distribution, yet remained tied to the original idea. Therefore the variety of design and technological innovations seen in the tablets express different solutions to a single problem. With this assumption, we can see the variations converging on a single hypothetical model of tablet use. History and Archaeological Context The role of the tablets in Adena society is suggested by examining the artifacts in the context of Adena sites. Although the tablet finds were often inadequately reported, it is useful to present excerpts from the original tablet reports in order to indicate where the inadequacies lie and what information on context is available. The Wright Tablet (Fig. 6) is the only Adena engraved tablet found during the course of a professional twentieth-century excavation. It was recovered from Mound 6 of the Wright Group in Montgomery County, Kentucky. The location of all sites that produced engraved tablets discussed in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Wright Mound 6 was an especially productive mound, containing 21 burials and a large collection of artifacts. William S. Webb (Webb and Haag 1940:124) wrote as follows about the discovery of the Wright Tablet in the site report of 1940: This tablet was taken from Mound 6 at a depth of 28 feet. It was not in burial association, but lay in the basal portion of the mound which contained some village midden, and therefore it may be an accidental inclusion in the mound. It was broken, the break being an old one, and the other portion was not found. It would appear, therefore, that this may be but a fragment of a discarded artifact thrown out in the old village, and later incorporated in the mound. The discovery of the Berlin Tablet (Fig. 9), in Jackson County, Ohio, was also reported firsthand by the excavator (Sylvester 1879:73) in 1879. The engraved stone, or Berlin Tablet, as it has been called, was found June 14th, 1876 by Mr. Linzey, Mr. Cremeans and myself. The mound from which it was dug is on the farm of Mr. Ed Poor, on the edge of Lick Township, and about a mile southwest of Berlin. The site of the mound is on the second bottom of a small tributary of Dixon's Run. We opened the mound by carrying</page><page sequence="3">THE ADENA ENGRAVED TABLETS 5 a trench from the eastern side to the center. We encountered first a layer of dark, rich top-soil common to the rest of the meadow. Below, the dirt began to be mottled in appearance, showing a mixture of clay and topsoil. In this we found occasional traces of fire such as bits of charcoal and ashes. At the depth of about five feet lay a level of dark mouldy dirt, showing some traces of fire, but not much. After digging around in this, and unearthing a few pieces of flint and some scales of burnt sandrock, we became discouraged and thought of abandoning the exploration. Sylvester (1879:74) explains how he was sitting on the bank of the trench watching Cremeans work with a mattock when the tablet was struck. It was placed on its edge, the ends pointing east and west, and it was on a level with the original surface. . . . Near this was found an irregular piece of the same material having on each side indentations similar to those on the tablet. Two of them form a cross. ... A piece of graphite and two arrowheads completed the "find." Another firsthand report of the discovery of a tablet in Clinton County, Ohio, comes from Dr. C. B. Welch and J. M. Richardson (Welch and Richardson 1881:40-42). The mound in question is situated upon the road leading from Wilmington to Harveysburg, known as the Wilmington and Waynesville Pike, and about three and a half miles from the former place. In shape the mound is almost round, being forty feet north and south by forty-five east and west, and in height six and a half feet. . . . The opening was made from east to west. After reaching a depth of three feet a layer of charcoal and ashes from four to six inches in depth, and which covered the entire surface of the mound, that is, what was the surface at the time the deposit was made, was struck, amidst which were found skeletons. The bodies had been buried in regular order, each having the head to center and feet turned toward the outer edge of the mound, radiating from the center as the spokes in a wheel radiate from the hub. There reposed side by side in fancy, manhood and old age. . . . After penetrating the layer just described, the same characteristics marked the next three feet as did the first three. . . . When the center of the mound was reached, a truncated cone shaped mass, about two feet high and four feet in diameter, composed of clay that had evidently been burned until it assumed the color of salmon brick, was found. Directly west, and one foot from the base of the cone, was discovered a vault nine feet long and three feet wide, the head and foot were plainly marked by a wall of round, smooth boulders. The vault was filled with charcoal and ashes, which, after being removed to a depth of two feet, disclosed a skeleton of a man who had been buried face down in a horizontal position. The body had been buried two feet below the original surface or the level of the ground. . . . Upon removal of the bones of the skeleton, within those of the left hand was found clasped the tablet. This engraved tablet was first named the Richardson Tablet, after one of the excavators, but today it is generally known as the Wilmington Tablet</page><page sequence="4">6 David W. Penney (Fig. 3). The entire excavation was discredited by the subsequent find of another engraved stone which was obviously a fraud. This stone is described and figured in the same report quoted above. If the particulars of the fraud's discovery can be believed, the authors may be guilty of little more than gullibility. The excavation was shut down for almost a month because of inclement weather. When digging resumed, the second tablet was found within two feet from the spot where the excavation ceased weeks before. It appears likely that pranksters planted the stone, but this does not explain the excavators' willingness to be duped. The inscribed design on the tablet shows a male figure in trousers and shirt sleeves on one side, and on the reverse a female wearing a dress, a striped tiger, and a crocodile. The description in the report (Welch and Richardson 1881:44) reads as follows: "The features [of the male] are bold and massive, and of such character as a student of ethnology would expect to find in a man of the race that constructed such almost imperishable monuments as the Mound Builders have left throughout the Middle and Western States." Many romantic nineteenth-century archaeologists believed that a race superior to the North American Indians were responsible for the mounds. Examples of the fanciful speculations surrounding the construction of the mounds include attributing the works to a colony of Phoenicians or the Lost Tribe of Israel. Silverberg (1968) has pointed out that nineteenth century attitudes were in part due to an ethnocentric bias against the American Indian that served as a rationalization for the virtual genocide that western expansion entailed. The bias of Welch and Richardson is established to the extent that they were willing to abandon discretion in the face of questionable evidence that supported their ideas. Thus the entire report must be viewed with caution. As we shall see, most of the mound features conform to those in other Adena mounds. The finding of the tablet in the skeleton's hand sounds suspect because Adena artifacts have never been found with this relationship to a burial elsewhere. The final firsthand site report of a tablet discovery is provided by Delf Norona (Norona 1950b:4-5), editor of West Virginia Archaeologist, who thoughtfully published a letter written by J. E. Wharton in 1876 about the recovery of the Grave Creek Tablet (Fig. 14) from a mound near Moundsville, West Virginia. I heard of an inscribed stone taken from a mound toward the east of the fort in 1832, and sent to the University of Virginia. I procured a copy . . . [and] found it broken at one end. I procured men and opened the mound, which was about six feet high and eighteen in diameter. We found nothing above the surface level, but below, on the center of a neatly-laid circle of boulders, we found the other piece of the stone . . . ashes, beads, bones and one pipe. Norona also performs a service by offering some criticism of the</page><page sequence="5">THE ADENA ENGRAVED TABLETS 7 generally accepted illustration of the tablet. The location of the stone is at present unknown and its appearance is recorded only through drawings. Henry R. Schoolcraft observed the tablet in the Grave Creek Museum in 1844 (Schoolcraft 1845:405). He made what appears to be a rough sketch that is included in his "Observations Respecting the Grave Creek Mounds" (Schoolcraft 1845:op. p. 400, Fig. 6). Another illustration of the same tablet that appears in Information Respecting the . . . Indian Tribes of the U.S. (Schoolcraft 1851:91, Fig. 3) differs quite markedly from the rough sketch. This latter plate is the standard representation of the tablet and is published in all subsequent discussions (Webb and Haag 1940: Fig. 62; Webb and Baby 1957: Fig. 30). Norona (1950b:6) reported this information about the 1851 drawing: The redrawn illustration of 1851 was prepared by Captain Seth Eastman, a former professor of drawing at West Point, detailed by the Government to assist Schoolcraft in his work. The writer, after some considerable search, has been unable to find any evidence that Seth Eastman went to Moundsville. So his drawing was made, in all probability, from Schoolcraft's earlier sketch. Eastman had a tendency to idealize his drawings of artifacts. Schoolcraft's sketch may be a bit fanciful as well, even though he calls it an "accurate figure" (Schoolcraft 1845:405). Through his description we know that the artifact was "a tabular piece of yellow sandstone" and that "part of the stone had been broken off. In the drawing the whole is restored geometrically" (Schoolcraft 1845:405). Both illustrations show a rectangular tablet with a design consisting of six units, arranged two by three, of concentric circles. Schoolcraft's drawing includes a central bulls-eye in each unit?excluded in the Eastman plate?and generally different proportions of the figures to the field, and of the shape of the tablet when compared to Eastman's rendition. Schoolcraft's drawing was not measured, so no specific data are available. Since both pictures are line drawings, it is implied that the design was linearly incised rather than carved in relief. The features of the Allen Tablet support this and other interpretations of the tablet's general configuration. The rest of the literature on tablet finds is secondhand. Since some writers seem to have had access to the original field notes, the reports are informative in varying degrees. Greenman (Greenman 1932:480-481) has this to say about the discovery of the Kiefer Tablet (Fig. 4) in the Kiefer Mound: The Kiefer Mound in Miami County, Ohio had three features in common with the Wilmington Mound. Twelve skeletons were arranged in a circle, heads to center, one foot and two inches above ground level, around the top of what is described in the blue-print made by the excavator, as a "fire-place" eight feet in diameter, rising from the floor. This fireplace appears to be analogous to the truncated cone mass in the Wilmington Mound. As in the latter, an engraved</page><page sequence="6">8 David W. Penney stone was found. . . . On the floor of the Kiefer Mound, in a two inch layer of ashes were five more skeletons arranged rather irregularly around the central knob. Three of the skeletons . . . had the skulls between the knees. The other artifacts from this mound are as follows: 1 copper celt, 1 unperforated slate gorget, 10 round sandstone disks, one of which has what appears to be red ochre on one side. Webb and Funkhauser's Archeologica! Survey of Kentucky (Webb and Funkhauser 1932:299) describes an artifact collection removed from the Gaitskill Mound in Montgomery County, Kentucky, during the late nineteenth century that includes the Gaitskill Stone Tablet (Fig. 7) and the Gaitskill Clay Tablet (Fig. 8). The authors' own observations of the mound and presumably the excavator's memory result in the following report: The mound is of the sugar loaf type, one hundred feet long, forty feet wide at its broad end; thirty feet wide at the narrow end and thirty feet high. It has been dug into at various times and has yielded some of the finest artifacts ever found in Kentucky. About forty-five years ago Mr. M. A. Tyler, now of Philadelphia, and Mr. J. O. Tyler, now of Winchester, Kentucky, made a partial excavation of the mound and found at the depth of twenty feet below the surface a layer of charcoal arid wood ashes under which were numerous artifacts and many human bones. Some of these artifacts are now in the possession of Mr. J. O. Tyler of Winchester and include a number of remarkable and interesting pieces, among which may be mentioned a tubular pipe of soapstone, copper bracelets, engraved plaques of pottery and large sheets of mica. The first report and description of the Cincinnati Tablet (Fig. 2) appeared in American Pioneer in 1843 (Anonymous 1843:195-196). This periodical was published in Cincinnati and the report is nearly contemporaneous with the excavation of the Cincinnati Mound: A mound which once stood near the junction of Main and Third Streets was necessarily removed to bring the streets to a convenient slope. . . . The mound was about twenty-five feet height. The engraving (Plate 1, p. 195) is an exact representation of the stone . . . taken from the mound in December 1841. . . . With this stone were found parts of a skeleton of a fullgrown human being, also two pointed bone implements about six inches long. There was no appearance of anything like a grave or vault where these relics lay. . . . These, with several Indian flint arrow-stones, two stone axes, a piece of mica and a bead etc., as found in the mound at Grave Creek, were discovered by, and are in the possession of Mr. Gridley of Longworth Street. This account is essentially corroborated in a letter written by a Mr. Eras mus Gest of Cincinnati, published by Squier and Davis (1848:274-275). Mr. Gest, however, proclaims himself discoverer and owner of the tablet: I herewith send you what I deem to be a hieroglyphic stone, which was found with a skeleton in the "old mound," situated in the western part of the city, together with two pointed bones, each about seven inches long, taken from the same spot (see page 220).</page><page sequence="7">THE ADENA ENGRAVED TABLETS 9 In the course of the excavation several skeletons were disinterred, and their generally being in good state of preservation and near the surface, gave rise to the inference that they were deposited there since the mound was erected; but the one with which the sharpened bones and hieroglyphical stone were found, was in a decayed state. Being in the center and rather below the level of the surrounding ground, it was no doubt the object over which the mound was erected. I have a part of the skull, the remainder of the skeleton was destroyed by the diggers. The discovery of the Lakin A (Fig. 12) and Lakin (Fig. 13) tablets came to the attention of Delf Norona (1950a: 1-2) in 1950: In destroying a mound on the home and property recently two incised tablets were found by Mr. Everett W. Swartz of Mason County. In this mound, about eight feet in height (designated MS-1) there was found associated with the tablets eight projectile points, mostly 3-4 inches long, two lumps of "black graphite" and a white cone. The tablets were found about the surface of the ground, and a "black circle of dirt" was noted about the base of the mound. A report of the excavation yielding the Waverly Tablet (Fig. 5), handed down through two consecutive owners, was obtained by J. Ralston Skinner, who was the second vice-president of the Cincinnati Society of Natural History and author of a rather fantastic discussion of the units of measure used by the "Mound Builders," in which the account appears (Skinner 1886:240): The tablet was taken from a mound on the farm of Abraham Cutlip, about one mile south of Waverly and about 3 1/2 miles north of Piketon about March 1872. It was found about 3 feet from the bottom of the mound on the north side by Abraham Cutlip and David Allen who were cutting away at the mound. Dr. Hurst obtained it from them while they were at work. The mound was on the second bottom of the river, had been 15-20 feet high but had from time to time been cut away so that it was only 10 feet high at the time of this excavation. The mound was composed of clay. With the tablet were found "darts, badges and human bones." The remaining two tablets, both found by amateur Marion West, were accompanied with minimal information pertaining to the excavations. The Allen Tablet (Fig. 10) was first described in American Antiquity (Holmes 1944:449) in 1944 as one of the "Two New Specimens from Ohio": "About 1900 a small mound was opened on the Marion West farm near Saxon, Meigs County, Ohio, along the Ohio River. Mr. West found the inscribed tablet in this mound." The Meigs County Tablet (Fig. 11) was first figured and described in Webb and Snow's Adena People (Webb and Snow 1945:91): "The record of this tablet stated only that it was 'found in a mound on Olive Hayman's farm, Saxon, Meigs County, Ohio, by Marion West and William Hague.' It was a matter of regret that we do not know the location more exactly but</page><page sequence="8">10 David W. Penney from the record, the site very probably was not more than fifty miles southeast of Chillicothe." The extinct township of Saxon can be located as a postal district on Post Office maps dating from around the turn of the century. It was located just south of the present town of Portland, Ohio. Variability in the quality of reports allows only certain tablets to be identified as Adena through the usual archaeological method of associating them with a collection of culturally diagnostic remains. The lack of specific stratigraphie data precludes relative dating of the tablets by seriation and rigorous analysis of the context and artifactual collections of the tablets, even if existing collections could be made available for study. The tablets and their associated artifacts are dispersed widely, and many are privately owned or their present locations unknown, making it impractical if not impossible to have access to them. With the literature cited in hand, however, an investigation of Adena tablets can proceed by using an analysis of internal characteristics. The tablets are unusually well described and well-illustrated, perhaps because of their unusual natures. The analysis that follows is based on the synthesis of several descriptions and observations of two or more photographs, line drawings, relief prints, engravings, or lithographs of each tablet, and insight offered by the excavation reports cited above. I also was able to examine the Meigs County Tablet at the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, and experimented with two casts made from the Cincinnati Tablet at the American Museum of Natural History, New York. The results of these examinations will be integrated into the text as pertinent issues are discussed. Design and Composition Although many of the artifacts were collected under somewhat dubious conditions, all of them belong to the same artistic and cultural tradition. To demonstrate this each tablet will be compared to the others in terms of physical characteristics and carved design features. Before dealing with each tablet individually, however, some general observations can be made. The metric attributes of the tablets are offered here in the most expedient manner to facilitate comparison (Table 1). This table shows the material, measurements of length, width, and thickness (when available), and a width/length ratio to illustrate proportion. In general, the tablet faces bearing designs exhibit some uniformity in shape; they are rectangles with rough proportions of the sides exhibiting a ratio of approximately two to three. An exception to this format is the Berlin Tablet, whose design indicates that its shape was altered some time after the design was applied. The specific measurements of the tablets do show some variety. Some</page><page sequence="9">THE ADENA ENGRAVED TABLETS 11 tablets are almost twice as long, or more than twice as wide, as other tablets. The Allen Tablet is nearly five times as thick as the Wright Tablet, although most of the tablets show a more even distribution between these extremes. All of the tablets seem comfortably hand-sized. In nearly all cases, the material used for tablets is soft, sedimentary stone. The only exception is the Gaitskill Clay Tablet, which was carved from unbaked clay. The materials were probably selected because of their ease in carving. Only the Berlin and Grave Creek tablets have full designs on both faces. The Berlin Tablet has nearly identical designs on either face. The main difference between the faces is that one exhibits less control in execution and appears sloppy when compared to the other. The Grave Creek Tablet has designs that are entirely unlike one another on the opposing faces. Because of the questionable accuracy of reproduction, only the design verifiable by comparison with other tablet designs will be discussed. It is sufficient to say at this point that the design on the Grave Creek Tablet neglected here appears alien in character and highly suspicious. The Lakin Tablet has a small amount of alternate side incising in the form of a design element which appears to be very similar to a portion of the design on the Lakin A Tablet (Norona 1950c:20-21). This suggests that both the Lakin A and Lakin tablets were produced by the same artist. The Allen, Grave Creek, Berlin, Lakin A and Lakin tablets have linearly incised designs. Thus the compositions are entirely linear in character. The remaining tablets have been described as carved in bas relief, although all of the designs are made up of both linearly incised and bas-relief elements. The Cincinnati, Waverly, Wilmington, and Meigs County tablets, in that order, show increasingly less bas-relief in their designs, and all have significantly less open relief than linear carving. The Kiefer, Gaitskill Clay, Wright, and Gaitskill Stone tablets, again in sequence, exhibit increasingly more open, carved-away areas, although all have incised linear elements in the designs. The Gaitskill Stone Tablet stands out as being the most open design, with well-defined areas of figure and ground executed in bas-relief, but some details of the face are linear. Generally speaking, the designs fill up the tablet field with complex formal schemes, leaving very little of the design area un worked. The designs on most of the tablets are compartmentalized; they are blocked-out into geometric subareas that are filled in with design units. The Lakin Tablet has eight rectangular subdivisions arranged four by two. The Gaitskill Clay Tablet is divided into four areas, the Wilmington Tablet into six, the Meigs County Tablet suggests eight, and so, on. Several of the tablets are not literally subdivided by means of a drawn, rectangular grid, but the display of design forms suggests compartmentalization. Thus the Waverly and Berlin tablets can be broken down into four design units, each one relegated to a quadrant of the tablet field, and all connected to a</page><page sequence="10">12 David W. Penney median bar. The Cincinnati Tablet offers the most interesting breakdown of components: there are eight motifs in three stacked rows, two on top, three in the middle, and three on the bottom. The Allen and Grave Creek tablets likewise exhibit compartmentalization with regularly spaced, repeated designs. The Gaitskill Stone and Lakin A tablets are exceptions, but for two entirely different reasons: the former because its pronounced monumentality seems conceived as a unified whole; the latter because its nervous sketchiness belies the regimentation induced by the compartmen talization of design units. It should be noted, however, that the Lakin A design can be broken down into design forms comparable to those appearing in a compartmentalized format elsewhere. Regarding the content of the designs, interpretations of art produced by extinct cultures must always retain some element of doubt with respect to meaning and motivation behind the art form. On the other hand, the formal relationships that emerge when one tablet design is compared to another offer a more solid ground for analysis. A discussion of the formal elements in designs must utilize descriptive terms, but these should not be regarded as inconographical identifications, at least at this stage. Credible studies of iconological themes will be possible only when a much broader synthesis of Middle Woodland period artistic imagery is available. Leaving aside, for the moment, questions of stylistic relationships, Adrena tablet designs lend themselves to three levels of formal analysis and comparison. First, small portions of the designs (hereafter termed "elements") can be extracted from the context for comparison. Secondly, the elements are, for the most part, compartmentalized as described above. Each compartment of a tablet design contains a recognizable assemblage of elements that often suggests a zoomorphic or anthropomorphic body part, such as claws, heads, or wings. A design within a compartment will be regarded as a motif, and motifs can also be extracted and compared out of context. Finally, the motifs are arranged on the tablet field in an overall design. These can be compared in terms of motifs employed and the compositional mode of their arrangement. There are four pairs of repeated designs in the Adena tablet repertoire. The Lakin A design is equivalent to the Gaitskill Clay, the Wilmington to the Meigs County, the Wright to the Berlin, and the Allen to the Grave Creek. The matched pairs are not identical, but share equivalent sets of elements and motifs that are arranged in similar compositional schemes. The designs differ only in minute details and the general style of execution (these comparisons were originally pointed out by Webb and Baby 1957:83-92). The overall designs of the Gaitskill Clay and Lakin A tablets suggest frontally-posed, anthropomorphic figures with certain zoomorphic features. Along the lower borders of the designs are thin, horizontal lines edged with rounded scallops that suggest bird tails. Just above these are</page><page sequence="11">THE ADENA ENGRAVED TABLETS 13 stylized leg and claw motifs that extend symmetrically from thin, central, vertical body elements. The Lakin A Tablet design departs from the Gaitskill Clay at this point by the inclusion of two medallion forms on the body, one above the other. The legs are splayed from the hips, flexed at the knees, and terminated with large, clawlike feet. The arms are similarly raised from the bodies and symmetrically situated, arms bent at the elbows, and large hands, with thumbs, presented at shoulder level with the palms out. This kind of arrangement of the arms and legs is commonly referred to as a "displayed" posture, and henceforth this composition will be called the displayed figure. Heads and faces are curiously absent from the designs. Instead, there are two, opposing crescent motifs which arch out to the outer edges of either tablet at the top of the design. The crescents of the Gaitskill Clay Tablet are more angular than rounded, but the position and thrust of the motifs are equivalent on both tablets. Although the stylistic treatment of the tablets differ, the overall compositions, including such details as the curvilinear "streamers" descending from the hands (Webb and Baby 1957:91), the number of linear elements in the claws, and the consistent use of "eye joints" (Webb and Haag 1940:124) match to a surprising degree. A similar displayed figure is found on the Cincinnati Tablet, although there are several departures from the scheme described above. Here the tail has a gentle, scroll-like curve and no scallops. The legs are comparably postured, but the claws are simpler, trefoiled forms with a single streamer above and another below. There are no hands; the arms descend to the hips and their terminals replicate those of the legs. As a point of comparison, there are two, ovoid medallion forms within the central, barlike body similar to those of the Lakin A Tablet. The most impressive part of the Cincinnati Tablet design is the large, enigmatic head structure made up of two, symmetrically opposed motifs?polylobed forms that sprout from the body on serpentine stems. Within the motif is a small circular element with inwardly curving streamers. The combined, symmetrical forms of the head area are interpreted as a frontal face in which the negative elements include a grinning, toothy mouth, a small, diamond-shaped nose, and circular eyes with streamers. There are some problems in this interpretation, which will be discussed after more comparative material has been reviewed. Although there are many individual differences between the Cincinnati design and the Gaitskill Clay and Lakin A design, all present a similar, frontally displayed figure with linear tails, limbs with claw fin?ais, and thin, barlike bodies. The Wilmington and Meigs County tablets offer a similar compositional mode, but introduce several variant motifs. The lower portions of this design are very similar to those of the Gaitskill Clay and Lakin A design; there are large, scalloped tails?here widened to ovoid shapes?and symmetrically poised leg and claw motifs. These claws seem to resemble the Cincinnati Tablet variety because there is a central element with single</page><page sequence="12">14 David W. Penney element streamers or digits curling over the top and bottom. In addition, there is another spurlike element projecting up and out from the knee joint. The motifs found in the upper half of the Wilmington and Meigs County design are entirely new. Above the claw-foot motifs are compartmentalized areas containing a confusing set of elements: several small eye joints and curvilinear lines that bear no resemblance to arms or limbs. Rather, the motif suggests wings with feather stylizations. Contributing to this interpretation are the uppermost set of motifs?two facing bird heads with curving rapacious beaks. An interpretation of the birds as raptorial is reinforced by the calcarate elements of the claw motif. When the bird heads are turned sideways, however, they contain small, smiling human faces, and the curling beaks descend from their chins like beards. The "smiling face" motif is important and will be pointed out on several other tablet designs. Generally speaking, this pair of tablet designs still maintains the displayed aspect of the first designs discussed: they have flexed, splayed limbs; strict frontal poses?except the paired heads; and an almost heraldic symmetry. Only the substitution of motifs, such as the wings and head forms, distinguishes the first group from the second. The compositional mode of all five discussed thus far are essentially identical. The Berlin and Wright pair of tablets introduce a new compositional scheme. Although the Wright Tablet is incomplete, what remains closely corresponds to the right half of the Berlin Tablet design. The Berlin design apparently presents a profile of a raptorial bird using familiar motifs: a profile of a bird head in the upper right corner; a scalloped tail in the upper left; a foot-claw motif in the lower left; and an unrecognizable and damaged motif in the lower right corner. All of these motifs are attached to a thin, central, body bar. On the Wright Tablet fragment, the bird head and scalloped tail motif below are clearly visible. Both bird heads, especially the Wright Tablet, contain suggestions of the smiling face motif. The motifs in these tablets are not symmetrically paired, but the composition is still structured around a central, barlike body, and uses the same, regularly compartmentalized format as the other tablets. There is still a display quality of sorts in the way the motifs are presented and positioned. A similar manner of composition is found on the Waverly Tablet, although there is a new assemblage of motifs. The lower half of the design contains two claw-foot motifs, both of which are very similar to those on the Cincinnati Tablet. Relationships to the Cincinnati Tablet design are further indicated by the motif in the upper right that duplicates one of the paired, polylobed head motifs, including the circular eye with streamers. In the Waverly Tablet, the polylobed motif is paired with a relatively humanistic, polylobed face with circular eyes, a long, cylindrical nose descending between the eyes, and a circular mouth. Since the polylobed motif appears in the Waverly Tablet only once, the interpretation of the paired motif in the Cincinnati Tablet as a single, whole face is debatable.</page><page sequence="13">THE ADENA ENGRAVED TABLETS 15 The substitution of a naturalistic face for a polylobed motif in the Waverly Tablet, however, tends to affirm the polylobed motif as some sort of head form. As in the Berlin and Wright tablet design, the Waverly Tablet is asymmetrical. The motifs are, however, positioned in an extremely ordered, quadrant format, and all are attached to a central, barlike body. The concept of a tablet design as the compilation of motifs relegated to a compartmentalized, rectangular format is taken a step further in the Lakin design. Here the barlike body is disposed of altogether, and the design consists instead of eight boxes, grouped two by four, in which the different motifs are incised. Some motifs are already familiar: the scalloped, ovoid tails found in the lower left and upper right corners, and the smiling face just visible in the upper left corner. This smiling face has no association with a bird head. In this regard it somewhat parallels the rather incongruous appearance of the motif in the Lakin A design?near the left edge without any relationship to the primary figure. In both instances, the face retains its curling appendages, although they do not suggest bird beaks. Including these two faces, the bird motif makes six appearances in the thirteen tablet designs examined here (see Norona 1950c for a discussion of the face motif). The box in the lower right corner of the Lakin design is unintelligible. With the exception of this segment, the overall positioning of the motifs displays a radial symmetry; the vertical series of motifs on the right would be in the same sequence as those on the left if rotated 180 degrees. The motifs in the center of the design are somewhat more difficult to identify. The upper left and lower right boxes of the inner quadrangle vaguely resemble the Wilmington Tablet wing motifs, as they have many curvilinear elements and eye joints. The more fluid curves of the upper right and lower left boxes might best be described as a series of concentric ovals bent double. These more closely resemble the wing motifs of the Meigs County Tablet, and possibly the damaged motif visible in the lower right corner of the Berlin Tablet. The Allen and Grave Creek Tablet designs might be interpreted as the result of the tendency, taken to the highest degree, to compartmentalize tablet designs. The compositional mode apparently survives but the content is gone. Both tablets present a series of curvilinear motifs roughly approximating the form of concentric circles (this is assuming that Schoolcraft and Eastman did in fact "clean up" the Grave Creek design in their renditions). Some of the curvilinear motifs of the Allen Tablet resemble the folded ovoid motif mentioned in connection with the Lakin Tablet, but they do not generally resemble anything. It is possible that these seemingly abstract forms had some meaning that escapes modern eyes, or perhaps the designs represent a degeneration of the tradition and are merely empty approximations of the more fully conceived designs. The Kiefer and Gaitskill Stone tablets offer exceptions to the general tendencies, although they also include already noted traits. The Kiefer</page><page sequence="14">16 David W. Penney Tablet is incomplete and offers only a portion of a design. In all likelihood, Webb and Baby (1957:87) correctly interpreted this design fragment as a tail motif, from which they reconstruct a Wilmington and Meigs County type of bird design. In reality, however, any assemblage of motifs might have accompanied this tail, and the upper portion of the tablet cannot be definitely determined. Moreover, the tail motif is filled in with a pattern of diagonally oriented, parallel stripes. This is a highly atypical treatment of decorative space in Adena tablet art. But the jagged contour of the tail, indications of a central body bar, and suggestions of claw-foot motifs place this fragmentary design in close association with other tablet designs. The Gaitskill Stone Tablet presents a more difficult problem. Its design includes several atypical features: no compartmentalization of design segments, no central body bar, and no motifs that can be extracted from the context for comparison. Instead, the overall design seems to resemble a single, compartmentalized motif itself?a polylobed face. In particular, the Gaitskill Stone design can be compared to the face in the upper left of the Waverly Tablet. Both have a comparable arrangement of facial features: a horizontal brow element from which a long nose descends between circular eyes, and a circular, dotlike element framed by a linear semicircle at the bottom of the face. The Gaitskill Stone design has additional elements including a denticulate bar, two teardrop shapes, and a linear chevron interposed between the nose element and lower dot. Although the compositional mode of the Gaitskill Stone Tablet is unique, the design itself is closely related to an individual motif. Adena tablet designs tend to be the sum total of their motifs. Some tablets, such as the Lakin A, escape the overt compartmentalization of the motifs, and yet their designs can be broken down into units for which there are counterparts in more compartmentalized formats. The same is true of the Gaitskill Stone Tablet, which can be regarded as the representation of a single, compartmentalized motif. The tendency in Adena tablet art to conceive of designs as assemblages of motifs with less emphasis on compositional structure is repeated by the design found on an engraved skull fragment from the Florence Mound (Webb and Haag 1940:126, Fig. 69). Here a disarticulated bird head, claw, wing, and tail are arranged around the circular contour of a disk. The compositional schemes of Adena tablets may be merely a function of the rectangular shape of the stone vehicle. The different conventions of composition?frontal/symmetrical, profile/assymmetrical, disarticulated/radially symmetrical?only reflect the motifs' positions in the rectangular scheme and the relationships between neighboring motifs. The actual method of composition is almost always the same: a regular arrangement of design units on a rectangular field. The striking thing about the tablet collection is that all tablets are found to have at least some motifs in common?some more, some less. This demonstrates the unity of the artistic complex as a whole. The contrasts</page><page sequence="15">THE ADENA ENGRAVED TABLETS 17 between tablet designs occur mainly in style, the manner in which the design is executed and interpreted by the artist. This topic, which is very revealing about the Adena tablet complex, will be taken up after a discussion of the hypothetical functions and social utility of the tablets. Functional Analysis A common interpretation of engraved tablet function is that they were used to print designs on some material or person. So far as I know, this opinion was first expressed in 1843 (Anonymous 1843:195) in reference to the Cincinnati Tablet: "Could we suppose those who made it to be possessed of the art of stamping or printing, we might imagine this stone to be an engraving for that purpose. Its face is almost as even as the engraving from which we print." This was also the interpretation of the most recent writers on the subject, Webb and Baby (1957:96). Features of some of the tablets support this idea. For example, engraved surfaces are flat and smooth like a printing plate. There are no perforations or apparent means of suspension as a decorative pendant would have. A feature of the Meigs County and the Wilmington designs also support this interpretation. These tablets are often described, as they were above, as being bilaterally symmetrical. This is not entirely true. Both the tablets exhibit a positive to negative reversal of the figure and ground relationships on either side of the median line. The head and beak on the left side of the Wilmington Tablet remain as the upper portion of the relief surface, and the background and facial features are carved away. On the right side, the head and beak are indicated by cutting away outlines in a raised background. Similarly in the foot-claw motifs, the background is the upper surface on the left side, with the foot motif linearly carved into it; on the right side the background is carved away, leaving the upper surface as the foot form. The reversals extend to the scallops of the tail. These contrived relationships are not readily observable in the stone tablet itself, but are obvious and are seen to best advantage in the graphic image the tablet would print. When printing is hypothesized as a function of the engraved tablets, it is commonly assumed that relief printing was the method used. In this manner the carved away portions of the tablet appear as white space in the printed design, and the upper surface of the tablet takes ink and produces an image. Many of the tablet designs were produced by line incising, and the efficiency of these would be problematic in a printing process utilizing the relief method. The designs exhibit little attempt to create a pattern likely to print well in relief. The indentations are shallow, and the linear elements are thin and complex. It is possible that the intaglio method of printing was used. In this process, the tablet would be inked and the upper surfaces wiped clean,</page><page sequence="16">18 David W. Penney leaving ink in the recesses. This hypothesis is supported by the Gaitskill tablets because they were stained with red pigment which had accumulated in the depressed areas (Webb and Baby 1957:96). On the Meigs County Tablet, accumulations of brown pigment were observed along the upper edges of the carved recesses, whereas the lower portions of the incised lines had apparently been cleaned, since the exposed stone therein appeared fresher than the worked areas elsewhere on the tablet (for example, the sides). To keep the tablet functional for printing, a thorough cleaning of the incised design would have been imperative after every use. The appearance of the incisings with their clean interiors and pigment residue along the upper edges indicates that pigment was applied to the incisings and then cleaned out. The most likely interpretation of this feature of the Meigs County Tablet is that it resulted from repeated intaglio printing. Another point in favor of the intaglio hypothesis is that the edges of the carving in the relief tablets were brought down sharply, and that is not necessary in a relief block. (An exception to this is the Gaitskill Clay Tablet, which has sloping shoulders. See Webb and Funkhauser 1932:305.) Finally, the intaglio method is much more likely than the relief method to produce a successful print with the linearly incised tablets. The intaglio method of printing requires some rather restrictive procedures. Modern intaglio prints are made on paper with the help of elaborate presses that apply the medium to the plate under pressure so the paper is forced up into the recessed areas and thereby inked. Printing with a simple technology may have been accomplished as follows: the medium would be laid upon the inked stone and rubbed vigorously from the back in order to force the medium into the recesses. Adena people would have had to find a similar method and suitable media for the production of intaglio prints with engraved tablets. This would preclude the use of tablets on human skin as was suggested by Webb and Baby (1957:97). Also, fiber textiles found in Adena sites, apparently the same material used for the printed textiles of the Scioto Tradition (Shetrone 1931, Fig. 53), seem unsuitable because of inflexibility and weakness. An ideal medium for this method of printing would be leather. Leather is moldable, strong enough to withstand the process, and permanent enough to make the task worthwhile. The procedure leaves an embossed texture on the leather, enhancing the finished product's attractiveness. More ink could be applied under better controlled circumstances to enhance articulation and contrast. To facilitate more efficient handling of ink, some of the tablets have raised borders around the edges of the design field that create a trough just inside the borders. The Wilmington, Cincinnati, Waverly, Kiefer, Gaitskill Clay and Meigs County tablets have this feature. The incised tablets would not need it. The Wright and Gaitskill Stone tablets are the only relief tablets with open edges. These are the two simplest and most broadly conceived tablets in terms of design composition?meaning</page><page sequence="17">THE ADENA ENGRAVED TABLETS 19 that these would be the most suitable for conventional block printing. This suggests an alternative hypothesis for the pigment accumulations on the Gaitskill Stone Tablet. Perhaps the tablet's incisings were not cleaned, as were those of the Meigs County Tablet, since this tablet, along with the Wright and possibly the Gaitskill Clay, was used for relief printing. The pigment buildup in the recesses, to a certain degree, would be irrelevant to the tablet's printing efficiency. All of this assumes that a liquid ink was used. Webb and Baby have suggested red ocher mixed with animal fat, or even human blood (Webb and Baby 1957:97). Red ocher stains were found on the Berlin Tablet (Greenman 1932:484), and on the Gaitskill Clay Tablet (Webb and Funkhauser 1932:305). Stains described as "spots over it, both back and front, as if it had been sprinkled with blood" (Anonymous 1843:195) were found on the Cincinnati Tablet. Also, a stone disk with what appeared to be red ocher on one side occurred in the same mound with the Kiefer Tablet. Red ocher may have been produced by rubbing hematite against' stone tablets and heating the resultant powder (Solecki 1953:387-388), or by the heating of limonite (Winters 1969:26). The designface of the Meigs County Tablet was stained with a light brown pigment that is identical in color to the residue in the incisings described above. The residue pigment was more concentrated and thicker in consistency than the face stains. The brown stains do not appear as bright as most material reported as red ocher, and a comparison of this pigment with those stains mentioned above is impossible at this time. The coloration on the Meigs County Tablet may be limonite stains (Winters, personal communication: December 1977). The production of some sort of liquid paint from red ocher is confirmed since bones found in Adena burials are often painted with red ocher. The following example (Webb and Snow 1945:176) has been selected from numerous instances: On the skull of burial 8, Mound 6, probably a young adult female, there was found red ocher pigmentation in two distinct bands on the front of the skull. One of these bands crossed immediately above the orbits while the other was several inches above it on the upper portion of the frontal bones. Across these two red bands a vertical stripe of graphite about an inch wide extends from the top of the frontal bone down the forehead touching the tips of the nasal bone and extends to the front of the teeth. This feature suggests graphite as another possible source for printing pigment, since this mineral was found in association with the Lakin and Berlin tablets. Graphite is a relatively rare Adena trait, and is generally reported as small deposits of little granules in Adena burials. However, in view of the inadequacies of many Adena mound excavations, graphite may have been overlooked. Graphite is extremely soft and could be applied to a tablet merely by rubbing a solid piece against the printing face. Again,</page><page sequence="18">20 David W. Penney leather is a likely medium. It would have been soaked and applied to the tablet in a manner similar to the method described above. With this procedure, the tablet would print in relief, since only the upper surface would be marked with pigment, and the portions of leather forced into the engraved recesses would avoid contact with it. The soaked leather would become permanently stained with the dark graphite impression. This printing method seems especially suitable for the Berlin Tablet, because the finished print would be enhanced by its unique shape. With the entire tablet surface marked with graphite, the resulting image would have the negative incised design framed by a kind of cartouche. The same effect would be much more difficult with a liquid pigment, since it would be impossible to keep the ink from running into the incisings. The stains upon the Meigs County Tablet are consistent with the idea that a dry limonite, or hematite pigment may have been used for printing with the intaglio method. Dry pigment might have been sprinkled on the face of the stone, and the surface scraped to remove all pigment except that remaining in the carved recesses. Again, a medium saturated with liquid and applied to the tablet using the method described above would become stained with a reproduction of the design. To test this hypothesis, a simple experiment was performed with two plaster casts of the Cincinnati Tablet (AMNH nos. 1/623 and 1/1082) at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Both casts were made from the original stone. Talcum powder (hydrous magnesium silicate) was sprinkled on the design face of a cast and the excess was removed with the edge of a piece of cardboard. It was noticed that the design faces were consistently flat and level, which facilitated the removal of the talcum powder from the upper surfaces of the designs without disturbing the powder in the recesses. A similar consistent flatness was observed on the Meigs County Tablet. A piece of colored, cotton cloth was charged with static electricity and applied to the powdered tablet cast. On removing the cloth, the talcum powder clinging to it was found to reproduce the designs of the tablet casts with fine and complete articulation of detail. This experiment determines that when the printing procedure described above is used in conjunction with the Cincinnati Tablet (if not all the others) the result is a detailed reproduction. A variety of printing techniques and pigments have been suggested. The differences in tablet carving and design execution seem to indicate that practices were not uniform. It is possible that more than one method was used with a single stone to expand the possible effects. Because the Berlin Tablet was found with graphite and stained with red ocher, it suggests that at least this stone was used with both pigments, and perhaps even simultaneously with both relief and intaglio methods. Other suspected pigment materials have been found in Adena contexts. A white cone of some material was found with the Lakin tablets. A similar white material from Natrium Mound is thought to be paint stone (Solecki</page><page sequence="19">THE ADENA ENGRAVED TABLETS 21 1953:389). Manganese oxide, present in a bluish deposit, was also found at Natrium. Solecki suggests that this was a paint derivative as well (1953:386). The totemic appearance of most of the tablet designs leads some to believe that the tablet images were used singly, as some sort of ceremonial insignia (Webb and Baby 1957:97). However, a single tablet image on a garment would look as incongruous as a rather oversized laundry mark. It is more likely that tablet images were arranged in patterns. The result would be rich and luxurious, looking something like early Turkish carpets. Thinking of the tablet images as merely a component in an infinitely expandable design helps to explain the designs of the Allen and Grave Creek tablets. Their series of concentric circles would create much the same effect as the figured tablets would when expanded into an over-all pattern. Indeed, the whole progressive tendency of increasing compartmentaliza tion throughout the tablet collection can be seen as deriving from the increasing generalization of textile patterns, and the designs of the tablets becoming mere patterns themselves. Another function is postulated for the tablets because of abraded depressions on the backs of five of them. The Cincinnati and Wilmington tablets have worn grooves on the faces opposite the designs (Anonymous 1843:196; Greenman 1932:482). The Kiefer Tablet has a round, depressed area on the back, apparently because of abrasion (Greenman 1932:482). The Meigs County Tablet has three grooves on the reverse face. Two are shallow indentations, and one is longer and slightly deeper. All three abrasions are stained a light brown color identical to that on the design face. The Berlin Tablet has grooves on one face, but these occur with an incised design (Sylvester 1879:74). As noted, the Berlin Tablet has similar incised designs on either tablet face, and one design exhibits higher quality craftsmanship. The goooves are abraded on the side with the lesser quality carving. The relationship between the grooves and the design is revealing insofar as the timing of the groove abrasion and the application of the design. Two grooves were abraded into the tablet before the incising was done, since the incised lines continue uninterrupted through the shallow indentations. Another larger and deeper groove, apparently conscientiously placed to one side of the tablet face, was worn into the tablet after the application of the design because it interrupts an incised line (Sylvester 1879:74). Because of the uneven surface caused by the initial and subsequent grooving, it is doubtful that this face of the tablet was ever used for printing. It is difficult to understand why the design was applied to a grooved surface, unless perhaps it was a rehearsal for the opposite face. However, the record of abrasions and design application indicates that both practices were concurrent in the tablet's history. A reasonable assumption is that the case is the same for the other engraved tablets exhibiting grooves. Some hypotheses have been developed to determine the material being</page><page sequence="20">22 David W. Penney abraded by these tablets. Most of the evidence is based on plain Adena stone tablets that are similar in size, shape, and materials to the engraved tablets. Some of these have worn grooves on one or both faces. By analyzing artifacts associated with grooved tablets, both bone (Webb and Snow 1945) and hematite (Solecki 1953; Dragoo 1959), are hypothesized as being the material in question. The bone hypothesis is somewhat traditional. As noted, the Cincinnati Tablet was found associated with two pointed bone implements. In reference to the grooves on the face of the tablet, the report in American Pioneer said, "the gutters have the appearance of being worn by whetting pointed tools" (Anonymous 1843:196). Later discussions imply that the bone implements are the hypothesized "pointed tools" (Willoughby 1936:261). The original Adena Mound contained a burial that included a grooved sandstone tablet among the grave furniture, and a collection of 23 pointed bone artifacts. Mills, the excavator, felt the tablet was a whetstone for sharpening the bone implements (Mills 1902:470). Webb's findings in Kentucky corroborate the bone sharpener hypothesis. In several Adena mound burials, grooved and ungrooved tablets were found with various articles of worked bone, including many pointed objects. Examples of this tendency include Burials 4 and 8 in the Jo 9 Mound of the C &amp; O group near Paintsville, Kentucky. Here, worked bone and tablets always occurred together (Webb 1942). Evidence such as this prompted Webb to say in his discussion of grooved tablets (Webb and Snow 1945:93): "Such tablets are usually worked from fine grain sandstone, and these grooves appear to be the result of their use as whetstones for bone awls." The preceding evidence points to a similar function for engraved tablets with grooves. Webb and Baby (1957:97) hypothesize a ritual that involves ceremonial bloodletting with bone implements sharpened by engraved tablets. Contradictory evidence comes from West Virginia. The excavation of Natrium Mound revealed a quantity of grooved tablets, including one with a faceted piece of hematite found in situ in the tablet groove (Solecki 1953:364). A total of 13 tablets and 40 specimens of faceted hematite were recovered, often in burial association. These findings were interpreted by the excavator as follows (Solecki 1953:365): "The fortunate recovery of the faceted hematite stone associated with the grooved siltstone suggests that other similarly grooved stones also may have been used in the reduction of paints." W. H. Holmes was the first to suggest that the Cincinnati Tablet was a "mortar plate" for the reduction of "colors or medicines" (Holmes 1906:106). However, his corroborative evidence was based upon Mississippian palette stones from the southern states. Certainly the grooves on the Cincinnati Tablet show no indication that they were</page><page sequence="21">THE ADENA ENGRAVED TABLETS 23 produced by sharpening bone awls. As in the Meigs County Tablet, the indentations include both long troughs and broad, shallow depressions. The association of grooved tablets with hematite and red ocher in Adena sites is further reinforced by findings at Cresap Mound (Dragoo 1959). Nine tablets, three having grooves and all having abraded surfaces, were found in a cache near the top of the mound. All nine tablets were stained in varying degrees with red ocher, and pieces of hematite were scattered throughout the same mound stratum (Dragoo 1959:141). Other findings in the mound were described and interpreted as follows (Dragoo 1959:141): In the lower levels thirteen crude tablets were found associated with burials. . . . Of these thirteen tablets, ten are grooved and three are plain. All of the tablets except two are stained with red ochre. In the grooves of some of the tablets is a thick, pasty deposit of red ochre. . . . Associated with most of these tablets were worked and faceted pieces of hematite. In face of the evidence from Cresap Mound, Natrium Mound and other sites, there is now little doubt that the Adena tablets were used in the preparation of paint pigments of which red ochre was a major component. The data from the Adena mounds in Kentucky do not support Dragoo's conclusion. Grooved tablets occur in these mounds with approximately the same frequency as they did in Natrium and Cresap, but are not in association with hematite. Mounds Wright 6 and Wright 7 together contained nine sandstone tablets, including six with grooves, and seven "abrading stones" but no specimens of hematite whatsoever (Webb and Haag 1940:54-55,109). There were 3 sandstone tablets in the Jo 2 Mound, and 15 in Jo 9. Only a small number of hematite artifacts were found, and these were such carefully worked objects as hemispheres and plummets (Webb 1942:339). This brief survey of the literature suggests that there are regional differences in Adena tablet use. As we shall see, regional differences between various tablet features are prevalent. However, the fact that the grooves on the Meigs County Tablet are stained with the same brown pigment that appears on the printing face lends strong support to the idea that the grooves on engraved tablets resulted from their use in grinding pigments for printing, whatever the function of plain-grooved tablets. Dragoo found two varieties of tablet material, each with its particular type of wear mark, among the grooved tablet collection recovered from Cresap. Dragoo interpreted this by saying, "Although both groups of tablets show use as abrasive tools, their surfaces seem to indicate that they were used for abrasion or grinding of different kinds of materials" (Dragoo 1959:139). It seems reasonable to conclude that the plain Adena tablets were general grinding tools used for the abrasion of many different materials. The development of engraved tablets may represent a</page><page sequence="22">24 David W. Penney specialization of function. The Meigs County Tablet has the appearance of being frequently handled. The long sides are smoothed as if the user had often grasped the tablet around the middle. The side edges on the grooved face are beveled, suggesting the tablet had been used to work a broad, flat surface. Thus, traces of general use are still to be found on a rather specialized example of Adena tablet. Only careful comparative examination of all the engraved tablets and their wear marks can shed additional light on this question. Style and Distribution This study has thus far regarded the collection of tablets as a whole, as a discrete set of artifacts reflecting a homogeneous tradition, although certain references have been made to regional characteristics. The approximate recovery point of each tablet is detailed and plotted on a map (Fig. 1). Stylistic qualities of individual tablets tend to group themselves into geographic clusters of recovery sites, and thus the tablet collection shows strong indications of regional stylization. The recovery sites themselves can be grouped into three general areas. The broadest, in terms of geographic expanse, is an area in the western portion of Ohio that includes site locations of the Cincinnati, Wilmington, Kiefer, and Waverly tablets. If the Wilmington site in Clinton County is regarded as the center, the other tablet sites are located no more than 50 miles from this point in any direction. This set of tablets may therefore be termed the Wilmington Group. These tablet designs exhibit some remarkable correspondences in style and execution. All are carved in bas-relief and show similar proportions of open to linear carving. All have the raised border attribute associated hypothetically with printing technique, and thus display a uniform printing method. The designs of this group are characterized by the use of strongly undulating line and soft, fluctuating curves. Raised linear elements rarely remain the same width as they meander through the designs. The rounded, bloated forms appear compressed and squeezed into place when combined with the crowded compositional scheme. This style is especially visible in motifs such as limbs, claws, and polylobed head. Furthermore, all tablets show a high level of finish and a meticulous quality of craftsmanship. The second group of tablets define a much tighter geographical cluster: two sites in Montgomery County, Kentucky. This group includes the Gaitskill tablets and the Wright Tablet. It is aptly called the Montgomery Group. The Montgomery Group also exhibits stylistic uniformity. Again, all of the tablets are carved in bas-relief, but the designs are composed of much broader, more legibly solid elements, and have more clearly articulated relationships between field and ground than the Wilmington Group. The</page><page sequence="23">THE ADENA ENGRAVED TABLETS 25 effect is a more monumental composition. The designs appear heavy, static, and centrally massed as opposed to the writhing, serpentine quality of the appendages in the Wilmington Group. The Gaitskill Stone and the Wright tablets are the only members of the tablet collection that are carved in relief and have open edges without any sort of border. This may indicate a variation in printing technique peculiar to Kentucky. The Gaitskill Clay Tablet has a raised border, and in terms of style, it is the most Wilmington-like of the group. However, it possesses few of the irregular curves and undulating passages which characterize the Wilmington Group designs. The third geographic center comprises those portions of Meigs County, Ohio, and Mason County, West Virginia, situated on opposite shores, along the Ohio River. The Meigs County, Allen, and Lakin Tablet recovery sites cluster within this area. The Grave Creek Tablet was found farther up river near Moundsville, West Virginia, and will be included in this last set as the group's most eastward extension. These tablets will collectively be referred to as the Upper Ohio River Group. The Berlin Tablet was found between the general locations of the groups defined above, and accordingly, exhibits intermediary characteristics. It will be discussed with this third group, however, for purposes of clarity. Five out of these last six tablets are entirely linearly incised. The exception is the Meigs County Tablet, which, of all the relief-carved tablets, has the sketchiest execution, employs more linear elements, and basically reflects more of an incising rather than relief-carving tradition. Again, the incised technique would suggest a regional variation in printing method. Stylistically, this group exhibits the most variation. Many of the designs appear summarily conceived and sloppily executed. The Lakin A Tablet, however, is masterfully drawn. It is composed of short, staccato lines that result in a much more lively and dynamic effect than found elsewhere. The Lakin and Meigs County designs take on more the aspect of sketches, showing a lack of finish and technical virtuosity. Designs are composed of many independent, unconnected lines arranged in cursive parallelisms. In direct contrast is the linear design of the Berlin Tablet, composed primarily by the graceful execution of a single, gently meandering contour that traces the unbroken outline of the raptorial bird form. The linear incising characterizes the Upper Ohio River Group; the legibility of form relates to the Montgomery Group; and the grace and fluidity of movement typify the highly developed Wilmington Group style. Appropriately, the Berlin Tablet recovery site is almost centrally located between the locations of the tablet groupings. The best demonstration of the contrasting characteristics of regional style is a comparison of the three, similarly conceived, displayed figure tablets?the Cincinnati, Gaitskill Clay, and Lakin A tablets, each from one</page><page sequence="24">26 David W. Penney of the three respective groups. The corresponding anatomical parts of each figure are easily observable. Comparing part to part, the contrasting peculiarities of style come to light: the undulating contortions of the Cincinnati Tablet, the static monumentality of the Gaitskill Clay Tablet, and the dancelike agitation of the Lakin A Tablet. As this comparison shows, the various iconographie subjects represented in tablet designs are evenly distributed throughout the three geographical groupings. Each group includes examples of nearly all the individual subjects and motifs. The only tendency in subject matter which can be related to regional style is the increasing abstraction?to the extent of practically purging content?in some tablets of the Upper Ohio River Group (although it is possible that this is an aspect of style as it is with the Lakin Tablet). The Allen and Grave Creek tablets are unique in many respects and both are associated with the Upper Ohio River Group. On the other hand, the most common subject and motif forms?the smiling face, the claw-foot, the displayed figure, and the raptorial bird?can be found in any of the three groups. This is to say that the most important features of iconography, and several actual designs, were shared among the regional styles. The combined pattern of regional stylization and shared iconography allows some interesting conclusions. Style reflects local tradition and is subject to the mental template of individual artists. Iconography represents ideas. The Adena tablet designs seem to refer to a set of shared concepts underlying strong local traditions as represented by design interpretation and indications of variant printing techniques. Iconography shared among various local traditions is evidence of some sort of political, social, or perhaps religious and ceremonial development coalescing the regional manifestations of Adena culture. A picture develops of geographically isolated centers of artistic activity sharing a system of ideas and beliefs that is reflected in common imagery. The relationship of this system of ideas and imagery to the larger scheme of midwestern art and iconography of the Middle Woodland period is uncertain, although some correspondence is suggested. Certainly the raptorial bird representation looms large in the sphere of Middle Woodland symbology. Such artful documents as the Scioto copper plate designs from the Hopewell and Tremper sites, and the bird designs found on H ope well ceramics (frequently associated with the Havana Tradition of Illinois), can be successfully compared to the Berlin and Wright tablet images. The monstrous form of the polylobed head motif, and perhaps the appendaged head of the Gaitskill Stone Tablet, provoke a comparison with the well-known horned monster of Scioto art as seen, for example, in the famous effigy boat stone from the Tremper site, now at the Peabody Museum, Harvard. Unfortunately, the broad picture of Middle Woodland period art is so little understood that not much more than this can be said.</page><page sequence="25">THE ADENA ENGRAVED TABLETS 27 It is hoped that this study, which focuses on a single, definable component of Middle Woodland period art, will spark interest in other areas and issues, making possible the broader synthesis and real understanding.
