DEVELOPMENT OF THE inflatable occupant restraint sys- tem (IORS) has been occurring for 8 years. Performance of early systems was largely measured by frontal crash simula- tions with anthropomorphic test devices and primates. Results of these tests indicated a significant improvement in occupant protection over all other known protection systems. The suc- cessful deployment of these early IORS required the release of substantial quantities of gas flow energy in efforts to "get the bag up in time" and provide enough "fill" to arrest the occu- pant under these frontal crash simulations. Such bag deploy- ments resulted in high deployment forces, with correspondingly high noise levels. Much of the present controversy surround- ing the IORS is concerned with these side effects and addi- tional crash considerations such as an out-of-position occupant, the presence of a standing child, secondary crash capability, and rollover protection. The key to the solution of these prob- lems, and optimization of the IORS, is the proper utilization and control of the required deployment energy or "energy management." The purpose of this paper is to discuss theoretical consider- ations and techniques in managing three types of energy associ- ated with IORS: gas flow energy, gas velocity energy, and gas pressure energy. The management of gas flow energy is the control of the volumetric flow rate out of the inflator- flow control. The management of gas velocity energy involves the transfer of energy associated with a high velocity gas stream to aspirate ambient air- aspirating inflator. The management of gas pressure energy is the utilization of gas pressure to selec- tively pressurize regions of the cushion for air aspiration- aspi- rating bag. GAS FLOW ENERGY- THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS Management of gas flow energy is directed toward the elimi- nation of excessive accelerations imparted to the standing child. If an IORS can be deployed gently, so as not to injure the small, 31 lb, 3 ft child standing against the system, while still saving the adult in a simulated barrier crash, "successful" bag deployment has been achieved. Additionally, experience has shown that other problem areas, such as noise and out-of- position adults, are also reduced when deployments are "suc- cessful." When an IORS system is deployed it imparts accelerations to an occupant by means of bag pressure, bag momentum, and deployment door momentum. The 3-1/2 year old child stand- ing against the system maximizes these accelerations. To min- imize the peak accelerations, three distinct fill rate versus time curves are required, depending upon whether the system has low, medium, or high momentum. A low momentum system is characterized by low bag mass, low deployment cover mass (a stretched plastic film), and low forward bag speeds. For this case, a high initial flow is desired which causes the lightweight bag to "water-wing" around the child and slightly pressurizes the bag. At this point, the volumetric flow rate should decrease so as to maintain a constant or decreasing bag pressure, as shown in Fig. 1. A medium momentum system is characterized by a low mass deployment door, or one which cannot contact the stand- ing child, plus moderate forward bag and gas momentum. ABSTRACT Inflatable occupant restraint systems (IORS) are categorized according to high, medium, and low momentum air bag de- ployment energies. Theoretical flow curves for these catego- ries are presented which minimize deployment accelerations imparted to out-of-position occupants, in particular the stand- ing child. Practical techniques to achieve these flow curves for stored gas, augmented gas, and solid inflators are presented. Aspirating systems are described, and their superiority over direct fill systems is indicated. 1353</page><page sequence="2">1354 W. R. CAREY, ET AL. For this case, a small initial flow pulse is desired, as shown in Fig. 2, which opens the deployment door. Then the flow is in- creased until gas momentum maintains proper acceleration on the child and until the bag's residual volume is filled. At this point, flow is decreased and maintained at a rate giving con- stant or slightly decreasing bag pressure and pressure-induced acceleration. A high momentum system is characterized by a high mass deployment door (2-4 lb) which contacts the standing child, plus high bag and gas momentum from small gas diffusion angles or short diffuser lengths. In this situation, a high initial flow pulse is desired which opens the deployment door and accelerates the bag. The sys- tem then waits until the bag and deployment door contact the child, at which time the flow is restarted and gradually increased, maintaining constant gas momentum and bag pres- - THEORETICAL - - TYPICAL 100, , 1 1 1 /BAG /BAG CONTACT /BAG PRESSURIZES 'L?

Decreasing flow is then re- quired as pressure predominates. Following is a discussion of how these theoretical flow curves can be obtained with stored gas inflators, augmented inflators, and all solid inflators. FLOW CONTROL TECHNIQUES STORED GAS INFLATORS - As discussed and shown in Figs. 1-3, minimization of the standing child acceleration re- quires gas flows of 1.5-7 ft in 10 ms, depending upon whether the system has high or low momentum. Early stored gas sys- tems had the inherent characteristic of providing the highest flow rate at the beginning of the deployment, useful for a low momentum system. However, bags were constructed of heav- ily coated nylon fabric, and diffusion volumes and angles were small and narrow, resulting in a high momentum system. This combined the flow curve for a low momentum system with a high momentum system. Deployment typically produced noise levels of 1 65 dB(A) dur- ation and 1 57 dB(B) duration and no permanent hearing shifts (1).* A normally seated occupant experienced only slight de- ployment-induced accelerations; however, the child standing against the system suffered because he received the initial mo- mentum from the bag and deployment door, followed by the gas momentum and pressure effects until sufficient spacing was achieved. Deployment with a 3-year Sierra toddler standing against the system produced approximately 150 g chest accel- eration, and 2000 head severity index, far above the FMVSS 208 limits. To reduce these excessive g levels, a large volume diffuser *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. - THEORETICAL TYPICAL 100 1 - ~1 STANDING CHILD Ł CHEST ACCEL - G 50 ¡I w' 0 1 1000 r FLOW RATE INTO _ 500 BAG - FT3/SEC _ , 1000 DIFFUSER PRESSURE - PSIG 500 ° 0 20 40 60 80 100 MILLISECONDS Fig. 3 - Flow curves for high momentum systems</page><page sequence="3">ENERGY MANAGEMENT IN IORS 1355 O (120 in ) was used and an eyebrow was added to the dash, which spaced the child 3 in from the system and out of range of the deployment cover. Standing child results were then reduced to the acceptable limits of 500 head severity and 60 chest g, while maintaining single adult performance of 1200 head severity and 80 g chest acceleration in a 40 mph sled test, and 60 g chest acceleration with an estimated 900 head severity in a 45 mph 1970 Mercury Brougham barrier crash (2). This improvement occurred because the elimination of the deployment cover contact through guaranteed spacing, plus the use of large diffuser volumes, produced flow and accelera- tions similar to those of Fig. 2, which changed it from a high to a medium momentum system. In 1970 the system was relocated, heavier deployment doors were required, a knee bag was incorporated, and initial small child stand-off distance could not be ensured. Thus, a high mo- mentum system resulted, requiring a flow curve which could not be achieved by increased diffuser volume or increased dif- fusion angles. In order to approximate the flow curves of Fig. 3 required for this high momentum system, a variable orifice device with Fig. 4 - Flow control before poppet motion Fig. 5 - Flow control during poppet motion an initial volume was developed. This device is schematically illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5, and operates in the following manner: v 1 . Thé valve opens, discharging the gas from the initial vol- ume into the bag. 2. The trapped volume behind the poppet starts to lose pres- sure by flow through the poppet into the initial volume. Flow into the bag is maintained by the parallel flow holes shown in Fig. 4. During this period, the bag and deployment door open and contact the standing child's chest. 3. As the chest acceleration peaks, the pressure forces ex- erted on the poppet become balanced. The poppet then moves rearward asi the gas in the trapped volume continues to vent. Larger orifices are thus uncovered, increasing the volumetric flow as shown in Fig. 5. 4. When the poppet is fully retracted, normal bottle "blow- down" occurs. Using this system, acceptable standing child results of 500 head severity and 50 g chest acceleration have been achieved, while maintaining fill sufficiently fast to meet FMVSS 208 during 30 mph barrier tests. The differences between the actual fill curves of this device and the ideal high momentum fill curves shown in Fig. 3 are due to the smoothing effect of diffuser volume and the inabil- ity to instantaneously restart flow€ Ideal flow restart should begin at the moment when deployment momentum and chest acceleration peak. The time-delay period between initial vol- ume flow and flow restart is dependent on initial occupant spacing and bag fill rate. Another method of approximating the required flow time relationship is to use two valves in combination with parallel flow ^a« shown in Fig. 6. The operation of this system is as follows: v 1 . Main valve opens, discharging the initial volume into the bag. 2 The flow is sustained by gas passing through the parallel flow holes. 3. After a specified electronic or pyrotechnic delay, the second valve opens, releasing the remaining gas. Typical flow and chest results obtained from this method of managing deployment energies are shown in Fig. 7. The re- sults of initial tests of this concept showed that the lack of control on the rise time of the main flow induced high chest and head accelerations on the standing child. AUGMENTED INFLATORS - In addition to the aforemen- tioned stored gas inflators under evaluation, augmented in- Fig. 6 - Dual-stage stored gas</page><page sequence="4">1356 W. R. CAREY, ET AL. flators, incorporating several types of gas flow energy manage- ment techniques, also are being developed. Augmented in- flator is a shortened term for a stored gas reservoir augmented with pyrotechnic or chemical gas generation. This type of in- flator consists of a reservoir of high pressure gas and an inte- gral propellant or chemical charge which adds heat and addi- tional gas to the system. The addition of heat to the stored ga is desirable because adiabatic expansion of the high pressure gas at room temperature results in a gas temperature in the bag of approximately -40 F. Typically, the augmenting charge raises the gas temperature of the exhaust by 300-600 F and provides 2-5% additional gas from the products of combustion. Combining these two effects results in augmented inflator vol- umes about one half the volume of an equivalent performing stored gas system at equal storage pressures. In a single-stage augmented inflator shown in Fig. 8 for a high momentum system, energy management is achieved with a flow control valve similar to that used in the stored gas sys- tem. Operation of the inflator begins when the main valve opens, releasing gas from the reservoir in a controlled manner H IA I 1 i II i STANDING CHILD I 1 STANDING ™ CHILD i «vi I 1 1 I 1 1000 FLOW RATE INTO BAG-FT3/SEC 500 1 ^ ob/NUJ ^ I 1000 DIFFUSER PRESSURE -PSIG 500 fV 0 0 20 40 60 80 100 MILLISECONDS Fig. 7 - Flow curves for dual-stage stored gas Fig. 8 - Single-stage augmented gas generator with flow control via the flow control. The propellant or augmenting charge is ignited after a Fixed delay and at a time when the flow control valve is partially open. The purpose of this time delay is to prevent the propellant charge from burning while the gas dis- charge from the inflator is restricted, keeping the pressure in the reservoir below the service pressure of the vessel. Fig. 9 s shows a typical gas flow curve obtained with this inflator. A dual-level augmented inflator, shown in Fig. 10, can be used to develop the required flow characteristics for medium momentum systems. This system must be used with multisig- nal level crash sensors to obtain the differential inflations. Low-level sensors typically trigger from crashes equivalent to a 10 mph barrier; high-level sensors trigger at approximately 20 mph. Upon receipt of the low-level crash sensor signal, the main valve is opened and the forward low-level propellant charge ig- nited. The gas in the main reservoir, now augmented by the burning first-stage propellant, discharges. At a later time (typ- ically 20 ms in a 30 mph barrier) the second high-level pro- pellant charge is ignited to further augment the gas in the main reservoir to provide the increased output needed to protect the occupant in a high speed crash. Fig. 1 1 shows typical gas flow curves obtained with this inflator in both the low-level mode (crashes between 10 and 20 mph) and the high-level mode (crashes over 20 mph). ALL-SOLID INFLATORS - All-solid inflators require dif- ferent flow control techniques for management of gas flow energy.

A variable gas flow rate, suitable for use with a high mo- mentum system shown in Fig. 3, can be obtained in an all-solid gas generator by employing a complex cored grain, as shown in Fig. 12. This cored grain has a high initial surface area to produce a relative burn rate of 1 . Upon ignition the gas pro- duction peaks, then decreases to a relative burn rate of 0.5 as the star-shaped core burns circular. Burn rate then increases to a maximum as the propellant burns through to the axial holes, exposing additional surface area to the flame front (Fig. 13). Another method which may be used is an end burning com- posite propellant grain having layers of propellant with differ- ing burn rates (Fig. 14). The initial layer of propellant burns resulting in the desired system opening pulse, followed by a period of lower gas generation from the slow burning layer, and again increasing as the final, fast-burning layer is ignited.

GAS MOMENTUM ENERGY- AIR ASPIRATING INFLATOR Associated with any IORS gas source is a region of high ve- locity gas flow with its associated gas momentum energy. The air aspirating inflator utilizes this momentum energy to induce vehicle compartment air to flow into the bag. Fig. 15 shows the essential features of this system. The gas from the gas source referred to as primary gas is directed into the bag by means of a series of nozzles. As the primary gas flows through the nozzles, the ambient air in the vicinity of the nozzles is induced to move in the direction of the primary gas stream, due to the transfer of gas momentum energy. One- way flapper valves, located in the vicinity of the nozzles, per- mit vehicle compartment air to enter the momentum transfer region. This induction process continues until a bag pressure is obtained against which the system can no longer aspirate. This pressure is known as the stall pressure. At this point, the one-way flapper valves close and the remainder of the pri- mary gas continues to flow into the bag. A measure of performance of an aspirator is called the pump- ing ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the volume of as- pirated ambient air to the volume of gas supplied by the gas source.

It is of the form: rfi = rh0e"kt (1) where: ih = mass flow rate, lb/s ih0 = initial mass flow rate, lb/s 1/k = flow time constant, s t = time, s This is similar to that of a stored gas pressure vessel exhaust- ing through a fixed orifice. The resulting aspirator operating characteristics are shown in Fig. 17. The initial high stall pres- sure allows the system to deploy in the presence of a cover or deployment door. Fig. 17 also shows that the pumping ratio increases with time; that is, each cubic foot of primary gas re- leased aspirates proportionately more air as time goes on. The net result is the unobstructed gas output curve shown. The actual output with a bag is slightly reduced because the sys- tem stalls once the bag is filled and the stall pressure is ob- tained. However, in the presence of an obstruction such as a standing child, the net output is significantly reduced due to the early stall caused by the presence of the child. This pro- vides low accelerations due to deployment momentum and allows the child to "ride" the car deceleration pulse down in a barrier crash. The unique operating characteristics of this method of in- flation offer the following potential advantages over present conventional direct fill systems: 1 . REDUCED GAS SOURCE REQUIREMENTS - Current investigation indicates an average pumping ratio of approxi- mately 1 .5 : 1 ; that is, 1 .5 ft of ambient air is aspirated for each cubic foot of gas supplied by the gas source.

REDUCED NOISE AND VEHICLE COMPARTMENT PRESSURIZATION - The smaller net displaced compartment air volume and the mixing of the high velocity primary gas with the aspirated ambient air results in lower noise levels. 3. REDUCED STANDING CHILD AND OUT-OF-POSI- TION OCCUPANT SEVERITY - The presence of a child stand- ing against the system or an out-of-position adult causes the system to stall, which reduces the total gas output with a cor- responding reduction in deployment severity, thus making this a medium to low momentum system. 4. IMPROVED TOXICITY AND TEMPERATURE - With a gas generator (either augmented or solid) used as the gas source, any adverse temperature or toxicity effects are auto- matically reduced because of the inherent mixing of the pri- mary gas with the aspirated air. 5 . MULTIPLE CRASH CAPABILITY - Due to the inherent characteristic of high pumping ratio and low stall pressure at low primary gas flow rates, a small amount of primary gas re- leased over a several second interval could cause reinflation for a secondary impact. In order to fully realize the potential advantages of this method of inflation, two considerations must be taken into ac- count in applying this system to the vehicle. First, sufficient airflow path equal or greater than the aspirator inlet area must be provided so as not to "choke" the aspirator. Flow restric- tions will reduce the overall pumping efficiency and must be compensated for by additional primary gas. Second, it is de- sirable to locate the system in an upper mount position, utiliz- ing the instrument panel for lower torso restraint. Due to the relationship between the stall pressure and the total gas out- put, the presence of severe deployment restrictions, such as complete blockage by an out-of-position 95th percentile male's knees, would affect the system performance. In addi- tion to a premature stall, the pumping efficiency would be re- duced due to flow restrictions imposed by the knees. GAS PRESSURE ENERGY-AIR ASPIRATING BAG Associated with any IORS is the ability to provide gas pres- sure energy. The air aspirating bag utilizes this gas pressure energy to aspirate vehicle compartment air into a specially de- signed bag. Fig. 18 shows the essential features of the system. The sys- tem consists of a gas source, an inflatable tubular structure in- stalled within the bag, and a series of one-way flapper valves located in the surface of the bag. During deployment, the gas source pressurizes the tubular structure which, because of its configuration, geometrically deploys the bag. The flapper valves then allow the vehicle compartment air to be "scooped" into the deployed bag surface. Upon subsequent bag loading by the occupant, the valves close and entrap the aspirated air which is then used to decelerate the occupant in a conven- tional manner. Fig. 19 is a sequence of pictures showing a static deploy- ment of an air aspirating bag in front of a seated 50th percen- tile male dummy. The system was "driven" by a stored gas inflator. The com- 3 ponent values used in this system were: bag volume, 12 ft ; 3 3 tube volume, 3.1 ft ; reservoir volume, 75 in ; and reservoir pressures, 3500 psi Static deployment resulted in a 60 ms fill time and a sound level of 146 peak dB(A) weighted. Sled tests have indicated that the system in its present stage of development is capable of meeting FMVSS 208 performance standards in a 20-25 Fig. 18 - Air aspirating bag system, front seat passengers Fig. 19 - Air aspirating bag, static deployment</page><page sequence="8">1360 W. R. CAREY, ET AL. mph simulated barrier crash. Fig. 20 shows a sequence of pic- tures taken from a 25 mph barrier crash simulation. The operating characteristics of this system offer the fol- lowing potential advantages over present conventional direct fill systems: 1 . Reduced gas source requirements - The gas source re- quired to pressurize the tubular structure is less than that re- quired to fill the bag. This results in a gas source requirement approximately 40% of that required to fill the same size bag with a direct fill method. 2. Reduced compartment noise and pressurization - This is due to the smaller net displaced vehicle compartment air volume. 3. Multiple crash capability - As long as the tube pressure is maintained, the system will refill in the same manner as during the initial deployment. 4. Rollover protection - The pressurized tubes necessary to inflate the cushion, when properly designed, may provide roll- over protection. Fig. 21 shows an inflatable fabric tube sub- jected to three types of loading; bending, flattening, and crush- ing. The following equations give the maximum forces that can be sustained in each case when the tube material strength is sufficiently high to withstand the tensile stresses.

The results show that significant forces can be transmitted by a pressurized inflatable tube. 5. Reduced out-of-position occupant hazard - It has been shown that pressurized inflatable tubes can transmit significant forces. During initial deployment, however, the tubes are kinked, which greatly reduces their deployment severity on an out-of-position occupant or standing child. SUMMARY Successful protection of an automobile occupant, in or out of position, requires the careful consideration of guaranteed occupant spacing, deployment door mass, bag mass, and allo- cated space for packaging (diffusion length and angles). Each of these factors, singly or in combination, can produce low to high momentum systems requiring different energy manage- ment techniques. The required flow curves can be achieved by stored gas, augmented gas, or solid propellant inflators. Air aspirated systems come the closest to approximating the desired characteristics of low momentum systems, mainly due to their stall characteristics. Significant reductions in noise levels and accelerations to out-of-position occupants, in par- ticular the standing child, can be anticipated. REFERENCES 1. C. H.
