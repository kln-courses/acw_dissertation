<plain_text><page sequence="1">Deafness and Insight: On the Seductions of the Music/Language Analogy Ben Etherington Abstract: This article contends that close attention to music /language analogies allows us to perceive how language attempts to gain an understanding of its own cognitive nature. The article does so by closely reading Paul de Mans The Rhetoric of Blindness', an essay in which de Man suggests that a detailed look at the analogies between musical and linguistic structures made by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his Essay On the Origin of Languages helps reveal how literary criticism becomes 'blind' to its own metaphysical presuppositions. Scrutinizing the terms on which de Man engages Rousseau, the article argues that surface inconsistencies in de Man's use of musical concepts reveal a deeper pattern of 'deafness' which turns his notion of 'empty' subjectivity against itself. It concludes with some suggestions for how we might further develop the study of music /language analogies, a subject that has the potential to invigorate our understanding of the non-conceptual aspects of linguistic meaning. Keywords: Paul de Man, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Claude Lévi-Strauss, music/language analogies, musical thinking, philosophical aesthetics The analogy between language and music indicates something specific yet elusive. Language tends to be described as 'musical' when its 'body' - its sound and texture - is brought emphatically before us. The analogy seems to promise a meaning for this immediate, physical aspect of language by setting it within a system of significant interconnections. An attempt to determine a constant semantic pattern for the various claims to language's musicali ty, however, would miss the mark; this analogy wants to bring to attention something which cannot be held to an explanation. Yet, at the same time, there is rarely the sense that the analogy specifies an entirely arbitrary dimension of language. The music/language analogy has a complex historical character. Its attempt to bind two, constantly evolving expressive modes can Paragraph 33:1 (2010) 20-36 DOI: 1 0.3366/E0264833409000728</page><page sequence="2">Deafness and Insight : On the Seductions of the Music /Language Analogy 21 lead up blind alleys. The impulse to describe any fluid, sensual aspect of language whatsoever as 'musical' often relies on an arrested conception of music, emptying music of its life at the moment one had hoped to transfuse it. The resistance to the reification of language only ends up reifying music. The analogy can, for this reason, easily arouse scepticism, such as when Theodor Adorno criticizes the ' "musical" ' style of Swinburne and Rilke for their 'imitation of musical effects'. This mimicry, he claims, is remote from a 'true musicality' that 'energizes incipient intentions' without smugly 'indulging' them.1 Although the music /language analogy wants to illuminate the cognitive aspect of language's affectivity, it continually risks shackling one with a trite conception of the other. To insist, in view of this, that we should abstain from the analogy altogether, would be dogmatically to separate intentional from non- intentional forms of expression. This can be detected when the complaint is made that any writing on music is essentially futile, presuming as it does to pry open a non-linguistic medium with a linguistic one.2 Such a judgement implies that language is a transparent signifying instrument that definitively accounts for its own meaning, thereby confirming a rigid linguisticism negatively. If this dogmatism is to be avoided, we also need to be wary of the opposite situation in which all intentions and meanings slip from language as it slides into a vacuum of arbitrariness. This suggests that music/language analogies speak to something necessary: ; that they attempt to hold together kinds of meaning (intentional and non-intentional, rational and theological) that were not so easy to separate in the first place. I would like to develop this sense that an underlying necessity can precipitate and condition the music /language analogy by closely examining an ambitious attempt to use it to develop a critical theory of language. Paul de Man's 'The Rhetoric of Blindness: Jacques Derrida s reading of Rousseau' is the only essay in either edition of Blindness and Insight written specifically for that collection.3 In it he undertakes to draw the patterns of critical 'blindness' found in the first six essays into a 'somewhat more systematic formulation' (ix), addressing front-on the question only approached obliquely in the volume s previous essays: 'Is the blindness of these critics inextricably tied up with the act of writing itself, and, if this is so, what characteristic aspect of literary language causes blindness in those who come into close contact with it?' (106). De Man is finding his way to a critical practice that he believes will be adequate to the act of writing and to the particularity of literary language. He will later call this critical approach 'mere reading':4 a</page><page sequence="3">22 Paragraph method that purifies itself of aesthetic bias in order to prevent false attempts to seek out a sensuous subject in or behind the lines. 'Mere reading' has the potential to reverse what de Man regards to be the prevailing anti-linguistic hierarchy of the arts: 'whereas we have traditionally been accustomed to reading literature by analogy with the plastic arts and with music, we now have to recognize the necessity of a non-perceptual linguistic moment in painting and music, and to learn to read pictures rather than to imagine meaning'.5 Rodolphe Gasché helpfully paraphrases this: 'mere reading implies bracketing not only of the visual but of the auditive moment as well. A certain blindness and a certain deafness are required to keep the aesthetic categories from creeping back into the reading of literature' (WC, 117). 'Mere reading' does stop at the borders of language. De Man ultimately hopes for a non-aesthetic approach to all art. In 'The Rhetoric of Blindness', however, he feels the need first to bracket music from its auditive moment and so claim the prize scalp of musical 'presence' on music's own turf. Returning to language like Perseus with the head of Medusa he might then confidently set forth the project of 'mere reading' without aesthetic judgements blocking the way. De Man is seduced into believing that if he could first anaesthetize music he would be able to conquer, by analogy, his linguistic blindness and produce 'non-blinded' insights. Expelling the auditive moment from music turns out not to be a straightforward exercise. De Man does not engage directly with music, but asks Rousseau to do it for him. It will be Rousseau's analogy between musical and linguistic structures in Essay on the Origin of Languages that enables de Man to translate a non-aesthetic account of musical structure back into the linguistic sphere. His argument depends both on the strength of his close reading of Rousseau's comments on music, and on the strength of Rousseau's own analogy between music and language. We will hear a determined slippage between what de Man says and what he means to say which follows from his appropriation of musical concepts used by Rousseau. In pointing to this 'deafness' I do not wish to introduce an external device with which to dismantle his argument: just as de Man pursues the path of immanence, I will hold his substantive claims against the materials and rhetoric he calls on to make those claims, and perhaps discover in his deafness a new variation of that 'awareness (. . .) directed against itself' (118) that he finds in the critics he studies. De Man tells us his critique is directed towards understanding the cognitive status both of Derrida's language and the language of literary</page><page sequence="4">Deafness and Insight: On the Seductions of the Music /Language Analogy 23 criticism in general. The critique of de Man which follows has a similar objective: I want to question the cognitive purchase of the language of criticism and ask why it is that music becomes an opportune location for language to settle its score with itself. Though music might at first seem just one of several possible 'deconstructive' instruments de Man might call on, the unusual shifts we will notice in his essay take us to central problems in his conception of language's relation to subjectivity. More generally, I contend that further close examination of the way that language attempts to appropriate music can disclose how it thinks about its own capacity for meaningful expression. Music : substantial or hollow structure? 'The Rhetoric of Blindness' ends with Rousseau triumphant over Derrida. He emerges as his critic's instructor rather than his passive subject: 'we have Derrida deconstructing a pseudo-Rousseau by means of insights that could have been gained from the "real" Rousseau' (139-40). Restored to primacy, Rousseau attains to a different status than Derrida and the other blind critics of the collection. He is a ' non- blinded author' who 'can legitimately be called the most enlightened ' (141, my emphasis). Rousseau's uniqueness is principally established by the unorthodox relation de Man shows him setting up in Essay on the Origin of Languages between music and language. What at first appears in that work to be a wholesale adoption of a metaphysics of presence that prioritizes music turns out to be a wholly new perspective on language and meaning. Early in the essay de Man briefly points to one of Derrida's other subjects who, unlike Rousseau, consistently fits the 'classical' phonocentric model: 'The pattern in the passages from Lévi-Strauss that Derrida singles out for comment is consistent in all its details, including the valorization of music over literature and the definition of literature as a means to recoup a presence of which it is a distant and nostalgic echo' (115). If de Man is to show Rousseau shrewdly deviating from this pattern, it aids our purpose to consider briefly what the classical pattern might look like if adhered to. In Lévi-Strauss's account music holds the capacity to tangibly connect sensual experience and systematic thought. In the 'Overture' to The Raw and the Cooked he declares his intention to 'transcend the contrast between the tangible and the intelligible by operating from the outset at the sign level'.6 He considers the 'sign level' to</page><page sequence="5">24 Paragraph be the point that logic and sensual experience overlap, and believes that the most precise way of conceptualizing this is through music s natural strength as a mediator. The key for Lévi-Strauss is that although music always requires a temporal dimension in which to unfold, its rigorous internal organization leads to a perception that extends at every moment beyond itself. (So, for example, in orthodox diatonic harmony, the dominant seventh (V7) chord is heard in terms of an impending resolution to the tonic (I). Even though it does not resolve that way in every instance, as with a 'passing' cadence (V- VI), it still holds this anticipation within it.) Lévi-Strauss s understanding of the cognitive process involved in listening to music suggests to him a method for a mythology that operates at the 'sign-level': music acts upon a primitive terrain, which is the physiological time of the listener. This time is irreversible and therefore irredeemably diachronic, yet music transmutes the segment devoted to listening to it into a synchronic totality, enclosed within itself. Because of the internal organization of the musical work, the act of listening immobilizes passing time (. . .) [W]hile we are listening to it, we enter into a kind of immortality. It can now be seen how music resembles myth, since the latter too overcomes the contradiction between historical, enacted time and a permanent constant. (16)7 Music constantly keeps alive the relation between the substance of each of its moments and its overall organization. Thus its substance is always already structural, overcoming the contradiction that would set atemporal logic against time-bound sense experience. Music fulfills the exemplary role I mentioned at the outset, that of converging phenomenological and structural accounts of meaning. In the relation between the audible note and the network of relationships that condition its reception, Lévi-Strauss senses that cognitive glue which holds the sign as 'the threshold of merest presence' (QF, 1) within the system of sounds that gives the whole its meaning. It is useful to keep Lévi-Strauss s comment in mind as we return to de Man, as de Man uses the same language of 'substance' and 'structure' when making the case for Rousseau against Lévi-Strauss. 'The Rhetoric of Blindness' calls attention to a negativity in critical thought that constantly 'dissolves' the stated commitment of critics to the point that their claims become 'emptied of substance' ( BI. , 103). As a 'non-blinded author', de Man's Rousseau is entirely conscious of this negativity in his thinking and so is able to present it more directly</page><page sequence="6">Deafness and Insight: On the Seductions of the Music /Language Analogy 25 to us. Turning against what de Man considers the predominant notion of representation in eighteenth-century aesthetics as the recuperation of presence and plenitude, Rousseau comes to formulate a new notion of representation. Moving from Derrida to the Essay On the Origin of Languages de Man wastes no time in claiming that Rousseau approaches music through a 'value-system that is structural rather than substantial' (127), citing the following passage: for us, each sound is a relative entity. No sound by itself possesses absolute attributes that allow us to identify it: it is high or low, loud or soft with respect to another sound only By itself, it has none of these properties. In a harmonic system, a given sound is nothing by natural right (un son quelconque n'est rien non plus naturellement). It is neither tonic nor dominant, harmonic or fundamental. All these properties exist as relationships only and since the entire system can vary from bass to treble, each sound changes in rank and place as the system changes in degree. (128, de Mans translation and emphasis as it appears in BP) We need to pay close attention both to the scope of these comments within the overall presentation of Essay and the conclusions de Man draws from them. Rousseau first states that no sound 'by itself' possesses absolute attributes. In case we then infer that sounds attain absolute attributes in harmonic relations, he continues 'in a harmonic system , a given sound is nothing by natural right'. (A likely target in making this clarification is Rameau. Rousseau earlier dismisses Rameau s organicist claim that a 'man who has a true but unpractised ear' will be able to fill the ground bass that harmonizes a given melody because treble parts 'naturally suggests their bass'.8) De Man isolates and again recites the third full sentence from the extract without the qualifier 'in a harmonic system', asking and then answering affirmatively the question 'Are we entitled to italicize and isolate this passage as proof of the negation of the substantiality of meaning in Rousseau?' (128). This is the moment that Rousseau shows us that he is not at all 'blind' and that he understands the full consequences of a thoroughgoing structural account of music: 'There is no vacillation in Rousseau as to the semiotic and non-sensory status of the sign. Music becomes a mere structure because it is hollow at the core, because it "means" the negation of all presence' (128). If de Man is right, then he has delivered on his promise to counter Lévi-Strauss with a 'hollow' account of musical structure in Rousseau. However, if we were to refuse de Man's request and insert Rousseau's qualifier into his inference - 'Music, in a harmonic system , becomes a mere</page><page sequence="7">26 Paragraph structure' - would we alter the grounds on which de Man draws his conclusion? Is he entitled to read 'music' as 'harmonic system'? A broader reading of Essay certainly makes it difficult to read the latter as métonymie in this way In the chapter 'On Harmony' Rousseau distinguishes between two structural conceptions of music: melodic and harmonic. Each is considered according to the manner in which it relates to individual sounds in nature. He begins by telling us that the natural beauty of sounds proceeds from a purely physical pleasure we feel when we apprehend the 'interaction of various particles of air set in motion by a sonorous body'. This physical pleasure can pass into what he calls 'voluptuous pleasure' only when 'animated by melodious inflections' (OL, 321). Melodic pleasure, though, requires more than a naïve reception; it is ' une langue dont il faut avoir le dictionnaire' (a language for which one has to have the dictionary) (OL, 321). Following the logic of this metaphor, 'voluptuous pleasure' must require the kind of relational understanding that holds the elements of language together. To ensure that the reader does not presume that 'dictionary' is a coded reference to the conventions of diatonic harmony, he immediately states that harmony is 'in a much less favorable situation' as it produces 'only the beauties of convention' and is unable to appeal to untrained ears. Yet harmony's failing sounds a lot like the condition of melody's possibility: 'one has to have been long habituated to it [harmony] in order to feel and savour it' (OL, 321, translation modified). In order to keep the two concepts separate, we would have to conclude that although melody needs a pseudo-systematic knowledge, this knowledge is not acquired solely by habituation. There is, quite clearly, a looming contradiction here that could easily empty melody of any putative non-harmonic substance. The task of the rest of chapter fourteen is to retain a conception of melody that neither passes through harmony's formalizations nor dissolves it into unconnected sound events, and thus to discredit harmony's claim to capture all music within its particular system.9 Rousseau's criticism of harmony follows from his belief that the laws of consonance and dissonance which form the basis of diatonic harmony interfere with the natural perfection of proportion in the harmonic series that sounds above the fundamental (the lowest sounding frequency) of any given sound. Rousseau believes that there is a natural hierarchy that determines the relative strength of overtones, and that this hierarchy is intrinsic to the sounding body. When a second sound is added to the first to produce the consonant intervals in chordal triads (perfect fifths and fourths, and major and minor</page><page sequence="8">Deafness and Insight: On the Seductions of the Music /Language Analogy 27 sixths and thirds) this natural proportion is disrupted as the consonance redoubles some overtones, but not others. Thus 'By nature there is no other harmony than unison' (OL, 322). This effectively precludes the synchronization of two or more sounds according to harmonic relations, and, we must conclude, all the homophonic and contrapuntal forms that served as the framework for the music of Rousseau's day. If melody can exist neither as isolated sounds in nature nor as sounds organized by harmonic relations, what binds its successive notes? Rousseau's answer is unequivocal: the mind and expressions of a subject. While the systematic relations that determine harmonic principles are not, in the end, the 'sign' of anything at all, melody 'est d'avance dans l'esprit des lecteurs' (is in the readers' minds beforehand): Melody, by imitating the inflections of the voice, expresses complaints, cries of sadness or of joy, threats, and moans; all the vocal signs of passion are within its scope. It imitates the accents of languages, and the turns of phrase appropriate in each idiom to certain movements of the soul ( certains mouvemens de l'âme); it not only imitates, it speaks, and its language, inarticulate but lively, ardent, passionate, has a hundred times more energy than speech itself. (OL, 322) The sequencing of sounds that creates true melody comes from 'movements of the soul' that 'speak' the subject. The 'dictionary' that produces melody is 'in the reader's mind' and this points to the generative basis for melody, and for true musicality in general: it is the structure of interiority itself. What are we to make, however, of Rousseau s decision to extend the metaphor of the dictionary and call the subject of melody a 'reader'? What is the relation between 'l'esprit des lecteurs' and 'certains mouvemens de l'âme'? It is a detail that would not slip de Man's notice, for a 'reader' is a subject already immersed in language. De Man would probably argue that the interiority from which melody emerges has no content other than what was already put there by its linguistic (that is, harmonic) structure. Yet why, if it can only reconstitute an empty language-like knowledge, does melody set itself up as a medium for 'lively, ardent, passionate' expression, an 'inarticulate' one at that? A truly empty subject would have difficulty convincing us of such illusory interiority. The question then becomes: why does this illusory interiority seem necessary to Rousseau and why does it choose to express itself in music?10 In a recent essay on 'musical thinking', Simon Jarvis arrives at a similar moment in Hegel's writings on music. Hegel, however, approaches music's non-linguistic expressivity from the other direction.</page><page sequence="9">28 Paragraph Where Rousseau begins with the premise of a soulful content for melody, Hegel is sceptical as to whether music can express anything other than 'abstract subjectivity'. Nevertheless, he charges music with the task of 'making resound' 'the depths of (. . .) personality' of the 'inmost self'.11 Jarvis sees the contradiction involved in asking 'abstract subjectivity' to express such profound content not as an irregularity but as constitutive of Hegel's approach to cognition in its phase of 'unhappy consciousness'. Jarvis writes: Since it is hard to imagine in what sense a purely abstract subjectivity, or an entirely empty one, may possess such innernesses, depths, and chasms, it is hard to escape the implication that there is something constitutively illusory about what it is that music attempts to express. Insofar as it must express abstract subjectivity, there is nothing at all to express. Yet the illusion of pure interiority is a real illusion, a shape of feeling which is really present, and for this reason it is not the case that it has no cognitive content, but that, like 'musical thinking' in the Phenomenology , it is a movement towards which does not 'reach as far' as cognition. (65) Although Rousseau wants to assert a positive content for melody, he continually finds he is only able to gesture to it negatively. It is neither sounds in nature nor harmony. Consequently, melody veers towards a condition like the 'unhappy consciousness' of Hegel's 'musical thinking' in which the self is moved against itself: 'Series of sounds or chords will amuse me for perhaps a moment; but in order to charm me and to move me, these series have to offer me something that is neither a sound nor a chord, and that comes to move me in spite of myself (qui me vienne émouvoir malgré moi )' (OL, 324, translation modified). This is Rousseau's most precise specification for the effect of authentic melody: the series that moves me in spite of myself. A moment in which the seemingly non-intentional medium rouses the self against the self's own best expectations. Melody can do this because the illusion it creates is 'really present', and this makes melody's essential purpose the refraction in time of a sensitive being. We must remember that melody's mediation is not reducible to that being, but comes to act as a 'dictionary' and so takes on a more universal aspect. It is clear that the excerpt de Man cites on the relativity of sounds in nature and sounds in the diatonic system does not account for all the possibilities Rousseau considers. It turns out that this is another instance in which Rousseau attempts to find a substance for melody that is neither purely natural nor purely structural. It would be unfeasible to infer that Rousseau deliberately folds his negative conception of melody into his description of harmony. The</page><page sequence="10">Deafness and Insight: On the Seductions of the Music /Language Analogy 29 strong claim that de Man makes - that Rousseau intentionally empties language of presence by recourse to analogy with a 'hollow' musical structure - is not sustainable. He could retreat to the weaker claim that melody can only be an empty space because Rousseau is only able to conceive of it in negative terms. Yet this would defeat the stated purpose of the essay, as he would have no grounds to argue that Rousseau is a non-blinded author and would only be echoing Of Grammatology. Either he has made a mistake or a 'deafness' has led him to a comprehension his argument could not hear. The melody of the ' musical sign' We might expect that having claimed implicitly that Rousseau's comments on harmony are representative of music as a whole, de Man would persist with this métonymie sense of harmony-as-music for the duration of the essay. Yet in the ensuing section what 'music' signifies undergoes a remarkable transformation. We can trace this by paying close attention to de Man's use of the notional concept of the 'musical sign'. He initially derives this concept from Rousseau's 'hollow' description of harmony: lacking any substance 'the musical sign can never have any assurance of existence' (B/, 128). Despite this the musical sign has a surprisingly animate character; it cannot 'rest in the stability of its own existence'. As with Hegel's 'musical thinking', the musical sign forever moves towards but never arrives at meaning, only de Man wants to valorize this: 'On the one hand, music is condemned to exist always as a moment, as a persistently frustrated intent toward meaning; on the other hand, this very frustration prevents it from remaining within the moment' (ßL, 129). De Man insists that his anthropomorphic characterization of music as unstable and frustrated in no way indicates a presence: 'Regardless of any illusion of presence' and 'regardless of the manner in which the subject interprets its intentionality', the musical sign moves ahead ceaselessly because it is 'determined by the nature of sign as signifiant , by the nature of music as language ' (BL, 129, second emphasis mine). The usual orientation of the music/language analogy towards music is inverted here. Language substitutes for illusory musical presence, allowing de Man to exile presence from the temporal unfolding of music. Yet by fixing the language-like 'musical sign' in the precise space vacated by musical presence the pretence of a hollow structure for music starts to become tenuous. It would not be enough at this</page><page sequence="11">30 Paragraph point to simply state that de Man s 'deaf' appeal to the music/language analogy simply substitutes 'musical sign' for 'presence', and that he reinstates a phonocentric structure under a different name. To carry our critique to its conclusion we must ask de Man the same question he asks of Derrida and Rousseau: does he know he has slipped? The harder de Man works to establish a movement in the musical sign that moves without the will of a subject the more a will makes its presence felt in his description: Musical signs are unable to coincide: their dynamics are always oriented toward the future of their repetition, never toward the consonance of their simultaneity. Even the apparent harmony of the single sound, à l'unisson , has to spread itself out into a pattern of successive repetition (. . .) (BL, 129) We have seen that for Rousseau every sound naturally has a perfect relation between the fundamental and its overtones, and that the production of consonant relations in the harmonic system interferes with this proportion. For Rousseau, there can be no harmonic structure and therefore no 'musical sign', in the harmonic terms de Man initially conceives it, without the coincidences of consonance. When he says 'Musical signs are unable to coincide' he is effectively stating: 'Musical signs are unable to be musical signs'. As he paraphrases Rousseau, de Man falls into line with his melodic priorities: consonance is seen as a fallacy yet the single sound in nature is not sufficient in itself to make a sign musical. If de Man is being faithful to Rousseau, then the informing will that makes its presence known in music should resemble the subject of Rousseau's 'melody'. It is no surprise then that de Man finishes the paragraph: 'considered as a musical sign, the single sound is in fact the melody of its potential repetition' (BL, 129). The single sound qualifies as a 'musical' sign only insofar as it holds the potential for melodic elaboration. De Man completes the reorientation of the musical sign towards melody in the following paragraph. His gloss of Rousseau's comment that '[nature] inspires song, not chords; it dictates melody, not harmony', confirms his alignment with the ontological tendency in Rousseau's conception of melody: Harmony is rejected as the mistaken illusion of consonance within the necessarily dissonant structure of the moment. Melody does not partake of this mystification: it does not offer a resolution of the dissonance but its projection on a temporal diachronic axis. ( BL , 130)</page><page sequence="12">Deafness and Insight : On the Seductions of the Music /Language Analogy 31 If harmony is a mistaken illusion then so must be the notion that the sound in a harmonic system 'is nothing by natural right'. De Man has now placed both melody as substantial structure and harmony as empty structure in the domain of illusion. We must immediately qualify this, for the subsequent proposition implies that illusion is not an undifferentiated realm but has different modalities. When he says that melody does not partake of 'this mystification' he can only mean the 'mistaken' myth of 'empty' harmonic structure. The illusion that projects melody forward in time is of a different order. If we take our cue from Rousseau, as de Man does, this must suggest the presence of a subject whose presence is 'necessary' (however illusory). Furthermore, melody, now conceived as dissonance, is the 'structure' of the moment, bringing de Man into proximity with Lévi-Strauss. The objection might be raised that 'consonance' and 'dissonance' are correlative when used to refer to diatonic harmony, and that one always implies the other. I would like to suggest that de Man's insistence on an absolute break here is the result of his deafness. Against the intentional thrust of the essay, 'dissonance' comes to designate a determinate content for subjectivity. As Rousseau's account of harmony and melody underwrites these assertions, it can only be the contingent will of a refracted subject that keeps consonance at bay as it pushes melody forward in time. This wilful, subjective quality of dissonance is also present in de Man's later study of The Birth of Tragedy: since the will has been discredited as a self, the pleasure shown to be a lie, the fullness to be absence of meaning, and the play the endless tension of non-identity, a pattern of dissonance (. . .) contaminates the very source of the will, the will as source.12 If 'dissonance' is in fact the integral figure of the will (it appears to retain the absolute quality it acquires in 'The Rhetoric of Blindness') then the contamination would be reversed: the lie, absence, tension of non-identity are contaminated by the presence of the dissonant will. Melodic freedom, harmonic constraint To recapitulate my central point: after initially trying to use Rousseau's comments on harmony to purge the 'musical sign' of the illusion of meaning, de Man inverts this process by rejecting an 'illusory' harmonic model of language in favour of a melodic one. It might be argued that de Man's use of musical terms is mistakenly self- cancelling and that this error need not alter our understanding of his</page><page sequence="13">32 Paragraph broader conception of language and rhetoric. De Man is adamant, however, that he wants to follow Rousseau's 'avowed thesis', that 'the structural characteristics of language are exactly those attributed to music' (BL, 131). And he would continue to hold 'deafly' to the music/language analogy, a trump to be played when subjectivity gets too close: 'passion is not something which, like the senses, belongs in proper to an entity or to a subject but, like music, it is a system of relationships that exists only in terms of this system' (AR, 210). I do not intend to claim that de Man has lapsed into a theory of language that fixes representation to a prior 'material' reality. I've tried to show that his argument has superseded itself, and that we have at the end a notion of language that neither yokes representation and reality together into a timeless unity nor sets them 'free' of the subject in a field of chance. This is why the music /language analogy is necessary for de Man. Music is called on when an essential/accidental binary notion of language exhausts itself. De Man's deafness acknowledges negatively that a theory of language cannot proceed without incorporating language's own non-linguistic 'incipient intentions', and that the music/language analogy is one way in which it attempts to reach this essential aspect of itself. But if music is to be more than an outsourcing of problems that language already knows about itself, further investigation would need to ask what music allows language to know; or, perhaps, to do. I would like to suggest two interconnected approaches: 1) A consideration of the historical state of the materials of music that inform claims about or expressions of 'musical' language. 2) A genealogy of the ways in which theories of metaphor have relied on notions of music. This would help us to understand how the music/language analogy comes to have such a binding force at particular moments. The progression of the music/language analogy could never be entirely separated from the history of music, but would nevertheless form an alternative tradition with its own evolving set of questions. Though I cannot satisfy either of these proposals here, it is possible to indicate how we might proceed. We have seen that de Man revives Rousseau's absolute separation of harmony and melody as a separation of consonance from dissonance. Both are involved in polemics that induce them to make such forceful gestures: Rousseau against Rameau 's organicist theory of harmony, de Man against Lévi- Strauss s substantial notion of structure. Nevertheless, both are pulled</page><page sequence="14">Deafness and Insight: On the Seductions of the Music /Language Analogy 33 towards a structural account of the subject through their conception of melody (Rousseau's 'dictionary', de Man's 'dissonant structure of the moment'), one which can only emerge negatively (what I have been calling 'deafness'). Neither can make a clean break from the notion that harmony has substance. Let us juxtapose, to draw this point out, comments by Rousseau and Hegel on the relationship between melodic freedom and harmonic convention: By thus shackling melody, it [harmony] deprives it of energy and expression, it eliminates passionate accent in order to substitute the harmonic interval for it (. . .) [and] effaces and destroys multitudes of sounds or intervals that do not enter into its system; in a word, it separates song from speech so much that these two languages combat one another, contradict one another, deprive each other of every characteristic of truth and cannot be united in a pathetic subject without being absurd. (OL, 323) The movement of the melody is therefore confined to these media [bar, rhythm and harmony] of its existence and it may not seek to win an existence in them which conflicts with their inherently necessary conformity to law. But in this close link with harmony the melody does not forgo its freedom at all; it only liberates itself from the subjectivity of arbitrary caprice in fanciful developments and bizarre changes and only acquires its true independence precisely in this way. For genuine freedom does not stand opposed to necessity as alien and therefore pressing and suppressing might; on the contrary, it has this substantive might as its own indwelling essence (. . .)13 These two accounts of melody and harmony are not as opposed as they may initially seem. For Rousseau true melody harks back to an original musical language before it was divided into harmonic 'music' and conceptual 'language'. The desire for freedom in melody is thus a continual struggle against the strictures of harmonic convention that would separate music and language. Free melody becomes an arduous fight with convention. Similarly for Hegel, the free subject of melody does not emerge except through a struggle with its media. There are, on the other hand, substantial differences between what each author establishes as melodic and the kind of freedom true melody realizes. They are not just discussions of the relationship between freedom and necessity dressed up in music, but strongly echo the conditions of melodic exposition as it moves from a period of the dominance of opera to the emergence of the long symphony. For Rousseau the question of voice is utterly central: melody becomes the negation of harmonic structures that would restrict the movement of the voice to</page><page sequence="15">34 Paragraph the twelve steps of the chromatic scale. But melody was not always cast as such; Rousseau believes that we have forgotten what freedom that is not negation of harmony might be. Hegel does not see harmonic restriction as a problem in this way, for the entire notion of the work, as the symphony comes to dominate, relies on harmonic exposition: the work qua work would fail to come into existence without the enabling limits of harmony. Free melody is the immanent surpassing of the harmonic framework. When de Man 'deafly' reinstates Rousseau's melodic subject he encounters difficulties he could not anticipate. I find that his failure to break decisively with structuralism resonates strongly with the ambiguities inherent in the tensions between post-Webernian serialism (most notably Boulez) and John Cages aleatorie music in the 1950s and 60s. It has often been observed that serialism, in which all compositional parameters are decided by the composer in advance, can produce strikingly similar results to the 'chance' music, in which the composer attempts to withdraw himself altogether from decision- making in the compositional process. It is a fortuitous moment for de Man to call on the music /language analogy in trying to reconceptualize the subject in literary criticism. The bonds that hold the musical work together have reached such extremities that a totally deliberated musical structure can mirror one which tries to rid itself of deliberation. Neither rationalism nor irrationalism can successfully claim freedom from domination. Of course it would be absurd to claim that these links between the state of musical composition in particular historical moments and the progression of the theory of language are causal. We have affirmed, however, that the possibilities here extend beyond causality and that these extensions require analogy. It is also impossible to assert that the music/language analogy invariably holds the same potential for thinking about language and cognition. It has shown itself, in de Man's case, to be rich material for gaining perspective on language's self- perception, and it is unlikely that this depth is confined to this single moment of deafness.

When Adorno speaks here of 'true musicality' he is specifying what he takes to be musics cognitive aspect, something which is not straightforwardly intentional, but which cannot be called non-intentional either. Swinburne and Rilke, who compare unfavorably with Kafka, stand accused of indulging music s non-conceptual expressiveness as though by simply imitating music they could gain immediate access to its 'theological dimension'. Kafka, on the other hand, 'harnesses' music's 'incipient intentions' at the structural level. When his parables break off in mid-phrase it is because they have moved towards the 'truly musical' dimension in which subjective and objective characteristics are indistinguishable. 2 I am thinking particularly of the neo-positivist atmosphere of post-war Anglo-American historical musicology and, in a different way, music analysis and theory of that period. See Joseph Kerman, Musicology (London: Fontana, 1985), 31-112. 3 Paul de Man, Blindness and Insight (henceforth BI) (London: Methuen, 1983), xxiii- xxiv. 4 Rodolphe Gasché carefully elucidates this critical practice.

Scott (Hanover: University Press of New England, 1998), 322. 9 In the previous chapter, 'On Melody', Rousseau ridicules those who consider 'harmony alone the source of the great effects of music' (321). 10 It might be imagined at this point that I am heading in the direction of Rei Terada's reading of de Man in Feeling in Theory (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2001), or that her reading already anticipates and refutes mine. Terada takes to its logical conclusion an insight fashioned by Neil Hertz in his well-known essay 'Lurid Figures' (in The Ends of Rhetoric: History ; Theory, Practice (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990), 100-24). Hertz points out that when de Man describes the absence or death of a</page><page sequence="17">36 Paragraph subject in his criticism, 'lurid figures' of death and dismemberment, that can't help but provoke pathos, bloom on the surface of his writing. Hertz calls it 'a pathos of uncertain agency' (121). In her reading of de Man, Terada argues that all pathos must be inherently nonsubjective precisely because 'emotion is our recognition of the subject's "death" ' (151). Terada hopes to continue postructuralism s assault on the 'illusion of subjectivity' even as the intellectual discourse turns to consider emotions and affective experience. She thus retains and celebrates the category of emotion as 'the sign of the absence of that illusion' (157). Terada believes that if we could only 'destroy' (157) the idea of subjectivity, then we would have access to true, demystified emotions. (Indeed the book's concluding phrase - 'if I thought I saw one [a human subject] coming, I too would run away' (157) - seems to openly solicit Marx's parody of the Young Hegelians.) In this essay I am arguing, albeit in an oblique manner, that the production of illusions that might alienate us from our emotions is not to be righted by simply ridding ourselves of illusions (such as the illusion of musical 'presence'). 1 1 Simon Jarvis, 'Musical Thinking: Hegel and the Phenomenology of Prosody', in The Idea of the Literary , edited by Nicholas Harrison, Paragraph 28:2 (2005), 57-71 (65). 12 Paul de Man, Allegories of Reading (henceforth AR) (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1979), 99. 13 HegeVs Aesthetics: Lectures on Fine Art , translated by T.M.
