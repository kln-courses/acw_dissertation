<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAPHNE (WITHOUT APOLLO) RECONSIDERED: SOME DISREGARDED IMAGES OF SEXUAL PURSUIT IN ITALIAN RENAISSANCE AND BAROQUE ART Yael Even Recent publications on representations of rape in early modern Europe attest to the growing interest in examining the subject of sexual violence in the art of the period. They shed light on the variety of these images as well as on the reasons for, and implications of, their popularity. Thus, Margaret Carroll's "The Erotics of Absolutism: Rubens and the Mystification of Sexual Violence" examines Flemish (and some Italian) variations on the theme from the late Renaissance and Baroque as governmental tools that promote the submission of women.1 Diane Wolfthal's "'A Hue and a Cry': Medieval Rape Imagery and Its Transformation" explores similar medieval and early-Renaissance depictions in the Netherlands and in Germany as "part of a public campaign to blame women."2 Like Linda Hults's "Durer's Lucretia: Speaking the Silence of Women," each article introduces different artworks from slightly different times, but both center on North European art.3 What is missing is a similar kind of research that, like Cristelle Baskins's "Corporeal Authority in the Speaking Picture: The Representation of Lucretia in Tuscan Domestic Painting,"4 focuses on the even wider range of portrayals of sexual pursuit in Italian culture.5 Indeed, more art historical studies are needed that will complement those of historians, scholars of literature, and theorists, studies such as Elizabeth Cohen's "No Longer Virgins: Self-Presentation by Young Women in Late Renaissance Rome" and Ann Rosalind Jones's "New Songs for the Swallow: Ovid's Philomela in Tullia d'Aragona and Gaspara Stampa."6 My article is a re-evaluation of the iconography of Apollo's attempted vio lation and successful appropriation of Daphne in early modern Florence and Rome.7 Like the equally popular images of mythological rapes in this art, most of the interpretations of this subject are so idealized that they appear as variations on the theme of love. As the versions of Antonio del Pollaiuolo (ca. 1475; Fig. 1) and Carlo Cignani (ca. 1678; Fig. 2) demonstrate, they resemble images of Venus and Studies in Iconography 18 —1997 143</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1.

Adonis and Amor and Psyche, which represent consensual rather than forced sex.8 Moreover, most depictions of Apollo's pursuit of Daphne are viewed from Apollo's, not Daphne's, perspective. Unlike the depictions of the amorous conquests of Jupiter and Pluto, such as the Rape of Europa and the Abduction of Persephone, where the pursued female protagonist is at least given center stage and top billing, the representations of Apollo's pursuit deny Daphne this dubious honor.9 Although her figure often occupies the very middle of the composition, her Studies in Iconography 18 — 1997 145</page><page sequence="4">aversion to and terror of Apollo are misrepresented and, sometimes, undermined. More important, her own unexpected, unwarranted, and unenviable tragedy is rarely, if ever, acknowledged. That, according to literary sources, Daphne miraculously succeeded in pre serving her chastity and integrity distinguishes her from Europa and Persephone (as well as from many other female protagonists who were tricked and seduced by Olympian gods).10 That she was able to resist Apollo's overwhelming desire by being metamorphosed into a laurel tree (with her father's assistance) renders her not only more exceptional but also much more fascinating (especially for painters and sculptors). Yet many visual interpretations of Daphne's actual transformation from human to arboreal form seem to underscore Apollo's reactions to it without so much as an imitation of hers. Even though they represent Daphne as she is beginning to change in order to escape the arms of Apollo, who has embraced her against her will, these visual representations frequently characterize her as indifferent, placid, and content (Fig. 3). At times, they seem to suggest mislead ingly that she actually flowers to his touch instead of shying away from it in horror. To be sure, very seldom, if ever, in Italian Renaissance art is Daphne allowed to convey fully the physical and emotional pain that she may have suffered as a result of the metamorphosis itself. Nor is the sorrow of being forever implanted in one place, the humiliation of being appropriated as the tree of her divine but unwanted suitor, and the anguish of leaving behind everybody and everything dear to her either validated or even suggested. Objectified and devalued like so many women in early modern European painting and sculpture, Daphne's transformation into a laurel tree is perceived almost exclusively as Apollo's misfortune. Petrarch's frequent poetic references to Apollo's unfulfilled love of Daphne, written more than a hundred years before Pollaiuolo's painting, demonstrate a similar tendency." Sonnet 43, for example, centers exclusively on Apollo's re peated but futile attempts to find Daphne. The god's relentless quest as well as his frustration and despair are the subjects of ten of the sonnet's fourteen lines: Nine times with avid glances to and fro Latona's son had peered from Heaven's height In search of her whose charms did once excite His amourous heart, whose grace now others know. But probing near and far and high and low He found her not; embittered by his plight As one half-maddened by uneasy fright At loss of a dear thing, he fled ... And while he stood withdrawn, in tears and sighs, The air retained its dour uncertainty.12 146 Daphne (without Apollo) Reconsidered</page><page sequence="5">Figure 3. Daphne. Antonio del Pollaiuolo, Apollo and Daphne, detail; London, National Gallery. (Photo: The National Gallery.) The remaining four lines present the poet's own emotions. Daphne, who not only inspires both Apollo and Petrarch but also is the raison d'être of the sonnet, does not seem to play any role whatsoever. Unlike Apollo, who is identified as "Latona's son," she is referred to not only as "her," but also as amata cosa, "a dear thing" (italics mine).13 Described as both graceful and exciting, she has, nonetheless, been inadvertently objectified and all but mercilessly nullified. Nowhere is the complete disregard of Daphne's own fate more apparent than in images where her story forms part of pictorial cycles dedicated to Apollo. Nicola da Urbino's majolica painting of circa 1525, commissioned by Isabella d'Este, is a case in point (Fig. 4).14 Depicting three episodes—Apollo's encounter with Cupid (on top), his victory over Python (on the left), and his pursuit of Daphne (on the right), it revolves around the Olympian god, whose figure is the only one to appear, not once but three times. Daphne, at the bottom and right edge of the composition, appears to be running away from the ardent god, as well as out of the circular space Studies in Iconography 18 — 1997 147</page><page sequence="6">Figure 4. Nicola da Urbino, Maiolica Bowl; London, The British Museum. (Photo: The British Museum.) of the painting itself. As if only partially important, her right foot—like Python's tail on the left—has already disappeared behind the frame. Moreover, her upper body, which has metamorphosed into three tall branches that correspond to the form of the two trees on the far left, seems to dissolve into the background and thus, marginal components of the entire scene. Her father, a tertiary character (at the bottom), is granted more space and greater prominence than she is. Examined independently, Nicola da Urbino's portrayal of Apollo's pursuit of Daphne is as misleading as Antonio del Pollaiuolo's. Just as the latter looks like a choreographed ballet of an idyllic amorous encounter rather than a random, 148 Daphne (without Apollo) Reconsidered</page><page sequence="7">attempted rape, the former is displayed more as a playful running contest than a violent chase. Indeed, Nicola da Urbino's image of Daphne, with her extraordi narily muscular thighs and upper arms, is that of a trained athlete. Without the branches that sprout out of her head and hands, her identity could easily be mistaken for that of the much stronger Atalanta. The presentation of Daphne's story as only one of many equally important or more important episodes in Apollo's myth is evident not only in Nicola da Urbino's painting. Peter Paul Rubens's variation on the theme (ca. 1636; Fig. 5), featured side by side with the artist's variations on the stories of Apollo's victory over Python and on Apollo's contest with Pan, is one of the better-known examples.15 The juxtaposition of this image with yet a fourth one—that of Pan's pursuit of Syrinx (ca. 1636; Fig. 6)—is even more revealing.16 It serves to reinforce the viewer's awareness of the analogies between Apollo's and Pan's adventures, and of those between Daphne, who turned into a tree, and the similarly anguished Syrinx, who changed into reeds.17 Consequently, the comparison of the two serves to rob the already objectified and devalued Daphne of any vestiges of individuality and singularity. Indeed, like many figures of nameless female nudes in Western art, she becomes what can be termed "generic." The idea that in metamorphosing into a tree, Daphne actually scorned rather than saved herself from Apollo is, in fact, promoted when the latter's pursuit of the former is juxtaposed with Pan's pursuit of Syrinx. In both accounts the pursued female protagonists—Daphne and Syrinx—succeeded in evading their male suitors—Apollo and Pan. Likewise, they changed into vegetal forms which were eventually appropriated by the two unsuccessful lovers. Whereas the disconsolate Apollo decided to make the laurel tree his—by creating victory wreathes out of the leaves of the metamorphosed Daphne—the outraged Pan vindicated himself by making a pipe out of the reeds into which Syrinx had transformed. In so acting, the two rejected male protagonists appear to have been able to achieve some measure of satisfaction and to maintain some aspect of their all-but-shattered male egos. The association between Daphne and Syrinx, commented on in fourteenth century Italian literature, can be noted in Italian painting as early as the fifteenth century. According to Stanley Meltzoff, Giovanni Boccaccio mentions the asso ciation in books 14 and 15 of Genealogia deorum gentilium (1362). Meltzoff is also the first to point out that Sandro Botticelli may have been alluding to such a relationship in the Calumny of Apelles (1495—96; Uffizi, Florence).18 Interestingly, where Boccaccio names Daphne and Syrinx "the tutelary nymphs of poetry," Botticelli presents both of them—almost side by side—in the left portion of the composition among the lower plinths (II, VII).19 Studies in Iconography 18 —1997 149</page><page sequence="8">Figure 5. Peter Paul Rubens, Apollo and Daphne; Bayonne, Musee Bonnat. (Photo: Musee Bonnat.) Figure 5. Peter Paul Rubens, Apollo and Daphne; Bayonne, Musée Bonnat. (Photo: Musée Bonnat.) Rubens, who stresses the visual analogies between Daphne's and Syrinx's fates even as he dramatizes them, presents both figures in mid-flight as well as in mid-metamorphosis. Furthermore, he features the two almost completely naked, thus attracting the viewer's attention or, rather, gaze to their all-but-nude female bodies. As Amy Richlin would undoubtedly agree,20 Ruben's sexualization of Daphne follows that of Ovid: The wind laid bare her body, and the breezes as she met them fluttered her clothing as 150 Daphne (without Apollo) Reconsidered</page><page sequence="9">Figure 6. Peter Paul Rubens, Pan and Syrinx; Bayonne, Musee Bonnat. (Photo: Musee Bonnat.) Figure 6. Peter Paul Rubens, Pan and Syrinx; Bayonne, Musée Bonnat. (Photo: Musée Bonnat.) it came against them, and the light breeze made her locks go out behind her, and her beauty [forma] was increased by her flight.21 The objectification and erotization of Daphne is typical of an iconographie tradition that continues to glamorize the sexual pursuits of its heroes, who are primarily male. Although she seemingly plays the role of Apollo's counterpart, her story and its still ignored implications are completely overshadowed by his. Even when Apollo is chided rather than pitied for his actions, their impact on Daphne are never mentioned. Thus, the distich that pope Urban VIII composed for Gianlorenzo Bernini's Apollo and Daphne (1622—25; Rome, Borghese Gallery) addresses itself Studies in Iconography 18 — 1997 151</page><page sequence="10">only to the male aggressor. It reads: "Whoever, loving, pursued the joys of fleeting forms fills his hands with sprays of leaves and seizes bitter fruits."22 Daphne's existence as well as her fate do not seem to be of any consequence. Indeed, she is referred to solely as one of many "fleeting forms." The only opportunity that Daphne has to become both genuinely seen and heard seems to be a representa tion that warrants her presence without Apollo's.23 Andrea Mantegna's Pallas Expelling the Vices from the Garden of Virtue (1497—1500), an invenzione or alle gory, where Daphne appears prominently on the left (Fig. 7), is such a painting.24 It was commissioned by Isabella d'Este as the companion painting of Mantegna's Parnassus,25 The earlier Parnassus does, in fact, display Apollo playing his lyre, on the left as well, but it does not include any reference to his love or appropriation of Daphne.26 As the title of Pallas Expelling the Vices indicates, the focus of the entire composition is Athena, not Daphne, who appears behind her, in front of the trimmed trees and bushes that frame the istoria, or action. Nonetheless, rather than become as decorative and subsidiary as the rest of the foliage, she succeeds in commanding extraordinary attention.27 Undeniably, standing in the least unpopulated section of the composi tion, unlike the Parnassus Apollo, who is seated, Daphne dominates the space immediately around her. Looming taller than any other figure, including that of the powerful goddess herself, she literally comes into existence as if on her own terms probably for the very first time. The scroll that encircles her arboreal guise sets her even further apart. Written in Latin, Greek, and (an imitation of) Hebrew—the only three sacred languages Figure 7. Daphne.

(Photo: Réunion des Musées Nationaux, Agence Photo graphique.)</page><page sequence="11">Daphne's unprecedented prominence in Mantegna's Pallas Expelling the Vices is due also to the formal components of the composition, which differs from that of its pendant, Parnassus. The fact that Athena, on the left (Fig. 8), is shown chasing the Vices—who are fleeing to the right—encourages one to examine the dramatic action in this very direction. Thus, following the istoria as it unfolds, one begins by looking at the left, where the uncommon form of the metamorphosed Daphne serves both as a stabilizing anchor and as a starting point for the entire scene. The contrast between the latter's enforced immoveability and Athena's vehement motions is so striking that it cannot be overlooked. So is the juxtaposition between the calm branches, twigs, and leaves into which Daphne's limbs have been transformed and Athena's dramatically billowing hair and garments. The association between the two calls attention to their figures, whose facial profiles and expressions seem to echo one another. It is unlikely that Mantegna—who was obligated to follow the instructions of both Isabella d'Este and, possibly, Paride da Ceresara, her advisor—set out to monumentalize and dramatize the image of Daphne at the expense of all the other figures in Pallas Expelling the Vices.29 Nor is it conceivable that he was determined to reconstruct it primarily for the purpose of lending her hitherto untold story more recognition.30 What is plausible, however, is the assumption that in trying to outshine his competitors and impress his benefactor, Mantegna strove to translate the latter's ideas into an unprecedented design.31 That he actually reinvented the image of Daphne would, indeed, have been consistent with Isabella's explicit insistence "to have only what was novel" and what "has [not] been done by others before."32 Mantegna's unprecedented image of Daphne would also have been congruent with Isabella's primary intent to adorn the studiolo with representations of traditionally feminine virtues, including chastity. To be sure, Mantegna's vision of the metamorphosed Daphne is that of a chaste maiden who escaped rape at great pains. As H. W. Janson states, Daphne, who preferred to withdraw into an arboreal form rather than suffer at the hands of Apollo, actually became the model for Virtus who tried to evade Fortuna's abuse.33 Unidealized and unappealing in Pallas Expelling the Vices, her body bears witness to the dire consequences of her struggle to maintain her virtue. Indeed, her wooden legs and torso, as well as her scarecrow-like wooden arms, are outstretched as if on a rack (or a cross). In addition, her still noticeable female features appear to pulsate beneath the bark that encircles and imprisons her; yet a sprig of laurel springs out of her right nipple. Similarly, her still human face inclines forward, whereas her chest remains firmly in place. That is probably why her open mouth seems frozen in an eternal scream and her brow remains deeply furrowed. Studies in Iconography 18 — 1997 153</page><page sequence="12">V* \ Figure 8. Athena.

(Photo: Réunion des Musées Nationaux, Agence Photographique.) 154 Daphne (without Apollo) Reconsidered</page><page sequence="13">The impact of the semi-human semi-arboreal image of Daphne is unpre cedented as well. Neither flowering as an idealized maiden nor as a beautified young laurel tree, she is not as pleasurable to look at as her counterparts by Mantegna's contemporaries, Pollaiuolo (Figs. 1, 3) and Botticelli. On the contrary, made to comport herself like a veritable quadriplegic, her persona evokes feelings of unease, pity, and perhaps even outrage (at Apollo). Indeed, no longer light footed and graceful, she becomes the very opposite of Botticelli's Chloris (Fig. 9), who, having been pursued by Zephyrus, metamorphosed into an engagingly graceful Flora.34 As Lillian Zirpolo suggests, Chloris, who had not been able to free herself from her pursuer's arms, was violated by him and then given the domain of flowers as a reward.35 On the other hand, Daphne, who had the chance to save herself from Apollo's clutches (only thanks to her father's assistance), metamorposed into a laurel tree but was then punished by being trapped in it. It is important to note that Mantegna's unidealized but individualized Daphne forms part of an allegorical representation that was to be exhibited in Isabella d'Este's studiolo, or private retreat.36 Its main subject is Athena, who as goddess of war and wisdom became, in Classical culture, the most powerful of female protagonists.37 On the other hand, Botticelli's Chloris (and her alter ego, Flora) appears in a different but equally complex pictorial allegory that was commis sioned, according to Zirpolo, by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici. Adorning the room that ajoined Lorenzo and Semiramide d'Appiani's nuptial chamber, its central subject is Venus, goddess of beauty and love.38 The one picture by Mantegna displays what may be considered a feminist scene, since the main agents are the strong and independent maidens Athena and Daphne. The other work by Botticelli features a masculinist vision that includes the figure of Chloris, who, unlike Daphne, was forced to submit to Zephyrus's wishes. Although the recasting of Daphne as Athena's consort in Pallas Chasing the Vices is novel, it does not seem to reflect any criticism on the part of Isabella d'Este toward the notion of "heroic rape" itself. Nor does the indirect reference to Daphne's tragic fate (instead of Apollo's) suggest that the Marchesa attempted to reconstruct (or deconstruct) the entire violent myth. Daphne's singular guise and its hitherto overlooked implications may have been justified by the singular context of the allegory itself. It was warranted both by Isabella's wish to outdo other collectors and by Mantegna's intent to outdo other artists. All the same, one must not forget that the same Isabella who commissioned Pallas Expelling the Vices from Mantegna also commissioned Nicola da Urbino to paint Apollo's pursuit of Daphne in a more traditional way in a majolica painting (Fig. 4).

Sandro Botticelli, Primavera, detail; Florence, Uffizi. (Photo: Alinari/Art Resource.) Mantegna's image of Daphne in Pallas Chasing the Vices from the Garden of Virtue, the artist's "most idiosyncratic masterpiece," requires more re-evalua tion.39 Yet, one thing is certain: this visual image does not conform to the norm and thus allows us to reassess other, more common images of Daphne that visualize the 156 Daphne (without Apollo) Reconsidered</page><page sequence="15">prevalent tendency to idealize and heroize myths of sexual violence. Without a doubt, most representations of rapes, attempted rapes, and sexual pursuits are viewed not from the perspective of their female but from that of their male protagonist; they appear as his, not her, dramatic tale. Indeed, Apollo's aborted attempt to violate Daphne is usually perceived as a male tragedy, the echoes of which continue to resound in Renaissance poems. Likewise, Apollo's success in appropriating the laurel tree into which Daphne has metamorphosed continues to be celebrated as a male triumph in many Renaissance and Baroque paintings.
