Energy transfer in gases David Field The object of this article is to take the reader through the most basic principles of molecular physics to the frontiers of our understanding of energy transferring collisions. Astrophysical and laser applications are considered where appropriate. Discussion is largely limited to diatomic and triatomic molecules colliding in the gas phase. An outline is given of the disposition of internal energy in such molecules in terms of rotational , vibrational and electronic energy levels. The emphasis throughout is on the development of an understanding of energy transfer in terms of the dynamics of molecular encounters. To this end the concept of the potential energy surface for interacting molecules is developed. In subsequent sections a number of representative systems and experiments are chosen to illustrate the principles of investigation of diverse energy transfer processes. A qualitative appraisal of experimental results relates energy transfer efficiencies to general features of interaction energy surfaces for the examples considered. This article is by no means a detailed account of current research in energy transfer : in the following pages it has rather been my aim to give the reader an overview of current modes of thought in this fascinating topic. Introduction Processes of energy transfer are of very general importance in physics and chemistry. Molecular collisions involving the transfer of energy lie at the heart of many bulk properties of gases. These include diffusion, thermal conductivity, or relaxation times in shock waves and nozzle expansions. Energy transfer is also of fundamental importance in chemical reactions. For example, the rate of thermal decomposition of gaseous molecules at low pressure is determined by the rate of energy transfer between decomposing molecules and other molecules in the gas mixture. Further relevance is to be found in the modelling, improving and inventing of laser systems. Such work requires the calculation of the populations of molecular and atomic energy levels and these will be strongly influenced by the rates at which collisions knock molecules in and out of specific energy states.

More than fifty different molecular species have now been identified from astronomical (largely radio-) observations of interstellar gas clouds. These molecules occupy specific energy levels which can be identified from the wavelengths of their emissions. If rates were known for collisional processes by which molecules entered and departed from levels from which they are seen to emit, then it would be possible to calculate the temperatures and pressures under which the molecules are found. This is an exciting prospect, for molecular interstellar clouds are thought to be the precursors of stars. From data on energy transfer we can hope therefore to gain insight into one of the central problems of astrophysics, the physical conditions under which stars form. After this brief introduction I will move on directly to discuss some of the basic physical concepts upon which an understanding of energy transfer rests. 1 . Some physics of molecules and molecular interactions The range of molecular translational energies 1 shall discuss runs from zero to (say) 100,000 cm"1,* the range of so-called chemical energies. Exchange of energy can occur when molecules collide: note that in the processes I shall consider, chemical reactions are not included, though they may of course be the outcome of a collision between two molecules.t Since the subject of energy transfer is a very extensive one I have found it best to limit the scope of this article to those topics in which an understanding is forthcoming at a basic level, that is, at the level of the molecular dynamics of collisions. For this reason I shall be dealing throughout with collisions between molecules in the gas phase. In gases at low pressure, encounters between pairs of molecules are, to a very good approximation, unaffected by the presence of other gas molecules. It is therefore possible to think of individual collisional events between two molecules, ignoring the presence of other molecules. This great reduction in conceptual complexity is not possible in liquids or solids, in which. the presence of neighbouring molecules may not be ignored due to their very much greater average proximity. Even in the gas phase, molecular collisions which are best understood are those between molecules containing very few atoms. Most of the molecules I shall consider will contain only two, three or four atoms, for example OH, NH2, or ammonia, NH3. The reader may not be familiar with molecules such as NH2 or OH. The latter is very important in flame chemistry, and is also one of the most important species in atmospheric chemistry, as well as being of great signifi- cance in astrophysics through its maser action. NH2 is found in planetary atmospheres and has also been observed in comet-tails. These molecules and many others like them, resemble Hinfinished' molecules (OH, water; NH2, ammonia) and * See appendix for units and conversions between units. t Throughout this article 'molecule' may generally be taken to include atoms. 310</page><page sequence="3">David Field are highly reactive, having unpaired electrons searching as it were for partners. Such molecules are termed radicals and a significant part of this article concerns the way in which radicals exchange energy when they collide with atoms or other small molecules such as H2, N2 or H20. 1.1. Molecular energy and molecular energy levels In writing of energy transfer I have up to this point used the term energy in a very loose manner. If molecular energy is to be transferred in a collision, in what way does this energy make its presence felt? The form it takes will strongly influence the mechanisms by which it can be removed or gained in a collision. Molecular energy, both potential and kinetic, is composed of the energy of the electrons and of the nuclei, and it is a most useful concept to separate the motions of these components. The energy of the electrons is then said to determine the electronic energy state of the molecule. In a particular electronic energy state, the molecule can vibrate and rotate, these motions giving rise to the energy of the nuclei. Vibration and rotation may themselves be thought of as independent motions, having independently associated vibrational and rotational energies. Electronic energies and energies of vibration and rotation are internal energies, since they arise from motions described by a frame of reference fixed upon the molecule. Furthermore electronic, vibrational and rotational energies are quantized according to the molecular quantum theory. It follows from quantum theory that molecules may possess only certain discrete amounts- quanta- of electronic, vibrational or rotational energy. Molecular collisions may then cause a molecule to lose or gain a discrete quantum of electronic, vibrational or rotational energy. Of course molecules may also move about in space and this gives rise to translational energy representing motion of the molecule as a whole. In the absence of an external magnetic or electric field, translational energy is not quantized. Note that an atom can have only electronic or translational energies, since it possesses no bonds to vibrate or axis about which to rotate. I have now specified four separate energies for a molecule: electronic, vibrational, rotational and translational , EC, V, R and T, respectively. When two molecules collide and exchange energy, there are therefore a whole variety of types of energy exchange that can occur separately or simultaneously. An important factor in determining the likelihood of a particular process is the amount of energy that has to be transferred for that process to occur. This leads us to ask: what are the orders of magnitude of a change in E fi, V, R (and T) energies ; that is, how much energy is there in a quantum of Efi, V or R? A change in electronic energy, a quantum of E fi, is generally of the order of 15,000-50,000 cm-1. Vibrational quanta lie an order of magnitude lower. Vibrational motions can be separated into those which stretch bonds in the molecule and those which bend them. The former are more difficult types of motion to alter, and a quantum of stretch energy is 1000-3000 cm"1. A bending energy quantum is generally a few hundred cm"1. Rotational energy 311</page><page sequence="4">Energy transfer in gases quanta are even smaller, ranging from much less than 1 cm-1 to tens of cm-1. There is clearly a hierarchy of quanta: EC &gt; V &gt; R. From this hierarchy it follows that each electronic energy can be represented as having a set of vibrational energy levels associated with it, and each vibrational level, a set of rotational levels. This is shown schematically in Fig. 1. Translational energy changes, not being quantized, can have any value from zero up. For example in Eß-T, the change in translational energy of the atom (say) causing removal of electronic energy may be tens of thousands of cm"1, whereas in R-T the change in T may be only a few cm-1. Fjg. 1. A schematic diagram showing levels of the ground (X) and first excited (A) electronic states of a molecule. Only the first few vibrational levels, and the first few rotational levels associated with v = 0, are drawn in each case. The verti- cal energy scale for the rotational levels is 5-10 times expanded over the vibrational scale, for the sake of clarity. 312</page><page sequence="5">David Field In order to go a little further in describing how the internal energy of a molecule is organized, it is necessary to introduce the idea of quantum numbers. Since internal energies can be discussed separately we can frame the question: how much vibrational energy is there in a particular molecule, or how much rotational energy? Mention has already been made of the discrete nature of internal molecular energy, and the discrete energy levels of Eß, V and R, can be labelled by integers called quantum numbers. Consider vibration: if the vibrational energy is proportional to some whole number 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . times a constant characteristic of a particular molecule then the vibrational energy will progress in a series of rungs, the lowest of which, the ground vibrational state, is characterized by the vibrational quantum number, i/ = 0, the next by v = 1 , and so on. Thus HCl (v = 1) represents a popu- lation of molecules of HCl containing vibrational energy corresponding to the first vibrationally excited state of HCl, 2990cm"1 above the ground state, »/=0. The energy separating v= 0 and v = 1 is called a quantum of vibrational energy. The proportionality of the vibrational energy to v is true only for the first few vibrational levels of a molecule. As v increases the separation between successive vibrational levels decreases and v therefore does not increase indefinitely. If there is sufficient vibrational energy in a molecule it will of course be able to decompose: hence the relevance of vibrational energy transfer in the mechanism of chemical decomposition. Collisions may cause vibrational energy to be channelled into a molecule and this vibrational energy may be sufficient for decomposition to occur. Turning to molecular rotation, the corresponding energy levels are described by a quantum number J . As J increases so does the corresponding rotational energy; in contrast to vibration the separation between successive rotational levels increases as J increases. This behaviour may be seen in Fig. 1 . It is more difficult concisely to describe electronic energy levels. Because of the many and complex interactions of electrons with each other and between electrons and nuclei, a single quantum number or set of quantum numbers is not sufficient. A system has been developed in which types of electronic state are specified, but one cannot say a priori what their relative-energies will be- apart from a few general notions which need not concern usjiere. There is an electronic ground level repre- sented by X, a first excited level, A, a second excited level, B, and so on. The^type of electronic state assigned to a molecule in its various energy levels, X, A, B, . . . is dictated by its outermost electrons. Most molecules have electrons paired and are said to belong to singlet states. Radicals often have one unpaired electron and belong to doublet states. Translational energy may be described straightforwardly in terms of Newtonian mechanics. Since we are generally dealing with bulk gas samples, translational energy is usually described using the thermodynamic expression 3/2 kT per mol- ecule, where T = absolute temperature and k = Boltzmann's constant. One can then think of an average Newtonian molecular speed, usually around a few hundred metres/s, associated with a particular gas temperature. At T = 300 K, room tem- 313</page><page sequence="6">Energy transfer in gases perature on a hot summer day, 3/2 kT = 313 cm"1, a useful figure for comparison with quanta of internal molecular energy. Note that this figure represents an average translational energy. Some molecules will possess more than this average, some less, the distribution of molecular translational energies being governed by the famous 'Boltzmann Distribution'. An important point is that in an excitation process only a fraction of molecules will have sufficient translational energy to perform the excitation. For example in a collision between helium atoms and HCIO = 0), He + HCl (V = 0) -&gt; He 4- HCl (y =1) (1) the relative translational energy of the atom and molecule must be at least 2990cm"1, and at 300 K only a fraction 0.00007 have this energy, making the process a very unusual one. 1 .2. Molecular interactions and potential energy surfaces I have dealt so far with the description of isolated molecules and have said something of the types of internal molecular energy and of their orders of magni- tude. Since energy exchange occurs through collisions we also want to know how molecular energies are influenced by the presence of collision partners. In other words, in process (1), for example, we want to know how the internal energy of HCl is transiently affected by the presence of the helium atom. We can take He colliding with HCl as a paradigm. If I may conjure up a picture of a molecule, think of HCl as two tiny nuclei embedded in a quite extensive, diffuse cloud of electrons. The helium atom, a nucleus in spherical cloud of electrons, approaches and distorts both its own cloud and that of the HCl molecule. The atom-molecule trajectory will be determined by the repulsions-nuclear-nuclear, electron-electron- and attractions-electron-nuclear -inherent in the system He-HCl. The total energy, nuclear and electronic, kinetic and potential, is of course conserved, but the relative amounts of these different components of energy change as He approaches HCl. How can we usefully describe an encounter such as this? The extent to which a collision has proceeded can be characterized by a vector joining the centres of mass of the colliding particles. Since the nuclei are around 2000 or more times more massive than the electron clouds surrounding them, they move much more slowly than the electron clouds can distort and thus, as the nuclei take up new relative positions, so the electron clouds follow suit, distorting accordingly. The relative positions of the nuclei therefore dictate the electronic energy. Using this physical picture, quantum mechanics can show that an inter- action may be regarded as a motion of the nuclei under the influence of forces derived from the sum of all energy contributions save that of the nuclear motion itself. This can be represented abstractly as motion on a 'potential energy surface', something of a misnomer when we recall that it includes not only nuclear and electronic potential energy but also electronic kinetic energy. The idea of the nuclei in a system moving as mass points on a potential energy surface in an abstract space of an appropriate number of dimensions is central to 314</page><page sequence="7">David Field Fig. 2. Two-dimensional cuts through the three major types of potential energy surface (a) repulsive, (b) attractive, (c) attractive with an energy barrier. R is the separation between the centres of mass of the colliding molecules and is measured in Ängstrom units. the present-day understanding of molecular encounters of all kinds. The essential point is that the outcome of molecular collisions depends profoundly on the form of the potential energy surface. It is therefore worthwhile to discuss this form briefly here. Figs. 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) represent cuts through the three major types of potential energy surface. When two molecules are far apart at (say) 5-10 Â they will always attract one another weakly, to the extent of no more than a few tens of cm_1-too little to be seen in Fig. 2. As they approach more closely the potential energy may rise monotonically, Fig. 2(a), to form a repulsive surface, or it may drop to form a well, Fig. 2(b), or it may have a bump and a well in it, an attractive surface with an energy barrier, Fig. 2(c). Fig. 2(a) represents the typical form of an interaction between two molecules or atoms chemically inert to one another, for example, He + HCl; Fig. 2(b) represents an interaction between two radicals, for example H + OH, where the molecule H20 will form transiently at the bottom of the energy well, and chemical reaction could occur; Fig. 2(c) represents the potential surface between two partners which are potentially chemically reactive to one another with neither or one only a radical. This picture of molecular interaction, of nuclei moving on a potential energy surface, enables one to imagine the physics of a collision quite graphically. For example, when He and HCl encounter one another their mutual repulsion causes them to travel on a trajectory of the type shown in Fig. 3(a). ïf H and OH meet, the atom and molecule spend orders of magnitude longer time together, performing a much more complicated trajectory in sampling the potential energy surface that their interaction generates: Fig. 3(b). The dotted region of Fig. 3(b) represents the part of the trajectory taking place in the attractive well of Fig. 2(b), in which H20 transiently forms. 315</page><page sequence="8">Energy transfer in gases In all three types of surface illustrated in Fig. 2, the potential energy rises very rapidly at very small distances of approach, since the interaction is then dominated by the mutual repulsion of the nuclei. A particular collision may not sample a close region of the surface, but in any event this feature indicates that non-reacting molecules must ultimately rebound from one another. The kinetic energy that molecules possess before they interact is obviously important. If they have a high initial translational energy, this enables them to sample harder regions of the energy surface and opens up channels of energy transfer that would have remained closed to slower moving partners. Thus, in process (1) the energetics not only require the partners to have high translational energy but the mechanism of (1) also requires the partners to sample the hard repulsive wall of the potential surface. Reasons for this will be considered later in connection with the reverse of process (1). Figs. 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) represent two-dimensional cuts through three- dimensional surfaces. By convention these cuts are always made through the most attractive, or least unattractive, part of the potential energy surface. The three- dimensional character of a surface may however be important, as we shall see when we come to consider rotational energy transfer. For example, H may approach OH from the O end or H end of OH or from across the bond. The latter would be attractive, as in Figs. 2(b) and 3(b), whereas the first two would be repulsive in nature. A further point is that in developing this picture of molecular interactions we have considered the interacting molecules as point masses. Inherent in this is the assumption that no major reorganization is occurring internally in either partner. Fig. 3. (a) A typical molecular trajectory on a surface of type 2(a); (b) on a surface of type 2(b). The dotted lines indicate the original directions of motion of the colliding partners and the heavy lines the paths they take. The shaded area in (b) covers the part of the trajectory in the attractive well of Fig. 2(b) in which a combined molecule can transiently form. 316</page><page sequence="9">David Field For most purposes it is indeed a good approximation to think of an energy trans- ferring collision as being one in which the partners are not greatly distorted from their unperturbed structures. The molecules involved can therefore be thought of as vibrating and rotating much as they did as isolated molecules. Putting together the concepts of internal molecular energy and potential energy surfaces, we now have the framework for understanding energy transferring collisions. Using this framework 1 shall discuss various examples of energy transfer and by selecting a few specific systems attempt to give an overview of the principles of experimental techniques and qualitative theoretical understanding. 2. Experiments in energy transfer 2.1 . Experimental principles and methods In a perfect energy transfer experiment, all energies of both collision partners would be precisely known. Bulk gas samples could not be used; in a bulk sample the relative translational energy of collision varies from collision to collision over a wide range defined by the bulk gas temperature. Since for the purpose of detection it is always necessary to study many collisions, only a grossly averaged relative translational energy is defined. In order to overcome this problem, experiments have been devised in which beams of molecules of selected internal energy and of accurately defined translational energy are crossed in regions of very low back- ground pressure, interacting and scattering at the crossing point. These are complex experiments and their interpretation is of corresponding complexity. Suffice it to say that from the angular distribution of the scattered molecules it is possible to derive detailed information of the form of the potential energy surface of the interacting partners. There is a small but growing body of systems which have been studied in great depth: these include rotational excitation of H2 molecules in collisions with Li+ ions,1 vibrational excitation of C02 and N20 (bends and stretches) in collisions with Li+,2 and excitation of H2 in collisions with H+,3 to name but three. Investigations involving crossed beams stand apart in their experimental and theoretical sophistication and it is not possible to dwell on them here at any further length. The great majority of experimentalists are prepared to forego accurate definition of translational energy and to concentrate on precise internal energy selection of the molecules to be studied. In order to understand the essential principle of these experiments, it is necessary to enter into a small diversion in statistical mechanics. I have described how molecules may possess electronic, vibrational and rotational energies. The question is, how many molecules occupy any one of these rovibronic* levels in a bulk gas sample? Molecular populations are rapidly being interconverted by collisions and a statistical treatment enables the prediction of populations of specified rovibronic levels at equilibrium. Since we write of equilibrium, there is unlimited time for the interconversion of energy by *An elision of rotational, irrational, electr onic. 317</page><page sequence="10">Energy transfer in gases collision, and rates of individual processes are immaterial. The arguments of statistical mechanics show that populations of an energy level bear an inverse exponential relationship with the energy of the requisite energy level relative to kT. Thus the population of HCl (y = 1 ) relative to the ground state HCl (v = 0) popu- lation at room temperature is given by: HCl (y = 1 )/HCl (v = 0) « exp(-2990 ļkT) (kT = 208 cm"1) = 5.7 X 10" 7 (2) Superimposed upon this vibrational population distribution is a distribution of rotational level populations. These form a much more uniform distribution with Fig. 4. Rotational levels and relative equilibrium populations of CO (v - 0) from y = 0to7= 12. 318</page><page sequence="11">David Field respect to J , the rotational quantum number, since the rotational quantum is generally a good deal less than kT. Fig. 4 shows rotational populations for CO in v = 0 at 300 K. Because of the large size of the electronic quantum, at all normal temperatures excited electronic populations are zero. The essential principle of energy transfer experiments is that the statistical distribution of populations should be strongly perturbed and the experiment designed to observe the initial processes in a return to equilibrium. The develop- ment of lasers has revolutionized the field of energy transfer experiments, since laser sources provide exactly the initial powerful perturbation of precisely defined energy* necessary for detailed energy transfer experiments. Absorbing laser radiation, a larger number of molecules are 'pumped up' from their instantaneous equilibrium level to some excited state. It is necessary to recognize at this point that molecules absorb light at certain characteristic energies (wavelengths) only, these energies corresponding to a transition between a specific ground and excited level. The vibrational and rotational quantum numbers and the electronic states assigned to these ground and excited levels have been determined for a very large variety of molecules through the efforts of molecular spectroscopists. Therefore, by choosing the laser wavelength correctly, you can choose to create a population of excited molecules in a specific energy level (or set of levels). Once these molecules are 'pumped up', what is their fate? In the small molecular systems we are considering, one of two events can now take place in the return of the system towards equilibrium. The molecules can either lose all (or part) of the energy they were given by the laser light through a collision, or the energy can be given out as fluorescent light (Fig. 5). If fluorescence can be observed, this often provides the key to the experimental measurement of energy transfer rates. The intensity of fluorescence is proportional to the population of the excited level, and therefore observation of temporal decay of fluorescence provides a direct measure of the decay of an excited state population with time. An excited level has a characteristic lifetime for natural fluorescent decay. These are shortest for the shortest wavelength emissions and rapidly increase as the wavelength increases, that is, as the quantum of emitted fluorescence contains increasingly less energy. Fluorescence competes with the deactivating collisions we are studying. If the natural fluorescent lifetime is too long there may be such a high probability that a deactivating collision will occur before fluorescence can take place that all fluor- escence is quenched. Under these circumstances fluorescence experiments cannot work. Fluorescent lifetimes range from ~ 1 ns to tens of microseconds for electronic energy changes, milliseconds to 1 or 2 s for vibrational changes, and seconds to hours, or longer, for rotational changes. Since in gases at normal working pressures collisions occur at a rate of tens of thousands to millions per second, with a * It is essential to distinguish between energy absorbed by a molecule-determined by wavelength of radiation-and the intensity or power of the laser light falling on a molecule. 319</page><page sequence="12">Energy transfer in gases Fig. 5. The principle of fluorescence experiments is illustrated. Laser light excites molecules from the ground into an excited state (vibrational or electronic). Collisions now compete with fluorescence in causing molecules to return to the ground state. proportional efficiency ranging over many orders of magnitude, pressure conditions can normally be adjusted so that fluorescence from electronic, and some vibrational, transitions can be observed. For lower energy vibrations (e.g. bends) and rotational transitions, simple fluorescence experiments cannot be performed and recourse has to be made to more complicated techniques. These often involve the use of two lasers. One laser pumps up molecules from the ground state just as in Fig. 5, whilst the second laser probes excited state populations by inducing a transition from the excited state to a still higher excited state (Fig. 6). The absorption of the probe laser beam can be used as a measure of the population of level A (Fig. 6). Alternatively the higher excited state, B, may fluoresce with sufficiently short lifetime for the fluorescence to be used as a measure of the probe absorption and hence of the population of A. Ground state to A might be a rotational or vibrational quantum transition, A to B could be another such, or it could be an electronic transition. Techniques in which two lasers are used, as in Fig. 6, are termed 'double resonance' methods, the term resonance referring to any process which occurs only at characteristic energies- in this case the absorption of radiation. 2.2. Some representative systems and experiments 2.2 .i. The transfer of electronic to other forms of energy. One of the simplest energy transfer experiments involves the quenching of molecular electronic fluor- escence. The example I choose involves the quenching of A OH by collisions with N2 and H20 to its ground state X OH.4 OH radicals are very reactive and in order 320</page><page sequence="13">David Field Fig. 6. The principle of double resonance experiments is illustrated. A powerful 'pump' laser populates level A. Collisional events occur removing molecules from A. Populations of A are monitored with a probe laser, which takes molecules into B, through absorption of the probe or through fluorescence of molecules in B (as shown). to maintain a high and steady concentration it has been found best to flow a gas mixture at a speed of around 50 m s-1 down a narrow tube, typically 25 mm in diameter, at a total pressure of one to a few torr, using a large pump to create the flow. Radicals are produced by a microwave discharge in H2 (diluted to a few per cent in helium), to give H atoms, which react with N02 introduced into the flowing gas: H + N02 OH + NO (3) OH radicals are formed in the ground (X) state and are excited to the A state with a laser- or if finances are tight, any other source which produces light at a wavelength around 3090 Â. A OH can now radiate naturally, Ã OH -&gt; X OH + light (4) 321</page><page sequence="14">Energy transfer in gases or the electronic excitation can be quenched by collision A OH + M (= N2 or H2 O) X OH + M (5) Most of the gas present is helium and this has been found to have a very low efficiency in quenching A OH. The efficiency of (5) is measured by adding increasingly large proportions of N2 (or H20) to the flowing mixture, and observing the steady emission intensity,/^, of X OH. This will of course be proportional to the concentration of A OH in the mixture. As more N2 is added, so If drops. For the same proportion of H20 added as N2 the emission drops about 18 times as much, indicat- ing that H20 is 18 times more efficient in process (5) than N2. This behaviour is shown in Fig. 7, adapted from reference 4. How can we interpret this result? OH and N2 or OH and H20 may be seen as presenting an effective target area to each other for the process of quenching. This target area is termed the cross-section for the process. From the data of Fig. 7 it is possible to estimate the cross section for (5). For quenching by N2 this cross-section is about 0.35 Â2, whereas for H20 the value is 6.2 Â2. Thus N2 presents a target only 0.66 Â in diameter and H20, 2.8 Â. The molecule of N2 has a physical size 2 or 3 times as great as this target diameter, and H20 is rather smaller than the target Fig. 7.

The reciprocal of if is plotted v. partial pressure of N2 or H20 added to the gas mixture. Adapted from Ref. 4. 322</page><page sequence="15">David Field diameter. Differences in physical size certainly cannot explain the factor of 18 in efficiency between N2 and H20. The reason must be sought in some significant difference in the interaction potential energy surface for N2 + OH and H20 + OH. A striking contrast between N2 and H20 is that the latter has a strong dipole moment, whereas the former has none. The dipole moment of H20 can interact with the physically extensive unpaired electron on OH at long range and thus cause a change in electronic state in the radical. This would explain how the apparent target diameter for (5) can be greater than the physical diameter of an H20 mol- ecule; A OH and H20 do not have to crash into each other for the A OH to be quenched. The process is efficiently triggered by the dipole on H20 tickling the unpaired electron on OH before there is a hard physical collision. This mechanism is not available to N2. The experiment I have outlined probes only electronic energy removal. One cannot specify from the experimental data into what form of excitation the electronic energy of A OH is channelled in the N2 or H20. As far as I am aware, it is not known what proportion of the energy is converted into vibration and rotation of the collision partners, and what proportion into translation. Further- more all manner of vibrational and rotational energy transfer processes will be occurring simultaneously with (5) and we will now move on to a consideration of the former: in this case we will specify that the energy is being converted into translational energy of the collision partner. 2.2.ii. Vibrational-to-translational energy transfer. A large number of experiments have been performed on the quenching of vibrational excitation in hydrogen halides. This is largely because of the importance of hydrogen halide laser systems. I have chosen to describe HCl (y = 1) + M HCl (y = 0) + M (6) where M is a quenching atom. The principle of the majority of recent experiments is as follows. A pulsed HCl laser produces a short, high power burst of radiation with a duration of a few jits, of energy such as to excite molecules of HC1(V = 0) to HCl (y = 1): Hci("=o) hci("=i) (?) At equilibrium at 300 K, the population of HCl(y = 1) is only 5.7 X 10" 7 of the total gas pressure and a powerful laser pulse as in (7) produces a strong perturbation to the equilibrium population. Directly after the laser pulse, level populations begin to decay back towards their equilibrium values. This decay proceeeds via process (6) and also through the emission of fluoresence, HCl (i/ = 1) HCl ( v = 0) 4- light (8) 323</page><page sequence="16">Energy transfer in gases in a way analogous to process (4). By observing the decay of fluorescent emission with time at a variety of different pressures of M (= He for example), the rate of (6) has been measured.5 Process (6) turns out to be very inefficient with helium atoms as collision partners, the cross-section being only 4.4 X 10~6Â2. It is interesting to contrast this low efficiency with the result obtained if oxygen atoms take the place of helium in (6). 6 The experiment is more complicated since oxygen atoms have to be produced in a discharge and their concentrations measured (by chemical means). The principle of the experiment is the same however: time-resolved fluorescence of HCl(y = 1) is observed at a variety of concentrations of oxygen atoms. As expected, the decay of fluorescence is more rapid at high oxygen atom concen- trations than at low, and the experiment shows that the rate of decay is actually proportional to oxygen atom concentration. The process HCl (y = 1) + 0 -&gt; HCl (y = 0) + 0 (9) turns out to have a cross-section of 0.075 Â2, being about 15,000 times more efficient than the corresponding process with helium. Why is there this large difference in efficiencies and why is collisional deacti- vation with helium such an inefficient process? Within the period of vibration of HCl(i/ = 1) the potential energy of interaction of He with HCl must change in value by the v = 1 to v = 0 quantum of energy, that is ~3000 cm-1. The period of vibration is around 10~14s, and in this time a helium atom at room temperature travels about 0.1 Â. Only on the steeply repulsive part of the potential- the left- hand side of Fig. 2(a)- does the potential energy change by as much as 3000 cm"1 over a distance of only 0.1 Â. Therefore, to cause vibrational quenching the partners have to sample a very close-range region of the potential energy surface and the effective cross-section for the process can only be small. By contrast, oxygen atoms interact with HCl on a potential energy surface of the type in Fig. 2(c). Oxygen atoms can react with HCl to form OH and CI, and some collisions will indeed be reactive. Since reaction is a possible channel it is clear that oxygen atoms perturb the electron cloud of HCl strongly and that a strong perturbing force acts on the nuclei during the collision. This strong force, to be blatantly anthropomorphic, confuses the molecule with respect to its vibrational state and is therefore instru- mental in removing vibrational energy from HCl(i/ = 1). Moreover the force is both more effective, and a good deal longer range, than that between helium and HCl. Potentially reactive collision partners are, as a group, much more efficient in energy transfer than other partners, and the above picture of incipient chemical bond formation causing a strong perturbation at long range provides a generally valid physical model for the high efficiencies encountered. 2.2 .iii. Vibration-to-vibration energy transfer. When a vibrationally excited molecule collides with another molecule, as opposed to an atom, the transfer of vibrational energy through a vibration-vibration mechanism can be very efficient. For this reason, in 2.2.ii discussion was limited to atomic collision partners which can convert molecular vibrational energy only into translational energy. 324</page><page sequence="17">David Field f ' &lt; - o C 0 - ► 0 C 0 &lt; 0 C&lt; - 0 (a) (b) (c) Fig. 8. The three modes of vibration of C02: (a) symmetric stretch, (b) bend, (c) asymmetric stretch. Since V- V transfer is very important in the mechanism of C02 laser action, and C02 lasers are arguably the most important of all those yet invented, I have chosen to consider V-V transfer in C02. C02 can vibrate in three distinct and separate ways (Fig. 8) and vibrational energy may be converted between these three modes of vibration by collisions. Three quantum numbers are assigned to the vibrations of C02, one for each mode. For example C02 (0,0,1) signifies a molecule of C02 with one quantum of asymmetric stretch excited and the symmetric stretch and bend unexcited. In 1.1 it was mentioned that an important factor in determining the efficiency of an energy transfer process was the amount of energy that had to be transferred from one form of motion to another. The smaller this transferred energy is, the more efficiently a process will proceed. When the amount of energy is very small, say a few cm-1, a process is then said to be 'resonant'. V-V transfer processes can resonant: for example the first asymmetric stretch quantum of C02 and the first vibrational quantum of N2 are very close in energy and the process C02 (0,0,1 ) + N2(v = 0) C02 (0,0,0) + N2(v = 1)+ 19cm"1 (10) is of relatively high efficiency, with a cross-section of ~0.16 Â2.7 Experiments based on the principle of observing the time-resolved fluorescence from populations of vibrationally excited C02 (0,0,1) have been performed on a number of systems, including (10). These experiments are essentially similar to those already outlined concerning V-T transfer in HCl. They involve the observation of C02 (0,0,1) fluorescence. The following three examples C02 (0 ,0,1 ) + H20 (unexcited) -&gt; C02(0, 1,0)4- H20 (bend excited) + 87 cm-1 (11) C02(0,0,1) + C02(0,0,0) C02(0,0,0) + C02( 1,1,0) + 340cm'1 (12) C02(0, 0,1 ) + C02 (0,0,0) -&gt; C02(0,1,0) + C02 (1,0,0) + 340cm"1 (13) are less nearly resonant than (10) and it has been found that the efficiency of (10) &gt; (11) &gt; (12) « (13) that of (10) being about 200 times greater than that of (12) or (13).7 These data fit well with the notion that the more nearly resonant 325</page><page sequence="18">Energy transfer in gases a process is the more efficiently it proceeds. This simple idea should be used with circumspection however: consider HCl (y = 1) + CO (y = 0) -&gt; HCl (v = 0) + CO (v = 1) + 743 cm"1 (14) and HCl {v = 1) + N2(y = 0) -» HCl (v = 0) + N2(v = 1) + 555 cm"1 (15) (14) has been measured to be 3 times more efficient than (15) although 188 cm"1 less of energy need be transferred in the latter case.7 This suggests that details of the potential surface of interaction as well as energy resonance considerations may be critical in determining the efficiency of V-V transfer. C02 laser action is strongly influenced by V-V transfer in the following way. In a C02 laser an electrical discharge is made in a mixture of C02 and N2. Electrons in the discharge excite N2 to N2(v = 1) and this in turn excites C02(0,0,0) to C02 (0,0,1) through (16), the inverse of process (10). The working of the laser depends on transitions from molecules in the rotational levels associated with (0,0,1), and lasing action therefore depends critically on populations of (0,0,1) created in process (16) N2(v = 1) + C02(0,0,0) N2(V = 0) + C02(0,0,1) (16) and also on any collisional processes through which C02(0,0,1) can be deactivated, e.g. processes (1 1), (12) and (13). V-V transfer can sometimes result in quite remarkable effects. Thus if CH3F, methyl fluoride, is irradiated at around 1000cm"1, exciting a bending mode, processes of self V-V transfer between various modes of vibration of the molecule cause energy to be channelled into a stretching mode of CH3 F and fluorescence is emitted at 3000cm"1, 3 times the energy of the input radiation.8 2.2.iv. Rotational energy transfer. Rotational energy transfer occurs concur- rently with all the processes of vibrational and electronic transfer I have written of so far. However, if we are to consider changes in rotational energy alone, the precision of definition of molecular energy must become a good deal greater. A molecular population must now be created in a defined electronic, vibrational and rotational state. We want to know how a collision will knock molecules in this population into another rotational state of the same vibrational and electronic state. If e,v,J represent electronic, vibrational and rotational states respectively, and R some molecule, we want now to study M -*■ R(e,v,Jfinal) + M (17) R (c initial^ where e and v do not change in the collision. If we suppose, for simplicity, that M is an atom, then (17) represents pure rotational-to-translational energy transfer. Note that there will always be a number of possible levels Jrmal. There are only a very few experiments that have succeeded in measuring the efficiencies of pure R-T processes. One system that has been studied is 326</page><page sequence="19">David Field Ã NH2(e,v,Jinitial) + H - Ã NH2(e,v,Jfinal) + H (18) In this investigation,9 NH2 radicals were prepared by the reaction of H atoms with hydrazine, N2H4, in a system very similar to that in which OH radicals were formed (2.2.i). A dye-laser was used to excite NH2 from its ground state to its first electronically excited state, A NH2. Such a laser provides light of accurately known and tunable wavelength. Energy definition is sufficiently precise that a population of NH2 molecules can be prepared in the electronically excited state in both a known vibrational and rotational level. In other words the laser enables the preparation of a population of NH2 A^v,.^^). This will fluoresce back to the ground state in a time of about 10 /is. Therefore, if process £18) is to occur it must take place, on average, within this time. When it does so, A NH2(e,v, J fínal) popu- lation is formed and^this now fluoresces back to X NH2. Now since A NH2(e,v,Jinjtial) and A NH2(e,v,Jfjnal) represent populations with different internal energies, the two populations, when they fluoresce, will do so giving out light at different wavelengths. The occurrence of (18) can therefore be detected by analysing the fluorescent emission for its different component wavelengths, using a spectrometer. Since each rotational level of A NH2(e,v) will emit at characteristic wavelengths, all the Jfinai's may be indentified. From the intensity of emission from the different rotational levels, their relative populations mayj)e worked out. These data allow the calculation of the average cross-section that A NH2 presents to H atoms for the process of R-T energy transfer. This has been found to be very large, lying in the region of 100 Â2. Another experiment measuring the absolute efficiency of rotational energy transfer used the principle of double resonance mentioned in 2.1. The experiment10 involved the process CO(v = 1,7= I0) + C0 -► CO 0= 1, all other/) + CO (19) The CO collision partner is in v = 0 but may be in any rotational level. The popu- lation CO (v = 1 , J = 10) is scattered by collision into all other accessible rotational levels of y = 1. (19) is a combination of R-T and R-R processes, the latter being those in which CO molecules interchange rotational energy, one rotating more rapidly than before the collision, and the other more slowly. With reference to Fig. 6, the pump laser is a CO laser operating on the v = 0, J = 11 to v = 1,/ = 10 transition of CO. This laser is pulsed and excites a sample of CO, quite separate of course from the laser itself. A population ofCO(v= 1,/= 10) is formed: C0(v = 0,/=ll)ļ^c0(v=l,/=10) (20) The experiment uses another CO laser to observe the decay of this population towards its original equilibrium value. This second CO laser, the 'probe', operates continuously on transitions between rotational levels of the v = 1 and v = 2 vibrational states of CO, levels A and B of Fig. 6 respectively. Major items of the 327</page><page sequence="20">Energy transfer in gases Fig. 9. A schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus used in the double resonance experiment on CO described in the text. A is a partly transmitting and reflecting mirror, B is the cell of CO under study. Adapted and simplified from Ref. 10. experimental system are shown in Fig. 9. If the probe laser wavelength is adjusted so that the wavelength corresponds to a transition with a lower state v= 1,7 = 10, then probe laser light on passing through the sample of CO will only be absorbed by molecules in the v - 1,7= 10 level. The effect of the pulsed pump will therefore be to reduce the intensity of the probe laser falling on the detector (Fig. 9). As the population of v = 1,7= 10 falls due to collisions the signal due to the probe laser will therefore rise. Since rotational energy transfer is so much more efficient than vibrational- compare the cross-section under the present heading and those of 2.2.ii, ~0.1 Â2- the decay of the v - 1,7= 10 population is due to rotational energy transferring collisions as in (19). A typical example of raw data from this double resonance experiment is shown in Fig. 10, adapted from Ref. 8; from these and similar data, a cross-section for process (19) could be worked out and was found to be 58 Â2. The experiment went further and asked the question: what rotational levels are populated in process (19)? This could be answered by setting the probe laser to new wavelengths so that it now gave a measure of the population of v = 1,7= 11 or 9, etc. This is illustrated in Fig. 11 for the A7 = -1 case. It was found that the transfer of rotational energy proceeded two-thirds by A7 = ± 1 and one third by A7 = ±2. What is the essential mechanism of rotational energy transfer? The basic con- sideration is that this transfer depends on the anisotropy of the interaction potential, or of its gradient, the force field. In order to change the rate of rotation of a molecule, a torque must be exerted on it, and the anisotropy of the interaction force field provides the means by which this torque is applied. Consider the example 328</page><page sequence="21">David Field Fig. 10. The temporal decay of CO (v = 1,7 = 10) population monitored by a decrease in absorption of the probe laser beam. Pressure of CO in the cell B (Fig. 9) = 5.4 X 1 0"3 torr. Adapted from Ref. 10. of CO + CO, process (19)ģ Forces between CO molecules are dominated by so- called 'dispersion forces'. These are caused by the transient dipoles in the molecules arising from electronic motions in them- for a good description see Reference 11. Such forces, depending as they do on the instantaneous configurations of electron clouds, will also depend on the orientation of these clouds towards one another and thus on the relative orientation of the two CO molecules. Therefore on collision two CO molecules will experience forces which vary as their relative orientation changes. Thus the collision may initially occur end to end, CO-CO, and progress C-0 through an orientation ^ q, the force differing quite markedly for these two orientations. This is the anisotropy which provides the torque necessary to change the rotational state of one or both the CO molecules. Dispersion forces arise with- out overlap of electron clouds, and therefore provide quite a long range anisotropy without the necessity for hard physical collisions. The other example, H + NH2, is a potentially reactive system. When H approaches NH2 at 90° to the plane of the radical, this will lead to the transient formation of NH3 in its preferred pyramidal configuration in its electronic ground state. If H now moves round and is orientated in the plane of NH2, then a transient electronically-excited NH3 is incipiently formed. Thus the trajectory of H around NH2 is alternately very attractive, to form ground state NH3, and weakly attractive or even somewhat repulsive, to form excited state NH3. The interacting partners move on a potential surface that alternates between types 2(b) and 2(a). Further- more, this strong anisotropy acts at ranges of 4-5 Â, where electron overlap between 329</page><page sequence="22">Energy transfer in gases Fig. 11. The principle of the experimental investigation of CO(i/ = 1,7- 10) + CO - CO(v=l,7=9) i CO The pump laser removes part of the population of v - 0,7 = 11 (Fig. 4) and causes molecules to enter v = 1,7= 10 which has negligible equilibrium popu- lation. The appearance of population in v - 1,7 = 9 is monitored with the probe laser. the clouds of H and NH2 is starting to be significant. This results in the large observed cross-section for rotational transfer of NH2by H atoms. Experiments on CO rotational energy transfer are very relevant in astrophysics. CO is the most abundant molecule in interstellar clouds apart from H2, and CO maps of interstellar regions have come to be used as standard indicators of the temperature and pressure in these clouds. Estimations of temperature and pressure, however, depend critically on data for rotational energy transfer of CO, since it is . from rotational level populations that temperature and pressure are inferred. The H and NH2 experimental data were also of importance in understanding radio- astronomical observations. The system H + NH2 bears a strong physical resemblance to H + OH and H + CH. OH (and almost certainly CH) are molecules responsible for one of the more extraordinary radio observations of the last 10 or 15 years, that 330</page><page sequence="23">David Field of naturally occurring lasers in outer space- the so-called interstellar masers.12 Interpretation of the data accumulated on the H + NH2 system gave grounds for the development of a theoretical framework by which to understand rotational energy transfer in H (and H2) with OH or CH.13 Calculations showed how collisional excitation of certain modes of molecular rotation could lead to the population inversion necessary for maser action. In the two examples given, rotational exchange takes place through gentle collisions between the molecules involved. The J quantum number changes by only 1 or 2, and weakly up to 4, in a discriminating way. The manner of this discrimi- nation is described in some detail for a large number of systems in Reference 14. There are a number of examples of rotational transfer in which much less gentle collisions predominate. For example, in collisions of helium atoms with Na2, changes of J are found up to 14. 15 Such hard collisions are typical of those in which inert gas atoms are the collision partner. In helium 4- Na2, for example, the partners sample a close range anisotropy and in doing so the helium atom crashes hard against the Na2. However, even with collisions involving helium, if, in theoretical calculations, the kinetic temperature is reduced to a few degrees K, very subtle effects depending on the details of the energy surface become apparent. Such low temperature collisions are of interest to astrophysicists but have not yet proved experimentally accessible. 2.2 .v. Further modes of energy transfer and an overview of all processes . There are a number of types of energy transfer that 1 have not yet mentioned. For example, an electronically excited atom can transfer its energy into electronic excitation (often of another atom), or vibrational excitation:16 °(eleS5a"y)+ N. - o(^)+ ") CD V-R transfer has been observed in a few systems, for example7 N2 O (0,1,0) + H2(/= 1) -&gt; N2 O (0,0,0) + H2 (/ = 3) + 2 cm-1 (22) where N20 vibrations are denoted as in C02 . R-R transfer is very difficult to investi- gate and one of very few indisputable examples is the exchange of rotational energy between H20 and NH317 H20(R,) + NH3(R2) -&gt; H20(R3) + NH3(R4) + 0.8 cm-1 (23) where Rj . . R4 represent rotational states of H20 and NH3. The internal energy of R! and R2 is only 0.8 cm"1 more than that of R3 and R4. Indeed (21), (22) and (23) are all closely resonant, involving the transfer of very little excess energy into trans- lation. This appears to be characteristic of efficient processes involving the exchange of one type of internal motion for another. One last energy exchange process is that of translation-to-translation. Dynamically this takes place through a simple billiard-ball action and the cross-section is likely to be determined by the sizes of 331</page><page sequence="24">Energy transfer in gases the molecules involved. Note that R-T or R-R may be significantly faster than T-T, since the former do not require physical collision but often can rely on the action of long-range force fields. The stage has been reached at which we can review all the energy transfer processes that a gas molecule may undergo. Consider a bulb full of (say) C02 at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The efficiency with which a molecule undergoes a particular energy transfer process can be characterized through a relaxation time. Thus, if the relaxation time for V-V is 10~8s this implies that a molecule of (say) C02 (0,1,0) is going to lose that vibrational energy within a time (on average) of 5 ns after having acquired the energy from some previous V-V or V-T transfer process. Fig. 12 summarizes a set of relaxation times. These, I should emphasize, are very much order-of-magnitude values which might apply equally well to C02 or any other small molecule of the type I have been dealing with. Electronic excitation is of course non-existent at room temperature. Fig. 12. Characteristic relaxation times for a sample of gas (such as C02) at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. 332</page><page sequence="25">David Field 3. Concluding remarks In this article I have concentrated on the interpretation of experimental results through molecular dynamics. Whilst efficiencies of energy transfer are certainly related to bulk phenomena, the demand today is for a microscopic rather than macroscopic understanding of gas phase collisions. Detailed information on collisional dynamics requires detailed experiments and there are a large number of these from which to choose. Earlier work involving shock tubes and ultrasonic techniques has not been mentioned,7'18 and even amongst laser-based experiments, reviewed in Reference 19, only a very few specific examples have been dealt with in any depth. I have chosen work that illustrates the principles of most exper- iments reported in the present-day literature. Descriptions of the latest work on energy transfer are to be found liberally sprinkled over the pages of the Journal of Chemical Physics , Chemical Physics Le tiers, Molecular Physics and Physical Review Letters (to name but four). The great majority of these experiments are based on the methods of laser-induced fluorescence, pulsed and continuous, or on the double resonance technique, in a great variety of spectral regions. These investigations continue by more precise and effective means the work indicated using the earlier non-laser methods. The most serious omission in this article is that there has been no mention of the quantitative theory of molecular collisions. I have related experimental data to potential energy surfaces in a number of cases, but in truth the connection can only be made through the medium of the so-called scattering theory of molecular collisional dynamics. Accurate potential energy surfaces have been independently calculated for a few systems and these may be tested using scattering theory for their ability to reproduce experimental cross-sections. This presents a rosy picture of collaboration between theoreticians and experimentalists- indeed too rosy a picture. Many branches of science exhibit the characteristic that problems tractable to theorists are intractable to experimentalists and vice versa: the field of energy transfer has proved no exception to this. In recent years this impasse has been partly surmounted, especially in the field of crossed-beam experiments. Exper- imental investigations are beginning to yield numerous data amenable to quantitative theoretical interpretation as modern computers make larger calcu- lations feasible. What is the way forward in energy transfer? There will be an increasingly accurate definition of internal molecular energy as laser systems proliferate and become wavelength-tunable in new spectral regions. An area where little precise data exist is that of R-T transfer. Theoreticians would certainly hope to see a marked expansion in this field, since so many calculations relate to rotational transfer with no experimental data for comparison. The relevance of R-T in astro- physics has already been remarked upon. New techniques may involve the use of far infra-red lasers and rotational cooling nozzles: the use of the latter for energy 333</page><page sequence="26">Energy transfer in gases transfer studies has already been pioneered.20 In conclusion I should say that if the coming decade proves as fruitful in new data, techniques and theoretical advance as the previous, this article will be quite redundant by 1990.
