<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID H. RUSSELL University of California, Berkeley Six Studies of Children's Understanding of Concepts According to an old saying, "Knowl- edge does not keep any better than fish." In these days of explosive growth of knowledge, no child or teacher can observe or read fast enough to keep up with the new knowledge that is being discovered. More than ever be- fore it is important to identify the basic concepts of a discipline and to study children's progress in the understand- ing and the use of those concepts. Sub- ject-matter concepts and structure must be considered not only in terms of their significance in the discipline but in the light of children's learning and reten- tion. The research on children's concepts suggests that we have considerable in- formation on concept discovery, on methods of concept formation, on fac- tors that affect the development of concepts, on children's knowledge of concepts, and on ways of teaching for effective development of concepts (1). The present report deals with six un- published doctoral dissertations at the University of California, Berkeley, sponsored by the writer. All six studies deal with children's knowledge of con- cepts and offer some clues to ways of developing concepts, to typical under- standing at various levels, and to pos- sible applications in the curriculum. This research suggests that studies do not always agree on methods of determining when a concept is learned. Different criteria have been used, for example, in classifying errors and cor- rect responses in discrimination exper- iments, in analyzing products through some system of content analysis, and in scoring associative responses. What- ever criterion is used, it seems clear, however, that concepts may be un- known, partly known, or thoroughly understood. Eskridge made this point in relation to children's knowledge of geographi- cal terms (2). He stated that under- standing grows through an increase in the number of meanings, an increase in general information, a reduction of er- rors, and a "substitution of basic for associated meanings." He also con- cluded that understanding is "a relative term. " This point was verified and extended in an unpublished study by Bates, who developed a list of terms used in the social studies in California schools and tested children's knowledge of the terms in the fifth through the ninth 255</page><page sequence="2">256 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL February 1963 grades (3). He found that some con- cepts such as transportation were well known at all levels; some concepts such as slums and co-operation were known by increasing numbers of pupils from grade to grade; and some concepts, such as closed shop and conservation were relatively unknown at all levels. Bates reported another finding that has been relatively neglected in similar investi- gations. This finding concerned corre- lation of the score on his social con- cepts tests with the results of tests of critical reading and of critical thinking. The coefficients of correlation were .50 and .72, respectively. The nature of partial learnings, also of social concepts, was further ex- plored by Ramonda who studied chil- dren's ideas of liberty and justice in Grades 2, 4, 6, and 8 by means of a test, by analysis of children's free writ- ing, and by interviews (4). He found that justice was a more difficult con- cept than liberty. He also found that types of knowledge, especially in re- gard to justice, tend to change from grade to grade, from the use of inap- propriate synonyms and antonyms and considerable reliance on references to the Constitution, to the use of cor- rect synonyms and relevant examples from the world around. Misconcep- tions seemed to be related to lack of experience, with the influence of the school on the knowledge of these con- cepts becoming apparent in the sixth and eighth grades. Ramonda's findings about justice were related to the earlier work of Piaget, who questioned chil- dren about justice in relation to the rules of a game of marbles (5). Ra- monda, who used specific questions, obtained findings that agreed with Pia- get's on the type of punishment chil- dren recommended. Concepts of the San Francisco children studied by Ra- monda changed at an earlier age than the ideas of the Swiss children inter- viewed by Piaget, however. Such re- sults suggest the possible influence of the home and community environment on the development of social concepts. In research by Ramonda and by others, chronological age, mental age, reading ability, and status of family occupation were all positively related to scores on tests of many aspects of liberty and justice. The relation of home and occupation to children's aspirations and concepts was studied by Choate in two sharply contrasting groups of children in Fres- no County, California (6). The low socioeconomic group was made up of children of migrant cotton workers. The higher socioeconomic group was made up of established, middle-class families. Both groups included Anglo and Mexican children. The greatest differences between the two socioeco- nomic groups were in the area of the children's aspirations in saving for the future, going to college, and the type of home in which they expected to live. Differences in other attitudes as re- vealed by interview responses to pic- tures and questions were never more than 20 per cent on any item. The greatest differences in concepts con- cerned the home or family, for exam- ple, the way punishment should be ad- ministered and the response to a baby or younger children. Ideas about the</page><page sequence="3">UNDERSTANDING CONCEPTS 257 school involving such concepts as the role of the teacher, the reason for ab- sence, and proper behavior were much the same in both the low and the high socioeconomic groups. Choate empha- sized the unifying influence of the pub- lic school in acculturation, in develop- ing a sense of belonging, in learning how to plan, and in expressing one's ideas. The influence of the home and other institutions was also illustrated by Nix- on in a study of children's concepts of God and related religious beliefs (7). Nixon used responses to pictures shown in individual interviews with 164 children from public and from church-affiliated schools. The children were in the first, third, and fifth grades and lived in prosperous suburban com- munities. First-graders mentioned God as "in heaven" more than the older children, who responded in such terms as "in church" and "with people." The third-graders spoke most frequently of God in anthropomorphic terms, the fifth-graders in terms of what God does for people and expects of them. In the third and fifth grades, children from a parochial school expressed more ideas about God than children from a public school, with emphasis on such statements as "God is everywhere" and "God answers prayer." The pub- lic school children mentioned more fre- quently such ideas as "God is in heav- en" and God is important because "everybody's the same." Children from homes affiliated with evangelical groups expressed more ideas than chil- dren from homes affiliated with larger and older religious denominations.Nix- on believed that in the area of religious belief the home was the most impor- tant influence on the child. Other examples of influence of the school on children's concepts were found in the studies by Hamilton (8) and by Bovyer (9). Hamilton com- pared concepts about soil and water conservation learned by 306 pupils in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. The pupils were in three groups: first, pupils who studied conservation with teachers who had attended a carefully planned workshop on conservation; second, pupils who studied conserva- tion with teachers who had not partici- pated in a workshop; third, pupils who did not study conservation in the school situation. The children in the three groups were equated on the basis of chronological age, reading ability, and initial knowledge of conservation con- cepts. There were no significant differ- ences in the gains in knowledge of soil and water conservation between the pupils in the first and the second groups, but both these groups gained signifi- cantly more than the pupils of the third group. Hamilton found that children in the sixth and the seventh grades made greater gains in test scores and re- sponses to pictures than children in the eighth grade. He found that teach- ing increases the range of pupil knowl- edge. He believed that a five-day work- shop for teachers does not insure great- er gains in concepts for their pupils. Bovyer's study also suggested that it is difficult to affect concept develop- ment through relatively simple school procedures. His study of children in Grades 4, 5, and 6 overlapped the areas</page><page sequence="4">258 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL February 1963 of concept development and the influ- ence of children's literature. He inves- tigated the effects on the children's understanding of the concept of sports- manship growing out of their listening to twelve sports stories that illustrated various phases of the concept. To con- trol conditions in various classes, the stories were read without subsequent discussion by teachers or pupils. Bov- yer used content analysis of children's writing before and after hearing the stories in the experimental groups and writing done at the same time by pupils in the control group, who did not hear the stories. He found some loss over a six-week interval in the number of ideas expressed in both the experimen- tal and the control groups, but the loss was less in the experimental groups. At these grade levels the responses of the children before hearing the stories could be categorized into sixteen at- tributes of sportsmanship, such as play- ing by the rules, respecting the deci- sions and opinions of others, and being a good team player. The mean number of categories mentioned by any one child was about five before and after reading the stories. Bovyer believed the lack of increase in scores was due to the experimental conditions that prevented the use of discussion after the children had listened to the stories. Perhaps concepts are not built simply by hearing about them in fictional form. The investigations briefly reviewed are fairly typical of an increasing num- ber of studies appearing in psychologi- cal and educational reports of children's understanding of concepts. These and previous reports suggest that, in our modern, complex culture, the task of acquiring meanings is an enormous one. Children normally learn many concepts before they enrol in school, but investigations, at any grade level or in adulthood, may reveal large gaps in the individual's knowledge of mean- ings. As suggested by Bates, Ramonda, and others, concepts may be well un- derstood, partly understood, or un- known. (In televison, for example, the young child may be introduced to many ideas that he understands only in part.) The studies of Nixon, Choate, and others suggest that the home and the church may be influential in devel- oping some concepts before children enrol in school, but the task for the school is still a gigantic one. Studies such as those of Hamilton and Bovyer suggest that a few minor changes in the curriculum will not accomplish the task. More thoroughgoing study and revision are needed. To accomplish such changes and generally upgrade the knowledge of meanings, some hypotheses about the school's professional attack on the problem may be stated: First, important concepts must be iden- tified, selected, and clarified. Of the hundreds of terms used in elementary mathematics, which should have a prominent place in the elemen- tary-school curriculum? Of the thou- sands of concepts in the natural sci- ences, including brand new ones, which should be understood by elementary- school pupils or by high-school gradu- ates? Here the professor or the special- ist in subject matter and the curriculum committee of a school system must combine forces in determining goals for</page><page sequence="5">UNDERSTANDING CONCEPTS 259 knowledge and understanding. Sixth- graders should probably not be ex- pected to understand Zyzzogeton, but they should probably know Mach IV. The selection of useful ideas may in- volve social utility as well as the place the ideas have in a network of mean- ings. Structural content and frequency of use may have to be reconciled in statements of some desirable goals in respect to knowledge of basic concepts. Second, curriculum-makers must be aware of what concepts are typically known at various age or grade levels. Of the concepts selected as valuable in the first step, some are harder than others; some sort of sequence or pro- gression in learning must be planned. The concepts typically known at the eighth-grade level, for example, may not be entirely satisfactory from the standpoint of ultimate goals or subject- matter logic, and curriculums may have to be made more rigorous. But results of research on children's knowledge of social or other concepts at the eighth- grade level can be compared with find- ings of similar studies at other levels, and whole sequences of experiences de- veloping social concepts can be up- graded or downgraded. Thus, through knowledge of relative difficulty, some continuity for development of social or other concepts can be established. This hypothesis, incidentally, opposes in part Bruner's proposition that "any idea can be represented honestly and usefully in the thought forms of chil- dren of school age" (10: 33). The evidence is clear that in typical homes and classrooms some concepts are much harder to learn than others. Third, knowledge of how concepts are normally learned can help determine se- quence in the curriculum. Concepts often develop slowly out of percepts, memories, and images, aided greatly by a variety of language and other symbols. Most children grad- ually achieve freedom from perceptual dependency. Conceptual construction may be likened to an ever enlarg- ing web of information: new expres- sions open up additional directions for growth that are related to previous strands and integrated into more com- plex, interlocking conceptual patterns. Growth in knowledge of concepts is probably not so much an additive process as an evaluative procedure that results in reconstruction of a concep- tual framework. Concepts may result from sudden insights, but more fre- quently they develop as part of a lace- work of coherence. What writers of curriculum guides have called correla- tion, articulation, and continuity at vari- ous times are still pertinent in cur- riculum construction. Fourth, results of research on concepts and vocabulary development should be combined in determining goals and pro- cedures. The interlocking of these two areas, one associated largely with psycholog- ical research and the other with edu- cational research, should be explored more fully. For example, knowledge of the relationship of understanding of multiple-meaning words (in vocabu- lary studies) to grasp of concepts (in psychological studies) may have prac- tical applications in the teacher's work.</page><page sequence="6">260 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL February 1963 In everyday activities, recognition vo- cabulary or a minimum knowledge of some concepts seems to be enough in the study of a discipline; other concepts must be learned more completely. A recent study showed that the relative difficulty of concepts may be different when the criterion is definitive or max- imum knowledge as compared with minimum knowledge. Studies in both conceptualization and vocabulary are needed, not only as recorded by varia- tions in children's scores, but in terms of the nature of the words themselves and the referents they represent. Such investigations might involve concrete, functional, and abstract meanings (11) or the different perceptual character of the referents of varied nouns, verbs, and other classes of words. The six unpublished studies briefly described here used such techniques as tests, interviews, picture interpreta- tions, records of class discussions, and written responses to get at children's understanding of concepts. Other methods and materials will be needed to check the four hypotheses. The studies suggest that the concept ap- proach to the curriculum must be de- veloped from multiple bases. The logic of content or the structure known to the specialist is a skeleton that must be mobilized with the muscles of many concept-building experiences. As Mi- chael West once suggested, there can be changes in meaning gradients from perceptible, through inferrible and ex- plainable, to twistable. Children need experiences on all these levels of be- havior. REFERENCES 1. David H. Russell. "Concepts," Encyclo- pedia of Educational Research, third edition, pp. 323-33.
