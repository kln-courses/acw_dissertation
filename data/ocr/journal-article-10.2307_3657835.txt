<plain_text><page sequence="1">741 Beyond Image: The Apophatic-Kataphatic Dialectic in Teresa de Avila Barbara Mujica Georgetown University Abstract: Catholicism distinguishes between two different approaches to spirituality. Apophatic, or "nega- tive" spirituality stresses interiority, "imageless-ness" and "wordlessness." Kataphatic, or "positive" spiritual- ity is image-driven and uses analogies to speak of God. Teresa de Avila draws on both traditions. Inspired by Francisco de Osuna's practice of recogimiento, Teresa describes the inward movement of the soul. The inco- herent, impressionistic quality of her prose results from the amassment of disparate metaphors that ultimately transcend word and image, deconstructing all rational notions of God. However, her familiarity with Ignatius's Ejercicios espirituales made her acutely aware of the effectiveness of image to spur spiritual experience, and she builds on images of Christ and the Virgin in order to overcome spiritual dryness and intensify prayer. The apophatic-kataphatic dialectic creates an exquisite tension in her work. Key Words: Teresa de Avila, mysticism, recogimiento, kataphatic spirituality, apophatic spirituality, visions, mystical marriage, devotio moderna, Ignatius of Loyola, Francisco de Osuna atholicism has traditionally dis- tinguished between two different, but not mutually exclusive, ap- proaches to spirituality, the kataphatic and the apophatic, both defined by a late fifth-century monastic writer known as the Pseudo-Dionysius. Kataphatic spiri- tuality finds God in created things and uses images to stimulate spiritual experi- ence. Image-driven activities such as St. Ignatius's Spiritual Exercises are in the kataphatic tradition. Kataphatic spiritu- ality uses analogies to speak of God; God may be described as a friend or a lover, as Life or as Beauty, or we may say that God "sees" or "hears," using anthropomor- phic language. Kataphatic spirituality is termed "affirmative" or "positive" be- cause it asserts what God is, although al- ways assuming that God is this and more. The affirmative method starts with the highest categories of goodness, the ones most akin to God. It ascribes to God "the perfections found in the creatures, that is, the perfections which are compat- ible with the spiritual nature of God" (Copleston 109). The Pseudo-Dionysius avers that these names are always inad- equate, because God is always more-the super-essential Beauty, for example. That is, God "infinitely transcends the content of these names as experienced by us" (Copleston 109). Thus, when we say God "knows," we do not ascribe to Him the "knowing" that is limited by human intelligence, but mean that God knows in a way that infinitely exceeds our experi- ence. Apophatic spirituality, in contrast, stresses "imageless-ness" and "wordless- ness." The apophatic, or negative, ap- proach denies to God all "qualities of the creatures, until it reaches 'the super-es- sential darkness"' (Copleston 110). The goal is to obliterate all anthropomorphic notions of God (that is, the idea that God "sees" or "thinks" in human terms), not in order to understand God rationally, which is impossible, but in order to con- front the unknowable. "When the mind has stripped away from its idea of God the human modes of thought and inad- equate conceptions of the Deity, it enters upon the 'Darkness of Unknowing,' wherein it 'renounces all the apprehen- sion of the understanding and is wrapped in that which is wholly intangible and invis- ible'... [and is] united... to Him that is wholly unknowable" (Copleston 110). This eradication of the ego, this complete yield-</page><page sequence="2">742 HISPANIA 84 DECEMBER 2001 ing, is the "mystical marriage" between the soul and God, characterized in some mys- tics, such as Teresa de Avila, by raptures, visions or other altered states. Apophaticism emphasizes introspection and stillness. "Negative theology" does not conceive of God as unknowable because of His unintelligibility, but because of the finite, imperfect nature of the human mind, which is blinded by the light of God's per- fection. God cannot be described in human language because words are inadequate to the task. Thus, pure religion is experienced not through intermediaries (such as clergy, doctrine), but through naked faith. Apophaticism relies on "intuitive" rather than acquired knowledge and recognizes the inadequacy of language to express Truth. The devotio moderna-a movement originating in Holland that emphasized the inner life and downplayed the role of the intellect and sensory perception in the spiritual process, drew on the tradition of apophatic spirituality. The "new spiritu- ality" promoted mental prayer (as op- posed to ritualized vocal prayer) and reflection. Championed by Cardinal Jimenez de Cisneros, Queen Isabella's confessor and the founder of the Univer- sity of Alcala, the devotio moderna found wide acceptance among Spanish reform- ers of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Saint Teresa de Avila pinpoints in her Vida the moment when she was intro- duced to apophaticism through the devotio moderna. Having fallen seriously ill during her first year at the Convent of the Encarnaci6n, she left the cloister for treat- ment at Becedas and to recuperate at her sister's house at Castellanos de la Cafiada. On her way she visited her Uncle Pedro, who introduced her to El tercer abecedario espiritual (1537), by the Franciscan mystic Francisco de Osuna (Vida IV.7). Osuna's method was based on recogimiento, or recollection, a form of in- terior centering. Through recogimiento the soul withdraws into itself, shutting out all external stimuli, in order to open itself to the divine presence. Osuna does not deny completely the role of the senses in religious practice, but argues that the senses distract and stimulate, thereby in- hibiting perfect recollection. Through the process of recogimiento the physical senses are benumbed so that the spiritual or inte- rior senses can know God's light: "amones- tamos que, cerrando los sentidos corpo- rales y exteriores, abriesemos los interiores del anima y los avisasemos con solicito ejercicio, para que asi como con estos sentidos exteriores conocemos las cosas corporales, asi con los interiores del anima, siendo ejercitados, conozcamos las cosas espirituales y altas" (141). The indi- vidual advances spiritually "a manera de lechuza o murcielago" in order to become sensitive to the inner radiance (141). Like the senses, the intellect inhibits recollec- tion because "por la operaci6n intelectiva no se halla reposo entero y que satisfaga, aunque muchas y muy grandes consi- deraciones nuestro pensamiento halle y escudrifie, porque en fin serai mas la menor parte de lo que ignoramos que todo lo que sabemos" (337). Teresa describes the inward movement of the soul in much of her writing. The central image of Las moradas is the spheri- cal diamond castle comprising seven man- sions, or dwelling places, through which the soul travels inward to find God, who inhab- its the center. In Las moradas Teresa com- pares the soul with a sea urchin or a turtle, animals that retract into their shells. Per- haps one of her most exquisite metaphors is that of the soul as a moth, a creature that starts its life as a worm, then dies unto it- self to be reborn as something more beau- tiful-a being drawn inexorably to the light. All of these images connote retreat, interi- ority, shutting out. Like the moth drawn to the flame, the soul seeks divine light, but will be immolated (that is, enraptured and transformed) only after it has undergone a prolonged purgation, or darkness. Teresa describes the physical senses as the handmaidens of the intellect because they convey information to the mind, which the understanding then interprets. In</page><page sequence="3">THE APOPHATIC-KATAPHATIC DIALECTIC IN TERESA DE AVILA 743 Las moradas the senses are servants who inhabit the first mansion, which is sur- rounded by serpents and insects--that is, by the vanities and temptations of the ma- terial world. Because external stimuli en- gage the senses, which in turn stimulate the will, the soul can make no progress until these lackeys are put to sleep. Then the soul withdraws into itself, penetrating the inte- rior castle through meditation and prayer. The culmination of the experience is union, the mystical marriage that paradoxically fuses the darkness of unknowing with di- vine illumination. But if stillness and wordlessness are at the very core of apophaticism, how can we explain the exuberance of Saint Teresa's writing? If imagelessness is apophati- cism's essence, how can we explain the plethora of images that fill her pages? Apo- phaticism strives to overcome the limits of language by preparing the individual to receive the direct, personal awareness of the presence of God. Saint Teresa faces the challenge of describing in words a phe- nomenon that transcends language. Her struggle to express the inexpressible is in evidence in her constant self-correction. For example, in the following passage she begins with an assertion: "Querria mucho el Sefior me favoreciese para poner los efectos que obran en el alma estas cosas que ya comienzan a ser sobrenaturales, para que se entienda por los efectos cuando es espiritu de Dios" (Vida 220). However, she stops herself, realizing that in the tem- poral world-the world of words and sen- sory stimuli-nothing can be properly understood, so that se entienda is an inac- curate term: "Digo 'se entienda' conforme a lo que acai se pueda entender, aunque siempre es bien andemos con temor y recato" (Vida 221). Teresa resorts to metaphors, although she recognizes their inefficiency: "No hacia sino poner comparaciones para darme a entender, y, cierto, para esta manera de visi6n, a mi parecer, no la hay que mucho cuadre" (Vida 326). Although she laments the need for metaphors, in the absence of adequate instruments of expres- sion, she must use whatever tools are available: "Habr6 de aprovecharme de alguna comparaci6n" (Vida 192); "No hallo yo cosa con qu6 comparar[la]" (Moradas 837). She constantly distin- guishes between Truth as she is forced to describe it and Truth as she actually expe- rienced it and sometimes abandons the endeavor because accuracy is impossible. "No digo que es comparaci6n, que nunca son tan cabales, sino verdad, que hay la diferencia que va de lo vivo a lo pintado" (Vida 339). It is significant that Saint Teresa's very assertion that she is not try- ing to "institute comparisons" depends, in fact, on a comparison: the Truth is to something living as the metaphor is to something painted. Saint Teresa's effort to express the inex- pressible accounts for the profusion of metaphors that enrich her work. Christ is crystal clear water glistening in the sun (Vida 337). The mansions of Las moradas are like a heart of palm, the outer layers of which must be peeled away in order to reach the delectable core; humility is like a bee that labors in a hive; the soul is a sea urchin, a turtle, a dove, a suckling baby, a silkworm that hides in its cocoon to re- emerge as a beautiful butterfly. But ultimately, Saint Teresa's goal is not to make her readers understand the mystical experience, in spite of her stated pedagogical objectives. Steven T. Katz ex- plains that mystical pedagogy uses lan- guage in a particular way. For example, in the chants characteristic of many Ori- ental meditative techniques, "language performs an essential mystical task," ex- plains Katz, "but it is not a descriptive task" (6). That is, language is not used in this context to convey information, but to elicit a transformation in the conscious- ness of the practitioner. Negative theology refuses to ascribe any quality to the Abso- lute and therefore denies language a role in the unitive process. However, the mys- tic must have recourse to language to teach. The nonsense syllables that characterize Oriental chants, explains Katz, are literally</page><page sequence="4">744 HISPANIA 84 DECEMBER 2001 non-sense. They make no sense; they tran- scend sense and the senses. By delivering himself to the mantra, the extended repeti- tion of non-sense, the practitioner frees him- self from the logic of language and from the self: "It is the ability of language to induce 'breakthroughs' of consciousness by being employed 'nonsensically,' literally non- sense-ically, that is fundamental to the tra- versal of the mystical path, to the movement from consciousness A to consciousness B" (Katz 7). Likewise, Cabala, from which, as Catherine Swietlicki shows, Teresa may have drawn some of her imagery, induces personal transformation through the repeti- tion of divine names. By combinipg letters and words in unfamiliar ways, the Cabalist induces a kind of psychological reorienta- tion that purifies and frees the individual. The incoherent, impressionistic quality of much of Saint Teresa's prose results from the amassment of disparate and sometimes incongruous metaphors. She creates a ka- leidoscope of images that overtaxes the mind, provoking a disintegration of logical connections that in effect deconstruct all rational notions of God. Her use of paradox (for example, light-giving darkness, life-giv- ing death) serves to convey the very illogi- cality of the phenomena she describes. Her depiction of the "mystical marriage" is steeped in metaphor but goes beyond meta- phor. Drawing from numerous Biblical and other sources, Teresa likens the union be- tween God and the soul to the carnal union of man and wife because human sexuality is the experience that most closely approxi- mates the total surrender and perfect meld- ing fundamental to the mystical experience. Yet Teresa does not describe union, but rather heaps image upon image to suggest the ecstasy of lovemaking. Language used in this way annihilates rather than promotes rational thought. Several critics have commented on the spontaneity of Teresa's writing. Victor Garcia de la Concha shows how Teresa ca- sually combines diverse narrative forms and imbues her text with the energy and the unpremeditated quality of spoken language. Elias Rivers writes: "She neglected, or per- haps deliberately avoided, the normal spell- ing and syntax of the Spanish texts that she had voraciously read. She seems to have wanted to transcribe her experiences as directly as possible into the Spanish sounds and the rapid, but irregular, flow of speech that an intelligent woman would come out with spontaneously, with no thought of con- structing a well-written text. Teresa's writ- ten text is hard for us to read in a wholly ra- tional way" (121). The automatic, oral char- acter stems from the inconsistencies, rep- etitions, and exuberance of Teresa's im- ages. The author is aware of her discrepan- cies and redundancies and mentions them frequently, lamenting that she cannot go back to check her previous writing or has not the time, patience or energy to compose more carefully. However, her cluttered style-which she clearly saw as a flaw- serves the purpose of upsetting what Katz calls the "standard epistemic security of 'disciples"' (7). Thus, for Teresa, language is part of the process through which mysti- cal knowing becomes possible. John Welsh suggests that rather than searching for images to express that which defies language, Teresa actually starts out by imaging her experiences. That is, ac- cording to Welsh, Teresa does not create images, but dredges them up from deep within her psyche. Drawing on Jung, Welsh shows that Teresa's images express not only her personal unconscious, but corre- spond to symbols found in the collective unconscious. For example, the circular castle is a symbol of the self; the journey to the center of the castle represents symboli- cally the individual's penetration into her own psychological depths. Water, which is central to Teresa's imagery, is a common symbol of the unconscious, while the jour- ney represents the individuation process through which the conscious and uncon- scious are integrated. Serpents are the col- lective forces that hinder the inward jour- ney, and devils are the neglected, dark, in- ferior side of the personality that constantly threaten. If Teresa's images are jumbled and chaotic, it is because the individuation process is not orderly or predictable.</page><page sequence="5">THE APOPHATIC-KATAPHATIC DIALECTIC IN TERESA DE AVILA 745 Teresian spirituality leads to the unfathom- able reaches of the soul, a "spaceless space" where words are inadequate or even inop- erative. Individuation requires that the per- son release her grip on the senses and rea- son, the instruments with which the con- scious relates to the outer world, and yield to the call within. The person emerges from the experience with a different kind of knowledge that is neither intellectual nor fully communicable. It is precisely the fact that Teresa's personal experience coincides with the archetypal hero's expedition to the unknown-that is, the fact that she uses the images of the collective unconscious-that makes her writing accessible. The obliteration of image and word that Saint Teresa achieves, paradoxically, through the amassment of images and words responds to apophaticism's "super- essential darkness." However, this concept of spirituality gives rise to a contradic- tion with the notion, basic to Christian- ity, of divine revelation through sensa- tion. Stephen Fields explains that at the heart of the New Testament is the appear- ance of God's self-revelation in the hu- manly visible form of Christ. Through Christ, the divine (by definition, non- sensate) becomes knowable by means of evidence mediated by the senses. This dis- crepancy between apophaticism and the basic tenet of Christian theology remains an issue among theologians into the twenty-first century. It disturbed the early twentieth-century theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar, inspiring him to elaborate a non-dualist metaphysics ac- cording to which faith allows the believer to perceive the divine through sensory experience (Fields 227). Teresa clearly sensed the need to concili- ate the apophatic and kataphatic (image- driven) approaches. The issue was of spe- cial concern by the mid-sixteenth century, when Spain was becoming increasingly re- actionary and apprehensive of heterodoxy. During the early 1500s, when Osuna was writing, the Spanish monarchy and intellec- tual elite championed the devotio moderna, for Jim6nez de Cisneros' enthusiasm for the new spirituality spurred the Queen's. Cisneros encouraged the printing of the devotional works of Savonarola and Catherine of Siena, and he made Christian humanism, which embraced the devotio moderna, the intellectual core of the Univer- sity of Alcali. However, by the time Teresa began her reform, the hierarchy had become suspi- cious of apophaticism because mental prayer was associated with alumbrados and was therefore seen as a dangerous manifes- tation of spiritual autonomy. Mental prayer was especially popular among conversos, undoubtedly because it could be practiced outside churches, where New Christians may have felt uncomfortable. The daughter and granddaughter of converses, Teresa had to tread lightly. Her defense of mental prayer, her visions and locutions, and her desire to found Carmelite convents of the unmitigated rule in which mental prayer would be a primary activity made her par- ticularly suspect-so much so that her spiri- tual directors commanded her to write her Vida to prove the orthodoxy of her spiritual practices and thereby fend off the Inquisi- tion. Yet, it would be a mistake to attribute Teresa's attempt to reconcile apophatic and kataphatic spirituality solely to self-preser- vation. When the Society of Jesus founded its college at San Gil in Avila in 1554, Teresa's first Jesuit spiritual director, Diego de Cetina, introduced her to the Spiritual Exercises, which guide the "exercitant" into a state of interiority by means of reflections on scenes from the life, Passion, and Res- urrection of Christ. Through the Exercises, Teresa came to focus more insistently on the sacred humanity of Christ, and images of Christ began to play a greater part in her prayer life. In Chapter 22 of Vida Teresa defends this emphasis on the sacred humanity of Christ against the extreme apophaticists, who insist that all images impede spiri- tual progress. She begins by noting that some authors warn that the advanced state of prayer is reached only through God's in- tervention, not through human activities</page><page sequence="6">746 HISPANIA 84 DECEMBER 2001 such as meditating on particular images. For these authors, all corporeal images are obstacles to reaching the super-essential darkness that permits divine illumination: en algunos libros que estAn escritos de oraci6n tratan que, aunque el alma no puede por si Ilegar a este estado, porque es todo obra sobrenatural que el Sefior obra en ella, que podraf ayudarse levantando el espiritu de todo lo criado y subiendole con humildad, despues de muchos afios que haya ido por la vida purgativa, y aprovechando por la iluminativa...Y avisan mucho que se aparten de si toda imaginaci6n corp6rea que se alleguen a contemplar en la divinidad; porque dicen que, aunque sea la humanidad de Cristo, a los que Ilegan ya tan adelante, que embaraza u impide a la mais perfecta contemplaci6n. (Vida 283-84) These theologians believe that God must be conceived of in a general way, divorced from all concrete images: "Les parece que como esta obra toda es espiritu, que cualquier cosa corp6rea la puede estorbar u impedir; y que considerarse en cuadrada manera y que esti Dios de todas partes y verse engolfado en El, es lo que han de procurar" (Vida 284). But for Teresa, this rejection of Christ's humanity as revealed through the senses is unbearable: "apartarse del todo de Cristo y que entre en cuenta este divino cuerpo con nuestras miserias ni con todo lo criado, no lo puedo sufrir" (Vida 284). As Alison Weber and Gillian Ahlgren have established, Teresa customarily at- tacks from a position of humility in order to deflect criticism. Thus, she contradicts the apophatic spiritual authorities while assert- ing that she is not contradicting them at all: "Yo no lo contradigo, porque son letrados y espirituales, y saben lo que dicen..." (Vida 284). But, she explains, God leads souls down many paths and He has led her down one that requires images. She must rely on her own personal experience, she insists, because she knows it is valid even though it contradicts the sanctioned position. She then goes on to describe the importance that paintings, corporeal visions and imagi- native visions have played in her own spiri- tual development. If she had limited herself to practicing apophatic spirituality, she in- sists, she would not have made spiritual progress: "si me hubiera estado en ello, creo nunca hubiera llegado a lo que ahora, porque a mi parecer es engafio" (284). Saint Teresa refrains from openly asserting theo- logical views. Instead, she adopts what Joan Cammarata calls a "rhetoric of uncertainty," characterized by expressions such as pariceme, puede ser que that effectively re- duce her claims to opinions. This technique allows Teresa to avoid appearing dogmatic or even unduly knowledgeable at a period when opinionated women were considered arrogant and unseemly, and she was al- ready in a particularly vulnerable position. However, Teresa's stand against ex- treme apophaticism, which appears to be an attack on authority, is actually a gesture of accommodation, since by the mid-sixteenth century apophaticism no longer repre- sented a fully acceptable approach to spiri- tuality. Cognizant of the power of image to stimulate religious sentiment, Tridentine Catholicism counteracted Luther's strip- ping of the churches by promoting baroque art. The Church ordered artists to labor for the glory of God, stimulating an explosion of religious painting and writing. Thus, Saint Teresa, by adopting a moderate stance on apophaticism and stressing the impor- tance of image in spiritual experience, was, in effect, asserting her orthodoxy. Humans are physical beings, she ex- plains, and God speaks to us in ways we can understand, engaging our senses to com- municate even the super-sensorial. Teresa's familiarity with Ignatius's Ejercicios espirituales made her acutely aware of the effectiveness of image and imagination (that is, the mental projection of images) to spur spiritual experience. She recommends the use of icons and other sensory stimuli to beginners in prayer to initiate the process of interiorization. With the help of her Jesuit spiritual director, Teresa learned that by focusing her daily prayer on images of the Passion, she was able to immerse herself in the reality of Christ's experience-sensori- ally, mentally and spiritually-and, after a long period of dryness, pray again. Attempt- ing to reconcile the apophatic and kataphatic approaches, she points out that</page><page sequence="7">THE APOPHATIC-KATAPHATIC DIALECTIC IN TERESA DE AVILA 747 corporeal representations of Christ are not the same as other images, since the re- vealed Christ cannot be conceived of in the same way as other corporeal things. Even paintings of Christ work on the psyche so that when the image is absent, it can still be spontaneously retrieved in a way that facili- tates the acquisition of true knowledge. In other words, pictorial representations of Christ cannot be construed as distractions of the material world in the same way that other images are. Saint Teresa's apophatic writing is re- plete with "neutral" or "profane" (not reli- gious) images (moths, warriors, water, sea urchins), which take on spiritual meaning in context. The barrage of disconnected, nonreligious images is characteristic of her apophatic expression, in which the function of images is to dissociate the spiritual ex- perience from the intellective processes. However, Teresa also uses traditional im- ages of God (the King, the Father, the nurs- ing Mother), Christ, and even the Devil, some of which she identifies as having been inspired by paintings. These images, gen- erated by religious literature and art, are characteristic of her kataphatic expression. In either case, the image is not an end in itself, but a means of transmitting a pro- foundly unique spiritual experience that transcends all ordinary human perception and understanding. When Saint Teresa describes visions, she sometimes specifies that the imagery they involve is reminiscent of paintings: "Un dia de San Pablo, estando en misa, se me represent6 toda esta Humanidad sacratisima como se pinta resucitado" (Vida 336). Evelyn Underhill, an early twentieth- century mystic, explains that "the spiritual genius commonly translates his intense in- tuition of the transcendent into form with which the surface mind can deal" (80). Thus, the mind renders illuminative expe- rience in images familiar to the individual, for example, works of art. However, kataphatic spirituality leads from the image to an overwhelming sense of more. This sense of more and the individual's union with it, not mental projection of the image itself, is the mystical experience (James 421-27). Saint Teresa reiterates repeatedly that although she uses language to describe visions that is akin to that used to describe paintings, what she strives to represent in words is actually much "more" than a ma- terial image: "Bien me parecia en algunas cosas que era imagen lo que via, mas por otras muchas no, sino que era el mesmo Cristo...Unas veces era tan en confuso, que me parecia imagen, no como los debujos de ac~, por muy perfetos que sean...; es disbarate pensar que tiene semejanza lo uno con lo otro en ninguna manera..." (Vida 338-39). Saint Teresa distinguishes three types of visions: visiones corp6reas, images distin- guished with the eyes; visiones imaginarias, images seen in the mind or fantasy; and visiones intelectuales, images perceived, but not with the eyes. Most of the visions that she describes are "intellectual"; that is, even when they involve graphic representations, they transcend the material to the degree that they are not actually perceived senso- rially. For example, in Chapter 27 of Vida, she describes an intellectual vision of Christ at her side: "...vi cabe mi, u senti, por mijor decir, que con los ojos del cuerpo ni del alma no vi nada, mas pareci6me estaba junto cabe mi Cristo y via ser El el que me hablaba, a mi parecer" (Vida 325). Teresa insists on the incorporeal, insensate nature of this vision, on its very more-ness, so to speak. "Pareciame andar siempre al lado Jesucristo; y como no era visi6n imaginaria, no via en qu6 forma; mas estar siempre al lado derecho, sentialo muy claro" (Vida 325). She "sees" with the spiritual, not with the physical senses. Pictorial representa- tions of Christ have served as a conduit through which she is able to give form to that which transcends form. The paths of apophatic and kataphatic spirituality have converged, leading her to the same end. The apophatic-kataphatic dialectic inher- ent in Saint Teresa's writing creates an ex- quisite tension. While superficially in conflict, the two approaches actually complement each other, each generating distinctive kinds of images that enrich and</page><page sequence="8">748 HISPANIA 84 DECEMBER 2001 intensify Teresa's prose. Both lead to in- tense interiority. Both lead to the notion of an ineffable, indefinable God-the apophatic by obliterating all anthropo- morphic comparisons, the kataphatic by defining God as more than our ability to conceive. And yet, although Saint Teresa avails herself of both, she seems reluctant to identify herself exclusively with either. Within the last few years, theolo- gians have undertaken a re- evaluation of the relationship between apophatic and kataphatic spiritu- ality. Rather than in opposition to one an- other, they are viewed as "different facets of the same religious experience" (Dreyer 1217). Saint Teresa knew this instinc- tively four hundred years before doctors of the Church articulated the official posi- tion. 0 WORKS CITED Ahlgren, Gillian.
