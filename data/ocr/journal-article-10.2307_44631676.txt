Steve Peirce National Highway Traffic Safety Administration A SERIES OF EIGHT van crash tests was conducted by Dynamic Science under Contract No. DOT-HS- 8-01942 (Task Order No. 4), "Van Crashworthiness and Aggressivity Study/ sponsored by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). This paper presents the results of six symmetric, head-on van-to-NHTSA Fixed Test Device crash tests and two van-to-car collisions (1, 2, 3).# These tests were conducted to: 1) study the crashworthiness and aggressivity of vans; 2) provide baseline van collision data to support extension of FMVSS 208, Occupant Crash Protection, to vans; and 3) support current vehicle standards and provide initial information for the future FMVSS 400 series standards. TEST SCOPE The test matrix and summary of test conditions for the eight van crash tests are presented in Table 1. Two representative van models (a 1979 Ford Econoline 150 and a 1979 Dodge B-200) were used in the series. These vans are shown in Figures 1 and 2. The first six van tests were conducted against a unique load-measuring barrier, the NHTSA Fixed Test Device. Impact speeds were selected as 15, 25, and 30 mph. The last two tests were van-to-car front-to-front collisions using a typical full-size passenger car (1979 Chevrolet Impala). This vehicle is illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 in relation to the two van models. Closing velocities of 64.0 mph for the Ford Van-to-Chevrolet test and 61.7 mph for the Dodge Van-to-Chevrolet were chosen so that a velocity change of 30 mph would occur on the van (see Appendix A). The NHTSA Fixed Test Device (4) is a unique seg- mented load-measuring barrier which was supported by a 36-inch extension attached to the Dynamic Sci- ence fixed barrier. The front face of each of the 40 load-measuring modules used a 7 x 8 x 1-1/2-inch plywood face as the impact surface (Figure 5). The frontal height was set to simulate the front of a Chevrolet Impala (Figure 6). In each test, the van contained two instru- mented Alderson Part 572, 50th percentile male #N umbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. ABSTRACT - - This paper presents the results of a series of van crash tests which were conducted by Dynamic Sci- ence, Inc. under contract to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Six van tests were conducted against a unique load-measuring barrier to study the crashworthiness and aggressivity of two typical van models at speeds of 15, 25, and 30 mph. Two additional tests were conducted be- tween each of the two van models and a typical full- size passenger car. The results of these tests are being used by NHTSA to support extension of Feder- al Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 208 to vans, and to provide initial information for the future FMVSS 400 series standards. The views and opinions presented in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily re- flect the official view of the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 369 0096-736X/82/9001 -0369$02.50 Copyright 1982 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">370 s.

Each occupant was restrained with the vehicle's production restraint system; however, the Dodge Van's standard, two- point restraint system was replaced by the optional production, three-point restraint system. The seats were put at midposition, but not welded in place. Vehicles which contained tilt steering wheels (see Table 1) were tested with the wheel placed in the lowermost driving position, in order to evaluate a more vertical position, typical of passenger cars. Fuel was removed from the vans and replaced with water.

PEIRCE PHOTOGRAPHIC INSTRUMENTATION In all tests, seven high-speed cameras (five 1000 fps and two 500 fps) and one panning camera (24 fps) were used to cover the crash event. Two of the cameras were mounted on board the van to ob- serve occupant kinematics. In addition to high- speed cameras, black-and-white photographs and color slides were taken to record pre-test and post-test vehicle and dummy positions.

The methodol- ogy used to study these effects was to plot various vehicle and occupant response parameters against the actual test speeds. Occupant response param- eters were also plotted against selected vehicle response parameters. OCCUPANT RESPONSE PARAMETERS VERSUS IM- PACT VELOCITY - The pertinent occupant response data are presented in Table 4 for critical response parameters as defined in FMVSS 208. The peak chest acceleration, excluding intervals whose cumu- lative duration is not more than 3 milliseconds, is the current FMVSS 208 chest criteria; the chest Sever- ity Index (SI) data are also presented since these criteria were used previously in FMVSS 208. Head Injury Criteria (HIC) is as defined in FMVSS 208, with an allowable limit of 1000. Figures 7 and 8 indicate that this parameter was well within the 1000 limit value at 25 mph, but slightly exceeded 1000 at 30 mph for the Dodge driver and the Ford passenger. Chest SI and Peak Chest Resultant deceleration data are shown in Figures 9 through 12. At 25 mph, these chest parameters were well within the established limit of 1000 for the SI and 60 g for the Chest Resultant deceleration. Although the SI values at 30 mph were well below 1000 in both vans, the chest g for the Ford driver slightly exceeded the allowable 60 g limit. Femur load criteria are as defined in FMVSS 208, with an allowable compression limit of 2,250 pounds. Figures 13 through 16 indicate that this parameter tends to increase with impact speed, but several values at 30 mph are less than 25 mph. The maximum femur load occurred at 25 mph for the Dodge driver left femur and the Ford driver right femur. These values, as well as the value for the Dodge driver right femur at 30 mph, exceeded the 2,250-pound limit specified in FMVSS 208. In summary, several dummy response param- eters exceeded FMVSS 208 limits at 30 mph, and femur load limits were exceeded even at 25 mph. Improved restraint systems might help to reduce excessive occupant femur and head response values and thereby improve the crashworthiness of the vehicles.

Dynamic crush from accelerometer integration and film analysis are shown in Figures 17 and 18. Post-test static crush data are shown in Figure 19. As expected, the crush increases with impact speed, and both vans indicate similar crush versus speed curves. It should be noted, however, that the maximum dynamic crush at 30 mph is about 20 inches, compared to dynamic crushes of 30 inches for typical full-size passenger cars. Since increased crush (within acceptable compartment intrusion lim- its) tends to reduce the occupant injury severity of a crash in both the struck and striking vehicles, structural modifications to increase the 30-mph 1200 1 о DODGE VAN/BARRIER ° + FORD VAN/BARRIER ~ LIMIT = 1000 ?

Van velocity change versus impact speed is shown in Figure 20. For a perfectly plastic collision (coefficient of restitution = 0), there would be no rebound velocity, and the vehicle velocity change (AV) would equal the initial impact speed. This is illustrated by the dashed line. In actuality, return of some crush energy is inevitable, but this should be kept small to minimize the velocity change of the vehicle's occupants. As shown in Figure 20, the data for the Ford and Dodge vans are comparable and close -to the perfectly plastic collision line.

DAVIS AND S. PEIRCE The coefficient of restitution is about 0.1, which is representative of data for full-size passenger cars. Compartment acceleration is a vehicle parameter that can affect van crashworthiness through its ef- fect on occupant response. The peak acceleration data are plotted in Figure 21. The peak compart- ment accelerations for the Dodge were generally higher than for the Ford. The actual time histories of compartment acceleration for the 30-mph barrier tests are shown in Figures 22 and 23, where it can be noted that the Dodge peak occurs early in the pulse and is of relatively short duration. The significance of maximum compartment de- celeration on vehicle crashworthiness is contro- versial since the peak value depends on the filter used (in these tests, a class 60 filter, as recom- mended in SAE J 211b).

These data are plotted in Figure 24 and show no significant differences between van models over the test speed range. Engine inertia forces may possibly increase the aggressivity of a vehicle by generating high interface loads. The' van acceleration data are shown in Fig- ure 25, where it can be observed that the Dodge engine experienced higher peak accelerations than the Ford engine.

Bottoming out of some of the load cells can occur under ex- ceptionally severe loading conditions. Several ap- proaches to improve the fidelity of the load- measuring subsystem are currently under considera- tion at NHTSA. Integration of the barrier force versus time curves in Figures 28 and 29 yield im- pulse values which are 86 and 85 percent (for the Ford and Dodge tests respectively), of the momen- tum change values using vehicle mass and velocity change (7323 lb-sec for the Ford, and 6990 lb-sec for the Dodge). OCCUPANT RESPONSE PARAMETERS VERSUS VE- HICLE PARAMETERS - Selected occupant response parameters in Table 4 were cross plotted against vehicle velocity change (Figure 34) and against average compartment acceleration (Figure 35) ob- tained from Table 5. These figures illustrate a somewhat greater upward trend for velocity change than for average compartment acceleration. POST-TEST EXAMINATION - Figures 36 and 37 permit a visual comparison of the exterior crush and damage patterns for the Ford and Dodge vans dur- ing each of the barrier tests. Additional views of the vans after the 30-mph barrier tests are included as Figures 38 and 39. Figures 40 and 41 permit visual examination of the interior deformation of the driver and front pas- senger compartment areas. These figures show con- siderable steering wheel upward displacement, even at 25 mph, for both vans. TEST RESULTS FOR CAR-TO-VAN COLLISIONS Since the vans impacted identical full-size cars (Chevrolet Impalas), the relative crashworthiness of the vans could be assessed by comparing the occu- pant responses in the two vans. In addition, the relative aggressivity of the vans could be assessed by comparing the structural and occupant responses in the struck cars. It must be remembered that the closing speed for Ford Test 7 (63.6 mph) was slightly higher than for Dodge Test 8 (62.3 mph), in order to obtain the same velocity change (AV) on the van as in a 30- mph barrier test. OCCUPANT RESPONSE PARAMETERS - The perti- nent occupant response data are presented in Table 6 for critical response parameters as defined in FMVSS 208.

It can be noted that the Ford velocity change for the Ford-to-car test is a little higher than for the "equivalent" barrier test, while the Dodge velocity change for the Dodge-to-car test is a little lower than for the barrier test. This occurred even though the test speed tolerance window (±0.5 mph) resulted in a slightly lower (63.6 mph versus 64.1 mph) closing speed for the Ford-to-car test, and a slightly higher (62.3 mph versus 61.7 mph) closing speed for the Dodge-to-car test. This velocity change data may indicate slightly different coef- ficients of restitution in the van-to-car tests, or may merely reflect accuracy limits inherent in deter- mining vehicle velocity change from test data. The data for the van-to-car tests appear to be compatible with the previous barrier test data; how- ever, the HIC data for the Dodge appears somewhat higher, and for the Ford somewhat lower, than would be expected from the barrier tests. In fact, the HIC values obtained in the van-to-car tests have reversed the relative injury levels in the two vehicles found during the barrier tests. Although the data from one test are not conclusive, they do point out that different conclusions regarding the relative crashworthiness of vehicles may be obtained from vehicle-to-barrier or vehicle-to-vehicle tests. The available dummy data (Tables 4 and 6) were normalized by dividing the data by the appropriate limits in FMVSS 208 (i.e., 1000 for HIC, 1000 for Chest SI, 60 g for Chest g, and 2,250 pounds for femur loads). These normalized data for the Dodge and Ford dummies are cross plotted in Figure 44 to assess van crashworthiness. The normalized data for the Chevrolet dummies in the Dodge and Ford tests are cross plotted in Figure 45 to assess van aggressivity. The Equal Severity Line (ESL) in Figures 44 and 45 provides a natural boundary for assessing which test produces more severe dummy responses. For example, Figure 44 indicates a scatter of the data about the ESL with one HIC (О) appreciably above the line and one right femur (AR) appreciably below the line. Thus, it appears that there is no strong difference in the crashworthiness of the two van models. On the other hand, Figure 45 indicates almost all of the data is above the ESL, except for one or two femur loads (aR, a L). Although no statistically valid conclusions can be drawn from only one test per vehicle, these data suggest that the Dodge van may be more aggressive than the Ford.

DAVIS AND S. PEIRCE VEHICLE RESPONSE PARAMETERS - The perti- nent vehicle response parameters are presented in Table 7. These include similar structural parameters as used in the barrier test analysis (Table 5). However, the vehicle-to-vehicle tests required some differences in presentation. For example, the closing velocity is the important test condition rather than the velocity of the van (i.e., a closing speed of 63.6 mph could have been attained with the van stationary and the car traveling at 63.6 mph, or with both vehicles moving at equal and opposite speeds of 31.8 mph as in Test 7). Some parameters, such as vehicle dynamic crush from film or accelerometer data, are difficult to obtain in vehicle-to-vehicle tests, because the interface between the two vehicles is poorly defined during the crash. Thus, Table 7 presents maximum mutual dynamic crush rather than van and car data separately. This data indicates about the same crush distance for Tests 7 and 8. The individual maximum static (post-test) crush is determinable and is included in Table 7. These data indicate that the Dodge van crushed more and the corresponding Chevrolet car crushed less than for the Ford collision. These data suggest that the Dodge van is less crashworthy, and the Ford van is more aggressive; these conclusions are not consis- tent with the dummy response data (Figures 44 and 45) which indicated no significant difference in van crashworthiness, and that the Dodge was more ag- gressive than the Ford. Thus, the dummy and vehicle crush responses in these tests lead to op- posite conclusions regarding the relative crash- worthiness and aggressivity of the two vehicles. Figure 46 shows the bumper match and interface for the vans with the Chevrolet; we can see that the Ford bumper does not overlap the Chevrolet as much, and would tend to override more easily. Thus, differences could be expected in crush pat- terns during Tests 7 and 8. Figure 47 presents the post-test crush profiles for the vans and the Chevrolets. Although the van crush profiles are similar, major differences can be seen in the Chevrolet crush profiles. The collision with the Ford resulted in maximum crush between bumper and hood level and at hood level, while the maximum crush for the Dodge test occurred at bumper level. Since vehicle structural aggressivity is composed of two inseparable factors - the geometry and the stiff- ness of the structure - it is difficult to assess the aggressivity of the vans only from the stiffness data obtained in these two tests. The effect of the frontal geometrical differences may be as significant to the struck vehicle dummy and structural re- sponses as is the effect of differences in structural stiffness of the two vans. Figure 48 compares the van post-test crush pro- files from the 30-mph barrier tests with the car-to- van tests. Although the data appear to show good correlation, the vans crushed somewhat more in the barrier test than in the car-to-van tests. Some differences in crush profile are also observable. These data reflect the fact that structural responses in a fixed rigid barrier test differ from responses with real-world, non-rigid vehicles. Occupants in larger vehicles generally fare better than small car occupants in vehicle-to-vehicle collisions than is in- dicated during 30-mph fixed barrier tests. Figure 49 compares the car interior intrusion pro- files for the Chevrolets in Tests 7 and 8. There is little difference in the maximum intrusion (3 to 7 inches), but the intrusion pattern is obviously dif- ferent. For example, at bumper level, the maximum car intrusion by the Dodge occurred closer to the center of the car. At knee and dash level, the maximum intrusion occurred on the car's right side for the Dodge test and on the car's left side for the Ford test. Again, the question of repeatability of test results precludes drawing firm conclusions on the significance of these intrusion differences. Figure 50 shows the vehicle compartment acceler- ations, velocities, and displacements for the vans and the Chevrolet in Tests 7 and 8. The car acceler- ation response data, as well as the derived velocity and displacement data, for the two tests are rather similar. Although the van acceleration data show significant differences in peak values, the derived velocity and displacement data are comparable. The differences in velocity data are partly due to the difference in initial closing speed, and the mass ratio of the van/car.

The van dummy data for the eight tests, when normalized and cross plotted, indicated no strong difference in the crashworthiness of the two vans* However, the Chevrolet dummy data from the two van-to-car tests suggested that the Dodge van may be more aggressive than the Ford. The use of some structural response parameters (such as maximum post-test crush) may suggest ag- gressivity conclusions contrary to the results ob- tained from an assessment of the dummy response parameters. FUTURE RESEARCH EFFORTS Data from these initial van crashworthiness and aggressivity tests were instrumental in the selection of the Ford Econoline Van in the "Passive Restraints Development of Light Trucks and Vans," Contract No. DOT -HS-9-02076. Early passive restraint tests of the Ford van indicate potential problems in achieving acceptable occupant protection perform- ance levels, especially with an out-of-position child. To provide the Ford van occupants with a safer crash environment, the contract "Van 208 Exten- sion," Contract No. DTNH22-80-C -07179 was awarded to modify the Ford van structure. The new structure will employ controlled energy-absorbing deformation features that will lengthen the crash pulse duration, and lower the maximum vehicle ac- celerations. REFERENCES 1. R. Yee, R.

APPENDIX A - SELECTION OF CLOSING SPEEDS FOR CAR-TO-VAN TESTS The equivalent car-to-van closing speed (V^) computed from a van-to-Fixed Barrier closing speed (Vp) with van weight (Wy) and car weight (W^) is given by: Vw*VfTw"C.w + T1 L*c + wvj (1) This formula is derivable from conservation of linear momentum, for a perfectly plastic collision. For the specific parameters associated with the Dodge Van, Ford Van, and Chevrolet Impala, Table A-1 summarizes the pertinent data. It should be noted that Equation (1) is derived on the basis of equal velocity change for the van. This does not result in equal velocity change to the car in the two car-to-van tests, since the weights of the vans differ. The heavier van (Dodge) results in a higher velocity change for the car. It should also be noted that the closing speed derived from Equation (1) does not result in equal energy absorption in the van, as in the van barrier test. The vans generally crushed less in the car-to- van collisions than in the 30-mph van-to-Fixed Bar- rier crash.
