Readers of this study, however, should not be too ready to put it aside on the grounds that it highlights difficulties in achieving a clear grasp of what Spinoza puts forward, rather than offering an undemanding presentation of his thought about God. While the book is intended 'for the many was well as for the few', those who are more interested in religion than in philosophy might be tempted to consider following Mason's suggestion in his Preface that they begin by reading Parts 2 and 3 before turning to the treatment in Part 1 of 'the God of the philosophers'. This is because the first part is 'more philosophically technical, because the logical and metaphysical machinery requires close attention if the force of Spinoza's case is to be appreciated' (xi). Unfortunately those who do try to start with Part 2 will find that what is said there about Spinoza's views on God depends to a significant extent on what has been discussed in Part 1. It would be a pity, however, if the difficulties of the first part of the study (where Mason's analysis warrants the conclusion that Spinoza's position is much less simple and clear than it may appear) restrained those interested in the thought of this 'God-intoxicated man' (as Novalis describes him) from benefiting from Mason's extensive and penetrating investigations. This study is true to its title. Its attention is focused on Spinoza's views on God and religion. His opinions on politics, moral philosophy and philosophy of mind only appear where they are relevant to those views. The treatment of those views, furthermore, is based on the assumption that whereas the Ethics gives Spinoza's completed philosophical outlook' (16), his Theological-Political Treatise and cor respondence provides most of the evidence needed to establish his religious pos ition. A convincing interpretation of that position needs, however, to bear in mind the setting in which it developed. This poses a major problem, because Spinoza's work has a complex background. Mason identifies a dozen factors that contribute to the 'richness and multiplicity of its contexts' (1). They range from the tangled character of his Jewish heritage and his relationship towards it, to his situation in</page><page sequence="2">232 Book reviews the United Provinces, current thought in the natural sciences, and philosophical influences upon him. In Part 1, 'The God of the philosophers', Mason considers what views Spinoza holds about the existence and activity of God, the relationship between God and the world, and the relationship between theistic belief and Cartesian doubt. He points out that, whatever may have been Spinoza's practice, he did not consider that it was possible to separate the reality of God from religion. Behind Spinoza's occasional use of the notorious, and often quoted and widely misunderstood, phrase 'Deus, sive Natura' lies the Latinized vocabulary of Aristotle found in scholastic terminology and now compressed into a 'dense core'. At its centre 'God, substance and nature are brought into complete equivalence' (25). On the one hand, a radical understanding of God's infinity means that 'God stands in a relation of causality or explanation' to whatever is the case. On the other hand, since nothing can be external to nature (for nature is what exists), the reason for existence and action must be found within it. The result is that 'God becomes naturalised' and 'nature becomes divine' (113). The existence and activity of God or Nature, however, are necessary (cf. 251). Anthropomorphic notions of God as personally free to determine the laws, and notions of natural events as contingent (except in the sense that each event is the product of an endless chain of causes that cannot be fully grasped) are fundamentally mistaken. The result is a complex, dense, and sometimes puzzling understanding of the reality of the divine that needs a great deal of unpacking, even though Spinoza himself considers that the existence and nature of God are clear and 'known to all' (89). Mason engages in this task with careful and penetrating sensitivity. In Part 2, 'The God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob', the discussion becomes less philosophically demanding as it moves from the Ethics to the Theological Political Treatise and considers notions of final causality, hope and fear, the mean ing of revelation, and history. Part 3, 'The God of Spinoza', then takes up such topics as Spinoza's views on 'choosing a religion' and on religious freedom, his use of the figure of Christ, and his thoughts about eternity. Here Mason expounds and probes Spinoza's views on how religion began, developed and is practised as a constituent element in 'social and historical reality' (138). He points out that while 'moral authority, for Spinoza, was natural authority, which was divine auth ority' (182), underlying his views is the conviction, as implied above, that 'purpose, destination or significance' according to some teleological plan of providence are not be ascribed to events (120). What happens and what will happen is the result of what has already happened. One implication of this is that no notion of 'the aims or purposes of human life or history' can be 'correct, because human life or history has no aims or purposes' (135). Behaviour may be the result of certain appetites but these are to be explained as the product of prior states, not as justifiable by reference to ends. Theological beliefs, furthermore, have little affect on conduct. Indeed, 'if to be religious is to live well', the most propitious way to</page><page sequence="3">Book reviews 233 achieve it is 'to be brought up in favourable surroundings' (137). In the final analysis, the reason why people are religious is because that is how they are. There is no other explanation. Nevertheless, in a somewhat puzzling fashion, Spinoza maintains that the role of revelation and prophets is to seek 'to reinforce social solidarity and morality in ways that will be intelligible in their place and time' (158). It is 'puzzling' because, as Mason puts it, Spinoza talks of God as revealing this or that when 'the God of the Ethics could not reveal anything to anyone' (169) since God's actions are the necessary acts of what ultimately is. It is also puzzling because it is not clear what freedom and responsibility can coherently be ascribed to human beings. According to Spinoza, 'that human freedom which all men boast of possessing... consists solely in this, that men are conscious of their desire, and unaware of the causes by which they are determined' (127). Again, when Spinoza talks of the Jews being 'chosen' (cf. 177), it must be remembered that 'God's choosing to do something is the same as something's happening in accordance with law, which is the same as something just happening' (179) - which leaves the notion of God's 'choice' enigmatic, if not empty, and very different from what is usually understood by the term, namely as the conscious and free decision of a personally-structured being. Mason's study closes with an assessment of Spinoza's significance in which it is argued that the study of his thought shows, contrary to widespread views, that he was not 'a religious rationalist' nor 'a precursor to eighteenth-century Enlight enment deism' (247ff.). Although interpretation of his works is hindered by the fact that 'we do not know why Spinoza wrote what he did' (229), he presents a radical immanentism according to which 'necessity was identified with nature' and the notion of God referred to the laws by which things happen (251). At the same time, he did not seek to present a completely reductionist view of religion and theology but to develop a careful balance, whereby the rationalist interpret ation is countered by a religious sensibility, according to which nature is divine and God is seen in history and grasped in the experience of eternity. Spinoza's thought about God offers a rich, complex, and sometimes baffling set of ideas. Richard Mason is to be complimented on clarifying its richness, diversity, and religious, as well as rational, challenge. DAVID A. PAIUN University of Manchester</page></plain_text>
