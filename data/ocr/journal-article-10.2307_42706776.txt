<plain_text><page sequence="1">36 The Story oř David and Goliath: A Folk Epic? * 0. Introduction An analysis of the Biblical story of David and Goliath (1 Sam 17) in ethnopoetic terms is presented here. This is a first attempt to analyse a Biblical story in these terms, with all the limitations entailed in such an attempt. Not ]peing a Biblical scholar, but a folklorist, I am the more aware of these limitations. We will examine the story from the following aspects: (a) nar- rative syntax: texture, plot structure, formulaic number; (b) nar- rative semantics: repertoire of the contentual terms (anthropomor- phic, zoomorphic, and object-like), and the dimensions of time and space. On the basis of our examination of these aspects, we will try to determine whether or not to consider our text as stemming from oral literature, and if so, to which genre does it belong; and further, how does this fact contribute to our understanding of the Biblical text. Two genres of oral literature may serve as models for our story: the heroic fairy tale and the romantic epic. The analytic tools used for this text are taken from Jason (*). 1. Narrative Syntax The narrative syntax has two levels: texture, that is, the lit- erary-prosodic organization of the linguistic material, and plot structure, which, in principle, does not depend on the linguistic material. The third component of the syntax is the formulaic num- ber, which is operative on both levels. * Translated from Hebrew by Sara Mishan. (*) H. Jason, Ethnopoetry : Form , Content , Function (1977).</page><page sequence="2">The Story of David and Goliath: A Folk Epic? 37 1.1 The texture It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine today the literary form of the original texture of the works included in the Bible: wheth- er it was set in verse, prose, or prose mingled with verse. Therefore, the discussion on this level serves not to determine the prosodie form of the original composition, but rather to assure the presentation of a complete and well-rounded analysis. 1.1.1 Verse or prose? The Biblical text of our story, in its present form, appears to be composed of two kinds of passages: those in which the Vorlage is given in great detail, and those in which this Vorlage is summarized with utmost brevity. From these two kinds of passages, the Biblical scribe constructed a complete, new com- position in which every element has its organic place. We may divide our text in the following manner (a full analysis of the text in which its passages are classified according to the con- cepts discussed in the present paper, is given in the Appendix, sec- tion 4.2): Table 1: Division of the text into fuller and condensed passages (a) Presentation of the (b) Presentation of the supposed original supposed original text in a fuller form text in great brevity verses 1-13 verses 14-16 verses 17-18 verse 19 verses 20-22 verse 23 verses 24-26 verse 27 verses 28-29 verses 30-31 verses 32-5 la verse 51b verses 52-53 verse 54(?) verses 55-58 It seems to me that the passages in which the events are related in detail transmit the text more or less in full, whereas the summarized passages simply repeat, in brief, that which has already been stated in detail (for example, the speech of Goliath in verse 23) . Repetitions of speeches and events in full, in the same or similar wording, are among the prominent characteristics of the epic in verse. Such rep-</page><page sequence="3">38 H. Jason etitions are apparently not common in epic, set in prose, although it must be added that the latter has received only scant study (2). 1.1.2 Parallelism. The presence of parallelism (3) in a particular poem is important evidence for classifying it as oral poetry. The Biblical text, in its present form, is in prose; this is indisputable. Parallelism has so far not been discovered in prose epic. And indeed, parallelism is essential to the improviser of oral works in verse; not so to the improviser of oral prose narrative. The fact that it is cus- tomary to sing texts in prose in the same manner as texts in verse, is not of relevance here (4). Yet, in our short text, although in prose, we find two relatively clear instances of parallelism: verse 1: (a) and they were gathered at Socoh, which belongs to Judah (b) and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes- Dammim. verse 52: (a) and pursued the Philistines as far as Gai and the gates of Ekron (b) so that the wounded Philistines fell on the way from Sha'araim as far as Gath and Ekron. In the Septuagint, the parallelism here is even more striking: instead of "gai, in," in verse 52a, one finds here "Gath, D3T. Less evident instances of parallelism, in which an additional passage divides the two parallel parts, are given in the following list: verse 8: (a) Choose a man for ''Vk ITI BPK DD1? Tía yourselves and let him come down to me verse 10: (b) Give me a man, TrP n&amp;nbll BPH that we may fight together (2) A. B. Lord, The Singer of Tales (1960). (3) "Parallelism" here refers to parallelism in oral poetry in gen- eral; parallelism in Biblical lyric poetry is an individual case of the phenomenon. About parallelism in oral poetry in general see Lord, op. cit. chapter 3. (4) Examples of sung epic prose are the Arabic Sirat Antar and the African epic of Mvindo, published by D. Biebuyck and K. C. Ma- TEENE, The Mvindo Epic from the Banyanga (Congo Republic 1971).</page><page sequence="4">The Story of David and Goliath: A Folk Epic? 39 verse 13: (a) And the three el- DETTITI T'vbv "oVn dest sons of Jesse [had gone] (b) they followed Saul TVSTÒtoh hMW nnK 1 to the battle verse 14: (c) the three eldest -VlKP nmc DETTITI TWÒW followed Saul. Even if we assume, as does Ehrlich (p. 226) (5) that "had gone 'oVn" in verse 13 is superfluous, we still retain the parallelism: verse 13: (a) And the three el- "»BP "»n ntPlbtf 'Ox?r' dest sons of Jesse D^TTIH followed Saul to Hön1?»1? the battle verse 14: (b) the three eldest DETTITI nwiVttn followed Saul. nn« As the text before us is a prose one, there is no case here of a prosodie matching between the two parallel parts. A limited presence of parallelism and of suggested repetitions (in condensed form - column b in Table 1) in a particular composi- tion may signify that the original text of the said composition, or at least part of it, was coached in a versed prosodie form. However, this says nothing about the other epic compositions which have been preserved in various forms in the Bible. The Song of Deborah and the Lamentations of David, for instance, both of which belong to the "epic period" (see below, section 2.4), are classic examples of lyric song; as such, they have nothing to do with the question of the prosodie form of the epic in the Biblical period. A discussion of the concept of the formula, as developed by Lord (6), will not be undertaken here. Such a discussion should nec- essarily be based on a representative sample of the epic in its original texture in a particular culture, and is therefore beyond the framework of a single, short text. 1.1.3 The epithet. One of the most important attributes of the texture of the epic is the large number of epithets used to describe its contentual terms. Epithets are not essential to the texture of (6) A. B. Ehruch, Randglossen zur hebräischen Bibel, 3. (1910). (6) I/ORD, op. cit., chapter 3.</page><page sequence="5">40 H. Jason the heroic fairy tale. The epic style, however, may influence other genres of oral literature in cultures having a strong epic tradition, and thus many epithets may appear in the heroic fairy tale as well (as in the Russian fairy tale, for example). Several sequences in our text may be interpreted as quasi- epithets. A comprehensive study of the repertoire of Biblical epics will reveal which sequences may be percieved as epithets, and which are chance word combinations or formulas of some other kind. Fol- lowing is a list of sequences taken from the text: verse 23: "Goliath the Philistine"; in other places, only the title, "the Philistine", is used, verse 42: David(. . .) was but a youth, ruddy and comely in appear- ance. Recall verse 12 of chapter 16: "Now he was ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome", verse 44: (...) to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the field, verse 46: (. . .)to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth( . . . ) verses 26, 36: (...) the armies of the living God. verse 45: (...) the Lord of hosts, the God of the living Israel (...) 1.2 Plot level Several models and methods of analysis of plot structure have been suggested by various scholars. The models of Propp (7) for the heroic fairy tale, and of Skaftymov (8) for a certain kind of Rus- sian national epic, seem most appropiate for the analysis of our text. A third possibility is to divide the text into episodes, based on the movements of the characters within the spatial pattern of the story (see section 2.5.3.1, below). Each method sheds light on the story from a different angle. The common features of the models of Propp and Skaftymov are as follows: (a) their generality: both models perceive the story in gen- eral lines, rather than dealing separately with every aspect of the narrative syntax. (7) VI. Ja. Propp, Morphology of the Folktale (21968). (8) A. Skaftymov, Poetika i genesis bylin [Poetics and origin of Russian epic songs] (1924). See description of Skaftymov's model in H. Jason, « Precursors of Propp: Formalist Theories of Narrative in Early Russian Ethnopoetics », PTL, Journal of Poetics and Theory of Literature 3 (1977) 471-516.</page><page sequence="6">The Story of David and Goliath: A Folk Epic? 41 (b) the basic theoretical concepts of both models are: (ba) narrative role; (bb) narrative action, which the role performs. Those are the abstract units. On the concrete plane, the narrative character functions in the narrative role and performs a concrete deed, which is the realization of the abstract narrative action. (c) Both models constitute a narrative "surface structure" on different planes (problems of "surface structure" and "deep struc- ture" are discussed by Jason (9)). 1.2.1. Analysis according to Propp's Model (See Table 2) Remarks concerning Table 2: (a) The specific components of the function are given here, after Jason's model (10): narrative subject /narrative action / narrative object (b) David's brothers play the role of the unsuccessful brothers of the fairy-tale hero, who try to accomplish the mission before he does. They act in a separate move (move 1) which comes before the principal move of the story (move 2). In the fairy tale, these brothers (2.1) either do not even reach a confrontation with the villain, or else (2.2) are de- feated by him. The brothers are generally two in number, hence the for- mula based on the formulaic number "3": 2 + 1 = 3 (see section 1.3); three brothers function in our text, and thus the formula here is "3 + 1". In the fairy tale, the brothers may leave home in one of two ways: (2.3): Each brother leaves separately according to age, so that the hero, being the youngest, is last in line, or (2.4): All the brothers, including the hero, leave together, and later part ways at a crossroads. The hero turns to a road fraught with danger (on which he meets victory), while his broth- ers turn to roads promissing success (on which they suffer failure). In our text, David's brothers act as a "group hero", a single char- acter, and thus they leave home together. Only the eldest brother re- ally plays a part in the story. The brothers' departure takes place before that of the hero (case 2.3), who is the youngest brother, and it ends in failure; they do not even reach a confrontation with the villain (case 2.1). (c) The hero's father is the dispatcher. As is usually the case in the fairy tale, the father dispatches the hero to fetch something (in the fairy tale, to bring something to the father; in our text, the direction of bringing is reversed); the hero wins the hand of the princess while carrying out the task assigned him by his father. In our text, Jesse sends David to bring provisions to his brothers, and by so doing, David eventually defeats the villain and wins the hand of the princess (I Sam 18,20-28).

Jason The second dispatcher, who reports of the villainy to the hero (in this case, the villainy is the enemy attack; in the fairy tale, it is the dragon's demand to be given the king's daughter), is "the people", just as in the heroic fairy tale. In the latter, the inhabitants of the marvelous city report to the entering hero the villainy and the offer of the king's daughter to the victor over the villain-dragon. (d) Why do not Saul and Jonathan, grownups and "knowledge- able in war", go out against Goliath themselves? Within the framework of the heroic fairy tale, their going out to battle is not possible. The king, his retinue, and his country constitute the "other", the marvelous world, which is not capable of confronting the marvelous villain. Only the young man coming from another place (world) is able to confront him. Thus, David cannot belong to the king's court at the time that he is battling Goliath (n). Saul offers his daughter to the man who defeats Goliath. It is not stated which one of his two daughters is offered (we hear only of two daughters: 1 Sam 18,17.20). The vagueness here is in keeping with the situation in the heroic fairy tale: In the fairy tale, the father of the king's daughter generally has only one daughter, and no sons at all. Thus, Jonathan does not appear in the main part of the story, but only at the end, actually outside the framework of the fairy tale model (1 Sam 18,1.3-4); he forms a part of the recognition of the hero's greatness, of which the second part is David's joining the king's court (18,1-5). According to Skaftymov's model (see next section), the ruler and his sons are among the background roles who fear the villain; this fear of theirs serves to adorn the hero, who comes from outside the king's court. (e) Saul gives David means by which to defeat Goliath, but, being conventional, they are not appropriate. David chooses himself the appropriate means - they are unconventional. Our text does not imply that David possesses the supernatural knowledge that these un- conventional weapons he chooses are precisely the right ones to use in order to defeat Goliath. Such knowledge is possessed by the hero of the fairy tale, in which it fills the narrative role of marvelous helper. In our text it would perhaps be barely possible to allot the role of helper to "God", who is mentioned by David; however, this mention is appar- ently just a common epic formula, similar to that found in the Slavic epic, for example. (f) David cuts off Goliath's head and is brought to Saul, carrying it in his hands (verse 57). In the fairy tale, the hero who kills the dragon in combat takes off part of the dragon's body as proof that it was indeed he who killed it. In some fairy tale texts, the tongue is cut off from the dragon's mouth; in others, the entire head is cut off. If the hero cuts off the tongue, the false heroes will cut off the dragon's head, and by (n) See the description of the fairy tale world in H. Jason, "Aspects of the Fabulous in Oral Literature", Fabula 19 (1978) 14-31.</page><page sequence="10">The Story of David and Goliath: A Folk Epic? 45 presenting it, try to prove that they are the victors and deserve the king's daughter. In any case, the cut-off head in the fairy tale serves as proof that its bearer is the victor. (g) Our composition ends without David's having been granted his promised reward. David will receive Saul's daughter only after he has performed an additional task (1 Sam 18,20-28). In the framework of the fairy tale model, David's joining the royal court is a "quasi-end- ing". The hero does not win the fairy-tale reward promised him in function 9: wealth, king's daughter, "the making of his house free in Israel". His joining the royal court, receiving Saul's apparel, and win- ning Jonathan's friendship - these constitute the typical epic reward (18,1-5). Thus, this passage fits in well with Skaftymov's model for the epic (see Table 3) . In the original composition, the two types of rewards could have stood side by side, and so have changed the heroic fairy tale into a real romantic epic: David gets the king's daughter, and joins the king's court as well. 1.2.2.

Jason Remarks concerning Table 3: (a) The numeration of the episode is taken from Jason (12) (b) Verse 32, "[...] let no man's heart - DTK aV - fail because of him [. . .]", is given by the Septuagint as follows: "[...] let not my master's heart - '•IHN a1? - fail because of him [...]" (18)- The reading ''my master" - WN - seems more acceptable in the framework of Skafty- mov's model. In episode 3, the ruler is no less frightened than are his people at the sight of the giant enemy. In the Russian epic song, the king is powerless, and even weeps bitterly. The ruler is a symbol of the people's weakness; this weakness serves to accentuate the hero's great- ness, which overpowers the mighty enemy despite all obstacles. (c) See remark (f) to Table 2. 1.2.3 Narrative roles and characters 1.2.3.1 Roles and characters in Propp's model. The characters play in narrative roles according to the following division: hero - David villain - Goliath and the Philistines £onor j - David (a helper to himself) marvelous helpers - David's weapons are a means of victory, (means) but they are not marvelous and were not given to him by Saul (unconventionality instead of marvelous quality) - The father dispatches David to the bat- - the people report to David about Saul's offer of his daughter entity- to-be- won - the king's daughter and her father: Saul and his daughter (which one?) false heroes - David's brothers (who do not defeat Goliath) 1.2.3.2 Roles and characters in Skaftymov's model. The div- ision is as follows: hero - David hero's opponent - Goliath and the Philistines (with no further specification) - Saul, his family, his retinue, the people - David's family (12) Jason, «Precursors of Propp. . . ».

ZNW 6 (1929) 144 note a.</page><page sequence="12">The Story of David and Goliath: A Folk Epic? 47 Every character has its place in both models; no character is left unclassified. Still, Propp's model is more important for our purposes. It is more detailed; at the same time, each character has its place in it, and no narrative role is left unfilled. 1.3 Formulaic number Two systems of formulaic numbers appear in our story: the first based on the number "3" and its products, and the second based on the numbers "2" and "5" and their products. In one instance, the numbers "7" and "40" appear; they stand alone and do not form a system. Constructions based on the formulaic number "3" are employed in our story on several planes. David has three older brothers who function as one group character, the eldest being the spokesman. The plot would have been the same had only one brother functioned in the story. In such a case, there would have been no formulaic number, and the result would have been two characters alone: David and his brother. A second use of the formulaic number "3" is found in the enu- meration of the items of food (three) which David must bring to the camp: parched grain, loaves, and cheeses (verses 17-18). A prod- uct of three, six, is the number of items of military equipment worn by Goliath (verses 5-7); a helmet of bronze, coat of mail, greaves of bronze, javelin, spear's shaft, spear's head. If we add "shield- bearer" to these, the number is 7 - also a formulaic number (see end of chapter). As stated by David, the number of Goliath's mil- itary equipment is three: "with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin" (verse 45). In short, the enumeration of the equipment is formulaic, and does not teach us anything about the actual diversity of Goliath's costume and weaponry. A formulaic number of items is enumerated, and in order to reach the number six, the spear ap- parently had to be counted twice. Goliath's height is stated as "six cubits" and "a little more" - a span (verse 4). A round number plus "a little more" is a standard formula for expressing large amounts and sizes in the ethnopoetry of the Middle East. The number six also determines, in a covert way, the movements of the characters within the space of the story. With their movements, the characters form six circles, three of which are between the battle- field and Bethlehem (see section 2.5.3.1, note 2). Four narrative elements occur three times: the description of the arraying of the two camps (verses 2-3.19.21); Goliath's speech</page><page sequence="13">48 H. Jason (verses 8-9.16.23); the expression of Israel's fear of Goliath (verses 11.24.33); and the report of Saul's offer of his daughter to the victor over Goliath (verses 25.26-27.30). An unusual phenomenon in Middle East culture is the presence of the system based on the formulaic numbers "2" and "5", common among the African peoples south of the Sahara. These numbers and their products appear in the enumeration and description of the following items: ten loaves (verse 17), ten cheeses (verse 18), five thousand shekels of bronze (verse 5). According to the Septuagint, Goliath's height is four cubits (2x2). The number four also appears in a covert way: as stated above, 4 narrative elements occur three times. The resulting equa- tion is "3x4 = 12" - that is, two systems of formulaic numbers unite. The number system based on two and five appears elsewhere in the Bible, and the matter is worthy of study. As of now, there is no explanation for this phenomenon (14) . The number seven is found in "the eight sons" of Jesse (verse 12), that is, 7 sons + 1, David (we may also find the number seven in the enumeration of the arms worn by Goliath, if we include "the shield-bearer"). The formulaic number "40": for 40 days, Goliath calls out his invitation to come and do battle with him (verse 16). The number "40" is used in the oral literature of the Middle East as a symbol for "many"; in our text, "many days". The long span of time that Goliath calls Israel to battle, during which no man dares confront him, symbolizes Israel's (including David's brothers) weakness (see episode 3 of Table 3). A similar meaning of "many" is found in the statement of the weight of Goliath's weaponry, given in round numbers: five thousand, six hundred (verses 5.7). 2. Narrative semantics Our examination of the narrative semantics of the story will be based on five aspects which can be grouped into two categories: the repertoire of the contentual terms (anthropomorphic, zoomorphic (14) See H.

Nar- rative semantics is the most variegated aspect of the work, and its importance in determining the work's genre is probably greater than that of the syntax. 2.1 Anthropomorphic terms 2.1.1 Age and sex of the characters. All the narrative characters of our text are male. One woman is mentioned: Saul's daughter, who functions as the reward to Goliath's conqueror. The age of only one character is mentioned - that of the narrative hero, David. His youth is emphasized. According to Skaftymov, David's youth functions as a component of the narrative structure (see episode 1, Table 3). 2.1.2 Quantitative aspect of the characters. There are both single characters - David, his father Jesse, Saul, his military com- mander Abner - and group characters, each functioning as a single person: (a) David's three brothers, (b) "a man of Israel" = "the people standing with him" = "the people", (c) Goliath and "the shield-bearer", (d) the Philistines. 2.1.3 Description of the characters. Only two of the characters are given any kind of a physical description: David and Goliath, the two partners to the confrontation. Curiously, the one detailed description of costume and equipment worn refers not to David, "our hero", as is customary in the historical and national epic (16), but rather to the enemy, Goliath. This can perhaps be best explained by the fact that a description of Goliath's military apparel serves at the same time to depict the enemy's power (an essential structural component of the Russian national epic, according to Skaftymov, see episode 2, Table 3). 2.1.4 Kinship relations of the characters. In our text, the hero, who is still unmarried, has a father and brothers. The villain has no family in our text, but three brothers of Goliath are mentioned elsewhere; they are also giants who must be fought against (2 Sam 21,16-22). Characters like these, with similar kinship relations, ap- pear both in the fairy tale and in various genres of the epic (Beo- wulf's opponent, for example, the fabulous creature Grendel, has a dragon family which must be fought against). (u) For a description of these aspects, see Jason, Ethnopoetry . . . (16) Lord, op. cit., chapter 4. Biblica 60 (1979) 4</page><page sequence="15">50 H. Jason Like the king in every fairy tale, Saul in our story has a daughter, offered as prize to the victor over the enemy. Saul's sons are not mentioned in our text, just as in the fairy tale, where the father of the king's daughter has no sons. This is why the ending of the story in chapter 18, verses 1-5, in which Jonathan first appears, does not fit into the framework of Propp's model for the epic fairy tale, and must constitute a "quasi-ending" (see remark [g] to Table 2). 2.1.5 Types of characters. All the characters are natural and possess human dimensions. Even the giant Goliath, about two meters tall, is perceived as a human being, and no deeds beyond normal mortal ability are attributed to him, such a deed, for ins- tance, as the ability to conquer an entire army singlehanded, as do the heroes in the Russian national epic. God does not play an active role in the narrative, and is only mentioned by David. David relies on God's assistance. This doe$ not mean that David has supernatural powers. He is victorious by virtue of his physical strength and agility alone. When presenting himself before Saul, David refers to his physical strength and ca- pability, while giving general praise to God. 2.1.6 Filling of the narrative roles. As stated above (section 1. 2.3), all the characters fill roles in Propp's scheme; the connection between the characters' semantic attributes and their roles is the same as in the fairy tale. One instance of role-filling is exceptional, however, and has great importance for the development of models for the fairy tale. In our text, Saul, who constitutes the secondary component in the role "entity-to-be- won", also fills the role of donor, albeit not to the full. He tries to bestow the proper means of combat to the hero, but is unsuccessful. Such a division of characters is not to be found in the fairy tale. In the latter, the king's daughter, who is the primary filler of the role "entity-to-be-won", can also function as donor. She bestows upon the hero the marvelous means by which he accomplishes the tasks set to him by his father. In our text, the king, rather than his daughter, plays the part of "donor". In other words: as in the fairy tale, here, too, these two roles are intertwined, but in our text, the characters have an inverted relationship to one another. (This inversion is not perfectly symmetrical, since both roles impose a task on the hero-suitor, see Tables 4a and 4b). The secondary character in the role "entity-to-be- won" - Saul - does try to play the part of "donor", but without success.</page><page sequence="16">The Story of David and Goliath: A Folk Epic? 51 Table 4a: The king's daughter and her father in the fairy tale Me, ole King's daughter ""ïàuglte^ entity-to-be-won -f main part of the role - not main part of the role 4- can fill the role alone - cannot fill the role alone + imposes task on hero + imposes task on hero -f- is given to hero - is not given to hero donor succeeds in bestow- - does not fill the ing means of victory donor role to hero Table 4b: The king's daughter and her father in the Biblical text ^ , , __ . » j Father of king's Tale ^ , role , King __ . » s daughter j daughter (Saul) entity-to-be-won -|- main part of role - not main part of role [+ can fill the role - cannot fill the role alone] alone [+ imposes task on -f- imposes task on hero hero] -f is given to hero - is not given to hero donor [+ succeeds in bestow- - as donor, does not ing means of victory succeed in bestowing to hero] means of victory to hero 2.1.7 Patterning of the repertoire of characters. The characters are divided into two opposing camps: "we" and "the enemy". There is no character in the story who does not belong to one of those two camps (if there were such a character, he would be a mediator). The characters of "our" camp are both more numerous and more specified than are those of "the enemy" camp. Both camps have a central hero, each of whom has a retinue. In "our" camp, David is the hero; his retinue includes the members</page><page sequence="17">52 H. Jason of his family, "the people", the king, and the king's men. In "the enemy" camp, Goliath is the hero; his retinue includes the Philis- tines as a single group character, with no further specification. The two opposing heroes stand in a symmetrically opposed relationship to one another: Table 5 : Attributes of the hero and his opponent Attribute David Goliath age a youth a grownup appearance short giant relationship not knowledgeable in a professional warrior to warfare warfare (a shepherd) use of means use of natural, noncon- use of cultural products, ventional means (peb- conventional means bles from a brook) (man-made arms) "Our" camp plays in all of the episodes, whereas the enemy camp plays only in some of them: David and his retinue versus Go- liath and his retinue. In "our" camp, David stands facing his retinue (his father, his brothers, the people, the king), which can be split up further (Saul and Abner, Abner constituting part of Saul's retinue). The following paradigm emerges: Table 6: Paradigm of narrative characters "Our" camp Enemy camp hero hero's retinue hero hero's retinue (David) (Goliath) (Philistines) David's family king (Saul) the people father brother king king's retinue (Abner) (daughter) Such a pattern, wherein the characters of "our" camp are more specified than those of the enemy camp, is typical of the epic. The opposite is true of the heroic fairy tale: there, the</page><page sequence="18">The Story of David and Goliath: A Folk Epic? 53 characters from the "other" world (= "they") are more specified than those of "this" world (= "us"). The division of roles between "our" camp and "the enemy" camp constitutes a further difference between our story and the heroic fairy tale. In the latter, the hero and his family all belong to "our" camp, while the "entity-to-be-won" - the king's daughter - belongs to the "other" camp. In our text, the split is entirely within "our" camp (see Table 6). 2.2 The repertoire of object-like terms Two categories of objects appear in our text: the weaponry of Goliath, Saul, and David; and the items of food which David must bring to his brothers. All of these objects are natural. The weapons are conspicuously made of metal - bronze and iron. The unusually large dimensions of Goliath's weapons are emphasized: his spear is the size of "a weaver's beam", his other arms are of enormous weight. "A spear like a weaver's beam" seems to be the set formula used to designate the weaponry of an exceptional hero, or perhaps of an unusually strong enemy; in one instance, this is Goliath (see also 2 Sam 21,19), and in another instance, "an Egyptian" (2 Chron 11,23). Like the description of Goliath's height, this description functions as a statement of the enemy's power (see episode 2, Ta- ble 3). Prominent among the weapons due to their unusual type (they are natural) and size (they are small compared to regular weap- ons) are David's "smooth stones from the brook" (verse 40); Go- liath complains that David's arms do not meet accepted standards (they are unconventional) (verse 43). 2.3 Repertoire of zoomorphic terms The animals in our story appear as requisites, thus the flock of which David is the shepherd - while the lion and bear serve as an allegory of the enemy which David is about to confront. The slaying of a lion is a standard task of the hero in the Biblical work (see Samson: Judg 14,5-6, Benajah, the son of Jehojada: 2 Sam 23,20; 1 Chron 11,22). Perhaps the slaying of a lion was considered a test of a young man's fitness as a hero - a sort of "certificate of heroism" which enabled him to be one of the king's heroes. In our text, it is clear that the victory over the lion serves, in Saul's eyes, as proof of David's qualifications as a hero.</page><page sequence="19">54 H. Jason 2.4 Temporal aspect 2.4.1 Category of time. The time in our text is natural, histor- ical, and flows in a regular rhythm, as is customary in the historical epic. The characters are born, grow up, age, and die. There are no supernatural elements in this type of time. 2.4.2 Movement of time within the story. The course of time may be divided into three periods: (1) The setting up of the two camps in the battlefield (the narrative complication) (2) The waiting period, during which Goliath invites Israel to battle (40 days = many days) (3) David's appearance, the duel, and the victory over the Philistines (the narrative resolution). Two chains of action occur at the same time: the conversation between Jesse and David in Bethlehem, and Israel's confrontation with the Philistines in the battlefield. The function of verse 19 in the narrative is to state the simultaneity of those two events. The verse contributes nothing to the progress of the narrative; the story could just as well exist without it. The organization of events on simultaneous time axes is rare in the fairy tale, but is familiar to us from the epic (in the Odyssey, for example, the adven- tures of Odysseus and of his son are two simultaneous chains of events). 2.4.3 Historical scheme. Our story takes place in a very well- defined historical time, as is generally the case in the historical epic. It belongs to a cycle of stories whose central characters are Samuel, Saul, and David. All the narrative characters in the cycle are of approximately the same generation; their fathers and sons are mar- ginal. This generation is known as the "epic generation", and it exists in the "epic period". Saul's son Jonathan, as well as David's sons, act in a number of instances side by side with their fathers, and even serve as heroes of certain narratives (1 Samuel 14,1-46, 2 Samuel 13-18), but do not function as the central heroes of the entire cycle, at least not in the group of works in our hands today. The "epic period" of the present narrative cycle includes the periods before the established kingdom and the actual formation of this kingdom. (The stories of the Judges form a separate cycle which has its own "epic period"; no independent sources to support the chronological order in the Book of Judges are known to date).</page><page sequence="20">The Story of David and Goliath: A Folk Epic? 55 2.5 Spatial aspect 2.5.1 Category of space. The space in our text is entirely nat- ural and within the boundaries of "this'1 world. There are no super- natural elements whatever; thus our text fits into the scheme of the historical epic. 2.5.2 Spatial patterns in the text. The story has one central arena: the battlefield, which includes the center of the valley, and on either side of it, the opposing camps. Two symmetrical extensions reach out from this center to the hinterland centers of the two camps. A special center exists within "our" camp - the king's court. Thus the space of the story is divided into two symmetrical parts: "our" realm, the "enemy's" realm, and "a valley between them" (verse 3). The "valley" is the neutral zone in which the two sides meet. Such a neutral zone must be located in the center of the story's spatial model, and indeed, this is the case in our text. 2.5.3 Movement of narrative characters in the text. The move- ment of characters in the spatial scene of our text tends to be cir- cular. The characters move towards the center of the stage of action, away from it, and towards it once again. Thus it is said of David that he "went back and forth from Saul" (verse 15 - see note 'a* to Table 7), and again returns to the camp when his father sends him there. The Philistines come from their country to the center of the stage of action and back to their country again (verses 1.52). The Israelites pursue the Philistines, enter the enemy land, and return to the camp (verses 52-53). In the heroic fairy tale, the spatial movement tends to be either unidirectional or moving in one circle. The hero leaves "this" world for the "other" world, in which he wins the hand of the king's daugh- ter. He may remain in the other world and succeed the princess's father (a unidirectional movement), or he may return, together with the princess, to this world, to his father's kingdom, and succeed him (movement of one circle). Verse 54 ("And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put the armor in his tent") does not make sense in this framework. The relevance of Jerusalem here is unclear. One possible explanation of the verse is as follows: our work, in its present form, was recorded from an epic performer long after the actual events took place, at a time when Jerusalem was already the center of the country in the people's consciousness, a center to which everything of importance, such as the head of a conquered</page><page sequence="21">56 H. Jason enemy, was brought. The mention of Goliath's weapons strengthens this assumption of a late performance of the work. As we learn from 1 Samuel 21,10, Goliath's weapons did not end up in David's "tent" (property), but rather in a local temple, and were taken by David from there. The sword may have remained in his possession from the battle on, and this is perhaps what the text is referring to. The assumption that the correct reading here is TlbfcÒ = to God's sanc- tuary (17) - in other words, that according to the verse, it was David who deposited Goliath's weapons in the temple at Nob - leaves the reference to Jerusalem as enigmatic as before. 2.5.3.1 Episodic model. The story can be divided into episodes which do not parallel the divisions of either Propp or Skaftymov (sections 1.2.1, 1.2.2 above). The movements of the characters within the spatial realm of the story, together with the changes in the stage of action, divide the story into episodes; motion in space and change in stage of action limit the episode. The motions in space are stated in the text; the changes in stage are not expressly stated, but are implied. In every episode, there are only two characters; at least one of them belongs to "our" side. The division into episodes is as follows: Table 7: Division of text into episodes sode Summary of text Movement Location Verse [Philistines come from motion in space - Philistea to Judea] ( - 1) 1 Two camps prepare for battlefield 1-11 battle; Goliath invites for battle [from battlefield to change in stage - Bethlehem] 2 Jesse sends sons to camp Bethlehem 12 Jesse's sons go to camp; motion in space 14-15 David goes to camp and (1,2) returns to Bethlehem [from Bethlehem to bat- change in stage - tlefield] (17) Ehrlich, op. cit., 230; Hertzberg, op. cit., 154, and I and II Samuel: A Commentary (1964) 154.</page><page sequence="22">The Story of David and Goliath: A Folk Epic? 57 ^Pj1" Summary of text Movement Location Verse 3 Two camps are arranged battlefield 16 on the battlefield [from battlefield to change in stage - Bethlehem] 4 Jesse sends David to Bethlehem 17-18 battlefield [from Bethlehem to change in stage - battlefield] 5 Two camps arranged on battlefield 19 battlefield [from battlefield to change in stage - Bethlehem] David goes from Beth- motion in space 20a lehem to battlefield (3) 6 People tell David of battlefield 21-30 Saul's task David is brought to Saul motion in space 31 (from periphery of camp (4) to its center) 7 David offers his services Saul's court 32-40a to Saul in camp David goes from center motion in space 40b of camp to center of (4) battlefield 8 David fights with Go- battlefield 41-51a.b hath and defeats him Philistines flee from bat- m0ti0n in space 51c tlefield towards their land v ' Israel pursue Philistines motion in space 52 and enter their land ^ *fr?eK reíurns motion in space 53a tlefield from land of (g' Philistines 9 Israel destroys Philisti- battlefield 53b nes' camp [from battlefield to change 6 in stage(P) 6 v J - Jerusalem (?)] 6 6 v J 10 David deposits Go- Jerusalem(P) 54 liath's head in Jerusalem</page><page sequence="23">58 H.

Its superfluousness is particularly conspicuous in the framework of the spatial pattern based on the movements of the characters in space. One may concur with the Biblical scholars (18) that the verse was added in (w) Hertzberg, "Mitzpa", p. 149.</page><page sequence="24">The Story of David and Goliath: A Folk Epic? 59 order to connect the narrative in chapter 16, where David is already staying in the king's court, with our story, in which he does not belong to the king's court. On the other hand, the verse fits well with the kind of circular movement which the characters in our story perform. (b) We found six circular movements from the battlefield to some other point and back again to the battlefield (see Figure 1). 2.5.4 Epic space. In the epic spatial pattern, the narrative action takes place in the areas of "our country" and "the enemy country" . The locations within "our country" are detailed; "the enemy country" is far less specified. In the text before us, we lack both the "identity card" of the story (information about the story- teller or singer and his audience, their place of residence, place of performance of the text, and time of performance), and a sufficient number of epic works for comparison. Therefore, we cannot know whether or not the locations mentioned in our story are familiar to the narrating community from personal experience. Are they historically real, or are they perhaps standard formulas used by the performer in time of need? Every epic tradition has a formulaic stock of spatial points and concepts, and it is not necessary that the performer know these places, where they are located or what the real distances are between them (19). "The Valley of Elah" and "Ephes-dammim", whose locations are not very clear, fit well into this picture (20). The space as given in our text - "our country" and "the enemy country", with the confrontation taking place on the border between the two, and "our country" being much more specified than "the enemy country" - is the typical spatial pattern of the historical and national epic. This pattern is clearer in the national epic (which exists on a higher level of symbolization), and is slightly blurred in the historical epic, which is closer to reality. In reality, there are no unequivocal borders, and the encounter does not occur exactly on the geographical border between the two countries; the enemy may enter "our country". This is the situation in our text ("Socoh, which belongs to Judah"). (l#) Lord, op. cit. (20) W. Caspari, Die Samuelbücher (1926), 119, note 2, and HERTZ- BERG, I and II Samuel..., 148.</page><page sequence="25">60 H. Jason 3. What does the story represent? 3.1 Completeness of the text In our analysis, we assumed that our text is a narrative whole and is not composed of individual units joined together mechanically. We found support for this assumption in the way the text is organized according to two different schemes: (a) The text lends itself to a complete analysis based on nar- rative models both of the fairy tale and of the epic. No character or action remained in the text which did not have its place in each of the models. This organization of characters and their actions is unconscious to the improvisor-performer of the work. (b) The text is organized according to the rules of the formulaic number. Two systems of numbers organize the text on the covert plane, unknown to the performer of the work: four of the narrative elements occur thrice (section 1.3) ; in the spatial pattern, the charac- ters form six circles with their movements (section 2.5.3.1). Such an unconscious organization cannot occur in a text that has been patched together mechanically from separate parts, each deriving from a different tradition; our text, therefore, constitutes a complete literary work. 3.1.1 Duplication of narrative elements. The problem of du- plication of narrative elements (David's twice joining the king's court and twice carrying out the suitor's task in order to win the king's daughter), solved in the Septuagint reading, (see Appendix 4.1), does not appear to be a problem of textual criticism alone. Too many narrative elements and events are duplicated in the Bible for them to be explained away as a chance, mechanical combination of earlier sources. We will mention only a few examples, from pas- sages close to our text: Saul is crowned king twice (1 Sam 10; 11); Saul has two daughters, each of whom is offered to David separately (1 Sam 18,17-18); Goliath is slain twice (1 Sam 17,49-51; 2 Sam 21,19); David flees from Saul twice (1 Sam 19,10-18; 20,35-42); David is twice given the opportunity to kill Saul (1 Sam 24; 26). The reason for the above duplications apparently lies elsewhere, perhaps in some literary principle governing the composition of the Biblical narrative sequence. Why, for example, do none of these episodes occur thrice, or four times? Why, in every case, do they occur spe- cifically twice? And how can we explain that two stories, given</page><page sequence="26">The Story of David and Goliath: A Folk Epic? 61 one after the other, explain in a different way the same event? Let us return once more to the oral tradition for a possible answer. Many versions and traditions tend to exist side by side, even in the words of the same performer. The performer can be unaware of the differences between the versions and the discrepancies stem- ming from these differences, claiming that he always performs the work in the same way; or, he can be aware of the problem, and as- sert that he knows several versions of the work, having heard one version from one person and another version from another person. We have no proof that the performer tries consciously to combine different versions together in order to clear up the discrepancies between them (21). 3.2 Nature of the work Is our text a work of oral literature, with all that this entails, or is it the work of an individual author? (22) Our text can be measured with all the folkloristic tools, and it fits its models. A text which has been created by an individual author and written naively, that is, without any intention of imita- ting a work of oral literature, cannot be measured by folkloristic tools or models. Therefore, as our text can be measured by such tools, it is reasonable to assume that, in its original, it was a work of oral literature, or an exceptionally successful imitation of such a work. The absence of the original texture of the work makes its exact classification difficult. Imitators fail more often in imitation of the texture than of the plot structure (23). In either case - whether we have before us an original work of oral literature or a successful imitation - the question arises as to what genre to ascribe it to. 3.3 Genre of the work In the introduction to this paper, two genres were mentioned, which seemed appropriate models for our story: the heroic fairy (21) See, for instance, D. Nov, Jefet Schwili erzählt (1963), 20. (22) For a discussion on the fundamental differences between these two types of literature, see P. Bogatyrev and R. Jakobson, "Die Folk- lore als besondere Form des Schaffens". Donům Natalicium Schrijnen (1929), 900-913. H Lord, op. cit., 130-38.</page><page sequence="27">62 H. Jason tale and the romantic epic. We will attempt now to choose between them i24) . The fairy tale is a work of oral literature, usually presented in prose and only rarely in verse, in which a man must confront marvelous forces in order to win a royal-marvelous spouse, and in so doing, he redeems the latter and his/her marvelous world from marvelous- ness, and makes them human. In the heroic fairy tale , the hero enters the marvelous world and wins the marvelous king's daughter after carrying out various tasks. Among the more prominent tasks is that of defeating a mons- ter, which is a rival suitor who tries to win the king's daughter for himself. The epic is a work of oral literature couched in verse or prose or both combined. In the epic, man confronts the world on the plane of his physical strength; a certain human group confronts another group, human or supernatural. The historic epic relates of a struggle between ethnic groups, nations or tribes, or kinship groups. The dimensions of its elements are both human and realistic. Historical epic is set in frameworks of historical time and concrete space, close to a defined historical reality (historical characters play parts in it, and historical events are related). Supernatural elements are few. Examples of the historical epic: The Greek Iliad (in verse), the Turkish Dede Korkut (in prose and some verse), and South Slavic epic songs (in verse). The romantic epic is a sub-genre of that epic which is current in the narrating community. It can be a historic or a national epic (the national epic is on a higher level of symbolization than the his- toric epic; it does not tell of concrete historical characters and events. Examples of national epic: Russian epic songs). The romantic epic tells (a) of a hero who wins a bride after carrying out certain tasks, or (b) of a pair of lovers, or a married couple, who are separated by hostile forces (natural or supernatural) and who struggle to reunite. The plot structure of the romantic epic is similar to that of the heroic fairy tale as sketched by Propp. Supernatural elements penetrate easily into this sub-genre. During his struggles and adventures, the hero can leave the realm of this world and enter various kinds of supernatural worlds, while supernatural powers may interfere bet- ween him and his bride. In this sense, too, this type of epic resem- (M) For a detailed description of the genres, see Jason, Ethnopoetry. . .</page><page sequence="28">The Story of David and Goliath: A Folk Epic? 63 bles the heroic fairy tale. The hero's basic struggle in the romantic epic is carried out by natural means: his strength and ability in an armed battle. The Odyssey is an example of a romantic epic, type (b). Examples of type (a) are found in the South Slavic and central- Asian epic songs. Let us compare the elements of the heroic fairy tale with those of the romantic epic. We will see that the syntactic component (the plot structure) of both is similar, while the semantic component differs between them (note: "-I-" stands for similarity, " - " for difference).

While Propp's model of the fairy tale serves well for an analysis of the text, the latter can also be analyzed by means of the models prepared especially for analysis of the epic (Skaftymov's model), something which can- not be said of the heroic fairy tale. The semantic elements leave no doubt that our text belongs to the romantic epic genre. Let us review again, in brief, the qualities of our story: characters: All the characters are human, of realistic dimensions; "our" characters are also historical and more detailed, hero: Hero starts out weak, young; he is drawn by independent mo- tives when he announces his wish "to take away the reproach from Israel" and to restore the honor of "the armies of the living God". objects: All the objects are natural. The weapons of both heroes are exceptional: Goliath's weapons are larger than the usual, while David's are smaller than the usual and are not appropriate - or so it seems - to the situation, but they have no super- natural components. animals: All the animals are natural, and function as requisites, or as proof in an argument. They do not aid the narrative characters. Biblica 60 (1979) 5</page><page sequence="31">66 H. Jason dimension of time: The narrative takes place entirely within natural time, in the historical framework of the battle between the Israelite tribes and the Philistines, and during the lifetimes of its central per- sonages: David and Saul, dimension of space: The story takes place within the realm of "our country" - Judah, in well-specified places. There are no supernatural el- ements in this space. In conclusion: Our text is a short, prose record of an ethno- poetic epic work (real or imitated) which was possibly composed in verse form; its genre is the romantic epic of type 'a', a sub-genre of the historic epic. 4. Appendices 4.1 Septuagint version of the story The version of the text in the Septuagint is different from our version. Some minor differences between the two readings have already been dealt with in our discussion (sections 1.1.2; 1.2.2, note 2), but the major difference, namely the absence, in the Septuagint version, of three passages from the story, yet remains: 17,12-31 are absent, as well as 17,55-58 and 18,1-5. These passages deal with David's entrance on the stage of the story, his motivation to do battle with Goliath (the offer of the king's daughter to the victor), his presentation before Saul, his joining the king's court, and his friendship with Jonathan. The absence of these passages helps fit our story into the general narrative sequence of the Book of Samuel; for only in the previous chapter David was introduced to Saul, joined his court, and became his armour-bearer (16,14-32); and im- mediately in the next chapter, Michal is offered to David in exchange for carrying out a different task: to bring a hundred foreskins of Philistines (18,20-28). In the passages which are absent in the Sep- tuagint, those two episodes are duplicated, making the interpreter's job difficult - especially since the Septuagint version of the text is otherwise smooth and creates less problems. Which of the two texts reflects the original work, and why? In both cases of a different reading for the same word (see sections 1.1.2: gai - Gat; 1.2.2, note 2: man - my master), the Septuagint</page><page sequence="32">The Story of David and Goliath: A Folk Epic? 67 version fits the folkloristic patterns better than does the Hebrew version. Yet the situation seems to be reversed in the matter of the absent passages. If verses 17,12-31, 17,55-58, and 18,1-5 had been a mechanical addition, a " 'patch' ' or a " secondary'' story in- serted into the "main" story (25), it would have been impossible to analyze the entire text as a complete literary unit, and this we suc- ceeded in doing (see section 3.1). We find additional support for the opinion that the longer Hebrew text is the original in the discrepancy which remains in the Septuagint reading. I am referring to verses 33-41. Here David is still a youth, a shepherd, not knowledgeable in war, while in chapter 16,21 (also present in the Septuagint), he is already Saul's armour-bearer, in other words, a soldier, or at least a trainee. Hertzberg (26) explains the Hebrew version in chapter 17 as fulfilling the need to present David as the one destined to be the future king, and Jonathan as giving up this right in advance - an interpretation not implied in chapter 16, when David is first intro- duced to Saul's court. While this explanation is reasonable in the narrative sequence of the Book of Samuel, it cannot be inferred from the story itself. Every element has its own raison-d'être in the plot of the story. According to both plot models (sections 1.2.1, 1.2.2), David cannot belong to the group of the king's heroes. David must come from some outer world - in this case, outside the king's court, - in order for him to be able to defeat Goliath. Thus, Saul can re- cognize him only after the decisive battle. The second duplication in our story, the offer of the king's daughter to David, is an inseparable part of the fairy tale model, and constitutes the hero's motivation (functions no. 9, 10, 11, 15 of Propp). In the Septuagint, function 8 in move 2 could have been left out, because in its place we have function 8 of move 1, from which function 11 - verses 12-15 - is left out. In this way, the Septuagint version combines the moves into one single move, but not a complete one. The Septuagint version is therefore not mea- surable with Propp's model. However, it is also not measurable with Skaftymov's model: episodes 1 and 8, which are essential to the model, are absent there. (M) So Caspari, op. cit., 198-223.

P.O.Box 11044 Jerusalem Israel Heda Jason It is a pleasant duty to thank here the Biblical scholars M. Green- berg and Y. Zakovich of the Hebrew University who gave of their time to advise me on Biblical matters, and to D. Segal of the Hebrew Uni- versity, who took the trouble of reading and commenting on the manu- script. This work was also enriched by the discussions which took place in the interdepartmental seminar on the epic, held in 1975 at the Hebrew University, and I am grateful to the participants of the seminar. For all that, any flaws present in this work are mine alone. The Revised Standard Version of the Bible (1953) has generally been used here. An earlier version of this paper was published in Hebrew in Hasifruth 23 (1976) 23-41.</page></plain_text>
