<plain_text><page sequence="1">The False Goddess and Her Lost Paradise BRUCE THORNTON And so feminism today has taken a distressing step away off the path to equality onto a detour down a yellow brick road. Feminist leaders are now telling women to perform the mod ern equivalent of the Sioux Indian Ghost Dance, to spend our energies frantically calling upon a mythical golden age in an effort to create a dreamlike future?because such rituals are better suited to our superior nature than fighting directly with men for our rights.1 V&gt;/ne of TODAY'S FASTEST growing cults worships a goddess that some modern academics have conjured into exis tence out of the bits and pieces of ancient myths and prehistoric artifacts. The popularity of the "Goddess," as she's usually called, is unquestioned and ubiquitous. Goddess worship gets its own enthusiastic chapter in Megatrends for Women and has its own magazines like Sage-Woman and Crone Chronicles.1 The Goddess herself is popularized in Jean Auel's best-selling novels set in Ice Age Europe. Bookstores are filled as well with the self help works of Felicity Wombwell and Starhawk who transform the ancient "goddess wisdom" into therapeutic solace for the angst-ridden middle class. The professional feminist conference circuit is increasingly a venue for drum-banging goddess rituals and chants, not to mention the sale of statuettes, crystals, tracts, and jewelry.3 Witches' covens are proliferating, since witchcraft is considered to be the oft-persecuted remnant of the old God dess religion "that centers on love and respect for the Earth and the power of women," according to self-styled witch Z. Budapest.4 One might be tempted to dismiss Goddess worship as another transitory New Age fad flourishing among the tabloid semi literate. Unfortunately, Goddess worship is strongest in the pre sumed bastions of clear thinking and rational discourse, the universities. As Philip G. Davis has noted, "Far from lagging</page><page sequence="2">Bruce Thornton 73 behind, universities have become major vehicles for the spread of the Goddess movement."5 As one might guess, women's studies departments are the major academic clearing house for the distri bution of Goddess lore to students. The annual National Wom en's Studies Association Conference devotes much of its time and energy to the Goddess business and her "healing rituals."6 But more traditional academic disciplines, especially archaeol ogy, lend the authority of what is supposed to be empirically based research to an enterprise that can only be religious at best and anti-rationalist at worst. In its academic guise, then, Goddess worship represents a dan gerous conflation of New Age religion and dubious scholarship.7 If Goddess worship cast itself as just a religion legitimated only by the faith of its adherents, then its capacity for mischief would be much more limited?though equity feminists should be con cerned about a fad "drunk on disembodied nostalgia, ritualistic pretense, and New Age ideology," as two feminist critics put it.8 Here I am concerned with the spread of specious knowledge resulting from a therapeutic version of the Golden Age myth, one supported by little more than credulity and unexamined feel ing and passed off as facts established by the protocols of ratio nal inquiry. 1. The Therapeutic Imperative The Goddess movement gratifies the anxious city-dweller's long ing for a lost Golden Age of simplicity, peace, harmony, and nature. In addition, the Goddess myth provides an emotional gratification of one's heightened sensitivity to injustice and one's moral superiority to a corrupt Iron Age world?a world, of course, whose technology and affluence create the leisure in which such nostalgic fictions flourish. Cynthia Eller's study of feminist spiritualism confirms that middle-class self-actualization underlies the movement's ubiqui tous therapeutic thrust and popularity. Eller's sociological profile of the typical adherent of the Goddess cult reveals that she is white, middle-class, college-educated, in her thirties or forties,</page><page sequence="3">74 THE FALSE GODDESS AND HER LOST PARADISE and "disproportionately lesbian."9 That is, a cohort of women very likely to be disaffected, in need of therapeutic solace, and able to afford it. Eller's summary of the reasons for Goddess worship's popularity among this group likewise points to West ern radical individualism and self-development as the movement's engine: self-actualization and self-fulfillment, compensation for failing to achieve the exalted expectations on which feminism was supposed to deliver,10 the acquisition of meaning and a mis sion in life.11 Intellectually sophisticated academics and scholars are equally prone to the therapeutic imperative. It reaches bathetic intensity in the work of Carol P. Christ, a leading light of academic femi nist spirituality. In her book Laughter of Aphrodite, Christ is unabashedly frank about the origins of her work in her need for self-fulfillment and self-actualization: "As I look at my writing, I see that I have always been struggling to tell my story, to show the relation of the way I think to the way I live." 12 Given that the needs of the self are the focus rather than truth, Christ's starting point is not an objective, rational interpretation of evi dence by means of a professional methodology, but rather the old stereotype, "intuition" (ix), which provides the "insights with which we create feminist theology" (xvi).13 The portentous "insights," however, revealed by this intuitive power are mere clich?s from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Western roman ticism: "the connections of my spirit to the spirits of all living things"; "our categories separate 'man' from 'nature,' denying the truth that 'we are nature'"; "spirituality is experiencing con nectedness to the life force within all living things" (ix). These chestnuts are as old as Goethe's Werther and resemble the vacu ities that Flaubert's Emma and L?on exchange. They are the lux uries of a self-confessed "white, middle-class, well-educated, California born, feminist" (xii)?that is, an affluent urbanit? protected by a sustaining womb of money and technology that together create the space for "mystical experiences . . . with nature" (ix), experiences that are never put to the gritty test of, say, actually obtaining sustenance from the earth or doing with out mammograms or electricity or antibiotics.</page><page sequence="4">Bruce Thornton js The role of the Goddess, then, is to validate this romantic quest for self-meaning in a nature pacified by the technology Christ deplores, and to aid in the "empowerment" of women by correcting the "devaluation of female power, denigration of the female body, distrust of the female will, and denial of the bonds and heritage that have been engendered by patriarchal reli gion."14 Individualistic cultivation of the self is legitimated by being given a larger communal liberationist goal. This agenda, when projected out onto the larger society, leads to grandiose Utopian claims that there is a lost paradise to be regained if only we return to the Goddess's ancient wisdom?as mediated, of course, by the modern academics who serve as her prophetesses. 2. More Anti-Rationalism Despite their fuzzy rhetoric of self-help and their obsession with their own feelings, Goddess adherents assert that their interpreta tion of history and reconstruction of the Goddess religion are based not primarily on visions or intuition, but on facts acquired through the procedures of rational inquiry. Thus, their history offers a correction of sexist distortions that ignored or misinter preted relevant evidence in order to gratify the "sexual and reli gious biases" of other scholars, as Merlin Stone put it.15 How ever, others like Gero and Conkey in Engendering Archaeology acknowledge that such revisionist history is fraught with an "underlying tension between describing (the data, the interpreta tion, the past) and transforming these through a feminist lens."16 But this serious issue and its implications are never really explored, and in the work of other scholars they are simply ignored. Consider the work of Mari ja Gimbutas, for example, as the premier basis for claims of sound empirical procedure by God dess adherents. Gimbutas had a long and distinguished career as an archaeologist at UCLA, producing some first-rate research before she answered the call of the Goddess. Her authority? based on earlier empirical research conducted according to gen erally accepted methods and protocols?provides the Goddess</page><page sequence="5">76 THE FALSE GODDESS AND HER LOST PARADISE movement with intellectual and scholarly respectability. Hence popularizers can confidently claim (while begging two ques tions) that "Marija Gimbutas?and other archaeologists?have discovered the European cultures that existed before the Indo European invasions."17 But so can the specialists. Mary Lynn Keller says that "Marija Gimbutas's lifework has amassed mate rial evidence for a revolutionary new picture of the cultural roots of Western civilization." Her theory of a Golden Age early Europe destroyed by Indo-European invaders results from "life long study" and is "substantiated by the preponderance of evi dence."18 Those academics who do follow Gimbutas provide copious scholarly documentation and references to monographs, books, and articles that presumably represent a body of informa tion establishing the truth of what is being asserted. However, Gimbutas does not rely solely on empirical evidence to arrive at the conclusions made in many of her works. In a 1989 interview with The Whole Earth Review, she claimed a double warrant for the truth of her work, a scientific one "based on a lot of evidence," and an "intuition" by means of which "you must feel that you are right in what you are saying."19 Mary Lynn Kel ler, in the very same article in which she asserts Gimbutas's empirical bona fides, also alludes to alternative means of appre hending truth, without clearly defining those means, and without giving us any procedure for testing their reliability or telling us how they relate to an empirical method. In fact, she underscores their incompatibility: "I question whether it will be possible to develop new frameworks of interpretation for the artistic and spiritual dimensions of ancient cultures that can be entirely satisfying to strictly empiricist and anti-spiritual scientists." The answer is, it is not possible, given the paucity of evidence and the danger that subjective and anachronistic interpretation will fill the void. That is why the "artistic and spiritual dimensions of ancient cultures" should be a concern of speculative philosophy or more literary styles of history rather than of empirical research. But Keller then goes on to laud Gimbutas because she has solved this perennial conundrum: she "has built a bridge between archaeology and mythology, between science and spiri tuality."20 Well, no doubt creation science makes the same claim,</page><page sequence="6">Bruce Thornton 77 but that doesn't mean that those of us who do not share the faith or mystical experience ultimately holding the bridge together should be forced to walk over it. Gimbutas's implication that there are two separate but com plementary modes of establishing truth is misleading at best. Obviously, intuition plays a role in scientific discoveries, as no doubt do dreams and visions, but always in the final analysis such non-rational sources of inspiration must be subordinated to, not on a par with, the hard test of objectively analyzed evi dence and of professionally-endorsed rational procedures that attempt to falsify the intuition or "feeling" of Tightness in order to insure that both do not reflect irrational wishful thinking. The acid test comes when someone who does not share that "intuition" or "feeling" is convinced by the theory's ability eco nomically and elegantly to account for the evidence. In other words, the empirical method must take precedence and be the final arbiter of a theory's soundness, not the intensity of "intu ition" or the emotional gratification it engenders in one individ ual. We will come to Gimbutas's interpretation of the evidence and the soundness of her theories a little later. 3. Marketing the Goddess Riane Eisler's The Chalice and the Blade has gone through nu merous printings and sold hundreds of thousands of copies since its first appearance in 1987 and has spread the good news of the Goddess and her healing wisdom to an audience larger than any academic could command. 21 Part of the book's appeal, as Cyn thia Eller points out, lies in the way it makes the Goddess more attractive by toning down the anti-male, radical feminist tone that characterizes the work of some Goddess scholars. For exam ple, Eisler substitutes the neologism "gylany," "woman-man rule," for "matriarchy," thus masking the uncomfortable fact that no matriarchal societies can be documented to have ever existed, and cleverly heading off the implication that women can be as power-driven and "hegemonic" as men. More importantly, the therapeutic objective of Goddess worship is expanded</page><page sequence="7">78 THE FALSE GODDESS AND HER LOST PARADISE beyond strange female-centered rituals into a "partnership way" more attractive to middle-class heterosexual couples anxious to nurture their relationships and fulfill themselves. As Eller says, "Eisler has allowed feminist spirituality's sacred history to be marketed to whole new constituencies that might not have been receptive to feminist spirituality itself."22 This therapeutic utopianism, however, is predicated on and le gitimated by Eisler's claim to have discovered a new truth about the past and human nature, one based on evidence gathered by previous scholars: Weaving together evidence from art, archaeology, religion, social science, history, and many other fields of inquiry into new patterns that more accurately fit the best available data, The Chalice and the Blade tells a new story of our cultural origins. It shows that war and the "war of the sexes" are neither divinely nor biologically ordained. And it provides verification that a better future is possible?and is in fact firmly rooted in the haunting drama of what actually happened in our past, (xv) This claim of rediscovered truth makes it easier for non specialists and scholars alike to credit the transformational powers Eisler asserts for this new information. One reviewer, for example, entertains the hope "that we can find our way through toward such an equalitarian, non-exploitative and nonviolent society" as the one Eisler's research presumably has shown to have existed in European prehistory.23 Eisler herself modestly believes her book "will help free our minds and our hands so that we may do what we are so uniquely able to do: be creative, be caring, and pursue the human quest for truth, justice, and beauty."24 However, without the authority of factual truth acquired through presumably flawed Western patriarchal empiri cal procedures, most of us would not take these extravagant transformational claims any more seriously than we take those of New Age tabloid spiritualists or psychic hotline advisors. Since Eisler's evidence for a Goddess-centered Golden Age Old Europe is heavily dependent on the work of scholars like</page><page sequence="8">Bruce Thornton 79 Gimbutas, we can best assess how accurately that evidence sup ports the theory when we come back to Gimbutas's work. But a closer look at Eisler's interpretation of that evidence reveals that, by Eisler's own admission, the evidence is very uncertain and hence vulnerable to her modern preconceptions that are pro jected back onto the prehistoric artifacts. The following passage illustrates Eisler's simultaneous confi dence and instinctive hedging: These cave sanctuaries, figurines, burials, and rites all seem to have been related to a belief that the same source from which human life springs is also the source of all vegetable and animal life?the great Mother Goddess or Giver of All we still find in later periods of Western civilization. They also suggest that our early ancestors recognized that we and our natural environment are integrally linked parts of the great mystery of life and death and that all nature must therefore be treated with respect. (3, emphases added) Notice that the far-ranging generalizations about prehistoric European beliefs are in both sentences linked to the evidence by the rhetorical?and logical?loopholes "seem" and "suggest." Notice too that the concrete evidence itself?"cave sanctuaries, figurines, burials"?is cleverly grouped with definitely ??-con crete "rites" for which little or no hard evidence remains and which thus have to be imaginatively reconstructed. Furthermore, this concrete evidence from a vast diversity of locales and time periods is here promiscuously lumped together and generalized into supporting "belief" in a Mother Goddess, when actually the highly heterogeneous evidence can bear numerous inter pretations?as we shall see. Finally, the "belief" Eisler describes ultimately has its origins in Western Romantic assumptions about nature, assumptions that Eisler projects back onto the diverse and fragmentary archaeological evidence. We don't know what our "ancestors" thought, but it's a good bet that they? dependent for their survival on an indifferent and fickle environ ment, and vulnerable to predators and natural forces they could not control?looked on nature with fear rather than with</page><page sequence="9">8o THE FALSE GODDESS AND HER LOST PARADISE the sentimental "respect" that a technology-protected, well-fed modern can afford. Throughout this section of her book Eisler laces her confident re-creations of prehistoric European society with rhetorical escape hatches and anachronistic projections. A few pages after the passage quoted above, Eisler damningly admits that "because of the scarceness of their remains and the long time span be tween us and them, we probably never will be entirely certain of the specific meaning their paintings, figurines, and symbols had for our Paleolithic forebears" (5). So why credit Eisler's asser tions about this "meaning" which forms the bulk of her book, let alone take seriously the portentous ameliorative benefits that endorsing it supposedly will bring? This entire section is filled with loopholes like: "seems," "appears," "seemingly," "believed by scholars," "possibly"?all recurring cop-outs revealing that the picture Eisler paints is?by her own admission, however unwittingly?highly speculative and takes great liberties with the available evidence. Yet in nearly every instance, the hedging allusion to the evidence is followed by a confident description of Old European society as though it were fact supported by that evidence. But of course, Eisler's re-creation of European prehistory is not so much based on factual evidence as it is a reflection of our old friend, the Western myth of a peaceful Golden Age disrupted by a wicked Iron Age, a myth Eisler cites, along with that New Age staple, the myth of Atlantis, as evidence for a real-life pre historic paradise (61-62). The key motif of the Golden Age myth, the harmony of humans with a beneficent nature that pro vides freely all of humanity's needs, dominates Eisler's recon struction of Old European society: "Indeed, this theme of the unity of all things in nature, as personified by the Goddess, seems to permeate Neolithic art. For here the supreme power governing the universe is a divine Mother who gives her people life, provides them with material and spiritual nourishment, and who even in death can be counted on to take her children back into her cosmic womb" (19; note again the sly shift from "seems" to "is"). In such a society the "primary purpose of art, and of life, was not to conquer, pillage, and loot but to cultivate</page><page sequence="10">Bruce Thornton 81 the earth and provide the material and spiritual wherewithal for a satisfying life" (20). And like the denizens of the Golden Age, the Old Europeans enjoyed "common ownership of the principal means of production" and a "basically cooperative social organi zation" (42). Needless to say, neither Eisler nor anybody else has any evidence for these fantastic idealizations, all of which reflect modern preoccupations and assumptions, particularly a vague socialist economics. They are projections gratifying the psychic needs of civilized moderns unable to confront the trade-offs material comfort and its production exact. 4. The Civilization of the Goddess What, according to Eisler, happened to this Golden Age para dise? It was destroyed by invasions of Indo-Europeans, whose war, political oppression, and greed became the awful prevailing consequences?precisely the same evils that the Iron Age myth identifies with civilization. The "blade" of domination and destruction gradually replaced the "chalice" of cooperation and love. Here we return to Marija Gimbutas who paints a similar picture. Like Eisler, her history of a Goddess civilization and its demise is ultimately derived from the inherited Western myth of the Golden Age instead of relying on the available material evidence.25 To the Goddess religion Marija Gimbutas is the Moses who brought back from the Sinai of empirical archaeology the truth of prehistory. Her magnum opus, The Civilization of the Goddess, presents the most extensive description of that lost world and its tutelary deity.26 This is a big, lavish book, crammed with photo graphs, charts, graphs, and technical apparatuses that create the perception of a mountain of empirical evidence establishing without a doubt the historical truth of the Goddess. Yet through out the book, fanciful interpretations and leaps beyond the evi dence are woven into factual scholarly descriptions of artifacts and sites. The result is a shaky edifice of question-begging, spe cial pleading, unexamined assumptions, and circular reasoning.</page><page sequence="11">82 THE FALSE GODDESS AND HER LOST PARADISE Gimbutas's Old European society is centered on the Goddess who represented "the sovereign mystery and creative power of the female as the source of life that developed into the earliest religious experiences." This "Great Mother Goddess . . . gives birth to all creation out of the holy darkness of her womb." She is the "metaphor for Nature herself, the cosmic giver and taker of life, ever able to renew Herself within the eternal cycle of life, death, and rebirth" (222). Because they lived in harmony with a maternal nature, the Old Europeans created a society in which women, as human versions of the life-creating Goddess, enjoyed high status and important political functions: "Old European society was organized around a theacratic, communal temple community, guided by a queen priestess, her brother or uncle, and a council of women as the governing body" (xi). Descent was matrilineal, and people en joyed "economic egalit?rianism." As in the Golden Age, when the earth was held in common,27 there were no economic hierarchies or fetishized private property (324). Peace characterized a society that was free from war, violence, and "territorial aggression" (326, 331). As Gimbutas summarizes, this society was "peaceful, sedentary, matrifocal, matrilineal, and sex [sic] egalitarian" (352).28 Just as the Golden Age degenerated into the Iron Age present of war, greed, and suffering, so starting in the fifth millennium B.C. Old Europe fell prey to the repeated invasions of the Indo European-speaking peoples Gimbutas calls the Kurgans, after their burial mounds. In contrast to the Old Europeans, the Kur gans were "warlike, patriarchal, and hierarchical" (352). They were restless horse-riding nomads, pastoralists who worshiped the ubiquitous wandering sun rather than the stable earth. They "glorified the magical swiftness of arrow and javelin and the sharpness of the blade"; and they "exulted in the making of weapons, not pottery or sculpture."29 They subordinated and despised women: "Females possessed inferior status, elevated only by association with their male relations" (395). Unlike the Old Europeans, who believed that death returned the individual "to the body of the Mother for regeneration within the womb of nature," Indo-Europeans believed that the individual lived on in</page><page sequence="12">Bruce Thornton 83 the underworld?an obvious origin for the West's destructive individualism (400). In sum, the Indo-European Kurgan culture was "warlike, exogamic, patriarchal, patrilineal, and patrilocal, with a strong clannish organization and social hierarchy which gave prominence to the warrior class" (396). They violently imposed war, domination, hierarchy, the glorification of material wealth, social stratification, slavery, and numerous other Iron Age evils on the paradisal Old Europeans. Numerous critics have challenged the value of this melodra matic interpretation of prehistory. Brian Hayden has questioned Gimbutas's "avalanche of highly subjective interpretation"; speaking of the artifacts Gimbutas offers as evidence of her the sis, he notes that "any attentive reader that examines the illustra tions [Gimbutas] provides to support her claims must be bothered at times by identifications and claims that seem to be verifiable only with the eye of faith."30 Brian Fagan agrees that Gimbutas's "form of analysis stretches scientific credibility beyond reasonable bounds." Her interpretations are "remark able for their uncritical subjectivity," and he too notes that "her image of Old Europe is uncannily similar to that of the Noble Savage so popular with nineteenth-century romantic novelists."31 Archaeologist Ruth Tringham likewise criticizes Gimbutas's "morass of unqualified interpretations and value-laden state ments."32 Mary Lefkowitz astutely notes the contemporary polit ical motivation behind Gimbutas's and other Goddess adherents' ahistoric interpretations of the prehistorical evidence: they are a "kind of pseudo-mystical mixing and matching of symbols and ideas that have nothing in common with each other except the contemporary use to which they may be put."33 So too Lynn Meskell, in a valuable critique of Goddess scholarship, argues that Gimbutas's vision of the past and "the interpretations it presents are simply hopeful and idealistic creations reflecting the contemporary search for a social utopia." She also points out that Gimbutas's "dating, methodology, testing, typological and statistical analyses have all come under fire, not to mention artis tic license and over-interpretation."34 All of these criticisms are moot once we understand that Gimbutas's work is, as Wood characterizes Goddess scholarship, "an exercise in creative his</page><page sequence="13">84 THE FALSE GODDESS AND HER LOST PARADISE tory";35 it represents a new version of the Golden Age myth and serves the same function: to offer solace for those psychically burdened with the complexities of civilization. Still, the Goddess scholars claim that this exposition of Old European culture and its destruction at the hands of Indo European invaders is not a religious myth but empirically estab lished history. (For a more nuanced, alternative picture of prehis tory that is not quite so free with the evidence, the reader should see the essays collected in The Oxford Illustrated Prehistory of Europe.)36 Two points should be kept in mind when reading Gimbutas. First, she generalizes about an extraordinary variety of cultures existing over an immense time-span in an equally var ious number of environments: from the Upper Paleolithic, about 30,000 years B.C., down to the gradual introduction of farming in the Neolithic, about 5,000 years B.c., a period that saw epochal environmental and technological transformations. That these changes had profound and specific impacts on all aspects of those prehistoric societies and cultures is obvious. Second, her entire discussion concerns pre-literate peoples; thus complex ritu als, rites, and social practices that left no written evidentiary trail are open to a modern myth-making not possible for ancient Egypt or Sumer or Greece. These general reservations noted, I want here to point to some specific instances of Gimbutas's faulty reasoning and focus on two key components of her theory: her claim that Old Europe was a peaceful paradise and her inter pretation of the female figurines which are the major evidence for the Goddess's attributes and meaning. Let's take one of the key assumptions of her argument, that prehistoric peoples would likely worship a creative Goddess on the analogy of human reproduction. "It was the sovereign mys tery and creative power of the female as the source of life that developed into the earliest religious experiences" (222). Further, "from the artifacts it seems clear that woman's ability to give birth and nourish children from her body was deemed sacred, and revered as the ultimate metaphor for the divine Creator" (223). In other words, Old Europeans, ignorant of the mechanics of reproduction and the male's role in conception, were awed by the mystical, earth-like power of woman to bring life out of her</page><page sequence="14">Bruce Thornton 85 body. Hence they worshiped the female procreative force and made it the basis of their religion and social organization. The presupposition here, of course, is that prehistoric peoples did not understand the role of the male in reproduction?which defies common sense. As Hayden points out, "It is naive to believe that groups intelligent enough to invent language, fire, clothes, complex technologies, and great art were so stupid that they could not make the associations between sex and reproduc tion."37 Surely over time these peoples would have noticed that women do not conceive when men do not ejaculate into them. Perhaps, then, that is why so many phalluses survive in prehis toric art?they represent the male power to provide visible seed for conception. If one were to adopt Gimbutas's method of argu ment, one could then assert that high prestige and awe attached to the male because he actively bestows the fertile seed on the passive woman, just as seeds must be buried in the earth for plants to grow. And if one followed Gimbutas's technique of using literary evidence from much later periods as support for assertions about prehistoric Europe, one could mention that this analogy between human reproduction and farming dominates later Greek thinking.38 One could then "prove" that the Old Europeans placed high value on males and afforded them com mensurate social prestige and power! Once Gimbutas has created this Goddess and her attributes out of this shaky assumption, she can then find in the artifacts, like Hamlet and Polonius looking at clouds, whatever evidence she needs to support her definition, in the process creating a fan tasy of circular argument to me curiously suggestive of one of M. C. Escher's self-consuming architectural constructions. Speak ing of the female figurines, for example, Gimbutas asserts that "the various shapes, gestures, and attributes portrayed on these sculptures, in addition to their provenance, lend themselves to a classification of types representing various aspects and functions of the Goddess" (222). Since the "aspects and functions" have already been deduced from the "shapes, gestures, and attributes," one cannot then use them as evidence that represent "aspects and functions." Again, she says that "the life- and birth-giving mother was anthropomorphic and zoomorphic. Her main epiphanies</page><page sequence="15">86 THE FALSE GODDESS AND HER LOST PARADISE were the deer, elk, and bear" (223). The reasoning proceeds some thing like this: The Goddess was zoomorphic. Why? Because sculptures of deer, elk, and bear exist. These sculptures are epiphanies of the Goddess. Why? Because the Goddess was zoo morphic. But of course, there are any number of explanations for sculptures of deer, elk, and bear, the obvious ones linking these artifacts to hunting?the male pursuit par excellence and one of humanity's oldest activities. Taking this assumption of a zoomorphic Goddess for granted, however, allows Gimbutas to pile up evidence from a vast variety of locales and times and cul tures, all balanced precariously on the rickety begged question. Having conjured her Goddess into being, she proceeds to find her in artifacts and motifs that require even more fanciful inter pretation. Consider the following: "The sacred animal of the Bird Goddess [a version of the Goddess] was the ram, which gained symbolic importance during the Early Neolithic when sheep became an important source of food and rams were needed for reproduction" (235). But why wouldn't the ram more obviously represent male reproductive power? If, as Gimbutas maintains, Old Europeans didn't understand the human male's role in reproduction, why make the horned ram an icon at all? Why not the maternal ewe? And why don't the ram and its phal lic horns, more obviously, represent the male sexual potency that the images attempt to exploit and control? Gimbutas also makes an astonishing leap with the so-called bucrania or "bull's heads" discovered all over the Near East and Europe: "The female womb with its fallopian tubes resembles the shape of a bull's head with horns, which may well account for the prevailing use of this motif to represent regeneration" (244). As archaeologist William Barnett points out, fallopian tubes "are barely visible upon dissection and have little cognitive connection to birth outside the realm of modern medicine."39 We are asked to believe that the same peoples who did not connect men's ejaculation with conception could nonetheless figure out the role in reproduction of the tiny fallopian tubes. Yet isn't all this fanciful interpretation unnecessary, the more obvious explanation for bucrania being that, like the ram, they and their phallic horns represent male sexual power as the power of regen</page><page sequence="16">Bruce Thornton 87 eration? Gimbutas's penchant for seeing the Goddess in every prehistoric sculpture or motif ultimately leads her to manifest absurdity. 5. Goddess, Whore, and Everything in Between The small sculptures called "Venus figurines" have been discov ered all across Europe from Russia to Spain. As Paul Mellars de scribes them, they are "small statuettes of rather well-developed (in some cases obese) female figures, with heavily accentuated sexual features and, usually, very attenuated or schematic repre sentations of the heads, arms, and feet."40 These statues have been discovered in caves and homes as well as the prehistoric equivalent of garbage dumps, and most date from around 20,000 years ago. These sculptures?an enormous variety discovered in coequally widespread locales and times?are for Gimbutas the central core of evidence in that they fully "represent various aspects and functions" of the "life-generating Goddess" who "personifies the eternally renewing cycle of life in all its forms and manifestations" (222). The most obvious?and, it should be noted, ubiquitous? criticism of her interpretation of them is that it is reductive and simplistic. It ignores the "striking" diversity, as Margaret Con key puts it, of Paleolithic art, a diversity of "media, subject matter, techniques, visual conventions, and spatiotemporal dis tributions."41 Moreover, Gimbutas's fixation on the Goddess leads her to ignore the numerous figurines that are either sexless or male: "There are probably just as many phalli," Brian Hayden points out, "in the Paleolithic as there are Venuses."42 Conse quently, Gimbutas is often forced to interpret figurines or motifs signifying males in terms of the Goddess, much as when she attempted to make what are most likely symbols of male sexual potency, such as a ram or a bull's head, represent aspects of the Mother Goddess. Then there is her unrealistically static?even frozen?sense of tradition. She sees a fixed continuity of the Goddess from the late Paleolithic to the Neolithic?a period of over ten thousand years.43 That a religious view could remain</page><page sequence="17">88 THE FALSE GODDESS AND HER LOST PARADISE unchanged during significant environmental changes (such as the retreat of the glacial sheet from northern Europe) and during the critical transition from hunting/gathering to farming defies com mon sense. Nor is it likely, in any case, that iconography would remain static for so long a time. As Lynn Meskell puts it, "To assume a priori that there is a Goddess behind every figurine is tantamount to interpreting plastic figures of Virgin Mary and of 'Barbie' as having identical ideological significance."44 As well as being reductive, Gimbutas is insensitive to the rela tions these artefacts must have had to their makers' lives. The relentless focus on fertility and sex, for example, bespeaks mod ern preoccupations that ancient peoples may have subordinated to equally pressing issues such as famine or disease.45 Likewise with the assumption that the figurines have some sort of sacred significance. How, it must be asked, does this square with the evidence that "most figurines are found broken and discarded as redeposited refuse"?46 It may testify to the ubiquity of the God dess, but perhaps "it demonstrates that these figures are not sacred at all; or they may have multiple meanings which change as a figure is made, used and discarded."47 Finally, as we saw above, Gimbutas depends on highly subjective, even arbitrary interpretations of detail and motif to make every figurine a rep resentation of the Goddess. Again, the presumption that every motif has a fixed meaning persisting over thousands of years and over a great variety of locales is unreasonable. Symbols and motifs?however perduring?change according to the aesthetic as well as religious needs of the people handling them. There are other objections. If the figurines represent a maternal fertility Goddess, for example, why are there no statuettes showing mothers giving birth or suckling?48 And then most of the figu rines are passive and abstract, their exaggerated sexual charac teristics inviting any number of interpretations. "In short," Peter Ucko summarizes, "it can be seen that the generally accepted Mother Goddess interpretation of prehistoric anthropomorphic figurines leaves several features of the figurines themselves wholly unexplained and, in addition, poses several theoretical problems of interpretation which it fails to solve."49 Other plausible interpretations of the statuettes have been made:</page><page sequence="18">Bruce Thornton 89 that they were prehistoric erotica; that they represented spirits of the house or home, or "pseudo-historical characters who formed part of the mythology or explanatory framework of the society"; that they were objects of sympathetic magic to insure fertility or pregnancy, the image discarded after it worked (or didn't);50 that perhaps they were "dolls, toys, tokens of identification, primitive contracts, communication," or "teaching devices, tools of sor cery, magic, healing, or initiation."51 Or maybe they were "items of ritualistic exchange between communities who . . . were dependent on wide ranging social and 'alliance' networks across large areas of the European continent."52 Timothy Taylor, arguing that the figurines appeared "at a time of growing eco nomic inequality between men and women," reads them not as the emblems of high female status, but rather as "part of a com plicated sexual culture that, through sexual objectification and censorship, created and maintained power imbalances between men and women."53 Ian Hodder links them to the household as the site of domestication of the wild, and the woman's ambigu ous role in that process: "The underlying theme linking activities and concepts within the domus, is the woman as transformer of wild into domestic?the woman as domesticator, or as domesti cated."54 Nearly all of these interpretations show a greater respect for the variety and diversity of the evidence than does Gimbutas's theory of a totalizing cult of the Goddess which, as Lefkowitz points out, "reduces all womankind to a genital iden tity."55 Even the feminist prehistorian Margaret Ehrenberg con cludes, "The likelihood of a significant continent-wide cult of a Mother Goddess has been greatly exaggerated."56 Once we see how fragile are the foundations for Gimbutas's Goddess, the "matricentered" social and cultural structure of Old Europe predicated on the Goddess's existence begins to tot ter also. Even if the figurines do represent female and natural fer tility, it does not follow that women had high status, any more than the numerous images of the Virgin Mary evidenced the political and social power of Renaissance European women. Andrew Sherratt notes of early farmers of the Later Neolithic and Copper Ages?the climax of Gimbutas's Golden Age?that "their ideals were expressed in images of female procreation and</page><page sequence="19">90 THE FALSE GODDESS AND HER LOST PARADISE abundance?even if women themselves bore most of the burdens of everyday life, and died after short lives exhausted by the work of cultivation and child-bearing."57 Once more it is the perennial complexity and ambiguity and contradictions of human exis tence and culture that are ignored in Gimbutas's recycling of the Golden Age myth. 6. The Prehistoric Iron Age Gimbutas's willed vision of a peaceful, egalitarian Old Europe is no more firmly substantiated by the evidence than is her inter pretation of the Venus figurines. Indeed, evidence of violence and intergroup conflict abounds throughout the whole period preceding the alleged Kurgan invasions. As Keeley notes, evi dence of violent death exists from several of the rare burials of earliest modern humans in central and western Europe, dating from 34,000 to 24,000 years ago.58 Violence between culturally differentiated groups probably arose out of increased competi tion for hunting grounds and other resources59 and evidence to support this has been discovered dating from the Mesolithic, the period of transition between the Upper Paleolithic and the Neo lithic (ca. 10,000-5,000 years ago), Gimbutas's heyday of the Goddess's Golden Age. Such evidence not only depicts violence, but also suggests cannibalism and human sacrifice.60 The remains of fortifications also belie the peaceful nature of Old Europe: "Defensive architecture such as palisades, ditches and earthen banks appear by the fifth millennium B.C. . . . and pre cede any evidence for [Kurgan] steppe intrusion, no matter how generously interpreted."61 In sum, the many weapons that have been discovered, from arrow-points to maces, as well as the remains of fortifications in many sites all testify to the reality of intergroup violence during this period of presumed peace and tranquillity. But what about social organization? Was Old Europe as egali tarian and free of dominating hierarchies as Gimbutas, Eisler, and others assert? Once more, evidence suggests otherwise. The persistence of hunting throughout this period implies not just a</page><page sequence="20">Bruce Thornton 91 penchant for and technology of violence (since any weapon that can kill an animal can kill a man), but also implies the existence of castes and a developed hierarchical organization. Speaking of the Upper Paleolithic hunter/gatherers, Paul Mellars argues "that almost any social system which involved the regular formation of relatively large and stable social units would have required some form of division of authority or ranking within the societies, if only to provide the necessary degree of integration and co ordination of the activities of the groups as a whole (as, for example, in the organization of communal hunting activities)."62 Success at hunting could have been a source of higher status in the community, as suggested by grave goods discovered in Meso lithic cemeteries?three of which "contain evidence for vertical social differentiation, indicating that the first ranked societies of Europe appeared during the Mesolithic."63 David Anthony says of later cemeteries in the east Balkans, the center of Gimbutas's Old European Golden Age, that they "contain clear evidence of hierarchical status differences, and the richest sexable graves are of males."64 The same environmental and demographic pres sures that made warfare likely would also have insured that those males adept at the physical violence and leadership which secured game and protected resources would have enjoyed higher prestige and power.65 In this context of competition for re sources and the struggle to maintain living standards, it is hard to credit Gimbutas's picture of peaceful and egalitarian societies able to secure sufficient nutrition and security without conflict, coercive authority, and violence. Finally, like the idealizers of the Indian or of pre-agricultural peoples, Gimbutas ignores the everyday hardships and suffering that all human life endured before modern medical and agricul tural technology. Apart from war and violence, people suffered from diseases like arthritis, caries, and rickets, not to mention infections from broken bones and even mild wounds, and they were attacked by parasites and bacteria spawned by tainted food and water. The daily use of fire created conditions for accidents and painful wounds. Women particularly were vulnerable to complications in pregnancy and childbirth, and probably bore a greater toll from the hard physical labor necessary to ensure sur</page><page sequence="21">92 THE FALSE GODDESS AND HER LOST PARADISE vival. Insects, unseasonable storms, blight, drought, and fluctua tions in animal herd populations frequently created famines that killed many people and weakened others, leaving them even more vulnerable to disease. The fury of nature and its predators must have been a constant source of anxiety and danger, as were superstitious fears of occult and supernatural forces. In short, the destructive contingencies of human existence from which modern Westerners are protected by technology and wealth, shortened life for our ancestors and made it hard and dangerous?a far cry from the rosy picture painted by Gimbutas, Eisler, and others who take for granted a level of nutrition, material comfort, and personal safety impossible in ancient times. Gimbutas's theory about the Kurgan invasion of Indo-Euro pean-speaking warriors who destroyed this once-peaceful culture is equally suspect. Colin Renfrew challenged many of the assumptions that have gone into the popular depiction of Indo Europeans, and offered an alternative model: the gradual diffu sion of Indo-European-speaking farmers from Anatolia replaces the more melodramatic saga of bloodthirsty, horse-riding killers swarming, like cattle-baron gunslingers in a grade-B western, out of the steppes in order to ravage and conquer the peaceful Old European farmers.66 J. P. Mallory also finds Gimbutas's theory dubious, noting that "almost all of the arguments for invasion and cultural transformations are far better explained without reference to Kurgan expansions, and most of the evidence pre sented is either totally contradicted by other evidence or is the result of gross misinterpretation of the cultural history of East ern, Central, and Northern Europe."67 Though genetic studies have not completely verified Renfrew's model, one recent study has concluded that "the long-distance migrations postulated by Gimbutas . . . are not reflected in the current genetic structure of Indo-European populations."68 In short, like the myth of a Golden Age Old Europe the theory of invading hordes of Indo Europeans is at best an oversimplification of some nugget of his torical reality, at worst pure fantasy.</page><page sequence="22">Bruce Thornton 93 7. Therapeutic Melodrama?Again Goddess history offers a gratifying myth in the guise of empiri cal fact?a combination of scientism and debased Romanticism. Indeed, the origins of Goddess religions can be found not in the new discoveries of archaeological science but in the nineteenth century's anti-Enlightenment pique. It was then that theories of matriarchy arose out of a welter of "neopagan occultism and the radical feminist political agenda."69 The writer J. J. Bachofen is often claimed as an intellectual ancestor of modern Goddess scholarship, and he must be understood in the context of nine teenth-century middle-class estimations of women as superior vessels of intuitive insight and nurturing power.70 David An thony has pointed out the nineteenth-century roots of the Indo European invasion myth in German Romanticism.71 Then, of course, the Aryan invaders were the good guys bearing the gifts of civilization to European subhumans sunk in barbarism. We all know the horrific racist outcome of that distortion of history. And as Anthony points out, modern Goddess religion has endorsed the same fundamental myth: "Both interpretations share the same theoretical and logical form; it is only a politi cally motivated reversal of the 'good' and the 'bad' that separates them."72 Like the myth of Aryan superiority, the myth of wicked Indo-Europeans destroying a paradisal Old Europe is a piece of pernicious false knowledge. This myth is dangerous for two reasons. First, since it is a reli gious myth disguised as scientific fact, it distorts our historical understanding by presenting fanciful conjectures as empirically verified facts, thus obtaining for the former the authority and prestige of the latter. Moreover, the rational process by which we ultimately establish the truths of history is compromised by the admission of irrational "intuition" or "feeling" as the war rantors of truth. By these criteria, anything can be touted as true. Finally, a false picture of the human condition is presented, one in which the tragic limitations of all humans, their subjec tion to a world of contingency and chance as well as to their own destructive passions, are wished away. We are left with impossible solutions for our problems, and Utopian fantasies</page><page sequence="23">94 THE FALSE GODDESS AND HER LOST PARADISE that can only gratify our inauthentic desire that the world and ourselves be other than they are. Next, as Denfeld points out in the epigraph to this essay, the Goddess religion and its myths deflect energy and attention away from the real problems pressing women today. As Eliza beth Kristol has written, "Social groups that are confronted with political, cultural, and economic challenges are embracing Utopian visions in a vain effort to comfort themselves in the present moment."73 Those challenges will be best confronted from within the Western tradition of Enlightenment liberalism and rationalism that more than anything in history have improved the lot of women fortunate enough to be born in soci eties shaped by that tradition. To deny that truth and demonize, in the name of emotionally gratifying myth and fantasy, the very tradition that has made it possible for women today to live long and productive lives, that has liberated women from the drudg ery of physical labor and the tyranny of biology, that has given them political rights and privileges still denied to masses of women today?to reject the Western traditions that have made the minds and bodies of these Goddess-worshipers what they are?is to indulge a specious knowledge rendered even more noxious by hypocrisy and ingratitude.
