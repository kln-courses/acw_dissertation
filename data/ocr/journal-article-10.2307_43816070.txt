<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Antecedents of Man. By W. E. Le Gros Clark. (Edinburgh University Press; 21s.) The author of this text-book (on the comparative anatomy of living and extinct members of the Order Primata ) is a world authority in his subject, and the book is truly magisterial. In it Sir Wilfrid has modified and expanded the Munro Lectures which he gave in 1953 in the University of Edinburgh under the title The Palaeontology of the Pr√¨mates and the Problem of Human Ancestry . After two general chapters, the first dealing with the nature of the evolutionary process with particular reference to primates,</page><page sequence="2">440 BLACKFRIARS the second with a preliminary survey of the Order in space and time, he takes the major systems of the body in turn and gives detailed accounts of the comparative anatomy of each. The concluding chapter deals with the evolutionary radiations that are to be detected in the group as a whole. It is in keeping with the general plan of the book that the history of the emergence of the family Hominidae , of which Homo sapiens is the only sur- viving member, is restricted to the last seven pages of the book, apart from brief references in the systematic chapters. Perhaps the story of the Homi- nidae is being saved, to provide a book on its own : there are still some curious gaps in the fossil sequence, but Australopithecus has been a discovery of the very first importance in recent years, and Oreopithecus promises to be even more exciting. But the method adopted here, of presenting the Order in all its variety, is bound to give the impression (possibly intended by the author) that Man is no more than an aberrant offshoot from the general primate stock, an epiphenomenon of no more, if of no less, interest than any of the others. Despite all the careful marshalling of facts, then, and the brilliantly succinct descriptions of anatomical variations between living (and extinct) tree-shrews, lemurs, tarsiers, monkeys, apes and men, an air of futility sits depressingly over the book. By the scientifically orthodox this will be commended as a virtue, and for non-scientists it will serve as an excuse for not reading it. This feature makes the book both 'scientific' and 'safe*. It takes courage, these days, to run the risk in biological circles of being thought of as 'anthropomorphic' in outlook. This, to some of us, is an absurd situation, for what is science if it is not an affair of men ? Sir Wilfrid has taken care to avoid any such charge, but in shirking all consideration of the problems of teleology and of meaning (in the wide sense) he has introduced a certain randomness into the book itself: the last page happens to be fully occupied with text, and it was a tremendous shock, on turning over, to realize that this was the end both of a chapter and indeed of the book. At the price, this must be the best value in scientific books for a long time - the many excellent line-drawings alone make one think in much more expensive terms. The author says that 'publication has been assisted by a generous grant from the Munro Lectureship Committee'. It must have been munificent. Bernard Towers</page></plain_text>
