New York: Routledge, 2008. Pp. xxii, 264. $30.95, paper. ISBN 978-0- 415-41424-1. This book fosters knowledge and skills in the field of language analysis. To achieve this goal, the authors offer a well-structured compilation of theoretical material, together with a complete corpus of activities, different types of texts, and well-reasoned comments and answers to these activities. The volume not only brings together the main developments in linguistic studies with a focus on language corpora and</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 501 computer-mediated communication, but it also provides the basis for correct and adequate text analysis. Its seven units focus on a different lin- guistic feature to offer a complete view of how distinct types of analyses are carried out depend- ing on each area of language: "Signs," "Sounds," "Words and Things," "Sentences and Structure," "Text and Context: Written Discourse," "Text and Context: Spoken Discourse," and "Applications." This book bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and useful practice in the field of lin- guistic analysis, which makes it a valuable resource for those interested in teaching or in widening their understanding of the linguistic skills needed to conduct successful analyses. The introductory section presents the aims and structure of the different chapters. Chapter 1 fo- cuses on signs and how written texts contain more than printed words. The book offers clear exam- ples to make theoretical content easier and more accessible, and it combines theory with activities and samples of texts. It covers aspects such as the definition and types of signs, visual examples, and how they represent levels of shared knowledge within a culture. The authors introduce defini- tions and explanations of key terms (e.g., sym- bolism, anthropomorphism, representation, ini- tialism). It also deals with how "individuals bring their own experiences and feelings to different images" and signs and how signs include ideas behind them depending on many factors (p. 7) . This thought is strongly linked to the universal- ity of signs, which also figures into the theoretical explanations. Chapter 2 deals with sounds, considered as the "basis of speech" (p. 37). This chapter is pre- sented as an exploration of the relationship be- tween sounds and texts, as well as introducing the International Phonetic Alphabet, the notion of Received Pronunciation, and the basics of phonet- ics. This chapter explains the arbitrary relation- ship between sounds and the symbols represent- ing them. Activities include transcription, working out words represented by symbols, and identifying several aspects of speech. Commentaries and an- swers to the displayed activities are closely linked to theoretical content, clarifying examples or ex- cerpts from texts, as well as including illustrative personal experiences and comments. Extension activities enable students to continue practicing and to check their understanding of the material. Chapter 3 presents the relationships between words and things, as well as the distinct mean- ings that can arise depending on those relation- ships and that help to explain such concepts as metaphor, denotation, connotation, taboo, and euphemism. According to the authors, "the anal- ysis of a text usually starts at the level of the word" (p. 59), which makes readers "look more closely at the way words work within texts" (p. 59) . There is also a detailed definition of word and other smaller units, such as free, bound, inflectional, and derivational morphemes. Chapter 4 presents patterns of English gram- mar. Grammar is defined as the central resource and, therefore, the fundamental means that al- lows humans to make and communicate mean- ing. In their presentation of textual units and patterns, authors advance the idea that "there are patterns of grammar across the whole text" (p. 105) . The chapter contains a description of ba- sic units such as subject, object, and verb, as well as the connections among them that allow sen- tences to have meaning. At the end of the chapter, the description of verb features promotes a sound understanding of active or passive meanings in sentences. Chapter 5, "Text and Context: Written Dis- course," deals with some of the language devices that "enable whole written texts to work" (p. 141). This chapter introduces discourse analysis, which considers the way "texts work across the bound- aries of single sentences" (p. 141). The chapter treats issues and patterns such as both lexical and grammatical cohesion, anaphor, substitution, and ellipsis, together with an abundant set of clarify- ing examples, activities, and commentaries. The end of the unit is devoted to presenting differ- ent grammatical structures and distinct sentence functions. The companion chapter 6, "Text and Context: Spoken Discourse," studies speech events, which the authors understand as language used by speak- ers to give information and ideas, express emo- tions or intentions, or do other things. Funda- mental issues such as the politeness principle and the parameters guiding conversations among hu- man beings are also presented. The social side of conversation along with the maxims that rule suc- cessful communication are also taken into consid- eration. Computer-mediated communication and some of its rules are discussed in this chapter to illustrate the links between speech and the In- ternet. The authors also provide guidelines for readers' research, focusing on collecting speech, media dialogues, and transcription. "Applications," the last chapter, is devoted to guidance on next steps in the "development of analytical skills" (p. 247) following this text, which is a first course in language analysis. The chapter contains recommendations on reference materials, and it presents ideas on what should or</page><page sequence="3">502 The Modern Language Journal 94 (2010) should not be included in future analyses. This is a valuable volume for newcomers to linguistic analysis, and it provides solid guidance for read- ers who would like to conduct analyses of different aspects of language.
