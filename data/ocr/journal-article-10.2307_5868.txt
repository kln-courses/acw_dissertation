As someone who only comparatively rarely ven- tures into first-hand research involving animal behav- iour, I found much of value in this book, as I am sure undergraduates and graduates would too. However, it would be interesting to be able to ask Charles Dar- win for his own thoughts! PAUL M. BRAKEFIELD C. A. Spinage (1994) Elephants. Pp. xvi+319. T. &amp; A. D. Poyser Ltd, London, UK ?25. ISBN 0-85661-088-7. Although it is not apparent from the book itself, this is one of a series of natural history volumes, which Poyser has recently taken over from the previous pub- lishers. There has been a rash of elephant books over the last decade and one might ask what is new about this one. As far as the biology of the elephant is con- cerned, there is nothing that is not already well known, but in the degree of detail of the history of man's relationship with elephants, this book is unique. Dr Spinage has one of the best private collections of books on elephants and there is little that he does not known about them. His approach is scholarly and meticulous and one can be sure that if he gives a date in antiquity it will be the correct one. Similarly, one can rely on biological information being factually accurate. It is a pity, therefore, that the text is not referenced in the usual way to enable the reader to follow up some of the assertions made. If the omission of references is the policy of the series editor, then the book is not appropriate to the series. There are full, although not exhaustive, chapter by chapter reference lists at the back of the book, but it is not always clear to which publication a particular statement refers as the names of the researchers are not given (unless they have died, preferably at least a century ago!). In some cases with which I am familiar, the appropriate ref- erence is not cited in the bibliography. The book is divided into 15 chapters that combine biological and historical detail. The first chapter, which deals with the evolution of the order Probos- cidea, is one of the least satisfactory and I wonder if a reader unfamiliar with the subject would feel fully informed. A few illustrations of members of the extinct families would have helped to make the various relationships clearer. Some statements are misleading if not incorrect, e.g. 'The mastodons of the family Mammutidae were allied to the true elephants rather than to the mammoths.' Surely the woolly mammoth was a true elephant? The anatomy and physiology of the elephant are dealt with competently, with little nuggets of detail, such as the record weight of a gall stone. The chapter on reproduction is slightly more anthropomorphic than one would expect from a scien- tist, and it is a pity that the modern trend is followed of not distinguishing between 'suck' and 'suckle'. The life history and disease risks occupy a couple of chap- ters and a third is devoted to the elephant's social life. This is a reliable and up-to-date account although I wonder if 'incontinence' is an altogether accurate word to describe the dribbling of urine by the musth male. This probably is not involuntary but has the function of advertising the elephant's reproductive status. A chapter on feeding leads into the puzzling question of tree destruction by elephants. The author considers the various possible reasons but, perhaps wisely, does not decide in favour of any particular hypothesis. Over-population is probably a factor and several case histories are considered, although it might have been better to have discussed these after, rather then before, the chapter on population dynamics. There are two excellent chapters on ivory and the ivory trade, which, as one might expect, are covered in great detail. The final chapter is concerned with the domestication of elephants and shows that the African species is every bit as trainable as the Asian. It is indeed surprising that more use has not been made of African elephants for transporting national parks' visitors on game-viewing trips. The book is well illustrated with pleasing line draw- ings by Larry Norton, who has also contributed an evocative painting for the frontispiece of a huge tusker. There are many black and white photographs scattered throughout the book as well as a group of coloured plates. Since only a few of these carry attributions, the others are presumably by the author, who is well known as an accomplished photographer. This is a distinguished contribution to the literature on elephants. It is well written and a pleasure to read, with the factual information laced with anecdotal detail. This enlivens the text even though there may be some repetition, e.g. the story about the slaughter of the Asian bull by cannon shot in Geneva in 1820, which is recounted on p. 73 and again on p. 273. The book is full of reliable information and can act as a reference volume as well as a text to be read through from beginning to end, but anyone dipping into it to check a fact is likely to submit to temptation and continue reading far beyond the original page consulted. An additional bonus is that by today's standards, it is relatively cheap. It can be thoroughly recommended. S. K. ELTRINGHAM D. Brown &amp; P.

This book covers a wide range of biological models, experimental design and data analysis. The book is aimed at undergraduates in biomathematics, but will be of use to any biologists wishing to learn modelling skills and/or analytical techniques. Following an introduction, which clearly outlines different types of models used in biology, the book is split into five parts. Part I concentrates on models for single populations and processes. Deterministic models incorporating growth and decline of popu- lations and individuals and genetics are dealt with first. Stochastic models follow, with the final chapter in this part concentrating on the statistical fitting of such models to data. Part II is concerned with bio- logical comparisons and design issues. Comparisons of two or more populations or processes are presented first, followed by a chapter on experimental design and data collection. Biological interactions are dealt with in Part III. The first chapter in this section is a mathematical introduction into models of inter- actions. Chapters on biochemical and physiological processes, and large-scale ecological and epi- demiological patterns follow. This section ends with a chapter on model fitting of generalized linear, non- linear and dynamic stochastic models. Part IV con- tains subjects the authors were unable to cover else- where and is entitled 'Advanced Topics'. There are chapters on transport and diffusion, patterns in time and space, sequence analysis, multiple regression and neural networks. Part V is a glosary of mathematical terms, tables, references and an index. Each issue is dealt with in a similar way; as an exam- ple I will concentrate on the analysis of series of point events in space and time. Initially, examples are given of the type of data that can be collected. In this case the distribution of different species of ground-nesting ducks' nests in a lake, firing pattern of an oxytocin magnocellular neurosecretory cell and the locations of tree seedlings in space. There then follows a section on the description and detection of spatial patterns, starting with complete spatial randomness and moving through a catalogue of spatial distributions. Next fol- lows a section on Monte Carlo simulation tests for spatial patterns. Finally, the initial data on the spacing of ground-nesting ducks is analysed. The authors refer the reader to sources of data, and more advancd work concerning the analysis of point patterns. The book is clearly written, with useful examples chosen to clarify methods and techniques. Each chapter ends with example exercises; unfortunately, solutions to these problems are not included in the book. Not surprisingly in a book of this scope there are some omissions; maximum likelihood estimation is not included in the chapter on non-linear model fitting. Multivariate statistics are not covered and treatment of genetic analysis is limited. However, the book includes innovative techniques; the graphical analysis of deviance in multiple regression models is especially elegant. The title suggests that computing would be dealt with more thoroughly than it is. The construction of simulation models is dealt with briefly. A supplement can be purchased which gives code to solve specific problems in Phaseplane, Minitab, SAS and Genstat. This supplement will only be of use to people with reasonable knowledge of these packages. Models in Biology covers a very wide field. Intro- ductions to the individual components, statistics, modelling and computing are each well-treated inde- pendently in other texts. Brown and Rothery generally tie the three aspects together clearly, and as an intro- duction for those new to both modelling and statistics Models in Biology should prove useful: at less than ?25, it has to be a recommended buy.

Peter Cotgreave's paper with Paul Harvey 'Evenness of abundance in bird communities' (Vol. 63, pp. 365-374) arose from his PhD thesis conducted at Oxford. His research asked whether evenness of abundance in bird communities was'associated with traits of the component species and with the environment. The results suggested that competition may provide an explanation for patterns of evenness. After a years post-doctoral fellowship in Lyon, Peter returned to Oxford, working initially in the AFRC/NERC Behavioural Ecology Unit and then as a lecturer in Ornithology. Recently, he has moved to the Institute of Zoology, at the Zoological Society of London, to take up a position as a Conservation Biologist and Programme Development Officer. 794 Book Reviews</page></plain_text>
