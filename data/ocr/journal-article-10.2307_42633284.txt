<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philippine Studies 39 (1991): S3&amp;-44 Book Reviews LIBERALISM AND THE QUEST FOR ISLAMIC IDENTITY IN THE PHILIPPINES. By Kenneth E. Bauzon. Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press/Durham, N.C., U.S.A.: The Acorn Press, 1991. xx, 219 pages. The author sees the conflict between the Philippine Government and the Philippine Muslim minority as centered on the problem of national iden- tity (or "nationality formation" as he calls it). For Muslims nationality is de- termined by membership in the religious community of Muhammad, for non-Muslims normally by allegiance to a particular sovereign state. In a country where Islam is the state religion the citizenship status of non-Mus- lims is limited, since they are not qualified to share in making or admini- stering laws or to occupy office in the government. In this situation the Qur'ân (9: 29) also obliges Jews and Christians to pay a special poll-tax and to be "humiliated." The Shari'ah (Sacred Law), when ideal conditions per- mit its full application, specifies this "humiliation" as the wearing of dis- tinctive clothing and other forms of discrimination. The notion that "objectivity in social research is fiction" (p. ix) is illus- trated in Chapter Two which describes "certain beliefs purveyed by scho- lastics and mystics" as supernaturalism. "Supernaturalism premises that God manifests Himself . . . through some form of magical act . . . (as in 'mir- acle') ... in violation of a natural order. . . ." The correct type of religion, according to Bauzon, is that in which "neither a prophet nor a saint would be obliged to persuade God [by magical means) to reveal Himself, because God is already revealed through His creation" (pp. 19-20). The principle, "Sovereignty resides in the people," stated in Art. 2, first section, of the Philippine Constitution and in Jefferson's axiom, "Govern- ments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed," sums up the political philosophy of Bellarmine and Suarez. This in turn supposes a participation by the people, civilly united, in the absolute sovereignty of God. But Bauzon follows the conservative Muslim theologians who would reject any such participation by a human agency. For them God's power must be the immediate authority behind all authority in the civil state. In conservative Muslim theory the people have no part in transferring this</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 539 authority to an individual or a group for its actual use, even though the ruler may claim to rule in their name. "In the absence of a transcendental being at the top of the hierarchy, ... the logical culmination was the inau- guration of the state vested with authority in the name of the community or nation. . . ." (p. 161). The ruler is urged to engage in consultation ( shūrā , Qur. 3: 159/153 and 42: 38/36) with the community, but he does not have to follow their advice. 'The people are sovereign but their sovereignty is restricted by God because He assumes ultimate authority over them" (p. 30). Briefly, in Bauzon's theory, as in conservative Muslim teaching, the will of the people can never be the determining force of the government. In speaking of Ibn Sina's metaphysics Bauzon says, "He postulated that in every being existence and essence are separated" (p. 27). This should be reworded as "He postulated that in every [finite] being existence and es- sence are really distinct." In saying (p. 23) "the Tasawwufs . . . denied the value of meditation," the author seems to take them for persons. The term tasaurwuf means the act of devoting oneself to the mystical life. Far from denying the value of meditation, its practitioners were criticized by their opponents - among them Ibn Hanbal, the famous jurist - for overemphasiz- ing meditation at the expense of prescribed oral prayer. Ibn Rushd (Averoes) is cited as upholding "ta'wil (reason) over the literal interpretation of the revealed texts" (p. 49). The word ta'wil means, not reason, but the allegori- cal interpretation of the Qur'an used by the Mu'tazilites to oppose anthropomorphism. Dhimmi (p. 147) is not an equivalent of "people of the Book," but signifies a free non-Muslim subject living in a Muslim country. "People of the Book" is a Muslim term for people (Jews and Christians) having a Scripture which Muslims recognize as divinely revealed. The author has devoted much work to advocating Muslim separatism, but much of it is not careful work. Thomas J. O'Shaughnessy, S.J. Loyola School of Theology</page></plain_text>
