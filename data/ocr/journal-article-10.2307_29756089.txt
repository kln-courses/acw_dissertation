<plain_text><page sequence="1">Report on the Excavations at Aligrama (Swat, Pakistan) 1966, 1972 by Giorgio Stacul and Sebastiano Tusa During his explorations in the Swat Valley (Pakistan), Prof. G. Tucci discovered a proto historic graveyard near the village of Aligr?ma, about 6 km. NW of Mingora (figs. 1, 22). The structure of some of the graves which were in part damaged, as well as the remains of tomb furnishings appearing on the surface, recalled chronological and cultural horizons documented in other cemeteries in the Sw?t Valley which have been systematically exca? vated by the Italian Archaeological Mission of IsMEO(1). The Aligrama graveyard extends for several hundred metres N of the village of the same name, on ground which slopes gently towards the gravel-bed of the Sh?hdheri Khwar, a stream with low banks which crosses a rather wide valley and then flows into the Swat River (fig. 1). On the way up the valley of the Sh?hdheri Khwar in a northwesterly direction, towards the mountain chain which divides the Sw?t region from that of Dir, Prof. Tucci was able to distinguish other graves relating to the above-mentioned horizons. They were in the loca? lity of Nasrat, about 8 km. from Aligr?ma, on a low hill on the left of the Sh?hdheri Khwar, and in the locality of Arkot Qila, about 12 km. from Aligr?ma, on the slopes of the hill which rises on the right side of the same stream (fig. 1). As a result of these ob? servations, the ground in the area around Aligr?ma was thoroughly explored, since it was thought probable that this zone played an important part both in migration and in settlement in certain protohistoric periods. In the spring of 1966, during surface explorations on a hill above the township of Ali? gr?ma, which rises about 100 m. above the valley floor level (fig. 20), the present writer was able to gather in various spots a great many fragments of red and grey pottery. These were able to be identified with types which were quite common in previously explored protohistoric cemeteries in the Sw?t and nearby valleys. In the same area remains of walls (*) The drawings are by the architect Dr L. Mariani; photographs in figs. 41, 57-60, 63-74, 76-97, 99, 101, 102 are by Mrs Francesca Tucci Bonardi, figs. 98, 100, 104 by Mr Giovanni Sil vestrini, figs. 20-38, 42-56, 61, 62, 75, 103 by Giorgio Stacul, figs. 39, 40 by Sebastiano Tusa.

Similar evidence could be gathered both on the lower slopes of the hillside and on the summit, which commands quite a vast zone of the Swat and Sh?hdherl Khwar Valleys (figs. 21, 22). At the time it seemed significant that the archaeological remains appeared especially in the hilly area which was covered with vegetation (wild olive, shrubs, etc.) (figs. 23, 25-27). This was explained by the hypothesis that the vegetation grew on soil which was rich in humus as a result of the accumulation of organic residue owing to prolonged human settlement. An excavation project was drawn up which began in 1966, was taken up again in 1972 and 1973, and which still continues. In these campaigns the trenches A, B, C, D were dug. Here we give the results of trench A (1966) and trench B (1972), whereas the results of trenches C and D (1973) are to be published in Pakistan Archaeology (in the press) (2).

General plan of the excavations (trenches A and B).</page><page sequence="4">The Excavation of Trench A (1966) This first trial-trench was made in the spring of 1966 on the side of the hill which slopes gently down towards the valley floor (figs. 2, 25, 26). The excavation, which straight away brought to light remains of masonry structures, floors, and archaeological objects, con? tinued to be expanded until it reached a total length of 14 m. (fig. 3). Beginning from the bottom, we shall now describe the stratigraphy of the site (fig. 4) and the subsequent pha? ses of construction which are attested here. The first evidence of human settlement is found in a soil which is relatively compact, dark-brown or grey-brown in colour, with abundant charcoal residue in certain places (layer 0). This layer has been formed above a greyish-whitish, solid, stony conglomerate (layer ?). A single wall, which rests on layer ?, attests the earliest phase of construction which has come to light in this area (wall /) (fig. 4). It is not preserved for more than 0.30 m. in height under the floor level of room 1 (figs. 3, 4, 29). There is greater evidence for a second phase of construction. This is attested by two circular pits (pits 1 and 2) and two quadrangular rooms (rooms 1 and 2). The pits go down as far as layer ? (figs. 32-35), while the other building structures rest on layer ?. A floor level in reddish clay extends over the whole surface area of room 1, and also over wall / (see section, fig. 4). Another floor level in reddish clay can be recognized at the bottom of room 2. The most recent phase of construction is documented by a large, nearly rectangular room (room 3) (fig. 28). At the bottom of it, near the corners contained between the walls a, b, c, and d, are to be found traces of a whitish clay floor. A thickness of about 0.45 m., corresponding to layer ?, separates the floor level of room 3 from the floor of room 2 below. Layer ? is light grey in colour, not very compact, and contains stones of various di? mensions. Layer ?, which is much stonier, is made up of greyish earth mixed with abun? dant fallen material. Layer ? is yellowish-greyish in colour and its upper part corresponds with the vegetal soil. As regards the building structures which have come to light, it is to be emphasized that these are always dry-stone walls, built of irregularly-shaped blocks of stone, between which are often placed either whole pebbles or pieces of pebbles, water-smoothed and pre? sumably gathered from the nearby river-bed of the Swat. It is precisely because of this lack of specific features in the material, and the lack of particular expedients in the choice, the cutting and the arrangement of the stones, that we are not able to distinguish in the various types of masonry mentioned different building techniques. Although some of the structures are clearly subsequent to others, those belonging to the different phases all express a very similar building technique, substantially simple and rudimentary. 294</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 3 - Aligr?ma. General plan of the excavation of trench A. Fig. 4 - Aligr?ma. Stratigraphic section of the excavation of trench A. As has been mentioned, the excavation also uncovered two circular pits both lined with dry-stone masonry-work similar to that described above. Their purpose is not clear for the moment. On the whole, the finds discovered in them were few. In pit 1 the soil of the filling became increasingly sandier and finer towards the bottom, but this does not seem sufficient proof that it was intended to be a well for the conservation of water. The bottom of pit 1 was covered with thin schist slabs (fig. 34), while the bottom of pit 2 consisted of natural soil (layer ?). At the bottom of layer ?, near pit 2, was localized a hearth, more or less circular with a diameter of more than 2.00 m. Potsherds of large vases have been found in great quantities all around (figs. 30, 31). Another, smaller hearth was found at the bottom of layer ?, in room 3, near wall d. In all the layers the quantity of animal bones, presumably left over from meals, were particularly scarce (only about thirty or so could be identified). This circumstance could be 295</page><page sequence="6">due to the fact that the inhabitants deposited similar leftovers in rubbish dumps existing for that very purpose, outside the area where our excavation was carried out. However, it is significant that a similar scarcity of bone fragments was met with in all the layers that document the subsequent occupation periods of the site. G. S. The Excavation of Trench B (1972) The excavation of trench B was carried out during the second campaign in autumn 1972 (3). The site of this trench is a short distance east of, and slightly lower than, the preceding one (fig. 2). The excavation site is situated in a narrow, relatively long strip of alluvial deposit between two small streams which flow together further down the valley and separate this strip from similar deposits in the. form of long, narrow strips of earth all along the hillsides on either side of the River Swat, in a perpendicular direction to it. This area is therefore in the middle of a natural "theatre" formed by the surrounding contours and open only towards the river (fig. 27). Before beginning the excavation at the Aligr?ma site we proceeded to mark out the site in a geodetic grid according to the rotating three-letter system. The grid contains not only the area immediately surrounding the excavation site but also a large part of the surrounding hills and the protohistoric graveyard, which extends along the southern slope of the hill rising above the excavation area to the south. The excavation has a surface area of 256 sq.m. contained in four squares 10 X 10 m. (figs. 5, 6). In the excavation appeared a complex of superimposed structures, belonging, as we shall see, to three phases. Above this, after the abandonment of the site, three subsequent alluvial deposits (?, ?, ?a) extend over the structures, destroying them to a high degree; the depth of the deposits varies according to the particular morphology of the pre? existing terrain. The ground on which the earliest structures arose (fig. 11) consists of a whitish conglomerate, not very compact but very hard, on which the first settlers of the area constructed their dwellings, using a series of technical devices in order to adapt their re? quirements to the particular morphology of the terrain. At the time of building the first structures, the slope of the terrain to the south was much more marked in respect of the present-day level. In fact, the conglomerate in the northern part of the excavation (IMG (3) The second excavation campaign at Ali gr?ma took place in 1972 from 20th September to 20th October. Members of the mission, under the leadership of Prof. G. Stacul, were Mrs F. Tucci Bonardi, photographer, the architect Dr L. Mariani, draughtsman, and the author. The inspec? tor of the Excavation Branch of the Archaeological Department of Pakistan, Mr M. Siddique, was of great help to us. I am particularly grateful to Prof. G. Tucci, President of IsMEO, and to Dr D. Faccenna for having assisted me with very useful advice and recommendations. I should also like to thank Prof. G. Stacul for having given me the chance of benefiting from his experience and knowledge of the protohistoric antiquities of Swat. 296</page><page sequence="7">_?iL- - -^^^ V^^/ 05~0 1 2m ?j?

This drop in level is not gradual throughout the above-mentioned stretch of ground, but is notably concentrated near the longer of the walls uncovered, the EW wall a-a! (figs. 6-9). This wall was built on the conglomerate after it had been cut away and levelled in such a way as to give the aspect of a right angle in section. Thus the south face of the wall has its base consider? ably lower than the north face in absolute height; this difference may vary from 0.50 m. to 1.00 m. The construction of the wall a-a\ which is also the most important amongst those uncovered as regards dimensions and functionality, in the face of such a marked drop in level, has found an answer which completely solves the problem created by the nature of a ground as difficult as this is to incorporate in a context of elementary structures. The solution adopted enabled the builders to avoid waste of means and work force in levelling operations and the loss of areas usable for building. Besides, the fact that part of the north face of the wall rested on the conglomerate may have had considerable dynamic advan? tages. However, the position of the wall, besides its advantages, was also the cause of some inconvenience, such as the sliding of the ground on which it was built, with the obvious consequences of a marked inclination to the south and the collapse of a part of the wall as a result of the thrust from the north. The inclination and the collapse were in part avoided by building other walls up against it at right angles, in order to provide a counter thrust to the south. Another feature of the area which wc excavated was the existence of five pits (figs. 6, 9, 10) for the storage of food-stuffs or other things. They were dug in the conglomerate and four of them are lined with stones of various size, to a thickness of 25-30 cm. (fig. 36). The pit lining was constructed with a dry-stone technique, with the stones in horizontal rows. On account of the difference in size of the stones used, the arrangement in horizontal rows often ceased, to be taken up again subsequently. The only pit which is not stone-lined (pit 1, IMG III) is trapezoidal in section, contrarily to the others which are perfectly cyl? indrical (fig. 37). In pit 1 the joining line between the bottom and the curved walls is visible, and on the walls can be seen perforations, perhaps due to the not very compact nature of the conglomerate, or most probably made for the insertion of wooden structures for the purpose of acceding to or covering the pit. The depth of the pits varies from about 2.00 m. to 2.50 m. and the bottom consists of the usual conglomerate. In the filling of the pits were found fragments of baked clay, probably burnt accidentally, with the impressions of straw matting, and fragments of car? bonized wood, which thus led to the hypothesis that the inside was divided into compart? ments by means of wooden elements and straw matting (fig. 41). The three alluvial deposits mentioned (figs. 7, 8) are found exclusively to the south of the wall a-a\ and therefore obviously to the south of the above-mentioned drop in level, except for the layer of humus. Layer ? is a slightly compact brown deposit with few stones. Layer ?a is similar, except for the colour which is black and a larger quantity 298</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 7 - Aligr?ma.

Section E-E' of the excavation of trench B (see fig. 5).</page><page sequence="10">of stones. This layer becomes thinner towards the north (fig. 8) near the wall a-a\ and disappears on reaching it. To the south its thickness increases varyingly: generally ?a is relatively thinner than the others (from 10 to 30 cm.) while the others are thicker (c. 50 cm.). The layer @a is evidently connected with the last destruction and the burial of the settlement. In fact, besides covering the complete site, it contains evident traces of collapse and subsequent scattering of fallen stones. The orientation of the collapse is evidently towards the south, thus indicating that the flow of the flood-waters and debris which caused the destruction of the site came from that direction (4). Having almost the same physical characteristic, layer ? is a natural yellowish, rather compact deposit with a great many stones. These layers could only be deposited to the south of the drop in level because this area was up against the step. In the southern area therefore, the erosion was to a lesser degree than in that north of the wall a-a\ and this because of the greater depth of the southern area which begins suddenly to the south of the afore? mentioned drop in level. In the area north of the wall a-a! the layers ?, ?a and ? are not present, as has been said above. This could be due to the lack of deposit, for the above-mentioned reas? ons, or to erosion which followed in subsequent alluvial phases. In the area south of the wall a-a!, under layer ? which, as we have said, belongs to the post-occupation period, there were found three beaten earth floors, separated by thin layers rich in pottery and organic substances which accumulated rapidly in connection with the inhabitation of the rooms (3). It is clear from the above description that an analysis of the structures found at Ali? gr?ma in trench B will regard only the area south of the wall a-a' where the alluvial phases did not completely carry away the remains of the dwellings. In the northern area the situation is different. We cannot be absolutely certain that there were structures car? ried away by the flood but this is highly probable, given the stratigraphic situation de? scribed and on account of the presence of pit 1, without a stone lining. It would have be? longed to a building or to a gap in the wall which could be interpreted as a threshold and which, being on a level with the conglomerate to the north of the wall, must pertain to a structure relative to the northern area (fig. 38). The work which I carried out with the constant and careful aid of the architect Dr Luca Mariani in order to seek a dynamic picture of the origin of the structures which we un? covered was inevitably limited by the restricted area of the excavation and by the ruined state in which the structures were found to be the further away we got from the im (4) The direction of the water-flow and of the alluvial debris is from northeast to south? west, a probable indication of alluvial phenomena involving the whole valley in which the river flows in an almost similar direction. (5) These small layers are to be located, in the sections in figs. 7-8, between layers (3) and (4). They have not been represented in these sections since they are absent in places of greater erosion where the depositing of layer (3) has swept away the small layers together with the relative floors and has been deposited therefore directly on layer (4). 300</page><page sequence="11">mediate area of the wall a-a!, where the constructions preserved reach a considerable height. Notwithstanding the almost total lack of a cultural sequence based on the grounds of the pottery (6), it seemed to us that, as regards the architecture, there were at least three phases of construction or reconstruction. These phases were identified on the grounds of the relationship between the walls, the levels on which they rest and the three beaten earth floors mentioned previously. The description begins with the lowest level. Phase I (fig. 11) The stratigraphical position of this phase is between layer (5) and the beaten earth floor pertaining to phase II. Belonging to this phase there are only a few badly preserved and damaged walls. A room (room 3 ILM) can be seen clearly (fig. 38). It is bounded on the north side by the earliest part of the large wall a. This part varies in width, from a minimum of 0.50 m. to a maximum of 1.00 m. It is well preserved, with a not very regular footing (though it is more regular than in the case of the other walls) consisting in sharp-edged, medium-sized stones of similar dimensions. This wall is joined perpendicularly by another (&amp;), 0.50 m. thick and 3.25 m. long, which forms the western side of room 3. The footing of the latter wall is almost the same as that of the former, but made up of stones less uniform in size. In the latter wall is a door 0.75 m. wide which gives access to an open space outside room 3 without a beaten earth floor (fig. 39). This door was subsequently closed up and the small wall c was built up against it, probably as a support for external wooden structures. The closing up of the door can perhaps be related to the division of room 3 into two parts by means of a small wall (d) which, at its northern end, must probably have joined up with wall a. The western part of the room is thus separate and has the form of a narrow corridor with the floor paved with schist slabs. Near the south opening, towards the communicating part of the room, there is a prism-shaped stone fixed firmly into the ground (fig. 40). This object, whose purpose is unknown, has no trace of blows on its upper face and is probably referable to a terracotta lid, taller than the stone and found near it (fig. 19m). In the south part of the room there is another door which can be dated to a period later than the closing up of the first, and which also opens on to the open space to the west. It has a raised threshold consisting of stone rubble covered with a thick layer of unbaked clay (fig. 42). The higher level of the threshold with respect to the floor of the room and the outside level could be explained by the unfortunate position of the dwelling in an area where, when it rained, large, fast-flowing streams of water must certainly have formed. Two structures, one at the south and one at the north of the room (the latter one is built up against wall a), built of large, roughly cut stones, are to be interpreted as bench? es for various uses. (6) See the following pages. 301</page><page sequence="12">Phisc ! \ 05 0 1 2m Fig. 11 - Aligr?ma. Plan of construction phase I in trench B. To the east of room 3 there is a wall, wall e, of the same size and with the same type of footing as that opposite to the west. In the NE corner of the room there is an open space which is difficult to explain, on account of both its position and the fact that it is enclosed by the continuation of wall a belonging to phase II. A stretch of wall, f, c. 0.50 m. thick and c. 6.00 m. long, running in a NS direction, must belong to phase I. It is badly preserved and pertains to the same earth floor as the walls described. The four pits (IMM-IMH) perhaps also belong to this phase: it is diffi? cult to say for certain since there are no connections with the beaten earth floor of room 3 and, moreover, there is a complete lack of stratigraphic connection. However, on ac? count of the fact that pit 4 is under the level of the walls and the beaten earth floor of phase II, it is probable that it and the other pits which can be correlated with it, strati graphically (all are dug in layer ?) and typologically, were constructed during phase I. Phase II (fig. 12) In this phase the rooms, in the excavated area, reach the greatest point of extension by means of the addition of various walls or constructions to the already existing struc? tures. The large wall a is extended, closing the space which existed between it and the east wall e of room 3 and adding to the east two stretches which have a total length of c. 10.00 m. up to the NE corner of the excavated area. The additional stretches of this wall (a') are quite different from the first part to the west which was constructed in phase I, 302</page><page sequence="13">N j_I I _j 05 0 1 2m Fig. 12 - Aligr?ma. Plan of construction phase II in trench B. the difference being in the footing rather than in the dimension (fig. 43). We have here very roughly built walls without any uniformity in the size of the stones used and without the minimum order in their arrangement, since large and small irregular stones alternate without any criterion of construction. The large wall a-a} assumes the function, in this phase, of a head for the walls which are built up against it perpendicularly. This means that, on account of the curving course of the wall, the other walls, running in a NS direction, converge towards a hypothetical centre south of the excavation. These perpendicular walls divide the space south of the wall a-a} into various sectors which were closed up and made into rooms, with beaten earth floors and hearths. The westernmost room is room 3, which already existed in phase I. It is no longer divided into two parts, nor does it have the bench against the north wall a. Two fireplaces abut against the walls e and a: they are oval in plan and con? structed in unbaked clay, which has undergone a process of firing on account of the long period of being subject to burning. The fireplace near wall a has the base covered with schist slabs (fig. 44). They measure about 0.80 X 0.60 m. and are about 0.50 m. deep. They were inserted in the beaten earth floor from which they emerged for about 0.10 m. and were ovoid in form with raised upper edges curved inwards. In the cavity was found a huge quantity of ash and charcoal which became more compact further towards the bot? tom of the fireplaces. In the southern part of room 3 two other fireplaces were inserted in the earth floor so as to emerge slightly, on an axis with the northern door-post on the 303</page><page sequence="14">west side of room 3. Unlike the other two fireplaces in the same room, these last two are made of large ovoid jars fixed horizontally into the ground, with part of the side cut away to create a hollow with an oval-shaped opening not so different from the two fire? place hollows made in unbaked clay. One of the jars still has the neck and the rim. They were both full of ash and charcoal. East of room 3 the wall f, which is "L"-shaped with the short side abutting on to the wall a-a! and the long side perpendicular to it, and the small wall / to the south, parallel to a-a\ form room 2. This room measures 2.00 X 1.25 m, and is rectangular in form. In the SE corner a curved line of stones isolates a small area, perhaps for the purpose of con? taining vegetables (fig. 45). In the NW corner there is instead a large fireplace, not of the cavity type but on supports of unfired clay, cubic in shape with an out-turned upper edge. The footing of the walls which form this small room is similar to that of the part of wall a-a' relative to this phase, that is, very rough and disordered. The relationship be? tween wall /' and the stretch of wall / pertaining to phase I is not altogether clear although it is thought that wall / continued to be used in this phase and that the subsequent "re? shaped wall f in some way abutted on to it and in part restored it. Parallel to wall f, to the south of room 2, there are two stretches of wall, g and h, of like dimensions and state of preservation, but certainly referable to this phase. Their relationship with each other and with the previous wall / are difficult to explain on account of the fact that all three are preserved to the height of a single row of stones and they disappear in a disorderly way to the south. Another stretch of wall to the south, perpendicular to the others, is, on account of its poor state of preservation, difficult to correlate to the rest of the re? mains. East of room 2 is room 1 (fig. 46). It is rectangular in plan, slightly trapezoidal, measuring about 4.00 X 3.00 m. It is bounded on the north side by wall a-a\ on the east by wall m, the easternmost wall perpendicular to a-a', on the west side by the "L"-shaped wall /' and on the south by the wall /, poorly preserved, which joins the two above-men? tioned, slightly converging east and west walls. In the centre of the room there is a hearth without structure. In the wall m there is a door, difficult to delimit, which gave access to the area east of the room. The wall m which bounds room 1 on the east side continues towards south and is lost in a row of disconnected stones on account of the erosion. The areas outside rooms 1, 2 and 3 have not traces of beaten earth floors, but floors which can be correlated with them. They were evidently open external areas, in which pits 2, 3 and 5 are situated. These probably continued to be used in phase II while pit 4 was partly covered over by room 1. North of the large wall a-a' the situation is incomprehensible, as has already been said, because of erosion: it is therefore impossible to establish whether pit 1 was in use in this phase. There are some indications of a relationship between the two areas north and south of the wall a-aWn fact, in the part of this wall constructed during phase I there is a restoration 1.25 m. from the lowest beaten earth floor, by means of long, narrow slabs, above which 304</page><page sequence="15">the wall continues with a regular footing (fig 44). This restoration does not extend for all the length of the earliest part of the wall, but a gap is left to form a threshold or window-sill, or in any case a passageway to the area north of the wall (fig. 38). North of this wall, towards the eastern part of the excavation, the parallel wall n was added, abutting on to the other wall and built on a much higher level than it (fig. 47). This leads one to think of a structure relative to the northern area with regard to wall a-d. There is nothing certain about these indications, but they give the idea that the area north of wall a-a} must have been not without structures, but must certainly have had buildings of which the erosion has left only very few traces. Phase III (fig. 13) The main characteristic of this phase is the disappearance of the three parallel NS walls /, g, h in the central south area of th e excavation, under the beaten earth floor relative to this phase. The floor is 0.20 m. above that pertaining to phase II so that the four fireplaces in room 3 and the small containing structure in the SE corner of room 2 disappear, while the fireplaces of rooms 1 and 2 have the same position and features as those of phase II. A small wall, 0.50 m. long and 0.25 m. wide is placed perpendicularly to wall a-a} in room 3, in the NW corner about 1.00 m. from the western wall b and parallel to it. Its footing is regular and follows that of the restoration of wall a-a': it is probably a dividing wall to create a small storage space within the room (fig. 40). A small part of a wall, 1.00 m. long and 0.25 m. wide is added to the west of the south wall (i) of room 2. It seems that the area to the south of room 1, which in the preceding phases was unoccupied without beaten earth floors, is now covered over and there are considerable traces of an earth floor with a fireplace and a great deal of ash and charcoal. Embedded in the earth floor there are some schist slabs arranged in the manner of a paving. Up against wall a-a9 on the northern side, inside the space which we have called room 4, there is a bench of well arranged stones, parallelepiped in form, 1.00 m. wide and about 0.40 m. high. In this phase or towards the end of it the pits were filled in and covered by considerable quan? tities of rubble from collapsed walls. The end of the settlement must have come about as a result of fire, followed shortly afterwards by the collapse of the buildings. The whole surface of the floor pertaining to phase III has scattered traces of burning with ash and charcoal mixed with large fragments of clay which were originally unbaked but were fired briefly as a result of the fire. These have visible traces of impressions of vegetal fibres, matting and thatching which were per? haps constituent parts of the ceiling and the walls. The analysis of the carbonized wood found will be able to tell us if we have fragments of beams or construction material or whether it is wood used for fuel. Apart from this, the traces of destruction by fire arc numerous. Besides, one has the impression that a characteristic of phase III is the sparse population of the village (diminution of fireplaces, of the inhabited area, diminution of pot 305</page><page sequence="16">_p'u- ?V__P[_ ______ 9 06 0 1 2m Fig. 13 - Aligr?ma. Plan of construction phase III in trench B. tery finds, etc.). Another deciding factor which proclaims a violent destruction is the pre? sence of at least four hurried burials immediately after the cessation of the life of the settlement. The Burials (fig. 14) Within the area which we investigated there were found five burials by inhumation (7). In the area in front of room 3 (figs. 48-49) was found the earliest burial by inhumation (G5). The deceased was laid on the floor relative to phase II. The burial was covered over by the floor pertaining to phase III: there are no traces of a covering made of wood or other material. The skeleton was in a crouched position with the forearms almost par? allel to the right femur, while the left leg was slightly extended. It was lying on the left side, orientated NS with the head to the south and facing west. At its back were two schist slabs and some stones; the furnishings consisted of five miniature vases (fig. 84). From approximative observations it seems that it was a very tall individual with a very robust bone structure. The four subsequent burials, all by inhumation, are to be placed at the end of the (7) The remains of the five skeletons have been brought to Italy to be carefully analysed by the Istituto di Antropologia of the University of Florence (Prof. E.

They were placed on the floor relative to phase III in room 4 (Gl), on the deposit which covered the three parallel walls /, g, and h of room 3 (G2, G3), and a little further to the south (G4). The burial of room 4 (Gl) (fig. 50) was placed on the floor relative to phase III, without any visible traces of cover? ing, as was also the case for the other three which were covered only by the subsequent collapse of the buildings. Around them there are also schist slabs and various stones inserted in the earth floor. The remarkably tall (c. 1.80 m.) and sturdily built individual lies with knees bent and the lower limbs parallel, while the upper ones were joined, the hands near the head which was inclined forwards. It was lying with the trunk supine while the legs and the head were leaning on the right side. The orientation of the body is EW with the head to the east, facing north. The furnishings consist of a hemispherical bowl placed in front of the right foot (figs. 18j, 74) and an iron pin (?). The two individuals buried in the deposit which covered the three parallel walls /, g, and h south of room 2 (G2, G3) are both surrounded by stones and lie in a crouched position in an EW direc? tion with the head to the east (figs. 51-53). The one further north (G2), that of a con? siderably tall and robust individual, lies on the left side facing south, with the arms parallel 307</page><page sequence="18">and the hands near the face. The furnishings consist in a hemispherical bowl (figs. 18h, 73) placed near the feet. The individual further south lies on the right side facing north, the right arm extended towards the feet and the left stretched out in front. There were no furnishings. The fourth burial (G4) (figs. 54, 55) lies to the south of the other two, a short distance away. The skeleton is also oriented EW, in a crouched position with the arms bent and the hands near the face; it is facing north, with the head to the west. This burial was without furnishings and was much disturbed by the fall of buildings. The skull was crushed by a large stone (fig. 54). * * * From the planimetric and architectonic examination of the remains of the structures and from some general observations on the site we can deduce some elements which help us to interpret the socio-cultural physiognomy of the settlement. As we have seen the use of the dwellings did not last for a long time but was restricted to a relatively brief period, with changes in the plan which are of secondary importance and which were in any case always subordinate to the original plan. In the course of the three phases of construction distin? guished, we can see a high point in the occupation of the site which corresponds to phase II; this is in fact the period in which the inhabited area reaches its greatest extension. A feature of the phases I and III is the restricted nature of the inhabited area, which in phase III is a prelude to the violent conclusion of which there is evidence in the copious traces of fires and fallen buildings. The walls, except in some cases, are built of rough stones of diverse measurements, badly arranged and joined together with mud. The upper part of the walls must have been in mud, but no trace has been found of bricks except for two which had fallen on to the floor relative to phase II in room 3. Traces of wooden elements and of straw matting were found in the filling subsequent to phase III: they are impressions on clay which was baked in the fire. The general character of the settlement is that of a modest village, not very densely populated, which is made up of dwellings with rectangular-based units, consisting not of modular elements which are added one next to the other but of walls which intersect as they are lengthened, in such a way as to link the rooms closely with one another from a constructive and not only from a functional point of view. Given the limited area of the excavation it is risky to put forward hypotheses about the possible functional differences in the various rooms. However it is clear that the room pertaining to phase I which was formed on the inside of room 3, with paving and a stone fixed into the ground, must have a very particular function, to be connected with the dis? covery, not far off, of a terracotta lid which could be fitted perfectly on to the stone as a cover. The presence of as many as four fireplaces in room 3, which can be divided into groups of two according to their type, assumes a particular importance. The concen 308</page><page sequence="19">tration of these fireplaces in one room, together with other factors, allows us to put for? ward some hypotheses. In the area which we investigated were found numerous miniature vases of various shapes which, especially on the grounds of their number, cannot be inter? preted as playthings for children. This particular type of utensil must be connected with the necessity of a people who lived mainly by stock-raising for preserving small but pre? cious substances useful and indispensable for fermenting milk and forming curds for mak? ing milk products. On the other hand, the presence of numerous spindle-whorls is evidence of the prac? tice of spinning, while the finding of some figurines of zebus makes one think, perhaps, of a certain connection with this animal which, if not exactly ideological, was at least practical. An indicative fact is the almost total absence of the remains of animal bones. This may be due to chance in the documentation which has come down to us or to an actual distinctive element in the people who inhabited the site. This latter hypothesis would not be completely in contrast with the physiognomy of a settlement of herdsmen - dairymen, which we deduced from the few elements at our disposal. The results of the floatation of the earth samples taken from various places at the site and contained in the vases will make clear a great deal on this point. It is in fact absolutely impossible, at the present stage of our knowledge, to state anything at all about the role played by agriculture in this little community. Some indications in this direction may come from the presence of various-sized grindstones found at diverse points of the site. However, although there are these indications of agriculture, they cannot be placed in a context, and are therefore not sufficient to define the economic physiognomy of a settlement. S. T. Finds The finds which came to light during the excavations of 1966 and 1972 consist for the most part in pottery. To these can be added terracotta objects (23 spindle-whorls, 2 animal figurines, 6 bobbins (?), 6 disks with a central hole obtained from the bases of pots), metal objects (2 copper pins, 2 copper needles, an iron arrow head and three iron pins [?]), a bone object (a pin) and some stone implements (6 grindstones, 1 mortar, 1 pestle, 2 disk shaped objects of unidentified use, and 1 spindle-whorl). Pottery The greater part of the pottery can be identified with types already known in the Swat Valley, that is to say, with the vessels which make up part of the furnishings of the tombs excavated in the graveyards of Loebanr, K?telai and Butkara II (8). (8) See note 1. 309</page><page sequence="20">Beginning with those collected in the layer which gives evidence of the earliest oc? cupation phase of the site, that is, layer ? of trench A, we can see that there are docu? mented here some types of vessels which are distinctive of the earliest period of utilization of the above-mentioned graveyards (*): ? two grey biconical vases with disk-base (figs. 16a, 56) (10); ? a bell-shaped red vessel with large mouth (fig. 16b) (21); ? the upper part of a red narrow-mouthed jar with high, slightly flaring rim (figs. 15a, 57) (12). In the same layer many sherds were collected which belong to the aforementioned types of vessels and to others which are peculiar to the same cultural period (13). A sig? nificant point here is the presence of a fragment from a large vessel with basket-impres? sions on the base (fig. 15e). This peculiarity had never been met with on vessels forming part of the tomb furnishings in the above-mentioned graveyards, but had been found on both large and small vessels in archaeological deposits referable to previous periods (14). It is to be observed that there is no vessel coming from the graveyards of Loebanr, K?telai and Butkara II which has a base as wide as that of the fragment described above (diam. 17 cm.); it probably belonged to a cooking pot of considerable dimensions. It is possible then that the practice of resting the vessels on straw matting before firing them, probably to facilitate the rotating movement while working them by hand, was still in use in the period under investigation, though restricted to very large vessels. Some bases of very large vessels, with the same peculiarity, which were associated with finds referable to the same cultural period as that documented in layer ? of trench A, were collected in the Aligr?ma site also during the 1973 excavations (15). If we examine the vessels collected in layer ? of trenches A and B, we can see first of all that there is evidence of only two types referable to the earliest period of utiliz? ation of the graveyards of Loebanr, K?telai and Butkara II: ? the bell-shaped grey or red vessel with flaring sides (fig. 16d) (le); ? the red stemmed bowl (fig. 16a, f) (17). The above types are documented in these layers also by numerous fragments. Their (?) For the distinction of the chronological periods in the graveyards of Loebanr, K?telai, and Butkara II see G.

Scale 1:5. 311</page><page sequence="22">presence in archaeological layers where we do not find other types of vessels and objects which are peculiar to the earliest period of the graveyards (while types indicative of the middle period recur) is not in contrast with the evidence previously gathered in the exca? vation of the tombs. In fact, in the tombs we were able to note that the types indicated, although for the most part referable to the earliest period of utilization of the grave? yards, make their appearance quite late with respect to other types of vessels and ob? jects (18). Besides it was also seen that in these tombs the two types in question were found in association with types which are distinctive of the subsequent cultural period in the Sw?t Valley (19), which evidently demonstrated that they continued to exist also at the beginning of this period. In layer ? (trenches A and B) we find some types of vessels which are specifically distinctive of the middle period of utilization of the graveyards of Loebanr, K?telai and Butkara II. They are: ? the grey globular bowls with large mouth and low pedestal (figs. 16g, h, 58, 59) (20); ? the grey cylindrical beaker set on low stem and pedestal (figs. 16i, 58) (21); ? the grey vase with deep body, flared rim and flat base (fig. 16k) (22); ? the grey pear-shaped beaker with flared rim (figs. 16m, 63-68) (23); ? the small grey globular vases with almost vertical rim (figs. 17a-d, 75) (24); ? various red hemispherical or almost hemispherical cups (figs. 18f-j, 69-74) (25). The large vessels, always collected in fragments, also attest types already known in the above-mentioned graveyards, such as the large-mouthed globular jar with flaring rim (fig. 15b) (28) and the narrow-mouthed jar with flaring rim (27). It is however to be emphasized that there was a particularly large number of fragments belonging to a very large, thick type of vessel with lugs for hanging near the rim (fig. 15f). This type was not attested amongst the furnishings of the tombs at Loebanr, K?telai and Butkara II, probably on account of its dimensions, which even exceed 80 cm. in diameter, that is, the usual maximum width of the tomb cavity. Two examples of this type, destined for funerary purposes, come from protohistoric tombs discovered in the nearby Buner Valley (28).

All these vases come from trench B, layer d), except the one in fig. 17a. T U Singularly numerous in layer ? were the miniature vases, that is the small containers whose height usually varies from 2 to 5 cm. Altogether 79 were collected. The great number of these small vases in respect of those of larger size, more or less partially pre? served, can be explained by obvious reasons, since their preservation was possible even in sites where repeated collapses of structures have been verified, and especially as the walls of these little vases are rather thick. However, a similarly high proportion raises interest? ing problems concerning their possible use. Although limited to certain particular tombs, miniature vases of an analogous type to those gathered here were attested in the graveyards of Loebanr, K?telai and Butkara II. The various types which can be compared with miniature vases for funerary use can be distinguished as follows: 314</page><page sequence="25">? the small vase with deep body (figs. 17h, 85-87) (29); ? the small globular vase with flaring rim (figs. 17i-l, 91-93)(30); ? the small bowl with out-turned rim (figs. 17q, 79) (31); ? the small bell-shaped vase (figs. 17m-p, 88-90) (32); ? the small, almost globular vase with vertical rim (figs. 17e-g, 81-83) (3S). Since in the majority of cases these little vases were hand modelled, in a rather ru? dimentary fashion, the above-mentioned types often present diverse variants. Up till now we have examined types of vases of relatively wide diffusion, almost all of which have already been attested in the aforementioned graveyards. Let us now look at some more particular examples, all collected in layer (f) of trench B, with which there are only isolated cases of comparison with vases found in the graveyards, or which are docu? mented in this excavation for the first time: ? a large grey hemispherical bowl, lacking the lower part of the body, probably set on stem and with pedestal (fig. 18a) (34); ? a large grey bowl (?) with a quadrangular-sectioned stem and a tall pedestal, hollow on the inside, with incised decorations (figs. 18b, 61 )(35); ? a large grey bowl (?) set on a tall stem, hollow on the inside, with incised decora? tions (figs. 18c, 62) (36); ? a red globular vase with deep body and almost vertical rim, with numerous holes on the curved bottom (figs. 18d, 60); ? a brown theriomorphic vase with globular body set on four legs, with a plastically formed attachment on the body (tail?) and signs of another attachment no longer preserved on the opposite side (head?) (figs. 96, 97); ? a small vase with flaring sides, partly closed at the top, with two spouts opposite each other (fig. 17w); ? a large lid with very deep body and with four-armed crown-handle (fig. 19m). If we go on to examine the pottery coming from layer ? of trench A, mostly gathered at the bottom of the layer in correspondence with room 3, we meet here again some types already attested in layer ?.

(trenches A and B) come some other examples of vessels similar to types which are already attested in the graveyards of Loebanr, K?telai and Butkara II in different periods of their utilization (figs. 16c, n) (41). Their presence in the surface layer is as a result of the earth being turned over, either by washing away or by farming. It is not therefore indicative of their respective chronological position. Terracotta The objects of terracotta consist above all in 23 spindle-whorls, either biconical or tending to biconical (figs. 19d-g, 98-100), which were gathered both in layer ? of trench A and in layer ? of trenches A and B. To them we can add two animal figurines collected in layer ? of trench B (figs. 94, 95), 6 bobbins (?) found in layer ? of trenches A and B (fig. 103), and 6 disk-bases from vessels, with a central hole made after firing, which come from the same level of the two trenches (figs. 19h, 101, 102). Only the spindle-whorls enable us to make a comparison with material already attested in previous excavations in the valley. They recur in tombs of various periods in the cemeteries of Loebanr, K?telai and Butkara II (42). Bone Only one object in bone was found during the excavations. It comes from layer ? of trench A and consists in a pin with a small disk-shaped head, preserved only in part (43). Metalwork Altogether there are nine objects in metal coming from various layers. None of them was collected in layer ?. Layer ? of trench A yielded a copper needle (44), while a similar copper needle (fig. 19b) and two copper pins with a small globule and a disk-shaped head at one end come from layer ? of trench B (fig. 19c)(45). There are also three iron pins (?), only partially preserved on account of oxidation: two of these were collected in layer ? of trench A and the third in layer ? of trench B, beside the deceased in tomb no. 1 (Gl). From layer ? of trench B also comes an iron arrow head, quadrangular in sec? tion (fig. 19a) (46). In our opinion it is significant that the two iron pins, together with a fragment of iron of unidentifiable use, are found in layer ? of trench A in association with pottery and other objects which have many points of comparison with types already attested in the (41) Ibid., types VT201 (?)

All these objects come from trench B, layer (3), except the one in fig. 19a. 318</page><page sequence="29">graveyards of Loebanr, K?telai and Butkara II, where they are characteristic of the middle period of utilization. This evidently shows that iron was certainly used in the area in this period, contrarily to the evidence collected in the graveyards where, with a single exception, iron objects were found in burials belonging to the latest phase of utilization (4T). Stone The grindstones, generally of the saddle-quern type, stand out amongst the large stone implements. They were gathered in layer ? of the two trenches and number eight al? together (fig. 191). Other grindstones, documented by fragments, also come from layer ? of trench A. A mortar was found in layer ? of trench A while in layer ? of trench B two pestles were gathered. A disk-shaped object with a central hole was found in layer ? of trench B (fig. 19k). Its use was probably the same as that of another disk-shaped object, found in the same layer, which has a wide, deep hollow at the centre of both sides (fig. 19j). An object whose purpose is uncertain comes from layer ? of trench A: it is a rec? tangular schist plaque with a pair of deep cavities on one side (4.5 X 3.5 cm.) (fig. 104). Another disk-shaped, water-smoothed pebble, with a pair of shallow cavities on one side, seems to have had the same uncertain purpose. It was found at the bottom of layer ? in trench B (Inv. no. A188, diam. 14 cm.). Subsequent excavations at Aligr?ma in 1973 brought to light two other singular finds, which in certain aspects are similar to those just described. They are a practically rectan? gular schist slab with a pair of holes at the opposite sides. Although they are of dif? ferent shapes and sizes, these four objects which feature a pair of cavities or holes had perhaps the same ideological-religious value. It is in fact possible that the objects des? cribed were all meant to represent the same superior being, expressed symbolically by means of a single attribute, the eyes. Similar eye-motifs, presumably the symbol of an all-seeing deity, are not new in the religious iconography of the NW regions of the sub-continent. In fact, they are met with on the body of many urn-vases, containing cremated remains, gathered in the protohistoric cemeteries of the Sw?t Valley and surrounding regions (48). The pairs of holes are here the extreme schematization of an anthropomorphic image which is represented much more distinctly on other cinerary vases where, besides the holes indicating the eyes, there is a large hole in place of the mouth, and sometimes pieces moulded in relief corresponding to the nasal septum and the orbital arches (4*). In the Sw?t Valley graveyards the urns fea (47) Tomb no. 126 at K?telai is an exception. Here a fragment of a small object laminar in shape was associated with a vase of the furnishings belonging to the earliest phase of utilization of the graveyards (vase type VT27). (48) Silvi Antonini, Stacul, op. cit., pis. XXXVIb, XXXVIIa. (") Ibid., pis. XXXVIIb, XXXIXa. 319</page><page sequence="30">turing a simple pair of holes are of a relatively late date compared with those which have a more explicit anthropomorphic significance. * * * From what has been said, it seems to us that in the areas of the Aligr?ma settlement where the excavations of 1966 and 1972 were carried out, a differentiation of the chrono? logical horizons can be made on the basis of the typology of the finds coming from the various layers. First of all it is to be emphasized that the types of pottery and objects gath? ered in the two trenches in layers ? and ? are clearly distinguishable from those which come from layer ? of trench A. We can without doubt relate the chronological horizon attested in layer ? of trench A to the earliest period of utilization of the Loebanr, K? telai and Butkara II graveyards, and more precisely to the chronological Period V in the protohistorical sequence in the Swat Valley (5&lt;)). In the horizon at Aligr?ma which corre? sponds to this period, vases such as those shown in figs. 56 and 57 are particularly re? current. The transition phase between Period V and Period VI (i.e. between the early and middle periods in the graveyards at Loebanr, K?telai and Butkara II) seems to us to be recognizable in some of the lower levels of layer ? in trench B, where we also meet with fragments of vases like those seen in fig. 16d-f. The chronological Period VI is that most documented in the excavations of the two trenches. In fact, it is to be recognized in different types of finds gathered in layer ?, wThich in certain cases are almost identical to corresponding types with a funerary func? tion (figs. 16g-m). The chronological Period VII which is to be identified with the latest phase of utiliza? tion of the graveyards of Loebanr, K?telai and Butkara II was not documented in these excavations at Aligr?ma. We must however emphasize that some finds gathered in some of the upper levels of layer ? in trench B and in layer ? of trench A are perhaps in? dicative of a transition between Periods VI and VII. On the grounds of the evidence which we have given the period of occupation of the settlement at Aligr?ma, in the area where the excavations described were carried out, seems to have been particularly long, to be placed, that is, between the last centuries of the 2nd millennium B.C. and the 4th century B.C. More recent researches, in particular the ex? cavation carried out in 1973 in an area nearer to the valley floor (51), have proved that here the earliest phase of occupation can be ascribed with certainty to the chronological Period IV, and thus the site was inhabited, perhaps uninterruptedly, from about 1700 B.C. onwards (52).

In this connection we must observe that settle? ment in a hilly position, not very far above the valley floor, from which a vast surrounding area is dominated, seems to have been particularly recurrent in certain protohistoric periods in the Swat Valley. The documentation gathered at Aligrama is however far more extensive than all previous evidence, and this induces us to think that the site must have had con? siderably great importance in the life of the communities of the valley, perhaps down to the time of Alexander the Great.
