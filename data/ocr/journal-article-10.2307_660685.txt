<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FIELD OF PALEOLITHIC ART By GEORGE GRANT MAC CURDY THE paleolithic artist's range of models included both the animate and the inanimate, but was confined almost wholly to the fauna. Among the fauna, mammals (including man) largely monopolized his attention. Birds and fishes came in for a relatively small share; reptilian representations are practically non-existent, and the same may be said of invertebrates. Plant- like forms are very rare. The inanimate field is represented by claviform and tectiform figures; also by chevrons, frets or grecques, spirals, volutes, wave ornaments, and alphabetiform signs, some of which were derived from animate objects through processes of conventionalization. In a study of cave art, one is impressed, although not surprised, by the extent to which it reflects the fauna of the time. To the hunter, game animals would naturally loom large on the horizon; that which makes the strongest appeal to the senses is the first to find expression, especially when it happens to be essential to one's existence. Among the animal forms reproduced in paleo- lithic art, game animals occur much more frequently than any other kinds; the horse far outnumbers the hyena; as does the red deer compared with the lion. To one animal killed because it was dangerous to man (or to the animals on which he fed), there would be scores of game animals captured. Besides, many of the repre- sentations are prayers for the increase of the species useful for food and would account in part for the preponderance noted above. The cave artist not only had predilection for such species as the horse and red deer, but he also seems to have had a preference for the female of the species. In some species the sex distinction is much more pronounced than in others. The stag can be dis- tinguished from the hind by the presence of antlers; figures of the hind far outnumber those of the stag, a fact which is significant. The hind is the symbol of fecundity; the larger the number of 27</page><page sequence="2">28 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 hinds, the greater the increase of the herd. With the horse it is difficult for the artist to differentiate between the sexes; were it not so, we should probably find a like majority of mares over stallions. The same preference for the female sex holds good among repre- sentations of Homo, no doubt for kindred reasons. The human form played by no means an insignificant r6le as a model for the cave artist; with but few exceptions, however, the artistic treatment of it was not so successful as was that of the lower animals. The failure of the paleolithic artist in this respect is, no doubt, more apparent than real since both by inclination and training we are more critical of human representations than of any other. Moreover, the cave artist had what seemed to him more weighty reasons for portraying game animals than man. In any event he evinced much skill in emphasizing the characteristic features of a given species, such for example as the peculiar outline of the mammoth with its high cephalic dome, deep nuchal notch, and hroad sloping dorsal dome; or the short pointed muzzle of the stag and the finer distinctions between its antlers and those of the reindecr. THE HUMAN FORM IN PALEOLITHIC ART Fcrms distinctly human, including the entire figure or a part thereof, and anthropomorphic forms including masked figures have been found in France, Belgium, Austria, Germany, Russia, Czechoslovakia, Italy, and Spain. France leads with examples from thirty-two stations; Spain is represented by examples from two dozen stations; three stations have been reported from Czechoslovakia, and one each from Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, and Russia. In the cave artist's treatment of the human form, the first things to attract the attention are: (a) the pictorial predominance of the female over the male; (b) the recurrence of a female type suggestive of the Hottentot or Bushman; and (c) the wide geographic and chronologic distribution of this type in Europe. To the figures in the round from Grimaldi, Brassempouy, Les- pugue, Willendorf, an'd Mainz, there should be added the bas- reliefs from Laussel, all conforming to one type. They belong</page><page sequence="3">MAC CURDY] THE FIELD OF PALEOLITHIC ART 29 to various Aurignacian levels and are suggestive rather of d sym- bolic than of a physical type. The female bust from Mas d'Azil, carved from the incisor of a horse, has long pendent breasts also suggestive of the Hottentot (Magdalenian). Those from Brassem- pouy have been referred to the Lower Aurignacian, and those from Willendorf, Lespugue, and Laussel to the Upper Aurignacian. A feature common to this group is the summary treatment of the head and extremities, the chief attention being bestowed upon the primary and secondary sex characters. In a few examples where the head is present there is an attempt to suggest hair, or a coiffure, by means of cross-hatching, as in the case of the figurine d la capuche (Brassempouy) and the negroid head from Barma Grande (Grimaldi). Still more remarkable is the suggestive way in which kinkiness is represented in the coiffure of the Venus of Willendorf. Three steatopygic female figurines were discovered in 1922; one was found by Count R. de Saint-Perier in the grotte des Rideaux at Lespugue (Haute-Garonne) and the others (lower half only) by Dr. Otto Schmidtgen in loess at Mainz on the Rhine. The first is of ivory and practically complete; it is 14.7 cm. (5.8 in.) high, the largest ivory female figurine known to date. The features are not indicated; the hair, represented by parallel incisions, covers three-fourths of the face and descends at the back to the level of the shoulderblades. The breasts are enormous and the steatopygic characters very pronounced. A new feature is the slenderness of the waist, permitting the arms to hang free from the body at this level. The human form is often treated in summary fashion. At Gourdan and Raymonden the figures, engraved on bone, are sketchy, quite small, and arranged in processions; the grouping and general treatment from the two localities are strikingly similar. Scarcely better defined is the diminutive human from La Madeleine incised on reindeer horn and represented as carrying a stick on the right shoulder; it is comparable with a series of small human figures incised on a rib, each with a staff on the shoulder, from the A bri du Chateau at Les Eyzies; and with the hunting scene (?) on reindeer horn from Laugerie-Basse, generally referred to as the chasse ac l'aurochs.</page><page sequence="4">30 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 In-addition to a number of masked figures which are obviously human, there are a number of examples, chiefly engravings, in which the human form is but vaguely indicated; they may best be referred to as anthropomorphic figures. Representations of this kind haye been found at Combarelles, Cro-Magnon, Font-de- Gaume, Gourdan, Laugerie-Basse, Marsoulas, and Mas d'Azil (in France); at Altamira and Hornos de la Pefia (in northern Spain). Human (and animal) paleolithic representations are, as a rule, of the entire figure. Figures of an arm, leg, phallus, or vulva are rare. On the other hand, and this is the exception which proves the rule, figures of the human hand are abundant, especially in the Pyrenean and Cantabrian regions. They have been reported from seven caves in France (Gargas, Bedeilhac, Trois-Freres, Les Eyzies Font-de-Gaume, Beyssac, David, and Blanchard at Sergeac) and from four in Spain (Altamira, Castillo, Santian, and Pretina). The technique employed in representing the human hand was wholly different from that employed in any other cave art; it was ingenious but not of special artistic merit. Two methods were used to achieve the desired result: the chief one was to press one hand against the cavern wall and with the other apply to coloring matter in the form of a powder over an area sufficient to leave a negative imprint on removal of the hand. The imprint is usually of the left hand for the simple reason that a majority of mankind are (and were even in paleolithic time) right-handed. The other method was by means of color transference. The palm of the hand was dampened, covered with dry powdered paint, and then applied to the damp wall of the cave. As one might be led to expect, a majority of the hands stamped or printed on the walls are right hands; this is additional proof of dextral predominance. At Santian (Santander) mural figures in red, suggestive of the human hand and lower arm, were reproduced by the ordinary free-hand application of color. They are more or less schematic or stylistic in treatment, grading off into forms suggesting the bird foot; they may have little to do with the positive and negative hand imprints. The latter are the oldest examples of paleolithic</page><page sequence="5">MAC CURDY] THE FIELD OF PALEOLITHIC ART 31 mural art; the technique involved, therefore, represents an initial phase in the evolution of art in general. At Castillo, the hands underlie figures in yellow, and these in turn underlie figures in red. Figures of the human hand are most abundant in Spain at Castillo; in France, at Gargas. Many of the figures at Gargas represent hands that have been mutilated by the removal of one or more joints from one or more fingers.

We know which animals the Mousterians fed upon from their kitchen refuse. During the upper paleolithic period, we have two lines of evidence: the kitchen refuse and the animal</page><page sequence="7">MAC CURDY] THE FIELD OF PALEOLITHIC ART 33 representations in art; both point to one and the same conclusion. The relative frequency of a given genus as a model for the artist varies approximately in direct ratio with the frequency with which the bones of that particular genus occur in the kitchen refuse. Both hunter and artist no doubt drew most heavily on the animal that was most abundant, other things being equal. Some animals are caught more easily than others by a hunter limited to primi- tive means. The horse and red deer were both fleet of foot, but either was a prize well worthy of special effort. It is surprising that the mammoth should have been sought so extensively as food and that the hare should not have played a more important r6le; the latter is scarcely represented in the art of the period. The horse was easily. the favorite in France; in Spain it was second, conceding first place to the red deer.1 Taking Europe as a whole, the horse predominates; and is followed in turn by the red deer, bison, wild goat, Bovidae (chiefly Bos primigenius), reindeer, and Cervidae. The original home of the horse was North America. Remains of the true horse (Equus stenonis) are found in the Plio- cene and early Pleistocene deposits of Europe. One finds in the upper paleolithic deposits remains of several varieties of horse not unlike the modern Celtic or Arab type, the Nordic or forest type, and the steppe type (E. przewalski), also the wild ass or kiang (E. hemionus). These varieties are even recognizable in the art of the upper paleolithic period. By tabulating the occurrence of animal forms represented in art from eight of the principal stations in France, the horse is found to predominate in six, the reindeer in one, and the bison in one. The stations in question are: Bruniquel, Combarelles, Font-de-Gaume, Laugerie-Basse, Lorthet, Lourdes, La Madeleine, and Mas d'Azil. The horse, reindeer, bison, Bovidae (chiefly Bos primigenius), and mammoth are, in the order mentioned, the most frequently represented. The horse, reindeer, and Bovidae (not including bison) occur in all eight stations; the bison is lacking in one (Lorthet) and Mammoth in three (Lorthet, Lourdes, and Mas d'Azil). 1 Red deer (Cervus claphus) was common during the Aurignacian; became rare in the Solutrean and Lower Magdalenian; was abundant in the Upper Magdalenian; and finally supplanted the reindeer.</page><page sequence="8">34 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 At Bruniquel the animal representations in order of frequency are: Equidae (chiefly Equus caballus), reindeer, wild goat, Bos, Capridae chamois, bison, red deer, mammoth, musk-ox, and Homo. The order of frequency at Les Combarelles is: Equidae, mammoth, antelope, Bovidae, reindeer, wild goat, bison, Capridae, cave bear, Felis, and wolf. The bison easily leads at Font-de-Gaume and is followed by: Equidae, mammoth, reindeer, Bos, Capridae, rhinoceros, Felis, cave bear, Homo, and wolf. The reindeer leads at Laugerie-Basse, being followed by: Equidae, fish, Bovidae, bison, red deer, wild goat, Cervus, Homo, Felis, and otter. At Lorthet the order of frequency is: Equidae, Cervidae, fish, red deer, Bovidae, roebuck, glutton, and reindeer. The horse is first at Lourdes with Bovidae a fairly close second; then follow in their turn, the bison, bird, reindeer, red deer, cave bear, Cervidae, fish, and rhinoceros. At La Madeleine the horse again leads; the reindeer, a close second, is followed by the red deer, Bovidae, Cervidae, ruminants, bison. Felis, Homo, and mammoth. The eighth station, Mas d'Azil, concedes first place to Equidae by a wide margin; after the horse there come in turn: reindeer, wild goat, Bovidae, fish, bison, Bos, bird, red deer, antelope, Cer- vidae, anthropomorphic figures, Homo, ruminant, and wild boar. A somewhat different faunal composition is reflected in the paleolithic art of Spain, even though the field be limited to the region north of the Cantabrian mountains. The horse concedes first place to the red deer, with the bison a close third. Elephas is rare and the reindeer disappears altogether. The animals most frequently represented are, in the order given, red deer, Equidae, bison, and Bovidae (chiefly Bos). The foregoing is based on the stations of Altamira, Castillo, Hornos de la Pefia, and La Pasiega. The order of frequency in each is: (a) Altamira. Bison, horse, red deer, Capridae, wild boar, chamois, Cervidae, Elephas, and wild goat. (b) Castillo. Red deer (mostly female), bison, horse, Bos, wild goat, Capridae, chamois, and Elephas.</page><page sequence="9">MAC CURDY] THE FIELD OF PALEOLITHIC ART 35 (c) Hornos de la Pefia.

They include figures in the round, in low relief, and engravings; they adorn batons as well as dart- throwers and at least two examples of mural art have been noted. Among the figures that can be identified with a fair degree of certainty, one finds the crane, duck, goose, grouse, owl, penguin, partridge, and swan (practically all edible forms). A bird figure from the loess station of Andernach (Rhine) illustrates, as well perhaps as any other example of portable art, the ability of the artist to improvise, to seize upon resemblances,</page><page sequence="14">40 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 and make of the imagination a labor-saving device. It is carved from the basal portion of a reindeer horn in which the sculptor saw the head, beak, and eyes of a bird; the wings and tail were added by means of a few incised lines on the shaft which formed the body of the bird. Another notable figure of a bird in the round ornaments a dart-thrower of reindeer horn found by Piette at Mas d'Azil. The fragmentary specimen has been restored by Breuil, who sees in the figure a grouse. The crochet ofa dart- thrower of reindeer horn from Raymonden is carved so as to represent the head and beak of a bird. The bird his been found in cave art at nineteen stations: France. Arudy, Bruniquel, Fontarnaud, Gargas, Gourdan, Isturitz, Lourdes, Mas d'Azil, Raymonden, Soucy, Teyjat, Trois-Freres Germany. Andernach Italy. Romanelli Russia. Mezine Spain. Minateda, Monte Arabi, El Pendo, El Tajo de las Figuras FISH The fish occurs more frequently than the bird in cave art. It is represented in some two dozen stations in France alone, but occurs somewhat rarely outside. Among the kinds that figure in cave art the carp (?), flounder, pike, plaice (or brill), salmon, Spanish mackerel, and trout have been identified. There are some fifty paleolithic stations in Europe in which harpoons of reindeer horn have been found, all dating from the Magdalenian epoch. The harpoon may well have served in fishing, especially for salmon and pike. In about half of the stations at which figures of the fish have been reported, harpoons also occur, namely at: Arlay, Arudy, Bruniquel, Les Cambous, Goyet, Isturitz, Kostelik, Langerie-Basse, Lespugue, Lorthet, La Made- leine, Mas d'Azil, Sordes, and Teyjat. At Teyjat, the harpoons and the engraving of a fish came from the same Magdalenian level. Among the remaining stations with representations of the fish, some were not inhabited during the harpoon-making epoch (Upper Magdalenian). In the Piette collection from Mas d'Azil,</page><page sequence="15">MAC CURDY] THE FIELD OF PALEOLITHIC ART 41 is the figure of a fish carved from reindeer horn and represented as having been pierced by a harpoon. The hook was also employed in fishing. Many examples of a primitive fish-hook made of a straight sliver of bone or reindeer horn, 3 or 4 cm. (1-1.5 in.) long and pointed at both ends were found at Bruniquel; other examples, including barbed hooks, are reported from some of the caves and rock shelters of the Dor- dogne. The engraving of a fish found by Labrie at Fontarnaud is of unusual interest because the fish is represented as biting at what appears to be intended for a barbed hook. In certain figures of the fish the surface is so incised as to resemble the vertebral column and spines or ribs; this is true of the specimen recently found by E. Passemard at Isturitz, and the one found by Count de Saint-P&amp;rier in the grotte des Boeufs at Lespugue. An even greater stretch of phantasy is to be noted in one (now in the Yale collection) of the fish figures from the cave of Rey. The body and tail of the fish are cut from a ruminant rib split in the plane of its maximum dimensions. The artist imagines the split rib to represent the split body of the fish and by means of incised lines makes the framework of the fish to show on the split side only. Perforated fish vertebrae were often used as beads during the cave-art period. In one of the Mentone caves, Rivibre found a paleolithic necklace composed of twenty-four salmon vertebrae. The remarkable necklace found by Verneau with one of the skele- tons (the young man) composing the triple burial at Barma Grande cave (Grimaldi), was made up of a happy combination of canine teeth of the deer, univalve shells (Nassa neritea), and fish vertebrae. One of the batons of reindeer horn found by Lartet and Christy at La Madeleine has a marginal decoration closely resembling a series of fish vertebrae in their anatomic relation. Figures of the fish have been found at thirty-one stations and in at least five European countries as follows: Belgium. Goyet. Trout engraved on a baton of reindeer horn; found by Dupont. Czechoslovakia. Kostelik. Ramus of the lower jaw of a horse carved into the form of a fish; found by M. Khiz.</page><page sequence="16">42 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S.; 26, 1924 France. (1) Arlay.

Invertebrates did not serve the needs of man to any appreciable extent; when wanted, they could be had without resort to magic. Five examples have been reported: (1) the facsimile of a Cypraea shell carved from ivory with a large loop for suspension, from Pair-non-Pair (middle Aurignacian), (2) an ivory beetle (Coleopter) of Magdalenian age from Cap Blanc, (3) an insect (Coleopter) in lignite from Arcy, (4) a lady bug from Laugerie-Basse, and (5) an insect (Coleopter) in ivory from the grotte du Coleoptere, Belgium (Magdalenian). FLORA As was the case with invertebrates, and perhaps for similar reasons, the plant world was of little concern to the cave artist. Figures that might be construed as plant representatives have been found at only a few stations, including Arcy (grotte du Trilobite), Gaubert, Gourdan, Lourdes, Marsoulas (?), Mas d'Azil, and Le Veyrier. THE INANIMATE IN PALEOLITHIC ART Portrayal of animal forms was the cave artist's chief concern, with a decided predilection for verteLrates and among the verte- brates, Mammalia easily rank.ed frst. I here is but a faint pictorial reminder of the cave man's contact with the invertebrate life about him; the same is true so far as the plant -crld is concerned.</page><page sequence="19">MAC CURDY] THE FIELD OF PALEOLITHIC ART 45 Inanimate objects fared somewhat better; among these are classed decorative motives that might have been derived from animal forms through processes of conventionalization, such as chevrons, frets or grecques, spirals, volutes, etc. Alphabetiform Signs. Before the close of the Magdalenian Epoch symbolism began to play an important r6le in Paleolithic art. Piette believed these Magdalenian symbols to be figures or images employed as signs of objects; therefore, they represent words. One of the early Paleolithic symbols is the dotted circle, supposed to be a sun symbol (Gourdan, Lourdes); it reappears as an Egyptian hieroglyph, also on dolmens and menhirs, on Bronze- Age funerary urns, and ornaments of the Iron Age. The circle without the dot passed into ancient alphabets, and from them into modern alphabets. The lozenge was employed as an artist's signature at Lorthet. Piette distinguished two successive systems of writing in the Magdalenian-the hieroglyphic and the cursive; he believed the latter to be derived from the former, but admitted that since symbols are creatures of convention, they may from the beginning have been figures formed by geometric lines instead of being simplified images. Alphabetiform symbols which have been interpreted as proof of the existence of primitive writing during the Magdalenian Epoch have been found at a number of stations in France, including Crozo de Gentillo, Gourdan, Lcrthet, La Madeleine, Mas d'Azil, and Placard; they have also been found in Spain at La Pasiega. Chevrons, Frets, Spirals, Volutes, Wave Ornaments. As pre- viously stated, ornamental motives may be derived from realistic originals. To what extent this is true of Paleolithic chevrons, spirals, sigmoids, volutes, etc., it would be difficult to say. They are, no doubt, in a measure the result of a tendency to con- ventionalize, to standardize, to symbolize after the tide of realism had begun to ebb. The chevron is employed at a number of stations including Mas d'Azil, Sordes, and Teyjat in France, and Wildscheuer in Germany. Spirals, sigmoids, and volutes identical in pattern and technique have been found at Arudy, Lespugue, and Lourdes in France; and at Hornos de la Pefia in</page><page sequence="20">46 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 Spain. A wave ornament incised on a large rib found in Solu- trean deposits at Predmost is unique so far as the author's knowl- edge goes. The fret or grecque is developed to an unexpected degree in the loess station of M6zine. The patterns, incised on ivory, were reported by Volkov as belonging to the Upper Aurig- nacian; but Tchikalenko believes them to date from near the close of the Magdalenian Epoch. Claviform Signs and Darts. Club-shaped figures, both en- graved and in colors, so far as the author can recall, are found only on cavern walls in a number of French and Spanish stations. They are associated for the most part with animal figures and are, no doubt, of magic import. Examples occur in three important caverns of Ariege: Niaux, Trois-Freres, and Tuc d'Audoubert. In the latter, a claviform is incised across the head of a reindeer engraved on the cavern wall. The claviforms from Niaux and Trois-Freres are in color and not directly asso- ciated with animal figures. At Combarelles a figure that admits of being interpreted as a claviform is incised longitudinally on the head of a horse. The claviform is found in southern Spain at Altamira and Pindal. Beneath a wounded bison at Pindal are six club-shaped figures in color, all oriented in the same manner. The original bludgeons for which these stand were obviously of wood since none have been preserved; they were about 1 m. (39.4 in.) in length if the artist drew them and the accompanying bison to the same scale. That the paleolithic artist did not ignore the matter of scale when executing a group is seen in even a cursory examination of the repertory of cave art. Many examples might be cited in proof of it: the mother and her young, the male and female of the same species; a herd of a given kind, the hunter and the animal hunted, etc. It goes without saying that figures in accidental juxtaposi- tion, executed at different times and by different artists, would not conform to the same scale. Again, cases might arise where it would not be expedient to lay much stress on observing this rule. A case in point is apparently afforded by a decorated bone pendant from Raymonden with an engraved scene depicting a hunter's</page><page sequence="21">MAC cuRDY THE FIELD OF PALEOLITHIC ART 47 feast. The dead, dismembered, partially consumed bison right- fully occupies the center of the stage and is accordingly drawn to a larger scale than are the feasting hunters arranged in two rows, one on each side of the carcass. The position of the forelegs indicates that they have already been disjointed and the vertebral column is laid bare. The pendant also served as a hunter's tally. The subject of claviform figures cannot be dismissed without reference to the cavern of Altamira, where more than a dozen claviforms are painted on the famous ceiling, some of them encroaching upon the space occupied by the legs of the large figure of the hind. Darts dangling from the sides of wounded animals are often depicted; the best known examples are from Niaux and Tuc d'Audoubert in Ariege, and Pindal in northern Spain. Some of the clay statues and figures in high relief of various animals from the newly discovered cavern of Montespan (Haute-Garonne) are literally riddled with punctures representing dart wounds. The figure of a harpoon incised on a pebble has been found at Gourdan (Haute-Garonne). Tectiforms. Tent-shaped figures incised and in color, have been found on cavern walls of both France and Spain. They are often placed directly on animal figures as if to imply a direct or desired association. Two of these tectiforms resembling a front view of two over-lapping tents without sides, are incised on the figure of a mammoth at Bernifal. Two tectiforms of more elaborate form including sides and openings, are painted on the body of a mam- moth at Font-de-Gaume. Two other similar figures are painted on the body of a reindeer at Font-de-Gaume, where a total of nineteen tectiforms has been listed. Other French stations in which tectiforms have been found include: Les Combarelles, La Mouthe, Les Eglises, Trois-Freres, and Marsoulas. Tectiform signs also occur in both northern and southern Spain: Bolao, Castillo, La Pasiega, and La Pileta. The term tectiform is well chosen because of the resemblance of the figures to primitive dwellings and because of the probability that they actually represent the kind of temporary abode em- ployed by the upper paleolithic races. Man of that period</page><page sequence="22">48 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 26, 1924 dwelt in caves and rock shelters wherever they were to be found and if habitable; elsewhere he had recourse to artificial and more or less temporary shelters. The tectiforms reproduce in a remark- able manner the simple shelters, tents, and huts in use today among primitive and nomadic races in various parts of the world. MATERIALS EMPLOYED IN PALEOLITHIC ART Artists of the historic period have a wide range of materials to serve as a vehicle of art expression,-chiefly canvas, paper, textiles, plaster, the various metals, pottery, porcelain, glass, skins, clay, bone, horn, ivory, wood, stone, and coloring matter. The first seven of these were certainly unknown to the paleo- lithic artist who was limited to what he found ready to hand in nature. This limitation, together with the paucity of utensils at his command, was a serious handicap to the artist of the Old Stone Age. It is known from the record, that in portable art he made use of stone, bone, ivory, reindeer horn, and stag horn, the chief vehicles being bone and stone. Bones of both mammals and birds were freely employed, usually without any previous prepa- ration. Various kinds of stone were pressed into service, some of them quite hard, others soft. The list includes: crystalline talc, lignite, schist, gritstone, slate, and several varieties of limestone. Sometimes pebbles were employed. All these ready-to-hand materials are of a more or less non- perishable nature; but it would not be logical to assume that such were the only materials employed. Wood is well adapted as a medium of art expression; it was available and the cave artist had tools well adapted for working it. Wood is widely used for art purposes by primitive living races; there is every reason, there- fore, to assume that the paleolithic artist made free use of wood from which, no doubt, many of his ornamented dart-throwers were made. The skins which served for clothing were probably dec- orated, and the practice of painting the body might also have been in vogue. Stationary art, which adorns the walls, ceilings, and sometimes even floors of caverns, and the walls of rock shelters, if engraving or fresco, is done in stone and in rare cases, stalagmite; if painted,</page><page sequence="23">MAC CURDY] THE FIELD OF PALEOLITHIC ART 49 ocher and oxide of manganese furnished the coloring matter. In the field of stationary art, clay was used perhaps much more extensively than the record would indicate; for only under excep- tionally favorable conditions could one expect figures of un- tempered and unbaked clay to survive the ravages of time.
