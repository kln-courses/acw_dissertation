<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vol. XI 1940 "Probably one of the greatest disservices man can do for the game he hunts is to destroy his rivals, the predators, the agents that exercise the only selection that compensates for his own deteriorating influence." 46. The Control of Fish Predators at Hatcheries and Reari g Stations. Karl F. Lagler. 1939. Journal of Wildlife Management, 3: 169-179. Based on returns to questionnaires from 228 hatcheries. "Fish culture during 1937 in the United States entailed an unestimated total sacrifice of animals and a recorded extermination of 2,474 reptiles, 12,442 birds, and 307 mammals." It is shocking to read of the slaughter of 4,350 herons, egrets and bitterns, 278 ospreys, 306 water ouzels and 5,568 kingfishers. The author stresses the need of "wider use of control methods that exclude or frighten away predatory animals." BOOKS 47. Birds as Animals. James Fisher. Heineman, London, Toronto. 281 pp. 12s 6d. A compendium of bird biology, written chiefly for the amateur in the British Isles who is doing such fine field work in ornithology. f1here are twelve chapters, each starting with "Bird": historians, history, adaptation and habitat selection, variation and distribution, environment, habitat, numbers, migration' colours and display, territory, and reproduction, with a final chapter on "Birds and Man." The book is well annotated with some six or seven hundred references. There is an index of species, but no index of subjects. On the whole the work has been admirably done and a vast amount of information is presented in informal style. "Birds as Animals" will be a valuable reference book. 48. The Geese Fly High. Florence P. Jacques. Illustrations by Francis Lee Jacques. 1939. University of Minnesota Press. 102 pp. $3.00. This time, instead of canoeing and camping in the northern wilderness, the Jacques take their folding kayak to the desolate swamps of Arkansas and the thrilling marshes of the Rainey Sanctuary on the coast of Louisiana. Mrs. Jacques' lively telling carries us from one adventure to another; we share with her her uneasiness in the murky swamps, her delight in the ducks and geese, her rapture over the beauty and color in the coastal marshes. For the first time she hears the cry of wild geese. "I knew it was one of the most stirring sounds in the world, but I hadn't realized how it would besiege the spirit. It is to bird song what the trumpet call is to music, a gallant challenge and a desperate cry, lifting the heart, disturbing it." As fascinating as the text are the black and white illustrations by Mr. Jacques, for he has captured for us the very spirit of the different ducks and geese. "The Geese Fly High" is a treasure of a book. 49. Quetzal Quest. Wolfgang von Hagen and Quail Hawkins. Harcourt, Brace. N. Y. 198 pp. $1.75. An attractive book for children telling in lively, simple style and with amusing sketches of ultimate success after many difficulties in finding the nests of the brilliant Trogon, Pharomachrus mocinno, in Honduras, of raising the young and finally bringing them safely to the coast and on ship- board. 50. The Private Life of Birds. Henry Smith Williams. 1939. McBride. N. Y. 270 pp. $3.00. The spectacular results obtained by the Williams by pro. viding abundance of bright colored yarns for their Baltimore Orioles, Kingbirds and Cedar Waxwings have already been mentioned in this journal. Now Dr. Williams writes a book on bird life illustrated not with color prints of these gay nests-more's the pity-, but with the well known prints of the National Audubon Society. There is sound information here on bird life, but also much that is anthropomorphic. If the author had joined the Eastern Bird-Banding Associa- tion and color banded his birds, his results would have been greatly enhanced in value. If he had joined the American Ornithologists' Union and the Wilson Ornithological Club, and read the journals of all three societies, he would have been saved many errors.</page></plain_text>
