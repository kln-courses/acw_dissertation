<plain_text><page sequence="1">EPHESUS, PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN BY MICHAEL TIERNEY, M.A. Professor of Greek, University College, Dublin 'T'HE great Greek cities of ancient Anatolia have mostly disappeared from our modern maps. Their names, twisted to uncouth forms, may still survive here and there attached to a straggling village or a group of crumbling ruins,, but little or nothing is left to remind a distant age that this region was once the centre of civiii sation, crowded with populous towns, famous temples, and . wealthy harbours, and traversed by great roads which carried the commerce of more than. half the world. History itself has not been kind to the Greeks of Asia Minor; only vague fragmentary rumours of their life and achievements have echoed to our times. We know that European civilisation began a600g the Ionians, and that they handed on to Athens the scientific and artistic traditions upon which we still subsist. But the pre-eminent glory of Athens has dimmed somewhat the record of her teachers and rivals; we are apt to think of her as Greece, and to forget that she was only one city, and a somewhat peculiar one, out of many. Greek history was largely written by Athenians or their admirers, and until the last century, scholars who would learn of Miletus or of Ephesus had to piece together the fitful references of geographers, poets, and grammarians, which told in snatches something . of their peripheral existence. Archaeology has done much to remedy the defects of written tradition, but even yet the story of these once great communities and their varied life of many centuries is only in process of partial recovery. Few cities of equal importance have suffered so much from the ravages of time and forgetfulness as Ephesus, and few have been less deserving of even comparative</page><page sequence="2">450 Studies [SEPT. oblivion. For a thousand years it was, as Pliny described it " alterum . lumen Asiae," the second light of Asia; indeed for a great part of that time it had no rival in Asia at all. The Acts of the Apostles have familiarised almost everybody with ." Diana of the Ephesians," whose votaries rioted because St. Paul was destroying the majesty of her " whom all Asia and the world worm shippeth," The great temple' of the Ephesian Artemis, whom the Romans called Diana, was already ancient in St. Paul's day, and it was only the last in a succession of shrines which stretched back to the beginning of history. Ephesus had been for ten centuries the city . of Artemis, the original site from which her cult had spread to .Ronne itself, to Marseilles, and all over the world. When St. Paul spent two years in the city organising the third Eastern Church after Jerusalem and Antioch, the city was the economic capital . of Roman Asia, its greatest harbour and the starting point of its road-system, and had a population of at least half a million. .. After St. Paul's time Ephesus remained great and wealthy for two centuries. When stricken by the first Gothic : irruption into the Aegean world in 262 A.D., it began to exchange_. its glory as the city of Artemis for a new renown as a place of Christian pilgrimage. St. John the Evangelist had spent his last years there, and with him the Blessed Virgin herself, and the ,tombs of both were shown in Ephesus. Timothy had been its first Bishop, and legend added to its shrines the tombs of St. Luke and St. Mary Magdalen. As its worldly prosperity decayed, its fame as a . holy city only increased. In the great Council of 431 A.D. the divinity of the Saviour and Our Lady's Greek title of Theotokos, " Mother of God," were vindicated against Nestorius in the double church of St. John and the Virgin at Ephesus. Justinian in the sixth century built on a hill to the north-east of the ancient city a great Basilica over the tomb of St. John the -Theologian. The name of this Basilica became</page><page sequence="3">1929 Ephesus, Pagan and Christian 451 that of the whole city in Byzantine times, and to-day the Turkish' name for Ephesus is still Ayasulrk, " The Holy Theologian." All through the Middle Ages Christian Ephesus was visited by pilgrims. Almost as famous as the tombs of the Virgin. and St. John were those of the Seven Holy Children, whom the Western world knows as the Seven Sleepers. The tale of their hundred-and eighty years' miraculous sleep seems to have become popular first in the fifth century. The cave where it took place was the centre of a great series of catacombs, unique in Asia, which are only now being fully explored. Through the incorporation of their story in the Koran, the Holy Children became the object of Muslim veneration also, and continued so till modern times. The recovery of the buried fragments of pagan and Christian Ephesus has been the work of the last half century. It began with the explorations of Wood for the British Museum in 1863. Only in 1869, after much effort, was the Artemision, the great temple of Artemis, discovered. In 1874 the Museum broke off the exca vations. Twenty years later, in 1894, the Austrian Archaeological School began the systematic exploration of the city itself. In 1904-5 a couple of seasons' new work by the British Museum unearthed . the earliest foundations of the Artemision. The Austrian scholars, whose task. was interrupted by the war, resumed opera tions in 1926, and during the past few years have made many interesting discoveries, notably that of the cata combs about the cave and church of the Seven Sleepers. In 1921-3 the Greek Archaeological Society cleared the site of Justinian's great Basilica and the tomb of St. John. While there are considerable materials available for the history of later Greek and Roman Ephesus, much still remains to be discovered about the archaic city and about its early Christian . period. The excavations now in progress have already given very interesting results and promise much more,</page><page sequence="4">452 Studies [SEPT. Ephesus owed its ancient greatness principally to two causes, its harbour and its goddess, and to both it clung with all its might when history and nature itself were depriving it of them. The site of the city is now some miles inland, and nineteenth century historians conceived of Ephesus as having been always separated from the sea. The discovery of its character as a seaport is due tQ the leader of the first Austrian excavation. Like its early rival Miletus, Ephesus was gradually ruined by its own river. In the eleventh century B.C., when the city was founded, its harbour . was provided by the tidal mouth of the Cayster, the central of the three rivers of Ionia, and the plain which is now a pestilential marsh was covered by a wide arm of the sea, with a narrow entrance to the West. Five hundred years later this first harbour was turning into a swamp and was , no longer serviceable. After two more centuries, the city itself had to be shifted westwards, leaving its temple which had once been near the sea, high and dry a mile to the east. A new harbour was constructed, but this was subject to silting from its beginnings. A mole was built in a mistaken attempt to deepen it by retaining the water, but only served to retain the silt, and made matters worse. In the end the harbour was noteworthy for its completely artificial character, and was only kept clear by constant effort and great expense. During the general collapse of the third century A.D., and particularly after the Gothic raid of 262 which destroyed the temple, the process of decay was accentuated. The final ruin must have come in the fourth century, about the time when the work of dethroning Artemis, begun under such protests from her citizens by St. Paul, was being completed. In the reign of Arcadius (395-408 A.D. the great main street running from the Theatre to the harbour was repaired and called by the Emperor's name, Arkadiane. In the same reign (406 we are told that St. John Chrysostom caused the still living cult of Artemis to be suppressed. After this</page><page sequence="5">1929 Ephesus, Pagan and Christian 458 time, the harbour soon became an insalubrious morass ; the Fathers of the Council of 431 found Ephesus both unbearably hot and extremely unhealthy. In the middle of the next century, the building of the great Basilica of St. John the Theologian on the hill now called Ayasuluk, just east of the ancient Artemision, marked the definite abandonment of the city's maritime existence ; during the middle ages it centred round the Byzantine fortress on this hill. At the present day, the harbour is an expanse of reeds which make a vast eerie sound when stirred by the wind. It is impossible to estimate the length of the period during which Artemis was worshipped at her Ephesian shrine. The Greek legends tell of the city's foundation by an Athenian colony, whose leader was son of the King of Athens, in the beginning of the eleventh century B.C. But these legends themselves leave no doubt that this colony found the site already occupied. The names of its earlier occupants were variously given as Amazons, Leleges, and Carians. The first of these names belongs. to Greek folklore, and may just possibly contain a picturesque reminiscence of Hittite rule. In any case there is no doubt but that this puzzling race of conquerors were in control of the whole region for a thousand years before the Greeks came.. The Leleges and Carians are more historical; the first were mentioned as the primitive population in many parts of Greece itself and the Aegean islands, but had no separate existence in later times, the second race occurs equally as an element in the pre Greek Aegean population, and was later localised in the region of Asia Minor south of Ionia. What is most interesting about them is their probable kinship with. the Cretans of the Bronze Age whom we have learned to call Minoans. This kinship is certainly reflected in the character of the Goddess of Ephesus. The Acts of the Apostles tell us that the votaries of Artemis believed her image, which was still revered in</page><page sequence="6">454 Studies [SEPT, her temple, to have originally fallen from the sky. As it appears to have been made of gilded wood, this tra dition is questionable, but it indicates the extreme antiquity of the image. The attributes of the goddess, as we know them from the earliest Greek representations of her, leave no doubt that in origin she is identical with the principal divinity of Minoan Crete, whom scholars are accustomed, for want of her earliest name, to call the Mistress of Animals. She is -represented in a heraldic posture on Cretan gems, holding an animal on either side, and is clearly a nature-divinity, powerful at once over life and destruction, birth and death, to slay and to save. The Greeks sometimes worshipped Artemis as Kourotrophos, the Nurse of the Young, and this is one of her Cretan aspects also. In primitive Greece and Crete she is associated somehow with a male god, who may be called the Master of Animals, and has the same dual. functions as her own. This is the later Greek Apollo; and when we remember that Apollo was the god of Colophon, nearest neighbour to Ephesus, and linked by the closest bonds with her Artemis, we need not hesitate to believe that as legend found a direct Cretan origin for Colophon, so the tradition of Leleges and Carians at Ephesus points to a Cretan -origin for her also. In the hills to the west of Ephesus, just south of the entrance to her harbour, there was a place called Ortygia, reputed in local myth to be the spot where their mother Leto gave birth to both Artemis and Apollo. Whether there was an earlier settlement there we cannot tell, but it was always venerated as a holy place by the Ephesians, and when Artemis and Leto were forgotten, pious Armenian pilgrims localised there the tomb of Our Lady. We do not yet know the origin of these names Artemis, Apollo and Leto--which meet us equally early both in Greece and Asia Minor, but may guess that they too were Cretan. Ephesus and Colophon did not specifically acknowledge in later times any external origin for their</page><page sequence="7">1929 Ephesus, Pagan and Christian 455 local divinities ; both were self-sufficient, Ephesus be coming the source of many widespread cults, and the Clarian Apollo of Colophon growing even to threaten the supremacy of Delos and Delphi themselves, and to find devotees in. Roman times as far off as Britain and Numiclia. Local conditions undoubtedly influenced the religious ideas which underlay both cults, and Artemis in particular owed many of her later attributes to Oriental sources. In Cretan art the Mistress of Animals is not winged, as she is always in early Ephesus; and again the celebrated cult-type with many breasts seems to have been developed gradually at Ephesus itself under the influence of the native Great Mother of Anatolia. The recent discovery in the heart of Ephesus of a shrine of Zeus, Cybele, and Attis, serves to emphasise this influence. The Greek tradition told how the Athenian settlers drove the natives of the place from the upper city, on the slopes of the hill running parallel to the southern bank of the Cayster, which the ancients called Pion and the Turks call Panayir-Dagh or Hill of the Blessed Virgin, down towards the shrine of Artemis, a mile north-east. The two groups very soon mingled to form one com munity, however, and it was notable as perhaps the most mixed of all the Greek communities on that coast. Little is known as yet of the earliest city, though the Austrians have now found plentiful traces of it between Pion and the river. Stray historical references tell us of the hetero geneous origin of its tribes, of the fact that it shared with Colophon the significant distinction of not keeping the festival cere600y of the Apatouria, in which all other Ionian cities celebrated their com600 origin ; of its temporary conquest of Samos and its wars with Magnesia to the south. Like other Ionian cities Ephesus had its own literature, producing in Callinus one of the earliest of the world's patriot-poets, and later in Hipponax the world's first</page><page sequence="8">456 Studies [SEPTa literary tramp, whose fragments, written in the " lame " verse of his own invention, are a striking record both of his miseries and of the very mixed Greek spoken by the. people of Ephesus and their neighbours in the sixth century. But perhaps the most famous of all Ephesians was Heraclitus, the philosopher, who flourished about 500 B.C. He was the originator of the still active doctrine that "nothing ever is, all is becoming," and of the pro found saying that "much learning does not teach sense." His teaching was renowned for its darkness, a feature kept up by his school, which lasted after him for a century, and greatly influenced Plato. Before its incorporation in the Persian Empire about 541 B.C. Ephesus, like nearly all Greek cities, had suffered the rule of many dictators. It was plundered about 660 B.C. by the Cimmerians, a wild horde of northern savages. A hundred years later it only saved itself from subjection to the Lydian king Croesus by tying itself with chains to the Artemision, whose goddess was too strong for the king. Later on the laws of the city were remodelled on a Solonian basis by an Athenian lawgiver, one of whose Ephesian disciples is reputed to have assisted in the formulation of the Twelve Tables at Rome. This was the second Ephesian . contact with that city, whose cult of Diana on the Aventine was said to have been copied by King Servius Tullius, from an offshoot of the Ephesian worship. The history of the Artemision in the early period is better known than that of the city which grew up around it. The British Museum excavations of 1904.5 have shown that the earliest Artemision was an open court surrounded by a colonnade, with the ancient sanctuary in its centre. After the Cimmerian destruction in the seventh century continual building seems to have gone on, till finally, in the time of Croesus, about 550 B.C., 1 work was begun on the great archaic temple often called by that King's name. It took a hundred and twenty</page><page sequence="9">929 Ephesus, Pagan and Christian 457 years to build, and on its final dedication the lyric poet Timotheos of Miletus, whose strange rhythms and stranger language have recently been revealed to us in a large fragment of his Persae, received a prize of a thousand pieces of gold for a commemorative ode. Herodotus tells us that King Croesus presented the temple with golden heifers and most of its columns, and an inscription on one of the latter guarantees this statement. It was probably the earliest Greek temple in the Ionic style, and for 'a .long time had no equal ex300t perhaps the great temple of Hera at Samos. Its most peculiar features were the sculptured pedestals bearing short columns on each side of its doorway, and the double rows of columns with sculptures on their lowest drums at its front and rear. Several fragments of these columns are , now shown in the British Museum. Recent American investigations at Sardis, the capital of King Croesus, seem to prove that so far from being unique, as was once thought, these sculptured pedestals and columns were modelled on a Lydian original, and that the " Ionic " style itself may well have derived from Lydia. After Croesus came the Persians, but here alone they venerated the Greek divinity instead of destroying her temple. Ephesus flourished under Persian rule, and was loath enough to join in the great revolt against , it which convulsed the Aegean from 499 till 498 B.C. Nowhere else in Greek lands did Persia leave such an impress as in Ephesus. The mixed character of the -city's population and the strong element of Orientalism both in her art and the cult of her goddess were probably both causes which predisposed her and her masters to mutual liking. Under Persia the worship of Artemis developed charac teristics which never afterwards, even in the heyday of its Hellenism, altogether left it. ' We have of course only very fragmentary information on this ' worship, but can dimly glimpse something of the manner in which it was organised. During all this period it would be 2 G</page><page sequence="10">458 Studies [SEPT more correct to say that the city belonged to the temple than vice versa. Ephesus had very much the character of the immemorial temple-cities of the East, where the divinity was completely dominant over the state. Artemis had hardly yet developed the full quality of universal motherhood which long afterwards produced the well-known many-breasted figures of her on coins and in statues; but her worship resembled in many ways that of the ancient goddesses, Cybele of Phrygia, Ma of Cappadocia, Ishtar of the Semitic peoples, and the Persian Anaitis. Her chief priest was a eunuch, a thing normally abhorrent to both Greek and Persian, but universal in Asia Minor; her priestesses were vowed to virginity. The existence of a highly organised priest hood about her temple, while of course not unknown even in primitive Greek shrines such as Dodona, was itself not a com600 Greek feature. In all probability her ritual, though not apparently involving the frenzied mutilations and obscene orgies of the indigenous deities, was also largely Asiatic in character. One curious feature of her worship, unknown else where, was its association with bees, possibly a speciali sation from her old Cretan , character as lady of all wild things. She is depicted as a bee on her early coins, and this remains the usual type during the Persian period, being only displaced by the classical Artemis-figure after Alexander's conquest. Sir William Ramsay, an eminent authority, even thinks that the mummy-like figure of the goddess found in sculpture and on a few coins, and later developing into the familiar many-breasted figure, was originally a kind of anthropomorphic 'c bee. Her priestesses, if we can trust the scanty evidence, seem originally .to have been called Melissai, "Bees." Persian influence is ,betrayed most clearly in the title of her High Priest, Megabyzgs, a word whose --meaning is uncertain; but side by. side with him there was a college of minor priests, whose chief function seems to have been to pro</page><page sequence="11">1929 Ephesus, Pagan a d Christian 459 vide or partake in a ritual banquet of some sort, and who were called Essenes. This mysterious word may or may not be akin to the name of the Jewish sect; at any rate we are told that in Ephesus it meant " Kings." Ramsay boldly suggests that the original temple-organisation was modelled on that of the hive, and translates Melissai as " Queen -Bees " and Essenes a "Drones." The Greeks, as readers of the Georgics will remember, took the queen bee for a king; but Ramsay thinks that the Ephesians had a knowledge of the bee surpassing even Aristotle, and alone of the Greeks understood its life-history in a somewhat uncanny fashion. His theory is supported by the fact that the Essenes are also called Histiatores, " Feasters " ; but their name itself is never explained as meaning anything other than " kings," nor does Ramsay account for the existence of the Megabyzos as High-Priest over the " hive." The excavation of the earliest strata of the Artemision brought to light a series of reliefs in ivory and stone which in addition to being a600g the most interesting 600u ments of archaic Greek art, illustrate in a striking way the worship of the goddess and her priesthood. There are many representations of Artemis herself, mostly as the Mistress of Animals but with the. addition of wings, and as the Kourotrophos with a child. Three famous little ivory figures seem to represent a priest and two priestesses. The priest is bland and smooth-faced, and wears a heavy embroidered robe, a high round hat, and a long necklace of huge stones which he holds fondly in both hands. One of the priestesses is peculiar for having set upright on her head a long pole with a hawk on top. These figures date from about 700 B.C., and their inspiration is clearly derived from Assyrian and Egyptian sources. Artemis of course owned much property; the most remarkable part of her estate was a lake whose fish were sacred to herself. Besides being a renowned shrine, her temple was also a wealthy bank, the repository of both 2o2</page><page sequence="12">460 Studies [SEPT. public and private treasures and centre of a profitable financial business, and a museum of jewellery and works of art which attracted no less attention than its gaily palxated sculpture and architecture. The goddess, one of whose functions was to protect all life, gave sanctuary to all manner of suppliants, and her shrine was probably the greatest asylum for fugitives in the whole ancient world. The bounds within which such unfortunates could claim inviolability were constantly extended by enthusiastic 600archs, till finally the city itself became infested with rogues, and they had to be confined to the close proximity of the goddess. In the early fourth century B.C., when it had only been completed for about seventy years, the archaic temple was burnt to the ground. A citizen of Ephesus, eager for immortal fame and knowing no better way to achieve it, started the fire. A later loyalty declared that the disaster happened in 340 B.C. on the night when Artemis, nurturer of children, was away in Macedonia ushering. Alexander the Great into the world. In any case Alexander assisted nobly in the rebuilding; the plans were made by his architect Dinocrates, who laid out Alexandria, and the new temple was even more wondrous than the old. It had Praxiteles and Scopas a600g its sculptors and Zeuxis a600g , its painters. It repeated pretty ' exactly the architectural features of the older temple, including the peculiar sculptured pedestals and columns, and was finished by about 300 B.C. From that time till its destruction by the Goths in 262 A.D. it was counted a600g the wonders of the world, and enjoyed its greatest glory. The rioting against St. Paul was begun by one Demetrius a silversmith, whose trade in silver models of the temple was being ruined by the rapid spread of the new religion.: After Alexander's conquest the city also grew in glory with its goddess. Alexander's general Lysimachus com -gelled its inhabitants to move westwards to a new city,</page><page sequence="13">1929 Ephesus, Pagan and Christian 461 which he laid out in great magnificence and supplied with a new harbour.. It was contained between the Cayster, Mount Pion,. and the high hill which runs back to meet the latter at right angles from the river. This was called. by an Asianic name, Koressos; the Turks have given it the poetical appellation of Bulbul-Dagh, "Nightingale Hill." Along the top of this hill ran the western wall of Lysimachus; another wall surrounded Mount Pion to the south and east, and a great gate at its southern corner led to . Magnesia, Sardis, and the interior of Asia Minor. Through this gate passed the yearly procession of the citizens to the Temple, a mile eastward, on the feast of Artemis. On the northern slope of Pion was built the Theatre, where the Jew Alexander tried to quell the mob that rioted against. St. Paul. Between the Theatre and the Harbour ran the great main street of the city, and in this quarter also were the market-place and the Stadion. Ephesus became at .last a Hellenic city; the priests of Artemis received Greek names; the Megabyzus was now called Neokoros, "temple-warden," the Essenes simply priests, and the Melissai Parthenoi, `Maidens." Even the type of Artemis on her coins became Hellenised, and the bee remained only as a symbol. From the time of Lysimachus, as long as her harbour lasted, Ephesus was in a real sense the capital of Asia Minor. She was a coveted prize between the Seleucids, who succeeded Lysimachus, and their rivals the Ptolemies. Her system of government varied according to which power got the upper hand; for the Seleucids favoured democracy, while the Ptolemies preferred a puppet dictator. Antiochus the Great, having established him self in Asia Minor, received at Ephesus both the suppliant Hannibal and the haughty ambassadors of Rome. When his bounds were set at Mount Taurus in 190 B.C., the Romans made over Ephesus to their : allies of Pergamum. Under these, too, the city prospered. They were bourgeois trading 600archs and tried to lay . hands on the sacred</page><page sequence="14">462 Studies [SEPT. fish; but they used Ephesus as their principal seaport, and her coins became their standard currency. One of them, in a well-meant attempt to improve her harbour, built a mole across it which only ruined it, but he -pro vided another further west at the foot of Koressos, which continued effort kept free till the third century A.D. After the Pergamene kingdom was made a Roman legacy in ,188 B.C., Ephesus became the starting point of the Roman road system in Asia. Though the Ephesians, at the bidding of Mithradates, massacred all the Romans in their city in 88 B.C., they could not be deprived of their geographical advantages. Sulla, Julius Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, and Antony, all made Ephesus their headquarters. Under the Empire it became the seat of the Roman financial administration and of a provincial assembly, and the centre , of the Imperial cult in Asia.. Augustus cleverly contrived to associate his worship, which was the veritable cement of Empire, with that of the most important older divinities, and for the future Ephesus rejoiced in being not only Temple-Warden of Artemis, but also of the Caesars. The Emperor gave the city a splendid aqueduct, of which imposing remains still exist, and a new tribe called after himself. She continued to be a most favoured city for two centuries, and was treated with especial kindness by Hadrian and his successor; the latter gave her the title of First and Greatest Metropolis of Asia, which in fact she was. Her local government was popular under the Empire, with the regular machinery of Assembly and Senate; we meet her Town Clerk as a very influential official in the Acts of the Apostles. Local tradition maintains that St. Paul spent part of his two years' Ephesian residence in prison, and points to a tower at the north-western end of the Lysimachean wall as the place of his confinement. The age of this tradition has yet to be established, but Deissmann goes so far as to maintain that the "Prison Epistles " were</page><page sequence="15">1929 Ephesus, Pagan and Christian 463 written in Ephesus, not, as is generally held, at Rome. St. Paul's work in the city was in any case extraordinarily fruitful. He found there a community of Christians, "of the baptism of John," the converts of a very zealous Alexandrian called Apollos who afterwards became the indirect cause of the First Corinthian Epistle. Antiochus the Great had settled a colony of Jews here as in other cities ; many of these were practitioners of arts of healing and incantation akin to the magic for which Ephesus was famous. Some of them tried to use St. Paul's miraculous powers for their profit, with results disastrous to themselves and edifying to others, so that many thousand pounds worth of their magic books were given to the lames.. All Asia hearkened to St. Paul's preaching, and Ephesus took on a new character as a centre of Christian piety. By the unfortunate accident of history her prosperity declined along with her cult of Artemis. The mediaeval city of the Holy Theologian had no corn mercial importance, and sometime in the 13th century fell almost unnoticed into the hands of the Selj uks of Aidin, whose great Mosque of Isa. has too-day been over taken by the same ruin that long ago overwhelmed both Pagan and Christian Ephesus.
