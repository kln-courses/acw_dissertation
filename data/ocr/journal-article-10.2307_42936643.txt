The paradox and uniqueness of Shiva, the ithyphallic ascetic supreme godhead, did not escape the notice of various scholars, who have attempted over a century to examine, rationalize and record the growth and transformation of the cult of the minor atmospheric deity Rudra into the supreme creator god, worshipped in his phallic form the ¡inga. Various esteemed scholars such as S. Kramrisch, T.A. Gopinatha Rao, Dr. W.D. O'Flaherty, N. Venka tara manayy a, P Jash, R. Siddhantasastree and Mahadev Chakravarti have meticulously studied the entire corpus of Shaivite literature and various Shaivite sculptures and have published comprehensive and outstanding works on the history of Shaivism and the various aspects of Shiva. Nevertheless, the subject is far from exhausted owing to the immensity and quintessential details of the early Shiva linga cult with consistent thoroughness (sometimes they are generalized or merely outlined). The present study deals with the emergence of the Shiva linga cult over a time span of three millennia of Indian religious speculation. The time span extends from the end of the Indus Valley Civilization to the dawn of the early Vedic Age beginning with the Vedas continuing into the period of the Brahmanas (a period of rituals, conflicting patterns of creation and theosophical thought) progressing into the Epic and Puranic epoch - a period of crystallization and consolidation of mythology and canonical works in the fields of literature and art. The study attempts to throw light on the gradual development of the cult of Rudra-Shiva and the concept of the Shiva linga . The approach to the subject is historical and uses archaeological aids such as various sculptures, coins, seals, as well as literary and epigraphical references. The work discusses in detail all the factors which led to the birth of the Shaivite cult centered round the worship of the linga.</page><page sequence="2">498 Bulletin of the Deccan College 60-61 (2000-2001) The data point to the importance and wide recognition of this deity and to the linga cult which grew around him. The concept of Shiva evolved out of the minor Vedic atmospheric deity of Rudra who represented the elements of the powerful yet destructive forces of nature. Certain hymns of the Rig Veda and the Atharva Veda allude to his ascetic and ithyphallic nature; therein lies the paradox. It is as early as the Vedas that Rudra is identified with Agni and Soma, the most powerful initiators of the all-pervading sacrifice. This association was an important factor, which bestowed destructive Rudra with fertility and creative traits thereby enabling the worship of Shiva and the linga to become popular in later times throughout ancient India. Gradually his epithets increased as seen in the Shatarudriya section of the Yajur Veda and the Shatapatha Brahmana. Along with his ever increasing epithets and various powers, his ascendancy grew culminating in the Shiva linga cult of the Epics and Puranas. Shiva, besides Vishu, became the most important deity who influenced the concepts and writings of the Puranic authors. Objectives of the Study As expressed earlier, books have already been written on this subject However, most of the works have either emphasized the literary aspect of the subject or concentrated wholly on sculptural evidence. It would appear that there has been very little attempt to examine both art and literature in a chronological framework in order to establish the origin of the Shiva linga cult. A systematic approach to the documentation of cultural objects, their various regional and chronological stylistic differences, and the Shaivite myths that . have a bearing on Shiva's creative aspect in a chronological perspective has been attempted in this research. The research aims to synthesize archaeological evidence and literary data in order to provide fresh insights into the development and significance of the Shiva linga cult. The objective of this study is not to question the symbolism of the linga , its phallic or philosophical connotations. These aspects have been much discussed by previous scholars and perhaps laid to rest by literary texts and, more importantly, the sculptural evidence itself. Rather the thesis questions the lack of evidence of Shiva linga worship in the early and later Vedic period and its sudden emergence in the Epic and early Puranic periods, as seen from literary and epigraphical references to the cult. It is also likely that the linga emerged in its iconographie form before its appearance in literature. The other issues addressed in this research are as follows : 1. What were the various religious and social factors and developments that had such far- reaching implications and consequences, such that a minor destructive deity devebped into a popular fertility cult revolving around the supreme creator and personal god Shiva in the Epic age? What was the rationalization behind the cult object being symbolized as a phallic symbol, especially when the early Vedic people reviled phallic worship? 2. Shiva's urdhvaretas condition is assigned to his ascetic/yqg/c nature in later literary sources i.e. from the Epics onwards. In the Mahabharata, Shiva is the lord of Yoga. In a passage of the Mahabharata , Shiva is the "Ascetic god, whose seed is raised up, whose linga is raised up" (Kramrisch 1981 : 119-170). However, the significance of the erect phallus is paradoxical to the implications of the aesthetic nature of Shiva. 3. The Puranic records are littered with myths that indicate either open hostility towards linga worship or a grudging acceptance of it; they abo suggest conflict between Brahma/Prajapati and Shiva and its resolution. The conflicts have been addressed and given a possible explanation.</page><page sequence="3">Shiva : The Linga Aspect 499 The present thesis is a serious endeavour to trace the motives behind the devebpment of the Shiva ¡inga cult right from the early Vedas, that allowed Rudra to pose as a challenge to the orthodox sect and emerge as the godhead of the Puranic pantheon, superseding Brahma in his creator role of Prajapati, the progenitor. The study has abo drawn certain parallels between the devebpment of the Rudra-Shiva cult with the cult of the Egyptian creator god Osiris and certain other foreign deities and cultural heroes. The analogy does not imply that there has been an interchange and influence of ideas and concepts; rather it attempts to point out the universality of human thought and the expression of certain basic human needs and values. Structure of the Thesis The study is presented in four chapters, each having various sub-headings. The contents of chapters are given bebw : Chapter 1 : This chapter provides introduction to the research study, in which the linga concept and its association with Shiva have been examined. The various sub-headings deal with the knowledge of the significance of the linga symbolism in art; its physical depiction and symbolism which would establish a more comprehensive picture of the development of Shaivism and its linga cult. While the linga's actual physical shape testifies to its phallic aspect, it is evident from later lingas that the mature Hindu religion gradually suppressed, regulated and finally eliminated every type of Phallism. As little is known about the antiquity of the custom of worshipping the linga exclusively, this chapter attempts to trace the chronology of this ancient worship and has made use of ancient texts and popular tradition, as well as early sculptures and coins. This chapter also discusses the regional spread and distribution of the linga from actual sculptural evidence as well as from literary viewpoint Various types of lingas and their merits have also been mentioned in this chapter. The main type of linga is the Manusha linga (made by human hands) and this is the only ¡inga type discussed in the course of present research. Chapter II : This chapter deals with the literary evidence pertaining to the devebpment of the Rudra-Shiva cult and the emergence of the Shiva linga worship. Mythology and sacred lore such as the Samhitas, Brahmanas, Upanishads, Sutras and Puranas have been examined in order to trace the emergence of the Shiva linga, its propagation and popularity, its efficacy and its mode of worship. The origin of the Shiva ¡inga has two sources. This chapter discusses both these sources. One myth relates the castration of Shiva in the pine forests by the sages residing in their hermitages. This myth can be directly related to the story of Agni and the wives of the seven sages. Agni and Shiva are strongly identified with each other from the early Vedas and the Mahabharata reiterates this affinity several times. Although there are different and opposing views stated in the various Puranas discussing the Lord Shiva's motives for venturing into the pne forest in a nude, ithyphallic condition, the climax is the same, his supremacy was accepted; he established his role as the supreme creator god and the tinga becomes the accepted form of worship, far greater than even the worship of Shiva in his anthropomorphic form. The second myth discusses the origin of the ¡inga as an independent ¡inga appearing as a fiery cosmic pillar. This myth gives a philosophical perspective to the ¡inga' there is no reference to the ¡inga's phallic nature. However, as in the first myth, Shiva the ¡inga becomes the supreme form of worship. One of the sub-headings of this chapter also discusses the golden egg, the fiery seed and other myths of creation that establish the supremacy of</page><page sequence="4">500 Bulletin of the Deccan College 60-61 (2000-2001) Shiva over Brahma. It contains myths arid other developments that have led to the cult icon of the Shaivites to being phallic in nature. Chapter III : This chapter records the various lingas discovered from various parts of the Indian subcontinent from the early centuries of the pre-Christian era to the early medieval period (2nd century B.C. - 1200 A.D.) under different sub- headings. A detailed analysis of the evolution of the linga form has been attempted with the help of a chart. It is obvious that the predominant feature of the ¡ingas of the early period is its realistic characterization. The lingas of the post- Mauryan and Kushan periods are truly realistic or anatomically faithful appearance of an erect phallus. Following the Kushan period the linga became conventionalized and gradual stylization set in during the Gupta period. These lingas were depicted with the brahmasutra and parsvasutra design on the Rudra bhaga . The regular tripartite lingas ; which were established during the late Gupta and post-Gupta periods, became the established Shiva linga type. This trend continued in the fourth stage of evolution (the earK; medieval period) until the middle of the medieval epoch i.e. c.600-1200 A.D. These lingas were featured with different types of linga pithas for the purpose of 'abisheka 'testifying to the performance of 'puja and the popularity of the cult. In order to lend support to the notion that the linga is indeed a phallus symbolizing Shiva's generative and creative aspect, this chapter has also documented and examined other sculptures associated with this aspect of Shiva in a chronological framework. These sculptures include ithyphallic sculptures such as the Ardhanarishvara, Harihara, Chandrashekhara murtis (Shiv-Parvati depictions), Shiva as Lingin and Lakulisha, as well as statuettes of Parvati displaying the linga in the background. A chart of sculptures has also been incorporated into this chapter. Chapter IV : This chapter concludes the study of the devebpment of the Shiva linga cult. The observations and comments are based on the integration of the archaeological evidence and literary data. This study has attempted to throw light on the paradox of the ascetic/ithyphallic nature of Rudra. The study discusses his relationship with the other gods of the Vedic pantheon, especially Brahma and Vishnu, as well as the initial revulsion of the texts towards Rudra- Shiv. Rudra-Shiva's obvious identification with Agni and Soma and close association with the sacrifice that is responsible for creation and maintaining the order of the universe has also been examined. The conclusion emphasizes his vegetative aspect and his relationship with Ambika, initially his sister, who later becomes his wife Uma. The role of the 'Yupa stambha' (sacrificial post), the concept of the 'Sambha pillar' and Shiva as Sthanu all conclude the evolution of the linga and its subsequent worship. Certain parallels between the development of the Rudra-Shiva cult with the cult of Osiris, the Egyptian creator god, as well as certain other foreign cultural heroes have been drawn to help explain the transformation of a minor god of death into a god of procreation and the supreme creator.</page></plain_text>
