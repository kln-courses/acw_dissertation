<plain_text><page sequence="1">Psychoanalytic Considerations on the Jewish Passover Totemic Sacrifice and Meal by Leon Grinberg The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the com prehension and diffusion of Freud's concept on totemism, through the investigation and psychoanalytic interpretation of the passover ritual and its comparison with the Eucharist. Although it is true that, among the authors who have studied the latter ritual, a nearly unanimous agreement exists in considering it as a sacramental meal with an obvious totemic content, this is not so for the Jewish Passover, its totemic character being questioned and even completely denied by some psychoanalysts and other investigators. I shall refer, in the first place, to the contents of the sacrifice, presenting a brief historical and psychoanalytic sur vey, since it is the basis of the ceremonials that I shall describe and interpret later on. THE SACRIFICE. According to definition, sacrifice is an offering to the divinity in proof of homage or expiation. The word itself applies to a great variety of rites which may considerably differ in their elements, but having however an underlying common aim. The most interesting rite, in connection with the purpose of this paper, consists in the custom of eating, in a sacramental way, a determined food which represents the god. In primitive times, this symbolic ingestion of the god, on a sacrificial basis, was widespread among peoples having no major geographical or historical connections. Frazer describes, in "The Golden Bough", many ceremonials</page><page sequence="2">392 Leon Grinberg of this type, related to the sacrament of the offering of the first fruits, with special reference to the deities of vegetation. The Ainus of Japan rendered homage to the harvest (7) by making a cake with different kinds of male and female millet seeds; then they assembled, prayed together and ate the cake, blessing and adoring it. This was considered as an oblation to the god, while, at the same time, the god was represented by the seed they had ingested. Among the North American Creeks (7), the feast of the first fruits (busk) resembled the annual purification festival of the Florida Seminoles (7), called the dance of the green corn. In both cases, they ingested, after a strict fast, a nause ating and bitter potion, ' ' to punish their sinful bodies ' ' ; then the offerings were made and the new grain eaten. Accord ing to Frazer, no other form of purification shows so evidently the rite's sacramental virtues. The reason for the purge would be to prevent the sacred food from becoming contaminated by the ordinary food in the stomach. For the same reason, Catholics fast before the Eucharist. The custom of sacramentally eating a loaf of bread, which represents the body of a god, existed among the Az tecas (7). This ceremony was performed twice a year, an image of the great god Huitzilopochtli was made with flour pastry, which cake was then broken into pieces and eaten by the worshippers; with obeisances and tears they ingested what they said were the god's "flesh and bones". This re veals - Frazer comments - that the ancient Mexicans were familiar with the doctrine of transubstantiation even before the arrival of the Catholic Missionaries. The same occurred with the Aryans of ancient India, long before the appearance of Christianism. The custom of killing and ingesting the god in the shape of an animal also pertains to a primeval period of human culture; thus, quite a number of sacrifices of this kind may be described, which were practiced by peoples of widely distant latitudes. To mention only some of the best known ones, I shall refer to the Athenian sacrifice of the "bou phonia" (5), or killing of the bullock, which was annually</page><page sequence="3">Psychoanalytic Considerations 393 celebrated in the Acropolis (s. 5th before Christ), during the full moon; according to tradition, it was instituted in order to stop the drought. The ritual consisted in bringing oxen to the altar of Zeus, where wheat-and-honey-cakes had been deposited. The first one which approached to eat the cakes was elected as the victim of the sacrifice (it was considered as the deity, who was taking possession of that which actually belonged to him). Two men were in charge of the slaughter ing, by means of an axe and a knife, which men fled away after the sacrifice, while the rest of the people skinned the animal and ate its meat. A trial was then held, during which the different culprits of the crime were determined, until finally the instruments employed - the axe and the knife - were condemned and thrown into the sea. There is no doubt that this rite has the sacramental character of the totemic crime, in which guilt is shared by every participant. Some other myths seem to confirm its relation with the crime of the primal horde : according to them, the ox had originally been killed by a foreigner, Sopatros or Dromos, who then escaped to Crete, but who was found and absolved, due to the fact that the Athenians accepted to share the responsibility for the crime. In the Mithraic ritual the sacred animal was the bull. Among the Ainus, a primitive tribe of the Island of Yesso (7), as well as in the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands, a sacrificial cult is practiced in which the victim is a bear, considered as a divinity or son of the divinity; it is killed after prayers of adoration are addressed to it, asking it to return to this world, to be bred once again for a new sacrifice. All the attendants must at least take a morsel of the bear's meat and drink of its blood, "in order that courage and other virtues may pass into them"; the non-participation in the feast is equivalent to excommunication. Other communities practice the same rituals with a horse, a pig, etc. Human sacrifices were equally widespread in primitive times. Those having a propiciatory character may be men tioned among them, as well as others, in which an expiatory victim was designed to redeem the whole community. A par</page><page sequence="4">394 Leon Grinberg ticularly significant type of human sacrifice was that in which the victim was the son of a king. When it was considered that the king should die, a substitute with his same royal or divine atributes was designed, and who but his own son could represent him best? According to Freud's theory (8), the sacrifice was orig inally a result from the primitive man's oedipic conflict. This theory was based on Darwin's and Atkinson's views, which refer to the fact that in ancient times the primitive men lived in small hordes under the rule of a powerful leader, who exerted his power in a despotic and unlimited way; all the women of the horde were his exclusive property and when the jealousy and envy of the males was aroused, these were sacrificed, castrated or expelled from the horde. A decisive step towards the modification of this first type of social or ganization was taken when the brothers who lived in the community joined themselves together in order to kill the father and devour him afterwards. This form of cannibalism was interpreted as an attempt to identify themselves with the father through the incorporation of a part of him. Later on, however, remorse and guilt feelings emerged and the dead father acquired then a still greater power than the one he had possessed during his life. They abstained from gather ing the fruits of their crime and refused to have sexual con tact with the women of the horde. This would be the origin of the taboo of incest and of the institution of exogamy. The Father was then substituted by a strong and fearsome animal, the Totem, and the ambivalent feelings they had had to their father were transferred to it; it was an object of veneration and care; however, they celebrated a periodical feast in which the totemic animal was sacriced and eaten by all the attendants (totemic banquet of Robertson Smith). Totemism, with its veneration for a Father-Substitute, its commemora tive feasts and prohibitions, transgression of which was pun ished with death, constitutes, according to Freud, the first form of religion in the story of mankind. There is no doubt that parricide can be traced as the content of many sacrificial rites. The totemic animal, in</page><page sequence="5">Psychoanalytic Considerations 395 carnation of divinity, was treated with the same ambivalence as the Father. It may be concluded, from the taboo which protected its life and from the very action of its destruction, that there was hatred towards it on one side; but the fear of retaliation in front of the dead's ghost survived, for the revenge it might take against them, and the desire to be freed of this ghost urged them to the complete destruction of the totem. This led to cannibalism : that is to say, to eat and thus annihilate the totem, making it disappear. Certain rites even prescribe the obligation of fully ingesting the victim, without leaving any trace. The orgy that frequently followed the death of the god-totem, during which all taboos were broken, proves that its destruction liberated the worshippers from its influence, at least for a certain time. On the other hand, ven eration and love existed towards the father in addition to the unconscious hatred, and when the loved object was lost, it was psychically and physically introjected and the self became transformed into the symbol of the object : after having eaten it, the worshippers considered that they had been trans formed in the object. Money-Kyrle (16) has raised the question as to whether the totemic sacrifice and meal are actually due to a compulsive repetition throughout the ages, as Freud has asserted. He is rather inclined to believe that the symbolic repetition of par ricide, through the totemic sacrifice, does not necessarily and exclusively obey to the blind impulse towards repeating the past, but that the actual father arouses the same ambivalent emotions as the primitive Father, and, as a consequence, un conscious hatred towards fathers is present at all times. The fear of retaliation explains their attitude of adora tion towards the totemic animal, whose forgiveness they im plore, begging it not to take revenge. In certain rites, the sacrificer had to run away after committing the immolation in order to elude punishment. On the other hand, the sacri fice had at the same time an expiatory meaning, represented by the revenge against the ego, which, having become maso chistic, seeks punishment. It is in fact a crime which turns out against those who commit it. Usually, crime and expia</page><page sequence="6">396 Leon Grinberg tion are fused in the same act. The victim of the sacrifice is at the same time god and man, a symbol of the father and of the rebellious son. The totem is at the same time the fore father and the brother of the clan. The son's tendency to occupy the father's place was adopted and became more deeply rooted through the ages, along with the evolution of mankind. The discovery of agri culture, for instance, increased the son's importance within the family, and new expressions of his incestuous libido ap peared, which were shown by the symbolic gratification he obtained from cultivation of the mother earth. Thus, the divine figures of Attis, Adonis, Osiris, Dionysus and other youthful deities were born, spirits of vegetation, which were favoured with the love of the maternal divinities and com mitted incest with them, challenging their fathers. But the guilty consciousness appears in myths according to which the youthful deities have a short life, or are punished with cas tration, or the fury of the offended paternal divinity, repre sented by an animal (Adonis is killed by a wild boar - animal sacred to Aphrodite -, Attis, Kybele's lover, dies castrated, etc.). On the other hand, a typical feature of the rituals concerning these gods was that they were reborn yearly. An important cult in ancient times was that of Mithra (7), which competed in popularity with Christianism at its dawn. The images showing this young Persian deity sacri ficing bullocks, authorize us to believe that he represented the son who by himself accomplished the father's sacrifice, thus redeeming his brothers from the common guilt. As it is the case with other gods of vegetation, Dionysus (7) is also represented in the myths as being violently killed by the Titans who, sent by Juno, quarter and cook his body, and eat him afterwards; in other versions of the myth, his resurrection is narrated in various different ways. Frequent ly, however, he is conceived and represented as an animal figure, usually a bull, or at least a horned animal. According to another myth, he was torn asunder by the Titans, in the shape of a bull, and the Cretans, when staging this act during the cult of Dionysus, tore a live bull asunder with their teeth,</page><page sequence="7">Psychoanalytic Considerations 397 this being a current feature of the Dionysiac rites. On con sidering the custom of representing the god as a bull, there is no doubt that upon devouring a live bull during their feast, the worshippers believed they were killing the god, eating his flesh and drinking its blood. Another animal shape as sumed by Dionysus was that of a male-goat. But when the god was divested of his animal character and became essen tially anthropomorphic, the killing of male goats during his cult was considered as a sacrifice offered to him, and not as the killing of the god himself. The custom quite widespread among many primitive peoples, of eating in a sacramental way food representing the body of a god, would also be related to the early unconscious phantasy of having ingested and devoured the mother's breast and body, according to M. Klein's point of view (13). This would also explain the reason why such ceremonies and sacrificial practices are accomplished in celebration of the harvest, that is to say, when the mother-earth gives the fruits of her womb, the sons. It must also be added that, on a deep level, totemism im plies also a maternal image. The totemic banquet might be, in the last instance, the accomplishment and repetition of the fantasy of ingesting an animal or totem endowed with the mother's feared, admired and envied characteristics, as well as its contents. To devour and ingest the mother among all the brothers is at the same time a way of diminishing the guilt. On the other hand, sacrifice could be a way of offering a compensation to the divinity, in order that it eats in turn what has been eaten from it. This would also have the meaning of the sacrifice of a certain part, in order to defend the remaining parts from the retaliative revenge of the god dess-mother. FESTIVITY OF THE PASSOVER. After having briefly considered the sacrifice and its meaning, I shall approach the study of the Passover ritual, which, in my opinion, is essentially based on its sacrificial and totemic character, one of the aims of this paper being</page><page sequence="8">398 Leon Grinberg to establish this fact on a sound and convincing base. With this purpose in mind, I shall occasionally resort to the above mentioned historical and anthropological sources. The significance of the ritual itself does not necessarily depend on the meaning it had in its origin, nor on the dif ferent ideas and meanings attributed to it through the ages. In ritual ceremonies, as it happens with dreams, the latent contents suffer a number of modifications (condensation, dis placement, disguise, etc.) through primary and secondary elaboration processes. In this case, primary elaboration would be represented by the primitive manifest significance given to the festivity, in order to make it acceptable to the collective consciousness of the people; secondary elabora tion would refer to the additions, modifications and tergiver sations suffered through the course of time, the aim of which would be to repress, on account of resistance, the latent con tents, so intimately linked with the oedipus complex. The abundance of historical data and Biblical accounts clearly shows that the institution of sacrifice was deeply rooted among the Jews - as well as among other Semitic peoples - since its most primeval existence ; there are in those narratives certain episodes the contents of which are singularly valu able as a source of research. I shall not refer to the many regulations of the Mosaic Law regarding the sacrificial rites, which the Levitical priests had to fulfill strictly, but to those acts which had forcibly to be deformed - as it often hap pens - due to the censorship on the part of the Bible scribes and of the preservers of the oral tradition, which are at times subject to poetical rationalizations. I shall mention as an example the sacrifice of Isaac, in which Abraham, in order to comply with the divine will and in proof of devotion and loyalty to Jehovah, presented his son as a sacrificial offering. But in the instant of raising the knife, his arm was arrested by an angel, who informed him that God rejected his offering and only wanted to test him. "And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns" (Genesis 22, 13) ; he then took his son from the altar and sacrificed the ram instead, in holocaust to</page><page sequence="9">Psychoanalytic Considerations 399 God. The latent content of this Biblical passage seems to confirm, at that time, the existence of human sacrifices (prob ably related to the sacrifice of the first-born as we shall see further on), which were presently substituted by animal sacri fices. These two successive moments in the evolution of the sacrificial rite among the Jews, appear to be condensed in the plastic expression of the Biblical scene referred to above. Another episode which confirms the existence of propi tiatory human victims, is the one of Jephthah (Judges 11) ; upon his triumphant return from a battle, Jephthah promised to offer the first living being whom he should encounter in holocaust and gratitude to God ; with deep sorrow he had to sacrifice his only daughter, who was the first one to give him welcome. Following Freud's thesis, in the sense that if events of an unpleasant content are preserved in legends and tra ditions, it is on account of their historical truth, it can be concluded that, setting aside the rationalization correspond ing to episodes of this kind, they ratify the existence of hu man sacrificial rites among the Jews. In the period preceding the Exodus (12), the Passover was celebrated as a Feast of Nature or Spring, on the night of the Full Moon, coinciding with the initiation of the har vest. It had the characteristics of the agricultural sacrificial rites, so widespread in ancient times, where the first fruits were offered in order to establish communion with the deity. The feast of the Matzoth (4) (unleavened bread), at first considered as a separate festivity, designed to commem orate the Jews liberation from the Egyptians, was subse quently fused with the former one. Begulations required it to be celebrated on the fourteenth day of the month Nisan (this date has become so trascendent for Jewish tradition, that Nisan stands as the first month of the Hebrew Calendar and marks the beginning of the civil year). Each family head had to choose a lamb or goat from the new brood, which had to be killed between the two nights of that day; the lintels and door-jambs were sprinkled with its blood, and the lamb was roasted and eaten accompanied by unleavened bread (Matzoth) and bitter herbs. Every body had to partici</page><page sequence="10">400 Leon Grinberg pate in the meal, and no trace of it could be left for the next day; if something remained, it was burnt in the fire. The bitter herbs testified to the oppression they had suffered in Egypt, and the sprinkling of the doors of the officiants ' houses was to commemorate the episode of the angel sent by God to kill the Egyptian first-born, who "passed over" the houses marked by the Jews. In this manner, their own first-born were saved. One of the most acceptable meanings of the term Pesach - name of this festivity - is precisely the one which grants it the meaning of "passing over", referring to the episode of the angel. Another meaning attributed to it is that according to which the word Pesach would refer to the sacrificed animal (Exodus 13, 21), as well as to the feast itself (Deuteronomy 16, 1). On the other hand, Pesach is the Hebrew word for lameness, and the verb "pesach" means to limp. The priests of Baal performed the sacred dance around the altar with a limp. So, originally the word could have designated a special kind of ritual dance, accompanied by the sacrifice of a lamb, which could presently have been transferred to the sacrifice as such. Pesach may also be con nected with the Assyrian word Pesahu, meaning relief, calm ness, etc., which would give to the festivity the meaning of an expiatory sacrifice. Based on the hereto brief description of how the feast of the Matzoth or Pesach was performed in ancient times, its striking analogy with other festivities, described in the preceding chapter, may be inferred, such as those of the Creeks, Seminoles, Ainus, etc., where the god was sacra mentally ingested during the respective ritual celebration of the first fruits of the fields. Apparently, its sacramental and totemic content has been denied its emancipating character having instead been stressed through the ages. The canticles with which it is celebrated even nowadays, refer almost ex clusively to its liberating character. The question then arises, that if an interest existed to conceal or disguise its actual sacrificial sense, why then did it retain the name of Pesach which, as already pointed out, refers so directly to the sacri</page><page sequence="11">Psychoanalytic Considerations 401 fice? It could be answered that in its most current and ac cepted meaning, Pesach is related to the episode of the angel, who "passed over" the marked houses during the slaughter of the Egyptian first-born. But during the escape from Egypt, and during the Exodus, were there no more significant facts to give a more adequate name to the emancipating content than the one attributed to it? If in spite of the repressive action of the prophets, commentators and students of the Bible, and of the people's collective conscious in general, the festivity retained the name of Pesach, this is surely due to the fact that its deepest and most important meaning was the one directly linked with the sacrifice, and no doubt, es pecially with the sacrifice of the first-born, which, in a dis placed form, was attributed to the Egyptians. Some Biblical commentators (4) deny the existence of the sacrifice of the human first-born among the Jews, which was common among the neighbouring peoples, arguing that "no traces exist of this enormous blood-tax" and that, on the contrary, the eldest sons had rather preference and privileges over the rest of the sons. This objection has no consistency, since it was precisely the most valued one who was sacrificed to the god. On the other hand, if it is accepted that this prac tice was widespread among the neighbouring peoples, it may be not surprising that the Jews had incorporated this costum, like so many other, the influence of which they had been un able to elude. There is no doubt that the Prophets fought arduously against the practice of such sacrifices in Israel, and evidence exists of the transition that operated when they were substi tuted by the sacrifice of animals, plants, fruits and inanimate objects. But the fact that these sacrifices were rooted among the Hebrew people, in a certain period of its history, is proven - apart from the reasons already pointed out - by the following ordinance of Biblical Laws: "Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors : the first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto me." (Exodus 22, 29) "... Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatso ever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both</page><page sequence="12">402 Leon Grinberg of man and of beast." (Exodus 13, 2) "Everything that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the Lord, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: never theless the first born of man shalt thou surely redeem. . (Numbers 18, 15). According to Feldman (6), on having passed through the mother's genitals, "on having opened the mother's womb", the first-born has committed incest, and is considered as a sinner in the eyes of the father. Therefore he is danger ous and must be eliminated. Even at present, among the religious Jews, a ritual is practiced, known as "the ransom of the first-born", in which the father takes the son to the priest or Cohen, and pays him a sum of money ; the priest then blesses and redeems him. In some cases, the kings sacrificed their sons in war time or when their country was in danger: "(King Ahaz) . . . made his son to pass through the fire. . (Kings II, 16, 3) "Then he (King Moab) took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall" (Kings II, 3, 27). I have already referred to the sacrifice of the king's son. It is evident that when harassed and pursued by external aggressions, they resorted to the sacrifice of a part of them selves, in this case their own sons. I shall drop this subject for the moment, to resume it later on, but not without pointing out that in many parts of the Bible, the Jewish people is called the first-born son of Jehovah. Before fully entering into the description and interpreta tion of the Pesach, I should like to stress some aspects which show that totemism existed among the Jewish people. In "Ritual", Reik (17) asserts that "without totemism the Old Testament cannot be understood". All laws concerning the killing of animals, as well as the prescriptions which must be observed in relation to food, have a clear totemic content. The totemic animals of the primitive Jews seem to have been mainly the goat, the lamb and the ram; the bull may also have been among them (according to Reik it actually pre</page><page sequence="13">Psychoanalytic Considerations 403 ceded them). In the Jewish religion, the paradoxical fact is observed that the totemic animal is the only one which may be eaten; this is why the rituals celebrated to kill it are justified. This might be an argument in favour of the thesis that it reproduces a historical truth : the fact of having eaten a part of the mother. On the other hand, the totemic animals of the primitive Jews, goat, lamb, sheep, are traditionally linked with those that supply us with milk. (A similar signifi cance might be found in the cow, sacred animal of India). In the rite celebrated the eve of the Day of Atonement - to which I shall refer later on - during which a hen or cock is sacrificed as expiatory victim which bears the guilt, the prolonged fast subsequent to this rite would be also a sign of expiation and guilt for the phantasy of having eaten the mother. According to Frieda Fromm-Reichmann (11), the ordin ance of exclusively eating cloven-hoofed ruminants would actually be the result of a displacement, designed to mask the fact that they are the only horned mammals (phallic attri butes), since the only fish not defended are those developing horny substances : fins and scales. (Abraham has shown that the position of the Cohenite's fingers during the blessing, imitates the cloven-hoof of the totemic animal.) The small phylactery boxes represent the animal's horns, one of which has been displaced on to the arm, while the straps would be the hide. The parchment of the Pentateuch roll (Torah) must be made from the hide of a clean, surely totemic, ani mal, the same as the ritual robe used for prayers. The prohibition of mixing foods derived from meat with those derived from milk, has as its deepest contents, its sex ual incestuous meaning. In this connection, it is quite signi ficant the following versicle of Exodus (23, 19), where, after referring to the Passover, it establishes the prohibition of mixing milk with meat: "The first of the first fruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of thy Lord thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk". And later on (23, 21): "Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions. . ."</page><page sequence="14">404 Leon Grinberg Naturally, I do not believe that these ordinances appear side by side by mere chance, but rather that the festivity's oedipal content had been grasped. Apart from the incestuous meaning, there is undoubtedly a further content in the prohibition of mixing foods derived from meat with those derived from milk. In my opinion, this would be designed to maintain the dissociation to which the baby has recurred from birth, in order to protect the good object and the good part of the ego from the voracious wishes and attack from the bad object (13) It would, also rep resent a way of being assured that the mother's breast, that is to say, her flesh, or even the mother herself, has not been eaten away together with the milk. The versicle of the Bible (Exodus XXXII), which says: "Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk" would have the meaning of avoiding the destruction of the baby, that is to say, the self destruction in the mother's milk. All these dangers would be avoided by keeping to the food dissociation, by preventing the contamina tion between meat and milk. It has been said that totemism, is essentially related to a group and not to individuals. In this sense, it is necessary to state that for the majority of the religious services held in or outside the synagogue, the presence of at least ten male attendants, over thirteen years of age, is essential. Cere monies such as circumcision or weddings can only take place with the attendance of at least ten witnesses, being essential to have bread and wine which must be ingested by these witnesses. In his book "Ritual", Reik (17) shows that the shophar, the horn of the ram, employed in solemn festivities since the remotest antiquity, reproduces the god's voice, imitating the bull's bellow or the ram bleat, that is to say, the voice of the totemic animal. Michelangelo, in his statue of Moses, repre sents him with horns, as a sign of his divine attributes, when he descends from Mount Sinai. Karl Abraham (1) holds the opinion that the rite which takes place on the Eve of the Day of Atonement, before the prayer of Kol Nidre, is a curious survival of the old totemic</page><page sequence="15">Psychoanalytic Considerations 405 sacrificial cult. In said ceremony, a cock or hen is taken which is made to turn round the head of each family mem ber, while the following formula is recited: "This is my expiatory (*) sacrifice, this is my representative, this cock shall die in my place," after which the fowl is killed and eaten by the family. This is followed by a prolonged fast which represents a self-punishment for having killed and eaten the totem. Abraham stresses the importance of the creation of Kol Nidre, which does not consist of an act, but of thoughts and spoken formulaes, according to the pattern of an obsessional neuroses, and through which responsibility is shared by all. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MOSES IN THE FESTIVITY. Bearing in mind the fact that according to its manifest contents, the Pesach is predominantly related to the liberation from Egypt, Moses significance must of course be taken into account; he is most important, not only due to the interven tion which history assigns him in said event, but because of the significant role he plays in its latent content. In "Moses and the Monotheistic Religion", Freud (9) tries to show the Egyptian origin of the hero. The Hebrew tradition which, naturally, affirms his Jewish origin, gives an etymological basis of the name: "saved from the waters"; it is based on the narrative that the Pharaoh's daughter drew him from the Nile, where his mother had placed him to save him from the slaughter of the Jewish children ordered by the Pharaoh. Freud cites the opinion of several historians who derive the name from the Egyptian language. The Egyptian word "mose" means child and is the abbreviation of more complex names like Amon-mose ( child-Amon), Ptah-mose (child-Ptah), etc. He then compares this with Rank's "Myth of the Birth of the Hero", where the hero usually is the son (*) The well known expression "scapegoat" proceeds from an ancient Jewish custom of considering the goat as an expiatory victim on the Day of Atonement, and by which the sins of the people were transferred to it, which would then be sent to get itself lost in the desert.</page><page sequence="16">406 Leon Grinberg of a king who is thrown into the water in a basket (like Sar gon, Cyrus, Romulus, etc.). According to Rank's researchs, the hero is usually the son of a king who bravely rebels against his father and subdues him. According to Meyer and other authors, the primitive legend would express that the Pharaoh had been warned by the prophetic dream that a son of his daughter would put him and his kingdom in danger. Without entering into a discussion of the degree of historical truth of the various legends, it may be convenient to point out that a common element exists in all of them: a son be comes dangerous to the father or his representative, for which reason his slaughter is ordered. This is in turn linked with the myth of the hero who subdues the father. Among the myths and fables accepted by extrabiblical tradition, there is one referring to Moses at the age of three : while playing on the Pharaoh's knees, he took his crown and placed it on his own head. If tradition has preserved this type of narrative, it is because essentially it contains the elements which un consciously were always seen and wanted to be seen in Moses ; that is to say, the son who, in representation of his brothers, rebells against the father. The latter may be represented by the Pharaoh - as the fable says - as much as by Jehovah himself, against whom, though in a concealed way, he also rebells. Based on the many elements which the Bible and tra dition provides in this respect, it can be asserted, with suffi cient basis, that Moses had not only the character of the rebellious son who rose against the God-father, but that he also represented the god himself, becoming transformed into the totemic figure which drew upon itself the different re actions of the people. Reverting to the myth of Moses, "saved from the waters" by the Pharaoh's daughter, we may discover in it the latent significance of the potential danger represented by him not only as the son who rebels against his father, in accordance with the oedipic situation, but as a danger to the mother as well: the son who, once born, will devour her. The mother's figure appears dissociated: the mother who</page><page sequence="17">Psychoanalytic Considerations 407 throws him into the waters (to save him, according to the manifest contents), and the mother who saves him from the waters. On the other hand, Moses was punished by God and could not enter into the Promised Land, that is to say, he could not enter inside the mother. Many interpreters of the Bible are agreeable to admit that, according to the Biblical texts, Moses comes down from the Mount Sinai with horns, that is to say, the attributes of a sacred animal. There are many indications that show that Jehova was at a certain time adored in the shape of a bull; this would explain that Moses, whose name means "child" and who represents the archetypical son, would have been adored as a calf. On the other hand, Moses has many of the qualities at tributed to Jehovah himself. In various opportunities he had been inflexible and severe in his demands, ordinances and restrictions, which were similar to those of the Divine Father and awakened the same ambivalent reactions the people ex perienced towards God. There was fear and devotion on one side, but on the other, they also felt hatred and hostility towards him for imposing upon them a religion exceedingly spiritual, that restrained their instinctual needs. The de struction of the golden calf represented, in a condensed form, the destruction of Moses as much as of Jehovah, because they were both contained in the animal's image. That is, through said act Moses destroyed himself, and in this destruction the crime was implied, as well as its atonement. In this manner, through self-destruction, he satisfied the hate which moved him to attack Jehovah, as much as his love and de votion towards him. The Biblical version then expounds that Moses, indignant at the people's apostasy, forced them to ingest the molten idol mixed with water. This would be the confirmation of the sacramental rite by which all the partici pants had to ingest the totemic animal. It may be objected that even if the Jews' rebellion against God and Moses himself may be admitted, as it is shown by</page><page sequence="18">408 Leon Grinberg the construction of the idol, there is no base for accepting Moses' rebellion against Jehovah, as I have maintained. In order to avoid major arguments, I shall only refer to two passages of the Bible, one refers to Jehovah's attack against Moses from which the latter was saved by the woman cir cumcising the son (Exodus 4, 25) (certainly Moses himself) ; in the second place, the act of breaking the tables of the law (Exodus 32, 19). Why should God want to attack Moses? This aggression could only be explained if Moses would have committed an error which deserved to be punished with death and from which he could only save himself by means of the sacrifice represented by circumcision; such a mistake could only be the revolt against God. The same may be con cluded from the act of breaking the tables of the Law, al though the Bible pretends to justify it by the anger that possessed him. The materials from which the tables were made, sacred stone, was in its origin the god himself, as Reik has asserted in "Ritual" (17); thence the prohibition of carving the altar stones, which would mean attacking the father. Through this act Moses destroyed the god-stone just as he did when reducing the golden calf to powder. In re lation to the divine character of the stone, Reik cites the wor ship adoration of the stone on the part of primitive peoples including the Jews, to such an extent that it is even possible to speak of a stone-totem. INTERPRETATION OF THE RITUAL. It is important to emphasize the peculiar fact that the celebration of the Pesach, especially the main ceremonial, is preserved even nowadays with almost the same characteristics it had thousands of years ago. The only modification consists in the suppression of the lamb sacrifice, which constituted one of the most solemn practices performed in the Temple of Jerusalem and which, after its destruction, by the force of circumstances, the whole celebration was transformed into a home festivity. The Pesach celebration lasts eight days (seven accord ing to the Bible), starting on the eve of the 14th day of Nisan,</page><page sequence="19">Psychoanalytic Considerations 409 coinciding with the full moon. During these days the Jews abstain from eating common bread, as well as any food based on fermented cereals which are called, in general, with the name of "Jametz". Tradition demands that this requisite be scrupulously fulfilled : every remainder of such food must disappear from the house, and to this effect a rigorous clean ing is undertaken. According to the ceremonial, on the eve of the feast, the head of the family, accompanied by some of its members, goes over the whole house, minutely examining every corner and burning the remnants of Jametz he may still find. The utensiles and dishes used during the year are sub stituted by new ones, or purified. During these days unleav ened bread (Matzoth) is eaten, "in memoria of the haste with which they had to escape from Egypt, and due to which the dough prepared for the bread did not have time to fer ment". On the other hand, the Matzoth is considered as the bread of privation, the symbol of the oppression suffered in Egypt. Based on analogies existing between this festivity and the classical cults of antiquity, as the one of Adonis, etc., Arthur A. Feldman (5) interprets the ritual of the search for and suppression of the Jametz on one hand, and its substitu tion for the Matzoth on the other, as the god's death followed by his resurrection, which constitutes the fundament of this kind of ritual. There is no doubt that on one level the Matzoth repre sents the totemic object ; but taking the hypothesis I have set forth as a starting point, i.e., that the ceremonial of the Pass over represents, in a condensed form, the totemic crime parricide, as well as its expiation and renunciation to the instinctive impulses which motivated it, on another level I interpret this part of the ritual as the absolute prohibition of the desired incestuous relation with the mother. The rigor ous demand of experiencing a new and different situation, with a fundamental change of food, refers, without doubt, to the compelling necessity of changing the desired sexual objects ; in their place, the other unsavoury one will have to</page><page sequence="20">410 Leon Grinberg be accepted. The Bible repeatedly insists on the strict cele bration of the ritual, with particular emphasis on the pre scription of eating the Matzoth, the bread of affliction, during the seven days, in remembrance of the slavery in Egypt. It is significant that during a festivity which pretends to com memorate emancipation, elements symbolizing opprobium and domination prevail, instead of those meaning liberation. We can suppose rather that these elements persisted in order to express the annulment of rebellion and of the father's death, and the return to the former situation of submission and "slavery". One must abstain, then, from eating the leavened, delicious bread instinctively coveted, being reduced to eat ing the flat, thin, insipid bread, the bread of "affliction". (This must have been the origin of exogamy in the primitive horde). Psychoanalytic investigation has shown the symbolic sexual content of food, as can be confirmed by dreams and folklore. The food change imposed with such an inflexible severity may represent, at the same time, the weaning and subsequent mourning originated by the loss of the breast. This would explain the element of mourning evident in the whole ritual, which would be at the same time a feast of liberation, growth and ripening. The good and tasty leavened bread is the breast, the food instinctually coveted. To accept the Matzoth, the flat, lean unsavoury bread of affliction would imply the possibility of renunciation of the breast and acceptance of the new type of food. In many sacramental rites and especially in the sacrifice of the first fruits, it is taboo to mix the remnants of the old crop with the fruits of the new harvest ; this taboo is designed to avoid contamination. In this respect, I wish to recall the custom, existing among the Creeks and Seminoles, of taking a purge before eating the new grain. The period of fasting observed in other rituals, previous to the ingestion of the sacramental meal, would correspond, on one level, to the same end. The food taboos, so common among the Jews, would reveal the same prohibition of incest. An evident ex</page><page sequence="21">Psychoanalytic Considerations 411 ample would be the taboo of mixing meat and milk. One of my patients, who suffered from an obsessional neurosis, imposed on himself severe alimentary restrictions and taboos of contact, which had the following origin: At the beginning, and due to having had a serious quarrel with his father during a meal, he decided not to eat one of the latter's favourite dishes based on cheese, because, as he said, if he acquired the things his father liked or belonged to him, he would feel remorse and would not be able to insult him freely in his thoughts. Gradually this was extended to other foods and finally to any object his father touched; any in voluntary contact with such objects urged him to prolonged and careful hand-washing as a means of purification. Analysis showed the oedipal content of this symptom, where the food had acquired a maternal significance. The main ceremonial of the festivity receives the name of Seder, its literal translation being "order". This refers to the obligatory sequence of the ritual's different steps. The father presides over the ceremony, or in his absence, the oldest person present. The table, adorned at its best, exhibits distinctive signs of the festivity. Placed at its head is the most important object of the whole ceremonial, the "tray" of the Seder, which contains different foods, the symbols of the Seder. According to tradition, this tray is considered as a substitute of the primitive altar; consequently, its content is related to the sacrificial animal and, more exactly, to some portions or partial representations of it. According to the concept that the animal of the sacrifice is the totemic animal, in the last instance representative of the divinity or of the father, I interpret that the food of the tray, established by the ritual, constitutes different symbols of the father's geni tality ; essentially, this is what one desires to incorporate in a sacramental form. The tray rests on three superposed pieces of Matzoth. The one in the middle is taken out and broken in two halves, one of which, denominated "aficoman", is concealed by the officiant, to be redeemed later on (thus the ceremony de mands), generally by the youngest son.</page><page sequence="22">412 Leon Grinberg In general, the number three is a symbol of masculine genitality for the unconscious. In this case, the father's geni tality would be represented by the Matzoth which is broken in two, which would be the penis. The act evidently ex presses the castration and theft of the father's virility, which is carried out by the youngest son, vindicator of his brothers. This would be confirmed by the manifest rivalry between the father who conceals, and the sons who want to redeem, and by the custom that the father pays a tribute (a sum of money, etc.) to the son who has vanquished him. According to Freud (10) : "The idea of the hero is probably linked with the personality of the youngest son who, preferred by the mother and protected by her from paternal jealousy, was the one who succeeded the father in primitive times". The cus tom of the tribute which the father must pay, reminds us of the already mentioned ritual: the "redeeming of the first born ' ', although this time practiced in an inverted form ; it allows for the supposition that the youngest son would also represent the eldest one in his rivalry and contest for the coveted and prohibited sexual object - the mother. On another level, this object would be that part of the Matzoth denominated "aficoman", which the father conceals and makes disappear from the covetous looks of the sons. To the effects of the ritual, the three pieces of Matzoth I have re ferred to, are considered as being of a nature different from the remaining ones. They are separated and wrapped in a white cloth, and cannot be eaten nor touched until the mo ment the ritual is performed. The remaining contents of the tray, with their names in Hebrew, are the following : 1) Zroa: Meaning arm or power; is represented by a roasted bone of lamb, which replaces the sacrificied animal, and constitutes the "korban pesach" (passover sacrifice). It is pertinent here to insist on the fact that said symbol ex presses the father's virility in a more specific form. The current acceptation indicates that it represents the power of the Eternal, as well as his arm, because he was successful in rescuing the Jews from Egypt. It is therefore manifestly</page><page sequence="23">Psychoanalytic Considerations 413 accepted that said bone or animal of the sacrifice is the god himself; this can only be explained as a return of the re pressed, because no other allusion exists in the sacrificial cult which would point to a direct identification of the sacrificed animal with the god. On the other hand, I do not think it necessary to emphasize the symbolic significance of the arm as a displacement of the penis, and of power as an expression of virility. 2) Betza : is the name of the boiled egg which is placed on the tray just next to the Zroa, its genital content being evident. Tradition assigns to it a curious meaning: that of expressing the mourning for the destruction of the temple. Another version interprets it as a sign of sorrow, which cannot be absent in any festivity commemorating the periods of want suffered by the Jewish people; and, what is even more significant, it has also been interpreted as the mourning for the death of the Egyptians. This would speak in favour of guilt feelings related to the Egyptian's death, who repre sent the father in a displaced form. 3) Jaroset: a soft paste, mixture of apple, nut, almond, cinnamon, wine and honey, placed under the lamb bone, which traditionally represents the mortar with which the Jewish slaves built the pyramids. Possibly its deeper mean ing is that of representing the procreative seminal liquid; not only because of its location close to the lamb bone, sym bol of the penis, but due to the circumstance that the tradi tional interpretation relates it to the mortar placed beween he stones. In many unconscious contents the stone represents the testicle, and there would therefore be a relation between stone and father. 4) Carpas: aggregate of vegetables which are usually soaked in salt water; it is identified with cotton or Hyssop leaves (in Hebrew Carpas means cotton), with which the doors of the houses were marked, after having been im mersed in the blood of the paschal lamb. Some students of the Bible found that the word "carpas", read in reverse in Hebrew, is decomposed into the particle "S" (suppression)</page><page sequence="24">414 Leon Grinberg and "perej" (tyrant): it is the elimination of the tyrant father. All of these alimentary symbols must be eaten by all of the participants without exclusion, with which one of the basic requisites of any sacramental rite would be fulfilled. One of the important rites of the ceremonial, usually observed in a strict and absolute way, is the hand-washing of the officiant, an act soon imitated by the other male par ticipants; it has the meaning of purification for the crime committed, and just like the compulsive symptom of an ob sessional neuroses, it implies an attempt of reparation and liberation from the feeling of guilt. The ceremony is initiated with the recital of the Kidush, at the same time and expression of thanksgiving and of the sanctification of the festivity, after which the father gives the blessing and sacramentally distributes the contents of the tray of the Seder. Then follows the reading of the Haggada (nar rative), the book of instructions, rituals, prayers and legends, anecdotes and parables related to the Exodus and to the feast in general ; this constitutes the answer to the four ques tions with which, according to the ritual, the youngest son requires the explanation of the festivity from the father. Af ter the explanation and canticles, the meal is served. All of the participants, both adult and children, have a cup of wine each; its ingestion during the Seder is also subject to the prescriptions of the ritual, which stipulates that it must be done in four turns. The wine, blood of the grapevine, represents the blood of the totemic animal, i.e., the father. In relation to this, among the severe Jewish meal rituals, I consider of great importance the one referring to the absolute prohibition of ingesting the animal's blood. For this reason, and in order to eliminate the liquid which contains the soul or vital force of the dead (*), the complete bleeding of the animal is re (*) According to the primitives' concepts regarding the soul, it is possible to deduce that in some cases the soul may be equated to the penis.</page><page sequence="25">Psychoanalytic Considerations 415 quired. " .... for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh." (Deuteronomius 12, 23). The same restriction referring the blood can be observed in many primitive tribes, and a basis exists for supposing that the blood was directly linked with the organs of reproduction; some ancient peoples used blood to water their plowed fields and thus assure their fertility. In the myth and ritual of Adonis, on the so-called "day of the blood", the novices sacrificed their virility, and the castrated parts together with the blood offering were deposited upon the altar or buried in the ground in order to advance the god's resurrection. Since the limits of this paper prevent me from a more ex tensive analysis of this problem I shall only establish the relationship between the ritual of the circumscision substitute of the sacrifice, with the above mentioned one; in ancient times the cut-off foreskin was buried, probably with the same meaning as in the myth of Adonis. I have already referred to the ancient custom of sprinkl ing the door-jambs and lintels with the blood of the sacrificed animal during the celebration. According to the well known symbolism of the house as the maternal womb, the door jambs and lintels representing the vulva, sprinkling them with the blood (seminal liquid) of the totemic animal would imply the recognition and acceptance of the parental coitus, this being the condition sine qua non to prevent retaliation. If, according to these considerations, the blood also represents the vital force, that is to say, virility, the taboo placed upon its ingestion, so often repeated in Judaical law, would be explained. This taboo could only be violated, symbolically, in the form of wine, during the solemn occasion of the totemic meal. I would like to emphasize here the importance of the symbolic content of the number four in the ceremonial of the Seder, since it appears repeatedly during its development and has been pointed out by many commentators. At a given moment, it is the youngest son (the hero) who, by means of four questions, requires the explanation of the festivity from the father. Four times the Bible mentions the duty of</page><page sequence="26">416 Leon Grinberg narrating the Exodus from Egypt to the sons. The Haggada refers to four disciples to whom the ceremony is described and explained. Furthermore, I have already pointed out the duty of drinking four cups of wine. In Jewish history the number four is fundamentally re lated to the four mothers of patriarchal times : Sarah, Rebec ca, Rachel and Leah. C. E. Carcamo (3), in his paper "Image of the World in Aboriginal America", based on vari ous ethnological sources and on analytical material, also em phasizes the maternal content in the symbolic valuation of the number four. (*) Therefore, I interpret that the number four, which appears repeatedly in the ritual, must have a meaning, the function of expressing the attempt of a return towards the mother. In my opinion, the number four and its different contents would confirm the participation of the maternal image and of the pre-oedipal conflict in the ceremony. The same would apply to the assertions of some phychoanalysts in the sense that in its origin the religion of Israel was characterized by the worship of a goddess-mother, which would reflect the social conditions prevailing at that time, i.e. matriarchate. Perhaps the transition from matriarchate to patriarchate would correspond to reasons similar to those which cause in the baby the transition from breast to penis, i.e. anxiety, guilt, etc. It seems pertinent to point out that before entering the land of Canaan, Joshua and the Jews were circumcised in order to purify them and to reestablish the covenant with God ; after said act, they celebrated the first Passover in their country. I interpret this in the sense that before returning to the mother, they submitted again to the father because of their guilt, by castrating themselves. In this case, the two consecutive acts; the circumcision and the Passover, reveal an identity in their sacrificial content. (*) In a personal communication, A. Bascovsky informed me of hav ing found a maternal significance in relation to the number four in the dreams of some of his patients.</page><page sequence="27">Psychoanalytic Considerations 417 Some psychoanalytic investigators found that in its origin the religion of Israel was characterized by the adora tion of a goddess-mother, due to the influence of the neigh bouring peoples' beliefs. It was based on the mother-son relationship (Astarte-Adonis) and reflected the social con dition prevailing during that matriarchal period. Subsequent ly, a tendency appeared towards the repression of the cult of this maternal deity, which was then replaced by the adora tion of an only god, Jahveh, and with this a transition to the patriarchal system was established; but manifestations ap peared later on, which denoted a return to the former cult, although in a derivative and symbolic form. According to A. Feldman (5), the mother was perpetuated in the concept of the Torah, and the son in the idea of the Messiah or in the people of Israel, as the first-born and only son of God. The sanctification of the Sabbath on the basis of a feminine representation (the rabbinical greeting of the Sabbath: ' ' Come, oh my betrothed one ' ', would be an example of said assertion), and the festival of the full moon, would have the meaning of an approach towards the mother on the basis of an incestuous relationship. From this point of view, and as a confirmative element of my thesis, it is suggestive that the festival of the Passover is held, precisely, on the night of the full moon. Finally, I shall refer to an act of the ritual which takes place during the period following the dinner. At this point of the ceremonial, the door is opened to permit the entrance of the prophet Elijah, whose visit is expected in every home during the celebration, and who comes to announce the com ing of the Messiah who will lead his people back to the Holy Land. To this effect, a cup of wine is reserved which is specially destined for him, and while all the participants stand up, reciting a prayer of welcome, the door is opened to receive him. I interpret that this practice has issued from the need, on the part of the community, to assure the return of the destroyed and devoured god-father by means of his resurrection, just as it occurs in other rites, due to the devo</page><page sequence="28">418 Leon Grinberg tion existing on the level of ambivalence as well as to the fear of reprisal. PARALLEL BETWEEN THE JEWISH PASSOVER AND THE EUCHARIST, MOSES AND CHRIST The Eucharist, central rite of the Christian Church (5) derives from the Jewish Passover meal in which Christ pro nounced the words which gave origin to its institution. It was during the last supper before his crucifixion when Jesus - surrounded by his twelve apostles, possibly representing the twelve tribes of Israel - took the bread, and distributing it among them, said: "Take, eat: this is my body", and doing the same with the wine, he expressed: "This is my blood". If these words were so momentous, as it has been subse quently demonstrated, this was due to their content of truth for the unconscious. It can be compared to a psychoanalytic interpretation, which, when it is exact and opportune, finds resonance and is fully accepted. There is no doubt that the Matzoth as well as the host have the same meaning: the body of the victim. So much so, that Christ was subsequently called the Paschal Lamb. In this sense, it may be pointed out that the fundamental difference existing between both rites, lies on the fact that what is manifest content in one, is only found on the latent level in the other. Among the elements common to both, one offers special interest. I have mentioned, during the description of the Seder, that at a given moment the officiant takes a piece of Matzoth and breaks it into two halves. The same occurs with the host in the instant after its consecration, in which the priest splits it in two parts and drops the particles of one of them into the wine, interpreting the act as the resurrec tion through the union of the body with the blood. Just as in relation to the cut-off piece of Matzoth, I interpret that symbolically it represented the father's penis (since parri cide castration is also sought), I can affirm the same meaning for the piece of the host which is mixed with the wine. Ac cording to the above mentioned ritual of Adonis it is per tinent to suppose that in this case too, the resurrection would</page><page sequence="29">Psychoanalytic Considerations 419 be expressed through the union of the genitals with the blood offering. Both rituals are characterized by the presence of a cen tral figure, which in a condensed form represents the god father as well as the son, but with the difference that in one case it is latent and in the other manifest : Moses and Christ. Given the existing analogies, if a parallel was established be tween them, the identity they had acquired for the uncon scious of their respective peoples would be justified. Both participate in a certain sense in the "myth of the birth of the hero": Moses on escaping the slaughter of the Jewish chil dren ordered by the Pharoah, and Jesus on escaping the mur der of the children of Bethlehem, determined by Herodes' fear of the prophecy that the god of the Jews would arise among them. Moses offered himself before Jehovah as the victim for the people's sins, and implored to be erased from the Book of Life if his brothers were not forgiven; Christ accepted crucifixion of the expiatory victim in order to re deem humanity. In the language of the primitive totemic animal, the former was the calf and the latter the divine lamb. According to Freud's (9) supposition, based on Sellin and other historians, there exists the possibility that Moses might have been killed by the Jews as a reprisal, because he represented a tyrant-father; guilt feeling and remorse may have given origin to the phantasy of the return of the Mes siah, who would bring salvation and redeem humanity. In this sense, Freud says, Christ's resurrection would contain an element of historic truth, because it would represent Moses' reappearance, that is to say, the reappearance of the primal Father of the horde, but transfigured and the son occupying the place of the father. Moses was not only the deliverer who saved his people from Egyptian tyranny and oppression, and gave the charac ter of an emancipation feast to the festivity of the Passover, but moreover he was the son who, in representation of his brothers, rebelled against the father; but the latter aspect, though implicit, is not pointed out in the Hebrew tradition. Christ also gave a character of liberation to the last paschal</page><page sequence="30">420 Leon Grinberg supper, from which the Eucharist derived, which in fact meant the substitution of the religion of the father by that of the son. In this sense, and according to Freud's assertion, Christ was the heir of an ancestral phantasy-desire: that of each member of the horde, to perpetrate the crime by him self and substitute the father. To obtain this, Christ had to appear as the redeemer who sacrificed his own life. On this level the Christian doctrine could accept the guilt emanating from the original sin, because it was sufficiently atoned for through the sacrifice of the son. The important thing to point out, then, as the essential difference between both doctrines, and which in its turn would explain the interpretative difference assigned to their respective paschal rites, consists precisely in the different re actions towards the guilt feeling determined by the funda mental or original sin, which is no other than the rebellion against the god-father. According to Freud (9), the great tragedy of the Jewish people consisted in that, with the accustomed tenacity, the Jews continued denying the death of the father, and this was the reason for their having to expiate their guilt throughout the centuries, since it has been a permanent reproach to them : You have killed our God. And this reproach refers to the history of religion. In other words, this could be expressed in the following way: "You do not want to admit that you have killed your God (the primal father and his subsequent incarnations) ; on the other hand, we have done the same thing, but we confess it and since then we are purified and absolved ' Due to the acceptance and confession of said guilt (al though not referred to the violent death of the god, but dis placed and substituted by the supposition of an obscure orig inal sin), the Christians could manifestly admit that the sacrificial victim was God's own son, who, as the expiatory victim, bore the sins of the others in order to redeem them. But that first aspect served to conceal the important fact that the martyrised victim became god in its turn, which awakened in the people the desire to identify themselves with him. On</page><page sequence="31">Psychoanalytic Considerations 421 a deeper level, it represented the own god-father whom one desires to kill and eat, incorporating his power. In the Jewish ritual repression was carried to a maximum, because the first formulation of the recognition of guilt was not fulfilled, and therefore few elements of the latent content passed into the manifest one. CONCLUSIONS In short, I have arrived at the following conclusions in relation to the study of the festival of the Passover: A) 1) Its sacrificial character: based on a) the demonstra tion of the existence of a great number of sacrificial rites among the Jews, even human ones, since the most remote an tiquity; b) the designation of the manifest content of the ritual of the Seder tray, as symbolic substitute of the sacri ficial altar; c) the etymological content of the name Pesach, which refers to the sacrifice in a direct form, as well as to the slaughter of the Egyptian first-born, which alludes, in a dis placed way, to the sacrifice of the Jewish first-born ; d) the fact that it derives from ancient festivities - as the one of the offering of the first fruits -, in which it was customary to sacrifice animals which represented the god, as a sign of gratitude and alliance with the deity. 2) Its totemic character: a) because the sacrificed ani mal generally was a sheep, which on the basis of different confirmative elements showed itself to be one of the Jews' totemic animals ; b) through its relation to the history of the Exodus, in which Moses' figure not only had the character of the rebellious son - hero - who represents the brothers, and who arose against the god-father, but also represented the god himself; both images being condensed in the totemic content of the golden calf, which was destroyed and sacra mentally ingested by the people; c) through the alimentary taboo prescribed during the festivity, similar to other severe rituals regarding food which exist in the Jewish religion, and which are directly related to the totemic laws. 3) Its sacramental character: a) by the obligatory par ticipation of all the commensals in the different rites of the</page><page sequence="32">422 Leon Grinberg ceremonial, especially in the ingestion of food, since totemism deals with the group and not with the individual, with the object of "sharing guilt" according to the classical assertion of R. Smith ; b) through its analogy with other common rites in which bread and wine are sacramentally ingested. B) Analyzing the different parts which compose the ritual, I was able to formulate the following interpretations : 1) On one level, the suppression of all food based on fermented cereals - Jametz - and its obligatory substitution by unleavened bread - Matzoth -, represents the respective death and resurrection of the god-father; but furthermore, it has the meaning of submission to the father - due to re morse and guilt - together with the renunciation to the pro hibited and desired incestuous relation, food representing the taboo sexual object. This is based on the analogy with other similar alimentary taboos, and on the well known sexual symbolism of food. 2) The different alimentary substances contained in the tray of the sacrifice are partial representations of the totemic animal, and more directly, constitute the symbols of the father's genitality, which in its essence is what one desires to incorporate sacramentally. 3) The father's castration and the theft of his virility on the part of the youngest son (hero) who thus redeems his brothers, is symbolically represented in the rite of breaking the Matzoth in two, in its concealment and recovery by the son, and in the payment of the ransom. On another level, the piece of Matzoth which the father conceals and the son finds, his rivalry thus becoming manifest, is the sexual desired ma ternal object. 4) The blood of the totemic animal, represented by the ingestion of wine, moreover has the meaning of vital force directly related to virility, as is shown in the so-called "day of blood" of the Adonis rite and other similar ones, and by the custom, in the ancient celebration of the festival, of sprinkling the door-jambs and lintels (feminine genitals) of the houses with blood (seminal liquid). Thus, the strict taboo regarding its ingestion would be explained.</page><page sequence="33">Psychoanalytic Considerations 423 5) The number four, of repeated appearance during the course of the ritual, would have a symbolic maternal con tent, as other investigators have verified, and its function would be that of expressing the desire to return to the mother, as a return of the repressed; proof of the same is that the festival is held on the night of the full moon, which is related to a maternal content. 6) The ritual of hand-washing which is repeated several times during the ceremony, is an obsessive symptom which expresses the feeling of guilt for the oedipal crime, as well as an attempt at reparation. 7) The same content, although in a different way, can be appreciated in the rite of opening the door to receive the prophet Elijah, which expresses the wish for reparation, an nuling the crime and assuring the return of the father by means of his resurrection. C) Finally, on comparing the Jewish Passover with the Eucharist, it emerges that the former, on being unable to ad mit the guilt for parricide, falls under the effects of an intense repression, due to which very few elements of the latent con tent pass into the manifest one. On the other hand, the totemic ingestion of the god is manifest in the latter, due to a previous, though displaced, acceptance of guilt.
