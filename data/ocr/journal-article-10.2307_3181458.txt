Ogundiran Florida International University University Park, Miami The spatial thresholds of ceramic spheres and interaction networks are delineated in the Toruba-Edo region, sw Nigeria, between the 13th and 19th centuries A.C. in order to understand the relationships between the regional periphery of Ilare district and the major political centers and the events that originated from them. This study assumes that the intersocietal movement of commodities reflects regional interaction systems. Integrating the distribution of ceramics with local settlement history demonstrates that ceramic styles in Ilare district were configured by regional migrations, sociopolitical growth and decline, and economic links. What is more, changes in the structure of regional socioeconomic and politi- cal networks are more likely to appear earlier in the regional peripheries than in the metrop- olises. Introduction A regional system of interacting sociopolitical units, united by the institution of kingship as the mainstay of so- cial relations, societal structure, and worldview, developed in the Yoruba-Edo area of sw Nigeria between the 11th and 19th centuries A.C. (FIG. i). The social networks and interactions that sustained this system have been articulat- ed largely in terms of the relationships among the three dominant sociopolitical centers (cores) -Ile-Ife, Benin, and Old Oyo (Agbaje-Wllliams 1987; Babayemi 1981; Eyo 1974). As a result, the hinterland non-centers and pe- ripheries are only poorly represented in the archaeological literature, even though regional peripheries represent the routes of articulation between large centers and are usual- ly the first to manifest changes in the structure and mode of socioeconomic and political networks (Green and Perl- man 1985; Upham 1992). This paper examines the trans- formations in the regional networks of interactions and re- lationships in sw Nigeria, with emphasis on Ilare district, a periphery of political centers through which regional net- works crisscrossed between the 13th and 19th centuries, but whose relationship with the metropolitan centers of Ile-Ife and Old Oyo is only now being studied (Ogundiran 2001). The decoration and forms of ceramics are considered here as signposts of intersocietal contacts, and the degree of ceramic homogeneity in a region is related to social dis- tance among the member communities (MacEachern 1994: 220; Stark 1998: 8). This paper considers two re- lated questions: 1) what are the formal and stylistic prop- erties of the ceramics in Ilare district and the historical con- texts of their distribution in the Yoruba-Edo region? and 2) how did the growth and collapse of regional centers and the shifts in the directions of population movements affect the local distribution of ceramic forms in Ilare district? Yoruba-Edo Region: A Cultural Historical Sulmmary Six major cultural historical phases are discernible for the Yoruba-Edo region from about A.C. 500 to 1900. These are Early Formative (500-800), Late Formative (800-1000), Classical (1000-1400), Early Intermediate (1400-1600), Atlantic (1600-1800), and Late Intermedi- ate (1800-1900). The Early Formative refers to the prolif- eration of iron-using communities and village-level so- ciopolitical units, and their subsequent aggregation into loose confederacy-like political associations. The Late For- mative marked the advent of incipient political centraliza- tion that laid the foundation for the Yoruba kingship insti- tution. The emergence of Ile-Ife as a city-state and as pio- neer of the political structures and ideological parameters that defined the worldview of the Yoruba-Edo region her- alded the Classical period around the 11th century (Willett 1967: 66). By establishing itself as a regional economic center and using its ideology of kingship and material wealth to form and cement networks of relationships with</page><page sequence="2">28 Ceramic Spheres in the Yoruba-Edo Region, Nigeria/Ogundiran Figure 1. Yoruba-Edo region, sw Nigeria. The large inset box shows the area of Figure 7. the surrounding areas, Ile-Ife was by the 12th-13th cen- turies the political and cultural hub of the Yoruba-Edo in- teraction system. The chronology of kingship institutions in the region shows that Ile-Ife influenced the emergence of sociopolitical centers in rapid successions during the 12th-13th centuries as village communities were re- ordered into urban-based political units with royal dynas- ties and elaborate hierarchies of officials. The regional in- fluence of Ile-Ife was strengthened by its status as the main producer of beaded crowns, glass beads, and other para- phernalia and symbols that served to identify royal and elite personalities in the region (Horton 1992: 123). These symbols were crucial to the development of Ile-Ife as a pri- mate center in the region; many would-be dynasts visited Ife-Ife and made alliances with it to establish and validate their own political power and ideology (Akinjogbin 1992: 111). Between 1400 and 1600, the region underwent drastic changes in the configuration of regional political power as new polities, dynasties, and political entrepreneurs emerged mainly through the systematic destruction or weakening of the old ones. From 1600 to 1800, the entire region lived in the shadows of the Benin and Old Oyo hegemonies and in a milieu of economic transactions that were tied to the Atlantic trade. The integration of the re- gion into the transatlantic commerce during the 17th cen- tury reflected the hegemonic ambitions of Benin and Old Oyo and the waning of Ife's regional political influence. The emergence of the Atlantic coast as the focus of long- distance trade networks created new interaction routes, market centers, and forms of sociopolitical alignments and interaction spheres. The collapse of the Old Oyo Empire at the beginning of the 19th century and the massive popula- tion displacements that followed not only reordered the regional balance of political power but also created new so- cioeconomic networks. Ilare District: Historical and Archaeological Background The archaeological sequence in Ilare district straddles the Classical through the Late Intermediate periods. Exca- vations in the district were conducted at the settlements of</page><page sequence="3">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 28, 2001 29 Figure 2. Topography of Ilare district and plans of excavation areas. Grove, Iloyi, Okun, and Iloja (FIG. 2). The excavations fo- cused on the vertical testing of refuse mounds, house struc- tures, and ritual deposits. Each of the four settlements oc- cupied a distinct temporal phase in the settlement history of Ilare district. The spatial and temporal dimensions of ce- ramic stylistic change and continuity could therefore be ex- amined in relation to the emergence and decline of the set- tlements. A summary of the excavation contexts, chronol- ogy, and the number of sherds recovered from each of the settlements is shown in Table 1. The occupation of each of the four settlements lasted between 100 and 300 years, and their life histories seem to have been characterized by ex- ponential growth and spontaneous evacuation rather than progressive long-term population increase and gradual abandonment (Ogundiran 2000a: 151). The Grove settlement is associated with a pre-dynastic aboriginal population, and the abandonment of the settle- ment is identified as a consequence of a political struggle between the aboriginal community and a migrant group whose affiliation with Ile-Ife is elaborated in the local his- torical narratives. The migrant group (or possibly a local political faction that allied itself with Ile-Ife) not only suc- ceeded in displacing the political powers of the local pop- ulation but also established a new settlement at Iloyi (Ogundiran 2001). We do not yet have a direct chronolo- gy for the Grove settlement but radiocarbon dates indicate that Iloyi was established around the late 13th century and was occupied until the late 15th or early 16th century. This would mean that Grove settlement was possibly occupied in the 13th century, although the length of its occupation cannot yet be determined (Ogundiran 2000b). The Okun settlement was an offshoot of Iloyi, and its occupation</page><page sequence="4">30 Ceramic Spheres in the Yoruba-Edo Region, Nigeria/Ogundiran Table 1: Summary of the excavation units, chronology, and number of sherds in Ilare settlements.

The archaeological sequence at Iloja is even shorter, lasting only from the late 18th century to ca. 1870. Ceramics and Regional Interaction Networks The intersocietal movement of commodities and their stylistic variations constitutes an important strategy for mapping interaction systems in archaeology (Schortman and Urban 1992: 236). Despite the disagreements over the anthropological meaning of style, it has been demonstrat- ed that style may be found in all stages of an artifacts his- tory: composition, manufacture, form, and use (Chilton 1999; Lechtman 1977; Sackett 1977; Stark 1998; Wiess- ner 1984; Wobst 1977). The surface motifs of ceramics and variations of vessel forms are the only aspects of style considered here. Their regional distribution is a useful in- dex for the archaeological study of the circulation networks of people, information, ideas, and material goods. Decora- tion and morphological attributes embody the choices and compromises made in a rich context of history, traditions, and values during the process of ceramic production (Rice 1996: 140). Although the sharing of ceramic styles among different communities can be the result of a deliberate ma- nipulation of design to define and maintain their common identities, political-economic relations that had no basis in sociocultural identity can also result in the intersocietal ex- change and copying of objects and stylistic attributes. The historical context that underlies the distribution of materi- al culture is central to understanding the complex process by which the similarities and variations of ceramic styles are generated in a region. An explicit delineation of spatio-temporal boundaries of stylistic variations--the equivalents of "ceramic complex- es" and "ceramic spheres"--is critical to the archaeological understanding of regional interaction networks (Ball 1993: 254). Following Gifford (1976: 11-12), a ceramic complex refers to the sum total of ceramic stylistic attrib- utes that can be associated with a specific geographical zone, community, or settlement in a definite chronological span. These attributes often display a high degree of ho- mogeneity across different contexts and sites within the same settlement or between an aggregate of contiguous communities. On the other hand, a ceramic sphere exists when two or more complexes share not only a majority of their common and diagnostic types but also the majority of the characteristic stylistic elements that are found in pottery and in other aspects of material culture (Willey, Culbert, and Adams 1967: 306). These diagnostic ceramic attribut- es may originate from a restricted locale and then spread to</page><page sequence="5">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 28, 2001 31 other areas in a region through migrations, imitation, so- cioeconomic exchange, and political relationship. The boundaries of ceramic spheres are therefore relational and are products of the changing configurations in regional in- teracting networks and events (Ball 1993: 254-257). Un- like a ceramic complex, which corresponds to a single set- tlement, community, or polity, a ceramic sphere is a larger geographic unit and may transcend different cultural tradi- tions, ethnolinguistic units, and political entities. The Yoruba-Edo Ceramic Spheres The variations and similarities of the ceramic assem- blages in different areas of the Yoruba-Edo region have been noted on the basis of broad surface decoration cate- gories (Agbaje-Williams 1983; Eyo 1974; Usman 2000; Willett 1961a). The lack of a uniform parameter for defin- ing ceramic attributes, the limitation of a ceramic typolog- ical scheme to often implicitly defined decoration cate- gories, and inadequate quantifiable data have, however, made the use of ceramic attributes for understanding cul- tural historical relationships in the region rather difficult (AUsworth-Jones 1996: 313). To address this problem, I compared the ceramic assemblages in Ile-Ife, Benin, Owo, and Old Oyo areas within a 128 km radius (Ogundiran 2000a: 320). The goal was to define stylistic attributes that would help to delineate the regional and chronological variability of ceramics that are relevant to understanding the regional cultural-historical relationships and socioeco- nomic networks. The focus was not only on decoration motifs but also on vessel forms. The decoration motifs are identified as the surface patterns made by a particular type of tool or method, whereas the vessel forms are defined on the basis of body shape, and rim, lip, and shoulder profiles. The regional comparison, drawing from the previous studies by Agbaje-Williams (1983), Connah (1975), Eyo (1974), Garlake (1977), and Willett (1961a), identified three basic ceramic classes: jars, bowls, and lids. These comprise 26 morphologically distinct forms (based on rim morphology and shoulder/body angularity) and are associ- ated with a variety of surface treatment and decoration cat- egories (FIGs. 3-4, TABLE 2). The result is the identification of two major ceramic spheres-the Ife and Oyo spheres (Agbaje-Williams 1983: 288-294; Eyo 1974: 410; Ogundiran 2000a: 372-377; Willett 1961a: 77). Both ce- ramic spheres are contemporaneous and developed respec- tively at Ile-Ife and Old Oyo during the 10th-llth cen- turies. The former encompassed the Ile-Ife, Owo, and Benin axis in the south and the later originally embraced Old Oyo, Igboho, Ipapo, Koso, and Ilorin areas in the north (see FIG. I). The diagnostic motifs that characterize the Ife ceramic sphere are embossed geometric and anthropomorphic mo- tifs, reliefs of cordon and rosette motifs, hyphenated cross- hatched motifs, circular stylus impressions, and stamped geometric motifs. Other indices are rustication/incrusta- tion and the application of red and white paint/slip, usual- ly on the rims of vessels (FIG. 3; Eyo 1974; Connah 1975; Garlake 1974, 1977; Omokhodion 1988). The ceramic forms that define the Ife sphere are Jla (flared rims and ribbed necks), J6 (spheroidal vessels), B2 (ledged bowls), B3 (angular shoulder bowls), B4a (cordoned bowls), B5 (painted and grooved rim bowls), and B1l (FIG. 4). With the exception of B5 and Bll, which are consistently gray to dark gray in paste colors, all the other vessel forms gen- erally vary from brown to yellowish red. The decoration motifs that are diagnostic of the Ife ce- ramic sphere are also characteristic of markings on the ter- racotta sculptures during the Classical period (Willett 1967: 59). For example, the rectangular cordons on the shoulders of B2, B4, and Bll bowls (see motif 12a in FIG. 3) are represented as beads on the crowns, ankles, and wrists of the terracotta figures in Ife and Owo sites be- tween the 12th and 16th centuries (Willett 1967: 87). Cowry motifs were also used at Ile-Ife on ritual clay vessels, terracotta stools, and terracotta sculptures. A vivid example is a piece of pottery with the relief of a ram's head (symbol of power, leadership, and royalty) and a representation of woven fabric (carved basket-work roulette) with a fringe of cowry shell motifs (FIG. 5). Likewise, hyphenated cross- hatched incised motifs were used at Ile-Ife, Owo, and Benin as surface patterns for terracotta sculptures including human and animal figures and stools (see Willett 1967: 83, 86, 144; Eyo 1976: 43-45). The representation of these motifs on more than one category of material culture indi- cates that they were symbolically potent style elements (Hegmon 1998: 277), and it is certain that both potters and sculptors drew from the same symbolic and stylistic vocabulary in the Ife ceramic sphere. The second ceramic sphere originated at Old Oyo, 200 km north of Ile-Ife. There was a profound continuity in the ceramic traditions throughout the occupation of Old Oyo between the 10th and early 19th centuries, despite the so- ciopolitical transformations of the settlement from a village unit to an urban center and then to an imperial capital in the 15th-17th centuries (Agbaje-Williams 1983: 344). The diagnostic attributes that characterize Old Oyo pot- tery are burnishing, basting, brush marking, shell-edge, scallop impressions, dot punctates, and incised geometric symbols consisting of cross, triangular, square, and per- pendicular motifs (Agbaje-Williams 1983, 1989a, 1989b; Omokhodion 1978; Usman 2000; Willett 1961a).

The bowls in the Old Oyo assemblages generally have burnished-basted sur- faces and are smoother and harder than the bowls of the Ife ceramic sphere. The paste colors of ceramics at Old Oyo vary from fawny gray to brown for jars, and dark gray to black for bowls (Agbaje-Williams 1983: 411-419). Ceramic Forms and Decorations in Ilare District Five forms ofjars (J1-J5), twelve bowl forms (B1-B12), and six forms of lids (L1-L6) are identified in the ceramic assemblages of Ilare district (FIG. 6). Associated with these vessel forms are 15 decoration motifs. In addition to iden- tifying the morphological and decoration attributes of the ceramics, the paste colors of the sherds were recorded us- ing Munsell Color Charts. Paste colors are affected by fir- ing procedures and the environmental and geological con- ditions of the local sources of clay, but they are good indi- cators of variations in vessel forms that share similar mor- phological and decorative attributes (Shepard 1956: 103). The ceramics from the Grove settlement show the least variability in terms of decorations, vessel forms, and paste colors. All the sherds are yellowish red, 87% are plain, and the decoration motifs on the remaining 13% are limited to cord roulettes, grooves, incisions, and dot punctates. Jla and B4b are the only vessel forms identified in the ceram- ic assemblage. Due to this obviously low variability, the ce- ramic assemblage from Grove settlement is excluded from the quantitative comparisons of the ceramic attributes in Ilare district. The frequencies of the decoration attributes, vessel forms, lid types, and paste colors of rimsherds are shown for Iloyi, Okun, and Iloja in Tables 3-6.</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 28, 2001 33 Bt1 Brs2 Basted Burnished 5 5 Maize-cob roulette Painted and slip (red and white) 4.

Decoration forms of ceramics from Yoruba-Edo region. Statistical Comparison of the Distribution of Ceramic Attributes Pearson's chi-square and Cramer's V2 statistical tests were used to assess whether the differences in the distribu- tion of decoration attributes (TABLE 5) and ceramic forms (TABLE 3) among the Iloyi, Okun, and Iloja settlements have statistical significance. The tests are based on two hy- potheses: the null hypothesis or hypothesis of no relation- ship (Ho) and hypothesis of relationship (H1). The proba- bility level (a) for accepting or rejecting one of these two hypotheses is set at 0.05. This means that the null hypoth- esis will be rejected (and therefore the hypothesis of rela- I</page><page sequence="8">34 Ceramic Spheres in the Yoruba-Edo Region, Nigeria/Ogundiran B1B !,2 (2 J3 7 , B3 B4 B6 B B X J k11 L B1 Bl B B B L1 L2 I L4 L3 ' L5 L6 0 20cm I I I I Figure 4.

The tests show that the asymptotic significance of the chi- square statistics for the distribution of decoration motifs and vessel forms in Iloyi, Okun, and Iloja sites is less than the a level of 0.05 (TABLE 7). Hence the hypothesis of dif- ference is accepted. In other words, there is a statistically significant difference in the distribution of decoration mo- tifs and vessel forms among the three Ilare settlements. But the much more important statistic is the Cramer's V2 be- cause it measures the strength of the statistical differences in the distribution of ceramic stylistic attributes among the three settlements. The Cramer's V2 values for the strength of difference in the distribution of ceramic decorations and vessel forms between Iloyi and Iloja are 64% and 89% re- spectively, whereas the values between the Okun and Iloja assemblages are 58% and 88%. These show that there is a statistically strong difference between Iloyi and Iloja, as well as between Okun and Iloja. In contrast, the V2 values for the difference in the distribution of decorative motifs and vessel forms between Iloyi and Okun assemblages are weak, being only 20% and 36% respectively (TABLE 7). The Cramer's V2 values therefore indicate similarities in the choice of decoration and ceramic forms in Iloyi and Okun on one hand, and a significant difference between Iloyi and Iloja, and Iloja and Okun on the other. Ceramic Spheres and Shifting Regional Net- works in Ilare District Comparing the ceramic attributes in Tables 3-5 with Figures 3 and 4, it is certain that the diagnostic decoration motifs and ceramic forms of the Ife ceramic sphere charac- terize the ceramic assemblages in Iloyi and Okun, whereas the attributes of the Oyo ceramic sphere are predominant in Iloja. However, although Okun belongs to the Ife ce- 0</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 28, 2001 35 Figure 5. Pottery with ram's head, basketwork, and cowry motifs (8 inches tall). ramic sphere, the settlement also has traces of the Oyo ce- ramic sphere because of the presence of B7, B9, and B10 vessel forms in its ceramic assemblages. The Historical Context of the Ife Ceramic Sphere in Ilare District The dynamics of events that are articulated in the re- gional oral historical narratives indicate that the homoge- nization of ceramic styles in the Ife ceramic sphere took place in the context of migrations and regional sociopolit- ical networks (Akinjogbin and Ayandele 1980; Egharevba 1968; Smith 1988). The replication of Ife ceramics in Iloyi settlement was simultaneous with the advent of centralized political institutions in Ilare district, and the latter is asso- ciated in the local historical narratives with migrations and sociopolitical links with Ile-Ife (Ogundiran 2001). Local historical narratives render these relationships in terms of emigration of people, including political entrepreneurs, from the metropolis of Ile-Ife into Ilare district during the Classical period. The narratives suggest that these fron- tiersmen and women succeeded in displacing the aborigi- nal political authority and population at the Grove settle- ment and established an Ife-style sociopolitical entity at Iloyi. Comparative regional histories indeed indicate that the local pressures created by the population increase and political disenfranchisement that accompanied the central- ized sociopolitical development in Ile-Ife between the 9th and 11th centuries were relieved by migrations to different parts of the Yoruba region during the 12th-13th centuries (Akinjogbin 1992: 110-115).

The profound impacts of the influence of Ile-Ife on the political formation and cultural historical trajectories in Ilare district generates very elaborate historical narratives and royal festivals that survive until the present day (Hugh- es 1995: 5; Ogundiran 2000a: 114-115). These impacts are not only attested in the relocation of settlement from Grove to Iloyi and in the restructuring of political organi- zation but also in changes of material culture. The most ob- vious material correlate to the settlement and political change is the ensemble of ceramic decorations and vessel forms in Iloyi, all bearing the hallmarks of Ife origins. Thus, ceramics constitute a class of material evidence for the frontier status of Ilare district in relation to Ile-Ife. The ceramic assemblage and the associated chronology in Iloyi suggest that Ilare district was a spatial threshold for the ab- sorption of the population, cultural, and institutional ex- pansion of Ile-Ife during the 13th century.

The types and range of these connections can on- ly be subject to speculation at this point but it is certain that both Ile-Ife and Iloyi drew their stylistic expressions from the same cognitive and symbolic reservoir. The adoption of Ife ceramic elements in Ilare district during the 13th century was not, however, an isolated de- velopment. Ife ceramic characteristics also emerged in Owo and Benin during the same century, simultaneously with the advent of centralized political structures and ide- ologies. The expansion of the Ife ceramic sphere from its homeland around the 11th century to Ilare, Owo, and Benin in the 13th century seems to parallel the political and cultural influence of Ile-Ife in the Yoruba-Edo region. On one hand, the Ife ceramic sphere can be viewed as the re- gional acculturation to the materials of the metropolitan polity with the longest history, and the most elaborate ma- terial forms, of sociopolitical complexity. On the other hand, the ceramic sphere served as the marker of a region- al system in which subgroups (social groups and commu- nities) had access to the material correlates of a coherent system of "ideological structures that established and orga- nized their place in the social world" (MacEachern 1994: 207). The evidence at Iloyi shows that Ilare district served as an outlet for the distribution of populations, ideas, and goods that defined the spatial threshold of the Ife ceramic sphere between the 13th and 16th centuries. Transitions and Multiple Fields of Regional Interactions The abandonment of Iloyi was a consequence of the in- tense factional conflicts that raged across Ilare district dur- ing the early 16th century (Early Intermediate), leading to the establishment of the Okun settlement by a segment of the population from Iloyi during the second half of the 16th century. This was also a period that witnessed the eco- nomic expansion of the Upper Osun area, north of Ile-Ife as an entrepot of trading networks and a major production center for iron, dye, and cloth (Belasco 1980: 157; FIG. 7). Okun was located adjacent to this entrepot, and the settle- ment itself was bisected by an artery that linked Ilare dis- trict to the major centers of economic activities in the northern and southern parts of Yoruba country (FIG. 8). The emergence of Okun coincided with the period of po- litical expansion of Benin and Old Oyo, and the weakening of the regional political-economic influence of Ile-Ife (Ogundiran 2000a: 230-231). The expansion of the Old Oyo hegemony during the 17th and 18th centuries in an attempt to control the trading networks that connected the interiors of Yorubaland to the Atlantic coast brought the easternmost boundary of the Empire about 30 km closer to Okun. As the regional trade networks came under the control of Old Oyo and Benin in the 17th century, the re- gional importance of Ile-Ife dwindled. The ties of Ile-Ife to its frontier and client settlements/polities became weak,</page><page sequence="12">38 Ceramic Spheres in the Yoruba-Edo Region, Nigeria/Ogundiran Table 6.

Expectedly, the diagnostic Oyo ceramic attributes were predominant in some of the areas that were brought under the direct political control of Old Oyo between the 16th and 18th centuries (Usman 2000: 57-58; Willett 1961a: 77). Two of these areas, Ipo and Esie, are contiguous to Ilare district. It has been suggested that the prevalence of Oyo ceramic elements in these areas was due to a combi- nation of several factors, including increased immigration of Oyo population into the periphery communities, and inter-marriage and trading connections between the me- tropolis and its political periphery (Usman 2000: 59; Wil- lett 1961a: 77). Although a few stylistic elements of the Oyo ceramic sphere were found in the ceramic assemblage of Okun, the forms and design attributes of the Ife ceram- ic sphere were dominant in the settlement. The Ilare dis- trict may not have been incorporated into the Old Oyo Empire although the district had a close proximity to the easternmost boundary of Oyo hegemony. It is, however, of interest that the Oyo ceramic forms at Okun were decorat- ed with the characteristic Ife decoration motifs. For exam- ple, B7 and B9 bowls were decorated with circular stylus stamps (a decoration motif absent in the Oyo ceramic sphere) and their surfaces were, unlike the situation at Old Oyo, without basting. It is therefore likely that the two di- agnostic Oyo vessel forms were not produced in the heart- land of the Oyo metropolis but were imitations made in the peripheries and the boundary areas. The presence of Oyo ceramic elements in Okun is a ma- terial manifestation of the new routes of contact that con- nected Ilare district to Old Oyo area during the 16th-18th centuries. The intersection of Ife and Oyo ceramic ele- ments at Okun confirms the local historical narratives that the settlement was one of the nodes of trade networks con- necting the northern and southern areas of Yoruba-Edo re- gion. Local history, in particular, describes Okun as a pro- visioning settlement for itinerant traders and porters carry- ing goods between the southern rainforest and the north- ern savanna belts (FIG. 7; Ogundiran 2000a: 231). The new ideas associated with the traffic of people and goods along the trading arteries no doubt broadened the reper- toire of ceramic decorations and vessel forms in Ilare dis- trict from the late 16th to 18th centuries. Despite the stylistic similarities that situate Okun with- in the Ife ceramic sphere, there were marked differences in paste colors between the ceramics at Iloyi, Ile-Ife, and Benin on one hand and those at Okun on the other. In con- trast to Iloyi and Ile-Ife in particular, the ceramic assem- blage at Okun reveals a drastic reduction in ceramics with yellowish-red pastes, an increase in gray and dark gray, and</page><page sequence="13">Journal ofField Archaeology/Vol. 28, 2001 39 Table 7.

The differences in paste colors of ceramics be- tween Iloyi and Okun are most noticeable in Jla, B3, B4, B8, and B12 forms. These variations are no doubt indica- tions of changes in the ceramic production processes and sources of clay. Yet it seems that despite the settlement re- location, population shuffling, and the weakened institu- tional link of Ile-Ife to Ilare district during the 16th-18th centuries, the production centers that supplied ceramics to Okun continued to draw from the stylistic traditions that originated from Ile-Ife during the 13th century. The Incorporation of Ilare District into the Oyo Ceramic Sphere The reasons for the abandonment of the Okun settle- ment in the late 18th century remain unclear, but one of the settlements that was established in Ilare district before the end of the 18th century was Iloja. This settlement de- veloped as a rural market center where weekly fairs were held for the exchange of agricultural and manufactured goods. The occupation of Iloja between ca. 1780 and 1870 overlapped with the decline of Old Oyo's imperial hege- mony. The decline was followed by the collapse of the Em- pire and the evacuation of its capital and its satellite settle- ments between 1810 and 1836 (Law 1977: 271-259). All ceramics in Iloja have the same decorations and vessel forms as those that characterized the heartland of the Oyo ceramic sphere during the 15th-19th century, especially Old Oyo, Igboho, Ipapo, and Koso (Agbaje-Williams 1983, 1989a, 1989b). The ceramic assemblage at Iloja therefore demonstrates the complete shift of Ilare district from Ife to Oyo ceramic sphere during the late 18th through the 19th century. By the second quarter of the 19th century, the core ar- eas of the Ife ceramic sphere, especially Ile-Ife and Benin, were also infiltrated by Oyo pottery. At Ile-Ife, Oyo ce- ramic elements included jars with fluted rims, some with heavily rolled and everted rims, and lids with strap handles. Other Oyo elements at Ile-Ife include B9, L4, and L6 forms with burnished and basted surface, gray and black fabric, and thin walls decorated with incised patterns, often in geometric shapes filled with a very fine and regular in- cised hatching (Garlake 1977: 85). To the north of Ile-Ife, the fine gray/black wares of Old Oyo, especially the black basted and burnished bowls, have been excavated in the palace premises of Ilesa in a context dated to the third quar- ter of the 19th century (Willett 1961b, 1973). At Benin, Oyo ceramics were also found in the 19th- and early 20th- century deposits. Connah (1975: 133) refers to these im- ported ceramics as "Ilorin black burnished ware" and they are characterized mainly by lidded bowls with flared rims (especially B7 and B9 bowls) and decorated with pattern burnishing. The expansion of the Oyo ceramic sphere in the last decades of the 18th century and throughout the 19th cen- tury into the peripheries and cores of the Ife ceramic sphere took place as a consequence of the collapse of the Old Oyo Empire. The southward population dispersal from the Oyo metropolis and many of its satellite towns followed the sack of the capital in the second or third decade of the 19th century. Some of these Oyo migrants would have been pot- ters who set up production centers in their new homes at Ibadan, Ijaye, and even in the outskirts of Ile-Ife (Ajekigbe 1998: 134; Allsworth-Jones 1996: 317; Fatunsin 1992: 10-11; Willett 1973). Ethnoarchaeological and historical research indicates, however, that by the mid-19th century, large-scale production and distribution of Oyo pottery was best achieved at Ilorin (Anifowose 1984; O'Hear 1987; Willett 1961a). Hence, the Oyo pottery that was traded to Benin, Ilesa, Ile-Ife and other parts of the Yoruba-Edo re- gion attracted the label of "Ilorin wares" before the end of the 19th century, a confirmation of the prominence of Ilorin in the production and redistribution of Oyo pottery during the century. The proliferation of Oyo ceramic ele- ments, especially their far-flung distribution from Ilorin in- to the heartland of the Ife ceramic sphere, reflects the ex- pansion and increased integration of regional trade net- works, demographic change and, perhaps, changes in the organization of production. But whereas Oyo ceramics did not replace the ceramic complexes of the Ife sphere in Ile- Ife and Benin, the ceramic complex in Ilare district was pre- dominantly of Oyo characteristics during the 19th century. The link of Ilare district to the Oyo ceramic production centers would have been accentuated by the position of Iloja settlement as one of the rural centers for the redistri- bution and exchange of manufactured products, foods, and processed agricultural products, especially palm oil (Ogundiran 2000a: 286). The increasingly intensified spe- cialization of craft production that is alluded to in the writ-</page><page sequence="14">40 Ceramic Spheres in the Yoruba-Edo Region, Nigeria/Ogundiran OYO EMPIRE Major trading _ center I / I / I/ * Old Oyo BENIN KINGDOM Benin Benin 0 50 km I I Figure 7. Iare district and directions of influence of Oyo and Benin (17th-18th century). ten and oral historical traditions of the period may explain the dependency of Ilare district on ceramic imports rather than on local production (O'Hear 1987; Peel 1983: 21-22). Summary and Conclusion This study demonstrates that changes in the ceramic styles of Ilare district were products of the shifting interso- cietal networks that bounded the regional periphery to its metropolitan neighbors. The ability to make inferences on the conditions and processes of regional connections and interactions from the distribution of ceramic forms and decorations is, however, enriched by the understanding of the historical contexts of sociopolitical development and collapse, migrations, and socioeconomic relations. The intra-settlement uniformity of paste colors, decora- tion motifs, and vessel forms indicates that each communi- ty procured its ceramics from the same sources, and that at different periods between the 13th and 19th centuries, Ilare district belonged to two ceramic spheres. The exten- sion of these spheres to Ilare district is indicative of the dis- trict's participation in regional interactions and exchanges. The evidence at Iloyi settlement shows that Ilare district was aligned with the Ife-Benin-Owo axis and was a nexus for the distribution of Ife pottery and peoples between the 13th and 16th centuries. The adoption of the Ife-style ce- ramics in Ilare district was associated with population ex- pansion from Ile-Ife and the proliferation of centralized political institutions in the 12th-13th centuries. The eco- nomic and technological development and cultural elabo- ration that went hand in hand with sociopolitical com- plexity in Ile-Ife stimulated the imitation of its styles and iconographic symbols in the central and eastern parts of the Yoruba-Edo region. Thus, the similar decorative motifs of ceramics in the Ife-Benin corridor during the 13th-16th centuries seem to constitute active iconic signs for institut- ing and maintaining regional identities and sociopolitical relations. The unidirectional network between Ilare district and Ile-Ife was replaced during the 16th century by a plurality of interaction networks. Although ceramic forms and dec- orations cannot fully capture the complex gamut of these networks, the intersection of the local imitations of the Oyo ceramic attributes and the continuity of the repertoire of Ife ceramics indicate the adjustment of Ilare district to the transformations in regional networks. There is, on the one hand, evidence that Ife traditions provided order, sta- bility, and predictability in ceramic styles despite the so- \ \ I I I \ \ I X A \ / Ife 1 Directions of influence 4/ / I , , -1 'Northern I "I\ I * / .II.</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 28, 2001 41 Figure 8.

On the other hand, the incorporation of the Oyo ceramic ele- ments into the ceramic assemblages at Okun settlement at- tests to the linkage of Ilare district to the Oyo territory. Al- though Ilare district was one of the first loci in the Ife ce- ramic sphere to adopt the Oyo ceramic elements, no such contemporaneous intrusion of Oyo ceramic elements was evident at Ile-Ife and Benin in the 16th-18th centuries. Thus, we are able to identify archaeologically that the shift in regional networks of interaction occurred earlier at Ilare district than at Ile-Ife and Benin, the two political metrop- olises in the Ife ceramic sphere. The period that spanned the late 18th-19th centuries, however, witnessed the full incorporation of Ilare into the Oyo ceramic sphere and the adoption of Oyo pottery in the political centers of the Ife ceramic sphere. The expansion of the Oyo ceramic distribution resulted from both regional population shifts and the expanding economic networks in Yorubaland during the 19th century. These two parallel de- velopments are indicated respectively by the dispersal of Oyo populations into different parts of Yorubaland fol- lowing the collapse of Old Oyo and by the emergence of Ilorin as successor to the ceramic industries of the defunct Empire (O'Hear 1987; Drewal and Mason 1998: 48). The ceramic industries at Ilorin achieved a wider distribution of Oyo pottery in Yoruba-Edo region than was attained by the Oyo metropolis itself. The strong link in the ceramic characteristics between Iloyi and Ile-Ife possibly indicates a conscious reinforce- ment of sociocultural relationships between the frontier and its metropolis, with the ceramics serving as templates for affirming common identities and close social relations. On the other hand, the iconic-stylistic elements of the Ife ceramic sphere at Okun were possibly a residual continua- tion of structures that began to lose their meanings in Ilare district as the social distance between the district and Ile- Ife widened. The evidence at Iloja indicates that ceramics ceased to be a class of objects for expressing coherent sys- tems of symbols and ideologies in the district during the late 18th and 19th centuries. Rather, the choice of ceram- ic styles seems to have responded more to utilitarian pur- poses and market conditions than to any symbolic com- municative function and delineation of social boundaries. The foregoing study indicates the usefulness of ceramic stylistic attributes in demonstrating long-term stability and mutually exclusive tendencies at regional metropolises. It is at such centers that ceramic decorations and vessel forms should be expected to convey the sense of a stable universe despite the changes in the characteristics of regional inter- actions. In contrast, due to the frequent cycles of change and poorly developed institutions, the ceramics at the pe- riphery or non-centers are less likely to be culturally bound. The case study in Ilare district demonstrates that the ce- ramic styles of the regional periphery were determined by relationships with the major political centers and the events that originated from them. In other words, the ceramic as-</page><page sequence="16">42 Ceramic Spheres in the Yoruba-Edo Region, Nigeria/Ogundiran semblages in Ilare district do not have the central patterns and mutually exclusive tendencies that often characterize the core areas; rather, they mirror those of the dominant political centers in the Yoruba-Edo region.
