THE TERRITORY OF AMAPÁ: LAND IN DISPUTE By Clifford Evans, Jr.* Clifford Evans , Jr., is a native of Dallas , Texas, and a graduate of the University of Southern California, and of Columbia University where he took his Ph.D. in anthropology in 1950. In 1946 he was a member of William Duncan Strong's Viru Valley Expedition in northern Peru; in 1948-49 he and his wife, Betty J. Meggers, organized and conducted the Lower Amazon Expedition, under the auspices of Columbia's Department of Anthropology, the Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro, the Museu Goeldi, Belem, and the Museu T erritorial, Macapá, with the assistance of a joint grant from the then Viking ( now Wenner-Gren) Fund and Columbia University. Dr. Evans is now Associate Curator in the Division of Archaeology, U. S. National Museum, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C.

SHORTLY the bral, Portuguese in AFTER April, THE explorer, 1500 DISCOVERY A.D., Pedro the mainland OF Alvarez BRAZIL north Ca- BY SHORTLY the Portuguese explorer, Pedro Alvarez Ca- bral, in April, 1500 A.D., the mainland north of the Amazon (previously known as Brazilian Guiana and today called the Territory of Amapá) was the scene of some of the bitterest battles fought in the New World. The cause was not Indian resistance primarily, but competi- tion between the Dutch, English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese, each seeking to establish a foot- hold in this gateway to the Ama- zon, with its extensive placer de- posits of gold and silver, and bountiful supply of tropical woods and unusual plants. Few know of the role of the Territory of Amapá in the his- tory of the New World, for the literature is not large and often involves obscure works, and be- cause the conquest of the more spectacular cultures of Mexico, Central America, and Peru has al- ways lent itself more readily to popular, romantic accounts. Unfortunately, the bits of eth- nological and historical data are all too scanty to permit a recon- struction of the aboriginal cultures of the Territory of Amapá; even less is known about the archaeology. A few scattered specimens collected by early travelers and explorers, plus some limited excavations by South American museums in the late i8oo's, were the only archaeological investigations prior to our field work in 1949. Although by no means exhaustive of all the possibilities of scientific archaeological research in this most fruitful region, a fleeting glimpse of the results of the Lower Amazon Expedition's work will give a better picture of the Indian cultures of the Territory of Amapá before, and immedi- ately after, European contact. Geographically, the Territory presents an interesting combina- tion of uplands, flooded lowlands, lakes, marshes, and mountain ranges, interlaced by a vast net- work of rivers and streams, bor- dered on the south by the mighty Amazon and on the east by the Atlantic. All these geographical features had a direct and deep in- fluence on the lives of the aborig- ines and their European conquer- ors. Certain features peculiar to the Territory of Amapá and gen- erally untypical of the lower Amazon basin, such as steep and high banks along rivers, natural caves in granitic outcrops, a large amount of easily accessible stone, and the vast Rio Araguari-Ama- pari dividing the Territory into a northern and southern sector (see map), make some of the elements of the aboriginal cultures quite differ- ent from those typical among tropical forest tribes of lowland South America, including those found in the islands at the mouth of the Amazon. * This article is published with the permission of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. Autumn 1951 175</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1. Aurora, Rio Flexal. Ceremonial stone alignment of the Aruã Culture Phase. Archaeology reveals the Territory of Amapá as a disputed area during aboriginal times, just as during European occupation. Groups moved in from the north, around the coast, from the Ama- zon and via the inland waterways, and subdued, infiltrated, or pushed out their predecessors. The earliest horizons of hu- man occupancy of this area are not definable either because the Terri- tory of Amapá was unin- habited, or because the early aboriginal inhabit- ants had not progressed beyond the hunting, fish- ing, and gathering stage of culture, living such a nomadic life that they never stayed in one place long enough to leave deposits which can be detected today by the archaeologist under tropical forest conditions of preservation. Peculiarly, the first and earliest ceramic horizon in the Territory of Amapá is comparable to the latest and most recent one of the islands in the mouth of the Amazon. The first people we can clearly distinguish as inhabitants of the Territory of Amapá are the Aruã, who moved down from the north. They established semi- permanent villages and followed an agricultural economy (determined by the presence of manioc graters in the sherd refuse), practiced the art of pottery making, and erected ceremonial structures of roughly-hewn stones. Nothing in their culture, however, suggests a high level of development and in comparison to the Marajoara culture of Marajó Island (see Betty J. Meggers, 'A Pre-Colum- bian Colonization of the Amazon,' Archaeology 4.1 10- 114), it must be considered an extremely crude, formative culture. The Aruã sites are easily recognized by a character- istic orange, sherd-tempered pottery, which is usually plain but is sometimes decorated with simple circle impressions. One interesting feature of the Aruã in the Territory of Amapá, not found in the island manifestation of this cul- ture, is the erection of stone alignments (Figure i). These contain from 20 to 150 separate stones, arranged either in a straight line or in a circle, and are placed on elevated spots near the coast. The illustrated stone align- ment, Aurora, today has only two stones standing because caboclos (modern inhabitants) tore down the others while looking for "buried treasure," leaving 19 scattered stones on the ground. These rocks are roughly-hewn granite ranging in size from 0.75 X 0.30 X 0.13 to 3.0 X 0.30x0.30 me- ters. The near- est source of supply is an outcrop five kil- ometers down- stream. With the ex- ception of a few scattered potsherds, nothing has been found at this alignment or at any of the others. They were not a place of burial or habitation. The fact that the stones are always placed on the highest spot in the area, even if it required transporting them for great distances, suggests, in spite of the absence of a large amount of offertory material, that their loca- tion and deliberate arrangement must be closely con- nected with certain ceremonial practices of the Aruã.

Main street, Rua Senador Lemos, City of Amapá. Excavating a burial urn from an old cemetery and village site of the Aristé Phase, with the town's people watching the activity. Why did the Aruã occupy the Territory of Amapá for so short a time and then leave? The answer lies in our recurring thesis - struggle for control of the area. Pressured-out by the incoming peoples of the Mazagão and Aristé Phases, they moved from the Territory of Amapá onto the Islands of Mexiana, Cavianna, and the north coast of Marajó in the mouth of the Amazon River. Here these peoples were well established at the time of European discovery. Chroniclers and missionaries often relate ventures with the "fierce Aruans" of the islands; however, their name is never as- sociated with the Terri- tory of Amapá in the earliest reports. In basin the high Amazon land was basin high land was always the favorite lo- cation for the village sites, regardless of the tribe; therefore, it is not unusual to find the next cultural group, the Aristé Phase, choosing the high, dry banks of rivers and streams for their villages. Often these places of habita- tion are found only when a section of forest is cleared by slash-and- burn technique for a new garden patch (Fig- ure 2). Even the modern settlements, founded in early Portuguese Colonial days, are often located on top of old Indian villages. The modern town of Amapá, not far from the airfield of the same name which was so familiar to our airmen in World War II, is located directly upon a large village and cemetery site of the Indians of the Aristé Culture Phase. Proof of this superposi- tion was demonstrated vividly when we excavated a burial urn from the city's main street, Rua Senador Lemos, with an interested crowd of local inhabitants watching our work and then bringing us bits of stone artifacts and sherds collected from their yards in var- ious parts of the town (Figure 3). The Indians of this Aristé Phase dis- posed of their dead by cremation and placed the ashes in ceramic jars, which they deposited in natural caves (Figures 5 and 6) or along the base of rock shel- ters (Figure 4), or buried in small arti- ficial, subterranean chambers. Although Dr. Emilio Goeldi excavated a series of these chamber-burials in 1895 on the Rio Cunani, our work in the season of 1949 along the Igarapé do Serra and Rio Flexal revealed the use of natural caves as the most common burial practice in this local area. Apparently the people, living in villages like the one illustrated in Figure 2, carried the ash-filled urns 10 to 15 kilometers to these cemeteries, concealed Fig. 4.

Cave 2, Montanha de Aristé on Igarapé da Serra. Burial urns of the Aristé Phase, broken and wedged between rocks fallen from the ceiling since the cave was used for burial. sels came from outside the mouth of the cave and 6 1 vessels from within. By a careful stylistic and techno- logical comparison of the potsherds from in- side the cave with those outside, along with a seriation of the ceramic types from all the burial and habita- tion sites in the area, it was possible to rec- ognize some distinct time changes in the pottery. Interestingly, a few small white and blue European-glass trade beads were associated with the burial urns in the mouth of the cave at Montanha da Pluma, proving contact with Europeans in the latter part of the Aristé Phase. At the time when the Indians of the Aristé Phase were developing their culture in the region north of the Rio Araguarí-Amaparí, another distinct cultural group, the Mazagão Phase, existed south of the river with one of their main centers of development along the Rios Piçacá, Vilanova and Mazagão. Although they were also a semi-seden- tary, manioc-agricultural people living in small vil- lages on high banks along rivers, their ceramic styles and burial patterns were distinct from the Aristé Phase. The typical ceramics of both the cemeteries and the village refuse included a sandy-textured, red ware, tempered with crushed quartz, which was some- times decorated with an elaborate, incised geometric design (Figure nb). Instead of cremation the Mazagão Phase Indians practiced secondary burial. The disarticulated skeletons were arranged in large, round or cylindrical jars covered with a lid and interred directly in the ground (Fig- ure io). Sometimes a small bowl (Figure lib), perhaps holding a food offering, was placed inside the jar. One of the most characteristic features of the Mazagão burial urns is the abbreviated and stylized modelling of a human body on the jar and a human face on the lid (Figure na). The head (or lid) fits directly upon the jar and was laced to it through four small holes near the lip of the lid and rim of the jar body. Burial urns of a unique tu- bular style, representing a man with ligatures on his calves and seated on a small bench (Figure 12), have been known from the Rio Maracá, farther south, since the explorations of naturalists in the 1870's. Along the Rio Piçacá urns of this same style, but of local manufacture, were found in the same cemeteries as the aforementioned more typical cylindrical and globular burial urns. It appears that the people of the Mazagão Phase saw and then copied from memory these peculiar burial urns of the Rio Maracá (Figure 13). Both along the Rio Maracá and with some of the burial groups in the Rios Piçacá and Vilanova a few glass trade beads have been found, proving the contemporary exist- ence of, at least, the latter part of this cultural phase after contact with the Eu- ropeans beginning in 1500 A.D. Three distinct groups had inhabited the Territory of Amapá before the five nations of Euro- peans began to strug- gle over this vast, un- Fig. 6. Cave at Montanha da Pluma, Igarapé da Serra.

Although all practiced manioc agriculture, lived in semi-permanent villages, and de- veloped unique ceramic art and style, each had a culture distinct from the other - the Aruã with their stone alignments and simple, circle- impressed ceramics; the Aristé group with cre- mation burial, a painted style of pottery, and burial in or near natural or artificial caves; the Mazagão Phase with secondary burial or dis- articulated skeletons in 1 urns interred directly in the ground, and a strik- ing, incised style of pot- tery decoration; the Maracá culture with its anthropomorphic urns and painted designs. Truly, the Territory of Amapá has been, both aboriginally and in early historical times, a crossroads of cultures. From where did these various Indian groups, each with distinctive cultural traits, come? Although the problems of Lower Amazon archaeology are far from solu- tion, our excavations have given us a few answers. The affiliations of the Aruã are with the Caribbean Islands, possibly the Lower Orinoco River, and the other Guianas, but they are the only group of the four to have come from the north via the Atlantic Coast. Lack of field work in the interior of the Amazon basin leaves the exact origin of the Artisté and Mazagão Phases some- what in doubt. However, such Aristé traits as curvilinear painted designs on the pottery, and urn burials in caverns or excavated subterranean chambers, suggests interesting comparisons with certain finds in Colombia. With reference to the Mazagão cul- ture, the incised tradition in the ceramics is quite similar in detail, as well as pottery type, to the Arauquin of the Middle Orinoco of Venezuela. Such cultural affiliations suggest that the movement of peoples in and out of the Territory of Amapá were not principally by coastal movements, but rather via the vast network of the inland water routes that all connect to their main artery, the Amazon River. They also demonstrate that the advances, withdrawals, trading, settle- ments and conflicts of early European Colonial times were not an innova- tion, but were instead what had been typical of the Indian occupa- tion of this region. The difference was in the goal - the Indians sought land for hunt- ing and agriculture, the Europeans for its min- eral wealth and natural resources. Fig. 8.
