<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paola Sica Regenerating Life and Art: Futurism, Florentine Women, Irma Valeria 66 A more del pericolo," "giovani leoni," "automobili famelici," "eterna xVvelocità onnipresente": these are some renowned expressions drawn from Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's "Fondazione e manifesto del Futurismo" of 1909 (7-10). I am mentioning these expressions because, through them, one can intuitively grasp the trait that has always struck me about this avant-garde movement: its euphoric, victorious and provocative sense of regeneration. What is commonly conceived as an end or as destruction does not seem to be so to Futurists. What I would like to explore here is this paradox, often connected to a desire to transcend human limits, through a gradually more restricted focus. At first I will examine it within the cultural context of Futurism; then, more specifically, in its Florentine branch, especially that of L 'Italia futurista and its women; and finally in the work of one of its representatives, Irma Valeria. I will ask why the concept of perpetual renewal is so pervasive in the Futurist movement, how it returns in the Florentine local epistemological formation, and what its repercussions are in one of its women, particularly in her constructions of a new female identity. Proceeding with this analysis, I will assume that gender is an entity conditioned by power relations in society, and textual signs representing it reflect acceptance of, or resistance to, the dominant cultural practices in a specific place at a specific time.1 Futurists were always intrigued by the dual concept of art and life, both critically and creatively. According to them, the two elements should mutually nourish one other, thereby fostering a Utopian plan that led individuals and the nation to an inexhaustible regenerative power. But, ultimately, more than aiming at utopia, the Futurists' project was pursued in the present to justify actions and * This essay originates from the fusion and development of ideas presented in two papers: "Regenerating Life and Art and L'Italia futurista," delivered at Columbia University on April 23, 2007, and "The Dispersion of the Self into the 'Azure' in Irma Valeria's Futurist Work," delivered at the MLA conference on December 29, 2003. This essay also anticipates concepts that I will elaborate in a section of my book in progress, provisionally titled Posthuman Desires: Futurist Women in Florence. 1 In affirming this point, I am revisiting Foucault when he states that societies may be conceived as systems of power relations. According to Foucault, language is affected by these power relations and can become instrumental either in their acceptance or in their critique (83). Annali d'italianìstica 27 (2009).

Their grand dream of power, which often fueled a virile and imperialistic agenda, helped them control their fears of decline, death, and sexual and cultural diversity, in a historical moment that was characterized by a crisis of religious sentiment and by quick and astounding transformations in the scientific, political, social and economical spheres. Between the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, in Italy as in the rest of Europe, a secular tendency deepened, as capitalism came to dominate the lives of nations and of individuals. An incredible variety of scientific discoveries followed each other, and numerous technological innovations accelerated the rhythm of production.2 In 1895 alone, Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen discovered the X-ray, Guglielmo Marconi invented the wireless telegraph, and the Lumière brothers, Auguste and Luis, showed moving images on a big screen for the first time. In 1905 Albert Einstein formulated his theory of relativity, and in 1927 Werner Heisenberg defined his principle of indeterminacy. Even the cataclysmic effects of the two world wars could not interrupt these innovations, and they in fact accelerated advancement of military technology. In the beginning of the twentieth century, Sigmund Freud published his studies on the unconscious and the interpretation of dreams, and Rudolf Steiner created a new science, which he defined as anthroposophy, aimed at revealing the spiritual in human beings and in the universe. In the same period, women's presence in the political and working sphere became more visible, as did that of the working classes. Numerous groups of suffragettes fought for women's emancipation, and trade unions flourished. Because of imperialistic thrusts, power axes between European and non European countries changed, and a sense of a progressive decay pervaded those who identified themselves with the white race. It is not a coincidence that such studies as Oswald Spengler's Der Untergang des Abendlandes: Gestalt und Wirklichkeit and Friedrich Nietzsche's Vom Nutzen and Nachteil der Historié fur das Leben appeared in this period. In them, white European or Western men, oppressed and weakened by the burden of their history, were portrayed as epigones. These are only a few examples that help us imagine the vastness of changes that Futurists experienced — changes that prompted them to develop a new world view and, consequently, to create a new imagery. As witnesses to war, they belittled its destructive effects and defined it as "sola igiene del mondo" 2 In "Italy and Modernity: Peculiarities and Contradictions," Ceserani correctly observes that there is "some agreement among the new historians that European societies experienced only two major changes in the last two centuries, to which we have given the names of, respectively, modernity and postmodernity." According to Ceserani, the first great transformation that "radically altered the social and cultural life of Europe" occurred "at the turn of the eighteenth century" (35).</page><page sequence="3">Regenerating Life and Art: Futurism, Florentine Women, Irma Valeria 111 (Marinetti, "Fondazione" 10). Reacting to an increasing secularization of culture, they satisfied their desire for spirituality by embracing the new sciences as a new religion — those sciences that could bring to light the dizzying astronomic and subatomic dimensions discovered by Einstein and Heisenberg, and that could help sound out those meanders of the human mind described by Freud and Steiner. Finally, affected by the idea of the decline and transformation of social structures, they sought to strengthen the Italian race and to defend their privileged status by embracing eugenic and naturist principles and by enthusiastically welcoming technological innovations.3 Regenerating life and art to escape the sense of an end or a decay — it is worth reiterating — was essential to this avant-garde movement. It was also essential for that Florentine branch that was represented by the journal L 'Italia futurista published between June 1, 1916 and February 14, 1918, against the backdrop of World War I. This was also the journal in which, for the first time in Futurist history, a substantial number of women participated. L'Italia futurista was created by men including Emilio Settimelli, Bruno Ginanni-Corradini, Mario Carli and Remo Chiti,4 and it was enlivened by the contributions of women like Maria Ginanni, Rosa Rosà, Enif Robert, Irma Valeria, Fulvia Giuliani, Mina Della Pergola, Maij Carbonaro, Fanny Dini, Emma Marpillero, Enrica Piubellini and Magamal. This journal was the forum for the second phase of Tuscan Futurism;5 in fact it appeared after the cessation of Lacerba, another avant-garde paper that was published in Florence from January 1 and May 22, 1915, as a vehicle for intellectuals from La voce, including Giovanni Papini and Ardengo Soffici. Like the Lacerba group, the staff of L'Italia futurista was in dialogue with other Futurist coteries, and developed its program through the revival of an irrational trend, in open contrast with empiricism. It supported Italy's role in World War I, and it assumed a clear anti-democratic, anti-bourgeois and androcentric stance. Unlike the Lacerba group, however, it nourished a deeper interest in occultism, at times intertwining it with a scientific trend that exalted various forms of human empowerment.6 3 Marinetti and other Futurists explicitly embraced Naturism in 1934, through the creation of the Movimento dei Gruppi Futuristi Naturisti. (Naturism is a cultural movement that mostly developed in Northern Europe and North America in the early twentieth century. It advocated a return to nature, in order to improve the quality of life undermined by industrial society.) 4 These names appear in the editorial of L 'Italia futurista signed by Emilio Settimelli and published on June 1, 1916 (1). 5 To this purpose, Salaris declares that "L'Italia futurista [...] viene ad alimentare il cosiddetto secondo futurismo fiorentino" (Storia 88). 6 In Avant-Garde Florence, Adamson compares the group of Lacerba with that of L 'Italia futurista. When he speaks about their differences, he points out that Marinetti had an "overwhelming presence" in L 'Italia futurista. In observing their similarities, he notices that all of them had Croce and D'Annunzio as "enemies," and all of them "drew</page><page sequence="4">178 Paola Sica The specific agenda of L 'Italia futurista was stimulated by the Florentine scientific and philosophical milieu, in which spiritualistic, metapsychic and neo idealist ideas circulated widely. Referring to this milieu, in a book examining esoteric aspects in Futurism, Simona Cigliana confirms the point when she observes that Florence had a place of singular relevance among other Italian cities in which psychic, occultist and spiritualistic doctrines were widespread (50). Because of the lively debates of its intellectuals, Florence became a magnet for artists, writers, scientists and philosophers from all parts of Italy and abroad. New societies for psychic research were established; numerous mediumistic séances took place; a theosophic society thrived; and Florentines saw the establishment of the Philosophical Library and an Italian version of the Christian Science Church.7 L 'Italia futurista also reflected the interests of some of its animators who had previously contributed to journals with a psychic and esoteric line such as La difesa dell'arte (1909-1910), Il centauro (1912-1913) and La rivista d'arte e di vita (1914). Reacting against Benedetto Croce's idealism and Gabriele D'Annunzio's aestheticism, these intellectuals deepened and then went beyond the line traced by Symbolism, especially the French. They promoted a global art that would explore unmapped territories while extolling spirituality, dreams and sensations. Their goal was to represent an expanded human soul that would eventually become one with the perpetual doing and undoing of matter. The women of L 'Italia futurista became fully involved in the activities of the journal from the very beginning, engaging in dialogue with their male peers and responding to the dominant Florentine, esoteric, cultural atmosphere. Their writing, art and other activities often explicitly rooted in occultism reveal that they formed a distinct group. Even though they embraced the principles of some predecessors and followers, they transformed these principles with a personal taste while fusing them with local ideas. Like their predecessor Valentine de Saint-Point (1875-1953) in France, for example, they extolled women who could elevate themselves from the masses through an empowering virilization.8 (In her "Manifeste de la Femme Futuriste" of 1912, de Saint-Point had declared that in her era both women and men lacked virility, and for that reason the Latin race from many of the same French sources, especially Rimbaud." In addition both groups adopted the "antifeminist rhetoric of'virility'" (221). 7 In this sentence I am paraphrasing what Papini wrote in an article of 1907 titled "Franche spiegazioni." When he describes Florence in his time, he notices several changes: "[...] la formazione di varie società per le ricerche psichiche; il ripetersi sempre più frequente di clamorose sedute medianiche; la diffusione [...] della Società Teosofica; la fondazione e sviluppo della Biblioteca Filosofica [...] (1905), l'apparizione [...] di una chiesa italiana della Christian Science" (131). 8 The virile agenda of Futurist women is noted in numerous studies, including Contarmi; Guerricchio; Mitrano; Nozzoli; Parati; Re; Salaris (1982); Sartini Blum; and Spackman.</page><page sequence="5">Regenerating Life and Art: Futurism, Florentine Women, Irma Valeria 179 was benumbed [15]). However, going beyond de Saint-Point, the Florentines frequently expressed a desire to engender superior individuals who would surpass their human limitations and transcend sexual and cultural diversity by using their paranormal faculties. These individuals' effort to transcend their limits could be defined as "posthuman" — a frequent term in current cultural science discourse9 — in that, through an incorporation of occult forces, they could transform themselves into entities of unprecedented mental and physical capacity and attempt to eliminate sickness and death.10 Florentine women formed a complex discursive system by putting into practice their ideas. They moved on a common ground, but each of them created a space of her own while forming alliances and oppositions. Such writers as Maria Ginanni and Irma Valeria, for example, were defined ironically as scrittrici azzurre by other women of the same group, because of their frequent representations of feminine selves transformed into azure expanses, and, mostly, because of their recurrent languishing embellishments and abstract cerebralisms. Two passages, one from "I ponti delle cose" and another from "Variazioni" in Maria Ginanni's Montagne trasparenti (1917), offer a good example of this writing style. The first passage regards the exceptional, yet painful visionary powers of the narrating persona and enhances the effectiveness of their representation through the repeated term "beyond," which is associated with the verb "to see," and the term "transparency" in block capitals: Io vedo al di là... sempre al di là, [...] di tutte le anime... non posso fermarmi spiritualmente. [...] Toglimi, o vita, lo strazio di questa TRASPARENZA infinita! (137) The second passage describes the dissolving of the narrating female self and the triumph of intuitive knowledge over rationality through the use of an analogical method whereby the physical is related to the metaphysical. The isolated attribute of the female persona's brain, for example, is initially connected to a vast, anthropomorphic night, and then to an abstract and unlimited entity: the infinite. Salpo in regioni svuotate da ogni consistenza — mi sfumo in una assenza completa, il Nulla. Ed è attraverso questo abolirsi di ogni coscienza, di ogni esattezza, a questo ridurre la mia forza pensante al suo minimo che io posso invece afferrare l'essenza del tutto: 9 Recent studies regarding the debate on posthumanity include Humanisms, Posthumanisms and Neohumanisms, edited by Lollini; Posthuman Bodies, edited by Halberstam and Livingston; and Clarke's Posthuman Metamorphosis. 10 This was also the ultimate goal of men. To this purpose, one can think of Marinetti's powerful mechanical man in his essay "L'uomo moltiplicato e il regno della macchina" of 1915 (199-293).</page><page sequence="6">180 Paola Sica l'Infinito. [...] Il mio cervello si identifica al tuo, notte immensa! La logica meccanica, legatrice, è sconfitta: rimangono gli indistruggibili, formidabili nuclei della intuizione. (73) Other Florentine women were reluctant to accept the excessive self indulgence of this scrittura azzurra-, among them, Enif Robert was one of the most vocal in her critique. In the introduction to her novel Un ventre di donna (1919), which was co-authored with Marinetti, Robert does not mention names, but she declares that the scrittrici azzurre are unable to confess their real erotic desires and inner thoughts; this is why they spend so much time hiding behind their over-refined, and at times ridiculous, descriptions of "ondeggiamenti aerei nello spazio azzurro" (XIII). In spite of her cutting remarks, however, Robert like the scrittrici azzurre, believed in the capacity of reaching a world beyond the physical; this is apparent in the chapters of Un ventre di donna in which her sick heroine attempts to heal by accepting Futurist treatment and, at the same time, desires to transform herself into a woman with unlimited mental power. But unlike most of the scrittrici azzurre, Robert is very explicit in representing her new women as individuals with earthly qualities and desires. Already in Chapter 1, "A Posillipo," the protagonist openly confesses her frustrations in her love life and distances herself from a group of traditional women whom she sees from her window: Nulla di comune fra me e quelle flaccide, enormi mattone napoletane in costume da bagno, nere, viscide e stemperate come foche sulla sabbia, con la loro prole che guizza e bolle scodellata intorno. (4) In spite of Robert's critique, the scrittrici azzurre made a significant contribution to the Futurist movement. One of them, Irma Valeria, was very active in discussing the traits of a new Futurist art regenerated through occult forces. Valeria, whose real name was Valeria Gelmetti Zorzi, was born in Verona in 1897. She joined the Futurist movement in 1914 when, together with her sister Mimi Gelmetti who was a painter, she became friends with Arnaldo and Bruno Ginanni-Corradini, Oscar Mara and Mario Carli. After 1922, Valeria progressively disappeared from the literary scene, only to return much later with the publication of a different style of poems (e.g. Le nuvole colombe, 1984). She was highly esteemed by some of her Futurist peers. Mario Carli dedicated the first edition of his 1918 book Notti filtrate to her, and Marinetti one of his tavole parolibere, Morbidezze in agguato + Bombarde italiane of 1917 (Cammarota 515-16). A few years after joining the Florentine movement, more precisely on June 10, 1917, Valeria published "Occultismo e arte nuova," an essay on the new directions of avant-garde art and the new artists. In this essay, she states that true artists are those who are able to anticipate the times and discern an unlimited</page><page sequence="7">Regenerating Life and Art: Futurism, Florentine Women, Irma Valeria 181 and eternal universe beyond the earthly world. In her words, "le [loro] anime si tendono e si arcuano nello spazio come quelle dei veggenti, come la stessa concava cavità del cielo" (2). Valeria describes these artists using terms derived from Arthur Rimbaud — "veggenti," for example — and alludes to the Symbolist poetics of correspondences. These allusions are particularly evident when she at first associates the artists' soul with that of the visionaries, and then relates the soul to the concave form of the sky. Her process of though recalls the one that Ginanni follows in her creative work "Variazioni." From an initial allusion to the artists' subjectivity she passes to the representation of their asexual and fluid soul, which, in the end, is objectified through the image of a boundless sky. Valeria then continues to explain the genesis of this process and who, in her time, was able to understand and follow it. From a perspective that one might describe as evolutionist, Valeria claims that, in retrospect, the embryonic traces of the new paranormal art are discernible in the life and work of her predecessors. Individuals in her age have become more evolved; they can better activate the renovating powers of their spirit and transpose their mediumistic experiences into art. Later alluding to an aesthetic hierarchy of values, she adds that artists' talent is determined by the degree of intensity of the visionary qualities expressed in their work. For her, not everyone is able to create, or to appreciate, new art. The masses are hostile to it, because they can only grasp the surface of things. When she finally refers to scientists, she attacks their traditional approach on similar grounds. She posits that traditional science is too coarse and too skeptical to unveil a higher type of knowledge, one that transcends the merely empirical.11 Art, on Valeria's terms, can probe into the depths of one's own soul and then transcend it. She believes that, through art, "l'atomo occulto del nostro essere e quello del mondo si unificano, si confondono perché non sono che la stessa cosa" (2). As a consequence, distinctions of gender and subjectivity disappear. Implicitly, that hierarchical social order that she had introduced by distinguishing her superior individuals from the masses is also erased. Numerous pieces of poetic prose collected in Valeria's Morbidezze in agguato (1917) and Fidanzamento con l'azzurro (1919) reflect the principles exposed in her essay on occultism and art. In her creative work, like in Ginanni's, an analogical method prevails, and images like infinite skies, world of lights, stars, azure colors and transparencies are recurrent. These elements connected to an infinite, self-regenerating world are the final destinations of 11 In making this declaration, Valeria is obviously close to other Florentine Futurists, including the brothers Ginanni-Corradini, Settimelli, and Mara, who, in their "Manifesto della scienza futurista" (1916), favored a new science that would study the phenomena of "medianismo, [...] psichismo, [...] rabdomanzia, [...] divinazione [...] telepatia" (2).</page><page sequence="8">182 Paola Sica undefined subjects — usually women — who, at times, transcend their bodily form and lose their sexual connotations, and who, at other times, become mere corporeal fragments: they appear transformed into eyes, brains and hands, even wings, to follow the ascending throbs of a universal soul. In the poem "Mendicanti d'azzurro" of Morbidezze in agguato, for example, the female subject yearns to reach celestial spaces, so that she will be able to prove her power and to attain her freedom. In this work, the subject is initially afflicted because, according to her, the principles of traditional science shackle her to earth like "troppo solidi ceppi [...] ai [...] piedi" (6). These principles prevent her from ascending to a perpetually self-regenerating dimension, in which boundaries are erased and all elements are related. In the work this dimension is described as a "striscia azzurrissima di mare accecato, senza coscienza di una vita anteriore, senza una meta per la vita futura" (7) and can only be entered by exceptional individuals portrayed with "limpide ali" (6), because they can "evaporare attraverso tutte le ebrezze pure [e] camminare verso la morte, come al più semplice gesto della vita eterna" (8). In the azure spaces of this poem, the fluid construction of the female subject reflects a desire to unleash an unlimited vital energy that the masses do not possess. This construction presupposes the negation of natural, biological rhythms. It follows that death is conceived not as a conclusion of an existential cycle, but rather as a beginning that, paradoxically, is in perpetual, metamorphic becoming. Valeria's new woman, therefore, opting for regeneration, symbolizes both the beginning and the becoming, but not the end. This new woman lacks realistic characterizations; however, her extraordinary force seems to allude to a desired change in the androcentric social structure in order to empower the feminine gender. Valeria does not create only female poetic personae who attempt to transcend their humanity and become one with an infinite universe; and in this she is different from Ginanni and closer to Robert. In certain works collected in Morbidezze and Fidanzamento — those written in a provocative and ironic tone — Valeria presents a group of female characters that employ their renovating energies to become assertive and rebel against conventional morality. At times traditionally beautiful female protagonists refuse to serve as objects of desire by deliberately revealing their flaws, and other times traditionally chaste heroines live their sexuality freely, rejecting their dependence on their male partners. The poem "Protesta" in Morbidezze in agguato exemplifies these tendencies. In "Protesta," the pure Shakespearean Ophelia is depicted as a cocotte. At first Ophelia teases Hamlet, laughs in his face, and then betrays him with an impudent, handsome young man. Other feminine characters like Berenice and Margherita that, in other contexts, are young and sensual, in this poem surprise readers. Berenice unexpectedly shows her "dentiera che scricchiola" (53), and Margherita displays her "trecce finte" (53). Through Valeria's Ofelia, Berenice and Margherita, a common message is indirectly</page><page sequence="9">Regenerating Life and Art: Futurism, Florentine Women, Irma Valeria 183 conveyed: in this specific historical moment, behavioral codes are in transformation, and women can claim rights that in former times were not reserved to them. In another type of poetic prose, which is rare, Valeria represents women whose power appears remarkably reduced. In one of these pieces titled "Un suicidio" (in Morbidezze in agguato), the poetic subject doubts that she is able to expend all her energies, and declares: Forse io non valgo quasi niente. Vivo la mia fitta sensibilità come un pardessus sul mio fragile cervello femminile. [...] Mi accontento di affacciarmi alle misteriose facili finestre dell'anima [...] ma non mi sono gettata da nessuna per morire divinamente. (59) The optimism that pervaded other works in which regeneration was yearned for and deemed possible has here disappeared. What prevails is a lack of esteem, a desire for a deeper existence beyond the human one, and an inability to achieve it. With her attempts to incorporate renewed energy and create new female representations, Valeria presents the complexities of her specific vision. According to her, the resort to paranormal powers is essential for women's reaching of posthumanity and deeper forms of knowledge, but her optimism to carry out this plan occasionally wavers and often remains unfulfilled. Her hope for women's emancipation is revealed through the actions of her revisited traditional Ofelia, Berenice and Margherita, but at times doubt and fear prevail. If one compares her with her female peers when she speaks about occultism, it is apparent that she defines more precisely what, in her opinion, constitutes the link among art, life and super-sensible dimension. As other Florentines have done, she tends to privilege the representation of feminine subjects dispersed in unlimited azure spaces, and for this reason she merges into the group of the scrittrici azzurre. However, even among these scrittrici she distinguishes herself, because while pondering the shifting balances of gender relations she neither describes her new women as spokespersons for an aggressive nationalism, nor does she compare them to new men. For example, unlike Maria Ginanni, she never clearly declares that women should resemble men to reach their emancipation. Ginanni, in fact, in her article of L'Italia futurista "Marinetti ferito in guerra" (2 May 1917), says that she would like to get rid of her female clothes and become a brave soldier fighting in World War I (1). Finally, in the more general context of Futurism, Valeria's main effort to regenerate individuals through posthumanity may be conceived as a search for new aesthetic strategies of gender-role identification in an age of profound change. As mentioned earlier, these representations could manifest the desire to revise the rules of an androcentric system through the reinforcement of feminine</page><page sequence="10">184 Paola Sica power. However, they could also suggest something else. They could reflect an attempt to avoid a direct critique of the pre-existent social order through the use of a new imagery offered by the new sciences and technology. After all, if one thinks again of Valeria's specific processes and representations of subjects dispersed in immensity, these often include images like delicate wings, little stars and transparencies, which traditionally could be associated with feminine taste. Her repertoire is different from the one that prevails in the work of certain Futurist men, among them Marinetti, who, in presenting his posthuman subjects, often connects their exuberant virility to the power of machines. In spite of her idiosyncrasies, however, Valeria shares certain traits with the other Futurists. In her, for example, as in the others, the search for regeneration, along with new aesthetic methods to represent it, was prompted by the numberless possibilities disclosed by new scientific discoveries and technological innovations. This search for regeneration was also a way to confront profound social and spiritual anxieties at a time in which these vast discoveries and innovations were accompanied both by the hope for national empowerment and the stark reality of death and destruction brought about by the world war.
