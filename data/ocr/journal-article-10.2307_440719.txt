AFRICAN LITERATURE Loeb, Harold, "The Literary Situation In South Africa," The Southern Re- view, 8, No. 2:371-7, Spring 1972. [An historical-sociological account with passing references to three "colored" writers: Adam Small, S. V. Petersen, P. J. Philander; one Zulu writer: Credo Vusamazulu Mutwa; -and one Xhosa writer: Noni Jabavu.] (J.M.D.) AIME, CIeSAIRE Smith, Robert P., Jr., "Aims C6saire, Playwright, Portrays Patrice Lumum- ba, Man of Africa," CLA Journal, 14:371-9, June, 1971. C6saire captured the glorification of Africa and the greatness of Lumumba. He dramatized in an exemplary and symbolic manner the whole history of a continent and a portion of humanity. (T.T.B.) AMADO, JORGE Silverman, Malcolm, "Moral Dilemma in Jorge Amado's Dona Flor e seus dois maridos," Romance Notes, 13:245-9, Winter 1971. The presence of two husbands, one sen- sual (but dead) and the other proper, dramatizes Flor's internal struggle be- tween materialism (the demand for pro- priety) and spiritualism (the need for sex). (A.K.) AMERICAN LITERATURE Peterson, Levi S., "Tragedy and Western American Literature," Western Amer- ican Literature, 6:243-9, Winter 1972. Some may reject the tragic grief at the passing of the frontier in A. B. Guthrie's The Big Sky as "sentimental and soft- minded," but our nation as a whole is manifesting "a renewed recognition" of the Romantic feeling that "wilderness is valuable." (W.G.F.) ANOUILH, JEAN Chateau, Gilbert, "Anouilh aux abimes," Nouvelle Revue Franfaise, No. 232: 101-2, April 1972. Since Beckett (1959), the decrepit An- ouilh rages alone. He returns to the standard situations and characters of his early period but in a language so flat and crude and with so awkward a stage script that one is sickened by the lowness of his thought. (T.T.B.) APOLLINAIRE, GUILLAUME Forsyth, Louise Barton, "Apollinaire's Use of Arthurian Legend," Esprit Cre- ateur, 12, No. 1:26-36, Spring 1972. The first version of L')chanteur pourris- sant, which made use of three versions of the Merlin legend, was serialized in Apollinaire's own review, Le Festin d'Esope, in 1904. (T.T.B.) ARAGON, LOUIS Kadish, Doris, "L'ironie et le roman en- gage: 'Les Beaux Quartiers' de Louis Aragon," French Review, 45:596-609, Feb. 1972. Aragon uses various ironic techniques to involve the bourgeois reader in his crit- icism of bourgeois society.

Arco's best works were probably Dali al desnudo, Rusia es otra cosa, El per- sonaje en el bolsillo and Los personajes son de carney hueso. (T.T.B.) ARGENTINE LITERATURE Magrini, C6sar, "Teatro argentino: aproximaci6n a un pecado original," Revista de Occidente, No. 100:153-63, July 1971. Most of the theater has been moribund since the generation of 1880; the theaters specialize in foreign productions, with the exception of individual costumbrismo plays of Leferrer or Pedro E. Pico. (T.T.B.) Pozzoni, Enrique, "Transgresi6n y nor- malizaci6n en la narrativa argentina contemporinea," Revista de Occidente, No. 100:172-91, July 1971. Contemporary novelists reveal critical in- quiry and revival of a lost realism, as varied as in the work of Borges, Leopoldo Morechal, Cortizar, and David Vifiar. (T.T.B.) ARLT, ROBERTO Tobar Garcia, Francisco, "Roberto Arlt, el inventor de la tristeza," Estafeta Literaria, No. 472:8-9, July 15, 1971. Arlt wrote columns of dissonant words, mistreated the language and attempted the novel, short story and theater, with- out success - in spite of which he was a true artist in search of happiness. (T.T.B.) ARTAUD, ANTONIN Ragu&amp;-Arias, Maria Jos6, "Teatro sin lit- eratura," Revista de Occidente, Nos. 101-2:213-29, Aug.-Sept. 1971. Artaud and Grotowsky are the forerun- ners of the Radical and Street theaters, the immediate roots being the Group Theater, Workers' Theater and Federal Theater of the 1930s. (T.T.B.) ASTURIAS, MIGUEL ANGEL Del Villar, Arturo, "Miguel Angel Astur- ias, un guerillero literario," Estafeta Literaria, No. 476:12-4, Sept. 15, 1971. Asturias' work is rooted in Latin-Amer- ican literature, sharing in native myth- ology as well as in the heroic sentiment of romanticism with a touch of modern- ism. His is a literature of testimony, de- nunciation and protest. (T.T.B.) Papeles de Son Armadans, 62:117-423, Aug.-Sep. 1971. [A special double-number issue devoted to Asturias. Articles, poetry, documents, bibliography.] (C.O.) Robles, Humberto E. "Perspectivismo, yuxtaposici6n y contraste en El sehior presidente," Revista Iberoamericana, No. 79, April-June 1972, pp. 215-36. The organizing principle of the novel is primarily contrast of perspectives via montage. The tone is often one of satire. The intent is clearly ethical, as in the Quixote. (C.O.) AUCLAIR, MARCELLE Prieto Barral, Maria Fortunata, "Mar- celle Auclair, en plena creaci6n," Es- tafeta Literaria, No. 472:15-6, July 15, 1971. Born in Chile, wife of Jean Pr6vost, friend of Garcia Lorca, Mme Auclair is a novelist, biographer and translator in her own right. (T.T.B.) BAROJA, PlO Embeita, Maria, "Raz6n y sensibilidad en la novela de Baroja," Estafeta Lit- eraria, No. 489:4-9, April 1, 1972. Baroja's hero enters the incoherent world of Hardy, Housman, Zola, Dreiser, Con- rad and Faulkner. Three characters are the key to his heroes: Ossorio, Moncade and Hurtado. (T.T.B.) BARTH, JOHN Kyle, Carol A., "The Unity of Anatomy: The Structure of Barth's Lost In the Funhouse," Critique, 13, No. 3:31-43. 286</page><page sequence="3">Current Bibliography According to Northrop Frye's classifica- tion of prose fiction as anatomy, Barth's Funhouse may be seen as a "microcosmic anatomy of criticism presented in the uni- fying and unique metaphor of a fun- house" in which reader, critic or writer can easily get lost. (R.M.P.) McDonald, James L., "Barth's Syllabus: The Frame of Giles Goat-Boy," Cri- tique, 13, No. 3:5-10. The frame of Giles Goat-Boy is more significant than critics have discerned. It "corroborates and amplifies the fable's theme." Both functional and necessary, the frame enables the reader to grasp the "thrust and spirit of the novel." (R.M.P.) Slethaug, Gordon E., "Barth's Refutation of the Idea of Progress," Critique, 13, No. 3:11-29. "In his last three works of fiction, Barth systematically debunks the idea of prog- ress by showing that life is existentially absurd,.... the individual, society, and cosmos are all inherently chaotic." As an alternative, he stresses "the actuality of cyclical correspondence." (R.M.P.) Weixlmann, Joseph N., "John Barth: A Bibliography," Critique, 13, No. 3:45- 55. "This bibliography should afford its user the information necessary to conduct al- most any type of scholarly inquiry into the writings of John Barth." (R.M.P.) BECKETT, SAMUEL Lyons, Charles R., "Beckett's Major Plays and the Trilogy," Comparative Drama, 5:254-68, Winter, 1971-72. Beckett's major plays, sharing a common experience with the trilogy "project their action in visual metaphors... essentially dramatic, and theatrical.... Their lan- guage is subtle and precise and.. . richly metaphorical." (D.P.) Steinberg, S. C., "The External and In- ternal in Murphy," Twentieth Century Literature, 18:93-110, April 1972. "Through a series of subtle motifs, word patterns, and structural incidents, Beckett has created the physical as the antithesis of the mental." (C.J.B.) BELLOW, SAUL Salter, D. P. M., "Optimism and Reaction in Saul Bellow's Recent Work," Crit- ical Quarterly, 14:57-66, Spring 1972. The area of ambiguity in Mr. Sammler's Planet lies between Artur Sammler's de- tached, emotionless observations and his occasional revulsion or disgust when he "comes into contact with young people or with some manifestation of sexuality." (A.S.W.) BENN, GOTTFRIED Carpi, Anna Maria, "Stasi e ritmo nel 'complesso di R6nne'," Studii German- ici, N.S. 9:96-118, Feb.-June 1971. [A structural analysis of some of Benn's early writings.] (J.R.R.) Sands, D. B., "The Polemic of Gottfried Benn's Oratorio 'Das Unaufh6rliche'," Monatshefte, 64:2-14, Spring 1972. The oratorio "can be considered chiefly as a literary phenomenon." Its overall nature is affirmative, for "ontological val- ues arise with the individual's recognition of... the primary importance of a meta- physical vision achieved through... ac- ceptance of mutability as an ultimate truth. . . ." (R.H.L.) Schocken, Gerschom, "Zu einem kleinen Gedicht von Gottfried Benn," Neue Deutsche Hefte, 19 (No. 133):62-3, No. 1, 1972. Knowledge of corrupt Hebrew expres- sions used by German Jews in the 1920's helps in understanding Benn's short poem "Man denkt, man dichtet...." (J.R.R.) BIBLIOGRAPHY Williams, Ora, "A Bibliography of Works Written by American Black Women," CLA Journal, 15:354-77, March 1972. [An important bibliography since the black woman has always written. In fact, the first known literature of a Black American is that of Lucy Terry whose "Bars of Flight" was published in 1746. One must be concerned with the Black Woman's message.] (T.T.B.) 287</page><page sequence="4">Twentieth Century Literature BLACK LITERATURE Yellin, Jean Fagan, "An Index of Liter- ary Materials in The Crisis, 1910-1934: Articles, Belles Lettres and Book Re- views," CLA Journal, 14:452-65, June 1971, 15:197-234, Dec. 1971. While The Crisis' crop of dramas, essays, and fiction is full, the richest harvest is the poetry. Its publication of poems by Langston Hughes, 1921, Jean Toomer and Countee Cullen, 1922, and Arna Bontemps, 1924, testifies to its vital role in the Harlem Renaissance. (T.T.B.) BLOCH-MICHEL, JEAN Blot, Jean, "Jean Bloch-Michel et la lit- terature engag6e," Nouvelle Revue FranCaise, No. 229:95-9, Jan. 1972. Bloch-Michel's heroes affirm an individ- ual egotism only to blame themselves for it afterwards. His trilogy of Un homme estimable, Le visage nu and Daniel et Noemi complement one another. (T.T.B.) BLOK, ALEXANDER Altshuler, A., "Nenavidyashchaya lyu- bov," Voprosy literatury, 16:68-89, Feb. 1972. "The Scythians" is one of Blok's most enigmatic works. As in "The Twelve" Blok tries here to solve a problem of creativity and of revolutionary art in gen- eral. In the center of this problem one sees the road to a new humanism as the necessary solution. (V.D.) BOLL, HEINRICH Fetzer, John, "The Scales of Injustice: Comments on Heinrich B611's Die Waage der Baleks," German Quarterly, 45:472-9, May 1972. It is less than "abundantly clear" that Bill's sympathies are absolutely with those oppressed by the Baleks. He is am- bivalent, in effect cautioning against wholesale destruction when replacement would be an appropriate redress. (R.H.L.) BONNEFOY, YVES Esteban, Claude, "L'6cho d'une de- meure," Nouvelle Revue Frangaise, No. 225:19-34, Sept. 1971. The act of loving seems for Bonnefoy the re-discovered ritual of the real return to Being. (T.T.B.) BORGES, JORGE LUIS Gertel, Zunilda, "'Heraiclito,' conjunci6n de opuestos," Kentucky Romance Quarterly, 19:237-50, 1972. An exlication of this 1969 poem exem- plifies the present technique of Borges, but this poem is more allusive, less direct, than earlier "metaphysical" works. (C.O.) Giordano, Jaime, "Forma y sentido de 'La escritura del dios' de Jorge Luis Borges," Revista Iberoamericana, No. 78, Jan.-March 1972, pp. 105-15. The story is an allegory of solipsistic knowledge similar to the cave myth of Socrates. But for Borges, truth lies in the vision itself, all-consuming, invali- dating the integrity of the individual, who never leaves the cave-prison. (C.O.) G6mez Ortiz, Manuel: "Borges no quiere ser inmortal," Estafeta Literaria, No. 480:7-8, Nov. 15, 1971. The eternal future candidate for the Nobel prize, Borges, is a great writer but politically conservative. Almost blind, he lives in a vague world with his acolytes and at his post in the National Library. (T.T.B.) Sucre, Guillermo, "Borges, una po&amp;tica de la desposesi6n," Revista Ibero- americana, No. 79, April-June 1972, pp. 187-98. Though Borges later repented of his early ultraista poems, they are an integral part of his work. "Jactancia de quietud" is an example which contains implicit the essence of his later work. (C.O.) BRAITHWAITE, WILLIAM STANLEY Butcher, Philip, "William Stanley Braith- waite and the College Language Asso- ciation," CLA Journal, 15:117-25, Dec. 1971. Braithwaite is conceded to be a promi- nent critic of great sensibility but his poetry has been assailed as unintelligibly esoteric and deficient in racial feeling, and he himself as the most outstanding example of perverted energy produced in the 1903-1917 period. (T.T.B.) 288</page><page sequence="5">Current Bibliography BRAVO VILLASANTE, CARMEN Anonymous, "Escritores de Hoy," Es- pahia Hoy, No. 18:72, Dec. 1971. Essayist, anthropologist and biographer of Bettina Brentano, Juan Valera, Pardo Bazain, Avellaneda and Gald6s, Bravo Villasante has penetrated into the situ- ations and individuals impassioned with literature, particularly through her ample documental knowledge and extraordinary scientific and cultural baggage. (T.T.B.) BRECHT, BERTOLT Buono, Franco, "Una 'Inquiry' di Brecht," Studii Gerrhanici, N.S. 9:119- 58, Feb.-June 1971. [This is an examination of Brecht's in- tent in writing his Dreigroschenroman.] (J.R.R.) Chiarini, Paolo, "Quattro Variazione Brechtiane," Studii Germanici, N.S. 9:159-86, Feb.-June 1971. [The four studies collected here concern Expressionism, alienation, Brecht and Stanislavsky and Die Mutter.] (J.R.R.) Hartung, Giinter, "Brechts Stiick Die Tage der Kommune," Weimarer Beit- riige, 18:106-44, No. 2, 1972. [This detailed analysis of Brecht's work stresses its political content.] (J.R.R.) Mantle, Rodney, "Bertolt Brecht's Gal- gei-An Early Dramatic Fragment," Monatshefte, 63:380-5, Winter 1971. Galgei, as written in 1918, centered on the black market. It was rewritten into a refutation of Expressionism's idealistic concept of man. Plot continuity, and a move away from contemporary economic problems, can be traced from Galgei to Mann ist Mann. (R.H.L.) Mathieu, G. Bording, "Zur Deutung der vorletzten Zeile in Brechts Kreide- kreis," Monatshefle, 63:235-41, Fall 1971. Only with reference to the description of good driving in the Keuner-Story "Two Drivers" can meaning be given to the lines at the end of Der kaukasische Kreidekreis; the child's mother will steer its education towards becoming a socially conscious person. (R.H.L.) Morley, Michael, "Brecht's 'Beim Lesen des Horaz': An Interpretation," Mo- natshefte, 63:372-9, Winter 1971. Brecht's short poem probably refers to Epistles 1.2. rather than Odes 1.2. The poem then appears in a more resigned and negative light-which accords with the preference of Brecht's Galileo in his old age for Horace. (R.H.L.) BRETON, ANDRE Martin, Claude, "'Nadja' et le mieux- dire," Revue d'Histoire Litteraire de la France, 72:274-86, March-April 1972. The 1963 revision contains significantly extensive changes with respect to the 1928 first edition, betraying Breton's con- cern for the well-written work of litera- ture. (A.K.) Morel, Jean-Pierre, "Aur61lia, Gradiva, X: psychanalyse et po6sie dans Les Vases communicants," Revue de Lit- tirature Comparde, 46:68-89, Jan.- March 1972. Although Breton professed Freudianism, he rejected the unconscious and the idea of repression; he considered dream, re- ality, and desire as part of the function- ing of thought and did not make a dis- tinction between them. (A.K.) BUERO VALLEJO, ANTONIO Atlee, A. F. Michael, "Antonio Buero Vallejo y Dios," Hispan6fila, No. 44:52-7, Jan. 1972. Buero's theater is ethical, preaching ab- negation as the cure for Spain's post Civil War ills. Though his ethic is Christian in form, it depends neither on personal faith nor on divine intervention, but sim- ply on human self-sacrifice, for its effi- cacy. (C.O.) L6pez Gorge, Jacinto, "Antonio Buero Vallejo y su tiltima obra," Estafeta Literaria, No. 481:7-9, Dec. 1, 1971. Buero's Llegada de los dioses is a great improvement over his other dramatic works, in approach, decor and universal application, rather than, as heretofore, being representative purely of a Spanish social theatre. (T.T.B.) 289</page><page sequence="6">Twentieth Century Literature Weiss, Gerard R., F.M.S., "Buero Val- lejo's Theory of Tragedy in El traga- luz," Revista de Estudios Hispdnicos, 5:147-60, May 1971. Buero's tragedy has two aspects, both found in this play: the tragic resolution of necessity, when circumstances oblige man, and the symbolic resolution of hope and struggle, based on man's use of his liberty. (C.O.) BUTOR, MICHEL Lydon, Mary, "Sibylline Imagery in Bu- tor's La Modification," Modern Lan- guage Review, 67:300-8, April 1972. "A study of the sibyl episode in La Modification is thus very revealing of Butor's method of composition in the fullest sense." (J.R.R.) CAMUS, ALBERT Cabilau, Jean-Francois, L'expression du temps dans L'Etranger d'Albert Ca- mus," Revue Belge de Philologie et d'Histoire, 49:866-74, No. 3, 1971. "Basically, the expression of time in L'Etranger by Albert Camus does not have a precise role as such." (J.R.R.) Forde, Marianna C., "Condemnation and Imprisonment in L'Etranger and Le dernier jour d'un condamne," Ro- mance Notes, 13:211-6, Winter 1971. Hugo's and Camus' heroes suffer from lack of sympathy and communication with their judges, but Meursault reaffirms life in the face of death whereas the con- demned man remains mentally impris- oned. (A.K.) Naudin, Marie, "Hugo et Camus face ' la peine capitale," Revue d'Histoire Litteraire de la France, 72:264-73, March-April 1972. Le dernier jour d'un condamnd and L'Etranger share a refusal of moral con- vention, criticism of social institutions, and sensual evocation of the past. These similarities are underlined by identical stylistic devices. (A.K.) Nojgaard, Morten, "Temps et espace dans la Chute de Camus," Orbis Lit- terarum, 26:291-320, No. 4, 1971. In Camus' Chute certain linguistic fea- tures function as physical signals of lit- erary structure. (J.R.R.) CANO, JOSEl LUIS Del Villar, Arturo, "El escritor, al dia," Estafeta Literaria, No. 490:8-11, April 15, 1972. Cano's authentic passion was and is po- etry-written personally, anthologized, criticized, translated and commented, al- though the majority of his literary out- put includes translations, biographies, essays and criticisms. (T.T.B.) CARPENTIER, ALEJO Aparicio, Mara, "Intelectualismo o hu- manismo en 'El Siglo de las Luces'," Estafeta Literaria, No. 476:18-9, Sept. 15, 1971. The Cuban writer Carpentier is simple and imbued with humanism. One does not have to look between his words to understand him. Not marked by intel- lectualism, he expresses himself in tac- tile descriptions, with juicy words and adjectives. (T.T.B.) Rodriguez Monegal, Emir, "Alejo Car- pentier: Lo real y lo maravilloso en El reino de este mundo," Revista Iberoamericana, 37:619-49, July-Dec. 1971. In his 1949 prologue to this novel, Car- pentier breaks with European tradition (engagement, surrealism) to explore a newly conceived magic realism. His characters are of European-American stock, but their conflicts are those of marvelous primitive myth versus an over- lay of Western civilization. (C.O.) CATHER, WILLA Durham, Philip, "Willa Cather's 'There- about'," Neophilologus, 73:83-9, April 1972. "The point of this essay is to suggest that we can no longer accept Willa Cather's factual statements as fact.... Willa Cather created 'facts.' " (J.R.R.) Hart, Clive, "The Professor's House: A Shapely Story," Modern Language Re- view, 67:271-81, April 1972. "In creating a novel with so consistently reflexive a structure, she was using 'imi- tative form' at its best, exemplifying in the harmony of the design that system of correspondences which is at the heart of her meaning."

CHESNUTT, CHARLES Andrews, William L., "Chesnutt's Pates- ville: The Presence and Influence of the Past in The House Behind The Cedars," CLA Journal, 15:284-94, March 1972. Patesville is Fayetteville, N.C. The novel is an illustration of the social effects and moral consequences of a particular peo- ple's imperviousness to the passing of time and the changes which supposedly accompany it. The power of tradition to stymie beneficial change is the compre- hensive theme. (T.T.B.) Britt, David D., "Chesnutt's Conjur Tales: What You See Is What You Get," CLA Journal, 15:269-83, March 1972. Neither in the tradition of James and Maupassant nor parallel to the fantasies of Joel Chandler Harris, these tales are primarily a study in duplicity that masks or reveals its meaning according to the predisposition of the reader. (T.T.B.) CLAUDEL, PAUL Deuel, Mildred, "A Study of the Dra- matic Structure of Partage de Midi from 1905-1949," French Review, 45:964-70, April 1972. The different versions provide informa- tion concerning problems of character development and dramatic structure. In the 1949 version Claudel improved the dramatic structure but destroyed the unity of tone. (A.K.) Watson, Harold, "Fire and Water, Love and Death in Le Soulier de satin," French Review, 45:971-9, April 1972. Claudel's dialogue with death culminates in this play, in which images of fire and water underline the themes of love puri- fied and liberation expected. (A.K.) COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Fargues, Alfred M., "Wirkungsgeschichte oder Obereinkunft am Nullpunkt der Literatur," Germanisch-romanische Monatsschrift, 53(N.S. 22):23-38, No. 1, 1972.

Gleaves, Edwin S., "Hemingway and Baroja: Studies in Spiritual Anar- chism," Revista de Estudios Hispdni- cos, 5:363-75, Oct. 1971. Hemingway's debt to Baroja is perhaps less in the area of language and plot, more in that of world outlook: extreme individualism. (C.O.)

(R.O.R.) Paolucci, Anne, "Theatre of Illusion: Pirandello's Liold and Machiavelli's Mandragola," Comparative Literature Studies, 9:44-57, March 1972. "Both plays examine the intrigue sur- rounding the seduction of a virtuous woman. Pirandello offers a romantic solution to justify the seduction; Machia- velli, instead, insists on the corruption of human nature within the framework of social and political fragmentation." (R.O.R.) Read, Malcolm, "Brecht, Klabund and the Chalk Circle," Modern Languages, 53:28-33, March 1972. "Whereas Klabund develops the play around mystical philosophy of China, Brecht, whilst styling himself upon Con- fucius the humanitarian, rejects the value of tradition and visualizes a re- newal of mankind through the spirit of socialism." (J.R.R.) Werner, Klaus, "Zum Beispiel: Peter Riihmkorf," Weimarer Beitriige, 17- (No. 11):95-110, Nov. 1971. As playwrights Enzensberger underwrites, Riihmkorf overwrites. (J.R.R.) Westlake, J. H. J., "Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George Or- well's Nineteen Eighty-Four," Die Neu- eren Sprachen, 71(N.S. 21):94-102, Feb. 1972.

CORTAZAR, JULIO MacAdam, Alfred J., "La simultaneidad en las novelas de Cortizar," Revista Iberoamericana, 37:667-76, July-Dec. 1971. Spatial form rather than anecdote and temporal progression allow Cortizar to "stop" time and give several facets of a character, motif, etc., simultaneously, as in Los premios and Rayuela. (C.O.) Pages Larraya, Antonia, "Perspectivas de 'Axolotl,' cuento de Julio Corti- zar," Nueva Narrativa Hispanoameri- cana, 2:7-24, Sept. 1972. The brief story exemplifies our "agonic solipsism," our intrinsic dualism, and suggests a mysterious relation between ordinary experience and a legendary past, between self and other. (C.O.) Wood, Don E., "Surrealistic Transfor- mation of Reality in Cortazar's 'Besti- ario'," Romance Notes, 13:239-42, Winter 1971.

CONRAD, JOSEPH Gertzman, Jay A., "Commitment and Sacrifice in 'Heart of Darkness': Mar- low's Response to Kurtz," Studies in Short Fiction, 9:187-96, Spring 1972. Marlow mistakes the importance of the commitment to "a saving illusion" which alone preserves the fragile, cherished absolutes (embodied in Kurtz's Intended and the world she inhabits) which are "absurdities to the impartial observer." (R.O.R.) CRANE, HART McMichael, James, "Hart Crane," The Southern Review, 8, No. 2:290-309, Spring 1972. Close examination of The Bridge reveals that "The Dance" brings together the themes and techniques of the whole: "that meaning and value are not arbi- trarily superimposed upon the material world but that they actually inhere in it." (J.M.D.) CUBAN LITERATURE Miranda, Julio E., "El nuevo teatro cu- bano," Revista de Occidente, No. 105: 336-46, Dec. 1971. From 1925 to 1942 Estorino, Brone, Reguera Saumell, Quintero and Jesuis Diaz cultivated realism, but Ant6n Ar- rufat, influenced by Beckett and Pifiera, approached the metaphysical and the ab- surd. Nicolds Dorr and Jose Triana stressed surrealism and cruelty, with po- litical and revolutionary overtones.

Fedin's Cities and Years is a sophisti- cated and a very complex work. The complexity is in (1) the patterns of re- lationships of the major characters, (2) the treatment of time and space, (3) the fundamental constructional principle of the plot as a whole and its aesthetic effect upon the reader. (V.D.) FERNANDEZ FLOREZ, DARIO Anonymous "Escritores de Hoy," Espai~a Hoy, No. 18:68, Dec. 1971.

FOWLES, JOHN Brantlinger, Patrick, Adam, Ian, and Rothblatt, Sheldon, " 'The French Lieutenant's Woman': A Discussion," Victorian Studies, 15:339-56, March, 1972. (1) The novel was a bestseller primarily because it patronizingly reinforced false premises of anti-Victorianism, especially regarding duty (Brantlinger). (2) Brant- linger correctly analyzes the skill and "self-complacency" of Fowles but under- rates the successes and misses the main flaw: the weak portrayal of Sarah (Adam). (3) From an historian's point of view, Fowles has used the historical novel to "help us see ourselves as we are" and has synthesized two usually- alien forms of writing: historical and literary (Rothblatt). (G.S.) Evarts, Prescott, Jr., "Fowles' The French Lieutenant's Woman as Trag- edy," Critique, 13, No. 3:57-69. The novel is a "mannerist tragedy set in Victorian times . . . with "distortions and lack of symmetry . . . associated with Mannerism, as it revolted against Renais- sance form. Fowles has followed many ... Victorian conventions while at the same time making them obscure, trou- bled, and illogical."

Laughlin, Rosemary M., "Faces of Power in the Novels of John Fowles," Critique, 13, No. 3:71-88. Although widely differing on the sur- face, the three novels of John Fowles are related by the emphasis in each on "the power that one person can wield" to "violate," "annihilate," or... ironic- ally, to help another achieve "fullness of personality and humanity." (R.M.P.) Rackham, Jeff, "John Fowles: The Ex- istential Labryinth," Critique, 13, No. 3:89-103. Fowles' novels are not merely entertain- ing mysteries as critics have asserted, but "metaphorical exploration[s] of ex- istentialism" wherein characters are trapped in "a frightening... labyrinth of reality in which rational explanations break down and almost every turning leads to a 'dead-end." (R.M.P.) FRENCH LITERATURE Meakin, D., "'Un classicisme cr6atur': Charles P6guy and Albert Camus," Forum For Modern Language Studies, 8:184-93, April 1972.

FRISCH, MAX Franz, Hertha, "Der Intellektuelle in Max Frisch's Don Juan und Homo faber," Zeitschrift fiir deutsche Philo- logie, 90:555-63, Dec. 1971.

Helmetag, Charles H., "The Image of the Automobile in Max Frisch's Stiller," Germanic Review, 47:118-26, March 1972. Frisch makes subtle and striking use of the automobile image in Stiller as a ci- pher for the "Bildnis." Not by chance this image occurs most frequently when America is the scene of action. (R.H.L.) Kieser, Rolf, "Man as his own Novel: Max Frisch and the Literary Diary," Germanic Review, 47:109-17, March 1972. Frisch's distrust of order "leads him to the only possible literary form: the frag- ment. And the fragmentary literary form par excellence is the diary." But "frag- mentary" refers to the literary form, not to Frisch's style and craftsmanship. (R.H.L.) FROST, ROBERT Haynes, Donald T., "The Narrative Unity of A Boy's Will," PMLA, 87: 452-64, May 1972. When the narrative sequence of A Boy's Will is examined in its original form, the poems emerge "at once as Frost's retrospective look at what had been, and a harbinger of what he would become." (S.C.) FOHMANN, FRANZ Maier, Kurt S., "Franz Fiihmann's Ju- denauto: A Study of Judeophobia," Germanic Review, 47:41-9, January 1972. "Franz Fiihmann's Das Judenauto is the title story for a group of fourteen chron- ologically ordered episodes of crises in German life from 1929 to 1949."

FUENTES, CARLOS Gyurko, Lanin A., "El yo y su imagen en Cambios de piel de Carlos Fu- entes," Revista Iberoamericana, 37: 689-709, July-Dec. 1971.

Arabist, poet, translator, Garcia G6mez has penetrated via the linguistic channel into the existential reasoning and es- thetic roots of the Arab peoples. His Poemas ardbigo-andaluces show traces of sentiments in which affection, passions and grief alternate with the happy play of light situations. (T.T.B.) GARCIA LORCA, FEDERICO Gonzailez, Yara, "Los ojos en Lorca a trav6s de 'Santa Lucia y San Lizaro'," Hispanic Review, 40:145-61, Spring 1972. Lorca's vision has at least ten directions, ranging from linking the esthetic and the erotic to the vision of death as the final truth. The surrealistic "Santa Lucia ..." suggests an eleventh direction to- ward a treasure beyond the grave. (C.O.) Loughran, David, "Myth, the Gypsy, and two 'Romances Hist6ricos'," MLN, 87:253-71, March 1972. The romances hist6ricos in the Ro- mancero gitano are allegories of the com- ing of dawn. Thus they are in keeping with Lorca's understanding of the romance as the remaking of an old myth. (A.K.) Parr, James A., "La escena final de Yerma," .Duquesne Hispanic Review, 10:23-9, Spring 1971. Juan's selfish insistence on self-gratifica- tion culminates in the final orgy scene when he drunkenly commands his wife to have "unnatural" relations with him. Her fury, an opposing culmination, re- sults in his death. (C.O.) Predmore, Richard L., "Simbolismo am- biguo en la poesia de Garcia Lorca," Papeles de Son Armadans, 64:229- 40, Dec. 1971. From his earliest works, Lorca insists on ambiguous symbols, showing thus the ambiguities of love as well as its mysterious relationship to death. (C.O.) Salinas, Pedro, "Federico Garcia Lorca," MLN, 87:169-77, March 1972. Federico was admired and loved by his compatriots and was endowed with the gifts of animation, invention, imagina- tion, expressiveness, and generosity. (A.K.) Sanchez, Roberto G., "Lorca, the Post- War Theater and the Conflict of Gen- erations," Kentucky Romance Quar- terly, 19:17-29, 1972. Post-war writers and theater-goers in Spain are largely neutral or negative regarding Lorca's importance. Yet he was committed-in person and in his later plays-to social goals akin to those of today's youth. It is really style, tech- nique, which strike many as passe. (C.O.) GARCIA MARQUEZ, GABRIEL Dario Carrillo, Germain and Barry Stults, "Cien afios de soledad y el concepto de la 'caida afortunada'," Revista Iberoamericana, No. 79, April-June 1972, pp. 236-62. The discovery of love and tragedy- including other attributes of mankind after Adam's "fortunate fall,"----consti- tutes the experience through which the Buendias come to self-knowledge and to salvation. (C.O.) Levine, Suzanne Jill, "La maldici6n del incesto en Cien afios de soledad," Re- vista Iberoamericana, 37:711-24, July- Dec. 1971. Though incest here is a means of joy, and though some scholars maintain the incestuous impulse is normal, it is also a type of medieval curse which con- demns the entire Buendia line to eternal solitude.

HEMINGWAY, ERNEST Anastasev, N., "Posle legendy," Voprosy literatury, 16:119-34, Jan. 1972. Hemingway's latest works are in many ways polemic, although only in the ar- tistic realm.

Koeppen's silence during recent years is the result of choice; he will again address his literary public when he feels he has a message of importance to them. (J.R.R.) KOSINSKI, JERZY Cahill, Daniel J., "Jerzy Kosinski: Re- treat from Violence," Twentieth Cen- tury Literature, 18:121-32, April 1972. "Both Kosinski's Russian studies and his novels reaffirm the final necessity of turn- ing from violence and turbulence if man- kind is to be restored to a vigorous life." (C.J.B.) LARTIGUY, JEAN O'Connell, David, "Jean Larteguy: A Popular Phenomenon," French Review, 45:1087-97, May 1972. The nine novels published in the sixties are popularizations of current events, in most cases of foreign wars, which explain and analyze the political situation of the country in which they take place. (A.K.) LATIN AMERICAN LITERATURE Gyurko, Lanin A., "Modern Hispanic American Fiction: Novel of Action and Narrative of Consciousness," Sympo- sium, 25:359-76, Winter 1971. El sehior presidente of Asturias, Pedro Pdramo of Rulfo and La muerte de Ar- temio Cruz of Fuentes all maintain to some degree the omniscient narrator, but linear time is nearly absent. The disinte- gration is portrayed in transpersonal terms as environment and consciousness are in- terwoven. (C.O.) Nueva Narrativa Hispanoamericana, 1: 5-232, Sept. 1971.

LAWRENCE, D. H. Barber, David S., "Community in Women in Love," Novel, 5, No. 1:32-41, Fall 1971. One of the important dualities in Law- rence is that of the ecstatic, Impersona- timeless state of being-- usually one's sex relationship with another providing access to this world - and the personal- temporal state of living in the daily world. (T.T.B.) Emmett, V. J., Jr., "Structural Irony in D. H. Lawrence's 'The Rocking-Horse Winner,' " Connecticut Review, 5, No. 2:5-10, April 1972. The story ".. .resembles the construction of the typical fairy tale... but the par- allels ... are not exact. Imperfect parallels are used systematically to produce an ironic distortion that subverts the tradi- tional values of the fairy tale." (W.K.) Farmer, David, "D. H. Lawrence's 'The Turning Back': The Text and Its Gene- sis in Correspondence," D. H. Lawrence Review, 5:121-31, Summer 1972. With this publication of "The Turning Back," it is possible "to see exactly where this dated poem fits into the Lawrence canon and how integral it is with the ideas he expressed in his correspondence during 1915." (R.M.P.) Kirkham, Michael, "D. H. Lawrence's Last Poems," D. H. Lawrence Review, 5:97-120, Summer 1972. In this three-part essay, the author dis- cusses Lawrence's Last Poems as 1-"an act of spiritual preparation" before death, 2-their relation to his early themes, and 3-through close analysis, shows how they poetically embody his themes. (R.M.P.) LeDoux, Larry V., "Christ and Isis: The Function of the Dying and Reviving God in The Man Who Died," D. H.

(R.M.P.) LAXNESS, HALLDOR Scandinavica devoted this year's Supple- ment to honoring Laxness. Appearing on his 70th birthday, April 23, 1972, the number contained remarks from the edi- tor, a bibliography (p. 3f.) and a number of articles. (J.R.R.) LE CLIZIO, J. M. G. Amette, Jacques-Pierre, "La m6decine de J. M. G. Le Cl6zio," Nouvelle Revue Frangaise, No. 229:78-80, Jan 1972. Le Cl6zio refuses individual creation to the profit of a collective creation. He de- nounces anthropomorphic literature, fol- lowing the lead of Rimbaud, Blanchot, Paulhan and some texts of Robbe-Grillet and Butor. (T.T.B.) LEONOV, LEONID Plank, D. L., "Unconscious Motifs in Leonid Leonov's The Badgers," Slavic and East European Journal, 16:19-35, Spring 1972. There is no doubt that in The Badgers Leonov makes "conscious use of the un- conscious." The novel is full of symbol- ism and not all of it has an exclusively ideological significance. Some motifs are erotic and are open to further studies. (V.D.) LERNET-HOLENIA, ALEXANDER Scheible, Hartmut, "Suche nach Identitiit und Protest gegen Geschichte," Frank- furter Hefte, 27:275-80, April 1972. It is much too easy to regard Lernet-Hole- nia's mocking of nobility simply as nos- talgia. (J.R.R.) LITERARY THEORY Anashenkov, B., "Den vcherashnii, den nyneshnii," Voprosy literatury, 16:6-38, March 1972. Although our position hasn't changed and we believe the working class to be the fundamental force in the development of society, it isn't enough to write only about drivers and fishermen- literature has a great task to redefine the ever- changing qualities of a new hero. (V.D.) Bocharov, A., "Mera otvestvenosti," Vo- prosy literatury, 16:3-30, Feb. 1972. Socialist humanism always values means as well as goals. Even Marx proclaimed the truth of the above. Soviet prose, there- fore, has a great task in exploring all the depths of reality in the Soviet people in their dialectical complexity. (V.D.) Bolshakov, V. "Surrealizm ego traditsii i preemniki," Voprosy literatury, 16:104- 23, Feb. 1972. Today's surrealism is not an abstract aca- demic question. Breton underscored the fact that surrealism does its utmost to create "short circuits"; in literature and in general, surrealism always is avant-garde, and its writers individually expressed their Weltanschauung. (V.D.) Iezuitov, A., "Deistvennoe oruzhie v ideo- logicheskoi borbe," Voprosy literatury, 16:3-20, Jan. 1972. The twenty-fourth congress of the CPSU set forth these main requirements for So- viet literature: 1. A strict observance of socio-psychological changes. 2. Aid in formulating the Weltanschauung of the Soviet man. 3. The necessity of partiinost'. 4. The ideological battle was and still re- mains realism. (V.D.) Kagan, M., "Literatura kak chelovekove- denie," Voprosy literatury, 16:152-75, March 1972. The problem of contemporary literature is to redefine the concept of "the artistic knowledge of man." This study can be divided into three phases: 1. The study of man as an individual. 2. A typological study of man (i.e. zoon politikon or homo sapiens). 3. Man in his interaction with others. (V.D.) Markov, D., "O formakh khudozhestven- nogo obobshcheniya v sotsialistiches- kom realizme," Voprosy literatury, 16:71-88, Jan. 1972. Soviet literature constantly faces the prob- lem of "differentiation in generalization of various forms of imagery in socialist realism" and the study of socialist realism is closely related to the study of its esthe- tic nature.

London wanted to dramatize a new ver- sion of human dignity but drifted towards the pessimistic, undeniable present, partly because he was more skillful at creating suggestive landscapes than characters. (T.T.B.) LOPEZ ANGLADA, LUIS Anonymous, "Letras," Espaiia Hoy, No. 18:71, Dec. 1971. L6pez Anglada's poetry rests on various events occurring in the life of the poet and permit the reader to know his fears, illusions and longings: the idealized love, marriage, children, home, which replace his former impatience. (T.T.B.) LOPEZ SALINAS, ARMANDO Anonymous, "Letras," Esparia Hoy, No. 18:69, Dec. 1971. L6pez Salinas is enrolled in the critical classification of "social realism" or "liter- ature of testimony." However, he avoids any veiled political allusions by depend- ing more on persons than situations. (T.T.B.) LOPEZ VELARDE, RAMON L6pez Martinez, Jose, "Conmemoraciones literarias en Hispanoambrica," Estafeta Literaria, No. 472:11-2, July 15, 1971. L6pez Velarde's poetry contains a descrip- tive force that is infrequent in men of his generation, and consequently it is the subject of many commentaries and critical studies published in Mexico and abroad. (T.T.B.) MACHADO, ANTONIO O'Kane, Sister Eleanor, C.S.C., "Antonio Machado, aprendiz de saber popular," MLN, 87:232-52, March 1972. Machado believed in the "essential man" and recommended the thorough knowl- edge of his proverbs and sayings. He used popular expressions extensively and felt that Cervantes' greatness came from use of set phrases. [Followed by a long list of proverbs used by Machado.] (A.K.) MAILER, NORMAN Carrascal, Jose Maria, "Norman Mailer, prisionero de si mismo," Estafeta Lite- raria, No. 478:36, Oct. 15, 1971. Mailer is the typical case of a man ob- sessed by women in General but incapable of establishing with them, one or several, a lasting, fruitful, natural relationship. (T.T.B.) MANDELSTAM, OSSIP Dymshits, A., " 'Ya v mir vkhozhu...' ", Voprosy literatury, 16:67-93, March 1972. Mandelstam-the sincere lyricist and the fine poet-was under the influence of "the school" of philosophic idealism, but he always remained a true lyricist and his works belong organically to Russian cul- ture-revolutionary as well as Soviet. (V.D.) MANEGAT, LUIS G. Manegat, Julio: "El deber y la tristeza," Estafeta Literaria, No. 472:18-9, July 15, 1971. Journalist, critic and novelist, Manegat also wrote essays and theatrical works. As a regional novelist of Barcelona and its environs, he also was steeped in roman- ticism. (T.T.B.) MANN, HEINRICH Thoenelt, Klaus, "Heinrich Manns Psy- chologie des Faschismus," Monatshefte, 63:220-34, Fall 1971. Heinrich Mann's essays from 1919 to 1933 reveal a disenchantment with the Weimar Republic and a foresighted judgment of the nature of Fascism: totalitarianism and war. After World War II comes his final disappointment-he sees the characteris- tics of Weimar threatening the Western world. (R.H.L.) MANN, THOMAS Bance, A. F., "Der Tod in Venedig and the Triadic Structure," Forum For Modern Language Studies, 8:148-61, April 1972. The triadic structure, which describes the movement from innocence to knowledge to the final stage of regained innocence, provides "a whole intellectual tradition" which is central to Mann's "treatment of the dubious artist-figure Aschenbach."

"It is the intent of this essay to show that that which one in a cut and dried formula likes to call Thomas Mann's pessimism can only be paraphrased and understood by means of a very subtle and differen- tiated presentation." (J.R.R.) Kirchberger, Lida, "Popularity as a Tech- nique: Notes on Tonio Kr6ger," Mo- natshefte, 63:321-34, Winter 1971. "... Thomas Mann incorporated elements of Werther and Immensee into a new and seemingly subjective work of his own." The reasons lie in "his desire to transcend the past by absorption rather than rejec- tion" and in his need for popular success. (R.H.L.)

Schr6der, Wolfgang R., "Zum Gebrauch des Beiwortes bei Thomas Mann," Deutschunterricht, 24:88-96, Jan. 1971. Mann typically used adjectives to make his sentences more elaborate. (J.R.R.) Thayer, Terence K., "Hans Castorp's Hermetic Adventures," Germanic Re- view, 46:299-312, Nov. 1971. Not only does the narrator of Der Zau- berberg suggest that Hans Castorp is "hermetic," but the latter is "the natural product of the hermetic temperament and creative enterprise." (R.H.L.) Zmegac, Viktor, "Kulissenwelt: Zu einer Szene bei Thomas Mann," Monats- hefte, 64:136-46, Summer 1972. In Wiilsungenblut, Siegmund and Sieg- linde enjoy a highly ironic perception of Wagner's Die Walkiire. Such satirization of the absurdities of opera-a kind of alienation effect--occurs also in Madame Bovary, in War and Peace, and in Hein- rich Mann's Der Untertan. (R.H.L.) MARISCAL MONTES, JULIO Hernandez, Antonio, "El escritor, al dia," Estafeta Literaria, No. 472:13-5, July 15, 1971. Mariscal Montes is religious without be- ing bigoted.

As a poet and a writer Marrero is satu- rated with Valery, Rilke and H61derlin as well as Hugo von Hofmannsthal. He is nationalistic but not chauvinistic. (T.T.B.) MARTIN, CARLOS Jaramillo Ch., Orlando, "Carlos Martin, poeta, ensayista y escritor," Estafeta Literaria, No. 478:14-7, Oct. 15, 1971. The Colombian writer-lawyer-professor, Martin, is in the classical tradition. In poetry he follows the line of Garcia Lorca, Gerardo Diego and Vicente Aleixandre. (T.T.B.) MARTINEZ DEL CERRO, MIGUEL Murciano, Carlos, "Miguel Martinez del Cerro, un hombre que aprendi6 a tro- var," Estafeta Literaria, No. 475:33-4, Sept. 1, 1971. A poet of great simplicity.

McKAY, CLAUDE Barksdale, Richard K., "Symbolism and Irony in McKay's Home to Harlem," CLA Journal, 15:338-44, March 1972. The racial settings are positive and racially affirming.

MIHURA, MIGUEL Ponce, Fernando, "Miguel Mihura: El hombre y el humor," Estafeta Literaria, No. 476:28-30, Sept. 15, 1971. The humor of this dramatist is in the perfection of the dialogue, the develop- ment of a situation and the treatment. It is marked by sensitivity, sympathy and affection. (T.T.B.) MILLAN, JUAN JOSE2 ALONSO Anonymous, "Los nuevos autores," Es- pafia Hoy, No. 18:61-6, Dec., 1971. Millin's comic theatre has no argument, does not pretend to demonstrate any the- sis or message and is lacking in alcoholics, parricides, nymphomaniacs and black humor. Its value is concentrated in the dialogue. His dramatic theatre represents Christian morality as practiced in conflict with hippy frontiers. (T.T.B.) MOLL, FRANCESC DE BORJA Bonet, Juan, "El escritor, al dia," Estafeta Literaria, No. 475:16-8, Sept. 1, 1971. Biographer of Moss6n Alcover, prize- winning author, Moll is best known as compiler of a Balearic dictionary. (T.T.B.) MORALES, TOMAS Murciano, Carlos, "Tomis Morales. Me- dio siglo despues," Estafeta Literaria, No. 476:6-11, Sept. 15, 1971.

MUSIL, ROBERT Sj6gren, Christine Oertel, "An Inquiry into the Psychological Condition of the Narrator in Musil's 'Tonka'," Monats- hefte, 64:153-61, Summer 1972. "A psychological approach to the narra- tor is a useful preliminary study, for it establishes that his orientation toward reality is basically unsound. Reaching a judgment about N's reliability is decidedly a first step toward interpreting the story according to the author's conception." (R.H.L.) NEIHARDT, JOHN McCluskey, Sally, "Black Elk Speaks: and So Does John Neihardt," Western American Literature, 6:231-42, Winter 1972. Because the story of the Indian mystic Black Elk so dominates the book, many readers have forgotten that Black Elk en- trusted his message to poet John Nei- hardt, "a portal through which his vision could pass to the world." [Preceded by John Neihardt's "The Book That Would Not Die," pp. 227-30, a brief history of Black Elk Speaks.] (W.G.F.) NERUDA, PABLO Alazraki, Jaime, "El surrealismo de Ten- tativa del hombre infinito de Pablo Ne- ruda," Hispanic Review, 40:31-9, Win- ter 1972. Although Neruda's 1925 poetry shows many characteristics of what we now call Surrealism, in fact it corresponds more closely to his well-known and consciously cultivated Romantic temperament. (C.O.) Celaya, Gabriel, "Pablo Neruda," Re- vista de Occidente, No. 106:95-101, Jan. 1972. Neruda is not only the poet of the Third Day of Creation but also the poet of the Third World. (T.T.B.) OJEDA, PINO Murciano, Carlos, "El escritor, al dia," Estafeta Literaria, No. 474:15-7, Aug. 15, 1971. Painter, poet, dramatist, Ojeda is devoted to what some identify as abstract idealism and others as magic realism. She calls it abstract 'impressionism. (T.T.B.) O'NEILL, EUGENE Gillett, Peter J., "O'Neill and the Racial Myths," Twentieth Century Literature, 18:111-20, April 1972. Instead of succumbing to the crudest racial myths, O'Neill "worked his way gradually towards a sympathetic and imaginative presentation of the black American's blackness, towards presenting blackness as a subjective phenomenon."

Novelist and dramatist, Pago D'Arcos is also a poet and essayist. Follower of no literary school, he maintains his indepen- dence, in spite of the prodigious quantity and diversity of his production. (T.T.B.) PALOMINO, ANGEL Rey, Emilio, "Palomino, busqueda de lo humano," Estafeta Literaria, No. 488: 18-21, March 15, 1972. Writer of hundreds of,short stories, hu- morist, novelist, poet, Palomino dates the Spanish humoristic novel from El Quijote and he himself does not worry too much about quality, but about confusion in contemporary life, as he himself has wit- nessed it. (T.T.B.) PARAIN, BRICE Berl, Emmanuel, "Une odeur de s6r6nit6," Nouvelle Revue Frangaise, No. 223:4- 8, July, 1971. Parain's modesty was a manifestation of his humility, his Christianity being as solid as it was reserved. (T.T.B.) Kern, Alfred, "Un puritan dans le do- maine des mots," Nouvelle Revue Fran- Vaise No. 223:13-6, July 1971. In De fil en aiguille one finds a Parain with what has not been said, with dimen- sions of which one guesses only the themes. (T.T.B.) Leyris, Pierre, "Premieres Rencontres avec Brice Parain," Nouvelle Revue Frangaise, No. 223:9-12, July 1971. Parain's meditation on language could finish only with a life entirely occupied in pursuing it and being occupied by it. (T.T.B.) Pascal, Pierre, "Le sage de l'assembl6e," Nouvelle Revue Frangaise, No. 223:17- 22, July, 1971. Although not a Catholic writer or thinker, Parain owed his religious background to his rural childhood. (T.T.B.) Perros, Georges, "Le pain et le vin," Nouvelle Revue Frangaise, No. 223:1- 3, July 1971. Imbued with a culture whose pillars were Plato and Kant, Parain distrusted ordi- nary poetry and, philosophically, was irritated by Heidegger. (T.T.B.) PASSUTH, LASZLO Iglesias Laguna, Antonio, "Laszlo Pas- suth habla de su obra," Estafeta Lite- raria, No. 481:16-8, Dec. 1971. The Hungarian author and translator agrees with Lukics that the historical novel is merely a social novel trans- planted to the past. His own best novels are laid in Transylvania with a Magyar theme. (T.T.B.) PASTERNAK, BORIS Barnes, Christopher J., "Boris Pasternak and Rainer Maria Rilke: Some Missing Links," Forum for Modern Language Studies, 8:61-78, Jan. 1972. "The strand of Rilke's influence running through his work was something of which Pasternak himself was well aware and which he willingly acknowledged." (J.R.R.) Terras, Victor, "'Im Walde'-Goethe and Boris Pasternak," Die Welt der Slaven, 16:283-8, No. 3, 1971. Pasternak's poem "V lesu" was doubtless influenced by the pantheistic Goethe of the Werther period. (J.R.R.) PAULHAN, JEAN Belaval, Yvon, "Jean Paulhan 1884- 1968," Nouvelle Revue Frangaise, No. 228:75-8, Dec. 1971.

(T.T.B.) PAZ, OCTAVIO Fein, John M., "La estructura de 'Piedra de sol'," Revista Iberoamericana, No. 78, Jan.-March 1972, pp. 73-94. An epigraph from Nerval and a structure based on the Aztec calendar of 13 months together outline a cyclic plan of destruc- tion-renovation. The cyclic structure also destroys directionality and makes start- ing and ending points arbitrary.

Four major overlapping periods delimit Paz's poetic evolution from 1935 to 1957: sensual themes, theme of solitude, period of vacillation, and finally communion and solidarity. (A.K.) Pezzoni, Enrique, "Blanco: la respuesta al deseo," Revistalberoamericana, No. 78, Jan.-March 1972, pp. 57-72. Both in its format (fold-out pages, colored inks, typographical arrange- ments) and in its ideology (structuralism in the tradition of Levi-Strauss), Blanco demands much of the reader. (C.O.) PEREC, GEORGES Gollub, Judith, "Georges Perec et la Lit- terature Potentielle," French Review, 45:1098-105, May 1972. La Disparition, a novel totally lacking the letter "e," poses the problem of literary language and innovation. A full realiza- tion of potential literature requires the effort of the reader. (A.K.) PERSE, SAINT-JOHN Little, Roger, "Saint-John Perse and Mu- sic," French Studies, 25:305-13, July 1971. From a deeply felt appreciation of music Perse developed attitudes towards it parallel to those regarding poetry. His approach, like Mallarm6's, was under- standably that of a poet rather than of a musician with a complete technical com- mand of the subject. (T.T.B.)

PIRANDELLO, LUIGI Block, Haskell M., "Some Notes on the Problem of Modern Tragedy," Com- parative Literature Studies, 9:80-4, March 1972. Although tragedy no longer conforms to the classical models, "such elements as the tragic hero still exist," even if, as Pirandello's Enrico IV shows, the con- ception of the hero is modern rather than traditional. (R.O.R. ) POTOK, CHAIM Bluefarb, Sam, "The Head, the Heart and the Conflict of Generations in Chaim Potok's The Chosen," CLA Journal, 14:402-9, June 1971. The novel's conflict functions at several levels; the generational conflict; the tem- peramental; the conflict between the head and the heart; the opposition between a petrified fanaticism and a human toler- ance, and, finally, the split between two visions of God and man's relationship to him. (T.T.B.) POUND, EZRA Haefner, Gerhard, "Zur Wandlung des Imagismus Ezra Pounds," Poetica, 4: 325-32, July 1971.

POWYS, JOHN COWPER Faraggi, Claude, "John Cowper Powys," Nouvelle Revue Frangaise, No. 233: 30-3, May 1972. Powy's faith in imaginative power makes of his novels a sort of stage on which would pass, in their totality, the powers of mineral and vegetable life. (T.T.B.) Fernandez, Diane, "Powys et l'eau de l'inconscient," Nouvelle Revue Fran- Caise, No. 233:34-45, May 1972.

Robertson, Jane, "The Relationship be- tween the Hero and Frangoise in A la recherche du temps perdu," French Studies, 25:437-41, Oct. 1971. Franqoise is complementary to the Hero as a fulfilled artist as well as comprising certain aspects of the author himself, aspects which are not projected onto the Hero. (T.T.B.) Souviron, Jose Maria, "Los cien afios de Marcel Proust," Estafeta Literaria, No. 471:4-9, July 1, 1971. Many friends and acquaintances figure in the pages of En busco del tiempo perdido, such as Gabriel de Yturry, Anatole France, and Charles Haas. (T.T.B.) Tadie, Jean-Yves, "La plume et l'6pee," Nouvelle Revue Franvaise, No. 227: 26-34, Nov. 1971. The extent and precision of Proustian cul- ture are well known but the most ne- glected is that of the military art: the con- versations of the narrator with Saint Loup and his friends at Doncieres, their re- newal in Le Temps retrouv6, which are drawn from Balzac, Feyler, Repington and Bidou. (T.T.B.) Vidal Isern, A., "El Centenario de Marcel Proust," Estafeta Literaria, No. 471: 10-1, July 1, 1971. When Proust praised sickness as a truce with God which eliminated evil desires, he was referring surely to his sexual devi- ations, which caused him atrocious mental suffering. (T.T.B.) REQUENA, JOSE MARIA Ruiz-Copete, Juan de Dios, "El escritor, al dia," Estafeta Literaria, No. 487: 11-3, March 1, 1972. Journalist, winner of the Nadal Prize of 1972, Requena writes neither of bullfight- ing, nor folklore nor costumbrista. He is more like Lera, Hemingway (in El verano sangriento), Fernando Quiiiones and Jose Maria Sanjuan. (T.T.B.) RIMBAUD, ARTHUR Davies, Margaret, "Rimbaud's 'Bonne Pens6e du Matin,' " French Studies, 25: 295-304, July 1971. In Rimbaud's works, Verlaine is a con- stant present to which he is drawn to refer, either directly or allusively, and at times with the intention of reacting against it. (T.T.B.) ROBBE-GRILLET, ALAIN Cohn, Dorrit, "Castles and Anti-Castles, or Kafka and Robbe-Grillet," Novel, 5, No. 1:19-31, Fall 1971. Robbe-Grillet links both Kafka and the New Novel with Flaubert. Kafka moved the novel away from realistic representa- tion and used it to shape his enigmatic vision of the human condition, whereas Robbe-Grillet took these visions as a model for a new realism. (T.T.B.) ROBINSON, EDWIN ARLINGTON Perrine, Laurence, "The Sources of Robin- son's Merlin," American Literature, 44: 313-21, May 1972. The source for the love story in Merlin is not Malory's Morte d'Arthur, but a "twelfth-century French prose romance generally known as the Vulgate Merlin," as summarized in S. Humphreys Gurteen's The Arthurian Epic (1895). (W. G. F.) RODO, JOSE ENRIQUE Pedemonte, Hugo Emilio, "Jose Enrique Rod6 (1871-1971)," Estafeta Literaria, No. 472:4-8, July 15, 1971. Ariel, because of the political circum- stances, made Rod6 famous; Calibdn in- carnates cold utilitarianism, but the book which most correctly classifies Rod6, pre- occupied by the destiny of the Latin-Amer- ican man, is Motivos de Proteo. (T.T.B.) 307</page><page sequence="24">Twentieth Century Literature RODRIGUEZ, CLAUDIO Hernandez, Antonio, "El escritor, al dia," Estafeta Literaria, No. 476:15-7, Sept. 15, 1971. Salamancan poet, former lecturer at Exe- ter, Rodriguez has been influenced by England, as evidenced by his gift for in- toxication, humbleness, condensation and original personal poetry. (T.T.B.) SACHS, NELLY Bahr, Ehrhard, "Shoemaking as a Mystic Symbol in Nelly Sachs' Mystery Play Eli," German Quarterly, 45:480-3, May 1972. Drawing on Jewish mysticism, Nelly Sachs makes the torn sole of an unrepairable shoe symbolize "the destruction of the world by the murderer and the inability of the killer to relate to God, even through his own child." (R.H.L.) Hofmann, Martha, "Die Gedichte der Nelly Sachs," Literatur und Kritik, No. 62:66-9, March 1972. We should not find it surprising that it is difficult to interpret the poems of Nelly Sachs, who did not care for such interpre- tation of poetry. (J.R.R.) SALINAS, PEDRO Cabrera, Vicente, "'Suicidio hacia ar- riba' de Pedro Salinas," Romance Notes, 13:221-5, Winter 1971. The lovers commit suicide because, like Adam and Eve, they belong more to para- dise than to the real world. Death is an affirmation of creation, of eternal love. (A.K.) SARTRE, JEAN-PAUL Doherty, Cyril M., "Opening up the World of Jean-Paul Sartre," Esprit Crdateur, 12, No. 1:61-4, Spring 1972. Joseph McMahon presents the world of Sartre, both chronologically and themat- ically. (T.T.B.) Maanen, W. van, "Kean," Neophilologus, 56:221-30, April 1972. Although Sartre declared that he had fol- lowed Dumas as closely as possible, there are essential differences in their Kean plays. (J.R.R.) Royle, Peter, "The Ontological Signif- icance of Les Mouches," French Stu- dies, 26:42-53, Jan. 1972. The people did not know that Orestes would kill Egisthe but in getting them to recognize him as their king, this son of Agamemnon makes them assume respon- sibility for something they had not willed, and thus delivers them of their flies. (T.T.B.) Uscatescu, Jorge, "Lenguaje, escritura, le- tras," Estafeta Literaria, No. 487:4-8, March 1, 1972. Sartre gives a perfect application of his theory of literature in his work on Flau- bert, which was not at all true of his anal- ysis of Baudelaire and but partially true in a previous book on Genet. (T.T.B.) SCHNITZLER, ARTHUR Driver, Beverley R., "Arthur Schnitzler's Frau Berta Garlan: A Study in Form," Germanic Review, 46:285-98, Nov. 1971. ". in the innumerable passages of nar- rated and inner monologue, Berta's voice appears freest of narrator overtones; yet, on closer examination, it is obvious that even here the narrator is in full control of his bewildered heroine.' (R.H.L.) Favese, Guiseppe, "Arthur Schnitzler alla luce della critica recente," Studii Ger- manici, N.S. 9:234-68, Feb.-June 1971. [A detailed evaluation of various Schnitz- ler studies which appeared during the last half of the 1960's.] (J.R.R.) Krotkoff, Hertha, "Auf den Spuren von Arthur Schnitzlers Traumnovelle," Modern Austrian Literature, 4, No. 4: 37-41, Winter 1971. The beginning of Der Witwer appeared in the Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung December 25, 1894. On the same page is a sketch by Adolph Wilbrant, "Ein Traum," in which occur several features later occurring in Schnitzler's Traumnovelle. (R.H.L.) Reid, Maja D., " 'Andreas Thameyers letz- ter Brief and 'Der letzte Brief eines Literaten': Two Neglected Schnitzler Stories," German Quarterly, 45:443-60, May 1972. "Both letter writers give reasons for their suicides, but these reasons mask their real motives. Thameyer's 'reasons' are all but transparent rationalizations." The initially more plausible "reasons" of the Literat are modified by Schnitzler's autobiographical concept of the figure of Vollbringer. (R.H.L.) 308</page><page sequence="25">Current Bibliography SEGAL, ERICH Spilka, Mark, "Erich Segal as Little Nell, or the Real Meaning of Love Story," Southern Review, 5, No. 1:38-51, March 1972. "Love Story is the working out, through fantasy, of one man's role -confusion which, through sentimental art, has re- leased the generation-bridging tears of modern millions." (S.T.) SINGER, ISAAC BASHEVIS Gottlieb, Elaine, "Singer and Hawthorne: A Prevalence of Satan," The Southern Review, 8, No. 2:359-70, Spring 1972. Hawthorne's Satan is an imagined ten- dency or primitive instinct that arises within man; Singer's Satan is a "power to be contended with, an emissary of evil" that may arise within man or act on him from without. (J.M.D.) SOTO, PEDRO JUAN Boring, P. Z., "Escape from Reality in the Fiction of Pedro Juan Soto," Papers on Language &amp; Literature, 8:287-96, Sum- mer 1972. Characters in Soto's fiction often try to escape their sometimes grotesque circum- stances through illusion and fantasy. In his juxtaposition of external reality and internal fantasy, the author is clearly within the Hispanic literary tradition. (W.K.) SPANISH LITERATURE L6pez Gorge, Jacinto, "La novela espa- fiola y su difusi6n en el mundo," Esta- feta Literaria, No. 488:12-5, March 15, 1972.

(T.T.B.) STEINBECK, JOHN Gribben, John L., "Steinbeck's East of Eden and Milton's Paradise Lost: A Discussion of Timshel," Steinbeck Quarterly, 5:35-43, Spring 1972. While it would be rash to claim a Miltonic influence on Steinbeck, both Paradise Lost and East of Eden are epic in scope and intent and both affirm "the responsibility of every man to stand accountable for his own actions in choosing between right and wrong, good and evil." (W.G.F.) Lieber, Todd M., "Talismanic Patterns in the Novels of John Steinbeck," Amer- ican Literature, 44:262-75, May 1972. "Man's continual need for a talisman," which is "a symbol that one does not know the meaning of and cannot rationally ex- plain, but to which the deeper portion of the mind nevertheless attaches significance and value," is "a recurrent structural pat- tern" in Steinbeck's novels. (W.G.F.) Steele, Joan, "A Century of Idiots: Barn- aby Rudge and Of Mice and Men," Steinbeck Quarterly, 5:8-17, Winter 1972. Dickens' and Steinbeck's portrayals of "an idiot's relationship to society" reveal the authors' social attitudes: Barnaby Rudge is a symbolic character tangential to the main action; Steinbeck's novel depends on the relationship between the idiot and another man. (W.G.F.) SUARtS, ANDRE Liger, Christian, "Suares ou la clart6 am- bigu?," Nouvelle Revue Frangaise, No. 230:55-64, Feb. 1972. The rhetoric with which Suares takes ref- uge against the times turns emptily around frozen images, repetitions of abstract sub- stantives and a constant use of the present indicative and the verb to be. (T.T.B.) SVEVO, ITALO Moloney, Brian, "Psychoanalysis and Irony in La coscienza di Zeno," Modern Language Review, 67:309-18, April 1972. This "was one of the first works to con- sciously make use not only of psychoan- alytic theory but also of the techniques by means of which Freud put these theories into practice for therapeutic purposes." (J.R.R.) TOLLER, ERNST Pittock, Malcolm, "Masse-Mensch and the Tragedy of Revolution," Forum For Modern Language Studies, 8:162-83, April 1972. 309</page><page sequence="26">Twentieth Century Literature Sonia's rejection of violence discourages complacency about violence that may be considered necessary or inevitable and emphasizes Toller's concern that revolu- tion deprives participants of the humanity they may have possessed as politically impotent individuals. (R.O.R.) TOOMER, JEAN Duncan, Bowie, "Jean Toomer's Cane: A Modern Black Oracle," CLA Journal, 15:323-33, March 1972. Cane is like an elaborate jazz composition continuously in process, without a time sequence of past, present or future. The variations on the theme of the relation- ship between the past and present, the ideal and real, are infinite. (T.T.B.) Farrison, W. Edward, "Jean Toomer's Cane Again," CLA Journal, 15:295- 302, March 1972. Cane portrays phases of Negro life in places where those phases had not pre- viously received authentic extensive liter- ary treatment. Toomer learned something of his craft from Sherwood Anderson and Waldo Frank but also from Edgar Lee Masters. (T.T.B.) Innes, Catherine L., "The Unity of Jean Toomer's Cane," CLA Journal, 15:306- 22, March 1972. The symbol is that of the dusk, when the invisible world and the aesthetic realm are most strongly felt. Toomer tied it closely to the theories of P. D. Ouspensky. (T.T.B.) Scruggs, Charles W., "The Mark of Cain and the Redemption of Art: A Study in Theme and Structure of Jean Toomer's Cane," American Literature, 44:276- 91, May 1972. "Americans have tended to mythologize their experience," and white writers have found the myth of Adam useful. "If the dominant culture can make sense out of its experience through the myth of Adam, ... Negroes have used the myth of Cain to explain their own uprootedness ..." (W.G.F.) Watkins, Patricia, "Is There a Unifying Theme in Cane?," CLA Journal, 15: 303-5, March 1972. Throughout Cane, Toomer is saying that man is a creature alone and apart, unable to share and commit himself with another, and after many abortive attempts to so do, he finds that nothing has happened and nothing has changed. He ends as he began - alone and afraid. (T.T.B.) TVARDOVSKY, ALEKSANDR Loepfe, Alfred, "Ein Limmchen aus Schnee," Schweizer Rundschau, 71 : 113- 4, March-April 1972. "Tvardovsky is a lyric poet who unites feeling with intelligence. He also unites naivet6 with an understanding of art." (J.R.R.) UNAMUNO, MIGUEL DE Feal Deibe, Carlos, "Simbolo de renaci- miento en la obra de Unamuno (La 'Oda a Salamanca')," Hispanic Review, 39:395-414, Oct. 1971. Both stylistics and archetypal symbology reveal a vision of rebirth and eternal life through identification/fusion with the city of Salamanca. (C.O.) Franz, Thomas R., "Ancient Rites and the Structure of Unamuno's Amor y peda- gogia," Romance Notes, 13:217-20, Winter 1971. The novel dramatizes a birth-struggle- death-resurrection ritual in the form of Old Comedy. (A.K.) Valdes, Mario J., "Metaphysics and the Novel in Unamuno's Last Decade: 1926-1936," Hispandfila, No. 44:33-44, Jan. 1972. The implicit dualism and the dialectical method of Unamuno's philosophy find ex- pression metaphorically in his literature. Explicit cultivation of symbolism begins around 1917 and culminates with San Manuel Bueno, mdrtir (1933). Not simply mimetic, Unamuno engages the reader di- rectly in philosophical problems. (C.O.) VALERY, PAUL Deguy, Michel, "Deux po6tiques de Val- ery," Nouvelle Revue Frangaise, No. 224:1-6, Aug. 1971. Valery was probably the first writer who, worried about the "science of literature," passed from the poem to reflection on the acts of writing. He finished his life as pro- fessor of poetics, not without relapses and failures in his poems. (T.T.B.) 310</page><page sequence="27">Current Bibliography Oster, Pierre, "'Une tache illimitde,'" Nouvelle Revue Frangaise, No. 224:7- 11, Aug. 1971. The common opinion of Val6ry is that of the ultimate academic poet, superbly clever heir of the old forms, obsolete de- fender of "our illustrious language," - a narrowness of judgment that is ridiculous.

Valembois, Victor, "Valle-Inclain y las disyuntivas del teatro contemporineo," Estafeta Literaria, No. 473:4-8, Aug. 1, 1971. Benavente wrote for the public, Valle- Inclin against it, but in so doing he gave new force to the theatre, attempting to teach something rather than copying what we all live through in life and reproducing it solely for our amusement. (T.T.B.) VARGAS LLOSA, MARIO Klaren, Sara Castro, "Fragmentation and Alienation in La casa verde," MLN, 87:286-99, March 1972. The author uses a fragmented form to help show the alienation felt by the main characters, both from each other and from the world. (A.K.) Matilla Rivas, Alfredo, "Conversaci6n en 'La Catedral': estructura y estrategias," Nueva Narrativa Hispanoamericana, 2: 149-71, Sept. 1972. An annotated scheme of Part I of the novel shows how a multiplicity of tech- nical strategies bring the narrative to a culmination. (C.O.) VIALATTE, ALEXANDRE Dutourd, Jean, "Alexandre Vialatte," Nouvelle Revue Frangaise, No. 224:67- 8, Aug. 1971. Not merely a translator of Kafka, Via- latte, the poet, greatly influenced by Ger- man poetry, was an Auvergnat and very attached to his roots. (T.T.B.) VIAN, BORIS Gerrard, Charlotte Frankel, "Anti-Mili- tarism in Vian's Minor Texts," French Review, 45:1117-24, May 1972. Vian uses Swiftian and Voltairian satire in violently anti-militaristic discussions in En avant la zizigue, "Chronique du men- teur engage," and "Lettre ouverte ' M. Paul Faber conseiller municipal." (A.K.) VINAVER, MICHEL Suther, Judith, D., "The Medium Is Not the Message: Myth in Vinaver's Iphi- genie H6tel," French Review, 45:1106- 16, May 1972. Vinaver abandons the esthetics of repre- sentational art for a cubist interpretation of the myth of Iphigenia. Blind to their past, his characters cannot reconstruct the myth from its shattered parts. (A.K.) WALSER, ROBERT Schneider, Jean-Claude, "Robert Walser (1878-1956)," Nouvelle Revue Fran- raise, No. 229:59-62, Jan. 1972. Much of Walser's work was composed of montages of personal experiences, aphor- istic reflexions, reminiscences and com- mon literary citations without any cohe- sion. Other works are of a fantastic irreal- ism in which dreams play an important part. (T.T.B.)

(W.K.) Quinn, Sister M. Bernetta, O.S.F., "Robert Penn Warren's Promised Land," The Southern Review, 8, No. 2:329-58, Spring 1972. Warren's poetry represents his most re- markable imaginative achievement. An examination of his use of symbols of con- gruence and symbols of necessity reveals the vitality of his profound and ongoing poetic quest. (J.M.D.) WEISS, PETER Maurer, Karl, "Peter Weiss, Marat/Sade - Dichtung und Wirklichkeit," Poetica, 4:361-77, July 1971. A study of the use of history made by the Marxist or quasi-Marxist Weiss proves very revealing. (J.R.R.) Perry, R. C., "Weiss's Der Schatten des K6rpers des Kutschers: A Forerunner of the Nouveau Roman?" Germanic Review, 47:203-19, May 1972. "... we must conclude that to call [this novel] a forerunner of the Nouveau Ro- man is not a very illuminating compari- son. It is rather an isolated experiment of a personal nature, one stage in its author's development to which he never returned ..." (R.H.L.) WELLS, H. G. Steinmann, Theo, "The Second Death of Nunez in 'The Country of the Blind,' " Studies in Short Fiction, 9:157-63, Spring 1972. Nunez dies during his first fall and imag- ines the "episode of the country of the blind" while "rolling down the mountain- side." Thus Wells shows that "essential life is lived in the mind," which "creates its own realities." (R.O.R.) WELTY, EUDORA Moss, Grant, Jr., " 'A Worn Path' Retold," CLA Journal, 15:144-62, Dec. 1971. Wisely, Welty has not attempted to re- produce the exact dialect of the protagon- ist Phoenix but only suggested it and in so doing has freed her readers from the laborious struggle to decipher an unfa- miliar dialect and left the melody and poetry of the prose unbroken. (T.T.B.) Tarbox, Raymond, "Eudora Welty's Fic- tion: The Salvation Theme," American Imago, 29, No. 1:70-91, Spring 1972. Welty's fiction contains a number of "face- breast" images. Invariably the appearance of these images signals the dire need of the hero to be saved. (J.M.D.) WHEELWRIGHT, JOHN Rosenfeld, Alvin H. and Damon S. Foster, "John Wheelwright: New England's Colloquy With the World," The South- ern Review, 8, No. 2:310-28, Spring 1972. Wheelwright (d. 1940) has been long ne- glected as a poet, but he is a "master of metaphysical poetry," as Austin Warren observed, and an important part of the New England tradition in American po- etry.

Reversing the priorities of Plato's dialec- tic, Woolf's "vision of reality is a subject- object relationship in which there is an organic interaction between human con- sciousness and the object being perceived." (S.C.) Rubenstein, Roberta, "Virginia Woolf and the Russian Point of View," Compara- tive Literature Studies, 9:196-206, June 1972. Russian fiction-"formless," indetermi- nate, emotional, and psychologically oriented-significantly influenced Woolf's innovations in the theory and practice of the novel. (R.O.R.) YAlREZ, AGUSTIN Brushwood, John S., "The Lyric Style of Agustin Yfiiez," Symposium, 26:5-14, Spring 1971. Four recurring techniques: (1) repetition, (2) depersonification, (3) series, (4) verb ellipsis, together constitute a "ma- cro-technique" which allows a "compre- hension of reality that photographic de- scription will not provide." (C.O.) Durand Frank, "The Apocalyptic Vision of Al filo del agua," Symposium, 25:333- 46, Winter 1971. Yaifiez's vision of pre-Revolutionary Mex- ico is saturated with the sensation of liv- ing the last days of an epoch. But apo- calyptic prophecy implies renovation also -here, in the Church as well as in society at large. (C.O.) YEATS, WILLIAM BUTLER Rowland, Beryl, "The Other Father in Yeats' 'A Prayer for my Daughter'," Orbis Litterarum, 26:284-90, No. 4, 1971.
