<plain_text><page sequence="1">Prologue at Sinai 81 PROLOGUE AT SINAI by Bernard Horn Bernard Horn teaches American literature, mythology, and technical writing at Framingham State College in Massachu- setts. This essay and one which is appearing in the Spring 1993 Essays in Literature are part of his ongoing study of Numbers, entitled In Wilderness . He has completed a manuscript, Facing the Fires: Conversations with A. B. Yehoshua , and new poems are appearing in The Mississippi Review and in a forthcoming Tel Aviv Review . Just before the golden calf episode in Exodus, God, Yahweh, speaks to Moses: And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying: Speak to the children of Israel, saying: Surely, you must keep my sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations that you may know that I Yahweh have made you holy.1 (31:13) A few verses later, as his first reaction to the golden calf episode, Yahweh speaks again: Yahweh spoke to Moses: Go, descend, for your people whom you have brought up from the land of Egypt have become corrupt. (32:7) "Yahweh spoke to Moses." "Yahweh spoke to Moses." I want to pay attention to these words which occur so frequently we tend to slide over them as we read on and pay attention only to the words that follow. I am not interested for now in the specific content of Yahweh's words but only in their general characteristics and the general readerly reaction to them. 1A11 the translations from the Hebrew are mine (influenced by the JPS version more than the others). When necessary, I sacrifice idiom and grace for literal accuracy.</page><page sequence="2">82 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 I am interested in how readers, both naive and professional, take in each set of Yahweh's words and how that general reaction affects how they respond to the "Yahweh spoke to Moses" clause that introduces the divine words. Most readers, it is safe to say, respond entirely differently to the two verses I quoted. We tend to read the second divine utterance as part of the narrative, with all the complicated emotions and thoughts readers bring to stories. We tend to read the first divine utterance, in contrast, with less emotional engagement, with the disinterest and passivity appropriate to the reading of a body of laws; any interest would be an intellectual or religious interest in the laws themselves, their meaning then or now. We take the second utterance as Yahweh's response to something that hap- pened; we take the second words out of context. In any case, the introduc- tory clause itself, "And Yahweh spoke," does not give us a clue as to how to think of Yahweh. We must first read the content of the speech. Only then can we decide to think of Yahweh as the source of the laws or as a character embedded in the narrative. I believe that all readers make some distinction between such narrative passages and the legal passages. What sets naive readers off from professional readers is what each does with the distinction. On coming across a legal passage that seems to interrupt the flow of the narrative, I would expect some naive readers to roll their eyes, skim the legal passages, and start paying attention again when the story resumes, treating the legal passage as a commercial interruption, a message from the sponsor- of course, for other naive readers this message from the sponsor is of profound religious importance. Professional readers, literary critics or source critics, for example, would bring their special expertise to bear on the disjunction between the two sorts of passages. In this example, source critics ascribe the first utterance (31:13), the one out of context, to P or R, the Priestly Writer or the Redactor, and the second utterance (32:7), the one embedded in the narrative, to J, the Yahwist writer or E, the Elohist. In both cases, readers assume a qualitative difference between the two communications. This distinction between the God of the narrative passages and the god of the legal passages is most relevant to the Book of Numbers, because nowhere else do we find such regular alternation between legal passages</page><page sequence="3">Prologue at Sinai 83 and narrative passages.2 But nowhere is the movement from narrative to law more abrupt than in the golden calf episode of Exodus, and, because of this, it makes sense to think of the golden calf episode and its immedi- ate aftermath as either the paradigm for or the prologue to the Book of Numbers. One of the most delicate and complicated implications of the disjunction between narrative and legal passages is what each suggests about God, both the character of God and the characterization of God- and one reason I chose to translate the Hebrew YHVH as "Yahweh" rather than the traditional and conventional "the Lord" is to open up the possibility of characterization of the deity of the Hebrew scriptures. The name, "Yahweh," partly because of its relative unfamiliarity, opens up the possibilities of characterization in a way that the names "God" and "the Lord" do not. At the very least, it is clear that to write of the characterization of the Yahweh of my second example seems to be a lot more fruitful an activity than to write about the characterization of the Yahweh of my first example. At the very least, the Yahweh of the second verse cares: "Go, descend, for your people whom you have brought up from the land of Egypt have become corrupt." Whatever meaning, allegorical or literal, anthropomorphic or theo- morphic, we may find in this statement, we must somehow assimilate to our notion of the God of the Hebrew scriptures the possibility of divine hurt feelings and divine frustrations. Needless to say, in the turbulent wake of The Book of J, any notion of Yahweh as a character must perforce put me in the company of Harold Bloom, the most exuberant spokesman for treating God this way. Bloom's J's Yahweh is Sublime or "uncanny, " incommensurate yet rather agonistic, curious and lively, humorous yet irascible, and all too capable of sudden violent action. But J's Yahweh is rather heimlich also, he sensibly avoids the walking around in the Near Eastern heat.3 The vitality that characterizes this Yahweh does not, in Bloom's eyes, imply a god who can learn and grow. More changeable than changing, his 2JacobMilgrom, Numbers: TheJPS Commentary (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1990), p. XV.

Like Bloom, I begin from a notion of Yahweh as a character. But the first trait of this Yahweh is freedom, not vitality; he is a being two of whose names, Yahweh itself and 'ebyeh ' asher ' ehyeh ,4 suggest the continuing open-ended process of a being who learns, chooses, changes, and grows. I would ground this approach to characterization in the ' afar and adama of Genesis 2, in the improvising Yahweh who first creates man from dust, then creates a place for him to live, than realizes it is not good for man to be alone, then creates all the animals, and only then comes up with the idea of creating a woman from a rib. Or the God of the Book of Genesis as a whole who gradually withdraws: from Abraham's many heimlich interactions, to Isaac's one interaction (or two if he heard the aqeda call), to Jacob's many encounters- but definitely unheimlich- m dreams and visions of the night, to Joseph's communications only in dreams. Even Robert Alter, who provides the most fulsome critique of Bloom's performance in The Book of J, comes up against the irreducibility of divine characterization. In the first chapter of The World of Biblical Literature , Alter writes: There is little to be gained, I think, by conceiving the Biblical God, as Harold Bloom does, as a human character- petulant, headstrong, arbitrary, impulsive, or whatever. The repeated point of the biblical writers is that we cannot make sense of God in human terms.5 But this principle does not keep Alter, one chapter later, from treating God (or the angel of God) as a character when he faces the immediate exigency of analyzing the interaction among Abraham, Sarah, and the divine actor in the annunciation of the birth of Isaac in Genesis 18:11-13: In my view, the only plausible explanation is that the writer, for all the seriousness of his purpose to render the history of Israel as the history of the beginnings of redemption, was imagining Sarah, Abraham, and the angel ^he English future tense is only an approximate rendering of the Hebrew imperfect tense. The name Yahweh means something like: "He is continuing to be." The other name, "'ehyeh 'asher 'ehyeh, "I will be that I will be" or "I am that I am," is better rendered as "I am continuing to be what I am continuing to be." 'Robert Alter, The World of Biblical Literature (New York: Basic Books, 1992), pp. 22-23.</page><page sequence="5">Prologue at Sinai 85 or the Lord (despite himself?- we shall never know) as characters .6 The issue of Yahweh as a character is central to my argument, and I shall explore its implications in some detail. I am interested in the implications of assuming that all occurrences of "And Yahweh spoke to Moses" are part of the same discourse, and that the legal passages are part of the narrative. How are they part of the narrative? They represent Yahweh's response to the narrative they intrude on. As such, we can think of the legal passages as events in God's mind, and, consequently we can infer from the legal passages and their context what God is thinking. The best way to test these speculations about God as a character in both narrative and legal episodes is by a close analysis of particular passages, and, because of its crucial importance, the golden calf episode is a particularly suitable example. As I proceed with my analysis and seek the coherence of the episode, I am guided by another observation by Alter: If biblical criticism has been guided by the tacit imperative that might be formulated as the more atomistic ; the more scientific , it also needs to be recognized that the atoms were often purposefully assembled by writers into intricate, integrated structures, which are, after all, what we experience as readers and which abundantly deserve scholarly consideration.7 Let me set the scene. It is seven weeks after the departure from Egypt. The people have been camped in the wilderness of Sinai around the base of the mountain for three days. They have been liberated from Egypt and they and the readers have experienced revelation in a multiplicity or montage of theophanies that includes the sublime, the uncanny, and the awesome. First, the sublime: And Mount Sinai was all in smoke because Yahweh came down on it in fire, and the smoke rose like the smoke of a furnace and the whole mountain trembled a lot. And a trumpeting voice grew louder and a lot louder. Moses would speak and God would voice an answer. (19:18-19) Leslie Brisman catches the timely and timeless fullness of the last sentence, when he points out that the Hebrew verbs are in the future imperfect 6Alter, p. 39. For a general discussion of Alter's analysis, see David Damrosch, The Narrative Covenant : Transformations of Genre in the Growth of Biblical Literature (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1987), pp. 299-307, and Alter's rejoinder, pp. 6-7. 7Alter, p. 109.</page><page sequence="6">86 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 tense, and so may be translated as "Moses would speak and God would answer" as well as "Moses will speak and God will answer."8 Second, the uncanny: And Moses and Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up. And they saw the God of Israel, and under His feet was like a sapphire pavement, like the sky itself in purity. And against the leaders of the children of Israel, he did not raise his hand, and they gazed at God and they ate and they drank. (24:9-12) This is the theophany that Harold Bloom calls "the picnic on Sinai."9 Between these extraordinary moments, the people have been overawed by the sound of Yahweh's words in the theophany of the ten commandments, during which they are so frightened, but it is not at all clear that they hear any of the words distinctly. They also have entered into a covenant with Yahweh. "All the words that Yahweh has spoken we will do," they say (24:3). The great sight ( mar'eh ) that Moses saw alone, that bush that burns in fire and is not consumed Ruchat) (3:2-3) has become accessible to the whole people as "the sight (mať eh) of the glory of Yahweh like a consuming (' ochelet ) fire at the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel" (24: 17). 10 Then Moses goes up into the mountain. Forty silent days and nights go by. Seven undramatic chapters of instructions also go by. At the foot of the mountain the children of Israel are worshipping the golden calf. On the top of the mountain Yahweh is about to speak. What I want to pay close attention to is the relationship between Moses and Yahweh as revealed by two conversations in Exodus 32, first, the one between God and Moses and, second, the one between Moses and 8Leslie Brisman, "On the Divine Presence in Exodus," in Modern Critical Interpretations of Exodus, ed. Harold Bloom (New York: Chelsea House, 1987), p. 115. 9Bloom, p. 9. 10These two passages provide a simple illustration of Alter's distinction between atomistic and integrative reading. Critical consensus assigns Exodus 3:2-3 to J and 24:17 to P; see Martin Noth, Exodus : A Commentary (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1962), pp. 34, 200, and Brevard S. Childs, The Book of Exodus: A Critical, Theological Commentary (Philadelphia: Westminster, 197 4), pp. 52, 508. But the two passages are connected through the sort of allusion so characteristic of biblical narrative (see Alter, pp. 107-30). The verbal echoing of two Hebrew roots, ra' oh and ' akhol , makes it clear that the last writer to get his or her hands on the text had enough of a "strong synthesizing imagination" (Alter, p. 7) to nudge careful readers to think back to the burning bush as they read of Sinai.</page><page sequence="7">Prologue at Sinai 87 Aaron. I am interested in what happens to our sense of Moses, Yahweh, and the people, if I treat Yahweh as a character in a story. In the first conversation, both Yahweh's speech and Moses' response are broken into two parts by an unspoken pause, in which the listener is silent, and then the speaker continues. Here is the first part of Yahweh's speech (the emphasis is my own): Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Hurry down, for your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have acted basely. They have quickly turned aside, saru, from the way that I enjoined upon them. They have made themselves a molten calf and bowed low to it and sacrificed to it, saying: 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt!'" (32:7-8) Yahweh has quoted precisely what "they," the people, said in 32:4. Moses is silent. Yahweh continues talking, with a slight modulation: he does not "speak" but only "says." The words Yahweh uses suggest some anticipa- tion that Moses was about to talk back. Yahweh said to Moses, "I see that this people is a stiff-necked people. Now, let me be, that my anger may blaze out, yikbar'api , against them and I will consume them, ' akhalem , and make of you a great nation." (32:9-10) It sounds as if Yahweh's intention is to start all over again with Abraham; the words "great nation, goy gadol " repeat the very first promise to Abraham in Genesis 12:2. Unlike the hot flame of the burning bush, the hot anger of Yahweh is a consuming anger. Yahweh's statement, that the people saru , turned aside, echoes the lovely, "And Yahweh saw that Moses sar , turned aside, to see" the burning bush (3:4), and gives the offer of power to Moses a sharper and more poignant impact.11 Did Yahweh's words about the people turning bring to mind a very different sort of turning by the man standing in front of him, a turning that was the beginning of what Buber describes as "the transformation of the situation into a historical one"?12 Moses makes two arguments in response. Here is the first: But Moses pleaded to the face of Yahweh, his God, saying, "Yahweh, why let your anger blaze out, yekhereb apekha , against your people whom you brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and a strong hand. nTo paraphrase Keats' "Ode to a Nightingale," I can easily imagine Yahweh saying to Moses: Saru / the very word is liķe a bell To toll me back from them to thy sole self! 12Martin Buber, On the Bible: Eighteen Studies (New York: Schocken, 1987), p. 64.</page><page sequence="8">88 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 Why let the Egyptians say, 'It was for evil that he took them out, to kill them in the mountains and annihilate them from the face of the earth.' Turn from your blazing anger, kharon apekba , and let go of the evil intended for your people. (32:11-12) Moses responds to Yahweh's quotation of the people's words, picking up a tone of petulance and jealousy, disappointment and hurt feelings, in Yahweh's voice. As Yahweh turns the people's "your gods" against them, by saying "your people," "you brought out," and "your gods," so Moses turns Yahweh's words against Yahweh when he responds with "your people," "you brought out," and "your people" again. As far as the rest of the words Yahweh quoted, Moses takes up only the last word, "Egypt," cagily ignoring the incriminating content of the quotation. For Moses' appeal to make sense, we must deduce something about Yahweh's tone of voice by Moses' reaction, and we can imagine the fierce divine irony Moses heard when Yahweh quoted the sorry Israelites come to worship a calf: "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt!" At this point in Moses' speech, as there was in Yahweh's speech, there is an implicit pause. Yahweh does not respond to this argument. The what- will-the-Egyptians-think argument clearly makes many commentators, scholars, and critics uncomfortable. A clear indication of this is the way Bloom pounces on it to show his J's ironic treatment of Yahweh: "The best argument her Moses can produce to divert Yahweh from his murderous rage is that the Egyptians will surely rejoice, and we need scarcely brood on a Yahweh who cannot resist such an argument."13 In the text that we have, however, this is not the argument that works, and, in the light of the successful argument that follows, we can hear these words in a different way- as Moses' first clumsy try at reminding Yahweh of Yahweh's better nature: are you the sort of god that annihilates your own people? But Yahweh does not respond to that implication either. So Moses continues, this time taking up the second part of Yahweh's statement, the offer to make Moses a goy gadol , a great nation: Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, how you swore to them by your self and said to them: "I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven, and this whole land that I spoke of, I will give to 13Bloom, p. 259.</page><page sequence="9">Prologue at Sinai 89 your offspring to possess forever."14 (32:13) As Yahweh quoted the Israelites' words against themselves, so Moses quotes Yahweh against Yahweh. Implicitly, Moses rejects the notion of being a new Abraham. This is Exodus we are in, he implies, not Genesis. Remember where we are and what we are about, he seems to be saying. We're in the nation-building stage now. And that's what I know about, building nations, not starting a tribe. It is easy to imagine that Moses is thinking of the brit ben habesarim , the covenant between the meats (Genesis 15:11), in which Yahweh told Abraham about the four hundred years in Egypt, and decides he does not want to go around in circles, that there's no going back to the tribal and mythic beginning of his people. This is clearly an argument by someone who knows whom he is talking to. This Moses is a far cry from Bloom's J's Moses, as is Yahweh from Bloom's J's Yahweh: And Yahweh let go of the evil he had spoke of doing to his people. (32:14) Moses' pitch has worked. In the narrative, the people are again his , that is, Yahweh's, people. Yahweh learns a little more about what it means to be a god of a nation, rather than the god of the chief of a tribe. This first lesson is only negative: when the nation goes wrong, you cannot just start over. But now that Moses has calmed Yahweh down, Moses goes down from the mountain, and the similarity between him and his Yahweh breaks out immediately. Moses has a brief exchange with Joshua, and then: And when he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing Moses became enraged, yikhar af' and he hurled the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the foot of the mountain. (32:19) Moses, unlike Yahweh, has no equal to teach him about leading his people. He is entirely on his own. Joshua does not know what is going on - he cannot even tell the difference between a war song and a party tune. And the conversation with Aaron reveals something awful. It closely parallels the opening gambits of the conversation between Moses and Yahweh and demonstrates the difference between an intimate and 14Childs makes a gesture towards the sort of reading I am engaged in when he argues, "To summarize this appeal under the traditional rabbinic rubric of 'the merits of the Fathers,' as Cassuto does, runs the danger of badly blurring the central issue. Moses' appeal is not to some accumulated deposit of merit which can be tapped, but to the promise of God himself. Moses does not attempt to excuse or mitigate Israel's sin, but he seeks to overcome it by foiling back ultimately on what God can do in making a future possible" (p. 568).</page><page sequence="10">90 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 responsible friendship between equals and an irresponsible friendship between unequals. It also makes clear the extraordinary loneliness of Moses. Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you that you have brought such a great sin upon them?" Aaron said, "Let not my lord's anger bia ze out, yikhar af. You know that this people is evil. And they said to me, 'Make us gods to lead us, for this man Moses, who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what became of him/ And I said to them, 'Whoever has gold, take it ofiV They gave it to me and I hurled it into the fire and out came this calft" (32:21-24) As Yahweh's and Moses' speeches were built on quotations, so too Aaron, at the beginning, precisely quotes what the people had said (32:1), and the yikhar af phrase is with us for a fourth time, exactly echoing the beginning of Moses' first attempt to mollify Yahweh: "Why let your anger blaze out?" Moses' willingness to confront Yahweh directly in the second person, contrasted with Aaron's speaking of Moses in the third person, already intimates both the deceit and the absence of intimacy that is to follow. From then on, all we hear is evasion and deceit. Aaron's blaming of the people for purely self-serving reasons reflects back on Yahweh's blaming of the people in the opening speech. Aaron picks up on Moses' " this people" (the Hebrew word is ze¡ b), echoing Yahweh's contemptuous use of the same phrase in verse 7, as if to say that the people have the same contempt for this Moses as Aaron has for the people. Aaron makes no attempt to help Moses learn to become a better leader, unlike Moses who taught Yahweh how to be a better god. We can imagine any number of responses Aaron may have made. "Listen, brother, next time you're going to be away for such a long time, think about how we will feel while you're gone, and plan accordingly." And so forth. But Moses is on his own, as the next sentence makes clear. Moses saw that the people were out of control- since Aaron had let them get out of control- so that they were a menace to any who might oppose them. (32:25) Aaron's words do not teach him a thing. Moses takes matters into his own hands, just as he had earlier, and then goes back to Yahweh and wins Yahweh's forgiveness, echoing, along the way, Yahweh's and Aaron's derisive "this people," in a tone entirely sad and sympathetic: "And Moses returned to Yahweh and said, 'Oh, this people has sinned a great sin and made themselves a god of gold'" (32:31). The sense of lonely frustration Moses must have felt is reflected in the punning language. The words for control are faruah and firaoh, with the identical letters as Pharoah- as if</page><page sequence="11">Prologue at Sinai 91 Moses is thinking: Here I am, thinking I have gotten them out of Egypt, and what do they do? They pharoah it up with a golden calf as soon as I leave. The sense of Moses' extraordinary isolation and loneliness that comes through here helps explain the power in the delicate and loving maternal intimacy of Yahweh's description in chapter 33 of Moses' private theoph- any in the cleft of the rock: And the Lord said, "See there is a place near me. Station yourself on the rock and, as my presence passes by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock and shield you with my hand until I have passed by. (33:21) In an uncanny way, what Moses reveals by his rhetoric is his friend- ship for Yahweh, the intimacy that is at the heart of the first collective, national theophany: "Moses would speak and Yahweh would voice an answer." By the end of chapter 34, the special closeness has been emphasized in many ways in the details of the language: When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand as he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face was shining because he had been speaking with him. And Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, that the skin of his face was shining, that were afraid to come near him. And Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke with them. Afterward all the children of Israel came near, and he commanded them all that Yahweh had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. And when Moses was finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face, and whenever Moses came in before Yahweh to speak with him, he would take the veil off until he came out, and he would come out and speak to the children of Israel what he had been commanded. And the children of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of his face was shining, and Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went into speak with him. (34:29-35) The intimate expression, daber ' ito , "speaking with him," referring to Moses' conversations, his tête-à-têtes, with Yahweh, is repeated four times in the space of the last six verses ( dabro 'ito, lidaber 'ito, diber 'ito, lidaber 'ito); in the first phrase, it is not even clear who of Moses and Yahweh is the subject and who is object, while the third phrase has Yahweh, rather than Moses, as the subject of the verb 'speak.' Alternating with these conversations between Moses and Yahweh are three conversa- tions in which Moses speaks to, speaks with, and speaks to the children of Israel. This is the Yahweh-Moses relationship described in chapter 33- "Thus Yahweh used to speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a</page><page sequence="12">92 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 friend" (33:11)- and echoed in Numbers 11: "Mouth to mouth, I speak to him and clearly" (11:8). This intimacy and also the kinship between Yahweh and Moses are further underlined by the density of verbal echoes that run through three of the central scenes of Exodus: the burning bush, in which Moses is called, the private theophany in the cleft, and the shining face episode, which is Moses' final appearance in Exodus. No fewer than four different Hebrew roots reverberate through the three scenes and bind Moses to his Yahweh: sary to turn, to remove; partim , face; ra'oh , to see; and yare' , to fear. The first three of these roots are in all three scenes, the fourth only in the first and last. Sar , to turn away, appears twice at the bush ( asura, , sar), once at the cleft ( basarti ), and once at the end (yasir). The face (panav, penai) that Moses hides in fear at the burning bush (3.6) and becomes Yahweh's at the cleft (33:23) yields to a cascade of six references to Moses' shining face in the last six verses of chapter 34. Yare ' shifts from Moses' fear of looking at God at the bush to the people's fear of coming close to Moses at the end. Six variations on ra'oh , to see, at the bush become two at each of the other episodes. Moses has gone from covering his face from fear of seeing Yahweh to covering his face out of consideration of the people's fear of seeing him. Moses' intimacy with Yahweh is such that when he believes Yahweh is doing something wrong, he takes the brave and difficult path of speaking the truth to the being he cares most about, even though the being happens to be Yahweh. Further, of all Yahweh's intimates, it is only Moses, not Jacob or Tamar, not David or Joseph, not Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, or Rebecca: it is only Moses who refuses Yahweh's offer of power and blessing for himself. The danger of this kind of behavior is loneliness, but the reward can be enormous. By the end of chapter 34, the phrase, "Man may not see me and live," applies at first almost as well to Moses shining in his radiance as it does to his best and only friend. But there is more to the final verses of chapter 34 than the special intimacy between Moses and Yahweh. There is a second resolving chord in the last part of chapter 34. The veil, the recurrence of daber , and the imperfect tense of the verbs create an image of the community restored to health. Moses, the leader, is in regular communication with both Yahweh and the people; the only time he does not wear his veil is when he is either speaking to Yahweh or speaking to the people about the things Yahweh has spoken about to him (at the risk of awkwardness, I have tried to preserve the spirit of the Hebrew by using the word "speak" even when more idiomatic English calls for "tell.") From Moses' personal point of</page><page sequence="13">Prologue at Sinai 93 view, wearing the veil when he is not acting as the intermediary between Yahweh's words and the people intensifies the isolation implicit in his interactions with Joshua and Aaron. The community does get over some of the initial fear Moses inspires fairly quickly. But the shining face and the veil make this scene, from the leader's point of view, a sad, if realistic, adjustment to the vision of an ideal community in chapter 33, that vision of harmony and order within the cacophony of the aftermath to the golden calf episode: Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp; he called it the tent of meeting. And everyone who sought Yah weh would go out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp. Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise and stand, each at the entrance of his tent, and watch Moses until he had gone into the tent. When Moses went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and he would speak with Moses. When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would rise and bow down, each at the entrance of his tent. And Yahweh used to speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then he would return to the camp. (33:7-11) Characteristically, Leslie Brisman graceiully evokes the enormous appeal of this "dream of ongoing efficacious Mosaic meditation and a people at ease with an approachable God.15 But by the end of Exodus 34, Moses seems to be paying for his increased intimacy and resemblance to Yahweh with sharply diminished intimacy with his community. From the community's point of view, however, the story takes on a different meaning. It is true that the second vision of community lacks the easy accessibility to Moses and Yahweh of the first. But the image of regular, nearby conversation between Moses and Yahweh and regular conversation between Moses and them has marked practical advantages over terrifying and uncanny theophanies and a leader who is absent for forty days at a time. We can think of this revised way of communicating as the second lesson Yahweh has gleaned from the golden calf episode about becoming the god of a nation: it shifts the ground of connection between Yahweh and the community from Mount Sinai to the tent of meeting in or near the community.16 15Brisman, p. 117. l6Noth observes, "The varied pieces of Ex. 33 are held together by the theme of the presence of God in the midst of his people, which plays some part in all of them" (p. 253). Brisman's essay provides a full and subtle literary approach to the whole issue of God's</page><page sequence="14">94 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 Like the first thing Yahweh learned about being the god of a nation, this lesson too is prompted by Moses. At the end of his second forty days on Sinai, Moses successfully seizes on the special intimacy of the theoph- any in the cleft to press his plea for Yahweh's renewed presence in the camp: If I have indeed won your favor, my lord, would my lord please go in our midst. However stubborn a people they are, please forgive our iniquity and our sin, and take us as your possession. (34:9) Yahweh immediately renews the covenant with neither Moses' participation nor the community's explicit assent. Yahweh is not the only one who is learning. As Yahweh is learning to be the god of a people, so Moses is learning to become the leader of a people. For half of this role, the role of intercessor between the people and Yahweh, Moses has no difficulty. It is a natural extension of what was revealed about his character at the burning bush. If his first word to Yahweh was " Hineni , here I am" (3:4), in his next words he already is arguing: "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and take the children of Israel out of Egypt?" (3:11). It is the second half of his role, as a leader of the people, independent from Yahweh, that Moses must learn about. He must learn to make decisions on his own, not to keep running to Yahweh for advice. By the end of Chapter 32, Moses has learned something about independent leadership. He has taken three direct actions on his own. In the first, he shatters the tablets in a fit of rage. In the second, just before his conversation with Aaron, he takes immediate and forceful action to halt the idolatry. "And he took the calf they had made, and burned it in fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it on water, and made the children of Israel drink it" (32:20). In the third, he asks for volunteers and commissions the Levites, who are the only ones who "gather themselves around him" (32:26), to execute the offending golden calf worshippers (32:26-28). The very phrase he uses to call for volunteers suggests his sense of urgency by its extraordinary compression: "Who is for Yahweh to me!" (just three words in Hebrew). The first action is spontaneous and personal, the second is spontaneous and collective, while the third has long-term institutional implications. In this third action, Moses absorbs Yahweh's authority without any prior authorization: "Thus says Yahweh, the god of Israel" (32:27) are the first words of his charge to the Levites. presence in Exodus.</page><page sequence="15">Prologue at Sinai 95 This is the very first time Moses or Yahweh refer to Yahweh as "the god of Israel"; in Egypt Yahweh is "the god of the Hebrews." Only in the picnic on Sinai does "the god of Israel" make an appearance (24:10). The narrative of the golden calf ends with the image of Moses deep in conversation with Yahweh, his unveiled face shining. This account is also the last narrative in the Book of Exodus. What follows is six undramat- ic chapters in which the Israelites execute the seven chapters of tabernacle instructions that precede the golden calf episode . . . except, that is, for two verses. As an expanded version of the sabbath command (31:12-17)- with emphasis on the sabbath as "sign" and "covenant"- immediately precedes the golden calf, separating the tabernacle instructions from the golden calf, so a shortened version of the sabbath command separates the golden calf episode from the execution of the instructions: Work may be done for six days, and the seventh day you are to keep as a holy sabbath of solemn rest for Yahweh. Whoever does any work on that day is to be put to death. Wherever you live, do not light a fìre on the sabbath day. (35:2-3) One way to think of all thirteen of these chapters is as a kind of priestly wall to isolate the golden calf from the rest of the Torah, six packed chapters on one side, seven packed chapters on the other, as if the golden calf would contaminate or infect with idolatry any narrative it got too close to. This makes a lot of sense as an explanation for the tabernacle material. But I think it is possible to view the sabbath command a little differently, if we think of its connection with the image of a healthy community that precedes it. Unlike the pre-calf passage, which comes as "Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying" (31:12), the post-calf passage reflects the intensified closeness between Moses and his Yahweh: "And Moses gathered the whole community of the children of Israel and said to them: These are the things, devarim , Yahweh commanded to do" (35:1). Yahweh's first lesson during the golden calf episode is one sort of temporal lesson, that you cannot start all over every time the nation breaks the covenant. Yahweh's second lesson is the spatial lesson that it is better that Yahweh and Moses speak to each other in or near the community, not on Mount Sinai, making interaction with Yahweh, not theophany, an everyday part of their way of life. We may think of the sabbath commandment as a third lesson, a temporal parallel to the second lesson. Keeping the sabbath provides another institutionalizing of Yahweh's presence into the way of life of the community. Holy to Yahweh and coming each and every week, it is not too farfetched to imagine Yahweh</page><page sequence="16">96 SHOFAR Winter 1993 Vol. 11, No. 2 (or Moses and Yahweh) thinking of sabbath as a way to anticipate and ward off the desperate urgings for holiness and for God's immediate presence that could lead to the golden calf. We can think of this lesson as an implication that Yahweh saw in Moses' request that Yahweh "go in our company," but it is certainly hard to imagine that Moses was thinking of anything beyond Yahweh's presence in the camp; physical and spatial presence is on Moses' mind, not something temporal and spiritual. It seems plausible, then, that adding a law to the narrative is Yahweh's idea more than Moses'- although there is no way of ruling out the possibility that it was Moses who came up with the inspired idea to repeat the sabbath commandment here.17 One effect of thinking about the sabbath in this way is that this commandment to keep the laws of sabbath becomes the last step or the epilogue to the golden calf story, and thus becomes part of the narrative, rather than part of the execution of the laws of the tabernacle. This suggests the more general possibility of thinking of the laws not as an alternative mode to narrative, but as an event, a mental event- in Yahweh's mind or in Moses' mind- within the narrative.18 17I am, of course, indebted to Abraham Heschel, The Sabbath (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1975), for this analysis. 18Much of the substance of this essay was made possible by a 1991 NEH Summer Seminar, "The Bible as Literature. " I wish to acknowledge the support of the remarkable collection of individuals who took part in the seminar, particularly Leslie Brisman, the seminar director.</page></plain_text>
