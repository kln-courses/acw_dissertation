Further, German understanding of Hendrik Lorentz's work in the 1890s was incomplete, and even after Hertz's theoretical papers were published there were many problems in grasping how to manipulate field equations. The authors only occasionally hint at the difficulties in linking energy considerations to elec- trodynamics that were rampant during the 1850s to 1870s. But these objections are altogether minor, given the magnitude and nature of the task Jungnickel and McCormmach set themselves. They never intended to produce a comprehensive study of theory and experiment; instead, their work provides a base from which a specialized study should begin, a portrait of the interlocking pattern of the methods and goals of German physicists. The two volumes of Intellectual Mastery must be read by all historians of physics, and they should be read by historians of science-and indeed by historians in general -for the model they provide in linking the intellectual and institutional history of a discipline.

In celebration of the centenary of Charles Darwin's death, the Florence Center of the History and Philosophy of Science sponsored a historical conference orga- nized by David Kohn. The proceedings, consisting of thirty-one articles and commentaries, constitute a valuable overview of current knowledge about Dar- win. The essays concentrate on four topics: the growth of Darwin's ideas, the Victorian context of his thinking, the international reception of his theory of evolution, and the overall historical significance of his accomplishments. The selection is fairly well balanced, though attention to Darwin's career following the appearance of On the Origin of Species (1859) is modest: only one essay discusses any of Darwin's extensive botanical research from that period. This neglect of botany relates more to shortcomings in the state of current Darwin scholarship than to editorial oversights by Kohn, for the volume is indeed reflec- tive of today's research. Serious students of Darwin will want to use it as their first point of departure. Perhaps the most obvious fruit of the research displayed in this book has been a stronger awareness of the continuities of Darwin's life and career-an aware- ness that has grown directly from work in manuscripts. The wealth of surviving records has allowed scholars to trace the course of Darwin's thinking in great detail, encouraging a sort of historical uniformitarianism. Researchers almost take it for granted that all Darwin's major concepts grew gradually, appearing not as complete and perfect inspirations but as the result of extended testing and 249</page><page sequence="2">ESSAY REVIEWS-ISIS, 78: 2: 292 (1987) revision. Whiggism is out; authors frequently depict the young Darwin venturing down blind alleys in pursuit of false or trivial leads. Yet Darwin also seems to have retained numerous vestiges of his early ideas and interests in his later work. Howard Gruber gets the discussion off to an awkward start by exaggerating the purposeful nature of Darwin's early research to a degree that seems whiggish and ahistorical, but the remaining essays are better balanced. Phillip Sloan shows that Darwin had pursued significant questions about invertebrates ever since his Edinburgh student days, well before his work on barnacles. Frank Sulloway has illuminated Darwin's intellectual growth during the Beagle voyage by applying quantitative content analysis to his correspondence with J. S. Henslow. Stan Rachootin explains that Darwin was converted to transmutation at least in part by a misinterpretation of fossil evidence that he corrected only reluctantly after Richard Owen pointed it out. M. J. S. Hodge and David Kohn trace the complex path by which Darwin reached the ideas of natural selection; Kohn further looks at divergence, and Hodge considers generation. The continuity emphasized by these authors relates closely to a second theme: Darwin's intellectual pluralism. Though reading Thomas Malthus inspired Dar- win with the idea of natural selection that dominated his evolutionary thought, Darwin not only continued to rely on some of his pre-Malthusian ideas but went on to develop further alternatives to natural selection as well. Use and disuse, associationism, correlation, and sexual selection all assumed a place in uneasy balance with natural selection. Richard Burkhardt and Janet Browne emphasize the continued importance of Darwin's Lamarckism and his associationist theo- ries of behavior. In the same spirit, Malcolm Kottler depicts Darwin defend- ing sexual selection against the more consistently adaptationist Alfred Russel Wallace. No issue raised in this book seems to have caused as much difficulty for the participants as the social context of Darwinism. Robert Young vehemently in- sists that Darwin's biology was one with a progressive-minded Malthusianism. Silvan Schweber also recognizes close ties between Darwinian evolution and British political economists, pointing especially to Adam Smith. However, the connection between Darwin's science and his social background is not a simple one. Ernst Mayr wonders how an idea as poorly received as natural selection can really be said to reflect an important social interest, and James R. Moore finds a fascinating contradiction between Darwin's radical theories and his very tradi- tional lifestyle as a "squarson-naturalist." The complications increase when one begins to consider the reception of Dar- winism internationally. I. B. Cohen and Peter Bowler consider the reception of Darwin's work in Great Britain. Bowler also looks at this reception in America, where he finds students of Louis Agassiz erecting a non-Darwinian school of evolution. Pietro Corsi, Paul Weindling, Francesco Scudo, and Michele Acanfora find numerous continental Europeans inclined toward evolutionary naturalism- but not necessarily toward selectionism. In the nineteenth century selectionism seems to have had few friends outside Great Britain. The notion of selection met with varying degrees of skepticism, not only from the religious but also from the politically radical, especially in Russia. In retrospect this revulsion against the theory of Darwin and Wallace seems extraordinary: market economics prevailed in varying degrees in every developed country in the world, yet people of every political stripe found it distasteful to attribute analogous mechanisms to nature. People accustomed to the daily bargaining of the commercial world suddenly turned reverent when contemplating the birds of the air and the beasts of the field. It is hard to imagine a more revealing symptom of the moral ambivalence with which people regarded their social arrangements, and despite our frequent 250</page><page sequence="3">MONTGOMERY ON KOHN discussion of the social context of Darwinism, it is clear that we are only begin- ning to plumb its full curiosity. One reason we have difficulty in comprehending Darwinism's social features is the timelessness with which we approach the issue. We want to assess the ideo- logical significance of Darwinism today; thus, in considering the past, we usually trouble ourselves only with those features of the theory that still have vitality. In this volume Ernst Mayr sets out to identify five salient theories of evolution, the bare-bones substance of Darwinism. He clearly sees these theories as pure intel- lectual constructs, with no necessary implications for social ideology; yet Robert Young's social interpretation of Darwinism works largely with the same five ideas. Nor does it appear that Young would have any real difficulty with the philosophical analyses of Darwinian concepts by John Beatty and Elliott Sober. (By the way, Sober gives the best reply I have seen to the charge that "the survival of the fittest" is a tautology.) The scientist, the philosopher, and the theorist of ideology obviously have more in common than one might necessarily have expected-indeed, perhaps more than they ought to have. If we are ever to analyze successfully the social implications of Victorian Darwinism, we must be less choosy about what we intend to include under that heading. John Durant has done this volume a major service by confronting the anthropomorphic elements of Descent of Man. Clearly Darwin's reading of human models into nature in- volved more than Victorian political economy; yet we will never get a full grasp on these tendencies so long as we hold to modern definitions of Darwinism. Of course, the industrial capitalist order constituted Darwin's environment only in the most general sense. Other writers remind us that Darwin also func- tioned within the more immediate context of multiple interrelated scientific net- works. Duncan Porter describes Darwin's Beagle collections and the scientists who described them; Sandra Herbert relates Darwin's work to that of his geologi- cal colleagues; James Secord does the same for Darwin and the breeders; and Gillian Beer evaluates Darwin as a general reader. Indeed, David Hull concludes that the phenomenon of Darwinism is simply too variable to pin down by any clear-cut intellectual definition, arguing that it can only be identified with the social continuity between groups of people who thought of themselves as Dar- win's friends and supporters. William Provine's history of twentieth-century evolutionary thought in Great Britain and the United States tends to follow the same approach, indicating that personal alliances in the name of Darwinism have risen and declined while major controversies have remained unresolved. The ghost of Lewis Namier now haunts Darwin studies. Does this spirit bring us a useful message from beyond, or is he merely going to make a lot of noise and upset the furniture? We should remember that Robert Young's interpretation of Darwinism basically derives from a scholarly tradition in the history of ideas and upholds the primacy of intellectual issues in studying science. By contrast, the newer social interpretations direct our attention away from ideas entirely to focus on personal relations and the day-to-day practice of research. In fact, Hull's formidable nominalism would virtually rule out a history of ideas (though not necessarily an intellectual history). We study Darwin, above all, because of his ideas, and I would pot feel comfortable with an interpretation of his work that gave primacy to anything else; nevertheless, I would also remain dissatisfied with a history of Darwin and Darwinism that never got beyond ideas. As Moore has cogently demonstrated, there is more to Charles Darwin than is dreamt of in the intellectual history of science. Antonello La Vergata has contributed to the volume a masterful review of the Darwin literature from the past thirty years. The historical methods he recom- mends appear frequently in the volume itself; indeed, at points his review reads 251</page><page sequence="4">252 ESSAY REVIEWS-ISIS, 78: 2: 292 (1987) uncomfortably like an official encomium, and he sometimes unfairly deprecates the work of older scholars. Still, I fully agree with him: the book is admirable. Aside from the neglect of botany, it gives a good account of Darwin's ideas and professional career. It showcases or summarizes some of the best recent re- search in the field. It lays new emphasis on the gradual, step-by-step growth of Darwin's ideas and the variegated pluralism of his thought. It raises anew the important questions of his relationship to the Victorian social environment and to overlapping circles of friends and colleagues. It sketches in the reception of his ideas and thoughtfully evaluates his enduring legacy to biology. Although not every issue is resolved, the variety of opinion contributes to a discriminating picture of a man who has too often been viewed in simplistic fashion. In Dar- win's case, portraiture by committee may be just what we need.
