<plain_text><page sequence="1">Edinburgh, Fruitmarket Gallery Max Ernst's sculpture In many ways, bronze sculpture and Surrealism are uneasy bedfellows. Every- thing the Surrealists stood for - the ex- pression of the unconscious through auto- matism, the creation of fantastic dream- like worlds, the promotion of the irrational - were objectives suited to painting, collage and assemblage rather than to the inert medium of bronze. Making sculptures in plaster and then casting them in numbered, limited editions (as Ernst was to do) seems very much at odds with the spirit of sub- version. The objet trouvi offered a more poetic and magical appeal, elevating the ordinary into the bizarre in one deft move. The assemblage made a limitless range of enigmatic 'encounters' possible, simply by bringing unrelated objects together, as if on that famous dissecting table. Certainly, Giacometti, Picasso and Arp were successful in creating bronze sculptures, but whether much of their work in this medium can properly be called 'Surrealist' is another matter. Late bronzes by Dali, de Chirico and Magritte, are essentially three dimen- sional transpositions of painted images, analogous to poorly delivered jokes, lack- ing subtlety, nuance and spontaneity.

The Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh). structions in 1919 when he was associated with the Dada group in Cologne, and dur- ing the same period produced at least one free-standing object composed of found metal objects tied together with string. Nearly all the constructions of this date are now lost. His activities as a sculptor began in earnest only in 1934 when he spent the summer with Giacometti in Switzerland. On his return to Paris, he took a studio close to Giacometti's and began making sculptures from plaster casts of household objects, such as flowerpots and bowls. The elements were balanced precariously, one on top of the other, to create anthropomorphic figures, and with a few exceptions this was the technique he used up to his death in 1976 (Fig.64). These sculptures were little known until the mid-1950s, when Ernst began making bronze casts after the plaster originals. The exhibition (at the Fruitmarket Gallery, closed 23rd September) reunited nearly all Ernst's sculpture, featuring sixty bronzes and a comprehensive selection of small gold and silver items dating mainly from the last years of his life. The bulk of the works were lent by The Capricorn Trust, established by the artist's widow, Dorothea Tanning. There were about half a dozen works from the mid-1930s and the same number from the mid-1940s. The concrete reliefs Ernst executed at his home in Arizona in 1948 were exhibited as bronze casts (manufactured in 1968) and the remaining pieces dated principally from the late 1950s and 1960s. Never before had such a complete range of his sculptural euvre been shown, and indeed, outside the Menil collection in Houston, one seldom has the opportunity to see much of his sculpture at all. The beautifully lit and installed exhibition, therefore, offered a welcome opportunity to assess a largely unknown aspect of an otherwise very well- known body of works. What was immedi- ately surprising was how many of the bronzes looked familiar, even though the majority are rarely illustrated. Due to the fact that Ernst repeated a very particular (and rather limited) technique in making his sculptures, there is no significant dif- ference between the early and later works. This is disappointing in an artist otherwise so committed to technical innovation. His assemblage technique has affinities with collage, but it must be admitted that the dark humour and sheer range of expression found in collage series such as Une semaine de bonti is absent. Furthermore, since the bronze casts all date from the 1950s or later, the patinas and surface textures are comparatively uniform. Familiarity with one sculpture permits familiarity with them all. Each work demands the same level of engagement as the next, each emits roughly the same signal - a mixture of whimsy and oddity. Ernst had no illusions about this. In an interview with Patrick Waldberg he announced with refreshing candour: 'Painting is like chess: you have to give your whole mind to it. You live in a state of concentration that is almost un- bearable. But with sculpture I can relax. I enjoy it, the way that I enjoyed making sandcastles on the beach when I was a boy'. These contrasting approaches are clearly reflected in the finished products. A handful of the sculptures strike a dif- ferent note. The King playing with the Queen of 1944 and the enormous Capricorn group of 1948 have something of the sinister quality found in Ernst's paintings. Two later works, Are you Niniche? and A microbe seen through a temperament are constructed from wooden farmyard equipment, but were exhibited as bronze casts. The 1939 Tannhauser, a bronze lion's head fixed to a long wooden fork, was the simplest of all, and because of this was among the most memorable. It appears that the major Max Ernst centenary exhibition planned for the Tate Gallery next year (and touring to Stuttgart and Diisseldorf) will feature only about six sculptures. Although it is a pleasure to view sixty, six well-chosen pieces will probably be quite sufficient. PATRICK ELLIOTT Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art 'Max Ernst: The Sculpture.
