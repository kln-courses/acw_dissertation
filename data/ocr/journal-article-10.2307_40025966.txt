<plain_text><page sequence="1">MYSTICISM, THE NUMINOUS, AND THE MORAL Wayne Proudfoot ABSTRACT Two religious interpretations of experience, the mystical and the numinous, are presented. Two constructions of each are explored, one involving a sense of immediacy which obviates the possibility of ethical judgment, and the other providing a leverage which allows ethical criteria. The author suggests a third interpretation, emphasizing the social character of experience, which is more comprehensive than the first two and correlates better with our experience of moral claims. Danto (1972) has posed the question of the relation of oriental thought and moral philosophy in terms of the relations that obtain between moral attitudes and factual beliefs. As he notes, twentieth century discussions of philosophical ethics have focused on this issue. The attention of moral philosophers since Moore has been directed toward the problem of describing or prescribing the nature of the gaps between moral and descriptive terms and between moral propositions and nonmoral ones. Danto argues that moral propositions presuppose, as conditions of their applicability, certain factual beliefs. If these beliefs are false, then the moral propositions which presuppose them are inapplicable, regardless of whether or not it is appropriate to speak of them as true or false. Many of the factual beliefs of the orient, he maintains, are "too alien to our representation of the world to be grafted onto it, and in consequence their moral systems are unavailable to us" (Danto, 1972:x-xi). This is particularly true of factual beliefs that are JRE 4/1 (1976), 3-28</page><page sequence="2">PROUDFOOT associated with mystical views of the world and that thus threaten to collapse the space that makes morality possible. For this reason, Danto suggests that the "mysticism and morality" of his title may well signify incompatible terms. In this essay I want to suggest that it may be more appropriate to view mysticism as one of several ways of conceiving the relation between moral attitudes and factual beliefs than to view it in direct opposition to morality. I also want to argue that religious beliefs, attitudes and practices have traditionally been addressed to precisely this issue of the relation between factual beliefs and moral attitudes. A chief function of religious symbol systems in all cultures has been the creation and maintenance of this relation. Differences between systems of religious symbols and interpretations of religious experience may profitably be viewed as reflecting diverse answers to the question of the relation between the prescriptive and the descriptive. In the first section below, a view of the function of religious symbols in constructing the relation between the prescriptive and the descriptive is set forth. Two types of interpretation of religious experience are then elaborated and are evaluated as to their adequacy in accounting for the experience of moral claims, and, in the final section, a third interpretation of religious experience is proposed. It is argued that this third interpretation provides a superior account of moral claims and is capable of comprehending the particular aspects of experience that gave rise to the first two types. 1. Religion as a Construction of the Relation between Mythos and Ethos. The proposal to understand religion as a way of relating moral to factual beliefs is not a new one. A similar theme is present in the work of Kant and in much nineteenth century writing on religion. In the social sciences, it is especially prominent in the work of Max Weber and his students. A particularly graphic and influential formulation of this way of viewing religion has been given by Geertz (1968:97): The heart of this way of looking at the world, that is, of the religious perspective, is, so I would like to argue, not the theory that beyond the visible world there lies an invisible one (though most religious men have indeed held, with differing degrees of sophistication, to some such theory); not the doctrine that a divine presence broods over the world (though, in an extraordinary variety of forms, from animism to monotheism, that too has been a rather popular idea); not even the more diffident opinion that there are things in heaven and earth undreamt of in our philosophies. Rather, it is the conviction thatthe values one holds are grounded in the inherent structure of reality, that between the way one ought to live and jhe way things really are there is an unbreakable inner connection. What sacred symbols do for those to whom they are sacred is to formulate an image of the world's construction and a program for human conduct that are mere reflexes of one another.</page><page sequence="3">MYSTICISM, THE NUMINOUS, AND THE MORAL 5 In anthropology, it has become customary to refer to the collections of notions a people has of how reality is at base put together as their world view. Their general style of life, the way they do things and would like to see things done, we usually call their ethos. It is the office of religious symbols, then, to link these in such a way that they mutually confirm one another. Such symbols render the world view believable and the ethos justifiable, and they do it by invoking each in support of the other. The world view is believable because the ethos, which grows out of it, is felt to be authoritative; the ethos is justifiable because the world view, upon which it rests, is held to be true. Seen from the outside, this sort of hanging a picture from a nail driven into its frame appears as a kind of sleight of hand. Seen from inside, it appears as a simple fact. There are problems with this way of looking at the world. It may suggest a relativism common among cultural anthropologists that should not be translated too quickly into philosophical terms. But Geertz is addressing the issue of the relation between the prescriptive and the descriptive. The introduction of this perspective suggests that attention should be directed, in the first instance, not to the relation between religion and morality, but to the role of religion in symbolizing and dramatizing the relation between moral attitudes and factual beliefs. By "religious symbol system" I mean to include not only linguistic symbols, icons, other artifacts and natural objects that are set apart as sacred, but also symbolic actions (e.g. sacrifice, worship, initiation rites) and institutions (e.g. cult, sangha, church). Religious symbols serve at once as frames of perception or maps (description) and as action guides or programs (prescription). An image of a holy man in a particular tradition, for instance, is both descriptive and prescriptive. The Exodus as a religious event that was formative of the memory of the people of Israel is understood both as a statement about the way the world is and as a guide for action. Religious images serve both descriptive and prescriptive functions. Human existence is cruciform, the world is like a burning house, samsara is nirvana, dharma is the order of the world, Jesus is the Logos, and of the kingdom of David there shall be no end. If one attempts to differentiate descriptive and prescriptive uses of language, it is not clear what is to be done with many religious symbols and claims. Each of the examples cited above serves to hold the two tasks together. Religious creeds typically involve factual claims about the world as well as commitment that implicitly or explicitly includes guides for action. Danto has argued that moral attitudes are dependent for their applicability on factual beliefs, and that therefore the gap between them is not unbridgeable. But the dependence may be mutual. The criteria for what is accorded the status of a fact may be partially dependent upon particular programs for action. Public criteria for what is to qualify as a fact may be capable of stricter definition than those available for the evaluation of moral attitudes, but the distinctions are difficult to draw</page><page sequence="4">PROUDFOOT precisely. As Geertz says, when seen from the inside, a particular religious construction of the relation between ethos and world view may appear as a simple fact. Religious symbols, doctrines and practices function to correlate the descriptive and the prescriptive and to fuse them in a particular construction of the world that is also a program for action. For instance, questions formulated in philosophical ethics are often couched in terms that suggest factual givens, but that P1^ depend for thejr applicability and their meaning on moral attitude? anc' Part'cu'ar Action programs.

When is an organism to be treated as a person dnu aCCOm^u me rights and moral respect due to all persons? The borderline cases, at the terminal points of life and in anomalous instances, are well known. Attention must be directed both to the descriptive and prescriptive issues in the fixing of boundaries and to the ways in which they condition one another. In such discussions, "person" functions as a kind of sacred symbol that is shared by members of our culture, and that forms a link between descriptive and prescriptive functions. The contrast between mysticism and morality suggests a popular contrast between oriental and occidental cultures. It might be more profitable to examine different religious interpretations of reality that initially appear to parallel this contrast, though they are not restricted to particular traditions. Two types of religious experience, or of religious interpretations of experience, will be examined. Each of these interpretations includes distinctive claims about the nature of the world as well as correlative programs for ethical judgment and action. In each case, it will be shown that a tendency toward the celebration of immediacy in the relation between the subject and the religious object leads to a construction that obviates the possibility of doing ethics. It is possible, however, to reconstruct each case in such a way as to provide leverage for ethical criteria and judgment. Through an examination of these types it may be possible to shed some light on the relation between religion and morality and to lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive interpretation of religious experience. 2. Mystical and Numinous Interpretations of Experience. Reference will be made to mystical and numinous interpretations of experience rather than to different types of religious experience. This allows stress to be placed on the process of interpretation or labelling</page><page sequence="5">MYSTICISM, THE NUMINOUS, AND THE MORAL 7 that is often ignored by those who claim to describe different types of religious experience. Zaehner (1957), for instance, has developed a typology of mystical experience, and Smart (1965) has suggested that these types might better be viewed as different interpretations of experiences that are fundamentally the same. Shaver and I (1975) have cited numerous empirical studies that suggest the fundamental role of interpretation, labeling, or attribution in the construction of religious experience. The terms "mystical" and "numinous" are adapted from Smart's (1959) discussion of strands of religious doctrine, but are employed here in a somewhat different manner. 2.1 The Mystical Type. Much has been written on the richness of the varieties of mystical experience and on the distortions incumbent on the identification of mysticism with a monistic metaphysic. It is certainly true that a number of very different reports and claims are often labelled "mystical." In spite of warnings against too simple a characterization, however, it seems to me that the chief characteristic of the mystical perspective is that of the overcoming of boundaries and the dissolution of distinctions. A common element in reports of mystical experience is the sense of unity with all there is and the realization that what previously seemed to be boundaries, distinctions and distances are illusory, penultimate, or in some way finally unreal. A sense of underlying oneness preempts the empirical multiplicity. The mystical strand of religious experience is often associated with the orient, but it informs, of course, a substantial stream of western religiousness as well. Even in traditions where it is not dominant, the mystical sense of the transcendence of all boundaries and the experience of the undifferentiated unity of the whole is implied in many sets of religious symbols and doctrines. The strand portrayed here is a kind of ideal type that may never be found in its pure unalloyed form, but that is characteristic of many interpretations of religious experience. If the chief characteristic of the mystical attitude is the dissolution of all distinctions, then the world view with which it is correlated would tend toward monism. The set of descriptive statements about the world that arises from a mystical interpretation of experience or that gives rise to such an interpretation would be one in which distinctions and boundaries are judged to be finally illusory. In such a conception the fundamental metaphysical unit is the whole, whether conceived as being or substance, or as emptiness. The finite individual has no integrity of its own, but gains significance as part of the whole in which it participates. Often the finite individual is portrayed as participating in, but as ignorant or estranged from, its source or ground to which it longs to return.</page><page sequence="6">8 PROUDFOOT Salvation, the vision of God, the attainment of the summum bonum, or nirvana are goals that may suggest the return of the individual to the whole and the overcoming of estrangement, or the recognition of purported boundaries and distinctions as illusory. Momentary union with the cosmos or realization of the unity of all things may be achieved in the ecstatic or contemplative moment of the mystic. Such ecstasy as experience affords is conceived as eternal, as free from the temporal flux. Temporality is identified with the illusions of finite existence. The obliteration or transcendence of all distinctions in favor of a monistic unity can be seen in different forms in the Neoplatonic tradition of early Christian mysticism, in the writings of a contemporary like Paul Tillich, and in the advaita vedanta, or nondualistic vedanta, of Shankara. Though the point is often made that the latter is nondualism rather than monism, the monistic implications seem clear.1 Knowledge in such a context is generally conceived as participation so that the order of knowing is assimilated to the order of being. It may be, as in the case of some Christian mystical traditions, that the self is assimilated to and finds its home and rest in God. Or it may be, as in the case of some oriental traditions, that reality is all assimilated to the self, and that all else is illusory. To know something is to participate in the being of that thing. An implication of this conflation of the orders of knowing and being is that knowledge at distance is not possible, a position consistent with the elimination of all boundaries and distances. Danto has drawn attention to the implications of such a view for the understanding of conversion or transformation. A transformation of oneself, and thus of the manner in which one views the world, is equivalent to a transformation of the world. There is no clear distinction between that which is known and the knowing of it. Salvation is effected by the attainment of knowledge, specifically the knowledge that that from which one sought release is illusion. What are the implications of this mystical and monistic conception for ethical reflection? The most natural construction is one that collapses the distinctions and eliminates the distance or space that ethics demands. This construction arises from the immediacy that is central to the mystical interpretation of experience and to the world view out of which it arises. A second construction may be possible, however, in which the concept and the experience of comprehensiveness and the whole may be employed to provide a critical perspective, a different kind of distance, and thus a basis for ethical reflection. 2.77 Monistic Immediacy This construction of mysticism is that stressed by Danto. If distinctions are unreal and there exists only one undifferentiated unity,</page><page sequence="7">MYSTICISM, THE NUMINOUS, AND THE MORAL 9 whether it is described as being or as emptiness, then conflict is illusory. If there exist no boundaries between persons, things, or communities, then there can be no conflict between the interests or values of several parties, and thus there is no need for rules to adjudicate such conflict. Insofar as ethical reflection arises from the attempt to resolve conflict between different interests and alternative courses of action open to a person, or between the interests of several persons or communities, it cannot occur in a context in which no distinctions or boundaries can be drawn. Ethical judgments are called for only in situations where there are conflicting rights, duties, loyalties, or distributive procedures. As long as there is only one Way, and all ways are seen to be identical with the Way, or any such distinction between Way and ways is an illusory distinction, then it is impossible to speak of ethical criteria or judgment. In order to have meaningful prescription, it is necessary first to be able to distinguish between the ideal and the actual. If no such distinction can be made, or if there are no rules that serve to discriminate some actions or outcomes from others, then there can be no meaningful ethical discourse. If nothing can be imagined that would escape the undifferentiated unity, the space necessary for ethical prescription would disappear. If all distinctions were dissolved, of course, the possibility of using language at all would disappear, a point which mystics have often made. If such terms as "good" and "right" are employed in a monistic context, one is led to affirm that all that is is good, and that whatever one does is right. These are surely degenerate uses of terms whose purpose is to discriminate, but they are uses that are typical of those who witness to a mystical view of experience. They follow from the drive to abolish all distinctions. The core of Danto's essay is a presentation and analysis of some themes in Indian philosophy. There are several ways in which Indian thought tends toward the collapse of distinctions into some form of immediacy. This collapse occurs on both the theoretical and practical levels, in the world view and in the ethos. An individual in samsara, the phenomenal world of mundane existence, must order his life according to the appropriate dharma, the law or principle of universal order. Considerable casuistry is devoted to the discovery of the requirements of dharma for a particular person and occasion. The aim of this process, however, is to discover the exact role with which a person should identify and the rules that apply to this case. Arjuna, in the Bhagavad Clta, identifies completely with the role of warrior. Immediacy is sought through such identification and through the overcoming of any distinction between the person and the role. There is no need to anguish over moral decision, but only to discover the appropriate role and to conform to it. The basic feature of moksha, or liberation, is spontaneity, freedom not only from anguished decision but also from the necessity of casuistic</page><page sequence="8">PROUDFOOT calculation. A person is in immediate relation to and identification with the atman, his soul or self, and thus with brahman, the impersonal and ubiquitous deity that is identified with atman. This identification is reflected in all his actions. His actions are nonmoral because he is beyond morality. Whether moksha is represented as radical disengagement from one's body and thus from the realm of dharma, or as an incarnate liberation that is characterized as a natural flow of dharmic responses obviating the need for moral decision, it is beyond morality.2 Both forms of moksha suggest an immediacy that eliminates the need for and precludes moral reflection. The Buddhist conception of nirvana also leads to the monistic collapse of distinctions. In the Theravada tradition, the social order is ignored and held to be illusory in contrast to the real. In Mahayana Buddhism, samsara is identical with nirvana. Danto comments that the blurring of this distinction may serve to eliminate suffering, but it does not suffice for ethics. The ideal and the actual have been collapsed. Here, as in the complete identification of an actor with a social role and the appropriate dharma, an immediacy is sought that eliminates the discrepancy between the ideal and the actual and the resultant experience of claim. Consequently, no critical leverage is possible. The release that is sought through meditation appears then to be a release from claims and the responsibility for adjudicating between them, as well as release from desire. Insofar as the experience of the mystic is one of immediate relation to the whole or to nothing, the possibility of conflict and thus of moral resolution is eliminated. If it is not possible to choose to act in a way that is not in conformity to the Way, then it is impossible to discriminate morally between particular actions. If morality is viewed as a set of action guides, or of rules of conduct, it collapses when no discrimination is possible. 2.72 Monistic Leverage The most natural construction of the monistic scheme, then, is that all distinctions will collapse into immediacy and moral discrimination will be undermined. There is, however, a different implication that might also be drawn from the monistic mystical perspective. This is a way of employing the monistic vision to create distance rather than to collapse it. This course is evident to some extent in the Platonic tradition in the West and in the work of those with an empathy for the mystical intuition and identification of God and being. The expansive or comprehensive is used as a critical tool against the parochial and limited. For instance, Tillich (1957) defines faith as ultimate concern and asserts that the proper object of ultimate concern is God, being-itself, or the whole. The elevation of any finite end such as material wealth, race, nation or one's private interests to the object of ultimate concern is idolatry, which is the</page><page sequence="9">MYSTICISM, THE NUMINOUS, AND THE MORAL root of all evil. Tillich is able to employ comprehensiveness critically. Similarly, Edwards (1960) contrasts true virtue, or "benevolence to being- in-general simply considered/' with sin as self-love or love of a parochial and limited aspect of being. Plato, Augustine, Spinoza, Edwards and others in this tradition would claim that the only proper object of worship, devotion, and value is the summum bonum which is the ground of all being. One ought to direct one's life toward this particular end and toward other objects only in the context of this more comprehensive goal. In the mystical context, since no integrity is ascribed to individual persons except as they participate in the whole, little or no emphasis is placed on the will. In each of the figures mentioned in the previous paragraph, for instance, freedom is viewed as identification with or participation in divine being and action. It is seen as conformity to the Way, rather than as the possibility of either conforming to or rebelling against that way. As Danto notes, the freedom of the will is not a central concern in the Indian tradition, and freedom tends to be identified with full participation in a particular role. To be free, as also to know, is to identify oneself with one's proper role or place in the entire scheme of being. It is again a move toward immediacy, toward the elimination of all distance between oneself and one's role in the larger order. Identity is discovered in complete participation. A function of this appeal to the inclusive or comprehensive in monistic traditions is the achievement of a universality of context for ethical judgments. The appeal to the whole removes the parochialism of particular interests and sets all moral judgments in a context that is universal because it is the only one. It is a particular characterization of "the moral point of view." For Edwards, for instance, judgments about the nature of true virtue can only be made in the full context of "being- in-general simply considered." A similar function of the removal of parochialism is performed in the context of very different ethical theories by requirements that ethical principles be generalizable or that disinterestedness and fairness be approximated. Many contemporary moral philosophers, particularly those influenced by Kant, would claim that a necessary though not a sufficient condition for a rule or principle to qualify as moral is its universalizability. It must be capable of being formulated in completely general terms, free of any parochial conditions. Independence of particular persons or ends is gained by an appeal to universalization and inclusiveness. This is a formal criterion which, in Kant's notion of the categorical imperative, as well as in Hare's (1952) conception of the language of morals and in Rawls's(1971) portrayal of the original position with its veil of ignorance, is applied in deontological ethical theories. The mystical monism sketched above, as exemplified in Tillich and Edwards, is</page><page sequence="10">12 PROUDFOOT more properly viewed as a teleological ethic in which the good, the end of action, is taken to be identical with all of being. While these are very different ethical positions, in both cases the move to the universal functions to eliminate parochialism and to provide a single general context for all relevantly similar ethical judgments. We shall return to this issue. At this point it is sufficient to note that the appeal to the inclusive and universal that is central to the mystical affirmation of the unity of all experience is congruent with one of the formal characteristics of a moral rule or principle. It is a way of including universalizability as an inherent condition of the moral point of view. The possibility of a critical function served by the mystical type can be seen in the way in which the relation between nirvana and samsara is conceived in Theravada as opposed to Mahayana Buddhism. Rupp (1971) has argued that one of the functions of the symbol nirvana in the Theravada tradition is to provide a critical ideal that stands in contrast to the empirical world. While the identification of samsara with nirvana is made in Mahayana texts, it is not characteristic of Theravada thought. Although Western attempts to equate nirvana with some sort of psychological state have minimized the significance of other functions of the term, it sometimes suggests a metaphysical entity, a place, or some kind of absolute standard against which the empirical world is measured and found to be wanting (Rupp, 1971:57-63). The critical leverage provided by this kind of standard is lost when samsara and nirvana are identified. Within the context of the Buddhist ontology, this leverage must come from the invocation of the whole in contrast to the parochial, of the ideal of nirvana in contrast to the limited samsara state. 2.2 The Numinous Type The second type of religious interpretation to be considered is the numinous type. The term is taken from Otto (1950). Otto provides a phenomenological description of what he takes to be the chief characteristic of religious experience. The numinous is experienced as something "wholly other/' as standing over against the self, both appealing and terrifying but always fascinating in its otherness. The numinous could be said to stand in polar opposition to the mystical experience of unity with all. Instead of the dissolution of all distinctions, one distinction, that between the holy and the profane, is drawn and extended to such an extent that it is unbridgeable and is fundamental to the entire experience. The holy or numinous stands over against one as something that contrasts with everything familiar. Just as the mystical and monistic strand pervades many reports of religious experience, many also contain the numinous element. It is even possible to characterize the numinous as a different type of mysticism. The reasons for this will be elaborated below. I shall not argue about</page><page sequence="11">MYSTICISM, THE NUMINOUS, AND THE MORAL 13 labels, but shall try to describe the implications for ethics of this emphasis upon wholly otherness. It is the numinous character of the religious experience that has often been identified with the moral aspect of the religious traditions of the West in contrast to the mystical emphasis on unity and emptiness of the Orient. But the numinous and the moral should be distinguished. Otto makes it quite clear that the numinous may be schematized with moral and cognitive elements, but he is trying to isolate something that should not be identified with either. In the Hebrew Bible, the otherness of Yahweh is stressed. Yahweh is not like the gods whose actions can be described in anthropomorphic myths or whose likeness can be captured in pictorial images. The absolute otherness of God, the sense in which all descriptions of him and of his actions are different from anything that we know about human existence, is one important theme of the Bible. The portrayal of Yahweh as will, as one who enters into covenants, who commands and expects obedience, is also a way of portraying his otherness and his claim on men. The conflict or opposition of wills is one way in which irreducible otherness is experienced. We come up against someone else who offers resistance to our particular programs for shaping the world. He refuses to be shaped and he has programs of his own. We have noted that will is not given prominence in the mystical context because the opposition between wills would threaten the undifferentiated unity. In this context, representation of man as wrll and of the numinous object as another will, is central. I am not suggesting that Otto's view of the numinous experience is as tied to the voluntary and to the experience of moral claim as will be my elaboration of this type.3 Otto's is a classic description of the interpretation of religious experience as exerting a claim, as both fascinating and terrifying, but impossible to ignore or forget. It is a description of the experience of direct confrontation with power. This is not particularly a moral experience, nor is the mystic's sense of oneness with the universe. Rather I am suggesting that in each case the basic vision is one with certain implications for both mythos and ethos, for a particular construction of the world and a particular representation of the ethical situation. Individual substance in the modern West has been conceived primarily as will or agency. The individual is autonomous. Decision and judgment are prominent. Knowledge of the self is primary. The self is held to enjoy private and privileged access to its own thoughts, deliberations and feelings. On the basis of this certain touchstone, the self constructs its knowledge of the world. The self is the original datum. All other persons and things are known through the self's perception of the external world and by analogy with its own private experiences. Knowledge is not participation in the being of an object but arises from the object's interaction with and opposition to the self.</page><page sequence="12">14 PROUDFOOT The description of the world that is appropriate to this conception is not one in which the whole is all, as in the mystical type, but one in which the basic units are individuals. The individual is an entity with its own integrity. No participation in or estrangement from an ultimate ground is implied in this conception. Individuals act and are acted upon. They are not grounded in a common being; rather they attract, repel, collide, contract, and cooperate. The goal of life is conceived in terms that are appropriate to individual perfection rather than as a return to a ground or fullness from which the individual is estranged. It is the fulfillment of duty, the authentic life, or the justification of the individual. History is a series of moments in which decisions are made and events occur. The close association between the numinous experience of otherness and the ethical character of much western religion is probably due to the sense of claim present in the numinous. The combination of terror and fascination that Otto describes suggests a claim, a presence, that is not found in the experience of unity, in which nothing stands over against the self. The claim may take an aesthetic form, or it may be the result of sheer power. Perhaps the most familiar experience of the claim of another, however, is the experience of obligations or duties, or the moral claims of other persons. The ethos that is correlated with the numinous experience is one that emphasizes this sense of claim. An individual is portrayed as a free agent who must weigh the various claims and commands to which he is subject along with his own interests and must adjudicate between them. No vision or participation in the good can provide an absolute basis for moral judgment. Decision and negotiation are called for. A sharp distinction between nature and will is often characteristic of this type, distinguishing those who comprise the source of and who are vulnerable to moral claims from the ethically neutral natural order. Deontological claims are stressed and naturalism is excluded in ethics. Values reside in persons; the only good thing is a good will. A person is a center of value and is to be respected as an end in himself. This contrasts strikingly with the monistic ethos in which the self aims for and subordinates itself to that good which includes all that is and which lies beyond the distinction between person and nature. Religion and morality in this conception have generally been linked through the notion of divine command. Obligations are interpreted as having their source in a divine will, the authority of which derives from the kind of numinous power that Otto describes. The classical religion of Israel expresses the relation of the Hebrews to Yahweh in almost exclusively voluntaristic terms. The chief themes are promise, command and obedience. Israel is constituted as a people by a series of covenants, voluntary agreements between individual and communal wills, that obtain between Yahweh and the patriarchs. The authority of the</page><page sequence="13">MYSTICISM, THE NUMINOUS, AND THE MORAL 15 covenant is based on the sheer power of Yahweh as manifested in the Exodus, in the act of creation, and on his word. His goodness is not established by appeal to some independent criteria. His commands have authority because of who he is and because he is the most powerful of all the gods. Duty, command and obedience become the chief characteristics of moral experience. In the examination of the mystical type, it was suggested that two sorts of implications could be drawn for ethical theory. On one construction, the mystical strand implied an immediacy that eliminated all distinctions, all boundaries and conflict, and that therefore collapsed the distances between persons and interests that are presupposed by moral reflection. On another construction, the mystical interpretation of experience provided a critical leverage that might function in the drawing of moral distinctions by invoking the whole over against parochial ends or idolatries. Comprehensiveness, greatness or universalization provide the fundamental criteria for discriminating between particular ends. In the. case of the numinous type, it is also possible to develop two sorts of construction. The issue by which they are to be differentiated is the same as that employed in the discussion of the monistic type. The first construction represents an immediacy that collapses ethical distance, and the second provides leverage for portraying the experience of moral claim. 2.21 Numinous Immediacy The first and most natural construction of the numinous type is one in which the experience of otherness is extrapolated to represent the ultimate nature of the universe. There is no recourse or appeal beyond obedience to the divine will, or to commands that are thought to issue from such a will. The proper response to the moral law is not critical reflection upon ethical issues, but obedience. This may be expressed in the stance of the religious fundamentalist who ascribes final authority to the literal interpretation of a sacred scripture or to the traditional laws of a particular religious community in order to avoid the conflicts aroused by the need to adjudicate between alternative claims. It can take a different form in the existential portrayal of "radical obedience" in the thought of those who claim that authentic response arises within a particular encounter, and that no principles may be imported into that encounter from other situations. The scriptural or legal literalist and the advocate of spontaneous response to another will in a dyadic encounter share a characteristic with the mystical type. The common element is a sense of immediacy, the elimination of all relativism and of the need for interpretation or judgment on the part of the actor. The literalist does not acknowledge</page><page sequence="14">16 PROUDFOOT the need to interpret scripture, and the advocate of spontaneous response wants to preclude reflective evaluation. The weighing of alternatives and the fallible judgments made on the basis of interpretations that mediate our encounters are eliminated by both positions. Whether the situation is portrayed in terms of obedience to a divine command, spontaneous response in an encounter of ego and thou, or an ecstatic sense of mystical unity with the whole, there can be no problem of relativism or acceptance of the responsibility for judging the adequacy of different arguments or claims. In each of these cases, it might be said that the possibility of moral reflection does not arise. The possibility of obedience or disobedience arises with respect to the divine will, but if that will is regarded as the ultimate court of appeal on the basis of sheer numinous power, then the possibility of moral reflection concerning whether or not obedience is right or good is precluded. Defenders of this kind of immediacy sometimes argue that divine commands are self-authenticating and cannot be subject to any criteria outside the situation. The same claim is made for nonmoral aspects of divine revelation. The person who has experienced a numinous encounter and the authority of its claim (e.g. the prophet's call in Isaiah 6) may obey or disobey, but cannot subject that claim to criteria that are external to the situation. In such a case, the space in which moral reflection, or any other reflection, takes place is collapsed. It is this celebration of the immediate that is shared by reports of numinous encounters and those of experiences of ecstatic unity. This may account for the similarity that is acknowledged when they are treated as two types of mysticism. While the experience of otherness remains, either the extension of the distance between self and other to an infinite degree in the notion of the "wholly other/' or the collapse of that distance in the encounter between ego and thou romanticized as an immediate moment of ecstasy, effectively eliminates the experience of a distance that can and must be interpreted. It precludes any basis for comparison, judgment or communication of any kind. As with the collapse into immediacy in the monistic type, this obviates the possibility of ethical reflection and adjudication between conflicting claims. 2.22 Numinous Leverage Like the mystical type, the numinous type also admits a construction that avoids the collapse into immediacy and allows for the possibility of ethical judgment. When the experience of the numinous is taken as the claim of another, whether that other be a person, a particular community, or an ideal value, and is not extrapolated into the notion of the "wholly other" or collapsed into an ego-thou encounter, it can portray the kinds of claims that are the stuff of which ethical issues are</page><page sequence="15">MYSTICISM, THE NUMINOUS, AND THE MORAL 17 made. Persons, ideal values, and even natural objects exert certain claims upon our interests, and it is in the adjudication of these claims that moral issues arise. One of the inadequacies noted in the monistic type was its inability to represent, within such a conception of reality, the kinds of claims and conflicts that give rise to moral situations. The numinous experience is paradigmatic for such claims and can represent them adequately if it is not extrapolated to the infinite. Construed in this way, it can also provide a kind of leverage thatwill contribute to the moral point of view. As the mystical emphasis on comprehensiveness provided a criterion of comprehensiveness that is central to modern moral philosophy, the element of otherness contained in the numinous experience and in the force of the claims of others on an actor is also an essential element in the moral situation. If universalizability were the only criterion to be applied to our interests in order to evaluate them morally, the experience of the claims of other persons and their interests on us would be lost. As the monistic strand allows an appeal to comprehensiveness in order to criticize a society's moral code, the appeal to the otherness of Yahweh's will provided a formal basis for leverage over against the social customs of the ancient Near East. Both the appeal to otherness and to comprehensiveness provide fulcrums from which to criticize and to relativize the mores of a society, though both remain formal and do not dictate the actual contents of a moral code. While the vision of comprehensiveness and universalizability may be extracted from the mystical type in order to provide a kind of ethical leverage, one is left with no clear conception of the actor and of a need for ethical decision unless the experience of distance between the actor and that which exerts a claim is represented. In the monistic context, the whole exerts a claim and can be used to criticize the parochial. But the only appropriate response is for the person to participate in the whole. More precisely, it is for him to come to recognize more clearly his participation in the whole and to reflect this by love for and loyalty to the fullness of being. So Augustine portrays love for one's neighbor as an aspect of the love for God that is the chief end of man. Edwards describes that end as benevolence toward being-in-general simply considered and assumes that the appropriate affections and actions toward all aspects of the universe will fall in line when this love is made man's chief end. Tillich enjoins concern for being-itself. Each of these demands a recognition of one's participation in the whole of which he is a part and the liberation from self-interest in favor of interest in that whole. In each of these cases, the otherness of one's fellows and of the natural world is not recognized. The relation between subject and object is viewed as a misrepresentation that must be overcome. Augustine does not enjoin love for the neighbor as a fundamental duty or value, but only</page><page sequence="16">18 PROUDFOOT as an aspect of one's love for God. Tillich sees concern for others as gaining its value only from its place in relation to concern for being-itself. Leverage is gained by the appeal to comprehensiveness, but the nature of the ethical situation as one in which a number of persons, interests and values pose problems of conflicting loyalties and require choices between several goods is denied. The mystical type cannot be used to represent moral conflict. The only available leverage is gained by identifying the distinction between the ideal and the actual with that between infinite and finite. Such an identification does not allow for the portrayal of competing interests that function on essentially the same level. How do I reconcile the claims between my responsibility to my family and my obligations as a citizen of a political community? Conflicts between loyalties and goals that all belong to the finite order must be portrayed by a pluralism that is not available in the monistic context. The numinous experience can provide this dimension in its representation of the claims of another. The invocation of the criterion of comprehensiveness serves to remove parochialism by inviting the agent to identify his self-interest with the interest of the full expanse of being. He is asked to expand his point of view. Even infinite expansion along such lines, however, will not lead to the experience of another over against and in conflict with the self that is an inextricable aspect of ethical situations. The former stance does not necessarily remove an ethical solipsism, but asks only that it be expanded. Discrimination in favor of the private is removed by eliminating all discrimination whatsoever. The numinous experience, however, is founded on the experience of something or someone else standing over against me, with its own existence and with certain claims upon me. When this vision is portrayed in ethical terms, it is inconsistent with solipsism of any kind. Whatever else the world may be like, I am not alone and I am not identified with all that is. There is a fundamental distinction between me and something or someone else. I cannot ignore that other existence, because it exerts on me a fascination, both appealing and terrifying. It is a claim that cannot be denied. The claim may prompt different kinds of response, including rejection, but its existence cannot be denied. It is this experience that is contributed by the numinous type and that cannot be found in the mystical interpretation of experience. 3. The Social Character of Morality. Two types of religious interpretation of experience that include particular descriptive statements about the nature of the world and correlative moral attitudes have been sketched. It has been suggested that each involves the risk of an immediacy that collapses the space necessary for moral reflection. The possibility of each for moral leverage,</page><page sequence="17">MYSTICISM, THE NUMINOUS, AND THE MORAL 19 however, can be seen by attending to both teleological and deontological forms of reflection. The mystical type contributes a criterion for universalizing the ends toward which actions are directed, or for generalizing the description of an act that is to be evaluated deontologically. The numinous type contributes a sense of the experience of moral claims exerted by other persons or by the moral law or a sense of the final goal or end that solicits one's activity. The mystic is concerned with the goals of his action, his contemplation and his life. Though the final goal, as in the case of nirvana, may be the realization of the futility of all goals and of all striving, the mystic is concerned with this realization. Particular disciplines are adopted in order to enable him to achieve the various ends of human life. The highest of these ends, for the Indian mystic, is moksha or liberation. As in all forms of teleological ethics, an action is judged according to its consequences. A form of meditation is good if it leads to insight and self-transformation. The criterion of comprehensiveness is invoked to insure that parochial goals will not become the chief aim of a person's actions, but that his life will be liberated from exclusive focus on the satisfaction of desires and will aim at achievement of the highest end. Deontological ethics is concerned not with the end of an action but with the source of that action in the intention of the actor. The emphasis of the numinous type is on obligation and claim rather than on the goal of an action. Freedom of the will is stressed, and an act is judged according to whether it is right or wrong, whether it is obedient to the divine command or the moral law. From the point of view of the deontologist, the consequences of an act are irrelevant to the evaluation of that act as morally right or wrong. The relevant questions concern the intention and the procedure by which the agent arrived at the decision to act in that way. Kant has, of course, provided the classical statement of this position. Current debates in moral philosophy reflect this distinction between the evaluation of an act in terms of its consequences and the evaluation of an act according to the intention of the actor and the obligation to which he is subject. If we begin the evaluation of an action with a consideration of the end of that action and then apply the criterion of comprehensiveness in order to inquire as to what the end of all our actions taken together ought to be, we are led to some concept of a highest good that includes all other goods. In a monistic framework, the highest good will be identified with all that is, whether that be being, substance, or even emptiness. The parochialism of specific ends is removed by this expansion, but the element of claim is still missing. If, however, we begin the evaluation with a consideration of the intention behind the act and ask whether or not that intention is in conformity to the moral law or the divine command, universality appears to be lacking. But both universality and the</page><page sequence="18">20 PROUDFOOT recognition of the claims of the other are necessary in order to represent the moral point of view. We have seen that, in the Theravada Buddhist tradition, nirvana may be portrayed in critical contrast with samsara. In the classical religion of Israel, much of the numinous power ascribed to Yahweh is strengthened by his identity as the creator of all that is. Yahweh is increasingly distinguished from pretender deities by the universality of his power. Both the monistic and numinous interpretations, then, lead to a combination of comprehensiveness and otherness as elements of experience that structure the evaluation of particular actions. Each type has strengths from which the other can benefit. Some have recently argued that universalizability and regard or moral respect for an other are necessary characteristics for an action guide or a rule to be moral (e.g. Frankena, 1970; Little and Twiss, 1974). While these may not be sufficient conditions, they allow for the inclusion of most sets of rules that would be counted as moral, while excluding prudence, various other loyalties and commitments and, most controversially perhaps, pure egoism. If these criteria are both essential characteristics of moral rules, we can see that the two critical perspectives provided by the monistic and numinous interpretations of experience are needed to complement one another. Recognition of the claims of others is not sufficient in the absence of universalizability, and vice-versa. Teleologists of the utilitarian variety try to calculate the most comprehensive consequences of an action, but the consequences with which they are concerned are the utilities of that action for persons. The ideal observer theory proposes that actions be judged according to the way in which they would be viewed by an observer and then portrays the morally relevant characteristics of the observer as all-knowing, distinterested, dispassionate, and consistent, in order to achieve universalizability (Firth, 1952). Such a model has obvious affinities with the function of the notion of God and of the divine perspective in western moral theory. The argument here is not that these positions are all identical. There are important differences between utilitarianism and the ideal observer theory, for instance. I am only trying to point to the different ways in which each takes some account of the criteria of universalizability and the perspective of the other. Calculating the final consequences of an action within the utilitarian perspective and taking the position of the ideal observer are very different procedures.4 One is an instance of teleological consideration, and the other is deontological. In both cases, however, the move toward a comprehensive view is undertaken in order to reduce parochialism, to attain a perspective that contrasts with narrow self-interest. In the utilitarian case, self-interest is not abandoned, but the context in which such interest is calculated is expanded in order to comprehend distant and nonobvious consequences. In the case of the</page><page sequence="19">MYSTICISM, THE NUMINOUS, AND THE MORAL 21 ideal observer, self-interest is transcended by the attempt to take up the position of a distinterested other who shares none of the parochial and limited characteristics of the particular situation. Both are procedures for attaining some kind of transcendent leverage over against the ethical solipsism of the individual. Universalizability and moral regard for the other are both necessary characteristics of a set of rules that is to qualify as a moral code. We have seen that the mystical and numinous perspectives can be construed in such a way as to suggest these characteristics. But we have also seen that monistic mystics and devotees of the numinous are especially vulnerable to an emphasison immediacy thateliminatesall possibility of conflict and collapses that space that is necessary for morality. What is the factor that would enable us to differentiate these two conditions? I want to suggest that it is the recognition of the social character of morality. Morality consists of a set of rules for the guidance of action, and it is a social institution. Frankena (1970) has argued that morality is social in other ways as well, that it concerns the relation of one individual to his fellows, and that it calls for a consideration of the effects of his actions on others from their points of view. Even without the latter and stronger contention for the social character of morality, however, it is a social institution. Moral reflection takes time and it requires language. The language of morals presupposes a social fabric. Morality as a social institution is concerned with the establishment of relationships between persons and groups whose actions impinge upon one another. A moral code is an institution for the regulation of action among persons and communities with competing and conflicting interests. It is adopted as a means of establishing some form of cooperative or social activity among various actors. It is a response to the need for cooperation and negotiation among self-interested persons and groups (Little and Twiss, 1974:45). The implications of the mystical and numinous interpretations of experience that lead to the immediacy that precludes moral reflection arise from an emphasis on the atemporal and asocial character of those experiences. We have seen that the chief characteristic of the mystical interpretation is to dissolve all distinctions, to eliminate all boundaries, and to suggest an identification of the self with an undifferentiated whole. The experience of the numinous as Otto describes it is one that is set apart from all other aspects of life. It radically contrasts with the experiences and the language that constitute ordinary social intercourse. Insofar as the numinous is experienced within the social order, it is described in romantic fashion as set apart from ordinary meetings and interaction. In both the mystical and the numinous cases, the experience is perceived as ecstasy, as one in which the individual stands outside of himself and outside of his social and temporal relations to other persons</page><page sequence="20">22 PROUDFOOT and to the community. When these interpretations are taken to be paradigmatic, they lead to an understanding of the self as asocial and atemporal. For the mystic, the self is identified with the undifferentiated whole; for the devotee of the numinous, it is seen as something set apart from all others by the ecstasy of this individuating experience. In both cases, the self is abstracted from its social context. When the social character of the self is recognized, ultimate dissolution into or identification with the whole and ultimate isolation as a will standing over against another will are both seen to be abstractions. Distinctions, boundaries, and distances between selves can never be eliminated. Commands or claims can never be self-authenticating but must always be subject to the interpretations and the doubts that accompany all of our perceptions. The security of some immediate relation to the ground of being or of some unquestionable revelation or divine command is no longer available. The moments of ecstatic experience of unity or of encounter are seen as moments in the life of a social self and not as some key to the illusory character of social and temporal existence. When the social character of the self, its interests and the claims it experiences are recognized, and the adoption of rules for the adjudication of conflicting interests and claims is viewed as a social task, then the criteria of universalization and regard for the other are set in a different context. Universalizability is no longer subject to a construction that implies the elimination of all boundaries or of conflict. It is a universalizability among the different persons who make up a community and, ultimately, among all members of the human community. Moral respect for another can no longer be viewed as referring to uncritical obedience to the will of another whose claim is based on the sheer power of numinous experience. The claims of each must be weighed in the light of the claims of all members of the social order. When viewed in the context of a social community, both universalizability and moral regard for the other become more concrete and are invulnerable to the constructions that preclude moral conflict and resolution. The rejection of the dntological views that result from the reification of the visions of both the mystic and the devotee of the numinous, however, does not necessitate a denial of the contributions that both can make to the religious support for a moral point of view. If these experiences are not immediately interpreted into the ontological and ethical perspectives discussed above but are first mediated by our knowledge of the social and temporal character of morality and of human experience generally, they can provide visions that embody two important characteristics of the moral point of view. Such visions are only useful in ethical reflection, however, when they are structured or schematized by analyses of the criteria for ethical judgment.</page><page sequence="21">MYSTICISM, THE NUMINOUS, AND THE MORAL 23 While the mystical and numinous interpretations may be construed as ideal types that pervade many reports of religious experience, they are not intended to be exhaustive. There may exist forms of religious interpretation of experience that are explicitly social and that celebrate the formation of community and the sacred character of social rites rather than ecstatic asocial experience. Royce (1913) provides such an interpretation and does so in reaction to James whom he faulted for ignoring the social dimension in his attempt to describe the varieties of religious experience. Perhaps Confucianism comes as close to this aspect of religious interpretation as any oriental tradition (Fingarette, 1972). Questions have been raised as to whether or not Confucianism should be characterized as a religion. I suspect that such questions arise from the identification of religion with the kind of ecstatic experience and affirmation of transcendent reality that is characteristic of the mystical and numinous types. There is no reason, however, to preclude the formulation of symbols of transcendence in social terms. In such a case, the basic paradigm must not be the undifferentiated whole of the first type or the discrete individual will of the second type but a social and relational one in which the self is viewed as a polis or as a community of often conflicting memories, interests and projects. Such a view of the self has roots in the western tradition from Plato to Freud, and since the early nineteenth century there have been several attempts to portray ultimate reality in social and relational terms. Such a notion of transcendence might provide leverage for a conversion or transformation of the social order rather than an escape into some form of immediacy. The social view of the self is also more comprehensive than those that emphasize only the relation of part to whole or the encounter with another. An adequate account of community demands representation of diverse conflicts, a plurality of interests, and the relation of the individual to the society of which he is a part. The fundamental experiences that are taken to be paradigmatic for the religious interpretations of the mystical and numinous types can be comprehended within such a social conception of the self (Proudfoot, 1976). The mystical and numinous interpretations can then be seen as dramatic or mythical portrayals of particular aspects of experience. Such portrayals often create the necessary mythos to highlight a particular form of transcendence that is appropriate at a specific time and place and that provides a leverage not available in the prevailing mythos or world view. The dramatizations of the otherness of God by Amos, Luther, Kierkegaard and Barth all represent emphases that served to provide a critical transcendence over against what the author took to be relatively complacent cultures. The emphases upon the comprehensiveness and unity of God by Deutero- Isaiah, Augustine, Calvin, Schleiermacher and Tillich were employed to stress the encompassing power and steadfastness of God at times when fragmentation and conflict appeared to obscure any basis for trust in a</page><page sequence="22">24 PROUDFOOT creator who is the source of all experience and in his providential government of the world. The superiority of the social conception of the self for a description of persons and their world can be argued on other grounds. It provides a more adequate account of the linguistically and temporality of human experience and of the development of the self within a communal context than do the views that result from a translation of the visions that inform the mystical and numinous interpretations into descriptive terms. The latter interpretations are important expressions of particular aspects of experience but are not sufficiently comprehensive to provide a descriptive account that accords with our knowledge and experience as a whole. The social view, however, is able to comprehend and provide an account of both the mystical and numinous experiences, while employing a view of the social self that is more faithful to the current state of our knowledge. While arguments for the superiority of the social self can and should be given independently, some corroboration for this position may be found in the fact that the social view allows for a representation of the world that includes both the experience of the claim of another and that of the need for universalization. In the passage quoted at the outset, Geertz writes that religious symbols function to correlate a particular image of the world's construction with an ethos that is felt to be authoritative. The world view is rendered believable and the ethos justifiable by the authority that accrues to each through their correlation with one another. An image of the world's construction that did not allow for the representation of the moral claim of otherness or of universality would be called into question by its inability to include the claims that we find authoritative. In Geertz's terms, either the image of the world or the ethos in which moral claims are experienced would have to be altered or, more likely, a religious symbol system would be developed to account for and to bridge the discrepancy. Such symbols exist. The belief of the mystic that all distinctions and boundaries, all experiences of otherness, are illusory functions to explain away the experienced claims of others and to portray them as tempting and diverting illusions that must be transcended in favor of celebration of the single reality that is. The belief of the polytheist that he owes allegiance to the particular cultic or national deity with which his memories and his fortunes are identified and that this loyalty represents one among many that exist in the universe is one that reinforces the sense of claim but has no resources for representing the generalizing or universalizing character of the moral point of view. The doctrine of God as it has developed in the theological and religious images of Judaism and Christianity represents one attempt to develop a religious symbol that reflects both the claim of universality</page><page sequence="23">MYSTICISM, THE NUMINOUS, AND THE MORAL 25 and that of the other. God is the creator of all, and each man stands, individually and as a member of various communities, coram deo. Danto argues that moral attitudes and propositions depend for their applicability on the acceptance of certain factual beliefs, but he does not critically address the question of what factual beliefs are and how they are fixed. He seems to imply that insofar as they are beliefs that we hold about the world, we hold them as true and therefore they are unproblematic for us (Danto, 1972: xi). I have defended the weaker thesis that our beliefs about the world and our moral attitudes must be congruent. Neither is fixed as firmly as Danto seems to suggest that our factual beliefs are. An examination of two prominent interpretations of religious experience can serve to illumine some aspects of what we take to be the moral point of view. Both the religious interpretations and the aspects of the moral situation with which they are correlated suggest a representation of the world that reflects our social experience. NOTES 1The following distinction is typical: Shankara's system is best labelled "non-dualistic" rather than "monistic" to distinguish it from any position that views reality as a single order of objective being. Advaita Vedanta is concerned to show the ultimate non-reality of all distinctions - that Reality is not constituted by parts, that in essence it is not- different from the Self. The unity or "oneness" that Advaita upholds, as we shall see later in close detail, does not require variety or multiplicity, as is the case with most monistic views, in order to be affirmed. (Deutsch, 1969:3, n 2) Deutsch's point is well taken. In the present context, monism is regarded not as a view that requires multiplicity, but as precisely the assertion of the nonreality of all distinctions. Some mystical thinkers posit an order of being (e.g. Tillich) and thus differ from Vedanta. But they are united in the ultimate denial of real distinctions and in the claim that there is no essential difference between Reality and the Self or between any two other things that might be distinguished. 2Underwood (1974) has called attention to the fact that many Hindu systems distinguish between two basic aspects of moksha: videhamukti or bodiless liberation and jivanmukti or liberation of the embodied soul. While the former refers to radical disengagement from one's body and from the realm of dharma, the latter is liberation while still embodied and present in the empirical world. But jivanmukti is also a form of immediacy. "Such a person acts immediately from the central informing reality which he has come to realize within himself (Underwood, 1974:64). Complete liberation is videhamukti. The Jivanmukta is the penultimate phase of a liberated soul. The really liberated soul is not attached even to the last appendage of body. It is entirely free from all adjuncts, even its gross body which the Jivanmukta possesses (Joshi, 1965:499).</page><page sequence="24">26 PROUDFOOT 3Otto (1950:50-59), however, argues for the superiority of Christianity over other religions because it most fully appreciates the moral obligation and duty, the sense of sin and need for atonement, that is associated with the numinous. The close association of the numinous experience with moral obligation is not foreign to Otto. 4Rawls (1971 :27, 184-92) argues for the essential similarity of the ideal spectator and classical utilitarian positions in contrast to his own theory of justice as fairness.
