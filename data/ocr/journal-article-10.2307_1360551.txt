<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dandies, Marginality and Modernism: Georgia O'Keeffe, Marcel Duchamp and other Cross-dressers SUSAN FILLIN-YEH Two photographs made at nearly the same time in the 1920s, and in the same city, New York, offer the dandy's image to twentieth-century viewers. For, studied singly and in their interrelationships, both Alfred Stieglitz's photograph of painter Georgia O'Keeffe dressed with uncompromising and elegant simplicity in an oversized man's hat, dark suit jacket and white shirt open at the neck (Fig. 1), and Man Ray's photograph of Dadaist Marcel Duchamp in drag (Fig. 2) are alluring. As happens generally with portrait photographs, each photograph is a collab- oration. In even the most ordinary of such photo- graphs, the sitter poses her-/himself for a photographer who in turn also has a visual agenda. But with these photographs, the situation was in- tensified, for photographer and sitter were partners in invention. These photographs were more than simply portraits; they are agents in the construction of new artistic, cultural and sexual meanings, even of personal narrative. O'Keeffe once alluded to their passionate love affair when speaking of Stieglitz's photographs of her.1 Her comment, one made in the 1970s, was an unprecedented one, a rare admission that her sexual life had a life in her art. As for the Duchamp/Ray collaboration, it insinuated the image of Parisian femmefatale into the New York art world of the early twentieth century. That person- age, an elegant, alluring and mysterious woman, at ease in a public space, had earlier been a central figure in nineteenth-century European literature and art (in the writing of Charles Baudelaire, and paintings by Gustave Moreau, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and others). The femme fatale is central to what Mary Ann Doane has felicitously termed the 'archaeology of modernism'. As Doane has pointed out, the femme fatale is a nexus for new, early twentieth-century ideas about modernity and urbanization (she inhabits a new urban space of dance halls, streets and restaurants), she figures in Freudian theory, and is central to the new repro- ductive technologies of photography and film.2 A 'sign of strength in an unwritten history'3 of the many feminisms, the femme fatale, as Doane has discussed her epistemology, carries with her the power of masquerade, a privileged, distanced and disruptive anti-knowledge behind a cool facade.4 The Duchamp photograph charts the profound ambivalence about sexual difference characteristic of the late nineteenth century, for it is the image of a disguise, laced with witty subterfuge. Duchamp borrowed his fashionable hat with its wonderful patterned headband from a friend, Grace Ewing, and it was Ewing who posed for the hands. Duchamp finished his creation by retouching Ray's photograph, softening the lens' focus to exaggerate the shadowy, sultry image of a femmefatale's myster- ious and elusive mobility. But downtown Greenwich Village Bohemia 'in the know' recognised another kind of mobility: androgyny. They recognized Marcel Duchamp cut loose from conventional notions of gendered indi- viduation to present himself as the woman he named Rrose Selavy - a woman with veiled and shadowed eyes who has posed as if resting her elbows on a cafe table. Duchamp, so the image read to his audience, was double gendered, and - seemingly - changed his sexual aspect as easily as he changed clothing. And what of O'Keeffe? If the politics and mores of life in avant-garde circles influenced her dandyism, she also brought with her to New York by 1907 the disposition for cross-dressing not uncommon among middle-class young women born in the last decades of the nineteenth century (Fig. 3).5 These images of gender doubling and role reversal, the one of a man in the guise of a woman, the other one of a woman in Baudelaire's moder man's immaculate linen and stark black suiting (that 'moder hero's' garb, Baudelaire wrote, which has 'its own beauty'),6 once shaped an ambiance, while evoking it for us now: Greenwich Village in the 1910s, where aesthetic experimentation, feminism and other kinds of political activism flourished in a new climate of personal liberation, liberated sexual- ity, and at least the beginnings of a new sexual free- dom for women.7 These photographs of artists all dressed up, with, as one might say (and as their work reveals it), everywhere to go, are versions of a special- ized expression of artifice, a modernist icon/pose/ mode: the dandy. Defined conventionally as male, but also as female, as embodied in the dandyism of turn-of-the-century Gibson Girl Shirtwaist fashions, the dandy was coolly elegant, detached but intensely aware of self and situation. As perhaps the best known among other artists they knew, O'Keeffe and Duchamp, as well as Florine Stettheimer, took up and deliberately altered that dandy's image inher- ited from the nineteenth century, re-fashioning it to their own needs, and a new avant-garde art.8 It is hardly surprising that the model of Bau- delaire's dandy translated so easily from French into THE OXFORD ART JOURNAL - 18:2 1995 33</page><page sequence="2">.S c "0 C Qt ; n + .

And lively models for dandyism existed: Stieglitz in his well-known black cloak10 and Duchamp (both as male and as female) with his consummate elegance. (O'Keeffe once remarked on it.)"1 The dandy's persona was seen as a vehicle for breaking with convention: New York artists shared Baudelaire's dandy's 'burning need to make of oneself something original'.'2 Now why was it that the dandy's image had such cogency for avant-garde art production in New York in the early twentieth century? It may be that the persona of the dandy is especially suited to urban modernism, beginning with Baudelaire's Paris, because, as we know it from his pronouncements, the type so clearly emerges as a composite: the flneur/dandy, stroller/observer, 'passionate spec- tator',13 and the painter of moder life who can be identified as 'the perfect fldneur'.'4 In the 1930s, Siegfried Kracauer commented on Baudelaire's thinking: 'On the Boulevards, the dandies lived, so to speak, extraterritorially.'15 Kracauer's exile's emphathies for dandyism surface in Walter Ben- jamin's fleneur/dandy, composedly present but 'out of place',16 as Benjamin puts it, on city streets. Kracauer's and Benjamin's glosses on Baudelaire can suggest ways of looking at art produced earlier in the century in New York; for Duchamp, O'Keeffe Fig. 3.

Perhaps we need to remind ourselves that, as with post-modernism now, modernism too was once defined not in relation to formal concerns,17 but rather was structured in cultural terms, and was oppositional. New York art circles in Greenwich Village forged pragmatic definitions of modernism which were later submerged in the 1960s in discus- sions of self-contained and purified modes of mod- ernism applied mostly to painting.18 Greenwich Villagers in the teens were proud of their distance from bourgeois life and conventional politics and celebrated their marginality: it was much more interesting where they were.19 Thus it is no surprise that the attempts of New York modern- ists to relocate these new worlds within the shifting boundaries of their own art seem to inscribe the strolling dandy's fascination with boundary lines and moving across them, her/his familiarity with being marginal, 'out of place', which also gave a new place on which to stand. Representations of dandies in nineteenth-century paintings make marginality explicit, for they are rendered visible to us now in images of their up-to- the-minute fashion statements, for example, those declasses artists and intellectuals self-defined by dress,20 whose presence Baudelaire pointed out in the work of Constantin Guys, Eugene Lami and Gavarni, and which we have learned to recognize in paintings by Tissot, Caillebotte and Manet. Manet's barmaid of the Bar at the Folies Bergire, beautiful in her black Parisian dress, is their female equivalent. T.J. Clark has described this woman and other dandies, compelling personalities whose elegant appearance punctuated nineteenth-century images of urban capitalism. Elegance, masking, and self- construction loosened their class ties.21 If the Folies Bergere barmaid is a person 'whose demeanor', as Anne Hanson has noted, is blunt and indifferent,22 at the same time, as Clark writes, her face has a 'character [which] derives from its not being bour- geois - and having that fact almost hidden'.23 With their class status disguised by their fashionable appearance, barmaid and flaneur had a new, if tenuous and chancy, social mobility; with their class not quite identifiable, some crossed class lines. A linguistic concept that illuminates their new, late nineteenth-century freedom of motion is that of the 'shifter', a free floating linguistic sign like 'he'/she', or 'this'/that',24 a word which takes on specific meaning only when used in context. The notion of a 'shifter' is useful in explaining another aspect of the fit between dandyism and modernism, between dandyism as self-image and dandyism as self-defining artistic strategy, as absorbed into the ethos of New York's avant-garde. It is not only that the avant-garde encouraged shifting sexual freedom. There was also a significant distinction between New York's avant-garde and ear- lier ones: its many women artists. The notion of the 'shifter' goes a long way in suggesting why the per- sona of the dandy was such a useful one tactically for women of the avant-garde in the early modern period - and why female dandies abounded in early mod- ernism.25 For if, like the men, avant-garde women relished their place apart from conventional art insti- tutions, they differed from them in being doubly dis- placed, that is, intensely aware of the need to negotiate, to assert individuality within what was still 'male' avant-garde culture.26 O'Keeffe wrote in 1930, 'I have had to go to the men as sources in my paint- ing because the past has left us so small an inherit- ance of women's painting.'27 Stettheimer once commented ironically on a male photographer's arrogance, and his female subject's artistic revenge. Although the progatonists are un-named, they are clearly Stieglitz and O'Keeffe.28 The presence of women put new pressure on androgyny. In a climate in which women's images and actions as independent artists were without precedent, they made themselves up as they went along, defining themselves in new - and shifting - contexts. Thus women's dandy's images took on meanings which were empowering. They framed a challenge to the dominant mode of male discourse by using its own symbols against it. The early twentieth century inherited such images as photo- grapher Frances Benjamin Johnston's 189629 self portrait smoking a cigarette which mimics and flaunts male attributes and body language, and undermines the view that stereotypic male beha- viour was unnatural for a woman. Although Johnston chose to show herself in women's clothing, her constructed pose was that of a cross-dresser, and her image operated then in the sense that Susan Gubar has discussed it: 'Cross-dressing becomes a way of ad-dressing and re-dressing the inequities of culturally-defined categories of masculinity and femininity.'30 As SandraM. Gilbert has written, 'Feminist modernist costume imagery is radically revisionary in a political sense, for it implies that no one, male or female, can or should be confined to a uni-form, a single form or self.'31 Female cross-dressers sometimes functioned as sex symbols for nineteenth-century men who attempted to eroticize and thus possess independent women or who repressed homosexual fantasies. But the New York avant-garde also inherited the examples of middle-class32 professional women. Dr Mary Walker wore men's clothing as a Civil War doctor, and described its importance to her: it gave her the power to do herjob. 'While bodies are caged in the petticoat badge of dependence,' she wrote, 'minds and souls ... cannot command them- selves.'33 Her choice of men's clothing for freedom of THE OXFORD ARTJOURNAL - 18:2 1995 36</page><page sequence="5">action was a tactic taken up by early feminists such as Mme Bernard Trouser, who lent her name to her sartorial invention, pants for women - 'trousers'.34 Women in Greenwich Village may have had warm feelings for the stories of earlier women in the art world, for example, the French painter of animal subjects, Rosa Bonheur, who obtained permission from the Prefecture of the City of Paris to wear men's clothing when she needed to visit barnyards and stables.35 Late nineteenth and early twentieth-century images of female cross-dressing in America included photographs of fresh-faced, wholesome-looking beauties like the popular actress, Maude Adams, who was famous at the turn of the century for playing men's roles on stage. These images, and similar Gibson Girl advertising images of women in men's hats and shirts, almost suggest a utopian vision of sexual equality, if only in consumerism. The photograph portrait of O'Keeffe in costume in men's formal clothing for a 1907 New York Art Students' League Ball alluded to above (Fig. 3) can be placed within a tradition of snapshots depicting high-spirited friendships among middle-class young women who wear men's clothing. The photograph's high-jinks evoke O'Keeffe's youthful self, and are predictive. Markedly absent in O'Keeffe's photograph is the expression of pain Gubar has discovered in many well-known late nineteenth- and early twentieth- century images of women dressed like men, as for example, in a self portrait of 1920 by expatriate painter Romaine Brooks.36 The image is startling in its similarities to Stieglitz's photograph of O'Keeffe, but it offers very different emotional messages. Brooks presented herself against a background of charred, bombed-out ruins, and her painting reveals obvious signs of strain in her shaded eyes and face and tense posture. The pose may suggest Brooks' sympathies with Radclyffe Hall, who constructed an ambivalent and troubled fictional characterization of Brooks in her book, The Well of Loneliness. As Gubar has noted, 'Hall wrote about the frustration of a girl born to a father who treats his daughter as the son he wanted. Since this is only a slight exaggeration of the psychology of what growing up female can be in patriarchy... Hall's analysis of her sense of freakish- ness repeats itself ... [in many women's biogra- phies].'37 But O'Keeffe's image, like Duchamp's masquer- ade, is exuberant. We recall that in Duchamp's image as Rrose Selavy even the name he made up for his alter-ego was a joke, a pun: Rrose Selavy trans- lates as 'love - that's life', if one gets it that 'love/ eros' is 'Rrose' with its doubled 'r's rolled out French style, and 'c'est la vie' has been anglicized - 'that's life'. And as with O'Keeffe's, the image gives us Duchamp's own wonderful good looks. His genuine allure as a woman departs from the nineteenth- century tradition of men dressed up as women who often look as gawky or deliberately awkward as New York Ash Can School painter, John Sloan, once did when in 1894 he dressed up as 'Twillbe' in a the- atrical spoof of Trillbe,38 the victim/heroine of a popular Victorian pot-boiler. Even Duchamp allowed himself to look awkward in one particular Ray/Duchamp photograph collaboration of 1921, a perfume bottle label for a Duchamp 'readymade', Belle Haleine: Beautiful Breath, Veil Water, in which the image-makers leave no doubt that Duchamp really is a man.39 Images of the androgynous body multiplied in New York's avant-garde circles in a climate linking the artist's body and artistic radicalism. Both Stieglitz circle artists, many of whom explored organic imagery, and Dadaists, who took the mechanical world as a point of departure, con- structed androgynous images as a format for uncon- ventional, intimate portraits. Duchamp's Large Glass/The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, even ... (1915-23)40 opened the possibilities for this new bridging, even for a new mode of sexuality, for the Large Glass, which offered contemporaries transpar- ent images of the activities of amorous robots, featured 'Bachelors' who were dandies of sorts. Even though Duchamp provided a different identity for each of them,41 all of the bachelors wear abstracted versions of what is clearly the same generic 'morn- ing' coat. Their suiting is proper wedding attire and more. Duchamp characterized it as a 'livery of uniforms', a phrase which vividly evokes Baudelaire's comments on the modern hero.42 As with Baudelaire, Duchamp's list of professions even includes an undertaker.43 And if, as with Baudelaire, who observed that 'A uniform livery of affliction bears witness to equality',44 Duchamp's bachelor dandies in their 'livery' are representatives of Baudelaire's 'public soul',45 their representations are also Bau- delairean because they are 'outer husks'.46 Duchamp's construction in the Large Glass seem- ingly took Baudelaire literally, for in his eccentric system, the uniforms are empty clothing,47 clothing, that is, as a receptacle, which waits for an identity to be supplied. It is amusing to suppose that viewers of the glass, spectators who for Duchamp functioned as part of the tableau, offered their own diverse ident- ities to the bachelors much in the way one poses for a joke to be photographed behind false painted bill- board identities at a carnival. Even more than this borrowing, though, there is the fact that the bachel- ors are 'moulds' and they are 'hollow'.48 Their liver- ies have the possibility of filling with mysterious essences that Duchamp invented ('illuminating gas', 'provisional color')49 which he called 'eros' matrix'.50 Duchamp's is far from being the only double- gendered image produced in New York avant-garde circles in the 1910s and 1920s. Paintings by Florine Stettheimer suggest how readily the implications of Duchamp's practices found acceptance. Stettheim- er's 1923 Portrait of Marcel Duchamp even documents Duchamp in his dandy's doubled manifestations. THE OXFORD ART JOURNAL - 18:2 1995 37</page><page sequence="6">$ ii f- ff r! Fig. 4.

Stettheimer painted Duchamp seated facing his alter ego, Rrose Selavy, whom she chose to represent as a stylish female sylph who balances with impeccable poise on a stool at the top of a spring in a Rube Gold- berg-like contraption that Duchamp manipulates.51 Stettheimer's paintings bring us New York in the 1920s and 1930s, taking in Greenwich Village and 42nd Street, downtown Bohemia, the 'upper crust', and popular culture; they offer a new mix of subject matter, for as Linda Nochlin has pointed out, Stett- heimer populated her paintings of the city with personal friends, a 'shifting' dandy-esque world of public and private.52 A lively participant in New York cultural life whose pictures contradict conven- tionally held ideas that she was a recluse,53 Stettheimer gave parties which indexed the contem- porary art scene.54 Carl Springehor's informal group portrait of art world guests at a party at the Stettheimer sisters' apartment includes Charles Demuth, Arnold Genthe, Carl Van Vechten, Isabel Lachaise and Georgia O'Keeffe.55 And Stettheimer herself was no stranger to the tactics of cross-dressing and dandyism.

Stettheimer's self portraits offer new images of the androgynous body. Portrait of Myself gives us Florine in her female persona in diaphanous flaming red, who doubles as male in the black beret she wears, an accessory borrowed from among the attributes of the nineteenth-century romantic male artist. A garland of flowers circles, while concealing, the point of sex. Later, in Family Portrait, she is male in her black painting clothes - actually fashionable lounging pyjamas modelled on a man's suit. Except she also has on high-heeled red shoes. As with the earlier portrait, the accessory, here the fancy woman's footgear, gives doubled gender to her image. Stettheimer was highly con- scious of her sense of disguise. As one of her poems describes it: 'Occasionally / A human being / Saw my light / Rushed in / Got singed / Got Scared / Rushed out / Called fire' she wrote, 'Or it happened / That he tried to extinguish it / Never did a friend / Enjoy it... / So I learned to turn it low... a protec- tion . ..56 But even 'turned low', Stettheimer's cross-dressed self-images in paintings, self-constructions of a con- summate dandy's personifications, offer evidence of the very acceptability of role and rule changes in the New York art world of the 1910s and 1920s, among a crowd which prized personal and artistic leeway and room to manoeuver. Duchamp's famous urinal, R. Mutt's Fountain (1917) was, as William Camfield has argued very convincingly,57 known in Stieglitz and Dadaist circles both as a male Buddha and a female Madonna. Influenced by Duchamp, Man Ray's Dadaist 'readymades' also embodied the new Dadaist aesthetic in which sexual tensions and ambiguities resulted in a charged personal imagery. One of Ray's choices for a 'readymade', or claimed object, was a kitchen utensil, an egg beater with quotidian but fundamental associations with food, even life (birth, the egg), and scrambled destruction. Ray photographed it and then called identical prints of the same photograph Woman - and Man.58 Another Ray and Duchamp collaborative photo- graph, Rotary Glass Plates,59 offers us Duchamp subsumed within the transparent body of a machine. This machine and other Dadaist mech- anomorphs were almost invariably defined as female in the iconography of New York Dada. 'Man has made the machine in his own image,' wrote Dadaist participant Paul Haviland in 1915, and went on to describe her lungs, her limbs,60 etc. In a climate where both men and women sought to define them- selves in terms of the other sex, Haviland's comment apparently seeks to annex some perceived notion of female power; it hints at sexual tension perhaps cranked up a notch because of the presence of an active, female, avant-garde. 'Why,' as Alice Jardine commented in another not dissimilar context, 'do all of these guys want to be women?'61 Along with anthropomorphic Dadaist representa- tions possessing an ambiguous and doubled sexual- ity, Stieglitz circle artists also produced their own images of elusive and mysterious doublings which unfold into their opposites, or are bisexual or androgynous. O'Keeffe and Arthur G. Dove62 made paintings of plant and organic life whose recurrent themes re-enact the dandy's personae: shifting images - images sexually charged, but without a fixed gender - are particularly modern. These are paintings of unmistakable but indefinable sexual content, whose sexual valences are impossible to pin down. Even if one were to apply the Freudian biologically-based theories of gender often resorted to in avant-garde circles in the 1910s, the shapes in such paintings are simultaneously phallic and womblike. Freudian definitions were not always taken seriously in the Greenwich Village art world, and were often mis-applied. Perhaps they lost credence because they had become popular and over-used so quickly. In 1915, Susan Glaspell and George Cram Cook of the Provincetown Players even wrote a play, Suppressed Desires, spoofing the use of Freudian definitions, which was billed as a Freudian Comedy. And Alfred Stieglitz repudiated Freudianism as passe in a well publicized exhibition statement of 1921.63 Even so, Freudian ideas were part of a common language in the New York art world throughout the 1910s and 1920s, and beginning in the 1910s, O'Keeffe's art was often defined in essen- tialist Freudian terms. These were definitions she was reluctant to accept ('I would hear men saying, "She is pretty good for a woman; she paints like a man." That upset me.' )64 Photographs which document O'Keeffe's paint- ings raise other quite obvious questions about the climate for criticism in New York in the 1910s and 1920s, questions like 'Whose Freudianism?' or 'Who is doing the interpreting?' If phallic suggestions in O'Keeffe's sculpture and drawings in the 1910s seemed inescapable to her viewers then, still, it is useful to remember that it was Alfred Stieglitz who took the photographs65 which promote this reading, and that O'Keeffe and Stieglitz often disagreed on the work's meaning. O'Keeffe's statements about her work deny a specific essentialist sexual content.66 Sexual images in O'Keeffe's art offer us a pervasive sexuality, one which floats loose from ties to fixed notions of gender; her imagery also shifts terms constantly to construct and re-construct images. It is useful to recall that O'Keeffe's life-sized, breakthrough, abstract drawings of the 1910s were charged with unusual somatic resonances: O'Keeffe drew some of them while crawling on the floor over them.67 These drawings were among O'Keeffe's first to take their cues from the generative forces in plant life. O'Keeffe, who designed Arts and Crafts move- ment Art Education programmes when she taught in Texas public schools, adapted particularly the image of the budding, sprouting plant in her abstractions.68 While reminding us that flowers are THE OXFORD ART JOURNAL - 18:2 1995 39</page><page sequence="8">.... _r ; *::^^ ^ .':; * ' ;: ""'"M lillI?

What is one to make of the petals in Two Calla Lilies on Pink? Are they female? And the yellow protrusions from the flower centres? Are they phallic? Serial painting ensembles in black and white, which are typical of O'Keeffe's work beginning in the 1910s, pare away form to conflate a shifting and charged bisexuality with the studied presentation of the dandy's self-making. O'Keeffe, who had read Charlotte Perkins Gilman's articles on simplified clothing for liberated women in The Forerunner, in the 1910s began to dress exclusively in black or white, paring down and refining her fashion life at about the same time she reduced her palette.69 In the Shell and Old Shingle70 series of 1926, successive paint- ings - significantly - lose their green pigment to leave us with the colours of a dandy's white linen and stark, black suiting. A suite of black and white paintings of c.1930, brought together for an exhibi- tion at Stieglitz's gallery71 in 1932 is another celebra- tion of the absence of colour (Fig. 7). In these Fig. 7.

Crosby Kemper, Collection of Whitney Museum of American Art. paintings, elegance alone remains. Stripped to the barest edge of legibility, they etch vibrating outlines with the rudiments of a flickering and pervasive human and vegetal sexuality. It is instructive to compare the aesthetic dandyism of O'Keeffe and Stettheimer. If at first the two seem to have little in common, each carried over the dandy's artifice and shifting ambiguities from her person to her art. Unlike O'Keeffe, Stettheimer played with ultra-feminine tropes as if with masks, re-vamping the cliches of the feminine: jewels, flounces, lace. She claimed cellophane as an artistic material in sets she created in 1934 for the opera, 4 Saints in 3 Acts, written by Gertrude Stein with music by Virgil Thompson. Stettheimer's assumed naive imagery offers us an art which is dense, packed. She destroyed spatial illusion in order to leave room for things, describing her paintings in poems which are like lists: they are non-hierarchical with a lateral spread. Here is one in which Stettheimer describes herself in terms of objects, a set of desires: I like slippers gold I like oysters cold and my garden filled with flowers and the sky full of towers and traffic in the streets and Maillard's sweets and Bendel's clothes and Nat Lewis hose and Tappes window arrays and crystal fixtures and my pictures.72 All this abundance would seem to be quite different from O'Keeffe's stripped-down sensibility, until we take note of their similarities. In both, we have an art crafted out of excess - in the one, Stettheimer's, an extreme materiality; in the other, O'Keeffe's, an extreme reserve. Perhaps the best way to suggest the importance of the dandy's persona as an artistic tactic in the art of O'Keeffe and Stettheimer is to compare paintings that both made in the 1920s and 1930s in which startling objects float, dislocated, in the sky. In O'Keeffe paintings, these are mostly flowers (Fig. 8), though she also chose bones and cow and deer skulls.73 These paintings take on new meanings when compared with Stettheimer's Family Portrait, No. 2, where numerous things, including a chan- delier and its near look-alike in the form of a glowing and crystalline image of the Chrysler building, are suspended. As with O'Keeffe, Stettheimer levitates silk flowers, crafted emblems of a stereotyped femin- inity. These objects with their novel locations also have undergone disconcerting scale changes. Literally ungrounded, enormous, they are observed as spec- tacle, as panoply. And with this vision, artificed, ambiguous and shifting, we are returned to the elegant and strolling flineur/dandy, who takes on an THE OXFORD ARTJOURNAL - 18:2 1995 41</page><page sequence="10">cross-dressers, and especially for women artists, a persona which is inscribed in Stettheimer's dense narrations, in O'Keeffe's resonant severities, and the destabilizing spatial disjunctions seen in both. Each in her own way gives us images of modernism's mobile spaces in a vision of a world no longer grounded in certainty, no longer marked out in traditional perspective or rules of painting - or in cliched sexual roles. If, as one might argue, modern- ism and the dandy constructed each other, women artists of New York's avant-garde74 shaped that con- struction to their own purposes as specially suited to their own paintings. The visual imagery of disloca- tion that these early modernist dandies mapped out has come down to us now in a shifting, sometimes recalcitrant, subversive and provocative masquerade. Fig. 8.

Stettheimer's self-image spells it out for us. If, in Family Portrait, No. 2 (as in other paintings), Stettheimer identifies herself as a painter, here where her mannish painting pyjamas separate her from her jewelled and begowned family, there is also the flineur's location she has chosen for herself at the side of her own painting - at its margin - which offers her the most complete view of the panorama she has constructed for us. Such dandyism in the work of both artists is a dandyism of locations, both psychic and physical, and a resultant dandyism of vision. In each case, objects have been drawn very close: the giant flowers and other floating things have been pushed to the foreground, nearly into our space. At the same time, the imagery, which looms against glowing skies, crowds the canvas. Stettheimer and O'Keeffe both suggest that certain things cannot be contained within boundaries, and so, psyhcologically, their images seem to push viewers back, displacing them. Thus, the viewers of Stettheimer's and O'Keeffe's paintings are brought to share the vision of the modernist artist, the flineur/dandy 'out of place', who privileges the view from the sidelines in images of distancing and dislocation while investing them with insight - and, perhaps, with the glamour of the unattainable. And it is this dandy's consciousness of self and position which made that persona so useful an appropriation for all sorts of modernist dandies and This paper has been brewingfor a very long time; I benefited from the advice, enthusiasm and insights of a great many people. I am grateful to my students at rale and my students in Women, Art and Culture, at Hunter College.

Although female masquerade has been conven- tionally discussed as reification and as a norm of femininity, I am using the alternate reading Doane's analysis provides: as a way of breaking with cliches and a destabilizing tactic. 5.

O'Keeffe's art as we now know it took shape in Greenwich Village circles which included Emma Goldman, Neith Boyce, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman. A letter of August 1915 to Anita Politzer reads, 'then 291 [the Stieglitz Gallery publication] came and I was so crazy about it that I sent for Number 2 and 3 - and I think they are great - they just take my breath away - it is almost as good as going to 291 [Gallery]. I subscribed to it - it was too good to let it go by - and I had to have the Masses too. I got Jerome Eddy [Cubists and Post Impressionism, 1913] a long time ago and sent for Kandinsky.... I got Floyd Dell Women as World Bulders a few days ago and got quite excited over it.' Letter with permission from the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.
