The stele's close affinities to the reliefs of Barrakib argue for a mid-eighth-century B.c. date and the owner 's high position in the kingdom ofSam'al. The scene represented on the stele is in many ways very typical, but some unusual features add to the previously known iconographic repertoire of these monuments. The private architectural context of the KTMW stele in Zincirli 's lower town also contributes to the reconstruction of the setting and social significance of the other steles of this type and allows a tentative comparison with the "mortuary chapels" attested for other forms of memorial in the Syro-Hittite kingdoms. On July 21, 2008, the Neubauer Expedition to Zincirli of the Oriental Institute of the Uni versity of Chicago discovered a basalt stele inscribed with a 13-line Aramaic inscription and a relief scene of a figure seated at a banquet table. Zincirli H?y?k, located in the Gaziantep province of Turkey near modern Islahiye, is identified as the ancient city of Sam^al, the capital of a small Iron Age kingdom (variously called Sam'al, Y'DY, or Bit-Gabbar). The site is situated on the eastern edge of the Amanus Mountains (Nur Daglari) in the valley of the Karasu River, a northern tributary of the Oron tes, about 110 km north-northeast of Antioch (mod ern Antakya) and 125 km west of Carchemish on the Euphrates (fig. 1). It is well known for the numerous stone reliefs, sculptures, and inscriptions discovered during the late 19th-century excavations headed by Felix von Luschan on behalf of the German Orient Comite (fig. 2) (Luschan, Schr?der, and Sachau 1893; Luschan, Humann, and Koldewey 1898; Lu schan 1902; Luschan and Jacoby 1911; Luschan and Andrae 1943). The renewed excavations of the Uni versity of Chicago, directed by David Schloen, be gan in 2006. In contrast to the German expedition's focus on the Iron Age citadel and its palatial build ings and fortifications, the new excavation aims to put the chronology of the site and region on a firmer footing by means of a deep stratigraphic step-trench in the 8-ha citadel mound, which dates back to the third millennium b.c. It is also investigating the organization of the 30-ha Iron Age lower town and patterns of activity there through broad excavated exposures and remote sensing (Schloen and Fink 2007; 2009). It was during the search for ordinary residential neighborhoods in these lower-town exca vations that the expedition was surprised to discover this elite monument. The new stele from Zincirli has many affinities to contemporary works long known from the site and to the large corpus of Syro-Hittite mortuary monu ments that has received a good deal of discussion in the scholarly literature (Orthmann 1971; Genge 1979; Voos 1986; 1988a; 1988b; Bonatz 2000a). It is unique among these monuments, however, in possessing not only a relief and an inscription, but also a well-docu mented, original archaeological context. The sepa rate evidence of text (see the edition by Pardee, this issue), pictorial scene, and context thus combines to make this a very significant monument for the in terpretation of others of its class. In this preliminary 15</page><page sequence="2">STRUBLE AND HERRMANN BASOR 356 Mediterranean Sea . 1. Map of Syro-Hittite sites mentioned in the text. account, the stele is first described in detail, and par allels to the elements and details of the scene are cited, locating it within Syro-Hittite artistic and cul tural traditions. Some contributions that the new stele makes to the discussion of the religious and symbolic significance of this type of monument and the prac tices associated with it are then delineated. Finally, the preliminary information about the stele's archae ological context is described and compared with the available data on the context of other Syro-Hittite mortuary monuments.1 DESCRIPTION, DATING, AND STYLE The new stele from Zincirli was created from a large basalt stone with few vesicular areas, shaped and smoothed on all surfaces, and measures approxi mately 99 cm tall, 72 cm wide, and 25 cm thick (figs. 3, 4). The back is convex, the front flattened, the top curved, and the bottom straight, with a tenon (29 cm wide and 16 cm long) protruding from the center. The front surface is carved in raised relief, with an 1 An extended treatment of the stele, its iconography, and its context will appear in a forthcoming volume of the final report of the Neubauer Expedition to Zincirli. image on the left and an inscription on the right, emerging from a well-smoothed background. The image was carved with attention to detail and finishing, as seen in the smoothed and consistent edges and details, and the overall systematic propor tions within the relief. These careful and fine carving details, as well as the facial proportions, furniture de tails, and clothing worn by the figure (see further dis cussion of details below), are very similar to those found on other Zincirli reliefs of the second half of the eighth century b.c. featuring King Barrakib. This provides strong evidence of a date in the mid to late eighth century b.c. When taken together with the in scription's statement that the stele was made for one "KTMW, servant of Panamuwa," it seems clear that it must date to the reign of Panamuwa II, father of Barrakib, who reigned from ca. 743 to 733/32 b.c., contemporary with Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria (Tropper 1993: 19; Lipiriski 2000: 243-47).2 2 The man pictured on the stele will be referred to as KTMW throughout this article. The inscribed statement of his name in the first person ("I, KTMW, servant of Panamuwa") and the obvious purposeful integration of text and image clearly indicate that the figure is intended to represent KTMW.</page><page sequence="3">2009 AN ETERNAL FEAST AT SAIVPAL 17 Fig. 2. Site plan of Iron Age Sam'al (modern Zincirli H?y?k) showing the outer city wall and central royal citadel exca vated by German archaeologists in the late 19th century (drawn by Robert Koldewey in 1894; from Luschan, Humann, and Koldewey 1898: Taf. 29). The plan is overlaid on a recent Digital Globe "QuickBird" satellite image showing the mod ern village, roads, and fields. Overlaid on both the German site plan and the satellite image are the results of the geo magnetic survey of the lower town conducted by Jason Herrmann of the University of Arkansas in July and August 2007 under the direction of Dr. Jesse Casana. The KTMW stele was found in July 2008 in the north lower town, in Area 5 of the new University of Chicago excavations. The image and inscription are framed by a border (3.0-3.5 cm wide) that forms the edge of the stele's front surface and creates an arch from the bottom left corner to the bottom right where it meets a ground line, enclosing the entirety of the image, inscription, and upper sun-disk panel. The border is a simple raised band, without any observable decoration, al though the tassel and tip of KTMW's hat encroach on it. The topmost section of the border is marred by plow damage (the top of the stele was only 10 cm below the surface of the modern agricultural field in which it was buried). Borders are attested on a number of Syro-Hittite reliefs from various locations and in a variety of</page><page sequence="4">STRUBLE AND HERRMANN BASOR 356 Fig. 3.

The KTMW stele (drawing by Karen Reczuch).</page><page sequence="6">20 STRUBLE AND HERRMANN BASOR 356 forms, but are most common on steles. Such borders framing similar feasting scenes appear on steles from Neirab, Tell Rifacat, Tell al-Maqir, Marash, and from the area near Carchemish, as well as several found in the vicinity of Zincirli.3 The majority of the borders follow the shape of the stone (which are predomi nantly arch-shaped), but examples from Neirab (Bonatz C35) and Zincirli (Bonatz C46 = Orthmann Zincirli K/2) show that exceptions existed (Orth mann 1971; Bonatz 2000a).4 Framing elements such as those on reliefs might be simple artistic convention borrowed from earlier or neighboring cultures, but in the case of mortuary steles they should also be thought of as creating a space in which ritual can take place. These borders mimic the boundaries found in the architecture of the living, symbolizing the liminal space needed for mortuary rituals (Groenewegen-Frankfort 1951: 3, 176; Bonatz 2000a: 157). The intrusion of KTMW's hat into the border creates the impression that he is sitting within an actual physical space, suggesting to the viewer that KTMW is not merely a flat image rendered lifelessly within an artistic frame. In the other mortuary stele from Zincirli, the woman's hat protrudes into the frame in the same manner (Bonatz C46 = Orthmann Zincirli K/2). In these cases, the hats do not completely break the surrounding boundary, which would take away from the impression that the deceased figures occupy a real, bounded, ritual space. At the top of the stele was apparently carved a winged sun-disk (ca. 13.5 cm high), now damaged by modern plowing but still identifiable. The visible remnants of the winged sun-disk are the lower edges of the outspread wings and the two central volutes that are often found at the bottom of winged sun disks. The sun-disk itself is extensively damaged; the damage is made more severe by the presence of flaws in the stone on this top portion of the stele. Individ ual feathers of the wings are not preserved. KTMW's winged sun-disk likely resembled other winged sun-disks found at Zincirli, which typically consist of feathered spread wings and curved or spiral tail feathers attached to a disk that is either undecorated or is filled with a rosette (found on Orth mann Zincirli K/1, K/2, K/ll). Similar sun-disks are 3 Occasionally, other scenes are also framed by borders; examples without feasting are known in steles from Marash (Bonatz C68 = Orthmann Zincirli C/6), Neirab (Bonatz Cl 1), and in orthostats from Zincirli (Orthmann Zincirli F/la, F/lb, K/l, and K/ll). 4 This article will reference carved reliefs by the labels given to them in Bonatz 2000a and Orthmann 1971. commonly dated to the eighth century b.c. and are found on reliefs from Sakceg?z?, Malatya, and Ka ratepe, as well as on ivory carvings attributed to Sam'al (Winter 1973: 314).5 The 13-line inscription on the stele consists of let ters carved in raised relief (see Pardee, this issue). Relief inscriptions are known from the Syro-Hittite period in both Hieroglyphic Luwian and Phoenician Aramaic script. The most similar in terms of the style of carving of the script, and of the size and place ment of the letters, are three royal inscriptions from Zincirli associated with the rulers Kulamuwa and Barrakib (Orthmann Zincirli E/2, K/l, and K/ll). Each of these was carved so that the area with text is integrated with the shape of the figure. Though both incised and raised-relief inscriptions in Hieroglyphic Luwian are found throughout the Syro-Hittite zone, Phoenician-Aramaic relief-carved inscriptions occur only in the vicinity of Zincirli/Sam'al, with one ex ception.6 The dominance of the relief-carved tech nique in Phoenician-Aramaic inscriptions at Zincirli may reflect a desire of elites and/or sculptors to imitate the relief carving style used in Hieroglyphic Luwian inscriptions found near Zincirli at sites such as Pancarh H?y?k and Marash. KTMW wears a conical hat (14 cm high x 14 cm wide) with a pointed tip and a tassel with four pieces of fringe (1.5 cm long) hanging behind the tip (fig. 5). The tassel and tip infringe on the border of the stele. Two lines cross the cap diagonally (converging at the center of the hat), seemingly representing seams.7 A small line along the base of the back of the hat may suggest a lining, as seen under other hats from Zin cirli reliefs, or might be a unique indication of short hair (?zgen 1982: 43, 51, 77, 83, 86). Hats such as KTMW's?both with and without the tassel?are specific to reliefs from Zincirli, depicting elite or royal men and, in one case, a woman.8 These figures with a similar hat are clothed in various types 5 For historical development and symbolism, see Parayre 1987; Winter 1976a; Novak 2001. 6 A raised-relief inscription was found at Tell Sifr, north of Aleppo (Michelini 1962; Naveh 1966). 7 Pointed caps such as those depicted were likely sewn from triangles of leather or fabric (?zgen 1982: 54). 8 There is similarity in overall form between these Zincirli hats and those shown on certain reliefs from Khorsabad, from Sakceg?z?, and from the Karatepe reliefs (Madhloom 1970: pi. 19:20-21). However, the hats shown from these other sites are not identical: the Khorsabad versions have sharply pointed tips or no seams, those from Sakceg?z? have elaborated details, and at Karatepe the hats are either more pointed or do not have the dis tinctly formed bulbous tip, and are elongated.</page><page sequence="7">2009 AN ETERNAL FEAST AT SAMPAL 21 Fig. 5. View of the man's face on the KTMW stele (photograph by Eudora J. Struble). of garments, though long tunics are most common. The hats that are most similar to KTMW's are found on the images of Barrakib and royal officials in a pro cession, found in Hilani III at Zincirli, dating to the eighth century b.c.9 The design of KTMW's hat seems to associate him with the royal court of Sam'al in the late eighth century b.c., consistent with the royal service mentioned in the stele's inscription. Sitting in profile, KTMW faces the right of the stele, measuring 33 cm wide from his back to the front of his left hand. His facial hair consists of a mustache of small, raised, circular curls and a beard of three rows of similar tight curls on his face and long spiral curls hanging down to his raised right arm. His eyebrow is also visible, though it is not as clear as his beard and mustache, and consists of small, raised lines and dots. His lips are clearly shown as 9 Bonatz c46 = Orthmann Zincirli K/2; Bonatz c72 = Orthmann Zincirli J/2; Orthmann Zincirli F/la; Orthmann Zincirli E/2, K/l; Orthmann Zincirli F/9; Orthmann Zincirli H/5, H/6, H/7, H/8, H/9. raised lines, with a slight downward curve of the up per lip. KTMW's neck is visible, with no ornamen tation or hair covering it except his beard. His nose has a slight outward curve along the bridge and a faintly flattened tip that curves to the nostril, which is indicated with a full curved line on the side. His eye is formed by a slightly raised oval shape outlined by a narrow line, somewhat thicker on the top than the bottom, indicating eyelids. His ear is rounded at the top and shows the interior anti-helix. It has a large round lobe, possibly with a trace of a small, round earring. His ear measures approximately 3.5 cm long, and his lips, eye, nose, ear, and eyebrow are all 2.5 cm long. The proportions of KTMW's eye, nose, mouth, cheek, eyebrow, forehead, and lips are nearly identi cal to the proportions of facial features found in a number of reliefs from Zincirli: Orthmann Zincirli K/1, F/9, F/6, F/7, F/8a, and F/la. All of these are scenes of royal or elite figures that date to the eighth century b.c. In sharp contrast is a style of human</page><page sequence="8">22 STRUBLE AND HERRMANN BASOR 356 representation that is found on earlier Zincirli reliefs, typically featuring very large eyes and often small lips and a receding chin (Orthmann 1971: 59-65).10 The beard with mustache and the more realistic ren dering of the human face, as found on the KTMW stele and similar reliefs, suggest close cultural contact between the Syro-Hittite world and the Neo-Assyrian Empire. These stylistic elements are often referred to as "Assyrianizing," although the cultural influences were no doubt bidirectional (Moortgat 1969: 125? 26; Madhloom 1970: 87-88). The most unique feature of KTMW's head is that he does not have the typical locks of hair (in spiral curls, ringlets, or chignons) known in Syro-Hittite art. Until the discovery of the KTMW stele, only the scribe depicted on the Barrakib orthostat (Orthmann Zincirli F/la) and two male priests on steles from Neirab (Bonatz Cll and C35) were available as ex amples of male figures depicted without hair. KTMW is different from these three in that he has a beard and mustache, whereas the other men depicted with out hair do not have facial hair. The inscriptions of the Neirab steles identify the figures as priests (Bonatz 2000a: 67, 68). Aside from the appearance and tools held by the scribe on the Barrakib orthostat and the fact that he is plainly in the service of King Barrakib, nothing else is known about the role or identity of this figure. The sparse information to be gleaned from only these three examples of figures without hair makes it difficult to know what is signified by KTMW's unusual lack of hair, but it is possible that it hints toward his occupation or status at Sam5al. KTMW wears an ankle-length, short-sleeved tu nic. The edges of the sleeves and the bottom of the tunic are undecorated. The neckline is plain, sloping downward at the front and only slightly visible above a second item of clothing which is double-fringed and covers KTMW's shoulder. This fringed garment appears to drape from his back to his front, hanging down the back below the point at which the side of the chair begins, and in the front hangs down his chest between his arms. The double fringe runs along the edge of the garment, around his neck and down his chest, and measures about 2 cm wide. The long tunic is common in Syro-Hittite reliefs, but at times it is pictured with lines in the back, rep resenting gathers, or a belt around the waist (?zgen 1982: 260-61). However, any such details would be impossible to show in this stele due to KTMW's sit 10 See Orthmann 1971 for a detailed analysis and discussion of chronology and style in Syro-Hittite reliefs. ting position and the area obscured by the chair. In many Syro-Hittite reliefs, a long tunic will be cov ered partially or largely by a mantle wrapped several times around the body, creating diagonal lines. Often a smaller overgarment, usually with fringe, will be wrapped around one or both shoulders of a figure and will hang down the chest. The long tunic and fringed wrap appear most frequently associated with royalty or elite individuals (?zgen 1982: 257). KTMW's garments, which appear to be a simple, long tunic with a fringed shawl around one or both shoulders, are most similar to garments worn by some of the processional figures from Hilani III, who also wear a similar hat (discussed above). At Zincirli, the only tunic other than KTMW's that is without embellish ment or indications of draped fabric is that worn by the attendant in the mortuary relief of a seated woman, on a stele found by the German excavations on the citadel mound (Bonatz C46 = Orthmann Zincirli K/2). KTMW's feet emerge from his long tunic and rest on a footstool, with the right foot placed slightly back from the left foot, to allow for both feet to be shown in profile in a natural way (Groenewegen Frankfort 1951: 3-4, 18).11 The toes, which do not quite reach the end of the footstool, are straight (not upturned). Very faint indications of some kind of footwear are present, detectable in the small horizon tal lines at the top of the feet, an arched shape on the middle of the right foot, and angled lines at the ankles and on the sides of the feet. The feet are ap proximately 3.5 cm high and 17 cm from the back heel to the front of the forward foot. It is difficult to discuss precise parallels for the footwear, since its form is no longer truly discern ible; however, the faint lines that remain suggest that KTMW is wearing low boots of some sort, which clearly do not have upturned toes. Shoes in a variety 11 Feet in Syro-Hittite reliefs are most commonly shown with one foot totally in front of the other, an unnatural pose while sta tionary, or occasionally with only the closest foot in profile view and the other invisible. The position of KTMW's feet, offset side by side, is found very rarely in Syro-Hittite reliefs; it is clearly dis cernible in a relief from Zincirli (Orthmann Zincirli F/la), one from the Tell Rifacat region (Bonatz C15), and one incised relief from the Carchemish-Yunus cemetery (Bonatz C45 = Orthmann Carchemish L/l). There are few similarities among these various reliefs, but there is a marked similarity between Orthmann's Zin cirli F/la and the KTMW stele in terms of foot placement, bodily proportions, carving technique, and certain details of the figure (such as hat and beard). It is difficult to discern any symbolic meaning for the placement of the feet in the offset manner with so few examples available to study among the Syro-Hittite reliefs.</page><page sequence="9">2009 AN ETERNAL FEAST AT SAM'AL 23 of forms are seen in Syro-Hittite reliefs, often indi cated by parallel lines on the side of the foot, or cir cular indications of cutouts (?zgen 1982: 78, 84). Some Syro-Hittite reliefs, from sites such as Carche mish, Marash, Tell Halaf, and from Zincirli, continue the Hittite-period tradition of footwear with upturned toes (Orthmann 1971; Akurgal 2001). At Zincirli, shoes are depicted as dramatically upturned in Orth mann's Periode Sph. I?II; but as time progressed, in Orthmann's Periode Sph. Ill, shoes were more com monly shown as straight or with small upturns or curls at the toe (Orthmann 1971: 59-65). KTMW's arms are held out in front of his body with slightly bent elbows. The right arm is higher than the left, positioned holding a drinking vessel that rests on his very long, extended index finger and is supported at the back by his thumb, the three other fingers being bent away from the viewer. The left hand is curled around a stalk, with thumb pointed forward and the four fingers turned toward the viewer. All fingertips that are shown are carved with distinct fingernails. No jewelry is depicted on the arms or hands. In most Syro-Hittite feasting scenes, as in the new relief from Zincirli, a figure holds a drinking vessel in his or her right hand, typically at mouth level. A vessel is usually also held in the right hands of figures represented by mortuary statues. These vessels are frequently held with the hand cupped into a V-shape, or, less often, with all the fingers of the hand clasped around the side of the vessel. The po sition of KTMW's right hand, with long index finger extended underneath and thumb bracing the back of the vessel, is not common but is found locally on one of the fragmentary carved and inscribed Barrakib reliefs from Zincirli (Orthmann Zincirli K/l 1). A re lief from G?zl?h?y?k-tslahiye also shows this hand position, holding a similar vessel (Bonatz C28). This type of gesture, with an extended index finger, is known from Assyrian royal images and from Zin cirli, and is seen as an indication of piety toward the deities (Shafer 1998: 57-59). KTMW's gesture of the extended index finger may have been a con scious inclusion of an honorific symbol related to the increasing Neo-Assyrian influence in the region. The awkwardness of holding the vessel balanced in this way adds weight to the idea that the gesture itself was intended to convey some message. However, as this gesture as an act of piety is typically made with out an object in the hand, KTMW's grasping of the vessel with an extended finger may yet have been only an indirect artistic echo of this pious gesture (Shafer 1998: 57-59). In Syro-Hittite art, represen tation of the right side of the body is favored over the left, with men shown far more often with their right sides toward the viewer and most vessels held in the right hand. KTMW's position also favors his right side, with his grasp on the vessel in his right hand, adding emphasis to the symbol of wine con sumption (Bonatz 2000a: 111-12; Akurgal 2001: 131). The vessel in KTMW's right hand has a curved bottom and gadroons on the body beneath the flared rim (5.5 cm high x 8.0-9.5 cm wide). The gadroons are represented by eight raised bulges. Although there are some very faint indications that more details were originally present on the vessel, they are too unclear to permit identification of any further specific deco rative elements. Gadrooned vessels like that held by KTMW have been discovered in Babylonia, Assyria, Phrygia, and the Syro-Hittite region. They are commonly referred to as phialai. Muscarella and Mellink suggest that this vessel is a hallmark of eighth-century b.c. Phry gian culture; the vessel does become widely popular in this period (Braun-Holzinger 1988; Muscarella 1988). These cups are not the most common drinking vessels shown in Syro-Hittite reliefs, however. The majority of the vessels depicted are deeper and more V-shaped, as seen in the Marash mortuary reliefs and in the other Zincirli mortuary relief (Bonatz C46 = Orthmann Zincirli K/2). Phialai somewhat similar to KTMW's are seen in mortuary reliefs from G?zl? h?y?k-islahiye (Bonatz C28) and Marash (Bonatz C42). Metal phialai or phiale fragments that bear a resemblance to KTMW's drinking cup have been found at Assur (Andrae 1977: 186), Tell Halaf (M?ller 1950: 100-103; Hrouda 1962: 55, pis. 43, 50), Deve H?y?k (Moorey 1980), Gordion (Muscarella 1988), and Zincirli (Luschan and Andrae 1943: pis. 51, 56), most commonly made of bronze. In his left hand, KTMW holds a curved branch or stem to which an oval object is attached. He grasps the branch with his fingers curled, holding his left arm lower than his right. Several Syro-Hittite reliefs that depict mortuary rituals, meals, or presentation scenes portray a figure with a similar grip on some kind of botanical object: a flower, an ear of wheat, a bunch of grapes, or a pomegranate.12 Flowers are typically held on an analogous drooping stem in mor tuary reliefs, thought to be symbolic of the deceased 12 Women in Syro-Hittite images often hold a spindle, distaff, or mirror, rather than a plant (Bonatz 2000a: 79-86; Mazzoni 2005).</page><page sequence="10">24 STRUBLE AND HERRMANN BASOR 356 or the concept of death (van Loon 1986). The Zincirli orthostat that depicts Barrakib and his scribe por trays a comparable hand and arm gesture with a closed fist extended, but without an object in the scribe's hand. This type of gesture, without an ob ject, is known from Hittite and Assyrian contexts and conveys an honorific or worshipful attitude (Cifarelli 1998: 216-17). As in the case of KTMW's right-hand gesture, the presence of an object in his left hand makes it less convincing to interpret the gesture as purely one of honor or worship. In the instance of the left-hand gesture, which represents one of the most intuitive ways to grasp such a stick-like object, it is even more likely that the familiar hand position was artistic convention and was not primarily meant to convey the message intended by an empty hand in the same position. The object held in KTMW's left hand is shown with the oval tipped slightly away from his body and the branch itself (10.5 cm long x 1 cm wide) curved slightly forward. The oval is crosshatched with diag onal lines: five going from top left to bottom right, and five from right to left. The oval measures 7.5 cm long and 4 cm wide. As mentioned above, this oval object on a branch occurs in the position where a lotus flower or grain stalk commonly appears in other reliefs, suggesting that the object is also botanical. It most resembles a cone from a coniferous tree?a fir, cedar, or pine? trees that flourished in the Amanus Mountains near Zincirli (Meiggs 1982: 41-44).13 Parallels for this cone on its branch are not common in the known art of the Syro-Hittite world, but similar examples can be found on two steles currently in the National Syr ian Museum in Aleppo, both depicting the Storm God or perhaps the Moon God, deities known for syncretism in their representations (Barnett 1948; 13 The tipped branch attached to the oval is paralleled by the stem of the flowers held in some reliefs, suggesting the object is a plant, though it is distinctly different from the flaring flowers sometimes held. Other items commonly held in Syro-Hittite reliefs consists of grapes hanging down from the bottom of the clasped hand or a stalk of wheat emerging vertically from the top of the hand. The oval on the KTMW stele is similar to these grapes in its general shape, but the grape bunches are clearly different in that they droop or hang heavily downward and are composed of round bumps. The wheat is also distinct from the oval on this stele, since the wheat is very straight, narrow, and has fringe-like lines along its length. The authors do not rule out the possibility that the object may be some other type of vegetation of a form similar to the conifer cone; possibilities including flowering thistles, lesser known food plants, and native flowers. It is hoped that future evi dence will illuminate this identification further. Nov?k 2001; Bunnens 2006: 70-73).14 On these two reliefs, the deities hold ovals on straight branches in their right hands. The straight branch with at tached oval has an appearance similar to certain Neo-Assyrian maces and a scepter from Urartu, but, since KTMW's branch is curved, a mace or scepter is quite unlikely in this instance (Madhloom 1970: 61-63, pi. 31; Belli and Kavakh 1979). Examples of objects resembling cones are numer ous in Neo-Assyrian art, with some found in Syro Hittite reliefs as well; however, these objects do not appear on branches or stalks.15 These cone-like objects are typically slightly more pointed at the ends and are held most often in the hands of genii or bird-men, pointed outward from the holder's body (fig. 6) (Porter 2003). Such pointed ovals are thought to be used in an act of pollinating date palms and/or as an aspergillum for ritual purification (suggestions include the sprinkling of oil or water) (Russell 1998: 691-92; Porter 2003: 11-20). The nature of these oval objects continues to be debated, but most often they are identified by scholars as either date-palm flower clusters (sometimes called a date spathe or a date palm inflorescence) or as conifer cones (Russell 1998: 691-92; Porter 2003). The resemblance of these cones, as well as KTMW's, to conifer cones is strik ing, however, and it is well established that conifer ous trees were a valued resource and played a role in trade and in ritual (fig. 7) (Meiggs 1982: 41-44; More and White 2002: 260-61). Though the possibility re mains that the Neo-Assyrian ovals are intended to represent date-palm flowers, real date-palm flowers are not convincingly similar in appearance to the objects depicted in the reliefs.16 14 The Storm God stele is from Djekke (Barnett 1948). The Moon God stele's findspot is not known (museum number: 6542M). The Djekke stele inscription contains a personal name that refer ences the Sun God (Hutter 2003: 227). 15 Examples are known from Sakceg?z? (Orthmann 1971: Taf. 49, 50) and the Storm God temple at Aleppo (Kohlmeyer 2000: Taf. 19). The relief from Aleppo is an interesting and unique case, as the oval object is held in the hand in a manner that suggests a branch or stalk is present, but no indication of the branch is vis ible. The hand also holds the oval upright, rather than pointed forward. 16 In order to understand these ovals as date-palm flowers, one would have to assume they were highly stylized to the point of being dramatically different from the real object in appearance; open date-palm flower clusters look like several long branches of small flowers gathered together, and when the date-palm inflores cence is not yet opened, it is a plain, leathery, boat-shaped husk (similar in appearance, though not in size, to an ear of corn in its husk) (Riffle and Craft 2003: 400). In addition, the size of the</page><page sequence="11">2009 AN ETERNAL FEAST AT SA1VPAL 25 Fig. 6. Neo-Assyrian Genius from Nimrud, holding an oval object resembling a conifer cone. Courtesy of The Oriental Institute Museum, adapted from Layard 1853: pi. 36. Another parallel for KTMW's branch and oval is found on a later, fifth-century b.c. altar slab from Nev?ehir, Turkey. Among the many symbols depicted on this altar is a forked branch with a cone on the tip of each of the two forks. This example is particularly flower clusters is quite large (up to 4 feet in length is not un common), so either the object size or the stature of the Neo Assyrians represented would need to be skewed in these repre sentations (fig. 6) (Riffle and Craft 2003: 402). The absence of other highly stylized elements on the stele, and the lack of simi larity of the ovals on the reliefs to the actual appearance of date-palm flowers, make this identification less likely; a closer parallel is found in the observable similarity of the ovals shown on Neo-Assyrian reliefs to conifer cones (often closely resem bling fir or cedar cones), and of KTMW's oval and branch to a needleless conifer branch and its cone (most closely similar to pinecones). Fig. 7. Conifer cone (pine) on a branch (photograph by Eudora J. Struble). interesting because the two cones appear to be of dif ferent forms, perhaps resembling the variation be tween male and female cone types from a coniferous tree (More and White 2002: 204-6). Also later in date, in continuing religious traditions in Greek and Ro man art, a pinecone appears on the top of the thyrsus staff carried by Dionysus/Bacchus (Kestemont 1983; Kalke 1985). KTMW sits in a straight-backed chair with three horizontal bars representing the armrest, seat, and supporting cross-bar. The front leg of the chair is an gled slightly forward. The chair has squared arm rests, and the top of the back ends in a squared notch (1.5 cm). No decoration is visible on the chair or between the support slats. The chair back measures about 45 cm high, and the widest point of the chair (at the base) is about 28 cm.</page><page sequence="12">26 STRUBLE AND HERRMANN BASOR 356 In contrast to the Anatolian-influenced folding chairs seen on reliefs from Malatya and Marash, the KTMW stele shows a chair of solid construction, more common in the Syro-Hittite region and associ ated with eighth-century Aramaean and Phoenician furniture (Gubel 1996; Symington 1996). Although Hittite tradition favored stools for women and throne like chairs for men, the Syro-Hittite reliefs do not reflect such a clear association of one kind or the other with a particular gender (Symington 1996). For example, high-backed chairs with horizontal supports similar to KTMW's are found on a gold pendant and on the second mortuary relief from Zincirli (Bonatz C46 = Orthmann Zincirli K/2). The atypical squared notch at the top of KTMW's chair is also paralleled by the chair in this other Zincirli mortuary relief. Unlike the solid chairs seen in most other Zincirli reliefs, KTMW's chair does not seem to have deco rated side panels, nor does it have decorated feet. The simpler design of his chair might be attributable to the non-royal nature of the KTMW stele and of KTMW himself (Symington 1996). The table in front of KTMW has a rectangular top, with no apparent ornamentation, solid legs topped by banded column capitals, and a knobbed central support (fig. 8). The left leg of the table terminates behind KTMW's left foot, and the right table leg meets the groundline. The tabletop measures 27 cm wide, and from 2.5 to 3 cm thick. From the ground line to the top of the table is approximately 25 cm. The Luwian hieroglyph for "table" shows a fold ing table, a concept that continued to influence the appearance of tables even as Aramaean and Phoe nician influence increased (Symington 1996). Syro Hittite reliefs from most sites show both folding and nonfolding tables, the exception being Karatepe, where only solid tables are depicted (Symington 1996). No clear connection can yet be made between gender or status and the type of table depicted in feasting scenes, though there does seem to be an in crease in nonfolding tables over time and in Phoe nician culture (Gubel 1996; Symington 1996). The abundance of different configurations of furnishings suggests that there is not a standard for which type of table, footstool, or chair should be shown with any other specific style of furnishing. This is evi denced by the similarity of the chair and footstool on the KTMW stele with those on the second Zincirli mortuary relief (Bonatz C46 = Orthmann Zincirli K/2), even though KTMW's solid table is quite different from the more ornate folding table of the seated woman depicted in the latter stele. The elaborateness of the woman's table in contrast to KTMW's may suggest that she possessed higher status or wealth? perhaps she was a queen, as has been suggested on the basis of the findspot of her stele near the oldest "hilani" palace on the royal citadel at Zincirli. The material used to make such tables probably consisted of wood and/or ivory, as indicated by the remnants of tables found in the Phoenician and Syro-Hittite re gions (Gubel 1987; 1996). Ivory table legs found at Zincirli in Palace J vaguely resemble those seen on the KTMW stele and are dated to the ninth century b.c. (Symington 1996). KTMW's feet rest on a footstool. It has a half circle cutout in the bottom center. In addition, near the left and right bottom edges of the footstool there are very faint traces of carving that suggest that originally there may have been a small leaf or oblong circle on each side. The top front corner of the foot stool is slightly rounded. The stool is about 3.5 cm high and 18 cm wide. The chairs in Syro-Hittite reliefs are often quite tall, so the feet of the figures would not have a place to rest without the inclusion of a footstool (Syming ton 1996). Footstools similar in form to the one carved on the KTMW stele are shown on steles from other Syro-Hittite sites, such as Marash (Bonatz C33, C53) and a site near Islahiye (Bonatz C30), but signifi cantly are also depicted on objects from elite con texts at Zincirli, such as on a gold pendant and on Orthmann's Zincirli K/2?both scenes of ceremonial meals (Symington 1996). Furnishings such as foot stools may have been manufactured in wood, but the discovery at Zincirli of an ivory footstool, and in Assyria of metal versions, suggests that in certain contexts it was preferable to create such objects in more valuable materials (Curtis 1996; Symington 1996). On the left side of the table sits a container with a lid, measuring 4 cm high x 5 cm wide. The lid is indicated by a straight horizontal line. A knob on top of the container (1 cm high) is not in raised relief but is incised to meet the center top of the lid. A circle is incised on the center of the body of the con tainer. Very faint hints of shallowly carved lines may indicate further decoration around the incised circle, but the indistinct appearance makes it impossible to clearly identify. This type of small container is shown on several of the tables in Syro-Hittite feasting scenes. Exam ples are known from Zincirli (Bonatz C46 = Orthmann Zincirli K/2), Marash (Bonatz C60 = Orthmann Ma rash C/l), Tell Ahmar (Bonatz C39), Neirab (Bonatz</page><page sequence="13">2009 AN ETERNAL FEAST AT SAM'AL 27 Fig. 8. View of the feast and table on the KTMW stele (photograph by Eudora J. Struble). C35), G?zl?h?y?k-Islahiye (Bonatz C28), from near Tell Rifacat (Bonatz C15), and from an unknown source acquired near Mosul (Bonatz C16). This kind of container is also depicted on Neo-Assyrian reliefs, such as on a feasting scene featuring Assur banipal (Bonatz 2000a: 63). In the feasting images featuring this container, it is usually closest to the primary figure on the stele (seated or reclining) and is smaller than all of the other items on the table. When the preservation of the images is adequate, a</page><page sequence="14">28 STRUBLE AND HERRMANN BASOR 356 lid and decorative elements are sometimes visible, as in the Assurbanipal relief. These relief-carved con tainers are possibly intended to represent cylindrical boxes, known as pyxides, examples of which have been excavated at Syro-Hittite and Assyrian sites (Tell Rifacat, Tell Halaf, Carchemish, Gercin, and Nimrud, among others). Pyxides have been found in ivory, precious metal, and stone that is often a green color (Mazzoni 2001). The pyxides are lidded and are frequently decorated with rosettes, incised circles, or animals on the lid and sides (Winter 1988; Mazzoni 2001). Mazzoni (2001) dates the main production and use of the Syro-Hittite figure-decorated pyxides to the tenth and ninth centuries b.c., with some pyxides, more simply decorated, dating to the eighth century b.c. The example of a pyxis found within an elite male's grave at Tell Halaf suggests that pyxides were not just symbols placed on mortuary reliefs, but had some real role in Syro-Hittite mortuary rites. The details of this role are not yet firmly established, but the numerous mortuary scenes that depict these pyxides near the honored deceased hint at an important function for these objects. The identity of the contents of the pyxides is also not confirmed, but it has been sug gested that they were used for cosmetics (Mazzoni 2001). Another possibility for the contents is incense or the oils common in Hittite and Mesopotamian rituals, especially funerary rites (Scurlock 2002; van den Hout 1994). Alternatively, the appearance of the container on a table otherwise laden with food may suggest that such containers held a condiment or some other foodstuff, such as spices. A bird, seemingly some kind of water fowl with its head turned back across its wing, is shown placed on a footed vessel near the center of the table. A single line is carved to separate the wing from the body and to depict the bird's long, curved neck and its rounded head with a bill. There are faint remnants of the bird's eye and a line between the face and the bill, but no other details are apparent. The foot of the vessel is trumpet-shaped, narrowing toward its join with the bowl. The vessel and bird are approximately 8 cm in height and 8 cm wide. Syro-Hittite mortuary reliefs that portray some type of meat on a feasting table typically depict water fowl, fish, or sheep. Fish, relatively rare, ap pear when there is at least one female, such as in the Zincirli woman's mortuary relief (Bonatz C46 = Orthmann Zincirli K/2), while fowl and sheep are more plentiful and widely distributed (Bonatz 2000a: 94-95). When meat is shown, it is typically de pic ted either on top of a stack of curved objects? presumably loaves of bread or cakes (Bonatz C27, C25, C35, etc.)?or sitting in a separate vessel, usu ally footed (Bonatz C46 = Orthmann Zincirli K/2, Bonatz C28, and the KTMW stele). Footed, open vessels similar to the ones pictured on mortuary re liefs are common in both ceramic and stoneware in the Syro-Hittite zone during the Iron Age. At the right side of KTMW's table is a stack of four objects, three curved and nested and one oblong (pro late spheroid) on top of the other three. The three curved objects vary from 2 to 2.5 cm thick, and the oblong object on top is 3 cm high and 5 cm wide; the stack as a whole is 12.5 cm wide and 9.5 cm high. No details are visible on the oblong or curved objects. Such curved and stacked objects are common in meal scenes across the Near East, sometimes piled on a curved vessel.17 Their identification as bread or cakes is derived from the numerous mentions of bread or baked goods in texts referring to many types of meals and rituals. The curved shape is thought to indicate a type of pliable flatbread, like modern pita bread (Bonatz 2000a: 92-96). The oblong object at the top of the stack is perhaps another baked good or a shaped ball of an associated food product.18 The stacked bread and associated rounded objects are ubiquitous in meal scenes, including Syro-Hittite mortuary steles (Bonatz 2000a: 92-94). The number of pieces of bread and oval objects in the stack varies greatly, and there does not yet appear to be any clear connection between any other aspect of a stele and the particular quantity of bread and ovals shown. The image of KTMW seated alone at a feasting table positions his stele firmly within Bonatz's ex isting classification system, belonging to his Stelen bildtyp 2a (Bonatz 2000a: 17-18,114-15). This group of mortuary reliefs comprises images of a single fig ure seated in front of a feasting table seemingly rep resenting the feeding of the deceased after death. The presentation of KTMW in profile is strik ingly similar in relative proportions, arm and hand 17 The presence of vessels under many of the stacks of objects in feasting scenes, and the clear curvature of the two top curved objects on the KTMW stele, may indicate that the bottom ob ject is intended to be a vessel (e.g., a flat-bottomed stone bowl), although no specific details of the bottom object mark it as differ ent from the other two or define it as a vessel. 18 The rounded objects on the stacked bread could represent some sort of foodstuff to go along with the bread, rather than an other type of baked good. One possibility might be seen in the Hittite funerary ritual that calls for "oil cakes" to be placed on top of stacks of bread (van den Hout 1994: 60).</page><page sequence="15">2009 AN ETERNAL FEAST AT SAM'AL 29 gestures, and in carving style and technique to the other known mortuary relief from Zincirli (Bonatz C46 = Orthmann Zincirli K/2) and to the reliefs por traying King Barrakib. Details of the representa tions of hair, furniture, garments, and the proportions of face and body place the KTMW stele stylisti cally alongside the objects in Orthmann's Stilgruppe Ill/Periode Sph. Illb.19 The chronology of Orthmann's Stilgruppe Ill/Periode Sph. Illb supports the late eighth-century B.c. date arrived at for the KTMW stele if the king referred to in the text is identified as Panamuwa II (Orthmann 1971: 63-65). The simi larity of the KTMW stele to the royal and elite reliefs from Zincirli in Orthmann's Stilgruppe Ill/Periode Sph. Illb also indicates a connection, if not identity, between the carvers of those reliefs and those who created the KTMW stele (Winter 1975). THE SYRO-HITTITE BANQUET SCENE The corpus of Syro-Hittite steles depicting one or more figures seated at a table laden with food, along with the thematically related statues in the round of seated figures,20 has been extensively studied in the past few decades, from both stylistic and chrono logical (Orthmann 1971; Winter 1973; Genge 1979) as well as iconographical and iconological perspec tives (Orthmann 1971: 373-93; Voos 1986;21 1988a; 1988b; Bonatz 2000a; 2000b). From early on in the period of their rediscovery, this group of steles origi nating in northern Syria and southeastern Turkey has been almost universally recognized as represent ing personal mortuary or memorial monuments (Hu mann and Puchstein 1890: 387; Luschan and Jacoby 1911: 325-30; Meyer 1914; Moortgat 1932; Akurgal 1949; Naumann 1950: 395). Due to the absence or vagueness of the provenience of most of the steles? none of which, until now, was found in situ in a well-documented excavation?this conclusion has been based to a greater extent on the form, inscrip 19 Bonatz C46 - Orthmann Zincirli K/2 has many similarities to the KTMW stele, but Orthmann puts it into the Stilgruppe IV cate gory, analyzing the people pictured as having more of the muscula ture and lively postures that he defines as belonging to Stilgruppe IV. Nonetheless, Orthmann, Winter, and others see K/2 as bearing traits of Stilgruppe III (Orthmann 1971; Winter 1975). 20 Recently augmented by further examples: Schachner, Schachner, and Karabulut 2002; Schachner and Bucak 2005; R?llig 2003. 21 This unpublished dissertation was unfortunately unavailable to the authors during the composition of this article, so the citations of Voos's contributions are taken from his summary articles (Voos 1988a; 1988b), except where clearly cited by other authors. tional content, and iconography of the steles, than on the association of a few examples with mortuary remains22 (Orthmann 1971: 376; Voos 1988b: 348; Bonatz 2000a: 151). The form of well-preserved examples as freestanding steles (sometimes with a tenon, as in the case of the KTMW stele), rather than as orthostats intended to be incorporated into a larger architectural context or frieze, such as those found in gates and passages at Zincirli, Carchemish, and Tell Halaf, argues for their identification as memorials for individuals intended to mark a particular loca tion, presumably, in many instances, the actual grave site (Orthmann 1971: 376; Bonatz 2000a: 158). The Aramaic inscriptions of the two steles from Neirab (KAI 225, 276), which make it clear that the speakers are deceased and that these steles stood at their grave sites, have also been very influential in the mortuary interpretation of the many uninscribed ex amples showing similar scenes (Orthmann 1971: 379; Hawkins 1980: 215-16; Voos 1988b: 359). In the new inscription from Zincirli, the author also strongly im plies that the stele is intended to represent him after his death (Pardee, this issue) and thus adds a further confirmation to this supposition. An equally important factor for the interpretation of the significance of the Syro-Hittite steles, how ever, has been the subject matter of the scene de picted on most examples. The seated figures partake of an apparently cultic meal, but seem to represent human beings, as they lack the attributes of deities (Orthmann 1971: 374; Bonatz 2000a: 115, 157, pace Voos 1988b: 357, who interprets female figures as goddesses of fate). This meal can plausibly be re lated to the funerary or mortuary meal described in texts from several regions and periods of the ancient Near East (Orthmann 1971: 378; Voos 1988b: 362; Bonatz 2000a: 92-94).23 Royal funerary and mortu ary rituals from Ebla, Hattusa, and Ugarit, as well as 22 Examples known to have been associated with mortuary remains are two small steles and "three or four" basalt slabs with "cup-hollows" that may have served as bases for further steles from the cremation cemetery of Carchemish-Yunus (Woolley 1939 1940: 14, pis. 3.2, 3.4); a stele from Marash reportedly discovered with the remains of a cremation burial (Humann and Puchstein 1890: 387); the two inscribed steles from Neirab apparently dis covered in proximity to a basalt sarcophagus containing the re mains of two persons (Clermont-Ganneau 1897: 182-85); a stele from Tell Rifacat (Arpad) reportedly found in association with an "Aramean grave" (Seton-Williams 1961: pi. 33b); and the stele of a seated woman from Zincirli, found near an empty stone cist grave next to Hilani I (Luschan and Jacoby 1911: 325-27). 23 The banquet scene, which appears in a variety of media (not only stone reliefs, but also cosmetic containers, ivories, jewelry,</page><page sequence="16">30 STRUBLE AND HERRMANN BASOR 356 the kispum ritual for deceased ancestors in Mesopo tamia, stipulate food and drink offerings to nourish the deceased in the afterlife, and the documentation of this need for sustenance after death, including scenes of the deceased seated before food- and drink laden tables, is abundant in all periods in Egypt (see citations in Bonatz 2000a: 92-96). The potential cultural, religious, and iconographic sources for the practice and depiction of the mortuary meal in the Iron Age Syro-Hittite states are so extensive and in tertwined that it is difficult to untangle from this a single definitive strand of influence, but it seems that the Syro-Hittite phenomenon was based on traditional themes (Orthmann 1971: 380-91; Bonatz 2000a: 50 60, 92-94, 142-44, 168-79; 2000b). Its innovations lie rather in the newfound centrality of this meal in the art of the region, details of its form and iconog raphy, and the broader social circle represented as participants (see below). The banquet scene shown on the Syro-Hittite steles has been understood not only as symbolic of the afterlife of the deceased (Bonatz's "prospektive Sicht" of the deceased; 2000a: 115-17), but as a pre scription for the proper ritual actions to be carried out in its presence?namely, food and drink offerings (Voos 1988b: 361; Bonatz 2000a: 115-17). Bonatz argues that the representation of smaller, standing figures on many reliefs, whom he convincingly inter prets as the surviving heirs of the deceased (2000a: 103-5, 116-17),24 interacting with the deceased fig and glyptic) in Syro-Hittite art, as well as in the third- and sec ond-millennium Near East, need not always have had mortuary connotations, nor did it always include human participants (Win ter 1976a: n. 59; Ziffer 2005; Sass 2007; Bonatz 2000a: 46-64, 140-42), but such an interpretation for the freestanding steles seems very plausible in light of the other evidence already men tioned (and see Mazzoni's [2005: 5-6] suggestion that certain cosmetic containers and bowls with depictions of banquet scenes may have been made specifically for mortuary use). 24 The small, standing frond- or fan-bearers have been inter preted variously simply as servants designating the status of the deceased (Orthmann 1971: 375; Voos 1988a: 358) or as adorants or priests (Moortgat 1932), but Bonatz makes a convincing argu ment that they represent the deceased's heir, charged with the execution of the funerary and ancestor rites (2000a: 103-4). The congruence in the new stele from Zincirli (Bonatz's Stelenbildtyp 2a) between the lack of a standing attendant in the relief scene and the statement in the inscription that the deceased himself was the commissioner of the monument, accompanied by a certain vague ness about "whoever of my sons or of the sons of anybody (else)" (lines 6-7, Pardee, this issue) ought to carry out the annual offer ing-rituals (perhaps indicating that no clear heir had yet emerged among KTMW's progeny), seems to support Bonatz's hypothesis, albeit via negative evidence. ures, also suggests the practice of evocation of the dead and necromancy at the memorial site (2000a: 116-17; cf. Tropper 1989; Loretz 1993; Schmidt 1994). He claims that the separation between the living and the dead was understood as spatial rather than temporal (2000a: 156; cf. Jonker 1995: 189) and describes the steles as "Grenzsteine" (2000a: 157), where living and dead met and interacted through ritual. The new monument from Zincirli is the first in scribed Syro-Hittite mortuary stele to give explicit information about the rituals expected to be performed in its presence, including the nature and quantity of the offerings, as well as their recipients, practitioners, fre quency, and source (see Pardee, this issue). The long assumed connection between the banquet scene and an actual mortuary meal of food and drink offerings is thus confirmed by this document (pace Keste mont 1983: 59), though it is interesting to note that the meal depicted on the stele of bread or cakes, a duck or other water bird, an unknown substance con tained in a pyxis, and wine does not correlate pre cisely with the offerings prescribed for KTMW: a leg-cut of mutton and grapes or wine (lines 8-13). At least in this case, the suggestion of both Orthmann (1971: 378) and Voos (1988b: 361) that the image of the mortuary meal could substitute for actual offer ings seems to be contradicted. The offerings were intended to be annual in perpetuity (line 10), not lim ited to the time of death and burial, and seem to have been supported by an endowment of some sort (line 9).25 The fact that only one of the other Syro-Hittite mortuary steles that bear inscriptions (Bonatz 2000a: 66-69; Hawkins 1980; 1989; 2000) mentions food or drink offerings26 suggests that we should be cau tious in assuming offerings similar in nature and frequency for all of the mortuary steles, however. The mandate of food and drink offerings in the royal mortuary inscription of Panamuwa I of Sam'al on a statue of Hadad from Gercin27 (KAI 214: lines 17, 25 Compare, for example, the mortuary establishments of Hittite royalty with extensive properties and personnel for their support (van den Hout 1994: 48; 2002: 75, 86-87). 26 The Hieroglyphic Luwian inscription on the undecorated stele Kululu 3 seems to say that bread was provided for its owner (Hawkins 1989: 191; 2000: 490-91), while on the similar stele Kululu 2, the deceased author makes only an obscure reference to eating and drinking on his bed when he died (Hawkins 1980: 220; 2000: 488). 27 It may be significant that the three intelligible funerary inscriptions from the kingdom of Y'DY, the Gercin inscription of Panamuwa I, the Tahtah Pinar inscription by Barrakib for his father Panamuwa II (KAI 215; Gibson 1975: 76-86; Tropper</page><page sequence="17">2009 AN ETERNAL FEAST AT SAM'AL 31 21-22; Tropper 1993: 154-58) has been compared to the iconography of the (often non-royal) banquet steles, but the common meal of god and deceased king alluded to in this text has been thought to be an exclusively royal privilege, representing the deifica tion of the king (Orthmann 1971: 378; Voos 1988b: 349; cf. Niehr 1994: 62; 2001; 2006). The offerings dictated by the KTMW inscription simultaneously for several deities and for KTMW's own 'soul' (lines 2-5), however, seem to indicate a commonality be tween the mortuary cult of the king and non-royal persons that calls into question the drawing of hard lines between the 'deification' of deceased kings and the status of non-royal deceased (Pardee, this issue).28 In addition to the overall image of the mortuary meal, individual elements of these mortuary scenes have been interpreted as symbols of regeneration and fertility, thus continuation of life after death (Orth mann 1971; Kestemont 1983; Voos 1988b; Bonatz 2000a). Other elements might signify ritual purifica tion, worship of, or allegiance to, a particular deity, or they may make a statement about the deceased's vocation during life (Bonatz 2000a: 76-107). The creators of Syro-Hittite monuments seem to have carefully thought through the ways in which a deceased person could continue to earn the favor of deities and appease them. KTMW demonstrates this in his inscribed instructions, but also in the iconog raphy of his stele. At the top of the stele would have been a noticeable statement of his association with, or allegiance to, the Sun God. The winged sun-disk in Syro-Hittite culture is understood to represent a connection with a celestial deity, most often the Sun God, but through syncretism it may also have some association with the Moon God29 (Novak 2001; Bunnens 2006: 70-73). In the Aramaean world, the Sun God is identified as Sams, mentioned in the 1993: 159-62), and now the new inscription of KTMW, are the only Syro-Hittite funerary inscriptions to detail food and drink offerings for the deceased. 28 Cf. Dion's hypothesis that the mortuary cult for deceased kings was merely an "intensification" of that of non-royal people (1997: 268). He still expects, though, that a common meal with Hadad, the head of the pantheon, would have been a royal privi lege, while lesser people would have eaten with lesser gods (1997: 268-69), but at least certain versions of Hadad are among the gods for whom the KTMW inscription prescribes offerings (lines 3-4). 29 Bunnens (2006) notes that the winged sun-disk may also have a connection with the Storm God. In Syro-Hittite culture, however, the dominant association is between the winged sun disk and the Sun God. KTMW text as one of the gods who should receive offerings (Lipinski 2000: 623-26). KTMW's posi tion seated beneath the winged sun-disk might thus best be understood as an invocation of the protection of the Sun God Sams, as well as a statement about his dedication to, and/or worship of, Sams. Another item pictured on the stele that can be con nected with religious action and purification is the waterfowl in a bowl on KTMW's table. The image of waterfowl (thought to be either goose or duck) on Syro-Hittite mortuary reliefs may represent the opportunity for purification, with the bird acting as a substitute to take and remove the impurities from someone (Bonatz 2000a: 94-95). This ability is high lighted in Bonatz's discussion of bird representa tions, in which he cites a Hurrian ritual text from Hattusa that marks birds as sacrifices to remove im purities during a funeral ritual related to the deity of the underworld (Bonatz 2000a: 94). Hittite rituals also indicate that birds could be used to remove im purities from the living (Mirecki and Meyer 2002: 230, 237). In addition, waterfowl are naturally con nected with water and air, thus potentially function ing to reconnect the deceased person with the living world through these two important elements (Bonatz 2000a: 94-95). The cup held by KTMW belongs to a class of vessel that can be linked to libation and consumption in Crete, Phoenicia, and Assyria through inscriptions and images. Drinking vessels pictured on mortuary steles are assumed to hold wine for rituals to ensure prosperity and fertility, and there is no reason to as sume that KTMW's vessel was for something other than wine, especially as his inscription mandates offerings from vines. Unlike many of the deeper undecorated vessels shown on Syro-Hittite reliefs, KTMW's decorative phiale is a symbol of more than just ritual wine consumption. The cup's detail and assumed precious material (bronze, silver, or gold) indicate high status, while the phiale form suggests that the individual who commissioned the KTMW stele was aware of the shifts in cosmopolitan styles in art and luxury items (Avigad and Greenfield 1982; Muscarella 1988). The consumption of bread was a literal addition to the body of grain's life-giving properties; the in clusion of bread on a mortuary image could be seen as representing a source of continued life, prosperity, and regeneration after death (Bonatz 2000a: 92 96). Hittite royal mortuary rituals used stacks of bread and cakes to honor and feed the deceased king</page><page sequence="18">32 STRUBLE AND HERRMANN BASOR 356 or queen (van den Hout 1994). In Mesopotamia, bread also had great ritual significance as one of the required elements of the typical kispum ritual conducted in order to continue feeding deceased ancestors (Bonatz 2000a: 92-96). The oval object on a branch in KTMW's hand has the most ambiguous meaning of all the elements on the stele and can be interpreted as relating to certain deities, to fertility and regeneration, to ritual action, or to a possible vocation held by KTMW. The ambi guity of meaning is amplified by the existence of so few examples in Syro-Hittite and other Near Eastern art that precisely parallel the object. The Syro-Hittite examples of cones on branches are slightly more pointed than KTMW's and are attached to straight branches but, if taken to have the same symbolism, might suggest a connection between these objects and the Storm or Moon deities, or even possible devotion to the Sun God (Hutter 2003: 227). Slightly more evidence can be cited to connect the cone on KTMW's stele with concepts of fertility and regeneration. Fertility and gender duality are often indicated on Syro-Hittite steles, in the forms of spindles and mirrors for women and bows or staffs for men (Orthmann 1971: 377-80; Bonatz 2000a: 201; Rova 2008). The relationship between duality and fertility and conifer cones may be echoed in the two cone types that grow from the same plant on the relief of the fifth-century B.c. altar from Nev?ehir. The cone is the reproductive part of the conifer tree, and each tree typically produces both the male and female elements needed to create new life, support ing the idea that a cone may represent ideas of fertility and regenerative capabilities (Simpson 2006: 114).30 This connection of a cone with fertility is seen in the Syro-Hittite world in a representation of a conifer cone found near Carchemish, inscribed with a dedi cation to the goddess Kubaba (Hawkins 1981). Greek and Roman art continues this traditional fertility sym bolism in its use of a cone on the top of the thyrsus carried by Dionysus/Bacchus, which represents fer 30 The cone held by KTMW bears more resemblance to female than to male cones. Whether this was an intentional portrayal of a female cone cannot be known, but if so, it may be connected with some desire to acknowledge a connection with his spouse, or with a female deity, such as Kubaba, who is mentioned in the inscription. Whether or not the intention was to show a particular cone's gender on the stele, the two different cones on the altar from Nev?ehir suggest a possible awareness of the gender duality of conifers. tility through the life-maintaining properties of the various plants used to create it (Kalke 1985).31 Fertility, prosperity, and ritual purification are all associated with the oval object seen in the hands of the genii or bird-men in Assyrian art. Though it is still argued whether or not this oval truly represents some sort of date-palm pollination tool or flower, or a conifer cone or cone imitation, in each case the cone is viewed as a symbol of purification or of blessing (Russell 1998: 692; Porter 1993: 137-38; 2003: 11-20). Assyrian texts suggest that the oval could be used as an aspergillum, to sprinkle water on someone to create a release of sin and thus purifica tion (Wiggermann 1992: 66-67, 69). Interpretation of these ovals as tools for pollination of the date palm hints that they may be signs of fertility or pros perity. Porter views this as indicative of a blessing of "abundance and security" when the oval is directed toward a person rather than a tree (Porter 1993: 137). Another interpretation of the function of the oval is given by Russell, who prefers the identification of the ovals as conifer cones over date-palm flowers (Russell 1998: 692). This identification, along with his analysis of the placement of these images within Assyrian architecture, leads him to assert that the objects are part of more complex apotropaic images meant to protect and secure doorways and rooms from evil, and to create safe zones around the king and in the palace (Russell 1998: 692). These recur rent ideas of prosperity, purification, and protection in the Assyrian use of the oval object may then be useful clues to the message and meaning intended by the oval on the branch held by KTMW. It is also possible that the KTMW stele shows a conifer cone in the deceased's hand, rather than the more common flower, staff, wheat stalk, or bunch of grapes, in order to signify some sort of vocational connection between KTMW and products of conifer ous trees (such as lumber, resin, or the cones them selves). The use of conifers for lumber was significant in the Iron Age, and it is known that the Amanus Mountains acted as a source for conifers such as pine and cedar, which were then exported to Mesopota mia (Meiggs 1982: 73-82). Resin from conifer trees was used in the production and transport of some wines in the Levant?to seal vessels and preserve 31 Dionysus is also associated with fertility through his con nections to the goddess Cybele/Kybele, who is identified with the Syro-Hittite period's Kubaba, mentioned on the KTMW stele (Roller 1991; Sturgeon 2004).</page><page sequence="19">2009 AN ETERNAL FEAST AT SAM'AL 33 or flavor the wine?beginning before the Iron Age (McGovern 1997). Resin from conifers was also used for medicinal purposes (Manniche 1999: 23, 28-29). From a ritual perspective, as declared al ready in Hittite ceremonies, cones had a value as incense for ritual burning and for anointing with water (Mirecki and Meyer 2002: 230, 237). Although the inscription and image do not clearly indicate KTMW's association with the trade or use of conif erous tree products, the unusual choice for the botan ical object he holds in his hand demands that we consider these more functional possibilities, in addi tion to the interpretations of religious symbolism discussed above. THE STELE IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT The Archaeological Context The discovery of the KTMW stele in its original context promises, following further investigation, to make a significant contribution to the understanding of the physical and social setting of the Syro-Hittite mortuary steles, all of which (until now) had been discovered in secondary or tertiary contexts or in unscientific or poorly documented excavations. The inscription and relief scene will in turn help to illu minate the archaeological context of the stele by re vealing the identity of its owner and the nature of the activities that were to be carried out in his honor. The archaeological investigation of the context of the KTMW stele is not yet complete, however, so only a limited, preliminary description is provided here, with a full report to follow in a volume of the Zincirli final reports. As mentioned above, the new stele came to light on July 21, 2008, during excavation in Area 5, super vised by Virginia Herrmann. This excavation area is located in Zincirli's northern lower town, roughly 50 m south of the outer fortification walls and 190 m west-northwest of the northeastern city gate (fig. 2). The stele was discovered to be in situ in the north west corner of a small room, ca. 3.75 x 3.0 m, of Building II of Complex A, whose exterior dimen sions measure 8.75 m (northwest-southeast) by at least 11.5 m (northeast-southwest), though the full extent of this building has not yet been exposed (fig. 9). In the original phase of this building, the room that was later to house the stele was wider by ca. 1 m and contained two circular ovens lined with reused storage jar sherds. The room thus originally seems to have been used for food preparation, giving a possibly domestic cast to the building as a whole, and making its eventual conversion into a mortuary cult-place all the more remarkable. Building A/II was flanked on either side by buildings of an appar ently similar size and plan, though neither has yet been fully excavated. Most likely concurrent with the erection of the stele (see fig. 9 for the plan of this phase), a new wall was built in the south (blocking access to one of the ovens) in order to make the room smaller and more enclosed or private, leaving a doorway ca. 1.35 m wide in the southeast corner, which could have been closed by a wooden door, though it is rather wide. The beaten-earth floor was raised ca. 10 cm, putting the ovens out of use, and the stele was set up with its back against the western wall of the room and its tenon inserted into the floor. Directly in front of it were laid three roughly rectangular flag stones, creating a pavement or platform 0.95 x 0.70 m in extent. On its right side, between the stele and the northern wall of the room, was a large basalt stone, 0.95 m long and 0.35 m wide, with a flat-smoothed top and front, which appears to have served as a low bench. Immediately to the left of the stele, set against the western wall of the room, was a "pedestal" or stack of stones, ca. 0.65 m high and 0.40 m wide, capped by a large, flat basalt stone with irregular edges. It has yet to be determined whether this feature was contemporary with the original installation of the stele or constitutes a later rebuild of a construction of the stele-phase. These installations (low bench, stone pavement, and perhaps also "pedestal") framed the stele and most likely served as the immediate set ting for cultic activities performed in its presence, possibly even as the places where food and drink offerings were deposited. Their lack of grandeur and embellishment contrasts with the relatively high quality of the stele and its relief scene and inscrip tion, but perhaps their current state of preservation belies their original appearance. Despite the impli cation of the stele's inscription that its owner was deceased at the time of its use (Pardee, this issue), KTMW's mortal remains (if this was his burial site) have not yet been found, though investigation be neath the floors of this room has barely begun. In the southern part of Building A/II, we have also not yet reached the earlier phases contemporary with the stele or the ovens, leaving still open the question of what purpose the other rooms of the</page><page sequence="20">34 STRUBLE AND HERRMANN BASOR 356 Fig. 9. Plan of the exposed part of Building A/M, in which the KTMW stele was found, in Area 5 in Zincirli's northern lower town. In the dotted area, the remains contemporary with the stele have not yet been excavated. building might have served. Building A/I, abutting A/II on the east, was razed to its foundations at a point roughly contemporaneous with the stele phase, and became thereafter an open lot. It is tempting to think that this lot could be the location of the "vine(yard)" mentioned by the inscription as the source for annual offerings (line 9; see Pardee, this issue). The room containing the stele was not destroyed violently, but seems to have been systematically cleaned out at the end of its use, with the result that no objects were found on the floor of the room that would assist in the reconstruction of the activities carried out there. In the debris immediately in front of the stele, however, 15 cm above the flagstone pavement, the cylindrical foot of a basalt vessel was</page><page sequence="21">2009 AN ETERNAL FEAST AT SAIvPAL 35 found. Indeed, an unusual number of basalt vessel fragments, some quite finely made, were found in the bricky fill of this room and in the adjacent rooms and streets. The connection of these vessels with the cultic activities of this room or building is uncertain, however.32 A fragment of a basalt object with a neatly made circular hollow blackened by fire in each side was also found built into the foundation of the later wall that replaced the stele room's southern wall. It is possible that at one point this, too, formed part of the cult furniture associated with the stele. Beyond these durable items, unfortunately found in second ary contexts, the food and drink offerings described in the stele's inscription would only have left organic remains. We can speculate that perhaps a wooden table and some kind of portable hearth would have been likely additional components of the cult furni ture, but no trace of such items was found.33 The results of the ongoing analysis of faunal and botani cal remains and chemical residues associated with the setting of the stele will be provided in the final report of this excavation area. Sometime after the modifications that had created the setting for the KTMW stele and converted a pos sibly domestic building into a mortuary cult-place, probably during Sandal's tenure as an Assyrian pro vincial capital, the floors of Building A/II were raised again, and further changes were made to the interior layout of the building. A cobbled stone floor with a basalt mortar set into it belonging to this phase was 32 There is other evidence for the use of stone vessels in Syro Hittite mortuary contexts, however. In the "Kultraum" at Tell Halaf, in which two statues that have been associated with a mor tuary cult were set up (see below), three basalt bowls?one large with a low foot, and two smaller ones with a high foot and fluted sides?were found on the floor (Hrouda 1962: 67, 70-71, Taf. 52:78, 98, 99; M?ller 1950: Abb. 173) and can be assumed to have been intended to hold offerings. In a number of the graves of the Iron Age cremation cemetery of Carchemish-Yunus, a basalt vessel served as a base for the cinerary urn (Woolley 1939-1940), and a stone tripod bowl was found in one of the elite female cremation burials from Tell Halaf (Hrouda 1962: 7-8, Taf. 6-7). 33 Again, the well-preserved paraphernalia of the presumed mortuary cult in the Kultraum at Tell Halaf may assist the hypo thetical reconstruction of the equipment of KTMW's cult: in addition to the stone vessels already mentioned in note 32, a mud brick altar with signs of burning and a rectangular basalt "offering table" with two recesses, presumably used for the preparation of food offerings, stood before the podium on which the two statues sat, flanked by benches on one side (fig. 11). Numerous stone and bronze votive statuettes and other items were also found on the floor of the room, some at the feet of the statues themselves (M?ller 1950: 357-60; Hrouda 1962: 5-7, 19-21, Taf. 2-4). found in the southern part of the building, while in the northern part of the building the level of the presumably beaten-earth floor was discernible only indirectly from the elevations of rebuilt wall founda tions, a stone feature, and a few artifacts. Though this level indicates that the top of the stele may have still been visible during the later phase, these alter ations apparently put it and its associated features out of use and changed the function of the building yet again. The fact that the stele was left in place, undamaged, despite these changes (though it fell or was pushed back at a slight angle against the wall behind it at some point) may be a sign that the po tency of its inhabitant was still recognized and re spected, even if it was no longer venerated.34 After the abandonment of the lower town, which occurred no later than the end of the seventh century b.c., this area was never again occupied. Over and over through the years, the plowshares of farmers struck the top of the stele, which lay only 10 cm beneath the surface, leaving long scratches and destroying the crowning decoration, but miraculously sparing the inscription all but minimal damage. Our nearest evidence for the setting of non-royal mortuary cult in Syro-Mesopotamia derives from texts from Late Bronze Age Nuzi and Emar, in which a strong connection is made between the care for the ancestral dead and the inheritance and possession of the family house (van der Toorn 1994; Schmidt 1996). Based on the currently available architectural evi dence, however, Building A/II and the two adjacent buildings seem to be considerably smaller than would be expected for the residence of a person of the ap parent status of KTMW (fig. 9).35 Rather, as we argue further below, we may in the future be able to relate Building A/II to another tradition for the architectural setting of mortuary cult attested for the Syro-Hittite 34 This recalls the situation of the two female seated statues from Tell Halaf, which were not disturbed or damaged when they were walled up in a huge mudbrick terrace and thus put out of use (Langenegger 1950: 159-67; discussed by Bonatz 2000a: 155; 2001: 29-30). Several other examples of statues of this period that were carefully buried once broken or out of use can also be cited (Ussishkin 1970). 35 Across the street from this building complex to the north and east, however, are structures that appear from the geomag netic map created in 2007 (fig. 2) (Schloen and Fink 2009) to be much larger buildings centered around one or two large court yards, while to the south lies an even larger courtyard-centered structure, part of which was excavated in 2008 in Area 6. It is con ceivable that one of these could be KTMW's house, while his mortuary cult took place in a separate but nearby building.</page><page sequence="22">36 STRUBLE AND HERRMANN BASOR 356 region in the Iron Age: that of the freestanding mor tuary chapel. The suggestions offered here are nec essarily preliminary, however, and the extension of Area 5 and continued investigation of Building A/II in coming seasons at Zincirli are necessary to clarify the stele's architectural context and the changes in use undergone by these buildings. Syro-Hittite Mortuary Chapels The KTMW stele is the first banquet stele to be provided with detailed information about its sur roundings and context, so it is impossible to say how typical it may be for its kind. When preliminary com parisons are made with other evidence for the setting of Iron Age elite mortuary cult in this region (previ ously reviewed in Voos 1988b: 350-51; Bonatz 2000a: 151-55; Niehr 2006), however, the setting of the new stele from Zincirli seems to fit well into a gen eral pattern. As described above, the KTMW stele was erected facing toward the east (which will be come significant below) in an interior room of an apparently rather small, multi-room building, and thus in a private setting, protected from the view and ac cess of passersby. The best parallels for this are the archaeological contexts of three statues of seated fig ures in the round from Tell Halaf (ancient Guzana) (which are also understood to represent the deceased recipients of mortuary-cult offerings, due to the cups they hold in their right hands and their table-like laps). These similarities thus for the first time extend the analogy between these three-dimensional statues and the two-dimensional steles (Voos 1988a: 354; Naumann 1950: 395) from the realm of iconography into the realm of practice. Furthermore, the private, indoor architectural context of the KTMW stele con trasts with the evidence for Syro-Hittite colossal statues of standing figures, generally understood to represent rulers (Voos 1988b: 350; Bonatz 2000a: 76), which were often apparently set up in prominent public places such as gates and other important en trances (and have not so far been associated with burials) (Voos 1988b: 350; Bonatz 2000a: 153-54; Ussishkin 1989). Two statues of seated women were found on the southern edge of the citadel of Tell Halaf, sitting atop or very near shafts containing cremation urns. Each sat facing east within its own very fragmentary, small mudbrick building and was later encased, still stand ing, in a massive mudbrick terrace in the period of Kapara (Langenegger 1950: 159-67). A statue of two figures seated side by side, one male and one female (fig. 10),36 was found in a building (6.8-10.9 m wide x 11.9-21.8 m long) known as the "Kultraum" (al ready mentioned in nn. 32 and 33), consisting of a small entrance room, a long, narrow "cella," and three smaller side-rooms (fig. 11). The double statue sat on a podium at the end of the cella, facing east, along with a statue of a standing male figure (usually assumed to represent the Storm God, though he lacks divine attributes). The cella contained a great deal of evidence for cultic activity, including a long bench, a mudbrick altar with evidence of burning, several basalt vessels, and numerous basalt and bronze stat uettes of male and female figures. No human remains were found in the Kultraum, but the building was never fully investigated (M?ller 1950: 357-60; Pucci 2008: 115-16, pis. 13, 21). Two further elite or royal mortuary-cult sites, containing human remains but without (surviving) representations of the deceased, were found at Tell Halaf, consisting of two small, multi-room adjacent buildings (Baugruppe 1 and 2) (compared to the Kultraum by Niehr [2006: 131]) on the slope of the citadel near the southern gate, with an entrance annex (Baugruppe 3) added at a later point (Langenegger 1950: 169-78), and a semi-subterranean chamber containing human remains and grave goods, located close to the "Tempel-Palast" on the citadel (Langenegger 1950: 100-103). At Carchemish, while no mortuary statues have been found in situ, there are also some indications for the setting of elite burials and mortuary cult. The only Iron Age burial found within the city walls, a very rich cremation burial ("the Gold Tomb"), was located in a pit in the corner of a small, possibly multi-room building on the northern edge of the "Inner City," which abutted a plastered subterranean chamber (Woolley 1921: 67-68, pi. 8). A tower-shaped mortuary stele with an (unfortunately illegible) Luwian inscription (Carchemish A4c) was found in the main chamber of a poorly preserved, three-room subsid 36 A fourth seated statue bearing a cuneiform inscription iden tifying the figure depicted as the scribe Kammaki was recently found during construction activity in the lower town, but its origi nal context is unfortunately unknown (R?llig 2003). Four more Iron Age seated statues have been found at small sites in the region of Tell Halaf in recent years, all again without context (Schachner, Schachner, and Karabulut 2002), but pointing to an apparent preference in this region for the depiction of the deceased as seated figures in the round, which are, so far, less common farther west.</page><page sequence="23">2009 AN ETERNAL FEAST AT SAM'AL Fig. 10.

In addition, the head less statue of a seated male figure with a defaced cuneiform inscription was found next to the "Hilani" building (Woolley and Barnett 1952: 181, pi. 38), which had an empty cremation-type urn embedded into the subflooring of its main room (Woolley and Barnett 1952: 180, pi. 38), leading Woolley (Wool ley and Barnett 1952: 184) and later Voos (1986: 35), Bonatz (2000a: 154), and Niehr (2006: 131) to speculate that both this building and the similar "Temple of the Storm God" were royal mortuary chapels.

Zincirli may fall into the Syro-Hittite tradition, at tested at Tell Halaf and Carchemish and already identified by Bonatz (2000a: 152) and Niehr (2006), consisting of the erection of a memorial (facing east, toward the rising sun) in a private sanctuary or chapel that was above-ground and accessible, purpose-built for the mortuary cult of the deceased, but intimately connected with the worship of one or more deities.37 Whether these chapels were closely associated with larger temples or the deceased's residence, or were independent, is still poorly understood and perhaps 37 While Bonatz argues that the Iron Age tradition illustrates the independence of memorials and mortuary cult from the place of burial (2000a: 153), the evidence does not seem clear on this point, at least for the seated statues, given the proximity to burials of two of the seated statues from Tell Halaf and possibly the statue at the Carchemish "Hilani," the incomplete investigation of some of the findspots of the memorials (including the KTMW stele), and the architectural parallels (Niehr 2006: 131) between struc tures at Tell Halaf and Carchemish that contained human remains and structures such as the Tell Halaf Kultraum, where none were found. variable. A link to the cult of the gods (cf. van der Toorn 1996) is graphically illustrated, however, by the arrangement of the statues of both deceased and deity in the Kultraum of Tell Halaf and by the mor tuary inscription of Panamuwa I on a statue of Hadad from Gercin (KAI 214),38 in which the king desires his spirit to share in the food and drink offerings given to the god (lines 17, 22). The simultaneous offerings to various deities, the chief of whom is again Hadad, and to KTMW's nbs, prescribed by the new inscription (lines 3-5), thus strengthen the con nection of the stele to this tradition, which was not an innovation of the Iron Age, but has its roots in the connection of mortuary-cult sites and statues of deceased kings to the temples of deities at second millennium b.c. Ebla, Alalakh (Fink 2007), and Hazor, as well as in Hatti (reviewed by Bonatz 2000a: 152 38 In his discussion of the building terminology used in this inscription, Niehr concludes that the hdr in which the statue of the deceased king was probably erected refers to a kind of chapel within a larger memorial-place or sanctuary (mqm) (2001: 89-90).</page><page sequence="25">2009 AN ETERNAL FEAST AT SA1VPAL 39 53). The identification of KTMW in the new inscrip tion as a "servant" of the king of Sam'al, rather than a ruler himself, reveals that what is usually described as a feature of royal mortuary cult (Niehr 2006)? namely, the establishment of a private mortuary cult place in which food and drink offerings to a deity are shared with the deceased?was not an exclusive privilege of kings and queens (in contrast, perhaps, to a cult established in a public place).39 The evidence of the architectural context of the KTMW stele, while still not fully exposed, suggests the possibility of a similar setting for many of the other Syro-Hittite mortuary steles, and thus argues for a greater degree of uniformity not only in the ico nography, but also in the setting and practices asso ciated with both steles (with and without figurative decoration) and seated statues (cf. Voos 1988a: 354). The often arch-shaped border that frames many of the steles, including that of KTMW, could even im itate a real or imagined architectural setting for these memorials, as suggested by Voos (1988a: 359), an other version of which might be represented in the tower-shaped steles (or "altars") topped by crenella tions from the regions of Carchemish (Hawkins 1989) and Marash (Schachner and Schachner 1996: 211). The Topography of Syro-Hittite Mortuary Monuments Wlien we broaden our perspective beyond the ar chitectural setting of the Syro-Hittite mortuary monu ments, the location of the new stele within the walls of the city of Sam5al, but in an apparently residential neighborhood of the lower town rather than in the more prominent areas of the site on the citadel or at the gates (fig. 2), also presents us with intriguing new information. Only a few of the previously known Syro-Hittite banquet steles can be connected more or less specifically with their original location (reviewed in Voos 1986: 31-34, 81, 88,95-98,101,105; Bonatz 2000a: 151, 156), and these show no uniformity in their contexts, being distributed variously in citadels, lower towns, and extramural cemeteries. The other banquet stele from Zincirli, for example, as well as one of the steles from Marash (Bonatz C21; Darga 1992: 321), the two steles from Neirab (Clermont 39 In addition, though the seated couple from the Tell Halaf Kultraum are often assumed to represent a deceased king and queen (e.g., Niehr 2006), there is nothing necessarily royal about their depiction. Ganneau 1897: 182-85), and a stele from Tell Ahmar (Til Barsib) (Bonatz C39; Thureau-Dangin and Dunand 1936: 159-60) were discovered on the cita del mounds of these sites; whereas, like the KTMW stele, several other probable mortuary steles were unearthed in the lower towns of the Syro-Hittite cities,40 and the two steles known from Carchemish Yunus were found in an extramural cemetery near the city.41 The findspots of the tower-shaped mortu ary steles topped by crenellations and inscribed with Luwian hieroglyphs but without figurative decora tion exhibit a similar diversity, with two having been found in the Iron Age cremation cemeteries near Carchemish (Yunus and Merj Khamis), and another in an ancient cemetery near the village of Tilsevet, while two others were found in association with the "Temple of the Storm God" in the "Inner City" and the "Kubaba Temple" on the acropolis mound of Carchemish, respectively 42 All of the seated statues in the round with known findspots were excavated in the lower town of Tell Halaf, however (Langenegger 1950: 159-67; M?ller 1950: 357-60; R?llig 2003), though the two female seated statues sitting atop cremation urns were located immediately outside the citadel wall.43 40 A stele from Tell Rifacat (ancient Arpad) (Bonatz C14 = Orthmann T. Rifacat 1) was found "near [the] outer city wall" (Se ton-Williams 1961: pi. 33b), while a tower-shaped monument showing a seated woman and her attendants (Bonatz C59) was found during excavations in Belediye ?ar?isi, ca. 300 m south of the citadel of Marash (Schachner and Schachner 1996: 203), thus conceivably also within the area of the assumed lower town of the city. Two steles that show standing, rather than seated, figures, but which may also be mortuary in nature, were excavated in the lower towns of Tell Ahmar (Til Barsib) (Bonatz C70 = Orthmann Til Barsip B/4) (Thureau-Dangin and Dunand 1936: 137) and Tell Halaf (M?ller 1950: 359; Moortgat 1955: 30, Taf. 151). 41 Three more steles from Marash (Bonatz C27 = Orthmann Ma ras A/2, Bonatz C42 = Orthmann Maras B/17, and Bonatz C62 = Orthmann Maras B/20) were found together in the Y?r?kselim part of the modern city (Kala? 1964: 282-83, Taf. 9a, lOa-b), which is over a kilometer north of the citadel mound, and could also thus be hypothesized to have come from an extramural cemetery. 42 Yunus: Carchemish A16f (Woolley 1921: xiii; 1939-1940: 14); Merj Khamis: Carchemish 18f (Woolley 1921: xiv); Tilsevet (Hawkins 1989: 191, n. 12; 2000: 178; Kala? 1968: 315, 323); Carchemish: A4c (Woolley and Barnett 1952: 167, pis. 29, 36a) and A5a (Woolley and Barnett 1952: 213, pis. 49, 50a, 51a). 43 In addition to this diversity of findspots in the urban envi ronment, banquet steles, tower steles, and seated statues have all been discovered at small sites (about whose character in the Iron Age virtually nothing is known) in addition to the royal capitals of the Syro-Hittite kingdoms (see the catalog in Bonatz 2000a: 13 23; Schachner, Schachner, and Karabulut 2002; Hawkins 1989).</page><page sequence="26">40 STRUBLE AND HERRMANN BASOR 356 This lack of a uniform pattern in the location of the steles and other Syro-Hittite mortuary monuments is interesting, if not immediately comprehensible. What is clear is that mortuary monuments, presum ably often accompanying a burial, were frequently located within the walls of the Syro-Hittite cities, whereas burial in extramural cemeteries seems to have been the norm in these societies. Though the area excavated at some sites is not immense and is, in some cases, restricted to the acropolis, burials within urban limits are extremely rare at excavated sites of this period,44 with the exception of a small number of wealthy or elaborate burials at a few sites45 and a few graves appearing only at the very end of the Iron Age after the incorporation of this region into a suc cession of large empires, usually in areas of these sites that had already been abandoned and no longer contained habitations.46 The graves excavated in the extramural cremation cemeteries of Carchemish Yunus (Woolley 1939-1940), Deve H?y?k I (Moo rey 1980), Tell Shiukh Fawqani (al-Bahloul, Barro, and d'Alfonso 2005; Tenu, Bachelot, and Le Goff 2005), and Ras el-Bassit (Courbin 1993), and those of the Phoenician cremation cemetery of Tyre-al Bass (Aubet 2004; 2006), while showing some differenti ation, were all fairly modest in elaboration and grave goods (though, again, it is possible that the excavated samples are unrepresentative), and the excavator of the long-lived extramural cremation cemeteries at Hama noted that after the Iron Age I period, rich grave goods no longer appeared in the burials, lead ing him to speculate that in this period, wealthy in dividuals were buried elsewhere at the site, reflecting a greater differentiation between social classes by this point (Riis 1948: 37, 203) 47 44 They do not appear at all in reports of the excavated areas, e.g., at Hama (Fugmann 1958), Tell Tayinat (Haines 1971), Tell Judaidah (Haines 1971), Tell Afis (Mazzoni 2008; S. Soldi, personal communication), and Tell Kazel (Badre et al. 1990; Badre et al. 1994; Capet 2003). 45 Carchemish (Woolley 1921: 68); Zincirli (Luschan, Humann, and Koldewey 1898: 140, Abb. 45); Neirab (Clermont-Ganneau 1897); Tell Halaf (Langenegger 1950: 100-103,159-67,169-78); and Tell RhVat (Seton-Williams 1961: pi. 33b). 46 Chatal H?y?k (Area I, Level 3; Area II, Levels 2-1; Haines 1971); Tell Mastuma (Level 1-1; Wakita et al. 1995: 6); Tell Halaf (lower-town graves; M?ller 1950: 361-66); Zincirli (Luschan and Andrae 1943: 137-40; Lehmann 1996: 280-81); Ras el-Bassit (Courbin 1993: 108); Tell Shiukh Fawqani (Area G, Level 1; Luciani 2000; 2005). The few grave markers found at Hama (Riis 1948: 28, fig. 18) and the Phoenician cemeteries (Aubet 2004; Sader 2005) were unelaborated and rough hewn, marked in the latter case only with a name and/or a symbol, though a few examples were roughly anthropomorphic. Moreover, based on their lesser quality and size, the two banquet steles found in the cemetery at Carchemish-Yunus have been consid ered to be lower-class imitations of the steles of the elite (Bonatz 2000a: 156; Schachner and Schachner 1996: 213, n. 14). There are some indications?e.g., the several bases for presumably more substantial steles at Yunus, the three steles found in an outlying area of the modern city of Marash (Kahramanmaras) (see n. 41), and the three Luwian-inscribed tower steles from cemeteries in the region of Carchemish? however, that more elaborate mortuary monuments were sometimes located in the extramural cemeteries as well, so we should not assume a strict separation. The archaeological record of the Syro-Hittite re gion in the Iron Age II thus suggests that the privi lege of burial and memorialization within the city walls was reserved only for a small number of people on the basis of status and/or wealth. This spatial differentiation stands out as perhaps the most signif icant social distinction in mortuary practice, as fun damental similarities (across a range of elaboration) between elite/non-elite or intramural/extramural buri als in the postmortem treatment of the body, the basic form of the burial, grave goods, funerary or mortuary offerings,48 and even the erection of stone memorials suggest that beliefs and practices relating to death and the afterlife were otherwise shared broadly through out this society. The diverse locations of Syro-Hittite mortuary monuments even within the city walls, how ever, hint at further complexities in the social sig nificance of these memorials which warrant further 47 We should be cautious, however, about assuming a simple correlation between the elaboration and wealth of graves and the socioeconomic status of those buried, as has been shown by a number of anthropologists of death and mortuary practices (Parker Pearson 1999: 83-91; cf. Morris 1999). 48 Faunal remains in the vicinity of some burials could repre sent the remains of funerary or mortuary meals of meat at the grave site (Courbin 1993: 108; Riis 1948: 30; Tenu and Bachelot 2005: 163), suggesting mortuary offerings of the kind indicated by the scenes on the banquet steles and the KTMW inscription. There may also, of course, be another category entirely of people who were not given any formal or archaeologically visible burial (as suggested by Courbin 1993: 111).</page><page sequence="27">2009 AN ETERNAL FEAST AT SAM'AL 41 discussion, even if the current state of the evidence precludes firm conclusions. There are some clues to the social identity and concerns of the owners of Syro-Hittite mortuary monuments in their inscriptions and iconography. Unlike the statues in the round of standing figures, who are usually identified as rulers (Voos 1988b: 350; Bonatz 2000a: 76), the deceased depicted on the Syro Hittite banquet steles have generally been thought to represent members of the upper stratum of this soci ety, including members of the royal houses, but usu ally not kings themselves (Voos 1988b: 352; Mazzoni 1997: 313; Bonatz 2000a: 159-61). Besides KTMW, a "servant" of the king of Sam'al (line 1) (probably to be understood as a vassal or minister; Lipiriski 2000: 500), the few inscribed monuments identify the recipients and commissioners of these monuments as priests (the two steles from Neirab, KAI 225, 226, and possibly also Erkilet 1: Hawkins 2000: 493-94), scribes (Kululu 3: Hawkins 2000: 490-91; Kammaki from Tell Halaf: R?llig 2003), the wife of a "hero" and king (Sheizar: Hawkins 2000: 416-19), and a man named Ruwas who is designated "ruler" (tar wanis), "governor" (tapariyalis), and "house-lord" (DOMUS-m(-)DOMINUS-ms) in his funerary in scription (Kululu 4: Hawkins 2000: 445-47) and "servant" of Tuwatis, an eighth-century king of Tabal, in another inscription (Kululu 1: Hawkins 2000: 442 44). Others are designated only as "the Sun-blessed person" (CAPUT-tis): Carchemish A18h (Hawkins 2000: 180-81); Carchemish A5a (Hawkins 2000: 181-84); Carchemish A18f (Hawkins 2000: 186); Kululu 2 (Hawkins 2000: 487-90); and still others give no title.49 Some of the objects in the scenes or held by the figures?such as writing implements, balances, mu sical instruments, spindles, distaffs, mirrors, horses, falcons, staffs, or folded cloths?may also have been intended to communicate the elite status or occupa tion of those depicted (Mazzoni 1997: 313; Bonatz 2000a: Tab. 2; pace Voos 1988b: 357-59). Pointing to these status symbols, Mazzoni describes this flow ering of upper-class mortuary art as an assertion of a new aristocratic ideology (1997: 313; 2000: 51), another expression of which might be found in the proliferation of workshops producing fine luxury 49 See Jasink (1998a; 1998b) for an analysis of these titles, including the subordinate status implied by the terms tarwanis and CAPUT-fw in certain situations. goods, such as ivory-inlaid furniture and decorated cosmetic containers, in this period (2000: 53). Among the deceased and their attendants, a relatively large number of women are also depicted (they appear in 26 of Bonatz's 72 steles), not only in couples, but sometimes as the sole seated honoree. The social reach of this type of monument was thus apparently fairly broad (Bonatz 2000a: 159), probably extend ing beyond immediate members of the royal family, even if it represented an elite group who possessed both the means to commission such a monument and, in many cases, the status (or property?) necessary to erect a memorial within the city itself, as discussed above. The banquet stele and related types of mortuary monument appeared rather suddenly in the late tenth and ninth centuries b.c. and flourished through the eighth century, eventually disappearing sometime after the entire Syro-Hittite region was incorporated into the Assyrian Empire toward the end of the eighth century. This striking expansion both of the thematic repertoire of Syro-Hittite monuments, which had previously in the Late Bronze Age emphasized the depiction of deities, cultic scenes, and the royal mortuary cult (Bonatz 2000a: 145), and of the social group commissioning them, demands some histori cal explanation. For the form and iconography of the banquet steles, the answer is perhaps to be found in an evolution of religious beliefs and influences in the highly interconnected Near East of the Iron Age II, which is beyond the scope of this article. In order to understand the newly widespread formalization and monumentalization of mortuary cult, however, it seems reasonable to look to contemporary social or political developments (Laneri 2008: 6-7; Parker Pearson 1999: 87). Bonatz associates the appearance of these monu ments in the ninth century with the contemporaneous coalescence of the centralized Syro-Hittite states pro moting a renewed dynastic and urban ideology in this period (2000a: 179) and asserts that the privilege of self-memorialization of non-royal members of the upper class depended on their position in a newly re vived state hierarchy (2000a: 161). The commission ers of these mortuary monuments emulated the royal practices of memorialization and dynastic legitima tion (Bonatz 2000a: 161-65) and set themselves off from other elements of society by frequently lo cating their memorials within the urban fabric. This new (or, at least, now more visible) self-assertion of</page><page sequence="28">42 STRUBLE AND HERRMANN BASOR 356 non-royal individuals and families occurred even as power became increasingly centralized in these king doms, eventually to be eclipsed by the ultimate power of the Assyrian king. We lack the textual and archae ological evidence to elucidate this phenomenon much further, but two aspects of these mortuary monuments may complicate the idea of their straightforward deri vation from royal self-memorialization and depen dence on royal favor, even if the chronological coincidence makes some connection with the emer gence of centralized states in this region undeniable. The first such aspect is the not uncommon erection of mortuary monuments in the lower towns of the Syro-Hittite cities, in apparently residential neigh borhoods, and thus presumably in the area of the city in which the deceased and his or her descendants resided or had a good deal of influence, where the cult-place would be accessible to descendants and dependents. Clearly, these monuments were not al ways located in the royal precincts on the citadel (as was the case with the other banquet stele from Zin cirli), or in association with the royal mortuary cult or a major temple, the main loci of state power.50 The best examples of this are the Kultraum, containing a statue of a seated pair in the lower town of Tell Halaf (see especially Pucci 2008: pi. 13, for its apparently residential architectural environment), and now the location of the KTMW stele (fig. 2). The continued investigation and expansion of Area 5 in the future will provide a much clearer picture of the nature of the environs of this mortuary cult. Furthermore, while an overlord is occasionally mentioned (as in the case of the KTMW stele), the most important theme emphasized in both the in scriptions and the iconography of these monuments is not the deceased's position with respect to the king or the state, but rather the integrity and continuity of the immediate family, including its female members. Pious survivors and descendants are frequently men tioned in the inscriptions, often as donors of the monu ments; and a child or young person, probably the heir, is often depicted as either embraced by his or her mother or serving the deceased as an attendant (Orth mann 1971: 375; Bonatz 2000a: 161-64; Mazzoni 2005: 6-8). The emphasis on heredity and the family (and perhaps, by implication, the transmission of property and status) correlates well with the private 50 As already mentioned in n. 43, mortuary monuments could also be found outside of the political capitals of the Syro-Hittite kingdoms. architectural setting in the lower town of Sam^al now attested for the KTMW stele, though its relationship to its owner's ancestral home is still unclear. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION In the middle of the eighth century b.c., when Sam5al and most of the other Syro-Hittite kingdoms were already heavily under Assyrian sway, KTMW, a high magnate under Panamuwa II, still expressed his hopes for the afterlife and for an exalted relation ship with the gods of Sandal in a highly traditional way, while at the same time adopting the cosmopoli tan style of the royal house of that kingdom. Por trayed beneath the wings of the sun-disk in the elite dress of Sam5al, holding aloft an elaborate drinking vessel at a sumptuous banquet table, he made his wish to dine in the company of the gods manifest in both text and image, charging his heir(s) with his nourishment in the afterlife. Despite this traditional representation, KTMW adds a new element to the iconographic repertoire of the Syro-Hittite mortuary steles by holding what seems to be a conifer cone in his left hand, in the place usually occupied by other botanical symbols of fertility and regeneration. Co nifer cones?otherwise unattested in this specific form or on a mortuary relief?were perhaps particu larly significant here on the verge of the forested Amanus Mountains. The presence of this symbol also raises the question of an association with certain deities or specific ritual uses, as representations of conifer cones in this period and in later Mediterra nean cultures portray their use in religious ritual and the blessing of deities, kings, and important spaces. The unique combination KTMW displays of an ap parently bald head or very short hair with a full beard also presents a potential glimpse into the marking of social, religious, or occupational status or roles in Syro-Hittite society through details of dress and hair style, though the precise significance of this combi nation is unknown. KTMW erected his impressive personal memorial in an interior room of an unimposing building in the northern lower town of Sam'al. Special features were added to provide a formal setting for the annual of ferings prescribed in the inscription and alluded to in the scene. Of the function of other parts of this possible "mortuary chapel" and the character of the neighborhood in which it was found, we still know little at this point. Even at this early stage in the in vestigation of the archaeological context of the stele,</page><page sequence="29">2009 AN ETERNAL FEAST AT SAIvPAL 43 however, the initial facts of its private intramural architectural setting, its lower-town location, and the identity of its owner as a non-royal member of the Samalian elite greatly expand our knowledge of the sitz im Leben of the Syro-Hittite mortuary steles in general and enable us to envision the scene of the cultic activities related to them. This information also allows us to begin to speculate that the several categories of Syro-Hittite memorials functioned in a similar manner and in similar settings and that cer tain locales and practices previously associated only with the royal mortuary or ancestor cult could have extended more broadly through Syro-Hittite society. This preliminary study has not attempted to ex haust the discussion of the contribution of this new stele from Zincirli to art historical studies, religious history, or the archaeology of Syro-Hittite mortuary cult, the latter of which must await a fuller exposure and study of the stele's archaeological context in the coming years. We hope that this first presentation of the KTMW stele will, however, provide new fuel for the productive discussion of all of these subjects.
