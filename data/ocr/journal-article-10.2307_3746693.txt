<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW BOOKS of inorganic nature and of the realm of life: unknown heroisms and silent self-sacrifice: every desire and effort for whatever is good and beautiful and true: all these are eternally sustained by the dynamic force of Reality, and all that opposes them is in the end destroyed." 0. S. FRANKS. Waking World. By OLAF STAPLEDON. (London: Methuen &amp; Co., Ltd. 1934. Pp. viii + 280. Price 7s. 6d.) This book, as its title suggests, is rather a prayer of aspiration than a work of philosophy; but, since its author believes-with reason-that world awakening waits for a sufficient Weltanschauung, it involves a philosophy. It ranges from communism and fascism via an outline of "modern knowledge," a survey of art, science, philosophy and religion, to pacifism, democracy, free-speech, and the World-State. The human and social aspiration claims much sympathy; while for the details of the social plan there is a good deal to be said. The survey of art, science, and philosophy is, in the main, admirably done. The critique of religion (and of Christianity in particular) is obviously that of an amateur. Its two chief bgtes-noires, 'soul-saving' and the 'loving God,' have no place in first-rate theology and religious practice in the forms in which Mr. Stapledon envisages them: and with the second-rate we need not treat, since the ideals both of churches and of Mr. Stapledon suffer from the mediocrity and obtuseness of men. The concept of 'salvation,' indeed, holds in Christian theology much the same place that 'fully awakened living' does in Mr. Stapledon's, though, of course, the two theologies differ in what they take to be the 'chief end of man'; and the Christian doctrine of the Love of God does not abate a jot of the Hebrew sense of His awfulness. That in practice much weak sentimentalism creeps in there is no need to deny. The author's criticism of 'sham' religion is central to his theme, since he has the 'real thing' to recommend, which, he hopes, is to prove the dynamic of a 'waking world.' This religion is reminiscent of "The Free Man's Worship," but whereas Russell preaches defiance of Fate, Mr. Stapledon preaches admiration of its tragic theme. That an "overwhelming apprehension of something both superhuman and beautiful" (p. 204) lies at or near the root of religion would, I think, be granted (with qualification) by most theologians. The difference between these and the author lies in this, that the former accept developments from this primordial 'something' along the lines of rational and moral anthropomorphism, while the latter, denouncing anthro- pomorphism in general, develops a no less anthropomorphic aestheticism in religion, one of the chief advantages of which is its immunity from reason. More than a touch of Spinozism (or Bradleyism) marks Mr. Stapledon's world-view. "The perfectly awakened mind," he observes, "at last sees clearly that, though the defects and agony of the myriad beings of the cosmos are undeniable facts, they are also needed factors in the excellence of the cosmos" (p. 237). But one may doubt whether either Spinoza or Bradley would altogether approve of this book as a whole. Indeed, with all syncretists, Mr. Stapledon (who, in effect, accepts the designation) wants the best of all possible worlds, including that of M. Bergson, as well as that of Spinoza. He wants, e.g., 'creative leaps' which are also 'determined.' The book concludes on a lower plane, urging, as means subordinate to ecstatic fatalism in the pursuit of the 'world-aim,' free-speech, pacifism, and bigger and better schools. The continuity between elements so diverse must, of necessity, be somewhat tenuous; hence it may not be unfair to say of the book as a unit that, while by no means 'void,' it is certainly 'without form.'
