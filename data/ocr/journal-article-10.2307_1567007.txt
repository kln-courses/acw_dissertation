<plain_text><page sequence="1">Clarence John Laughlin Men and Buildings: American Victoriana A Brief Enquiry into its Follies and Marvels and its Misunderstood Accomplishments Just how psychological factors in the human mind, which have nothing directly to do with the necessity for shelter, nor with any of the obvious "practical" needs, manage, at times, to project them- selves into architecture is an absorbing and intricate problem which, it seems, has never received the careful and pro- longed attention it should. No book with which I am familiar offers a detailed analysis of the psycho-physical steps whereby certain compulsions, certain imaginative needs in the human psyche (whose origins cannot be wholly traced to a social and economic situation) are externalized architecturally. Is it perhaps not because these compulsions and de- sires cannot be explained completely in social and economic terms since they spring from depths from which rise the very roots of human individuality? And is not our general lack of interest in the psychological factors in architecture, rep- resenting and symbolizing modes of individual emotional expression, part of a total pattern which has led to a wide- spread disregard of the tremendous importance of the individual human imagination in architecture, and of the basic necessity of satisfying the needs of the personal human imagination in build- ing, instead of merely satisfying the needs of the human body? It is seemingly impossible to find in any of the architectural books the exact steps by which a house can become, for instance, an expression of a state of fear; or of retreat from human society; or can, at times, slowly acquire a kind of life of its own. And yet, there are examples of such occurrences, at least during the nine- teenth century. The attempts to under- stand more fully such instances would not necessarily be as futile as they seem. On the contrary, just as in psychiatry, where new light is thrown on the normal by studying the abnormal, so too a more complete analysis of the factors appear- ing in so-called "fantastic" houses which, in many cases, are extreme examples of the projection of a specific personality in architectural terms, might lead us to a more profound comprehension of the de- mands of the normal imagination and its basic necessity for having true individu- ality expressed in all things which surround it. Be this as it may, there is no doubt that one of the most fascinating and neglected forms of human expression is that category of habitations, each highly individualized in treatment, which we roughly denote by the generic term "Fantastic" architecture. And probably one of the richest, and least explored, fields where it is to be found is in the Vic- torian architecture of America's nine- teenth century. 8o Clarence J. Laughlin has an international reputation as a writer and photographer. He is the author of two books: New Or- leans and Its Living Past and Ghosts Along the Mississippi. His photographs have appeared in numerous periodicals, both in the United States and Europe. He has lectured extensively on Victorian ar- chitecture, and has held more than 200 one-man shows since 1936, when he started his photographic career. Mr. Laughlin initially became inter- ested in Victorian Chicago in I962, while working on a photographic assignment for the Chicago Historical Society. oo79-o958/8o/I7P8o-9i $03.00/0 ? 1980 Perspecta: The Yale Architec- tural Journal, Inc., and The Massachu- setts Institute of Technology</page><page sequence="2">It is true that for a long time now most structures belonging to this cate- gory have usually been considered merely as examples of the "bad taste" of other periods, or else, as amusing curiosities. But while this may be true of many such examples, they can, nevertheless be re- markable and significant psychological documents. Human confusion, human fear, and human frustration have crys- tallized so completely in some of these structures that they become subtle and re- vealing clues to the inner worlds of their owners and/or designers. More impor- tantly, they often tell us, indirectly, how narrow are our concepts of "function" in architecture. I feel that it would be possible to de- fend successsfully the contention that architecture which is extremely bad can tell the social historian and the psychol- ogist as much, at least, of the inner nature of human culture at a certain time and place as good architecture can. It does this because it can tell us of all the things that have gone wrong with the psychic factors in a culture at a certain period; of the blind alleys into which the human spirit has been led; the traps that have been sprung on the human mind. We need to know more about the cul-de- sacs of human sensibility and how they develop, for we have been led into one ourselves. Our architecture is becoming increasingly anonymous (with certain no- table exceptions) and our architects are increasingly engineers and politicians. But it should not be supposed that the values we can obtain from the study of Victorian or fantastic architecture are merely negative ones. Certainly, as far as the nineteenth century is concerned, there are some positive things to be rediscov- ered. For instance, when studying even badly designed houses from that period, we will find significant light thrown on the architectural use of "decoration" in a psychologically funtional sense: a sense that avoids the blankness of pure mass; a sense that gives individuality to a house; and that satisfies the aesthetic needs of an individual. In our time, we have gone back to the essentials of good design; we have learned to build in terms of pure mass, and in terms of the materials which we have. But we have failed to recognize that a true individual needs more than this, and we have forgotten, with the ex- ception of Sullivan, how to make decoration work integrally with materials and with the emotional seed of the de- sign. Of course, we are also tremendously hampered by the disappearance of the craftsman, the man who loved the mate- rials he worked with, and this has a great deal to do with the loss of human feeling in our buildings. It should be noted that one of the characteristics often observable in Vic- torian architecture is that it frequently exhibits strange mixtures of architectural influences. This is probably more true of the United States than it is of Europe, since America was a melting pot in more ways than one, and since during the nine- teenth century it was quite common to build houses which "eclectically" bor- rowed all kinds of stylistic details. The overall Victorian movement, much more fertile and extensive than the Greek Re- vival movement, flowered into many modes: Gothic Revival, Moorish Revival, Egyptian Revival, and others. Here it should be mentioned that while people conceive of the so-called revival styles as being merely uninspired copying, this is not necessarily true at all. In many cases, and usually unintentionally, factors due to the later time and place crept into the "copying" so that the "revival" be- came a new creation in its own right. Because of this fecundity, American Vic- torianism became the dominant architec- tural influence of the latter half of the nineteenth century. Eventually, in some instances at least, there developed an in- digenous American feeling, quite often making it different from English Vic- torian. So well did it take to the American environment, to a country bursting with energy, that its vigor, wild- ness, and extravagance became even adaptable, and indigenous, to different parts of this country. A Victorian man- sion in Chicago, for instance, became unlike, in many respects, a Victorian mansion in San Francisco. Even Los An- geles and San Francisco were not like one another in the general treatment of their Victorian houses. Among the few things that related Victorian houses all over this land were the incorporation in them of a fervid and romantic imagination and, usually, fine workmanship. No architec- ture of the nineteenth century anywhere can tell us more about the importance of the human imagination in architecture than the Victorian. The human imagination, also, is the one thing that can save our minds from the machine-dominated society in which we live; that can restore humanity to our housing and to the things we need and use in our daily lives. Fortunately, the deep-seated impulses that make human beings seek individuality, that make them want to create their own special living spaces, are not yet entirely dead. That they were very much alive indeed during the nineteenth century will, I think, be- come quite apparent from the images shown here. It should be useful to outline some of the major differences between the Vic- torian architect or builder and the architect or builder of our time: Psychological Functionalism To design a well-planned kitchen: saving steps and making work easier is physical functionalism. The modem architect has become so involved in this kind of func- tionalism that he does not seem to be aware that any other kind can exist. Many moder architects don't even seem to be cognizant that all good architecture of the past was functional in some man- ner or another. But there are intangible, as well as tangible, needs in human beings, particularly in those who are real individuals. Such people cannot be long satisfied with a house which is mostly a collection of labor-saving devices. A house becomes a home only when it meets some inner needs, and it is only through the satisfaction of inner needs that great architecture is created. But such architecture need not be imposing as long as it is involved, in some way, with the private world of a particular individ- ual. For want of a better term, this can be called the creation of "psychological functionalism." It, too, is very old in the history of architecture. But its principles, its modes of operation, have never been set forth to any great extent. However, W. R. Lethaby in England and, more re- cently, Kent C. Bloomer and Charles W. Moore in this country (in their book, Body, Memory and Architecture, Yale University Press, 1977) have begun to deal with these problems, and to indicate the importance of sensory and subliminal experiences of architecture as opposed to the intellectual type of experience associ- ated with "pure design." The Victorians, both here and abroad, became probably the greatest masters of psychological functionalism, possibly because they had complicated and active subliminal minds. For in- stance, they knew that a man of vigorous imagination needed a sense of mystery in a house. And because their painters, writ- ers, and architects were nearly all in- volved in some aspect of the fantasy so prevalent in the nineteenth century, and because they had a large number of su- perb craftsmen-wood and stone work- ers, iron and glass designers-fantasies in a huge variety began to appear in their houses and public buildings. Without in- tellectualizing, they found that fantasy satisfied them; that, somehow, it fulfilled a deep emotional need. 8i</page><page sequence="3">After having been in several thousand Victorian houses in this country, and after much thought and observation, I have gradually come to the conclusion that the great secret of Victorian architec- ture is that, basically, its visual insights and discoveries in form did not spring from any intellectual system as such, but instead took origin in the intuitive and subconscious mind. Its only other basis was fine craftsmanship. This way of working is entirely alien to our time, with our preoccupation with the techni- cal, the clinical approach and intellectual discourse. If we want our architecture to become human again; if we want more individuality in the places where we live and work, we shall have to rediscover the sources of fantasy which are deep in the secret recesses of the subliminal mind. Fantasy is anthropomorphic. Its main function is to make the inhuman universe in which we all live related more to human needs. Our habitations should reflect, and be a part of, this imaginative process. And since the fantasies in metal and wood, and in stone and glass, can only be created by the magic of the human hand, we need evidence of the work of the human hand all around us. To bring all these changes about, how- ever, will require a revolution within man himself. This will not be rapid or easy, but there is some small evidence, at least, that some change is beginning to occur. Function and Fantasy Another important difference between the Victorian and the modem designer was the ability of the former to com- pletely fuse function and fantasy: the physical and the psychological uses of the object. This, again, needed the interven- tion of the intuitive mind and to be carried out by a high level of craftsman- ship. To the good Victorian designer "decoration" was not a dirty word as it is today. It was not merely the superficial elaboration of surface. "Decoration" meant something much more active and subtle. Just as the cast iron galleries of New Orleans were physically functional because they allowed access to the open air while still protecting the inhabitants from the fierce suns and heavy rains, and were, at the same time, psychologically functional by creating the feeling of a bower (tying in with the luxuriant plant forms, and separating the elevated gallery from the world of the street), so, too, the Victorians found numerous ways to make "decoration" create an individual mood for a house; or to fashion delights for the eye; or to completely modify the feeling of the building being only a wood or brick box. The Victorians were adept at doing this sort of thing. The satisfac- tion of the need for beauty, the creation of a house as an organic thing, lovingly adjusted to all the needs of the beings it shelters, cannot be accomplished by physical functionalism alone; another kind of functionalism must be present. The Principle of Contrast Above all, the Victorians understood the principles of contrast, which is very old in the history of architecture, but which is still valid, and which the modem archi- tect seems to have forgotten completely. They understood that in order to make any particular element work in designing it should be contrasted, or opposed, by other elements. The modem architect, in his frantic search for "pure form" (and to cut down construction expenses) threw away decoration, color, and texture. He has finally rediscovered texture, and he is slowly rediscovering color: how it can be used to modify form, give lightness or heaviness to walls. But in their obsessive search for "pure form" the architects of our time (with the exception of Antonio Gaudi) have ended primarily and iron- ically achieving what amounts to total blankness, to massive inexpressiveness. Purity, when there is no complexity nearby to make it work, becomes com- pletely without individuality and com- pletely inhuman. This is because it lacks anything to focus the eye and interest the mind. Opposition and counter-play in forms and visual significance create a dy- namic tension in a building or a room which help to give them "life": those fac- tors that the "life" of a building ulti- mately imply is a field that demands a great deal more thought and investigation than has yet been done. Since architecture is the one art most deeply involved with human beings; since its roots go far below the conscious level of the human psyche; since it has the po- tential to influence human beings so that they will become more complete individ- uals, it follows that all kinds of mental and emotional traits can become involved with, and fostered by, the "house." It also follows that it is of the greatest im- portance for us to know more about the relations between men and buildings. More comprehension of the intuitive dis- coveries of the Victorians should definitely help us in this direction. San Francisco Victorian The Foorman House, California, late 1800s. The Foorman House has, to a superlative degree, most of those special features and de- tails to which the term "S. F. Victorian" can be applied, and which make such houses quite different from the Victorian houses of Chicago, or even Los Angeles, and often makes them indigenous to their lo- cality. Among the "special" features here: a magnificently carved Egyptian Revival head over the portico; capitals which become clusters of flowers; an upper window with a heavy entablature end- ing in scrolls; highly developed cornices and brackets. Part of the strong verticality of houses such as this derived from the fact that they had to be placed on narrow, steep lots. But a large part of their feeling rose from the fact that they repre- sented triumphs of virtuosity on the part of the woodcarvers and carpenters since it is doubtful that most houses of this general kind in San Fran- cisco ever had formal archi- tects. The Victorian architects and craftsmen of the nine- teenth century were the most inventive in our history. Note also the consonance between the Egyptian head and the palm tree at lower right. 8z</page><page sequence="4">a_., _ _. _ _ - pe-,~.

Sonnenthiel Mansion, Galveston. Diagonal view of this mar- velous house. The elaborate galleries exhibit a delightful fu- sion of Moorish Revival with the architecture of the Mis- sissippi River steamboats. Note how the toothed forms are used with the cross-hatched forms. The entire feeling is al- most one of aerial levitation. This mansion represents a real architectural achievement in that it perfectly expresses the nature of its materials as well as the demands of the climate. A Revealing Profile J. Sonnenthiel Mansion, Galveston. A profile of part of the facade of this indigenous mansion. A highly significant profile, actu- ally, for careful study will reveal how various and subtle are the many ways the designer found while using only one material-wood-to define, en- compass, and release space. 84</page><page sequence="6">The Floating House The Doullut House, New Orleans, 1905. This extraordinary eight-sided house was built in I905 by Capt. Milton Doullut "with his own hands and the help of his son and one negro." It is crowned with the replica of a pilot house from which, after his retirement from the river, Capt. Doullut could watch the Mississippi River and its boats, both of which he loved. The slim columns of its encircling gallery (modeled after a steam- boat's decks) are enwreathed with swags of wooden balls, which move in the wind to suggest the feeling that the building moves like a boat! In- stinctively, in this house the Captain recreated his life on the great river and his inner needs. Because of this, it be- comes involved with a pro- found kind of psychological functionalism that goes com- pletely beyond the limited kind of physical functionalism which is all we can attain in our time. A Significant Ornament Sealy Street House, Galveston, 1900s. Not only does the eave orna- ment used in this simple Vic- torian house state the nature of its material in terms embody- ing the potentials of that material, not only does it serve to push to a more complex level the pure and delicate woodwork of the porch with its wooden cornice-like eyelet embroidery, thereby helping to give more individuality to the house, but also, ultimately, since it is the tesult of a par- ticular human imagination working with a particular ma- terial, it enhances the house psychologically by giving it an imaginative dimension and, therefore, a truly human di- mension. This means that it speaks to the human mind, to the human necessity and hun- ger for variety and individu- ality. This is one of the results of psychological functionalism. 85</page><page sequence="7">The House as a Painting Hickory Street House, St. Louis, 1890s. This edifice of the late nine- teenth century eventually be- came a rooming house. In the I95os one of its inmates was a man named John Dudas, who was a waiter in a hotel. Like many other people, Dudas in- stinctively had the strong need to express himself. He had never been in an art school, but driven by his inner need, he finally started by painting the walls of his room, later the ceiling, and then the floor. Later still, he went down the hall and the staircase-creating an inner landscape, with trees with flaming flowers. Ul- timately, since the landlord did not live in the house, he cou- rageously tackled the outer walls of the house. Here is one wall with the reality of the house transformed into the re- ality of painting and the physi- cal space usurped by visual space: the transformation of architecture by the inner needs of a man! This is the spirit in which the Victorians worked. The Asymmetric House Cripple Creek, Colorado, 1890s. Later affluence, probably, made the addition of a ves- tibule possible on this Western miner's house. It was set off- center, it seems, so as not to in- terfere with vision from the window above. This gives the structure a curiously unbal- anced quality. The second re- vealing contrast here is the extreme delicacy of the lovely little piece of jig-saw work (al- most like a violin bridge) placed beneath the gable, as against the stolidity of most of the house (which is based upon rock). This little habitation speaks of the spirit of this American place and, also, of the extreme importance of the element of contrast in architecture. Victorian Oppositions House, N. Cleveland Avenue, Chicago, 1880s. The lightness, the grace, the elegance of this truly superb wrought iron ensemble works all the more effectively because of the massiveness of the stone forms comprising the back- ground: a typical Victorian opposition. And incidentally, this wrought iron is of a quality that not even New Or- leans can equal, yet it is practically unknown because no one expects to find good wrought iron in Chicago. 86</page><page sequence="8">Ornament as Subconscious Imagery S. Drexel Boulevard Mansion, Chicago, 1890s. Several subtle lessons in Vic- torian decoration are embod- ied in this unique door on the South side. Most of this door was quite "pure" in treatment (even by our standards) but an elaborate ornament was added. Why? The Victorians knew that the added ornament would make the "purity" of the surrounding areas work more effectively, and that, in turn, these "pure" areas would enhance and focus the rich- ness of the ornament. But something even more subtle is being evidenced in this door. On the conscious level of his mind, the Victorian designer here merely wished to create an attractive and luxuriant or- nament-but, at the same time, his subconscious mind was also operating so that the cen- tral part of this ornament, when we examine it closely, re- veals a strange and expressive face with bulbous eyes, flaring nose, and drawn-up mouth. This is because the sub- conscious mind needs to see all objects as though they were alive. And it is because the Vic- torian designers and craftsmen were working under conditions which made individuality much more desirable than to- day, that they were able to project better than we the cre- ative power of the latent mind. And because that is true, they were using "decoration" in a way which goes far beyond our superficial concept of what decoration means. The Iron Shell Old Louisiana State Capitol, Baton Rouge. Looking down from the dome, we now see, far below, the spiral cast-iron staircase which connects the first and second floors. Its geometry is as pure as a nautilus shell. The two floors are covered by black and white marble squares. When they are seen from above, as here, a space transformation takes place, and the space be- tween the two floors seems to collapse, or flatten out-pro- ducing a spatial enigma. [Note: The May 1967 issue of The Architectural Review (London) has my article on this wonderful building.] 87</page><page sequence="9">I Wooden Flames S. Grand Boulevard Mansion, St. Louis. On the landing of the staircase we find another probably unique St. Louis example of the woodcarver's art: a cherub who grows into existence from a lovely and intricate curve holding a burning torch whose flame (let us hope!) will never come alive. The complex deco- rative pieces composing the upper part of this curve are all ingeniously fitted together without nails. This is crafts- manship of an order that our society cannot touch. 88</page><page sequence="10">The l.anga!age of American Victorianism Herhold Mansion, Chicago, 1889. The main hall of this superbly Victorian house, looking to- ward the front door. At this time, every lovely detail was in perfect condition: the com- plexly turned and extremely delicate hall screen; the hall mirror with its brass coat hangers; the door with its finely bevelled glass panels; the intricately panelled staircase with its bronze newel figure-a literal poem of Victorian craftsmanship. The nature of the details here and the way they are related to one another shows a purely American Vic- torian idiom-indeed, one most common to Chicago. Despite all this, this marvelous house was destroyed to make room for a contemporary hospital. The Golden Swan S. Grand Boulevard Mansion, St. Louis. At the foot of the staircase is a magnificent swan in golden oak, the favorite wood of the Victorians. At first sight it seems naturalistic, but careful study will reveal that it is a truly creative design, using water flowers and cattails in its non-naturalistic concept. It is a master work of American nineteenth century wooden sculpture. 89</page><page sequence="11">Vision in a Chimney Window S. Grand Boulevard Mansion, St. Louis. This is a closer view of the rich details of the woodwork above the mantel with an Art Nouveau bust near the intri- cate wooden grill. The chief focal point, however, is the ex- traordinary oval window which pierces the chimney. The glass in the window is painted with three winged cherubs whose visages look like actual portraits. The more we study this whole complex: fireplace, mantel, and window, the more we feel that it is some kind of personal shrine set apart from the rest of the house. Perhaps this feeling is at least partly explained by the story that the cherubs are, ac- tually, the images of the chil- dren of the first owner of this house. If so, this is just one small instance of how deeply Victorian owners were in- volved with their houses and why good Victorian houses were so individual. Fireplace of the Witches S. Grand Boulevard Mansion, St. Louis. Now we approach more closely to the fireplace. It is no less extraordinary and expres- sive than the rest of the complex. The three sections of its bronze fireback all deal with witches: one (at left) a witch riding a broom; then one at center with witches brewing a potion; and the last, a witch evoking a spell. Surprising fig- ures, indeed, to appear in the rational Victorian world! An inscription on the fireback reads: "Copyright I886. By J. W. Ehninger." And this is even more surprising and sug- gests a fruitful field for re- search: who were the people who were able to get designs like this copyrighted in the nineteenth century? This is one of the many aspects of the enormous field of Victorian ar- chitecture that has not been properly investigated. Incredible Fireplace and Mantel S. Grand Boulevard Mansion, St. Louis. The fireplace and mantel of the dining room were very intri- cately designed to achieve complete unity, using asym- metric elements. The wood of the mantel and its surround- ings is mahogany; the facing of the fireplace, marble. One of the most important parts of this complex ensemble is a glass window which goes through the chimney (the flues divide) which is also off center.

To this writer, much of .~ , o ~~~ ~the playfulness and inventive- ness of the Victorian imagina- tion is summed up in this superb caprice (design) of a mother dragon and her off- spring. Not only is she a dragon unlike any other of the pictured versions of dragons usually seen, but the character of the design is beautifully re- lated to the space it occupies. Serpent Swallowing Its Tail S. Grand Boulevard Mansion, St. Louis. A hall grill that incorporates an intricately convoluted and foliated serpent of oak, grasp- ing its own tail. Perhaps a symbol of eternity. But in any event, another marvelous ex- ample of the skill and imagina- tion of the master woodcarv- ers who worked in this house. The chief reason this mansion has been covered in such detail is in order to indicate what a storehouse of visual delights every truly fine Victorian man- sion was. 9i - p f . ~ 'P. . 71 1 ?</page></plain_text>
