This exceptional object thus provides a glimpse of possible elements of the Irish later prehistoric world-view and cosmology. The closest contemporary parallels for this type of representational decoration on high-status metallic objects come from elsewhere in Europe and potential connections will be discussed. The primary purpose of this paper, however, is to consider how the two main elements of the Dunaverney flesh-hook, its primary use as a feasting utensil and its avian embellishment, are related to each other and what this may tell us about the socio-cultural context of its use. It is suggested that the bird figures on the Dunaverney flesh-hook were metaphorically linked to a tripartite world-view which is expressed contemporaneously elsewhere in Europe.

This explanation of the practical function of flesh-hooks is The Dunaverney flesh-hook (Fig. 1) was found in 1829 now widely accepted and is bolstered by their (very) during peat-cutting in the Garry Bog, Co.

While they may range in date from ritual deposition of high-status feasting equipment, roughly 1300 to 800 BC, five of the eight likely date including cauldrons, buckets and flesh-hooks (Leonard from a similar time to the Dunaverney flesh-hook, 2014). perhaps indicating the development of an Irish ‘fashion’ Ritual practices such as feasting create patterns for using flesh-hooks in feasting rituals at about 1000 that can be observed and analysed. Although the BC.

It was constructed at about 600 BC. The archaeological record reveals that from three hollow bronze ferrules (a cylindrical sleeve late Bronze Age Ireland was home to a dynamic and or cap to fit on a wooden shaft) originally joined by complex cultural system which had broad networks of wooden rods, resulting in an object which was probably interaction and communication over both land and sea. about 80cm long; the double-pronged hook is Evidence from settlements, material culture integrated into one of the ferrules (Bowman and assemblages and ritual practices, as well as Needham 2007, 64–6). The bronze ferrules are communication and exchange within Ireland and decorated with engraved rings dispersed almost evenly overseas, all point to a high level of social complexity along their length. Additional decoration can be seen (Waddell 2010; Leonard 2014). This is a distinct period on the surviving wooden shaft fragment, which is characterised by the introduction of the bronze slashing inlaid with strips of bronze arranged in a herringbone sword to Ireland, which signifies not only a change in pattern, suggested to be a skeuomorphic imitation of warrior accoutrements but also in combat tactics, the twisted metal shafts found on contemporary flesh- prestigious display and possibly societal organisation hooks elsewhere in Europe (Fig. 3) (ibid., 56–61). and interaction.

In this way we are able to view was dependent on the motivation behind the feasting unique objects such as the Trundholm ‘sun-chariot’ and event.
